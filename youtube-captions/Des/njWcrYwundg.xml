  <text start="9.389" dur="4.17">and GMOs you see on occasion I go into</text>
  <text start="12.12" dur="3.87">Google and I just type in some keywords</text>
  <text start="13.559" dur="5.011">to see what comes up did that this</text>
  <text start="15.99" dur="3.78">morning and found quite a few articles</text>
  <text start="18.57" dur="3.75">come out over the past couple of days</text>
  <text start="19.77" dur="5.37">about vaccines GMOs and they are</text>
  <text start="22.32" dur="5.279"> propaganda articles so I want</text>
  <text start="25.14" dur="3.629">to talk about them and you see before I</text>
  <text start="27.599" dur="5.12">get into that though I want to make a</text>
  <text start="28.769" dur="6.691">point and that is that the censorship of</text>
  <text start="32.719" dur="4.691">information it&amp;#39;s not a political issue</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of talk going around</text>
  <text start="37.41" dur="4.02">these days about the idea of</text>
  <text start="39.87" dur="5.04">conservatives being suppressed</text>
  <text start="41.43" dur="6.75">conservatives being censored and yeah</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="5.52">sometimes conservative ideologies fit</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="5">into narratives that the deep state or</text>
  <text start="50.43" dur="5.85">the cabal doesn&amp;#39;t want out there but</text>
  <text start="53.18" dur="5.859">censorship is not a it doesn&amp;#39;t fit into</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="4.68">that political duality spectrum you see</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="3.75">when it comes to for instance health</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="5.13">information and many other topics as</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="6.721">well they are just as censor just as</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="6.84">ridicule just as suppressed as quote</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="5.609">conservative ideas are and this has been</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="5.43">going on for years and years I mean I</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="5.311">have been in the natural health realm</text>
  <text start="78.36" dur="4.89">for you know six seven years now</text>
  <text start="80.43" dur="5.729">researching and being active in it and I</text>
  <text start="83.25" dur="5.22">have seen censorship and suppression go</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="4.161">on that whole time threats for talking</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="4.92">about you know vaccine GMO truths</text>
  <text start="90.32" dur="5.92">ridicule in the media etc etc so point I</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="5.67">want to make here truth is what censored</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="6.51">not conservatives truth sometimes truth</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="7.169">is not a conservative thing so let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="5.67">into some of these topics first one seen</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="6.331">this going around many places it says a</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="6.12">new vaccine could wipe out acne and if</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="3.12">you know anything about holistic health</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="3.329">this is just about one of the most</text>
  <text start="115.68" dur="5.969">laughable things you could ever read</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="6.421">first of all vaccines don&amp;#39;t prevent</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="4.981">disease they&amp;#39;re just completely lied to</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="4.499">us about them the foundations of what</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="4.019">they tell us about vaccines are wrong</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="4.261">they don&amp;#39;t stimulate proper immune</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="3.301">response so a it&amp;#39;s not like vaccines the</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="2.64">end-all cure-all</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="3.149">like some people think abortion is like</text>

  <text start="137.099" dur="4.981">abortion oh I got a disease just get a</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="7.8">vaccine no it&amp;#39;s not like that and second</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="7.29">of all acne acne itself is not caused by</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="3.149">some kind of virus or can&amp;#39;t get rid of</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="3.18">some kind of disease</text>
  <text start="150.209" dur="4.621">acne is just simply caused by bad habits</text>
  <text start="152.55" dur="5.73">really it&amp;#39;s caused by internal body</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="5.28">fungus Candida especially fungus in your</text>

  <text start="164.67" dur="4.2">purging it through the largest organ of</text>
  <text start="166.29" dur="4.11">your body that is your skin so acne the</text>
  <text start="168.87" dur="3.3">best thing to do to get rid of acne is</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="4.32">take a freakin probiotic drink some</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="4.86">kombucha just get healthier the reason</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="3.81">so many teens get acne is because their</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="2.94">hormones are all changing and of course</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="4.049">teenagers can start making their own</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="4.019">choices in life you know parents can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.579" dur="2.581">really tell them what to eat anymore so</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="2.161">they just go out and eat whatever the</text>

  <text start="198.75" dur="5.4">it said meet the Forgotten scientists</text>
  <text start="201.569" dur="5.881">who invented the measles vaccine and</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="5.369">then it goes on to say yada yada as if</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="5.7">Jonas Salk gained worldwide fame for his</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="6.391">polio vaccine again vaccines don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="4.86">rid of disease conveniently when they</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="5.1">introduced the polio vaccine to the</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="5.789">public they also redefined meningitis</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="4.62">so what doctors started doing is saying</text>
  <text start="223.799" dur="3.421">that less people had polio and saying</text>
  <text start="225.63" dur="3.15">that more people had meningitis you see</text>
  <text start="227.22" dur="3.69">that artificially lowered the polio</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="4.26">numbers introduced the vaccine I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="4.47">rewrite the book so it makes it look</text>
  <text start="233.04" dur="4.199">like the vaccine got rid of polio not</text>
  <text start="235.38" dur="4.05">really it&amp;#39;s still around it&amp;#39;s just</text>

  <text start="426.19" dur="5.91">myths about vaccines but they&amp;#39;re anti</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="6.9">GMO and one last article on GMOs again</text>
  <text start="432.1" dur="3.24">the Washington Examiner kind of bummed</text>
  <text start="434.89" dur="3.63">me out</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="6.03">typically the Washington Examiner writes</text>
  <text start="438.52" dur="5.31">more political truth than most other</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="4.29">corporate media like CNN and NBC and</text>
  <text start="443.83" dur="3.42">Washington Post and what not Washington</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="4.14">Examiner I typically like more for that</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="5.4">but they dropped the ball with this</text>
  <text start="449.8" dur="5.79">opinion piece totally fumble it they say</text>
  <text start="452.65" dur="4.26">an anti sent scientific cults again</text>
  <text start="455.59" dur="3.9">those beautiful keywords their</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="5.88">mind-control keywords anti-scientific</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="6.54">and cult science just the word science</text>
  <text start="462.79" dur="5.57">these days has been used so conveniently</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="5.04">so efficiently at brainwashing us</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="5.08">science confers something must be the</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="5.73">truth right it&amp;#39;s not like science or</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="6.12">data can be made up or lied about mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="6.03">anyway this says an anti scientific cult</text>
  <text start="479.56" dur="5.85">has way too much control over non GMO</text>
  <text start="482.83" dur="5.52">food labels and what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="485.41" dur="5.97">do is discredit the non-gmo project</text>
  <text start="488.35" dur="4.71">verified company which this company has</text>
  <text start="491.38" dur="4.71">been in existence for a while now I</text>
  <text start="493.06" dur="4.83">think maybe upwards of 10 years and they</text>
  <text start="496.09" dur="4.65">have grown immensely because so many</text>
  <text start="497.89" dur="5.16">natural and organic companies they they</text>
  <text start="500.74" dur="4.95">understand that the USDA Organic stamp</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="3.93">really doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything really all</text>
  <text start="505.69" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s required for that stamp is</text>
  <text start="506.98" dur="4.92">paperwork and a bunch of money and you</text>
  <text start="509.29" dur="4.05">can get in USDA Organic label not much</text>
