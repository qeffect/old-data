  <text start="115.2" dur="4.529">that I want to share with you guys today</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="7.561">I want to talk a little bit more about</text>
  <text start="119.729" dur="6.271">the Hawaii missile right so if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="3.329">guys have been following what I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="126" dur="6.03">saying on that for the past few days</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="5.431">I&amp;#39;ve been talking about the hypothesis</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="5.68">of</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="9.07">the Hawaii missile being a false alarm</text>
  <text start="137.71" dur="10.17">and being set off purposely by the said</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="8.4">white hats to stimulate what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="147.88" dur="6.21">bolt data transfer or essentially make</text>
  <text start="150.52" dur="5.9">some secure files at the NSA some</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="4.89">classified files that was at Hawaii&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.42" dur="7">NSA databases be transferred to the</text>
  <text start="158.98" dur="6.45">mainland here but now based on some</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="3.33">other information and a lot of different</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="3.87">people saying a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="166.75" dur="5.64">I&amp;#39;m beginning to think that there was a</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="5.85">real missile set off this is an article</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="5.85">here that dr. Michael Saleh posted on</text>
  <text start="175.15" dur="4.98">his Exopolitics org website and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="178.24" dur="4.59">also of course be posting this in the</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="5.55">description below dr. Michael Saleh does</text>
  <text start="182.83" dur="5.85">amazing work go check his stuff out but</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="5.97">he does a great expose discussing how</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="5.13">this was likely a real missile I mean we</text>
  <text start="191.65" dur="4.11">have eyewitness testimony of people</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="5.55">seeing a missile being sent off and</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="5.699">taken down and he goes into discussing</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="5.39">who did it he was saying okay it might</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="6.421">have been some rogue factions of</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="4.63">Israel&amp;#39;s military doing it and then gets</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="3.63">into some other research saying okay</text>
  <text start="209.38" dur="7.41">maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t them maybe it was some</text>
  <text start="211.51" dur="8.81">rogue CIA factions great expose but</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="8.49">again I&amp;#39;m thinking it was a real missile</text>
  <text start="220.32" dur="7.87">but now I&amp;#39;m not saying that he was wrong</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="6.05">but I think there&amp;#39;s multiple things at</text>
  <text start="228.19" dur="5.7">play here and not only do we have people</text>
  <text start="231.33" dur="4.81">having sources saying that was a real</text>
  <text start="233.89" dur="3.45">missile but check these pictures out so</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;ve been holding onto these pictures</text>
  <text start="237.34" dur="5.19">for a few days but I haven&amp;#39;t shown them</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="5.28">on YouTube quite yet although these were</text>
  <text start="242.53" dur="5.16">actually broadcast live on CNN during</text>
  <text start="245.56" dur="4.89">that false alarm in Hawaii and check it</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="6.09">out you can see it&amp;#39;s craft literally</text>
  <text start="250.45" dur="5.7">craft and whether it&amp;#39;s secret space</text>
  <text start="253.78" dur="5.1">program craft I&amp;#39;m honestly of the belief</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="4.8">that this is more UFO craft because you</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="5.55">can see the mark above shape in these</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="5.49">and here is a saturated version of it</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="4.2">that you can</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="6.48">in here and you can see the Merkava</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="7.02">shaped there so if you know anything</text>
  <text start="272.92" dur="4.8">about the history of nuclear missiles</text>
  <text start="275.65" dur="4.68">and how there has been many many</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="4.37">occurrences of UFOs and</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="4.77">extraterrestrials</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="4.75">assisting humanity with the basically</text>
  <text start="285.1" dur="3.36">the shutdown of UFOs there&amp;#39;s all kinds</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="3.66">of testimony and sightings of UFOs</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="3.66">appearing over nuclear missile silos</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="5.91">here in America and literally powering</text>
  <text start="292.12" dur="8.1">down the whole area so I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="7.05">there was a real missile shutoff and it</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="6.63">was taken down by something in the skies</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="6.9">some civilizations helping us now again</text>
  <text start="306.85" dur="6.87">I&amp;#39;m not saying he was wrong I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="310.36" dur="6.27">saying that there&amp;#39;s multiple things at</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="5.4">play there&amp;#39;s multiple layers as to</text>
  <text start="316.63" dur="4.92">what&amp;#39;s going on here right as he was</text>
  <text start="319.12" dur="5.85">said before disinformation is necessary</text>
  <text start="321.55" dur="5.07">and things he says might have multiple</text>
  <text start="324.97" dur="3.57">meanings so he says okay could&amp;#39;ve been a</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="3.6">fake alarm false alarm something that</text>
  <text start="328.54" dur="4.5">effect doesn&amp;#39;t mean a missile wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="6.06">necessarily shut off right and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="333.04" dur="5.7">now read somebody who commented on my</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.92">Twitter yesterday it was a fantastic</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="5.31">comment so shout out to this guy his</text>
  <text start="341.2" dur="4.2">name was need integrity now that was his</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="5.369">Twitter handle and I&amp;#39;m just gonna read</text>
  <text start="345.4" dur="5.79">you the word-for-word the comment he</text>
  <text start="349.419" dur="6.391">made because it was a fantastic one</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="8.19">right and he said if Q confirmed and</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="6.42">people dig in to find out that our et</text>
  <text start="359.38" dur="6.24">friends are responsible for taking it</text>
  <text start="362.23" dur="7.05">out taking the missile out Q&amp;#39;s authority</text>
  <text start="365.62" dur="7.68">becomes inadvertently undermined right</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="4.44">makes absolute sense and he&amp;#39;s too smart</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="1.95">for that</text>
  <text start="373.72" dur="3.6">so Q&amp;#39;s not going to do that he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="4.98">call it a false alarm and a fake missile</text>
  <text start="377.32" dur="5.43">threat because these pills are too big</text>
  <text start="380.23" dur="6.15">for some people to swallow even for the</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="6.15">cue woke folk disinfo necessary to avoid</text>
  <text start="386.38" dur="6.149">the conspiracy label and I absolutely</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="9.899">agree with that so you know</text>
  <text start="392.529" dur="8.55">a lot of people in that are in the how</text>
  <text start="398.799" dur="4.5">do I want to frame this not trying to</text>
  <text start="401.079" dur="4.29">put anybody down but I&amp;#39;m just saying</text>
  <text start="403.299" dur="3.63">that the extra stroll and UFO phenomenon</text>
  <text start="405.369" dur="3.93">is still something that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="406.929" dur="4.62">haven&amp;#39;t delved too deep into especially</text>
  <text start="409.299" dur="7.32">a lot of people you know working on this</text>
  <text start="411.549" dur="6.9">cue stuff and in the itch from make</text>
  <text start="416.619" dur="5.34">America great again community if I want</text>
  <text start="418.449" dur="5.07">to say that so like this comment said</text>
  <text start="421.959" dur="4.14">those are still some red pills that</text>
  <text start="423.519" dur="5.73">might be too big to swallow and at least</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="5.43">when it comes to cue he has dropped some</text>
  <text start="429.249" dur="5.34">things made some drops before that</text>
  <text start="431.529" dur="4.73">actually coincide with the UFO issue for</text>
  <text start="434.589" dur="3.42">instance like the Pentagon audit and</text>
  <text start="436.259" dur="4.18">Antarctica for instance cue has</text>
  <text start="438.009" dur="3.93">mentioned Antarctica that was towards</text>
  <text start="440.439" dur="6.63">the end of November I believe pretty</text>
  <text start="441.939" dur="6.99">early on but for now cue doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="447.069" dur="4.59">Indy who doesn&amp;#39;t want to get into that</text>
  <text start="448.929" dur="5.37">and at least what&amp;#39;s going on with the</text>
  <text start="451.659" dur="7.58">chants and all that getting into the UFO</text>
  <text start="454.299" dur="8.18">subject it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not like it</text>

  <text start="466.149" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s just that we have other things to</text>
  <text start="469.059" dur="3.36">worry about at least the people on the</text>
  <text start="471.159" dur="3.24">chan networks have other things to worry</text>
  <text start="472.419" dur="3.78">about at this moment then the et</text>
  <text start="474.399" dur="3.78">phenomenon but of course me myself I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1090.82" dur="6.14">be able to arrest them right but this is</text>
  <text start="1093.04" dur="11.79">kind of misleading and that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="1096.96" dur="9.88">arrest protections are only or I should</text>
  <text start="1104.83" dur="4.62">say members of Congress are only</text>

  <text start="1109.45" dur="5.64">misdemeanors and whatnot when it comes</text>
  <text start="1110.95" dur="5.64">to felonies and treason for instance</text>
  <text start="1115.09" dur="4.11">they can be arrested whether Congress is</text>
  <text start="1116.59" dur="3.75">in session or not so I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>

  <text start="1120.34" dur="3.15">the Constitution is misleading I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1121.63" dur="4.25">saying people&amp;#39;s misinterpretation of it</text>

  <text start="1128.47" dur="4.08">when it comes to felonies and trees and</text>

  <text start="1266.41" dur="5.94">care more about their political agenda</text>
  <text start="1269.76" dur="5.82">this number right here two oh two four</text>
  <text start="1272.35" dur="5.7">five six eleven eleven make a wish</text>
  <text start="1275.58" dur="2.95">synchronicity but anyway if you call</text>
  <text start="1278.05" dur="3.6">that number</text>
  <text start="1278.53" dur="4.98">it literally blames congressional</text>
  <text start="1281.65" dur="4.65">Democrats for holding government funding</text>
  <text start="1283.51" dur="7.77">hostage due to an unrelated immigration</text>
  <text start="1286.3" dur="7.32">debate absolutely so that&amp;#39;s just savage</text>
  <text start="1291.28" dur="3.66">super troll it&amp;#39;s amazing but anyway</text>
  <text start="1293.62" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s last few things I want to share</text>
  <text start="1294.94" dur="6.27">with you guys interesting article here</text>
  <text start="1298.36" dur="5.07">NSA sincerely regrets deleting all Bush</text>
  <text start="1301.21" dur="6.09">era surveillance data that it was</text>
  <text start="1303.43" dur="7.26">ordered to preserve and I found this</text>
  <text start="1307.3" dur="5.79">interesting because my instant thought</text>
  <text start="1310.69" dur="4.8">when I saw this it was all Bush era</text>
  <text start="1313.09" dur="4.32">surveillance data so what if we have</text>
  <text start="1315.49" dur="4.2">some kind of blackhat within the NSA</text>
  <text start="1317.41" dur="4.5">trying to scrub bush stuff</text>
  <text start="1319.69" dur="5.61">I mean all of the eyes have been on</text>
  <text start="1321.91" dur="5.7">Hillary Clinton right rightly so I mean</text>
  <text start="1325.3" dur="2.79">we want the Clinton in that shithole</text>
  <text start="1327.61" dur="4.26">found</text>
  <text start="1328.09" dur="5.4">of hers to go down in flames but what</text>
  <text start="1331.87" dur="4.65">about the bushes I mean they haven&amp;#39;t had</text>
  <text start="1333.49" dur="6.6">too much of the spotlight on them lately</text>
  <text start="1336.52" dur="8.61">so I bet that they&amp;#39;re trying to sanitize</text>
  <text start="1340.09" dur="8.88">as much evidence against them as they</text>
  <text start="1345.13" dur="6.78">can Hillary Clinton burned her house</text>
  <text start="1348.97" dur="4.14">to probably get rid of some evidence and</text>
  <text start="1351.91" dur="1.74">I bet the bushes are doing the same</text>
  <text start="1353.11" dur="4.11">thing</text>
  <text start="1353.65" dur="5.67">while the spotlight is not on them so</text>
  <text start="1357.22" dur="5.46">that&amp;#39;s instantly what I saw here because</text>
  <text start="1359.32" dur="7.29">of course I mean NSA no such agency they</text>
  <text start="1362.68" dur="6.05">are looking like to have some absolute</text>
  <text start="1366.61" dur="5.28">white hats helping us which I do believe</text>
  <text start="1368.73" dur="4.33">but it&amp;#39;s not so black and white there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1371.89" dur="3.21">always some gray there&amp;#39;s always some</text>
  <text start="1373.06" dur="3.93">infiltration counter infiltration going</text>
  <text start="1375.1" dur="7.05">on and I would imagine that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="1376.99" dur="8.82">what happened here because Politico</text>
  <text start="1382.15" dur="6.24">reported this as well which is odd seems</text>
  <text start="1385.81" dur="6.09">to be Politico maybe trying to shine a</text>
  <text start="1388.39" dur="5.19">bad spotlight on the NSA maybe to kind</text>
  <text start="1391.9" dur="3.87">of cover cover the ass since he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1393.58" dur="4.86">queueing on revelations of no such</text>
  <text start="1395.77" dur="6.99">agency being white hats but then of</text>
  <text start="1398.44" dur="6.69">course Bush ordered why you&amp;#39;re tapping</text>
  <text start="1402.76" dur="4.35">was sanitized from it so that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1405.13" dur="5.31">some thoughts I had on that article this</text>
  <text start="1407.11" dur="5.34">one here by the BBC CIA releases 13</text>
  <text start="1410.44" dur="6.78">million pages of declassified documents</text>
  <text start="1412.45" dur="8.13">online and the main picture that the BBC</text>
  <text start="1417.22" dur="6.39">posted with some UFO photos some saucer</text>
  <text start="1420.58" dur="6.57">photos man-made et we don&amp;#39;t really know</text>
  <text start="1423.61" dur="5.37">could be either but I found an</text>
  <text start="1427.15" dur="5.16">interesting because in this article by</text>
  <text start="1428.98" dur="5.93">the BBC they that was what they focused</text>
  <text start="1432.31" dur="6.09">on the records include UFO sightings and</text>
  <text start="1434.91" dur="5.92">psychic experiments a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1438.4" dur="4.82">declassified documents were on remote</text>
  <text start="1440.83" dur="5.4">viewing experiments that the CIA did and</text>
  <text start="1443.22" dur="4.78">synchronistically enough I did a video</text>
  <text start="1446.23" dur="5.52">on remote viewing just a few days ago</text>
  <text start="1448" dur="5.49">and then the CIA releases a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1451.75" dur="4.56">declassified documents on remote viewing</text>
  <text start="1453.49" dur="6.45">so that&amp;#39;s just funny did i remote view</text>
  <text start="1456.31" dur="5.46">that who knows but anyway there&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="1459.94" dur="5.55">there and then</text>
  <text start="1461.77" dur="5.82">speaking of flying saucers I kind of</text>
  <text start="1465.49" dur="4.74">missed this Newsweek article that came</text>
  <text start="1467.59" dur="4.47">out on the 16th five days ago but it</text>
  <text start="1470.23" dur="5.19">says Russia fears that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1472.06" dur="8.1">planning for a space war speaking of</text>
  <text start="1475.42" dur="8.94">space Wars man something that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1480.16" dur="6.72">discussing for a bit now because of</text>
  <text start="1484.36" dur="5.67">course we&amp;#39;ve had all the weird meteors</text>
  <text start="1486.88" dur="6.81">go down over America over Canada</text>
  <text start="1490.03" dur="6.36">multiple places and odd occurrences</text>
  <text start="1493.69" dur="4.59">going on with these meteors so-called</text>
  <text start="1496.39" dur="4.56">meteors that have been coming down and</text>
  <text start="1498.28" dur="4.77">not only that but a couple months ago I</text>
  <text start="1500.95" dur="5.04">mentioned that I did a video on space</text>
  <text start="1503.05" dur="5.22">Wars that had a legal complaint filed</text>
  <text start="1505.99" dur="4.71">against it but in that video I was</text>
  <text start="1508.27" dur="4.32">discussing weird flashes going on around</text>
  <text start="1510.7" dur="4.89">America as well they were going on over</text>
  <text start="1512.59" dur="5.1">New York over a few days I mean flashes</text>
  <text start="1515.59" dur="6.02">meteors or just weird things that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1517.69" dur="6.69">seeing but then Newsweek few days ago</text>
  <text start="1521.61" dur="7.56">talking about space Wars trying to again</text>
  <text start="1524.38" dur="11.91">looks like they&amp;#39;re fueling the us-russia</text>
  <text start="1529.17" dur="10.33">dead horse the that fear fear porn there</text>
  <text start="1536.29" dur="5.85">but uh the Russian Foreign Minister</text>
  <text start="1539.5" dur="5.16">Lavrov was accusing the United States of</text>
  <text start="1542.14" dur="5.7">harboring dangerous hopes to develop and</text>
  <text start="1544.66" dur="6.81">place weapons in space now of course on</text>
  <text start="1547.84" dur="5.85">a deeper level the u.s. already has</text>
  <text start="1551.47" dur="4.59">weapons in space there you have all</text>
  <text start="1553.69" dur="4.32">kinds of craft and there&amp;#39;s multiple</text>
  <text start="1556.06" dur="3.6">programs that they have with craft in</text>
  <text start="1558.01" dur="4.86">space there&amp;#39;s different programs the</text>
  <text start="1559.66" dur="6.39">Navy has different programs that the Air</text>
  <text start="1562.87" dur="5.51">Force and CIA have so manyy behind the</text>
  <text start="1566.05" dur="4.23">scenes space Wars going on but</text>
  <text start="1568.38" dur="3.94">interesting interesting that Russia</text>
  <text start="1570.28" dur="5.46">would be calling the u.s. out on that</text>
  <text start="1572.32" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s actually good thing and that Russia</text>
  <text start="1575.74" dur="5.61">would or what I want to say your</text>
  <text start="1578.17" dur="7.74">Newsweek would be reporting on it and</text>
  <text start="1581.35" dur="6.48">then last thing just for some points I</text>
  <text start="1585.91" dur="4.53">want to make sophisticated technology</text>
  <text start="1587.83" dur="7.02">unearthed beneath ancient Greek pyramid</text>
  <text start="1590.44" dur="5.19">and all this shows you is that human</text>
  <text start="1594.85" dur="4.829">civilization</text>
  <text start="1595.63" dur="7.07">is much much older than we&amp;#39;re told far</text>
  <text start="1599.679" dur="7.591">older than we&amp;#39;re told and there have</text>
  <text start="1602.7" dur="7.63">likely been civilizations before ours</text>
  <text start="1607.27" dur="4.95">that were very advanced but advanced in</text>
  <text start="1610.33" dur="3.5">different ways they had different kinds</text>
  <text start="1612.22" dur="3.47">of technology they understood</text>
  <text start="1613.83" dur="7.66">technologies of consciousness</text>
  <text start="1615.69" dur="9.489">technologies of vibration and using the</text>
  <text start="1621.49" dur="5.61">what I want to say using crystals high</text>
  <text start="1625.179" dur="4.801">vibratory crystals can do some amazing</text>
  <text start="1627.1" dur="4.68">things and especially kinematics the</text>
  <text start="1629.98" dur="4.62">science of crime addicts with that so</text>
  <text start="1631.78" dur="5.43">anyway this is just some mainstream</text>
  <text start="1634.6" dur="4.47">admittance of that a Greek a Greek</text>
  <text start="1637.21" dur="5.55">pyramid had some ancient technology</text>
  <text start="1639.07" dur="9.83">unearthed under it and this just goes to</text>
  <text start="1642.76" dur="11.1">show you that mainstream history is BS</text>
  <text start="1648.9" dur="5.889">from what they say and yeah just some</text>
  <text start="1653.86" dur="2.67">point someone to make on that one so</text>
  <text start="1654.789" dur="6.031">anyway that&amp;#39;s it for this one guys</text>
  <text start="1656.53" dur="5.61">thanks for tuning in and I hope I went</text>
  <text start="1660.82" dur="3.9">through all that well there&amp;#39;s some very</text>
  <text start="1662.14" dur="5.73">complex things I wanted to discuss in</text>
  <text start="1664.72" dur="5.88">this one but again I will post a bunch</text>
  <text start="1667.87" dur="6.14">of these down below oh it&amp;#39;s pronounced</text>
  <text start="1670.6" dur="5.91">cymatics excuse me somatic schematics</text>
  <text start="1674.01" dur="4.93">yeah we all pronounce things different</text>
  <text start="1676.51" dur="4.44">ways right words are just words are just</text>
  <text start="1678.94" dur="5.4">vibrations they&amp;#39;re just vibratory</text>
  <text start="1680.95" dur="5.49">symbols that we all say we all say them</text>
  <text start="1684.34" dur="5.66">in different ways anyway check the links</text>
