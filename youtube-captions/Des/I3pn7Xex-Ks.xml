  <text start="52.19" dur="6.369">day beforehand Alex Jones turns at 180</text>
  <text start="55.739" dur="5.101">right now the first thought I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="5.49">okay controlled opposition okay the day</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="5.04">before the protests and I always thought</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="3.631">Alex Jones honestly to be controlled</text>
  <text start="65.88" dur="4.98">opposition and it&amp;#39;s very funny because</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="6.63">his I remember back in 2011 this was the</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="5.28">very first thing that really spurred my</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="3.809">whole awakening process and that was</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="4.229">coming across his documentary called the</text>
  <text start="78.119" dur="3.841">fall of the Republic and this is an Alex</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="3.481">Jones documentary I came across I</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="4.409">remember the day and once I saw this</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="5.46">documentary it just absolutely blew my</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="5.341">mind and opened me up to the real world</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.98">you could say now I didn&amp;#39;t really like</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="4.26">who Alex Jones was and the way he</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="3.119">presented information just really rubbed</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="3.96">me the wrong way like it does a lot of</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="4.951">people so I didn&amp;#39;t really delve too much</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="4.11">into him I I you know went down a lot of</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="4.17">other rabbit holes in and research</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="5.64">different things and I came across a lot</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="4.65">of information that then showed me Alex</text>
  <text start="109.68" dur="3.149">Jones well there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff that</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="3.36">Alex Jones isn&amp;#39;t saying and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="3.54">lot of weird things he is saying so I</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="5.66">quickly found him to be controlled</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="6.93">opposition maybe this is the case maybe</text>
  <text start="120.2" dur="4.989">he is simply saying these specific</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="4.11">things the day before the protest to</text>
  <text start="125.189" dur="3.6">give everybody a laugh off about it</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="3.3">right there&amp;#39;s always been that</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="3.571">COINTELPRO side of things there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="2.731">been that controlled opposition that the</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="3.06">Cabal have</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="5.94">I&amp;#39;ve placed Alex Jones in this picture</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="6.21">but when the pizza gate stuff started</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="3.72">happening and Alex Jones really started</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="3.48">going off about the whole human</text>
  <text start="143.1" dur="3.87">trafficking issue and pedophilia side of</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="3.48">things I actually began to scratch my</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="3.27">head and this was like four or five</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="3.39">months ago I&amp;#39;m like wow you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="3.33">actually kind of liking a lot of what</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="3.63">Alex Jones the saying about these things</text>
  <text start="153.57" dur="4.38">and I began to think like maybe he</text>
  <text start="155.61" dur="3.81">actually maybe he&amp;#39;s delving away from</text>
  <text start="157.95" dur="3.24">that whole controlled opposition side of</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="3.66">things maybe he&amp;#39;s trying to set things</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="4.08">right who knows but I loved what he was</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="3.87">saying he even had Robert David Steele</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="3.99">lawn talking about the pedophilia issue</text>
  <text start="166.95" dur="4.29">and I believe Alex Jones was talking</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="4.26">about what they call like the disruptive</text>
  <text start="171.24" dur="4.05">technology now I think that&amp;#39;s a nice bud</text>
  <text start="173.52" dur="3.69">buzzword for it but basically all the</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="4.17">zero-point stuff all the all the black</text>
  <text start="177.21" dur="5.46">project technology classified patent</text>
  <text start="179.46" dur="5.28">Tesla stuff now he began talking about</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="3.78">all this and I&amp;#39;m like badass Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="184.74" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;d love to hear what you&amp;#39;re saying so</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="4.44">honestly on one end this could totally</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="4.92">be controlled opposition stuff that Alex</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="4.47">Jones is pulling but in regards to</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="4.02">everything he&amp;#39;s really been saying the</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="4.59">past four or five months I could totally</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="4.89">see this being just a hey this dude was</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="4.08">probably sued into submission said that</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="3.42">he was gonna be bent over a table if he</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="5.16">didn&amp;#39;t submit to James</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="5.64">Alif antis and what their legal crew so</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="3.69">I think honestly at this stage of the</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="3.87">game enough people are waking up to the</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="4.59">point where if Alex Jones says this</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="3.57">things it doesn&amp;#39;t even matter in the</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="2.73">long run it&amp;#39;s already written in the</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="3.24">stars to a point people are not going to</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="3.539">shut up about this issue and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.97" dur="4.29">beginning to see protests like the</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="4.891">protest tomorrow about it and a lot of</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="3.57">people starting to say things and this</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="3.15">can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t put a lid on this</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="4.05">boiling water folks so don&amp;#39;t even worry</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="4.92">about the alex jones thing dude might be</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="6.78">controlled opposition my guess he might</text>
  <text start="236.7" dur="5.64">be but he&amp;#39;s probably threatened as many</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="3.93">people who are who are asked to go quiet</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="4.17">but so many people are waking up they</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="3.93">can&amp;#39;t threaten us all so we&amp;#39;ll see where</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.56">this takes us and we&amp;#39;ll see hopefully</text>
  <text start="248.52" dur="4.95">everything is safe at those protests</text>
