  <text start="0.03" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s up guys it is February 7th here</text>
  <text start="3.659" dur="3.87">and I want to say thank you for anybody</text>
  <text start="5.49" dur="4.56">commenting and supporting these videos</text>
  <text start="7.529" dur="3.78">and sharing them you guys are awesome so</text>
  <text start="10.05" dur="3.03">I&amp;#39;m kind of putting myself out there</text>
  <text start="11.309" dur="4.08">being another try to be another voice in</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="4.65">this true thing alternative media</text>
  <text start="15.389" dur="4.711">movement and in this video I want to</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="5.789">discuss something that has interested me</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="5.49">for a long time and that is frequency</text>
  <text start="23.519" dur="3.121">right Nikola Tesla said when trying to</text>
  <text start="25.59" dur="3.06">understand the secrets of the universe</text>
  <text start="26.64" dur="5.579">think in terms of vibration and</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="6.21">frequency so it&amp;#39;s often said that you</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="4.441">know the frequency of the solar system</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="3.42">or the planet or what&amp;#39;s going on here is</text>
  <text start="36.66" dur="4.05">increasing right we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="7.049">increasing in vibration but what exactly</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="6.689">does that mean right it&amp;#39;s kind of a very</text>
  <text start="45.329" dur="4.291">grand very loaded concept there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="47.399" dur="4.471">that could be said about it one specific</text>
  <text start="49.62" dur="5.369">thing that could be said about it that</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="5.279">has been scientifically measured in one</text>
  <text start="54.989" dur="4.441">ways that you can connect the dots to</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="4.23">exactly how our frequency is increasing</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="6.14">is looking at what&amp;#39;s called the Schumann</text>
  <text start="61.379" dur="6.691">resonance and how that how that</text>
  <text start="65.57" dur="5.32">corresponds with our brainwaves the</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="5.64">little frequencies of our gray matter in</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="4.799">our heads now what the Schumann</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="3.93">resonance is right I&amp;#39;ve seen this topic</text>
  <text start="75.689" dur="3.211">kind of everywhere lately so I really</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="3.54">want to connect these dots because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="5.67">super interesting the Schumann resonance</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="6.45">is essentially the Earth&amp;#39;s heartbeat</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="6.479">that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s been called it is peaks</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="6.09">in the extremely low frequencies of the</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="4.741">Earth&amp;#39;s electromagnetic spectrum and it</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="4.289">occurs because of lightning activity</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="4.11">between the Earth&amp;#39;s surface and its</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="3.991">ionosphere right I don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="5.91">specific physics behind that but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102" dur="7.77">what causes it and this frequency has</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="7.019">been a steady about seven point eight</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="5.43">three Hertz ever since it was measured</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="6.301">and it was discovered this this</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="6.239">essentially you know this this frequency</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="6">this heartbeat per se was discovered in</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="6.03">1952 by a man named Wilfred Schumann I</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="3.359">believe I don&amp;#39;t know Winfred Schumann</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s name was Schumann Schumann</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="4.771">resonance and that&amp;#39;s why it was it was</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="3.301">discovered then I should say and they</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="4.64">fifty-two and ever since then it has</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="6.57">been a steady seven point eight three</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="6.52">now interestingly enough you know crazy</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="9.09">enough within the past about four years</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="8.94">it&amp;#39;s been increasing and some space</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="6.6">observers in Russia I believe in</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="6.81">observed it increasing to as high as 14</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="7.35">to 16 Hertz on some days over the past</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="6.409">few years and lately just over the you</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.589">know very recently in the past few</text>
  <text start="166.579" dur="4.69">months or so it has gone even higher</text>
  <text start="169.379" dur="5.28">than that it&amp;#39;s been spiking anywhere</text>
  <text start="171.269" dur="6.421">from between thirty to forty Hertz on</text>
  <text start="174.659" dur="5.91">different days and remember that</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="4.62">remember those numbers right seven point</text>
  <text start="180.569" dur="4.411">eight three it&amp;#39;s steadily been at</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="4.649">spiking to sixteen or in the past couple</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="4.95">years and then up to thirty or forty</text>
  <text start="186.959" dur="6.691">right very interesting I&amp;#39;ll tie that in</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="5.91">soon now what I want to talk about is</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="4.709">our brain waves right as the law of</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="4.41">Correspondence says as above so below so</text>
  <text start="198.359" dur="3.96">on a grand scale we discussed the earth</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="5.639">now we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss our individual</text>
  <text start="202.319" dur="6.091">heads and our brains have actually been</text>
  <text start="205.889" dur="4.71">shown to work within different</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="5.31">frequencies and like I said these are</text>
  <text start="210.599" dur="5.551">known as brain waves right so your brain</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="6.599">waves will range anywhere from zero</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="6.149">hurts hurts hurts is just a rapid how</text>
  <text start="220.319" dur="3.901">many repetitions per second so zero</text>
  <text start="222.299" dur="5.55">repetitions zero Hertz</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="5.4">all the way up to about forty an</text>
  <text start="227.849" dur="4.561">interesting number I think I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="4.739">that recently so it&amp;#39;ll range anywhere</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="5.1">from there and these are the ranges</text>
  <text start="234.359" dur="5.34">right from zero to four that is your</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="5.339">Delta range that is associated with a</text>
  <text start="239.699" dur="5.91">deep deep sleep basically heavy REM</text>
  <text start="242.849" dur="4.5">sleep or somewhat of a like a</text>
  <text start="245.609" dur="3.451">Transcendental Meditation where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.349" dur="3.75">not even in your conscious mind you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="4.44">in that super conscious mind you&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="251.099" dur="4.2">know you&amp;#39;re not even you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="5.01">even functioning in this reality at that</text>
  <text start="255.299" dur="7.471">point above Delta from four to eight</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="5.85">Hertz is theta range theta is associated</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="4.35">with kind of a light meditation or a</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="6">kind of a groggy state</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="5.34">and it&amp;#39;s kind of where we it&amp;#39;s been said</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s where we hold trauma that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="272.46" dur="6.98">our brains will resonate at when we are</text>
  <text start="276.48" dur="5.79">holding a lot of internal tension and</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="5.92">very interesting I&amp;#39;ll discuss that a</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="4.47">minute now from 8 to 14 Hertz this is</text>
  <text start="285.36" dur="5.01">the alpha wave these are kind of the</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="5.55">most known the most notable waves is the</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="4.5">Alpha because that&amp;#39;s associated with an</text>
  <text start="292.29" dur="4.26">alertness a focused state a waking</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="3.63">consciousness right when we kind of wake</text>
  <text start="296.55" dur="3.15">up we&amp;#39;re going about our day middle of</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="3.419">the day that&amp;#39;s kind of our alpha waves</text>
  <text start="299.7" dur="4.86">when we&amp;#39;re focused and alert but also</text>
  <text start="301.919" dur="5.701">relaxed right so a lot of supplements</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="5.46">like GABA and adaptogenic herbs and</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="5.34">things like that will help promote alpha</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="4.68">waves in our brain green tea has an</text>
  <text start="312.96" dur="3.81">amino acid called l-theanine which helps</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="4.41">promote these alpha waves which is why</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="5.46">green teas is used for focus things like</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="5.34">that and then above alpha we have the</text>
  <text start="322.23" dur="2.88">gamma range this is this ranges no no</text>
  <text start="324.45" dur="3.75">excuse me</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="5.52">beta so from 14 to 40 Hertz right we</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="5.76">went we went Delta theta alpha now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="5.43">at beta from 14 to 40 Hertz beta is</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="3.6">associated with a fast activity right</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s kind of a normal waking state you</text>
  <text start="337.56" dur="4.05">you drink your coffee you&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="339.54" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re kind of you&amp;#39;re ready you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="4.41">but you might be at the tip of anxiety</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="4.47">right this is where faster processing</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="4.98">takes place but it&amp;#39;s also where so much</text>
  <text start="348.54" dur="5.01">processing occurs where you might start</text>
  <text start="351" dur="5.46">to get a nervousness about you and then</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="6.03">above beta we have gamma gamma waves</text>
  <text start="356.46" dur="5.67">those are 40 and up and recent research</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="4.26">these were kind of never understood but</text>
  <text start="362.13" dur="4.32">recent research has shown that gamma</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="4.71">waves are associated with simultaneous</text>
  <text start="366.45" dur="3.75">information processing a call across</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="4.32">different parts of our brains that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="5.25">normally connect gamma is associated</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="4.89">with bursts of insight and and higher</text>
  <text start="375.45" dur="5.43">super conscious states</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="5.88">I shouldn&amp;#39;t say super conscious because</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="6.81">I said that with the Delta ranges but I</text>
  <text start="383.64" dur="6.06">want to say information download per se</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="4.229">right so you&amp;#39;re connecting into that</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="5.85">into that your universal mind and able</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="5.401">to download those insights now let&amp;#39;s tie</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="4.44">all that in together we have the</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="2.95">Schumann frequency that was at seven</text>
  <text start="399.99" dur="2.29">point</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="5.4">three Hertz then up to 16 that up to 40</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="6.99">then we have our ranges of brainwaves</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="5.19">right Delta Theta alpha beta gamma where</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="3.75">was that seven point eight three Hertz</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="3.84">well remember that&amp;#39;s like a high theta</text>
  <text start="413.02" dur="4.95">range that&amp;#39;s a low alpha that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="414.7" dur="5.88">the earth was in training us to it for a</text>
  <text start="417.97" dur="4.02">long time this was remember where I said</text>
  <text start="420.58" dur="3.48">where that&amp;#39;s where you hold trauma</text>
  <text start="421.99" dur="5.61">that&amp;#39;s kind of a groggy state this is</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="6.33">that illusion this is that veil that</text>
  <text start="427.6" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;ve been in right the the Earth&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.39" dur="6.75">frequency has literally been holding us</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="6.66">in a state of illusion but now with you</text>
  <text start="437.14" dur="3.33">know the reasoning can all be discussed</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="3.54">whether it&amp;#39;s alignments whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="4.26">cosmic alignments I should say or</text>
  <text start="442.48" dur="4.29">whatever the reasoning is the earth is</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="4.74">raising that the earth has raised it</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="5.04">from 16 Hertz which is associated</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="4.65">remember with beta waves which is a a</text>
  <text start="451.81" dur="2.64">fast activity of the brain in recent</text>
  <text start="454.12" dur="3.81">years</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="7.29">all the way up to the gamma range in</text>
  <text start="457.93" dur="7.68">sites remember that so the literal</text>
  <text start="461.74" dur="7.35">Earth&amp;#39;s frequencies are increasing and</text>
  <text start="465.61" dur="6.36">our brains could be in training in such</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="4.5">itself - it entrainment remember this</text>
  <text start="471.97" dur="7.74">entrainment is the process of</text>
  <text start="473.59" dur="8.28">synchronization of a lot of pieces you</text>
  <text start="479.71" dur="4.02">know we have the earth as a grater and</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="7.35">all of our brains are in training itself</text>
  <text start="483.73" dur="7.44">to this greater external rhythm so you</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="3.75">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s super interesting and I</text>
  <text start="491.17" dur="3.27">wanted to tie I wanted to explain this</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="3.18">the Schumann resonance and how that ties</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="4.92">into our brain waves because this is</text>
  <text start="496.15" dur="6.32">this is a very important concept in</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="5.31">understanding what exactly it means that</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="4.42">frequencies are raising and how that</text>
  <text start="504.67" dur="6.03">affects our consciousness extremely</text>
  <text start="506.89" dur="7.32">interesting right so so we&amp;#39;re literally</text>
  <text start="510.7" dur="4.86">as a whole as a collective not only</text>
  <text start="514.21" dur="3.35">individually is our consciousness</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="5.16">raising as our frequencies in our brains</text>
  <text start="517.56" dur="6.46">our pineal glands are opening up but</text>
  <text start="520.72" dur="6.69">collectively we are as well so you know</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="4.59">whether and this is super interesting to</text>
  <text start="527.41" dur="5.43">know I&amp;#39;m just kind of going to go off a</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="5.43">tangent here is it the earth frequency</text>
  <text start="532.84" dur="3.39">raising causing our brain</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="7.67">to increase in consciousness and raise</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="8.82">their frequencies or or or or is it our</text>
  <text start="541.71" dur="6.06">collective co-creative consciousness due</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="6.18">to all of our consciousness expansion</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="5.65">causing the earth to shift and which</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="3.57">which way is that streak going so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="3.3">just gonna say that you know I want you</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="6.15">to ponder those thoughts is it the earth</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="6.42">affecting us or is our collective powers</text>
  <text start="560.95" dur="5.22">so great that we are literally affecting</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="4.56">the earth and the cosmos with it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="3.12">know sounds like a neat concept to</text>
  <text start="567.7" dur="3.03">ponder think of that when you&amp;#39;re driving</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="3.48">in your car and you&amp;#39;re sure you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="3.78">the shower tomorrow anyway I hope you</text>
  <text start="572.77" dur="3.65">enjoyed that video Schumann resonance</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="5.28">how it ties into our brain waves and the</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="6.39">increase of frequency that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="3.02">everywhere boosts</text>
