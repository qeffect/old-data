  <text start="2.07" dur="4.289">bring out the shadows within us to deal</text>
  <text start="4.14" dur="5.97">with both collectively and individually</text>
  <text start="6.359" dur="6.57">as above so below and people are going</text>
  <text start="10.11" dur="4.59">nuts right now because they&amp;#39;re waking up</text>
  <text start="12.929" dur="4.521">and they don&amp;#39;t know how to dance with</text>
  <text start="14.7" dur="2.75">their shadows yet</text>
  <text start="21.82" dur="5.67">I think you can see as well as I can</text>
  <text start="24.43" dur="5.36">that as time is moving along things are</text>
  <text start="27.49" dur="5.76">getting crazier and crazier and more</text>
  <text start="29.79" dur="6.42">turbulent within our society this point</text>
  <text start="33.25" dur="6">of the Great Awakening ascension</text>
  <text start="36.21" dur="5.32">revelations the quantum shift in human</text>
  <text start="39.25" dur="4.199">consciousness call this time what you</text>

  <text start="45.699" dur="9.061">rainbows the Great Awakening is chaotic</text>
  <text start="50.699" dur="9.43">its turbulent what&amp;#39;s going on right now</text>
  <text start="54.76" dur="7.439">is all of this that&amp;#39;s been shoved</text>
  <text start="60.129" dur="4.591">into the collective unconscious for</text>
  <text start="62.199" dur="5.34">generations all this stuff that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="64.72" dur="5.009">pushed into our shadows that people</text>
  <text start="67.539" dur="5.301">don&amp;#39;t want to deal with it&amp;#39;s all coming</text>
  <text start="69.729" dur="6.39">up at this point right now to deal with</text>
  <text start="72.84" dur="4.99">because of how many freaking people</text>
  <text start="76.119" dur="3.81">there are on this planet and the fact</text>
  <text start="77.83" dur="4.23">that we have the Internet connecting us</text>
  <text start="79.929" dur="7.161">allowing for the spread of information</text>
  <text start="82.06" dur="8.669">like never before this is the time of</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="4.54">true transparency you can&amp;#39;t hide things</text>
  <text start="90.729" dur="2.971">anymore</text>
  <text start="91.63" dur="4.559">politicians obviously can&amp;#39;t hide much</text>
  <text start="93.7" dur="4.98">and even you even in our individual</text>
  <text start="96.189" dur="4.29">lives we can&amp;#39;t hide things either no</text>
  <text start="98.68" dur="3.27">matter whether it&amp;#39;s from your boyfriend</text>
  <text start="100.479" dur="5.311">or girlfriend or from your boss your</text>
  <text start="101.95" dur="7.62">business partner if you&amp;#39;re trying to act</text>
  <text start="105.79" dur="6.63">a fool if you&amp;#39;re trying to lie and be</text>
  <text start="109.57" dur="9.39">deceitful it&amp;#39;s gonna be very easy to</text>
  <text start="112.42" dur="8.01">sniff out and right now you know as all</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="3.72">these shadows are coming to the surface</text>
  <text start="120.43" dur="5.85">as they&amp;#39;re being forced to be dealt with</text>
  <text start="122.68" dur="5.43">because of just the pure transparency</text>
  <text start="126.28" dur="6.929">that we individually and collectively</text>
  <text start="128.11" dur="6.51">are forced to have it&amp;#39;s making a lot of</text>
  <text start="133.209" dur="2.731">people uncomfortable because they just</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="4.619">don&amp;#39;t know how to dance with their</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="6.29">shadows yet they don&amp;#39;t know how to go</text>
  <text start="139.239" dur="5.821">about developing their own inner</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="4.9">spiritual strengths you see it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="145.06" dur="3.239">just a physical change going on right</text>
  <text start="147.13" dur="2.97">now there&amp;#39;s a lot of physical changes</text>
  <text start="148.299" dur="3.601">going on with our planet with our bodies</text>
  <text start="150.1" dur="4.83">even with our DNA but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="3.77">emotional changes you know when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="2.18">finding out what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="4.02">going on in the world and what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="6.93">been going on with your life and the</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="7.71">fact that you are the sole proprietor</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;re the sole cause of all the not</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="3.51">just happy moments in your knife but</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="3.269">strife in your moments once you find</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="3.69">that self responsibility</text>
  <text start="171.989" dur="4.111">boom emotional changes physical</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="3.03">emotional and of course we have</text>
  <text start="176.1" dur="3.62">spiritual changes going on a lot of</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="4.92">people understanding that this is a full</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="5.65">spiritual reset we have going on we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="6.84">undoing thousands of years of</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="8">programming and figuring out how to</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="8.75">stand on our own two feet after that and</text>
  <text start="193.37" dur="7.69">you can see through all of this</text>
  <text start="198.14" dur="6.58">rebirthing that we&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s tough</text>
  <text start="201.06" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s difficult this is not a job for</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="4.46">boys or girls</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="5.46">this is a job for true men and women</text>
  <text start="209.18" dur="6.55">true people who want to mature up who</text>
  <text start="212.25" dur="5.94">want to be leaders who want to be</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="5.879">sovereign human beings that can stand</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="5.16">and think and be for themselves so this</text>
  <text start="221.609" dur="3.361">is not easy and as you can tell a lot of</text>
  <text start="223.35" dur="3.78">people are having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="4.35">with it and what you need to understand</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="5.97">is that for these people that are having</text>
  <text start="229.32" dur="6.389">a difficult time whether they are maybe</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="4.68">not as far along on the path maybe</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="4.111">they&amp;#39;re completely still caught up with</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="3.6">the establishment system completely</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="3">brainwashed maybe they are a little</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="3.9">farther along on the path maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="242.82" dur="4.58">starting to see the way certain things</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="6.989">work they&amp;#39;re becoming a little more</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="5.8">awoken but there&amp;#39;s still a lot of anger</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="4.351">there&amp;#39;s still a lot of resentment</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="6.3">there&amp;#39;s still a lot of internal tension</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="4.23">within them what we need to have for all</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="4.4">of these people who are having a</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="4.86">difficult time is compassion is</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="3.16">understanding because we&amp;#39;ve all been</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="4.829">there and we&amp;#39;re all going to go through</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="5.64">this I went through my first stages of</text>
  <text start="270.539" dur="4.921">this whole awakening process four five</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="5.85">six years ago and that was a trip let me</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="4.829">tell you it caused me to spiritually</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="3.15">grow a whole hell of a lot cuz I had to</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="3.481">do a lot of that stuff on my own I</text>
  <text start="281.7" dur="3.839">didn&amp;#39;t have really anybody to connect</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="4.07">with in person or on the internet with</text>
  <text start="285.539" dur="4.13">that so I had to do it myself</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="4.49">now of course I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="5.071">it&amp;#39;s a never-ending process I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="4.059">going through my shadows even now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="4.889">just going through different ones and</text>
  <text start="296.389" dur="5.61">I&amp;#39;ve learned to dance with I&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="299.629" dur="4.56">to or as Joseph Campbell would say eat</text>
  <text start="301.999" dur="5.521">those particular shadows that came out</text>
  <text start="304.189" dur="4.771">in me four five six years ago and like I</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="5.429">said we&amp;#39;re all at different stages on</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="5.789">this path some people are just beginning</text>
  <text start="312.949" dur="6.27">some people are more advanced but we all</text>
  <text start="314.749" dur="6.211">have those shadows and we all are</text>
  <text start="319.219" dur="4.681">learning how to deal with it how to</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="6.69">become better human beings and by you</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="5.43">making fun of somebody who isn&amp;#39;t as far</text>
  <text start="327.65" dur="5.37">along on the path as you as it as</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="5.459">enlightened as you does that really mean</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="3.66">you&amp;#39;re woke does that really mean you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.789" dur="5.011">more spiritually advanced does that mean</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re a superior human a better human</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="5.85">because you&amp;#39;re making fun of the normies</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="6.96">or you&amp;#39;re making fun of this guy or that</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="7.829">guy for having all this pent-up rage in</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="6.989">them having emotional outbursts not</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="3.69">necessarily so I guess that&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="355.849" dur="4.861">point in this video that I wanted to</text>
  <text start="357.169" dur="7.47">make I see a lot of people just all up</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="6.78">in their heads lately all all this pain</text>
  <text start="364.639" dur="6.12">all this pain is coming out of them and</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="5.37">it it I&amp;#39;m very empathetic I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="370.759" dur="4.59">intuitive it hurts me to see all this</text>
  <text start="372.86" dur="4.289">pain come out in other people so the</text>
  <text start="375.349" dur="3.69">best thing I can do is just make videos</text>
  <text start="377.149" dur="4.17">and write on the internet and try to</text>
  <text start="379.039" dur="6">help them with it try to help you with</text>
  <text start="381.319" dur="8.22">it because I myself have been going</text>

  <text start="389.539" dur="2.91">pain I understand what it&amp;#39;s like and I</text>
  <text start="391.399" dur="3.75">understand what it&amp;#39;s like to come out of</text>
  <text start="392.449" dur="5.511">it and I just want to see people go</text>
  <text start="395.149" dur="5.971">through it as easy as possible but still</text>
  <text start="397.96" dur="4.9">get that transformation not avoid it not</text>
  <text start="401.12" dur="4.109">avoid it that just makes things worst we</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="5.669">try to resist when you resist all of</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="6.571">this coming up it causes more tension so</text>
  <text start="408.529" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t resist understand that we all go</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="4.829">through this process you meet everybody</text>
  <text start="413.719" dur="6.92">out there and we need to have compassion</text>
