  <text start="11.88" dur="4.8">what I want to do in this video is throw</text>
  <text start="14.58" dur="5.34">a whole bunch of information out there</text>
  <text start="16.68" dur="6.15">by answering the question what I would</text>
  <text start="19.92" dur="5.25">do if I had cancer and the inspiration</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="6.029">for this video comes from none other</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="5.73">than a man named Jason Kristoff who if</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="5.101">you don&amp;#39;t follow him on Facebook go do</text>
  <text start="30.9" dur="5.1">it because Jason Kristoff posts a ton of</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="4.83">good information about pretty much</text>
  <text start="36" dur="5.04">everything much like I try to do and one</text>
  <text start="38.79" dur="6.089">of the articles that he posted was</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="5.85">written on his website and he wrote the</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="5.971">steps he would take if he had cancer and</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="5.46">I&amp;#39;m basically taking that and putting my</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="3.18">own spin on it and putting it into a</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="4.349">video format so what I&amp;#39;m gonna do here</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="5.669">is give you six reasons or six things</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="5.551">that I would do if I found out that I</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="5.371">had cancer and first of all I would</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="4.83">watch the truth about cancer and study</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="4.71">Gerson&amp;#39;s therapy and the truth about</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="5.82">cancer is a nine part documentary series</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="6.51">that was made by ty Bollinger and it is</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="4.59">the best you can&amp;#39;t even call it a</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="3.39">documentary because it&amp;#39;s literally like</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="4.5">10 to 15 hours of just information being</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="3.979">thrown at you and it&amp;#39;s amazing so the</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="4.83">truth about cancer I would go watch that</text>
  <text start="83.659" dur="6.431">first thing second thing I would study</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="6.45">Gerson&amp;#39;s therapy the Gerson Therapy was</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="7.11">made by a man named dr. max Gerson who</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="6.93">was a world-renowned doctor in the early</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="4.89">to mid 1900s and he created what was</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="8.37">called the Gerson Therapy Gerson Therapy</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="8.94">and it was a purely food and juice based</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="4.979">diet so it was a completely whole food</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="6.449">based diet with various detoxification</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="7.801">protocols that had a fantastic success</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="6.18">rate and helping people reverse and deal</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="4.619">with their cancers so the reason I</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="6.96">specifically like the Gerson Therapy so</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="6.301">much is because his understanding of not</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="3.591">only human nutrition in the human body</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="6.11">but</text>
  <text start="134.21" dur="6.49">soil itself and ecosystem health is</text>
  <text start="138.38" dur="4.36">awesome and its really it gives you a</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="4.14">whole holistic understanding of not only</text>
  <text start="142.74" dur="3.39">human but earth health because you know</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="2.82">as above so below if we don&amp;#39;t take care</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="4.11">of our bodies we&amp;#39;re not gonna take care</text>
  <text start="147.66" dur="5.1">of the earth so that&amp;#39;s why I liked dr.</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="5.75">max Gerson theories fantastic go study</text>
  <text start="152.76" dur="10.02">them okay what I&amp;#39;m gonna do is actually</text>

  <text start="166.74" dur="4.32">on the Gerson Therapy it&amp;#39;s called dying</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="3.51">to have known it was made about ten</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="3.69">years ago and this documentary was made</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="3.72">by a researcher who just traveled the</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="4.68">country interviewing people who have</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="5.64">done Gerson Therapy and interviewing</text>

  <text start="234.42" dur="3.78">two things on dr. max Gerson Therapy so</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="3.599">that&amp;#39;s the first thing I would do and</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="4.44">that is the first thing I would do</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="5.461">because and I want to specify this</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="5.34">because a lot of people get I think</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="5.49">personally a lot of people get curing</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="6.36">cancer misconstrued in their</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="5.609">perspectives because I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="4.26">there is one chemical compound that you</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="3.481">can call it cure for cancer no matter</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="3.09">what it is you know I don&amp;#39;t think you</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="3.66">can call cannabis cure for cancer you</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t call apricot kernels or vitamin</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="3.57">b17 a cure for cancer you cannot call</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="4.85">hydrogen peroxide</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="8.04">cure for cancer because cancer has a</text>
  <text start="270.98" dur="6.25">holistic approach to it right there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="3.51">lot of different things that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.23" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;re all doing to our bodies that are</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="3.06">causing cancer to perform a lot of</text>
  <text start="280.2" dur="4.2">toxins in our bodies and in our</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="3.93">environment there&amp;#39;s a lot of problems</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="2.82">we&amp;#39;re having with our diets you know</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re gonna get to that a little later</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="5.04">down this list but so there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="5.67">things going wrong and if you Bank</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;re curing of cancer on one specific</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="4.08">chemical compound even if it&amp;#39;s natural</text>
  <text start="296.88" dur="4.11">even if the FDA hates it you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="4.02">still gonna have cancer or it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="4.05">come back even if it regresses because</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s so many other things going on in</text>
  <text start="305.04" dur="3.15">your lifestyle whether it&amp;#39;s your thought</text>
  <text start="306.51" dur="4.83">processes and your mindset whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.19" dur="4.2">your environment where you live you know</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="3.42">around a bunch of electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="312.39" dur="5.13">radiation whether it&amp;#39;s your diet or your</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="6.03">lifestyle what have you right so the</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="5.94">reason I suggest these things first is</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="5.28">because I always say the cure for cancer</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="4.74">is consciousness is understanding it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="4.02">understanding what&amp;#39;s gonna work best for</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="3.48">you what you&amp;#39;re doing in your life</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s fostering the growth of cancer</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="4.11">and you know there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="4.92">other things so information is the most</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="5.04">crucial thing and these two things the</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="5.16">truth about cancer and dr. max Gerson</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="5.37">--zz ideologies are hands down in my</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="3.51">opinion the best things the best forms</text>
  <text start="346.2" dur="4.74">of consciousness that you can boost</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="5.1">yourself with to handle cancer so number</text>
  <text start="350.94" dur="3.36">one do those things number two actually</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="3.87">even if you don&amp;#39;t have cancer do those</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.97">things anyway my suggestion number two</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.97">sighs the tumor and resist the whole cut</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="5.73">poison burn medical system that we have</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="5.55">so you do want to go into doctors to get</text>
  <text start="366" dur="5.28">the tumor sized and get scans done</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="6.54">absolutely right and this is a big also</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="5.31">another thing where people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="4.41">necessarily critically think in my</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="5.33">opinion is that when they say you know</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="5.4">oh you know the medical system sucks</text>
  <text start="381.92" dur="6.91">people think the whole medical system</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="6.15">sucks but when it comes to advances in</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="4.17">modern medicine there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="390.54" dur="4.62">that absolutely help us emergency</text>
  <text start="393" dur="4.98">medicine fantastic we need that right</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="4.47">when it comes to getting MRIs and cat</text>
  <text start="397.98" dur="3.059">scans and things like that done to see</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="4.259">what&amp;#39;s going on internally</text>
  <text start="401.039" dur="4.981">fantastic do that but it&amp;#39;s not when you</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="5.911">start getting into the procedures is</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="6.03">when the whole of modern</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="5.639">Rockefeller based medicine starts to</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="7.649">come into play so sighs the tumor right</text>
  <text start="415.439" dur="6.81">and if it&amp;#39;s well if it&amp;#39;s causing pain</text>
  <text start="419.699" dur="4.981">and pressing on organs or it is of</text>
  <text start="422.249" dur="6.69">detriment to your physical body then I</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="7.379">may say that getting it surgically</text>
  <text start="428.939" dur="5.671">removed would be beneficial but in most</text>
  <text start="432.059" dur="4.41">cases I would not say that getting it</text>
  <text start="434.61" dur="3.75">cut out is beneficial and obviously</text>
  <text start="436.469" dur="5.34">getting it poisoned out by chemotherapy</text>
  <text start="438.36" dur="5.22">or burned out by radiation is not</text>
  <text start="441.809" dur="5.04">beneficial and not what you want to do</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="6.329">now in regards to the cut thing before</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="4.62">we move on I have had personal</text>
  <text start="449.909" dur="5.611">experience I&amp;#39;ve just personally</text>
  <text start="451.469" dur="6.66">witnessed this a woman with stage four</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="4.619">cancer who doctors literally told her if</text>
  <text start="458.129" dur="5.4">we don&amp;#39;t cut your ovaries out you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.139" dur="4.23">gonna die within months she got her</text>
  <text start="463.529" dur="5.01">tumor sized</text>
  <text start="464.369" dur="5.901">and resisted the cut of the cut poison</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="4.44">burn she actually resisted all three and</text>
  <text start="470.27" dur="7.06">she did the Gerson Therapy with some</text>
  <text start="472.979" dur="6.03">other things and she got rid of her</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="3.629">cancer you know I was direct witness to</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="5.76">this so that&amp;#39;s why I say in most cases</text>
  <text start="480.959" dur="6.151">cutting is not necessary only if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.769" dur="5.27">in pain or you know there&amp;#39;s some kind of</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="5.489">physical reason in which you need to but</text>
  <text start="490.039" dur="6.48">not necessary now number two number</text>
  <text start="492.599" dur="6.981">three apply a highly alkalized and</text>
  <text start="496.519" dur="6.64">oxygenated diet plus juicing and</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="5.799">appropriate supplements so this is very</text>
  <text start="503.159" dur="5.01">if you research Gerson&amp;#39;s therapies it</text>
  <text start="505.379" dur="5.611">kind of go hand goes hand in hand with</text>
  <text start="508.169" dur="4.8">the alkalizing and oxygenation diets</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="4.289">basically what this is there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="3">juicing recipes you can find from the</text>
  <text start="515.279" dur="2.99">Gerson Therapy</text>
  <text start="515.969" dur="4.771">you can find in this book here but</text>
  <text start="518.269" dur="5.05">pretty much everybody that starts to</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="4.469">begin to study natural health in regards</text>
  <text start="523.319" dur="4.051">to cancer knows this but I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="525.209" dur="4.801">reiterating it you know dr. otto warburg</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="6.18">won the Nobel Prize in the 30s for</text>
  <text start="530.01" dur="4.35">finding that when cancer thrives that</text>
  <text start="533.55" dur="3.029">goes hand in</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="5.28">and with an acidic environment so if we</text>
  <text start="536.579" dur="8.01">keep our bodies more alkaline cancer</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="6.99">thus will not grow will not spread so</text>
  <text start="544.589" dur="4.051">highly alkalizing greens a lot of</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="5.1">chlorophyll a lot of oxygenation in your</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="4.77">diet also we&amp;#39;ll get into the holistic</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="3.75">principle lifestyle principles down here</text>
  <text start="553.41" dur="4.29">but breathing just getting oxygen into</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="4.65">your body period not only through diet</text>
  <text start="557.7" dur="5.46">but through breathing will help and then</text>
  <text start="560.13" dur="5.16">juicing juicing remember when you juice</text>
  <text start="563.16" dur="4.83">you want to make sure it&amp;#39;s organic</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="4.32">because if you juice non-organic foods</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re also gonna concentrate the</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="7.02">pesticides along with the nutrients so</text>
  <text start="571.98" dur="6.72">make it organic and make your juices you</text>
  <text start="576.63" dur="2.94">want to get a very high quality juicer</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="2.639">you want to get what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="4.32">masticating juicer instead of a</text>
  <text start="581.339" dur="4.141">centrifugal juicer centrifugal juicers</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="4.35">you can find at most stores they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.48" dur="5.039">usually pretty cheap under 100 250 bucks</text>
  <text start="588.24" dur="4.89">but they spin really fast and because</text>
  <text start="590.519" dur="4.471">they spin so fast at a high rpm that can</text>
  <text start="593.13" dur="4.11">break down the enzyme content and</text>
  <text start="594.99" dur="4.14">antioxidants in the juice or in the food</text>
  <text start="597.24" dur="4.289">that you&amp;#39;re juicing so you want to get a</text>
  <text start="599.13" dur="5.94">slower rpm that&amp;#39;s what I have I have an</text>

  <text start="610.829" dur="5.041">nutrients in the food so I will link the</text>
  <text start="613.32" dur="4.41">Omega juicer that I use also down below</text>

  <text start="619.68" dur="4.95">bucks but I&amp;#39;ve had this thing literally</text>
  <text start="622.019" dur="4.771">for about five years it&amp;#39;s not broken on</text>
  <text start="624.63" dur="5.13">me at all no issues with it and I use it</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="4.26">constantly fantastic stuff so the</text>
  <text start="629.76" dur="3.87">money&amp;#39;s worth it trust me</text>
  <text start="631.05" dur="4.2">and then appropriate supplements and I</text>
  <text start="633.63" dur="4.5">just want to plug in a couple things</text>
  <text start="635.25" dur="5.519">down here as well two supplements that I</text>
  <text start="638.13" dur="7.62">would highly suggest that would be great</text>
  <text start="640.769" dur="8.161">for alkalizing the body and really</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="5.519">priming your immune system one is a</text>
  <text start="648.93" dur="4.769">supplement called elite green protein by</text>

  <text start="655.26" dur="2.759">hands-down</text>
  <text start="655.709" dur="5.791">and these technically aren&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="658.019" dur="6.271">supplements they&amp;#39;re whole foods that are</text>
  <text start="661.5" dur="4.829">just in a like in a little container</text>
  <text start="664.29" dur="3.94">that you would call a supplement so the</text>
  <text start="666.329" dur="4.751">elite green protein by health force</text>
  <text start="668.23" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s a blend of spirulina and chlorella</text>

  <text start="673.78" dur="2.94">you could literally put in your body</text>
  <text start="674.92" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s some of the highest chlorophyll</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="5.55">content foods on the planet and so that</text>
  <text start="679.18" dur="4.98">means high alkalinity and chlorella is</text>
  <text start="682.27" dur="4.2">also very detoxifying there&amp;#39;s a ton of</text>
  <text start="684.16" dur="5.31">antioxidants in them so look into that I</text>
  <text start="686.47" dur="5.25">won&amp;#39;t get too far into it here I take it</text>
  <text start="689.47" dur="4.98">all the time and then turkey tail</text>

  <text start="699.04" dur="4.26">make you see pretty colors but medicinal</text>
  <text start="701.23" dur="3.48">mushrooms specifically are some of the</text>
  <text start="703.3" dur="3.12">best things on a planet to help</text>
  <text start="704.71" dur="5.19">strengthen the human immune system and</text>
  <text start="706.42" dur="5.64">our body we share so much DNA with</text>
  <text start="709.9" dur="4.23">mushrooms which is why our bodies are so</text>
  <text start="712.06" dur="4.92">accepting to the constituents in them</text>
  <text start="714.13" dur="4.77">when it comes to herbs and plants humans</text>
  <text start="716.98" dur="3.81">only share less than about 1 percent of</text>
  <text start="718.9" dur="5.94">our DNA with plants but we share between</text>
  <text start="720.79" dur="6.9">30 and 50% of our DNA with the with</text>
  <text start="724.84" dur="4.02">mushrooms which is why a lot of science</text>
  <text start="727.69" dur="3.3">some scientists even think we should</text>
  <text start="728.86" dur="4.35">merge the animal and fungi kingdom</text>
  <text start="730.99" dur="5.55">because they share so much DNA but</text>
  <text start="733.21" dur="6.33">because our bodies are so accepting of</text>
  <text start="736.54" dur="5.4">them they strengthen our bodies so well</text>
  <text start="739.54" dur="4.8">and pretty much all medicinal mushrooms</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="2.91">strengthen our immune systems but turkey</text>
  <text start="744.34" dur="3.51">tail</text>
  <text start="744.85" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s called turkey tail I forget the</text>

  <text start="766.75" dur="3.21">like the world renowned mushroom</text>
  <text start="768.55" dur="3.39">researcher he&amp;#39;s the best mycologist on</text>
  <text start="769.96" dur="3.54">the planet and he was pretty close to me</text>
  <text start="771.94" dur="3.39">actually he lives like right down there</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="3.42">like 30 miles away from me it&amp;#39;s cool</text>
  <text start="775.33" dur="5.22">where he makes all these mushrooms but</text>
  <text start="776.92" dur="7.62">Paul Stamets did a TED talk where he</text>
  <text start="780.55" dur="6.36">discusses how he used turkey tail with</text>
  <text start="784.54" dur="4.05">his own mother who had stage 4 breast</text>
  <text start="786.91" dur="3.36">cancer so you can go check that out</text>
  <text start="788.59" dur="3.33">again do your own research do your own</text>
  <text start="790.27" dur="4.08">research with all this stuff I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="791.92" dur="4.53">dropping a lot of keywords in this but</text>
  <text start="794.35" dur="5.55">literally like go Google things you</text>
  <text start="796.45" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t know that I say and this would be</text>
  <text start="799.9" dur="2.13">a really interesting one to look into so</text>
  <text start="801.49" dur="3.27">you can</text>
  <text start="802.03" dur="4.98">watch his TED talk on that Paul Stamets</text>
  <text start="804.76" dur="4.98">great mind and that next we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="807.01" dur="5.85">to applying the proper holistic</text>
  <text start="809.74" dur="5.46">lifestyle principles and I wrote here</text>
  <text start="812.86" dur="4.58">what I call the fractal of health it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="815.2" dur="4.74">just something that I&amp;#39;m made up one day</text>
  <text start="817.44" dur="5.2">but that&amp;#39;s when you really want to</text>
  <text start="819.94" dur="7.29">balance your physical your mental and</text>
  <text start="822.64" dur="7.44">your spiritual self and all I mean I</text>
  <text start="827.23" dur="5.79">could literally talk about this for days</text>
  <text start="830.08" dur="7.71">which actually I will I&amp;#39;m planning on</text>
  <text start="833.02" dur="7.89">making a like video series on my</text>
  <text start="837.79" dur="6.99">thoughts on holistic health and holistic</text>
  <text start="840.91" dur="6.54">principles but basically you know think</text>
  <text start="844.78" dur="4.77">of the I did a video I think in the last</text>
  <text start="847.45" dur="4.08">few weeks on the six pillars of health</text>
  <text start="849.55" dur="5.25">you can just go reference that one where</text>
  <text start="851.53" dur="5.67">I give you a snapshot into my thoughts</text>
  <text start="854.8" dur="4.26">and all of that but you know balance</text>
  <text start="857.2" dur="4.14">your breathing balance your exercise</text>
  <text start="859.06" dur="4.02">your sleep habits your circadian rhythms</text>
  <text start="861.34" dur="3.42">right make sure you&amp;#39;re sleeping well</text>
  <text start="863.08" dur="3.21">make sure you&amp;#39;re away from the</text>
  <text start="864.76" dur="2.88">electromagnetic radiation make sure</text>
  <text start="866.29" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re getting your diet and gear make</text>
  <text start="867.64" dur="2.94">sure you&amp;#39;re getting your hydration in</text>
  <text start="869.44" dur="4.74">gear make sure you&amp;#39;re getting your</text>
  <text start="870.58" dur="5.94">thought processes balanced so there are</text>
  <text start="874.18" dur="4.95">so many different things you need to</text>
  <text start="876.52" dur="6.36">look at in regards to this but again</text>
  <text start="879.13" dur="7.68">like I mentioned up here cancer is the</text>
  <text start="882.88" dur="7.5">result of a dis ease your your your out</text>
  <text start="886.81" dur="4.53">of balance your out of you know dis ease</text>
  <text start="890.38" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s why I said it like that because</text>
  <text start="891.34" dur="5.19">your your at dis you&amp;#39;re not eased you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="894.28" dur="6.09">you&amp;#39;re having some imbalance somewhere</text>
  <text start="896.53" dur="6.63">so getting yourself back into balance is</text>
  <text start="900.37" dur="4.29">the most crucial thing if you&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="903.16" dur="3.84">job you hate that&amp;#39;s literally</text>
  <text start="904.66" dur="4.74">spiritually draining you or in a really</text>
  <text start="907" dur="5.04">in a relationship that&amp;#39;s spiritually</text>
  <text start="909.4" dur="5.58">draining you maybe that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="912.04" dur="5.58">things that&amp;#39;s leading to that cancer</text>
  <text start="914.98" dur="4.71">growth the most right a lot of people</text>
  <text start="917.62" dur="4.26">they think that cancer or I should say</text>
  <text start="919.69" dur="3.78">our Western medical system our Western</text>
  <text start="921.88" dur="5.25">education system these days tells us</text>
  <text start="923.47" dur="6.81">that cancer is genetic which is true but</text>
  <text start="927.13" dur="5.88">they don&amp;#39;t specify our genes getting out</text>
  <text start="930.28" dur="5.85">of balance is our own fault right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="933.01" dur="7.26">not some magic happenstance that</text>
  <text start="936.13" dur="6.48">just occurs we throw our genes out of</text>
  <text start="940.27" dur="4.02">functioning properly because of the</text>
  <text start="942.61" dur="3.84">toxins we put in our body and bad foods</text>
  <text start="944.29" dur="4.35">and our negative thought processes and</text>
  <text start="946.45" dur="6.33">getting spiritually drained in bad</text>
  <text start="948.64" dur="7.11">environments okay so this is epigenetics</text>
  <text start="952.78" dur="4.77">this is getting out of that victimized</text>
  <text start="955.75" dur="4.74">mindset with our genes and getting back</text>
  <text start="957.55" dur="5.19">into us having the power and having</text>
  <text start="960.49" dur="4.29">control of our our own destiny you know</text>
  <text start="962.74" dur="4.11">very possible it&amp;#39;s just requires a</text>
  <text start="964.78" dur="4.62">consciousness shift and that&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="966.85" dur="4.41">so apply the proper holistic lifestyle</text>
  <text start="969.4" dur="5.52">principles or get yourself out of shitty</text>
  <text start="971.26" dur="5.55">situations to help your genes begin</text>
  <text start="974.92" dur="4.8">functioning as they should again right</text>
  <text start="976.81" dur="4.86">to have the proper genetic expression as</text>
  <text start="979.72" dur="5.16">they call it so there&amp;#39;s that one</text>
  <text start="981.67" dur="5.4">and then next continue studying cancer</text>
  <text start="984.88" dur="5.67">Tudor calm this is one of my favourite</text>
  <text start="987.07" dur="5.88">websites I&amp;#39;ve ever found on alternative</text>
  <text start="990.55" dur="5.1">health week you call health truth about</text>
  <text start="992.95" dur="5.19">cancer which is cancer Tudor calm which</text>
  <text start="995.65" dur="4.05">you can find a lot of these things that</text>
  <text start="998.14" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;ve discussed earlier you can find</text>
  <text start="999.7" dur="3.6">articles on there about they have</text>
  <text start="1001.26" dur="5.36">articles about Gerson Therapy the truth</text>
  <text start="1003.3" dur="5.91">about cancer docu-series that I&amp;#39;ll link</text>
  <text start="1006.62" dur="4.48">has also been discussed on there so lots</text>
  <text start="1009.21" dur="3.66">of stuff go check that website out I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1011.1" dur="5.64">drop it down below and then lastly</text>
  <text start="1012.87" dur="7.79">inform yourself of vibrational therapies</text>
  <text start="1016.74" dur="7.5">and I have right here dr. royal rife is</text>
  <text start="1020.66" dur="6.039">probably the most romantic in regards to</text>
  <text start="1024.24" dur="5.07">vibrational therapies but remember as</text>
  <text start="1026.699" dur="4.111">nikola tesla said when trying to find</text>
  <text start="1029.31" dur="2.97">out the secrets of the universe think in</text>
  <text start="1030.81" dur="4.29">terms of energy frequency and vibration</text>
  <text start="1032.28" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s exactly what dr. royal rife did</text>
  <text start="1035.1" dur="6.06">and then in the 1920s and 30s and 40s he</text>
  <text start="1038.37" dur="5.07">was playing around with how frequency</text>
  <text start="1041.16" dur="5.01">targeted specific frequency could</text>
  <text start="1043.44" dur="5.1">annihilate viruses and cancer cells and</text>
  <text start="1046.17" dur="4.83">he played around with thousands of</text>
  <text start="1048.54" dur="5.61">different frequencies with each virus in</text>
  <text start="1051" dur="7.73">each form of cancer to find the one that</text>
  <text start="1054.15" dur="7.47">would destroy it and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="1058.73" dur="5.23">getting in and understanding this whole</text>
  <text start="1061.62" dur="6.45">process of us being being as a frequency</text>
  <text start="1063.96" dur="5.76">and getting into the ideas of killing</text>
  <text start="1068.07" dur="4.26">pathogens with frequent</text>
  <text start="1069.72" dur="5.699">it&amp;#39;s very possible so in again inform</text>
  <text start="1072.33" dur="4.949">yourself as I said the cure for cancer</text>
  <text start="1075.419" dur="5.041">is consciousness and understanding and</text>
  <text start="1077.279" dur="6.211">information inform yourself of dr. royal</text>
  <text start="1080.46" dur="5.52">rife his ideas and then again he was</text>
  <text start="1083.49" dur="4.74">another doctor that was finding out</text>
  <text start="1085.98" dur="6.449">what&amp;#39;s really going on and trying to</text>
  <text start="1088.23" dur="6.569">help people without expensive cut poison</text>
  <text start="1092.429" dur="4.62">burn therapies so the AMA and the FDA</text>
  <text start="1094.799" dur="4.86">did not like him as they did not like</text>
  <text start="1097.049" dur="5.931">dr. max Gerson so both of these guys</text>
  <text start="1099.659" dur="6.031">were pretty screwed by the American</text>
  <text start="1102.98" dur="4.059">medical mafia Association or the fraud</text>
  <text start="1105.69" dur="4.04">and death Administration as I call him</text>
  <text start="1107.039" dur="6.571">so inform yourself of dr. royal rife his</text>
  <text start="1109.73" dur="7.569">theories his story and much more about</text>
  <text start="1113.61" dur="5.97">the energetic nature of disease and how</text>
  <text start="1117.299" dur="2.791">you can handle it there so there you go</text>
  <text start="1119.58" dur="3.12">guys</text>
  <text start="1120.09" dur="4.53">there is six steps that I would take if</text>
  <text start="1122.7" dur="5.01">I personally found out that I had cancer</text>
  <text start="1124.62" dur="5.909">and even if you don&amp;#39;t have cancer this</text>
  <text start="1127.71" dur="5.61">information is just gold anyway because</text>
  <text start="1130.529" dur="4.86">you can pass this along to people who</text>
  <text start="1133.32" dur="4.229">you do know who might have just found</text>
  <text start="1135.389" dur="4.591">out that they have cancer and there&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="1139.98" dur="7.169">especially suffering because of disease</text>
  <text start="1142.83" dur="6.15">that is unnecessary so there you go guys</text>
  <text start="1147.149" dur="4.351">it&amp;#39;s all about just sharing information</text>
  <text start="1148.98" dur="4.62">sharing consciousness and getting rid of</text>
  <text start="1151.5" dur="4.58">that fear and getting rid of that</text>
