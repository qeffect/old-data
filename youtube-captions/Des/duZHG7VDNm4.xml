  <text start="25.619" dur="5.611">to quickly just go over the latest</text>
  <text start="28.16" dur="5.2">stories that are being peddled to us by</text>

  <text start="33.36" dur="5.76"> and offer you quick reasons as</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="6.36">to why they may or may not be</text>

  <text start="42.78" dur="5.97">very well referenced books and doing</text>
  <text start="45.75" dur="5.82">deep research for video series and all</text>

  <text start="107.549" dur="3.811">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about cancer really</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="5.96">quick hopefully I can give you some</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="7.23">better answers for cancer than these</text>
  <text start="115.52" dur="6.4">mainstream media mainstream science the</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="5.19">educators of us today give you so this</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="4.08">article this first one comes to us by</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="4.979">way of the Washington Post which</text>
  <text start="126" dur="6.209">remember the Washington Post was bought</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="5.011">by Amazon in 2013 with 600 million</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="4.261">dollars that the CI</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.94">they offer them so keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="6">while we read this article what it says</text>
  <text start="139.71" dur="4.71">is that an exciting new cancer treatment</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="5.13">has just been endorsed by the FDA and</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="5.46">apparently a couple days ago the fraud</text>
  <text start="147.6" dur="4.74">and death Administration as we so called</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="4.53">him enthusiastically endorsed a</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="5.37">first-of-its-kind cancer treatment that</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="5.81">uses patients revved up immune cells to</text>
  <text start="157.71" dur="6.18">fight the disease so apparently this</text>
  <text start="160.22" dur="7.69">magic new therapy that&amp;#39;s called the c8r</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="7.83">t-cell therapy genetically alters our</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="7.41">own immune system cells to fight cancer</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="6.48">with and what they did was they messed</text>
  <text start="175.32" dur="6.12">with immune cells they altered cells to</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="6.33">combat childhood leukemia very advanced</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="6.24">forms of leukemia that elsewise was not</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="5.31">responding to conventional cancer</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="5.06">treatments now let&amp;#39;s take a step back</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="5.43">really quick I want to discuss</text>
  <text start="192.74" dur="6.219">immunotherapy and my thoughts on that</text>
  <text start="195.27" dur="7.77">so immunotherapy right it&amp;#39;s been touted</text>
  <text start="198.959" dur="6.771">as this magic new model marvel of modern</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="5.04">medicine and even in this article a</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="5.86">panel member said it&amp;#39;s the most exciting</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="5.25">thing I&amp;#39;ve seen in my lifetime a panel</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="3.39">member or an oncologist at the</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="4.47">Nationwide Children&amp;#39;s Hospital in</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="5.19">Columbus Ohio here so it&amp;#39;s this magic</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="5.94">new marvel of modern medicine what I</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="8.19">think&amp;#39;s going on is that big pharma is</text>
  <text start="223.74" dur="8.93">trying to find ways to continue cancer</text>
  <text start="228.36" dur="7.44">patients on their created therapies</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="5.44">without getting them onto chemotherapy</text>
  <text start="235.8" dur="4.71">radiation and surgery okay so enough</text>
  <text start="238.11" dur="5.22">people are waking up to the perils of</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="6.33">the cut poison burn medical system of</text>
  <text start="243.33" dur="6.18">using toxic chemotherapy drugs and nasty</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="5.82">radiation that Big Pharma is offering</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="6.33">them a new solution touting it as being</text>
  <text start="252.66" dur="6.56">a magic new thing but what they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="6.389">do is make it very exclusive and very</text>
  <text start="259.22" dur="5.38">freakin expensive so in this article</text>
  <text start="262.229" dur="5.431">they say that to ensure safety of this</text>
  <text start="264.6" dur="5.91">new immunotherapy it&amp;#39;s only going to be</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="5.67">used at 30 to 35 clinics nationwide so</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="4.95">as you can see the FDA is monopolizing</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="4.77">the out of it so they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s very very exclusive so they can</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="4.59">jack up the absolute price of this stuff</text>
  <text start="280.17" dur="5.1">I bet you these therapies cost in the</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="5.22">hundreds of thousands of dollars so what</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="4.98">people are gonna think in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="287.91" dur="4.44">level nationwide they&amp;#39;re gonna think oh</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="4.5">wow you know if I have cancer I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="5.4">need this in new immunotherapy but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="6.09">gonna need some damn good insurance pay</text>
  <text start="297.75" dur="7.05">top premium for it or pay out the</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="4.74">ying-yang for this therapy right because</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="2.07">I don&amp;#39;t want chemo</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="3.3">I don&amp;#39;t want radiation those are nasty</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;m getting that so I&amp;#39;m gonna need this</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="5.91">new immunotherapy I&amp;#39;m gonna need to</text>
  <text start="311.73" dur="6.3">genetically alter myself to fight a</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="5.91">disease that is caused by genetic</text>
  <text start="318.03" dur="4.65">alterations scratch your head at that</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.49">one do you see how that flips around</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="5.46">there so that&amp;#39;s the basics behind</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="5.23">immunotherapy is that they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="4.59">this magic new thing to get people off</text>
  <text start="330.42" dur="7.08">the last one make it expensive make it</text>
  <text start="332.73" dur="10.86">exclusive and genetically alter you Wow</text>
  <text start="337.5" dur="10.41">okay but what about all of the other</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="6.18">therapies that we do very well no cures</text>
  <text start="347.91" dur="5.13">cancer and they cure cancer very well</text>
  <text start="349.77" dur="7.05">very efficiently but these cures for</text>
  <text start="353.04" dur="6.39">cancer do not make the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="356.82" dur="4.17">companies obviously their money the</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="3.87">pharmaceutical industry it&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="5.429">most profitable industries for the deep</text>
  <text start="363.3" dur="6.15">state or the owner the powers that be</text>
  <text start="366.419" dur="6.091">per se over a trillion dollars per year</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="7.469">via pharmaceutical medication worldwide</text>
  <text start="372.51" dur="6.39">alone massive cash crop there so these</text>
  <text start="376.919" dur="5.511">have all been suppressed throughout</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="6.57">history we have dr. max Gerson who was</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="5.68">curing cancer with just juice and Diet</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="6">based therapies 80 years ago in America</text>
  <text start="388.11" dur="4.74">here he was vilified and basically run</text>
  <text start="391.47" dur="4.08">out of business by the fraud and death</text>
  <text start="392.85" dur="5.189">administration dr. royal rife who was</text>

  <text start="403.439" dur="4.921">rifle as they&amp;#39;re called now Burzynski a</text>
  <text start="406.349" dur="5.72">dude who&amp;#39;s still alive I believe he was</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="6.179">in Texas carrying people with his</text>
  <text start="412.069" dur="4.27">antineoplaston therapies and then we</text>
  <text start="414.539" dur="4.291">have a bunch of other natural stuff we</text>
  <text start="416.339" dur="3.991">have vitamin b17 found in very high</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="4.259">amounts and apricot kernels and we have</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="4.949">the oxygen therapies like mms and food</text>
  <text start="423.089" dur="4.41">grade hydrogen peroxide so there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="425.279" dur="5.28">many things out there that can do</text>
  <text start="427.499" dur="5.551">wonders with cancer but they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="430.559" dur="5.66">you about any of those they just want</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="7.049">you on their expensive ass brand new</text>
  <text start="436.219" dur="7.56">immunotherapies and one last note about</text>
  <text start="440.099" dur="5.52">all of this stuff you know all of these</text>
  <text start="443.779" dur="5.61">therapies that have been suppressed</text>
  <text start="445.619" dur="7.95">they are immunotherapies okay</text>
  <text start="449.389" dur="8.351">immunotherapy right that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="453.569" dur="7.89">true health is is helping your own</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="5.549">genetics express itself better okay we</text>
  <text start="461.459" dur="5.13">have to kind of flip our mindset around</text>
  <text start="463.289" dur="7.85">when it comes to genetics and understand</text>
  <text start="466.589" dur="8.55">that genetics is a complete</text>
  <text start="471.139" dur="6.82">responsibility of us okay it&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="475.139" dur="7.05">whole idea of genetic victimization is</text>
  <text start="477.959" dur="6.81">at the root of the falseness and the</text>
  <text start="482.189" dur="5.37">lies of modern medicine when it comes to</text>
  <text start="484.769" dur="7.89">natural therapies the point in them is</text>
  <text start="487.559" dur="7.17">to make you detoxified and give you the</text>
  <text start="492.659" dur="4.17">nutrients and antioxidants that your</text>
  <text start="494.729" dur="4.98">bodies need to express your genetics</text>
  <text start="496.829" dur="5.07">better right you eat healthy food you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="508.529" dur="4.41">helping your own genetics express itself</text>
  <text start="510.389" dur="6.481">better to kill cancer even your thoughts</text>
  <text start="512.939" dur="5.671">as dr. bruce lipton is outlined help is</text>
  <text start="516.87" dur="4.109">a form of you immunotherapy and helps</text>
  <text start="518.61" dur="4.979">your genetics express better so we have</text>
  <text start="520.979" dur="6.001">to rephrase our thinking we have a lot</text>
  <text start="523.589" dur="6.81">of foundational theories we have to</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="5.279">unlearn and relearn with so you can give</text>
  <text start="530.399" dur="3.81">yourself immunotherapy through natural</text>

  <text start="545.999" dur="4.56">wanted to discuss with you guys with</text>
  <text start="547.649" dur="4.92">some ideas on immunotherapy and genetic</text>
  <text start="550.559" dur="3.96">victimization all that jazz and again</text>
