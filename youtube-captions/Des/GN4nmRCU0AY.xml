  <text start="112.989" dur="4.531">researcher POTUS retweeted him a few</text>
  <text start="115.36" dur="5.28">days ago and then he got queued for it</text>
  <text start="117.52" dur="6.29">well it wasn&amp;#39;t within a day or two that</text>
  <text start="120.64" dur="6.959">Twitter suspended his account suspended</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="6.19">incarcerated et he created another count</text>

  <text start="661.79" dur="6.24">running this story that an outbreak of</text>
  <text start="664.49" dur="4.74">Ebola was impeded or basically the</text>

  <text start="684.35" dur="5.85">Congo interesting thing about that just</text>
  <text start="688.1" dur="6.109">five days ago like a week ago</text>

  <text start="711.07" dur="4.73">you can just do your own dot connecting</text>
  <text start="714.2" dur="6.34">with that one</text>
  <text start="715.8" dur="7.469">and now moving on to UFOs so that video</text>
  <text start="720.54" dur="6.089">going around of that alleged UFO over</text>
  <text start="723.269" dur="5.97">Las Vegas is still going viral still</text>
  <text start="726.629" dur="5.46">making news and I&amp;#39;m still seeing people</text>
  <text start="729.239" dur="5.97">I think not really think about it</text>
  <text start="732.089" dur="5.73">properly so an article in The Daily Star</text>
  <text start="735.209" dur="6.6">has been going around and it claimed</text>
  <text start="737.819" dur="6.57">that the UFO in this video was seen</text>
  <text start="741.809" dur="5.101">flying a thousand miles an hour for 50</text>
  <text start="744.389" dur="5.25">miles and it was going on and on about</text>
  <text start="746.91" dur="3.719">this thing being real again I just</text>
  <text start="749.639" dur="3.12">mentioned this in a video a couple of</text>
  <text start="750.629" dur="5.76">days ago I don&amp;#39;t think this thing is a</text>
  <text start="752.759" dur="5.94">UFO at all and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="756.389" dur="4.95">evidence we have about this thing well</text>
  <text start="758.699" dur="5.401">number one you can just see the rhythmic</text>
  <text start="761.339" dur="5.46">flashing lights on that so number one</text>
  <text start="764.1" dur="4.979">piece of evidence showing us that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="766.799" dur="3.84">probably benign probably just a</text>
  <text start="769.079" dur="3.93">helicopter or something like that number</text>
  <text start="770.639" dur="4.92">two if you look at the video it clearly</text>
  <text start="773.009" dur="5.101">does not show this craft flying a</text>
  <text start="775.559" dur="6.481">thousand miles an hour for 50 miles 50</text>
  <text start="778.11" dur="6">miles away from the area of Vegas that</text>
  <text start="782.04" dur="4.38">this video was filmed would take you</text>
  <text start="784.11" dur="4.05">clear out of Nevada you&amp;#39;d be in like the</text>
  <text start="786.42" dur="4.259">Mojave Desert in California or something</text>
  <text start="788.16" dur="5.219">like that we&amp;#39;re out in Utah all right so</text>
  <text start="790.679" dur="5.431">you know that you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="793.379" dur="3.93">get a video of a craft that far away and</text>
  <text start="796.11" dur="3">not just that but it&amp;#39;s again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.309" dur="3.661">clearly not moving a thousand miles an</text>
  <text start="799.11" dur="4.409">hour it&amp;#39;s moving like a couple hundred</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="5.13">like a helicopter and not just that but</text>
  <text start="803.519" dur="4.35">somebody shared a photo a screen grab of</text>
  <text start="806.1" dur="5.25">this video with me where you could</text>
  <text start="807.869" dur="4.981">clearly see the tail of it so I know a</text>
  <text start="811.35" dur="3.359">lot of people out there they want it to</text>
  <text start="812.85" dur="3.979">be some alien craft or a pleadian</text>
  <text start="814.709" dur="4.56">mothership or something like that and</text>
  <text start="816.829" dur="4.63">you just gotta you just got to look at</text>
  <text start="819.269" dur="5.701">the evidence you just got a look at the</text>
  <text start="821.459" dur="5.73">raw evidence before you get all up in</text>
  <text start="824.97" dur="4.799">your head with what you want it to be</text>
  <text start="827.189" dur="5.88">and what you believe it to be but you</text>
  <text start="829.769" dur="5.341">know don&amp;#39;t always trust what your</text>
  <text start="833.069" dur="3.721">beliefs are cuz you might not be</text>
  <text start="835.11" dur="3.959">believing things based on raw evidence</text>
  <text start="836.79" dur="4.139">so anyway I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a UFO as</text>
  <text start="839.069" dur="4.89">much as I want it to be I don&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="840.929" dur="5.1">is and truly if a UFO is hovering for</text>
  <text start="843.959" dur="4.531">five minutes over a large urban sprawl</text>
  <text start="846.029" dur="3.721">like that we only get one video out of</text>
  <text start="848.49" dur="3.57">it where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="849.75" dur="5.55">the photos where&amp;#39;s the other videos no</text>
  <text start="852.06" dur="6.75">no I&amp;#39;m not buying it I&amp;#39;m not buying it</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="6.42">and then last thing is this is the</text>
  <text start="858.81" dur="4.92">one-year anniversary speaking of UFOs</text>
  <text start="861.72" dur="4.71">the one-year anniversary of the</text>
  <text start="863.73" dur="4.98">Washington Times releasing an article</text>
