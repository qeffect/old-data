  <text start="13.559" dur="4.171">use my cheesy whiteboard to describe</text>
  <text start="15.66" dur="3.209">with you a brand new project that was</text>
  <text start="17.73" dur="3.99">just announced that I&amp;#39;m extremely</text>
  <text start="18.869" dur="4.711">excited to be collaborating on and this</text>
  <text start="21.72" dur="4.11">project is called the case for a secret</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="4.38">space program and it was announced last</text>
  <text start="25.83" dur="4.47">weekend at the contact in the desert</text>
  <text start="27.96" dur="5.009">conference and this project is going to</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="5.64">be released at the MUFON symposium in</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="5.491">Las Vegas in July and what this is is</text>
  <text start="35.94" dur="5.49">that it&amp;#39;s a book it&amp;#39;s the first book in</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="6.119">a series of books that are going to in</text>
  <text start="41.43" dur="5.76">depth explain this right here the secret</text>
  <text start="44.579" dur="4.441">space programs and really build a case</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="4.65">for it the case for a secret space</text>
  <text start="49.02" dur="6.48">program in how different corporate</text>
  <text start="51.84" dur="6.149">contractors have obtained science kept a</text>
  <text start="55.5" dur="4.289">lot of very advanced science secret and</text>
  <text start="57.989" dur="4.881">actually built this technology out</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="8.431">behind the scenes so it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="62.87" dur="8.05">very intense very deep profound book and</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s a collaboration between these four</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="6.51">gentlemen dr. Rob wood dr. Michael Sala</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="6.39">Bill Tompkins and Corey Goode Linda</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="4.71">Moulton Howe might also get in a little</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="4.439">bit on this project and then I&amp;#39;m here to</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="4.65">really help just compile all this</text>
  <text start="84.479" dur="3.57">research together and tell a bunch of</text>
  <text start="86.79" dur="3.689">people about it so I&amp;#39;m telling you about</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="4.051">it right here and I&amp;#39;m going to go</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="3.811">through each one of these individuals</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="3.659">and kind of familiarize you with them if</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="3.03">you don&amp;#39;t know who they are and then</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="3.271">I&amp;#39;ll discuss with you a little bit more</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="4.68">about what we&amp;#39;ll be getting into in this</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="6.629">book and first and foremost we have dr.</text>
  <text start="102" dur="7.35">Rob wood on this project and he is an</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="7.651">awesome guy he&amp;#39;s been in the UFO realm</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="7.32">for years and years for decades and he</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="5.01">is a very brilliant mind he graduated</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="3.12">with a degree in aeronautical</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="3.72">engineering from the University of</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="4.38">Colorado and then he actually at the</text>
  <text start="122.04" dur="5.1">same time got a PhD in physics from</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="5.19">Cornell so this dude is smart and he</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="4.27">then went after he graduated went into</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="3.76">working at Douglas aerospace</text>
  <text start="131.41" dur="5.76">and he worked a double with Douglas</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="6.51">aerospace from 1950 to 1993 so he had 43</text>
  <text start="137.17" dur="4.95">years at one company which is a very</text>
  <text start="139.63" dur="5.13">rare thing these days and while he was</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="5.79">at Douglas he became very interested in</text>
  <text start="144.76" dur="5.43">the UFO phenomenon and then kind of by</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="5.76">happenstance one day you know he was</text>
  <text start="150.19" dur="5.73">making a joke to essentially his boss&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="5.16">boss about you know why don&amp;#39;t we study</text>
  <text start="155.92" dur="4.35">how UFOs work and then the VP of Douglas</text>
  <text start="158.83" dur="4.62">was like yeah you know that&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="160.27" dur="5.79">pretty good idea so dr. Bob wood was</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="4.95">then gifted essentially a five hundred</text>
  <text start="166.06" dur="5.46">thousand dollar contract and this was in</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="5.4">like 1970 dollars so this was quite a</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="4.26">big sum of money to study UFOs for a</text>
  <text start="173.8" dur="5.76">major aerospace company which is the</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="6.33">very rare thing now unfortunately due to</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="6">the compartmentalization and the secrecy</text>
  <text start="182.11" dur="5.22">around all of these different projects</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="4.26">and essentially the secret space program</text>
  <text start="187.33" dur="5.04">he really wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="189.82" dur="6.3">find out too much about the UFO subject</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="6.9">at the time in 1970 and now in hindsight</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="5.4">he sees why and you know after this he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.27" dur="4.71">researched much further into the subject</text>
  <text start="201.52" dur="4.32">and found a whole lot more out which is</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="3.63">fantastic because he&amp;#39;s going to bring a</text>
  <text start="205.84" dur="4.56">lot of that experience and that</text>
  <text start="207.61" dur="5.1">understanding to this project so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.4" dur="4.8">very good to have him here and during</text>
  <text start="212.71" dur="5.01">his time researching the UFO issue he</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="4.86">also became essentially a document</text>
  <text start="217.72" dur="5.52">authentication expert so many people</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="5.58">began going to dr. Bob to authenticate</text>
  <text start="223.24" dur="4.53">various UFO documents that they had so</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="4.89">he became very proficient at doing such</text>
  <text start="227.77" dur="5.28">so again it&amp;#39;s gonna be very great at</text>
  <text start="230.53" dur="4.8">having that expertise in on this project</text>
  <text start="233.05" dur="3.84">and then he&amp;#39;s also testified for the dr.</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.08">Steven Greer the disclosure project and</text>
  <text start="236.89" dur="6.45">at the citizens hearing for disclosure</text>
  <text start="239.41" dur="5.94">in Washington DC in 2013 so great mine</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="4.44">great mine to have here and then we have</text>
  <text start="245.35" dur="5.76">dr. Michael Saleh dr. Michael Saleh is</text>
  <text start="247.78" dur="5.82">the founder of Exopolitics Borg and he</text>
  <text start="251.11" dur="5.4">has done many many different conferences</text>
  <text start="253.6" dur="5.25">around the world he&amp;#39;s organized and both</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="5.31">participated in them and then he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="258.85" dur="4.68">a very prolific author if you go to his</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="3.27">XO politics org website</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="4.74">you can skin his articles and they are</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="5.31">fantastic journalistic articles where he</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="4.41">compiles great research and is very good</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="5.61">at tying everything in together and then</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="5.7">he&amp;#39;s also authored a few books and his</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="5.67">most recent two books are some of his</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="5.28">best ones in 2015 he released a book</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="4.47">called insider&amp;#39;s reveals secret space</text>
  <text start="283.66" dur="3.84">programs and ET alliances and then in</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="4.98">2017</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="5.73">his most recent book he just came out a</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="4.89">couple months ago it was entitled the US</text>
  <text start="293.23" dur="5.07">Navy&amp;#39;s secret space program and Nordic</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="3.81">extraterrestrial alliances so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="2.91">really funny about those two books is</text>
  <text start="299.83" dur="3.21">that they were actually written about</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="4.41">Bill Tompkins and Corey Goode</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="5.43">so dr. michael sala knows this subject</text>
  <text start="305.62" dur="4.47">very well he&amp;#39;s very versed on it so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.47" dur="4.05">also gonna be fantastic having him on</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="4.92">the project so we had two very good</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="4.92">writers in dr. bob wood and dr. michael</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="4.56">sala and then we have the testimony</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="4.4">these are the whistleblowers that are in</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="6.27">on the project that we&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="6.49">their testimony from and that is Bill</text>
  <text start="325.84" dur="8.07">Tompkins and Corey Goode bill Tompkins</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="8.13">he is 94 years old and he is basically</text>
  <text start="333.91" dur="4.62">grandfather disclosure here but he</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="5.28">originally worked in naval intelligence</text>
  <text start="338.53" dur="6">so right at the time of World War two he</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="5.94">was working in Navy Intel and his job</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="5.34">was to actually debrief despised the</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="4.56">Navy had embedded in the German</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="3.81">aerospace companies so this is more</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="3.42">history and a lot of stuff we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="3.57">getting into in this book but what Bill</text>
  <text start="355.66" dur="3.84">Tompkins essentially did is that he</text>
  <text start="357.25" dur="4.71">debriefed these spies and he learned</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="4.86">some very big secrets about what the</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="4.8">Germans were doing in their secret space</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="4.98">program so he took this science and this</text>
  <text start="366.76" dur="4.26">knowledge that he was gaining and then</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="4.77">he was actually delegating it to</text>
  <text start="371.02" dur="5.25">different compartments in the Navy and</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="4.559">various aerospace contractors to handle</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="5.82">this science now after his time in the</text>
  <text start="378.669" dur="5.071">Navy he also went to work at Douglas</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="2.85">aerospace so that&amp;#39;s a point we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="2.88">make in this book is it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="3.24">interesting that we had had two</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="3.96">gentlemen that worked at the same</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="4.29">company at the same time with zero</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="4.05">knowledge of each other so this is how</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="3.9">we will describe in depth how the</text>
  <text start="394.63" dur="3.84">compartmentalization works</text>
  <text start="396.37" dur="4.95">keep all this stuff secret it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="5.88">important point there and then he became</text>
  <text start="401.32" dur="7.52">a spacecraft designer so bilk Thompkins</text>
  <text start="404.35" dur="7.86">actually made very primitive designs of</text>
  <text start="408.84" dur="6.52">large spacecraft carriers and frigates</text>
  <text start="412.21" dur="6.51">for the Navy and this was in the 1950s</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="6.48">now this these designs were likely</text>
  <text start="418.72" dur="6.72">eventually built out in the 70s and 80s</text>
  <text start="421.84" dur="5.34">to then create what&amp;#39;s called the solar</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="3.66">warden faction of the secret space</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="4.2">program and that&amp;#39;s where Corey Goode</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="5.7">enters the picture because Corey Goode</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="6.509">has come out in recent years to offer</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="5.67">his testimony about how he allegedly</text>
  <text start="437.889" dur="4.291">participated in this solar Whorton</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="4.949">faction of the secret space program and</text>
  <text start="442.18" dur="5.519">he is a my lab which stands for military</text>
  <text start="445.419" dur="4.801">abduction so essentially what happened</text>
  <text start="447.699" dur="5.22">to Corey Goode is that he was brought</text>
  <text start="450.22" dur="5.669">into the SSP or the secret space program</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="7.891">black projects to participate in them</text>
  <text start="455.889" dur="6.541">under abduction training and then he now</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="3.45">within the last couple years he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="4.62">regaining a lot of the memories that</text>
  <text start="464.26" dur="5.76">he&amp;#39;s had from working in these projects</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="5.13">and it&amp;#39;s very rare thing because they</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="3.899">always wipe the memory of most people</text>
  <text start="472.18" dur="3.78">that participate in them but now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.919" dur="4.021">he&amp;#39;s one of the ones where that memory</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="3.81">wiping is failing with and he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="477.94" dur="4.44">able to regain a lot of his memories and</text>
  <text start="479.77" dur="5.429">he&amp;#39;s remembering actually serving on a</text>
  <text start="482.38" dur="5.759">research professional vessel in solar</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="4.711">warden so we have essentially two guys</text>
  <text start="488.139" dur="3.331">who worked at the same company at the</text>
  <text start="489.91" dur="4.17">same time with zero knowledge of each</text>
  <text start="491.47" dur="5.699">other and then two people where one</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="6.75">could have very well been serving on the</text>
  <text start="497.169" dur="6.271">spacecraft that one of them designed so</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different dots that</text>
  <text start="503.44" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re gonna be connecting in this book</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="4.86">here we&amp;#39;re gonna be discussing the LA</text>
  <text start="507.13" dur="6.45">air raid of 1942 we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="6.03">discussing the German origins of a</text>
  <text start="513.58" dur="3.99">secret space program how they obtained a</text>
  <text start="515.83" dur="5.43">lot of the secretive science will be</text>
  <text start="517.57" dur="6.17">discussing operation Highjump Operation</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="5.04">Paperclip Antarctica will be discussing</text>
  <text start="523.74" dur="5.05">the compartmentalization and the</text>
  <text start="526.3" dur="4.56">bifurcation of sea</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="4.32">face program projects even within our</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="4.44">own military how the Air Force kind of</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="3.81">went off when one direction with the</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="2.97">technology that they were researching</text>
  <text start="536.92" dur="2.97">and the Navy went off in the other</text>
  <text start="538.27" dur="4.2">direction and then we&amp;#39;re also going to</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="4.92">be discussing heavily how the corporate</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="4.64">influence has really surrounded the</text>
  <text start="544.81" dur="5.46">secret space program and how its how a</text>
  <text start="547.11" dur="5.89">lot of these projects in corporations</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="5.04">has really what&amp;#39;s allowed them to be</text>
  <text start="553" dur="4.02">built out because being in corporate</text>
  <text start="555.31" dur="6.24">contractors they&amp;#39;re shrouded in secrecy</text>
  <text start="557.02" dur="6.81">and there&amp;#39;s a huge story to be told</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="5.19">about how these projects have been kept</text>
  <text start="563.83" dur="5.55">secret what they have and then what</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;ve built out over the past few</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="4.26">decades so this book this first book the</text>
  <text start="572.2" dur="3.54">case for a secret space program is</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="5.16">really gonna deal with the origins of it</text>
  <text start="575.74" dur="6.03">all in the 1940s 50s 60s and then in</text>
  <text start="578.8" dur="5.82">next books and next works we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="5.64">getting into how it all was built out</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="5.37">into recent times so I&amp;#39;m very excited to</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="4.08">be presenting you guys all of these</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="4.26">awesome people that are gonna be working</text>
  <text start="591.49" dur="4.59">on this awesome project case for a</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="4.56">secret space program this book will be</text>
  <text start="596.08" dur="4.41">releasing in a couple months don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="598.81" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s gonna be an e-book for it as</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="3.96">well so all of you guys who can&amp;#39;t get a</text>
