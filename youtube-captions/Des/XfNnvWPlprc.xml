  <text start="9.719" dur="5.17">what&amp;#39;s going on guys July 5th and back</text>
  <text start="12.789" dur="4.621">to the lab again back with my whiteboard</text>
  <text start="14.889" dur="4.861">as many of you know I was gone for</text>
  <text start="17.41" dur="5.13">almost a week I was gone for five days</text>
  <text start="19.75" dur="5.31">at the ecity ranch so I wasn&amp;#39;t able to</text>
  <text start="22.54" dur="5.07">really catch up on much of the news as I</text>
  <text start="25.06" dur="4.17">was out there I didn&amp;#39;t have time hardly</text>
  <text start="27.61" dur="3.6">had internet for a couple days but a</text>
  <text start="29.23" dur="4.53">couple of the stories that I did notice</text>
  <text start="31.21" dur="5.13">while I was there I want to discuss in</text>
  <text start="33.76" dur="3.81">my first video back here and the first</text>
  <text start="36.34" dur="3.45">thing I want to discuss is this</text>
  <text start="37.57" dur="5.19">executive order that was just signed by</text>
  <text start="39.79" dur="5.85">President Trump a few days ago on June</text>
  <text start="42.76" dur="5.58">30th and that executive order was to</text>
  <text start="45.64" dur="6.54">reestablish the National Space Council</text>
  <text start="48.34" dur="8.54">now the National Space Council was first</text>
  <text start="52.18" dur="9.66">established by Bush senior in 1989 on</text>
  <text start="56.88" dur="8.589">April 20th but anyway it ran from 1989</text>
  <text start="61.84" dur="6.059">to 1993 quite interesting actually that</text>
  <text start="65.469" dur="5.07">it only ran the four years that Bush</text>
  <text start="67.899" dur="6.06">Senior was an office we&amp;#39;ll discuss that</text>
  <text start="70.539" dur="5.99">a little more later but this space</text>
  <text start="73.959" dur="7.44">council only ran for four years it was</text>
  <text start="76.529" dur="7.33">disestablished and was gone for about 25</text>
  <text start="81.399" dur="3.661">years now what President Trump has done</text>
  <text start="83.859" dur="4.65">is revived</text>
  <text start="85.06" dur="6.809">he&amp;#39;s reestablished it and this council</text>
  <text start="88.509" dur="7.621">is going to resume operations and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.869" dur="6">going to consist of quite a few people</text>
  <text start="96.13" dur="3.119">and I&amp;#39;m going to run through the list of</text>
  <text start="97.869" dur="3.721">a few of the people who are on this</text>
  <text start="99.249" dur="4.47">council so the Vice President is the</text>
  <text start="101.59" dur="4.349">chair so Mike Pence is the chair of this</text>
  <text start="103.719" dur="4.2">national space Council we have the</text>
  <text start="105.939" dur="4.051">Secretary of State the Secretary of</text>
  <text start="107.919" dur="3.98">Defense of Commerce Transportation</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="4.589">Secretary of Homeland Security the</text>
  <text start="111.899" dur="5.32">Director of National Intelligence is</text>
  <text start="114.579" dur="6.42">going to be on this and a few other</text>
  <text start="117.219" dur="8.88">folks now actually quite a few people</text>
  <text start="120.999" dur="7.35">now what occurred which that made me</text>
  <text start="126.099" dur="4.77">really wonder what this is all about is</text>
  <text start="128.349" dur="4.921">the things that were said during the</text>
  <text start="130.869" dur="3.641">president&amp;#39;s remarks on the speech so</text>
  <text start="133.27" dur="3.219">after he signed this</text>
  <text start="134.51" dur="5.25">president this executive order on June</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="6.291">30th he gave a speech and as I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="5.64">in other videos when the president gives</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="5.519">speeches you really need to listen</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="5.85">closely and you need to listen from a</text>
  <text start="148.299" dur="5.02">multi-dimensional perspective when</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="4.44">hearing what he says because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.319" dur="4.5">often little double entendres or some</text>
  <text start="155.69" dur="4.109">double speak in the things he says and I</text>
  <text start="157.819" dur="3.331">think there was quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="159.799" dur="3.961">doublespeak that was going on during</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="6.72">this executive order one of my favorite</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="7.08">parts of this was near the end and he</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="6.33">simply said that the human soul yearns</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="5.91">for discovery by unlocking the mysteries</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="6.06">of the universe we universe we unlock</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="5.04">the truths within ourselves our journey</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.129">into space will not only make us</text>
  <text start="181.79" dur="5.52">stronger more propa preposterous</text>
  <text start="184.389" dur="5.02">prosperous but will unite us behind</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="4.2">grand ambitions and bring us all closer</text>
  <text start="189.409" dur="4.5">together he kind of made his few</text>
  <text start="191.51" dur="4.8">chuckles and he said he hoped politics</text>
  <text start="193.909" dur="2.821">would be what does that obviously it</text>
  <text start="196.31" dur="3.66">wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="5.49">and he said well we&amp;#39;ll rely we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="7.56">to rely on space to bring us together</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="8.43">instead interesting and what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="207.53" dur="5.099">interesting is I have written here Buzz</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="3.959">Aldrin was there Buzz Aldrin was</text>
  <text start="212.629" dur="3.75">actually standing like two feet from the</text>
  <text start="214.609" dur="3.861">president right next to him when the</text>
  <text start="216.379" dur="5.491">president was giving this speech and</text>
  <text start="218.47" dur="5.44">this made quite a few headlines around</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="4.85">the mainstream media but Buzz Aldrin was</text>
  <text start="223.91" dur="5.25">making a lot of weird faces he was like</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="3.519">he was kind of looking senile and like</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="4.139">he had Parkinson&amp;#39;s up there or something</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="5.791">but Buzz Aldrin did not look happy in a</text>
  <text start="233.299" dur="8.34">few of those faces and what I want to</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="8.31">say here is that Buzz Aldrin in my</text>
  <text start="241.639" dur="7.621">opinion and what I&amp;#39;ve seen this dude do</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="8.28">I think he is essentially a front he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="6.149">facade much like NASA is a facade hiding</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="4.38">a lot of the secret space projects and</text>
  <text start="255.409" dur="5.19">making people believe that that&amp;#39;s all we</text>
  <text start="257" dur="8.93">have I think Buzz Aldrin has been a</text>
  <text start="260.599" dur="6.961">central figure in that facade in partial</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="4.709">disclosures instead of</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="5.76">full disclosure okay because Buzz Aldrin</text>
  <text start="270.639" dur="5.471">just a few years ago he was on c-span</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="5.13">talking about monoliths being on Mars</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="3.84">moon Phobos now you&amp;#39;re not gonna be able</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="4.5">to get on c-span and say these things</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="4.89">unless you&amp;#39;re allowed to Buzz Aldrin</text>
  <text start="282.95" dur="3.45">also walks around quite a bit with a</text>
  <text start="284.84" dur="4.91">shirt that says let&amp;#39;s get our ass to</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="5.88">Mars and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s very vocal in</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="5.98">pressing a lot of space disclosures</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="6.66">forward but I don&amp;#39;t think he is for that</text>
  <text start="295.73" dur="5.73">full disclosure right so for him to be</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="5.28">really uncomfortable when all this was</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="4.62">going on again here is just some</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="4.47">speculation that&amp;#39;s going on to my mind</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="4.68">but maybe that certain partial</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="4.59">disclosure narrative that a few of the</text>
  <text start="310.76" dur="4.44">power the powers-that-be really wanted</text>
  <text start="313.28" dur="3.48">to put out to hide the rest of their</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="3.84">crimes and hide the rest of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="6.29">on maybe that has been completely</text>
  <text start="319.04" dur="7.14">quashed maybe this executive order is a</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="6.67">step in the process of getting that full</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="4.709">disclosure out there and again the rest</text>
  <text start="329.72" dur="4.38">of the people that wanted that partial</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="5.191">disclosure they&amp;#39;re getting their their</text>
  <text start="334.1" dur="3.15">basically their cards are out of play</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not getting that anymore</text>
  <text start="337.25" dur="3.57">because the full truths come out of</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="6.3">humanity again that&amp;#39;s just a speculation</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="8.099">but also I mean this is the president is</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="5.49">setting this up so maybe the president</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="3.781">doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on right that</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="3.87">speculation I just mentioned is assuming</text>
  <text start="352.7" dur="3.12">the president knows what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="3.599">all these secret projects and has been</text>
  <text start="355.82" dur="4.26">read in on all of them but of course we</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="4.051">know the president is often not read in</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="4.11">on everything so maybe the president is</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="4.109">setting this all up to get more access</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="3.63">to what&amp;#39;s really going on in the secret</text>
  <text start="366.139" dur="4.561">space programs to bring that all out</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="5.909">okay either one of those speculations I</text>
  <text start="370.7" dur="4.589">think would really Buzz Aldrin Buzz</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="4.831">Aldrin wouldn&amp;#39;t be happy regardless of</text>
  <text start="375.289" dur="5.551">that but who knows right regardless of</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="5.1">what speculation may be the case I think</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="4.139">this is a pivotal step in bringing a lot</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="4.14">of these disclosures a lot of this</text>
  <text start="384.979" dur="5.101">information out so this was huge this is</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="6.36">big news setting up this national space</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="6.3">Council and next I want to get into this</text>
  <text start="394.16" dur="4.77">story right here which is which which</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="3.869">ties directly into a lot of the full</text>
  <text start="398.93" dur="3.989">versus partial</text>
  <text start="400.249" dur="7.02">Disclosure discussion that I was saying</text>
  <text start="402.919" dur="8.79">up here NASA denies running a Mars child</text>
  <text start="407.269" dur="5.85">slave colony okay this was a report that</text>
  <text start="411.709" dur="3.72">definitely circulated around the</text>
  <text start="413.119" dur="5.04">mainstream very heavily on June 30th and</text>
  <text start="415.429" dur="5.16">I primarily saw this on an article by</text>
  <text start="418.159" dur="4.38">the Daily Mail which got like twelve</text>
  <text start="420.589" dur="3.24">thousand shares hundreds of comments on</text>
  <text start="422.539" dur="4.02">this thing so this thing definitely went</text>
  <text start="423.829" dur="4.8">viral and the reason this story blew up</text>
  <text start="426.559" dur="4.5">this headline specifically is because</text>
  <text start="428.629" dur="5.31">Robert David Steele who I&amp;#39;ve interviewed</text>
  <text start="431.059" dur="6.42">on my channel who I think is a certified</text>
  <text start="433.939" dur="13.43">badass made comments on the Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="12.57">Show about his belief of there being a a</text>
  <text start="447.369" dur="5.14">secret space colony that could very well</text>
  <text start="450.049" dur="4.32">be on Mars now what happened is that the</text>
  <text start="452.509" dur="4.89">mainstream media caught wind of this and</text>
  <text start="454.369" dur="5.01">they ran with it and they put a bunch of</text>
  <text start="457.399" dur="4.02"> out there as they typically do</text>
  <text start="459.379" dur="3.93">they were saying you know this crazy</text>
  <text start="461.419" dur="4.08">conspiracy theorist was talking about</text>
  <text start="463.309" dur="4.83">child sex slaves on Mars and all this</text>
  <text start="465.499" dur="4.111">stuff but I actually have been in</text>
  <text start="468.139" dur="3.57">contact with Robert David Steele and I</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="4.679">want to specifically lay out to you guys</text>
  <text start="471.709" dur="4.08">what he told me he asked me what you can</text>
  <text start="474.289" dur="4.29">do for me is point out that I did not</text>
  <text start="475.789" dur="5.46">say child sex slave colonies on Mars I</text>
  <text start="478.579" dur="4.83">was focused solely on the common sense</text>
  <text start="481.249" dur="4.05">perspective from a government that can</text>
  <text start="483.409" dur="3.93">do anything that it wants in secret of</text>
  <text start="485.299" dur="3.99">launching children into space to</text>
  <text start="487.339" dur="5.16">colonize far off targets okay</text>
  <text start="489.289" dur="5.071">but what I want to say here before we</text>
  <text start="492.499" dur="5.25">get down into these bullet points is</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="6.029">that there are so many whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="497.749" dur="4.59">coming onto the woodwork saying that in</text>
  <text start="500.389" dur="6.18">fact humans have been on Mars and</text>
  <text start="502.339" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re very well likely is slave</text>
  <text start="506.569" dur="6.87">colonies on Mars already we have William</text>
  <text start="509.779" dur="6.06">Tompkins who has mentioned that actually</text>
  <text start="513.439" dur="4.2">the Nazis when they were developing the</text>
  <text start="515.839" dur="4.92">beginnings of a secret space program in</text>
  <text start="517.639" dur="4.59">the 30s and 40s had already sent groups</text>
  <text start="520.759" dur="4.231">of soldiers to Mars he was actually</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="4.501">discussing how when the Nazis sent one</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="3.42">of the the first mission to Mars crashed</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="4.729">and they lost a whole group of men there</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="5.74">and this was in the 1940s okay we have</text>
  <text start="531.459" dur="4.281">Randy Cramer come out and say that</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="3.93">was actually stationed on Mars as a</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="3.84">Marine we have of course Corey good</text>
  <text start="538.08" dur="3.9">coming out and a lot of other people</text>
  <text start="539.58" dur="4.65">coming out saying that yes in these</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="6.6">secret space programs we have been to</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="5.58">Mars okay bring it back in as Robert</text>
  <text start="548.58" dur="4.59">David Steele said that common-sense</text>
  <text start="549.81" dur="5.1">perspective there is plenty of research</text>
  <text start="553.17" dur="3.15">out there showing that the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="3.72">on our planet have had this technology</text>
  <text start="556.32" dur="6.24">have had electrogravitic anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="5.73">technology for 60 70 even 80 years and</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="3.84">we know there&amp;#39;s been trillions and</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="4.02">trillions and trillions of dollars that</text>
  <text start="566.4" dur="5.61">have been funneled into black projects</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="5.73">so it is of no stretch of the</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="2.79">imagination to say that yes humans are</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="3.9">on Mars</text>
  <text start="574.8" dur="7.17">okay back to these bullet points what</text>
  <text start="578.01" dur="6.15">Alex Jones then did just a couple days</text>
  <text start="581.97" dur="4.53">ago on July 3rd he actually came out and</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="5.7">kind of covered his ass on his show and</text>
  <text start="586.5" dur="4.77">was saying that I don&amp;#39;t believe in the</text>
  <text start="589.86" dur="3.09">alien topic cuz I think it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="591.27" dur="3.9">distraction he was specifically saying I</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t believe any of this child slave</text>
  <text start="595.17" dur="6.86">colony Mars stuff so in my mind I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="598.98" dur="5.76">either thinking that Alex Jones is</text>
  <text start="602.03" dur="5.32">either too to come out and say the</text>
  <text start="604.74" dur="5.97">truth or he&amp;#39;s just trying to cover his</text>
  <text start="607.35" dur="6.18">ass he doesn&amp;#39;t want to go quite off the</text>
  <text start="610.71" dur="6.57">deep end and say these things on his</text>
  <text start="613.53" dur="6.03">show so that was a very interesting</text>
  <text start="617.28" dur="4.56">development that I just saw this morning</text>
  <text start="619.56" dur="5.13">I simply think you know whether he</text>
  <text start="621.84" dur="4.44">doesn&amp;#39;t want to threaten the attacks</text>
  <text start="624.69" dur="3.24">character assassinations things like</text>
  <text start="626.28" dur="3.54">that for putting the deepest truths out</text>
  <text start="627.93" dur="4.26">there or you know - we&amp;#39;ll see or</text>
  <text start="629.82" dur="4.65">whatever whatever the case may be that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.19" dur="4.95">what Alex Jones then did and NASA of</text>
