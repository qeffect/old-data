  <text start="6.74" dur="6.609">yo good to be back good to be back home</text>
  <text start="11.28" dur="3.96">back into the laboratory here I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="13.349" dur="4.171">you guys have noticed that I&amp;#39;ve laid</text>
  <text start="15.24" dur="4.199">pretty low for the last week or so which</text>
  <text start="17.52" dur="3.66">you might not have been aware of is that</text>
  <text start="19.439" dur="4.321">I&amp;#39;ve been actually traveling up and down</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="4.769">the west coast working on producing a</text>
  <text start="23.76" dur="6">documentary that&amp;#39;s due to be released in</text>
  <text start="25.949" dur="5.521">very short time and while I was gone I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="29.76" dur="4.2">sure you&amp;#39;re aware of this part is that</text>
  <text start="31.47" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s been some craziness going on on</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="5.46">the internet some people are showing</text>
  <text start="36.69" dur="5.25">their true colors lots of controversy</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="4.709">going on within the queue topic which I</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="4.349">will definitely address a lot to talk</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="4.2">about regarding that but I won&amp;#39;t do so</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="2.731">in this video I&amp;#39;ll do that a little bit</text>
  <text start="48.329" dur="2.491">later today</text>
  <text start="49.02" dur="4.26">and what I want to particularly talk</text>
  <text start="50.82" dur="5.009">about right here is something a little</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="4.74">bit more philosophical in nature because</text>
  <text start="55.829" dur="3.66">I think it&amp;#39;ll help people hone their</text>
  <text start="58.02" dur="4.129">discernment skills and I want to talk</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="6.121">about authenticity</text>
  <text start="62.149" dur="6.911">now this particular point in human</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="6.119">history goes by many different names and</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="3.419">it&amp;#39;s been called these things by many</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="4.291">different groups</text>
  <text start="72.479" dur="6.061">it&amp;#39;s been called the Age of Aquarius the</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="6.54">Golden Age Age of Enlightenment the</text>
  <text start="78.54" dur="6.869">Great Awakening and this particular time</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="5.55">is not just talked about in you know new</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.85">agey circles it&amp;#39;s even talked about by</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.13">religious groups that call it</text>
  <text start="90.259" dur="5.771">revelations it&amp;#39;s times of Revelations</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="7.32">well what does that all exactly mean</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="8.85">what does revelation literally mean it</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="7.53">means to reveal to bring out that that</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="7.099">has been hidden to lift the veal and</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s going on right now</text>
  <text start="111.979" dur="5.92">because people are becoming more</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="5.43">connected than ever before and this is</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="4.351">because of many reasons one being is</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="3.84">because there&amp;#39;s so many people on this</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="3.45">planet that they&amp;#39;re forced to connect</text>
  <text start="124.11" dur="4.05">another being because of the internet</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="4.71">you know internet being a wonderful tool</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s bringing people together because</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="5.19">of these things there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="4.92">information being shared more than ever</text>
  <text start="135.6" dur="5.04">before there&amp;#39;s more experiences people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="3.9">actual experiences being able to get out</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="4.32">to influence the collective</text>
  <text start="142.29" dur="5.4">consciousness more data is being shared</text>
  <text start="144.96" dur="8.15">than ever before this is making people</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="7.61">more conscious more aware the</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="4.42">connectedness is making people more</text>
  <text start="155.3" dur="4.72">conscious and because of this because</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="4.8">people are becoming more aware literally</text>
  <text start="160.02" dur="3.81">of what&amp;#39;s going on with themselves and</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="6.06">their individual circles and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="7.32">going on on a worldwide scale this</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="7.25">awareness is fine-tuning people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="7.83"> detectors and with this</text>
  <text start="175.64" dur="5.71">fine-tuning of the detectors</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="4.74">people&amp;#39;s intuition that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="181.35" dur="7.02">getting much better at sensing out</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="7.08">what&amp;#39;s real and what&amp;#39;s not and I want to</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="4.08">discuss an example first before I get on</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="3.99">to talking about public figures on the</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="3.87">Internet but let&amp;#39;s relegate this to just</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="4.14">discussing personal relationships</text>
  <text start="196.32" dur="4.949">one-on-one relationship imagine you get</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="7.8">into a personal relationship with a boy</text>
  <text start="201.269" dur="6.871">or a girl and you know the more</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="3.96">connected you&amp;#39;re going to be in that</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="5.31">relationship the more aware that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="4.29">going to be of each other the more</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="4.77">difficult it&amp;#39;s going to be to be</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="9.78">deceitful and the easier it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="8.19">be to feel that something&amp;#39;s off to get a</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="4.53">ping in that intuition be like</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="6.81">something&amp;#39;s not right here I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="6.09">investigate and the same goes for public</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="4.739">figures on the Internet</text>
  <text start="235.38" dur="5.85">this basically one-on-one relationship</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="5.071">we&amp;#39;re making with people you choose to</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="4.319">click this video of this particular</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="5.6">person and you start connecting with</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="5.491">them or should I say connecting with the</text>
  <text start="248.63" dur="5.98">identity that they&amp;#39;re putting out on the</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="8.49">Internet you see and this is where it</text>
  <text start="254.61" dur="7.379">gets a little tricky because when public</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="4.319">figures like myself or whoever else has</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="5.411">a blog or a YouTube channel or whatnot</text>
  <text start="263.849" dur="6.511">puts themselves online it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="5.97">really themselves is it it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="5.44">identity of them it&amp;#39;s a particular</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="4.2">character or its you know whatever the</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="3.989">case is call it what you want it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="277.57" dur="4.17">enigma of that individual that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="7.981">putting out and then they&amp;#39;re putting out</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="9.6">information along with that so what</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="6.179">needs to be done is of course if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.34" dur="4.59">going to start a blog or start a YouTube</text>
  <text start="293.949" dur="5.581">channel or something that effect is be</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="8.4">of course authentic the more authentic</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="6.81">that you are the more people are going</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="4.95">to be able to connect with you and of</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="4.549">course they&amp;#39;ll find out that you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="4.259">full of</text>
  <text start="310.889" dur="5.891">right so if you&amp;#39;re putting out that</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="4.831">identity of yourself and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="3.66">authentic of course people are going to</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="3.359">be able to sniff that out and because of</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="2.759">the internet because of this connection</text>
  <text start="321.729" dur="4.831">because of how where people are becoming</text>
  <text start="323.199" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re getting very good at that so the</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="4.35">particular mindset that I have had since</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="6.57">day one in starting this YouTube channel</text>
  <text start="330.91" dur="6.93">is to be as authentic as possible of</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="4.26">course authentic to a point that won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="337.84" dur="3.359">you know I&amp;#39;ll share as much as I can</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="5.13">about myself and who I am and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="341.199" dur="6.301">doing up until a point that it might of</text>
  <text start="344.71" dur="3.959">course bridge operational security or</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="4.289">something that effect need to keep</text>
  <text start="348.669" dur="5.701">myself safe but I have no problem</text>
  <text start="351.789" dur="6.66">sharing where I&amp;#39;ve come from what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="6.329">done how I support myself what my</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="4.53">interests are what my information is how</text>
  <text start="360.699" dur="5.311">I get that information how I discern</text>
  <text start="362.979" dur="5.16">that information right I am as authentic</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="3.3">as I can possibly be on this YouTube</text>
  <text start="368.139" dur="2.671">channel that&amp;#39;s another reason I did a</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="5.609">YouTube channel instead of starting a</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="7.079">blog because I knew that with a face put</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="5.641">out there that&amp;#39;s even more authentic you</text>
  <text start="377.889" dur="4.471">can literally see what I&amp;#39;m doing in my</text>
  <text start="380.56" dur="3.93">spare bedroom right here with this</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="4.17">tapestry on the wall and these lights</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="4.41">here and you know these whiteboards and</text>
  <text start="386.53" dur="4.83">all that I don&amp;#39;t have anything to hide</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="6.629">and people can tell which is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="5.76">gravitating towards the message okay and</text>
  <text start="395.529" dur="4.041">again it&amp;#39;s about the message not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="3.84">not about the messenger but if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="5.469">you know</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="5.28">a mysterious enigma of a messenger it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.039" dur="3.481">gonna make the message a little more</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="5.7">difficult to bring across keep that in</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="6.42">mind but um you know kind of getting</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="6.509">into rant mode here as I typically do</text>
  <text start="414.94" dur="5.34">the point is that authenticity is going</text>
  <text start="418.449" dur="3.661">to shine in this particular day and age</text>
  <text start="420.28" dur="4.919">that&amp;#39;s another name that I&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="422.11" dur="5.04">heard people term these times in Houston</text>
  <text start="425.199" dur="4.411">human history is the age of authenticity</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="3.81">and I like that one I like it a lot</text>
  <text start="429.61" dur="4.529">because that&amp;#39;s exactly what it is if</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="4.889">you&amp;#39;re not going to be authentic whether</text>
  <text start="434.139" dur="4.641">it is putting yourself on the internet</text>
  <text start="435.849" dur="5.19">creating your brand creating your own</text>
  <text start="438.78" dur="3.85">business conscious business whatever the</text>
  <text start="441.039" dur="3.741">case is or just getting into a</text>
  <text start="442.63" dur="6.599">relationship if you&amp;#39;re not authentic</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="6.52">they will be able to tell and if they</text>
  <text start="449.229" dur="4.921">can&amp;#39;t tell and you&amp;#39;re still inauthentic</text>
  <text start="451.3" dur="8.339">and you use and abuse that relationship</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="8.22">that you&amp;#39;re garnering well God the</text>
  <text start="459.639" dur="8.011">universe the cosmos the divine</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="6.66">intelligence it makes up everything well</text>
  <text start="467.65" dur="6.6">you&amp;#39;re gonna get some bad karma from</text>
  <text start="469.03" dur="7.83">that you&amp;#39;re breaking some some free will</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="4.919">and some individuals right there so</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="4.679">anyway that&amp;#39;s really what I wanted to</text>
  <text start="479.169" dur="7.171">rant about right here is the fact that</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="6.841">authenticity shines and the more you</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="5.879">bring it to the table the more success</text>
  <text start="488.38" dur="6.86">that you&amp;#39;re going to be able to have the</text>
  <text start="492.219" dur="6.031">more opportunity that you will have to</text>
  <text start="495.24" dur="6.37">realize your visions to actually make a</text>
  <text start="498.25" dur="6.09">positive impact so that&amp;#39;s all for this</text>
  <text start="501.61" dur="5.309">one I will be back later today with my</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="3.9">thoughts on what&amp;#39;s going on and a little</text>
  <text start="506.919" dur="4.831">bit more information I&amp;#39;m glad to be back</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="5.64">here at home too so I&amp;#39;ll be able to get</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="4.5">into more video making much more so than</text>
  <text start="513.88" dur="5.269">of course the last week back at it guys</text>
