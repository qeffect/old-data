  <text start="37.53" dur="4.92">or four years ago I came across him on</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="5.281">Facebook and the reason I liked his work</text>
  <text start="42.45" dur="5.01">is because it was just no-holds-barred</text>

  <text start="69.54" dur="3.84">but hungry for the validation as well</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="3.961">and reading his writings back then</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="3.629">definitely let me know that I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="120.94" dur="5.91">the exact opposite of Who I am now and I</text>
  <text start="124.299" dur="4.68">was young I was you know Todd and</text>
  <text start="126.85" dur="6.84">condition and program through the system</text>
  <text start="128.979" dur="7.671">to you know just I was thought that my</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="5.73">value was based on my monetary assets</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="6.25">right undid everything to cut any kind</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="5.7">of investigation beneath my skin into my</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="3.96">soul into my spirit into who I really</text>
  <text start="145.12" dur="4.199">was so that was a scary kid I always</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="4.709">wanted it to stop at my car I always</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="4.591">wanted to stop at my muscles I always</text>
  <text start="151.569" dur="4.95">wanted to stop at my clothes or my fancy</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="4.98">watch and I was relatively successful</text>
  <text start="156.519" dur="4.171">very early on in business and when</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re you know when you&amp;#39;re scared and</text>
  <text start="160.69" dur="4.799">you&amp;#39;re programmed by the systems that we</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="5.16">have in place there&amp;#39;s a lot of low</text>
  <text start="165.489" dur="4.651">self-worth there&amp;#39;s a lot of latent and</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="4.95">you know underlying self-hatred so when</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="6.42">you do get given some monetary resources</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="5.58">in this system the kind of you&amp;#39;re damned</text>
  <text start="176.56" dur="4.32">if you do if you&amp;#39;re damned you&amp;#39;re damned</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="4.349">if you don&amp;#39;t because you work so hard to</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="4.8">get these monetary resources and when I</text>
  <text start="182.769" dur="5.881">acquired them I mean there was another</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="4.83">program there waiting for me that was</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="3.6">kind of inserted into me by this</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="4.5">corrupted media system is that when I</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="6.84">did get my hands on this money I started</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="6.96">to destroy myself even more you know</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="7.05">pursue cocaine and steroids and growth</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="7.46">hormone and you know how bad company</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="5.879">with very immoral and corrupt people and</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="4.66">you know that&amp;#39;s kind of the whole system</text>
  <text start="212.019" dur="3.991">they make the the media and the</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="3.989">government and all the these different</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="5.069">programs that work hand in hand drive</text>
  <text start="218.079" dur="5.011">people to you know pursue this monetary</text>
  <text start="221.079" dur="4.981">resource or these lives that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="223.09" dur="5.01">want to be living and that traps most</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="4.56">people but if you happen to break</text>
  <text start="228.1" dur="6.18">through you know this kind of glass</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="5.13">ceiling and grab some of this money</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="4.35">you know that&amp;#39;s falling from the</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="4.53">corrupted pyramid you know once you have</text>
  <text start="238.63" dur="3.81">this money you&amp;#39;re already pre-programmed</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="5.61">to destroy yourself with it and I was</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="5.519">headlong into that so there was there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="5.16">a point in time where my body you know</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="5.371">everybody has this kind of innate</text>
  <text start="251.05" dur="4.68">intelligence that&amp;#39;s inside their body</text>
  <text start="253.33" dur="5.909">some people call it their soul my soul</text>
  <text start="255.73" dur="6">whispered to me a lot that you know</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="3.751">you&amp;#39;re on the wrong path you&amp;#39;re not you</text>
  <text start="261.73" dur="7.7">know you&amp;#39;re not gonna make it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.99" dur="9.66">gonna die I was I was nearly dead at 29</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="6.73">very empty very soulless</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="5.82">I had no direction and of course I was</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="4.8">depressed was because I was up every</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="5.31">human has that spirits are looking for</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="4.53">you know what what really life is all</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="3.48">about and I really had a hard time</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="4.35">finding that and so my soul really</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="5.07">yelled at me one day said you know you</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t have a lot of runway here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="6.089">tired of whispering you have to make a</text>
  <text start="295.12" dur="5.43">change and it was my body was giving me</text>
  <text start="298.419" dur="4.051">these huge pain sensations I&amp;#39;ve told</text>
  <text start="300.55" dur="4.7">this story many times down the left side</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="6.69">of my body I could barely walk by a</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="7.72">practitioner from the Czech Institute in</text>

  <text start="333.039" dur="7.291">pain in two weeks well very gentle she</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="5.791">had the very Czech way about her she</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="5.85">knows I was on the verge of death or</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="5.07">collapse or full mental breakdown and</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="4.739">she was just gentle with me and we got</text>
  <text start="348.28" dur="4.62">lots of time kind of you know reassuring</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="6.631">me that everything was going to be okay</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="6.57">and once that pain was alleviated and I</text>
  <text start="357.55" dur="3.96">was there for the better part of two</text>
  <text start="359.47" dur="4.11">decades and it was gone in two weeks</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="4.23">with some simple stretches and some</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="2.85">simple changes in my diet I was very</text>

  <text start="372.52" dur="4.38">Czech Institute in California of course</text>
  <text start="374.47" dur="5.79">I was still inverted I still had a</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="6.42">perverse value system I was looking to</text>
  <text start="380.26" dur="6.93">acquire this magic to help myself make</text>
  <text start="383.32" dur="7.61">money and along the way I got tricked</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="3.74">and becoming a better human being</text>

  <text start="400.09" dur="4.62">yeah I&amp;#39;m 48 now okay so it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="4.17">almost 20 years ago how did you first</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="3.42">become familiar with the Czech Institute</text>
  <text start="406.72" dur="3">because I&amp;#39;m absolutely a huge fan of</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="4.32">Paul Czech and his work there in</text>
  <text start="409.72" dur="5.37">California we heard little we would go</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="4.74">to health shows where they would so you</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="3.78">know the fitness equipment and there</text>
  <text start="417.19" dur="6.17">would be speakers and you care about</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="7.14">Paul Jack and how foods important and</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="5.68">you know when you&amp;#39;re desperate you&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="426.01" dur="5.46">and pursue sort of any avenue possible</text>
  <text start="429.04" dur="4.95">so I was really desperate and Janice was</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="6.03">that like that she&amp;#39;s from Cornwall even</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="5.4">though she&amp;#39;s gone on to like the Czech</text>
  <text start="437.5" dur="4.23">Hall of Fame and she&amp;#39;s in Toronto and</text>
  <text start="439.39" dur="5.64">she&amp;#39;s one of the most sought-after Czech</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="5.4">practitioners in Canada she was a couple</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="4.23">she was and childhood friend of mine so</text>
  <text start="447.13" dur="4.95">I was able to get hold of her please</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="4.71">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s as if all these things that</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;ve always heard of eat better do your</text>
  <text start="453.97" dur="3.48">stretches correct your posture you know</text>
  <text start="456.13" dur="3.66">we don&amp;#39;t really take them seriously</text>
  <text start="457.45" dur="4.11">until something happens and we have to</text>
  <text start="459.79" dur="5.22">and then we realise how it changes our</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="5.61">lives yeah and you know and I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="465.01" dur="5.19">changing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s never a destination</text>
  <text start="467.17" dur="5.33">it&amp;#39;s always a journey and you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="470.2" dur="5.61">written over a thousand articles on my</text>
  <text start="472.5" dur="5.83">my website if people ever want to go and</text>
  <text start="475.81" dur="5.94">see you know what really goes on inside</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="6.24">my mind and I really write to get you</text>
  <text start="481.75" dur="4.53">know to organize my own thoughts and of</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="3.9">course it benefits other people that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="5.19">why I record it from make any money off</text>
  <text start="488.47" dur="5.82">my website but the whole idea is that</text>
  <text start="491.47" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s like a second artistic expression</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="5.64">or like an energy release so that I can</text>
  <text start="497.47" dur="4.259">more understand how I&amp;#39;m feeling or</text>
  <text start="499.93" dur="3.48">what&amp;#39;s really wrong with society you</text>
  <text start="501.729" dur="3.631">really have to kind of tabulate it and</text>
  <text start="503.41" dur="4.2">write it down before you can get a full</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="4.29">grip on exactly what&amp;#39;s going on in our</text>
  <text start="507.61" dur="3.839">society right now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="4.769">awakening but a lot of people are like</text>
  <text start="511.449" dur="4.681">digging harder into the lie and really</text>
  <text start="514.419" dur="5.04">wanting to nest in there and I want</text>
  <text start="516.13" dur="5.43">nothing to do with reality and you know</text>
  <text start="519.459" dur="4.951">this is where the conflict comes in it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="5.88">too bad it&amp;#39;s so conflictual between the</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="7.23">truth and the lies but the lies are</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="7.29">heavily monetized in our society there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="5.67">so many people that are invested in the</text>
  <text start="534.73" dur="4.62">lie where their salaries are tied to the</text>
  <text start="537.31" dur="4.98">lie and their seniority is tied to the</text>
  <text start="539.35" dur="5.1">lie they they&amp;#39;re gonna fight tooth and</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="4.53">nail to keep this lie alive like save</text>

  <text start="549.79" dur="5.37">these vaccines or making the vaccine no</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="5.46">matter how detrimental or obvious the</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="4.29">evidence is that vaccines are not safe</text>
  <text start="557.38" dur="4.019">or effective there&amp;#39;s so many people out</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="3.54">there that pull paychecks from this they</text>
  <text start="561.399" dur="4.321">didn&amp;#39;t they really don&amp;#39;t care and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="5.67">how immoral our society has become it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="6.78">it&amp;#39;s I mean I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>

  <text start="596.14" dur="4.92">and immorality is being washed over us</text>
  <text start="599.14" dur="4.23">in such a quantity like we&amp;#39;re drowning</text>
  <text start="601.06" dur="4.44">in the tsunami of immorality through the</text>

  <text start="1117.98" dur="4.569">that&amp;#39;s what self-sabotage is in the</text>
  <text start="1120.629" dur="4.38">nutshell is you actually have two</text>
  <text start="1122.549" dur="4.801">separate parts of your brain they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1125.009" dur="5.01">going toe-to-toe all the time so you</text>
  <text start="1127.35" dur="4.74">take one step forward you take one step</text>
  <text start="1130.019" dur="3.66">back you want to take one step forward</text>

  <text start="1156.059" dur="4.95">time separate and opposing personalities</text>
  <text start="1158.84" dur="5.199">so let&amp;#39;s talk about that a little bit</text>
  <text start="1161.009" dur="4.201">because there&amp;#39;s this huge push into the</text>

  <text start="1516.18" dur="6.06">discussing the abused II and the abuser</text>
  <text start="1518.58" dur="5.25">concept in media you know I was thinking</text>
  <text start="1522.24" dur="3.51">when you were saying that that when we</text>
  <text start="1523.83" dur="6.38">see all of these not just health</text>
  <text start="1525.75" dur="7.23">information and whatnot but all of the</text>

  <text start="1535.46" dur="4.54">under you know mysterious circumstances</text>
  <text start="1538.11" dur="3.69">then they throw the agendas at us it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1540" dur="3.78">almost as if with that information they</text>
  <text start="1541.8" dur="4.22">want us to abuse ourselves and be the</text>
  <text start="1543.78" dur="5.25">abused at the same time so we play that</text>
  <text start="1546.02" dur="5.41">victim mindset and the same time we</text>
  <text start="1549.03" dur="5.58">almost abuse ourselves by believing it</text>
  <text start="1551.43" dur="5.46">so we&amp;#39;re too scared not to exactly and</text>
  <text start="1554.61" dur="4.17">this is this is the very odd thing about</text>
