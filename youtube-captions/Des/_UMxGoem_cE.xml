  <text start="0.03" dur="3.21">hey there guys switching things up a</text>
  <text start="1.949" dur="3.361">little bit in this video I&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="3.24" dur="4.289">to an expert about the financial system</text>
  <text start="5.31" dur="3.81">he knows very well what the Federal</text>
  <text start="7.529" dur="3.181">Reserve is all about so we&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="9.12" dur="4.32">about what the feds trying to do to our</text>
  <text start="10.71" dur="5.31">economy I&amp;#39;ll be talking about what could</text>
  <text start="13.44" dur="5.19">be done to end the Fed and also if the</text>
  <text start="16.02" dur="4.89">Fed does cause any sort of recession</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="11.969">what can you best do to protect yourself</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="11.64">financially take a look Colin bloom</text>
  <text start="30.599" dur="3.361">president Nobel gold always appreciate</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="10.41">you giving us your expertise in your</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="10.98">time here thanks absolutely and I want</text>
  <text start="42.96" dur="4.68">to begin this conversation by getting</text>
  <text start="44.94" dur="4.86">into the economy being that you study</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="4.98">the markets you&amp;#39;re involved in that</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="4.739">realm and on one hand we&amp;#39;re hearing and</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="4.05">seeing a lot of evidence that shows us</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="4.41">that our economy is growing that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="4.229">booming we&amp;#39;ve got unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="4.68">we have things like that but then on the</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="4.59">other hand we have certain indicators</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="3.931">and people who follow those sorts of</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="4.74">things they&amp;#39;re saying that a recession</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="4.62">might be coming up and from 20 and</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="4.261">beyond that we might be looking at some</text>
  <text start="72.18" dur="5.79">turbulent times so what do you see</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="5.85">instead of me that it&amp;#39;s yeah I mean I</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="4.89">know Manufacturing has slowed down</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="4.56">considerably just looking at the numbers</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="3.78">you look at the stock market and</text>
  <text start="84.9" dur="3.929">obviously it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s close to all-time</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="4.589">highs so that that does give people a</text>
  <text start="88.829" dur="4.591">lot of comfort when they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="6.57">their portfolios but I do know that a</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="6.93">lot of the risk managers out there hedge</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="6.36">fund managers are moving away from</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="6.54">equities I had a report that just shows</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="5.57">that you know a lot of the the one two</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="6.15">percent of wealth in this country is is</text>
  <text start="109.729" dur="5.861">nervous and they&amp;#39;re moving into safer</text>
  <text start="113.04" dur="4.56">investments some of them are even moving</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.02">in a cash which you know sort of</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="4.379">surprising if you think about what the</text>
  <text start="119.61" dur="4.7">value of the dollar is so you know I</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="5.221">think you have that comfort level with</text>
  <text start="124.31" dur="6.55">looking at the stock market but then if</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="6.1">you look at historical numbers we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="4.3">never seen a bull market last</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="3.99">as long as this bull market is lasted</text>
  <text start="135.16" dur="5.61">and so you have a lot of cautious</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="5.31">investors that are sliding into gold and</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="5.79">silver and and more stable investment</text>
  <text start="142.6" dur="6.86">schools up about 16% this year so it has</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="6.62">outpaced a number of the equity markets</text>
  <text start="149.46" dur="5.95">year today silver I still think is a</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.66">tremendous value you and I talk about</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="4.79">silver a lot and it&amp;#39;s only about seven</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="5.22">dollars an ounce now right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="5.11">absolutely it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a bargain and you</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="4.86">know if you if you look at reports from</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="6.57">mining companies a sober you know silver</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="7.32">mining is really a byproduct of gold and</text>
  <text start="171.88" dur="6.6">other metal mining so if the rush and</text>
  <text start="175.24" dur="5.12">the man for silver goes up the amount of</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="3.99">silver coming out of ground can never</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="4.21">keep up with it because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="182.47" dur="5.19">typically the metal that they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="184.57" dur="5.82">for it&amp;#39;s just an ancillary benefit of</text>
  <text start="187.66" dur="5.19">mining for those other metals so I think</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="4.8">when you see that the drag at you know</text>
  <text start="192.85" dur="5.43">bold up 16% you see silver hasn&amp;#39;t moved</text>
  <text start="195.19" dur="5.64">that much yet I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="198.28" dur="5.16">optimistic that we could see a nice run</text>
  <text start="200.83" dur="4.82">and sober I know that the US Mint has is</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="6.78">releasing are starting to sell their</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="6.4">2020 US silver eagles and the demand for</text>
  <text start="210.22" dur="5.31">those has been through the roof so I I</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="5.61">do see that we&amp;#39;ll see a trailer effect</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="4.62">with with the silver prices probably the</text>
  <text start="217.66" dur="4.92">first quarter next year and good to</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="3.54">coincide with any potential recession</text>
  <text start="222.58" dur="3.24">you know do you think our economy is</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="4.44">gonna start slipping a bit yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="4.77">you need for especially need to two</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="5.94">quarters and negative growth which can</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="8.01">happen very quickly you know the Fed is</text>
  <text start="234.07" dur="5.85">is has QE for in their horizon and</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re expanding the money</text>
  <text start="239.92" dur="6.06">supply to try to stop that to try to you</text>
  <text start="243.19" dur="5.19">know move in a different direction but I</text>
  <text start="245.98" dur="6.15">think everybody knows that the the debt</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="7.68">of the country is tremendous and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.13" dur="5.31">think if you gave anybody you know if I</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="4.44">give you a hundred thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="257.44" dur="5.46">today I don&amp;#39;t think you your first</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="5.37">option would be to put all that money in</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="4.08">the stock I think anybody that has any</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="4.14">comments</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="5.73">that got that gift would look at other</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="4.8">options as being safer maybe you do put</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="3.42">some of the stock market but I think</text>
  <text start="274.81" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;d want to hedge your bet just</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="4.92">because we&amp;#39;ve never seen the numbers of</text>
  <text start="279.04" dur="3.81">the stock market that we see today so we</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="7.02">there&amp;#39;s nothing nothing out there to</text>
  <text start="282.85" dur="6.99">justify the values of stocks because if</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="3.06">you look at the fundamentals and you</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="3.18">know you look at the Shiller Price Index</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="4.38">which shows the actual fundamentals of</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="4.62">stocks and their true value it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="4.47">lower than what they&amp;#39;re trading at today</text>
  <text start="297.64" dur="4.29">so a lot of it&amp;#39;s a function of cheap</text>
  <text start="299.98" dur="4.35">debt and a lot of it it&amp;#39;s a function of</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="4.59">emotion in the markets because when</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="4.53">people feel comfortable they leave their</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="3.99">accounts they don&amp;#39;t do anything when</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="4.08">they start to see things start to go</text>
  <text start="310.51" dur="4.29">down they start to sell and that will</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="4.95">have a trigger effect that stock prices</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="4.56">will drop so as much as people think</text>
  <text start="317.89" dur="3.51">well the economy is good and the stock</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="4.74">market is saying it&amp;#39;s not always that</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="4.89">that drives the markets you know when</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="5.88">2008 when we had that collapse a lot of</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="5.64">it is people selling stocks on top of</text>
  <text start="329.98" dur="4.95">the value stocks dropping it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="331.93" dur="5.489">it&amp;#39;s a combo effect so if we see that</text>
  <text start="334.93" dur="4.14">that sentiment in the country that hey</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="4.651">maybe things are going wrong I need to</text>
  <text start="339.07" dur="5.28">get out stocks will continue to dive and</text>
  <text start="342.07" dur="4.5">and go down in value and obviously</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s the worst time to sell you know</text>
  <text start="346.57" dur="5.07">when a stock drops 15 20 percent but</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="4.86">human nature is you want to get out of</text>
  <text start="351.64" dur="4.2">something that&amp;#39;s falling and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="4.17">what a lot of people do and it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="5.97">know on the flip side with gold where it</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="5.76">is right now people want to see gold hit</text>
  <text start="361.81" dur="3.6">sometimes seventeen hundred and Alice</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="3.66">before they buy it or they want to see</text>
  <text start="365.41" dur="3.87">silver hit twenty dollars or twenty two</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="3.6">or twenty five before it moves but</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the wrong thing to do that</text>
  <text start="371.41" dur="4.009">the right thing to do is if you see that</text>
  <text start="373.18" dur="5.37">the value is there today and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="375.419" dur="5.681">value that that now is the time to buy</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="4.32">so we have a lot of our savvy investors</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="4.47">getting into into the markets right now</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="5.49">and diversify so you don&amp;#39;t want to buy</text>
  <text start="385.57" dur="5.82">at the peak that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the goal</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="4.2">here with investing in general totally</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="3.45">and it sounds like we&amp;#39;re not at the peak</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="4.38">right now gold is just about 1500 and</text>
  <text start="394.84" dur="4.38">like you mentioned earlier it&amp;#39;s up 16 18</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="3.449">percent just this year looks like gonna</text>
  <text start="399.22" dur="4.439">continue going and then</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="5.161">even more so with silver I mean 1718</text>
  <text start="403.659" dur="4.23">dollars an ounce what do you think that</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="4.799">could double within just a year or two I</text>
  <text start="407.889" dur="4.981">mean absolutely I don&amp;#39;t know what a year</text>
  <text start="410.349" dur="4.111">but absolutely silver can double you</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="4.109">know Geordi you you talk to people</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re out there and you know that</text>
  <text start="416.979" dur="3.421">people don&amp;#39;t have confidence in our</text>
  <text start="419.02" dur="2.91">financial system they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="3.69">confidence in our currency there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="3.959">there&amp;#39;s no doubt about it I mean you if</text>
  <text start="424.09" dur="4.44">you you know you go to your favorite</text>
  <text start="425.889" dur="5.641">restaurant today and you went there five</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="5.189">years ago how much is the price of your</text>
  <text start="431.53" dur="5.039">favorite meal gone up at that time</text>
  <text start="433.719" dur="6.081">period that&amp;#39;s just one of the indicators</text>
  <text start="436.569" dur="6.78">of how heavy inflation is I mean through</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="5.079">all everything vegetables I mean you</text>
  <text start="443.349" dur="2.581">know if you&amp;#39;re depending on what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.879" dur="4.38">eating what you&amp;#39;re putting in your body</text>
  <text start="445.93" dur="4.919">those costs are going up tremendously</text>
  <text start="449.259" dur="3.571">and I know that you&amp;#39;re really particular</text>
  <text start="450.849" dur="4.111">about what you eat what you drink I know</text>
  <text start="452.83" dur="6.75">you&amp;#39;ve seen it you know you see it on a</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="5.759">daily basis that we all got our gasoline</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="4.559">is going through the roof everywhere</text>
  <text start="460.719" dur="5.25">absolutely you know above $4 in a lot of</text>
  <text start="464.139" dur="4.83">places I mean everything has gone up</text>
  <text start="465.969" dur="5.76">tremendously yet our income has not</text>
  <text start="468.969" dur="4.891">followed suit so there has to be some</text>
  <text start="471.729" dur="3.571">kind of trigger effect eventually and</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="4.979">basically what ends up happening is that</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="5.07">people take credit cards they pull money</text>
  <text start="478.839" dur="3.901">out of their house you know I was</text>
  <text start="480.37" dur="4.71">listening to a commercial about one of</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="5.789">these you know cash places and talk</text>
  <text start="485.08" dur="6.57">about taking money out of your house to</text>
  <text start="488.529" dur="5.7">buy gifts for the holidays and I was I</text>
  <text start="491.65" dur="4.47">was like pulling my hair out thinking</text>
  <text start="494.229" dur="3.93">like yes of course you want to buy I</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="4.289">guess the holidays but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="498.159" dur="6.391">pulling equity out of your house to buy</text>
  <text start="500.409" dur="6.451">gifts is is the best allocation because</text>
  <text start="504.55" dur="5.489">those those those places that interest</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="4.589">rates on those loans are tremendous</text>
  <text start="510.039" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re gonna charge you tremendous</text>
  <text start="511.449" dur="4.921">rates on those quick you know kind of</text>
  <text start="513.159" dur="5.641">turnaround loans so I know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="3.839">of things that might say it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="518.8" dur="2.7">better to have a roof over your head</text>
  <text start="520.209" dur="2.971">than just some extra gifts for the</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="3.36">holidays yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="4.23">he&amp;#39;s out yeah I mean I would just say</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="4.589">just you know just you know take a step</text>
  <text start="527.41" dur="3.96">back and realize that like if you have a</text>
  <text start="529.449" dur="4.051">home and keep the money in there</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="2.77">you know well if you have an investment</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="2.5">you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="4.68">put money into then then it makes sense</text>
  <text start="536" dur="5.31">but to buy something that&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="4.02">just a gift it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="4.44">the wise thing doing I&amp;#39;m hearing these</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="5.16">ads and if you know if you&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="5.31">these ads you know what that means bad</text>
  <text start="548" dur="5.13">for working people are taking that step</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s the scary thing about it is</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re getting into debt to cover those</text>
  <text start="555.71" dur="4.77">things which is not smart so I I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="558.41" dur="4.38">nervous about that obviously have the</text>
  <text start="560.48" dur="5.01">credit bubble you have a student loan</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="4.67">bubble and then it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="4.56">see what happens with real estate but</text>
  <text start="567.46" dur="4.33">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an unnerving</text>
  <text start="570.05" dur="3.69">time right now and I think we&amp;#39;ll see how</text>
  <text start="571.79" dur="4.38">the last quarter the retail sales</text>
  <text start="573.74" dur="3.96">reports come out see what people how</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="3.93">much you know people were spending how</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="4.5">Christmas is a lot of you know the</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="4.26">retailer&amp;#39;s a big companies gap but all</text>

  <text start="584.36" dur="5.7">last quarter of Christmas sale Black</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="4.89">Friday so we&amp;#39;ll see how they do and you</text>
  <text start="590.06" dur="2.61">know I think that&amp;#39;ll be a better</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="3.66">indicator how next year is going to be</text>
  <text start="592.67" dur="3.72">plus you have the election plus C of the</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="3.93">impeachment hearings I mean there is a</text>
  <text start="596.39" dur="4.8">lot of things that could screw up the</text>
  <text start="598.64" dur="4.47">economy one you know Nixon resigned</text>
  <text start="601.19" dur="4.62">there was a tremendous pullback in the</text>
  <text start="603.11" dur="5.52">stock market so any kind of presidential</text>
  <text start="605.81" dur="5.07">shuffle if that were to happen that</text>
  <text start="608.63" dur="4.98">would be devastating for the market so I</text>
  <text start="610.88" dur="5.37">think it&amp;#39;s a good time to be so be</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="4.62">cautious yeah backing up for a quick</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="4.2">second we were talking about public</text>
  <text start="618.23" dur="4.14">confidence in the economy and one thing</text>
  <text start="620.45" dur="3.69">that a lot of people in the public are</text>
  <text start="622.37" dur="5.91">losing confidence in as well is that</text>
  <text start="624.14" dur="5.61">Federal Reserve and I think people give</text>
  <text start="628.28" dur="3.42">it a few years but I think people are</text>
  <text start="629.75" dur="3.96">generally going to be looking for an</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="4.08">alternative currency something that can</text>
  <text start="633.71" dur="6.18">help them End the Fed you know whether</text>
  <text start="635.78" dur="6.36">get on to a gold standard and a mass way</text>
  <text start="639.89" dur="3.81">or not I think a lot of people are still</text>
  <text start="642.14" dur="3.75">going to be looking for something that</text>
  <text start="643.7" dur="5.78">they can get out of the the Fed game</text>
  <text start="645.89" dur="7.02">with the Fiat that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a manipulation</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="6.55">you know the Fed is is you know it&amp;#39;s run</text>
  <text start="652.91" dur="4.8">by the banks and so that&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="656.03" dur="4.23">going to look out for their you know</text>
  <text start="657.71" dur="4.44">best interests and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="660.26" dur="5.13">the scary thing about it I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="662.15" dur="5.62">created an economy we&amp;#39;re saving money in</text>
  <text start="665.39" dur="4.96">the savings account makes no</text>
  <text start="667.77" dur="4.17">because you get no return and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="3.24">because of all the debt that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="671.94" dur="5.88">created and just keeping interest rates</text>
  <text start="673.59" dur="6.75">at these all-time lows it&amp;#39;s not a normal</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="4.35">market you know the the free hand is not</text>
  <text start="680.34" dur="3.99">here it&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="682.17" dur="3.3">we haven&amp;#39;t allowed it to work so you</text>
  <text start="684.33" dur="3.81">know we have all these things there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.47" dur="4.71">pumping and pumping and pumping and you</text>
  <text start="688.14" dur="5.34">know it doesn&amp;#39;t really help the average</text>
  <text start="690.18" dur="4.59">person you know this debt keeping you</text>
  <text start="693.48" dur="3.12">know the interest rates is low and</text>
  <text start="694.77" dur="4.44">having savings account pay a quarter of</text>
  <text start="696.6" dur="4.95">a percent does not help the average</text>
  <text start="699.21" dur="4.47">person because the average person isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="701.55" dur="3.99">going to take on ten different 15</text>
  <text start="703.68" dur="3.75">different risky investments and</text>
  <text start="705.54" dur="4.53">hopefully hit one of them that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="4.38">not the way that we&amp;#39;re wired and so you</text>
  <text start="710.07" dur="4.22">have all these things happening you have</text>
  <text start="711.81" dur="5.07">people on fixed income that you know</text>
  <text start="714.29" dur="5.2">when when this thing started with Social</text>
  <text start="716.88" dur="5.07">Security you know great idea but now the</text>
  <text start="719.49" dur="4.68">amount you know people are getting is is</text>
  <text start="721.95" dur="4.14">not gonna be enough to survive and pay</text>
  <text start="724.17" dur="4.89">rent and pay for food and everything</text>
  <text start="726.09" dur="5.07">they need so something&amp;#39;s gonna shift we</text>
  <text start="729.06" dur="4.44">have to see some kind of change and I</text>
  <text start="731.16" dur="4.89">and I would you know as Ron Paul says</text>
  <text start="733.5" dur="5.28">you know and the Fed is famous book his</text>
  <text start="736.05" dur="5.22">quotes I would love to see some kind of</text>
  <text start="738.78" dur="5.52">shift so that our money again was worth</text>
  <text start="741.27" dur="4.77">something but until that time we got a</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="3.72">look at what real money is real money is</text>
  <text start="746.04" dur="4.49">gold and silver and it&amp;#39;s always been</text>
  <text start="748.02" dur="4.56">there and that&amp;#39;s really the only true</text>
  <text start="750.53" dur="4.39">currency out there because it has a</text>
  <text start="752.58" dur="3.69">limited supply especially gold you know</text>
  <text start="754.92" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s only enough gold in the world to</text>
  <text start="756.27" dur="3.6">fit in to Olympic sized swimming pools</text>
  <text start="757.98" dur="4.14">two and a half big sized swimming pools</text>
  <text start="759.87" dur="4.83">which if you think about it how much</text>
  <text start="762.12" dur="4.68">gold is held by central banks there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="764.7" dur="4.23">really not that much food out there to</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="6.33">buy and sell and that&amp;#39;s what keeps</text>
  <text start="768.93" dur="6.63">pushing the price of overtime yeah you</text>
  <text start="773.13" dur="4.5">always want to you know hope for the</text>
  <text start="775.56" dur="4.71">best but prepare for the worst and</text>
  <text start="777.63" dur="5.07">hoping for the best that could mean that</text>
  <text start="780.27" dur="4.19">if that is ended and we do get back onto</text>
  <text start="782.7" dur="4.32">a gold standard and everything just</text>
  <text start="784.46" dur="4.66">rising but if we&amp;#39;re gonna prepare for</text>
  <text start="787.02" dur="3.81">the worst well then we want to look at</text>
  <text start="789.12" dur="4.14">the situations that could happen we</text>
  <text start="790.83" dur="3.99">could go into a recession of course but</text>
  <text start="793.26" dur="3.45">the Federal Reserve being owned by the</text>
  <text start="794.82" dur="3.93">central banks they could use that as a</text>
  <text start="796.71" dur="4.02">weapon against the president along with</text>
  <text start="798.75" dur="2.61">the phony impeachment hearings and</text>
