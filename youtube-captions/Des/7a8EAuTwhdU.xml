  <text start="5.029" dur="6.641">what&amp;#39;s going on ladies and gentlemen as</text>
  <text start="7.74" dur="6.63">you can see I&amp;#39;m driving in my motor</text>
  <text start="11.67" dur="5.09">vehicle you know as much as I hate cars</text>
  <text start="14.37" dur="5.64">still in Dillon with fossil fuels and</text>
  <text start="16.76" dur="5.349">grandpa&amp;#39;s technology when we have what</text>
  <text start="20.01" dur="4.56">zero-point free energy and anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="22.109" dur="4.83">propulsion they could rid of rid us of</text>
  <text start="24.57" dur="5.82">all this nonsense but still got to deal</text>
  <text start="26.939" dur="5.73">with cars and because I Drive I spend</text>
  <text start="30.39" dur="4.919">quite a bit of time driving I figure why</text>
  <text start="32.669" dur="5.16">not hook up a little contraption in here</text>
  <text start="35.309" dur="5.511">to hold my phone and fill some videos</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="5.431">while I do that and create more content</text>
  <text start="40.82" dur="5.86">because as much as I love doing the live</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="6.93">ones I really only do them when I&amp;#39;m at</text>
  <text start="46.68" dur="6.24">my place and they really only focus on</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="4.98">current events on the news and I get so</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="4.17">many questions I get questions that are</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="5.7">all across the board from so many people</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="5.67">and it would be very helpful to answer</text>
  <text start="60.87" dur="4.34">these questions and I figure why not do</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="5.13">that in more videos doing more content</text>
  <text start="65.21" dur="5.83">answering those questions so here&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="67.89" dur="5.43">while I Drive I&amp;#39;ll be doing more from a</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="6.149">studio set up and working on in my place</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="5.85">but anyway in this video the question</text>
  <text start="77.189" dur="3.961">that I have that I&amp;#39;m going to be</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="3.6">answering actually comes from my</text>
  <text start="81.15" dur="5.73">Facebook group that destroying the</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="6.18">illusion Facebook group as interesting</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="4.41">is that group has gotten a lot of trolls</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="5.459">and whatnot infesting the place working</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="6.24">on tithing that up but this question</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="5.161">comes from somebody you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="5.61">good honest well-meaning people in there</text>
  <text start="99.57" dur="9.27">and this question says what is the</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="7.4">easiest or the softest disclosure to red</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="3.9">pill somebody with basically</text>
  <text start="110.54" dur="3.67">paraphrasing here but basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="2.66">the easiest way to get somebody on the</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="4.45">awakening path</text>
  <text start="115.4" dur="6.87">and what this question entails is that</text>
  <text start="118.66" dur="5.44">there&amp;#39;s a lot of what I&amp;#39;ve been hearing</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="4.65">a lot of people refer to them lately as</text>
  <text start="124.1" dur="6.36">normies out there you can think of them</text>
  <text start="126.92" dur="6">as normies and muggles or you know sheep</text>
  <text start="130.46" dur="6.39">a lot of people say I just I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="5.79">to delve into the dividing state of</text>
  <text start="136.85" dur="4.56">things I don&amp;#39;t like to label them as</text>
  <text start="138.71" dur="3.36">being you know on this path where I will</text>
  <text start="141.41" dur="2.22">wear</text>
  <text start="142.07" dur="3.21">oh we&amp;#39;re awakened we&amp;#39;re so much better</text>
  <text start="143.63" dur="4.71">than these normies out there it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="6.48">sit right with me so we&amp;#39;ll just call</text>
  <text start="148.34" dur="5.49">them the people who aren&amp;#39;t as quite as</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="5.46">far on their paths their awakening paths</text>
  <text start="153.83" dur="4.8">as some of us might be we&amp;#39;re a little</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="3.54">bit more red pill than most</text>
  <text start="158.63" dur="3.84">you know I assume if you&amp;#39;re watching my</text>
  <text start="160.76" dur="4.41">videos of all people you&amp;#39;re a little bit</text>
  <text start="162.47" dur="5.37">more red pill than most of course you</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="5.46">know being awakened or being a red pill</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="4.64">is not a black and white thing it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="4.65">not being red pilled or not it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="172.48" dur="5.38">continuous process you know you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="4.41">continue getting awakened continue</text>
  <text start="177.86" dur="5.19">learning things a red pilling thing red</text>
  <text start="179.69" dur="6.81">pilling yourself it&amp;#39;s never a done or</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="6.06">not situation but of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="5.43">quite a few people in this country and</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="6">all on this planet who have yet to even</text>
  <text start="191.93" dur="5.22">begin the awakening process and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="4.98">who we&amp;#39;re talking about what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="197.15" dur="5.339">easiest way to begin red pilling them</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="5.97">softest way because of course you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="202.489" dur="6.541">just force a horse to drink all that</text>
  <text start="206.06" dur="4.649">water especially with that water or that</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="4.08">truth is going to scare the living</text>
  <text start="210.709" dur="3.961">out of them that&amp;#39;s why most people run</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="2.97">from the truth they get all this</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="3.599">cognitive dissonance in their heads</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="5.219">because it&amp;#39;s so scary they get so</text>
  <text start="218.269" dur="4.591">emotionally caught up in it and then</text>
  <text start="221.299" dur="3.72">they run away and they revert back to</text>
  <text start="222.86" dur="6.45">their conventional thinking hidey-holes</text>
  <text start="225.019" dur="6.901">so we need ways to ease the truth onto</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="5.37">them and what I had answered to this</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="6.76">question what is the easiest or softest</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="8.3">topics to disclose upon to people was</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="8.74">food healthcare the state of that</text>
  <text start="242.98" dur="7.709">corruption in our society in my opinion</text>
  <text start="247.42" dur="6.629">that is the easiest way and one of the</text>
  <text start="250.689" dur="5.101">easiest topics to begin to get people to</text>
  <text start="254.049" dur="3.72">wake the hell up</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="4.229">and that&amp;#39;s what the topics were for me I</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="3.72">just say food and healthcare from</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="4.141">experience because that&amp;#39;s what happened</text>
  <text start="261.489" dur="4.861">to me and then it was quickly into all</text>
  <text start="264.16" dur="5.64">the other rabbit holes from there but I</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="7.7">think just in general you know you could</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="8.28">say everybody is going to be easiest ly</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="5.41">easiest oh they&amp;#39;re easiest Avenue of</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="2.94">Awakening is going to be food in</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="3.66">healthcare one because so many people</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="5.489">are just emotionally tied into it you</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="6.24">know everybody has somebody they know</text>
  <text start="286.509" dur="6.961">that has had cancer or died from cancer</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="6.239">has some extremely degenerative disease</text>
  <text start="293.47" dur="3.99">that can be easily explained by our</text>
  <text start="295.599" dur="4.5">shitty pharmaceutical system and our</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="4.53">shitty how food system GMO foods and</text>
  <text start="300.099" dur="6.44">toxic food additives and you know</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="7.799">vaccines I am seeing a huge wave of</text>
  <text start="306.539" dur="5.141">awakening young moms primarily on</text>
  <text start="309.789" dur="4.38">Facebook there there&amp;#39;s groups with like</text>
  <text start="311.68" dur="4.56">50 hundred thousand people in it and the</text>
  <text start="314.169" dur="5.791">60 70 % of these people in these groups</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="6.81">are awakening young moms these groups</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="4.53">are vaccine groups and they are so</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="3.6">emotionally driven because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.49" dur="4.62">waking up to what&amp;#39;s going on - children</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="4.739">and they have children I have a child so</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="8.339">that&amp;#39;s why you know things like vaccines</text>
  <text start="331.389" dur="9.421">and keeping children healthy are so they</text>
  <text start="337.449" dur="5.851">can be so emotionally trans so</text>
  <text start="340.81" dur="4.71">transformative to somebody and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="3.63">what could be that rabbit hole that</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="3.75">begins to wake them up to everything</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="4.709">else because of course of course</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="5.459">everything is connected the healthcare</text>
  <text start="351.639" dur="5.881">system looking in that can lead to all</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="5.19">the other avenues so it&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="4.139">why I feel it&amp;#39;s one of the best ways to</text>
  <text start="359.919" dur="5.25">awaken people it&amp;#39;s very emotionally</text>
  <text start="361.659" dur="6.381">driven everybody&amp;#39;s going to be relatable</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="4.971">to it in one way or another or the die</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="4.23">clear indirectly and also there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="370.14" dur="4.62">of evidence out there for it of course I</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="5.37">know some topics I discuss many others</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="4.83">discuss the evidence is there but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.64" dur="5.96">much tougher to come by this could be</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="9.24">maybe the secret space program or the</text>
  <text start="383.6" dur="7.63">cultish practices of the elite evidence</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="3.9">is tougher to come by and there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="391.23" dur="3.3">much deeper subjects when it comes to</text>
  <text start="392.73" dur="3.06">healthcare and food there&amp;#39;s evidence</text>
  <text start="394.53" dur="3.51">everywhere there&amp;#39;s all kinds of evidence</text>
  <text start="395.79" dur="5.46">for fluoride be bad for you for vaccines</text>
  <text start="398.04" dur="6.42">being toxic for GMOs being bad for you</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="6.66">bad for the state of the planet there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="404.46" dur="5.28">evidence everywhere and not only that</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s all kinds of documentaries you</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="7.83">can point people towards there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.42" dur="9.08">scientists researchers there&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="417.57" dur="9.33">websites of resources and there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="5.74">what do I want to say proof health X</text>
  <text start="426.9" dur="6.03">health professionals on record who have</text>
  <text start="429.24" dur="5.67">quoted as to saying science sucks so you</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="3.6">can literally point to for instance the</text>
  <text start="434.91" dur="4.17">former editor of The Lancet I believe</text>
  <text start="436.53" dur="5.04">his name is dr. Richard Horton he said</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="4.38">basically half of all scientific</text>
  <text start="441.57" dur="4.34">literature is false made-up and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="4.17">all kinds of collusion and and</text>
  <text start="445.91" dur="4.09">skullduggery that goes on with</text>
  <text start="447.63" dur="4.2">scientific studies the former editor of</text>
  <text start="450" dur="3.78">the New England Journal of Medicine dr.</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="3.33">Marsha Angle if I&amp;#39;m remembering</text>
  <text start="453.78" dur="3.9">correctly this is just all of course off</text>
  <text start="455.16" dur="3.33">the top my head these two people have</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="3.84">said that yeah</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="4.65">science is fraught you can barely trust</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="3.33">anything that comes from meta from</text>
  <text start="463.14" dur="4.08">research journals these days so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.85" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s just so much overwhelming</text>
  <text start="467.22" dur="4.38">evidence that pointing someone to that</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="4.74">will begin their awakening process</text>
  <text start="471.6" dur="5.61">greatly and definitely be something they</text>
  <text start="474.3" dur="5.67">can relate to and that you can prove so</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s why I say food health care big</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="8.3">pharma but then of course you know it</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="7.5">all depends on the person and this is a</text>
  <text start="488.27" dur="4.04">just point I want to end with here in</text>
  <text start="490.83" dur="4.36">that</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="6">to get someone to really wake up even if</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re really ingrained in their belief</text>
  <text start="498.31" dur="5.03">system ingrained in their ways if their</text>
  <text start="500.29" dur="5.85">ego just doesn&amp;#39;t want to move that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="503.34" dur="4.99">you have to get to know the person you</text>
  <text start="506.14" dur="4.86">got to connect with them and this whole</text>
  <text start="508.33" dur="5.19">you know you can&amp;#39;t just sit on your ass</text>
  <text start="511" dur="4.56">and try to shout the truth from the</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="4.17">rooftops and expect that to take a hold</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="4.19">in people&amp;#39;s people&amp;#39;s minds people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="4.83">consciousness because it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="5.02">there you gonna have to find ways to</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="4.95">connect with people whether you&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="4.44">know in the the point I mentioned about</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="6.11">the healthcare system was as if you were</text>
  <text start="529.21" dur="9.75">talking to a general audience if you</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="8.35">want to specifically have some red pills</text>
  <text start="538.96" dur="4.83">or some awakening thoughts some higher</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="3.72">consciousness thoughts take hold in</text>
  <text start="543.79" dur="2.91">somebody&amp;#39;s head you&amp;#39;re gonna have to get</text>
  <text start="545.65" dur="3.06">to know the person you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="3.93">get to know what they&amp;#39;re emotionally</text>
  <text start="548.71" dur="3.84">tied to what pulls their heartstrings</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="5.01">you know if you want to get somebody to</text>
  <text start="552.55" dur="4.29">wake up learn about their past learn</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="3.69">about what they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="556.84" dur="5.49">emotionally triggered or driven by say</text>
  <text start="559.33" dur="3.9">somebody went to college for economics</text>
  <text start="562.33" dur="3.93">right</text>
  <text start="563.23" dur="5.13">maybe that healthcare Avenue waking them</text>
  <text start="566.26" dur="5.25">up isn&amp;#39;t going to be the most fruitful</text>
  <text start="568.36" dur="5.06">maybe you&amp;#39;re going to want to try to</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="4.74">drop some nuggets of information</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="5.41">regarding the Federal Reserve the fiat</text>
  <text start="576.25" dur="4.29">currency system right pointing to some</text>
  <text start="578.83" dur="8.03">documentaries or some articles about</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="9.86">that if somebody for instance might be</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="6.39">a physicist you know they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="590.4" dur="5.34">real or some kind of engineer electrical</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="6.12">engineer they might be very driven by</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="6.78">free energy research so that could be</text>
  <text start="599.37" dur="6.06">the avenue that wakes them up of course</text>
  <text start="602.52" dur="4.98">assuming that they&amp;#39;re beginning to</text>
  <text start="605.43" dur="4.65">question and starting to break through</text>
  <text start="607.5" dur="4.68">the denial phase of it but again my</text>
  <text start="610.08" dur="4.32">point being is just you got it no each</text>
  <text start="612.18" dur="4.86">person individually if you want to</text>
  <text start="614.4" dur="6.65">specifically wake one person up you know</text>
  <text start="617.04" dur="7.98">you got to sell your ideas you have to</text>
  <text start="621.05" dur="6.07">make the truth sexy in a way but make it</text>
  <text start="625.02" dur="4.77">relatable make it compassionate you</text>
  <text start="627.12" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t just like I said shout it from the</text>
  <text start="629.79" dur="7.56">rooftops in any way shape or form and</text>
  <text start="632.67" dur="6.51">expect it to expect that horse to want</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="3.57">to drink that water you know as that</text>
  <text start="639.18" dur="3.06">saying always goes you can lead a horse</text>
  <text start="640.92" dur="4.35">to water but you can&amp;#39;t make them drink</text>
