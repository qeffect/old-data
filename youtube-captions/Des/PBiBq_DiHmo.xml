  <text start="127.56" dur="5.33">complications help available to assist</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="5.54">with cost of flu shots this</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="6.66">all within just the last few hours and</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="4.89">this is not gonna stop guys even foxnews</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="3.48">getting in on the action</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="6.21">pregnant women who get flu shot are less</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="8.01">likely to be hospitalized from virus CDC</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="6.27">says yes because when I want truthful</text>
  <text start="151.04" dur="3.96">information on vaccines that&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="153.32" dur="5.37">organization that I&amp;#39;m gonna go to the</text>
  <text start="155" dur="7.47">CDC that was sarcasm if you didn&amp;#39;t pick</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="6.47">up on that in fact flu shots if you get</text>
  <text start="162.47" dur="5.34">them while pregnant they are shown to</text>
  <text start="165.16" dur="6.64">immensely increase the risk of birth</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="7.679">defects and deaths upon birth as well</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="6.09">flu shots are extremely toxic guys and</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="4.681">not only that but look what happened in</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="5.91">Minneapolis this week a woman had to</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="5.34">undergo arm surgery just moments after</text>
  <text start="183.8" dur="3.78">her flu shot she got a condition known</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="5.31">as cerva which stands for shoulder</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="6">injury related to vaccine administration</text>
  <text start="190.82" dur="5.25">and she had to have surgery to get</text>
  <text start="193.58" dur="4.61">something out of her arm right after</text>
  <text start="196.07" dur="4.32">that flu shot probably a massive</text>
  <text start="198.19" dur="5.44">inflammatory something she had to get</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="7.8">taken out and point here guys is that</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="7.139">vaccines do not work as they tell us</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s a lot of unlearning we have to</text>
  <text start="210.769" dur="5.28">do with a lot of subjects out there but</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="5.07">with vaccines especially because they</text>
  <text start="216.049" dur="4.591">tell us they protect us they prevent</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="5.639">disease they strengthen our immune</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="5.849">system etc etc but in fact they do none</text>
  <text start="223.579" dur="6.771">of these things flu shots harm your</text>
  <text start="226.489" dur="6.53">immune system they actually promote</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="5.56">degenerative disease they do not prevent</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="5.47">infectious chronic disease you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="5.07">injecting heavy metals directly directly</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="4.171">into your blood mercury aluminum you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="3.21">injecting aborted fetal tissue you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="3.9">injecting all sorts of different</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="4.56">proteins and even nanoparticles into</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="5.1">your body and who knows what else is put</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="4.829">into vaccines so I would highly suggest</text>
  <text start="251.66" dur="4.799">granted I&amp;#39;m not a medical professional</text>
  <text start="253.579" dur="6.9">this is not medical advice habla but I</text>
  <text start="256.459" dur="6.691">myself would highly suggest you reject</text>
  <text start="260.479" dur="4.591">the poison outright not just the flu</text>
  <text start="263.15" dur="3.41">shot which many people understand the</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="7.43">flu shot is Bo</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="9.02">but any vaccine we have propaganda push</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="7.44">going on for the HPV vaccine so the HPV</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="8.07">also known as Gardasil made by Merck the</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="7.38">HPV vaccine was originally only</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="6.97">administered to young people to people</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="5.94">under the age of 26 there&amp;#39;s been a heavy</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="5.15">push out there to have young boys and</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="6.12">young girls take it now it has been</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="5.56">expanded for people ages 27 to 45</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s this massive expansion for the</text>
  <text start="301.33" dur="4.83">HPV vaccine go get it they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="3.96">that it prevents cervical cancer and</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="4.259">other malignancies granted I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="5.189">why it&amp;#39;s now approved for men can men</text>
  <text start="310.419" dur="4.441">get cervical cancer again a lot of</text>
  <text start="313.389" dur="4.711">incongruencies a lot of inconsistencies</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="7.32">in vaccine logic so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="318.1" dur="6.27">expand this and what&amp;#39;s amazing is that</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="3.69">the HPV vaccine is one of the most</text>
  <text start="324.37" dur="6.09">dangerous out there</text>
  <text start="325.87" dur="7.2">there are numerous examples of young</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="5.97">boys and young girls even getting killed</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="6.15">by this vaccine getting maimed by it so</text>
  <text start="336.43" dur="5.43">beware beware of this propaganda push</text>
  <text start="339.22" dur="5.64">and still on the topic of vaccines but</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="6.809">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about another disease</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="5.61">here so I&amp;#39;m using Washington State as an</text>
  <text start="348.669" dur="4.261">example in this news story but I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="350.47" dur="4.86">it in multiple states lately but in</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="5.43">Washington in particular a sixth child</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="3.6">has been hospitalized with a mysterious</text>
  <text start="358.36" dur="3.059">illness</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="5.76">health officials say that mysterious</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="7.711">illness is called a FM or acute flaccid</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="6.599">myelitis and check this out it&amp;#39;s a rare</text>
  <text start="369.13" dur="6.02">nervous system disorder that causes</text>
  <text start="371.289" dur="8.961">sudden limb paralysis in children</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="7.87">doesn&amp;#39;t that sound a lot like polio huh</text>
  <text start="380.25" dur="7.09">okay let&amp;#39;s open that can of worms here</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="6.69">so when I and others often try to put</text>
  <text start="387.34" dur="4.38">the truth out there about vaccines polio</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="4.29">is one that triggers a lot of people and</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="4.71">I see a lot of propaganda pushed out</text>
  <text start="394" dur="5.64">there about the polio vaccine trying to</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="3.72">get folks to go get it you know love</text>
  <text start="399.64" dur="3.059">their backs</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="5.579">whatever the case is so with the polio</text>
  <text start="402.699" dur="5.791">vaccine point one is that many of these</text>
  <text start="405.729" dur="4.861">diseases in the mid 1900s that had</text>
  <text start="408.49" dur="4.77">vaccines come out for them they actually</text>
  <text start="410.59" dur="4.53">declined by some ninety to ninety five</text>
  <text start="413.26" dur="4.23">percent in the first place anyway before</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="4.079">the vaccines were even introduced the</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="3.48">vaccines were then introduced in the</text>
  <text start="419.199" dur="5.22">history textbooks rewritten the</text>
  <text start="420.97" dur="5.04">statistics all you know messed with to</text>
  <text start="424.419" dur="4.111">try to make a show like it was the</text>
  <text start="426.01" dur="3.87">vaccine that caused the disease decrease</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="4.29">but it really wasn&amp;#39;t it was just better</text>
  <text start="429.88" dur="4.97">nutrition and sanitation but also with</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="6.24">polio specifically when it came out</text>
  <text start="434.85" dur="6.76">there was a redefinition of the disease</text>
  <text start="439.06" dur="5.52">polio was literally redefined so when</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="5.82">the vaccine came out people doctors just</text>
  <text start="444.58" dur="4.89">started saying that less and less people</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="5.1">had polio more and more people started</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="6.6">getting meningitis Wow</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="6.03">so do polio really go away maybe not</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="4.53">they might have just redefined it away</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="3.6">and polio actually still very much</text>
  <text start="460.6" dur="4.379">exists now when looking at this</text>
  <text start="462.16" dur="4.41">mysterious rare nervous system disorder</text>
  <text start="464.979" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s going around acute flaccid</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="6.39">mellitus if it looks like polio if it</text>
  <text start="470.169" dur="6.06">smells like polio it might just be polio</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="6.829">and not just with this afm disease but</text>
  <text start="476.229" dur="6.841">what about boolean beret huh</text>
  <text start="479.789" dur="6.461">people get vaccines they get these rare</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="4.92">nervous system disorders you know polio</text>
  <text start="486.25" dur="5.039">never went away guys it was just</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="5.16">redefined and now there&amp;#39;s all these rare</text>
  <text start="491.289" dur="3.541">nervous system disorders that stumped</text>
  <text start="493.15" dur="3.66">scientists because these scientists</text>
  <text start="494.83" dur="5.24">think that polio went away and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="5.789">just as brainwashed as many of us are so</text>
  <text start="500.07" dur="5.05">that&amp;#39;s again there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="502.599" dur="3.931">inconsistencies in their logic and dot&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.12" dur="3">that they don&amp;#39;t think about that they</text>
  <text start="506.53" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t bring into the picture because of</text>
  <text start="508.12" dur="7.109">their programming so point here guys</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="5.31">reject the poison reject the vaccines</text>
  <text start="515.229" dur="4.381">any of them you&amp;#39;ll do far better for</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="4.44">yourself with just a healthy lifestyle</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="4.68">than vaccines and this is probably why I</text>
  <text start="522.13" dur="4.68">check this article op from CBS News here</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="5.99">growing number of US children not</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="5.279">vaccinated against any disease so in</text>
  <text start="530.28" dur="4.239">2017 one</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="5.1">point three percent of the children born</text>
  <text start="534.519" dur="6.901">in 2015 were completely unvaccinated</text>
  <text start="537.189" dur="6.21">that&amp;#39;s up from 0.9% seen in a earlier</text>
  <text start="541.42" dur="6.419">similar assessment of the kids born in</text>
  <text start="543.399" dur="5.85">2011 so last year or basically what this</text>
  <text start="547.839" dur="4.35">is saying is that the rates of</text>
  <text start="549.249" dur="5.34">unvaccinated children jumped about 50</text>
  <text start="552.189" dur="6.57">percent in just a couple of years just a</text>
  <text start="554.589" dur="5.61">few short years that is well great news</text>
  <text start="558.759" dur="4.38">that means people are waking up</text>
  <text start="560.199" dur="6.08">what CBS tries to say here is that this</text>
  <text start="563.139" dur="5.221">is because parents are mislead they have</text>
  <text start="566.279" dur="6.011">misperceptions about the safety and</text>
  <text start="568.36" dur="5.61">importance of vaccines ha ha ha no in</text>
  <text start="572.29" dur="3.149">fact it looks like they&amp;#39;re getting more</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="3.299">educated they&amp;#39;re getting the correct</text>
  <text start="575.439" dur="3.781">perceptions and then completely</text>
  <text start="577.269" dur="2.94">rejecting the vaccines so of course</text>
  <text start="579.22" dur="2.82">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re seeing the huge</text>
  <text start="580.209" dur="4.411">propaganda push that&amp;#39;s why these</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="4.83">vaccines are getting expanded and all</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="4.319">this is going on to try to combat the</text>
  <text start="586.87" dur="4.649">fact that so many parents are waking up</text>
  <text start="588.939" dur="4.981">waking up across the board of course</text>
  <text start="591.519" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re seeing conspiracy theorists try to</text>
  <text start="593.92" dur="4.95">get ridiculed and discredited everywhere</text>
  <text start="595.449" dur="5.82">but the vaccine is just one topic many</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="5.73">people are waking up to and speaking of</text>
  <text start="601.269" dur="5.43">the CDC just one little note I want to</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="5.279">throw in there prosecutors aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="606.699" dur="5.721">offering X CDC chief a plea deal in sex</text>

  <text start="612.42" dur="5.019">wonderful organization always looking</text>
  <text start="614.559" dur="6.78">out for our best interest right sarcasm</text>
  <text start="617.439" dur="5.46">again the X CDC director is named dr.</text>
  <text start="621.339" dur="4.021">Thomas Frieden who stepped down earlier</text>
  <text start="622.899" dur="4.94">this year for a sex abuse case against</text>
  <text start="625.36" dur="5.61">him is no longer getting the plea deal</text>
  <text start="627.839" dur="5.68">hmm interesting I wonder if this is</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="3.9">actually because of sex abuse you know</text>
  <text start="633.519" dur="4.081">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of sexual misconduct</text>
  <text start="634.87" dur="3.959">and sexual abuse sexual abuse cases</text>

  <text start="640.629" dur="5.07">something else interesting to see what</text>
  <text start="643.6" dur="3.989">comes out about this all right so before</text>
  <text start="645.699" dur="3.87">we move on into talk of climate change</text>
  <text start="647.589" dur="3.781">and space want to make a shout out to a</text>

  <text start="668.2" dur="5.73">this video where you can do that okay so</text>
  <text start="670.51" dur="4.86">let&amp;#39;s talk about this IPCC report the</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="4.29">dire warnings of the United Nations</text>
  <text start="675.37" dur="4.95">latest climate change report as The New</text>
  <text start="678.22" dur="5.16">Yorker says of course they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="680.32" dur="8.45">scare you about it and what happened is</text>
  <text start="683.38" dur="7.92">basically the IPCC the IPCC is a body of</text>
  <text start="688.77" dur="5.14">scientists international scientists that</text>
  <text start="691.3" dur="5.16">have been the ones making these climate</text>
  <text start="693.91" dur="5.34">change reports and what they basically</text>
  <text start="696.46" dur="4.98">are they&amp;#39;re the scientists who write the</text>
  <text start="699.25" dur="3.42">carbon budgets there&amp;#39;s some bureaucrats</text>
  <text start="701.44" dur="3.63">scientists in my opinion they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="702.67" dur="4.169">probably paid off and they fiddle with</text>
  <text start="705.07" dur="4.2">the two statistics because statistics</text>
  <text start="706.839" dur="4.711">are very easy to fiddle with to make</text>
  <text start="709.27" dur="3.99">your narrative seem more legitimate</text>
  <text start="711.55" dur="3.479">so they fiddle the with the stats and</text>
  <text start="713.26" dur="3.69">then they put out these climate change</text>
  <text start="715.029" dur="3.301">reports now there&amp;#39;s a YouTube channel</text>
  <text start="716.95" dur="3.21">that I often watch called suspicious</text>
  <text start="718.33" dur="3.96">observers if you&amp;#39;re not familiar with it</text>
  <text start="720.16" dur="5.66">I highly suggest you check it out he</text>
  <text start="722.29" dur="7.53">does great work in completely</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="7.63">discrediting this IPCC body and all of</text>
  <text start="729.82" dur="5.37">these false reports that they put out</text>
  <text start="733.45" dur="4.8">with all the fake information in the</text>
  <text start="735.19" dur="6.66">fake news literally but what I want to</text>
  <text start="738.25" dur="7.08">focus on here is the propaganda pushes</text>
  <text start="741.85" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing going alongside that IPCC</text>
  <text start="745.33" dur="5.04">report because of course people are</text>
  <text start="748.18" dur="4.77">always easier to control when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.37" dur="4.74">scared right and what&amp;#39;s more scary than</text>
  <text start="752.95" dur="5.31">to think that oh the ecosystems of our</text>
  <text start="755.11" dur="5.64">planet are deteriorating and we&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="758.26" dur="5.85">cause they tried to continuously blame</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="4.95">us as the cause well heck it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="764.11" dur="3.81">to scare people that way and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="765.7" dur="4.41">easy to bring out your agendas with that</text>
  <text start="767.92" dur="4.05">right I&amp;#39;m just gonna say right here</text>
  <text start="770.11" dur="4.02">my personal belief yes I think the</text>
  <text start="771.97" dur="4.86">climate is changing but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="774.13" dur="4.62">humans are the true cause of that I</text>
  <text start="776.83" dur="3.9">think there&amp;#39;s many other factors in play</text>
  <text start="778.75" dur="4.2">they don&amp;#39;t like to tell us that in fact</text>
  <text start="780.73" dur="4.95">our whole solar system is electrically</text>
  <text start="782.95" dur="4.71">changing our Sun influences weather</text>
  <text start="785.68" dur="3.51">patterns that&amp;#39;s a fact they often leave</text>
  <text start="787.66" dur="4.53">out in these climate change reports our</text>
  <text start="789.19" dur="6.389">Sun is changing so thus thus our earth</text>
  <text start="792.19" dur="5.28">is changing and not only that but</text>
  <text start="795.579" dur="3.601">there&amp;#39;s a lot of geoengineering programs</text>
  <text start="797.47" dur="3.09">going on that are also if</text>
  <text start="799.18" dur="3">acting the climate that they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="800.56" dur="3.33">us about right we&amp;#39;ll talk about in the</text>
  <text start="802.18" dur="5.1">minute here but what I want to first</text>
  <text start="803.89" dur="5.52">make a note on is the renewable energy</text>
  <text start="807.28" dur="3.9">push going on with this climate change</text>
  <text start="809.41" dur="4.05">report the New York Times right here</text>
  <text start="811.18" dur="4.56">says these funds aim to power their</text>
  <text start="813.46" dur="4.29">returns with clean energy and not only</text>
  <text start="815.74" dur="4.32">that but the Washington Post our two</text>
  <text start="817.75" dur="4.08">favorite news outlets right two favorite</text>
  <text start="820.06" dur="5.22">ones they tell us so much truth</text>
  <text start="821.83" dur="5.82">again more sarcasm sarcasm full episode</text>
  <text start="825.28" dur="3.87">here Washington Post says climate bill</text>
  <text start="827.65" dur="5.97">would move DC to a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="829.15" dur="7.74">renewable energy by 2032 okay so on the</text>
  <text start="833.62" dur="5.52">surface level you&amp;#39;ll say oh great</text>
  <text start="836.89" dur="4.05">alternative energy renewable energy we</text>
  <text start="839.14" dur="5.01">need that so it&amp;#39;s fantastic that this is</text>
  <text start="840.94" dur="6.57">happening but on a deeper level</text>
  <text start="844.15" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s actually a lot of horseshit because</text>
  <text start="847.51" dur="6.03">these renewable energies the ones that</text>
  <text start="850.63" dur="6.54">they let into the public domain they are</text>
  <text start="853.54" dur="5.7">number one horribly inefficient all of</text>
  <text start="857.17" dur="5.67">the more efficient renewable energy</text>
  <text start="859.24" dur="6.69">sources they keep classified not only</text>
  <text start="862.84" dur="6.03">that but it takes a lot of resources to</text>
  <text start="865.93" dur="6.21">mine the metals for the solar cells to</text>
  <text start="868.87" dur="6.33">mine the metals for those giant fans the</text>
  <text start="872.14" dur="5.46">wind energy that you see scouring the</text>
  <text start="875.2" dur="4.29">countryside it takes a lot of resources</text>
  <text start="877.6" dur="6.18">for that nuclear power and nuclear power</text>
  <text start="879.49" dur="6.6">is super dangerous so all of the</text>
  <text start="883.78" dur="4.08">alternative energy that they push is</text>
  <text start="886.09" dur="3.99">stuff that&amp;#39;s only gonna make them money</text>
  <text start="887.86" dur="5.4">and not really do all that much for</text>
  <text start="890.08" dur="6.36">society here these alternative renewable</text>
  <text start="893.26" dur="5.94">energies is just a smokescreen to hide</text>
  <text start="896.44" dur="4.92">the free energy away from the public</text>
  <text start="899.2" dur="3.57">right people don&amp;#39;t even think about that</text>
  <text start="901.36" dur="4.05">often times when they think of</text>
  <text start="902.77" dur="5">alternative or renewable energy in these</text>
  <text start="905.41" dur="4.44">sorts of ways what about the free energy</text>
  <text start="907.77" dur="4.57">systems that have been developed for</text>
  <text start="909.85" dur="5.52">decades and decades by many inventors</text>
  <text start="912.34" dur="5.55">that are amazingly efficient that can</text>
  <text start="915.37" dur="4.41">produce over unity they can actually</text>
  <text start="917.89" dur="4.14">produce more electricity than it takes</text>
  <text start="919.78" dur="3.93">to run them over unity devices what</text>
  <text start="922.03" dur="3.66">happened to all those event inventors</text>
  <text start="923.71" dur="4.5">that have invented these things why</text>
  <text start="925.69" dur="4.05">haven&amp;#39;t these technologies gotten to the</text>
  <text start="928.21" dur="4.53">public why are they still kept</text>
  <text start="929.74" dur="5.52">classified right askers</text>
  <text start="932.74" dur="4.77">these questions so this propaganda push</text>
  <text start="935.26" dur="3.84">in terms of renewable energy is just a</text>
  <text start="937.51" dur="4.17">giant smokescreen it always has been</text>
  <text start="939.1" dur="5.16">what about free energy and not only that</text>
  <text start="941.68" dur="3.42">but the geoengineering push so let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="944.26" dur="3.87">on that topic</text>
  <text start="945.1" dur="4.95">the IPCC authors check this out an</text>
  <text start="948.13" dur="5.31">article by The Guardian that came out</text>
  <text start="950.05" dur="5.58">just days after that IPCC report it says</text>
  <text start="953.44" dur="4.62">IPCC authors suggest that there is a</text>
  <text start="955.63" dur="4.98">high agreement that injection of</text>
  <text start="958.06" dur="4.56">chemicals into the stratosphere could</text>
  <text start="960.61" dur="3.63">help limit Rises they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="962.62" dur="4.35">geoengineering may be used to combat</text>
  <text start="964.24" dur="4.83">global warming so that high agreement</text>
  <text start="966.97" dur="4.02">between those scientists was basically</text>
  <text start="969.07" dur="4.32">the high amount of dollars they were</text>
  <text start="970.99" dur="5.73">paid off to say these particular things</text>
  <text start="973.39" dur="7.86">ha ha money can sure make greedy people</text>
  <text start="976.72" dur="6.96">agree right so they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="981.25" dur="4.589">that geoengineering programs need to be</text>
  <text start="983.68" dur="4.95">used to combat global warming but again</text>
  <text start="985.839" dur="5.31">what they don&amp;#39;t say is the fact that</text>
  <text start="988.63" dur="4.92">these geoengineering programs these</text>
  <text start="991.149" dur="5.431">aerosols have been sprayed over our</text>
  <text start="993.55" dur="4.26">heads in secret for decades it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="996.58" dur="3.09">even in the secret you can see these</text>
  <text start="997.81" dur="3.149">aerosol aerosols get sprayed over your</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="3.27">head every single day</text>
  <text start="1000.959" dur="3.391">often times but what they don&amp;#39;t tell you</text>
  <text start="1002.94" dur="4.2">is that these have been going on for</text>
  <text start="1004.35" dur="6.989">decades and in fact one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="1007.14" dur="6">our localized climates are changing so</text>
  <text start="1011.339" dur="4.111">much is because of these geoengineering</text>
  <text start="1013.14" dur="4.08">programs they spray over the west coast</text>
  <text start="1015.45" dur="2.759">that makes the west coast of America</text>
  <text start="1017.22" dur="3.45">drier</text>
  <text start="1018.209" dur="5.161">hence California drought and then when</text>
  <text start="1020.67" dur="5.25">these particulates that they spray move</text>
  <text start="1023.37" dur="4.68">inland in the weather tracks it actually</text>
  <text start="1025.92" dur="3.72">makes the East Coast wetter that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1028.05" dur="3.69">the Northeast has been getting so much</text>
  <text start="1029.64" dur="4.439">damn rain that&amp;#39;s why these hurricanes in</text>
  <text start="1031.74" dur="6.829">the south southeast are getting so much</text>
  <text start="1034.079" dur="4.49">bigger and more intense and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1038.72" dur="3.369">thunderstorms lightning storms are</text>
  <text start="1041.01" dur="2.61">getting more intense</text>
  <text start="1042.089" dur="3.23">everywhere is because with all this</text>
  <text start="1043.62" dur="3.93">aluminum all these conductive</text>
  <text start="1045.319" dur="4.571">electrically conductive particles in the</text>
  <text start="1047.55" dur="4.29">atmosphere makes all these lightning</text>
  <text start="1049.89" dur="4.8">storms bigger makes the west coast drier</text>
  <text start="1051.84" dur="6.39">East Coast wetter Wow who would have</text>
  <text start="1054.69" dur="6.479">thunk climate change yeah you could say</text>
  <text start="1058.23" dur="5.699">is human cost but it&amp;#39;s not carbon cost</text>
  <text start="1061.169" dur="4.951">it&amp;#39;s what the heck are they spraying in</text>
  <text start="1063.929" dur="4.861">the atmosphere caused you see</text>
  <text start="1066.12" dur="4.29">man the spin zone it&amp;#39;s so easy to spin</text>
  <text start="1068.79" dur="4.11">these narratives whether it&amp;#39;s with</text>
