  <text start="641.51" dur="5.22">about al Baghdadi being killed the other</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="5.43">morning and I did notice that I noticed</text>
  <text start="646.73" dur="5.79">when he said well we&amp;#39;ve been surveying</text>
  <text start="649.55" dur="5.07">Baghdady for about a couple of weeks and</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="4.14">I found that interesting and some other</text>
  <text start="654.62" dur="3.81">people out there did too and this guy</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="4.26">then says I think Pelosi met with</text>

  <text start="668.55" dur="3.719">it&amp;#39;s good that&amp;#39;s good thinking there</text>
  <text start="669.899" dur="3.511">that&amp;#39;s good thinking and then also this</text>
  <text start="672.269" dur="3.771">international news</text>
  <text start="673.41" dur="5.67">Israel&amp;#39;s embassies being shut down</text>
  <text start="676.04" dur="4.54">worldwide as some of their envoys are</text>
  <text start="679.08" dur="3.09">going on strike at least that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="680.58" dur="3.569">reason that we&amp;#39;re being told about this</text>
  <text start="682.17" dur="6">so what it says here is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="684.149" dur="6.211">basically a dispute between foreign and</text>
  <text start="688.17" dur="4.77">defense ministries in Israel over</text>
  <text start="690.36" dur="4.59">expense depends basically over money on</text>
  <text start="692.94" dur="3.51">boys not getting paid now again that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.95" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s the excuse that&amp;#39;s the reason</text>
  <text start="696.45" dur="4.199">we&amp;#39;re being told about this I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="698.64" dur="4.29">it seems a little odd that like</text>
  <text start="700.649" dur="5.13">worldwide they would close all the</text>
  <text start="702.93" dur="6.18">embassies and consulates like that over</text>
  <text start="705.779" dur="6.781">like a step in dispute I don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="5.7">some people as well are making the</text>
  <text start="712.56" dur="4.08">attempt to connect maybe this to</text>
  <text start="714.81" dur="4.709">whatever intelligence that they captured</text>
  <text start="716.64" dur="5.61">with Baghdad II Isis and maybe</text>
  <text start="719.519" dur="5.461">connecting some or maybe connecting Isis</text>
  <text start="722.25" dur="5.13">to Mossad or some deep state elements in</text>
  <text start="724.98" dur="4.229">Israel now why this happened are they</text>
  <text start="727.38" dur="4.649">shutting down asylum to anybody trying</text>
  <text start="729.209" dur="4.591">to seek asylum at an Israeli embassy you</text>
  <text start="732.029" dur="3.271">know look at how many people and our</text>
  <text start="733.8" dur="2.67">government or at least I know a few</text>
  <text start="735.3" dur="3.75">years ago a lot of them had dual</text>
  <text start="736.47" dur="4.83">citizenship you know I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="739.05" dur="4.95">exactly what the case is now but some</text>
  <text start="741.3" dur="4.92">interesting dots to connect their FISA</text>
  <text start="744" dur="4.079">being brought up by Fox News you know</text>
  <text start="746.22" dur="5.48">they&amp;#39;re just continuously reminding us</text>
  <text start="748.079" dur="6.51">about that impending FISA IG report and</text>
  <text start="751.7" dur="4.78">the conclusion to Durham&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="754.589" dur="4.081">so every day they&amp;#39;re reminding us</text>
  <text start="756.48" dur="4.919">because that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one of the big</text>
  <text start="758.67" dur="5.159">cards that still has yet to be played</text>
  <text start="761.399" dur="4.981">and it&amp;#39;s my opinion going to be played</text>
  <text start="763.829" dur="7.111">very soon but it&amp;#39;s a very strategic card</text>
  <text start="766.38" dur="6.54">they have and you know the big one let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.94" dur="5.07">see here let&amp;#39;s move on to Flynn&amp;#39;s case</text>
  <text start="772.92" dur="5.159">so looks like Flynn&amp;#39;s case General</text>
  <text start="776.01" dur="5.16">Michael Flint&amp;#39;s case could be getting</text>
  <text start="778.079" dur="4.771">very close to get being thrown out so</text>
  <text start="781.17" dur="3.029">the Federalists here judged telling the</text>
  <text start="782.85" dur="3.9">government to respond to allegations</text>
  <text start="784.199" dur="6.181">that hid evidence from Michael Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="786.75" dur="7.17">legal team Michael Flynn&amp;#39;s badass lawyer</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="6.149">Sidney Powell filed a brief the other</text>
  <text start="793.92" dur="4.56">day claiming that the federal government</text>
  <text start="796.529" dur="5.191">was withholding exculpatory evidence</text>
  <text start="798.48" dur="3.75">that would clear Flynn&amp;#39;s name and the</text>
  <text start="801.72" dur="2.04">judge</text>
  <text start="802.23" dur="5.31">the case the judge in Flint&amp;#39;s case</text>
  <text start="803.76" dur="9.24">basically cancelled a motion like</text>
  <text start="807.54" dur="7.65">cancelled the next court hearing to let</text>
  <text start="813" dur="4.65">the federal government respond to this</text>
  <text start="815.19" dur="3.57">so as the author of this points out it</text>
  <text start="817.65" dur="2.55">could mean two things could mean</text>
  <text start="818.76" dur="3.66">Sullivan had found the briefing</text>
  <text start="820.2" dur="5.13">sufficiently clear to allow him to</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="5.85">render a decision on Powell&amp;#39;s motion or</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="5.25">he&amp;#39;s just given him more time to respond</text>
  <text start="828.27" dur="3.84">so getting close to Flynn&amp;#39;s case getting</text>
  <text start="830.58" dur="4.92">thrown out which is great that has</text>
  <text start="832.11" dur="6.39">everything to do with FISA as well</text>
  <text start="835.5" dur="5.91">the epic times here talking about the</text>
  <text start="838.5" dur="4.89">finders disclosures I mentioned this a</text>
  <text start="841.41" dur="3.78">couple of videos ago and I&amp;#39;ve seen a few</text>
  <text start="843.39" dur="5.75">people on Twitter talked about it but I</text>
  <text start="845.19" dur="7.59">have seen zero mainstream media</text>
  <text start="849.14" dur="5.38">organizations discuss this except from</text>
  <text start="852.78" dur="4.23">the epic times and like a handful of</text>
  <text start="854.52" dur="5.04">them it says right here the FBI releases</text>
  <text start="857.01" dur="6.12">information on the finders a secretive</text>
  <text start="859.56" dur="5.73">group accused of child sex abuse and if</text>
  <text start="863.13" dur="3.9">you dig into these documents you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="865.29" dur="3.93">actually find that they could have they</text>
  <text start="867.03" dur="4.95">could have had intelligence community</text>
  <text start="869.22" dur="5.22">connects back in the 80s maybe the CIA</text>
  <text start="871.98" dur="4.56">covered him covering for him or having</text>
  <text start="874.44" dur="4.08">connections there so a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="876.54" dur="3.3">coming to light a lot of dark coming to</text>
  <text start="878.52" dur="4.38">light guys that&amp;#39;s why I often say you</text>
  <text start="879.84" dur="6.6">know disclosure is everything it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="882.9" dur="5.46">just UFOs it&amp;#39;s not just the legal FISA</text>
  <text start="886.44" dur="5.61">spying it was it&amp;#39;s everything</text>
  <text start="888.36" dur="6.33">everything and it&amp;#39;s not some like</text>
  <text start="892.05" dur="5.54">one-off de disclosure day it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="894.69" dur="5.43">process it&amp;#39;s always ongoing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="897.59" dur="4.12">going through the thick of it right now</text>
  <text start="900.12" dur="2.81">and the last couple things I want to</text>
  <text start="901.71" dur="4.23">share with you guys</text>
  <text start="902.93" dur="6.12">have to do with space you know that part</text>
  <text start="905.94" dur="5.79">of disclosure this article going around</text>
  <text start="909.05" dur="4.27">last couple of days is this Air Force</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="3.24">space plane you&amp;#39;ve probably seen this</text>
  <text start="913.32" dur="2.97">before there&amp;#39;s been articles about it in</text>
  <text start="914.97" dur="4.2">the media over the last couple of years</text>
  <text start="916.29" dur="4.77">as long as it&amp;#39;s been up in space but</text>
  <text start="919.17" dur="5.1">this what they&amp;#39;re calling top top secret</text>
  <text start="921.06" dur="5.58">space plane lands in Florida after</text>
  <text start="924.27" dur="7.08">spending over two years in orbit this is</text>
  <text start="926.64" dur="6.33">that x37 secret space plane granted if</text>
  <text start="931.35" dur="4.28">there&amp;#39;s a Gizmodo article being ran</text>
  <text start="932.97" dur="5.39">about it how secret is it really</text>
  <text start="935.63" dur="5.55">and the point here that I want to make</text>
  <text start="938.36" dur="5.399">is that you gotta understand how much in</text>
  <text start="941.18" dur="4.92">regards to space that we&amp;#39;ve been given</text>
  <text start="943.759" dur="5.31">over the last 50 years is all a</text>
  <text start="946.1" dur="5.429">smokescreen it&amp;#39;s a smokescreen it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="949.069" dur="4.291">facade it&amp;#39;s you know they&amp;#39;re putting all</text>
  <text start="951.529" dur="4.021">this stuff out into the public domain to</text>
  <text start="953.36" dur="4.529">make you think it&amp;#39;s the latest and</text>
  <text start="955.55" dur="4.89">greatest in most advanced and research</text>
  <text start="957.889" dur="5.37">and development when they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="960.44" dur="6.6">keeping the most advanced stuff far far</text>
  <text start="963.259" dur="6.091">away from the media way and the secret</text>
  <text start="967.04" dur="4.83">programs in the basement right this</text>
  <text start="969.35" dur="5.07">right here you can see it&amp;#39;s a glorified</text>
  <text start="971.87" dur="6.36">Space Shuttle basically still using</text>
  <text start="974.42" dur="5.07">rockets still unmanned as they say it</text>

  <text start="979.49" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t even use the sort of stuff that</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="4.32">the black projects figured out 50 60</text>
  <text start="983.69" dur="6.54">years ago you know and when I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="985.79" dur="7.799">about space and full UFO disclosure I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="993.589" dur="3.12">corporations and some government</text>
  <text start="995.36" dur="3.959">entities on our earth they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="996.709" dur="4.771">anti-gravity technology since the 50s if</text>
  <text start="999.319" dur="4.681">not earlier they&amp;#39;ve spent billions if</text>
  <text start="1001.48" dur="4.799">not probably trillions of dollars with</text>
  <text start="1004" dur="4.56">these projects developing out these</text>
