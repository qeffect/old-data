  <text start="177.72" dur="5.58">people are waking up to the truth the</text>

  <text start="186.27" dur="5.46">investors dot-com article here</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s discussing how Obama was leading</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="4.74">basically a military purge he was</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="5.79">getting rid of hundreds of military</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="6.66">officers during his time in office and</text>
  <text start="199.77" dur="6.35">President Obama fired a bunch of these</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="6">military officers for all the most</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="4.86">ridiculous reasons from leaving blast</text>

  <text start="215.58" dur="7.2">military was being gutted q goes on to</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="5.25">say why did Obama attempt to destroy our</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="5.7">military weaken it what was the sixteen</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="6.39">year plan to destroy America that 16</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="5.009">year plan was basically eight years</text>

  <text start="238.38" dur="4.77">which was the plan the deep state plan</text>
  <text start="240.33" dur="4.65">in 2016 then we could essentially have</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="3.51">World War three and America would be</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="3.99">ruined because our military would be</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="4.98">extremely weakened by them but luckily</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="5.34">we avoided that with President Trump</text>
  <text start="251.64" dur="4.95">why did Hussein install traitors at the</text>

  <text start="276.84" dur="3.51">into the White House who hate America</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="4.29">and what we stand for what years did</text>

  <text start="282.72" dur="4.2">Obama years what years did Isis expand</text>

  <text start="341.669" dur="4.711">many other people they don&amp;#39;t want a wall</text>

  <text start="381.21" dur="4.709">not a full government shutdown I see a</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="4.17">lot of fear porn being pumped out like</text>
  <text start="385.919" dur="4.981">always in the deep state corporate</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="4.8">propaganda media as I call it but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="4.23">only a partial government shutdown and</text>
  <text start="392.76" dur="4.62">this is nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="395.13" dur="4.71">something like this actually happens</text>
  <text start="397.38" dur="3.96">quite frequently so it&amp;#39;s nothing to be</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="2.97">concerned about</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="3.66">this partial shutdown is now going to</text>
  <text start="402.81" dur="5.04">after Christmas but it&amp;#39;s for that border</text>
  <text start="405" dur="5.43">wall funding five billion dollars for</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="6.15">that wall and it goes to note right here</text>
  <text start="410.43" dur="7.62">the reason why this border security is</text>
  <text start="414" dur="8.19">being so pushed for is because of really</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="6.78">actually deep dark deep state operations</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="5.49">human trafficking drug trafficking</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="5.309">bringing ms-13 which is basically deep</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="4.68">state hired hitmen over the border these</text>
  <text start="430.139" dur="4.351">the real reasons why we need border</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="4.79">security and we have so many political</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="5.13">puppets out there right now both</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="4.69">Democrats and some Republicans even</text>
  <text start="439.62" dur="4.68">voting against this border security at</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="6.36">the border wall they are just being paid</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="5.7">off political puppets trying to advocate</text>
  <text start="448.2" dur="4.65">against the border security and the wall</text>
  <text start="450" dur="5.61">but screw them we need it don&amp;#39;t let them</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="5.16">get you wrong now moving on into talking</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="5.4">about the Federal Reserve so Trump</text>
  <text start="458.01" dur="6.42">reportedly considering firing Fed chair</text>
  <text start="461.01" dur="5.43">Powell but the Treasury Secretary denies</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="3.48">that so some reports coming out of the</text>
  <text start="466.44" dur="3.9">mainstream media over the past couple</text>
  <text start="467.91" dur="5.129">days are claiming that Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="6.63">wants to fire the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="473.039" dur="5.731">Chairman Jerome Powell but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="476.97" dur="4.23">little bit of political backtracking</text>
  <text start="478.77" dur="5.1">sort of going on with that the Treasury</text>
  <text start="481.2" dur="4.29">secretary Stephen minuchin I think is</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="4.08">how you say his last name tweeted</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="6">yesterday that he spoke with President</text>
  <text start="487.95" dur="5.82">Trump and Trump said as the Treasury</text>
  <text start="491.49" dur="4.44">Secretary claimed I totally disagree</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="4.05">with Fed policy I think increasing the</text>
  <text start="495.93" dur="4.709">interest rates and shrinking of the Fed</text>
  <text start="497.82" dur="5.7">portfolio is ridiculous but I never</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="5.221">suggested in firing chairman Jay Powell</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="4.86">nor do I believe I have the right to do</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="4.26">so so like I mentioned could be some</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="4.079">political backtracking we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="4.62">know if Donald Trump even suggested</text>
  <text start="512.459" dur="4.531">firing the Fed chairman these were just</text>
  <text start="514.74" dur="4.71">reports in the mainstream media but I</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="5.34">will personally say here I am all for</text>
  <text start="519.45" dur="4.74">that faired Fed Chairman being fired I</text>
  <text start="522.33" dur="4.29">think it&amp;#39;s ridiculous that the interest</text>
  <text start="524.19" dur="5.43">rates were raised yet again fourth time</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="4.95">now under Trump&amp;#39;s presidency do you know</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="4.68">how many times under Obama the Fed rates</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="3.63">raised zero zero times in eight years</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ve our</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="4.89">for in two years you know why because</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="4.02">they want a spike Trump they want to</text>
  <text start="540.09" dur="3.9">basically destroy America the Federal</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="4.35">Reserve is ridiculous it&amp;#39;s not even a</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="5.91">public institution it&amp;#39;s its own private</text>
  <text start="546.36" dur="5.88">agency so I think we shouldn&amp;#39;t just stop</text>
  <text start="549.9" dur="3.69">at firing the Fed Chairman I think let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="4.02">just burn down the whole Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="553.59" dur="5.04">sounds like a good idea to me and the</text>
  <text start="556.26" dur="6.57">Fed now moving on to talking about that</text>

  <text start="765.15" dur="4.32">out of the public that they already know</text>
  <text start="767.01" dur="4.83">is going to happen the public goes oh my</text>
  <text start="769.47" dur="5.04">gosh we need vaccines we need you to</text>
  <text start="771.84" dur="4.2">protect us from these diseases little</text>
  <text start="774.51" dur="3.24">does the public know that these diseases</text>
  <text start="776.04" dur="4.8">were created by the deep state so</text>
  <text start="777.75" dur="5.28">problem reaction and then the solution</text>
  <text start="780.84" dur="4.44">here is the vaccines that the people are</text>
  <text start="783.03" dur="5.73">clamoring for right so problem reaction</text>
  <text start="785.28" dur="5.58">solution in effect right here but I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="795.99" dur="5.97">about little more topics on health this</text>
  <text start="799.56" dur="4.67">is being reported in</text>
  <text start="801.96" dur="5.01">local CBS outlet in Philadelphia</text>
  <text start="804.23" dur="5.62">controversial treatment trance fuses</text>
  <text start="806.97" dur="6.39">patients with young blood from teenagers</text>
  <text start="809.85" dur="6.24">to reverse the aging process so this is</text>
  <text start="813.36" dur="4.2">that disgusting company this has</text>
  <text start="816.09" dur="3.9">actually been reported on in the</text>
  <text start="817.56" dur="4.35">mainstream media quite a few times this</text>
  <text start="819.99" dur="3.78">year there was a round of articles that</text>
  <text start="821.91" dur="5.28">came out back in September about this</text>
  <text start="823.77" dur="6.51">but basically it is about that company</text>
  <text start="827.19" dur="6.42">called ambrosia ambrosia medical that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.28" dur="7.07">headed by dr. Jesse Karmazin</text>
  <text start="833.61" dur="7.98">and they are offering their patients</text>
  <text start="837.35" dur="6.4">$8,000 transfusions for young patients</text>
  <text start="841.59" dur="5.36">bloods basically it&amp;#39;s like teenagers</text>
  <text start="843.75" dur="6.45">Bloods to get some health benefits from</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="5.64">because they claim that young people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="850.2" dur="5.25">blood has what&amp;#39;s called PRP s</text>
  <text start="852.59" dur="4.54">platelet-rich plasma in it and you can</text>
  <text start="855.45" dur="3.45">get a bunch of health benefits by</text>
  <text start="857.13" dur="4.02">injecting yourself with young people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.9" dur="5.91">Bloods</text>
  <text start="861.15" dur="6.27">that just sounds disgusting and also</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="4.71">goes to note here you can get PRPs you</text>
  <text start="867.42" dur="5.34">can get this platelet-rich plasma in</text>
  <text start="869.52" dur="5.64">your body from your own blood right you</text>
  <text start="872.76" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t need young people other people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="875.16" dur="4.2">blood for it you just can use your own</text>
  <text start="877.5" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s many other ways you can get PRPs</text>
  <text start="879.36" dur="5.49">into your body to help yourself out to</text>
  <text start="882.24" dur="3.78">get health benefits from so this is just</text>
  <text start="884.85" dur="5.36">gross and I think they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="886.02" dur="6.75">normalize the idea into the public of</text>
  <text start="890.21" dur="4.6">using number one young people&amp;#39;s blood</text>
  <text start="892.77" dur="6.15">cough adrenochrome cough cough</text>
  <text start="894.81" dur="7.23">disgusting and number two normalize the</text>
  <text start="898.92" dur="5.25">use of just this nastiness so another</text>
  <text start="902.04" dur="3.54">thing I&amp;#39;m completely rejecting and now</text>
  <text start="904.17" dur="5.31">last topic that I want to discuss here</text>
  <text start="905.58" dur="7.17">with you guys is space so number one</text>
  <text start="909.48" dur="5.85">first that quantum initiative Act so</text>
  <text start="912.75" dur="5.28">this was passed by the Senate signed</text>
  <text start="915.33" dur="5.49">into law by Trump this week Trump signs</text>
  <text start="918.03" dur="6.69">legislation to boost quantum research</text>
  <text start="920.82" dur="6.81">with 1.2 billion dollars that quantum</text>
  <text start="924.72" dur="5.31">initiative Act authorizes over a billion</text>
  <text start="927.63" dur="5.13">dollars over five years to boost</text>
  <text start="930.03" dur="5.52">investment in quantum information</text>
  <text start="932.76" dur="6.62">science so this is very</text>
  <text start="935.55" dur="6.479">newse the idea of these you know</text>
  <text start="939.38" dur="3.49">alternative advanced sciences making out</text>
  <text start="942.029" dur="3.601">into the public domain</text>
  <text start="942.87" dur="5.279">the current administration boosting</text>
  <text start="945.63" dur="5.1">research for it very good news</text>
  <text start="948.149" dur="5.821">and I also found this in mainstream</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="5.91">media mainstream science reporting</text>
  <text start="953.97" dur="5.25">satellite study proves global quantum</text>
  <text start="956.64" dur="6.319">communication will be possible this was</text>
  <text start="959.22" dur="6.72">a study done out of Italy and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="962.959" dur="5.201">light version of what&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="965.94" dur="4.05">possible you know I&amp;#39;m sure in the black</text>
  <text start="968.16" dur="4.799">projects and the secret space programs</text>
  <text start="969.99" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;ve had this sort of science for</text>
  <text start="972.959" dur="3.06">decades and decades and much more</text>
  <text start="974.339" dur="3.901">advanced stuff than it but basically</text>
  <text start="976.019" dur="3.601">what this is doing being reported on in</text>
  <text start="978.24" dur="2.789">the mainstream which is good you know</text>
  <text start="979.62" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s pushing the envelope it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="981.029" dur="4.981">people&amp;#39;s the mass consciousness open to</text>
  <text start="983.97" dur="4.38">it they&amp;#39;re saying that they transported</text>
  <text start="986.01" dur="5.97">a single photon over the distance of</text>
  <text start="988.35" dur="6.12">20,000 kilometers so okay single photon</text>
  <text start="991.98" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s not much but we&amp;#39;re improving you</text>
  <text start="994.47" dur="5.01">know soon it&amp;#39;ll be communications it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="997.89" dur="4.98">be full like text messages and phone</text>
  <text start="999.48" dur="5.099">calls and then heck a craft right I mean</text>
  <text start="1002.87" dur="3.36">when you actually look into these black</text>
  <text start="1004.579" dur="4.051">projects and how it operates a lot of</text>
  <text start="1006.23" dur="4.59">these craft freakin tr3 bees they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1008.63" dur="4.949">basically quantum transporters they go</text>
  <text start="1010.82" dur="5.28">point-to-point right again a lot of</text>
  <text start="1013.579" dur="5.431">science behind all of this science we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1016.1" dur="5.54">not often taught but this idea of</text>
  <text start="1019.01" dur="6.75">quantum transportation not just with</text>
  <text start="1021.64" dur="5.77">data but a craft or a human itself as</text>
  <text start="1025.76" dur="2.569">the information transporting it from</text>
  <text start="1027.41" dur="4.019">point to point</text>
  <text start="1028.329" dur="5.321">mm-hmm it&amp;#39;s coming guys it&amp;#39;s coming and</text>
  <text start="1031.429" dur="5.851">now let&amp;#39;s talk about one last thing here</text>
  <text start="1033.65" dur="6.029">in the space force so Trump&amp;#39;s new space</text>
  <text start="1037.28" dur="5.25">force to reside under the Department of</text>
  <text start="1039.679" dur="6.451">the Air Force so this looks to be a sort</text>
  <text start="1042.53" dur="5.49">of compromise here there is news coming</text>
  <text start="1046.13" dur="3.72">out that there&amp;#39;s a proposal going around</text>
  <text start="1048.02" dur="5.25">to put the space force under the Air</text>
  <text start="1049.85" dur="5.94">Force but this proposal has not been</text>
  <text start="1053.27" dur="5.61">publicized yet this is just being</text>
  <text start="1055.79" dur="4.83">reported on and claimed to be seen by</text>
  <text start="1058.88" dur="4.049">defense news here so we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="1060.62" dur="4.98">actually happens with the space force</text>
  <text start="1062.929" dur="4.561">and very last article here let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="1065.6" dur="2.97">about that Pentagon audit so the</text>
  <text start="1067.49" dur="3.809">Washington</text>
  <text start="1068.57" dur="6">a meaner mainstream outlet we&amp;#39;re finally</text>
  <text start="1071.299" dur="5.701">seeing a mainstream media source report</text>
  <text start="1074.57" dur="4.439">on that audit and they&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="1077" dur="5.519">the Pentagon failed and audit it never</text>
  <text start="1079.009" dur="6.061">expected or tried to pass so again</text>
  <text start="1082.519" dur="4.951">finally mainstream media catching up</text>
  <text start="1085.07" dur="5.52">reporting on this audit and I&amp;#39;m happy to</text>
  <text start="1087.47" dur="7.289">see in the Washington Examiner here they</text>
  <text start="1090.59" dur="6.51">are reporting on the 2016 DoD Inspector</text>
  <text start="1094.759" dur="4.29">General report that mentioned six point</text>
  <text start="1097.1" dur="5.939">five trillion dollars worth of the</text>
  <text start="1099.049" dur="5.85">year-end miss adjustments right so this</text>
  <text start="1103.039" dur="4.051">is great news a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1104.899" dur="4.951">information getting into that mass</text>
  <text start="1107.09" dur="5.91">consciousness that public&amp;#39;s fear about a</text>
  <text start="1109.85" dur="6.449">lot of money essentially missing from</text>
  <text start="1113" dur="7.019">the DoD budget right and this Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1116.299" dur="6.36">audit that was completed a little over a</text>
  <text start="1120.019" dur="4.231">month ago November 15th it&amp;#39;s finally</text>
  <text start="1122.659" dur="4.951">getting into that public domain so</text>
  <text start="1124.25" dur="6.45">that&amp;#39;s good to see but I really hope</text>
  <text start="1127.61" dur="5.1">that space force comes to fruition as</text>
  <text start="1130.7" dur="3.9">its own independent branch of the</text>
  <text start="1132.71" dur="3.66">military and I really hope that we learn</text>
  <text start="1134.6" dur="3.419">a whole lot more about where that</text>
  <text start="1136.37" dur="3.539">missing money from the Pentagon went</text>
  <text start="1138.019" dur="4.65">because of course where did it go</text>
  <text start="1139.909" dur="7.071">secret space programs black projects</text>
  <text start="1142.669" dur="6.331">that have amazing quantum sciences</text>
  <text start="1146.98" dur="4.36">mind-blowing Sciences that are far</text>
  <text start="1149" dur="5.07">beyond what we&amp;#39;re told in mainstream</text>
  <text start="1151.34" dur="4.38">education systems and these black</text>
  <text start="1154.07" dur="3.089">projects these sacred space programs</text>
  <text start="1155.72" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;ve been in development for decades</text>

  <text start="1159.44" dur="4.739">and with that advanced research that I</text>
  <text start="1161.149" dur="5.25">was just mentioning so this is where</text>
  <text start="1164.179" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re headed with disclosure guys big</text>
  <text start="1166.399" dur="4.74">picture stuff we are seeing where</text>
  <text start="1168.889" dur="4.89">trillions of dollars went we want the</text>
