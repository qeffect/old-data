  <text start="38.84" dur="4.23">forward to chatting about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="40.46" dur="4.86">happening in the world totally man so I</text>
  <text start="43.07" dur="4.379">want to talk about gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="45.32" dur="3.84">then the stock market so you sent me a</text>
  <text start="47.449" dur="4.411">couple of articles that had the chance</text>
  <text start="49.16" dur="4.98">to preview one of them was by Business</text>
  <text start="51.86" dur="4.769">Insider they were saying that a</text>
  <text start="54.14" dur="4.379">billionaire is sounding an alarm on the</text>
  <text start="56.629" dur="3.36">gold shortage and that basically all</text>
  <text start="58.519" dur="3.72">these mining companies are running out</text>
  <text start="59.989" dur="4.32">of gold and they can&amp;#39;t really replace</text>
  <text start="62.239" dur="4.891">their aging minds and then you sent me</text>
  <text start="64.309" dur="5.131">another article that said buying gold</text>
  <text start="67.13" dur="3.629">and dumping stocks is a no brainer and a</text>
  <text start="69.44" dur="3.39">bunch of analysts believe that the</text>
  <text start="70.759" dur="5.401">equities market is due for a correction</text>
  <text start="72.83" dur="5.13">so what do you see going on in the stock</text>
  <text start="76.16" dur="4.47">market and with gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="77.96" dur="5.28">compared to that well they&amp;#39;re the first</text>
  <text start="80.63" dur="6.659">in business insider the the billionaire</text>
  <text start="83.24" dur="6.48">peerless on talks about how we are at a</text>
  <text start="87.289" dur="3.931">net negative in terms of mining which</text>
  <text start="89.72" dur="3.509">basically means you know they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="91.22" dur="5.46">able to keep up with the demand of gold</text>
  <text start="93.229" dur="5.491">for the last 20-30 years this is the</text>
  <text start="96.68" dur="3.78">first year that they&amp;#39;ve had a tap in the</text>
  <text start="98.72" dur="3.75">reserves mining companies are are</text>
  <text start="100.46" dur="4.769">pulling out of the reserves will fulfill</text>
  <text start="102.47" dur="4.109">orders and which basically means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.229" dur="2.941">they&amp;#39;re running short we&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="106.579" dur="3.661">hard time pulling enough gold out of the</text>
  <text start="108.17" dur="3.659">world and and we always you know when</text>
  <text start="110.24" dur="3.36">you look at the price of gold and you</text>
  <text start="111.829" dur="3.511">look at the dollar you sort of sometimes</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="4.26">you forget that the gold is really</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot of it out there</text>
  <text start="117.86" dur="5.88">and most of the owners of gold would</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="5.1">never sell their gold some countries</text>
  <text start="123.74" dur="3.659">have have sold their gold and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="3.75">you know some of the biggest mistakes</text>
  <text start="127.399" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;ve ever done like Great Britain</text>
  <text start="129.59" dur="5.459">sold the majority of their gold in 2002</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="4.5">and it was you know regarded as one of</text>
  <text start="135.049" dur="4.53">the biggest financial blunders by any</text>
  <text start="136.94" dur="5.16">central bank in the last 30 years but</text>
  <text start="139.579" dur="6.961">most central banks are not sellers the</text>
  <text start="142.1" dur="6.389">US China Russia or buying more and so</text>
  <text start="146.54" dur="4.289">basically this billionaire was saying</text>
  <text start="148.489" dur="5.161">that the demand out there is growing and</text>
  <text start="150.829" dur="5.34">the mining companies aren&amp;#39;t able to keep</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="4.47">up but if you look at the price the</text>
  <text start="156.169" dur="4.981">price hasn&amp;#39;t acknowledged that we</text>
  <text start="158.12" dur="3.48">haven&amp;#39;t seen that huge uptick in metals</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="1.59">and</text>
  <text start="161.6" dur="2.67">lot of it has to do with that that</text>
  <text start="162.74" dur="3.87">everybody&amp;#39;s dumping into risky</text>
  <text start="164.27" dur="4.35">investments in the stock market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="4.17">getting into derivatives they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="3.6">people are really putting themselves out</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="4.29">there they&amp;#39;re trying to get these heavy</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="4.47">returns but also they forget that you</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="3.69">know the downside risk is really high</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="3.48">and so that&amp;#39;s why when we see something</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="2.91">like this you see a billionaire a guy</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s you know around the mining</text>
  <text start="181.67" dur="3.75">companies you see this shortage you</text>
  <text start="183.8" dur="3.27">realize that there&amp;#39;s only a finite</text>
  <text start="185.42" dur="3.33">amount of gold out there they can only</text>
  <text start="187.07" dur="3.54">fit all the gold in the world in two and</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="6.24">a half Olympic sized swimming pools</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="6.24">which is really not that much you know</text>
  <text start="194.99" dur="3.96">in terms of how much is in the world and</text>
  <text start="196.85" dur="3.42">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="3.45">happening obviously the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.27" dur="4.5">still very high people are still putting</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="4.14">a lot of money there but the</text>
  <text start="204.77" dur="3.9">fundamentals for the stock market are a</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="3.69">little bit shaky obviously with the</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="4.17">tariffs we&amp;#39;ve seen the stock board have</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="4.86">a little bit of pullback and I think the</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="4.71">equity market is ready for for a big</text>
  <text start="215.09" dur="3.96">correction right and it looks like a lot</text>
  <text start="217.55" dur="3.36">of these larger corporations their</text>
  <text start="219.05" dur="6.54">stocks are very volatile we just saw</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="6.87">Facebook lose 15 billion some dollars in</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="6.81">a couple of hours just the other day and</text>
  <text start="227.78" dur="6.09">Twitter&amp;#39;s stock is tanking today so it</text>
  <text start="232.4" dur="3.69">looks like the stock market&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="4.32">place we want to be yeah and I think</text>
  <text start="236.09" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s all about diversification Jordan I</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="3.45">think that you know most people that are</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="4.38">savvy realized hey I don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="241.64" dur="5.34">all my eggs in one basket and the other</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="4.56">thing is is that when do you recalibrate</text>
  <text start="246.98" dur="4.29">your portfolio when do you look your</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="4.83">portfolio go okay I got to make a</text>
  <text start="251.27" dur="3.84">dynamic shift here and I got to move</text>
  <text start="253.7" dur="3.21">some money from some of these different</text>
  <text start="255.11" dur="3.81">assets there&amp;#39;s really you know five or</text>
  <text start="256.91" dur="7.8">six different investments everybody&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="258.92" dur="7.14">stock market gold real estate bonds you</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="3.3">know crypto currencies have been very</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.42">popular but you know really when you</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="3.21">look at it if you look at somebody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.48" dur="3.69">portfolio the average American has the</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="3.86">majority of their net worth in their</text>
  <text start="273.17" dur="4.11">house and in their 401k and</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="3.97">unfortunately their house is in my</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="4.38">opinion not really an investment you got</text>
  <text start="279.05" dur="3.72">a live somewhere and then the 401k is if</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.02">you have the majority your net worth</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="4.35">there and you&amp;#39;re close to retirement you</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="3.18">may want to look at it and see what</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="4.1">other options are out there and and I</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="5.79">think gold has always been a safe haven</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="3.99">silver is is really undervalued right</text>
  <text start="294.65" dur="2.21">now</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="4.65">people were scooping up a lot of silver</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="6.48">so I think it&amp;#39;s an exciting time for for</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="6.48">commodities it really is and then going</text>
  <text start="303.34" dur="4.56">back to a news topic that came out a</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="3.96">couple months ago but it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="3.93">mentioning here is the fact that we have</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="3.929">legislation going through that could</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="5.309">potentially put us back onto a gold</text>
  <text start="314.229" dur="5.041">standard and not only that but just the</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="5.43">last week there was a new story coming</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="4.679">out about Trump being able to take more</text>
  <text start="322.569" dur="3.75">control over the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="323.949" dur="5.821">actually fill some board positions there</text>
  <text start="326.319" dur="5.611">so do you see in the future us actually</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="4.769">getting back on something like a gold</text>
  <text start="331.93" dur="4.59">standard I mean it would be fantastic</text>
  <text start="334.539" dur="4.261">for gold I think it would be great for</text>
  <text start="336.52" dur="4.17">for the dollar to have something</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="4.14">regulating it so that we can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="340.69" dur="4.289">print and print and print and you know</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="4.68">inflation we&amp;#39;ve talked about it people</text>
  <text start="344.979" dur="4.891">forget about it but you know you go back</text>
  <text start="347.62" dur="4.59">you know if you go back a hundred years</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="5.639">and go back to 1918 and you had a $20</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="6">bill or $20 gold piece you know that $20</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="4.741">bill that $20 you can buy a lot of</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="3.81">things with $20 a hundred years ago you</text>
  <text start="360.25" dur="3.449">know you could you can buy all your</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="3.72">groceries you could you&amp;#39;re you know if</text>
  <text start="363.699" dur="5.521">you could buy a suit you could I mean</text>
  <text start="365.74" dur="6.419">you can do tons of things with $20 today</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="5.43">$20 you know barely covers any kind of</text>
  <text start="372.159" dur="5.221">meal or anything went barely half a tank</text>
  <text start="374.65" dur="5.549">of gas for 20 miles make a gas and but</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="5.879">that $20 gold piece today would still</text>
  <text start="380.199" dur="5.611">buy tons of groceries you can you know</text>
  <text start="383.259" dur="4.351">man could buy a suit a woman could buy</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="3.3">some you know handmade dresses and she</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="5.16">wanted to do that I mean that one ounce</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="6.33">of gold has held its value over the last</text>
  <text start="392.77" dur="4.98">hundred years so even though gold is is</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="4.259">down where it&amp;#39;s been over the last few</text>
  <text start="397.75" dur="5.789">years today it still really held its</text>
  <text start="399.699" dur="6.03">value compared to the dollar and I think</text>
  <text start="403.539" dur="4.051">that what Trump&amp;#39;s doing his interest</text>
  <text start="405.729" dur="4.591">rates have gone up six or seven times</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="4.74">over the last 18 months and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.32" dur="4.319">starting to see that real estate bubble</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="4.47">start to crack home prices have gone up</text>
  <text start="414.639" dur="4.951">just like they were in 2008 they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="416.8" dur="5.1">actually gone past 2008 and so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="4.499">saying hey let&amp;#39;s maybe we need to stop</text>
  <text start="421.9" dur="3.87">you know raising interest rates maybe we</text>
  <text start="424.089" dur="4.8">need to expand the money supply a little</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="3.359">bit and try to keep this economy going</text>
  <text start="428.889" dur="2.01">because</text>
  <text start="429.129" dur="3.24">obviously you know the elections next</text>
  <text start="430.899" dur="4.86">year and you don&amp;#39;t want to see a big</text>
  <text start="432.369" dur="6.45">correction while he&amp;#39;s going into 2020 so</text>
  <text start="435.759" dur="5.28">he could either by law he could actually</text>
  <text start="438.819" dur="3.57">affect the interest rates which no</text>
  <text start="441.039" dur="3.72">president has ever done they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="442.389" dur="5.43">taken control of the Fed or he can just</text>
  <text start="444.759" dur="4.8">appoint for people that have similar</text>
  <text start="447.819" dur="3.84">kind of business mentality that he does</text>
  <text start="449.559" dur="4.021">and then they can dictate policy that</text>
  <text start="451.659" dur="4.44">way so either way I think he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="453.58" dur="4.5">dictate policy in terms of the Fed the</text>
  <text start="456.099" dur="3.451">problem I really think is no matter what</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="4.349">you do even if we try to keep interest</text>
  <text start="459.55" dur="4.019">rates low if things are starting to move</text>
  <text start="462.429" dur="2.76">in that direction we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="463.569" dur="3.63">housing bubble correction right</text>
  <text start="465.189" dur="5.58">stock markets I don&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.199" dur="6.75">gonna be able to do because home prices</text>
  <text start="470.769" dur="5.52">are too high you know in terms of just</text>
  <text start="473.949" dur="3.87">what everything&amp;#39;s costing inflation is</text>
  <text start="476.289" dur="4.44">that a six-year high everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.819" dur="5.64">getting very expensive so unfortunately</text>
  <text start="480.729" dur="4.77">I think he just he came into office with</text>
  <text start="483.459" dur="5.37">a lot of financial problems he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="485.499" dur="5.97">to fix them but I just don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="488.829" dur="4.14">he&amp;#39;s gonna be able to yeah it sounds</text>
  <text start="491.469" dur="3.9">like he&amp;#39;s just trying to mitigate the</text>
  <text start="492.969" dur="6.15">inevitable and the inevitable is some</text>
  <text start="495.369" dur="5.52">kind of correction so with the way gold</text>
  <text start="499.119" dur="6">and silver hold up that just sounds like</text>
  <text start="500.889" dur="6.93">be a much better option yeah yeah he you</text>
  <text start="505.119" dur="4.77">know he owns gold I don&amp;#39;t know if he</text>
  <text start="507.819" dur="3.9">owns any silver but he&amp;#39;s you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="4.291">held these things in the past so you</text>
  <text start="511.719" dur="4.44">know he obviously stands behind having</text>
  <text start="514.18" dur="5.009">some some kind of precious not only in</text>
  <text start="516.159" dur="4.651">the portfolio and so it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="519.189" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s on everybody&amp;#39;s mind everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.81" dur="5.1">talking about metals right now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.699" dur="5.7">good to talk about it now because when</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="5.039">it starts to run typically gold doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.399" dur="5.94">go up five six percent you know from</text>
  <text start="530.949" dur="7.83">2001 to 2011 gold was going up 20% plus</text>
  <text start="534.339" dur="6.091">per year so and when the the 2008</text>
  <text start="538.779" dur="2.761">correction happened that&amp;#39;s what happened</text>
  <text start="540.43" dur="3.99">to gold and that&amp;#39;s what happened to</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="5.01">silver is actually going up more so when</text>
  <text start="544.42" dur="3.93">you see that correction and you see the</text>
