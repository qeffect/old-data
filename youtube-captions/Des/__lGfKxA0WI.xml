  <text start="6.649" dur="4.99">howdy so after my last video that I did</text>
  <text start="9.96" dur="3.63">on one of these where I was talking</text>
  <text start="11.639" dur="4.021">about geoengineering I had quite a few</text>
  <text start="13.59" dur="4.92">inquiries from people asking me the best</text>
  <text start="15.66" dur="4.74">ways to detoxify our bodies because of</text>
  <text start="18.51" dur="4.23">course not only do we have toxins</text>
  <text start="20.4" dur="5.16">sprayed over our heads in aerosol sprays</text>
  <text start="22.74" dur="3.6">we have toxins injected into us if you</text>
  <text start="25.56" dur="3.27">consent to it</text>
  <text start="26.34" dur="4.949">we have toxins in our food and food like</text>
  <text start="28.83" dur="3.96">products we live in a very toxic world</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s really no wonder that we have</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="4.8">exponential increasing in disease rates</text>
  <text start="35.309" dur="5.43">these days what are the causations is</text>
  <text start="37.59" dur="6.78">the toxins in our environment so before</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="5.581">I get into the methods dietary</text>
  <text start="44.37" dur="4.529">suggestions and supplement</text>
  <text start="46.32" dur="4.14">recommendations that I have for you to</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="2.971">detoxify yourself with we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="4.619">discuss a couple other things first</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="5.22">because of course when talking health we</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="4.41">are holistic beings every single little</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="3.719">aspect of our bodies is connected so</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="4.5">when talking about cause and effect</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="6.661">there&amp;#39;s many many different causative</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="4.651">factors that go into our health so</text>
  <text start="67.47" dur="5.43">there&amp;#39;s a couple things to discuss first</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="6.269">first one is water high quality h2o and</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s a few rules that I have for you</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="5.611">in regards to water number one how much</text>
  <text start="78" dur="5.31">should you be in taking per day well</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="6.33">first of all consistency is key remember</text>
  <text start="83.31" dur="5.309">we are 70 to 80 percent water and it</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="5.4">really kind of blows my mind how many</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="5.701">people just disregard water in terms of</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="5.22">their health and trying to get over any</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="5.58">said disease so remember guys water and</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="6">the suggestion that I have in regards to</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="6.03">intake per day is one half ounce per</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="4.02">pound of body weight apologies to my</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="3.09">international friends I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="3.18">know the metric system they teach us</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="2.97">weird things here in America but half an</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="5.28">ounce per pound of body weight so for</text>
  <text start="111.99" dur="7.19">instance I weigh about 170 pounds on a</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="6.33">good day I usually shoot for about</text>
  <text start="119.18" dur="6.1">ninety to a hundred ounces of water per</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="4.47">day so I have a big gallon I usually</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="3.869">just take around with me and chug that</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="5.16">throughout the day now of course this is</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="4.411">variable depending on say your activity</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="3.12">levels if you are more active</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="3.21">if you do some hard labor during the day</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="3.539">you&amp;#39;re gonna want a little more if you</text>
  <text start="136.77" dur="3.36">live in a humid climate we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="138.569" dur="3.331">perspiring a little bit more</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="4.35">you probably want some more water but</text>
  <text start="141.9" dur="4.8">again in general half an ounce per pound</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="6.33">of body weight per day</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="6">second rule with water purified my lord</text>
  <text start="150.81" dur="6.05">how much crap do they put in our water</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="6.539">with toxins fluoride chlorines</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="4.15">prescription medication has even been</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="4.261">found in some drinking water supplies so</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="4.559">definitely definitely definitely look</text>
  <text start="163.5" dur="5.76">into a purification system you can get</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="5.521">reverse osmosis ro systems this is the</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="4.199">one I would suggest most you can get</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="5.3">them for under your sink that you can</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="5.401">just hook on there you can even get some</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="6.61">gravity filtration systems that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="5.79">ro but they definitely still detoxify</text>
  <text start="183" dur="2.819">the fluoride out of the water too you</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="3.57">just want to make sure the packaging</text>
  <text start="185.819" dur="4.461">specifically says fluoride and in</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="5.4">regards to the purification of water</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="5.86">definitely look into shower filtration</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="5.13">systems because when you&amp;#39;re bathing you</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="5.76">have gallons and gallons of hot water if</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="5.16">you take hot showers hot water running</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="3.72">over your skin your skin is the largest</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="3.12">organ of your body so if you have</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="4.11">fluoride in your water and you&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="4.769">hot showers you&amp;#39;re absorbing it so</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="4.17">definitely look into a water filtration</text>
  <text start="211.799" dur="4.53">system for your shower head and your</text>
  <text start="213.9" dur="5.25">bathtub as well so half an ounce per</text>
  <text start="216.329" dur="5.481">pound of body weight definitely purify</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="5.28">that water as much as possible and</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="4.72">electrolytes definitely needs to be said</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="4.32">in regards to water because if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="4.709">drinking a load a load a load of</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="5.19">distilled or even reverse osmosis</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="5.431">purified water you don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="5.4">electrolyte set your you should be in</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="4.11">taking in with that water and if you</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="3.06">drink a bunch of water and don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="4.109">enough electrolytes in your body you can</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="4.26">still become dehydrated the function of</text>
  <text start="244.889" dur="3.57">an electrolyte when I say electrolytes</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re talking mainly sodium and</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="4.471">potassium but also magnesium and calcium</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="5.22">the function of sodium and potassium in</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="6.48">particular is to bring nutrients and</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="6.69">water into your cells and then take the</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="5.009">nutrients and the toxins and water out</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="4.57">of your cells right so it&amp;#39;s a pumping</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="4.121">mechanism with electrolytes you</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="3.3">have electrolytes in your body you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="4.98">not gonna get those toxins out of your</text>
  <text start="270.25" dur="5.49">cells okay so you can eat your</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="3.27">electrolytes and foods there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="2.91">supplements you can take with</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="4.59">electrolytes but food is always better</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="4.68">because most supplements are synthetic</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="4.14">isolated supplements there&amp;#39;s very few on</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="3.6">the market I would actually suggest but</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="4.13">the supplement talk is one for another</text>
  <text start="286.93" dur="4.65">time so to recap in regards to water</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="3.58">half an ounce per pound of body weight</text>
  <text start="291.58" dur="4.62">may be a little more depending on your</text>
  <text start="293.23" dur="4.77">lifestyle purify the heck out of it eat</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="3.53">a lot of electrolytes or add them to</text>
  <text start="298" dur="5.19">your water as needed you can also add</text>
  <text start="299.73" dur="5.02">Himalayan sea salt little dash of that</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="4.05">to your water as well that&amp;#39;s a very good</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="4.59">way to add some whole food natural</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="4.08">electrolytes to your water to drink so</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="5.31">we covered water now let&amp;#39;s go into</text>
  <text start="311.32" dur="4.86">limiting toxin intake of course you can</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="3.42">detoxify your body as much as you want</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="5.01">but if you don&amp;#39;t limit the toxins going</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="5.67">into your biological meatsuit you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="321.19" dur="5.31">really doing much good so limiting toxin</text>
  <text start="323.74" dur="4.68">intake this could be a whole video in</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="4.32">and of itself that could take me hours</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="4.4">and hours to discuss I mean thousands</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="5.07">and thousands of thousands of registered</text>
  <text start="332.82" dur="5.89">carcinogens are in our environment that</text>
  <text start="335.89" dur="6.51">we often encounter daily I think a study</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="7.32">recently showed that the average baby&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.4" dur="5.31">umbilical cord blood has over a hundred</text>
  <text start="346.03" dur="4.2">different carcinogens a hundred</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="5.1">different toxic compounds just in the</text>
  <text start="350.23" dur="5.4">umbilical cord blood so that goes to</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="4.86">show you especially mothers with a fetus</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="4.2">in yeah definitely keep yourself</text>
  <text start="357.67" dur="3.48">detoxified limit your toxin intake but</text>
  <text start="359.83" dur="4.32">just in general I mean they are</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="5.99">everywhere even if we don&amp;#39;t see them</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="5.97">okay so first suggestion I have there</text>
  <text start="367.14" dur="5.05">your food like I mentioned earlier food</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="4.02">like product because of course much of</text>
  <text start="372.19" dur="4.38">the stuff we buy these days in big-box</text>
  <text start="374.14" dur="3.63">stores we couldn&amp;#39;t even classify food</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="3.65">it&amp;#39;s literally not food it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="6">chemicals that taste good you see so</text>
  <text start="380.22" dur="5.68">your GMOs just be a very avid label</text>
  <text start="383.77" dur="3.09">reader I mean literally every single</text>
  <text start="385.9" dur="2.4">little thing you buy you should be</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="2.73">turning that sucker around and looking</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="2.7">at the ingredients and see if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="3">any little word on there that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391" dur="3.33">look like food or that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="392.59" dur="4.05">pronounce or that you don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="5.16">right do that it&amp;#39;s very important</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="4.26">consciousness is key so avoid your GMOs</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="3.51">get very from</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="4.08">with the ingredients in your food that</text>
  <text start="403" dur="4.68">is genetically engineered mainly corn</text>
  <text start="404.98" dur="6.06">and soy and the derivatives of corn and</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="7.47">soy like corn syrup soy bean oil soy</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="5.79">protein msg etc but GMOs</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="3.81">we got preservatives you know your</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="3.3">nitrates in meat and just all sorts of</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="2.79">different preservatives that are put</text>
  <text start="420.13" dur="4.32">into food you got your artificial</text>
  <text start="421.75" dur="4.2">sweeteners like aspartame and whatever</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="3.21">the heck that call aspartame these days</text>
  <text start="425.95" dur="3.87">they try to rebrand it with a new name</text>
  <text start="427.66" dur="3.99">like every years just to sell it on the</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="4.35">market you&amp;#39;ve got your a sulfate</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="5.73">potassium or ace k you&amp;#39;ve got your</text>
  <text start="434.17" dur="5.85">Splenda aka sucralose in this category</text>
  <text start="437.38" dur="6.18">all of those are extremely toxic avoid</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="5.61">all artificial sweeteners alright number</text>
  <text start="443.56" dur="4.62">two under the limiting toxin intake</text>
  <text start="445.63" dur="4.68">hygiene products just like I mentioned a</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="4.79">minute ago your skin the largest organ</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="5.7">of your body you will absorb toxins</text>
  <text start="452.97" dur="5.86">transdermal transdermally ie through</text>
  <text start="456.01" dur="4.8">your skin so with your hygiene products</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="6.03">your soaps that you&amp;#39;re using your hand</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="7.95">soaps your bath soaps your shampoos your</text>

  <text start="485.41" dur="4.56">products by natural hygiene products</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t go to those big box stores where</text>
  <text start="489.97" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re all gonna be toxic make the</text>
  <text start="491.56" dur="5.13">effort to go to a local market or on an</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="5.46">alternative market or peruse the</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="5.76">internet and buy specifically toxin free</text>

  <text start="508.42" dur="5.19">sulfate etc etc again there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="512.2" dur="3.9">singular ingredients that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="4.08">listening here but you can hear me speak</text>
  <text start="516.1" dur="4.05">because I&amp;#39;m just very familiar with</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="3.36">ingredients on labels and make the</text>
  <text start="520.15" dur="2.19">effort make the effort to educate</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="3.84">yourself about these singular</text>
  <text start="522.34" dur="4.88">ingredients so you can avoid them so we</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="5.22">went over food foods like products</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="4.45">hygiene products and it goes to note</text>
  <text start="530.11" dur="3.75">also dental products here a lot of</text>
  <text start="531.67" dur="2.61">dental products have fluoride in them</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re too</text>

  <text start="553.21" dur="6.48">mean your senses are basically your</text>
  <text start="557.65" dur="3.36">warning system for toxins so anything</text>
  <text start="559.69" dur="5.55">you breathe anything you touch anything</text>
  <text start="561.01" dur="6">you eat avoid toxins in that intake so</text>
  <text start="565.24" dur="3.78">your air make sure your air is purified</text>
  <text start="567.01" dur="3.27">I mean by household plants there&amp;#39;s great</text>

  <text start="865.339" dur="5.47">dietary suggestions now let&amp;#39;s move into</text>
  <text start="867.72" dur="4.5">some supplements first of all a category</text>
  <text start="870.809" dur="4.47">of supplements that I really really like</text>
  <text start="872.22" dur="8.459">for detoxification purposes is allergies</text>
  <text start="875.279" dur="8.761">allergies this is your spirulina this is</text>
  <text start="880.679" dur="4.681">your chlorella very exotic sounding</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="5.039">words if you&amp;#39;ve never heard of them</text>
  <text start="885.36" dur="5.279">before but they are amazing foods I</text>
  <text start="889.079" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t really call them supplements you</text>
  <text start="890.639" dur="3.36">buy them in supplement stores but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.439" dur="3.421">really a food it&amp;#39;s a food that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="893.999" dur="4.861">packaged in a bottle or in a capsule</text>
  <text start="895.86" dur="5.069">form that you eat that has amazing</text>
  <text start="898.86" dur="4.259">health benefits spirulina and chlorella</text>
  <text start="900.929" dur="5.01">the different allergies they have a load</text>
  <text start="903.119" dur="5.76">of antioxidants a load of vitamins and</text>
  <text start="905.939" dur="5.43">minerals and an amazing source of</text>
  <text start="908.879" dur="4.351">plant-based protein as well in them but</text>
  <text start="911.369" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re also very detoxifying you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="913.23" dur="3.93">notice when it comes to spirulina and</text>
  <text start="914.669" dur="3.63">chlorella they are dark green they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="917.16" dur="3.769">extremely dark green they&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="918.299" dur="6.69">black colored because they have so many</text>
  <text start="920.929" dur="5.681">phyto compounds within them and in</text>
  <text start="924.989" dur="3.75">regards to the ally allergies in</text>
  <text start="926.61" dur="4.62">particular chlorella chlorella is the</text>
  <text start="928.739" dur="6.091">main one for detoxification because</text>
  <text start="931.23" dur="5.73">chlorella is able to bind</text>
  <text start="934.83" dur="4.98">heavy-metal molecules in your body and</text>
  <text start="936.96" dur="4.14">get them out of you so chlorella a</text>
  <text start="939.81" dur="3.09">little more expensive than spirulina</text>
  <text start="941.1" dur="4.44">because it&amp;#39;s a little tougher to</text>
  <text start="942.9" dur="5.34">manufacture but chlorella is just great</text>
  <text start="945.54" dur="3.96">for heavy-metal detoxification so again</text>
  <text start="948.24" dur="3.42">make sure you get a really pure source</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="5.42">with your spirulina and your chlorella</text>
  <text start="951.66" dur="5.85">but I use these on a daily basis I</text>
  <text start="954.92" dur="5.74">personally use the powders they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="957.51" dur="6.15">taste good but does taste really matter</text>
  <text start="960.66" dur="5.79">or does you your body your health your</text>
  <text start="963.66" dur="4.32">brain matter don&amp;#39;t let your ego make</text>
  <text start="966.45" dur="3.78">your decisions for you long-term</text>
  <text start="967.98" dur="4.29">thinking here so I would highly suggest</text>
  <text start="970.23" dur="4.2">using these in your supplementary your</text>
  <text start="972.27" dur="5.34">dietary regimen now let&amp;#39;s go do a couple</text>
  <text start="974.43" dur="4.86">supplements that I fancy again there are</text>
  <text start="977.61" dur="4.77">hundreds of supplements on the market</text>
  <text start="979.29" dur="6.59">that you could choose for detoxification</text>
  <text start="982.38" dur="6.24">I have two suggestions here number one</text>
  <text start="985.88" dur="4.96">zeolites zeolites you can buy an</text>
  <text start="988.62" dur="4.29">empowered and also a liquid form but</text>
  <text start="990.84" dur="5.28">what a zeolite is is that it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="992.91" dur="5.28">ancient mineral that comes from only a</text>
  <text start="996.12" dur="5.13">few places on this earth I think the</text>
  <text start="998.19" dur="6.42">main source of zeolites are volcanic</text>
  <text start="1001.25" dur="6.39">deposits in Russia but zeolite is a</text>
  <text start="1004.61" dur="5.46">mineral that has a specific cage-like</text>
  <text start="1007.64" dur="4.25">structure within its molecule and within</text>
  <text start="1010.07" dur="4.26">the molecules of zeolite it has a</text>
  <text start="1011.89" dur="4.54">negative charge a negative magnetic</text>
  <text start="1014.33" dur="5.28">charge so whenever you take in zeolites</text>
  <text start="1016.43" dur="4.95">and that little lattice like negatively</text>
  <text start="1019.61" dur="5.55">charged structure molecule comes in</text>
  <text start="1021.38" dur="6.6">contact with a positively charged toxic</text>
  <text start="1025.16" dur="4.86">ion it sucks it right in and it gets it</text>
  <text start="1027.98" dur="5.46">out so it has the opposite magnetic</text>
  <text start="1030.02" dur="5.28">charge of toxins in your body leading it</text>
  <text start="1033.44" dur="3.6">to suck them in and carry them out so</text>
  <text start="1035.3" dur="3.93">zzo lights are very effective at</text>
  <text start="1037.04" dur="3.87">heavy-metal detoxification just be</text>
  <text start="1039.23" dur="3.75">careful with them I have personally seen</text>
  <text start="1040.91" dur="6.539">people get sick taking too many zeolites</text>
  <text start="1042.98" dur="6.12">too quick to detoxify so cardinal rule</text>
  <text start="1047.449" dur="4.341">when you&amp;#39;re starting any detoxification</text>
