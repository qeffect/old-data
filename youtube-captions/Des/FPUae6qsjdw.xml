  <text start="9.86" dur="5.979">what is up ladies and gentlemen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="12.24" dur="5.34">April 11th and I just got wind that NASA</text>
  <text start="15.839" dur="4.221">is going to be holding a press</text>
  <text start="17.58" dur="5.97">conference on Thursday to discuss</text>
  <text start="20.06" dur="5.62">findings about ocean worlds within our</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="4.86">solar system and they say that these</text>
  <text start="25.68" dur="4.79">findings are going to help broaden the</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="5.79">search for life beyond our planet Earth</text>
  <text start="30.47" dur="6.07">now on one hand this is really cool</text>
  <text start="34.2" dur="4.859">right NASA is finally giving us a little</text>
  <text start="36.54" dur="6.72">bit more of truth a little bit more soft</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="5.671">disclosure but let&amp;#39;s be real there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="4.2">whole lot of truth that they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.559">told us NASA never a straight answer and</text>
  <text start="47.46" dur="4.5">the point of this video that I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="4.981">to make is that I&amp;#39;m actually going to</text>
  <text start="51.96" dur="5.009">introduce to you a concept called star</text>
  <text start="54.27" dur="5.94">water and we&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="5.64">straight-up leave NASA behind because</text>
  <text start="60.21" dur="4.379">just like Buckminster Fuller said with</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="3.451">his famous quote I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="4.651">exact wording of it but he basically</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="4.53">said if you want to create a new reality</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.05">a better reality</text>
  <text start="70.59" dur="5.55">you basically have to leave the old</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="5.009">obsolete one behind so who cares about</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="4.92">what NASA has to say we can search for</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="4.441">the truth ourselves I do I know all of</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="4.05">you guys do because you watch my videos</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="3.809">so I&amp;#39;m going to share with you some</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="5.54">information about this concept called</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="6.21">star water now a lot of people in the</text>
  <text start="90.65" dur="4.539">conventional science world in the</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="4.591">conventional way of thinking believe</text>
  <text start="95.189" dur="5.82">that the earth is some type of like</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="6.42">magical watery oasis in our solar system</text>
  <text start="101.009" dur="4.68">and you know we&amp;#39;re the only planet that</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="3.45">has water and none of the other ones do</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="3.301">some people kind of say okay you know</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="3">Mars has some ice on it but that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="5.37">as far as they go</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="5.85">in their conventional thinking and what</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="3.509">another favorite quote of mine to</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="3.63">introduce to you I don&amp;#39;t remember who</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="3.991">said this one but he basically said the</text>
  <text start="119.7" dur="3.36">illiterate of the 21st century are not</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="2.969">those who don&amp;#39;t know how to read and</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="3.57">write but those who can&amp;#39;t unlearn and</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="3.66">relearn so if we&amp;#39;re really gonna find</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="4.32">out what the heck is going on here we</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="3.201">have to basically scrub our brains and</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="3.26">on</text>
  <text start="131.69" dur="5.16">learn all of the false theories and the</text>
  <text start="134.21" dur="4.44">false arguments that conventional</text>
  <text start="136.85" dur="5.06">education conventional science teaches</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="9.06">us and piece together new worldviews</text>
  <text start="141.91" dur="8.77">based on the non publicized data at hand</text>
  <text start="147.71" dur="7.17">and the data I&amp;#39;m going to share with you</text>
  <text start="150.68" dur="6.98">comes from Ben Davidson of the sucess</text>
  <text start="154.88" dur="5.79">suspicious observers YouTube channel and</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="5.53">dude is an awesome physicist I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="160.67" dur="4.41">learned so much about space weather and</text>
  <text start="163.19" dur="3.78">everything from following his YouTube</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="3.69">channel for a couple years he does a</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="3.57">great expose on this concept that he</text>
  <text start="168.77" dur="3.21">calls star water I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.54" dur="4.05">the one that invented it or someone else</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="3.69">did but pretty much most of the</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="4.05">information I get about it comes from</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="8.55">him now what star water is it&amp;#39;s the idea</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="7.86">that water is everywhere in our not only</text>
  <text start="184.22" dur="5.57">our solar system but just our cosmos in</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="6.36">general water is everywhere and</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="5.919">conventional science actually validates</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="7.83">this idea water is that we already know</text>
  <text start="195.709" dur="7.351">it is right if we know that mercury has</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="4.11">water we know Venus has probably had</text>
  <text start="203.06" dur="3.77">water in the past earth obviously has</text>
  <text start="204.8" dur="8.28">water I&amp;#39;m looking at it</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="8.95">Mars has water or ice most of the pretty</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="6.21">much all the moons in our solar system</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.42">has water Pluto has ice on it even the</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="4.32">Oort cloud even around other stars</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="5.5">scientists have found water and all of</text>
  <text start="223.61" dur="5.49">these findings have been published in</text>
  <text start="226.7" dur="5.28">journals and articles they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="229.1" dur="4.32">right in the they always put the truth</text>
  <text start="231.98" dur="3.9">out there they just don&amp;#39;t connect the</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="6.45">dots so it&amp;#39;s up to us to connect the</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="7.41">dots now okay with that assumption that</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="7.29">there&amp;#39;s water everywhere that begs the</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="6.03">question how did it get there now this</text>
  <text start="247.16" dur="5.22">this this question requires an</text>
  <text start="249.32" dur="5.81">understanding of solar weather and what</text>
  <text start="252.38" dur="5.91">the Sun does but in basics the Sun</text>
  <text start="255.13" dur="6.43">basically poops out what&amp;#39;s called CME&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.29" dur="6.81">coronal mass ejections and in these CMEs</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="6.96">that every star bursts out we find</text>
  <text start="265.1" dur="6.69">elements and every element known to man</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="5.46">has actually been found in these coronal</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="7.02">mass ejections but the most important</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="5.85">one is hydrogen okay when the Sun gives</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="4.31">off the CMEs</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="6.75">a lot of hydrogen and hydrogen ions are</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="5.92">splurt it out with it and when these</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="4.92">hydrogen ions come in contact with a</text>
  <text start="289.04" dur="4.77">planetary atmosphere that has oxygen in</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="5.28">it the cma will actually cause that</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="4.83">atmosphere to release oxygen that oxygen</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="4.56">will then be able to bind with those</text>
  <text start="298.64" dur="5.46">hydrogen ions and what happens when we</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="8.64">bind oxygen and hydrogen we get some</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="9.06">high-quality h2o so understanding that</text>
  <text start="309.98" dur="5.1">well pretty much you know any planetary</text>
  <text start="313.16" dur="3.15">atmosphere that has oxygen and it</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="3.51">doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much up how much</text>
  <text start="316.31" dur="4.8">oxygen it has but if it has any in it</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s going to create some water the</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="4.59">reason that the earth has so much</text>
  <text start="323.69" dur="3.3">freakin water in our solar system much</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="3.84">more than all the other planets is</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="6.42">because it has more oxygen so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="329.54" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s the earth is a nice it actually is</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="3.47">a nice little oasis it has all this</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="5.22">oxygen all this water it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="5.8">abundant with a huge diversity of life</text>
  <text start="340.37" dur="4.49">on it but it&amp;#39;s not unique in the fact it</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="5.85">has water water is freaking everywhere</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="5.23">and you know one one thing I just want</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="3.51">to bring one piece of evidence I want to</text>
  <text start="350.09" dur="4.74">bring into the picture real quick for</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="4.47">this star water theory is noctilucent</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="2.87">clouds and these things freakin</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="3.93">fascinate me this whole subject</text>
  <text start="357.7" dur="5.8">fascinates me but noctilucent clouds are</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="4.76">especially pretty cool because what they</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="5.28">are is that they&amp;#39;re essentially</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="6.49">electrified ionized glowing clouds that</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="6.45">are way up in the freakin atmosphere</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="6.68">they&amp;#39;re like 50 80 miles high they&amp;#39;re 10</text>
  <text start="375.23" dur="6.03">times higher than Souris clouds are</text>
  <text start="378.37" dur="5.17">Souris clouds are the highest clouds</text>
  <text start="381.26" dur="4.62">known to conventional science so these</text>
  <text start="383.54" dur="4.23">noctilucent clouds are you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="3.54">completely puzzling conventional</text>
  <text start="387.77" dur="4.14">scientists they&amp;#39;re like how the heck did</text>
  <text start="389.42" dur="6.059">that water vapor and those clouds get so</text>
  <text start="391.91" dur="6.48">high up in the freakin sky because right</text>
  <text start="395.479" dur="3.391">water is not limited to our earthly</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="2.16">surface</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="5.79">water is everywhere throughout the</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="7.68">cosmos right it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s our you could</text>
  <text start="404.66" dur="10.59">say our universe is literally made to</text>
  <text start="408.23" dur="10.02">make water okay this is very important</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="5.25">because the controlling powers that be</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="4.74">on this planet that have screwed with</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="5.79">our minds for so long they don&amp;#39;t want us</text>
  <text start="422.99" dur="6.6">to know this because what is water water</text>
  <text start="426.29" dur="4.89">is the precursor to life right and</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s studies that have been shown if</text>
  <text start="431.18" dur="6.57">you electrify water you can start making</text>
  <text start="434.24" dur="5.97">primitive forms of life the you know</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="4.89">electricity and water together can</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="5.22">simply make life so if we have a</text>
  <text start="442.64" dur="6.54">universe that&amp;#39;s made to make life if we</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="5.88">have a universe that is based upon</text>
  <text start="449.18" dur="4.08">electricity right the electric universe</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="5.69">theory fantastic theory I&amp;#39;ll do more</text>
  <text start="453.26" dur="6.74">videos on that what does that mean well</text>
  <text start="457" dur="5.02">put those two together and you could</text>
  <text start="460" dur="5.41">logically come to the conclusion that</text>
  <text start="462.02" dur="7.62">our universe is literally made to make</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="6.39">life life is abundant in our universe</text>
  <text start="469.64" dur="5.1">and understanding that coming to that</text>
  <text start="471.8" dur="5.64">logical conclusion in seriousness right</text>
  <text start="474.74" dur="4.05">without ridicule but seriously coming to</text>
  <text start="477.44" dur="2.85">the conclusion of wow there&amp;#39;s life</text>
  <text start="478.79" dur="2.7">freaking everywhere they don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="3.87">to realize that and want you to know</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="5.91">that because that opens up Pandora&amp;#39;s box</text>
  <text start="484.16" dur="5.46">of many many many other secrets that the</text>
  <text start="487.4" dur="6.57">powers that be have not told us so</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="7.05">anyway hope you enjoyed that little</text>
  <text start="493.97" dur="4.94">expose on what star water is if you want</text>
  <text start="496.67" dur="5.37">to know more about it check out the</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="6.01">links from suspicious observers down</text>
  <text start="502.04" dur="5.4">below and I&amp;#39;ll be doing of course more</text>
  <text start="504.92" dur="3.75">videos on all this kind of cool science</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="3.63">stuff as I begin to wrap my head around</text>
  <text start="508.67" dur="6.3">it and also I will be doing more videos</text>
  <text start="511.07" dur="5.73">on the solar shift because these</text>
  <text start="514.97" dur="4.92">noctilucent clouds that I mentioned</text>
  <text start="516.8" dur="4.8">right the very high clouds that normally</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="4.65">are always found on the north and south</text>
  <text start="521.6" dur="5.64">pole but they&amp;#39;re actually one sign of</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="4.11">the changing energetics of our cosmos is</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="3.39">that these noctilucent clouds are being</text>
  <text start="528.65" dur="3.78">found lower and lower and lower I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="5.07">Washington State I&amp;#39;ve actually seen them</text>
  <text start="532.43" dur="4.74">couple years ago with my own eyes and</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="4.59">this is just one piece of evidence</text>
  <text start="537.17" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s showing there is a lot of change</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="4.44">going on in our solar system in our</text>
  <text start="543.11" dur="4.979">cosmos and there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="544.73" dur="5.43">changes that are going on with our Sun</text>
  <text start="548.089" dur="3.361">that are very important understand so I</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="3.57">will be doing more videos than that so</text>
  <text start="551.45" dur="8.12">anyway thank you guys for listening to</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="5.84">my tangent my rant of the day peace out</text>
  <text start="565.459" dur="2.06">you</text>
