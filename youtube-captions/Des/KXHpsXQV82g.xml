  <text start="123.079" dur="6.311">boy psychology to a man psychology or an</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="6.78">immature to amateur psychology because</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="6.12">we lack the proper parents and</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="5.28">the proper elders and the proper people</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="6">in our society to raise us we have so</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="5.729">many adults these days who still are</text>

  <text start="144.629" dur="6.211">causing that&amp;#39;s causing our youth these</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="5.099">days to really have no Mentors we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="6.179">have good mentors good coaches these</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="6.771">days and what you can do right if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="5.491">trying to spiritually ball on a budget</text>
  <text start="159.98" dur="5.53">I&amp;#39;m gonna sit down I&amp;#39;ll just walk back</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="5.67">and forth use the internet to find</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="5.28">yourself literally a mentor and it could</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="6.72">be anybody your mentor doesn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="6.87">be somebody who is in person that you</text>

  <text start="204.359" dur="4.171">you a positive message that helps you</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="3.631">navigate these energies that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="3.66">the reasons why I&amp;#39;m doing this YouTube</text>
  <text start="210.09" dur="4.829">channel because I see so many people</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="4.139">that are lost that are having a tough</text>
  <text start="214.919" dur="4.68">time navigating through all of this</text>
  <text start="216.329" dur="5.13">nonsense and I just want to simply throw</text>
  <text start="219.599" dur="3.6">my thoughts and experiences and</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="4.59">perspectives out there to help people</text>
  <text start="223.199" dur="5.16">navigate it so that&amp;#39;s one thing you can</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="4.44">do use the internet to find yourself a</text>
  <text start="228.359" dur="3.69">mentor who you&amp;#39;re not going to try to</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="4.051">emulate I want to throw that out there</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="5.31">right now I don&amp;#39;t want you to try and</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="7.08">duplicate their personality but find</text>
  <text start="237.359" dur="8.19">their character traits that you desire</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="10.29">or that you like I said you emulate or</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="7.921">you admire and try to absorb that so you</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t want to duplicate a successful</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="4.71">personality you just want to take their</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="4.65">traits that you like and try to bring</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="3.299">that into your being so that&amp;#39;s one thing</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="4.68">you can do right use the internet to</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="6.121">find yourself a mentor and another thing</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.32">and by I say a mentor it can be made</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="3.78">mentors there could be a lot of</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="4.86">different people that you you look at</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="5.25">online just because they inspire you and</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="8.72">they bring you that positivity so use</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="11.34">the Internet and second of all keep</text>
  <text start="282.71" dur="8.35">researching whatever your heart</text>
  <text start="287.97" dur="7.5">intuitively draws you towards okay don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="9.2">don&amp;#39;t sit there and wallow in what you</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="7.35">could say the negativity keep keep doing</text>
  <text start="300.26" dur="4.87">what you feel that you need to do follow</text>
  <text start="302.82" dur="4.85">your bliss as Joseph Campbell would say</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s how you keep navigating these</text>
  <text start="307.67" dur="5.32">negative energies is that you continue</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="3.42">doing things that bring you that</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="3.18">positive and you bring you that bliss</text>
  <text start="314.34" dur="4.58">whether it&amp;#39;s painting or dancing or</text>
  <text start="316.17" dur="5.64">playing sports or playing music or</text>
  <text start="318.92" dur="5.17">writing articles or making videos or</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="7.44">whatever it is you follow your bliss and</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="7.92">I think when you get to enough of a</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="6.24">spiritual understanding of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="332.01" dur="6.99">going on here you could say I think you</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="8.79">will see that seeing something as a</text>
  <text start="339" dur="8.12">negative energy is not negative in the</text>
  <text start="344.28" dur="5.7">way that most people think of it and</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="4.57">when with all these negative energies</text>
  <text start="349.98" dur="3.72">going on on this planet</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="4.92">remember perspective is everything</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="6.48">without these negative energies we would</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="5.85">have no idea what positivity feels like</text>
  <text start="360.18" dur="4.17">we wouldn&amp;#39;t know what light is without</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="4.05">dark we wouldn&amp;#39;t know what white is</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="6.15">without black do you see what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="366.51" dur="5.76">so understand I mean from this question</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="3.51">it sounds like you may just be beginning</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="3.48">your spiritual journey or your whole</text>
  <text start="374.01" dur="5.67">awakening process which is why I wanted</text>
  <text start="375.75" dur="6.12">to to answer this but once you get deep</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="3.42">enough into it or far enough into it you</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="3.87">get to a point where you realize that</text>
  <text start="383.1" dur="5.22">the negative energies here are great</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re good they&amp;#39;re needed and you</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="6.15">simply transmute them by thinking about</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="5.52">them differently the universe is mental</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="4.199">everything that&amp;#39;s going on here begins</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="4.109">with the mental component in the</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="6.33">physical world manifest</text>
  <text start="401.249" dur="6.86">from consciousness right from all of our</text>
  <text start="404.999" dur="7.92">consciousness the universe is conscious</text>
  <text start="408.109" dur="6.91">so you begin to see that okay- is simply</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="5.97">the way I&amp;#39;m looking at it I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="415.019" dur="7.8">it too to think it&amp;#39;s negative or to feel</text>
  <text start="418.889" dur="5.22">that it&amp;#39;s bad right language is so tough</text>
  <text start="422.819" dur="2.91">because there&amp;#39;s always so many different</text>
  <text start="424.109" dur="3.15">connotations that different people with</text>
  <text start="425.729" dur="3.72">different perspectives will place upon</text>
  <text start="427.259" dur="4.86">words but you&amp;#39;ll simply begin to see</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="4.95">that the negative is just as good for</text>
  <text start="432.119" dur="6.45">you as the positive is and sometimes the</text>
  <text start="434.399" dur="8.461">positive that you would call is bad for</text>
  <text start="438.569" dur="7.2">you right to much positive starts to to</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="6.179">make things bland if we didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="445.769" dur="5.04">bad feelings the negativity we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="449.039" dur="5.94">truly understand what the positivity is</text>
  <text start="450.809" dur="5.97">so understand that my friend use I think</text>
  <text start="454.979" dur="3.84">that is the best way to navigate these</text>
  <text start="456.779" dur="3.66">negative energies use the internet use</text>
  <text start="458.819" dur="3.66">the avenues you have go to a book store</text>

  <text start="468.029" dur="5.581">then also understand that all of the</text>
  <text start="471.209" dur="6.36">negativity that&amp;#39;s going on on this</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="6.569">planet is there to help us grow it&amp;#39;s</text>
