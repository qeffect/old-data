  <text start="0.03" dur="4.32">so I was meeting with a client yesterday</text>
  <text start="2.28" dur="7.38">right and because that&amp;#39;s one thing I do</text>
  <text start="4.35" dur="8.039">is I health coach and little backstory</text>
  <text start="9.66" dur="5.309">just kind of Who I am that&amp;#39;s how I got</text>
  <text start="12.389" dur="4.801">into the truth sharing realm I got a job</text>
  <text start="14.969" dur="4.801">at a health food store and this was a</text>
  <text start="17.19" dur="5.31">very conscious very aware health food</text>
  <text start="19.77" dur="5.429">store they then delved into the reality</text>
  <text start="22.5" dur="4.65">of things like GMOs and vaccines in our</text>
  <text start="25.199" dur="4.051">healthcare and food system and then</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="4.02">found every other rabbit hole from there</text>
  <text start="29.25" dur="4.26">but I was meeting with this client</text>
  <text start="31.17" dur="6.389">talking to her yada yada</text>
  <text start="33.51" dur="8.4">kind of assessing her and she had</text>
  <text start="37.559" dur="7.351">chronic fatigue but I also found out how</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="7.079">toxic her body was and this is a common</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="6.39">theme that I find with pretty much every</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="5.34">single client I come across but also a</text>
  <text start="51.3" dur="6.079">theme of our collective of our</text>
  <text start="54.329" dur="7.32">population at large is that we are such</text>
  <text start="57.379" dur="5.801">we have such toxic bodies and I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="4.531">a couple videos on this channel in</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="8.4">regarding the Ascension process and the</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="8.97">light-being concept now what I want to</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="7.95">discuss in this video is the specific</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="7.109">toxins and the specific poisons that get</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="6.83">into our bodies and that literally</text>
  <text start="82.259" dur="7.351">disrupt that light within us that that</text>
  <text start="86.36" dur="6.219">completely screw our systems up and that</text>
  <text start="89.61" dur="5.219">are actually you could say delaying the</text>
  <text start="92.579" dur="4.86">ascension process you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="94.829" dur="4.441">people are into that kind of concept so</text>
  <text start="97.439" dur="4.381">I wanted to talk specifically about what</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="8.25">is the things that are harming our</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="8.25">mind-body vehicles now it all boils down</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="4.919">at the physical base level to our</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="6.18">nervous systems our nervous system is</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="5.371">what runs our musculoskeletal system</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="3.24">you know when bodybuilders and power</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="3.9">lifters and athletes are trying to</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="4.32">become stronger what they really want to</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="4.259">focus on is the nerves not the muscles</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.72">as muscles run the nerves the nervous</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="3.721">system also controls all the other</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="5.82">processes that all the organs of our</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="6.03">body every everything else so</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="4.68">you can also think of it this way the</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="4.47">nervous system literally just runs off</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="4.19">energy it&amp;#39;s electrochemical reactions</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s just physical energy but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="4.15">responsible for the energy of each other</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.74">layer of who we are the mental emotional</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="4.8">spiritual layers so on the physical</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="4.23">level we must look at the poisons and</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="5.84">toxins that screw up our nervous system</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="7.23">first and foremost heavy metals right</text>
  <text start="157.01" dur="7.69">mercury aluminum cadmium led things like</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="7.04">that especially mercury and aluminum</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="6.3">these are two heavy metals that are</text>
  <text start="168.05" dur="5.5">quite literally pumped into us and</text>
  <text start="171" dur="6.09">sprayed over our heads by the powers</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="5.37">that be because they are trying to delay</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="3.15">our conscious evolution they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="3.51">us but to become more conscious more</text>
  <text start="180.24" dur="5.55">aware and more enlightened because that</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="4.98">will then ruin the control systems they</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="2.31">have over us because we&amp;#39;ll begin to wake</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="6.57">up and get it</text>
  <text start="188.1" dur="7.47">right so mercury and aluminum how do</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="4.26">these get to our bodies well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.57" dur="5.31">discuss mercury vaccinations are a</text>
  <text start="198.24" dur="6.29">massive way they get both of them into</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="6.06">us so many vaccines still have mercury</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="3.85">even though it&amp;#39;s commonly thought of</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re not preserved in thimerosal</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="4.65">anymore but they very much some very</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="4.02">much are and aluminum they don&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="3.63">mercury in a shot they put aluminum</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="5.34">which is just as bad if not worse when</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="6.15">you look at the word aluminum Lumina and</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="6.06">Latin means light anti is primarily a</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="4.83">prefix used to denote the opposite of</text>
  <text start="225.57" dur="8.04">something so you can think of aluminum</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="7.95">as anti light it literally scrambles our</text>
  <text start="233.61" dur="4.5">body&amp;#39;s ability to use light to use those</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="6.32">bio photons for our DNA to cohere with</text>
  <text start="238.11" dur="6.63">this light so our aluminum is the best</text>
  <text start="241.91" dur="4.74">thing they could use to delay our</text>
  <text start="244.74" dur="4.35">ascension process because it&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="246.65" dur="5.92">screwing up our DNA it&amp;#39;s not allowing</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="5.67">our DNA to cohere and turn on those junk</text>
  <text start="252.57" dur="5.64">DNA codes to enhance our psychic</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="5.039">abilities okay I kind of went through a</text>
  <text start="258.21" dur="5.04">lot of things there but that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="6.811">basics of it and the best way that I</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="3.9">could explain so you know mercury and</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="2.369">aluminum</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="3.78">from vaccinations come from food you</text>
  <text start="268.979" dur="3.331">must be very aware of the food you feed</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="3.48">your body with most of it is not only</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="4.05">nutrient deficient but downright toxic</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="5.16">50 percent of high fructose corn syrup</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="5.79">samples have mercury in them so beware</text>
  <text start="279.57" dur="5.219">of anything that&amp;#39;s genetically corn</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="5.25">derived like corn syrup or maltodextrin</text>
  <text start="284.789" dur="4.621">or corn starch as you must be very aware</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="3.9">you know ingredients substances</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="3.66">everything aluminum&amp;#39;s uses an</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="3.78">anti-caking agent a lot of foods and</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="6.81">breads and salts and things like that so</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="6.119">be very aware be also where the cooking</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="3.33">utensils you use what you package your</text>
  <text start="301.199" dur="4.681">food in like cans aluminum leach through</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="4.53">cans and also sometimes you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="3.78">avoid the aluminum or the mercury</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="4.17">because how much you know fossil fuel</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="4.259">output has there been from coal burning</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="3.42">and how many chemtrails but sprayed</text>
  <text start="313.919" dur="5.581">overhead so that&amp;#39;s why cleansing is</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="6.36">really important but you avoid what you</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="4.86">can and I&amp;#39;m giving you things to avoid</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="5.039">you also must avoid fluoride fluoride is</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="4.44">another highly neuro toxic chemical</text>
  <text start="326.729" dur="5.041">middle austan often calcified pineal</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="5.22">gland which is the the center of our</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="4.89">consciousness right there right it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s the antenna that connects us to</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="2.91">that source field that connects</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="4.141">everything so we must keep it pure and</text>
  <text start="339.57" dur="4.56">clean so avoid fluoride avoid the</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="5.94">fluoridated toothpaste and don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="8.52">dare let your pediatrician offer your</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="6">child a fluoridated supplement fluoride</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="3.449">is also in your water get a water</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="5.76">purifier if you need to fluoride I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="356.099" dur="8.25">also be in many things it is in some</text>
  <text start="359.82" dur="10.04">pharmaceutical medication it is used in</text>
  <text start="364.349" dur="8.221">and CFCs and you know that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="5.679">everywhere so again cleansing is</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="5.219">important but also one piece of it one</text>
  <text start="375.539" dur="5.571">piece of information when aluminum and</text>
  <text start="377.789" dur="5.91">fluoride react together they are very</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="4.9">they have an affinity to attract and</text>
  <text start="383.699" dur="4.951">once they come together to make aluminum</text>
  <text start="386.01" dur="4.35">fluoride it&amp;#39;ll enhance the bio ability</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="4.17">to across the blood-brain barrier of</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="4.5">that compound so it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="392.82" dur="3.719">because these companies all you know</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re very reluctant to even study a</text>
  <text start="396.539" dur="4.38">chemical EPA has 80,000 different</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="3.03">chemicals in our environment and</text>
  <text start="400.919" dur="3.12">whenever they study them the only study</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="2.369">one and I&amp;#39;ll study in a couple of months</text>
  <text start="404.039" dur="3.09">right</text>
  <text start="404.699" dur="3.84">they never study toxins together because</text>
  <text start="407.129" dur="3.06">poisons together will compound their</text>
  <text start="408.539" dur="5.1">effects so when we have the aluminum and</text>
  <text start="410.189" dur="6.2">fluoride and all this together right</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="6.291">we don&amp;#39;t really realize how bad it is</text>
  <text start="416.389" dur="6.28">now also heavy metals fluoride and</text>
  <text start="419.93" dur="6.209">glyphosate glyphosate has been shown to</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="6.15">be extremely toxic even in my new levels</text>
  <text start="426.139" dur="4.451">glyphosate is the primary ingredient in</text>
  <text start="428.819" dur="3.21">pesticides especially the pesticide</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="6.12">sprayed on genetically engineered crops</text>
  <text start="432.029" dur="7.13">so by organic as much as you can all you</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="5.37">can especially non-gmo that&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="439.159" dur="5.35">sometimes more important than organic so</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="3.78">those are the basic tips that I can help</text>
  <text start="444.509" dur="2.581">you with I hope you enjoy that</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="2.91">information I don&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="6.12">want this video to be a long ranting one</text>
  <text start="448.77" dur="6.72">but I wanted to throw some very very</text>
  <text start="453.21" dur="7.28">usable pieces of information out there</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="7.739">because even in the spiritual disclosure</text>
  <text start="460.49" dur="5.829">ascension communities you could say I</text>
  <text start="463.229" dur="6.69">think a lot of the a lot of the health</text>
  <text start="466.319" dur="5.28">information is not practical enough it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.919" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s I like it you know it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="471.599" dur="4.891">spiritual and but it&amp;#39;s not you know we</text>
  <text start="474.449" dur="3.87">need concrete stuff so there was some</text>
  <text start="476.49" dur="3.57">concrete information let me know what</text>
  <text start="478.319" dur="4.951">you think of that comment down below and</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="5.339">let me know what you guys might want any</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="3.929">health-related information on next</text>
  <text start="485.399" dur="4.411">because that&amp;#39;s another one of my</text>
  <text start="487.199" dur="4.83">passions and Forte&amp;#39;s along with you know</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="5.609">looking into the science behind all the</text>
  <text start="492.029" dur="6.181">UFO and ascension stuff and at ancient</text>
  <text start="495.419" dur="8.18">history but just how to take care of</text>
  <text start="498.21" dur="5.389">ourselves our body so anyway we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
