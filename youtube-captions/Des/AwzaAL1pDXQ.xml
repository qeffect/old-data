  <text start="0.03" dur="10.26">hmm what are we gonna talk about today</text>
  <text start="3.799" dur="8.201">its plant medicine in this video really</text>
  <text start="10.29" dur="3.57">these videos are just cathartic to me</text>
  <text start="12" dur="4.619">it&amp;#39;s good to rant and get things off my</text>
  <text start="13.86" dur="6.839">chest and off my brain to whoever</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="5.731">decides to watch these videos and I hope</text>
  <text start="20.699" dur="3.75">to just help people become more aware</text>
  <text start="22.35" dur="4.679">and more conscious of what&amp;#39;s going on on</text>
  <text start="24.449" dur="5.361">this world and in their lives now in</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="6.03">this video I feel like talking about</text>
  <text start="29.81" dur="4.3">black projects right so I was just doing</text>
  <text start="33.059" dur="3.361">some research on that this morning</text>
  <text start="34.11" dur="6.15">when I make a video about it black</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="9.33">projects specifically aerospace and CIA</text>
  <text start="40.26" dur="7.2">black projects now it&amp;#39;s Tuesday usually</text>
  <text start="45.75" dur="3.899">I post silly memes on my facebook like</text>
  <text start="47.46" dur="4.71">Tesla Tuesdays but today I was</text>
  <text start="49.649" dur="5.521">researching t Townsend Brown so I call</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="6.77">it t Townsend Tuesdays and T Townsend</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="6.389">Brown was if you don&amp;#39;t know all right</text>
  <text start="58.94" dur="4.27">talk about many research was quite a bit</text>
  <text start="61.559" dur="5.661">but if you don&amp;#39;t know Thomas Townsend</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="7.88">Brown was he was a physicist who was</text>
  <text start="67.22" dur="7.96">doing experiments on how to levitate</text>
  <text start="71.09" dur="6.04">metal discs with electricity he would</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="4.68">use a very high electrical voltage from</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="4.59">the kilowatt to megawatt range I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="5.84">know the specific numbers but he would</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="7.829">Electrify these metal discs and I</text>
  <text start="85.7" dur="7.45">believe if technical speak of it is that</text>
  <text start="89.549" dur="5.491">he altered the angular momentum of the</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="5.64">particles themselves to make them more</text>
  <text start="95.04" dur="7.009">massless and was able to levitate large</text>
  <text start="98.79" dur="8.369">discs and literally propel them around</text>
  <text start="102.049" dur="9.971">with electricity he was doing this in</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="7.081">the 1920s in the 1930s if this man was</text>
  <text start="112.02" dur="5.099">making metal disk levitate a hundred</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="8.97">freaking years ago which then you know</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="11.161">his research was then subsumed whether</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="6.779">it was bought or give in or whatever it</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="4.26">subsumed into it the RAND Corporation</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="3.401">the RAND Corporation is a very large</text>
  <text start="132.54" dur="2.92">Corp</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="6">think-tank of scientists well they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="135.46" dur="7.62">just go think about and basically</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="7.29">ponder all the fun technology that they</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t give us it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the the black</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="4.35">projects of the military-industrial</text>
  <text start="147.85" dur="5.22">complex now if like I said Tom and</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="6.65">Townsend Brown was making disks levitate</text>
  <text start="153.07" dur="4.61">a hundred years ago what do we have now</text>
  <text start="157.71" dur="8.71">good question what do we have now so I</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="8.14">don&amp;#39;t know if you remember or know this</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="6.93">a man named Donald Rumsfeld pretty</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="4.95">famous politician I was talking about</text>
  <text start="173.35" dur="4.56">him earlier actually I was you know</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="5.55">discussing how he owned the patents for</text>
  <text start="177.91" dur="6.799">aspartame and and shuttled that through</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="6.06">Congress as telling client that but the</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="4.691">political Donald Rumsfeld when he was</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="4.589">what was he in George Bush&amp;#39;s cabinet as</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="5.7">a I remember defense secretary or some</text>
  <text start="191.709" dur="6.421"> regardless he testified in front of</text>
  <text start="195.1" dur="8.76">Congress the day before 9/11 on</text>
  <text start="198.13" dur="8.4">September 10th 2001 to two point three</text>
  <text start="203.86" dur="5.55">trillion dollars that the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="6.06">couldn&amp;#39;t account for that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="4.56">lien with T now if Donald Rumsfeld is</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="2.22">testifying the two point three trillion</text>
  <text start="213.97" dur="3.09">dollars</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="8.929">well hey where the did that money</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="11.58">go and B what is it now that was like</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="11.321">what was that mm once 2017 67 16 years</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="8.04">ago 15 16 and some some change so you</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="3.6">know I don&amp;#39;t know if you also know this</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="4.14">report but I remember last year eight</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="4.079">the Department of Defense DoD report</text>
  <text start="240.82" dur="8.34">came out stating that number is six</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="8.461">point five trillion dollars and dr.</text>
  <text start="249.16" dur="4.109">Steven Greer of the disclosure project I</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="4.71">believe in one of his lectures mentioned</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="4.861">even nine upwards of nine to ten</text>
  <text start="255.91" dur="3.93">trillion so they have a ton of</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="3.63">money that the Pentagon is just swiped</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="5.03">and that&amp;#39;s just what the Pentagon and</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="3.11">you know through whatever</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="5.73">books they could swipe at the end of the</text>
  <text start="269.169" dur="5.191">year basically is what happens</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="4.06">that&amp;#39;s just what they couldn&amp;#39;t account</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="5.88">for through on the public record imagine</text>
  <text start="276.61" dur="5.01">what these these bloodline families are</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="2.13">these shadow syndicates whatever you</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="4.079">want to call them</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="5.46">imagine what they get off the off-book</text>
  <text start="285.699" dur="4.711">straight like drug their drug trade and</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re trafficking human trafficking</text>
  <text start="290.41" dur="4.92">and sex trade with all the real and</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="8.399">weapons as well all the real deep dark</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="8.76"> so man nine trillion and then some</text>
  <text start="301.449" dur="6.961">I mean not only as that money used to</text>
  <text start="304.09" dur="5.82">build a infrastructure a covert</text>
  <text start="308.41" dur="3.569">infrastructure they don&amp;#39;t tell us but</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="4.5">let&amp;#39;s be real the technology that they</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="6.631">could build you know T Townsend Brown</text>
  <text start="314.41" dur="7.59">was building out these disks one hundred</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="5.67">years ago and then you know they swiped</text>
  <text start="322" dur="4.139">Tesla&amp;#39;s papers there&amp;#39;s all this research</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="6.33">that they have they could build a</text>
  <text start="326.139" dur="6.241">completely self-sustaining network</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="3.51">system outside of our current</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="5.789">civilization of that we know of on this</text>
  <text start="334.12" dur="6.54">planet so these black projects obviously</text>
  <text start="338.169" dur="6.361">the technologies there right Tetons and</text>
  <text start="340.66" dur="5.7">brown stuff I mean and then you know</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="4.699">hundred years of research and</text>
  <text start="346.36" dur="5.79">development with essentially an infinite</text>
  <text start="349.229" dur="5.801">infinite amount of resources and money</text>
  <text start="352.15" dur="6">at their disposal what don&amp;#39;t we know</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="6.33">about huh why don&amp;#39;t people ask these</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="6.51"> questions I&amp;#39;ve I curse it gets</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="4.47">me angry but B we really don&amp;#39;t logically</text>
  <text start="364.66" dur="3.95">put this stuff together and ask the</text>
  <text start="365.83" dur="5.82">questions of okay you got the research</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="5.44">they got the money why wouldn&amp;#39;t it be</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="4.38">something that they have you know what</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="5.1">really are these UFO sightings that</text>
  <text start="376.03" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing and are they really on</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="7.07">other planets probably it&amp;#39;s a reason we</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="6.2">ain&amp;#39;t gone back to the moon in 80 years</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="10.21">well we have these I&amp;#39;m told us about it</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="9.76">so yeah it&amp;#39;s very interesting and along</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="3.72">the lines of the technology they they</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="3.36">have as well at their disposal</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="5.46">not only was Tetons and brown</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="9.39">researching these disappointed years ago</text>
  <text start="405.61" dur="7.11">but Roswell occurred and other so-called</text>
  <text start="411.07" dur="6.06">treaties between humans and</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="6.57">extraterrestrial civilizations massive</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="3.99">technology exchange and then when Ross</text>
  <text start="419.29" dur="6.84">we know when the Roswell crash occurred</text>
  <text start="421.12" dur="7.79">and with the best the best explanation</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="9.03">I&amp;#39;ve heard for what Roswell actually was</text>
  <text start="428.91" dur="8.65">from Greer who said that the US was</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="4.95">testing scalar weaponry right he has an</text>
  <text start="437.56" dur="4.29">FBI document that says what the FBI</text>
  <text start="440.11" dur="5">document says is they were testing radar</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="7.86">and then that&amp;#39;s what took down two</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="6.4">and/or three disks actually took down</text>
  <text start="449.71" dur="4.019">the disks and you know sergeant Clifford</text>
  <text start="451.51" dur="4.23">stone said they recovered bodies so</text>
  <text start="453.729" dur="3.391">these Roswell occurred they took down</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="4.26">this what probably happened was they</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="4.88">were testing a you know primitive scalar</text>
  <text start="460" dur="4.32">weaponry that they inherited from</text>
  <text start="462" dur="4.57">research from people Tesla in Townsend</text>
  <text start="464.32" dur="4.89">Brown and the like so it was a basically</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="5.099">a death ray Tesla scalar longitudinal</text>
  <text start="469.21" dur="4.5">point-to-point Boop death ray and they</text>
  <text start="471.669" dur="3.541">tested it on this on Roswell and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="2.67">what brought down the craft and then the</text>
  <text start="475.21" dur="4.44"> we were able to reverse-engineer</text>
  <text start="476.38" dur="8.52">from the craft like fiber optics Kevlar</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="6.48">and computer chips so they found out</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="2.97">what they could reverse-engineer from</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="2.969">Roswell and what they could profit off</text>
  <text start="487.87" dur="2.43">of with all that and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="489.099" dur="4.621">done ever since they just haven&amp;#39;t given</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="7.02">us the good research so yeah what&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="493.72" dur="5.55">these black projects it&amp;#39;s just I could</text>
  <text start="497.32" dur="4.23">keep talking about it going to the</text>
  <text start="499.27" dur="4.019">Montauk Project and an MKULTRA and some</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="2.94">other dark stuff so hope you enjoyed</text>
  <text start="503.289" dur="3.091">that I&amp;#39;ll make some videos going into</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="4.14">the other projects but that one is just</text>
  <text start="506.38" dur="4.56">the aerospace company cuz you know my</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="4.38">thoughts on what could be what happened</text>
  <text start="510.94" dur="6.93">what has happened in what could be with</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="7.469">those black projects of UFO research and</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="3.81">free energy research and and zero-point</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="5.06">energy technology that we&amp;#39;re not giving</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="3.859">it to so hope you enjoyed that done</text>
