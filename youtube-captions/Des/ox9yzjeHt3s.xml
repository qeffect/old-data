  <text start="0.03" dur="4.019">yo what&amp;#39;s up everyone welcome welcome in</text>
  <text start="2.37" dur="3.75">this video I&amp;#39;m gonna be taking a look at</text>
  <text start="4.049" dur="4.441">a recent interview that red pill 78 and</text>
  <text start="6.12" dur="4.439">true reporting did with an individual by</text>
  <text start="8.49" dur="3.72">the name of John he calls himself John</text>
  <text start="10.559" dur="3.75">here to help and the reason I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="12.21" dur="4.409">this is because number one people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.309" dur="4.771">emotions are everywhere about this</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="4.17">either they&amp;#39;re super scared nervous some</text>
  <text start="19.08" dur="2.64">people are excited so it&amp;#39;s like a lot of</text>
  <text start="20.789" dur="3.931">people don&amp;#39;t know what to think about</text>
  <text start="21.72" dur="6.62">this and number two there are some crazy</text>
  <text start="24.72" dur="6.69">claims that were said in this interview</text>
  <text start="28.34" dur="5.29">apparently John had claimed he worked</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="5.16">for intelligence circles in the past</text>
  <text start="33.63" dur="5.67">worked on some very deep black projects</text>
  <text start="36.57" dur="4.62">and also said a lot of stuff about the</text>
  <text start="39.3" dur="4.009">deep state trying to control the world</text>
  <text start="41.19" dur="4.709">with different technologies and</text>
  <text start="43.309" dur="5.02">dimensional physics talk I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="45.899" dur="5.43">a lot set some pretty heavy stuff okay</text>
  <text start="48.329" dur="6.721">now the problem is that I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="6.721">people share this with zero thought</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="4.77">behind it it&amp;#39;s like oh here&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="3.18">person who claims to be an insider and</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re saying some words I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="61.23" dur="5.999">before so it must be true share and</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s not how it works folks a big part</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="5.551">of waking up is honing your discernment</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="7.5">skills and when people tend to hear</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="5.94">sensational stuff it becomes emotional</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="5.01">for them they get tied into believing it</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="5.37">for whatever reason and they don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="5.37">through that discernment process so my</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="4.83">effort here is to do that proper</text>
  <text start="87.21" dur="4.26">journalism so what I went ahead and did</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="5.78">this morning is that I listened to the</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="5.189">whole interview and I wrote down</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="4.54">different quotes that were said</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="4.441">different allegations that I&amp;#39;ve got some</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="4.169">questions about so we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="4.08">through that but before I get into this</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="6.451">I first want to preface this by saying</text>
  <text start="105.18" dur="8.49">that this bears nothing on red pill 78</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="5.67">and true reporting okay I think they are</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="3.479">fantastic channels I&amp;#39;ve called in to</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="3.33">both of their channels before I think</text>
  <text start="117.149" dur="4.591">they do great work and they&amp;#39;re very well</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="4.469">intentioned dudes so don&amp;#39;t shoot the</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="2.82">messenger with this one I&amp;#39;m definitely</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="4.761">not shooting the messenger I still</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="7.56">support them my point here is to just</text>
  <text start="128.09" dur="5.83">discern what&amp;#39;s being said so I&amp;#39;m taking</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="4.26">what was claimed</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="5.039">and putting that against my</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="3.72">knowledgebase the research I&amp;#39;ve done the</text>
  <text start="138.959" dur="2.791">conversations I&amp;#39;ve had and also</text>
  <text start="140.1" dur="4.32">information that&amp;#39;s out there in the</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="4.35">public domain because in going through</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="4.83">this interview and listening to what was</text>
  <text start="146.1" dur="5.43">said there&amp;#39;s a lot of discrepancies that</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="4.8">I noticed and that&amp;#39;s why I just I just</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="5.58">got questions you know I&amp;#39;m not throwing</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="4.86">this out in the trash but I&amp;#39;m not 100%</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="5.91">believing it and sharing it like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.91" dur="8.07">the truth so let&amp;#39;s take a breath take a</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="5.55">sec and study this stuff now beginning</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="3.96">getting into this we&amp;#39;re just gonna do it</text>
  <text start="168.57" dur="4.05">chronologically here you know I have</text>
  <text start="170.94" dur="3.99">some of the timestamps of things that</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="4.56">were said if you want to go double-check</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="4.529">it but the first few minutes the first</text>
  <text start="177.18" dur="5.49">about five minutes of this interview was</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="5.341">really John giving his background he</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="5.49">said that he worked in military</text>
  <text start="184.8" dur="5.43">intelligence he also specified civilian</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="6.41">intelligence and said that he has a</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="7.02">background in science he also said that</text>
  <text start="194.57" dur="4.87">when he was younger he designed and</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="5.04">tested encryption algorithms on</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="4.799">satellites he did that before College he</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="4.86">built satellites then he went into the</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="5.371">military and worked in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="4.619">field towards the end and then</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="5.7">apparently became a minister I guess</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="6.121">once he got out now that&amp;#39;s all we really</text>
  <text start="215.31" dur="4.86">have to go off of in this interview</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="4.83">okay no more details we&amp;#39;re really giving</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="4.289">given about his background which me</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="4.109">personally I would have liked a bit more</text>
  <text start="224.459" dur="4.5">to establish some more credibility with</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="5.401">this individual like he could have</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="7.351">specified what specific Sciences or</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="6.479">scientists that he&amp;#39;s researched you know</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="5.55">what college what military branch what</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="4.771">intelligence service now I get somebody</text>
  <text start="241.86" dur="2.58">might not want to Doc&amp;#39;s themselves and</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="3.66">put all sorts of personal information</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="4.53">out there but when we have an insider</text>
  <text start="247.14" dur="4.61">that&amp;#39;s claiming some of the things that</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="5.04">this dude claimed in this talk that</text>
  <text start="251.75" dur="4.72">credibility is important all right so a</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="5.49">few things I have on that then we get</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="6.12">into about minute five to minute oh</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ll go down to minute ten here okay</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="4.89">sort of the next section of this</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="6.15">interview then he starts getting into</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="5.04">some of the work that he claimed to do</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="6">on different projects and a little bit</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="5.85">of dimensional science talk few things I</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="5.85">found weird about that at about minute</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="6.06">five he said that he had ties to project</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="5.97">looking glass and even quickly said he</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="6.12">worked on project looking glass then he</text>
  <text start="288.12" dur="6.2">said project Looking Glass was working</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="6.9">on time and it was an offshoot of</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="5.77">zero-point energy research that was</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="5.76">related to quantum physics I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="7.8">stop there couple things on this project</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="8.13">Looking Glass according to the publicly</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="5.25">available sources that we have putting</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="5.25">together the picture as to what project</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="4.95">Looking Glass was I know tons of people</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="5.13">out there have done videos on that in</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="5.58">recent weeks after Hugh mentioned it but</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="5.4">project Looking Glass was done back in</text>
  <text start="323.67" dur="6.39">the 70s that&amp;#39;s our best guess like the</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="6">late 70s early 80s around that time</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="6.42">frame that was quite a while ago okay</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="5.67">and project Looking Glass if any</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="3.93">projects are still going on I&amp;#39;m I would</text>
  <text start="338.79" dur="3">venture to guess they are but if any</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="2.91">projects are still going on that are</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="4.17">similar to project Looking Glass or</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="4.47">working on that type of tech you can be</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="5.13">guaranteed it they&amp;#39;re not called project</text>
  <text start="347.79" dur="4.59">Looking Glass anymore the plg that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="5.25">talking about was done back you know</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="5.49">decades ago and then saying that it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="4.23">offshoot of zero-point energy research</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="5.93">not really the case project Looking</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="6.03">Glass yes was working with time-viewing</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="4.57">essentially but to say it&amp;#39;s an offshoot</text>
  <text start="366.6" dur="5.64">of zero-point energy research that is</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="6.18">like a huge stretch it&amp;#39;s a very vague</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="3.99">statement that doesn&amp;#39;t really go</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="3.18">together and then also saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.23" dur="4.17">related to quantum physics it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="377.73" dur="4.32">very weird thing because a lot of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="3.81">out there in the mainstream scientific</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="4.62">domain in regards to quantum physics I</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="5.07">think is bunk I think it&amp;#39;s garbage get</text>
  <text start="386.67" dur="5.46">in and I think that&amp;#39;s why the standard</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="4.5">of model of physics and the standard</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="3.41">quantum physics models out there they</text>
  <text start="393.78" dur="4.5">can&amp;#39;t reconcile because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.54" dur="5.08">misinformation in both that scientists</text>
  <text start="398.28" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t realize so there&amp;#39;s just some odd</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="3.45">statement</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="4.35">here that were said that you know I</text>
  <text start="404.07" dur="4.11">would like to know more about that</text>
  <text start="405.72" dur="6.03">particular science background that gives</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="7.17">him this worldview and then moving on he</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="8.1">says the timeline is converging into</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="9.36">another dimension close to us very weird</text>
  <text start="419.85" dur="8.22">because in my study of the true physics</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="5.76">of space and time and dimensionalities</text>
  <text start="428.07" dur="5.64">that statement really makes no sense I</text>
  <text start="430.47" dur="6.09">do a lot of study into of course Nikola</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="5.85">Tesla Walter Russell and them but also a</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="5.04">lot of study into Dewey B Larsen okay</text>
  <text start="439.56" dur="3.389">Dewey B Larson was a physicist I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="3.15">videos on my channel before I even</text>
  <text start="442.949" dur="3.291">mentioned him briefly when it did my</text>
  <text start="444.75" dur="4.699">project Looking Glass video recently</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="7.929">doobie Larsen was an engineer in the</text>
  <text start="449.449" dur="7.271">1906 TS and 70s who did some incredible</text>
  <text start="454.169" dur="4.021">research in creating was basically a</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="4.62">theory of everything he called it the</text>
  <text start="458.19" dur="6.75">reciprocal Systems Theory and according</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="5.009">to him space and time are reciprocals</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re not separate from each other</text>
  <text start="466.349" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re very much linked as we often</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="3.059">hear all points in space and time are</text>
  <text start="469.71" dur="4.25">connected well that&amp;#39;s because space and</text>
  <text start="471.389" dur="5.421">time are reciprocals of each other and</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="5.5">we also know if we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="476.81" dur="5.32">dimensions we exist in multiple</text>
  <text start="479.46" dur="4.709">dimensions at once this is something I</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="5.55">often tweet about I often say is that</text>
  <text start="484.169" dur="5.341">people are out there thinking that this</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="3.78">physical reality is different from like</text>
  <text start="489.51" dur="4.65">the interdimensional reality or whatever</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="5.22">nomenclature they particularly use when</text>
  <text start="494.16" dur="5.43">you got understand we exist in a</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="7.44">physical and a metaphysical realm at the</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="6.06">same time we exist in space-time or the</text>
  <text start="504.12" dur="3.81">physical realm that&amp;#39;s where our bodies</text>
  <text start="505.65" dur="5.34">are meat suits and then we also exist in</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="4.89">a spiritual realm metaphysical realm or</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="4.2">the realm of the mind because of course</text>
  <text start="512.82" dur="4.139">everything has consciousness you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="5.55">separate that all life is</text>
  <text start="516.959" dur="6.33">interdimensional okay and space-time and</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="5.43">time-space only have so many dimensions</text>
  <text start="523.289" dur="5.311">because a dimension is a unit of measure</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="4.44">how you measure something it&amp;#39;s not you</text>
  <text start="528.6" dur="5.1">know calling it a plane of existence or</text>
  <text start="530.61" dur="4.69">a realm it&amp;#39;s kind of not a proper way of</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="4.75">describing these things may</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="5.219">we could say realm or different density</text>
  <text start="538.45" dur="3.72">or different plane of existence but</text>
  <text start="540.519" dur="4.831">that&amp;#39;s a lot different than a dimension</text>
  <text start="542.17" dur="7.47">okay so if we&amp;#39;re gonna talk science we</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="5.76">need to properly define our descriptors</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re using and I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="4.469">throw that D word that dimension out</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="3.239">there without really defining it</text>
  <text start="555.579" dur="2.521">properly</text>
  <text start="556.209" dur="2.88">he doesn&amp;#39;t really define it here and he</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="2.52">says a lot of things that are weird in</text>
  <text start="559.089" dur="3.091">regard to dimensions like timeline</text>
  <text start="560.62" dur="3.81">converging into another dimension close</text>
  <text start="562.18" dur="5.49">to us here&amp;#39;s the thing if we were to</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="5.31">freeze this moment of now that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="4.229">that would exist there&amp;#39;s no like</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="4.17">dimension behind us or dimension in</text>
  <text start="571.899" dur="3.661">front of us that&amp;#39;s gonna like run into</text>
  <text start="573.91" dur="4.71">ours or something like that you know it</text>
  <text start="575.56" dur="7.23">makes no sense there&amp;#39;s only one point in</text>
  <text start="578.62" dur="8.67">time that exists that&amp;#39;s now the future</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="5.91">is all probability the past doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="3.45">really exist anymore and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="588.7" dur="4.41">all probability as well only thing is</text>
  <text start="590.74" dur="4.89">that exist is now so and again this is</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="3.84">research you can look into you know do</text>
  <text start="595.63" dur="2.73">we be Larsson as I&amp;#39;ve said I&amp;#39;ll link</text>
  <text start="596.95" dur="2.97">some stuff below in regards to that but</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="2.82">again a lot of the information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.92" dur="4.169">out there in the public domain is</text>
  <text start="601.18" dur="5.61">contradicting things he said then he</text>
  <text start="604.089" dur="4.801">goes on I&amp;#39;m about minute six seven here</text>
  <text start="606.79" dur="3.87">says project Pandora talks about another</text>
  <text start="608.89" dur="4.41">project Pandora was to study this</text>
  <text start="610.66" dur="5.1">dimension now again we have a time</text>
  <text start="613.3" dur="6.15">discrepancy just like project Looking</text>
  <text start="615.76" dur="5.85">Glass project Pandora was a project that</text>
  <text start="619.45" dur="6.3">was done back in the 1960s and it was</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="6.09">done by DARPA it was done by DARPA on</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="4.89">behalf of the US government after the</text>
  <text start="627.7" dur="5.19">government found that the US Embassy in</text>
  <text start="630.64" dur="5.009">the Soviet Union was being bombarded by</text>
  <text start="632.89" dur="5.16">gigahertz frequencies for like years on</text>
  <text start="635.649" dur="5.371">and off once the government found out</text>
  <text start="638.05" dur="5.72">about that they tasked DARPA to do some</text>
  <text start="641.02" dur="5.069">research under project Pandora about</text>
  <text start="643.77" dur="4.99">mind control via electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="646.089" dur="5.851">frequencies and again this was done back</text>
  <text start="648.76" dur="4.38">in the 60s so if this dude claims to</text>
  <text start="651.94" dur="4.86">have worked on project Looking Glass and</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="7.62">project Pandora projects that were done</text>
  <text start="656.8" dur="7.159">decades ago this dude has to be like at</text>
  <text start="660.76" dur="4.949">least 80 like maybe in the late 70s</text>
  <text start="663.959" dur="4.63">assuming you would have been like maybe</text>
  <text start="665.709" dur="3.421">late 20s early 30s at the youngest</text>
  <text start="668.589" dur="2.521">working on</text>
  <text start="669.13" dur="3.18">projects and in listening to the</text>
  <text start="671.11" dur="3.69">interview he definitely didn&amp;#39;t sound</text>
  <text start="672.31" dur="5.04">like he was in his late 70s or 80s so</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="5.07">the time discrepancies they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="5.37">really weird to me now I understand that</text>
  <text start="679.87" dur="6.12">in the intelligence world sometimes</text>
  <text start="682.72" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;ll call a super deep black project</text>
  <text start="685.99" dur="5.28">that they want to keep secret the same</text>
  <text start="688.12" dur="4.92">name as a much less secret unclassified</text>
  <text start="691.27" dur="4.23">project for plausible deniability</text>
  <text start="693.04" dur="5.28">reasons that way if the an intelligence</text>
  <text start="695.5" dur="4.86">officer was asked about the name of this</text>
  <text start="698.32" dur="4.17">project that guy&amp;#39;s a oh you mean this</text>
  <text start="700.36" dur="4.26">benign one over here and it&amp;#39;s an easy</text>
  <text start="702.49" dur="4.13">way to you know brush that project under</text>
  <text start="704.62" dur="6.18">the rug by calling them the same names</text>
  <text start="706.62" dur="6.85">they sort of umbrella them like that but</text>
  <text start="710.8" dur="4.41">this guy John he didn&amp;#39;t talk about that</text>
  <text start="713.47" dur="3.03">he didn&amp;#39;t describe that he just says</text>
  <text start="715.21" dur="3.54">that he worked for project looking last</text>
  <text start="716.5" dur="4.77">in project Pandora which were friggin</text>
  <text start="718.75" dur="4.44">4050 years ago so that&amp;#39;s really weird to</text>
  <text start="721.27" dur="4.2">me that&amp;#39;s one of the most weird things</text>
  <text start="723.19" dur="3.57">that stood out to me he said we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="725.47" dur="3.14">know what the effect would be if we</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="5.22">communicate with the NIP next dimension</text>
  <text start="728.61" dur="6.75">again it&amp;#39;s a sort of a substance list</text>
  <text start="731.98" dur="6.84">statement because we exist in multiple</text>
  <text start="735.36" dur="5.47">dimensions or realms physical</text>
  <text start="738.82" dur="3.78">non-physical at the same time and yeah</text>
  <text start="740.83" dur="4.14">you can communicate through that next</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="4.77">dimension with your self-awareness with</text>
  <text start="744.97" dur="4.41">your consciousness man that&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="747.37" dur="3.45">thing he doesn&amp;#39;t talk about in regards</text>
  <text start="749.38" dur="3.36">to project Looking Glass is the</text>
  <text start="750.82" dur="3.81">consciousness component or the remote</text>
  <text start="752.74" dur="3.39">viewing that was said to be done in</text>
  <text start="754.63" dur="4.28">project Looking Glass to try to view</text>
  <text start="756.13" dur="6.18">time he doesn&amp;#39;t mention that at all so</text>
  <text start="758.91" dur="4.3">again a lot of these science that said</text>
  <text start="762.31" dur="4.08">here is odd</text>
  <text start="763.21" dur="5.88">he says using electromagnetic waves to</text>
  <text start="766.39" dur="5.22">create a field that allows penetration</text>
  <text start="769.09" dur="3.9">into the next dimension john was asked</text>
  <text start="771.61" dur="4.02">you know how do they do this how do they</text>
  <text start="772.99" dur="4.95">look or work with time and he says using</text>
  <text start="775.63" dur="3.96">electromagnetic waves to create fields</text>
  <text start="777.94" dur="3.66">that allow penetration into the next</text>
  <text start="779.59" dur="3.45">dimension well you know again</text>
  <text start="781.6" dur="2.97">referencing back to the dweeby Larsson</text>
  <text start="783.04" dur="5.25">physics he was actually saying that</text>
  <text start="784.57" dur="6.99">electromagnetic waves are force field</text>
  <text start="788.29" dur="5.7">basically motion within the spiritual</text>
  <text start="791.56" dur="4.47">realm or the metaphysical realm the he</text>
  <text start="793.99" dur="3.87">called it the cosmic sector material</text>
  <text start="796.03" dur="4.92">sector cosmic sector that&amp;#39;s what he</text>
  <text start="797.86" dur="4.86">denoted the physical and metaphysical</text>
  <text start="800.95" dur="3.6">sectors he called it</text>
  <text start="802.72" dur="5.01">Kosmic so he was saying that</text>
  <text start="804.55" dur="6.3">electromagnetic frequencies or waves are</text>
  <text start="807.73" dur="6.45">actually emanations from the cosmic</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="4.799">sector we&amp;#39;re done uh just research do we</text>
  <text start="814.18" dur="3.06">be Larsson stuff you know links of stuff</text>
  <text start="815.649" dur="4.021">down below it&amp;#39;s pretty incredible and it</text>
  <text start="817.24" dur="7.349">connected a lot of dots but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="819.67" dur="6.359">vibe well with this and then John goes</text>
  <text start="824.589" dur="4.261">on to say he doesn&amp;#39;t think we have</text>
  <text start="826.029" dur="4.74">quantum computers which some people may</text>
  <text start="828.85" dur="3.57">disagree with he also states that</text>
  <text start="830.769" dur="4.711">project Pandora</text>
  <text start="832.42" dur="5.669">he said they started this at CERN but</text>
  <text start="835.48" dur="5.64">they shut down CERN for energy to run</text>
  <text start="838.089" dur="5.37">computers for project Pandora again</text>
  <text start="841.12" dur="4.11">project Pandora you know the publicly</text>
  <text start="843.459" dur="4.201">available info on it was from back in</text>
  <text start="845.23" dur="5.13">the 60s but assuming there&amp;#39;s a modern</text>
  <text start="847.66" dur="5.039">project Pandora that&amp;#39;s running now to</text>
  <text start="850.36" dur="4.019">say that they shut down CERN for energy</text>
  <text start="852.699" dur="5.75">to run computers for project Pandora</text>
  <text start="854.379" dur="6.781">well number one CERN is an organization</text>
  <text start="858.449" dur="4.75">CERN is the organization that runs the</text>
  <text start="861.16" dur="5.429">Large Hadron Collider they&amp;#39;re over in</text>
  <text start="863.199" dur="6.12">Europe so he didn&amp;#39;t really verbally</text>
  <text start="866.589" dur="5.49">state that the correct way they shut</text>
  <text start="869.319" dur="3.69">down the Large Hadron Collider is what</text>
  <text start="872.079" dur="2.971">he should have said it would have made a</text>
  <text start="873.009" dur="4.32">lot more sense in the context of this</text>
  <text start="875.05" dur="4.44">statement but he&amp;#39;s also saying they shut</text>
  <text start="877.329" dur="4.68">down CERN to run energy computers for</text>
  <text start="879.49" dur="4.349">project Pandora it just kind of makes no</text>
  <text start="882.009" dur="4.2">sense to me especially if he mentioned</text>
  <text start="883.839" dur="3.69">zero-point energy research earlier like</text>
  <text start="886.209" dur="3.451">why would they need to shut down that</text>
  <text start="887.529" dur="3.99">for energy to run not just that but the</text>
  <text start="889.66" dur="4.2">Large Hadron colliders over in Europe</text>
  <text start="891.519" dur="4.531">you think they would shut down or divert</text>
  <text start="893.86" dur="5.64">energy from here in America if they were</text>
  <text start="896.05" dur="6.779">doing projects here in America anyway</text>
  <text start="899.5" dur="6.569">moving on about minute eight eight or</text>
  <text start="902.829" dur="5.341">nine he promotes some of instance</text>
  <text start="906.069" dur="5.971">theories says we can&amp;#39;t travel faster</text>
  <text start="908.17" dur="5.789">than light yet which again if you</text>
  <text start="912.04" dur="4.289">research into the black projects and the</text>
  <text start="913.959" dur="4.23">secret space programs he already have</text>
  <text start="916.329" dur="3.69">electrochromatic technology they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="918.189" dur="4.26">it for 80 years there&amp;#39;s all sorts of</text>
  <text start="920.019" dur="5.43">documentaries out there and articles you</text>
  <text start="922.449" dur="4.32">can read and info whistleblowers alleged</text>
  <text start="925.449" dur="3.981">insiders that have talked about these</text>
  <text start="926.769" dur="5.37">things and I would venture to guess that</text>
  <text start="929.43" dur="5.61">yeah surely some of those black projects</text>
  <text start="932.139" dur="4.471">that the Air Force of the Navy or the</text>
  <text start="935.04" dur="4.69">intelligence community</text>
  <text start="936.61" dur="4.52">I figured out how to move a craft faster</text>
  <text start="939.73" dur="3.78">than the speed of light they figured out</text>
  <text start="941.13" dur="6.22">how to control gravity with electricity</text>
  <text start="943.51" dur="6.24">and then you know you can say call them</text>
  <text start="947.35" dur="5.58">torsion drives or the mercury vortex</text>
  <text start="949.75" dur="5.43">engines or you know whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="952.93" dur="7.02">call them there&amp;#39;s a lot of information</text>
  <text start="955.18" dur="6.27">out there and people we could say that</text>
  <text start="959.95" dur="3.69">are in the know or were in the know</text>
  <text start="961.45" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re saying that yeah we have already</text>
  <text start="963.64" dur="6">solved that equation how to move that</text>
  <text start="966.82" dur="6.42">fast so the fact that he said that odd</text>
  <text start="969.64" dur="7.05">to me I figured like if he was in a deep</text>
  <text start="973.24" dur="4.89">deep black program something at the</text>
  <text start="976.69" dur="4.19">depth of say a project Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="978.13" dur="7.37">type program he should know those things</text>
  <text start="980.88" dur="6.579">and also promoting Einstein&amp;#39;s theories</text>
  <text start="985.5" dur="6.459">we&amp;#39;ll talk about that more in a second</text>
  <text start="987.459" dur="6.931">he goes on to a few minutes of a little</text>
  <text start="991.959" dur="4.261">more discussion on the dimensions stuff</text>
  <text start="994.39" dur="3.81">which is just odd to me like I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="996.22" dur="3.27">saying let&amp;#39;s see here about minute</text>
  <text start="998.2" dur="6.21">fourteen fifteen</text>
  <text start="999.49" dur="7.289">he said the deep state or the he was</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="4.83">saying basically the good guys don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1006.779" dur="5.93">control don&amp;#39;t have access to project</text>
  <text start="1009.24" dur="6.87">Looking Glass technology which</text>
  <text start="1012.709" dur="4.451">completely contradicts really everything</text>
  <text start="1016.11" dur="2.64">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about in regards to</text>
  <text start="1017.16" dur="1.919">project Looking Glass for the last few</text>
  <text start="1018.75" dur="2.13">weeks</text>
  <text start="1019.079" dur="3.601">because if Q&amp;#39;s mentioning it we have all</text>
  <text start="1020.88" dur="3.419">the future proves past stuff I mean how</text>
  <text start="1022.68" dur="3.21">much evidence do we have that yeah the</text>
  <text start="1024.299" dur="3.841">good guys the Alliance they have access</text>
  <text start="1025.89" dur="4.77">to these sorts of programs and</text>
  <text start="1028.14" dur="4.529">technologies that was a statement that</text>
  <text start="1030.66" dur="3.48">didn&amp;#39;t sit well with me then he said a</text>
  <text start="1032.669" dur="4.711">lot of things were put in place under</text>
  <text start="1034.14" dur="4.86">the obama administration again it</text>
  <text start="1037.38" dur="5.16">wouldn&amp;#39;t be called project looking-glass</text>
  <text start="1039" dur="7.38">if we had a modern variant of the</text>
  <text start="1042.54" dur="6.3">project moving on a minute 1819 he talks</text>
  <text start="1046.38" dur="4.59">about working for a project cleaning up</text>
  <text start="1048.84" dur="5.19">signals from space detected on satellite</text>
  <text start="1050.97" dur="5.9">probes so now we get into a lot of talk</text>
  <text start="1054.03" dur="5.67">where he basically claims that he</text>
  <text start="1056.87" dur="3.7">figured out oh gosh they called it all</text>
  <text start="1059.7" dur="3.45">sorts of different things in this</text>
  <text start="1060.57" dur="5.04">interview they called it the universal</text>
  <text start="1063.15" dur="4.08">frequency or the magical frequency they</text>
  <text start="1065.61" dur="4.41">were even calling it the voice of god</text>
  <text start="1067.23" dur="3.31">but apparently this was a third project</text>
  <text start="1070.02" dur="2.8">he worked</text>
  <text start="1070.54" dur="3.36">he called it project Deep Space nine he</text>
  <text start="1072.82" dur="3.65">said the first one he worked on was</text>
  <text start="1073.9" dur="4.38">looking glass than Pandora if he did</text>
  <text start="1076.47" dur="3.55">then he said he worked on a project</text>
  <text start="1078.28" dur="5.7">called Deep Space nine which was like a</text>
  <text start="1080.02" dur="4.65">side project he was doing or something</text>
  <text start="1083.98" dur="3.24">to that effect</text>
  <text start="1084.67" dur="5.94">and that&amp;#39;s when he said he was working</text>
  <text start="1087.22" dur="6.24">on cleaning up signals from space</text>
  <text start="1090.61" dur="4.92">detected on satellite probes and he said</text>
  <text start="1093.46" dur="4.62">he was recording the first areas of</text>
  <text start="1095.53" dur="5.55">where the Big Bang occurred and this was</text>
  <text start="1098.08" dur="5.79">a huge WTF moment for me because he was</text>
  <text start="1101.08" dur="5.58">promoting the Big Bang as if it was real</text>
  <text start="1103.87" dur="5.76">and this ties back into the Einstein</text>
  <text start="1106.66" dur="7.05">thing I just mentioned a minute ago let</text>
  <text start="1109.63" dur="6.08">me just say this I have personally</text>
  <text start="1113.71" dur="5.28">talked to people who have worked for</text>
  <text start="1115.71" dur="5.53">secret think tanks before Colin black</text>
  <text start="1118.99" dur="5.79">project I have talked to people that</text>
  <text start="1121.24" dur="7.17">have talked to people that have worked</text>
  <text start="1124.78" dur="6.33">in black projects classified programs</text>
  <text start="1128.41" dur="4.89">before the nomenclature they use in the</text>
  <text start="1131.11" dur="5.16">way they talk they never ever reference</text>
  <text start="1133.3" dur="5.52">Einstein nor the Big Bang and in fact</text>
  <text start="1136.27" dur="4.11">the way they talk and they understand</text>
  <text start="1138.82" dur="3.63">that standard model physics the stuff</text>
  <text start="1140.38" dur="5.7">that&amp;#39;s promoted in the mainstream it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1142.45" dur="7.8">wrong it&amp;#39;s based off flawed foundations</text>
  <text start="1146.08" dur="7.26">and again I feel like if this guy had</text>
  <text start="1150.25" dur="5.94">actually worked at the levels that he</text>
  <text start="1153.34" dur="4.62">says he worked with the projects I mean</text>
  <text start="1156.19" dur="3.93">with the technologies and the sciences</text>
  <text start="1157.96" dur="4.83">that he said he worked with he should</text>
  <text start="1160.12" dur="4.91">know these things or at least something</text>
  <text start="1162.79" dur="5.52">similar to them I&amp;#39;m not saying he has to</text>
  <text start="1165.03" dur="5.8">say the exact stuff that I&amp;#39;ve researched</text>
  <text start="1168.31" dur="5.96">before but promoting the Big Bang</text>
  <text start="1170.83" dur="5.91">promoting Einstein&amp;#39;s flawed theories I</text>
  <text start="1174.27" dur="2.74">don&amp;#39;t know it just didn&amp;#39;t sit well with</text>
  <text start="1176.74" dur="5.97">me</text>
  <text start="1177.01" dur="7.38">so moving on into minute 22 now he said</text>
  <text start="1182.71" dur="3.12">the same background saying or this</text>
  <text start="1184.39" dur="3.84">background signal that he found in this</text>
  <text start="1185.83" dur="6.72">project was the quote originator of the</text>
  <text start="1188.23" dur="6.75">Big Bang and then he said he finds this</text>
  <text start="1192.55" dur="5.28">signal in everything now it&amp;#39;s a weak</text>
  <text start="1194.98" dur="8.19">large signal that&amp;#39;s like a radioactive</text>
  <text start="1197.83" dur="6.12">wave and it triggered the Big Bang okay</text>
  <text start="1203.17" dur="5.13">so</text>
  <text start="1203.95" dur="6">so if there&amp;#39;s this Universal frequency</text>
  <text start="1208.3" dur="5.64">or like the frequency of God or whatever</text>
  <text start="1209.95" dur="6.39">they want to call it that he found what</text>

  <text start="1391.21" dur="6.57">sound to me like he was involved in that</text>
  <text start="1394.2" dur="5.83">let&amp;#39;s see here about minute 28 says the</text>
  <text start="1397.78" dur="3.45">Big Bang is the blueprint for everything</text>
  <text start="1400.03" dur="2.61">he said that multiple times through this</text>

  <text start="1402.64" dur="4.35">the blueprints the blueprint for</text>

  <text start="1412.45" dur="3.84">are connected but did he actually figure</text>
  <text start="1415.69" dur="3.06">that out</text>
  <text start="1416.29" dur="4.14">I don&amp;#39;t know minute 30 he starts talking</text>
  <text start="1418.75" dur="5.49">about the word of God</text>
  <text start="1420.43" dur="6.6">etc etc it keeps you know he claimed to</text>
  <text start="1424.24" dur="5.76">have been a minister or be a minister so</text>
  <text start="1427.03" dur="8.91">he takes that particular angle with this</text>
  <text start="1430" dur="7.8">but you know a lot of people are the</text>
  <text start="1435.94" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re becoming emotionally attached to</text>
  <text start="1437.8" dur="3.72">that angle because he&amp;#39;s saying those</text>
  <text start="1439.72" dur="3.45">things in using those terminologies in a</text>
  <text start="1441.52" dur="3.33">very religious sense then a lot of</text>
  <text start="1443.17" dur="4.05">religious people out there are like oh</text>
  <text start="1444.85" dur="3.87">then he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s real he&amp;#39;s true because</text>
  <text start="1447.22" dur="3.86">he&amp;#39;s saying the same things that I like</text>
  <text start="1448.72" dur="6.78">to hear you know and that&amp;#39;s not logical</text>
  <text start="1451.08" dur="7.81">deduction so we can&amp;#39;t let that cloud our</text>
  <text start="1455.5" dur="6.09">thinking minute 33 he said Obama started</text>
  <text start="1458.89" dur="7.77">working on this wondrous frequency I</text>
  <text start="1461.59" dur="6.42">suppose and minute 35 discussing mind</text>
  <text start="1466.66" dur="3.45">control technology with these</text>
  <text start="1468.01" dur="3.63">frequencies this is the Word of God</text>
  <text start="1470.11" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re using against us</text>
  <text start="1471.64" dur="5.7">he said and then he gets it on into</text>
  <text start="1474.4" dur="5.16">talking Iran and into talking elites</text>
  <text start="1477.34" dur="5.22">these elites and how they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="1479.56" dur="6.24">supposed miracle frequency he said Iran</text>
  <text start="1482.56" dur="6.9">is using this frequency on their people</text>
  <text start="1485.8" dur="5.9">and he said they&amp;#39;ve been doing so since</text>
  <text start="1489.46" dur="5.64">about 2008 because he was talking about</text>
  <text start="1491.7" dur="6.22">leaders like John Brennan and John Kerry</text>
  <text start="1495.1" dur="5.07">and he said they&amp;#39;re trying to go to Iran</text>
  <text start="1497.92" dur="4.74">now and like take back control of this</text>
  <text start="1500.17" dur="3.78">technology to I guess use it in America</text>
  <text start="1502.66" dur="3.42">or the Western countries or something</text>
  <text start="1503.95" dur="5.13">like that and you know that&amp;#39;s a claim</text>
  <text start="1506.08" dur="5.13">that sounds pretty out there minute 38</text>
  <text start="1509.08" dur="4.56">he says there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with 5g</text>
  <text start="1511.21" dur="4.26">which I wholeheartedly disagree with is</text>
  <text start="1513.64" dur="4.53">the problem with 5g is the freaking</text>
  <text start="1515.47" dur="4.05">frequencies they use period and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1518.17" dur="3.69">all sorts of information out there about</text>
  <text start="1519.52" dur="3.96">how 5g is wrong he said that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1521.86" dur="4.8">going to piggyback this miracle</text>
  <text start="1523.48" dur="5.13">frequency onto 5g technologies and</text>
  <text start="1526.66" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re trying to roll 5g out</text>
  <text start="1528.61" dur="4.08">to us is because of this like frequency</text>
  <text start="1530.98" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re gonna piggyback onto that he</text>
  <text start="1532.69" dur="4.2">says nothing about 5g inherently being</text>
  <text start="1534.58" dur="5.76">wrong itself which again weird I</text>
  <text start="1536.89" dur="6.84">disagree with let&amp;#39;s see here he goes on</text>
  <text start="1540.34" dur="5.55">to discussing I&amp;#39;m in at 41 he says all</text>
  <text start="1543.73" dur="4.8">the space references by the deep Staters</text>
  <text start="1545.89" dur="4.71">are referencing this frequency which</text>
  <text start="1548.53" dur="3.18">again I don&amp;#39;t think is the case being</text>
  <text start="1550.6" dur="2.49">that there&amp;#39;s plenty of other secret</text>
  <text start="1551.71" dur="4.05">space programs and other technologies</text>
  <text start="1553.09" dur="4.92">out there that there&amp;#39;s a lot of occult</text>
  <text start="1555.76" dur="5.61">space symbology to a reference and that</text>
  <text start="1558.01" dur="8.07">they could reference with then true</text>
  <text start="1561.37" dur="6.6">reporting at minute 42 he asks a really</text>
  <text start="1566.08" dur="3.99">good question I liked this because he</text>
  <text start="1567.97" dur="5.22">sort of pressed John here and John</text>
  <text start="1570.07" dur="3.45">didn&amp;#39;t answer it too well I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1573.19" dur="1.95">so</text>
  <text start="1573.52" dur="3.48">true reporting said if the deep state</text>
  <text start="1575.14" dur="4.59">has Looking Glass how did Hillary</text>
  <text start="1577" dur="5.07">Clinton lose that&amp;#39;s a damn good question</text>
  <text start="1579.73" dur="6.48">and then John said they can&amp;#39;t look that</text>
  <text start="1582.07" dur="5.76">far again from the publicly available</text>
  <text start="1586.21" dur="3.36">information we have on project looking</text>
  <text start="1587.83" dur="3.51">the last back in the 70s and 80s when</text>
  <text start="1589.57" dur="4.47">they were working on it they were able</text>
  <text start="1591.34" dur="4.44">to Remote View plenty of years into the</text>
  <text start="1594.04" dur="3.36">future and again remote viewing</text>
  <text start="1595.78" dur="4.73">consciousness something he didn&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="1597.4" dur="5.31">about in regards to that project but</text>
  <text start="1600.51" dur="3.55">it&amp;#39;s I mean there&amp;#39;s a lot of information</text>
  <text start="1602.71" dur="2.46">out there that says these things and he</text>
  <text start="1604.06" dur="2.73">didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1605.17" dur="3.06">talk about that too much he just said oh</text>
  <text start="1606.79" dur="4.52">they can&amp;#39;t look that far and sort of</text>
  <text start="1608.23" dur="6.39">sort of brushed off the question um</text>
  <text start="1611.31" dur="5.56">let&amp;#39;s see here he said getting in a</text>
  <text start="1614.62" dur="4.65">minute forty-four he said a lot of</text>
  <text start="1616.87" dur="5.34">people want him dead that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1619.27" dur="4.77">using a ghost phone apparently but when</text>
  <text start="1622.21" dur="4.08">I check his Twitter out every single</text>
  <text start="1624.04" dur="7.47">tweet he uses was from his Android phone</text>
  <text start="1626.29" dur="6.27">and I&amp;#39;ve also met some people that had</text>
  <text start="1631.51" dur="2.82">previously worked in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1632.56" dur="4.47">community before and they were basically</text>
  <text start="1634.33" dur="7.08">like dark they were on the run trying to</text>
  <text start="1637.03" dur="8.13">stay off grid and if this guy if people</text>
  <text start="1641.41" dur="5.37">want him dead I&amp;#39;m wondering why he has a</text>
  <text start="1645.16" dur="3.03">Twitter account the first place and</text>
  <text start="1646.78" dur="4.95">posts on it you know that can be</text>
  <text start="1648.19" dur="6.05">geotagged and whatnot it you know weird</text>
  <text start="1651.73" dur="5.88">things moving on here</text>
  <text start="1654.24" dur="4.84">let&amp;#39;s see minute 49 what I&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="1657.61" dur="2.55">over the last few days this is a biggie</text>
  <text start="1659.08" dur="3.66">this is where he starts going into</text>
  <text start="1660.16" dur="4.17">talking about the deep state folk trying</text>
  <text start="1662.74" dur="2.97">to gain control these technologies and</text>
  <text start="1664.33" dur="3.87">this I think is what freaked a lot of</text>
  <text start="1665.71" dur="4.38">people out because I don&amp;#39;t think a lot</text>
  <text start="1668.2" dur="3.3">of people really thought this through he</text>
  <text start="1670.09" dur="3.03">said what I&amp;#39;ve learned over the last few</text>
  <text start="1671.5" dur="5.34">days is John Brennan who I personally</text>
  <text start="1673.12" dur="7.8">briefed on this stuff many times that</text>
  <text start="1676.84" dur="7.08">was a very weird line that sort of tells</text>
  <text start="1680.92" dur="5.16">us according to his claims that he might</text>
  <text start="1683.92" dur="3.93">have been in the CIA I mean in the very</text>

  <text start="1687.85" dur="6.6">the civilian intelligence realm ie CIA</text>
  <text start="1691.9" dur="5.67">and I&amp;#39;m not saying all people in the CIA</text>
  <text start="1694.45" dur="6.03">are bad apples but they also do say once</text>
  <text start="1697.57" dur="6.09">agency always agency so you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1700.48" dur="6.53">know what motive or who this John guy</text>
  <text start="1703.66" dur="6.27">might be but who knows maybe he could be</text>
  <text start="1707.01" dur="4.45">tasked to claim to be an insider and</text>
  <text start="1709.93" dur="3.99">spread a bunch of disinformation out</text>

  <text start="1851.769" dur="6.36">enough in this video and it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="1854.549" dur="4.661">sort of not important so that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="1858.129" dur="2.461">lot of questions I have I pretty much</text>
  <text start="1859.21" dur="4.559">went through the whole interview by now</text>
  <text start="1860.59" dur="6.779">all the claims I heard that were off to</text>
  <text start="1863.769" dur="6.27">me and I hope that I was able to give</text>
  <text start="1867.369" dur="4.44">you enough of at least what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1870.039" dur="2.581">in my head or information that&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="1871.809" dur="4.62">there in the public domain</text>
  <text start="1872.62" dur="5.64">to help you discern these statements</text>
  <text start="1876.429" dur="3.63">there were some statements he made why</text>
  <text start="1878.26" dur="5.279">was i okay else you know I could believe</text>
  <text start="1880.059" dur="6.24">that but there are red flags and if the</text>
