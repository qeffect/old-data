  <text start="65.75" dur="6.87">our friend lb says hi hi I would like to</text>
  <text start="71" dur="3.03">firstly thank you for the amount of</text>
  <text start="72.62" dur="2.82">information that you put on your channel</text>
  <text start="74.03" dur="3.72">I find every video enjoyable and</text>
  <text start="75.44" dur="4.53">fascinating thank you my friend that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.75" dur="5.04">our reason I do these videos is to</text>
  <text start="79.97" dur="4.68">educate put information out there and</text>
  <text start="82.79" dur="4.05">put a lot of my perspectives out there</text>
  <text start="84.65" dur="5.52">to help people discern what the heck&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.84" dur="5.52">going on so there&amp;#39;s that and he says I</text>
  <text start="90.17" dur="4.62">would like to ask you a question I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="92.36" dur="5.37">wondering about the existence of the</text>
  <text start="94.79" dur="6.12">secret space program do two disclosers</text>
  <text start="97.73" dur="5.81">he said disclosers not disclosures but</text>
  <text start="100.91" dur="5.91">people disclosing information so</text>
  <text start="103.54" dur="6.16">disclosures such as Snowden and Assange</text>
  <text start="106.82" dur="6.3">not having any files or information</text>
  <text start="109.7" dur="5.13">about any program in the making it is</text>
  <text start="113.12" dur="3.99">possible that they would not have any</text>
  <text start="114.83" dur="5.94">evidence for a space program due to its</text>
  <text start="117.11" dur="5.73">secrecy absolutely however shouldn&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="120.77" dur="4.92">have noticed the facilities needed to</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="5.559">build the spacecraft at some point due</text>
  <text start="125.69" dur="5.889">to Google Earth and won&amp;#39;t anyone</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="7.26">notice a spacecraft flying throughout</text>
  <text start="131.579" dur="8.22">our atmosphere very good question my</text>
  <text start="135.659" dur="6.291">friend which I do want to get to because</text>
  <text start="139.799" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s very crucial for a lot of people to</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="5.92">gather their ideas around such a huge</text>
  <text start="145.859" dur="4.231">topic with so many different pieces of</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="5.489">information and of course this topic</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="7.289">being on secret space programs and side</text>
  <text start="153.359" dur="7.38">note about the nomenclature I personally</text>
  <text start="157.379" dur="5.401">prefer to say secret space programs I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="4.89">or alized that word I don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="5.25">necessarily say the secret space program</text>
  <text start="165.629" dur="4.771">because when you say thee it assumes</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="6.359">that there is one program that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="5.729">covertly operating behind NASA or the</text>
  <text start="174.389" dur="4.591">government or the European Space Agency</text>
  <text start="176.129" dur="5.61">or what have you so I prefer to say</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="5.789">secret space programs because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="4.681">many unacknowledged projects operating</text>
  <text start="184.769" dur="3.481">from many different factions whether</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="4.019">their corporate factions or government</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="4.379">factions so there could be many</text>
  <text start="190.439" dur="4.401">different projects whether it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="5.04">spacecraft or an underground base or</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="7">others other technologies or Sciences</text>
  <text start="197.669" dur="6.271">being built out so there is so much</text>
  <text start="201.84" dur="4.38">scattered information about secret space</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="4.439">programs that it becomes very difficult</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="3.689">to discern what&amp;#39;s really going on and of</text>
  <text start="208.379" dur="3.69">course I&amp;#39;m still trying to discern</text>
  <text start="209.909" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s going on and that&amp;#39;s why you know</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="2.79">I&amp;#39;m at this conference that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="4.53">trying to find out what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="214.859" dur="5.22">it and share that information on the</text>
  <text start="217.799" dur="7.11">internet with you guys so when it comes</text>
  <text start="220.079" dur="6.27">to well first I want to discuss the</text>
  <text start="224.909" dur="6.601">first part of that question about</text>
  <text start="226.349" dur="7.53">Snowden and Assange now he was assuming</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="4.879">that because Snowden and Assange haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.879" dur="5.461">leaked anything in regards to the SSP</text>
  <text start="236.389" dur="5.41">secret space programs that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="4.17">have any information this might not be</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="7.171">the case okay</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="7.589">because of the massive nature of the</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="5.82">information regarding secret space</text>
  <text start="251.099" dur="6">programs Assange and Snowden they might</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="4.919">have information right we can&amp;#39;t assume</text>
  <text start="257.099" dur="5.491">that they what we can&amp;#39;t assume what they</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="5.7">do or do not know it could very well be</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="6.949">the case that they have many they have a</text>
  <text start="265.409" dur="7.471">lot of information about the SSP or SSPs</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="5.261">they just haven&amp;#39;t disclosed it quite yet</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="4.5">because of the shell shock that would</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="5.7">occur for the mass public with these</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="7.61">disclosures okay so there needs to be a</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="7.8">very gentle well coordinated rollout of</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="4.96">all via for all the reality that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="3.989">really gone on on this planet for the</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="5.459">last hundred if not thousands of years</text>
  <text start="292.289" dur="5.581">it must be very well coordinated because</text>
  <text start="295.409" dur="4.62">if you bring it all out at once not only</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="5.159">information in regards to secret space</text>
  <text start="300.029" dur="5.07">programs but everything the occult the</text>
  <text start="303.029" dur="4.171">secret societies all the nasty stuff</text>
  <text start="305.099" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re into if you lay it out all on</text>
  <text start="307.2" dur="4.29">the line at once the public is just</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="4.8">gonna be completely overwhelmed and the</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="4.5">energetic release the conscious</text>
  <text start="313.5" dur="5.61">energetic release of the information</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="6">would it would begin to break down the</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="5.669">fabric pretty much of our planet and it</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="4.799">would not be good so we need to cede</text>
  <text start="324.779" dur="4.471">people&amp;#39;s consciousness with these ideas</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="5.88">before laying out the truths on them not</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="4.86">only to ease the shell-shocked but to</text>
  <text start="332.669" dur="3.75">get them to believe it in the first</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="4.739">place right if we had all this</text>
  <text start="336.419" dur="6.331">information come out all at once right</text>
  <text start="338.849" dur="6.271">now many people are so ingrained in</text>
  <text start="342.75" dur="3.659">their sleeping ways that they literally</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="2.669">might not believe it they&amp;#39;ll just call</text>
  <text start="346.409" dur="4.681">it a conspiracies there and brush it off</text>
  <text start="347.789" dur="8.011">to the side so again we must not only</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="7.5">prepare them to be emotionally mature</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="5.07">enough to accept it but just accept it</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="5.249">period so that&amp;#39;s the first thing right</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="5.07">stone of Snowden Assange they might very</text>
  <text start="363.839" dur="3.3">well have info on secret space programs</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="4.02">they just haven&amp;#39;t released it yet</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="5.071">because there&amp;#39;s a there may be a much</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="4.56">larger coordinated effort to do so and</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="3.86">then to the next part of the question in</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="8.06">regards to</text>
  <text start="376.07" dur="10.08">him saying well why haven&amp;#39;t we seen a</text>
  <text start="382.58" dur="7.11">facility why haven&amp;#39;t we seen spacecraft</text>
  <text start="386.15" dur="9.6">with our eyes right and to answer that</text>
  <text start="389.69" dur="8.55">my friend I want to tell you that and in</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="5.49">a phrase that I have heard elsewhere and</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="4.95">that is all the important stuff is not</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="5.7">gonna be on the Earth&amp;#39;s surface because</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="6.03">of the nature of the technologies</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="4.47">associated with secret space programs ie</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="5.22">free energy and whatnot they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="411.41" dur="5.85">hide this at all cost and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="6.78">to do so in either a underground</text>
  <text start="417.26" dur="7.14">facilities or be offworld off-planet</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="6.3">right so with the underground facility</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="6.27">aspect of it much of the build-out of</text>
  <text start="427.52" dur="5.4">the spacecrafts is likely occurring</text>
  <text start="430.67" dur="4.95">underground in the dumps deep</text>
  <text start="432.92" dur="5.67">underground military bases dumps it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="6.12">also been said that many of these dumps</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="5.7">are located in Antarctica and if you</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="6.06">notice on Google Earth there actually</text>
  <text start="444.29" dur="5.4">are many areas blocked out and you can</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="3.57">go to Antarctica check around and you</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.44">won&amp;#39;t be able to zoom in quite as much</text>
  <text start="451.37" dur="4.8">or the literally be just blurs on a lot</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="5.06">of stuff so not only am I an interpreter</text>
  <text start="456.17" dur="6.6">but around the world so on Google Earth</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="5.32">we not might not be able to see it but</text>
  <text start="462.77" dur="4.56">also all this stuff is underground and</text>
  <text start="464.51" dur="5.82">we have many whistleblowers come out</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="4.47">saying that the Germans in fact when</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="3.18">they were beginning much of their secret</text>
  <text start="471.8" dur="5.24">space program research in the 30s and</text>
  <text start="473.51" dur="7.98">40s they went and built out a lot of</text>
  <text start="477.04" dur="7.18">caverns in Antarctica to continue</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="5.49">building out these spacecrafts and these</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="4.32">projects with so it&amp;#39;s underground and</text>
  <text start="486.98" dur="4.5">Antarctica it&amp;#39;s underground elsewhere I</text>
  <text start="488.54" dur="4.65">mean very well lots of dumb lots of deep</text>
  <text start="491.48" dur="4.11">underground military bases in America</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="4.23">here especially around the Southwest</text>
  <text start="495.59" dur="5.37">regions out in the deserts and whatnot</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="4.95">so all of these especially the</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="2.67">spacecraft but all these projects are</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="3.6">gonna be built underground they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="503.63" dur="5.91">be built in places that we can&amp;#39;t easily</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="8.67">see and they could very well be built</text>
  <text start="509.54" dur="8.03">out in out in space whether it&amp;#39;s bases</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="5.01">on the backside the moon bases on other</text>
  <text start="517.57" dur="3.159">planets in our solar system that could</text>
  <text start="519.65" dur="4.62">very well be the case</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="5.731">breakaway civilizations breakaway</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="4.17">civilization conversation ensues here so</text>
  <text start="526.46" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I have to say about</text>
  <text start="528.44" dur="3.21">that we can&amp;#39;t assume just because we</text>
  <text start="530.27" dur="5.76">haven&amp;#39;t seen something that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="6.78">there and also for the very last part of</text>
  <text start="536.03" dur="6.57">that question my man that&amp;#39;s in regards</text>
  <text start="538.43" dur="7.05">to us seeing stuff well people see stuff</text>
  <text start="542.6" dur="4.38">all the time right I mean I report on</text>
  <text start="545.48" dur="4.92">this channel as much as I can</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="6.03">weird anomalous things that people see</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="5.16">that are reported right I just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.01" dur="4.41">update earlier today where that big</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="3.89">craft materialized in front of the</text>
  <text start="557.42" dur="4.26">International Space Station oh</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="4.03">materialisation that&amp;#39;s another point</text>
  <text start="561.68" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ll get to in a minute here but I mean</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="3.12">we had that big craft materialize in</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="3.3">front later now Space Station D</text>
  <text start="566.6" dur="5.46">materialized we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of people</text>
  <text start="568.67" dur="6.12">have sightings and have witnessed things</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="5.43">especially big black triangles I had</text>
  <text start="574.79" dur="4.2">especially since I&amp;#39;ve become more of a</text>
  <text start="577.49" dur="3">public figure I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of people</text>
  <text start="578.99" dur="3.45">come to me with their experiences</text>
  <text start="580.49" dur="2.91">because they feel comfortable sharing up</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="4.71">with someone who would actually believe</text>
  <text start="583.4" dur="6">them and they&amp;#39;ve said yeah I&amp;#39;ve seen all</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="7.58">kinds of black triangles in that black</text>
  <text start="589.4" dur="7.89">triangle is the tr-3b that is a known</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="4.54">airforce project could be other right I</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="4.799">don&amp;#39;t want to label it as being just air</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="5.37">force could be any faction of their</text>
  <text start="602.089" dur="3.781">projects but a lot of people have been</text>
  <text start="604.64" dur="2.52">saying they&amp;#39;ve seen those I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="4.53">people have been saying they&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="607.16" dur="4.95">that cigar-shaped craft or saucers or</text>
  <text start="610.4" dur="3.72">many different things so we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="612.11" dur="4.979">people with various sightings and I</text>
  <text start="614.12" dur="5.28">myself I was just at the East SETI ranch</text>
  <text start="617.089" dur="4.021">which is James Gilliland&amp;#39;s ranch near</text>
  <text start="619.4" dur="4.08">Mount Adams in Washington just a couple</text>
  <text start="621.11" dur="4.77">weeks ago I had my very first</text>
  <text start="623.48" dur="3.96">beyond a shadow of a doubt UFO sighting</text>
  <text start="625.88" dur="3.09">now when it comes to UFO sightings you</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="3.889">have to first actually ask yourself well</text>
  <text start="628.97" dur="6.2">is it extraterrestrial or man-made</text>
  <text start="631.329" dur="5.971">I don&amp;#39;t know what it was but even me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="635.17" dur="5.88">having sightings now many other people</text>
  <text start="637.3" dur="6.209">are having sightings so we&amp;#39;ll put that</text>
  <text start="641.05" dur="3.959">part of the question to rest there and</text>
  <text start="643.509" dur="3.33">saying a lot of people are seeing stuff</text>
  <text start="645.009" dur="4.31">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="646.839" dur="3.961">and more stuff now because</text>
  <text start="649.319" dur="3.45">extraterrestrials are trying to push</text>
  <text start="650.8" dur="4.349">disclosure along even earth-based</text>
  <text start="652.769" dur="3.82">factions of these space programs are</text>
  <text start="655.149" dur="3.031">trying to push disclosure along because</text>
  <text start="656.589" dur="3.66">they want to get these truths out there</text>
  <text start="658.18" dur="4.259">they want to stop lying to humanity so a</text>
  <text start="660.249" dur="4.38">lot of these sightings are only going to</text>
  <text start="662.439" dur="4.26">increase in their frequency and now</text>
  <text start="664.629" dur="5.791">lastly I want to get to that bit on</text>
  <text start="666.699" dur="8.671">materialization this is also a primary</text>
  <text start="670.42" dur="8.01">reason why you might have not have seen</text>
  <text start="675.37" dur="5.129">a specific spacecraft or why many people</text>
  <text start="678.43" dur="5.219">haven&amp;#39;t is because the technologies</text>
  <text start="680.499" dur="6.96">associated with the spacecraft has to do</text>
  <text start="683.649" dur="6.571">with dematerialization of matter and the</text>
  <text start="687.459" dur="4.771">flipping of matter from the space-time</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="3.809">realm or the material realm which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="692.23" dur="3.329">residing in right now with our physical</text>
  <text start="694.029" dur="4.47">meet suits and things we can actually</text>
  <text start="695.559" dur="5.7">touch and feel and see into essentially</text>
  <text start="698.499" dur="5.7">the or at least this is how the science</text>
  <text start="701.259" dur="5.57">that I&amp;#39;ve researched it how it makes</text>
  <text start="704.199" dur="6.06">sense to me how I describe it these</text>
  <text start="706.829" dur="5.74">craft dematerialized from space time</text>
  <text start="710.259" dur="4.56">that we&amp;#39;re residing in into time space</text>
  <text start="712.569" dur="4.14">which is the reciprocal aspect of it</text>
  <text start="714.819" dur="7.26">which is the cosmic sector which is the</text>
  <text start="716.709" dur="8.911">sector associated with time travel being</text>
  <text start="722.079" dur="6.42">able to do materialize and re</text>
  <text start="725.62" dur="4.889">materialize and also portaling</text>
  <text start="728.499" dur="3.541">teleportation things like that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="730.509" dur="3.661">going to get too far into that here you</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="3.989">can check my other videos in regards to</text>
  <text start="734.17" dur="4.529">the reciprocal systems theory and do we</text>
  <text start="736.029" dur="8.04">be Larsen science which has been said is</text>
  <text start="738.699" dur="6.87">the closest theory to how reality is</text>
  <text start="744.069" dur="5.33">really operating here and how these</text>
  <text start="745.569" dur="7.56">secret space program Sciences work so</text>
  <text start="749.399" dur="5.471">there&amp;#39;s that right we just might not see</text>
  <text start="753.129" dur="3.721">the craft because they could just be</text>
  <text start="754.87" dur="3.269">orbs and we don&amp;#39;t realize that that</text>
  <text start="756.85" dur="2.62">could have been a spacecraft it&amp;#39;s D</text>
  <text start="758.139" dur="4.361">materializing</text>
  <text start="759.47" dur="5.88">flipping in time-space and blasting off</text>
  <text start="762.5" dur="4.95">or portaling to elsewhere in the solar</text>
  <text start="765.35" dur="4.56">system of galaxies or on this earth or</text>
  <text start="767.45" dur="5.46">what have you so there&amp;#39;s many reasons</text>
  <text start="769.91" dur="5.16">why you and many other people may have</text>
  <text start="772.91" dur="4.56">not seen the craft seen the things on</text>
  <text start="775.07" dur="3.96">Google Earth or whatnot it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="777.47" dur="3.96">these things are kept very secret and</text>
  <text start="779.03" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s also because we don&amp;#39;t fully</text>
  <text start="781.43" dur="4.5">understand maybe don&amp;#39;t fully understand</text>
  <text start="783.68" dur="6.6">the sciences and the capabilities and</text>
  <text start="785.93" dur="8.7">the reasons why these crafts are moving</text>
  <text start="790.28" dur="5.79">and moving the best way describe it in</text>
  <text start="794.63" dur="3.69">the way they do and how they actually</text>
  <text start="796.07" dur="5.28">operate so that&amp;#39;s the reasons why the</text>
  <text start="798.32" dur="6.02">stuff is not necessarily seen right and</text>
  <text start="801.35" dur="5.73">we can&amp;#39;t also necessarily assume that</text>
  <text start="804.34" dur="4.15">disclosers don&amp;#39;t have the info it the</text>
  <text start="807.08" dur="2.88">info is coming out it just has to be</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="3.54">drip driving by drip so people can</text>
