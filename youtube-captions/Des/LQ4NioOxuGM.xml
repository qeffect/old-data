  <text start="58.829" dur="3.931">media I mean it&amp;#39;s obviously an</text>
  <text start="60.48" dur="6.3">intelligence operation right but here&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="66.78" dur="5.4">is it a white hat operation and you</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="3.78">might think I&amp;#39;m crazy for asking that</text>
  <text start="72.18" dur="6.299">but let me put some things out there to</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="7.56">you guys so first of all the reason why</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="6.32">just in the back of my head I&amp;#39;m like is</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="5.76">this some sort of like white PATCO Intel</text>
  <text start="84.799" dur="6.971">counterintelligence operation number one</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="6.57">it seems to botched to me now I</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="4.38">understand when the deep state pulls a</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="4.409">lot of their false flags they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="96.15" dur="4.62">always what dot their eyes and cross</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="4.081">their T&amp;#39;s and some stuff seeps through</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="3.389">the cracks you know whatever it is</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="2.849">whether they accidentally report on</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="4.201">building seven fall and a half-hour</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="3.691">early or they&amp;#39;re interviewing a guy one</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="3.509">of the mass shootings and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="3.96">accidentally forgets to take off his not</text>
  <text start="111.869" dur="2.011">on a freemason symbol or whatever the</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="2.25">case is</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="5.55">yeah something slipped through the</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="6.3">cracks but this is like too bad because</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="4.2">not only I mean let&amp;#39;s just go through</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="3.84">the laundry lists of all the weird</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="6.15">things that that make this same way to</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="6.869">botched the photographs the photographs</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="4.56">of these devices they&amp;#39;re pathetic</text>
  <text start="132.569" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;re like some</text>
  <text start="134.34" dur="3.99">thing that a freaking kindergartner</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="3.81">could have made in his arts and crafts</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="5.79">class you know and I even saw somebody</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="8.039">post a photograph of this it wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="6.75">a timer on the bombs it was a freaking</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="3.451">like clock that you buy off Amazon for</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="2.94">like five bucks it looked like it was</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="6.049">taped on it like it wasn&amp;#39;t even an</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="7.59">actual device okay and not only that but</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="6.821">there were insignias on some of the</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="4.77">devices and even on the packaging</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="3.72">himself let&amp;#39;s talk about the envelope</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="6.72">the packaging that these devices came in</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="6.239">okay so number one the postage was not</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="5.4">collected it wasn&amp;#39;t postmarked you know</text>
  <text start="175.019" dur="4.951">it had a bunch of stamps on there but</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="3.63">there was no stamp on the stamps to show</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="7.26">that it got mailed so that&amp;#39;s number one</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="8.879">number two is that in some of these on</text>
  <text start="187.23" dur="6.149">some of the envelopes okay a lot of the</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="5.19">names were misspelled they misspelled</text>
  <text start="193.379" dur="6.45">John Brennan&amp;#39;s name Brennan they missed</text>
  <text start="195.989" dur="6.451">an N when they were addressing the</text>
  <text start="199.829" dur="3.841">return postage typing in Debbie</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="3.66">wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="5.189">they misspelled Shultz forgot a C they</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="7.469">also misspelled Florida Florida so they</text>
  <text start="208.859" dur="8.071">changed the a to an S so you know if it</text>
  <text start="213.569" dur="6.39">was the deep state sending bombs to</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="5.1">themselves to feign sympathy and get</text>
  <text start="219.959" dur="3.96">attention and etc etcetera like yeah</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s totally plausible but at the same</text>
  <text start="223.919" dur="4.29">time they wouldn&amp;#39;t do that bad of a job</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="4.59">they wouldn&amp;#39;t misspell their own names</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="4.441">like that and something that was really</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.32">I was trying to reconcile in my head why</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="5.01">would they put a return postage to</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="4.049">Debbie wasserman-schultz on it why would</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="6.27">they put any return postage on it period</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="6.601">like if it was a white hat operation to</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="4.38">send a message to the black hats and</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="3.709">catch them off guard and get all the</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="3.48">attention on them</text>
  <text start="249.799" dur="3.52">it&amp;#39;s almost trolls II like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="3.93">trolling them misspelling their names</text>
  <text start="253.319" dur="3.301">putting the return postage to debbie</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="3.569">Wasserman Schultz</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="4.849">like imagine okay empathy guys empathy</text>
  <text start="259.289" dur="4.711">try to put yourself in the shoes of</text>
  <text start="261.469" dur="4.151">multiple aspects of this situation in</text>
  <text start="264" dur="3.18">when you try to think of the</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="2.34">plausibility of the possibilities right</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="2.82">so</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="4.049">okay put yourself in the shoes of it</text>
  <text start="270" dur="5.639">being a white hat up against the black</text>
  <text start="272.009" dur="6.321">hats total trolls II they make it so</text>
  <text start="275.639" dur="6.84">bashed you see they botch it on purpose</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="6.73">so that way everybody in the public</text>
  <text start="282.479" dur="4.321">that&amp;#39;s looking into this it&amp;#39;s like so</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="5.609">obvious to them it&amp;#39;s even obvious to the</text>
  <text start="286.8" dur="5.1">normies you see I had posited this idea</text>
  <text start="290.669" dur="3.451">I&amp;#39;m like what if there was a white hat</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="4.23">operation a couple of times today in my</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="3.6">Facebook group and people were asking me</text>
  <text start="296.13" dur="1.98">why why would they do that why would</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="4.47">they do that</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="6.179">well obviously a CO Intel operation</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="4.47">against the deep state watch it so bad</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="5.25">make it look botched and then everybody</text>
  <text start="306.66" dur="5.91">is sitting there even the normies even</text>
  <text start="309.539" dur="4.47">the sleepers they&amp;#39;re like oh this is</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="2.79">just too ridiculous like it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="314.009" dur="2.97">make sense that it would be a right</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="3.989">winger or a qa9 guy or something like</text>
  <text start="316.979" dur="3.72">that nobody could do this it has to have</text>
  <text start="319.349" dur="3.061">been the deep State against themselves</text>
  <text start="320.699" dur="3.931">or something like that you see it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="7.86">info war it&amp;#39;s the mind games we have</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="8.58">going on and not only that but false</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="3.899">flag like I saw the word false flag I</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="3.47">mentioned this in my life scene this</text>
  <text start="334.169" dur="5.731">morning I saw the word false flag put in</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="5.85">articles and headlines and prominent</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="6.36">people tweeting about it and oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="7.93">like so many people are waking up to</text>
  <text start="346.26" dur="6.6">that now so again like a a good thinker</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="5.9">will understand that this could very</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="6.299">well have been the deep state sending</text>
  <text start="356.36" dur="5.08">devices to themselves to get some</text>
  <text start="359.159" dur="3.961">attention and Free Press and people</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="4.44">feeling bad for them and pull something</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="5.9">right before the midterms right but an</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="5.61">even deeper thinker might be saying huh</text>

  <text start="607.47" dur="9.09">it points to previous cue posts and then</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="5.14">it kind of confirms events that will</text>
  <text start="616.56" dur="3.06">happen in the future like q always says</text>
  <text start="618.33" dur="3.12">future proves past</text>
  <text start="619.62" dur="5.67">so with this Q o&amp;#39;clock thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.45" dur="5.43">basically a graphic riddle I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="625.29" dur="5.07">the words escaping me to describe it</text>
  <text start="626.88" dur="7.17">with but it&amp;#39;s a puzzle where when it</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="6.06">aligns like it ticks day by day an event</text>
  <text start="634.05" dur="4.02">will happen and you can backtracked with</text>
  <text start="636.42" dur="4.23">this cue clock to a post to happen</text>
  <text start="638.07" dur="4.56">months ago that essentially gives you a</text>

  <text start="688.98" dur="9.15">well you can create some kind of</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="5.799">incident that would require federal</text>

  <text start="792.72" dur="3.84">right Wow</text>
  <text start="794.55" dur="5.279">you see how that OP played out and then</text>
  <text start="796.56" dur="4.62">they recorded the fake FAA audio</text>
  <text start="799.829" dur="3.541">recordings put that out in the public</text>

  <text start="803.37" dur="3.59">cover story mm-hmm see what I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="806.04" dur="3.45">at</text>
  <text start="806.96" dur="3.39">okay now looking at this incident what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="3">the cover story</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="5.02">it&amp;#39;s just explosives in these envelopes</text>
  <text start="812.49" dur="4.26">and heck there is no cover story you see</text>
  <text start="815.37" dur="3.99">because the mainstream media doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="816.75" dur="5.04">know what to report so there&amp;#39;s no cover</text>
  <text start="819.36" dur="4.14">story so it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re scrambling</text>
  <text start="821.79" dur="3.21">they don&amp;#39;t know who did it there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="823.5" dur="2.7">a little Isis sticker on it but how</text>
  <text start="825" dur="3.39">hilarious would it be if one of those</text>
  <text start="826.2" dur="5.4">white hat guys just slapped an Isis</text>
  <text start="828.39" dur="4.77">sticker on there to confuse the deep</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="3.15">Staters even more they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="833.16" dur="3">whether to report it as a terrorist</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="3.36">attack they don&amp;#39;t know whether to report</text>
  <text start="836.16" dur="4.91">it as a right winger or a cue and honor</text>
  <text start="838.11" dur="5.7">or anything else like that right and</text>
  <text start="841.07" dur="4.24">then they misspelled Wasserman Schultz</text>
  <text start="843.81" dur="3.63">name and John Brennan&amp;#39;s name just to</text>
  <text start="845.31" dur="4.02">troll the out of them and then they</text>
  <text start="847.44" dur="4.05">send these packages or get them to the</text>
  <text start="849.33" dur="4.11">respective destination somehow it</text>
  <text start="851.49" dur="4.8">doesn&amp;#39;t even get to many of any of their</text>
  <text start="853.44" dur="4.62">houses it gets intercepted by I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="856.29" dur="4.77">know a mail checker or somebody along</text>
  <text start="858.06" dur="6.12">the way and then heck the white powder</text>
  <text start="861.06" dur="5.219">was probably calcium carbonate or flour</text>
  <text start="864.18" dur="5.13">in the manila envelope just again to</text>
  <text start="866.279" dur="5.341">scare him yeah I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="869.31" dur="4.59">again it&amp;#39;s the what do you guys think</text>
  <text start="871.62" dur="4.95">like I&amp;#39;ll put it out to you guys do you</text>
  <text start="873.9" dur="6.18">think I&amp;#39;m on to something here do you</text>
  <text start="876.57" dur="5.25">think this is a white hat opted to get</text>
  <text start="880.08" dur="3.27">investigators on the scene maybe get</text>
  <text start="881.82" dur="3.78">some evidence about something send a</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="5.52">message to the deep state fight fire</text>
  <text start="885.6" dur="7.47">with fire Tony said you know again I</text>
  <text start="888.87" dur="6.23">totally it sounds plausible to me that</text>
  <text start="893.07" dur="4.86">it would be the deep state sending</text>
  <text start="895.1" dur="4.51">packages to themselves for attention and</text>
  <text start="897.93" dur="3.84">to pull something before the midterms</text>
  <text start="899.61" dur="5.82">but again if it&amp;#39;s a white hat go and</text>
  <text start="901.77" dur="6.9">tell up do it before the midterms so</text>
  <text start="905.43" dur="4.98">people look at it they know again optics</text>
  <text start="908.67" dur="3.59">so people say oh it&amp;#39;s a political stuff</text>
  <text start="910.41" dur="6.27">but the deep state by the Democrats</text>
  <text start="912.26" dur="7.329">there you go you&amp;#39;re getting people to</text>
  <text start="916.68" dur="4.62">wake up that&amp;#39;s what we can call it cue</text>
  <text start="919.589" dur="2.721">the Alliance whoever&amp;#39;s doing this behind</text>
  <text start="921.3" dur="3.39">the scenes that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="922.31" dur="3.7">what I think they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s just it</text>
  <text start="924.69" dur="7.41">that&amp;#39;s what feels right to me you know</text>
  <text start="926.01" dur="7.35">again plausible possible probable go</text>
  <text start="932.1" dur="3.09">through those like when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="933.36" dur="3.6">discerning all this stuff go through</text>
  <text start="935.19" dur="4.5">those stages what is</text>
  <text start="936.96" dur="4.08">plausible here and when you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="939.69" dur="3.81">this you&amp;#39;re sucking in as much</text>
  <text start="941.04" dur="4.26">information as you can your you know</text>
  <text start="943.5" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;ve shoot I was on Twitter all day</text>
  <text start="945.3" dur="4.5">today and Instagram and Facebook and</text>
  <text start="947.7" dur="5.91">you&amp;#39;re not believing anything you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="949.8" dur="5.85">letting your emotions catch you up catch</text>
  <text start="953.61" dur="2.91">you into any information just because it</text>
  <text start="955.65" dur="4.14">feels good</text>
  <text start="956.52" dur="7.35">you&amp;#39;re taking everything rounded</text>
  <text start="959.79" dur="5.22">critical unbiased face value so you have</text>
  <text start="963.87" dur="4.23">all this information you have all these</text>
  <text start="965.01" dur="4.68">puzzle pieces in front of you you put</text>
  <text start="968.1" dur="3.39">the ones together that sound plausible</text>
  <text start="969.69" dur="4.89">and again the more information you have</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="6">the more clearer it&amp;#39;s going to be to go</text>
  <text start="974.58" dur="4.71">through that plausible probable possible</text>
  <text start="977.49" dur="4.62">you know okay so you see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="979.29" dur="4.26">plausible and like okay it totally</text>
  <text start="982.11" dur="2.61">sounds plausible that the deep state</text>
  <text start="983.55" dur="3.12">would be sending packages themselves</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="4.08">well the blob but is it plausible</text>
  <text start="986.67" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;d be so many of them is it</text>
  <text start="988.8" dur="5.13">plausible that they would be so badly</text>
  <text start="990.63" dur="4.71">done is it plausible that you know we</text>
  <text start="993.93" dur="2.4">have all these contradicting reports in</text>
  <text start="995.34" dur="2.49">the mainstream media you think they</text>
  <text start="996.33" dur="2.91">would get their narratives beforehand</text>
  <text start="997.83" dur="4.11">and they would all be at least semi</text>
  <text start="999.24" dur="4.92">congruent but I don&amp;#39;t know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1001.94" dur="5.13">stuff just isn&amp;#39;t fitting into that that</text>
  <text start="1004.16" dur="6">picture okay if it was a white hat Cohen</text>
  <text start="1007.07" dur="8.19">tell op maybe plausible sure oh yeah</text>
  <text start="1010.16" dur="7.35">plausible totally probable well look at</text>
  <text start="1015.26" dur="6.81">where we&amp;#39;re at we&amp;#39;re right before</text>
  <text start="1017.51" dur="7.29">midterms you know we&amp;#39;re at a very hot</text>
  <text start="1022.07" dur="4.35">turning point any shoe stuff like this</text>
  <text start="1024.8" dur="4.08">of course it&amp;#39;s probable look what I was</text>
  <text start="1026.42" dur="5.49">just talking about hold on this is I</text>
  <text start="1028.88" dur="5.73">need to straighten that out lucidi there</text>
  <text start="1031.91" dur="4.46">there you go yeah I told you just what</text>
  <text start="1034.61" dur="5.12">happened in Seattle</text>
  <text start="1036.37" dur="5.83">totally probable it&amp;#39;s been done before</text>
  <text start="1039.73" dur="4.72">possible oh it&amp;#39;s possible hey anything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1042.2" dur="6.3">possible alright so I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1044.45" dur="5.24">just my thought process I wanted to put</text>
  <text start="1048.5" dur="3.99">out there for you guys</text>

  <text start="1115.73" dur="5.939">it&amp;#39;s definitely some sort of</text>

  <text start="1152.389" dur="4.26">look at Hillary Clinton today she looked</text>
  <text start="1154.25" dur="6.48">really confused it did not look like</text>
  <text start="1156.649" dur="5.461">they were excited I figure if this was</text>
  <text start="1160.73" dur="5.189">done by them they would be a little more</text>
