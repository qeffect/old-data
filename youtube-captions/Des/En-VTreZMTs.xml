  <text start="15.63" dur="5.159">some Seth rich some politics and then go</text>
  <text start="18.21" dur="4.47">through some science stuff so first of</text>
  <text start="20.789" dur="4.201">all we&amp;#39;ll start with the Seth rich topic</text>
  <text start="22.68" dur="4.349">now George Webb again if you guys don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="3.449">follow him go check him out he is just</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="3.691">kicking ass with the Seth rich</text>
  <text start="28.439" dur="4.201">investigations he has identified the</text>
  <text start="30.72" dur="5.31">murderer of Seth rich and he claims it</text>
  <text start="32.64" dur="5.43">is a guy by the name of alpha Jala</text>
  <text start="36.03" dur="3.15">something that effect but anyway just go</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="3.54">check him out lots of good stuff coming</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="4.289">out from his channel so he&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="5.4">laying down the truth on that and then</text>
  <text start="43.469" dur="5.971">we have Kim calm actually says he will</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="4.59">testify that the murdered Anstey staffer</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="4.529">Seth rich past documents to Wikileaks if</text>
  <text start="51.6" dur="5.01">the Justice Department cuts him a plea</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="5.941">deal so Kim McCollum is basically saying</text>
  <text start="56.61" dur="5.1">that he will testify if the DOJ will</text>
  <text start="59.91" dur="4.02">grant him please so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="61.71" dur="4.68">another big development again lots of</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="4.74">stuff just coming out every day lots of</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="6.93">stuff coming out every day and then Sean</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="7.5">Hannity actually he said basically he is</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="5.1">making progress on truth behind the Seth</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="5.01">rich murder and he is not backing down</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="5.01">from the subject and because he is not</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="4.799">backing down the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="5.25">essentially won&amp;#39;t back off of him if you</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="4.081">look at the media matters mainstream</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="4.32">news outlet Media Matters is again is</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="6.989">run by David Barak who is a central</text>
  <text start="93" dur="7.02">figure in the pizza gate investigations</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="5.191">Media Matters ran a huge hit piece on</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="6.389">Sean Hannity just a few days ago most</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="5.58">likely because of Hannity&amp;#39;s desire to</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="3.871">get the truth out there about Seth rips</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="3.78">so again I&amp;#39;m gonna keep inform you guys</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="3.269">on all the developments I find in</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="4.53">regards to Seth retain also apparently</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="4.951">um the thumb drive that he had was</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="3.839">leaked I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="5.009">true if you guys want to verify it go</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="4.951">ahead but that also happened I believe</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="3.811">George Webb was the one who</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="5.46">leaked that so lots of stuff come out</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.86">again every day and again I do believe</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="4.2">the Seth rich investigations will be</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="6.24">that first domino that begins to topple</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="6.84">a lot of other pieces so good stuff</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="5.28">there and then along the lines of that</text>
  <text start="141.42" dur="3.78">Seth wrist investigation we are seeing</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="5.25">the mainstream media go full</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="6.36">anti-hillary they are seriously trying</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="5.399">to burn a bunch of bridges right now and</text>
  <text start="151.56" dur="5.13">that is because of this blowing up so</text>
  <text start="154.349" dur="4.47">many people are getting into the Seth</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="3.93">rich story and finding out what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="158.819" dur="3.271">going on with it that a lot of</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="4.679">mainstream media outlets are trying to</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="4.89">basically throw looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.299" dur="5.071">getting to throw Hillary Clinton under</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="5.88">the bus now because we have the Wall</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="5.19">Street Journal they literally ran an</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="4.7">article the two days ago that said</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="4.98">Hillary lacks remorse of conscience</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="5.17">oddly she seems completely sincere as if</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="4.229">she believes the alternative fact she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="3.45">peddling so instead of the alternative</text>
  <text start="184.769" dur="3.181">facts being against Trump now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="4.559">against Hillary Clinton according to The</text>
  <text start="187.95" dur="4.08">Wall Street Journal and then CNN which</text>
  <text start="190.739" dur="4.291">used to be called the Clinton News</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="5.64">Network by some people they ran an</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="4.38">article the same day on June 1st that</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="3.3">said in election blame game it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="4.32">for Hillary Clinton to take her fair</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="6.87">share Wow so we have the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="7.68">Journal CNN and then MSNBC which I wrote</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="5.459">right here on a broadcast of MSNBC&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="4.079">Rachel Maddow Show this week Andrea</text>
  <text start="213.299" dur="5.821">Mitchell NBC&amp;#39;s chief foreign affairs</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="6.391">correspondent stated a fact which has</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="4.89">yet to be reported that the Russia gate</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="4.949">is a conspiracy theory created by</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="4.5">Hillary Clinton and this was on MSNBC so</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="4.111">we have a bunch of corporate media</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="4.62">outlets completely turning on Hillary</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="4.65">throwing her under the bus and this is</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="4.02">because this story is about to freakin</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="2.91">blow up if it&amp;#39;s if you could I mean you</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="4.649">could classify that it&amp;#39;s already blowing</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="4.739">up right now already but lots of stuff</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="3.241">going on right we&amp;#39;re getting very close</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="3.75">very close to larger breakthroughs that</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="3.779">are gonna happen and this is evidence of</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="4.891">it the mainstream media just going full</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="4.771">anti-hillary and then of course you know</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="4.66">yesterday the past couple days we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="6.07">this huge news Trump backing out of the</text>
  <text start="256.54" dur="5.73">Paris Accords which I wrote equals</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="8.25">awesome here because the Paris Accords</text>
  <text start="262.27" dur="8.22">are like globalist you know globalist</text>
  <text start="267.91" dur="5.16">shenanigans 101 right there a lot of</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="3.81">actually read I began reading a little</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="2.67">bit of what was actually in the Paris</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="3.24">Accords and there was a big piece on</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="3.36">geoengineering and chemtrails and just a</text>
  <text start="277.54" dur="3.03">lot of other nonsense and I&amp;#39;ve read a</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="5.13">lot of facts pertaining to the Paris</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="5.91">Accords where it was gonna lose America</text>
  <text start="284.23" dur="3.42">a lot of jobs and not actually do</text>
  <text start="286.48" dur="4.2">anything for cleaning up the environment</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="4.5">it was just gonna shift the shift a lot</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="3.57">of the pollution essentially to like</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="4.29">China and other countries that pollute</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="3.78">enough already so this is a good thing</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="3.77">and you&amp;#39;ll see a lot I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="4.68">already seeing a ton of mainstream media</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="5.11">chalk up whatever stories they can about</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="4.29">this and National Geographic for</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="3.57">instance I just perused that website</text>
  <text start="307" dur="3.63">this morning and pretty much every</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="4.17">single article they were running was on</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="5.94">climate change so because of this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="5.4">seeing the mainstream media and the</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="6.27">mainstream science outlets just try to</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="6.81">go complete anti-trump on it so be very</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="4.82">discerning with what you hear about the</text>
  <text start="325.27" dur="6">Paris Accords and climate change and</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="5.32">next we&amp;#39;re getting to Putin so hopping</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="2.07">from Hillary to Trump to Putin how fun</text>
  <text start="332.98" dur="4.59">is that</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="7.56">but Putin essentially had a interview</text>
  <text start="337.57" dur="5.16">with megyn kelly of MSNBC the past</text>
  <text start="340.9" dur="4.05">couple days and he just let it all out</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="4.83">there and he said that the u.s. hackers</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="5.31">could easily frame Russia and we know</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="5.01">this because of WikiLeaks drop dropping</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="5.31">their vault seven data saying that the</text>
  <text start="352.57" dur="4.62">CIA very well has programs in which they</text>
  <text start="355.57" dur="4.56">can frame foreign governments for</text>
  <text start="357.19" dur="4.65">hacking the u.s. so boom Putin laying it</text>
  <text start="360.13" dur="3.45">on the line and I believe he actually</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="4.86">made some offhand comments about Trump</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="5.55">in his Paris Accords dealio where Putin</text>
  <text start="366.7" dur="4.59">was like you know good good thing so</text>
  <text start="369.13" dur="5.04">Putin&amp;#39;s still going full</text>
  <text start="371.29" dur="5.73">anti-establishment calling out the US</text>
  <text start="374.17" dur="5.01">and then making the establishment</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="5.88">politicians in the u.s. essentially crap</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="5.4">their pants John McCain is you know just</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="2.28">came out with a couple articles where he</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="3.93">was saying</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="4.23">Putin is more dangerous than Isis so</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="2.93">he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.41" dur="5.85">very scared he doesn&amp;#39;t like that guy</text>
  <text start="391.44" dur="5.92">McCain doesn&amp;#39;t like that guy and of</text>
  <text start="395.26" dur="5.22">course you know he&amp;#39;s trying to defend</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="6.84">his own proxy army and try to shift the</text>
  <text start="400.48" dur="7.05">blame to Russia yet again so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="404.2" dur="5.19">huge like civil war going on from all</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="4.47">kinds of different factions in the media</text>
  <text start="409.39" dur="4.41">and politics and whatnot so I hope these</text>
  <text start="412" dur="3.06">news reports I&amp;#39;m doing or helping you</text>
  <text start="413.8" dur="3">guys try to sift through everything</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="3.78">because it&amp;#39;s crazy it&amp;#39;s crazy out there</text>
  <text start="416.8" dur="3.93">these days so that&amp;#39;s everything in</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="3.36">regards to Seth rich and kind of some</text>
  <text start="420.73" dur="3.86">politics that I&amp;#39;ve been seeing the past</text>
  <text start="422.2" dur="5.4">few days but now I want to get into</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="6.4">science some good old-fashioned exchange</text>
  <text start="427.6" dur="5.19">and I&amp;#39;m just gonna run through give a</text>
  <text start="430.99" dur="4.02">little bit of commentary on a few</text>
  <text start="432.79" dur="5.58">articles that I&amp;#39;ve seen today just on</text>
  <text start="435.01" dur="6.87">various outlets and again you know this</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="6.06">is my science opinions just stem from my</text>
  <text start="441.88" dur="6.03">experience in my knowledge I am in no</text>
  <text start="444.43" dur="6.06">way some you know PhD physicist or</text>
  <text start="447.91" dur="5.37">anything like that but then again I mean</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="4.26">I didn&amp;#39;t go to college and I actually</text>
  <text start="453.28" dur="3.39">dropped out of college so on one hand</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="4.56">that is like a good thing because I</text>
  <text start="456.67" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t have a lot of brainwashing to undo</text>
  <text start="459.31" dur="5.01">so I&amp;#39;ll just give you guys my opinions</text>
  <text start="461.14" dur="5.37">of what&amp;#39;s going on we saw Fox News they</text>
  <text start="464.32" dur="4.1">actually had an article run yesterday</text>
  <text start="466.51" dur="4.95">where they said if you&amp;#39;re hoping humans</text>
  <text start="468.42" dur="5.86">find evidence of life on Mars scientists</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="5.55">have some very good news Wow so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.28" dur="3.81">an interesting soft disclosure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="3.12">trying to seat into our consciousness</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="4.2">and then again this kind of runs along</text>
  <text start="480.13" dur="4.32">the line where Fox News has been</text>
  <text start="482.29" dur="3.93">surprising the crap out of me lately and</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;ve been putting a lot of truth out</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="3.78">there I mean they tried to report on</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="3.96">Seth Ridge they let sean hannity do his</text>
  <text start="490" dur="3.99">thing talking about it they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="4.92">putting a lot of articles out in regards</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="4.83">to space and alien life and things like</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="3.9">that just trying to seek people so I</text>
  <text start="498.82" dur="4.47">think Fox News is trying to do some good</text>
  <text start="500.92" dur="5.52">and it&amp;#39;s very interesting so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.29" dur="5.73">that NASA there&amp;#39;s been a lot of articles</text>
  <text start="506.44" dur="6.39">running around the internet where NASA</text>
  <text start="509.02" dur="5.49">is trying to make some new program to</text>
  <text start="512.83" dur="4.08">touch the Sun or something of that</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="4.32">effect but again look at NASA</text>
  <text start="516.91" dur="5.13">NASA is never a straight answer their</text>
  <text start="518.83" dur="5.13">complete front organization for deeper</text>
  <text start="522.04" dur="5.81">programs that our military and our</text>
  <text start="523.96" dur="7.2">government has you know does has and</text>
  <text start="527.85" dur="5.14">trying to touch the Sun which is really</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="4.98">interesting and I just want to offer an</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="6.39">opinion there the Sun I do not believe</text>
  <text start="536.14" dur="5.76">is some giant hydrogen fusion ball in</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="5.13">the sky if you look into the electric</text>
  <text start="541.9" dur="5.16">universe theories the that gives a whole</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="6.69">new idea that what the Sun actually is</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="6.15">and if you listen to various testimonies</text>
  <text start="551.2" dur="4.47">and whatnot various science out there</text>
  <text start="553.21" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;ve actually said the Sun is more so</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="5.4">like a giant electric portal per se and</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="5.4">I know it sounds crazy but it makes a</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="4.59">whole lot more sense so when you who</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="3.75">makes a whole lot more sense when you</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="3.48">research it for a quite a while remember</text>
  <text start="568.18" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff we have to</text>
  <text start="569.14" dur="5.22">unlearn then relearn but NASA trying to</text>
  <text start="572.38" dur="4.14">touch the Sun what is the Sun well</text>
  <text start="574.36" dur="5.46">essentially it can be classified like a</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="5.34">giant Stargate so this is just complete</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="3.87">like everybody in the realm of</text>
  <text start="581.86" dur="3.42">mainstream science they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.69" dur="4.17">know what they&amp;#39;re doing and it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="585.28" dur="4.38">bad foundations built upon bad</text>
  <text start="587.86" dur="3.45">foundations and bad theories over here</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="4.53">and people who are all confused and</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="4.17">what&amp;#39;s going on so that just made me</text>
  <text start="594.19" dur="5.07">laugh they&amp;#39;re gonna try and touch the</text>
  <text start="595.48" dur="5.55">Sun wonderful I wonder what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="599.26" dur="3.09">in the deeper black projects you know</text>
  <text start="601.03" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;ve probably actually gone through</text>
  <text start="602.35" dur="6.15">the Sun already I wouldn&amp;#39;t doubt that</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="5.73">now this one here I had somebody sent to</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="4.59">me and they were kind of wondering about</text>
  <text start="609.7" dur="5.52">it the LIGO actually detected they said</text>
  <text start="613.09" dur="4.68">they detected the oldest gravitational</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="3.96">waves ever or something to that effect I</text>
  <text start="617.77" dur="4.08">was like oh we detected gravity waves</text>
  <text start="619.18" dur="5.07">for the third time what do you do this</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="4.08">again right there&amp;#39;s so many scientific</text>
  <text start="624.25" dur="3.93">theories that we&amp;#39;re gonna have to undo</text>
  <text start="625.93" dur="5.04">and one of them I mentioned was the</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="4.83">electric universe theory which is not</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="3.27">one of the ones we have to undo per se</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="3.66">but it&amp;#39;s one of the ones that are</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="5.88">actually much better than conventional</text>
  <text start="636.67" dur="4.8">theories so look into that but also of</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="3.24">the electric universe theory is</text>
  <text start="641.47" dur="4.26">essentially a subset theory of what I</text>
  <text start="643.36" dur="4.95">call the reciprocal Systems Theory which</text>
  <text start="645.73" dur="3.13">was invented by Dewey B Larson in the</text>
  <text start="648.31" dur="2.85">mid nineteen</text>
  <text start="648.86" dur="6.99">as I&amp;#39;ve done videos on this before but</text>
  <text start="651.16" dur="6.19">he essentially says in his reciprocal</text>
  <text start="655.85" dur="4.91">Systems Theory which is essentially a</text>
  <text start="657.35" dur="7.23">type of unified field theory</text>
  <text start="660.76" dur="6.28">electromagnetism and gravity are simply</text>
  <text start="664.58" dur="4.59">yin and yang they&amp;#39;re reciprocals of each</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="4.44">other so we have electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="5.7">radiation radiation as energy output and</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="4.11">then gravity is essentially the inward</text>
  <text start="674.87" dur="3.27">force</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s the inward pushing force that</text>
  <text start="678.14" dur="6.93">creates matter with so again right false</text>
  <text start="683.15" dur="3.54">theories based upon false foundations</text>
  <text start="685.07" dur="2.94">based upon false this false that and a</text>
  <text start="686.69" dur="4.41">lot of people really have no idea what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.01" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s going on so when it says LIGO</text>
  <text start="691.1" dur="4.44">detects the oldest gravitational waves</text>
  <text start="693.26" dur="4.92">again my question there is well what the</text>
  <text start="695.54" dur="4.65">heck you know this this is what they</text>
  <text start="698.18" dur="3.87">claim to understand at the mainstream</text>
  <text start="700.19" dur="4.89">level well what&amp;#39;s really going on at the</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="4.86">deeper level for instance like in black</text>
  <text start="705.08" dur="3.84">projects and covert programs things like</text>
  <text start="706.91" dur="4.29">things like that what kind of science</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="4.56">have they really found that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="711.2" dur="4.14">interested in so that&amp;#39;s why I look into</text>
  <text start="713.48" dur="4.59">like I said the electric universe theory</text>
  <text start="715.34" dur="4.56">and large Sounion physics right doing</text>
  <text start="718.07" dur="2.99">the larson&amp;#39;s physics series and a lot of</text>
  <text start="719.9" dur="5.01">other stuff because it helps explain</text>
  <text start="721.06" dur="5.14">much more of what gravity actually is it</text>
  <text start="724.91" dur="2.64">makes a whole lot more freaking sense</text>
  <text start="726.2" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;ll do more videos and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="727.55" dur="4.35">too and then last one here that I want</text>
  <text start="730.07" dur="3.45">to finish with is talking about</text>
  <text start="731.9" dur="3.54">artificial intelligence because it</text>
  <text start="733.52" dur="4.74">really grinds my gears when I see a</text>
  <text start="735.44" dur="5.22">bunch of what I call a IBS everywhere</text>
  <text start="738.26" dur="5.34">and I was just perusing like the</text>
  <text start="740.66" dur="5.34">futurism website and some other kind of</text>
  <text start="743.6" dur="5.55">mainstream science outlets and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746" dur="5.78">really pushing artificial intelligence</text>
  <text start="749.15" dur="6.36">tough which i think is nonsense because</text>
  <text start="751.78" dur="5.98">it&amp;#39;s scary for one I mean the AI the AI</text>
  <text start="755.51" dur="5.07">concept I don&amp;#39;t believe we need</text>
  <text start="757.76" dur="5.25">artificial intelligence at all and I</text>
  <text start="760.58" dur="5.67">think well let me take that back</text>
  <text start="763.01" dur="5.61">I think computer systems and AI is</text>
  <text start="766.25" dur="4.35">helpful but once you bridge the gap</text>
  <text start="768.62" dur="4.38">between letting it into your body and</text>
  <text start="770.6" dur="6.36">letting it take over your biology that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="773" dur="4.92">very bad and that&amp;#39;s essentially a huge</text>
  <text start="776.96" dur="3.78">agenda</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;m seeing is this giant agenda to merge</text>
  <text start="780.74" dur="3.96">man and machine and it&amp;#39;s as if human</text>
  <text start="782.93" dur="3.27">evolution cannot take a new step forward</text>
  <text start="784.7" dur="4.35">unless we merge with machines and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="786.2" dur="5.28">complete BS and one article I want to</text>
  <text start="789.05" dur="5.82">point you to that helps me outline that</text>
  <text start="791.48" dur="4.919">is that on the futurism future and</text>
  <text start="794.87" dur="3.6">simcom they ran an article that said</text>
  <text start="796.399" dur="5.55">revolutionary discovery about the human</text>
  <text start="798.47" dur="5.369">brain could lead to second gen AI well</text>
  <text start="801.949" dur="5.45">shoot what are they doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="803.839" dur="6.211">studying humans to make robots better</text>
  <text start="807.399" dur="4.421">this is a big thing that I try to tell</text>
  <text start="810.05" dur="2.55">people when they&amp;#39;re studying AI think</text>
  <text start="811.82" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s wonderful</text>
  <text start="812.6" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;m like well what about the technology</text>
  <text start="815.93" dur="4.98">that we already possess in our bodies</text>
  <text start="817.76" dur="5.009">you could call our DNA our pineal gland</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="4.77">human consciousness you could call all</text>
  <text start="822.769" dur="5.13">of that a kind of natural technology but</text>
  <text start="825.68" dur="3.87">of course right in the educational</text>
  <text start="827.899" dur="4.081">system as the powers that be don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="829.55" dur="5.909">to tell us about our own inherent powers</text>
  <text start="831.98" dur="6.51">about how non-local consciousness</text>
  <text start="835.459" dur="6.331">operates about the abilities of remote</text>
  <text start="838.49" dur="5.49">viewing and psychic abilities and how</text>
  <text start="841.79" dur="3.78">our DNA functions and our pineal glands</text>
  <text start="843.98" dur="3.27">function they won&amp;#39;t tell us any of that</text>
  <text start="845.57" dur="4.62">but heck they&amp;#39;ll tell you that we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="847.25" dur="3.57">study it to make AI better doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="850.19" dur="3.3">any sense to me</text>
  <text start="850.82" dur="6.36">so I well you know again more videos I</text>
  <text start="853.49" dur="4.86">can do discussing what the pineal gland</text>
  <text start="857.18" dur="2.909">really is I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to do a</text>
  <text start="858.35" dur="3.39">video on remote viewing and discussing</text>
  <text start="860.089" dur="4.921">just the powers of our consciousness and</text>
  <text start="861.74" dur="5.88">how amazing it is so don&amp;#39;t get caught up</text>
  <text start="865.01" dur="6.06">with all the AI shenanigans so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="867.62" dur="5.55">few of my ideas about science kind of</text>
  <text start="871.07" dur="4.56">some of the interesting things behind</text>
  <text start="873.17" dur="4.62">geopolitics that I&amp;#39;ve seen it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="875.63" dur="4.829">interesting how and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="877.79" dur="4.02">is going really anti-hillary and I think</text>
  <text start="880.459" dur="1.771">we should keep an eye on that and then</text>
  <text start="881.81" dur="2.25">again</text>
  <text start="882.23" dur="3.839">Seth rich I&amp;#39;m gonna keep talking about</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="3.509">it I may keep reporting on it I think</text>
  <text start="886.069" dur="5.071">we&amp;#39;ll see a lot of big breakthrough</text>
  <text start="887.569" dur="7.171">start to happen with that topic that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="891.14" dur="5.58">gonna then expose a lot of the other</text>
  <text start="894.74" dur="4.38">topics that people really haven&amp;#39;t taken</text>
  <text start="896.72" dur="5.669">seriously but once they see that things</text>
  <text start="899.12" dur="4.74">like this like you know the cover-up of</text>
  <text start="902.389" dur="4.051">murder by some of the highest</text>
  <text start="903.86" dur="4.62">politicians in the land can very well</text>
  <text start="906.44" dur="4.51">happen then their minds will be so much</text>
  <text start="908.48" dur="4.39">more open to one to understanding</text>
  <text start="910.95" dur="3.51">things like pedo gate and trafficking</text>
  <text start="912.87" dur="3.3">and all the other deep dark things that</text>
  <text start="914.46" dur="4.11">people in politics are really into as</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="4.05">being possible right they&amp;#39;ll say oh if</text>
  <text start="918.57" dur="3.12">this is possible how maybe all that</text>
  <text start="920.22" dur="2.25">stuff these crazy conspiracy theorists</text>
  <text start="921.69" dur="4.11">have been talking about are actually</text>
  <text start="922.47" dur="6.18">real so that&amp;#39;s why I think this is</text>
  <text start="925.8" dur="4.35">actually a much it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s needed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.65" dur="3.12">almost a much more needed domino to</text>
  <text start="930.15" dur="4.91">begin to fall right because I mean if</text>
  <text start="931.77" dur="5.76">the for instance the pizza gate</text>
  <text start="935.06" dur="5.11">revelations blew up a few months ago</text>
  <text start="937.53" dur="4.23">that would be quite the shock to a lot</text>
  <text start="940.17" dur="3.42">of people&amp;#39;s consciousness so it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="941.76" dur="4.5">better that this one&amp;#39;s the first one</text>
  <text start="943.59" dur="4.5">because then it can ease the idea into</text>
  <text start="946.26" dur="3.78">people&amp;#39;s minds and then let all of the</text>
  <text start="948.09" dur="5.31">other things begin to take hold as well</text>
  <text start="950.04" dur="5.22">so anyway June 3rd there&amp;#39;s my news round</text>
  <text start="953.4" dur="5.54">for the game for the day take care guys</text>
  <text start="955.26" dur="3.68">hope you have a wonderful weekend</text>
