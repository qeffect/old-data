  <text start="633.939" dur="3.811">basement</text>
  <text start="634.41" dur="6.07">basically it connects the owners of</text>
  <text start="637.75" dur="4.29">comic ping-pong into various rings but</text>
  <text start="640.48" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re not saying that it was ran out of</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="3.51">the basement and I like the parentheses</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="3.06">here which didn&amp;#39;t actually have a</text>
  <text start="645.55" dur="4.529">basement you can go back to James Aleph</text>
  <text start="647.47" dur="5.609">and his quotes from the middle of 2015</text>
  <text start="650.079" dur="4.86">actually April 2015 there&amp;#39;s quotes of</text>
  <text start="653.079" dur="5.041">his where he&amp;#39;s giving interviews to</text>
  <text start="654.939" dur="4.59">magazines about comet ping-pong and the</text>
  <text start="658.12" dur="3.06">food that&amp;#39;s made there and he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="659.529" dur="3.99">about it having a basement and then</text>
  <text start="661.18" dur="4.589">after the John Podesta emails came out</text>
  <text start="663.519" dur="3.51">the WikiLeaks emails then James a low</text>
  <text start="665.769" dur="2.381">fantasy goes on a record and does</text>
  <text start="667.029" dur="2.471">interviews where he&amp;#39;s saying no</text>
  <text start="668.15" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s no basement total contradiction</text>
  <text start="669.5" dur="7.17">so fake news there and then it quotes</text>
  <text start="673.79" dur="4.77">from this actual document the FBI</text>
  <text start="676.67" dur="4.65">assesses these conspiracy theories very</text>
  <text start="678.56" dur="4.65">likely will emerge spread and evolve in</text>
  <text start="681.32" dur="4.23">the modern information marketplace</text>
  <text start="683.21" dur="3.72">occasionally driving both groups and</text>
  <text start="685.55" dur="3.57">individual extremists to carry out</text>
  <text start="686.93" dur="4.86">criminal or violent acts the document</text>
  <text start="689.12" dur="4.56">states it also goes on to say the FBI</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="3.63">believes conspiracy through Theory</text>
  <text start="693.68" dur="3.75">driven extremists are likely to increase</text>
  <text start="695.42" dur="5.51">during the 2020 presidential election</text>
  <text start="697.43" dur="6.54">cycle let me say here okay</text>
  <text start="700.93" dur="6.04">Q&amp;#39;s been around for nearly two years now</text>
  <text start="703.97" dur="5.01">and since Q&amp;#39;s been around I&amp;#39;ve done I</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t know how many different talks and</text>
  <text start="708.98" dur="4.02">events and gone to conferences but</text>
  <text start="711.08" dur="6.15">basically what I&amp;#39;m saying here is that</text>
  <text start="713" dur="6.36">I&amp;#39;ve met thousands I&amp;#39;ve met thousands of</text>
  <text start="717.23" dur="4.86">people over the last two years who are</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="5.01">all cute on followers they&amp;#39;ve been at</text>
  <text start="722.09" dur="5.97">the events and said hi to me and been at</text>
  <text start="724.37" dur="6.24">my talks I have not met one person that</text>
  <text start="728.06" dur="3.93">I would classify as being violent that I</text>
  <text start="730.61" dur="3.21">would classify as being a domestic</text>
  <text start="731.99" dur="4.38">terrorist that I would classify as being</text>
  <text start="733.82" dur="5.76">any sort of extremist have not met one</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="7.83">okay so let&amp;#39;s go off personal experience</text>
  <text start="739.58" dur="9.42">here rather than approved narratives</text>
  <text start="744.2" dur="6.9">okay and not just that but the closest</text>
  <text start="749" dur="5.01">thing that I personally had ever gotten</text>
  <text start="751.1" dur="4.5">to violence was from a heckler I had</text>
  <text start="754.01" dur="5.28">after one of my talks who wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="755.6" dur="5.91">actually an anti Q disbeliever non</text>
  <text start="759.29" dur="3.66">follower he was very anti Q that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="761.51" dur="3.09">closest I came to violence he came up</text>
  <text start="762.95" dur="7.89">started heckling me and yelling at</text>
  <text start="764.6" dur="9.24">myself in the crowd so fake news 101 and</text>
  <text start="770.84" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s basically all to go over in terms</text>
  <text start="773.84" dur="4.68">of this story they&amp;#39;re just talking about</text>
  <text start="776.12" dur="4.68">what the Intel bulletin is saying</text>
  <text start="778.52" dur="6.86">etcetera etcetera so now let&amp;#39;s check it</text>
  <text start="780.8" dur="9.15">out let&amp;#39;s go to this scribed dot-com</text>

  <text start="811.55" dur="6.47">claiming their they got the information</text>
  <text start="813.89" dur="7.68">that they supposedly got right so</text>
  <text start="818.02" dur="6.34">uploaded by Kelly Grant Kelly our grant</text>
  <text start="821.57" dur="5.4">is apparently a photographer for Yahoo</text>

  <text start="826.97" dur="4.62">uploaded this document again</text>
  <text start="829.37" dur="3.84">Yahoo News in their article didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="831.59" dur="3.3">how they obtained it who they got it</text>
  <text start="833.21" dur="3.72">from so that&amp;#39;s still a question mark but</text>
  <text start="834.89" dur="4.17">nevertheless it was uploaded by a</text>
  <text start="836.93" dur="4.83">photographer for Yahoo News Kelly grant</text>

  <text start="854.2" dur="4.54">identity-based and fringe political</text>
  <text start="856.37" dur="4.17">conspiracy theories very likely motivate</text>
  <text start="858.74" dur="4.4">some domestic extremists to commit</text>
  <text start="860.54" dur="5.31">criminals sometimes violent activity huh</text>
  <text start="863.14" dur="4.75">very convenient title for their approved</text>

  <text start="1135.67" dur="6.3">investigators Wikipedia is credible</text>
  <text start="1138.79" dur="6.139">enough for them to create unclassified</text>

  <text start="1177.55" dur="4.92">and put out of the Phoenix field office</text>
  <text start="1179.26" dur="7.26">very poorly done and of course it was</text>
  <text start="1182.47" dur="7.65">reposted publicized by Yahoo News here</text>
  <text start="1186.52" dur="5.46">which is a pillar of fake news there for</text>
  <text start="1190.12" dur="4.59">the legacy media for the deep state so</text>
  <text start="1191.98" dur="3.77">all right let&amp;#39;s finish up here last few</text>
  <text start="1194.71" dur="5.19">things</text>
  <text start="1195.75" dur="6.16">let&amp;#39;s theorize let&amp;#39;s speculate as to who</text>
  <text start="1199.9" dur="3.98">may have created this document and what</text>

  <text start="1203.88" dur="6.4">again if it&amp;#39;s not faked if it is real I</text>
  <text start="1208.02" dur="6.19">get the feeling that it could have been</text>
  <text start="1210.28" dur="6.54">made by some Knox non-official cover</text>
  <text start="1214.21" dur="4.44">agents basically some plants that</text>
  <text start="1216.82" dur="3.81">infiltrated maybe a local FBI field</text>
  <text start="1218.65" dur="6.18">office it office and wrote this to get</text>
  <text start="1220.63" dur="6.21">it out okay so maybe shoot maybe some</text>
