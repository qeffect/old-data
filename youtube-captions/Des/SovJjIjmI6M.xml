  <text start="275.34" dur="3.87">new friends</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="6.03">and that was me into junior high in high</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="4.29">school I really wish I would have</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="2.76">started playing soccer when I was</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="3.3">younger if I would have started younger</text>
  <text start="284.67" dur="4.92">I would&amp;#39;ve been really really good but</text>
  <text start="286.8" dur="4.29">uh might not have been right here now so</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="3.27">actually don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t wish that</text>
  <text start="291.09" dur="6.15">happened but anyway getting into high</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="6.12">school I you know I started high school</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="3.27">with really good grades really really</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="2.97">good grades I think I had like a three</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="5.61">nine or something like that maybe even a</text>
  <text start="301.95" dur="10.22">four oh but the freshman year sophomore</text>
  <text start="306.12" dur="8.31">year junior year senior year just my my</text>
  <text start="312.17" dur="4.99">interest level my interest level in the</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="4.14">studies really waned I was the kind of</text>
  <text start="317.16" dur="3.18">kid I&amp;#39;d always been the kind of kid</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="3.96">throughout elementary middle high school</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="3.93">where I would finish my work really</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="3.36">really quick and then I would just get</text>
  <text start="324.27" dur="3.06">bored and I would start looking for</text>
  <text start="325.89" dur="2.7">stuff to do and I&amp;#39;d usually distract</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="2.58">some other kids in the class would be</text>
  <text start="328.59" dur="3.24">the class clown or something like that</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="3.93">so that was pretty much me in high</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="7.65">school luckily I graduated high school</text>
  <text start="333.84" dur="9.12">with a decent GPA 2.8 2.9 I think not</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="6.36">that decent but I basically rode my AC T</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="4.86">and SAT scores into college I did really</text>
  <text start="345.84" dur="3.9">good on the AC T I think I got like 98</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="4.29">99 percentile and that did pretty good</text>
  <text start="349.74" dur="4.98">on my SATs so I was able to get into a</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="4.89">State College now what was funny is that</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="5.27">in high school I had actually really</text>
  <text start="357" dur="4.92">wanted to go to the Air Force Academy</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.48">that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to do I wanted to</text>
  <text start="361.92" dur="6.36">either be a aerospace engineer or fly</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="5.4">planes interesting huh like 10 15 years</text>
  <text start="368.28" dur="2.94">ago that&amp;#39;s why I wanted to do super</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="2.97">interested in space want to go to the</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="5.64">Air Force but I couldn&amp;#39;t fly planes</text>
  <text start="372.84" dur="9.48">because my eyesight sucks I am blind as</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="9.69">a bat and at that time I think 2007</text>
  <text start="382.32" dur="6.42">eight nine they didn&amp;#39;t let pilots they</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="4.38">didn&amp;#39;t let anybody who had LASIK become</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="4.08">a pilot at that point even if you got</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="4.29">correction to your vision you could see</text>
  <text start="392.82" dur="3.75">20/20 without contacts or glasses</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="2.31">because you had LASIK they still</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="3.33">wouldn&amp;#39;t let you in the Air Force at</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="3.93">that time so I couldn&amp;#39;t go to the Air</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="3.48">Force Academy because that read</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="4.59">because my grades slipped a little bit</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="7.35">so I ended up going to a state college</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="8.55">and went to that state college and</text>
  <text start="410.73" dur="5.09">that&amp;#39;s where I had a little bit too much</text>
  <text start="414.6" dur="4.02">fun</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="5.05">and like I mentioned earlier you know my</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="4.86">grades I just started it&amp;#39;s not that I</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="4.35">sucked at school it&amp;#39;s just I didn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="423.48" dur="6.09">I didn&amp;#39;t feel fulfilled with what I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="425.22" dur="6.57">with with what I was studying so when I</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="6.93">got into college same thing you know</text>
  <text start="431.79" dur="6.54">same thing my interest in studies and my</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="3">effort level just wasn&amp;#39;t there you know</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="3.6">partied too much</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="5.34">made a lot more friends chase girls I</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="6.15">didn&amp;#39;t care about studies so naturally I</text>
  <text start="444.84" dur="6.95">did not do very good in the first year</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="8.82">of college and ended up failing out of</text>
  <text start="451.79" dur="8.19">State University now when I failed out</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="5.01">of State University I went back home</text>
  <text start="459.98" dur="5.95">moved back in with my parents</text>
  <text start="461.91" dur="5.58">and I went to Community College just to</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="2.85">do you know general education classes</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="4.53">yada yada</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="5.97">so there I was at Community College it</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="4.8">was of course easier than a university</text>
  <text start="474.75" dur="4.44">so my grades weren&amp;#39;t slipping at that</text>
  <text start="476.82" dur="3.99">point but it was still just general</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="4.85">classes you know I had no idea what I</text>
  <text start="480.81" dur="5.55">wanted to do I went to university for</text>
  <text start="484.04" dur="5.65">architecture actually architecture and</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="5.28">construction management you know none of</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="3.33">you probably would have guessed that so</text>
  <text start="491.64" dur="3.35">I went to university for that but when I</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="5.22">came back went to Community College is</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="5.62">just I didn&amp;#39;t know so I was taking I</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="6.06">think business management courses or</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="6.99">something to that effect and kept my</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="5.19">grades up ended up playing soccer for</text>
  <text start="507.6" dur="6">that Community College the university I</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="6.3">went to didn&amp;#39;t have a men&amp;#39;s soccer team</text>
  <text start="513.6" dur="3.63">just intramural leagues but when I came</text>
  <text start="515.79" dur="5.34">back and went to Community College they</text>
  <text start="517.23" dur="5.97">actually had a men&amp;#39;s league so I tried</text>
  <text start="521.13" dur="4.83">out and played for them and that was</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="5.49">really fun it&amp;#39;s really fun being able to</text>
  <text start="525.96" dur="4.14">play collegiately soccer because we had</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="3.75">a bunch of semi-professional players</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="5.46">play on our team and practice with us</text>
  <text start="532.44" dur="6.33">and our head coach was a semi-pro coach</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="4.77">our assistant head coach was a semi-pro</text>
  <text start="538.77" dur="4.11">captain captain of a semi-professional</text>
  <text start="540.33" dur="4.23">team so I was playing with like half the</text>
  <text start="542.88" dur="3.57">team was foreign guys we don&amp;#39;t with you</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="3.39">guys from France and England and</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="4.86">Scotland and then half the team was</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="5.61">Americans so I got really good practice</text>
  <text start="551.31" dur="4.62">and I ended up practicing a little bit</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="4.41">with that semi-pro team so that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="555.93" dur="4.65">much where my head was again playing</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="6.09">more sports I&amp;#39;m making more friends than</text>
  <text start="560.58" dur="8.55">studies so I just didn&amp;#39;t care I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="564.06" dur="8.19">care about classes and that was that but</text>
  <text start="569.13" dur="8.49">when I was about 20 years old when I was</text>
  <text start="572.25" dur="7.41">about 20 years old I was looking for new</text>

  <text start="592.95" dur="6.69">doing and because I had that experience</text>
  <text start="596.58" dur="4.73">making smoothies and a little bit of</text>
  <text start="599.64" dur="3.66">supplement experience I</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="3.37">synchronistically you know I won&amp;#39;t go</text>

  <text start="794.489" dur="7.171">2011 and 12 and then I had a whole just</text>
  <text start="797.829" dur="4.891">redoing of my understanding of our</text>
  <text start="801.66" dur="4.81">reality</text>
  <text start="802.72" dur="5.489">here of consciousness because backing up</text>
  <text start="806.47" dur="5.19">a minute here as well when I was in high</text>
  <text start="808.209" dur="7.351">school I was hardcore atheist I was</text>
  <text start="811.66" dur="6.419">super atheist right I was reading like</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="5.699">Richard Dawkins books and Sam Harris</text>
  <text start="818.079" dur="5.31">books if you guys remember that Flying</text>
  <text start="821.259" dur="3.27">Spaghetti Monster you ever heard of</text>
  <text start="823.389" dur="2.55">that the Flying Spaghetti Monster thing</text>
  <text start="824.529" dur="2.79">I don&amp;#39;t know I thought that was the</text>
  <text start="825.939" dur="4.89">funniest thing in the world when I was</text>
  <text start="827.319" dur="5.46">like 16 years old so I had always had</text>
  <text start="830.829" dur="3.87">that philosophical kind of mind trying</text>
  <text start="832.779" dur="4.67">to understand what the heck&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="834.699" dur="5.7">going on here but when I was younger I</text>
  <text start="837.449" dur="5.74">was misled a little bit I was misled by</text>
  <text start="840.399" dur="7.351">that nihilistic kind of thinking that</text>
  <text start="843.189" dur="6.96">atheistic thinking so that changed that</text>
  <text start="847.75" dur="4.589">changed big time when I started waking</text>
  <text start="850.149" dur="5.19">up in 2011/12</text>
  <text start="852.339" dur="4.891">and I came across all of these science</text>
  <text start="855.339" dur="8.281">of consciousness all of these science of</text>
  <text start="857.23" dur="7.95">our DNA and the idea of humanity waking</text>
  <text start="863.62" dur="3.63">up right now and causing kind of a</text>
  <text start="865.18" dur="4.019">quantum shift not just within ourselves</text>
  <text start="867.25" dur="4.019">but also also in our external</text>
  <text start="869.199" dur="4.021">environment that quantum shift going on</text>
  <text start="871.269" dur="5.43">with our solar system with our galaxy</text>
  <text start="873.22" dur="5.369">you know the revelatory times the</text>
  <text start="876.699" dur="5.61">Ascension times or whatever I was just</text>
  <text start="878.589" dur="6.81">seeing this whole idea of spirit so I</text>
  <text start="882.309" dur="4.77">had a kind of a spiritual awakening at</text>
  <text start="885.399" dur="4.86">the same time that I was going deep I</text>
  <text start="887.079" dur="5.13">was going deep into the dark information</text>
  <text start="890.259" dur="3.93">as well so luckily I kind of did both of</text>
  <text start="892.209" dur="5.521">these things at once they go</text>
  <text start="894.189" dur="9.12">hand-in-hand but throughout those few</text>
  <text start="897.73" dur="8.849">years of 2012 13 14 that was tough</text>
  <text start="903.309" dur="5.791">that was super freaking tough because I</text>
  <text start="906.579" dur="4.05">went way deep and all that hardcore</text>
  <text start="909.1" dur="3.839">information of course when you start</text>
  <text start="910.629" dur="3.661">doing that it changes you and once it</text>
  <text start="912.939" dur="3.15">changes you your friends and family</text>
  <text start="914.29" dur="3.359">start seeing how you&amp;#39;re changed and then</text>
  <text start="916.089" dur="4.201">once you talk to them a little bit about</text>
  <text start="917.649" dur="4.17">what&amp;#39;s changing you they ostracize</text>
  <text start="920.29" dur="3.239">themselves away from you and you become</text>
  <text start="921.819" dur="4.62">the black sheep right that happened to</text>
  <text start="923.529" dur="5.28">me so my friends and family naturally</text>
  <text start="926.439" dur="8.161">gravitated away from me at that point in</text>
  <text start="928.809" dur="7.741">time I really just had again a couple</text>
  <text start="934.6" dur="4.65">friends at that point that stuck with</text>
  <text start="936.55" dur="5.039">yeah I had a few co-workers who were a</text>
  <text start="939.25" dur="3.81">little more woke than most people out</text>
  <text start="941.589" dur="3.331">there so I was able to connect with them</text>
  <text start="943.06" dur="3.51">a little bit more so and really the</text>
  <text start="944.92" dur="4.169">connecting that I got at that point in</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="4.35">time was with work as with work it was</text>
  <text start="949.089" dur="4.68">with people who I was helping with on a</text>
  <text start="950.92" dur="3.53">daily basis that was my that was my</text>
  <text start="953.769" dur="3.721">outlet</text>
  <text start="954.45" dur="5.47">not only was it my emotional outlet at</text>
  <text start="957.49" dur="4.89">that point in time but I was learning a</text>
  <text start="959.92" dur="4.08">load I was learning a whole load and I</text>
  <text start="962.38" dur="4.59">was also developing very important</text>
  <text start="964" dur="7.529">skills that I&amp;#39;m utilizing now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="966.97" dur="7.679">interesting to recollect as through my</text>
  <text start="971.529" dur="7.231">story because all of these jobs or</text>
  <text start="974.649" dur="6.63">positions or or places I held gave me</text>
  <text start="978.76" dur="4.079">very important skills and I&amp;#39;m utilizing</text>
  <text start="981.279" dur="5.101">now so when I was at that health food</text>
  <text start="982.839" dur="6.18">store one of my Jobs was to create an</text>
  <text start="986.38" dur="4.079">education manual you know they knew I</text>
  <text start="989.019" dur="3.031">was very smart they knew I was very good</text>

  <text start="995.709" dur="4.741">health foods herbs mushrooms just every</text>
  <text start="999.19" dur="5.85">little product we had in the store I</text>
  <text start="1000.45" dur="6.81">would make a multi-page sheet on facts</text>
  <text start="1005.04" dur="2.73">products on how the products would help</text>
  <text start="1007.26" dur="2.28">you</text>
  <text start="1007.77" dur="5.069">blah blah blah and that was to educate</text>
  <text start="1009.54" dur="6.12">the employees that we would hire to work</text>
  <text start="1012.839" dur="5.431">there so I became a really really good</text>
  <text start="1015.66" dur="4.98">at research I became really really good</text>
  <text start="1018.27" dur="4.559">at discerning what&amp;#39;s good and bad</text>
  <text start="1020.64" dur="4.439">research and this was in the health</text>
  <text start="1022.829" dur="6.63">realm in the pharmaceutical industry</text>
  <text start="1025.079" dur="7.26">right that&amp;#39;s where that those skills I</text>
  <text start="1029.459" dur="4.98">gained so I became very good at figuring</text>
  <text start="1032.339" dur="3.781">out you know what kind of BS health info</text>
  <text start="1034.439" dur="4.291">the mainstream establishment tries to</text>
  <text start="1036.12" dur="3.93">sell us and mixing that in with okay</text>
  <text start="1038.73" dur="3.62">what&amp;#39;s real out there where are these</text>
  <text start="1040.05" dur="4.649">alternative doctors or alternative</text>
  <text start="1042.35" dur="3.819">health journalists or activists we could</text>
  <text start="1044.699" dur="5.071">say who was giving us the proper</text>
  <text start="1046.169" dur="4.89">information so I became very skillful in</text>
  <text start="1049.77" dur="5.43">doing that and I also became very</text>
  <text start="1051.059" dur="8.131">skillful in talking to people and taking</text>
  <text start="1055.2" dur="6.51">very complex subjects breaking them down</text>
  <text start="1059.19" dur="4.02">for them to understand but also doing it</text>
  <text start="1061.71" dur="5.52">at the very same time when you&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1063.21" dur="6.39">to reframe their belief systems right so</text>
  <text start="1067.23" dur="3.24">I was doing that with freakin 30 40 50</text>
  <text start="1069.6" dur="3.12">people a day we</text>
  <text start="1070.47" dur="5.04">we get people that come in because their</text>
  <text start="1072.72" dur="4.62">mainstream doctor told them about an</text>
  <text start="1075.51" dur="3.27">herb or something like that or maybe</text>
  <text start="1077.34" dur="2.94">they heard it on the Internet</text>
  <text start="1078.78" dur="3.389">of course mainstream doctors they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1080.28" dur="4.56">know about nutrition or herbs or</text>
  <text start="1082.169" dur="4.531">whatnot so there we go yeah go into this</text>
  <text start="1084.84" dur="4.53">this food store and go see if they have</text>
  <text start="1086.7" dur="4.14">it so they would come in and that would</text>
  <text start="1089.37" dur="3.03">be my opportunity I would say oh you</text>
  <text start="1090.84" dur="3">know what brought you in well they would</text>
  <text start="1092.4" dur="3.42">say my doctor wants me to get this and</text>

  <text start="1098.19" dur="4.109">their doctor really had no clue so what</text>
  <text start="1100.65" dur="3.57">they actually came in for wasn&amp;#39;t gonna</text>
  <text start="1102.299" dur="4.231">help them in the least bit and then it</text>
  <text start="1104.22" dur="5.25">would turn into a half hour hour</text>
  <text start="1106.53" dur="4.98">conversation of me figuring out what</text>
  <text start="1109.47" dur="3.689">they really want what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="1111.51" dur="4.62">with them I would ask them a lot of</text>
  <text start="1113.159" dur="7.321">questions it became very personable you</text>
  <text start="1116.13" dur="7.74">know and that&amp;#39;s how I became very</text>
  <text start="1120.48" dur="9.54">proficient at discussing concepts with</text>
  <text start="1123.87" dur="7.95">people figuring them out analyzing human</text>
  <text start="1130.02" dur="7.11">beings from very objective standpoint</text>
  <text start="1131.82" dur="6.66">non-judgmental and learning people</text>
  <text start="1137.13" dur="3.27">learning what they needed how they</text>
  <text start="1138.48" dur="3.87">operated and also what would help them</text>
  <text start="1140.4" dur="3.3">experimented a lot with that try this</text>
  <text start="1142.35" dur="3.68">and they were try it and it would work</text>
  <text start="1143.7" dur="5.07">fantastic for them and and whatnot so</text>
  <text start="1146.03" dur="8.05">not only did I become a good researcher</text>
  <text start="1148.77" dur="7.289">and discerner but also a talker good at</text>
  <text start="1154.08" dur="3.87">breaking down complex subjects for</text>
  <text start="1156.059" dur="4.081">people so I did that for a long long</text>
  <text start="1157.95" dur="4.469">time I did that for six years at</text>
  <text start="1160.14" dur="5.13">actually a couple different stores doing</text>
  <text start="1162.419" dur="5.101">that and then after I worked really in</text>
  <text start="1165.27" dur="4.74">the supplement and sports nutrition</text>
  <text start="1167.52" dur="5.1">realm that was very helpful at that time</text>
  <text start="1170.01" dur="5.85">because not only was i working with just</text>
  <text start="1172.62" dur="5.49">basic supplements herbs probiotic</text>
  <text start="1175.86" dur="3.569">digestive stuff you know whatever the</text>
  <text start="1178.11" dur="3.75">case there&amp;#39;s also a lot of sports</text>
  <text start="1179.429" dur="4.411">nutrition there so we had proteins and</text>
  <text start="1181.86" dur="3.42">branched amino acids pre-workout so all</text>
  <text start="1183.84" dur="4.11">the kinds of stuff you know I lived in a</text>
  <text start="1185.28" dur="4.41">military town so military they like to</text>
  <text start="1187.95" dur="5.76">lift weights so we sold some pretty</text>
  <text start="1189.69" dur="7.469">hardcore stuff for hormones we had some</text>
  <text start="1193.71" dur="6.65">of those ha ha and you know I used to be</text>
  <text start="1197.159" dur="6.091">able to go into the gym and literally</text>
  <text start="1200.36" dur="4.03">yeah I knew like half the county going</text>
  <text start="1203.25" dur="2.34">to the gym and I would know all</text>
  <text start="1204.39" dur="3.54">people there I would know the stacks</text>
  <text start="1205.59" dur="4.35">they were taken and you might see a dude</text>
  <text start="1207.93" dur="4.29">that was 250 300 pounds be like I know</text>
  <text start="1209.94" dur="4.5">exactly what he&amp;#39;s taken that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1212.22" dur="5.73">natural I know he&amp;#39;s taking he&amp;#39;s taken so</text>
  <text start="1214.44" dur="8.6">it was fun but because I was in I was</text>
  <text start="1217.95" dur="7.65">athletic I was a good soccer player and</text>
  <text start="1223.04" dur="4.6">in the sports nutrition realm I then</text>
  <text start="1225.6" dur="4.68">went into personal training and strength</text>
  <text start="1227.64" dur="6.15">coaching for a little bit so I got a</text>
  <text start="1230.28" dur="7.05">personal training certificate and worked</text>
  <text start="1233.79" dur="5.16">for a few gems then I ended up working</text>
  <text start="1237.33" dur="3.96">for a chiropractor as well I was</text>
  <text start="1238.95" dur="3.75">teaching posture and corrective exercise</text>
  <text start="1241.29" dur="2.79">funny that&amp;#39;s actually where the</text>
  <text start="1242.7" dur="2.85">whiteboard came into the picture because</text>
  <text start="1244.08" dur="2.97">what I was doing at this chiropractic</text>
  <text start="1245.55" dur="4.02">clinic was literally teaching people</text>
  <text start="1247.05" dur="5.49">about their posture with a whiteboard</text>
  <text start="1249.57" dur="4.62">and that&amp;#39;s kind of again you know how it</text>
  <text start="1252.54" dur="2.7">all kind of came together so I was</text>
  <text start="1254.19" dur="2.61">teaching them about their posture with</text>
  <text start="1255.24" dur="4.8">the whiteboard but I was also personal</text>
  <text start="1256.8" dur="6.42">training and I worked at a powerlifting</text>
  <text start="1260.04" dur="4.74">gym so you know it wasn&amp;#39;t a machine gym</text>
  <text start="1263.22" dur="3.75">we had no machines all we had is</text>
  <text start="1264.78" dur="6.93">barbells barbells kettlebells and</text>
  <text start="1266.97" dur="6.15">dumbbells and some big tires and heavy</text>
  <text start="1271.71" dur="4.44">sleds to push you know as a strongman</text>
  <text start="1273.12" dur="5.4">gym so that was really fun but I only</text>
  <text start="1276.15" dur="3.99">ever worked at gyms just for a few</text>
  <text start="1278.52" dur="3.66">months at a time like this one that one</text>
  <text start="1280.14" dur="7.83">that one and it wasn&amp;#39;t fulfilling to me</text>
  <text start="1282.18" dur="10.77">because I was learning so much stuff and</text>
  <text start="1287.97" dur="6.6">this was throughout 2015/16 so those two</text>
  <text start="1292.95" dur="3.41">years is when I went to the personal</text>
  <text start="1294.57" dur="6.08">training strength coaching stuff and</text>
  <text start="1296.36" dur="8.47">again I was only teaching people about</text>
  <text start="1300.65" dur="6.73">health or exercise and here I was</text>
  <text start="1304.83" dur="4.08">learning about all this other stuff I</text>
  <text start="1307.38" dur="4.38">was learning about free energy in the</text>
  <text start="1308.91" dur="5.07">deep state and all this hardcore stuff</text>
  <text start="1311.76" dur="3.83">and I wasn&amp;#39;t you know I wasn&amp;#39;t talking</text>
  <text start="1313.98" dur="3.93">about it I didn&amp;#39;t have an outlet for it</text>
  <text start="1315.59" dur="4.5">so naturally I had a higher calling</text>
  <text start="1317.91" dur="6.33">within me to do that so I ended up</text>
  <text start="1320.09" dur="6.1">phasing myself out of working for</text>
  <text start="1324.24" dur="4.41">anybody working for a personal trainer</text>
  <text start="1326.19" dur="4.83">working or working for a gym or working</text>
  <text start="1328.65" dur="4.2">for somebody else and I ended up</text>
  <text start="1331.02" dur="3.75">quitting my jobs because of that higher</text>
  <text start="1332.85" dur="5.65">calling I&amp;#39;m just like you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1334.77" dur="6.43">talking to a few people a day</text>
  <text start="1338.5" dur="4.86">Max and who knows if they&amp;#39;re even gonna</text>
  <text start="1341.2" dur="5.01">listen in the air or take it to heart</text>
  <text start="1343.36" dur="4.92">and I&amp;#39;m only talking about health you</text>
  <text start="1346.21" dur="6.3">know this is just it&amp;#39;s not enough so</text>
  <text start="1348.28" dur="9.509">that&amp;#39;s why I quit straight-up quit quit</text>
  <text start="1352.51" dur="8.61">my jobs and I started this YouTube thing</text>
  <text start="1357.789" dur="7.861">that was at the very tail end of 2016</text>
  <text start="1361.12" dur="9.38">very beginning of 2017 and that was a</text>
  <text start="1365.65" dur="9.269">very let&amp;#39;s see here what I want to say</text>
  <text start="1370.5" dur="8.59">throughout 2015-16 it was a very dark</text>
  <text start="1374.919" dur="6.921">point very dark point I had a long dark</text>
  <text start="1379.09" dur="5.25">night of the soul and it was very like</text>

  <text start="1394.6" dur="8.309">just like God she doesn&amp;#39;t even faze me</text>

  <text start="1402.909" dur="4.351">and whatnot so I can look at the world</text>
  <text start="1404.08" dur="6.36">and and it doesn&amp;#39;t faze me you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1431.74" dur="7.38">introduced me to Gaia Wow back in 2015</text>
  <text start="1436.539" dur="4.76">you know if it wasn&amp;#39;t for her I never</text>
  <text start="1439.12" dur="4.59">would have come across that platform and</text>
  <text start="1441.299" dur="3.88">researched a lot of different things and</text>

  <text start="1445.179" dur="3.511">could talk to about a lot of this stuff</text>
  <text start="1446.53" dur="5.759">at that time and she passed away and</text>
  <text start="1448.69" dur="5.88">that was very long story behind that I</text>
  <text start="1452.289" dur="5.181">actually worked with her as well but</text>
  <text start="1454.57" dur="5.25">that was very hard I went through a</text>

  <text start="1459.82" dur="8.19">who was very mentally manipulative and</text>
  <text start="1463.799" dur="5.561">very narcissistic so that was very tough</text>

  <text start="1598.359" dur="3.481">time so that&amp;#39;s why I started this</text>
  <text start="1599.44" dur="5.549">YouTube channel and I just started the</text>
  <text start="1601.84" dur="4.38">beginning of 2017 dude it was a grind it</text>
  <text start="1604.989" dur="6.151">was like</text>
  <text start="1606.22" dur="6.36">two three videos a day sometimes I was</text>
  <text start="1611.14" dur="3.24">the first videos I was doing I was</text>
  <text start="1612.58" dur="3.99">editing heavily so it&amp;#39;d take me maybe</text>
  <text start="1614.38" dur="3.87">two hours to edit them and I&amp;#39;m - I was</text>
  <text start="1616.57" dur="4.92">starting to get carpal tunnel everything</text>
  <text start="1618.25" dur="7.47">from that but I was just going and I was</text>
  <text start="1621.49" dur="6.929">lucky enough to not only have a couple</text>
  <text start="1625.72" dur="5.43">connections with individuals that would</text>
  <text start="1628.419" dur="3.87">let me repost my work on their blogs so</text>
  <text start="1631.15" dur="3.45">that was one thing that helped me gain</text>
  <text start="1632.289" dur="8.01">an initial audience initial subscriber</text>
  <text start="1634.6" dur="7.939">base but also I was just very skillful</text>
  <text start="1640.299" dur="4.561">with marketing social media marketing I</text>
  <text start="1642.539" dur="3.551">studied like I mentioned earlier you</text>
  <text start="1644.86" dur="3.75">know people I subscribed to on YouTube</text>
  <text start="1646.09" dur="7.11">these were entrepreneurs these were</text>
  <text start="1648.61" dur="8.37">independent business owners non jobbers</text>
  <text start="1653.2" dur="6.51">as we could call them who were marketing</text>
  <text start="1656.98" dur="5.4">their own platforms and their own work</text>
  <text start="1659.71" dur="4.199">to make it work for themselves so I was</text>
  <text start="1662.38" dur="3.45">studying them I was studying their</text>
  <text start="1663.909" dur="3.841">marketing principles and how they were</text>
  <text start="1665.83" dur="4.469">marketing their YouTube channel and</text>
  <text start="1667.75" dur="3.539">their work so I applied a lot of that to</text>
  <text start="1670.299" dur="3.99">what I was doing</text>
  <text start="1671.289" dur="6.481">so it wasn&amp;#39;t any stroke of luck that my</text>
  <text start="1674.289" dur="5.401">channel grew and grew kind of exploded</text>
  <text start="1677.77" dur="4.01">over that first year or two you know</text>
  <text start="1679.69" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s just a lot of effort and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1681.78" dur="5.5">research and application application is</text>
  <text start="1685.12" dur="3.539">the important part you can research as</text>
  <text start="1687.28" dur="3.81">much as one but if you don&amp;#39;t apply that</text>
  <text start="1688.659" dur="5.581">knowledge you did in the water so I</text>
  <text start="1691.09" dur="7.26">applied that you know I would post a</text>
  <text start="1694.24" dur="6.33">video on YouTube I would share that to</text>
  <text start="1698.35" dur="6.569">Facebook cross post it and then what I</text>
  <text start="1700.57" dur="6.03">would do is add myself to like 30</text>
  <text start="1704.919" dur="4.471">different groups I didn&amp;#39;t care you know</text>
  <text start="1706.6" dur="5.25">30 groups public private just add myself</text>
  <text start="1709.39" dur="5.07">in and then just share that video from</text>
  <text start="1711.85" dur="5.55">Facebook to like 30 frickin groups it</text>
  <text start="1714.46" dur="4.77">would take me 30 45 minutes to do</text>
  <text start="1717.4" dur="3.33">sometimes because when you share a post</text>
  <text start="1719.23" dur="3.12">from Facebook into a group you can only</text>
  <text start="1720.73" dur="4.71">share into one group at a time so I had</text>
  <text start="1722.35" dur="4.92">to share this post into 30 different</text>
  <text start="1725.44" dur="3.78">groups complicated process took me a</text>
  <text start="1727.27" dur="4.5">while but hey that&amp;#39;s what I did for</text>
  <text start="1729.22" dur="5.429">months and months I probably got kicked</text>
  <text start="1731.77" dur="4.289">out of half of those groups maybe they</text>
  <text start="1734.649" dur="3.301">were probably like Oh Jordan you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1736.059" dur="3.601">post your own stuff in here and hold</text>
  <text start="1737.95" dur="3.44">yourself out like that but I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1739.66" dur="5.52">there I just kept doing it kept doing it</text>
  <text start="1741.39" dur="7.45">so again different things you do to make</text>
  <text start="1745.18" dur="6.93">it work for yourself who cares who cares</text>
  <text start="1748.84" dur="3.8">what they think you know you have a</text>
  <text start="1752.11" dur="3.93">dream</text>
  <text start="1752.64" dur="6.61">go get it focus on that don&amp;#39;t focus on</text>
  <text start="1756.04" dur="5.94">what the naysayers have to say so the</text>
  <text start="1759.25" dur="4.83">first few months was difficult and not</text>
  <text start="1761.98" dur="5.79">only was it you know I was grinding it</text>

  <text start="1770.38" dur="3.03">personal training and this is how I</text>
  <text start="1771.61" dur="3.59">financially made it work at the</text>
  <text start="1773.41" dur="5.4">beginning of my channel because I</text>
  <text start="1775.2" dur="5.02">totally quit my jobs and I&amp;#39;ll be honest</text>
  <text start="1778.81" dur="5.07">I was still living at my parents house</text>

  <text start="1805.99" dur="5.69">some clients and I was able to make ends</text>
  <text start="1808.66" dur="6.09">meet you know just freaking barely</text>
  <text start="1811.68" dur="4.45">luckily I would train them in their</text>
  <text start="1814.75" dur="4.05">homes I would go to their homes and</text>
  <text start="1816.13" dur="4.56">train them and they paid me pretty</text>
  <text start="1818.8" dur="3.18">decently so I was able to make ends meet</text>
  <text start="1820.69" dur="3.96">for the first you know four or five</text>
  <text start="1821.98" dur="5.45">months and dude it was a struggle though</text>
  <text start="1824.65" dur="8.94">I mean I remember this one day where I</text>
  <text start="1827.43" dur="8.38">was driving to meet my client and I</text>
  <text start="1833.59" dur="6.18">checked my bank account on my phone and</text>

  <text start="1862.09" dur="7.65">that&amp;#39;s the thing is that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1864.55" dur="7.83">out there are led they&amp;#39;ll run faster</text>
  <text start="1869.74" dur="3.57">towards a goal if you put something</text>
  <text start="1872.38" dur="3">behind them</text>
  <text start="1873.31" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s chasing them that&amp;#39;s about to bite</text>

  <text start="2322.15" dur="5.76">channel at that point when Q came on if</text>
  <text start="2324.25" dur="6.119">you remember this I did a video 20 days</text>
  <text start="2327.91" dur="4.11">before Q first started posting in this</text>
  <text start="2330.369" dur="8.041">video I entitled the calm before the</text>
  <text start="2332.02" dur="9.089">storm and I was analyzing what Trump</text>

  <text start="2589.009" dur="8.1">what cuz of course they&amp;#39;re still stuck</text>
  <text start="2590.599" dur="8.91">in that matrix mindset but then they see</text>

  <text start="2615.729" dur="5.83">but a lot of what I speak and say comes</text>
  <text start="2619.819" dur="3.811">through that particular point you know</text>
  <text start="2621.559" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s like a meditation when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2623.63" dur="4.379">sometimes when you&amp;#39;re talking you just</text>
  <text start="2625.699" dur="3.84">like black out right and it just comes</text>
  <text start="2628.009" dur="6.381">through you and that&amp;#39;s what I try to</text>
  <text start="2629.539" dur="8.64">channel every time I speak is that</text>
  <text start="2634.39" dur="7.559">mindset that state of mind and that you</text>
  <text start="2638.179" dur="3.77">just find what comes through you</text>
  <text start="2645.339" dur="4.38">speaking from the heart yes</text>
  <text start="2651.599" dur="4.02">speaking from your intuition calming</text>
  <text start="2653.759" dur="3.72">down that little monkey mind what&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="2655.619" dur="3.75">blood type I have no idea I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2657.479" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;m Rh negative but I don&amp;#39;t know what my</text>
  <text start="2659.369" dur="6.87">blood type is Scorpios are truth people</text>
  <text start="2663.059" dur="4.2">ha ha I am Scorpio through and through</text>
  <text start="2666.239" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m like a hundred and ten percent</text>

  <text start="2670.559" dur="6.69">signs are both in Scorpio sama I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="2672.599" dur="11.061">double Scorpio tell you more about me as</text>
  <text start="2677.249" dur="9.181">a healer yes so as a healer you know I</text>
  <text start="2683.66" dur="4.56">think we&amp;#39;re all healers actually you</text>
  <text start="2686.43" dur="6.99">know we all want to see people succeed</text>
  <text start="2688.22" dur="8.74">but as for myself I have a huge desire</text>
  <text start="2693.42" dur="5.909">to see people succeed and throughout my</text>
  <text start="2696.96" dur="5.089">life I have always been trying to help</text>
  <text start="2699.329" dur="4.861">people just literally feel better with</text>
  <text start="2702.049" dur="3.871">whatever it is you know physically I</text>
  <text start="2704.19" dur="4.649">used to be a personal trainer used to</text>
  <text start="2705.92" dur="5.29">help people with their nutrition and</text>
  <text start="2708.839" dur="4.23">their lifestyles so I was trying to heal</text>
  <text start="2711.21" dur="4.319">them in that regard and I came to find</text>
  <text start="2713.069" dur="4.26">out that if you only attack the physical</text>
  <text start="2715.529" dur="3.361">part of somebody it&amp;#39;s not going to get</text>
  <text start="2717.329" dur="4.5">to the root of the issue so yeah you can</text>
  <text start="2718.89" dur="7.859">exercise and eat better as much as you</text>
  <text start="2721.829" dur="8.04">want but dis-ease stems from an</text>
  <text start="2726.749" dur="6.33">imbalance of all aspects of you and by</text>
  <text start="2729.869" dur="4.95">all aspects I mean your physical mental</text>
  <text start="2733.079" dur="4.051">emotional spiritual self</text>
  <text start="2734.819" dur="3.98">so just attacking the physical is not</text>
  <text start="2737.13" dur="4.859">going to do anything really it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2738.799" dur="6.161">spiritual that is the top level then it</text>
  <text start="2741.989" dur="4.74">channels down into emotional mental</text>
  <text start="2744.96" dur="3.599">physical so if you have an issue issues</text>
  <text start="2746.729" dur="4.981">are always gonna be spiritually if you</text>
  <text start="2748.559" dur="7.41">find something wrong physically channels</text>
  <text start="2751.71" dur="7.7">down the down the chain there so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2755.969" dur="7.86">why I moved from personal training and</text>
  <text start="2759.41" dur="6.879">health sales into the Internet is</text>
  <text start="2763.829" dur="5.91">because here I&amp;#39;m focusing on people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2766.289" dur="6.33">minds that&amp;#39;s where it starts trying to</text>
  <text start="2769.739" dur="4.411">rephrase people&amp;#39;s belief systems I hope</text>
  <text start="2772.619" dur="3.21">that you know you&amp;#39;re making good choices</text>
  <text start="2774.15" dur="3.599">for yourself physically but that&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="2775.829" dur="3.39">you can lead a horse to water but you</text>
  <text start="2777.749" dur="3.931">can&amp;#39;t make them drink it so what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2779.219" dur="4.89">doing on the internet here is making</text>
  <text start="2781.68" dur="3.45">that water look a lot better for the</text>
  <text start="2784.109" dur="2.97">horse</text>
  <text start="2785.13" dur="3.239">selling the water to the horse making</text>
  <text start="2787.079" dur="6.69">that horse realize that it&amp;#39;s a damn</text>
  <text start="2788.369" dur="9.121">thirsty and it wants to drink so yeah</text>
  <text start="2793.769" dur="7.52">and through healing it starts in the</text>
  <text start="2797.49" dur="8.069">mind in the spirit try to get people to</text>
  <text start="2801.289" dur="5.411">become more spiritual individuals to get</text>
  <text start="2805.559" dur="2.881">away from the attachments the</text>
  <text start="2806.7" dur="3.74">attachments to labels the attachments to</text>
  <text start="2808.44" dur="5.099">this or that or wherever the case is</text>
  <text start="2810.44" dur="5.139">always trying to help people do that you</text>
  <text start="2813.539" dur="4.02">guys know I hate labels don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="2815.579" dur="3.301">labels don&amp;#39;t like when people lay label</text>
  <text start="2817.559" dur="3.21">themselves because that means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2818.88" dur="3.3">not comfortable in their own skin they</text>
  <text start="2820.769" dur="4.231">need to attach to something outside</text>
  <text start="2822.18" dur="4.98">themselves whether it&amp;#39;s this religion</text>
  <text start="2825" dur="4.589">that religion this political ideology</text>
  <text start="2827.16" dur="3.629">this belief system you know that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2829.589" dur="2.821">spiritual issue if you&amp;#39;re attaching the</text>
  <text start="2830.789" dur="6.211">labels it means you&amp;#39;re not comfortable</text>
  <text start="2832.41" dur="6.389">being a sovereign you so I really try to</text>
  <text start="2837" dur="3.9">help people become sovereign individuals</text>
  <text start="2838.799" dur="3.51">and then the mental part of things like</text>
  <text start="2840.9" dur="3.689">I&amp;#39;ve said I hate psyops</text>
  <text start="2842.309" dur="4.141">I hate when people get caught up with</text>
  <text start="2844.589" dur="6.331">mess and disinformation so I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="2846.45" dur="6.899">help people learn how to think not what</text>
  <text start="2850.92" dur="3.81">to think so there&amp;#39;s that and then</text>
  <text start="2853.349" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s the emotional side of things and</text>
  <text start="2854.73" dur="7.049">that&amp;#39;s a big a big topic that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2859.859" dur="2.97">get into much in my videos is the</text>
  <text start="2861.779" dur="2.401">emotional side of things but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2862.829" dur="4.051">something I&amp;#39;m very familiar with because</text>
  <text start="2864.18" dur="4.95">I&amp;#39;ve went through a lot of emotional</text>
  <text start="2866.88" dur="6.87">roller coasters in my life figuring out</text>
  <text start="2869.13" dur="8.879">how to deal with that and that&amp;#39;ll come</text>

  <text start="3052.82" dur="8.6">about the mind what would I find that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3057.71" dur="6.63">really healing is studying the work of</text>
  <text start="3061.42" dur="10.45">psychoanalysis so for instance Carl Jung</text>
  <text start="3064.34" dur="9.48">Joseph Campbell archetypes those ideas</text>
  <text start="3071.87" dur="7.29">because you really come to understand</text>
  <text start="3073.82" dur="6.93">how a human mind functions and that</text>
  <text start="3079.16" dur="3.48">helps you not only understand yourself</text>
