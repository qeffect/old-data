  <text start="6.47" dur="4.66">yo so what I get to doing more Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="4.08">videos on this channel I get a lot of</text>
  <text start="11.13" dur="4.29">questions from people and I want to get</text>
  <text start="13.259" dur="4.02">into them a little deeper there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="3.24">of insights in my mind and on my heart</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="3.09">that I want to share with you guys and</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="4.369">this particular question comes from</text>
  <text start="20.369" dur="4.801">Instagram our friend says hey brother</text>
  <text start="23.029" dur="4.66">just found your YouTube during some</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="5.849">research apparently I opened my third</text>
  <text start="27.689" dur="5.521">eye on September 1st not intentional not</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="5.13">something I was working for it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="33.21" dur="4.47">interesting but boom open and now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="36.149" dur="3.331">having all sorts of downloads and</text>
  <text start="37.68" dur="4.92">different activity I&amp;#39;m dealing with on a</text>
  <text start="39.48" dur="5.52">daily basis including physical</text>
  <text start="42.6" dur="4.86">experiences from outside things he says</text>
  <text start="45" dur="4.68">I take that to mean maybe he&amp;#39;s seen</text>
  <text start="47.46" dur="3.57">craft in the sky or energy around him</text>
  <text start="49.68" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure but nonetheless</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="5.13">he&amp;#39;s waking up do you have any book you</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="5.52">would recommend or what I can do to be</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="7.169">best prepared totally thanks for your</text>
  <text start="59.19" dur="7.08">question and funny enough coincidentally</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="5.211">if coincidences exist they don&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="66.27" dur="4.23">synchronistically as I like to say on</text>
  <text start="68.54" dur="3.31">Kindle I&amp;#39;m reading this book right now</text>
  <text start="70.5" dur="5.46">let me pull it up and show you</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s called cosmic consciousness this</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="4.29">study in the evolution of the human mind</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="4.379">by Richard Maurice buck just sounded</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="5.42">interesting one day so I kindled it and</text>
  <text start="82.409" dur="6.57">I really liked this book this author</text>
  <text start="85.67" dur="5.23">describes his own opening his third eye</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="3.6">concept he calls it coming to cosmic</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.84">consciousness and the reason I like it</text>
  <text start="92.579" dur="3.871">is because this book is old it was</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="5.55">published in 1929</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="7.05">so this author describes these concepts</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="5.25">without the typical terminology or</text>
  <text start="103.5" dur="4.259">nomenclature that we often hear of them</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="6.079">described with today so it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="6.991">unique perspective and it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="111.619" dur="4.96">structured psychological philosophical</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="4.71">perspective so I think you might like it</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="6.451">there&amp;#39;s one one book and quite honestly</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="6.06">man there is so many different books and</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="4.53">documentaries that I could rattle off</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="3.9">and suggest to you right now but one</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="4.89">piece of advice that I would actually</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="4.06">say first is find what interests you</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="3.64">what fast</text>
  <text start="133.48" dur="5.55">you the most about all this and just</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="6.42">delve into that follow your bliss as</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="5.819">Joseph Campbell would say because there</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="3.93">are all sorts of different resources out</text>
  <text start="144.849" dur="3.601">there that are all trying to point</text>
  <text start="146.44" dur="4.14">towards the truth from their own</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="3.06">particular angles there&amp;#39;s only one truth</text>
  <text start="150.58" dur="2.519">you gotta understand so they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="4.38">trying to point at that truth from their</text>
  <text start="153.099" dur="5.64">own angles and what has influenced and</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="4.83">enlightened me the most might not be</text>
  <text start="158.739" dur="4.59">what influences or enlightens you the</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="5.25">most or strikes your chords if you see</text>
  <text start="163.329" dur="4.831">what I&amp;#39;m saying so as you dig into this</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="5.129">as you start researching all this just</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="6.419">find what fascinates you and dig into</text>
  <text start="171.099" dur="5.101">that and protip though as you&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="174.579" dur="3.421">through all this information remember to</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="2.819">log it and record it that&amp;#39;s one thing I</text>
  <text start="178" dur="3.51">wish I would have done like five or six</text>
  <text start="179.019" dur="5.161">years ago more is when I was researching</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="5.099">all this make sure what I was hearing</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="4.74">from who and what we&amp;#39;re logged the books</text>
  <text start="186.609" dur="3.841">and the websites and all of that I was</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="4.77">just kind of getting lost in the</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="5.879">information saturation of it all so be</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="4.139">slow and methodical as you research all</text>
  <text start="196.329" dur="3.121">this because trust me there&amp;#39;s a lot out</text>
  <text start="197.829" dur="3.78">there that you&amp;#39;re starting to dig into</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="5.009">so be methodical with it but just go</text>
  <text start="201.609" dur="5.821">with what interests you so there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="204.459" dur="4.381">first piece of advice but the second</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="3.899">part you know we&amp;#39;ve kind of been talking</text>
  <text start="208.84" dur="4.259">to this about knowledge acquisition</text>
  <text start="211.329" dur="3.961">information acquisition and there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="213.099" dur="6.061">so much left braining you can do with</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="6.15">all of this that the right brain kind of</text>
  <text start="219.16" dur="6.299">misses and really what I&amp;#39;m saying here</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="6.299">is experience there&amp;#39;s no better teacher</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="5.731">than experience experience is really</text>
  <text start="227.739" dur="6.12">what helps you to distill all of that</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="4.53">information you&amp;#39;re trying to acquire so</text>
  <text start="233.859" dur="4.231">actually experiencing these higher</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="4.44">states of consciousness and experiencing</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="4.049">activating the third eye which it sounds</text>
  <text start="240.16" dur="3.299">like you are very interested in because</text>
  <text start="242.139" dur="5.85">obviously you&amp;#39;re sending me this</text>
  <text start="243.459" dur="7.14">question trying to understand it more so</text>
  <text start="247.989" dur="4.351">so by experience experience of these</text>
  <text start="250.599" dur="4.92">higher states of consciousness I simply</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="8.85">mean continue researching but then apply</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="7.471">it so meditate right meditate get all</text>
  <text start="261.19" dur="4.76">the thought out of your mind try to drop</text>
  <text start="262.99" dur="4.2">your brainwaves to a very low state to</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="2.98">act</text>
  <text start="267.19" dur="3.24">access to your higher-self you&amp;#39;re more</text>
  <text start="268.93" dur="4.23">intuitive mind you see so maybe</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="7.22">meditation or contemplation of all these</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="9.48">ideas or maybe you play around with</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="8.26">binaural beats or maybe you go out in</text>
  <text start="282.64" dur="5.55">nature and try to open your third eye</text>
  <text start="285.91" dur="5.01">with different natural remedies</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="5.31">different shamanistic ways you know</text>
  <text start="290.92" dur="3">psychedelics ayahuasca or mushrooms or</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="2.61">whatnot</text>
  <text start="293.92" dur="4.11">of course again research all these</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="3.45">things before you do them come to a full</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="2.46">understanding of what you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="4.62">yourself into</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="5.31">with this new realm of existence you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="2.85">opening yourself up to you see what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="305.8" dur="2.43">saying just be very careful as you</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="4.41">proceed through all of these things</text>
  <text start="308.23" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t have anybody make you do</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="3.09">psychedelics if you&amp;#39;re not deeply ready</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="2.46">for them if you&amp;#39;re not fully</text>
  <text start="314.53" dur="3.45">understanding of the situation you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="4.5">getting yourself into don&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="317.98" dur="4.74">you know maybe remote viewing or trying</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="4.53">to loose a dream or astral travel if</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re not fully understanding of the</text>
  <text start="324.97" dur="3.95">energies you&amp;#39;re dealing with so you know</text>
  <text start="326.98" dur="4.02">these aren&amp;#39;t things that are</text>
  <text start="328.92" dur="5.05">hippie-dippie and woowoo but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="331" dur="5.07">nothing to play around with as well so</text>

  <text start="341.35" dur="6.33">precipice of blasting yourself off into</text>
