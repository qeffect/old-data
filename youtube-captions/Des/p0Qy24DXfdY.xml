  <text start="157.75" dur="6.599">so big things blowing up by way of Seth</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="3.84">which this Seth rich investigation is</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="4.051">just is just exploding and that was the</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="4.86">last video I did before I was before I</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="3.839">left and I knew I knew this story was</text>
  <text start="171.01" dur="2.85">gonna heat up while I was gone and it</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="4.891">did so much that that&amp;#39;s why I had to do</text>
  <text start="173.86" dur="5.22">this video but Seth rich I mean one week</text>
  <text start="177.13" dur="6">ago we had his private investigator come</text>
  <text start="179.08" dur="6.93">out and now funny enough Fox News</text>
  <text start="183.13" dur="6.54">actually ran a story essentially giving</text>
  <text start="186.01" dur="5.759">credence or taking this story very</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="5.94">seriously and they really saw May 16th</text>
  <text start="191.769" dur="5.701">well now I mean over the past few days a</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="4.02">lot of these other corporate mainstream</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="4.07">media rags like Washington Post in New</text>
  <text start="199.63" dur="4.26">York Times and CNN they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="3.85">completely on Fox News for</text>
  <text start="203.89" dur="4.23">doing that so honestly Fox News is super</text>
  <text start="205.39" dur="3.9">surprising to me I think there might</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="2.88">have been a change of management there</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="3.39">are some of that effect to where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="211" dur="3.269">pushed certain people out of that</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="3.45">organization they&amp;#39;re trying to get some</text>
  <text start="214.269" dur="3.211">truth out they actually had to retract</text>
  <text start="216.13" dur="3.21">their story I think they retracted that</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="3.99">separate story just today because they</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="3.45">were taking so much heat from like I</text>
  <text start="221.47" dur="5.489">said Washington Post and BuzzFeed and</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="6.81">all the other still owned complete</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="4.65">propaganda rags so the thing is this</text>
  <text start="229.6" dur="3.57">Seth&amp;#39;s rich story is blowing up and</text>
  <text start="231.609" dur="3.6">spoiling so fast I mean not only do we</text>
  <text start="233.17" dur="3.689">have the P I private investigator come</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="3.241">out of week ago Fox News reported on it</text>
  <text start="236.859" dur="3.451">lots of of course alternative media</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="4.409">outlets are reporting on it Kim comm</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="4.399">came out with a tweet and a statement</text>
  <text start="242.859" dur="4.681">today saying that he was actually</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="7.541">directly connected to Seth rich leaking</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="6.72">these emails to WikiLeaks so that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="252.25" dur="3.81">is the story that they&amp;#39;re all trying to</text>
  <text start="254.26" dur="4.229">distract from and cover their ass from</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="3.72">so of course on you know Washington Post</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="2.671">they&amp;#39;re still calling it all fake news</text>
  <text start="259.78" dur="2.52">and a conspiracy theory and covering</text>
  <text start="261.16" dur="2.759">their ass and all the other media</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="3.66">outlets are too but they&amp;#39;re also trying</text>
  <text start="263.919" dur="3.631">to distract us from it because there was</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="4.38">that false flag terror attack yesterday</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="5.7">on May 22nd of course the 22nd they</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="4.62">elect their ritualistic dates there</text>
  <text start="273.25" dur="4.289">their numerology dates</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="4.169">the Cabal does and they needed a story</text>
  <text start="277.539" dur="4.071">to distract from so they pulled a terror</text>
  <text start="279.129" dur="6.211">attack quite obviously a false flag in</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="5.17">Manchester England so you can see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.34" dur="2.609">heating up the such historian&amp;#39;s heating</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="2.55">up and of course I heard some other</text>
  <text start="287.949" dur="2.581">things were born in England as well with</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="2.579">elections or whatnot over there but</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s so many things that are boiling</text>
  <text start="291.909" dur="4.891">the pot that they need a distraction</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="6.06">story from it so that&amp;#39;s why the terror</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="4.5">attack happened false flag and to keep</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="4.619">an eye on this Seth rich story as well</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="5.04">because information is coming everywhere</text>
  <text start="304.479" dur="4.651">it&amp;#39;s this is the the thing is this</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="5.549">separate story it&amp;#39;s the the first domino</text>
  <text start="309.13" dur="4.409">that&amp;#39;s falling okay so the corporate</text>
  <text start="311.889" dur="3.511">media did a good job and kind of</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="4.591">nullifying the pizza gate and pedo gate</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="4.68">scandals that it&amp;#39;s almost as RIF is if</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="4.2">this separate story is blowing up to be</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="4.139">the first domino that knocks down the</text>
  <text start="322.33" dur="3.839">one of pizza gate right and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.219" dur="3.57">gonna keep going because the sestra</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="3.451">separate story directly implicates</text>
  <text start="327.789" dur="4.771">Podesta in the Clinton campaign once</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="5.91">that domino falls okay and this in the</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="4.889">Pizza Gate story becomes undeniable then</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="4.319">that&amp;#39;ll lead into greater disclosures I</text>
  <text start="337.449" dur="3.991">believe of pedo Gate and whatnot but the</text>
  <text start="339.849" dur="3.421">reason I believe that is because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="5.039">gonna keep talking about it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="6.92">the only way these dominoes will fall is</text>
  <text start="346.479" dur="6.3">if you keep talking about it - so anyway</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="4.629">can&amp;#39;t let them can&amp;#39;t let them get away</text>
  <text start="352.779" dur="3.961">with this stuff and we can&amp;#39;t let it let</text>
  <text start="354.819" dur="3.6">ourselves be apathetic that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="4.44">thing I&amp;#39;ve had I&amp;#39;ve encountered a lot of</text>
  <text start="358.419" dur="5.041">cynicism lately people you know thinking</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="3.599">that so much cynicism everywhere people</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="3.329">thinking that you know it&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="364.779" dur="3.75">happen the elite oh you know they&amp;#39;ll set</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="3.6">off World War 3 before they get rounded</text>
  <text start="368.529" dur="3.32">up is so far away but the only reason</text>
  <text start="370.389" dur="3.33">they think it&amp;#39;s so far away is because</text>
  <text start="371.849" dur="4.241">there&amp;#39;s playing into that victim</text>
  <text start="373.719" dur="3.901">mentality and if we all start speaking</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="3.6">about it and waking up our friends and</text>
  <text start="377.62" dur="4.5">family it&amp;#39;ll come very much sooner</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="4.71">okay yeah if we all woke up tomorrow</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="4.769">awake then it would literally be</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="4.65">tomorrow so keep that in mind and then</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="3.84">lastly this Trump trip it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="2.97">interesting not lastly couple more</text>
  <text start="390.729" dur="4.56">things but this Trump trip is really</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="5.25">interesting because he I wanted to make</text>
  <text start="395.289" dur="4.201">a note on that he decided to go up and</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="3.78">leave right as you know this separate</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.56">story ends</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="5.01">as even Zero Hedge reported a DC insider</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="3.45">saying the Democratic National Committee</text>
  <text start="406.06" dur="2.12">is imploding our government&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="407.5" dur="3.84">crazy</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="5.169">Trump decides to leave decides to split</text>
  <text start="411.34" dur="4.44">while everything kind of burns down over</text>
  <text start="413.349" dur="4.081">here I think this is planned you know</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="4.259">kind of from behind the scenes honestly</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="4.59">I think a lot of this separate story</text>
  <text start="420.039" dur="3.541">blowing up and maybe even kim.com stuff</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s might be all following like a</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="5.85">specific plan while Trump&amp;#39;s gone to</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="2.94">implode it over here and keep in mind a</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="2.97">lot of these things I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="3.18">weird stuff go on from the Trump strip</text>
  <text start="432.4" dur="3.9">right he had like his hands on this</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="6.24">glowing globe and kissing the wall and</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="6.359">everything but I saw funny meme where</text>
  <text start="440.11" dur="5.839">Trump was like the wall I will build you</text>
  <text start="442.659" dur="6.841">a brother it&amp;#39;s hilarious but anyway</text>
  <text start="445.949" dur="5.351">Trump was a don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t get triggered by</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="3.62">superficial things okay I mean he&amp;#39;s had</text>
  <text start="451.3" dur="3.66">his hands on a globe and everything but</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="4.09">keep your friends close and keep your</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="3.72">enemies closer so and he could very you</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="2.489">know who knows what might be going on in</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="2.91">there but I see a lot of people getting</text>
  <text start="459.699" dur="3.87">triggered by like his hands on the globe</text>
  <text start="461.59" dur="3.24">for instance so we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.569" dur="3.09">going on behind the scenes we don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="4.079">mean the picture is not gonna tell us so</text>
  <text start="466.659" dur="4.921">don&amp;#39;t get triggered and also on that</text>
  <text start="468.909" dur="5.82">note it was Iran actually one of their I</text>
  <text start="471.58" dur="6.149">believe top officials said that was</text>
  <text start="474.729" dur="4.74">telling Trump to ask Saudi Arabia about</text>
  <text start="477.729" dur="4.081">their basically their involvement in</text>
  <text start="479.469" dur="4.92">9/11 and that was reported unlike the</text>
  <text start="481.81" dur="4.109">Express I think so again a lot of people</text>
  <text start="484.389" dur="3.451">in these mainstream media outlets want</text>
  <text start="485.919" dur="4.081">to report the truth and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="487.84" dur="5.039">to but there&amp;#39;s you know infiltration</text>
  <text start="490" dur="3.509">from other faction factions so that was</text>
  <text start="492.879" dur="4.621">very interesting</text>
  <text start="493.509" dur="5.791">Iran kind of talking and then lastly</text>
  <text start="497.5" dur="4.919">last thing I wanted to get to is science</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="4.35">disclosures so there&amp;#39;s been tons I mean</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="2.761">there&amp;#39;s been tons of seating of</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="2.46">information out into the public</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="3.03">consciousness the collective</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="5.19">consciousness while all this other crazy</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="6.54">political stuff goes on and one of those</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="6.21">things is more just desperate stories on</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="4.8">nonterrestrials well science alert I</text>
  <text start="517.51" dur="4.199">think a few other outlets mainstream</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="3.719">news science news outlets we&amp;#39;re claiming</text>
  <text start="521.709" dur="3.12">this alien mega-structure is like back</text>
  <text start="523.269" dur="3.69">to life or doing some other weird</text>
  <text start="524.829" dur="3.991">so I don&amp;#39;t even know their I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.959" dur="4.021">just desperation with they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="3.57">get us to take these stories seriously</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="3.51">as much as they can but of course they</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="4.05">haven&amp;#39;t told us about the last</text>
  <text start="534.49" dur="3.75">years of what&amp;#39;s really gone on which is</text>
  <text start="536.44" dur="4.2">you know why one reason I&amp;#39;m we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="4.56">helping work on this book is to do that</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="5.73">to get the true truth out there not</text>
  <text start="542.8" dur="5.88">half-truths and also I saw this story on</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="5.06">futurism comm which is one of my</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="5.52">favorite shitty news outlets about NASA</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="5.32">finding that there&amp;#39;s like a space bubble</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="7.8">around earth that&amp;#39;s created by manmade</text>
  <text start="556.75" dur="7.32">very low-frequency VLF waves which this</text>
  <text start="562" dur="3.54">article was claiming actually helps</text>
  <text start="564.07" dur="4.32">protect the earth from solar radiation</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="6.51">and let me tell you this article is</text>
  <text start="568.39" dur="6.03">complete trying to give us</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="4.349">another way they&amp;#39;re basically the powers</text>
  <text start="574.42" dur="3.9">that be or were I mean some people get</text>
  <text start="576.399" dur="3.511">caught up on powers-that-be don&amp;#39;t call</text>
  <text start="578.32" dur="4.5">them that and they get triggered</text>
  <text start="579.91" dur="6.21">there&amp;#39;s the powers that be at the moment</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re the ones that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="586.12" dur="4.44">first of all they&amp;#39;re trying to bring</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="3.93">geoengineering or chemtrails out to the</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="3.33">public domain claiming it manages solar</text>
  <text start="592.57" dur="4.19">radiation and they&amp;#39;re trying to claim</text>
  <text start="593.89" dur="5.699">the Sun solar radiation is bad for us</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="4.99">so let&amp;#39;s chemtrail the place but too</text>
  <text start="599.589" dur="3.87">many people are aware of chemtrails</text>
  <text start="601.75" dur="3.93">right now so what they&amp;#39;re doing is now</text>
  <text start="603.459" dur="4.5">claiming that this these very</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="4.14">low-frequency waves that we all you know</text>
  <text start="607.959" dur="4.741">put off by all of our electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="609.82" dur="4.32">electronics it&amp;#39;s actually protecting us</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="3.78">and we need it to mitigate solar</text>
  <text start="614.14" dur="6.72">radiation so hey this is a</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="7.04">story to conveniently roll out 5g which</text>
  <text start="620.86" dur="4.86">is very dangerous it&amp;#39;s like the next gen</text>
  <text start="623.52" dur="3.7">cellphone frequency bandwidth that</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ll be on it&amp;#39;s completely you know</text>
  <text start="627.22" dur="5.25">it just bathes us and cancer cancer</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="4.83">waves you know electromagnetic radiation</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="3.45">not only does it prep us for that make</text>
  <text start="634.75" dur="7.649">us think it&amp;#39;s good or make the public</text>
  <text start="635.92" dur="10.02">think it&amp;#39;s good it also gets the public</text>
  <text start="642.399" dur="6.211">to be very concerned of solar radiation</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="4.32">and be very fearful of it be very scared</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="4.44">of whatever goes on with the Sun and</text>
  <text start="650.26" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s of course I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="653.05" dur="2.849">through that in my videos that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="3.84">theme is that solar radiation is</text>
  <text start="655.899" dur="4.861">increasing and it&amp;#39;s its effects on our</text>
  <text start="658.06" dur="5.01">consciousness is needed ok so there&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="660.76" dur="4.019">course some solar radiation is bad to a</text>
  <text start="663.07" dur="5.32">point it can have toxic effects on you</text>
  <text start="664.779" dur="6.401">if you don&amp;#39;t get take care of yourself</text>
  <text start="668.39" dur="4.74">that kind of delves into the whole if we</text>
  <text start="671.18" dur="3.93">need sunlight sunscreen most sunscreen</text>
  <text start="673.13" dur="4.35">sucks talk which I won&amp;#39;t get into here</text>
  <text start="675.11" dur="4.5">but solar radiation management on a</text>
  <text start="677.48" dur="3.87">cosmic level is a fantastic thing but</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s helping to evolve us it&amp;#39;s helping</text>
  <text start="681.35" dur="4.17">to essentially activate our DNA in a way</text>
  <text start="683.45" dur="4.56">and there&amp;#39;s a lot more solar radiations</text>
  <text start="685.52" dur="5.25">that we are expecting to occur and they</text>
  <text start="688.01" dur="5.34">are very imminent now what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="690.77" dur="4.17">again with this article is to make us</text>
  <text start="693.35" dur="6.06">scared of these solar radiation changes</text>
  <text start="694.94" dur="7.23">so then they&amp;#39;ve spin and ass-backwards</text>
  <text start="699.41" dur="4.05">and get people to think that poisoning</text>
  <text start="702.17" dur="4.17">and killing themselves is actually what</text>
  <text start="703.46" dur="5.58">they need to do so again don&amp;#39;t be a lots</text>
  <text start="706.34" dur="4.44">of there&amp;#39;s a lot of like half-truths</text>
  <text start="709.04" dur="3.84">that the mainstream is putting out</text>
  <text start="710.78" dur="3.6">through their science you know</text>
  <text start="712.88" dur="2.88">mainstream science is putting out</text>
  <text start="714.38" dur="2.49">there&amp;#39;s a lot of half-truths and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.76" dur="3.93">a lot of like ass backwards</text>
  <text start="716.87" dur="4.5">disinformation so it&amp;#39;s such a such a</text>
  <text start="719.69" dur="2.67">difficult time weeding through it all</text>
  <text start="721.37" dur="2.58">but that&amp;#39;s why I do these videos and</text>
  <text start="722.36" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s why I wanted to do a quick update</text>
