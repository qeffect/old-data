  <text start="1.82" dur="4.689">so feels good to get out from behind</text>
  <text start="4.41" dur="3.779">that desk every so often switch it up a</text>
  <text start="6.509" dur="4.951">little bit here what I want to discuss</text>
  <text start="8.189" dur="5.731">is the idea of Big Pharma holding back</text>
  <text start="11.46" dur="4.56">cures then I want to discuss a little</text>
  <text start="13.92" dur="4.65">bit about what I think it cure actually</text>
  <text start="16.02" dur="5.37">is a lot of people getting caught up</text>
  <text start="18.57" dur="4.83">with a sort of savior mentality when it</text>
  <text start="21.39" dur="4.29">comes to that for letter C word there</text>
  <text start="23.4" dur="5.219">but first let&amp;#39;s discuss Big Pharma</text>
  <text start="25.68" dur="5.4">holding back tears so in my perusing on</text>
  <text start="28.619" dur="5.041">the internet on social media the past</text>
  <text start="31.08" dur="5.19">few days few weeks I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="33.66" dur="4.62">people discussed that they&amp;#39;re saying man</text>
  <text start="36.27" dur="3.84">I really wish we&amp;#39;d get these cures</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="3.63">released from Big Pharma because we got</text>
  <text start="40.11" dur="4.5">in these diseases we got to start</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="6.57">healing again we need the cures you know</text>
  <text start="44.61" dur="8.07">and some thoughts on this first of all</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="6.21">actually the idea of Big Pharma holding</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="4.649">back breakthrough medical technologies I</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="4.83">fully believe you know makes sense we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="57.329" dur="4.021">got over here the deep state holding</text>
  <text start="59.52" dur="3.929">back free energy technologies in</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="3.599">their.what aerospace and defense</text>
  <text start="63.449" dur="2.67">contractor program so it just makes</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="3.181">sense that they would be holding back</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="4.591">some sort of medical technologies over</text>
  <text start="68.13" dur="5.94">here in secret pharmaceutical projects</text>
  <text start="70.71" dur="5.19">you know so I enjoy the fact that people</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="4.35">are expanding their thinking they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="75.9" dur="5.1">waking up to big pharma they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="3.989">that wow the deep state could be having</text>
  <text start="81" dur="3.18">secret stuff that they&amp;#39;re not letting</text>
  <text start="82.409" dur="5.611">out to the public for various reasons</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="7.14">power money control but another thought</text>
  <text start="88.02" dur="5.93">I have on that and important insights</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="6.15">here is that I see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="93.95" dur="4.93">waiting they say you know we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="3.3">going to be able to get rid of disease</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to heal you know</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="3.09">we&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to do this and</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="6.029">do that until we get these cures from</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="6.39">Big Pharma and this is not the case this</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="6.511">is not the case at all you know you</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="7.619">don&amp;#39;t need to wait for Big Pharma to put</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="5.61">out anything or any sort of medical</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="6.061">technologies to get disclosed to start</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="5.339">healing right now and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="3.63">that there aren&amp;#39;t some breakthrough</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="4.47">medical technologies that could get</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="5.85">really someday that we could use to heal</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="3.961">much easier but what I&amp;#39;m saying is don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="3.66">under</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="5.76">estimate the power of everything you</text>
  <text start="137.07" dur="4.62">have available to you right now to start</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="4.53">making your life better to start healing</text>
  <text start="141.69" dur="6">yourself with you know there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="5.49">out there so many natural remedies</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="6.21">available to you again at this very</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="6.98">moment that you could get and start</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="5.73">implementing and start healing with</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="7.03">herbs don&amp;#39;t underestimate the power of</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="5.97">herbs plants fungi medicinal mushrooms</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t instrument underestimate the power</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="5.22">of those don&amp;#39;t underestimate the power</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="6.03">of just simply eating a bunch of organic</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="4.86">food and juicing wheatgrass</text>
  <text start="173.52" dur="5.97">spirulina you know don&amp;#39;t underestimate</text>
  <text start="175.68" dur="6.63">the power of oxidation therapies food</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="3.63">grade hydrogen peroxide MMS various</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="2.76">things like this</text>
  <text start="183.12" dur="3.99">all of these are easily available to you</text>
  <text start="185.07" dur="3.72">you can buy a lot of what I just said on</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="6.12">the internet have it shipped to your</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="7.83">door again lots of stuff out there guys</text>
  <text start="193.23" dur="7.17">you don&amp;#39;t need to wait for anything to</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="6.06">get disclosed by anybody it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="5.01">the choices you&amp;#39;re making right now in</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="4.17">that sort of segues into the next idea I</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="6.6">wanted to talk about in actually</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="7.53">discussing curing I don&amp;#39;t like that idea</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="4.68">I don&amp;#39;t like that word cure frankly I</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t like it if you listen to many of</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="3.12">the videos I do on health and the way</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="6.72">I&amp;#39;m talking to you here I&amp;#39;m using words</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="8.61">such as remedy or modality or healing</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="6.78">because that idea of curing I find</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="5.46">always comes with so much preconceived</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="5.96">notions so much false connotation in</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="6.75">people&amp;#39;s minds because it becomes an</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="5.83">external Savior sort of SIOP I see a lot</text>
  <text start="240.63" dur="4.47">of Savior mentality in people&amp;#39;s belief</text>
  <text start="243.33" dur="5.37">systems when it comes to curing you know</text>
  <text start="245.1" dur="6.359">they think that this particular compound</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="6.18">this particular remedy is going to be</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="6.661">the end-all be-all cure for them even if</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s natural you know we could use hemp</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="3.39">oil Rick Simpson oil for instance they</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="3.149">think that rific Simpson oil is going to</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.95">be the cure you&amp;#39;re gonna be able to cure</text>
  <text start="263.039" dur="5.171">yourself with this external substance</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="4.9">this thing right here</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="5.519">and again important insight that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="6.029">the case we need to dig a little deeper</text>
  <text start="273.729" dur="6.901">here and understand that the idea of</text>
  <text start="277.389" dur="4.381">curing is well one I just don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="5.67">say it in the first place but the idea</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="6.239">of healing doesn&amp;#39;t come from one</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="4.489">substance doesn&amp;#39;t come from even an</text>
  <text start="288.009" dur="6.84">external source it&amp;#39;s an internal process</text>
  <text start="290.789" dur="6.791">right Lefton say god&amp;#39;s not external it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.849" dur="5.011">internal it&amp;#39;s within healing you know</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="4.23">healing enlightenment itself is not</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="4.92">external you&amp;#39;re not gonna get it from</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="5.25">this little supplement here this this</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="4.199">modality this remedy it&amp;#39;s an internal</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="3.06">process so what I mean by that let me</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="4.91">explain a little more so it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="6.359">sound so woowoo what I mean by that is</text>
  <text start="313.889" dur="5.171">okay let&amp;#39;s go back to that Rick Simpson</text>
  <text start="316.479" dur="4.231">oil or you know I could use vitamin b17</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="3.599">I could use whatever because the example</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="7.019">here it&amp;#39;s not the point the point is</text>
  <text start="322.659" dur="8.1">that compound is just a tool right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.729" dur="5.31">not going to be the savior for you but</text>
  <text start="330.759" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s a tool that you&amp;#39;re using to heal</text>
  <text start="333.039" dur="4.62">but if you only use that one tool you</text>
  <text start="335.889" dur="3.9">know you&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to build a</text>
  <text start="337.659" dur="3.811">house with a hammer with one tool if</text>
  <text start="339.789" dur="4.711">you&amp;#39;re trying to heal yourself there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="4.86">so much more involved than just one</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="4.05">little compound you can use that one</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="4.19">compound to help you immensely and then</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="5.31">of course if it&amp;#39;s natural and effective</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="5.739">it&amp;#39;s gonna be much better for you than</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="4.2">whatever tux the pharmaceutical industry</text>
  <text start="356.259" dur="7.71">wants you to put in yourself but that</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="9.599">compound has to go in hand with many</text>
  <text start="363.969" dur="7.681">other changes in your regimen healing is</text>
  <text start="367.659" dur="6.091">not one compound it&amp;#39;s a whole lifestyle</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="4.41">change you know because if you have</text>
  <text start="373.75" dur="5.4">cancer for instance you&amp;#39;re taking this</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="4.68">Rick Simpson oil for it okay maybe the</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="4.019">tumor goes away after a few months of</text>
  <text start="380.74" dur="3.57">use but if you don&amp;#39;t change any of your</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="2.461">habits if you don&amp;#39;t change your</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="4.109">lifestyle if you don&amp;#39;t change your</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="5.52">internal processes that are causing you</text>
  <text start="388.419" dur="4.461">to live the life you&amp;#39;re living that</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="4.41">disease is just gonna come back and</text>
  <text start="392.88" dur="4.899">maybe it&amp;#39;ll come back as cancer again or</text>
  <text start="395.56" dur="6.18">it could come back as something else you</text>
  <text start="397.779" dur="6.091">know disease is a systemic itch</text>
  <text start="401.74" dur="6.14">you&amp;#39;re not going to get rid of disease</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="7.71">with one thing it takes a whole holistic</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="8.05">spectrum of changes let&amp;#39;s look at that</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="8.19">word of disease dis-ease okay something</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="5.91">is going wrong within the all connected</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="4.35">systems of your body for that disease to</text>
  <text start="421.84" dur="5.49">manifest whatever the disease is but for</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="7.59">that problem that issue to manifest that</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="6.15">means that down the line you know could</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.05">be diet choices could be lifestyle</text>
  <text start="433.48" dur="3.93">habits could be your thought processes</text>
  <text start="435.76" dur="3.72">could be where you&amp;#39;re breathing in your</text>
  <text start="437.41" dur="4.59">environment or you know there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="439.48" dur="4.89">different things that go into dis-ease</text>
  <text start="442" dur="5.13">so there&amp;#39;s so many things that are gonna</text>
  <text start="444.37" dur="3.41">go into healing disease you see what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="447.13" dur="3.09">saying</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="4.75">so don&amp;#39;t let that save your sigh up</text>
  <text start="450.22" dur="4.35">catch you up with one thing to let you</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="3.81">think that&amp;#39;s gonna be the cure okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="5.76">not there&amp;#39;s a lot that goes into it this</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="6.78">is why the idea of holistic health is so</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="4.56">powerful and holistic health in general</text>
  <text start="463.12" dur="3.09">is becoming so popular because a lot of</text>
  <text start="464.89" dur="3.06">people are actually finding relief</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re finding healing with that</text>
  <text start="467.95" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re understanding that everything is</text>
  <text start="471.1" dur="6.06">connected when you say everything is</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="7.08">connected that&amp;#39;s just not a metaphysical</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="4.77">or higher consciousness way of viewing</text>
  <text start="480.13" dur="4.2">our physical universe but it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="481.93" dur="7.89">very important idea in how to view</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="8.46">yourself it&amp;#39;s a very profound archetypal</text>
  <text start="489.82" dur="4.5">understanding simply that everything is</text>
