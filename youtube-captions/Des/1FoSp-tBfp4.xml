  <text start="25.859" dur="3.51">we had an article come in to the</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="4.019">mainstream media about that so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="29.369" dur="6.151">gonna discuss that topic</text>
  <text start="31.949" dur="7.561">radio waves coming from space Harry Reid</text>
  <text start="35.52" dur="8.25">and his UFO obsession will talk that and</text>
  <text start="39.51" dur="5.729">why he wants to get back into the UFO</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="5.219">phenomenon why he&amp;#39;s talking about it and</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="5.91">then some interesting articles coming</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="4.59">out of the mainstream media in regards</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="4.8">to physics that&amp;#39;s a little later but</text>
  <text start="53.579" dur="5.311">first let&amp;#39;s start with nuke you so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="4.95">go ahead and check it out here this one</text>
  <text start="58.89" dur="4.41">let me zoom in so you can see on the</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="5.371">screen so this one here we got some new</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="5.609">booms boom boom boom good ol cue booms I</text>
  <text start="66.27" dur="4.47">like when I see those and then this next</text>
  <text start="68.909" dur="3.96">one we get a photograph and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.74" dur="5.64">photograph that I presume is from China</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="5.761">because when we read the caption cue</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="4.919">says a hwaiting VIP arrival</text>
  <text start="78.63" dur="6">what senior US official is arriving in</text>
  <text start="81.299" dur="6.031">China and what&amp;#39;s the purpose of it so in</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="4.29">decoding this I don&amp;#39;t exactly know what</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="4.17">senior US official is arriving in China</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="6.42">tried to Google various names and see</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="5.61">where they were at my best guess now</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="4.05">this is not confirmed is that it&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="4.92">guy Mathew Pottinger and the reason I</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="4.32">think it&amp;#39;s him is because he is part of</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.35">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s US National Security</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="5.159">Council he basically was the light</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="5.25">liaison between a lot of the talks that</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="5.131">were going on in early 2018 I believe</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="5.37">between China North Korea in the US but</text>
  <text start="114" dur="6.09">he is like a name that&amp;#39;s under the radar</text>
  <text start="117" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s way under the radar but he has a</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="3.48">massive impact</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="5.129">I believe this guy actually worked for</text>
  <text start="123.57" dur="4.469">general Flynn when Flynn was in</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="5.101">Afghanistan as well co-wrote a paper</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="4.981">with him so this guy is again a name</text>
  <text start="131.61" dur="2.31">that flies under the radar but he makes</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="2.37">a huge impact</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="3.33">he&amp;#39;s got a big hand in what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="135.39" dur="4.11">so might be him might be somebody else</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="3.5">but basically this photograph taken from</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="3.75">that Chinese Airport</text>
  <text start="140.75" dur="4.75">apparently wherever that VIP that very</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="5.069">important person was arriving into so</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="5.79">this photograph probably taken by Secret</text>
  <text start="148.319" dur="4.051">Service is my guess and then passed</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="3.84">along the chain</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="5.16">- whoever commandeer is queues posting</text>
  <text start="155.13" dur="3.42">on a Qian and they posted it here so I</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="6.289">think that&amp;#39;s where we get that</text>
  <text start="158.55" dur="8.55">photograph next drop queue reposts a</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="6.611">drop of theirs from the 6th of January</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="4.25">and this was the drop where they were</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="4.86">talking about</text>
  <text start="171.35" dur="5.77">RBG Ruth Ginsburg and then Q goes on to</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="4.59">say at what point is it mathematically</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="5.07">impossible the very next day meaning</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="4.95">that Q was talking about Ruth Bader</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="5.07">Ginsburg on the sixth the seventh is</text>
  <text start="184.83" dur="5.159">when we learned about Ruth Ginsburg</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="4.17">missing the Supreme Court and I think</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="3.331">it&amp;#39;s going on like the fourth or fifth</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="4.4">day that she&amp;#39;s missed now we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="4.59">about her a little bit more in a sec but</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="5.499">what point is it mathematically</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.889">impossible ie how many times do we have</text>
  <text start="201.329" dur="4.831">to get these sorts of confirmations</text>
  <text start="202.799" dur="5.371">these sorts of proofs where Q talks</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="3.51">about a topic we get news on that topic</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="5.909">the very next day or very soon</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="7.02">afterwards so obviously more proofs red</text>
  <text start="214.079" dur="5.821">castle green castle public access to</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="6.63">Intel red castle meaning the Army Corps</text>
  <text start="219.9" dur="6.24">of Engineers who are going to build the</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="4.949">wall once that national emergency yes</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="4.11">declared you know and keep saying public</text>
  <text start="228.269" dur="4.831">access to Intel meaning that since the</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="6.65">beginning of queues drops over a year</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="8.58">ago we us and ons us that follow cue</text>
  <text start="236.9" dur="7.089">decode all of what they tell us we have</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="4.23">details we have intelligence before the</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="4.741">mainstream media does before you know</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="5.37">the rest of the public do that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="5.46">follow cue and then very last drop we</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="4.47">have here q says if a woman is selected</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="2.579">as the nominee does that eliminate the</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="3.06">wrap-up smear</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="3.69">regarding sexual assault whether what</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="4.2">other tactics might be planned to block</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="3.871">and/or force name removal why is the</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="3.879">Senate important who controls the Senate</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="4.959">53 to 47</text>
  <text start="266.889" dur="4.201">when I read this my thought goes to</text>
  <text start="269.289" dur="3.63">impeachment talk why is the Senate</text>
  <text start="271.09" dur="4.319">important because with the majority</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="4.231">controlled the Senate no matter how hard</text>
  <text start="275.409" dur="3.871">the opposition of the deep state tries</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="3.419">to get Donald Trump impeached that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="2.669">going to happen if they have majority</text>
  <text start="280.569" dur="3.63">control in the Senate you need a</text>
  <text start="281.949" dur="6.96">two-thirds vote in the Senate for</text>
  <text start="284.199" dur="7.111">impeachment to proceed 5347 meaning well</text>
  <text start="288.909" dur="4.621">that&amp;#39;s another cue proof we have q</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="5.039">referencing 53 of 47 well before</text>
  <text start="293.53" dur="6.21">midterms and then after midterms what do</text>
  <text start="296.349" dur="5.37">we get in the Senate 5347 control so why</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="5.25">is it important not only for that</text>
  <text start="301.719" dur="4.92">impeachment but so many other things</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="5.179">they confirm appointments from the</text>
  <text start="306.639" dur="5.52">president all sorts of stuff so very</text>
  <text start="310.169" dur="3.581">good news that we got the Senate from</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="6.451">the midterms all right so we went over q</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="6.75">and let&amp;#39;s go into talking about RBG so</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="4.29">White House prepares for Ginsburg</text>

  <text start="341.62" dur="5.31">gonna be out very very soon</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="5.529">talking trump border security of course</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="4.979">Donald Trump was down at the border in</text>
  <text start="349.719" dur="4.17">Texas yesterday Trump highlights human</text>
  <text start="351.909" dur="4.051">trafficking as he calls for strong</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="4.171">barrier during visit to US and Mexico</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="3.989">human trafficking drug trafficking</text>
  <text start="358.06" dur="3.12">basically every time Donald Trump talks</text>
  <text start="359.949" dur="3.21">about the wall he talks about those</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="4.44">things which is fantastic putting it</text>
  <text start="363.159" dur="6.18">right there on to display and every time</text>
  <text start="365.62" dur="5.069">we hear somebody detract from the wall</text>
  <text start="369.339" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re trying to put anti wall</text>
  <text start="370.689" dur="4.79">arguments out there they never talk</text>
  <text start="373.509" dur="4.62">about trafficking they never talk about</text>
  <text start="375.479" dur="4">drug trafficking human trafficking these</text>
  <text start="378.129" dur="3.181">sorts of things they just instantly</text>
  <text start="379.479" dur="4.981">turned the narrative into something</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="4.829">completely white washy saying that</text>
  <text start="384.46" dur="3.15">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s throwing a fit that we</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="2.64">don&amp;#39;t need the wall that it&amp;#39;s a more or</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="6">whatever the case is I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="388.779" dur="8.01">but looks like that that wall is going</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="6.239">to come down to national emergency issue</text>
  <text start="396.789" dur="4.001">and what&amp;#39;s going on now is that Donald</text>
  <text start="399.849" dur="2.771">Trump is big</text>
  <text start="400.79" dur="4.17">sickly just making the opposition making</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="3.9">the deep state and all of their proxies</text>
  <text start="404.96" dur="3.21">all their little pawns in the political</text>
  <text start="406.52" dur="3.51">scene making them look as stupid as</text>
  <text start="408.17" dur="4.17">possible we had that video of Jim Acosta</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="4.23">at the wall yesterday and he was going</text>
  <text start="412.34" dur="3.87">along saying oh wow there&amp;#39;s no national</text>
  <text start="414.26" dur="4.77">emergency issue here look at this wall</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="6.15">he&amp;#39;s like hitting the steel barriers as</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="5.16">he goes past and obviously look it was</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="4.35">peaceful there because there was a wall</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="7.2">he was that was separating him from the</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="7.31">other side so he is letting the</text>
  <text start="431.39" dur="7.44">opposition make the case for him</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="8.2">essentially and this coming out of the</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="5.34">Daily Caller yesterday surprised me I</text>
  <text start="442.22" dur="4.74">think this goes hand-in-hand with the</text>
  <text start="444.17" dur="4.47">plan to get the wall erected DoD</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="3.93">inspector general reveals the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="448.64" dur="5.4">let 27 point seven billion dollars</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="6.11">expire as Trump seeks you know about</text>
  <text start="454.04" dur="5.31">five billion and border wall funding so</text>
  <text start="457" dur="6.1">this makes me think of that pentagon</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="5.25">audit the pentagon audit where if you</text>
  <text start="463.1" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t know we had the very first audit</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="5.64">of the Pentagon ever take place last</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="5.54">year fiscal year 2018 and the results of</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="3.78">that audit really haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="472" dur="3.46">publicized they haven&amp;#39;t been admitted</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="5.07">the DoD has not really said anything</text>
  <text start="475.46" dur="5.4">about it other than it is quote failed</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="3.48">they say it&amp;#39;s failed of course it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="480.86" dur="3.44">massive agency with billions or</text>
  <text start="482.57" dur="5.76">trillions of dollars they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="6.1">reconcile figure out where it&amp;#39;s gone but</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="4.26">with that audit you know since we have</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="3.93">the Alliance the white hats in power now</text>
  <text start="492.59" dur="4.88">they were able to secure control the</text>
  <text start="494.33" dur="6.11">presidency in 2016</text>
  <text start="497.47" dur="5.83">of course auditing the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="500.44" dur="4.72">basically a massive slush fund is a huge</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="3.41">task of course I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s essential</text>
  <text start="505.16" dur="4.37">to the plan and they&amp;#39;re working on</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="5.88">figuring out how the heck to disclose</text>
  <text start="509.53" dur="6.1">not only the amount of money that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="512.59" dur="5.259">miss Augusta but where it&amp;#39;s gone to and</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="4.65">of course in that audit they&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="517.849" dur="5.101">been able to figure out where there</text>
  <text start="520.28" dur="4.11">might be some funds stashed away maybe</text>
  <text start="522.95" dur="4.62">in this account over here that just got</text>
  <text start="524.39" dur="5.19">forgotten about or over here and it</text>
  <text start="527.57" dur="4.32">seems reasonable to me that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.58" dur="4.56">taking these funds that they&amp;#39;re like Oh</text>
  <text start="531.89" dur="2.82">wonderful we found this we found this we</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="2.67">found this</text>
  <text start="534.71" dur="3.57">and they&amp;#39;re strategically bringing it</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="5.79">out when they need to the</text>
  <text start="538.28" dur="7.25">inspector-general dod IG back in 2016 it</text>
  <text start="542.6" dur="6.12">was the dod IG that put out a report</text>
  <text start="545.53" dur="4.54">detailing six point five trillion and</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="3.81">miss adjustments for the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="4.71">so the dod IG is essential to all of</text>
  <text start="552.53" dur="3.65">this going on they&amp;#39;re central to the</text>
  <text start="554.78" dur="4.68">Pentagon audit and getting that</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="5.56">disclosed so with thirty billion dollars</text>
  <text start="559.46" dur="4.2">being found I&amp;#39;m sure during that audit</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="5.76">they just found this kind of tucked away</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="5.79">maybe in some back corner and they said</text>
  <text start="567.5" dur="3.54">great now we can use this money for</text>
  <text start="569.45" dur="2.61">whatever we need to when we need to you</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="3.06">know and they just have that tucked away</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="3.72">in their back pocket bringing it out now</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re saying hey we already have money</text>
  <text start="575.78" dur="4.82">for a border wall so why are all you</text>
  <text start="577.55" dur="5.07">fools in the the opposition trying to</text>
  <text start="580.6" dur="3.88">say it&amp;#39;s too expensive or what are the</text>
  <text start="582.62" dur="3.74">cases so we have five billion now it</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="4.05">looks like for a border wall easy</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="4.18">activate red castle I&amp;#39;ll get the Army</text>
  <text start="588.53" dur="4.29">Corps of Engineers to build that we got</text>

  <text start="592.82" dur="5.01">this extra money that expired chute we</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="3.84">can build a space force with that right</text>
  <text start="597.83" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m all for it five billion for the</text>

  <text start="601.85" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s only ten billion we got like</text>
  <text start="604.12" dur="6.73">seventeen billion left over what are we</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="6.12">gonna do with that chute so plenty of</text>
  <text start="610.85" dur="4.08">money there for all sorts of great</text>
  <text start="612.53" dur="3.57">things that&amp;#39;s a good idea in my opinion</text>
  <text start="614.93" dur="3.3">I would love to see the space force</text>
  <text start="616.1" dur="3.57">created with these extra funds that we</text>
  <text start="618.23" dur="4.38">know are there they just haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="4.38">utilized so there&amp;#39;s that we talked</text>
  <text start="622.61" dur="4.08">border security we talked</text>
  <text start="624.05" dur="5.58">RBG went through queue now let&amp;#39;s go on</text>
  <text start="626.69" dur="7.35">into the pole shift so this going around</text>
  <text start="629.63" dur="6.63">all sorts of mainstream media companies</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="3.81">outlets yesterday Fox News here</text>
  <text start="636.26" dur="3.06">reporting something very strange is</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="3.87">happening to Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic north pole</text>
  <text start="639.32" dur="4.11">and no one knows why of course they</text>
  <text start="641.72" dur="5.25">claim no one knows why but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="643.43" dur="6.15">connect the dots here and discuss so the</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="3.81">idea of a magnetic pole shift this is</text>
  <text start="649.58" dur="3.27">something that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="650.78" dur="4.08">for a couple years now many others have</text>
  <text start="652.85" dur="5.73">been talking about even before I learned</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="5.55">about it and the magnetic poles of our</text>
  <text start="658.58" dur="4.02">earth not just the North Pole but the</text>
  <text start="660.41" dur="3.74">South Pole is well they&amp;#39;re both moving</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re tracking and they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="664.15" dur="4.51">exponentially faster and faster you know</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="3.42">and this has been</text>
  <text start="668.66" dur="4.89">really going on since they began</text>
  <text start="670.46" dur="5.13">tracking the north pole since the early</text>
  <text start="673.55" dur="5.04">1900&amp;#39;s but what&amp;#39;s amazing is within the</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="5.34">last about 10-15 years the magnetic</text>
  <text start="678.59" dur="4.14">north and south pole are moving so much</text>
  <text start="680.93" dur="4.8">faster than ever before</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s as if within six months to a year</text>
  <text start="685.73" dur="5.01">now it&amp;#39;s moving at a rate that used to</text>
  <text start="688.43" dur="5.64">take ten to fifteen years so like I said</text>
  <text start="690.74" dur="3.99">exponential and they&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="694.07" dur="2.19">for them to flip</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="3.15">we are waiting for them to flip it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.26" dur="5.37">gonna be sort of a quantum event it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.88" dur="5.04">gonna be very quick so why is this</text>
  <text start="701.63" dur="2.73">intriguing that it&amp;#39;s hitting the</text>
  <text start="702.92" dur="2.61">mainstream media this is actually not</text>
  <text start="704.36" dur="2.52">the first time the mainstream media&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="705.53" dur="4.14">reported on this they&amp;#39;ve done so a</text>
  <text start="706.88" dur="5.1">handful of times in 2018 we&amp;#39;ll get an</text>

  <text start="714.05" dur="3.33">intriguing about this to me is that</text>
  <text start="715.4" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re reporting on this and Fox News</text>
  <text start="717.38" dur="4.11">and everywhere else and this is after</text>
  <text start="719.48" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of information start</text>
  <text start="721.49" dur="5.94">blowing up in the underground circuit</text>
  <text start="723.53" dur="5.79">about the pole shift so first we have</text>

  <text start="802.339" dur="4.62">maybe not just a magnetic pole shift but</text>
  <text start="804.05" dur="4.229">could be geophysical as well and many</text>

  <text start="1171.73" dur="6.75">physics okay</text>
  <text start="1173.88" dur="6.549">this sort of shocked me actually I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1178.48" dur="3.72">honest it kind of shocked me what they</text>
  <text start="1180.429" dur="4.62">began talking about in this article it</text>
  <text start="1182.2" dur="5.09">came out just yesterday on the 10th</text>
  <text start="1185.049" dur="6.081">they are literally talking about</text>
  <text start="1187.29" dur="5.59">electrostatic forces repelling things</text>
  <text start="1191.13" dur="2.08">they&amp;#39;re talking about what&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="1192.88" dur="2.22">cool</text>
  <text start="1193.21" dur="7.59">force it&amp;#39;s an interaction between any</text>
  <text start="1195.1" dur="9.59">two electric charges and it essentially</text>
  <text start="1200.8" dur="5.85">is an attractive and a repulsive force</text>
  <text start="1204.69" dur="5.23">I&amp;#39;m not going to read the whole article</text>
  <text start="1206.65" dur="6.42">but you can see here in the videos</text>
  <text start="1209.92" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re playing they&amp;#39;re showing the</text>
  <text start="1213.07" dur="5.55">Coulomb force in action it has a</text>
  <text start="1214.33" dur="6.18">retraction and then a repulsion you know</text>
  <text start="1218.62" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re showing very basic tabletop</text>
  <text start="1220.51" dur="7.5">experiments here showing a couple bigger</text>
  <text start="1223.93" dur="7.92">ones they&amp;#39;re showing how even you can</text>
  <text start="1228.01" dur="4.98">make a wand where you can repel things</text>
  <text start="1231.85" dur="5.7">with the Coulomb force with this</text>
  <text start="1232.99" dur="8.55">electrostatic force and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1237.55" dur="6.93">intriguing now look into the research of</text>
  <text start="1241.54" dur="6.23">T Townsend Brown t Townsend Brown back</text>
  <text start="1244.48" dur="7.53">in the 1940s and 50s was making large</text>
  <text start="1247.77" dur="6.85">metal disks levitate and propel</text>
  <text start="1252.01" dur="4.95">themselves with electrostatic high</text>
  <text start="1254.62" dur="4.2">voltage electrostatic charges so it</text>
  <text start="1256.96" dur="4.56">wasn&amp;#39;t using the electrons from your</text>
  <text start="1258.82" dur="5.67">hand in a PVC pipe to repel some</text>
  <text start="1261.52" dur="6">aluminum he was using a lot of volts</text>
  <text start="1264.49" dur="4.92">pumped into metal discs really any</text>
  <text start="1267.52" dur="5.19">crystalline material will work his discs</text>
  <text start="1269.41" dur="6.54">for metal and he boom big discs going</text>
  <text start="1272.71" dur="4.98">couple hundred miles an hour so back to</text>
  <text start="1275.95" dur="3.42">this article a magic wand nope just good</text>
  <text start="1277.69" dur="5.58">old-fashioned physics they&amp;#39;re literally</text>
  <text start="1279.37" dur="5.97">putting we could call it very basic very</text>
  <text start="1283.27" dur="4.05">very basic black project research out</text>
  <text start="1285.34" dur="3.96">into the public domain this is sort of</text>
  <text start="1287.32" dur="3.42">disclosure that&amp;#39;s going on bit by bit</text>
  <text start="1289.3" dur="2.7">piece by piece you know they&amp;#39;re seeding</text>
  <text start="1290.74" dur="3.24">the public&amp;#39;s consciousness they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1292" dur="4.26">talking about how electricity which of</text>
  <text start="1293.98" dur="5.85">course is everywhere we live in an</text>
  <text start="1296.26" dur="7.08">electric universe and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1299.83" dur="6">how electricity can repel things is</text>
  <text start="1303.34" dur="4.62">essentially electrogravitics right I was</text>
  <text start="1305.83" dur="3.99">just amazed when I saw this it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1307.96" dur="5.22">doing it they are bit by a bit article</text>
  <text start="1309.82" dur="5.43">by article putting out disclosure</text>
  <text start="1313.18" dur="4.89">disclosure information it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="1315.25" dur="4.95">and last article I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1318.07" dur="5.1">you get talk to you guys about is this</text>
  <text start="1320.2" dur="6.65">good old flat earth I can already feel</text>
  <text start="1323.17" dur="6.72">the dislikes on this video begin to rise</text>
  <text start="1326.85" dur="4.96">the shills coming into the comments all</text>
  <text start="1329.89" dur="4.32">aboard the Flat Earth cruise just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1331.81" dur="4.62">tell them about nautical navigation</text>
  <text start="1334.21" dur="4.41">where those flat earthers gonna do when</text>
  <text start="1336.43" dur="6.15">the poles shift right oh god the poles</text>
  <text start="1338.62" dur="7.77">flipped around a rounded earth but</text>
  <text start="1342.58" dur="6.41">anyway so apparently there&amp;#39;s this Flat</text>
  <text start="1346.39" dur="5.34">Earth conference this group that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1348.99" dur="4.87">planning a cruise and they&amp;#39;re planning a</text>
  <text start="1351.73" dur="5.6">cruise for a Flat Earth conference and</text>
  <text start="1353.86" dur="6.18">then this article goes on to state well</text>
  <text start="1357.33" dur="6.04">cruises navigation systems their GPS</text>
  <text start="1360.04" dur="5.04">works with spherical Earth&amp;#39;s so they go</text>
  <text start="1363.37" dur="3.48">on to discredit Flat Earth and do all</text>
  <text start="1365.08" dur="4.14">that and the point I want to make here</text>
  <text start="1366.85" dur="5.1">about the Flat Earth SIOP is that you</text>
  <text start="1369.22" dur="5.22">have a lot of psyops specifically</text>
  <text start="1371.95" dur="4.44">created by the deep state so they can</text>
  <text start="1374.44" dur="6.98">run with it in the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="1376.39" dur="5.03">then use it to marginalize use it to</text>
  <text start="1382.53" dur="4.96">discredit all conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="1385.84" dur="3.69">because in the mainstream media they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1387.49" dur="4.14">say wow conspiracy theorists believe</text>
  <text start="1389.53" dur="4.02">this thing everything else they must</text>
  <text start="1391.63" dur="4.56">believe and look into must be ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1393.55" dur="4.77">right that&amp;#39;s exactly their modus</text>
  <text start="1396.19" dur="5.04">operandi here so with the Flat Earth</text>
  <text start="1398.32" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s just absolute nonsense it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1401.23" dur="6.45">absolute nonsense unfortunately some</text>
  <text start="1404.5" dur="5.99">people still believe in it and the</text>
  <text start="1407.68" dur="5.79">mainstream media they can very easily</text>
  <text start="1410.49" dur="5.11">discredit throw shade on true seekers</text>
  <text start="1413.47" dur="4.53">with something like Flat Earth theory</text>
  <text start="1415.6" dur="4.17">again with something like JFK jr. being</text>
  <text start="1418" dur="4.71">alive a lot of people are running with</text>
  <text start="1419.77" dur="4.5">that very easy ammunition for the</text>
  <text start="1422.71" dur="5.07">mainstream media for the opposition to</text>
  <text start="1424.27" dur="5.22">use to discredit communities true</text>
  <text start="1427.78" dur="4.34">seekers conspiracy theorists if you want</text>
  <text start="1429.49" dur="5.55">to call it that discredit them with ok</text>
  <text start="1432.12" dur="5.14">moon landings are fake another good one</text>
  <text start="1435.04" dur="3.9">this is why you see Flat Earth and the</text>
  <text start="1437.26" dur="3.75">moon landings are fake you see so much</text>
  <text start="1438.94" dur="2.52">of that Shiller II promoted on the</text>
  <text start="1441.01" dur="1.92">Internet</text>
  <text start="1441.46" dur="3.42">how many YouTube comments do you see</text>
  <text start="1442.93" dur="4.2">from flat earthers moon landing is fake</text>
  <text start="1444.88" dur="5.01">JFK jr. is alive</text>
  <text start="1447.13" dur="4.29">how many bought accounts do you see go</text>
  <text start="1449.89" dur="4.08">into Twitter threads and try to comment</text>
  <text start="1451.42" dur="6.09">that it&amp;#39;s like there are multiple stages</text>
  <text start="1453.97" dur="5.22">of this SIOP and play here they use</text>
  <text start="1457.51" dur="3.149">YouTube commenters and shills on the</text>
  <text start="1459.19" dur="3.989">internet and the mainstream media just</text>
