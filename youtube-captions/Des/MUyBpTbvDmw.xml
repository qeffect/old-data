  <text start="23.04" dur="5.969">business is on the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="26.04" dur="6.199">and his health care policies because</text>
  <text start="29.009" dur="5.281">what I do every single day is I go to</text>
  <text start="32.239" dur="4.631">CNN&amp;#39;s website</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="5.55">sometimes Washington Post CBS news</text>
  <text start="36.87" dur="5.759">sometimes NBC basically what I do is hop</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="5.039">on all of the corporate propaganda media</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="3.75">websites and see what kind of crap</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="5.851">they&amp;#39;re trying to fill our brains with</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="6.291">today and the topic of the day that</text>
  <text start="50.73" dur="4.859">they&amp;#39;re trying to attack Trump with is</text>
  <text start="52.67" dur="4.9">health care they always have right</text>
  <text start="55.589" dur="3.301">different topics they try and use first</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="3">it was like the immigration thing then</text>

  <text start="61.92" dur="5.58">to use and today it&amp;#39;s the health care</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="5.58">topic and what a lot of these mainstream</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="2.7">sources were saying right I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="69" dur="3.87">if you guys have ever seen those videos</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="4.77">of like all the local news anchors let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.87" dur="4.47">say the exact same thing the same</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="4.079">soundbite that they get from their their</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="3.72">corporate masters it&amp;#39;s really funny and</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="3.901">all of these mainstream articles today</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="5.129">had the same soundbite and their</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="6.51">specific soundbite was that Trump Trump</text>
  <text start="86.189" dur="5.551">care is gonna cost the economy a bunch</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="5.04">of money and it&amp;#39;s gonna lose people a</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="4.589">bunch of health care now I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="94.5" dur="3.96">looked too deep into all the stuff</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="5.58">regarding Trump care but I get the</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="4.92">feeling in me that that&amp;#39;s complete BS</text>
  <text start="101.909" dur="4.261">that they&amp;#39;re saying and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="4.379">interesting to note is this Trump</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="3.9">administration what they did yesterday</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="4.621">has actually held a listening session on</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="3.18">their Trump care and uploaded it right</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="4.739">to YouTube</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="6">BAM transparency right here it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="4.051">interesting that this administration is</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="5.21">so much more transparent than any of the</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="5.759">other presidencies of the past and</text>
  <text start="124.46" dur="7.54">because really they&amp;#39;re going up against</text>
  <text start="126.929" dur="9.001">this whole beast of propaganda with the</text>
  <text start="132" dur="5.37">corporate media and what he was doing in</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="3.45">this listening session is asking people</text>
  <text start="137.37" dur="3.78">their experiences and they were like oh</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="3.48">my gosh it cost me so much freaking</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="4.08">money and oh my gosh my health care</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="4.14">worse you know my gosh like everything</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="3.63">complete opposite and I&amp;#39;ve worked in</text>
  <text start="147" dur="3.6">private private practice I work for a</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="4.23">chiropractic clinic and trust me</text>
  <text start="150.6" dur="4.17">Obamacare sucked cost people I don&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="3.72">costs people way more money right for</text>
  <text start="154.77" dur="4.44">their premiums so I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="5.76">know how people having way more money to</text>
  <text start="159.21" dur="5.04">spend would harm the economy and their</text>
  <text start="162.57" dur="3.93">health care so many people actually</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="4.23">couldn&amp;#39;t even afford the premiums so</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="3.93">they didn&amp;#39;t have health care period so I</text>
  <text start="168.48" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t know how repealing Obamacare would</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="4.56">lose people health care insurance if it</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="5.04">becomes cheaper logic so anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.99" dur="5.19">what I wanted to say in regards to that</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="5.16">and also I came across a article</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="4.14">yesterday from ScienceDirect that I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="5.94">linked down below that would that said</text>
  <text start="184.32" dur="6.23">the vaccine autism study is one of the</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="5.76">main components of this Trump care</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="6.52">overhaul and of these budget cuts so</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="5.16">that right there lets me you know gives</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="4.58">me a good feeling in my heart Trump</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="6.51">knows about vaccines he wants to expose</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="5.05">the corruption regarding that and this</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="3.09">is one of the reasons why the corporate</text>
  <text start="206.7" dur="3.15">media and the American Medical</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="4.34">Association of the American Mafia</text>
  <text start="209.85" dur="6.03">Association is so anti Trump care and</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="5.2">trying to pull their strings of BS to</text>
  <text start="215.88" dur="5.16">try to get people to not like it is</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="8.789">because of that so that&amp;#39;s awesome anyway</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="9.69">moving on to David Wilcock obviously</text>
  <text start="226.709" dur="6.301">dropped his Atlanta lecture a couple</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.8">days ago on his YouTube and I did a</text>
  <text start="233.01" dur="4.32">quick video yesterday just telling you</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="3.69">which I&amp;#39;ll repeat real quick right now</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="4.86">be aware of all the disinformation</text>
  <text start="239.22" dur="6.57">there&amp;#39;s so much dis and misinformation</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="5.04">coming out regarding the whole Antarctic</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="4.5">thing and it&amp;#39;s really ramping up I got a</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="4.53">lot of like trolli comments and the</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="2.699">dissing misinformation are really gonna</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="4.08">start ramping up so that&amp;#39;s just what I</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="5.581">wanted you to be aware about Corey good</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="5.51">also tweeted a little thing where he</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="6.54">said we&amp;#39;re really not gonna get the full</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="6.31">data dumps as we all know at least I</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="6.42">want all at once they&amp;#39;re really gonna be</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="5.7">strategic data dumps and this you know</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="3.569">covert war they said is really gonna</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="2.97">start turning into an overt war quite</text>
  <text start="275.099" dur="3.481">soon so it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="4.19">it&amp;#39;s over at war at least to me and</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="4.92">probably people who watch my channel but</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="4.899">so unfortunately probably not a full</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="3.539">disclosure as we still want but it will</text>
  <text start="285.419" dur="3.661">be some type of partial leading up to</text>
  <text start="287.039" dur="6.211">bigger things but keep in mind the more</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="5.79">that you and I wake people up and the</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="4.139">more we talk about what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="4.049">on the more likelihood that that full</text>
  <text start="297.389" dur="4.77">disclosure that breakthrough is going to</text>
  <text start="298.919" dur="5.25">happen so that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to tell</text>
  <text start="302.159" dur="3.871">you guys about and then lastly what I</text>
  <text start="304.169" dur="4.441">saw just a few hours ago was that</text>
  <text start="306.03" dur="9.03">natural news the natural news Facebook</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="8.76">page reposted a work from dr. Steven</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="5.069">Greer which is actually pretty freaking</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="5.099">cool to see it had like hundreds of</text>
  <text start="320.129" dur="3.63">shares and hundreds if not thousands of</text>
  <text start="322.469" dur="4.531">likes and a lot of people commenting it</text>
  <text start="323.759" dur="5.491">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that UFO</text>
  <text start="327" dur="3.9">disclosure information is starting to</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="3.15">reach I don&amp;#39;t want to say mainstream</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="3.359">because obviously national news is not a</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="4.289">mainstream organizations a organization</text>
  <text start="334.259" dur="4.831">per se but it&amp;#39;s one of those outlets</text>
  <text start="336.689" dur="4.831">that are far more known than a lot of</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.77">others so we have UFO disclosure</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="4.41">information really reaching much larger</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="4.14">of an audience and this is only going to</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="4.44">happen faster because on David Wilcock</text>
