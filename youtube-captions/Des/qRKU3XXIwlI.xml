  <text start="594.36" dur="5.34">out the window we need some serious</text>
  <text start="596.13" dur="5.4">relearning in this society a couple more</text>
  <text start="599.7" dur="4.41">articles I have here this one UFO</text>
  <text start="601.53" dur="4.74">sighting in Texas keller resident</text>
  <text start="604.11" dur="5.49">records mysterious quote cigar shaped</text>
  <text start="606.27" dur="6.45">object in the sky and this looks real to</text>
  <text start="609.6" dur="6.21">me cigar shaped object luminous right</text>
  <text start="612.72" dur="5.58">there in the sky what i think personally</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="4.5">now first of all anytime you see any</text>
  <text start="618.3" dur="3.6">sort of UFO sighting or you see an</text>
  <text start="620.31" dur="3.18">anomalous craft in the sky where you</text>
  <text start="621.9" dur="5.73">know what is it what it is it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="623.49" dur="6.74">plane always think ours are theirs</text>
  <text start="627.63" dur="5.42">could be a man-made black project</text>
  <text start="630.23" dur="4.6">electrogravitic craft or it could be an</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="3.1">extraterrestrial craft some kind of</text>
  <text start="634.83" dur="3.6">extraterrestrial craft you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="636.15" dur="4.59">various kinds and sorts that we could</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="4.56">talk about but ours are theirs ask</text>
  <text start="640.74" dur="4.32">yourself that this one I would</text>
  <text start="642.99" dur="2.64">personally think this to possibly be</text>
  <text start="645.06" dur="3.3">ours</text>
  <text start="645.63" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s cigar shaped and if you look into</text>
  <text start="648.36" dur="4.23">the naval secret space programs</text>
  <text start="650.67" dur="5.64">primarily solar warden it&amp;#39;s been said</text>
  <text start="652.59" dur="7.32">that the Navy has black project cigar</text>
  <text start="656.31" dur="4.98">shaped electrogravitic craft so this</text>
  <text start="659.91" dur="3.69">could be one of ours being shown in the</text>
  <text start="661.29" dur="5.43">sky could be one of their still you know</text>
  <text start="663.6" dur="4.67">cigar shaped et vehicle but it could be</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="5.77">one of ours</text>
  <text start="668.27" dur="9.48">some sort of covert military craft now</text>
  <text start="672.49" dur="8.29">this goes to say you know the men behind</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="4.5">the scenes those within those black</text>
  <text start="680.78" dur="3.27">projects that have access to these</text>
  <text start="682.25" dur="4.05">technologies I would imagine that many</text>
  <text start="684.05" dur="5.13">of them are sick of the cabal&amp;#39;s lies</text>
  <text start="686.3" dur="4.62">just like a lot of those folks on the QT</text>
  <text start="689.18" dur="4.98">Mar you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of these</text>
  <text start="690.92" dur="5.1">factions cells of this umbrella term</text>
  <text start="694.16" dur="3.78">that we call the Alliance behind the</text>
  <text start="696.02" dur="4.38">scenes and they want disclosure of</text>
  <text start="697.94" dur="4.29">course cue is working towards various</text>
  <text start="700.4" dur="4.05">disclosures and the political spectrum</text>
  <text start="702.23" dur="6.21">within the FBI DOJ and whatnot but</text>
  <text start="704.45" dur="5.61">you&amp;#39;ve gotta connect the dots and just</text>
  <text start="708.44" dur="4.29">logically deduce that there&amp;#39;s got to be</text>
  <text start="710.06" dur="4.95">some white hats some guys behind the</text>
  <text start="712.73" dur="4.23">scenes that are within maybe more so the</text>
  <text start="715.01" dur="4.2">Navy or the Air Force their space</text>
  <text start="716.96" dur="4.59">operations where they want to disclose</text>
  <text start="719.21" dur="3.99">what they have access to right it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="721.55" dur="3.63">to be the case so I would imagine that</text>
  <text start="723.2" dur="3.99">many of these sightings that we see that</text>
  <text start="725.18" dur="3.62">are are craft they might be showing on</text>
  <text start="727.19" dur="4.68">purpose you know they might be</text>
  <text start="728.8" dur="5.08">purposefully materializing these crafts</text>
  <text start="731.87" dur="3.21">in the sky taking them out of their deep</text>
  <text start="733.88" dur="2.91">underground military bases where they</text>
  <text start="735.08" dur="3.75">keep them right materializing these</text>
  <text start="736.79" dur="3.54">things in the sky and showing them over</text>
  <text start="738.83" dur="3.33">the populace to purposely get a</text>
  <text start="740.33" dur="3.96">photograph so this stuff can start</text>
  <text start="742.16" dur="4.17">getting into the public domain you know</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="3.57">you got to think of these sorts of</text>
  <text start="746.33" dur="3.54">things so they got to disclose it in a</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="3.39">very easy way showing their craft like</text>
  <text start="749.87" dur="3.6">this could be a way where they get</text>
  <text start="751.25" dur="4.65">sightings every so often acclimate the</text>
  <text start="753.47" dur="4.08">public very slowly and then as time goes</text>
  <text start="755.9" dur="3.54">on as the public becomes more aware more</text>
  <text start="757.55" dur="3.63">ready they can start showing their</text>
  <text start="759.44" dur="4.29">crafts and heck maybe one day when the</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="4.26">deep state gets rounded up you know then</text>
  <text start="763.73" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re able to bring this stuff out to</text>
  <text start="765.44" dur="3.99">the public and actually do the full</text>
  <text start="767.39" dur="3.66">disclosure that we all want so those are</text>
  <text start="769.43" dur="3.75">just some thoughts for you guys take it</text>
  <text start="771.05" dur="4.2">or leave it and one last thing sort of</text>
  <text start="773.18" dur="3.81">on the same subject talking about secret</text>
  <text start="775.25" dur="3.81">technologies in the Air Force Navy and</text>
  <text start="776.99" dur="4.32">whatnot found this article come out of</text>
  <text start="779.06" dur="4.56">national interest org but it said</text>
  <text start="781.31" dur="5.58">imagine this Air Force f-35 stealth</text>
  <text start="783.62" dur="5.88">fighters armed with lasers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="786.89" dur="5.67">saying it could happen here&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="789.5" dur="7.7">saying it already has happened and my</text>
  <text start="792.56" dur="6.96">guess is that actually my guess is that</text>
  <text start="797.2" dur="4.12">Donald Trump and those white hats I</text>
  <text start="799.52" dur="2.41">would imagine there&amp;#39;s probably been some</text>
  <text start="801.32" dur="3.07">me</text>
  <text start="801.93" dur="5.19">that they&amp;#39;ve had at some point where</text>
  <text start="804.39" dur="5.4">Donald Trump sits down crosses his arms</text>
  <text start="807.12" dur="4.95">and just goes you guys are gonna have to</text>
  <text start="809.79" dur="3.42">start disclosing the secret stuff or</text>
  <text start="812.07" dur="3.6">else you&amp;#39;re not gonna get the good</text>
  <text start="813.21" dur="4.83">military contracts you know Wieland deal</text>
  <text start="815.67" dur="5.37">like he does and that&amp;#39;s his deal to get</text>
  <text start="818.04" dur="4.2">those elements within the Air Force and</text>
  <text start="821.04" dur="2.82">the corporate contractors that have been</text>
  <text start="822.24" dur="4.49">covering up these technologies for a</text>
  <text start="823.86" dur="6.539">long long time they&amp;#39;ve had laser</text>
  <text start="826.73" dur="5.38">directed energy weapons for decades you</text>
  <text start="830.399" dur="3">know and that&amp;#39;s in the public domain</text>
  <text start="832.11" dur="3.66">everything we&amp;#39;ve seen on the public</text>
  <text start="833.399" dur="4.081">domain is a drop in the bucket compared</text>
  <text start="835.77" dur="3.6">to what&amp;#39;s really out there you know they</text>
  <text start="837.48" dur="5.549">have stuff that&amp;#39;s far beyond lasers</text>
  <text start="839.37" dur="5.43">within quasi-military corporate Air</text>
  <text start="843.029" dur="5.191">Force Navy corporate contractor project</text>
  <text start="844.8" dur="5.07">so I would imagine that the Air Force</text>
  <text start="848.22" dur="4.35">and Lockheed and Boeing and whatnot</text>
  <text start="849.87" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re starting to roll out many of</text>
  <text start="852.57" dur="3.42">these disclosures much like I was just</text>
  <text start="854.67" dur="4.5">talking about in the way of showing</text>
  <text start="855.99" dur="5.099">their craft even feeding bits of</text>
  <text start="859.17" dur="4.26">information like this to the media you</text>
  <text start="861.089" dur="4.431">know running little articles here and</text>
  <text start="863.43" dur="4.65">there talking about the technologies</text>
  <text start="865.52" dur="4.569">start rolling out the technologies at a</text>
  <text start="868.08" dur="5.129">bit faster of a rate into the public and</text>
  <text start="870.089" dur="6.451">then the sciences and they tech they do</text>
  <text start="873.209" dur="6.361">talk about starts getting you know more</text>
  <text start="876.54" dur="5.22">and more deep more and more wondrous and</text>
  <text start="879.57" dur="3.389">mind-blowing but just them disclosing</text>
  <text start="881.76" dur="4.31">what they&amp;#39;ve been working on for a long</text>
  <text start="882.959" dur="5.281">long time so this is something we are</text>
  <text start="886.07" dur="5.04">waiting for with full disclosure you</text>
  <text start="888.24" dur="4.95">know this Great Awakening is not just a</text>
  <text start="891.11" dur="4.3">little bit of corruption in the FBI and</text>
  <text start="893.19" dur="4.95">DOJ it&amp;#39;s not just 60,000 sealed</text>
  <text start="895.41" dur="7.11">indictments it&amp;#39;s not just the CIA</text>
  <text start="898.14" dur="7.11">getting dismantled and repurposed but it</text>
  <text start="902.52" dur="5.37">is the disclosure of man we&amp;#39;re of those</text>
  <text start="905.25" dur="5.22">trillions of dollars in Pentagon money</text>
  <text start="907.89" dur="3.63">gone what sciences and technologies have</text>
  <text start="910.47" dur="3.09">been hidden from the public first</text>
  <text start="911.52" dur="3.689">century what about this breakaway</text>
  <text start="913.56" dur="3.69">civilization what do they actually have</text>
  <text start="915.209" dur="3.721">it goes far beyond lasers goes far</text>
  <text start="917.25" dur="3.029">beyond CERN I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of people</text>
  <text start="918.93" dur="3.149">talk about certainly we have more</text>
  <text start="920.279" dur="6.81">thoughts on that later goes far beyond</text>
