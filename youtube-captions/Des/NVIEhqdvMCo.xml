  <text start="8.51" dur="3.549">what&amp;#39;s going on guys so what I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="10.59" dur="3.12">to attempt to do in this video is</text>
  <text start="12.059" dur="4.32">discuss with you what&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="13.71" dur="5.94">reciprocal Systems Theory of Dewey B</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="5.881">Larsen and it&amp;#39;s super interesting stuff</text>
  <text start="19.65" dur="5.85">because it really helps to theoretically</text>
  <text start="22.26" dur="6.63">explain exactly how free energy systems</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="6.869">can create energy out of nothing and how</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="8.04">things like anti-gravity and time-travel</text>
  <text start="32.369" dur="7.951">all work but the reason I say attempt to</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="6.36">discuss is because this can get to be a</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="6.03">very complicated subject if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="5.249">coming at this with the understanding of</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="4.799">conventional science because let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="48.539" dur="5.371">real conventional science these days is</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="5.461">just bad foundations built upon bad</text>
  <text start="53.91" dur="5.28">theories built upon a bunch of confusion</text>
  <text start="56.61" dur="4.499">right and all of these scientists are</text>
  <text start="59.19" dur="4.74">trying to find their unified field</text>
  <text start="61.109" dur="4.44">theory but since they have all these bad</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="3.36">foundations that they&amp;#39;re trying to work</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="5.881">through it&amp;#39;s very difficult for them and</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="6.3">the cool thing about this theory is what</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="7.049">this guy right here did do we deal arson</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="8.58">now Dewey B Larson was a scientist in</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="5.791">the mid-1950s who was really into almost</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="4.14">everything he was in engineering he was</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="6.68">into cosmology in physics and chemistry</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="7.349">so what he did is he basically admitted</text>
  <text start="90.95" dur="5.68">as a keyword there admitted that there</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="4.561">was so many little pieces wrong in</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="4.26">conventional science so he took a step</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="4.829">back and he tried to piece it all</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="6.42">together and he came pretty darn close</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="6.93">to a a working unified field theory and</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;m going to try to explain that to you</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="3.331">guys and here&amp;#39;s the cool thing as well</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="3.509">is that you know as I&amp;#39;m doing these</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="6.059">YouTube videos I&amp;#39;m basically like</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="5.85">vlogging my research so I&amp;#39;m not claiming</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="3.271">to understand exactly how all of this</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="3.841">works I&amp;#39;m still working to piece it</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="4.5">together but I just want to simply offer</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="3.83">it to you guys isn&amp;#39;t that you know as I</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.289">do more videos on this stuff</text>
  <text start="128.75" dur="3.27">and a whole lot of other subjects it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="2.941">just gonna get more and more refine so</text>
  <text start="132.02" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s really fun stuff but</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="5.4">anyway let&amp;#39;s get into do me be Larsen&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.7" dur="5.16">physics now funny enough as well do we</text>
  <text start="138.77" dur="5.25">be Larsson he was actually the roommate</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="3.93">in like best friends with the Nobel</text>
  <text start="144.02" dur="4.01">Prize winner Linus Pauling when they</text>
  <text start="145.79" dur="5.76">both went to Oregon State University so</text>
  <text start="148.03" dur="7.23">he is in some pretty good company of the</text>
  <text start="151.55" dur="6.72">brains that he was acquainted with so</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="4.84">extremely intelligent guy and when he</text>
  <text start="158.27" dur="6">took a step back and he started piecing</text>
  <text start="160.1" dur="7.5">together a theoretical unified field</text>
  <text start="164.27" dur="5.49">theory of physics this is essentially</text>
  <text start="167.6" dur="4.65">the postulate that he came towards and</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="5.13">this is the name of one of his primary</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="5.16">books explaining his theories and that</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="5.37">is nothing but emotion and one of his</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="4.44">primary postulates was that motion is</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.699">what makes up the universe it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="181.85" dur="7.91">actually matter is if you think of our</text>
  <text start="184.959" dur="8.321">material world is you know everything is</text>
  <text start="189.76" dur="5.53">99.99999% empty space I&amp;#39;m touching this</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="3.51">white board here but all of these tiny</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="3.09">little atoms with their particles</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="6.36">flowing around it is pretty much just</text>
  <text start="198.38" dur="7.44">all vacuuming and bringing that back up</text>
  <text start="203.15" dur="5.369">to here when you think of everything</text>
  <text start="205.82" dur="5.91">being motion it kind of makes sense</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="5.401">because not only are we moving through</text>
  <text start="211.73" dur="4.5">time right now but we&amp;#39;re also moving</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="4.08">through space we&amp;#39;re moving through space</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="3.45">constantly and that&amp;#39;s never going to</text>
  <text start="218" dur="3.75">change and it&amp;#39;s always been that way</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="4.83">because we have our earth that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.75" dur="6.239">rotating that&amp;#39;s spinning around our star</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="4.979">this star is spinning around you know</text>
  <text start="227.989" dur="2.941">another star which is spinning through</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="3.541">our galaxy which is spinning around our</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="3.809">universe and that&amp;#39;s the way it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="4.32">been though is the way it&amp;#39;s always gonna</text>
  <text start="234.739" dur="6.961">be so it&amp;#39;s motion that makes up</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="8.15">everything motion is space-time remember</text>
  <text start="241.7" dur="5.819">space-time is that stuff that quantum</text>
  <text start="245.5" dur="4.12">scientists are kind of scratching their</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="5.22">head up these days trying to piece</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="6.3">together well space-time is motion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.739" dur="5.671">the same thing and you can then boil it</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="5.76">down to different equations based upon</text>
  <text start="258.41" dur="6.21">this idea of motion speed is simply</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="5.34">face over time you&amp;#39;re you know dividing</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="4.5">an amount of space you move by the</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="5.01">amount of time it took you to do that in</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="5.97">that speed you have energy which is time</text>
  <text start="272.03" dur="5.55">over space you have acceleration with</text>
  <text start="275.09" dur="5.51">just space over x squared and then it</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="6.54">just goes on all you do is mess with the</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="6.97">integers that you&amp;#39;re powering it to and</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;ll get you different physical</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="5.689">equations so that&amp;#39;s pretty much it I</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="6.239">mean when it comes down to like testing</text>
  <text start="293.259" dur="5.5">the memorizing these equations become so</text>
  <text start="296.509" dur="3.571">much easier than many of the equations</text>
  <text start="298.759" dur="3.63">that science is doing these days</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="6.089">and that&amp;#39;s a big interesting point is</text>
  <text start="302.389" dur="6.12">that science is so complicated these</text>
  <text start="306.169" dur="5.101">days because of the fact that they have</text>
  <text start="308.509" dur="4.38">you know very questionable foundations</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="3.269">all built upon each other so then they</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="4.891">have to you know create these new</text>
  <text start="314.539" dur="4.621">mathematic formulas and problems to talk</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="3">about this over here but then that</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="3.629">leaves all this questionable stuff over</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="4.229">here that they make new formula for so</text>
  <text start="322.789" dur="5.281">it all just gets so confusing but again</text>
  <text start="325.009" dur="5.521">if you unlearn all of the weird stuff</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="5.879">that&amp;#39;s thrown at us and begin to build</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="7.08">back your thought processes upon that it</text>
  <text start="333.949" dur="6.181">becomes pretty simple and then let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="4.26">into space of time and the reason he</text>
  <text start="340.13" dur="3.3">calls it the reciprocal systems theory</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="3.81">is because space and time are</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="4.109">reciprocals and I have the yin-yang</text>
  <text start="345.68" dur="7.14">symbol drawn up here because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.539" dur="7.711">basically how a Dewey B Larson saw it</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="4.8">and it&amp;#39;s so I mean again it&amp;#39;s so simple</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="4.68">but it&amp;#39;s so profound and that all we</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="4.35">have is just two polar opposites and</text>
  <text start="359.93" dur="4.59">they work with each other to create</text>
  <text start="361.97" dur="5.129">essentially a unified field and that</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="6.54">those two opposites are space and time</text>
  <text start="367.099" dur="6.181">so right now you and I are residing in</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="6.96">what&amp;#39;s called the material sector or</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="9.359">space over time so this material sector</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="8.519">that we reside in is can also be known</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="6.181">as slower than light motion because you</text>
  <text start="386.539" dur="3.841">and I are the material the matter</text>
  <text start="388.82" dur="5.58">essentially that we&amp;#39;re made up of is</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="4.899">moving slower than light so this is why</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="3.879">we was</text>
  <text start="395.279" dur="4.95">and what&amp;#39;s in three-dimensional space in</text>
  <text start="398.279" dur="4.17">one dimensional time so think of it you</text>
  <text start="400.229" dur="4.83">know we have three dimensions left right</text>
  <text start="402.449" dur="6.47">up down forward back in time it is fixed</text>
  <text start="405.059" dur="8.19">so in the cop in the material sector</text>
  <text start="408.919" dur="6.55">time is the fixed the fixed reciprocal</text>
  <text start="413.249" dur="6.45">because time just goes one direction</text>
  <text start="415.469" dur="7.32">what dimension and time is flowing in</text>
  <text start="419.699" dur="5.57">space moves so you can move in space but</text>
  <text start="422.789" dur="6.45">time is the only thing that&amp;#39;s linear</text>
  <text start="425.269" dur="6.73">then the reciprocal of space and time is</text>
  <text start="429.239" dur="4.77">time and space so this is when you get</text>
  <text start="431.999" dur="5.64">into the cot what&amp;#39;s called the cosmic</text>
  <text start="434.009" dur="5.87">sector or faster than like motion and</text>
  <text start="437.639" dur="6.51">what do we be Larson says is that</text>
  <text start="439.879" dur="7.63">Lightspeed is the base unit so what he</text>
  <text start="444.149" dur="6.03">says is Lightspeed is one one is like</text>
  <text start="447.509" dur="4.47">speed when you&amp;#39;re below that that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="450.179" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re again in the material sector and</text>
  <text start="451.979" dur="5.79">stuff is right material when you move</text>
  <text start="455.189" dur="4.08">past the speed of light that&amp;#39;s when you</text>
  <text start="457.769" dur="5.67">enter the cosmic sector and you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="459.269" dur="6.75">time-space this is when again everything</text>
  <text start="463.439" dur="5.55">flips everything reciprocates so you</text>
  <text start="466.019" dur="6.21">then get into time being three</text>
  <text start="468.989" dur="6.03">dimensions in space having one dimension</text>
  <text start="472.229" dur="5.01">okay again this is very these are very</text>
  <text start="475.019" dur="3.841">abstract concepts and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="477.239" dur="4.74">difficult to kind of piece your mind</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="4.949">around at first but as you kind of start</text>
  <text start="481.979" dur="5.4">scrubbing your brain of all the false</text>
  <text start="483.809" dur="5.64">conventional ideologies of mainstream</text>
  <text start="487.379" dur="3.54">science these days and you know starts</text>
  <text start="489.449" dur="2.85">to piece all this together and research</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="3.87">more into it it kind of it begins to</text>
  <text start="492.299" dur="7.29">make sense so when you&amp;#39;re in the cosmic</text>
  <text start="494.789" dur="6.99">sector space is what flows and time is</text>
  <text start="499.589" dur="6">what moves okay</text>
  <text start="501.779" dur="7.65">so what I mean the best example I could</text>
  <text start="505.589" dur="6.89">offer you right now that I can make an</text>
  <text start="509.429" dur="5.1">analogy with is consciousness our</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="4.03">metaphysical reality sometimes I think</text>
  <text start="514.529" dur="4.41">of it this way the material sector is</text>
  <text start="516.509" dur="5.55">your physical reality the cosmic sector</text>
  <text start="518.939" dur="5.01">is your metaphysical reality what is in</text>
  <text start="522.059" dur="4.341">the medical metaphysical reality right</text>
  <text start="523.949" dur="6.83">now your thoughts consciousness</text>
  <text start="526.4" dur="7.29">so consciousness essentially moves in</text>
  <text start="530.779" dur="5.101">three dimensions you can think of the</text>
  <text start="533.69" dur="6.24">past you can think of now you can think</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="5.76">of the future time is a moving movie</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="6.32">constant when it comes to your thought</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="7.02">processes space is what flows okay so</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="4.12">and again this is very difficult to kind</text>
  <text start="548.66" dur="4.08">of piece together but when you&amp;#39;re when</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re thinking thoughts it&amp;#39;s the space</text>
  <text start="552.74" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s flowing at the time that&amp;#39;s moving</text>
  <text start="555.11" dur="6.36">and when it comes to for instance time</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="8.22">travel this is how this whole process</text>
  <text start="561.47" dur="7.32">kind of works you get your object</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="7.11">whether it be a craft or a person or</text>
  <text start="568.79" dur="5.85">what not you get the material that</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re made up of to move faster than</text>
  <text start="574.64" dur="3.78">the speed of light which is not that</text>
  <text start="576.35" dur="4.94">difficult I&amp;#39;ll get to that and set but</text>
  <text start="578.42" dur="5.4">once they do once they start moving at</text>
  <text start="581.29" dur="8.92">faster than unit speed or faster than</text>
  <text start="583.82" dur="7.83">the speed of light space begins you can</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="3.89">say space begins flowing and they can</text>
  <text start="591.65" dur="5.629">then move either forward backward or</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="6.73">essentially at a different point in</text>
  <text start="597.279" dur="5.201">space at the present time so this is how</text>
  <text start="600.83" dur="4.32">for instance when you look into like the</text>
  <text start="602.48" dur="5.49">Philadelphia Experiment right when they</text>
  <text start="605.15" dur="4.26">took the giant boat they created an</text>
  <text start="607.97" dur="4.89">electromagnetic field around it and they</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="5.58">try to jump that ship in time it gets</text>
  <text start="612.86" dur="5.04">very freakin difficult because with</text>
  <text start="614.99" dur="5.25">space continuously flowing if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="617.9" dur="5.309">trying to move in time you have to be</text>
  <text start="620.24" dur="4.59">very precise at the space that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="623.209" dur="3.511">gonna pop out at or you could be in</text>
  <text start="624.83" dur="5.4">someplace two completely different have</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="4.98">no idea where you are and you know I</text>
  <text start="630.23" dur="3.299">won&amp;#39;t get too far into that because I</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="3.21">could talk about like ley lines and</text>
  <text start="633.529" dur="3.271">vortex points on the earth and</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="4.44">dematerialization portals and whatnot</text>
  <text start="636.8" dur="5.07">but wrap your mind around all this right</text>
  <text start="639.35" dur="4.47">it spins pretty simple you have yin and</text>
  <text start="641.87" dur="3.69">yang you have time and space you have</text>
  <text start="643.82" dur="3.78">space-time which one right now and then</text>
  <text start="645.56" dur="4.95">time-space which is faster than the</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="6.12">speed of light or that cosmic sector so</text>
  <text start="650.51" dur="4.389">yeah space and time same damn thing just</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="3.219">two reciprocals of each</text>
  <text start="654.899" dur="4.321">and then we get into gravity and</text>
  <text start="656.939" dur="4.82">radiation and gravity and radiation are</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="6.839">reciprocals of each other as well so</text>
  <text start="661.759" dur="7.901">gravity can be thought of as an inward</text>
  <text start="666.059" dur="6.39">motion with radiation being the outward</text>
  <text start="669.66" dur="6.659">motion so I have here what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="672.449" dur="6.69">torus and this is a torus is the natural</text>
  <text start="676.319" dur="5.911">shape of energy flow in the universe</text>
  <text start="679.139" dur="7.25">when you look at radiation fields this</text>
  <text start="682.23" dur="6.599">is how this is how they move so how</text>
  <text start="686.389" dur="5.471">electromagnetic radiation moves how</text>
  <text start="688.829" dur="5.88">motion essentially how motion moves for</text>
  <text start="691.86" dur="5.37">a double on repetitive statement there</text>
  <text start="694.709" dur="6.391">is that we have the middle of the torus</text>
  <text start="697.23" dur="7.68">which is the singularity point and we</text>
  <text start="701.1" dur="6.479">have the inward force compressing into</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="4.26">that singularity and then the energy or</text>
  <text start="707.579" dur="3.961">the movement is coming out of it and</text>
  <text start="709.17" dur="4.5">expanding again compression expansion</text>
  <text start="711.54" dur="3.93">yin and yang that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="713.67" dur="5.519">reciprocal systems theory and it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="715.47" dur="6.45">freakin beautiful but simple at the same</text>
  <text start="719.189" dur="6.231">time so complex but so simple at the</text>
  <text start="721.92" dur="7.409">same time so gravity is inward motion</text>
  <text start="725.42" dur="6.339">gravity is that compression a force</text>
  <text start="729.329" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s moving into everything to create</text>
  <text start="731.759" dur="5.13">it so gravity is literally the creating</text>
  <text start="735.059" dur="3.9">force that&amp;#39;s the force it&amp;#39;s going into</text>
  <text start="736.889" dur="5.221">everything at every single point and</text>
  <text start="738.959" dur="6.54">creating it radiation is the energy</text>
  <text start="742.11" dur="5.789">that&amp;#39;s emitting from it now for instance</text>
  <text start="745.499" dur="4.89">I have a the example I was going to use</text>
  <text start="747.899" dur="5.1">for this is a you know you could say a</text>
  <text start="750.389" dur="5.461">UFO or some man-made anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="752.999" dur="7.13">vehicle and I&amp;#39;ll explain this so how</text>
  <text start="755.85" dur="8.13">they essentially make these craft</text>
  <text start="760.129" dur="6.4">anti-gravity is with the use of rotating</text>
  <text start="763.98" dur="6.419">electromagnetic fields so like I said up</text>
  <text start="766.529" dur="6.211">here when it&amp;#39;s actually not that tough</text>
  <text start="770.399" dur="6.24">to get matter moving past the speed of</text>
  <text start="772.74" dur="6">light and that&amp;#39;s because is that the</text>
  <text start="776.639" dur="4.41">example I used earlier we&amp;#39;re all already</text>
  <text start="778.74" dur="3.839">moving all the time we&amp;#39;re moving on</text>
  <text start="781.049" dur="2.141">earth it&amp;#39;s moving around the star that</text>
  <text start="782.579" dur="3.37">our star</text>
  <text start="783.19" dur="5.189">another star so everything at all times</text>
  <text start="785.949" dur="4.14">is already pretty darn close to the</text>
  <text start="788.379" dur="5.431">speed of light so it doesn&amp;#39;t take that</text>
  <text start="790.089" dur="5.461">much to move you and I and craft and</text>
  <text start="793.81" dur="3.719">things like that past the point of speed</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="6.389">of light it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to do all you</text>
  <text start="797.529" dur="6.781">have to do is rotate electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="801.939" dur="3.84">fields rotate energy around yourself and</text>
  <text start="804.31" dur="5.759">that&amp;#39;ll get the particles within you</text>
  <text start="805.779" dur="6.12">then moving past units B so for instance</text>
  <text start="810.069" dur="3.781">this triangle craft that I have drawn</text>
  <text start="811.899" dur="3.331">here what they do is they rotate</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="3.12">electromagnetic fields</text>
  <text start="815.23" dur="6.209">you know however they do that whether</text>
  <text start="816.97" dur="7.28">they use you know rotating counter</text>
  <text start="821.439" dur="5.731">rotating water counter rotating mercury</text>
  <text start="824.25" dur="6.97">and whatever they need to do to create</text>
  <text start="827.17" dur="5.339">that a plasmic field around the craft so</text>
  <text start="831.22" dur="5.039">they rotate these emit electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="832.509" dur="6.51">fields it moves the craft or you know</text>
  <text start="836.259" dur="5.041">whatever is within that area that</text>
  <text start="839.019" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re rotating into the material</text>
  <text start="841.3" dur="6.269">sector and it counteracts gravity so</text>
  <text start="845.019" dur="5.701">once they move this craft and whatever</text>
  <text start="847.569" dur="6.661">is inside of it into that material</text>
  <text start="850.72" dur="6.69">sector these reciprocals also flip so</text>
  <text start="854.23" dur="6.87">gravity then becomes that outward force</text>
  <text start="857.41" dur="5.25">thus anti anti-gravity it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="861.1" dur="6.929">anti-gravity you&amp;#39;re just flipping it</text>
  <text start="862.66" dur="7.47">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re making gravity you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="868.029" dur="3.99">making gravity the outward push instead</text>
  <text start="870.13" dur="4.889">of an inward motion and then radiation</text>
  <text start="872.019" dur="5.43">becomes the inward so they just flip so</text>
  <text start="875.019" dur="4.201">that&amp;#39;s you know use some counter</text>
  <text start="877.449" dur="4.111">rotating electromagnetic fields and then</text>
  <text start="879.22" dur="5.19">you can make gravity flip and then</text>
  <text start="881.56" dur="5.759">that&amp;#39;s why whenever a craft begins to go</text>
  <text start="884.41" dur="6.02">into the material sector it looks like</text>
  <text start="887.319" dur="6.96">light it looks like just a big glowing</text>
  <text start="890.43" dur="5.709">thing is because light is being created</text>
  <text start="894.279" dur="3.331">and emanating from it when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.139" dur="2.341">rotating those electromagnetic fields</text>
  <text start="897.61" dur="2.88">I&amp;#39;m bringing every</text>
  <text start="898.48" dur="6.599">thing past the speed of light within</text>
  <text start="900.49" dur="7.32">those fields so again it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really I</text>
  <text start="905.079" dur="6.111">mean it sounds way freakin out there but</text>
  <text start="907.81" dur="6">once you delve into this physics it</text>
  <text start="911.19" dur="4.99">makes a whole lot of freaking sense you</text>
  <text start="913.81" dur="4.649">just have to think of it with your right</text>
  <text start="916.18" dur="4.86">brain you know we&amp;#39;ve been so conditioned</text>
  <text start="918.459" dur="6.451">to be left brain thinkers for so long in</text>
  <text start="921.04" dur="5.76">our educational systems that it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="924.91" dur="4.44">very tough for us to think of these</text>
  <text start="926.8" dur="4.86">abstract concepts which is why I say</text>
  <text start="929.35" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s a lot of unlearning we need to</text>
  <text start="931.66" dur="5.01">do and then relearning back upon that</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="5.779">with right brain learning instead of</text>
  <text start="936.67" dur="6.06">left brain so I invite you guys to look</text>
  <text start="939.839" dur="3.49">into Dewey B Larson&amp;#39;s physics a little</text>
  <text start="942.73" dur="2.7">bit more</text>
  <text start="943.329" dur="4.231">I hope the way I explained it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="945.43" dur="6.33">completely over your head but I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="6.899">my best to teach this as much as I learn</text>
  <text start="951.76" dur="4.35">it so I&amp;#39;m gonna get better at learning</text>
  <text start="954.459" dur="4.171">these concepts I&amp;#39;ll get better teaching</text>
  <text start="956.11" dur="5.7">these concepts but I feel personally</text>
  <text start="958.63" dur="5.699">that this this physical Theory here is</text>
  <text start="961.81" dur="4.35">one of the most important for us to</text>
  <text start="964.329" dur="4.5">learn if you really want to understand</text>
  <text start="966.16" dur="4.71">you know how the new physics or the new</text>
  <text start="968.829" dur="6.87">science of the future is going to be I</text>
  <text start="970.87" dur="8.79">think that you know once we once it</text>
  <text start="975.699" dur="5.791">becomes a mass effect of people</text>
  <text start="979.66" dur="2.82">realizing that all that most of the</text>
  <text start="981.49" dur="3.27">science that we&amp;#39;ve been taught is</text>
  <text start="982.48" dur="5.849">completely BS this is gonna be one of</text>
  <text start="984.76" dur="5.97">the theories that replaces that so you</text>
  <text start="988.329" dur="4.38">know get on the get on the train lab now</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="5.07">of learning new physics and new science</text>
  <text start="992.709" dur="4.291">and I&amp;#39;m trying to understand it all so I</text>
  <text start="995.8" dur="1.74">can be one of the ones that teaches it</text>
  <text start="997" dur="1.889">in the future</text>
  <text start="997.54" dur="3.75">which i think would be pretty cool but</text>
  <text start="998.889" dur="3.75">yeah you know check in to do Ruby Lawson</text>
  <text start="1001.29" dur="3.72">check into these reciprocal system</text>
  <text start="1002.639" dur="4.861">physics I&amp;#39;m gonna link down below a</text>
  <text start="1005.01" dur="5.1">couple neat PDFs and websites you can</text>
  <text start="1007.5" dur="4.44">check it out with and keep checking back</text>
  <text start="1010.11" dur="4.5">for these videos because I&amp;#39;m only I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1011.94" dur="7.19">gonna get better and more congruent with</text>
  <text start="1014.61" dur="4.52">teaching all this to you guys so done</text>
