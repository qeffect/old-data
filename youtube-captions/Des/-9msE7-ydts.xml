  <text start="103.88" dur="5.739">like I said I&amp;#39;m gonna answer this in two</text>
  <text start="106.259" dur="6.991">parts first of all if you did go to</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="5.311">college okay so on one hand you</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="4.259">understand that much of what they teach</text>
  <text start="114.93" dur="5.34">us in our school systems is in fact</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="5.761">indoctrination which is great you have</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="5.73">that understanding but I want to offer</text>
  <text start="123.27" dur="3.09">you a little bit of objective reasoning</text>
  <text start="126" dur="5.67">here</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="6.67">don&amp;#39;t let your disenfranchisement or</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="4.81">your anger of</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="5.64">this system take away a perfectly good</text>
  <text start="136.48" dur="5.339">opportunity that could present itself in</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="7.41">front of you so for instance point being</text>
  <text start="141.819" dur="5.971">here say you do go to college right yeah</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="2.91">yeah yeah you know it&amp;#39;s indoctrination</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="5.58">much of what they feed you there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.99" dur="6.21"> but what sorts of opportunities</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="4.949">would you have if you did choose to go</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="5.64">to college okay number one and this is</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="5.601">just from personal experience college is</text>
  <text start="160.84" dur="6.41">a wonderful time dude you&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="8.59">so many friends there you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="8.2">so much stuff you can go do I mean I had</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.1">a wonderful time wonderful time when I</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="4.08">was at state university so much of a</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="3.33">wonderful time I actually failed out of</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="2.88">State University had to go back home</text>
  <text start="180.94" dur="3.9">with my parents and go to Community</text>
  <text start="182.41" dur="4.2">College so trust me it could be fun and</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="2.94">even if you&amp;#39;re not into the party scene</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="3.93">you don&amp;#39;t want to get involved in that</text>
  <text start="187.78" dur="4.83">you could do intramural sports you could</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="4.529">mess around in their rec center you</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="4.409">could make all sorts of friend and go do</text>

  <text start="197.019" dur="6.06">time right don&amp;#39;t squander that</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="7.44">opportunity and second of all on that</text>
  <text start="203.079" dur="8.431">same point what is your job when you go</text>
  <text start="207.16" dur="9.44">to college your job is to study your job</text>
  <text start="211.51" dur="9.09">is to learn to educate yourself right so</text>
  <text start="216.6" dur="5.59">if you do decide to go to college you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.6" dur="4.77">already going in there with the mindset</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="4.769">of discernment of knowing that a lot of</text>
  <text start="225.37" dur="3.72">what you&amp;#39;re gonna learn there is not the</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="3.241">truth right so like I said you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.09" dur="5.97">already ahead of the game</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="7.319">so why not go to college we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="4.26">have so much time on your hands your job</text>

  <text start="239.32" dur="3.81">gonna have so many resources they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="4.139">gonna have a giant library or college</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re gonna have computers everywhere</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="5.731">you&amp;#39;re gonna have so much opportunity to</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="4.95">inform yourself and like I said you</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="5.549">already have your discernment cap pretty</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="5.639">fine-tuned so you&amp;#39;re gonna know which</text>
  <text start="256.269" dur="4.65">information is good what information is</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="3.93">not you&amp;#39;re gonna get even better at</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="4.951">learning what&amp;#39;s good and what&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="262.419" dur="4.211">right so there you go and not only that</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="2.89">but</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="3.72">hell all those friends and friends that</text>
  <text start="268.76" dur="3.9">are gonna be making there you could</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="5.07">plant seeds plant seeds in them start</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="4.86">waking up all the people all the</text>
  <text start="275.42" dur="3.09">connections that you make at college I</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="1.95">mean you could make a true difference</text>
  <text start="278.51" dur="3.72">there man</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="5.31">again don&amp;#39;t squander that opportunity</text>
  <text start="282.23" dur="6.75">just because you&amp;#39;re angry at the system</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="7.23">right so that&amp;#39;s if you do to go to</text>
  <text start="288.98" dur="6.66">college okay let&amp;#39;s go into number two</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="6.6">second part of this what if you don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="4.59">to college okay so you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="4.14">necessarily know your particular</text>
  <text start="300.23" dur="4.38">situation I don&amp;#39;t know if college is</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="4.74">gonna be paid for for you whether by</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="5.31">your parents or grants or scholarships</text>
  <text start="307.49" dur="4.29">or something like that I mean if you do</text>
  <text start="309.92" dur="3.99">have to take out some sort of a loan</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="4.68">that you have to pay out the ass for I</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t blame you don&amp;#39;t blame you for not</text>
  <text start="316.46" dur="5.85">wanting to go to the University to have</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="5.52">to pay that back and not only that but</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="5.06">yeah I don&amp;#39;t blame you at all for not</text>
  <text start="325.07" dur="4.53">wanting to deal with the indoctrination</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="5.44">because again a little bit of my own</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="5.82">personal experience here when I did fail</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="4.65">out of State University go to Community</text>
  <text start="335.42" dur="5.85">College I was in Community College for</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="7.2">about a year and a half at which point I</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="6.66">just said bye screw it I&amp;#39;m gonna start</text>
  <text start="344.66" dur="5.07">working full-time at this job see the</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="6.84">important thing was that I had an out</text>
  <text start="349.73" dur="9.72">okay I am all for somebody deciding not</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="8.04">to go to college and become either an</text>
  <text start="359.45" dur="4.95">entrepreneur or create their own non job</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="5.94">as some people out there have called it</text>
  <text start="364.4" dur="6.6">or you know basically take the jump take</text>
  <text start="368.75" dur="5.19">the leap and start their own business or</text>
  <text start="371" dur="5.52">get into some sort of trade or you know</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.83">what I&amp;#39;m saying just going outside of</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="5.79">the stat quo outside of the norms saying</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="5.67">screw your expensive dis informations</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="4.41">filled education I&amp;#39;m gonna go do my own</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="5.09">thing I&amp;#39;m all for that that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="7.41">ended up doing but let me tell you man</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="6.19">number one it&amp;#39;s not easy it&amp;#39;s not easy</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="5.41">at all</text>
  <text start="395.72" dur="7.09">when I left school for good when</text>
  <text start="399.54" dur="5.04">is I was probably 21 at the time dude it</text>
  <text start="402.81" dur="7.47">was rough</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="8.69">it became year year go by to like five</text>
  <text start="410.28" dur="6.69">years of just grinding I was working</text>
  <text start="413.27" dur="5.98">more than full time I was working this</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="4.83">job to that job to that job you know I</text>
  <text start="419.25" dur="4.56">didn&amp;#39;t have that fancy pizza paper that</text>
  <text start="421.8" dur="5.94">people look for when they want to hire</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="9.18">you etc etc so it&amp;#39;s difficult man it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="8.82">very difficult it takes a particular</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="5.25">mindset that not a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="4.13">I&amp;#39;m gonna be honest with you not a lot</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="6.9">of people have that entrepreneurial</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="8.38">disciplined motivated inspired self</text>
  <text start="445.14" dur="6.09">educating mindset to become that sort of</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="6.36">entrepreneur to build their own business</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="6.72">and not need any fancy degree okay so</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s tough it takes a special mindset</text>
  <text start="457.95" dur="6.75">and you have to have some sort of out</text>
  <text start="462.33" dur="4.77">like I mentioned I was able to leave</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="4.35">college to go work full-time at a health</text>
  <text start="467.1" dur="4.44">food store I ended up working there for</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="6.24">a few years held a couple other odd jobs</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="6.21">and then I finally made the leap didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="475.29" dur="5.25">work for anybody quit my jobs and then</text>
  <text start="477.75" dur="5.04">started on YouTube that was almost two</text>
  <text start="480.54" dur="5.73">years ago now about a year and three</text>
  <text start="482.79" dur="5.73">quarters ago so let me tell you it was</text>
  <text start="486.27" dur="3.72">like five years of grinding my ass off</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="3.69">and then when I started my youtube</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="5.15">channel is like six months of still</text>
  <text start="492.21" dur="7.47">grinding my ass off to start actually</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="6.4">finally getting a sort of return or my</text>
  <text start="499.68" dur="3.24">asshole wasn&amp;#39;t puckered up every night</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="3.78">thinking if I was gonna put food on the</text>
  <text start="502.92" dur="3.81">table you know or wondering what my next</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="2.88">opportunity was gonna be or when the</text>
  <text start="506.73" dur="4.71">heck I was gonna get out of this shitty</text>
  <text start="508.2" dur="5.82">situation now I&amp;#39;m my own boss okay but</text>
  <text start="511.44" dur="5.55">like I said it was really tough getting</text>
  <text start="514.02" dur="5.97">here it took countless thousands of</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="5.16">hours of educating myself and learning</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="5.4">not only the subject content not only</text>
  <text start="522.15" dur="5.97">this conspiratorial you know truth</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="6.31">reality but also learning how to market</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="7.36">learning how to business etc etc so</text>
  <text start="531.7" dur="8.22">I luckily had an out I had an out when I</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="7.65">was in Community College and then come</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="7.29">two years ago my out was me choosing to</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="6.03">go on to youtube and do social media and</text>
  <text start="547.21" dur="5.01">all the internet stuff create my own non</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="5.94">job so if you do decide not to go to</text>

  <text start="563.35" dur="4.56">that mindset don&amp;#39;t get me wrong you know</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="4.59">I surely didn&amp;#39;t have this mindset</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="3.87">when I even started this two years ago I</text>
  <text start="569.41" dur="4.92">had to make it I deform myself into it</text>
  <text start="571.78" dur="5.88">which can&amp;#39;t be done you can do it and</text>
  <text start="574.33" dur="9.15">not only that but you need a particular</text>
