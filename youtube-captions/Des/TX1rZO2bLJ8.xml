  <text start="225.409" dur="3.51">some other secret space program</text>
  <text start="227.269" dur="4.791">whistleblowers have said there seems to</text>
  <text start="228.919" dur="6.9">be a roll out of this partial disclosure</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="8.139">taking place right we&amp;#39;re seeing America</text>
  <text start="235.819" dur="7.441">go into space taking more leaps into</text>
  <text start="240.199" dur="5.07">space I should say and Russia in the</text>

  <text start="247.34" dur="4.649">little bit more about some other partial</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="5.37">disclosure rollouts in a minute but I</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="5.581">wanted to make that noted if you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="6.33">know about that next I&amp;#39;m gonna point you</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="6">towards some interesting information in</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="4.77">regards to climate change and this</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="5.94">saying climate change propaganda is now</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="5.759">changing this video released a few days</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="3.67">ago by suspicious observers on their</text>
  <text start="271.789" dur="4.071">YouTube channel</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="4.12">basically outlined this new scientific</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="4.23">paper that was released and it was</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="5.88">released by this very same people the</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="5.91">very same group of scientists who are</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="5.42">propagating that man-made global warming</text>
  <text start="286" dur="6.93">stuff and they actually formulated the</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="5.95">IPCC or the International climate change</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="4.44">scientists you know the ones that people</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="4.83">always say Oh 97% of scientists all</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="4.14">agree well that&amp;#39;s because they all get</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="3.75">their same talking points from this</text>
  <text start="301.51" dur="3.87">group I&amp;#39;m talking about right here and</text>
  <text start="303.13" dur="4.67">what this group basically did is come</text>
  <text start="305.38" dur="5.73">out with a new paper that says they</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="6.43">overestimated how much heating occurs by</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="7.05">carbon dioxide by 50% so they actually</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="7.38">said that humans can now emit 2 to 3</text>
  <text start="318.16" dur="3.87">times more carbon than previously</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="4.71">thought</text>
  <text start="322.03" dur="6.54">so they instantly completely changed</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="5.4">everything that people thought they knew</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="5.55">and again that 97% of scientists that</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="4.44">all have a consensus as to manmade</text>
  <text start="334.12" dur="3.21">global warming are now gonna have to</text>
  <text start="336.16" dur="2.61">change their talking points because they</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="3.27">really don&amp;#39;t know that much about global</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="3.9">warming they just all get their</text>
  <text start="340.6" dur="3.87">information from the same core group of</text>
  <text start="342.67" dur="3.63">people and this happens not just with</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="4.41">global warming but everything happens in</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="4.4">the vaccine with vaccines scientists</text>
  <text start="348.88" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t get their talking points from</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="6.52">the same centralized group out of the</text>
  <text start="354.16" dur="4.74">CDC of the AMA right it&amp;#39;s just this same</text>
  <text start="357.22" dur="3.78">kind of cookie cutter thing happens</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="4.26">through every branch of science so</text>
  <text start="361" dur="4.02">climate change propaganda is now</text>
  <text start="363.16" dur="4.2">changing go check out that video for a</text>
  <text start="365.02" dur="5.49">little more info and another piece of</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="5.09">information just to slip in there real</text>
  <text start="370.51" dur="5.64">quick to really</text>
  <text start="372.45" dur="7.09">hound home the nonsense of this man-made</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="6.03">global warming propaganda because again</text>
  <text start="379.54" dur="5.73">I mean this this topic it induces so</text>
  <text start="382.18" dur="4.95">much fear in people that people hang on</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="5.37">to the propaganda they&amp;#39;ve been told very</text>
  <text start="387.13" dur="6.39">tightly so this man-made global warming</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="6">topic in my opinion is one of the best</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="5.55">ones to red pill people with that the</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="5.25">vaccine topic and there&amp;#39;s a few others</text>
  <text start="399.07" dur="4.05">but these are very crucial to get people</text>
  <text start="401.89" dur="3.72">to wake up with because of how</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="3.27">emotionally tied into them they are but</text>
  <text start="405.61" dur="2.79">records</text>
  <text start="406.39" dur="4.2">sea-ice growth in the Arctic over the</text>
  <text start="408.4" dur="3.75">month of September basically so another</text>
  <text start="410.59" dur="3.63">piece of information that shows you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="4.2">not just warming trends we&amp;#39;re seeing but</text>
  <text start="414.22" dur="4.41">cooling trends as well and a lot of</text>
  <text start="416.35" dur="4.23">change going on everywhere not just on</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="7.44">our planet but with the Sun and the</text>
  <text start="420.58" dur="7.83">whole solar system so there&amp;#39;s that next</text>
  <text start="426.07" dur="5.7">Republican or Republican representative</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="5.19">Steve Scalise is back</text>
  <text start="431.77" dur="3.99">remember the representative that was</text>
  <text start="433.6" dur="6.09">shot earlier this summer while playing</text>
  <text start="435.76" dur="6.18">baseball near Washington DC and flying</text>
  <text start="439.69" dur="5.87">off I&amp;#39;m still gonna pose this question</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="8.07">out there but was he shot by a patsy</text>
  <text start="445.56" dur="7.81">that the elites or the deep state had</text>
  <text start="450.01" dur="5.97">purposefully put out there because this</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="4.62">representative Steve he was just a</text>
  <text start="455.98" dur="4.5">couple days before that shooting he was</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="5.73">making announcements about combating</text>
  <text start="460.48" dur="6.75">human trafficking and these deep Staters</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="8.07">that is one of their prime operations</text>
  <text start="467.23" dur="7.17">that they use for many purposes money</text>
  <text start="471.79" dur="5.79">and their rituals and one of the cases</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="5.79">but think of that right think of that</text>
  <text start="477.58" dur="4.47">and lastly let&amp;#39;s talk about Mars cuz if</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="5.66">you think I&amp;#39;m a few things coming out in</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="7.26">the way of Mars news and on musk is</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="6.04">releasing his plans to go to Mars</text>
  <text start="489.31" dur="6.57">I believe he&amp;#39;s actually holding a live</text>
  <text start="491.89" dur="6.84">event and taking the stage somewhere in</text>
  <text start="495.88" dur="6.21">America tomorrow to discuss his plans</text>
  <text start="498.73" dur="5.25">with SpaceX and getting humans to Mars a</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="5.25">lot of stuff coming out about Mars the</text>
  <text start="503.98" dur="5.25">United Arab Emirates is making an</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="4.43">incredible Mars city that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.23" dur="5.7">building for training purposes and</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="5.11">Lockheed is revealing plans for a Mars</text>
  <text start="514.93" dur="5.19">base camp that will orbit the Red Planet</text>
  <text start="516.88" dur="8.07">in 2028 with six crew members to search</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="10.23">for alien life Wow right some big things</text>

  <text start="537.16" dur="4.06">like that you know</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="8.1">once once they get to Mars I bet they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.22" dur="9.12">gonna magically announce some invention</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="6.62">or discovery of some gravitational</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="5.46">anomalies or some ability to use</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="4.99">anti-gravity capabilities to get to Mars</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s supposedly another gravitational</text>
  <text start="558.47" dur="5.46">wave announcement that&amp;#39;s coming in the</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="5.37">coming days by some conventional</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="6.23">mainstream science outlets so what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="5.97">seeing here is that everything is</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="5.11">getting closer and closer like it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="572.69" dur="6.18">2050 humans are gonna get to Mars no</text>
  <text start="575.27" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s not 2030 anymore now it&amp;#39;s like 2022</text>
  <text start="578.87" dur="2.88">it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s getting shorter and</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="2.76">shorter and shorter because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.75" dur="3.48">trying to roll out all these</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="5.01">technologies and all of this ability</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="5.49">that humanity already has in a shorter</text>
