  <text start="105.93" dur="3.899">and more information that exposes it</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="4.05">last couple of things I&amp;#39;ve seen this one</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="3.36">from the Washington Examiner they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="4.559">saying the whistle blower had</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="5.79">professional ties to a twenty20</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="5.311">Democratic candidate according to their</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="4.771">sources in the inquiry that some</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="3.839">congressmen were doing with the</text>
  <text start="123.75" dur="4.17">Inspector General of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="4.171">community Michael Atkinson the guy who</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="3.69">was handling the complaint from the</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="4.29">whistleblower he was saying that the</text>
  <text start="131.61" dur="5.22">whistleblower has a</text>
  <text start="134.01" dur="5.309">professional professional tied to a 2020</text>
  <text start="136.83" dur="2.82">Democratic candidate basically work for</text>

  <text start="151.14" dur="3.629">cover up this whole Ukrainian situation</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="4.079">so makes sense that he would fabricate</text>
  <text start="154.769" dur="4.381">this whistleblower to point the finger</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="5.181">and projected Trump to try to hide by</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="5.789">his own crimes but uh I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="162.2" dur="5.349">interesting not just that but this</text>
  <text start="164.939" dur="6.39">whistleblower actually had an attorney</text>
  <text start="167.549" dur="5.641">who used to work directly for the former</text>

  <text start="181.56" dur="3.239">not on the legal team but in the</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="3.87">beginning of this process a couple of</text>
  <text start="184.799" dur="4.981">months ago however or whenever it</text>
  <text start="187.139" dur="4.231">started he was an assistant on it you</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="4.59">know helped in the process in some way</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="5.19">so whistleblower worked for a twenty</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="5.85">twenty Democratic candidate he used to</text>

  <text start="220.68" dur="3.86">defense you know get his defenses ready</text>
  <text start="222.449" dur="4.32">for the impeachment inquiry but I</text>

  <text start="226.769" dur="3.421">has with absolutely nothing so trey</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="3.3">gowdy joining the legal team in my eyes</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="3.78">I don&amp;#39;t think this is defense I think</text>
  <text start="231.599" dur="5.04">this is offense if I remember correctly</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="4.32">sometime within the last week or two I</text>
  <text start="236.639" dur="3.93">remember Trump making a comment about</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="4.949">maybe having to bring forth his own</text>
  <text start="240.569" dur="5.941">lawsuits his own litigations right so</text>
