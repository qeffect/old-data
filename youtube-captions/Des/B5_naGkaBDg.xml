  <text start="9.66" dur="4.08">are sprayed over us and injected into us</text>
  <text start="12.15" dur="4.139">and are found in our daily lives that</text>
  <text start="13.74" dur="4.86">really hamper our nervous systems and</text>
  <text start="16.289" dur="5.371">our body&amp;#39;s ability to be energetic</text>
  <text start="18.6" dur="4.919">beings so go check out that video I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="3.39">link it down below this video is going</text>
  <text start="23.519" dur="4.561">to be me covering different supplements</text>
  <text start="25.05" dur="6.299">and concepts to best detoxify your body</text>
  <text start="28.08" dur="7.139">from those to be your most energetic</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="5.911">healthiest strongest self and let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="35.219" dur="3.991">started so first before I get into</text>
  <text start="37.26" dur="4.35">actual supplements I want to just talk</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="5.79">about a few holistic health concepts</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="4.5">because you can take all the supplements</text>
  <text start="45" dur="3.059">you want but if you&amp;#39;re not living a</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="4.199">healthy lifestyle under that it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="48.059" dur="5.371">just gonna be band-aid effects so first</text>
  <text start="50.309" dur="4.921">and foremost water just drink enough</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="4.14">water your body&amp;#39;s not gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="5.46">detoxify itself if you don&amp;#39;t drink</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="5.61">enough water so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the most basic</text>
  <text start="60.69" dur="5.55">thing that I tell every single one of my</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="6.63">clients just simply drink half your body</text>
  <text start="66.24" dur="6.12">weight in ounces of water per day that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="4.2">it and we are chronically dehydrated</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="3.81">because I live in the Pacific Northwest</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="4.71">people around here basically addicted to</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="4.05">coffee and coffee is very dehydrating I</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="2.7">bet you know a couple of people watching</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="4.98">this video right now or sipping on their</text>
  <text start="81.42" dur="5.16">morning coffees and soda juice all types</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="2.58">of other energy drinks things like that</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re all diuretics they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="5.46">dehydrating so drink enough water you</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="4.5">will detoxify and water itself I mean</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m not gonna get off on a tangent on</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="4.44">that but if you look into dr. Emoto</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="3.39">studies and viktor schauberger studies</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="3.3">water is basically the bridge between</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="4.529">the physical and metaphysical that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="6.089">our planet is 70% water that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="6.871">are 70% water and that&amp;#39;s why our Sun</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.761">literally emits what&amp;#39;s been known as</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="5.519">star water it emits oxygen and hydrogen</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="5.309">ions so when that intercepts planetary</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="4.231">atmospheres it&amp;#39;ll turn into ozone and</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="4.731">actual water itself are are basically</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="6.179">what I&amp;#39;m saying as our universe is made</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="5.849">to make water so drink it secondly</text>
  <text start="128.099" dur="4.411">rebounding and sweating these are two</text>
  <text start="130.129" dur="3.401">things that you know we&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="3.78">collectively lazy</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="5.19">society so we don&amp;#39;t really get up and</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="4.41">move and rebound enough</text>
  <text start="138.72" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;ll help drain your lymph nodes and</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="5.13">move fluid around your body so rebound</text>
  <text start="142.83" dur="4.32">and also sweat that goes along the lines</text>
  <text start="145.83" dur="2.34">with the dehydration I was just talking</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="2.73">about we don&amp;#39;t sweat enough because</text>
  <text start="148.17" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re often dehydrated but like I said</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;re just kind of lazy so sweat right</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="5.25">however you want to do it exercise you</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="2.849">know put on a couple sweat shirts and</text>
  <text start="157.38" dur="2.4">landed an electric blanket sauna</text>
  <text start="158.819" dur="5.011">whatever you want to do</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="6.81">and lastly balanced stress and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="7.189">gonna go off on too long of a tangent</text>
  <text start="166.59" dur="7.5">with this one but stress in our bodies</text>
  <text start="171.019" dur="4.831">follows the same lines as the yin and</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="4.2">yang concept right that&amp;#39;s why that</text>
  <text start="175.85" dur="4.57">concept of duality is so important</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="3.63">because you can explain a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="3.51">with that a lot of people have the</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="5.25">connotation of stress being just a bad</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="5.85">thing but in regards to our nervous</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="4.349">systems stress is both a good and a bad</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="5.25">thing right you have to have good and</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="7.141">bad gift I&amp;#39;ve wanted to so when it comes</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="5.91">to our autonomic nervous system we have</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="3.54">two branches of that we have what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="3.63">called the sympathetic and the</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="4.92">parasympathetic branches of our</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="5.4">autonomic nervous system so follow along</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="4.35">here the sympathetic branch of our</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="3.6">nervous system is associated with the</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="3.989">fight-or-flight response right so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="3.57">your adrenal gland pumping out a bunch</text>
  <text start="215.459" dur="4.381">of cortisol and norepinephrine and</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="5.79">stress hormones and that&amp;#39;s typically</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="4.47">what we most people are always in just</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="3.029">look at our world our world is so</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="4.019">stressed our lives are so stressed I</text>
  <text start="225.959" dur="5.521">mean it&amp;#39;s kind of been made that way by</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="5.491">our human farmers but everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="4.2">stressed so we have to honor more of</text>
  <text start="233.82" dur="3.65">that parasympathetic response that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="4.95">associated with your rest and digest</text>
  <text start="237.47" dur="5.889">part of your nervous system or your it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.63" dur="5.729">also called feed and breed I think but</text>
  <text start="243.359" dur="6.711">the parasympathetic to stimulate that</text>
  <text start="246.359" dur="7.771">requires relaxation requires literally</text>
  <text start="250.07" dur="6.789">meditation yoga tai chi go get a massage</text>
  <text start="254.13" dur="5.07">go whatever you want to do that actually</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="3.961">relaxes you will stimulate the</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="3.69">parasympathetic response and doing that</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="4.589">helping to balance all these stress</text>
  <text start="262.89" dur="4.23">hormones will help your body detoxify</text>
  <text start="265.409" dur="4.111">and manage whatever is going</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="4.59">with it far better so now that all of</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="3.39">that is aside I&amp;#39;m trying to talk quick</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="2.85">here I don&amp;#39;t want this to be too long of</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="3.96">a video we will get into these</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="6">supplements now first and foremost is</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="6.21">chlorella chlorella is in freshwater</text>
  <text start="280.56" dur="4.169">algae it&amp;#39;s a very grease very fine</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="4.08">powder you can take it in capsules and</text>
  <text start="284.729" dur="4.111">tablets as well but it&amp;#39;s very dark green</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="3.56">pigment because it&amp;#39;s so full of</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="4.68">chlorophyll it&amp;#39;s one of the highest</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="4.96">compounds on earth in it&amp;#39;s chlorophyll</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="5.19">content and chlorophyll is basically</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="5.85">plant blood but it helps to oxygen eyes</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="5.13">our body the chlorophyll is what makes</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="4.38">it green so taking in high amounts of</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="5.01">chlorophyll will help oxygen eyes-u and</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="7.5">help detoxify you and chlorophyll will</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="7.59">actually make your cells release toxins</text>
  <text start="313.41" dur="8.1">a lot easier and the fibrous cell wall</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="7.349">of chlorophyll chlorophyll cells will</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="3.42">attach onto toxins very easily so</text>
  <text start="323.789" dur="4.201">chlorophyll is very effective at</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="5.01">eliminating the heavy metals that like I</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="4.23">said are sprayed over us and injected</text>
  <text start="329.94" dur="4.97">into us and that we even consume so</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="6.419">there you go chlorella number two is</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="6.91">what&amp;#39;s called fulvic acid fulvic acid is</text>
  <text start="338.639" dur="6.301">an organic compound that&amp;#39;s found in soil</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="5.04">and water and rock sediments found</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="7.08">pretty much everywhere but it&amp;#39;s created</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="8.73">by microorganisms in the soil and plants</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="6.209">will then uptake it in to their roots</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="6.15">and use it themselves so fulvic acid is</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="5.461">something it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s what I want to go</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="4.5">with this it&amp;#39;s the strongest electrolyte</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="6.15">known to man and it can actually carry</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="5.79">60 times its weight in different</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="3.78">electrolytes and also in toxins and</text>
  <text start="372.03" dur="3.27">poisons so if you take and fulvic acid</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="3.9">not only will it help detoxify you and</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="4.98">carry that out of your body but it</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="5.07">also help with nutrient absorption and</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="5.49">health stuff go into your cells - so</text>
  <text start="382.59" dur="4.71">fulvic acid is something - very helpful</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="3.3">to supplement with because we just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="3.899">get it in our bodies anymore since it</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="5.069">over agriculture and all the pesticide</text>
  <text start="391.199" dur="4.741">usage and the pollution of the planet</text>
  <text start="394.139" dur="3.511">fulvic acid levels are dropping so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.94" dur="4.469">a very good supplement to take I just</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="6.93">took mine about 15 minutes ago the</text>
  <text start="400.409" dur="7.141">is zeolites and zeolites are volcanic</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="5.22">minerals that form where volcanic ash</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="4.019">meets with alkaline water so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="3.959">actually some springs I believe around</text>
  <text start="411.569" dur="4.5">Asia and Russia to have very high</text>
  <text start="413.759" dur="4.98">natural levels of zeolites and a lot of</text>
  <text start="416.069" dur="4.14">people will go sit in these Springs and</text>
  <text start="418.739" dur="3.63">a literally almost reverse the aging</text>
  <text start="420.209" dur="3.72">process because of how well zeolite</text>
  <text start="422.369" dur="4.02">detoxifies you and how strong of an</text>
  <text start="423.929" dur="4.26">antioxidant is it is so you can take</text>
  <text start="426.389" dur="5.04">zeolites and pills and powders and</text>
  <text start="428.189" dur="5.1">things like that but zeolite what it is</text>
  <text start="431.429" dur="3.09">it has no nutritional properties and the</text>
  <text start="433.289" dur="4.71">body can&amp;#39;t break it down so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="434.519" dur="5.1">safe there&amp;#39;s even been some studies done</text>
  <text start="437.999" dur="5.28">on nursing and pregnant mothers with</text>
  <text start="439.619" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s very very safe but what it&amp;#39;ll do it</text>
  <text start="443.279" dur="4.25">has a cage-like structure to it and</text>
  <text start="445.169" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;ll actually magnetically attract the</text>
  <text start="447.529" dur="4.12">poisonous molecules into it and it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.239" dur="3.3">get out they can&amp;#39;t get out that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="451.649" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s so safe with pregnant nursing</text>
  <text start="453.539" dur="5.58">mothers potentially not gonna say it is</text>
  <text start="456.239" dur="4.44">but potentially and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="459.119" dur="3.84">safe for detoxification in general</text>
  <text start="460.679" dur="5.431">because once that poisonous molecule</text>
  <text start="462.959" dur="5.55">whether it&amp;#39;s a heavy metal or PCBU DDT</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="4.169">whatever gets sucked in it ain&amp;#39;t coming</text>
  <text start="468.509" dur="4.77">out and that gets out of the body so</text>
  <text start="470.279" dur="4.59">zeolites are very effective number four</text>
  <text start="473.279" dur="3.23">I have five should have said that</text>
  <text start="474.869" dur="4.8">earlier but but number four here is</text>
  <text start="476.509" dur="5.44">stabilized oxygen and you can buy</text>
  <text start="479.669" dur="5.34">different stabilized oxygen liquids that</text>
  <text start="481.949" dur="5.46">you add to purified water that help to</text>
  <text start="485.009" dur="3.57">oxygenate the water and I&amp;#39;ve taken a lot</text>
  <text start="487.409" dur="4.73">of these supplements before and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.579" dur="6.81">very helpful with endurance with</text>
  <text start="492.139" dur="6.25">hydration energy levels all sorts of</text>
  <text start="495.389" dur="4.77">that but the thing with oxygen</text>
  <text start="498.389" dur="5.01">supplements is that they are very</text>
  <text start="500.159" dur="5.4">helpful because we live in an oxygen</text>
  <text start="503.399" dur="6.45">starved world our world is extremely</text>
  <text start="505.559" dur="6.27">polluted agriculture has like I keep</text>
  <text start="509.849" dur="3.66">saying that but agriculture has</text>
  <text start="511.829" dur="4.62">completely decimated the natural</text>
  <text start="513.509" dur="6.45">nutrients in our foods cooking processes</text>
  <text start="516.449" dur="4.801">and even things like bad posture inhibit</text>
  <text start="519.959" dur="3.18">our breathing and we just don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="4.319">enough oxygen into our bodies that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="523.139" dur="4.081">the first ebook I wrote on health was</text>
  <text start="525.569" dur="4.231">about posture I&amp;#39;m writin another one on</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="5.099">nutrition next but even you know things</text>
  <text start="529.8" dur="4.44">like that inhibited breathing and like I</text>
  <text start="532.319" dur="3.33">said earlier that stress that simple</text>
  <text start="534.24" dur="3">stress response we&amp;#39;re always in that</text>
  <text start="535.649" dur="2.971">fight-or-flight response when we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="537.24" dur="2.99">that fight-or-flight response we tend to</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="3.99">be chest breathers as opposed to</text>
  <text start="540.23" dur="3.76">diaphragmatic belly breather so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="3.63">stressed out we have bad posture we</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t breathe right low oxygen also</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="4.68">along the lines of that pollution that I</text>
  <text start="547.83" dur="5.43">mentioned studies have shown that in</text>
  <text start="550.92" dur="4.14">ancient times thousands and millions of</text>
  <text start="553.26" dur="5.34">years ago our atmosphere used to be 30</text>
  <text start="555.06" dur="6.839">to 35 percent oxygen now it is down to</text>
  <text start="558.6" dur="5.91">21% because of all the pollution there</text>
  <text start="561.899" dur="4.981">is and some studies are shown if you</text>
  <text start="564.51" dur="4.38">live in a large city during rush hour</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="3.72">that can even fall down to nine to ten</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="4.77">percent of oxygen levels in the</text>
  <text start="570.6" dur="7.34">atmosphere so doing any oxygen</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="7.08">supplement would be helpful and lastly</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="4.93">this is not a supplement but it&amp;#39;s a food</text>
