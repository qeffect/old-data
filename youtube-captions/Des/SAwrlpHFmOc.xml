  <text start="38.46" dur="3.869">Saturday December 21st</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="3.93">I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling so hot this week so I</text>
  <text start="42.329" dur="3.66">took a few days off YouTube which I hate</text>
  <text start="44.309" dur="3.391">doing because I don&amp;#39;t have to play</text>
  <text start="45.989" dur="3.09">catch-up and I&amp;#39;m gonna play catch-up</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="4.23">this weekend by doing a few different</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="5.341">videos on different topics this one is</text>
  <text start="51.93" dur="4.53">going to be on vaccines one of the most</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="5.029">important fights going on right now and</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s an often-overlooked fight often</text>
  <text start="59.449" dur="4.93">ignored and in fact it&amp;#39;s one of the most</text>
  <text start="62.07" dur="3.9">censored ones out there and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="64.379" dur="2.761">think a lot of people realize that you</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="3.09">know people tend to get in their own</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="4.049">respective boxes and their own little</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="5.309">bubbles whether it&amp;#39;s the political</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="4.621">bubble or the cue one or paranormal UFOs</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="2.971">over here and whatnot</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="4.29">we have an unfortunate sort of</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="5.52">compartmentalization between groups out</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.62">there and especially in the realm of</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="3.81">politics like they try to claim that</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="3.45">censorship just happens to them they</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t really realize how much censorship</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="5.61">goes on in the natural health world and</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="5.82">how much lies in propaganda there is</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="4.83">about that so that&amp;#39;s why I devote some</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="5.19">videos and content time and again to</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="4.829">talking about Big Pharma vaccine truth</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="4.59">natural health and things like this</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="5.341">because again there&amp;#39;s so many topics out</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="3.959">there each of them are important they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="3.99">all really connected in some way shape</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="4.231">or form and the vaccine topic incredibly</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="3.9">important because we don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="3.509">injected with poison do we we want to</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="3.839">really understand how our minds and</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="5.701">bodies work don&amp;#39;t we we want to expose</text>
  <text start="120.509" dur="7.041">the corruption within government and</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="6.45">within the giant corporations that are</text>
  <text start="127.55" dur="5.23">diseases you know causing us all these</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="4.799">problems lying to us so let&amp;#39;s get to it</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="3.99">in this video and I have a few different</text>
  <text start="134.849" dur="3.241">articles few different news stories that</text>
  <text start="136.77" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;m gonna go through that happened this</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="5.009">week and we&amp;#39;re gonna start in New Jersey</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="4.23">so the story out of New Jersey is</text>
  <text start="143.099" dur="4.021">actually a good one and some good news</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="4.98">in the vaccine fight and this one has to</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="6.21">do with a state legislature bill that</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="5.07">was denied it was rejected and they were</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="3.18">trying to bring forth mandatory</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="4.08">vaccinations they were trying to remove</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.699">exemptions and forced school children to</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="4.92">get vaccinated that failed in New Jersey</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="5.25">this week so let&amp;#39;s dig into this story</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="5.85">as you know states around the country in</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="4.971">the last few months they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="169.83" dur="6.989">to repeal vaccine exemptions so</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="7.18">Washington State Oregon Cali Colorado</text>
  <text start="176.819" dur="5.431">New Jersey New York you know</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="4.92">unfortunately it seems to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="4.409">blue states left-leaning states that are</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="5.73">trying to remove vaccine exemptions I</text>
  <text start="186.659" dur="5.091">guess a lot of those left wingers trust</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="6.18">our government way more than they should</text>
  <text start="191.75" dur="6.31">but nevertheless a lot of states trying</text>
  <text start="196.44" dur="3.39">to remove exemptions whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="3.509">philosophical exemptions whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="3.829">religious exemptions they&amp;#39;re dress</text>
  <text start="201.569" dur="5.011">trying to get their freaking people</text>
  <text start="203.659" dur="6.16">vaccinated mandatorily and it&amp;#39;s awful</text>
  <text start="206.58" dur="5.629">and in New Jersey they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="209.819" dur="5.011">bring forth what&amp;#39;s probably the most</text>
  <text start="212.209" dur="5.351">strictest vaccine law in the country</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="6.239">that&amp;#39;s removing religious exemptions it</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="5.399">past their house legislature moved on to</text>
  <text start="221.069" dur="4.041">a vote in the Senate two or three days</text>
  <text start="222.959" dur="5.28">ago it was voted on in the Senate and</text>
  <text start="225.11" dur="7.299">when that vote happened there were</text>
  <text start="228.239" dur="6.121">hundreds if not thousands of protesters</text>
  <text start="232.409" dur="3.991">people who wanted the truth about</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="4.59">vaccines out there who opposed this bill</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="5.369">they descended upon the New Jersey State</text>
  <text start="238.95" dur="5.369">Capitol to voice their concerns and they</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="5.011">were loud they were very loud they were</text>
  <text start="244.319" dur="6.06">very well organized very well informed</text>
  <text start="246.78" dur="6.36">and get this that vaccine law did not</text>
  <text start="250.379" dur="6.6">have enough votes to pass the New Jersey</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="6.089">State Senate it stumbled boom killed</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="4.591">well actually it hasn&amp;#39;t been killed</text>
  <text start="259.229" dur="4.561">the final vote I believe is gonna happen</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.05">on like January 9th with this bill but</text>
  <text start="263.79" dur="2.5">nevertheless they&amp;#39;re Senate not enough</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="3.37">votes</text>
  <text start="266.29" dur="5.7">to progress it so the hundreds if not</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="6.33">thousands of protesters that were there</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="5.67">I mean it worked it worked they voiced</text>
  <text start="275.32" dur="3.48">their opposition&amp;#39;s the legislators were</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="3.09">like oh my god there&amp;#39;s too many people</text>
  <text start="278.8" dur="4.17">here I can&amp;#39;t vote in support of this</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="4.73">they&amp;#39;re all outside my frigging office</text>
  <text start="282.97" dur="6.39">and they&amp;#39;re all pissed off right now</text>

  <text start="296.17" dur="3.45">whatever the case is if you want the</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="4.35">truth about anything from our government</text>

  <text start="302.26" dur="4.95">anti-vaxxers here really The X Factor&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="830.81" dur="5.34">still believe what comes from the FDA</text>
  <text start="832.94" dur="4.95">blows my mind like oh the FDA putting</text>
  <text start="836.15" dur="5.76">out put out a warning letter about this</text>
