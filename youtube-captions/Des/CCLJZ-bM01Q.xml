  <text start="75.9" dur="3.93">gonna do two this one I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="5.46">discuss how Pizza Gate and how these</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="5.49">pedophile arrests tie in specifically to</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="4.83">the UFO and extraterrestrial disclosure</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="4.17">issue because we tend to have very</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="3.24">compartmentalized Minds very left brain</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="3.57">Minds because that&amp;#39;s how our human</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="3.989">farmers groom us they want they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="4.23">want us to think holistically and to put</text>
  <text start="95.189" dur="3.18">things together but that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="97.29" dur="4.17">trying to do in these videos for you</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.261">guys try to piece things together so</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m gonna do in that video</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="4.949">because the extra-terrestrial issue is</text>
  <text start="106.11" dur="4.53">directly tied into this Pizza Gate issue</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="5.61">and not a lot of people are quite aware</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="4.769">how so I&amp;#39;ll tell you about that anyway</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="4.951">moving on we&amp;#39;ve had some more arrests</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="4.591">right and I found an article from neon</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="3.269">metal that knew that alternative news</text>
  <text start="120" dur="3.03">organization which is pretty big that</text>
  <text start="121.409" dur="2.67">500,000 likes on Facebook so it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="4.439">cool that they&amp;#39;re covering some</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="4.71">pedophile RS anyway they that article</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="2.581">that I&amp;#39;ll link down below is discussing</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="4.981">something that occurred a couple days</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="5.97">ago where the FBI pulled an opera</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="4.65">called Operation Cupid&amp;#39;s arrow and they</text>
  <text start="136.02" dur="5.6">arrested 12 people around the country</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="5.28">now 12 people I know that&amp;#39;s not quite a</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="4.24">quantity thing we quite desire but</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="4.08">sometimes quality is a little better in</text>
  <text start="145.86" dur="4.08">quantity and we&amp;#39;ve already had quantity</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="3.36">right 1,500 people of the lower level</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="4.62">operations rounded up in like three</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="4.98">weeks that&amp;#39;s quite a bit and these ones</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="4.08">though only twelve people but the</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="4.05">quality is what&amp;#39;s crucial here because</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;ll just name three of the people and</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="4.11">what they do real quick one guy&amp;#39;s name</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="3.87">Dayton Cramer he was actually an army</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="5.28">colonel and a pretty high attorney at</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="5.79">Florida State University this weirdo was</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="4.14">caught and William Hall who was a</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="3.12">medical director and actually a doctor</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="4.16">in my home state of washing in here and</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="5.73">then lastly a third person Michael</text>
  <text start="177.86" dur="6.07">chmielewskij say his name but this guy</text>
  <text start="181.11" dur="4.32">was actually a student in Florida he</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="5.79">worked at the House of Representatives</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="5.67">and he oversaw like some teenage camp</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="3.36">program or something like that so he was</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="4.59">encountering a couple hundred kids per</text>
  <text start="193.08" dur="4.02">year so these are three people of the 12</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="3.45">that were rounded up</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="3.75">but imagine right what what are the</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="5.31">what&amp;#39;s the information we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="5.28">from them so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s notable here</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="3.03">sometimes quality is better in quantity</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="3.63">remember just last week we had</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="4.26">what&amp;#39;s-his-name alderman Thomas Katz Ian</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="3.78">tonus rounded up the dude the owed three</text>
  <text start="211.74" dur="4.38">Pizza Shops in New Hampshire and was</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="5.1">actually on the state of Representatives</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="4.29">in New Hampshire they completely raided</text>
  <text start="218.64" dur="3.69">his stuff so just imagine what kind of</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="3.12">good information they&amp;#39;re finding so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.33" dur="6.17">just gonna get more exponential from</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="7.95">here next the UK leader this one&amp;#39;s huge</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="6.16">because this one we had a police chief</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="5.729">in the United Kingdom go on record</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="4.17">stating that a former prime minister his</text>
  <text start="237.209" dur="6">name was I have it here I have it here</text>
  <text start="238.83" dur="5.7">Sir Edward Heath hotter he literally</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="3.301">said it&amp;#39;s a hundred and twenty percent</text>
  <text start="244.53" dur="3.81">real but that this dude was a massive</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.979">pedophile and involved in this</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="5.13">Luciferian network we had more than 30</text>
  <text start="251.489" dur="4.741">people come out to this police chief and</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="5.1">state that they were victims of his and</text>
  <text start="256.23" dur="4.229">this guy Edward Heath was directly</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="4.65">connected to Jimmy Savile in the 70s and</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="4.921">80s so this is a big name from overseas</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="3.509">from the UK getting blown up and there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="498.69" dur="3.72">know more dirt on Hillary whatever it</text>
  <text start="500.31" dur="3.81">was basically WikiLeaks was saying don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="502.41" dur="3.06">you try and pull anything with these</text>
  <text start="504.12" dur="3.72">elections or anything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="505.47" dur="4.02">because we got dirt on you and with this</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="3.36">Ecuadorian elections it was so crucial</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="5.63">because the globalist candidate the</text>
  <text start="511.2" dur="6.42">conservative candidate laso I I think</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="4.9">would happened because WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="4.859">released the leak of the CIA meddling at</text>
  <text start="520.02" dur="5.51">foreign elections right just like two</text>
  <text start="522.479" dur="5.341">days ago that was the leak they released</text>
  <text start="525.53" dur="3.64">what I think WikiLeaks was saying is hey</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="2.67">don&amp;#39;t you mess with this Ecuadorian</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="2.88">elections and put your man into place</text>

  <text start="532.05" dur="5.58">right</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="4.68">and the man who actually won it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="4.26">look like there was any meddling in that</text>
  <text start="538.86" dur="4.89">election because the man who won was not</text>
  <text start="541.89" dur="4.35">the conservative globalist candidate but</text>
  <text start="543.75" dur="4.89">the some other guy named like Lenin</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="4.23">Moreno who actually said you know he</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="3">wouldn&amp;#39;t be he wouldn&amp;#39;t be so harsh on</text>
  <text start="550.47" dur="3.69">the song and he would contemplate</text>
