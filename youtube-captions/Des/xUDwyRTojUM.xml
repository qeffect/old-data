  <text start="0.03" dur="3.659">what&amp;#39;s going on guys so I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2.28" dur="3.66">sitting on this interview for a couple</text>
  <text start="3.689" dur="3.931">of weeks now been away been busy but now</text>
  <text start="5.94" dur="3.69">that I&amp;#39;m back home and back to work it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="7.62" dur="4.38">time to put it out and this interview is</text>
  <text start="9.63" dur="4.02">with a dude named anomaly now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="12" dur="2.7">what he goes by on the internet and</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="3">you&amp;#39;ll get to learn a little bit more</text>
  <text start="14.7" dur="4.35">about his backstory in this talk that we</text>
  <text start="16.65" dur="5.58">have but basically what he does now is</text>
  <text start="19.05" dur="5.16">that he utilizes social media just to</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="2.82">get his thoughts out there like many of</text>
  <text start="24.21" dur="3.12">us do</text>
  <text start="25.05" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s a very politically aware dude he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="27.33" dur="4.83">a good guy he&amp;#39;s a smart guy but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="29.76" dur="5.7">skeptical skeptical about one particular</text>
  <text start="32.16" dur="5.46">topic and that is Q now if you know me</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="4.71">and you know my work I&amp;#39;m a cute</text>
  <text start="37.62" dur="5.369">proponent I find a lot of legitimacy in</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="4.889">that particular topic so the goal that</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="5.281">we had in this conversation was to</text>
  <text start="45.059" dur="5.761">really come together and for him to air</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="5.82">a lot of the questions that he had about</text>
  <text start="50.82" dur="6.03">the topic and for me to do the best of</text>
  <text start="54.09" dur="5.01">my ability to answer them he really</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="4.77">plays devil&amp;#39;s advocate a lot for me in</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="5.099">this conversation but really the point</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="4.83">that we tried to do is just simply unify</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="6.03">is to connect because that&amp;#39;s the issue</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="6">that both of us him and I are seeing a</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="4.591">lot in many of these communities is that</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="5.01">just because somebody has a different</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="5.22">belief system a different perspective is</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="3.78">that they tend to shun anybody away that</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="3.99">doesn&amp;#39;t believe the same thing that they</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="5.43">do and you see that&amp;#39;s not progressing us</text>
  <text start="84.03" dur="6.21">through these times in any positive way</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.04">what we need to do is connect is to</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="4.47">bring people together with different</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="5.76">belief systems and not get triggered by</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="4.979">each other but try to find the common</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="4.95">themes the common threads that bind us</text>
  <text start="99.689" dur="6">and then get rid of all the nonsense all</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="6.54">the dogma that isn&amp;#39;t helpful for us non</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="5.341">resourceful okay so anyway I hope you</text>
  <text start="108.96" dur="3.54">guys get a little bit from this</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="3.78">conversation I hope some of it</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="5.159">enlightens you in some way shape or form</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="6.93">because we just kind of have a good time</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="9.71">riffing off each other and finding the</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="5.629">common ground in these topics enjoy</text>

  <text start="184.94" dur="3.18">myself let&amp;#39;s just go through</text>
  <text start="185.99" dur="3.66">introduction so tell us about what you</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="3.84">do on the Internet and how you came to</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="4.59">doing what you do absolutely so I</text>
  <text start="191.96" dur="3.99">started as a hip-hop artist and I had a</text>
  <text start="194.24" dur="3.96">few million views when I was younger</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="3.9">freestyling and stuff and then the</text>

  <text start="199.85" dur="5.25">the news was I started doing that got</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="5.31">like 100 to 300 million views between</text>
  <text start="205.1" dur="4.8">YouTube and Facebook so I guess news</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="4.38">analysts would be the proper term just</text>
  <text start="209.9" dur="4.17">try to go through the news and and weed</text>

  <text start="217.28" dur="4.08">the to the table even with the Q stuff</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ll get it into later but I&amp;#39;m just not</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="3.69">a hater like even people that I dislike</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="3.81">the most I just don&amp;#39;t have that much</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="4.71">hate in my heart so it&amp;#39;s like you could</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="3.99">really tell when people are over hating</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s never a good look and a lot of</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="4.38">times it clouds a good discussion so</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my role here totally you</text>
  <text start="235.55" dur="3.72">can you can feel the ego like drip off</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="4.95">people sometimes and it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.27" dur="4.38">not trying to search for truth or just</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="3.72">search for what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re just trying to cling to whatever</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re thinking about and anybody that</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="5.37">disagrees they they ridicule in there</text>

  <text start="252.98" dur="3.36">a news analyst you call it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="2.97">difficult to describe like people ask</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="3.93">you I&amp;#39;m sure what do you do when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.6" dur="4.86">like I do stuff on the internet I talk</text>

  <text start="284" dur="5.009">process like seven years ago you know I</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="5.31">saw the pharmaceutical side of things</text>
  <text start="289.009" dur="5.101">initially and got some jobs in the</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="4.169">natural health industry and from there</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="4.17">that kind of cracked my consciousness</text>
  <text start="295.939" dur="4.591">and I just went into everything else I</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="3.96">just tried to search for as much as I</text>
  <text start="300.53" dur="3.449">could of what&amp;#39;s really going on the</text>
  <text start="302.24" dur="4.649">truth behind everything not what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.979" dur="6.06">feeding us in the media or in our BS</text>

  <text start="319.94" dur="3.599">years ago that&amp;#39;s when I really stuck my</text>

  <text start="342.68" dur="3.75">get into the discussion like I I was</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="3.359">thinking that you could be like a</text>
  <text start="346.43" dur="4.68">devil&amp;#39;s advocate here and go through</text>
  <text start="348.319" dur="5.431">like your kind of your questions and</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="4.589">your general sent sentiments on the</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="4.949">whole Q issue absolutely</text>
  <text start="355.699" dur="4.351">yeah well started off so for me I have</text>
  <text start="358.699" dur="2.761">an interesting perspective because like</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="3">you said either people are obsessed with</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="3.269">it I joke around I say it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="363.05" dur="3.69">religion and it&amp;#39;s definitely like a</text>
  <text start="364.729" dur="3.84">cult-like following not even in a bad</text>
  <text start="366.74" dur="3.599">way just anybody that&amp;#39;s really popular</text>
  <text start="368.569" dur="3.541">you know can can get that type of</text>
  <text start="370.339" dur="4.08">falling behind it and I would say the Q</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="5.519">following is that powerful it&amp;#39;s huge its</text>
  <text start="374.419" dur="4.951">enormous and I don&amp;#39;t hate on it as far</text>
  <text start="377.629" dur="4.38">as like some people it does it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="5.219">real its fake and I mean I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.009" dur="4.681">a really weak analysis I know these you</text>
  <text start="384.589" dur="4.17">know maybe good people but it&amp;#39;s week</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="3.96">because there&amp;#39;s authentic information</text>
  <text start="388.759" dur="3.87">there that you could research and look</text>
  <text start="390.65" dur="4.169">up and there&amp;#39;s articles and documents so</text>
  <text start="392.629" dur="3.84">to say the whole thing is fake doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="394.819" dur="2.31">make sense to me because you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="396.469" dur="2.34">looking at these</text>
  <text start="397.129" dur="3">articles an information and it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="398.809" dur="4.711">links up with stuff that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="400.129" dur="5.16">physically and like visibly there so to</text>
  <text start="403.52" dur="3.719">call the cue movement fake I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.289" dur="3.83">understand people like that that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="407.239" dur="4.26">I wanted to do this talk but as far as</text>
  <text start="409.119" dur="4.6">not just the information just the</text>
  <text start="411.499" dur="4.41">movement I&amp;#39;m not only skeptical but I</text>
  <text start="413.719" dur="3.331">see both sides kind of maybe go in a</text>
  <text start="415.909" dur="3.6">direction that I&amp;#39;m not totally</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.919">comfortable with so I guess my</text>
  <text start="419.509" dur="5.041">skepticism with the cue stuff starts</text>
  <text start="421.969" dur="6.51">with a lot of the information I think is</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="6.149">is very very valid stuff that even has</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="3.78">been around for a while stuff that has</text>
  <text start="430.699" dur="4.381">people have been deep dive and looking</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="5.25">at stuff but I see the movement you</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="3.989">would say it started as okay this is a</text>
  <text start="437.509" dur="3.21">guy he&amp;#39;s in that maybe the Trump</text>
  <text start="439.069" dur="4.171">administration some people think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.719" dur="4.141">high-level some people not so sure but</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="3.419">the general consensus I&amp;#39;m getting from</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="3.719">you and other people is it&amp;#39;s not one</text>
  <text start="446.659" dur="3.3">person it&amp;#39;s the whole movement am i</text>
  <text start="448.579" dur="3.11">correct you know it&amp;#39;s that now it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="449.959" dur="5.1">research team it&amp;#39;s an entire movement</text>
  <text start="451.689" dur="5.02">right well totally and I think we have</text>
  <text start="455.059" dur="3.48">to break this up into a few separate</text>
  <text start="456.709" dur="4.46">topics so the first one we started off</text>
  <text start="458.539" dur="4.94">with was the cult-like following and</text>
  <text start="461.169" dur="6.04">you&amp;#39;re right like they&amp;#39;re totally is</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="5.71">somewhat of a cult-like sentiment behind</text>
  <text start="467.209" dur="5.1">the whole issue but I think that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.189" dur="5.49">stem from hue itself nor the postings</text>
  <text start="472.309" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s just kind of the the way we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="474.679" dur="3.6">programmed and programmed for thousands</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="4.74">of years really</text>
  <text start="478.279" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;ve always been societally ingrained</text>
  <text start="482.089" dur="4.47">to worship to worship a deity to want to</text>
  <text start="484.879" dur="3.21">be saved and that&amp;#39;s been from our</text>
  <text start="486.559" dur="3.991">cultural engineers they want to take</text>
  <text start="488.089" dur="5.28">away our ability to be you know free</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="4.409">sovereign free thinking beams so whether</text>
  <text start="493.369" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s a religion whether it&amp;#39;s science</text>
  <text start="494.959" dur="3.06">whether it&amp;#39;s this person or this book</text>
  <text start="497.089" dur="3.961">where the case is</text>
  <text start="498.019" dur="4.68">you know worships something so a lot of</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="3.389">the followers yes it&amp;#39;s just like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.699" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s difficult for us to break out of</text>
  <text start="504.439" dur="4.2">that tendency do you know so you kind of</text>
  <text start="506.269" dur="5.25">have to separate the followers from the</text>
  <text start="508.639" dur="5.76">queue op itself in this instance in take</text>
  <text start="511.519" dur="6.42">an objective look at them and then when</text>
  <text start="514.399" dur="7.38">discussing queue itself you know rather</text>
  <text start="517.939" dur="5.22">than thinking of it being one person</text>
  <text start="521.779" dur="3.78">because you&amp;#39;re right if someone&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="523.159" dur="4.62">say he or this person high-level</text>
  <text start="525.559" dur="4.501">official yada yada I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="527.779" dur="3.871">like to think of it as a who I think</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="4.92">much more beneficial to think of it as a</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="6.72">what what is Q it&amp;#39;s an operation it was</text>
  <text start="534.98" dur="7.89">the thing that was began you know near</text>

  <text start="563.51" dur="6.48">maybe make them make a bad move so I</text>
  <text start="566.83" dur="6.1">don&amp;#39;t want people to think that the</text>
  <text start="569.99" dur="4.41">cult-like mindset the very emotional</text>
  <text start="572.93" dur="3.27">mindset because a lot of the followers</text>

  <text start="576.2" dur="5.52">very traumatized as well and being</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="3.84">conspiracy theorists a lot of you know</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="4.59">us conspiracy theorists were ridiculed</text>
  <text start="583.46" dur="5.28">and and be riddled so much that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.31" dur="4.08">like it&amp;#39;s this desire in people to like</text>

  <text start="593.57" dur="3.93">I call out the left I call out a</text>
  <text start="594.98" dur="4.71">republican sometimes and and my call out</text>
  <text start="597.5" dur="4.11">of the Q movement like I said it before</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="4.41">we even dive into the information and</text>
  <text start="601.61" dur="3.69">decodes is that now that it&amp;#39;s a movement</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="2.82">like you&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s a following</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="3.36">people&amp;#39;s emotions are behind it they</text>
  <text start="606.92" dur="3.63">have years of being ridiculed and now</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="4.679">the conspiracy theorists are looking</text>
  <text start="610.55" dur="5.1">less foolish every day and it is quite</text>
  <text start="613.339" dur="4.321">nice to people who&amp;#39;ve been yelled at and</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="4.08">ridiculed their whole ass but the</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="4.74">movement itself kind of and even</text>
  <text start="619.73" dur="4.5">yourself you know say q will say actors</text>
  <text start="622.4" dur="4.5">will act it&amp;#39;s a very very broad</text>
  <text start="624.23" dur="4.26">statement and then now the movement is Q</text>
  <text start="626.9" dur="3.3">as well so that people have to be held</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="3.63">accountable for the direction they go in</text>
  <text start="630.2" dur="3.75">it so they assess actors will act and</text>
  <text start="632.12" dur="3.78">you say and a lot of people say well</text>
  <text start="633.95" dur="5.46">Alex Jones as an actor you don&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="635.9" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s an op he&amp;#39;s a PSYOP but Q never</text>
  <text start="639.41" dur="4.5">said that but now the whole Q movement</text>
  <text start="641.45" dur="5.25">in this co life following is using that</text>
  <text start="643.91" dur="5.58">to go out say Alex Jones and Infowars</text>
  <text start="646.7" dur="5.22">where Alex Jones and Infowars albeit</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="3.719">very animated very confusing to be</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="3">honest I have a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="653.209" dur="4.291">like is it real is it not are they</text>
  <text start="654.92" dur="4.44">psyops are they not the skepticism is</text>
  <text start="657.5" dur="4.53">fine but I think taking those messages</text>
  <text start="659.36" dur="3.88">and weaponizing them against Infowars as</text>
  <text start="662.03" dur="3.369">they&amp;#39;re getting banned off</text>
  <text start="663.24" dur="3.87">social media and the irony kind of</text>
  <text start="665.399" dur="4.111">behind that is a lot of the stuff that Q</text>
  <text start="667.11" dur="4.74">saying is stuff that Alex Jones said ten</text>
  <text start="669.51" dur="3.48">years ago in a different format he is</text>
  <text start="671.85" dur="2.58">all over the place</text>
  <text start="672.99" dur="3.51">there is certain things that he won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.43" dur="4.77">talk about like you said but he also</text>
  <text start="676.5" dur="4.2">gets sued dozens of times you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="679.2" dur="3.09">never been on the show they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="680.7" dur="3.99">really reached out to me as far as like</text>
  <text start="682.29" dur="4.23">seeing my working stuff but listening to</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="4.47">them for ten years on and off not</text>
  <text start="686.52" dur="5.069">everyday or else I probably go crazy but</text>
  <text start="689.16" dur="4.32">you know to take these q messages and</text>
  <text start="691.589" dur="3.961">then weaponize them against people who</text>
  <text start="693.48" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t agree with it I think that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="695.55" dur="2.61">of become a big problem in the Q</text>
  <text start="696.87" dur="2.76">movement cuz Q never said anything about</text>
  <text start="698.16" dur="4.65">Alex Jones but I think you and a lot of</text>
  <text start="699.63" dur="4.8">people are young to think he&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="702.81" dur="4.2">number one person to take down but I</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="5.88">think he&amp;#39;s saying a lot of the stuff Q</text>
  <text start="707.01" dur="4.829">says in different ways may be right so</text>
  <text start="710.31" dur="4.44">cool man</text>
  <text start="711.839" dur="5.701">I would say think of thinking of it as a</text>
  <text start="714.75" dur="3.839">movement is such a general statement you</text>
  <text start="717.54" dur="3">know we really have to pick out</text>
  <text start="718.589" dur="3.451">particular we have to get individual</text>
  <text start="720.54" dur="4.26">with this we have to look just at the</text>
  <text start="722.04" dur="5.609">individual what they&amp;#39;re saying and what</text>
  <text start="724.8" dur="5.94">their motives behind that might be cuz</text>
  <text start="727.649" dur="5.581">to say like a movement you can easily</text>
  <text start="730.74" dur="4.23">categorize certain people into that same</text>
  <text start="733.23" dur="5.07">movement just because they talk about Q</text>
  <text start="734.97" dur="4.89">and but you say you I&amp;#39;m pretty emetic I</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="3.9">think you and paramedic you look at your</text>
  <text start="739.86" dur="4.38">timeline or his YouTube entire channel</text>
  <text start="742.2" dur="4.32">is about Q most of your timeline is</text>
  <text start="744.24" dur="5.159">about Q so you guys are leaders of the</text>
  <text start="746.52" dur="5.189">movement people look to you to decode so</text>
  <text start="749.399" dur="4.68">if you decode it and use it to weaponize</text>
  <text start="751.709" dur="3.991">against Alex Jones who&amp;#39;s saying the same</text>
  <text start="754.079" dur="3.721">right yeah at what point does that</text>
  <text start="755.7" dur="3.93">become a problem I&amp;#39;m but our we stand</text>
  <text start="757.8" dur="3.87">are we saying that we&amp;#39;re the leaders of</text>
  <text start="759.63" dur="6.06">the movement or are people just thinking</text>
  <text start="761.67" dur="6.27">we are that&amp;#39;s my skepticism with q2 did</text>
  <text start="765.69" dur="3.089">he yeah did he make this movement did he</text>
  <text start="767.94" dur="2.91">say I&amp;#39;m the leader</text>
  <text start="768.779" dur="3.75">he started posting and it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="4.2">just formed around I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="772.529" dur="5.101">ever said like hey read everything I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="775.05" dur="4.44">saying this is gospel this is the</text>
  <text start="777.63" dur="4.44">message like he just posted in very</text>
  <text start="779.49" dur="4.2">genius level coding and then it grew and</text>
  <text start="782.07" dur="3.75">grew so it&amp;#39;s not saying it&amp;#39;s your fault</text>
  <text start="783.69" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s not praying Metis fault it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="785.82" dur="5.04">whoever Q is fault but if you really</text>
  <text start="788.82" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s like Republicans conservatives you</text>
  <text start="790.86" dur="5.789">know it is now as a group that is very</text>
  <text start="793.41" dur="5.729">tribal and very hostile to</text>
  <text start="796.649" dur="5.011">to anybody outside of it say James and</text>
  <text start="799.139" dur="4.5">that conversations like this are needed</text>
  <text start="801.66" dur="6.359">because it does need to be called out it</text>
  <text start="803.639" dur="6.93">absolutely and called out the the just</text>
  <text start="808.019" dur="5.641">that division I mean a lot of people I</text>
  <text start="810.569" dur="4.62">see even in the that followed queue and</text>
  <text start="813.66" dur="3.719">post about queue it&amp;#39;s like why are you</text>
  <text start="815.189" dur="4.111">being so violent with your words and</text>
  <text start="817.379" dur="6.091">your your emotion you&amp;#39;re putting out</text>
  <text start="819.3" dur="5.399">there rather than staying calm and</text>
  <text start="823.47" dur="2.729">grounded and looking at things</text>
  <text start="824.699" dur="3.541">objectively that&amp;#39;s the biggest thing</text>
  <text start="826.199" dur="5.43">here and and that&amp;#39;s something that in</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="6.599">these queue drops that&amp;#39;s been put out</text>
  <text start="831.629" dur="6.87">that continuously say look at things</text>
  <text start="834.839" dur="5.821">objectively and question them okay so we</text>
  <text start="838.499" dur="3.96">mentioned Infowars a lot and one thing</text>
  <text start="840.66" dur="3.659">you know I I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s the number</text>
  <text start="842.459" dur="4.68">one person to take down by any means it</text>
  <text start="844.319" dur="3.93">just happens to be in the news and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.139" dur="3.151">do you know what I&amp;#39;m saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.249" dur="4.291">being d platform god I totally get where</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="5.399">today now you&amp;#39;re using your movement to</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="4.889">kind of lobby against him so sorry I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="855.689" dur="4.89">not using my movement at all I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="857.429" dur="5.041">simply saying like okay let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s look</text>
  <text start="860.579" dur="4.85">at this objectively like with the</text>
  <text start="862.47" dur="8.729">Infowars platform there was definitely a</text>
  <text start="865.429" dur="7.991">sort of narrative skew where they for</text>
  <text start="871.199" dur="4.021">instance I was on Infowars in November</text>
  <text start="873.42" dur="6.089">one of their radio programs a war room</text>
  <text start="875.22" dur="6.9">to discuss queue and I did it was a</text>
  <text start="879.509" dur="4.531">great talk they were very respectful it</text>
  <text start="882.12" dur="3.719">was cool but was Rindge interesting is</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="4.5">it when I went back on two more times</text>
  <text start="885.839" dur="4.081">never a word about that there was never</text>
  <text start="888.54" dur="3.359">a word about keyword talked about the</text>
  <text start="889.92" dur="4.709">seeker space program and then censorship</text>
  <text start="891.899" dur="4.831">about month or two later and they</text>
  <text start="894.629" dur="3.75">suddenly started going along with this</text>
  <text start="896.73" dur="3.419">queue thing in December bringing their</text>
  <text start="898.379" dur="5.64">own high level insider and it was this</text>
  <text start="900.149" dur="6.331">dude that called Zach and sort of using</text>
  <text start="904.019" dur="4.771">that narrative to just do particular</text>
  <text start="906.48" dur="6">things either insert their own false</text>
  <text start="908.79" dur="6.419">authority or sell books or whatever the</text>
  <text start="912.48" dur="7.199">case is you know so it was a very kind</text>
  <text start="915.209" dur="6.391">of obvious bait and switch now taking a</text>
  <text start="919.679" dur="3.75">lot of people to though like Alex yeah</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="3.87">the weirdest interviewers I&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="923.429" dur="3.78">to be honest even oh and I love Alex and</text>
  <text start="925.47" dur="3.63">Owen for what they do but when they have</text>
  <text start="927.209" dur="3.12">people on their heart like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.1" dur="3.269">always interrupting and</text>
  <text start="930.329" dur="3.961">are always like pushing the agenda of</text>
  <text start="932.369" dur="3.96">whatever they&amp;#39;re doing you know that and</text>
  <text start="934.29" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s uh taking the objective look at</text>
  <text start="936.329" dur="7.591">their information there&amp;#39;s I just think</text>
  <text start="940.47" dur="7.489">there&amp;#39;s very big questions as to why the</text>
  <text start="943.92" dur="7.259">censorship is occurring now why you know</text>
  <text start="947.959" dur="4.63">if it&amp;#39;s not full-scale if they really</text>
  <text start="951.179" dur="2.7">wanted to deep platform them why not</text>
  <text start="952.589" dur="3.78">take their app down</text>
  <text start="953.879" dur="4.5">why was aq app taken down and not theirs</text>
  <text start="956.369" dur="3.72">why is their newsletter you know getting</text>
  <text start="958.379" dur="6.411">millions of people it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s as if this</text>
  <text start="960.089" dur="7.141">it was a Streisand effect to take</text>
  <text start="964.79" dur="5.589">obvious attention away from other things</text>
  <text start="967.23" dur="5.579">but then again let&amp;#39;s just look at this</text>
  <text start="970.379" dur="5.43">historically that is talked for what ten</text>
  <text start="972.809" dur="4.2">twenty years there&amp;#39;s a lot more you</text>
  <text start="975.809" dur="3.78">could have done and could have gone into</text>
  <text start="977.009" dur="5.101">and he could have been silenced far far</text>
  <text start="979.589" dur="5.28">before this you know he&amp;#39;s been a he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="982.11" dur="5.49">been sued dozens of times so it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="984.869" dur="4.59">Alex as far as people are like why</text>
  <text start="987.6" dur="3.899">doesn&amp;#39;t he say certain things like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="989.459" dur="3.78">easy for me or you to say that because</text>
  <text start="991.499" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;ve never been sued based on something</text>
  <text start="993.239" dur="4.051">I&amp;#39;ve said to this point and I&amp;#39;m praying</text>
  <text start="994.829" dur="4.68">it doesn&amp;#39;t happen cuz ring my whole life</text>
  <text start="997.29" dur="3.57">change is very alleged behind like</text>
  <text start="999.509" dur="3.39">everything you say and you&amp;#39;ll be cool</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s what I try to say reported or</text>
  <text start="1002.899" dur="4.23">legend but Alex get suit all the time</text>
  <text start="1004.999" dur="3.721">and here&amp;#39;s my here&amp;#39;s my analysis of it</text>
  <text start="1007.129" dur="5.4">and you could you can say your piece as</text>
  <text start="1008.72" dur="5.94">well but say Alex Jack PO say big for</text>
  <text start="1012.529" dur="4.951">instance who hates Q I think even Scott</text>
  <text start="1014.66" dur="5.759">Scott Adams who&amp;#39;s like oh we debunked it</text>
  <text start="1017.48" dur="3.299">it&amp;#39;s over I like I like that for what</text>
  <text start="1020.419" dur="2.22">they do</text>
  <text start="1020.779" dur="4.02">I don&amp;#39;t specifically agree with them on</text>
  <text start="1022.639" dur="4.111">that cuz I I don&amp;#39;t understand exactly</text>
  <text start="1024.799" dur="5.461">what they&amp;#39;re saying to be out like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1026.75" dur="5.159">not resonating with me but my thought is</text>
  <text start="1030.26" dur="4.199">like you know I&amp;#39;ll see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1031.909" dur="3.99">the second it happened to me I think you</text>
  <text start="1034.459" dur="2.82">feel certainly about a lot of people a</text>
  <text start="1035.899" dur="3.24">lot of cube because they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1037.279" dur="3">passionate about it but the second you</text>
  <text start="1039.139" dur="3.121">disagree with it they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1040.279" dur="4.05">debunk it look you&amp;#39;re an agent you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1042.26" dur="2.309">fake you&amp;#39;re CIA agent you&amp;#39;re this you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1044.329" dur="2.73">that</text>
  <text start="1044.569" dur="4.74">yeah my thought is like Jack Passaic and</text>
  <text start="1047.059" dur="3.72">Alex I don&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;re agents I</text>
  <text start="1049.309" dur="3.181">don&amp;#39;t think that they&amp;#39;re agents I just</text>
  <text start="1050.779" dur="3.451">think they really don&amp;#39;t like you but</text>
  <text start="1052.49" dur="3.299">they&amp;#39;re really good at doing other stuff</text>
  <text start="1054.23" dur="3.48">and you know where&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1055.789" dur="4.62">he hit it&amp;#39;s not a black or white world</text>
  <text start="1057.71" dur="4.949">it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s truly about their own</text>
  <text start="1060.409" dur="3.751">perspective so like you said you know</text>

  <text start="1177.92" dur="4.02">just got doing is he part of this</text>
  <text start="1179.42" dur="4.35">operation or not but I also think it is</text>
  <text start="1181.94" dur="3.78">dangerous in the sense of like a lot of</text>
  <text start="1183.77" dur="3.54">stuff that cusing whether it be</text>
  <text start="1185.72" dur="3.48">authentic or not that&amp;#39;s for the people</text>
  <text start="1187.31" dur="3.9">to decide but it&amp;#39;s similar stuff that</text>
  <text start="1189.2" dur="4.38">alex has been saying for for ten years</text>
  <text start="1191.21" dur="4.41">now and it&amp;#39;s like the stuff he&amp;#39;s done he</text>

  <text start="1195.62" dur="3.54">every content creator to even be here</text>
  <text start="1197.75" dur="2.7">like he was the first one so I think</text>
  <text start="1199.16" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s just kind of dangerous that</text>
  <text start="1200.45" dur="4.5">everyone hates everyone who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1202.55" dur="4.14">agree with Q but that I mean exacts</text>
  <text start="1204.95" dur="4.47">conservative that&amp;#39;s Democrat that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1214.52" dur="5.61">like that that&amp;#39;s my my main concern is</text>

  <text start="1244.94" dur="3.63">got to understand like I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>

  <text start="1317.15" dur="4.08">talk about black project information he</text>
  <text start="1319.52" dur="4.2">has been the most vague person this is</text>
  <text start="1321.23" dur="4.11">one thing that I was like I think</text>
  <text start="1323.72" dur="4.26">something&amp;#39;s wrong with these two when</text>
  <text start="1325.34" dur="6.24">the spaceforce announcement came out say</text>

  <text start="1358.1" dur="4.62">why wouldn&amp;#39;t have me on why do they have</text>
  <text start="1359.929" dur="5.011">to create their own narrative not just</text>

  <text start="1364.94" dur="7.26">we could yeah does this and and whatnot</text>
  <text start="1369.59" dur="4.709">but we just have to look at people for</text>

  <text start="1374.299" dur="6.81">time because it&amp;#39;s uh there&amp;#39;s so much out</text>
  <text start="1376.73" dur="6.99">there that uh it&amp;#39;s uh you can find truth</text>

  <text start="1393.499" dur="5.61">perspective elsewhere I feel you on that</text>
  <text start="1396.47" dur="5.88">I think you&amp;#39;re right about you know</text>
  <text start="1399.109" dur="6.66">people not saying certain things but my</text>
  <text start="1402.35" dur="6.299">thoughts on that is like Alex and myself</text>
  <text start="1405.769" dur="4.711">I get accused or Alex I&amp;#39;ve seen he gets</text>
  <text start="1408.649" dur="3.99">accused of being a Zionist because he</text>

  <text start="1420.95" dur="3.87">that level as far as like as big as Alex</text>

  <text start="1588.38" dur="4.2">proof is there that if you think you</text>
  <text start="1590.69" dur="3.45">think he is I guess that&amp;#39;s another since</text>
  <text start="1592.58" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re getting the skeptics of Q out I</text>
  <text start="1594.14" dur="4.98">think I think it&amp;#39;s someone very</text>

  <text start="1599.12" dur="3.72">biggest hater on the left they have to</text>
  <text start="1600.77" dur="4.32">admit the coating and the genius behind</text>
  <text start="1602.84" dur="4.14">the whole holy this plan has been</text>
  <text start="1605.09" dur="5.91">in the works from a group of brilliant</text>
  <text start="1606.98" dur="6.87">minds for more maybe what technologies</text>
  <text start="1611" dur="4.74">have access to two but I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1613.85" dur="3.81">personally not convinced and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1615.74" dur="4.56">talking and I think you&amp;#39;re one of the</text>
  <text start="1617.66" dur="5.34">brightest in that category so maybe you</text>
  <text start="1620.3" dur="5.37">can convince me oh I&amp;#39;m not convinced</text>
  <text start="1623" dur="5.07">that it&amp;#39;s not just some smart guy really</text>
  <text start="1625.67" dur="5.67">smart guy in this basement or in his</text>
  <text start="1628.07" dur="4.92">loft you know not to discredit that just</text>
  <text start="1631.34" dur="3.45">does a lot of deep research because I</text>
  <text start="1632.99" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ve been listening to people like David</text>
  <text start="1634.79" dur="4.26">Icke II Alex Jones you know Robert Anton</text>
  <text start="1637.28" dur="3.66">Wilson all of these people for years</text>
  <text start="1639.05" dur="4.56">where I don&amp;#39;t agree with them on</text>
  <text start="1640.94" dur="4.32">everything I feel very intriguing and I</text>
  <text start="1643.61" dur="4.8">find them very intelligent and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1645.26" dur="5.79">reading i reading i cos like wow he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1648.41" dur="4.2">great but he doesn&amp;#39;t like trump and you</text>
  <text start="1651.05" dur="3.39">know certain things he says i&amp;#39;m not so</text>
  <text start="1652.61" dur="3.69">sure but i don&amp;#39;t understand why people</text>
  <text start="1654.44" dur="3.48">hate so hard they just block it out I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1656.3" dur="4.23">like really and that&amp;#39;s an idea we</text>
  <text start="1657.92" dur="5.07">shouldn&amp;#39;t idolize anybody out there and</text>
  <text start="1660.53" dur="3.81">and just look at the information that</text>
  <text start="1662.99" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re putting out and the same thing</text>
  <text start="1664.34" dur="4.35">you know you look at as many as you can</text>
  <text start="1666.41" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t believe any of it and you just see</text>
  <text start="1668.69" dur="4.02">you see what patterns start going</text>
  <text start="1670.55" dur="4.5">through what writing is possible that</text>
  <text start="1672.71" dur="4.59">cute cuz I don&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;m thinking Q</text>
  <text start="1675.05" dur="5.129">is just somebody doing a lot of research</text>
  <text start="1677.3" dur="4.53">you don&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m not fully convinced I</text>
  <text start="1680.179" dur="3.811">see the Q in the background out there</text>
  <text start="1681.83" dur="3.81">but I&amp;#39;m not convinced that he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1683.99" dur="4.02">deep intelligence or in the Trump</text>
  <text start="1685.64" dur="4.62">administration you know there&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="1688.01" dur="4.11">and I&amp;#39;m not so I&amp;#39;m not really sold on</text>
  <text start="1690.26" dur="4.14">this answer but similar to how you say</text>
  <text start="1692.12" dur="4.38">maybe Alex or Jack would be a you know</text>
  <text start="1694.4" dur="4.86">like pseudo like halfway there</text>
  <text start="1696.5" dur="3.51">misleading type people some people think</text>
  <text start="1699.26" dur="2.49">that&amp;#39;s cute</text>
  <text start="1700.01" dur="3.81">and like here&amp;#39;s my last question I know</text>
  <text start="1701.75" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s like a double apart if sessions</text>
  <text start="1703.82" dur="3.45">gets fired</text>
  <text start="1705.23" dur="3.54">would that discredit the whole Q thing</text>
  <text start="1707.27" dur="3.51">because I know used to stress sessions a</text>
  <text start="1708.77" dur="3.48">lot because I heard some people say well</text>
  <text start="1710.78" dur="3">know that then it like if people are</text>
  <text start="1712.25" dur="3.27">doing backflips like no then it means</text>
  <text start="1713.78" dur="5.22">that he&amp;#39;s really doing this and then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1715.52" dur="5.43">like okay we&amp;#39;ll see cool man yeah well</text>
  <text start="1719" dur="6.6">the first part of it I would say the way</text>
  <text start="1720.95" dur="6.45">that they have established legitimacy to</text>
  <text start="1725.6" dur="3.93">this operation since the beginning since</text>
  <text start="1727.4" dur="3.75">it started in October last year was</text>
  <text start="1729.53" dur="3.6">through confirmations in foreknowledge</text>
  <text start="1731.15" dur="3.9">like obviously putting out</text>
  <text start="1733.13" dur="4.32">information like this you have to</text>
  <text start="1735.05" dur="5.6">establish it legitimately so legitimacy</text>
  <text start="1737.45" dur="6.06">of it so people would see it and and</text>
  <text start="1740.65" dur="4.51">give their energy into it well we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1743.51" dur="3.18">confirmation since the beginning and</text>
  <text start="1745.16" dur="3.09">we&amp;#39;re still getting them in these</text>
  <text start="1746.69" dur="3.33">confirmations in the beginning they were</text>
  <text start="1748.25" dur="4.35">very subtle much more subtle than they</text>
  <text start="1750.02" dur="6.51">were now for instance in the beginning</text>
  <text start="1752.6" dur="5.79">it was pluses in Trump&amp;#39;s tweet that Q</text>
  <text start="1756.53" dur="5.31">posted like seven minutes beforehand</text>
  <text start="1758.39" dur="4.92">three three pluses in a cryptic drop and</text>
  <text start="1761.84" dur="4.95">then we see that connection or for</text>
  <text start="1763.31" dur="5.04">instance Q posts a photograph and then a</text>
  <text start="1766.79" dur="3.33">couple hours later the Department of</text>
  <text start="1768.35" dur="3.24">Defense Twitter page posts the exact</text>
  <text start="1770.12" dur="4.37">same photograph I mean there were plenty</text>
  <text start="1771.59" dur="8.13">of these that we could reference and</text>
  <text start="1774.49" dur="7.69">until now since the Q idea is blowing up</text>
  <text start="1779.72" dur="5.31">so much into the mainstream into the</text>
  <text start="1782.18" dur="4.65">media that the confirmations had to get</text>
  <text start="1785.03" dur="4.2">kind of more obvious because so many</text>
  <text start="1786.83" dur="4.55">more eyes so many more of course people</text>
  <text start="1789.23" dur="4.5">become acceptable and they&amp;#39;ve become</text>
  <text start="1791.38" dur="4.24">obvious to a point of like a guy wearing</text>
  <text start="1793.73" dur="5.61">a cute t-shirt at a rally and Trump kind</text>
  <text start="1795.62" dur="5.37">of Trump points right at the guy oh yeah</text>
  <text start="1799.34" dur="3.54">I don&amp;#39;t know if it was like you he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1800.99" dur="3.9">just like my people you know yeah I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1802.88" dur="4.08">seen them but it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1804.89" dur="4.38">people who have predicted things 10</text>
  <text start="1806.96" dur="4.47">years ahead you know just out of their</text>
  <text start="1809.27" dur="4.35">intelligence and their understanding of</text>
  <text start="1811.43" dur="4.41">the world where I&amp;#39;ve seen and I would</text>
  <text start="1813.62" dur="3.99">you know what are the what are the</text>
  <text start="1815.84" dur="5.19">chances though of this going on another</text>
  <text start="1817.61" dur="6.45">one like the motorcade driving by person</text>
  <text start="1821.03" dur="4.56">has honk for Q sign and you know SIA you</text>
  <text start="1824.06" dur="2.94">hear a hawk from the motorcade right</text>
  <text start="1825.59" dur="4.35">when they&amp;#39;re driving by I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1827" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s so many of them there&amp;#39;s that the</text>
  <text start="1829.94" dur="6.63">chances are one in what billions</text>
  <text start="1833.12" dur="5.58">trillions of this really happening let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1836.57" dur="4.83">say maybe lower but also you know I</text>
  <text start="1838.7" dur="4.86">think I think Trump jr. and people are</text>
  <text start="1841.4" dur="4.68">very tapped into social media and stuff</text>
  <text start="1843.56" dur="5.16">and to know it is a pro movement I think</text>
  <text start="1846.08" dur="4.56">you know the BQ movement has gotten to</text>
  <text start="1848.72" dur="3.6">the point where it&amp;#39;s a threat to the</text>
  <text start="1850.64" dur="3.84">establishment it&amp;#39;s a threat to the media</text>
  <text start="1852.32" dur="4.56">because you guys are doing all this deep</text>
  <text start="1854.48" dur="4.11">diving research and also you know</text>
  <text start="1856.88" dur="3.51">anybody that doesn&amp;#39;t go along with their</text>
  <text start="1858.59" dur="4.14">narrative in big groups they&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="1860.39" dur="4.41">fan of so you know that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1862.73" dur="4.02">trying to discredit it but also people</text>
  <text start="1864.8" dur="3.57">like Flynn and other people</text>
  <text start="1866.75" dur="3.12">be a combination of hope you know cuz</text>
  <text start="1868.37" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;ve been done so wrong if like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1869.87" dur="3.51">seen him do similar things where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1871.28" dur="4.26">like you know they want to but they want</text>
  <text start="1873.38" dur="3.87">to believe in it or you know like you</text>
  <text start="1875.54" dur="3.27">said it could be I&amp;#39;m not ruling out</text>
  <text start="1877.25" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s the difference specially me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1878.81" dur="3.63">not saying it&amp;#39;s not someone I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1880.73" dur="4.29">skeptical that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1882.44" dur="5.1">like let&amp;#39;s see how it plays out I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1885.02" dur="7.19">like if say sessions if sessions is</text>
  <text start="1887.54" dur="4.67">fired with that would that change things</text>
  <text start="1893.26" dur="4.21">well I don&amp;#39;t know it depends on the</text>
  <text start="1895.28" dur="4.08">context of which sessions got fired in</text>
  <text start="1897.47" dur="5.04">and what else might happen around it you</text>
  <text start="1899.36" dur="7.29">know that&amp;#39;s not to say that this this</text>
  <text start="1902.51" dur="6.3">operation it&amp;#39;s it is genius the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1906.65" dur="4.77">going about but it&amp;#39;s not set in stone</text>
  <text start="1908.81" dur="4.56">you know there&amp;#39;s certain things that are</text>
  <text start="1911.42" dur="5.1">roadblocks I&amp;#39;m sure or things that they</text>
  <text start="1913.37" dur="4.02">would need to overcome would sessions be</text>
  <text start="1916.52" dur="3.57">fired</text>
  <text start="1917.39" dur="4.86">I wouldn&amp;#39;t think sessions would be fired</text>
  <text start="1920.09" dur="4.11">by any means I personally think that</text>
  <text start="1922.25" dur="4.47">what&amp;#39;s going on between Trump and</text>
  <text start="1924.2" dur="5.52">sessions right now is a is very</text>
  <text start="1926.72" dur="5.4">purposeful no I don&amp;#39;t disagree but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1929.72" dur="4.14">like if he did cuz to me you know I</text>
  <text start="1932.12" dur="4.44">think that but if he gets fired</text>
  <text start="1933.86" dur="5.88">I don&amp;#39;t whatever gets impeached yeah</text>
  <text start="1936.56" dur="4.65">what if absolutely we could what if a</text>
  <text start="1939.74" dur="5.16">lot of this so what if Q just stopped</text>
  <text start="1941.21" dur="4.65">posting big would break a lot of hearts</text>
  <text start="1944.9" dur="2.97">out there right</text>
  <text start="1945.86" dur="3.93">it wouldn&amp;#39;t know it do themselves I have</text>
  <text start="1947.87" dur="3.72">a friend who who really likes Q and will</text>
  <text start="1949.79" dur="5.34">have these conversations similar and</text>
  <text start="1951.59" dur="5.97">he&amp;#39;ll like he loves Q so much that he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1955.13" dur="3.99">be like if sessions gets fire doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1957.56" dur="3.45">matter and like if if he sounds posting</text>
  <text start="1959.12" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s in the dark so because of the</text>
  <text start="1961.01" dur="4.26">fortune cookie style coded message which</text>
  <text start="1963.32" dur="4.05">is really which is genius it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="1965.27" dur="5.34">like the most to build a following</text>
  <text start="1967.37" dur="5.31">anonymously like that is is mind-blowing</text>
  <text start="1970.61" dur="3.81">the genius hopefully to even the biggest</text>
  <text start="1972.68" dur="4.41">hater of Q could at least see the</text>
  <text start="1974.42" dur="4.44">amazingness there but it&amp;#39;s like I find</text>
  <text start="1977.09" dur="5.58">that people love it so much that they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1978.86" dur="5.1">backflip any code and any message to fit</text>
  <text start="1982.67" dur="3.84">no matter what and that it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="1983.96" dur="4.56">fortune cookie like yeah point two is</text>
  <text start="1986.51" dur="3.42">people and that&amp;#39;s that idol worship</text>
  <text start="1988.52" dur="3.54">thing that&amp;#39;s been ingrained into us is</text>
  <text start="1989.93" dur="4.41">that people look to queue for truth as</text>
  <text start="1992.06" dur="4.89">if Q and this is a big hang-up that I</text>
  <text start="1994.34" dur="4.32">have not with Q but it&amp;#39;s with lot of the</text>
  <text start="1996.95" dur="3.17">you know Q followers it&amp;#39;s that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1998.66" dur="3.5">look to Q as</text>

  <text start="2050.16" dur="3.39">stuff but everyone is different like</text>
  <text start="2052.17" dur="3.81">people say that to me all the time I</text>
  <text start="2053.55" dur="3.87">when I talk to people who love Palestine</text>
  <text start="2055.98" dur="3.15">and I just I asked questions about</text>
  <text start="2057.42" dur="3.66">Israel Palestine too because I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="2059.13" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m not saying Israel&amp;#39;s not doing that</text>
  <text start="2061.08" dur="4.23">in other countries but to think that</text>
  <text start="2063.18" dur="4.8">Palestine is not doing that like I think</text>
  <text start="2065.31" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s a little knife oh my god you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="2067.98" dur="5.07">scientist huh it&amp;#39;s like lakhs per second</text>
  <text start="2071.25" dur="4.53">let&amp;#39;s just talk let&amp;#39;s try to figure it</text>
  <text start="2073.05" dur="5.19">out so with everyone I think it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2075.78" dur="5.79">that we&amp;#39;re like you you know whoever it</text>
  <text start="2078.24" dur="5.28">may be he&amp;#39;s not cool everything in the</text>
  <text start="2081.57" dur="4.53">world maybe that&amp;#39;s not what he&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="2083.52" dur="4.92">for maybe I&amp;#39;m not the role but I will</text>
  <text start="2086.1" dur="4.14">say that the cool thing about cue and I</text>
  <text start="2088.44" dur="4.11">want to I want to give some background</text>
  <text start="2090.24" dur="5.61">to this real quick is that the idea of</text>
  <text start="2092.55" dur="4.83">like white hats or alliance groups for</text>
  <text start="2095.85" dur="3.81">lack of a better term behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="2097.38" dur="4.74">in a shadow civil war trying to take</text>
  <text start="2099.66" dur="4.59">down the Cabal I&amp;#39;ve heard of this idea</text>
  <text start="2102.12" dur="4.74">years ago you know it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="2104.25" dur="4.29">that is fresh in my mind with cue and</text>
  <text start="2106.86" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s always been the idea of like</text>
  <text start="2108.54" dur="4.8">anons trying to disclose things or not</text>
  <text start="2111.09" dur="5.51">just an ons but like whistleblower is</text>
  <text start="2113.34" dur="5.91">trying to get things out absolutely and</text>
  <text start="2116.6" dur="4.57">so that&amp;#39;s kind of one one reason why</text>
  <text start="2119.25" dur="3.42">when Q came about I kind of had that</text>
  <text start="2121.17" dur="3.24">perspective I&amp;#39;m like oh so it kind of</text>
  <text start="2122.67" dur="4.26">makes sense that they would do this and</text>
  <text start="2124.41" dur="4.65">the amazing thing about Q is that it</text>
  <text start="2126.93" dur="5.33">does touch on so many different things</text>
  <text start="2129.06" dur="4.95">like they have brushed on Big Pharma and</text>
  <text start="2132.26" dur="3.79">vaccines</text>
  <text start="2134.01" dur="3.93">and say the money missing from the</text>
  <text start="2136.05" dur="3.36">Pentagon and so many different things</text>
  <text start="2137.94" dur="4.23">you know so that&amp;#39;s what kind of made it</text>
  <text start="2139.41" dur="6.24">so amazing it&amp;#39;s like wow they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="2142.17" dur="6.36">to a there is legitimacy established</text>
  <text start="2145.65" dur="5.37">from these confirmations and finally a</text>
  <text start="2148.53" dur="6.33">person in the presidential seat that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2151.02" dur="6.72">not a puppet obviously so now here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2154.86" dur="4.67">chance that an alliance is actually</text>
  <text start="2157.74" dur="3.96">getting control and putting out this</text>
  <text start="2159.53" dur="4.6">intelligence dissemination operation</text>
  <text start="2161.7" dur="4.98">these basically drops for the public to</text>
  <text start="2164.13" dur="5.64">tell them what&amp;#39;s really going on behind</text>
  <text start="2166.68" dur="5.07">all this media like all the</text>
  <text start="2169.77" dur="4.08"> co-opted mainstream media</text>
  <text start="2171.75" dur="5.07">alternative media controlled opposition</text>
  <text start="2173.85" dur="8.55">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s done in a way that where</text>
  <text start="2176.82" dur="7.35">people you know they have it&amp;#39;s like if</text>
  <text start="2182.4" dur="3.81">you want to get kind of kind of weird</text>
  <text start="2184.17" dur="3.48">here but it&amp;#39;s like it doesn&amp;#39;t car it</text>
  <text start="2186.21" dur="3.6">doesn&amp;#39;t infringe on their free will they</text>
  <text start="2187.65" dur="4.14">have a choice to if they want to see it</text>
  <text start="2189.81" dur="5.67">or not want to see it you know if they</text>
  <text start="2191.79" dur="5.82">want to choose to try to make the effort</text>
  <text start="2195.48" dur="8.58">to learn about all the perspectives of</text>
  <text start="2197.61" dur="8.79">these things and and kind of kind of how</text>
  <text start="2204.06" dur="5.97">do I want to phrase this as just like an</text>
  <text start="2206.4" dur="5.37">objective or amateur way of discussing</text>
  <text start="2210.03" dur="3.48">this like you&amp;#39;re doing now you know like</text>
  <text start="2211.77" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re doing coming together in this</text>
  <text start="2213.51" dur="3.69">conversation then people out there need</text>
  <text start="2215.49" dur="4.26">to have more conversations like this and</text>
  <text start="2217.2" dur="4.5">not be so divisive about it absolutely</text>
  <text start="2219.75" dur="5.46">yeah and and left wingers and right</text>
  <text start="2221.7" dur="5.25">wingers like you said say trillions or</text>
  <text start="2225.21" dur="3.41">billions missing from Pentagon and</text>
  <text start="2226.95" dur="4.23">federal government this is stuff that</text>
  <text start="2228.62" dur="4.75">Washington Post published last year the</text>

  <text start="2233.37" dur="3.33">that they lost billions of dollars so</text>
  <text start="2235.29" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s like anyone on the left or right</text>
  <text start="2236.7" dur="4.8">this is Q is fake now dismissing the</text>
  <text start="2239.46" dur="4.32">stuff that&amp;#39;s literally in mainstream</text>
  <text start="2241.5" dur="5.19">publication so it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense all</text>
  <text start="2243.78" dur="5.73">you got to do in not just Q but again</text>
  <text start="2246.69" dur="5.07">with any any topic out there look at the</text>
  <text start="2249.51" dur="5.7">information and if you go back to the</text>
  <text start="2251.76" dur="5.19">beginning of the Q post in October but</text>
  <text start="2255.21" dur="3.63">thousands of them now a couple thousand</text>
  <text start="2256.95" dur="3.57">and just look at the information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2258.84" dur="4.38">presented in cross-reference that with</text>
  <text start="2260.52" dur="6.24">what&amp;#39;s out there you begin to see this</text>
  <text start="2263.22" dur="4.62">Wow okay you can say it could have been</text>
  <text start="2266.76" dur="4.17">some well research</text>
  <text start="2267.84" dur="6.3">kid in his basement but can it really</text>
  <text start="2270.93" dur="6.3">like holy I&amp;#39;m you know nearly a</text>
  <text start="2274.14" dur="4.47">decade into this and even myself like</text>
  <text start="2277.23" dur="3.33">some dots were connected in my head that</text>
  <text start="2278.61" dur="5.25">I wouldn&amp;#39;t have even thought of whoever</text>
  <text start="2280.56" dur="5.82">it is yeah is a genius for sure even if</text>
  <text start="2283.86" dur="4.17">they are on the inside to code and stuff</text>
  <text start="2286.38" dur="4.14">like that you know I&amp;#39;m a poet a hip-hop</text>
  <text start="2288.03" dur="4.26">artist just the poetry in it ISM is</text>
  <text start="2290.52" dur="3.63">incredible even if I hate it everywhere</text>
  <text start="2292.29" dur="4.86">he said I would be like wow this guy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2294.15" dur="5.16">is very talented so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="2297.15" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s either like you said a huge group</text>
  <text start="2299.31" dur="4.26">of people or someone genius even the</text>
  <text start="2301.56" dur="3.78">biggest hater could understand that and</text>
  <text start="2303.57" dur="5.22">even the biggest hater on the left and</text>
  <text start="2305.34" dur="5.88">right like Trump is not getting along</text>
  <text start="2308.79" dur="4.74">with like everyone else and I think</text>
  <text start="2311.22" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s very clear so it&amp;#39;s like both even</text>
  <text start="2313.53" dur="3.18">been there admitting themselves like</text>
  <text start="2314.7" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re not a deep state we&amp;#39;re a steady</text>
  <text start="2316.71" dur="4.47">state like it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2318.51" dur="4.47">secret like oh my god it&amp;#39;s all fake it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2321.18" dur="3.6">like no it&amp;#39;s like right in front of your</text>
  <text start="2322.98" dur="3.81">eyes the media hates Trump the tech</text>
  <text start="2324.78" dur="4.17">companies hate Trump pretty much every</text>
  <text start="2326.79" dur="3.84">powerful person in the world you know</text>
  <text start="2328.95" dur="3.75">that has been kind of controlling things</text>
  <text start="2330.63" dur="4.11">doesn&amp;#39;t like Trump I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2332.7" dur="3.96">any secret it&amp;#39;s like mind-blowing to me</text>
  <text start="2334.74" dur="4.89">that people don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t understand that</text>
  <text start="2336.66" dur="4.71">so I think that&amp;#39;s a you know if people</text>
  <text start="2339.63" dur="3.93">could look at it like that and I guess</text>
  <text start="2341.37" dur="3.96">with maybe jacker I can&amp;#39;t speak for them</text>
  <text start="2343.56" dur="3.15">sighs no idea if like Scott Adams I</text>
  <text start="2345.33" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t really follow up Scott to be</text>
  <text start="2346.71" dur="4.29">honest Jack I think he has interesting</text>
  <text start="2349.08" dur="5.28">tweets and he&amp;#39;s shown love of you times</text>
  <text start="2351" dur="5.31">but I think it&amp;#39;s the cue maybe the how</text>
  <text start="2354.36" dur="4.08">people are acting that is off-putting</text>
  <text start="2356.31" dur="4.71">people and where people are going with</text>
  <text start="2358.44" dur="5.64">it so that&amp;#39;s my one the reason I came</text>
  <text start="2361.02" dur="5.43">here to was to when when people start to</text>
  <text start="2364.08" dur="4.74">maybe weaponize the information or their</text>
  <text start="2366.45" dur="4.71">own opinions and perspectives into the</text>
  <text start="2368.82" dur="4.41">message into the movement and then start</text>
  <text start="2371.16" dur="4.23">attacking everybody whether it be good</text>
  <text start="2373.23" dur="4.44">people and people on the right I think</text>
  <text start="2375.39" dur="4.47">that becomes a problem and I think even</text>
  <text start="2377.67" dur="4.74">with people like yourself or people that</text>
  <text start="2379.86" dur="4.59">I like that you know we may not have the</text>
  <text start="2382.41" dur="3.15">same perspective like you talk about</text>
  <text start="2384.45" dur="3.93">different things I talk about different</text>
  <text start="2385.56" dur="4.56">things I don&amp;#39;t know into large extent</text>
  <text start="2388.38" dur="3.06">certain things you talk about certain</text>
  <text start="2390.12" dur="3.18">stuff you talked about with pharmacy</text>
  <text start="2391.44" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s I know exactly what you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="2393.3" dur="4.08">about and I totally agree but I think</text>
  <text start="2395.79" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s the one thing that the queue and</text>
  <text start="2397.38" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going through levels and I</text>
  <text start="2399.63" dur="1.9">think people are learning but I just</text>
  <text start="2401.19" dur="3.1">want to</text>
  <text start="2401.53" dur="5.31">see everyone you know not hate so hard</text>
  <text start="2404.29" dur="4.68">and also watch where they take that</text>
  <text start="2406.84" dur="5.16">because now you end the movement that</text>
  <text start="2408.97" dur="4.95">you and Q sir Rahm has a lot of power</text>
  <text start="2412" dur="3.54">you know it&amp;#39;s very very powerful where</text>
  <text start="2413.92" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s people you know I know people</text>
  <text start="2415.54" dur="3.3">that say I don&amp;#39;t like Alex Jones anymore</text>
  <text start="2417.22" dur="3.27">I like cute and that&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2418.84" dur="3.84">to like Alex Alex does a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="2420.49" dur="4.62">that is he too off-putting to a lot of</text>
  <text start="2422.68" dur="4.83">people and that&amp;#39;s his problem but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2425.11" dur="4.17">become it is powerful so we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2427.51" dur="4.02">pretend like it&amp;#39;s not powerful and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2429.28" dur="4.02">not powerful so it has been well just</text>
  <text start="2431.53" dur="3.51">and and I under like you said I</text>
  <text start="2433.3" dur="3.42">understand there&amp;#39;s hurt there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="2435.04" dur="3.24">people being annoying it&amp;#39;s a tough thing</text>
  <text start="2436.72" dur="4.05">but hopefully hopefully this</text>
  <text start="2438.28" dur="4.62">conversation can make both sides think</text>
  <text start="2440.77" dur="4.14">in a different way and just get people</text>
  <text start="2442.9" dur="4.77">to like have a conversation even if they</text>
  <text start="2444.91" dur="4.77">hate Trump or hate Q or and love Trev</text>
  <text start="2447.67" dur="4.32">like just you know have a convo and</text>
  <text start="2449.68" dur="4.8">maybe it&amp;#39;s not that different</text>
  <text start="2451.99" dur="4.74">yeah like perspective is everything you</text>
  <text start="2454.48" dur="5.58">know and we&amp;#39;re all just humans and when</text>
  <text start="2456.73" dur="5.19">it comes to looking at anybody like they</text>
  <text start="2460.06" dur="4.2">all have good qualities depending on how</text>
  <text start="2461.92" dur="5.22">you look at it and whatever you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2464.26" dur="5.13">seeing in them is your own issues coming</text>
  <text start="2467.14" dur="3.78">out and that we could look at Trump this</text>
  <text start="2469.39" dur="4.92">way so a lot of people are triggered by</text>
  <text start="2470.92" dur="4.8">Trump okay when I look at him I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="2474.31" dur="3">hell yeah he has an ego but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2475.72" dur="3.33">exactly what he needs standing on that</text>
  <text start="2477.31" dur="5.07">stage flipping off the deep state that</text>
  <text start="2479.05" dur="4.83">he just like you gotta be strong I mean</text>
  <text start="2482.38" dur="4.5">who else could do it he&amp;#39;s doing like</text>
  <text start="2483.88" dur="4.77">yeah hey he&amp;#39;s wild but like you can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2486.88" dur="4.17">normal and do what he&amp;#39;s doing it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2488.65" dur="3.99">even it&amp;#39;s like a Kunis way so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2491.05" dur="4.05">know how he&amp;#39;s doing it I don&amp;#39;t know like</text>
  <text start="2492.64" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just like defying combining</text>
  <text start="2495.1" dur="7.41"> truly and talking about say Jack</text>
  <text start="2498.49" dur="5.67">Poe so byuk you know I he cracks me up</text>
  <text start="2502.51" dur="3.3">with his sense of humor his Twitter is</text>
  <text start="2504.16" dur="3.33">hilarious sometimes but then there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2507.49" dur="6.06">okay there whenever it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that hate</text>
