  <text start="0.03" dur="6.51">what&amp;#39;s up guys so this video here is</text>
  <text start="2.97" dur="6.209">going to be one that is crucial for each</text>
  <text start="6.54" dur="6.54">and every human being to understand to</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="6.241">reclaim and keep their natural human</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="4.59">sovereignty and that is transhumanism</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="4.68">and the ideas and concepts behind the</text>
  <text start="17.67" dur="5.189">transhumanist agenda that the powers</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="6.21">that be are trying to push up on</text>
  <text start="22.859" dur="6.021">humanity and transhumanism in my opinion</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="5.549">and the opinion of many other</text>
  <text start="28.88" dur="5.589">well-versed researchers is that it is</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="6.261">the ultimate psychological operation</text>
  <text start="34.469" dur="6.871">it&amp;#39;s the ultimate devaluing and</text>
  <text start="38.12" dur="7.99">suppressing of our natural inherent</text>
  <text start="41.34" dur="6.93">human potential and let me explain first</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="5.789">the inspiration for this topic comes</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="5.219">from Elan musk actually because I</text>
  <text start="51.899" dur="7.111">believe last week or a couple weeks ago</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="7.14">he was saying that transhumanism is the</text>
  <text start="59.01" dur="5.52">only way forward or something to that</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="7.021">effect and I completely disagree I got a</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="4.769">lot of opinions about that guy not for</text>
  <text start="67.65" dur="5.579">this video maybe for another one but</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="7.371">very interesting anyway transhumanism is</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="6.661">basically the belief that the human race</text>
  <text start="76.67" dur="5.019">the only way that we can evolve past our</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="5.31">current state is through the help of</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="5.011">science technology and computers right</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="5.01">the only way we can keep going is to</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="5.79">almost merge man and machine into one</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="3.81">and I mean I&amp;#39;ve even read things of</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="3.089">people talking about uploading their</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="4.02">consciousness to a computer mainframe</text>
  <text start="95.579" dur="4.591">and making it sound like a wonderful</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="7.5">idea as if they never seen the freaking</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="6.96">Matrix trilogy and I mean in that regard</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="3.869">just look at movies look at Hollywood</text>
  <text start="107.13" dur="6.599">productions how many of them have that</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="8.1">idea that man needs to upload themselves</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="6.21">basically to a type of mainframe and</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="4.231">then in every single movie the</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="3.871">artificial intelligence ends up killing</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="3.75">off humans so it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.809">to tell us something they got the truth</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="4.65">in plain sight right there and look at</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.861">George Lucas and his Darth Vader concept</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="3.15">he actually had a half robot half human</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="3.569">purse</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="4.74">as the villain and then at the very end</text>
  <text start="136.049" dur="4.55">of the movie spoil alert but I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="7.11">everybody&amp;#39;s seen it Darth Vader</text>
  <text start="140.599" dur="7.12">basically chooses the human side of him</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="6">and throws Emperor Palpatine down the</text>
  <text start="147.719" dur="5.011">Death Star shaft so you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="3.959">many things that these directors can be</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="3.81">saying whether they&amp;#39;re part of the Cabal</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="2.551">just putting the truth in plain sight or</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="5.339">if they&amp;#39;re actually trying to warn us</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="7.13">but that&amp;#39;s exactly the basics of the</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="6.271">situation is that if we were to</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="6.01">completely give ourselves up and upload</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="4.05">our consciousness and our humanity up to</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="7.71">this mainframe it&amp;#39;s gonna wipe us out</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="7.349">and it&amp;#39;s like the ultimate ego this is</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="6.389">the way I think of it it&amp;#39;s the ultimate</text>
  <text start="179.549" dur="8.101">ego trip right it&amp;#39;s completely giving</text>
  <text start="184.889" dur="7.05">away that metaphysical aspect of us that</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="6.269">we have to work to connect to and simply</text>
  <text start="191.939" dur="4.23">just reveling in the physicality</text>
  <text start="193.919" dur="6.72">reveling in the physical world and if</text>
  <text start="196.169" dur="5.97">anything basically saying I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="200.639" dur="2.82">to ever begin my spiritual being I just</text>
  <text start="202.139" dur="3.541">want to revel in this physical world for</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="4.231">the rest of eternity completely give</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="4.199">myself up and it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="4.259">instant gratification for eternity right</text>
  <text start="209.879" dur="4.801">and it&amp;#39;s just being physical being for</text>
  <text start="211.949" dur="5.25">the rest of existence and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="4.769">sound very fun those metaphysical</text>
  <text start="217.199" dur="4.921">aspects aspects are pretty fricking cool</text>
  <text start="219.449" dur="5.611">when you begin to learn about it but the</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="5.039">thing is the powers that be don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="6.72">us to learn about those metaphysical</text>
  <text start="227.159" dur="7.381">aspects we have an inherent technology</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="5.01">within us due to our DNA and human</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="6.659">consciousness and our pineal gland right</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="6.449">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a inherent natural technology</text>
  <text start="241.199" dur="3.93">you could call it and when you really</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="4.2">begin to delve into the mental pineal</text>
  <text start="245.129" dur="4.651">gland does and how DNA functions and the</text>
  <text start="247.439" dur="4.08">power of human consciousness you really</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="3.929">begin to see that we don&amp;#39;t need machines</text>
  <text start="251.519" dur="3.481">we don&amp;#39;t need any type of trans to</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="3.18">humanist agenda we don&amp;#39;t need to upload</text>
  <text start="255" dur="4.229">our consciousness to anything because we</text>
  <text start="256.889" dur="5.25">can use our consciousness as the freakin</text>
  <text start="259.229" dur="6.451">strongest computer we have right if you</text>
  <text start="262.139" dur="4.591">really focus on becoming that spiritual</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="3.27">being</text>
  <text start="266.73" dur="6.21">what&amp;#39;s not possible you can Remote View</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="5.34">you can I mean I it&amp;#39;s completely pop</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="4.85">these things are completely possible</text>
  <text start="274.29" dur="8.67">they&amp;#39;re documented Revolt remote viewing</text>
  <text start="277.79" dur="6.4">you know what else is there it&amp;#39;s got my</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="2.24">minds kind of blanking right now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.71">obviously not connecting that</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="5.26">metaphysical aspect but it&amp;#39;s alright</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s remote viewing there&amp;#39;s ESP</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s telepathy there&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="6.42">literally changing matter with your mind</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="5.88">and all kinds of stuff there&amp;#39;s all kinds</text>
  <text start="298.77" dur="4.98">of stuff that&amp;#39;s available to you when</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="6.15">you really begin to tap into your DNA</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="6.56">and your pineal gland and this the</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="5.01">suppression of this information has been</text>
  <text start="310.31" dur="4.84">or I should say the powers that be have</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="4.44">suppressed this information for eons</text>
  <text start="315.15" dur="3.24">because they don&amp;#39;t want us to wake up to</text>
  <text start="317.1" dur="3.98">the power because that was decent that</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="4.95">would destruct their control systems and</text>
  <text start="321.08" dur="4.27">they&amp;#39;ve done it both scientifically and</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="4.17">religiously scientifically they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="325.35" dur="3.57">always shunned any type of consciousness</text>
  <text start="327.51" dur="4.68">research that&amp;#39;s why freaking Rupert</text>
  <text start="328.92" dur="4.83">Sheldrake has his the science delusion</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="3.48">and Graham Hancock had his TED talk on</text>
  <text start="333.75" dur="3.96">the the suppression of consciousness</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="3.66">basically banned from TED talk there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="4.31">always been a suppression of research</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="6.03">into the pineal gland and DNA and</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="5.71">reviewing in telepathy as if there were</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="3.9">French concepts right the ridicule and</text>
  <text start="347.73" dur="5.94">the scientific community has been strong</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="7.17">and religiously we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of</text>
  <text start="353.67" dur="6.93">misinformation by the mainstream</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="7.53">religious powers that be to convolute</text>
  <text start="360.6" dur="6.48">the ideas of Jesus in various ancient</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="4.77">religious figures because Jesus what I</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="3.45">mean by that is Jesus basically said hey</text>
  <text start="368.73" dur="3.27">you humans can do everything I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="3.63">you just got to love you&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="372" dur="5.7">unbelief love and believe and understand</text>
  <text start="374.16" dur="7.56">it and the mainstream religious sects</text>
  <text start="377.7" dur="5.13">always said that oh you humans are you</text>
  <text start="381.72" dur="2.67">know you should be full of guilt you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="3.66">sinful creatures and you suck and you</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="4.56">should you know pray to Jesus as your</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="4.47">idol so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="388.95" dur="4.83">contradiction of what they were really</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="5.22">saying versus what we&amp;#39;re told they say</text>
  <text start="393.78" dur="5.82">so the suppression has always been there</text>
  <text start="396.18" dur="4.45">for our inherent powers God give and</text>
  <text start="399.6" dur="2.95">creator given</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="5.4">intelligent infinity given powers and</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="5.58">the power the be cabal right now on this</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="4.08">planet are trying to suppress that</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="5.7">information and push their transhumanist</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="5.43">agenda because what easier way to</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="3.81">control the frickin planet than to have</text>
  <text start="415.54" dur="5.28">it all hooked up to a computer that you</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="4.41">sit there type the keys on so this this</text>
  <text start="420.82" dur="2.97">video is very important this</text>
  <text start="422.05" dur="2.46">transhumanist concept is crucial to</text>
  <text start="423.79" dur="3.36">understand</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="4.47">I hope my ramblings of my tirades were</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="5.55">able to piece together some of it for</text>
  <text start="428.98" dur="6.36">you please do more research into the</text>
  <text start="432.7" dur="4.56">pineal gland and how amazing our DNA is</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="4.05">and things like bio photons the power of</text>
  <text start="437.26" dur="4.56">human consciousness if you don&amp;#39;t already</text>
  <text start="439.39" dur="4.41">know I&amp;#39;m sure many people watching this</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="6.24">channel already do but if you don&amp;#39;t look</text>
