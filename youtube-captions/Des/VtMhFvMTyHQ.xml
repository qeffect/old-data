  <text start="50.67" dur="4.44">really fun interview to do I&amp;#39;ll post it</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="4.889">when they put it up on their YouTube</text>

  <text start="59.82" dur="3.03">trying to do at this panel next year</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="4.56">that they&amp;#39;re bringing us out there for</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="5.97">they want to do a bigger picture panel</text>
  <text start="66.15" dur="4.2">get into like more red peeling concepts</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="6.119">as how they wanted to describe it and</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s great to see organizations begin to</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="3.301">break out of their little compartment</text>
  <text start="77.52" dur="6.06">and mold</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="6.93">you know because we there&amp;#39;s so many like</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="4.53">topics or some of you topics out there</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="5.67">and it&amp;#39;s typically that they&amp;#39;ll focus</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="6.38">very hard on the truth-telling of one</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="6.12">topic but there&amp;#39;s very little outreach</text>
  <text start="94.49" dur="5.32">unification between them so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="5.22">seeing now is so many organizations and</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="4.129">groups and people their minds are really</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="4.77">breaking open and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="103.939" dur="4.421">want to bring in the bigger picture you</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="3.29">know because it all connects it all</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="5.009">connects in some way or another and</text>
  <text start="110.24" dur="6.129">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m a huge proponent of the</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="5.07">idea of holism holistic thinking</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="4.341">thinking how everything connects because</text>

  <text start="120.71" dur="4.63">body if you want to get healthy it&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="4.199">holistic health is getting so popular</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="5.25">because that&amp;#39;s how you have to think if</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="4.771">you want to see how it all functions the</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="3.33">bigger picture same thing with looking</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="3.57">at the world you know during</text>

  <text start="156.209" dur="4.171">state kind of clapped down in this</text>
  <text start="157.95" dur="5.46">country in the early 1900&amp;#39;s with the</text>

  <text start="327.24" dur="5.91">access television network is considered</text>
  <text start="330.66" dur="5.27">a state actor and thus could be sued</text>

  <text start="512.219" dur="4.771">about this you know I was just I was</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="5.55">clever and I found a little loophole in</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="4.77">that and it wasn&amp;#39;t me I actually saw</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="3.599">other YouTube channels do this and I</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="3.54">kept seeing them do that after they</text>
  <text start="523.289" dur="4.501">deleted mine so I was wondering why am I</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="4.44">being targeted and wondering who else</text>
  <text start="527.79" dur="5.82">I&amp;#39;ve never seen anybody else had this</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="5.64">happened to them after the fact but what</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="5.31">I did so rather than</text>
  <text start="535.38" dur="5.88">linking a product URL and making an</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="4.68">affiliates code for that and linking</text>
  <text start="541.26" dur="4.79">that below a video what I did is found</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="6.03">out how to make Amazon&amp;#39;s home page</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="4.96">become that affiliate link and link that</text>
  <text start="549.63" dur="2.79">below of videos so it&amp;#39;s not like they</text>
  <text start="551.01" dur="3.48">were being sent to a specific product</text>
  <text start="552.42" dur="4.229">they were sent being sent to Amazon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.49" dur="4.32">home page through my affiliates account</text>
  <text start="556.649" dur="4.051">and then they could buy whatever like</text>
  <text start="558.81" dur="4.17">whatever their normal Amazon stuff was</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="3.87">if they just wanted to buy food products</text>
  <text start="562.98" dur="3.99">or freakin toilet paper or like tech</text>
  <text start="564.57" dur="3.93">stuff cameras whatever the case just a</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="2.88">small portion of that would go to my</text>
  <text start="568.5" dur="3.149">affiliates account it&amp;#39;s just a clever</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="4.89">way to I saw telling about other people</text>
  <text start="571.649" dur="7.801">do it I did it and I think I did it for</text>
  <text start="574.74" dur="7.32">like four or five months and the last</text>
  <text start="579.45" dur="4.56">month that I did before they cut my</text>
  <text start="582.06" dur="3.839">account it was like six or seven hundred</text>
  <text start="584.01" dur="4.53">bucks I mean like six or seven hundred</text>
  <text start="585.899" dur="3.81">bucks in a month and I could totally see</text>
  <text start="588.54" dur="3.15">why they would cut me though cuz it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.709" dur="4.921">just like free money through a little</text>
  <text start="591.69" dur="4.61">loophole but regardless I was sending</text>
  <text start="594.63" dur="3.69">people to Amazon for them to buy</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="5.32">products that Amazon was still gonna</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="5.43">make buku bucks on anyway so that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="601.62" dur="3.51">you know it&amp;#39;s kind of a win-win</text>
  <text start="603.75" dur="3.3">situation for everybody there but then</text>
  <text start="605.13" dur="3.899">quite obvious targeting just because I</text>
  <text start="607.05" dur="4.65">am Who I am and I do what I do</text>
  <text start="609.029" dur="5.25">so yeah interesting I wonder if Amazon</text>
  <text start="611.7" dur="6.48">could be subject to anything for that</text>
  <text start="614.279" dur="6.75">and then YouTube I mean god come on</text>
  <text start="618.18" dur="5.01">I could talk for 10 15 20 minutes about</text>
  <text start="621.029" dur="6.151">all this stuff I&amp;#39;ve seen and been</text>

  <text start="632.1" dur="4.109">monetize kind of things and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="634.92" dur="3.71">interesting because when you work with</text>

  <text start="675.36" dur="7.74">censorship science 101 class is in</text>
  <text start="679.05" dur="6.81">session and livestreams I&amp;#39;ve had live</text>
  <text start="683.1" dur="4.74">streams cut I&amp;#39;m sure some of you have</text>
  <text start="685.86" dur="5.55">probably been on them this was a few</text>
  <text start="687.84" dur="4.95">months ago towards because I&amp;#39;ve really I</text>
  <text start="691.41" dur="4.98">haven&amp;#39;t been able to livestream on this</text>
  <text start="692.79" dur="6.75">channel for most of this year but when I</text>
  <text start="696.39" dur="4.86">could earlier on the video would go for</text>
  <text start="699.54" dur="4.56">like 15 minutes when I used to like</text>
  <text start="701.25" dur="6.06">livestream my my whatever news from the</text>
  <text start="704.1" dur="4.83">screens or the whiteboard and it would</text>
  <text start="707.31" dur="6.48">go for 15 minutes and then just cut like</text>
  <text start="708.93" dur="7.5">end cut from my phone and if I logged on</text>
  <text start="713.79" dur="4.74">to YouTube on desktop it would still say</text>
  <text start="716.43" dur="4.11">the live stream was going but my it</text>
  <text start="718.53" dur="4.17">wasn&amp;#39;t on my phone so it was odd I would</text>
  <text start="720.54" dur="5.19">actually have to go into the desktop cut</text>
  <text start="722.7" dur="5.1">my live stream from that creator studio</text>
  <text start="725.73" dur="3.39">and then go again on my phone and what</text>
  <text start="727.8" dur="4.26">would happen is this happened multiple</text>
  <text start="729.12" dur="4.38">times is that every time after that it</text>
  <text start="732.06" dur="3.6">would just go for like a minute or two</text>
  <text start="733.5" dur="4.83">you could go back a couple months and</text>
  <text start="735.66" dur="4.77">see my videos it was like livestream 15</text>
  <text start="738.33" dur="2.43">minutes then I would instantly try it</text>
  <text start="740.43" dur="1.92">again</text>
  <text start="740.76" dur="2.55">two minutes cut cut it was like</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="3.99">literally somebody was there with a</text>
  <text start="743.31" dur="6.96">button nope nope nope</text>
  <text start="746.34" dur="6.6">you know intriguing and then of course</text>
  <text start="750.27" dur="6.09">terminated twice got cut for the first</text>
  <text start="752.94" dur="5.49">time over that uh that that fateful</text>
  <text start="756.36" dur="3.36">weekend in February after the whole</text>
  <text start="758.43" dur="3.24">parkland thing you know and they</text>
  <text start="759.72" dur="5.28">sanitized like a hundred channels off</text>
  <text start="761.67" dur="5.85">YouTube strike strike strike so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765" dur="6.84">the first time luckily got a back went</text>
  <text start="767.52" dur="6.78">off a second time in May you know it was</text>
  <text start="771.84" dur="4.05">it was gone for a month I got this I had</text>
  <text start="774.3" dur="3.72">a backup channel I got this main channel</text>
  <text start="775.89" dur="5.16">back here I had it up for about a month</text>
  <text start="778.02" dur="6.24">and then in May it got cut again and</text>
  <text start="781.05" dur="6.39">what was weird this time was that so</text>
  <text start="784.26" dur="5.13">when they reinstated it they reinstated</text>
  <text start="787.44" dur="3.3">it with one strike so that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="789.39" dur="2.85">couldn&amp;#39;t live stream you can&amp;#39;t live</text>
  <text start="790.74" dur="2.91">stream on YouTube if you have a strike</text>
  <text start="792.24" dur="5.37">so that&amp;#39;s why most this year I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="793.65" dur="5.73">so they were like forced to reinstate it</text>
  <text start="797.61" dur="4.62">so they said fine we&amp;#39;ll just reinstate</text>
  <text start="799.38" dur="5.01">it with one strike so I had a strike</text>
  <text start="802.23" dur="4.2">but I could upload videos I uploaded a</text>
  <text start="804.39" dur="5.61">video they gave me a strike on one video</text>
  <text start="806.43" dur="7.08">in May so I should have two strikes on</text>
  <text start="810" dur="6.21">my channel but they cut my whole channel</text>
  <text start="813.51" dur="4.59">anyway so it was like not it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="816.21" dur="4.26">three now it was two and out apparently</text>
  <text start="818.1" dur="3.69">if you have two strikes on your channel</text>
  <text start="820.47" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;re only supposed to have a two week</text>
  <text start="821.79" dur="4.92">ban three strikes and you&amp;#39;re out on</text>
  <text start="823.65" dur="6.14">YouTube but I guess it&amp;#39;s different in my</text>
  <text start="826.71" dur="6.48">case alright two strikes and I was out</text>
  <text start="829.79" dur="6.76">down for a month came back and now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="833.19" dur="5.61">had it for a few months now so all sorts</text>
  <text start="836.55" dur="4.26">of weird stuff and what was intriguing -</text>
  <text start="838.8" dur="4.17">and I didn&amp;#39;t find it this out until a</text>
  <text start="840.81" dur="4.91">couple months later is that the second</text>
  <text start="842.97" dur="5.16">time they took down my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="4.42">the emails they sent me they were super</text>
  <text start="848.13" dur="5.15">vague I didn&amp;#39;t I never got a reason but</text>
  <text start="850.14" dur="5.43">then I poked and prodded some of their</text>
  <text start="853.28" dur="5.68">message some of their staff on social</text>
  <text start="855.57" dur="6.9">media that I could find YouTube support</text>
  <text start="858.96" dur="5.49">staff and the guy looked into my account</text>
  <text start="862.47" dur="2.85">he was a super nice guy he had no idea</text>
  <text start="864.45" dur="2.37">what was going on he looked into my</text>
  <text start="865.32" dur="3.36">account he&amp;#39;s like okay so I found out</text>
  <text start="866.82" dur="5.91">there&amp;#39;s a note here they said they took</text>
  <text start="868.68" dur="5.22">it down for CBD because I mentioned CBD</text>
  <text start="872.73" dur="4.97">in the video</text>
  <text start="873.9" dur="6.84">CBD products can have a die on cannabis</text>
  <text start="877.7" dur="7.57">so half was there that was their reason</text>
  <text start="880.74" dur="6.96">right the second time and it was amazing</text>
  <text start="885.27" dur="6.12">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s truly shows you that</text>
  <text start="887.7" dur="5.25">Oh last thing here I got a legal notice</text>
  <text start="891.39" dur="4.89">this one was weird this one was last</text>
  <text start="892.95" dur="5.19">year before my youtube channel got</text>
  <text start="896.28" dur="3.51">terminated and I had any strikes on it</text>
  <text start="898.14" dur="5.13">but at the end of last year I did a</text>
  <text start="899.79" dur="6.9">video on space I was talking about space</text>
  <text start="903.27" dur="5.28">and all these weird glowing lights and</text>
  <text start="906.69" dur="4.11">flashes and things being seen in the sky</text>
  <text start="908.55" dur="4.47">over it was a really short period at the</text>
  <text start="910.8" dur="4.29">end of last year and as all within a few</text>
  <text start="913.02" dur="4.23">days just these glowing lights I was</text>
  <text start="915.09" dur="3.84">like is there some sort of like space</text>
  <text start="917.25" dur="3.48">war going on behind the scenes that we</text>
  <text start="918.93" dur="4.29">just have no idea about but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="4.11">these flashes and streaks and all kinds</text>
  <text start="923.22" dur="3.81">of stuff so I made this video just</text>
  <text start="924.84" dur="6.32">detailing some YouTube videos and other</text>
  <text start="927.03" dur="8.92">articles and I got a month later I got a</text>
  <text start="931.16" dur="7.73">letter from YouTube saying that around</text>
  <text start="935.95" dur="6.54">in like 60 different countries my video</text>
  <text start="938.89" dur="5.34">wasn&amp;#39;t playable anymore because it</text>
  <text start="942.49" dur="4.17">violated some like local laws or I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="4.28">know again big excuse but violated some</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="7.74">law so they took it down it was like a</text>
  <text start="948.51" dur="10.89">legal email notice it&amp;#39;s like weird weird</text>
  <text start="954.4" dur="7.23">so space videos of course a lot of</text>
  <text start="959.4" dur="9.27">touchy stuff out there when it comes to</text>
  <text start="961.63" dur="10.44">space videos censored talking about</text>

  <text start="972.07" dur="5.1">about QED talking about health you know</text>
  <text start="974.29" dur="8.18">when it comes to censorship a lot of</text>
  <text start="977.17" dur="7.71">people I find try to own it they try to</text>
  <text start="982.47" dur="5.5">wear their censorship on their belief</text>
  <text start="984.88" dur="6.39">system we could say it&amp;#39;s like they try</text>
  <text start="987.97" dur="4.8">to claim it and say my my belief system</text>
  <text start="991.27" dur="5.34">is the right one because it&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="992.77" dur="5.61">being censored you know and that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
