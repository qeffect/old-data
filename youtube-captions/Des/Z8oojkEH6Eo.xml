  <text start="1012.63" dur="4.99">everything on hn with the storm with the</text>
  <text start="1015.1" dur="5.31">FBI imploding there&amp;#39;s a lot more stuff</text>
  <text start="1017.62" dur="7.14">we should say earthbound earth-based we</text>
  <text start="1020.41" dur="4.889">have to research and get out to the</text>
  <text start="1024.76" dur="3.659">masses</text>
  <text start="1025.299" dur="4.65">before we start delving into the the UFO</text>
  <text start="1028.419" dur="3.721">extraterrestrial phenomena because</text>
  <text start="1029.949" dur="3.691">that&amp;#39;s such a deep subject it&amp;#39;s varied</text>
  <text start="1032.14" dur="3.929">and it&amp;#39;s very difficult for a lot of</text>
  <text start="1033.64" dur="4.769">people to come to terms with because it</text>
  <text start="1036.069" dur="3.48">I mean it goes out it brushes their</text>
  <text start="1038.409" dur="3.331">belief systems to get a lot of cognitive</text>
  <text start="1039.549" dur="4.681">dissonance right if they&amp;#39;re caught up in</text>
  <text start="1041.74" dur="4.5">like religious or scientific dogma that</text>
  <text start="1044.23" dur="4.319">would be a very confusing subject and</text>
  <text start="1046.24" dur="6.03">right now as a society we just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1048.549" dur="5.941">have time for that we&amp;#39;ve got to get on</text>
  <text start="1052.27" dur="4.019">with taking down the traffickers of guns</text>
  <text start="1054.49" dur="3.99">and drugs and humans and organs and you</text>
  <text start="1056.289" dur="5.461">know all that stuff so I&amp;#39;m just telling</text>
  <text start="1058.48" dur="5.79">you now UFOs are not a distraction it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1061.75" dur="6.87">important to research but we&amp;#39;ll get to</text>
  <text start="1064.27" dur="5.64">that issue in time right now let&amp;#39;s focus</text>
  <text start="1068.62" dur="4.14">on more important</text>
  <text start="1069.91" dur="4.59">tasks at hand but for me you know I just</text>
  <text start="1072.76" dur="2.94">love talking extraterrestrial space</text>
  <text start="1074.5" dur="3.63">program stuff that&amp;#39;s kind of one of my</text>
  <text start="1075.7" dur="5.88">Forte&amp;#39;s so I&amp;#39;m gonna continuously seed</text>
  <text start="1078.13" dur="5.58">that in and you know never underestimate</text>
  <text start="1081.58" dur="3.78">the power of planting a seed it&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1083.71" dur="2.94">be in a lot of people&amp;#39;s heads so when we</text>
  <text start="1085.36" dur="2.76">get to that point in the future that</text>
  <text start="1086.65" dur="3.3">could be like oh yeah I remember that</text>
  <text start="1088.12" dur="5.82">that at this point this doubt connects</text>
  <text start="1089.95" dur="7.74">so anyway and then one thing here I want</text>
  <text start="1093.94" dur="10.2">to make note of you know each of these</text>
  <text start="1097.69" dur="11.34">articles is uh referencing this video</text>
  <text start="1104.14" dur="7.46">that was allegedly taken by the US Navy</text>
  <text start="1109.03" dur="7.38">in 2004 from a Hornet of a UFO right</text>
  <text start="1111.6" dur="5.83">each of these has the same video plenty</text>
  <text start="1116.41" dur="5.7">of people I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1117.43" dur="8.99">video by now John Lear who is the son of</text>
  <text start="1122.11" dur="9.48">the inventor of the Learjet he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1126.42" dur="7.36">prominent researcher in the UFO field he</text>
  <text start="1131.59" dur="4.29">did he did a good scientific analysis</text>
  <text start="1133.78" dur="5.91">here of this video and he calls a total</text>
  <text start="1135.88" dur="7.14"> which it you know reading his</text>
  <text start="1139.69" dur="7.11">analysis here makes a lot of sense as to</text>
  <text start="1143.02" dur="6.15">this video being BS and that&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="1146.8" dur="4.5">why it took them so long to put this</text>
  <text start="1149.17" dur="3.27">video out right Tom DeLonge was like oh</text>
  <text start="1151.3" dur="2.22">it&amp;#39;ll be another couple weeks it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1152.44" dur="2.46">another couple weeks and then we&amp;#39;ll drop</text>
  <text start="1153.52" dur="3.06">this big bomb on yeah it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1154.9" dur="5.22">because they were just fabricating this</text>
  <text start="1156.58" dur="5.19">video all right bring it up like iMovie</text>
  <text start="1160.12" dur="3.54">and Photoshop and try to make a really</text>
  <text start="1161.77" dur="4.74">bad rendition of it I don&amp;#39;t doubt that</text>
  <text start="1163.66" dur="6.66">this video is fake again UFOs aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1166.51" dur="7.11">fake this video these articles are are</text>
  <text start="1170.32" dur="5.43">part of the SIA and John Lear here says</text>
  <text start="1173.62" dur="4.53">basically first thing he noticed was</text>
  <text start="1175.75" dur="3.99">ambient noise suppose it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="1178.15" dur="4.05">be sounding like wind rushing against</text>
  <text start="1179.74" dur="4.23">the aircraft but there should be no wind</text>
  <text start="1182.2" dur="3.81">noise because the microphone is hidden</text>
  <text start="1183.97" dur="4.65">inside the oxygen mask with shields your</text>
  <text start="1186.01" dur="4.65">face and does not let any and B annoys</text>
  <text start="1188.62" dur="4.77">in makes total sense</text>
  <text start="1190.66" dur="5.64">then the pilots conversation using dude</text>
  <text start="1193.39" dur="5.76">and bro is not navy jargon fighter</text>
  <text start="1196.3" dur="5.69">pilots talk in short clip sentences it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1199.15" dur="4.57">one thing I thought reading the or</text>
  <text start="1201.99" dur="4.16">watching that video</text>
  <text start="1203.72" dur="5.4">like weird you know bro dude bro bro</text>
  <text start="1206.15" dur="5.67">Navy fighter pilots bro they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1209.12" dur="4.38">gonna be saying those things one pilot</text>
  <text start="1211.82" dur="3.75">says something like the wind is out of</text>
  <text start="1213.5" dur="4.44">120 degrees at 20 knots or something</text>
  <text start="1215.57" dur="4.739">like that why would he let me zoom in</text>
  <text start="1217.94" dur="5.67">here maybe you can see little bit more</text>
  <text start="1220.309" dur="6.24">of this yeah I can&amp;#39;t oh there we go</text>
  <text start="1223.61" dur="4.86">anyway it says why would he bother to</text>
  <text start="1226.549" dur="4.351">tell the other pilot that information</text>
  <text start="1228.47" dur="5.939">the other pilot has that information on</text>
  <text start="1230.9" dur="5.85">his HUD his heads-up display it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1234.409" dur="4.471">stupid remark to put into the script but</text>
  <text start="1236.75" dur="5.25">understand it was put into the script</text>
  <text start="1238.88" dur="4.799">because they needed to give the video a</text>
  <text start="1242" dur="5.19">frame of reference for people watching</text>
  <text start="1243.679" dur="6.721">it that didn&amp;#39;t really realize that this</text>
  <text start="1247.19" dur="5.52">is faked right and let&amp;#39;s see here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1250.4" dur="6.42">also discussing how in this video you</text>
  <text start="1252.71" dur="6">can see that the UFO is totally still in</text>
  <text start="1256.82" dur="4.739">the middle of the frame but look at this</text>
  <text start="1258.71" dur="7.14">it&amp;#39;s banking the whole air at the whole</text>
  <text start="1261.559" dur="8.761">jet the Hornet is banking so how in the</text>
  <text start="1265.85" dur="7.29">hell is he banking so perfectly to keep</text>
  <text start="1270.32" dur="6.33">this UFO in the direct middle of the</text>
  <text start="1273.14" dur="5.039">frame this whole time you know it should</text>
  <text start="1276.65" dur="3.18">be like if it was actually banking that</text>
  <text start="1278.179" dur="3.721">UFO would be like a little bit all over</text>
  <text start="1279.83" dur="5.219">the screen right so anyway his analysis</text>
  <text start="1281.9" dur="6.12">is good this video looks like it&amp;#39;s fake</text>
  <text start="1285.049" dur="5.551">makes total sense all of these articles</text>
  <text start="1288.02" dur="7.17">are just part of a big old distraction</text>
  <text start="1290.6" dur="6.39">of a very managed disclosure and just by</text>
  <text start="1295.19" dur="3.75">looking at the comments right now it</text>
  <text start="1296.99" dur="4.02">looks like there&amp;#39;s so many psyops in</text>
