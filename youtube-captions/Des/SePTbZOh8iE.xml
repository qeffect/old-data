  <text start="2.25" dur="2.97">five-minute red pill video that I did on</text>
  <text start="3.81" dur="3.06">the secret space program that the</text>
  <text start="5.22" dur="3.54">question was about how to read pill</text>
  <text start="6.87" dur="3.75">somebody in five minutes but the video</text>
  <text start="8.76" dur="3.87">definitely was not 5 minutes long I was</text>
  <text start="10.62" dur="4.41">like 15 minutes long and I&amp;#39;m like you</text>
  <text start="12.63" dur="3.69">know I know people are gonna say</text>
  <text start="15.03" dur="2.85">something about it i didn&amp;#39;t care i</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="3.27">uploaded anyway people definitely did</text>
  <text start="17.88" dur="3.899">say something about it but i thought</text>
  <text start="19.59" dur="5.189">about it and i think i do want to do</text>
  <text start="21.779" dur="4.201">these videos in 5 minutes and the next</text>
  <text start="24.779" dur="3.871">topic i&amp;#39;m going to do it on is</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="5.039">chemtrails this was a comment on the</text>
  <text start="28.65" dur="3.69">last video i uploaded that people really</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="3.871">wanted to see so i&amp;#39;m gonna do this one</text>
  <text start="32.34" dur="4.29">on chemtrails and i got the timer ready</text>
  <text start="34.89" dur="3.78">of course we&amp;#39;re gonna start it after</text>
  <text start="36.63" dur="5.06">this intro that&amp;#39;s to not waste time so</text>
  <text start="38.67" dur="3.02">let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="46.26" dur="4.36">alright guys if you have five minutes in</text>
  <text start="48.879" dur="3.96">everyday conversation and you want to</text>
  <text start="50.62" dur="4.77">slip in some red pills on the chemtrail</text>
  <text start="52.839" dur="5.281">subject I got a couple suggestions on</text>
  <text start="55.39" dur="5.849">how to do that number one you want to</text>
  <text start="58.12" dur="6.149">specify the terminology right because we</text>
  <text start="61.239" dur="4.74">often call these chemtrails these things</text>
  <text start="64.269" dur="3.481">that are being laid from planes going</text>
  <text start="65.979" dur="4.351">across the sky that stay there all day</text>
  <text start="67.75" dur="4.95">we term it as chemtrails we heard it</text>
  <text start="70.33" dur="3.75">termed even in the mainstream media when</text>
  <text start="72.7" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to debunk and ridicule</text>
  <text start="74.08" dur="5.13">the issue yeah chemtrails chemtrails but</text>
  <text start="76.96" dur="4.32">if you specify the terminology and you</text>
  <text start="79.21" dur="4.829">let the person know that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="81.28" dur="5.789">technically chemtrails it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="84.039" dur="6.451">called geoengineering or solar radiation</text>
  <text start="87.069" dur="5.101">management SRM and you can specify those</text>
  <text start="90.49" dur="4.829">things to the person and actually give</text>
  <text start="92.17" dur="4.83">legitimacy to the issue now when they</text>
  <text start="95.319" dur="3.09">think of the topic they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="97" dur="2.909">think in terms of chemtrails they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.409" dur="3.331">gonna think in terms of geoengineering</text>
  <text start="99.909" dur="5.1">which is what it&amp;#39;s actually called by</text>
  <text start="101.74" dur="5.28">the NOAA by NASA and by various</text>
  <text start="105.009" dur="4.65">government agencies so not only are you</text>
  <text start="107.02" dur="5.01">giving legitimacy to the issue but when</text>
  <text start="109.659" dur="5.67">they go and do their own research on it</text>
  <text start="112.03" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re gonna type in these words not</text>
  <text start="115.329" dur="5.761">that word and thus they&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="117.52" dur="5.489">much different much more legitimate even</text>
  <text start="121.09" dur="6.269">mainstream information that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="123.009" dur="6.301">ridicule or talk down on the topic like</text>
  <text start="127.359" dur="3.901">typing in chemtrails would so that would</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="4.14">be number one number one thing to do</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="3.03">when you&amp;#39;re trying to waken somebody up</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="5.19">to this issue</text>
  <text start="134.29" dur="6.09">number two point out the obvious so a</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="3.81">few things that are just blatantly</text>
  <text start="140.38" dur="4.85">obvious with this topic that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="5.58">know how goes over some people&amp;#39;s heads</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="5.229">chemtrails over our heads have get it</text>
  <text start="148.03" dur="5.579">number one dissipating and lasting</text>
  <text start="150.459" dur="5.641">chemtrails so you can find examples with</text>
  <text start="153.609" dur="5.22">pictures on the internet or even during</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="5.04">you know many days that chemtrails are</text>
  <text start="158.829" dur="5.431">being laid that there is a much bigger</text>
  <text start="161.14" dur="6.81">difference than a contrail and a actual</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="6.18">lasting chem trail that is laid you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="5.49">see the contrail one that&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="5.37">contrail dissipate behind the jet up in</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="4.199">the sky like five hundred to a thousand</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="3.42">feet behind the craft however long it</text>
  <text start="177.639" dur="3.001">stays it&amp;#39;ll dissipate within like</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="3.72">two three seconds and you can see this</text>
  <text start="180.64" dur="4.14">quite often and you still see it now and</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="4.89">like I said you can find pictures of it</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="5.19">wet that are actually contrails now</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="4.02">let&amp;#39;s talk about the lasting trails the</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="4.68">chemtrails are the geoengineering trails</text>
  <text start="191.86" dur="4.83">those suckers last all day man they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="194.65" dur="4.02">go over like what late morning usually</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="3.48">usually would get a nice sunrise and</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="4.92">then mid late morning they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="6.569">going over and one will go to will go</text>
  <text start="203.59" dur="6.929">three will go and those things last all</text>
  <text start="206.739" dur="5.551">day they spread out along the sky they</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="5.761">start getting wispy and then you just</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="5.94">get this like incessant cloud cover and</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re like how the heck how the heck if</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s supposed to be water vapor up</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="6.06">there why is that lasting all day long</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="4.619">right so point that out how obvious that</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="3.69">is that you can see two completely</text>
  <text start="227.349" dur="4.021">different kinds of trails even on the</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="3.659">same day even sometimes at the same time</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="3.239">you can see a contrail over there and</text>
  <text start="233.109" dur="3.21">then a plane actually dumping a trail</text>
  <text start="234.609" dur="4.591">right over there in the sky</text>
  <text start="236.319" dur="6.51">this one here he&amp;#39;ll come on some days we</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="6.93">get completely sunny blue skies all day</text>
  <text start="242.829" dur="4.711">long you know and it doesn&amp;#39;t end up that</text>
  <text start="246.13" dur="3.449">you get some trails over that create</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="4.319">clouds later in the day I&amp;#39;m talking blue</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="5.461">skies from sunrise to sunset and then</text>
  <text start="251.859" dur="4.861">some days it&amp;#39;s completely covered like I</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="3.3">said you just get like the grid pattern</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="2.97">that goes over that&amp;#39;s the thing you can</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="4.62">point out as well Brin powder and how</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="5.61">the heck is that natural or you know not</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="4.38">purposeful but you get that grid pattern</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="5.429">that goes over and then just covers it</text>
  <text start="267.34" dur="5.73">and okay of course they&amp;#39;ll say oh maybe</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="3.87">it was due to the humidity or the</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="3.33">temperature or whatever excuse they</text>
  <text start="274.599" dur="4.471">threw out there in the air that made</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="6.41">those trails not stick and stay into</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="7.17">long lasting trails but the thing is I</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="6.16">noticed this any day any time of year</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="5.46">any temperature any humidity not only</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="5.1">when it&amp;#39;s dry out but when it&amp;#39;s humid</text>
  <text start="291.7" dur="4.41">and wet out or on winter days or summer</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="3.96">days some winter days you get completely</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="4.02">blue skies all day some summer days you</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="3.72">get completely blue skies all day some</text>
  <text start="300.13" dur="3.509">winter skies you&amp;#39;ll get chemtrails</text>
  <text start="301.75" dur="3.36">covering the place some summer skies</text>
  <text start="303.639" dur="4.321">you&amp;#39;ll get chemtrails covering the place</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="5.46">so it&amp;#39;s differing all year but it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="4.15">same thing and that some days are sunny</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.63">some days are covered and</text>
  <text start="312.11" dur="5.4">this one right here skies decades ago so</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="3.75">this one is one that a lot of the older</text>
  <text start="317.51" dur="4.44">generation tends to vibe with because</text>
  <text start="318.95" dur="5.31">they actually have memories of decades</text>
  <text start="321.95" dur="4.68">ago but they often say you know what the</text>
  <text start="324.26" dur="4.11">heck with the heck were you know skies</text>
  <text start="326.63" dur="3.96">back then I remember these blue skies</text>
  <text start="328.37" dur="4.26">never a trail in the sky and then over</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="5.13">the past few decades it&amp;#39;s just become</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="5.76">more prevalent and more prevalent and</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="4.68">funny enough different parts of the</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="3.99">world even you know if you&amp;#39;re typically</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="3.96">in a western city or a western country</text>
  <text start="342.38" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;ll see a lot more chemtrails and you</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="4.23">will if you go to say a whoop</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="4.89">five-minute alarm but I&amp;#39;m gonna keep</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="5.28">going I&amp;#39;m almost done say if you go to a</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="3.96">third world country or just someplace</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s far more remote you don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="3.99">even see the chemtrails so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="3.27">something to point out as well it&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="3.96">days you see them some days you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.98" dur="4.92">some day at times they dissipate</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="4.46">sometimes they don&amp;#39;t so it&amp;#39;s just these</text>
  <text start="365.9" dur="4.17">little inconsistencies the obvious</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="4.72">discrepancies you can point out to</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="6.09">people that&amp;#39;ll hopefully stick and then</text>
  <text start="373.04" dur="5.49">number three quickly here the issue is</text>
  <text start="376.16" dur="4.35">discussed in the mainstream a lot of</text>
  <text start="378.53" dur="4.73">people think this is just made-up this</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="5.16">is a made-up theory that geoengineering</text>
  <text start="383.26" dur="4.27">doesn&amp;#39;t exist but you you know just</text>
  <text start="385.67" dur="3.84">point out the fact that this has been</text>
  <text start="387.53" dur="4.2">talked about in the mainstream and by</text>
  <text start="389.51" dur="5.46">governmental sources for a long time and</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="5.16">especially recently you can point out a</text>
  <text start="394.97" dur="4.41">quick youtube video you send somebody</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="5.36">the link or just say hey go check out</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="5.4">former CIA director John Brennan</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.39">interesting individual there former CIA</text>
  <text start="404.78" dur="3.33">director John Brennan and his speech to</text>
  <text start="406.64" dur="5.37">the Council on Foreign Relations I</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="5.49">believe this was at the end of 2016 if I</text>
  <text start="412.01" dur="4.47">remember correctly is fairly recently in</text>
  <text start="413.6" dur="4.38">the scheme of things like a year or two</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="3.36">ago but anyway he was addressing the</text>
  <text start="417.98" dur="4.62">Council on Foreign Relations and he had</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="4.83">a big talk on geoengineering solar</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="3.69">radiation management right there and you</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="4.65">can watch the video about it on YouTube</text>
  <text start="426.29" dur="5.31">and then this one the actual term and</text>
  <text start="429.32" dur="4.2">the concept geoengineering getting</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="3.9">articles in mainstream media outlets</text>
  <text start="433.52" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;ve seen this happen more and more over</text>
  <text start="435.5" dur="4.77">the past few months especially in that</text>
  <text start="437.78" dur="5.64">the topic of geoengineering is discussed</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="3.69">and it&amp;#39;s discussed in a way that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.42" dur="3.33">trying to</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="4.47">normalize it to the people but these</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="3.72">articles are showing up in the Guardian</text>
  <text start="448.43" dur="3.87">and The Washington Post and actually big</text>
  <text start="450.47" dur="5.129">I want to call them legitimate but</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="6.36">actual corporate media propaganda</text>
  <text start="455.599" dur="4.021">outlets and of course they&amp;#39;re showing up</text>
  <text start="458.66" dur="2.189">for different reasons trying to</text>
  <text start="459.62" dur="2.549">normalize it trying to make us think</text>
  <text start="460.849" dur="3.361">it&amp;#39;s normal trying to make us think we</text>
  <text start="462.169" dur="3.81">need it to combat climate change or</text>
  <text start="464.21" dur="4.41">global warming or whatnot but the fact</text>
  <text start="465.979" dur="5.19">that it&amp;#39;s discussed simply brings</text>
  <text start="468.62" dur="4.32">legitimate legitimacy to it and the fact</text>
  <text start="471.169" dur="3.451">that we&amp;#39;ve got some pretty high</text>
  <text start="472.94" dur="2.94">officials out there talking about it</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="3.21">seriously as well so those are a few</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="3.509">things you can do to help red pill</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="3.99">somebody on the chem trail or</text>
  <text start="479.389" dur="4.441">geoengineering subject bring some</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="3.719">legitimacy to the issue by specifying</text>
  <text start="483.83" dur="3.42">terminology that&amp;#39;ll make you look better</text>
  <text start="485.539" dur="3.81">and that will make their researching</text>
  <text start="487.25" dur="4.47">more effective and efficient for</text>
  <text start="489.349" dur="5.761">awakening them point out the obvious</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="4.62">the things that people should be</text>
  <text start="495.11" dur="2.94">observant enough to notice but</text>
  <text start="496.34" dur="3.21">unfortunately they aren&amp;#39;t you can help</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="3.929">them with that and then number three</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="5.19">tell them how this is talked about in</text>
  <text start="501.979" dur="5.041">the mainstream it&amp;#39;s not some made-up</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="3.51">theory that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all for you guys</text>
  <text start="507.02" dur="4.23">let me know in the comments down below</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="5.669">what topics you want me to do this on</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="4.529">next these are pretty fun to do and they</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="4.201">require some good mental work for me to</text>
