  <text start="12.929" dur="5.701">be on here absolutely and when your</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="5.01">expertise in the gold and silver the</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="3.659">precious metals market and then from</text>
  <text start="20.43" dur="3.75">many reputable sources we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="22.289" dur="4.891">that precious metals like gold and</text>
  <text start="24.18" dur="4.89">silver could be the end of central</text>
  <text start="27.18" dur="4.259">banking you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="29.07" dur="4.829">that I&amp;#39;m always interested in keeping up</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="3.691">on and again with your expertise you</text>
  <text start="33.899" dur="2.521">know what&amp;#39;s the latest what&amp;#39;s the latest</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="2.88">with precious metals what&amp;#39;s the latest</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="5.49">with the Federal Reserve and alternative</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="5.61">currencies yeah I think you know this</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="4.05">year has been a real interesting year</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="5.849">because we&amp;#39;ve started to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="6.21">the central banks really dive in more to</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="5.61">gold and they haven&amp;#39;t passed a Russia</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="4.5">and China obviously have been net buyers</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="4.591">of gold</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="4.74">and I think that people right now are</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="4.2">looking at the landscape the investing</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="8.31">landscape and they&amp;#39;re saying where can I</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="6.95">get a decent safe return and I was</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="3.75">actually just reading an article</text>
  <text start="70.82" dur="5.189">interesting article about gold and</text>
  <text start="73.47" dur="5.329">silver this year that it&amp;#39;s even outpaced</text>
  <text start="76.009" dur="5.561">just this year is outpace the</text>
  <text start="78.799" dur="5.201">investments Warren Buffett in terms of</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="7.369">just growth so it&amp;#39;s been a great year</text>
  <text start="84" dur="6.9">for gold you know I still think Silver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.939" dur="3.371">tremendous and our value gold is</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="3.929">undervalued to the silver I think is</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="4.53">real hot-button people are forgetting</text>
  <text start="94.829" dur="4.171">that you know silver mining has been</text>
  <text start="96.84" dur="5.76">down tremendously for the past ten years</text>
  <text start="99" dur="6.99">and you know really silver mining is</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="6.69">just a it&amp;#39;s a byproduct of the mining of</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="5.489">other metals so it&amp;#39;s you know one of</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="3.509">those things that if they&amp;#39;re not mining</text>
  <text start="111.479" dur="2.64">tremendously core goal they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="112.799" dur="5.46">be mining for silver even though the</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="6.061">uses for silver far outweigh gold so I</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="4.531">think we&amp;#39;re in an interesting</text>
  <text start="120.18" dur="5.61">development in terms of just investing</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="4.56">and then you look at Europe you know</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="5.1">Europe&amp;#39;s a bubble right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re in negative interest rates so</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="2.97">you put money in a bank in some of those</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="5.58">countries and you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="6.63">negative or return so I I think people</text>
  <text start="138.24" dur="3.69">are starting to wake up they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="140.49" dur="5.16">to open their eyes and realize that you</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="5.34">know bullet with a place to be yeah not</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="3.63">just country&amp;#39;s investing money in gold</text>
  <text start="147.27" dur="4.53">and silver but you told me this lately</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="4.41">is that there was this CEO that invested</text>
  <text start="151.8" dur="3.84">millions and millions of his dollars</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="2.58">like all his money into gold and silver</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="4.26">tell us about that</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="6.17">yeah overstock the CEO of overstock who</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="6.81">has been a proponent of alternative</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="6.31">currencies from the get-go overstock has</text>
  <text start="166.71" dur="6.18">been one of the first major companies to</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="5.61">accept Bitcoin as a currency which we</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="4.71">talked about a few times which i think</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="5.4">is fascinating and he believes in</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="4.26">alternative investments he&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="4.23">boggled and silver he recently put</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="5.25">ninety million dollars of his net worth</text>
  <text start="183.99" dur="5.91">in a gold and silver so maybe million</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="5.64">yeah he believes a nine zero yeah nine</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="4.17">zero yeah and he&amp;#39;s always had there was</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="3.78">an article Peters oh he&amp;#39;s always had</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="5.19">enough gold and silver to pay his</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="5.25">employees if let&amp;#39;s say we couldn&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="4.08">fiat money he&amp;#39;s always had enough</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="4.44">cooling the silver to pay them for a</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="5.399">certain amount of time so he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="4.47">prepared he believes that the dollar</text>
  <text start="208.739" dur="4.321">will fail and so he&amp;#39;s putting his money</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="4.95">where his mouth is and it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="4.649">because obviously overstock you know the</text>
  <text start="215.64" dur="4.56">most of the currency transactions are</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="4.261">happening at fiat money people are</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="3.93">buying items there but he still believes</text>
  <text start="221.97" dur="4.17">that you know that currency that</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="4.65">transaction will eventually move on to</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="4.379">two other forms and that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="4.41">hedging his bet with gold and silver so</text>
  <text start="230.519" dur="4.021">when you see these big investors putting</text>
  <text start="233.19" dur="3.06">all this kind of money into it obviously</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="4.86">makes you think that there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="4.97">to her absolutely and with the way that</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="5.46">the gold and silver market over the last</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="6.13">five ten fifteen years has gone up you</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="3.99">know multiple hundreds of percents they</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="2.43">know something they definitely know</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="2.04">something they&amp;#39;re good with their money</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="3.179">that&amp;#39;s why they have a lot of it and</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re putting their money into gold</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="3.06">and silver and what&amp;#39;s all this going on</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="4.351">with the Federal Reserve as well right</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="5.34">now what&amp;#39;s the Fed doing to try to I</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="4.65">guess get a wrangle on the gold and</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="4.321">silver market yes so there was the Fed</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="4.13">is doing the they didn&amp;#39;t announce</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="4.67">quantitative easing phase four</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="4.38">they did and what that means is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="3.84">opened up their balance sheet they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272" dur="4.02">buying short term bonds because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="3.75">seen a lot of volatility there and</text>
  <text start="276.02" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to expand the money</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="3.84">supply which is something that President</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="3.66">Trump has talked about but basically</text>
  <text start="281.78" dur="2.609">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="283.1" dur="5.58">buying bonds they&amp;#39;re gonna they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="284.389" dur="6.331">do what they did in 2008 2009 til 2011</text>
  <text start="288.68" dur="4.26">and they&amp;#39;re gonna expand that that</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="4.11">supply of a bonds and they&amp;#39;re gonna use</text>
  <text start="292.94" dur="3.18">their money and buy those bonds and</text>
  <text start="294.83" dur="3.089">hopefully get more money out there to</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="4.26">stimulate the economy</text>
  <text start="297.919" dur="5.521">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s one it sounds like</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="4.56">more inflation absolutely it is more</text>
  <text start="303.44" dur="3.539">inflation that&amp;#39;s and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="6.09">doing and that&amp;#39;s why when you look at</text>
  <text start="306.979" dur="7.591">how gold perform from 2008 to 2011 it</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="5.52">was a natural reaction to an expanding</text>
  <text start="314.57" dur="3.3">money supply because obviously the value</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="3.119">of the dollar is gonna shrink</text>
  <text start="317.87" dur="3.09">no one&amp;#39;s gonna put their money in the in</text>
  <text start="319.669" dur="3.451">any of those bonds because they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="4.5">gonna drop continuously in value so I</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="4.2">think that what we&amp;#39;re seeing is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="4.23">just we&amp;#39;re kicking the can down the</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="3.99">street everywhere everywhere every</text>
  <text start="329.69" dur="4.5">country is just getting more and more</text>
  <text start="331.31" dur="5.31">debt just just really just building this</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="4.92">you know our you know balance sheet of</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="5.25">the country is 21 trillion in debt right</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="5.76">now so and I&amp;#39;ve read reports that</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="5.31">anywhere from you know 18 to 25 percent</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="5.43">of our budget goes to just paying off</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="5.37">debt and anyone if you just kind of took</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="5.339">your own situation if you were spending</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;re spending 18 to 25 percent of your</text>
  <text start="355.639" dur="4.291">net worth or your what&amp;#39;s coming in</text>
  <text start="357.65" dur="4.049">monthly on dad</text>
  <text start="359.93" dur="4.109">that&amp;#39;s gonna make it very difficult for</text>
  <text start="361.699" dur="4.59">you to grow and I think that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="3.721">what our country is doing right now is</text>
  <text start="366.289" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re just kicking it</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="4.98">down the street going into more debt and</text>
  <text start="369.949" dur="6.541">unfortunately that that&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="6.03">short-sighted investment strategy yes</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="5.58">speaking of growth somebody investing</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="5.22">into precious metals discuss where the</text>
  <text start="382.07" dur="3.81">prices are at now and what you project</text>
  <text start="383.99" dur="5.28">the growth for them to be over the next</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="6.24">say let&amp;#39;s shorter timeframe maybe a year</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="5.13">to two yeah I mean all the major banks</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="5.13">you know they&amp;#39;ve all come out and said</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="3.25">that anywhere from 1,800 to 2,000 by</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="2.65">next</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="5.37">as realistic for goals and I think</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="5.97">silver is is really just undervalued I</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="7.019">think that you know silver is the only</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="7.859">precious metal today that is lower than</text>
  <text start="410.039" dur="5.671">the price it was in the early 1980s so</text>
  <text start="413.729" dur="5.28">think about that think about anything</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="5.1">that you can buy from 1980 and then</text>
  <text start="419.009" dur="4.561">think about it today obviously the cost</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.76">has gone up exponentially except for</text>
  <text start="423.57" dur="4.92">silver silver is the only one so we are</text>
  <text start="426.57" dur="5.58">seeing a tremendous amount of people in</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="6.149">their IRAs buying silver we could move a</text>
  <text start="432.15" dur="5.85">ton of volume obviously a lot of weight</text>
  <text start="434.639" dur="5.31">in the metal which is fantastic and I</text>
  <text start="438" dur="3.81">think you know in the IRA is such a</text>
  <text start="439.949" dur="3.75">great way to do it because if silver</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="3.479">doubles let&amp;#39;s say we get lucky and it</text>
  <text start="443.699" dur="3.661">just doubles over the next 12 to 18</text>
  <text start="445.289" dur="3.781">months you know that investor can always</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="5.19">take some of that profit keep it in the</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.86">IRA and it&amp;#39;s tax deferred so that&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="2.61">know really one of the benefits and</text>
  <text start="453.93" dur="3.299">that&amp;#39;s why a lot of investors are doing</text>
  <text start="455.16" dur="4.289">it within their IRA because it can</text>
  <text start="457.229" dur="4.171">really capitalize on those games take</text>
  <text start="459.449" dur="4.111">some of that profit off if they want and</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="3.449">they would you know defer that tax to a</text>
  <text start="463.56" dur="3.359">later time whereas if you buy it</text>
  <text start="464.849" dur="3.931">outright outside of the IRA it doubles</text>
  <text start="466.919" dur="5.701">you sell it obviously you&amp;#39;ll have to pay</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="6.33">the tax little workaround against the</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="4.859">man right there yeah exactly everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="5.1">everybody needs a you know a tax</text>
  <text start="477.479" dur="4.68">advantage I would say it&amp;#39;s if you know</text>
  <text start="480.21" dur="4.079">if you&amp;#39;re not looking for these these</text>
  <text start="482.159" dur="5.01">and they&amp;#39;re not even loopholes I mean</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="5.551">these are legitimate ways for you to</text>
  <text start="487.169" dur="4.861">avoid paying a lot of tax and I think</text>
  <text start="489.84" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s you know a lot of people right</text>
  <text start="492.03" dur="4.53">now as they get closer to retirement age</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re trying to get into that position</text>
  <text start="496.56" dur="4.5">where they can kind of avoid some of</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="4.44">those big hits and also the great thing</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="4.26">about it is if you don&amp;#39;t have to pay</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="4.799">that big tax hit then you have more</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="3.95">money to invest that&amp;#39;s the beauty behind</text>
  <text start="507.539" dur="4.951">it is that you don&amp;#39;t lose all that</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="4.899">investing power and you know really</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="4.591">at any age is to be able to have that</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="6.3">investment power at your fingertips and</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="5.76">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an exciting time to say the</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="5.159">least with metals I think we&amp;#39;re just at</text>
  <text start="524.52" dur="4.559">the beginning you know stock markets</text>
  <text start="527.279" dur="3.18">still been holding out pretty strong but</text>
  <text start="529.079" dur="1.861">I think a lot of people think next</text>
  <text start="530.459" dur="3.871">year&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="530.94" dur="5.28">the stock market and that&amp;#39;ll be really</text>
  <text start="534.33" dur="3.99">tell you no telltale sign where the</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="4.86">cognitive gotcha and for somebody who</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="4.17">doesn&amp;#39;t really do I are raised or</text>
  <text start="541.08" dur="3.27">retirement funds or things like that and</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="3.57">just wants to look at physical gold and</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="3.9">silver you know what are ways they can</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="3.78">do that and which would you choose gold</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="5.34">or silver or what what&amp;#39;s the case there</text>
  <text start="549.84" dur="6.03">yeah I mean listen we Altima the getting</text>
  <text start="553.59" dur="4.41">education from us a noble goal is the</text>
  <text start="555.87" dur="3.78">most important we we don&amp;#39;t tell anyone</text>
  <text start="558" dur="5.22">to do anything we just give people the</text>
  <text start="559.65" dur="5.13">options I can say that in terms of just</text>
  <text start="563.22" dur="4.11">looking at people that have been bought</text>
  <text start="564.78" dur="5.16">for us over the last 90 days you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.33" dur="5.91">probably looking at pretty close 50-50</text>
  <text start="569.94" dur="4.92">split between gold and silver for us but</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s not to say that you know some</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="3.09">people have done a hundred percents over</text>
  <text start="576.54" dur="5.22">some people have not 100 percent gold</text>
  <text start="577.95" dur="5.52">you know gold is is even though I always</text>
  <text start="581.76" dur="4.08">talk about I talk a lot about silver and</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="4.68">the excitement of silver gold is one of</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="5.4">those assets that every central bank</text>
  <text start="588.15" dur="4.65">owns and very rarely sells I think the</text>
  <text start="591.24" dur="4.74">only central bank that you&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="592.8" dur="6.42">about selling gold was Great Britain in</text>
  <text start="595.98" dur="5.01">2001 2002 it was one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="599.22" dur="4.02">mistakes they&amp;#39;ve ever made financially</text>
  <text start="600.99" dur="4.11">but since then you really don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="4.26">about any of these the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="4.92">selling an eagle you just hear about you</text>
  <text start="607.5" dur="5.94">know countries behind gold ore mining</text>
  <text start="610.02" dur="5.25">gold mines so I think the safe bet is is</text>
  <text start="613.44" dur="4.56">all this gold there&amp;#39;s a lot less gold in</text>
  <text start="615.27" dur="8.43">the world but I do think that the silver</text>
  <text start="618" dur="7.14">is you know if I&amp;#39;m you know choosing I</text>
  <text start="623.7" dur="3.84">would definitely get some silver mine</text>
  <text start="625.14" dur="4.59">and silver will one being a lot cheaper</text>
  <text start="627.54" dur="3.81">you saying it&amp;#39;s very undervalued but</text>
  <text start="629.73" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s also used in a lot more industrial</text>
  <text start="631.35" dur="4.44">processes right right yeah absolutely</text>
  <text start="633.75" dur="4.86">and it&amp;#39;s much more fundable you know</text>
  <text start="635.79" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s a lot of people say well if I</text>
  <text start="638.61" dur="4.83">have to terminate him Barker what am I</text>
  <text start="640.86" dur="7.14">going to do with the you know $1,500</text>
  <text start="643.44" dur="7.83">$1,600 one ounce gold bar and you know</text>
  <text start="648" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s the thing that silver gives you</text>
  <text start="651.27" dur="5.22">is that you can get you know junk silver</text>
  <text start="654.03" dur="4.44">is is a great way for trade ability or</text>
  <text start="656.49" dur="4.38">fungibility you know when you look at</text>
  <text start="658.47" dur="5.04">junk silver which is basically junk</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="3.48">silver our coins that were minted before</text>
  <text start="663.51" dur="3.6">nineteen seven</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="4.35">that actually had silver content so if</text>
  <text start="667.11" dur="5.28">you look at coins were minted before</text>
  <text start="668.7" dur="6.69">1965 there are 90% silver and then 10%</text>
  <text start="672.39" dur="5.7">other metals so you can I have a bag in</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="4.47">that sober for instance and let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="678.09" dur="3.9">you know you needed a trade and barter</text>
  <text start="679.86" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;d have a quarter or a half dollar in</text>
  <text start="681.99" dur="4.05">there that&amp;#39;s worth three to eight</text>
  <text start="684.39" dur="4.34">dollars depending on the price of silver</text>
  <text start="686.04" dur="4.38">at the time so that&amp;#39;s a really good</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="5.23">negotiable</text>
  <text start="690.42" dur="7.35">price so a lot of people will buy that</text>
  <text start="693.96" dur="5.31">silver for just that by itself so they</text>
  <text start="697.77" dur="3.42">have something that lets say the dollar</text>
  <text start="699.27" dur="4.29">falls apart or it falls apart and you</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="4.53">want it you and I want to trade you know</text>
  <text start="703.56" dur="5.4">you got let&amp;#39;s say some kind of food that</text>
  <text start="705.72" dur="5.97">I need I have this silver quarter that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.96" dur="4.68">90% silver and we can train and make a</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="4.17">transaction pretty easily because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="713.64" dur="4.5">low dollar amount so a lot of people</text>
  <text start="715.86" dur="3.93">will buy it for that and then even I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="718.14" dur="3.6">had clients tell me this is kind of a</text>
  <text start="719.79" dur="5.07">funny stories like if you think about</text>
  <text start="721.74" dur="4.35">fast with silver let&amp;#39;s say in junk</text>
  <text start="724.86" dur="2.67">silver like let&amp;#39;s say you just have a</text>
  <text start="726.09" dur="3.54">big charge I&amp;#39;m silver sitting in your</text>
  <text start="727.53" dur="4.11">living room and that big jar could be</text>
  <text start="729.63" dur="4.35">worth let&amp;#39;s say $20,000</text>
  <text start="731.64" dur="3.51">you know big jars silver and then you</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="2.91">know someone comes in to rob the place</text>
  <text start="735.15" dur="3.27">and they&amp;#39;re you know they&amp;#39;re pulling all</text>
  <text start="736.89" dur="3.3">these heavy TVs off the wall and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.42" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re moving all these other items of</text>
  <text start="740.19" dur="4.92">stealing this and that and they can</text>
  <text start="742.38" dur="5.13">literally walk by the most valuable</text>
  <text start="745.11" dur="4.71">thing in the whole place because they</text>
  <text start="747.51" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t know that those quarters and half</text>
  <text start="749.82" dur="3.12">dollars or dimes are actually worth more</text>
  <text start="751.05" dur="4.05">than probably most of the other junk you</text>
  <text start="752.94" dur="4.77">have in your house so there&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="755.1" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a funny analogy but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="757.71" dur="5.1">true and you legitimately no one unless</text>
  <text start="760.11" dur="4.59">they were really savvy they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="762.81" dur="4.62">know that that jar has that twenty</text>
  <text start="764.7" dur="4.53">thousand dollars in silver in it so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="767.43" dur="3.54">had clients just you know they buy it</text>
  <text start="769.23" dur="6.03">because they like having that liquid</text>
  <text start="770.97" dur="7.02">wealth and in a form that is hard for</text>
  <text start="775.26" dur="4.35">for someone to to know the value now</text>
  <text start="777.99" dur="3.12">gold you can fit a million dollars a</text>
  <text start="779.61" dur="3.57">little shoebox and I&amp;#39;m sure if the</text>
  <text start="781.11" dur="3.72">robbery came in and saw you know found</text>
  <text start="783.18" dur="3.24">some gold coins they&amp;#39;re obviously going</text>
  <text start="784.83" dur="3.99">to take those but silver you know junk</text>
  <text start="786.42" dur="5.07">silver probably wouldn&amp;#39;t fit the mold of</text>
  <text start="788.82" dur="3.81">what they would be looking at so you</text>
  <text start="791.49" dur="4.11">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of interesting</text>
  <text start="792.63" dur="4.55">reasons why people are buying it from us</text>
  <text start="795.6" dur="3.38">today I think also if you</text>
  <text start="797.18" dur="3.66">just look at let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re setting up</text>
  <text start="798.98" dur="3.9">your inheritance for your grandkids a</text>
  <text start="800.84" dur="3.93">lot of people costing oh hey I got four</text>
  <text start="802.88" dur="3.57">grandkids I want to set aside a little</text>
  <text start="804.77" dur="5.22">bit for each and it&amp;#39;s a really good way</text>
  <text start="806.45" dur="6.3">to to set aside some wealth that if</text>
  <text start="809.99" dur="4.32">someone passes it&amp;#39;s easy to understand</text>
  <text start="812.75" dur="4.28">the value of it because you just do an</text>
  <text start="814.31" dur="5.52">equal amount for each grandchild and</text>
  <text start="817.03" dur="4.96">it&amp;#39;s there when when you know something</text>
  <text start="819.83" dur="4.32">happens to them and that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="821.99" dur="4.71">combat inflation it&amp;#39;s gonna continuously</text>
  <text start="824.15" dur="4.08">grow year after year and Napoli exactly</text>
  <text start="826.7" dur="3.27">and that and also you know just being</text>
  <text start="828.23" dur="3.87">able to have something private to get to</text>
  <text start="829.97" dur="3.66">them which is a big reason to because</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="3.48">obviously when you pass the government</text>
  <text start="833.63" dur="3.24">you look at all your councillor cash and</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="4.14">everything and they&amp;#39;re gonna you know</text>

  <text start="842.63" dur="4.95">of people that do that too so you know</text>
  <text start="845.81" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different reasons why</text>
  <text start="847.58" dur="4.35">people are setting themselves up with</text>
  <text start="850.07" dur="3.24">gold and silver but we can we can</text>
