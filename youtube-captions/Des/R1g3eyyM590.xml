  <text start="0.199" dur="7.151">yo what&amp;#39;s going on YouTube Jordans safer</text>
  <text start="3.72" dur="6.209">here on September 25th and I am back as</text>
  <text start="7.35" dur="7.11">many of you know at for the past few</text>
  <text start="9.929" dur="6.301">days I was doing an ayahuasca journey so</text>
  <text start="14.46" dur="4.34">I&amp;#39;m here today to tell you a little bit</text>
  <text start="16.23" dur="4.41">about it and share with you the</text>
  <text start="18.8" dur="4.569">understanding that I&amp;#39;ve come to find</text>
  <text start="20.64" dur="5.1">about the process discuss with you a</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="6.031">little bit about psychedelic drugs and</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="5.73">maybe share some video clips that I took</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="6.36">on the retreat I was at but first and</text>
  <text start="31.47" dur="6.9">foremost ayahuasca mama ayahuasca is</text>
  <text start="35.76" dur="4.319">sometimes called what exactly is it I</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="4.08">find that a lot of people are still</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="5.241">unaware of exactly what ayahuasca is so</text>
  <text start="42.45" dur="5.28">I wanna discuss that first ayahuasca</text>
  <text start="45.32" dur="7.96">otherwise known as the vine of the soul</text>
  <text start="47.73" dur="9.419">is a vine that grows in the Amazon in</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="8.31">South America Peru Brazil surrounding</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="8.281">areas and this vine contains the</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="6.51">molecule dimethyltryptamine or DMT now</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="4.59">DMT is also produced in our pineal</text>
  <text start="68.1" dur="5.12">glands our third eye</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="5.88">so when taking this ayahuasca brew</text>
  <text start="73.22" dur="5.89">that&amp;#39;s exactly what it does it opens up</text>
  <text start="75.9" dur="5.94">your pineal gland and allows your mind</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="5.22">to enter into expanded states of</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="4.68">consciousness and this ayahuasca vine</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="4.219">has been used for thousands of years</text>
  <text start="86.52" dur="7.65">traditionally by shamans in the</text>
  <text start="88.549" dur="8.86">Amazonian rainforest now it is very</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="4.739">similar to some other psychedelic</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="4.411">substances that are out there like</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="6.03">mushrooms that I have tried and and some</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="5.339">other substances and I find that the</text>
  <text start="104.939" dur="5.881">whole concept the whole ideology of</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="6.811">psychedelics is very misunderstood in</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="5.78">our culture especially where I&amp;#39;m at in</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="5.1">North America the United States here and</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="3.699">because of the ignorance surrounding</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="2.64">psychedelics there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="3.36">misinformation that gets propagated</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="6.03">because of this and a lot of</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="6.151">misunderstandings that occur now you</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="5.219">know after trying and I&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.96">mushrooms a handful of times I enjoy</text>
  <text start="132.959" dur="2.071">those greatly</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="3.33">every once in a while just for a good</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="5.67">spiritual cleansing and this was my</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="5.46">first time doing ayahuasca psychedelic</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="6.42">substances are nothing to toy around</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="6.24">with these are not drugs in the typical</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="7.35">connotation of that term</text>
  <text start="148.8" dur="7.71">these hour their medicines much better</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="4.62">terminology to use for them psychedelic</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.43">substances are medicines and ayahuasca</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="4.71">in particular is not only physically</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="3.99">cleansing cleansing of the liver and the</text>
  <text start="163.8" dur="4.22">blood and and other bodily systems but</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s emotionally and spiritually</text>
  <text start="168.02" dur="6.64">cleansing and this is exactly why I used</text>
  <text start="172.32" dur="4.68">it why many other people use it why some</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="5.82">people even Travon travel down all the</text>
  <text start="177" dur="5.7">way to Peru to do their journeys some</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="5.19">people do it for weeks multiple sessions</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="7.17">at a time because ayahuasca is very good</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="6.42">at helping to clear past traumas to heal</text>
  <text start="189.87" dur="5.1">your subconscious mind and even your</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="5.07">conscious mind and learn a little bit</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="5.82">more about yourself who you really are</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="6.799">why you&amp;#39;re on this planet here and your</text>
  <text start="200.79" dur="5.82">general purpose in life and I found</text>
  <text start="203.959" dur="5.5">personally on the on the experience of</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="6.15">ayahuasca I did I did two nights of it</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="6.621">and it was very gentle it was a very</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="6.12">gentle experience often times people</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="5.14">throw up get sick to their stomach while</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="4.71">doing ayahuasca that comes often known</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="4.77">as purging your your purging not only</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="4.71">physical vomit out of your body but</text>
  <text start="225.99" dur="5.58">whatever emotional stuff is coming up I</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="8.04">didn&amp;#39;t purge I got little queasy but I</text>
  <text start="231.57" dur="7.08">didn&amp;#39;t do that and I didn&amp;#39;t have visions</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="4.47">a lot of people have visions and actual</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="4.2">actually see things and have very</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="4.71">intense experiences doing ayahuasca but</text>
  <text start="242.85" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s not what happened to me and I</text>
  <text start="245.52" dur="3.93">went into it with the I with the</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="4.59">intention of having my experience be</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="5.1">very gentle and that&amp;#39;s exactly what the</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="5.49">ayahuasca vine offered to me this vine</text>
  <text start="254.55" dur="5.369">has a very innate intelligence to it as</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="4.71">you know all herbs do medicinal</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="4.021">psychedelic whatever the case may be but</text>
  <text start="262.02" dur="5.56">ayahuasca in particular there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="9.55">such an intelligence to this herb and</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="9.899">when taking it I it took a while to kick</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="6.209">in I used more than I thought I would</text>
  <text start="277.479" dur="5.101">need and you know I didn&amp;#39;t get sick but</text>
  <text start="279.699" dur="4.891">once it started to kick in I didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="4.11">like I said I didn&amp;#39;t get those visuals I</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="5.25">didn&amp;#39;t get much conscious effect from it</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="6.39">I actually got very tired and in my</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="5.069">first session that I did I fell asleep</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="5.03">for quite a bit of it you know a couple</text>
  <text start="294.909" dur="5.97">hours is usually the ayahuasca journey</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="4.559">takes between five six seven sometimes</text>
  <text start="300.879" dur="5.16">even eight hours it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="302.669" dur="6.881">prolonged dimethyltryptamine I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="5.91">wanna say trip but experience and I fell</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="4.109">asleep for quite a bit of it and near</text>
  <text start="311.949" dur="6.361">the end of the first journey the first</text>
  <text start="313.659" dur="6.781">night when the shaman shaman ista a</text>
  <text start="318.31" dur="4.22">caller you know amazing lady that was</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="5.939">working with us when she called us all</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="7.15">up to basically end the first ceremony</text>
  <text start="326.379" dur="6.001">the first night I woke up but I woke up</text>
  <text start="329.68" dur="6.479">from such a deep trance I almost felt</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="5.49">like I woke up out of waking up like I</text>
  <text start="336.159" dur="3.391">was dreaming inside of a dream inside of</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="2.909">a dream like it was inception going on</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="3.39">in my head or something like that but</text>
  <text start="340.779" dur="6.63">there was some very deep subconscious</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="7.379">healing being done to me and I that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.409" dur="4.26">just how I feel I don&amp;#39;t even know yet</text>
  <text start="350.319" dur="4.291">you know a couple days later I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="351.669" dur="4.65">even know what really occurred and in</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="6.6">the coming days and weeks and even</text>
  <text start="356.319" dur="7.44">months you know I may remember or have</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="5.1">those activations come into my being in</text>
  <text start="363.759" dur="4.111">a more conscious regard but in this</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="3.18">aspect you know I I had no idea what was</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="5.009">being done to me but I was very tired</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="5.76">and the next day you know the first</text>
  <text start="372.879" dur="5.88">night ended ended about 1:00 in the</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="7.56">morning we went to bed woke up the next</text>
  <text start="378.759" dur="12.301">day greatly altered you know I had such</text>
  <text start="382.81" dur="10.409">a feeling of ease contentment whatever I</text>
  <text start="391.06" dur="3.599">want to say I guess that&amp;#39;s the best way</text>
  <text start="393.219" dur="3.06">to say it contentment I mean you can</text>
  <text start="394.659" dur="3.781">even tell if you&amp;#39;ve been following my</text>
  <text start="396.279" dur="4.531">videos for quite a while even the way</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="5.07">I&amp;#39;m speaking to you now is</text>
  <text start="400.81" dur="4.5">probably a little different than a week</text>
  <text start="403.51" dur="4.26">or so ago let alone a few months ago</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="4.32">when my approach to my videos was a</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="4.649">little more awkward so it literally does</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="4.68">have some at least for me and what I</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="3.991">felt in that experience there was some</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="5.28">consum unconscious or subconscious</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="7.37">healing being done to myself then we</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="7.91">went into the second night of this</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="7.96">ceremony and the second night it was</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="6.76">very similar and the second night I went</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="3.42">into it and I I wanted some actual</text>
  <text start="434.26" dur="4.05">deeper healing</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="6.56">I believe the ayahuasca vine the the</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="7.23">spirit that encompasses this plant it</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="5.59">offered me a great introduction in that</text>
  <text start="445.54" dur="3.96">first night because it was very gentle</text>
  <text start="447.31" dur="4.56">and the second night I went into that</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="4.979">experience with more of an intention of</text>
  <text start="451.87" dur="5.46">being wrecked gently you could put it</text>
  <text start="454.479" dur="4.591">because I wanted more shadow work to be</text>
  <text start="457.33" dur="7.22">done I wanted to go into those deeper</text>
  <text start="459.07" dur="8.599">aspects of myself and I&amp;#39;ll explain the</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="6.85">comparisons between psilocybin or</text>
  <text start="467.669" dur="5.651">mushrooms magic mushrooms and ayahuasca</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="9.87">in a minute here but that second night</text>
  <text start="473.32" dur="10.32">once I took the brew I then got into</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="5.67">those states again I didn&amp;#39;t throw up I</text>
  <text start="483.64" dur="7.2">didn&amp;#39;t really see anything consciously</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="7.53">but in the second night it was as if the</text>
  <text start="490.84" dur="5.52">ayahuasca vine understood okay we gave</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="4.41">you the introduction the first night now</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="4.529">where do you want to go the second night</text>
  <text start="498.88" dur="8.69">and it was very interesting because the</text>
  <text start="500.889" dur="8.911">second night it was as if my mind</text>
  <text start="507.57" dur="3.7">because like I said most people get</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="4.95">visions they have visions that come to</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="7.05">them my mind was able to control where</text>
  <text start="514.75" dur="6.36">it wanted to go so I was able to think</text>
  <text start="518.32" dur="6.11">okay this is what I want to review in my</text>
  <text start="521.11" dur="6.419">consciousness right now so I basically</text>
  <text start="524.43" dur="6.21">went through the past eight years in my</text>
  <text start="527.529" dur="5.791">life essentially since high school and</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="3.82">consciously went through all of my</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="3">experiences in those</text>
  <text start="534.46" dur="3.09">lives and really I mean memories were</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="3.72">coming back to me that I hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="4.2">remembered in years and not only this</text>
  <text start="540.04" dur="4.83">but I was going through each of my</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="4.62">traumas and trying to see you know what</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="4.2">was going on in my life what do I need</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="6.93">to heal from what do I need to forgive</text>
  <text start="549.07" dur="6.42">myself from to be able to heal and bring</text>
  <text start="553.3" dur="5.1">more compassion and forgiveness and</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="4.95">gratitude into my being now so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="558.4" dur="3.54">where the second night was I was able to</text>
  <text start="560.44" dur="3.63">control where my thought processes were</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="5.34">going I basically gave myself a little</text>
  <text start="564.07" dur="8.43">life review and then went up to this</text>
  <text start="567.28" dur="7.25">present moment and I don&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="572.5" dur="4.79">asked the plant but I basically</text>
  <text start="574.53" dur="5.56">controlled my own thoughts to be</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="5.08">pondering the ideas of where I should go</text>
  <text start="580.09" dur="4.38">next because you know I have all these</text>
  <text start="582.37" dur="6.02">opportunities I have all this this</text>
  <text start="584.47" dur="6.81">ability and you know there&amp;#39;s so much to</text>
  <text start="588.39" dur="6.7">do there&amp;#39;s so much that it&amp;#39;s possible I</text>
  <text start="591.28" dur="7.65">should say so I was trying to find out</text>
  <text start="595.09" dur="6.33">where I should go next so you know</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="5.37">pondered that for a little bit and after</text>
  <text start="601.42" dur="4.89">that second session I was wiped out I</text>
  <text start="604.3" dur="3.69">actually fell asleep right there in the</text>
  <text start="606.31" dur="3.72">yurt that we were having a ceremony in a</text>
  <text start="607.99" dur="3.36">few people did that most people went out</text>
  <text start="610.03" dur="2.79">to the tents or to their sleeping</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="4.59">arrangements I just passed out right</text>
  <text start="612.82" dur="5.04">there because I was extremely tired from</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="3.84">all the work both conscious and</text>
  <text start="617.86" dur="5.3">subconscious work that was done to me</text>
  <text start="619.78" dur="6.48">over the weekend so I passed out and</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="7.42">that was that woke up then we had the</text>
  <text start="626.26" dur="7.08">closing ceremony on the third day so all</text>
  <text start="630.58" dur="8.37">in all it was a very amazing experience</text>
  <text start="633.34" dur="9.98">and very gentle but there was so much</text>
  <text start="638.95" dur="7.41">work that was done that I did and</text>
  <text start="643.32" dur="7.23">ayahuasca itself is a very powerful</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="7.17">medicine and comparing it to other</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="6.16">psychedelic medicines one&amp;#39;s gonna die</text>
  <text start="653.53" dur="6.56">here it is I mean they all have their</text>
  <text start="656.71" dur="7.11">own personality when I&amp;#39;ve dabbled</text>
  <text start="660.09" dur="5.89">previously in psilocybin it is much</text>
  <text start="663.82" dur="3.43">lighter it&amp;#39;s much lighter of an essence</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="5.61">to that medicine</text>
  <text start="667.25" dur="6.3">and when using ayahuasca it&amp;#39;s much more</text>
  <text start="671.59" dur="3.85">subconscious work of course that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="673.55" dur="5.55">been saying but shadow work that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.44" dur="6.72">doing and a trauma that you&amp;#39;re healing</text>
  <text start="679.1" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s as if you know psilocybin is</text>
  <text start="682.16" dur="4.05">bringing you up into those higher planes</text>
  <text start="683.96" dur="4.23">of existence to you know make you feel</text>
  <text start="686.21" dur="4.31">very blissful but then ayahuasca does</text>
  <text start="688.19" dur="4.68">the same thing but at the same time</text>
  <text start="690.52" dur="4.93">healing those underlying traumas in your</text>
  <text start="692.87" dur="4.17">beings so it&amp;#39;s you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="695.45" dur="3.09">the comparison that I can make because</text>
  <text start="697.04" dur="5.52">those are the only two psychedelic</text>
  <text start="698.54" dur="5.91">substance that I&amp;#39;ve tried and as for the</text>
  <text start="702.56" dur="4.41">future I mean I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m ever</text>
  <text start="704.45" dur="7.29">gonna do ayahuasca again if I&amp;#39;m called</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="6.87">to do it again maybe but I&amp;#39;m very happy</text>
  <text start="711.74" dur="4.47">that I did this experience that I&amp;#39;m able</text>
  <text start="713.84" dur="5.61">to bring my experience to you guys that</text>
  <text start="716.21" dur="5.04">are watching here and offer you some of</text>
  <text start="719.45" dur="5.22">my insights and knowledge that I found</text>
  <text start="721.25" dur="5.61">because again our our understanding</text>
  <text start="724.67" dur="4.23">understanding of psychedelics in this</text>
  <text start="726.86" dur="7.29">society I feel they&amp;#39;re just so skewed</text>
  <text start="728.9" dur="8.64">and we don&amp;#39;t even have to do the plants</text>
  <text start="734.15" dur="5.55">or the mushrooms or I mean even</text>
  <text start="737.54" dur="4.02">marijuana we don&amp;#39;t even have to do these</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="3.24">plants to get a increase in</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="3">consciousness from them it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="742.94" dur="3.96">learning about it you can simply just</text>
  <text start="744.56" dur="4.95">educate yourself about ayahuasca or</text>
  <text start="746.9" dur="4.89">mushrooms or marijuana or anything and</text>
  <text start="749.51" dur="4.53">gain benefit and an increase in</text>
  <text start="751.79" dur="6.99">consciousness just from doing so so if</text>
  <text start="754.04" dur="8.97">you feel called to do ayahuasca or do</text>
  <text start="758.78" dur="6.93">any kind of psychedelics again we best</text>
  <text start="763.01" dur="5.579">learn through experience you can you</text>
  <text start="765.71" dur="5.61">know be a we call it not keyboard</text>
  <text start="768.589" dur="5.191">warrior but you can learn from books and</text>
  <text start="771.32" dur="6.269">articles on the Internet as much as you</text>
  <text start="773.78" dur="7.07">want but nothing is going to compare us</text>
  <text start="777.589" dur="7.591">to actually experiencing and learning</text>
  <text start="780.85" dur="7.63">directly from that because nobody can</text>
  <text start="785.18" dur="4.26">alter or call your personal experience</text>
  <text start="788.48" dur="4.53">faulty</text>
  <text start="789.44" dur="4.55">so again if you&amp;#39;re called to do it go do</text>
  <text start="793.01" dur="3.39">it</text>
  <text start="793.99" dur="3.91">educate yourself you know prepare</text>
  <text start="796.4" dur="3.059">yourself beforehand there was quite a</text>
  <text start="797.9" dur="2.91">bit of cleansing</text>
  <text start="799.459" dur="3.631">you know both physical and spirit</text>
  <text start="800.81" dur="4.14">cleansing that had to occur before I we</text>
  <text start="803.09" dur="5.01">you even do ayahuasca I even did</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="4.53">ayahuasca but you know go do it if it</text>
  <text start="808.1" dur="1.98">calls you if it doesn&amp;#39;t call you that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="809.48" dur="2.19">fine</text>
  <text start="810.08" dur="4.2">still educate yourself about it so</text>
  <text start="811.67" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re not ignorant and then you know go</text>
  <text start="814.28" dur="5.99">into any kind of conversation or</text>
  <text start="816.23" dur="6.9">situation without that understanding and</text>
  <text start="820.27" dur="5.17">other than that yeah I mean that was my</text>
  <text start="823.13" dur="4.5">experience that&amp;#39;s what I found that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="838.19" dur="4.92">want to say you know once I told people</text>
  <text start="840.74" dur="3.78">and posted it especially on the internet</text>
  <text start="843.11" dur="2.31">you know everybody likes to give their</text>
  <text start="844.52" dur="3.12">opinions on the Internet</text>
  <text start="845.42" dur="3.72">once I told people that I was doing</text>
  <text start="847.64" dur="3.24">ayahuasca there was a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="849.14" dur="4.47">said to me you know you&amp;#39;re opening</text>
  <text start="850.88" dur="7.41">yourself up for entity attachments or</text>
  <text start="853.61" dur="8.12">attack from Gnostic beings or or</text>
  <text start="858.29" dur="8.64">spiritual forces or whatever the case is</text>
  <text start="861.73" dur="11.5">yes that&amp;#39;s possible but if you go in</text>
  <text start="866.93" dur="9.15">with that intention of positivity of not</text>
  <text start="873.23" dur="5.13">being harmed by any nefarious entities</text>
  <text start="876.08" dur="5.67">or in it and any negative attachments to</text>
  <text start="878.36" dur="4.92">yourself if you you&amp;#39;re right if you go</text>
  <text start="881.75" dur="5.85">in with that intention if you simply say</text>
  <text start="883.28" dur="7.62">no if you simply assert your own power</text>
  <text start="887.6" dur="5.88">of choice if you your own sovereignty to</text>
  <text start="890.9" dur="4.56">any negative entities and say you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="893.48" dur="5.07">welcome here right you&amp;#39;re not welcome in</text>
  <text start="895.46" dur="4.74">my body in my being in my spirit they</text>
  <text start="898.55" dur="3.48">can&amp;#39;t do anything to you</text>
  <text start="900.2" dur="5.31">so that&amp;#39;s a big thing to understand</text>
  <text start="902.03" dur="6.6">there&amp;#39;s nothing to fear but fear</text>
  <text start="905.51" dur="8.55">yourself there&amp;#39;s nothing to fear when</text>
  <text start="908.63" dur="8.49">doing these medicines but again just</text>
  <text start="914.06" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s all about being aware of what</text>
  <text start="917.12" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re getting yourself into</text>
  <text start="918.11" dur="11.07">physically and spiritually and mentally</text>
  <text start="921.2" dur="11.55">and doing it for your arms also your own</text>
  <text start="929.18" dur="5.05">soul growth not your ego growth because</text>
  <text start="932.75" dur="4.81">that&amp;#39;s when</text>
