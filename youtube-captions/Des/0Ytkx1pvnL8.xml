  <text start="133.97" dur="5.46">on Infowars</text>
  <text start="136.13" dur="7.98">this happened a couple of days ago q</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="8.309">joins Infowars live on air Q joins</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="5.459">Infowars live on air huh have you seen</text>
  <text start="147.739" dur="4.801">this when you read this headline what</text>
  <text start="149.569" dur="5.221">did you think me I just laughed I just</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="4.5">cracked up you think you would really be</text>
  <text start="154.79" dur="4.41">joining Infowars live on air that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="5.25">about the most misleading title I think</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;ve ever seen and you know I see quite</text>
  <text start="162.29" dur="3.18">a few misleading titles from Infowars</text>
  <text start="164" dur="4.41">from time to time but this one just</text>
  <text start="165.47" dur="5.58">takes the cake no no communications</text>
  <text start="168.41" dur="5.04">outside of 8chan we already know that no</text>
  <text start="171.05" dur="5.34">comms and I believe in this interview</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="5.759">least Stranahan even called in straw man</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="4.86">Stranahan he&amp;#39;s bashed on cue time and</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="2.851">again so I mean this is just desperation</text>
  <text start="181.25" dur="2.16">and</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="4.11">for Wars knows that they&amp;#39;re getting so</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="5.58">attacked and so exposed I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="4.83">exposing themselves you know that they</text>
  <text start="188.99" dur="7.68">know that they have to switch gears and</text>
  <text start="191" dur="7.739">start liking cue reporting on cue acting</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="4.23">like they&amp;#39;re being honest just to get</text>
  <text start="198.739" dur="3.72">the views get the clicks but we already</text>
  <text start="200.9" dur="5.43">know they&amp;#39;ve already exposed themselves</text>
  <text start="202.459" dur="6.181">plenty so that&amp;#39;s that no cue was not on</text>
  <text start="206.33" dur="4.56">Infowars let&amp;#39;s straighten that up and</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="4.679">then let&amp;#39;s talk Michael Flynn so I just</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="6.54">saw this an hour or two ago Michael</text>
  <text start="213.319" dur="5.491">Flynn abruptly fires his lawyers huh</text>
  <text start="217.43" dur="3.809">roughly fires his lawyers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="5.34">calling it a potential change in his</text>
  <text start="221.239" dur="4.711">legal strategy I don&amp;#39;t think this is a</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="4.61">change in anything I think this was</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="4.98">probably a part of the plan long ago and</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="4.84">let&amp;#39;s just take a look at Michael</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="5.339">Flynn&amp;#39;s situation he pleaded guilty to</text>
  <text start="233.6" dur="5.46">something he wasn&amp;#39;t guilty of why did he</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="5.521">do that think legal injection how do you</text>
  <text start="239.06" dur="4.98">legally inject his testimony into a</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="5.43">court or into federal investigations</text>
  <text start="244.04" dur="4.68">well he pleads guilty he interviews with</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="4.44">the special counsel what he interviewed</text>
  <text start="248.72" dur="5.07">18 19 times with them there you go</text>
  <text start="251.66" dur="4.889">now that that&amp;#39;s done special counsels</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="5.539">wrapping up Michael Flynn can change</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="5.611">pace and it&amp;#39;s time for offense right so</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="4.751">Thank You general Flynn hope you get</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="3.509">exonerated I know you will and I know</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re gonna continue doing great work</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="3.81">for this country so that&amp;#39;s why I think</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="4.56">we need to support him right and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.479" dur="5.101">why I will be supporting him next topic</text>

  <text start="1151.58" dur="5.28">that were going on in Arkansas there so</text>
  <text start="1154.49" dur="5.91">the fact that just three months later</text>
  <text start="1156.86" dur="6.36">she was now shot to death reportedly I</text>
  <text start="1160.4" dur="6.36">mean just very suspicious suspicious and</text>
  <text start="1163.22" dur="5.01">prayers to her and her family again I</text>
  <text start="1166.76" dur="3.24">really hope there&amp;#39;s nothing deeper to</text>
  <text start="1168.23" dur="3.09">all this stuff going on because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1170" dur="3.39">like to see that sort of violence and</text>
  <text start="1171.32" dur="4.44">nonsense occurring and then last</text>
  <text start="1173.39" dur="4.01">suspicious death to report on then I</text>
  <text start="1175.76" dur="5.64">have two more articles to finish up</text>
  <text start="1177.4" dur="7.09">former Oklahoma State Senator found dead</text>
  <text start="1181.4" dur="4.95">in his home this is breaking again just</text>
  <text start="1184.49" dur="3.69">this morning I just saw it I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1186.35" dur="4.47">have it written down on my notes just</text>
  <text start="1188.18" dur="4.68">showing you guys the article here and he</text>
  <text start="1190.82" dur="6.87">died of an apparent gunshot wound</text>
  <text start="1192.86" dur="6.66">so doesn&amp;#39;t say self-inflicted officers</text>
  <text start="1197.69" dur="3.66">are still working to determine the exact</text>
  <text start="1199.52" dur="3.21">cause and manner of the death so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1201.35" dur="3.45">know if it&amp;#39;s self-inflicted or not but</text>
  <text start="1202.73" dur="5.94">nevertheless another gunshot wound so</text>
  <text start="1204.8" dur="8.4">quite a few individuals being found dead</text>
  <text start="1208.67" dur="6.6">from gunshot wounds suspicious it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1213.2" dur="4.44">word of the day suspicious so prayers to</text>
  <text start="1215.27" dur="5.34">all of those people that I just listed</text>
  <text start="1217.64" dur="5.85">and you know as a more information rolls</text>
  <text start="1220.61" dur="4.35">in I&amp;#39;ll probably put it on Twitter so</text>
  <text start="1223.49" dur="2.73">make sure you go follow me there a lot</text>
  <text start="1224.96" dur="4.89">of this news that I put in these videos</text>
  <text start="1226.22" dur="5.52">goes on Twitter and then last couple of</text>
  <text start="1229.85" dur="4.17">articles this one here Alabama</text>
  <text start="1231.74" dur="5.63">passing a bill requiring chemical</text>
  <text start="1234.02" dur="6.63">castration for certain child molesters</text>
  <text start="1237.37" dur="5.35">gotta say I support that one let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="1240.65" dur="5.85">that mandated on a federal level</text>
  <text start="1242.72" dur="7.62">a few more let&amp;#39;s say or a few less</text>
  <text start="1246.5" dur="6.27">lenient penalties for child molesters</text>
  <text start="1250.34" dur="3.6">and then very last article totally</text>
  <text start="1252.77" dur="2.34">switching topics through what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1253.94" dur="5.07">talking about for a few minutes here but</text>
  <text start="1255.11" dur="7.65">I want to touch on some space topics and</text>
  <text start="1259.01" dur="6.69">Technology a mythical form of space</text>
  <text start="1262.76" dur="4.56">propulsion finally gets a real test this</text>
  <text start="1265.7" dur="3.599">is in the mainstream media in Wired</text>
  <text start="1267.32" dur="3.87">published yesterday they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1269.299" dur="4.26">about what&amp;#39;s called an electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="1271.19" dur="5.16">drive they&amp;#39;re calling it the emdrive or</text>
  <text start="1273.559" dur="4.651">like this ion propulsion works by</text>
  <text start="1276.35" dur="3.78">converting electricity into microwaves</text>
  <text start="1278.21" dur="6.62">and channeling this electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="1280.13" dur="7.2">radiation through a conical chamber huh</text>
  <text start="1284.83" dur="6.069">pretty incredible okay</text>
  <text start="1287.33" dur="6.51">few things about this number one the</text>
  <text start="1290.899" dur="4.731">fact that they&amp;#39;re bringing forth into</text>
  <text start="1293.84" dur="3.93">the public they&amp;#39;re normalizing quote</text>
  <text start="1295.63" dur="3.789">mythical forms of space propulsion</text>
  <text start="1297.77" dur="5.55">basically sort of next-level stuff</text>
  <text start="1299.419" dur="6.961">that&amp;#39;s a good thing but it&amp;#39;s also a bad</text>
  <text start="1303.32" dur="4.38">thing because you know I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="1306.38" dur="3.74">about limited hangouts quite a bit</text>
  <text start="1307.7" dur="5.76">lately and this is sort of that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1310.12" dur="5.98">the best it&amp;#39;s not the deepest of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1313.46" dur="4.65">truly been done electromagnetic space</text>
  <text start="1316.1" dur="4.86">propulsion has been in existence for</text>
  <text start="1318.11" dur="5.069">decades since the 50s at least and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1320.96" dur="4.319">not talking about some like fancy new</text>
  <text start="1323.179" dur="3.811">rocket booster that uses electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="1325.279" dur="4.76">propulsion we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1326.99" dur="4.89">anti-gravity or electrogravitics right</text>
  <text start="1330.039" dur="5.201">electromagnetic propulsion where the</text>
  <text start="1331.88" dur="6">whole craft is in you know it has say</text>
  <text start="1335.24" dur="4.62">some capacitor in the middle of it a</text>
  <text start="1337.88" dur="5.61">superconductor that they&amp;#39;re able to make</text>
  <text start="1339.86" dur="6.449">the whole craft levitate and then have</text>
  <text start="1343.49" dur="5.429">inertial shielding so it&amp;#39;s not subject</text>
  <text start="1346.309" dur="4.5">to the gravity and inertia that say</text>
  <text start="1348.919" dur="3.721">rockets and jets are the whole craft has</text>
  <text start="1350.809" dur="4.201">inertia yielding from the drive it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1352.64" dur="4.56">using so the craft can go near light</text>
  <text start="1355.01" dur="4.139">speed if not faster than light speed and</text>
  <text start="1357.2" dur="5.37">dematerialize and re materialize right</text>
  <text start="1359.149" dur="6.331">so actual secret space program black</text>
  <text start="1362.57" dur="6.18">project propulsion technologies are so</text>
  <text start="1365.48" dur="5.429">far beyond this and they&amp;#39;re not mythical</text>
  <text start="1368.75" dur="3.659">so it&amp;#39;s good that the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1370.909" dur="4.321">is normalizing this sort of stuff in</text>
  <text start="1372.409" dur="5.341">terms of space propulsion and ufos ET</text>
  <text start="1375.23" dur="5.069">life etc etc but again it goes far</text>
  <text start="1377.75" dur="4.409">deeper than what they&amp;#39;re admitting so if</text>
  <text start="1380.299" dur="4.111">you want that deeper truth you&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="1382.159" dur="4.711">find it on your own you gotta</text>
  <text start="1384.41" dur="4.44">the books watch the lectures watch the</text>
  <text start="1386.87" dur="4.02">YouTube videos study the articles study</text>
