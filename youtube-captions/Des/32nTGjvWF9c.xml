  <text start="32.52" dur="3.9">doing my research on everything so get</text>

  <text start="39.39" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s Monday morning I have been able to</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="3.509">do a video in a couple days so I just</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="3.72">wanted to get some stuff out there and</text>
  <text start="44.399" dur="4.651">then after this I&amp;#39;m gonna get to work on</text>

  <text start="52.02" dur="3.629">go over like I said mainly political</text>
  <text start="54.09" dur="6.359">first we&amp;#39;re gonna start off talking</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="7.94">about Putin and Trump of course so you</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="4.35">know caveat though I want to say I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="63.589" dur="3.46">die-hard</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="5.61">pro Trump a lot of people when coming to</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="7.741">me lately assuming I am I&amp;#39;m not but I am</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="6.871">definitely anti anti Trump hysteria okay</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="4.74">so all of these fake news outlets with</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="5.159">all of their propaganda reporting I</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="4.979">think it&amp;#39;s all ridiculous but I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="4.441">necessarily a die-hard Trump supporter</text>
  <text start="84.509" dur="6">he&amp;#39;s done many things that lead me to</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="6.72">believe that he is working for greater</text>
  <text start="90.509" dur="7.051">humanity&amp;#39;s benefit and he&amp;#39;s not a part</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="5.79">of those secret clubs but again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="4.62">things he&amp;#39;s done that I definitely don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="5.1">like as well so I don&amp;#39;t label myself I</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="5.009">don&amp;#39;t label myself as a trumpian or a</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="5.07">conservative or a liberal okay as long</text>
  <text start="107.189" dur="5.101">as something benefits the greater whole</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="5.19">some kind of agendas like I said a</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="5.16">beneficial one I support it okay but</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="7.11">with Trump and Putin right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="6.36">both on vacation weird right</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="5.969">at least to me that&amp;#39;s weird because</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="5.009">right are Russia and US relations at an</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="2.911">all-time low</text>
  <text start="128.819" dur="5.131">it didn&amp;#39;t Trump just sinus</text>
  <text start="130.74" dur="5.4">actions build the other day basically</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="4.08">what was quoted as like the word the</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="3.11">biggest sanctions bill we&amp;#39;ve had yet</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="3.93">against Russia</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="4.81">and then they go both at the same time</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="4.89">take a vacation right afterwards right</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="6.9">this this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense are they</text>
  <text start="146.85" dur="7.2">actually angry at each other or is this</text>
  <text start="150.96" dur="6.06">whole low relations thing sanctions bill</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="5.73">a ploy just to still make it look like</text>
  <text start="157.02" dur="5.94">that Trump and Putin are fighting each</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="5.7">other right because they can&amp;#39;t openly</text>
  <text start="162.96" dur="5.97">work together that would fan the flames</text>
  <text start="165.48" dur="5.22">of all this Russia hysteria right but</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="3.87">let me tell you Putin is still very</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="4.47">happy that Trump won that election I</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re really behind the</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="5.19">scenes fighting each other right I think</text>
  <text start="177.57" dur="5.76">all of these sanctions and these low</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="5.04">relations is just simply a ploy so all</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="4.26">these fake me think news propaganda</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="5.25">media outlets have nothing to run with</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.55">with their baseless Russia gate stories</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="4.02">right so this just was really</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="3.12">interesting to me that I realize you</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="4.08">know they&amp;#39;re on vacation at the same</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="4.85">time that just that doesn&amp;#39;t just happen</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.44">there I think they&amp;#39;re very well still</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="3.67">working together on things behind the</text>
  <text start="203.19" dur="5.04">scenes to take down the deep state and</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="6.12">then we have Trump still tweeting this</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="5.34">is this is funny as he&amp;#39;s on vacation</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="4.62">right just today on August 7th he of</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="4.83">course took to Twitter and did what he</text>
  <text start="215.52" dur="5.67">normally does on Twitter and tweeted up</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="6.57">a storm talking about the fake news</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="6.78">outlets CNN ABC NBC he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="6.21">you know how great the America is that</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="5.61">he is making the fake news Russian</text>
  <text start="231.18" dur="4.53">collusion story which is good but man he</text>
  <text start="233.58" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s a bunch of tweets he&amp;#39;ll it off</text>
  <text start="235.71" dur="4.68">this morning and it blows my mind how</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.07">like an old guy can be such a prolific</text>
  <text start="240.39" dur="3.18">tweeter I mean I get on Twitter and I</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="4.08">still don&amp;#39;t know how the freaking thing</text>
  <text start="243.57" dur="6.72">works so you can tell if you go to my</text>
  <text start="246.48" dur="5.28">Twitter I hardly use it but this story</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="3.93">the headline of this one I found it on</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="4.56">Zero Hedge said John Kelly loses control</text>
  <text start="254.22" dur="4.2">as a vacationing Trump unleashes</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="3.72">angriest tweet storm yet and what they</text>
  <text start="258.42" dur="3.74">were questioning in this article you</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="5.99">know I like 0 heads I</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="5.88">them it says kind of makes you wonder</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="4.17">whether General John Kelly has already</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="5.7">lost control of the White House and what</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="5.16">might that mean for his future but you</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="3.6">know interesting Trump tickets to</text>
  <text start="275.36" dur="5.01">Twitter again and he just meant he must</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="5.7">but just be mad right I bet his job is</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="5.03">tough right now with all the fake news</text>
  <text start="283.04" dur="4.95">outlets reporting everything they are</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="5.86">next we&amp;#39;re gonna go to this this was a</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="6.27">good story not a good story but one that</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="5.91">out lies what&amp;#39;s really going on with the</text>
  <text start="294.26" dur="6.18">proxy armies like Isis and Taliban very</text>
  <text start="297.17" dur="5.73">well so Isis and Taliban basically join</text>
  <text start="300.44" dur="5.25">forces in a deadly village attack in</text>
  <text start="302.9" dur="5.36">Afghanistan just yesterday fifty fifty</text>
  <text start="305.69" dur="5.61">people died was it yesterday</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="7.33">no it was reported yesterday it happened</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="6.81">at the end of last week but this shows</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="4.65">right the ISIS and Taliban joining</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="6.24">forces why why would they join forces</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="7.14">well if the Isis and the Taliban are</text>
  <text start="324.35" dur="5.88">simply proxy armies right if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.38" dur="5.69">both get their funding and their support</text>
  <text start="330.23" dur="6.3">and get their orders potentially from</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="5.29">the deep state or from the certain</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="4.08">factions within the US military</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="3.93">industrial complex well this makes a</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="5.25">whole lot of sense then doesn&amp;#39;t it right</text>
  <text start="342.29" dur="5.61">we can take a very educated guess that</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="6.03">Isis directly receives its funding and</text>
  <text start="347.9" dur="6.78">support from people in American in the</text>
  <text start="351.89" dur="5.64">West let&amp;#39;s say I like the West better so</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="6.84">it might not be just America and the</text>
  <text start="357.53" dur="6.57">Taliban they right they were they were</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="5.13">started a long time ago far before the</text>
  <text start="364.1" dur="4.41">Isis did but right there&amp;#39;s more don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.65" dur="4.2">look more than one proxy army out there</text>
  <text start="368.51" dur="5.43">that the military-industrial complex has</text>
  <text start="370.85" dur="5.55">so now that they&amp;#39;re joining forces what</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.77">does that mean well maybe Isis is</text>
  <text start="376.4" dur="4.5">getting so weak that these proxy armies</text>
  <text start="378.71" dur="4.5">the deep state needs to fuse them to</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="4.32">make them stronger because these proxy</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.08">armies are getting annihilated right</text>
  <text start="385.22" dur="4.5">Isis has been driven basically out of</text>
  <text start="387.29" dur="3.54">Iraq now they&amp;#39;re so desperate the deep</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="2.94">state is so desperate that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="3.339">setting their proxy armies into the</text>
  <text start="392.66" dur="3.099">Philippines Isis is</text>
  <text start="394.169" dur="4.4">we been in the Philippines and now they</text>
  <text start="395.759" dur="5.641">have to join forces in Afghanistan to</text>
  <text start="398.569" dur="5.62">rally up whatever terrorism they can in</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="5.129">the meantime while the deep states proxy</text>
  <text start="404.189" dur="4.32">armies are taken down so that&amp;#39;s that was</text>
  <text start="406.529" dur="4.41">an interesting news story to me Isis and</text>
  <text start="408.509" dur="6.541">Taliban joining forces then we have a</text>
  <text start="410.939" dur="8.16">couple stories about people slamming or</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="6.419">leaving their liberal base and actually</text>
  <text start="419.099" dur="4.68">essentially joining forces with quote</text>
  <text start="421.469" dur="2.94">conservatives again I don&amp;#39;t get into</text>
  <text start="423.779" dur="3.181">labels</text>
  <text start="424.409" dur="6.151">but one thing I do think is des lately</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="7.109">the whole liberal Democrat demographic</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="7.71">has been gravely infiltrated and gravely</text>
  <text start="434.069" dur="8.581">skewed right very brainwashed primarily</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="8.399">by news so an anchor actually left CNN</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="7.62">to join pro-trump they pro-trump media</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="4.351">so your name&amp;#39;s Kate Lima Kennedy if I</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="3.299">got that right</text>
  <text start="451.02" dur="5.79">Mike Kennedy looks right appears in pro</text>
  <text start="453.569" dur="5.97">Trump news video after leaving CNN and</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="4.949">not only did this happen</text>
  <text start="459.539" dur="4.62">but in Silicon Valley there was</text>
  <text start="461.759" dur="5.011">essentially a quote outraged Google</text>
  <text start="464.159" dur="5.13">employee who penned a viral document</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="4.56">slamming the quote anti conservative</text>
  <text start="469.289" dur="3.93">culture which is much better than</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="4.019">calling it the liberal culture because</text>
  <text start="473.219" dur="4.2">you can call somebody a liberal and the</text>
  <text start="475.349" dur="3.93">connotation of that might mean they</text>
  <text start="477.419" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t know there are free being there a</text>
  <text start="479.279" dur="3.241">free spirit but calling it anti</text>
  <text start="481.319" dur="3.21">conservative is much better because</text>
  <text start="482.52" dur="3.899">these people are like a lot of the</text>
  <text start="484.529" dur="4.23">people in the liberal base are like</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="4.891">bloodthirsty for conservative blood so</text>
  <text start="488.759" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a much better wording of how</text>
  <text start="491.31" dur="6.529">to freeze how their minds are operating</text>
  <text start="494.819" dur="5.731">but point being is that a ten page</text>
  <text start="497.839" dur="6.16">document was penned by an unnamed Google</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="5.399">engineer titled Google&amp;#39;s ideological</text>
  <text start="503.999" dur="3.301">echo chamber that criticized the</text>
  <text start="505.949" dur="4.411">company&amp;#39;s left-leaning</text>
  <text start="507.3" dur="6.179">anti conservative culture so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="6.059">really having people begin to give zero</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="6.06">shits about what people think of them</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="5.85">right a lot of people because of the</text>
  <text start="519.539" dur="5.571">brainwashing that the media outlets have</text>
  <text start="522.269" dur="4.94">done over the past year so it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="5.849">as if calling yourself a trump supporter</text>
  <text start="527.209" dur="5.671">is like character suicide of some some</text>
  <text start="530.959" dur="3.421">instances so people are be giving</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="3.84">especially if you&amp;#39;re in like the tech</text>
  <text start="534.38" dur="4.649">industry or media outlets or like</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="4.02">Hollywood or there&amp;#39;s a you know if</text>
  <text start="539.029" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re in certain industries it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="540.74" dur="3.87">greater the the suicide impact the</text>
  <text start="543.079" dur="3.331">ridicule impact you&amp;#39;re gonna get from</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="4.38">calling yourself a trump supporter is</text>
  <text start="546.41" dur="4.2">higher so these people I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.99" dur="4.08">starting to see people give zero shits</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="4.95">and come out of the closet with their</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="7.05">beliefs and really slam a bunch of</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="6.18">people for being unwitting idiots to the</text>
  <text start="560.12" dur="4.29">corporate agenda the deep state agenda</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="8.43">they don&amp;#39;t even know so this is great</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="7.14">people are beginning to to not even</text>
  <text start="570.17" dur="3.81">worry about what people think of them</text>
  <text start="571.55" dur="4.68">and speak their mind and I was just up</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="3.84">in a little town here in Washington</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="4.5">yesterday there was a dude on the</text>
  <text start="577.82" dur="4.5">sidewalk with like six white boards</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="3.57">around that he went on and you know me I</text>
  <text start="582.32" dur="4.709">went to read how the white boards but he</text>
  <text start="584.3" dur="7.26">was slamming the liberal media and he</text>
  <text start="587.029" dur="6.18">was talking about politicians being</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="1.98">blackmailed for pedophilia and all this</text>
  <text start="593.209" dur="2.331">stuff</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="3.989">this dude was on the sidewalk like</text>
  <text start="595.54" dur="3.46">enduring the ridicule from people</text>
  <text start="597.529" dur="2.67">passing by who didn&amp;#39;t agree with them</text>
  <text start="599" dur="3.51">who might not have been aware of some</text>
  <text start="600.199" dur="3.63">things going on but a lot of people</text>
  <text start="602.51" dur="3.36">liked what he was doing on the other</text>
  <text start="603.829" dur="3.931">hand which is cool but again you know</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="4.8">these are all just examples this this</text>
  <text start="607.76" dur="5.73">and what I just mentioned of people not</text>
  <text start="610.67" dur="6.39">caring anymore so I invite you to give</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="4.98">no shits to talk to anybody about the</text>
