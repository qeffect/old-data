  <text start="71.299" dur="5.64">MSM rags to check and that&amp;#39;s what I do I</text>
  <text start="74.6" dur="5.059">check the mainstream media rags every</text>
  <text start="76.939" dur="4.89">day and see what they want to say and</text>
  <text start="79.659" dur="3.85">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do no matter what</text>
  <text start="81.829" dur="4.08">Donald Trump can do they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="83.509" dur="4.5">make him look bad so even if he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="85.909" dur="4.261">straight arming the Kurds to fight Isis</text>
  <text start="88.009" dur="4.53">the mainstream media is got to find a</text>
  <text start="90.17" dur="4.14">way to frame it wrong and in this</text>
  <text start="92.539" dur="7.71">instance they say oh it&amp;#39;s a blow to</text>
  <text start="94.31" dur="7.559">Turkey US relations number one who cares</text>
  <text start="100.249" dur="5.01">about Turkey&amp;#39;s relations right we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.869" dur="5.67">going for the them right here and second</text>
  <text start="105.259" dur="4.801">of all the reason it&amp;#39;s a blow to Turkey</text>
  <text start="107.539" dur="7.14">relations is because who&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="110.06" dur="6.03">primary funders of them them so pretty</text>
  <text start="114.679" dur="3.48">easy pretty easy to spot when you really</text>
  <text start="116.09" dur="4.019">would know what&amp;#39;s going on so again this</text>
  <text start="118.159" dur="4.831">is just the continued takedown of Cabal</text>
  <text start="120.109" dur="5.22">proxies so like I did in my video but</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="3.659">weeks ago Trump and Putin or troll in</text>
  <text start="125.329" dur="4.281">the world and that&amp;#39;s you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.649" dur="4.981">still continuing to do it this is just</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="4.959">another one of those dots that are</text>
  <text start="131.63" dur="6.03">fitting into that puzzle and next we</text>
  <text start="134.569" dur="8.011">have this article which I found on the</text>
  <text start="137.66" dur="8.46">Huffington Post and again write a very</text>
  <text start="142.58" dur="5.55">all cited rag and this one says the</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.63">Trump media a trunk friendly media</text>
  <text start="148.13" dur="5.01">company is going to get even bigger</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="6.72">so the Sinclair Broadcast Group is going</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="5.61">to add more than 200 TV stations or</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="5.79">excuse me it&amp;#39;s gonna own more than 200</text>
  <text start="158.75" dur="5.97">TV stations throughout America through</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="5.58">the acquisition of the tribune media</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="4.44">company now I don&amp;#39;t know if this is</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="4.08">gonna be a good thing or a bad thing</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="6.33">because of course it&amp;#39;s still mass media</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="7.5">but seeing as if it&amp;#39;s Trump media</text>
  <text start="175.49" dur="6.66">friendly as they quote it I&amp;#39;m at least</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="5.7">hopeful there&amp;#39;s not gonna be as much as</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="4.71">much liberal BS out there so we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a good thing this could be</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="5.55">a bad thing I don&amp;#39;t know but anyway keep</text>
  <text start="188.9" dur="4.29">your eye on that one next this was</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="5.37">really cool</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="7.25">the EPA fires teams of scientists teams</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="5.46">of scientists they fired a bunch and</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="6.61">this is freaking awesome because now a</text>
  <text start="203.24" dur="5.999">lot of people that are more unaware of</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="4.439">what&amp;#39;s really going on are like oh the</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="4.831">EPA we need to save the environment you</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="5.551">know science yeah science like praying</text>
  <text start="214.07" dur="6.84">to their science gods the EPA is a crock</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="6.449"> let me tell you and the EPA has I</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t know how many million gallons of</text>
  <text start="223.489" dur="3.081">glyphosate they&amp;#39;ve just let into the</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="3.54">environment because they won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="3.16">label the stuff a carcinogen or talk</text>
  <text start="228.83" dur="3.6">about it right</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="5.94">we know Monsanto owns a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="232.43" dur="5.04">at the EPA and we won&amp;#39;t get into all the</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="4.02">science behind the whole climate change</text>
  <text start="237.47" dur="4.14">stick right now I don&amp;#39;t want to trigger</text>
  <text start="239.69" dur="4.44">too many people in these videos maybe</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="5.19">just a few but not that many but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.13" dur="4.71">be real most of the scientists at the</text>
  <text start="246.8" dur="3.719">EPA are just playing bot off no matter</text>
  <text start="248.84" dur="4.77">what they&amp;#39;re bought off for whether its</text>
  <text start="250.519" dur="4.831">climate change or by Monsanto or whatnot</text>
  <text start="253.61" dur="3.599">so this could be a really good thing</text>
  <text start="255.35" dur="5.91">this could be a really cool thing so</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="6.061">anyway it&amp;#39;s not a fight on science it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="4.08">the fight against corporate science and</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s definitely a good thing in that</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="6.21">fight so props there next futurism this</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="3.75">is a website I like to go to because</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="4.26">they tend to claim that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="3.48">scientific and have all the cutting-edge</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="2.88">research on their website so I like to</text>
  <text start="277.19" dur="2.91">go check them out see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="5.97">saying now and again and see what kind</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="6.75">of either BS or very interesting</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="3.87">disclosures they&amp;#39;re trying to push pawn</text>
  <text start="286.85" dur="3.93">populous and these were two things that</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="4.59">I saw on futures some futurism today</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="6.3">that interested me one of the articles</text>
  <text start="293.12" dur="5.88">was by about NASA and it says a NASA</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="5.01">appears to be looking for partners to</text>
  <text start="299" dur="5.16">help them mine the moon and it says NASA</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="4.23">has released a request for information</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="5.04">that likely points to an interest in</text>
  <text start="306.32" dur="5.22">getting private companies involved in</text>
  <text start="309.2" dur="4.88">mining the moon any partnerships would</text>
  <text start="311.54" dur="4.439">likely marry scientific inquiry and</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="5.02">Economic Opportunity</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="5.671">so bagent interesting let me tell you</text>
  <text start="319.1" dur="4.289">and if you know anything about deeper</text>
  <text start="321.65" dur="4.17">space program projects this is</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="4.621">absolutely nothing new and we all know</text>
  <text start="325.82" dur="4.47">snåsa is just a front organization for</text>
  <text start="328.01" dur="3.659">secretive space programs never a</text>
  <text start="330.29" dur="5.31">straight answer</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="7.291">so right I mean we&amp;#39;ve probably been</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="6.24">mining asteroids for decades but for</text>
  <text start="338.96" dur="4.53">them to admit it it is very interesting</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="5.22">and I&amp;#39;ll get more to that in a minute</text>
  <text start="343.49" dur="5.85">and they also had another article that</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="4.5">said a new transparent conductive</text>
  <text start="349.34" dur="4.079">material is set to revolutionize our</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="3.51">electronics that was that one and it</text>
  <text start="353.419" dur="4.681">says researchers at the University of</text>
  <text start="355.07" dur="4.65">Minnesota have created a new transparent</text>
  <text start="358.1" dur="4.2">conductive material and this material</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="4.919">could revolutionize how we build</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="4.08">electronic devices and solar cells so</text>
  <text start="364.639" dur="5.25">this article is basically saying it like</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="5.13">this thing revolutionizes everything</text>
  <text start="369.889" dur="5.161">everything that&amp;#39;s made that&amp;#39;s electronic</text>
  <text start="371.51" dur="6.93">this revolutionizes again technology</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="5.929">that they probably had for decades but</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re leaking on to the populace now</text>
  <text start="380.979" dur="4.81">okay now let me explain a little bit</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="5.28">more I have written down here distract</text>
  <text start="385.789" dur="5.911">and disclose because that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="389.03" dur="4.02">mo that&amp;#39;s the modus operandi I see with</text>
  <text start="391.7" dur="5.67">these futurism articles that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.05" dur="7.53">trying to do so while the cabal let me</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="5.1">let me say this we know the cabal is</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="3.18">losing power the powers that be we know</text>
  <text start="402.47" dur="3.9">their time is getting nearer and nearer</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="3.96">we know lots of information is coming to</text>
  <text start="406.37" dur="2">light things are getting disclosed</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="4.88">people</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="7.2">pissed off rests are coming soon we know</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="5.61">that so I think what they&amp;#39;re doing here</text>
  <text start="415.57" dur="3.599">with these futurism articles and a lot</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="3.75">of the other articles that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="419.169" dur="5.641">covering in regards to disclosing stuff</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="4.86">a lot of you know seeds of consciousness</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="3.57">being planted one thing they could very</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="4.349">well be doing is while they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="428.38" dur="5.37">distract with you know as much as they</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="4.741">can with their Isis stick and as much as</text>
  <text start="433.75" dur="4.08">the the deep state of the cabal can</text>
  <text start="435.91" dur="4.92">distract with North Korea they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="4.86">so and you know the whole Russia you</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="3.24">know blame the Russian thing as much as</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="4.229">they can distract with all of that they</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="4.379">are doing while they&amp;#39;re just disclosing</text>
  <text start="446.919" dur="3.271">all the freaking information like this</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="3.891">that&amp;#39;s why the word of the words the day</text>
  <text start="450.19" dur="7.44">distracting disclosed right double d&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="7.63">and it&amp;#39;s very interesting to note this</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="3.9">article was basically saying and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="3.69">seen a couple other articles in regards</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="3.72">to like sending tourists and space and</text>
  <text start="463.66" dur="2.16">getting people on the moon in the past</text>
  <text start="465.25" dur="2.76">couple days</text>
  <text start="465.82" dur="3.42">all of these timelines for doing that</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="1.86">are did getting like shorter and shorter</text>
  <text start="469.24" dur="2.399">and shorter</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="3.99">just a couple of years ago even just</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="3.75">last year right articles would say oh</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="7.35">you know we&amp;#39;re gonna get to the moon by</text>
  <text start="475.389" dur="10.321">2030 or 2040 or something near ish but</text>
  <text start="481.21" dur="6.209">still a few years out right now articles</text>
  <text start="485.71" dur="3.63">are like oh we&amp;#39;re gonna spend tourists</text>
  <text start="487.419" dur="3.781">into space by next year we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="489.34" dur="2.88">start mining the moon by 2018 or</text>
  <text start="491.2" dur="4.35">something like that really like</text>
  <text start="492.22" dur="6">ridiculously close time sets yeah time</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="5.07">time frames so essentially like I say</text>
  <text start="498.22" dur="4.56">what they&amp;#39;re doing is trying to like get</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="4.799">as much of this information out faster</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="4.08">and faster - then say get to a point</text>
  <text start="505.419" dur="3.361">where it&amp;#39;s like oh there&amp;#39;s no secrets</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="3.63">anymore oh we were never holding</text>
  <text start="508.78" dur="3.09">anything back right it&amp;#39;s like the mass</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="2.52">public they&amp;#39;re unaware they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="2.82">what&amp;#39;s going on so they see all this</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="3.69">stuff they&amp;#39;re like oh technology&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.69" dur="4.769">getting really really fast but people</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="4.23">who are aware and do see more so of</text>
  <text start="519.459" dur="3.51">what&amp;#39;s going on with the big picture are</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="4.02">like me for instance we&amp;#39;re seeing it as</text>
  <text start="522.969" dur="3.751">like oh they&amp;#39;re just trying to disclose</text>
  <text start="524.95" dur="3.24">all the they already had cuz they</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="3.72">know they&amp;#39;re you know their asses on</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="5.399">fire so those those the ideas that I</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="5.519">want to offer to you guys about that now</text>
  <text start="533.589" dur="3.631">we&amp;#39;re going to get into Hanford Hanford</text>
  <text start="535.959" dur="4.111">structure collapse this just happened a</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="5.4">few hours ago but in Washington state my</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="4.14">home state the Hanford nuclear</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="3.78">I had one of their tunnels collapsed</text>
  <text start="544.21" dur="6.06">where they used to house radioactive</text>
  <text start="546.4" dur="7.85">material and when it comes to this one I</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="6.15">don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything freaking</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="5.89">that keeps going on I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="4.79">there&amp;#39;s anything nefarious with this you</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="3.57">know some people are gonna pull the</text>

  <text start="571.45" dur="3.39">thought to have you you always got to</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="4.05">look things from all perspectives but</text>
  <text start="574.84" dur="4.47">when it comes to Hanford I&amp;#39;m driven by</text>

  <text start="579.31" dur="7.5">probably just collapsed cuz its decrepit</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="7.52">and you know mr. guy there the moral of</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="5.52">the story with this one though is that</text>
  <text start="588.93" dur="5.86">we don&amp;#39;t need we don&amp;#39;t need nuclear</text>
  <text start="592.33" dur="5.28">power we haven&amp;#39;t needed nuclear power in</text>
  <text start="594.79" dur="4.83">decades we don&amp;#39;t I mean we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="597.61" dur="5.78">any of this stuff it&amp;#39;s all nonsense we</text>
  <text start="599.62" dur="7.8">could literally transform the world with</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="5.95">zero-point energy technology in months</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="4.29">in like weeks in such a little time</text>
  <text start="609.34" dur="5.31">frame we could literally clean up all</text>
  <text start="611.71" dur="5.37">the radiations of Fukushima has output</text>
  <text start="614.65" dur="4.47">in like days if not weeks with the</text>
  <text start="617.08" dur="4.77">technology that exists it can happen</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s very well possible so what we need</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="5.19">to do is get people to a conscious</text>
  <text start="624.22" dur="5.49">understanding that nuclear power is</text>
  <text start="627.04" dur="4.8">dangerous and dirty and there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="629.71" dur="6.24">why so many UFO sightings have occurred</text>
  <text start="631.84" dur="5.81">around nuclear silos and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="4.53">actually been reports of</text>
  <text start="637.65" dur="5.62">extraterrestrial vehicles powering down</text>
  <text start="640.48" dur="5.13">nuclear silos is because nuclear</text>
  <text start="643.27" dur="5.72">technology is bad we really don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="645.61" dur="6.99">to kill ourselves do we no we don&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="5.14">more of the story let&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.6" dur="5.4">good zero-point energy out and then</text>
  <text start="654.13" dur="5.67">lastly here Russia today had this really</text>
  <text start="658" dur="4.05">interesting article now when it comes to</text>
  <text start="659.8" dur="5.25">Russia today they are like Russian</text>
  <text start="662.05" dur="6.33">mainstream media so they&amp;#39;re not gonna be</text>
  <text start="665.05" dur="6.27">truthful completely but they are gonna</text>
  <text start="668.38" dur="5.22">be more truthful than like CNN and</text>
  <text start="671.32" dur="4.49">American corporate rags and they put</text>
  <text start="673.6" dur="7.46">this little this interesting</text>
  <text start="675.81" dur="8.219">out there today this one says the</text>
  <text start="681.06" dur="5.129">headline here homosapiens not alone may</text>
  <text start="684.029" dur="5.901">have evolved with quote stolen</text>
  <text start="686.189" dur="7.38">technology and then this article in the</text>
  <text start="689.93" dur="5.529">subheading goes to say a trove of early</text>
  <text start="693.569" dur="4.5">human fossils has turned on its head the</text>
  <text start="695.459" dur="5.31">story of our evolution with researchers</text>
  <text start="698.069" dur="7.02">now believing Homo sapiens were not</text>
  <text start="700.769" dur="7.201">alone on the plains of Africa which of</text>
  <text start="705.089" dur="4.521">course I mean again to those who are</text>
  <text start="707.97" dur="4.589">aware and do see the bigger picture and</text>
  <text start="709.61" dur="6.19">write the the ones that are data heavy</text>
  <text start="712.559" dur="5.491">in their brains they know that there is</text>
  <text start="715.8" dur="4.68">many holes in the story of how humans</text>
  <text start="718.05" dur="5.399">actually evolved we&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of</text>
  <text start="720.48" dur="4.2">interesting things messing around there</text>
  <text start="723.449" dur="5.55">that have been messed around with our</text>
  <text start="724.68" dur="5.519">DNA like the fused chromosomes and all</text>
  <text start="728.999" dur="4.111">the junk DNA and all the weird stuff</text>
  <text start="730.199" dur="4.411">like that so there&amp;#39;s definitely things</text>
  <text start="733.11" dur="3.51">they haven&amp;#39;t told us in regards to our</text>
  <text start="734.61" dur="6.18">evolution and standard are we lean</text>
  <text start="736.62" dur="6.149">Darwinian evolution is a big old BS but</text>
  <text start="740.79" dur="3.719">this article literally saying Homo</text>
  <text start="742.769" dur="3.901">sapiens were not alone on the plains of</text>
  <text start="744.509" dur="4.08">Africa that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="746.67" dur="4.289">disclosure out there one where I think</text>
  <text start="748.589" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re really trying to get us to think</text>
  <text start="750.959" dur="3.24">of our history and think of our</text>
  <text start="752.519" dur="3.271">evolution because remember there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="754.199" dur="3.45">many articles coming out now that are</text>
  <text start="755.79" dur="3.96">painting human history to be like</text>
  <text start="757.649" dur="3.901">thousands and thousands of years older</text>
  <text start="759.75" dur="3.509">and so many ancient structures to be out</text>
  <text start="761.55" dur="3.63">there well now they&amp;#39;re saying oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="763.259" dur="3.69">maybe we didn&amp;#39;t evolve alone and of</text>
  <text start="765.18" dur="4.68">course they&amp;#39;re still keeping it in in</text>
  <text start="766.949" dur="4.62">regards to like homo sapiens and like</text>
  <text start="769.86" dur="4.669">chimpanzees and stuff like that but</text>
  <text start="771.569" dur="5.851">imagine right if there were other</text>
  <text start="774.529" dur="5.98">civilizations that were intelligent that</text>
  <text start="777.42" dur="5.219">we&amp;#39;re also actually living with humans</text>
  <text start="780.509" dur="3.841">well of course they don&amp;#39;t say that but</text>
  <text start="782.639" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s just an idea it&amp;#39;s like a subtle</text>
  <text start="784.35" dur="3.87">idea they&amp;#39;re planting into our brains so</text>
