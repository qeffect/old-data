  <text start="135.18" dur="5.43">never really been into but with all the</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="4.65">interest I mean a lot of people talking</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="2.85">about it and potential investors going</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="2.97">to get into it</text>
  <text start="143.46" dur="5.7">what what&amp;#39;s currently going on within</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="5.37">your eyes yeah so you know you and I</text>
  <text start="149.16" dur="3.96">haven&amp;#39;t talked in about six months and</text>
  <text start="151.02" dur="4.68">people have given up the Crypt those</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="4.92">four dead and we just knew that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="4.38">the case and you just have to look at</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="4.35">litecoin went into it&amp;#39;s having it next</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="5.09">month it&amp;#39;s gonna be if that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="7.5">completed and litecoin has gone up over</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="6.76">6x from its low around $20 20 to 25</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="5.16">dollars and we put a target on it of</text>
  <text start="171.93" dur="5.46">$100 and it blew through that it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="175.05" dur="4.53">of settling right now around 95 to a</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="4.89">hundred we think it&amp;#39;s still gonna push a</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="4.5">little bit higher but now bitcoins gonna</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="4.26">take the rain and it&amp;#39;s gonna do the</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="5.04">similar function as what happened with</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="4.71">litecoin these having a bench basically</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="4.8">are eliminating inflation in terms of</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="5.07">new coins being created so it creates a</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="5.069">bit of a scarcity factor and a lot of</text>
  <text start="196.32" dur="5.97">the speculators like to front run those</text>
  <text start="198.989" dur="4.951">moves and and and they lift the price up</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s been a phenomenon since the</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="4.08">beginning of the cryptocurrencies and so</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re looking for Bitcoin you know it</text>
  <text start="208.02" dur="6.09">bottomed out around 2800 we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="6.5">for it to probably end up around 32 to</text>
  <text start="214.11" dur="5.879">36 thousand going into next summer and</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="5.44">we continue to see the demand coming</text>
  <text start="219.989" dur="4.621">from it in terms of just countries</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="3.51">around the world who are debasing their</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="4.74">currencies or having in stable</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="5.34">governments or driving demand for for</text>
  <text start="229.35" dur="5.7">Bitcoin and in the u.s. you&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="5.85">to see now more regulatory interest and</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="5.31">also more institutional interest which</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="4.89">is also driving demand and so we see</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="4.56">Bitcoin continuing to move higher and</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="4.57">Undine that&amp;#39;s great news and I want to</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="3.52">talk about what particular</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="2.94">country&amp;#39;s we need to watch out for him</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s going on worldwide in a minute</text>
  <text start="249.85" dur="4.35">but your estimation of where Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="252.4" dur="3.45">could be at next year actually sounds</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="3.569">conservative compared to some news</text>
  <text start="255.85" dur="5.31">reports that I&amp;#39;ve been seeing lately one</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="5.371">news report said it could potentially be</text>
  <text start="261.16" dur="4.71">at forty thousand by the end of this</text>
  <text start="263.14" dur="4.47">year which is a quadruple and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="3.48">saying maybe 36 by the end of next</text>
  <text start="267.61" dur="4.41">summer nevertheless that&amp;#39;s multiple</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="4.23">reports I&amp;#39;m seeing from you know people</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="5.1">who know the industry that it could make</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="5.63">substantial gains very fast yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="277.12" dur="5.28">look at whether it&amp;#39;s thirty six thousand</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="5.05">next June or forty thousand in December</text>
  <text start="282.4" dur="4.65">is still three times where it is today</text>
  <text start="284.26" dur="4.83">yeah and and i think the the prevailing</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="5.16">assumption is it&amp;#39;s gonna have a big move</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="5.82">and so you know now is the time to be</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="4.86">entering it and it&amp;#39;s consolidating right</text>
  <text start="294.91" dur="5.31">now underneath its downtrend line from</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="4.98">the 2017 high and once it eats through</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="5.73">all those people are saying thank god I</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="5.49">got out it&amp;#39;s gonna blast off and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.95" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a great investment you</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="4.74">know in fact it&amp;#39;s been the best</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="5.79">investment over the last ten years of</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="5.64">anything including gold including Amazon</text>
  <text start="315.37" dur="4.5">including whatever it has a compounded</text>
  <text start="317.92" dur="4.44">annual return that pretty much has</text>
  <text start="319.87" dur="4.04">beaten everybody so it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="4.71">investment we don&amp;#39;t see it changing</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="5.38">governments aren&amp;#39;t changing and banks</text>
  <text start="327.07" dur="4.56">aren&amp;#39;t changing so it&amp;#39;s gonna provide a</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="4.92">place for people to hop off the bus if</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="4.44">you will Jordan and as these as these</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="4.05">countries all start going negative on</text>
  <text start="336.07" dur="4.5">interest rates as these countries start</text>
  <text start="338.26" dur="4.26">getting autocratic and as some of these</text>
  <text start="340.57" dur="5.31">countries will implode because of their</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="6.899">debt and primary countries are we</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="5.43">looking at yeah so the the gorilla is</text>
  <text start="349.419" dur="4.081">China and I&amp;#39;ll get to that one in a</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="3.99">second but you&amp;#39;re looking everywhere in</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="4.65">Europe they&amp;#39;ve gone negative on interest</text>
  <text start="355.3" dur="5.01">rates so the people now putting their</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="4.65">money in their bank you have to pay the</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="4.109">bank for the privilege so people are</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="3.18">like saying okay well why don&amp;#39;t I just</text>
  <text start="364.419" dur="3.571">put my money in the gold or when I put</text>
  <text start="365.98" dur="3.09">my money into crypto you&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="367.99" dur="3.54">charge me for that</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="4.74">and so that&amp;#39;s Europe and then you look</text>
  <text start="371.53" dur="4.199">at countries like India and Turkey</text>
  <text start="373.81" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re having they&amp;#39;re having an</text>
  <text start="375.729" dur="4.081">Argentine they&amp;#39;re having financial</text>
  <text start="377.26" dur="3.64">difficulty so they&amp;#39;re debasing their</text>
  <text start="379.81" dur="3.639">currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="4.98">current account deficits so people are</text>
  <text start="383.449" dur="4.771">opting out of those currencies and the</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="3.78">best easiest and fastest way is to go</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="4.47">ahead and do cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="389.66" dur="4.89">because you also have the added benefit</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="4.02">of getting your money basically out of</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="4.589">the country and if your person of wealth</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="3.66">and you can travel you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="399.139" dur="2.941">worry about getting stopped at the</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="3.419">airport with gold in your pocket right</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re having your bank account seized</text>
  <text start="403.789" dur="5.22">can&amp;#39;t travel with gold it&amp;#39;s heavy yeah</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="4.35">and it&amp;#39;s also then it&amp;#39;s gone and and so</text>
  <text start="409.009" dur="4.261">with crypto you just worry it&amp;#39;s wherever</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="4.049">you are now China is the interesting one</text>
  <text start="413.27" dur="4.649">because China has really been driving</text>
  <text start="414.889" dur="4.771">this demand and China is gonna devalue</text>
  <text start="417.919" dur="4.051">their currency but they also have really</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="4.35">tight what&amp;#39;s called currency controls</text>
  <text start="421.97" dur="4.74">Jordan and the only way really you can</text>
  <text start="424.01" dur="4.23">opt out of that is is that you know they</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="3.3">used to let you do real estate overseas</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="4.17">or cutting back on that used to be able</text>
  <text start="430.01" dur="4.26">to buy businesses overseas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.41" dur="4.319">cutting down on that used to be able to</text>
  <text start="434.27" dur="4.56">buy gold well now they&amp;#39;re making keep it</text>
  <text start="436.729" dur="3.361">in the country so really the only AB and</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="3.36">a lot of these people have left that</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="4.74">have a lot of money is to convert it</text>
  <text start="442.19" dur="6.479">into cryptocurrency primarily Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="6.54">and then by the nature of owning Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="448.669" dur="4.711">it&amp;#39;s out of the country and so whenever</text>
  <text start="451.37" dur="4.56">we see instability or or the or the</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="4.65">Chinese start talking about reduction in</text>
  <text start="455.93" dur="5.459">the yuan you start seeing Bitcoin move</text>
  <text start="458.03" dur="5.669">and so we see it we map it we watch it</text>
  <text start="461.389" dur="3.451">we can see it we say hey guys this next</text>
  <text start="463.699" dur="4.431">week we should get a good movement</text>
  <text start="464.84" dur="6.42">Bitcoin because the Chinese are</text>
  <text start="468.13" dur="5.68">threatening to reduce the value of their</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="4.68">yuan and and they&amp;#39;re gonna do a big move</text>
  <text start="473.81" dur="3.96">Jordan when they do that our stock</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="3.09">markets gonna take a hit but the crypto</text>
  <text start="477.77" dur="4.019">currencies are gonna rock it</text>
  <text start="479.03" dur="4.62">hey so sounds like instability over</text>
  <text start="481.789" dur="5.071">there leads to stability and growth over</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="5.579">here yeah in crypto currency of being</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="5.119">stability also in the u.s. crypto</text>
  <text start="489.229" dur="4.831">currency will be a safe haven yeah is is</text>
  <text start="491.979" dur="5.56">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen internationally</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="4.889">going to affect say the attitudes a lot</text>
  <text start="497.539" dur="3.361">of people have towards crypto currency</text>
  <text start="498.949" dur="4.081">here because the volatility of the</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="3.72">markets I was researching into something</text>
  <text start="503.03" dur="3.54">called hype cycles a little earlier you</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="4.56">know people get excited by and then it</text>
  <text start="506.57" dur="6.69">fades out once things go a little sour</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="5.39">but is the influx of you know that</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="2.749">international money gonna how</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="3.93">sort of stabilize things here and maybe</text>
  <text start="516.009" dur="5.94">turn people on to it bring less</text>
  <text start="518.5" dur="5.729">volatility to the market yes so when</text>
  <text start="521.949" dur="4.171">when things get unstable around the</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="5.61">world the United States gets to be the</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="6.48">most stable okay and and but a lot of</text>
  <text start="529.839" dur="4.891">these countries are erecting walls to</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="4.349">not let people move their assets out of</text>
  <text start="534.73" dur="4.049">their home their host countries so</text>
  <text start="536.949" dur="4.651">really the only and the best and the</text>
  <text start="538.779" dur="4.951">fastest way for people to do that is to</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="4.58">go ahead and and basically convert your</text>
  <text start="543.73" dur="6.21">local currency into into crypto currency</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="5.74">because once you do that the nature of</text>
  <text start="549.94" dur="5.85">the decentralized nature of the crypto</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="6.81">currency allows you just to travel to an</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="5.37">exchange in the US or Canada or wherever</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re gonna go and you can then draw</text>
  <text start="561.16" dur="3.45">that back out and convert it back into</text>

  <text start="589.81" dur="7.769">scene in terms of early adopters at that</text>
  <text start="593.829" dur="6.331">point but now we already have you know</text>
  <text start="597.579" dur="5.221">the adoption rate is higher but also the</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="5.549">awareness rate now is almost like 20 to</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="5.76">25 percent in the US so now when people</text>
  <text start="605.709" dur="5.341">get scared they know that&amp;#39;s an option</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="5.04">for them and people have opened accounts</text>
  <text start="611.05" dur="4.38">you know maybe people haven&amp;#39;t funded it</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="3.39">or put money out when it fell back down</text>
  <text start="615.43" dur="3.69">again but those accounts are still</text>
  <text start="616.99" dur="4.17">active and just takes a second for you</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="4.56">to fund those accounts again or to move</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="3.869">your money out the u.s. goes negative on</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="2.88">interest rates then you&amp;#39;re really gonna</text>
  <text start="625.029" dur="4.951">see done then you&amp;#39;re gonna see those</text>
  <text start="626.56" dur="5.67">outrageous you know 200,000 to 250,000</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="4.44">dollars Bitcoin numbers start coming</text>
  <text start="632.23" dur="3.69">into the fore because people are gonna</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="4.05">worry about is the dollar gonna be worth</text>
  <text start="635.92" dur="5.099">anything at that point it&amp;#39;s great so</text>
  <text start="638.47" dur="3.75">yeah these crypto markets it sounds like</text>
  <text start="641.019" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s gonna get a lot better and a lot</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="4.109">hotter from here and be a lot less less</text>
  <text start="644.589" dur="3.041">volatile than it used to be and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.329" dur="3.491">one last topic</text>
  <text start="647.63" dur="3.93">I want to get into with you well I have</text>
  <text start="649.82" dur="5.91">yet is there&amp;#39;s been a lot of theories</text>
  <text start="651.56" dur="7.47">and ideas that we could get onto your</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="6.15">back on to some sort of gold standard or</text>
  <text start="659.03" dur="5.97">precious metal backed currency here in</text>
  <text start="661.88" dur="5.58">America and I want your thoughts on how</text>
  <text start="665" dur="5.46">the cryptocurrency market could do if</text>
  <text start="667.46" dur="4.68">that happens or and or how the crypto</text>
  <text start="670.46" dur="4.11">and gold markets can work together you</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="5.7">can sort of capitalize on crypto with</text>
  <text start="674.57" dur="5.4">the gold market as well yeah as you know</text>
  <text start="677.84" dur="4.92">Jordan you know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re gold bugs</text>
  <text start="679.97" dur="4.56">here too so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re drill baby drill</text>
  <text start="682.76" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re all of the above anything that</text>
  <text start="684.53" dur="4.65">that provides scarcity we&amp;#39;re interested</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="4.92">in so we trade gold we trade silver we</text>
  <text start="689.18" dur="4.08">trade the miners and we trade the crypto</text>
  <text start="691.64" dur="4.98">currencies yeah I don&amp;#39;t see them as</text>
  <text start="693.26" dur="5.64">either or you see sometimes in 2017 you</text>
  <text start="696.62" dur="4.47">saw it you saw it lagging back and forth</text>
  <text start="698.9" dur="4.62">where where people were buying crypto or</text>
  <text start="701.09" dur="3.99">buying gold and so you saw that going</text>
  <text start="703.52" dur="2.79">back and forth but I think it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="705.08" dur="5.01">get to the point where people are gonna</text>
  <text start="706.31" dur="6.15">be buying both on a go-forward basis and</text>
  <text start="710.09" dur="3.03">and you&amp;#39;re gonna see Kryptos and gold go</text>
  <text start="712.46" dur="3.87">together</text>
  <text start="713.12" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s some talk about having crypto</text>
  <text start="716.33" dur="5.91">gold backed or silver back crypto</text>
  <text start="719.21" dur="5.81">exchanges interesting the in fact first</text>
  <text start="722.24" dur="6.51">Majestic which is a silver miner that</text>
  <text start="725.02" dur="5.65">has a lot of their mines in Mexico he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="728.75" dur="4.44">been he&amp;#39;s been he&amp;#39;s been flashing that</text>
  <text start="730.67" dur="4.26">now couple times saying hey look the</text>
  <text start="733.19" dur="3.36">bankers are basically stealing our</text>
  <text start="734.93" dur="4.59">production because they could sell</text>
  <text start="736.55" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s called naked positions basically</text>
  <text start="739.52" dur="4.41">creating sell orders but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="741.05" dur="3.96">backing it by actually owning silver so</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="3.75">he said well we&amp;#39;ll just do</text>
  <text start="745.01" dur="5.31">cryptocurrency will create a silver back</text>
  <text start="747.68" dur="4.56">cryptocurrency and you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="750.32" dur="5.01">own the cryptocurrency to be able to</text>
  <text start="752.24" dur="5.13">sell silver which means that the price</text>
  <text start="755.33" dur="4.53">of silver and gold will skyrocket</text>
  <text start="757.37" dur="5.19">because you can&amp;#39;t do this up it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="759.86" dur="4.2">naked shorting it&amp;#39;s basically fraud but</text>
  <text start="762.56" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s sanctioned fraud because the</text>
  <text start="764.06" dur="4.68">government sanctions it and so if that</text>
  <text start="767.03" dur="4.08">gets eliminated so that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="768.74" dur="4.26">cryptocurrency can really help any of</text>
  <text start="771.11" dur="4.23">the materials market it happens in the</text>
  <text start="773" dur="4.83">food market to Jordan and you know</text>
  <text start="775.34" dur="4.89">anything that&amp;#39;s commodities related the</text>
  <text start="777.83" dur="2.81">bankers are able to what&amp;#39;s called you</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="2.54">know</text>
  <text start="780.64" dur="5.79">short or sell things they don&amp;#39;t own and</text>
  <text start="782.77" dur="5.25">that drives price down and and because</text>
  <text start="786.43" dur="3.81">people don&amp;#39;t have as much money as the</text>
  <text start="788.02" dur="4.11">banks they have to capitulate but if you</text>
  <text start="790.24" dur="4.41">can&amp;#39;t come to the exchange unless you</text>
  <text start="792.13" dur="4.95">already own something that drives the</text>
  <text start="794.65" dur="3.45">price higher on these commodities so I</text>
  <text start="797.08" dur="4.29">see that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;re gonna work</text>
  <text start="798.1" dur="5.4">together over time and and as things get</text>
  <text start="801.37" dur="5.31">more unstable you&amp;#39;ll start seeing these</text>
  <text start="803.5" dur="4.95">these exchanges rally around you know</text>
  <text start="806.68" dur="3.78">these cryptocurrency you know veritasium</text>
  <text start="808.45" dur="4.05">has been doing it their stock exchanges</text>
  <text start="810.46" dur="3.33">down in the Caribbean and so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="3.48">gonna start seeing more and more of</text>
  <text start="813.79" dur="3.27">those things come to the front when you</text>
  <text start="815.98" dur="3.84">when some of these other countries</text>
  <text start="817.06" dur="5.43">really get into into a tough shape and</text>
  <text start="819.82" dur="5.1">just last week I think you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="822.49" dur="3.75">monologuing here but you just uh you</text>
  <text start="824.92" dur="3.75">know the country that everybody laughed</text>
  <text start="826.24" dur="4.74">at Zimbabwe they put kripp they put</text>
  <text start="828.67" dur="4.05">capital controls on again well guess</text>
  <text start="830.98" dur="4.55">what everybody converted their local</text>
  <text start="832.72" dur="6.45">currency or their dollars into Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="835.53" dur="5.83">instantly and so now that&amp;#39;s how they got</text>
  <text start="839.17" dur="4.47">right around the they got right around</text>
  <text start="841.36" dur="3.48">the currency control so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="843.64" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;re gonna see that but you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="844.84" dur="4.59">them come together and talking about</text>
  <text start="847.27" dur="6.12">gold back trump is going is nominating</text>
  <text start="849.43" dur="5.49">Judy Shelton who is a Gold Bug so I</text>
  <text start="853.39" dur="3.18">think we&amp;#39;re gonna get to the point where</text>
  <text start="854.92" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re gonna probably come to some sort</text>
  <text start="856.57" dur="3.63">of you know pie be a blend I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="858.7" dur="3.06">we can go directly to just a gold</text>
  <text start="860.2" dur="3.93">standard it might be a gold standard and</text>
  <text start="861.76" dur="4.74">real-estate standard cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="864.13" dur="4.62">blended in you know some sort of blend</text>
  <text start="866.5" dur="4.29">it but things of scarcity things that</text>
  <text start="868.75" dur="4.44">you just can&amp;#39;t print out of thin air</text>
  <text start="870.79" dur="4.47">unless it&amp;#39;s backed by an asset that you</text>
  <text start="873.19" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t print out of thin air like we do</text>
  <text start="875.26" dur="4.44">today yeah I think you get there yet the</text>
  <text start="877.78" dur="4.62">debts too much I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s between</text>

  <text start="882.4" dur="4.59">hundred thousand per person in the world</text>
  <text start="884.14" dur="7.38">how much debt has been created so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.99" dur="6.3">unsustainable it&amp;#39;s gonna blow up so if</text>
  <text start="891.52" dur="4.14">and when that precious metal back</text>
  <text start="893.29" dur="3.81">currency happens you think crypto is</text>
  <text start="895.66" dur="4.34">just gonna go right along with that and</text>
  <text start="897.1" dur="6.12">continue to rise yeah without a doubt</text>
  <text start="900" dur="5.65">fantastic and and how are you helping</text>
  <text start="903.22" dur="4.44">people get into crypto and get into</text>
  <text start="905.65" dur="4.23">investing in these sort of quote</text>
  <text start="907.66" dur="5.01">alternative currencies yeah so trade</text>
  <text start="909.88" dur="3.91">genius what we do is we we educate and</text>

  <text start="926.33" dur="5.7">algorithm that we created at basically a</text>
  <text start="929.27" dur="4.65">buying a sell algorithm that we loaded</text>
  <text start="932.03" dur="4.89">on to a software package called trading</text>
  <text start="933.92" dur="5.46">view that our subscribers have access to</text>
  <text start="936.92" dur="5.25">that signal and it literally says buy</text>
