  <text start="8.4" dur="5.22">jordan saylor reporting from the human</text>
  <text start="10.23" dur="5.369">farm here on June 6 2019 I want to take</text>
  <text start="13.62" dur="3.53">a moment and discuss YouTube&amp;#39;s recent</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="4.291">statement about changing their</text>
  <text start="17.15" dur="5.11">censorship so as you may have heard or</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="4.26">read yesterday YouTube announced in a</text>
  <text start="22.26" dur="4.5">blog post that it plans to remove</text>
  <text start="24.15" dur="4.92">thousands of videos from their platform</text>
  <text start="26.76" dur="3.99">we don&amp;#39;t know what exact video z&amp;#39; from</text>
  <text start="29.07" dur="4.079">what exact accounts but nevertheless</text>
  <text start="30.75" dur="4.44">they plan to remove thousands of videos</text>
  <text start="33.149" dur="5.671">for promoting what they&amp;#39;re calling quote</text>
  <text start="35.19" dur="6.75">hate speech and quote extremist views</text>
  <text start="38.82" dur="5.399">among other reasons given and this is</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="5.04">yet more actions being undertaken by</text>
  <text start="44.219" dur="5.61">YouTube as we very well know to combat</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="5.969">the truth but as they say it&amp;#39;s to combat</text>
  <text start="49.829" dur="6.931">misinformation and conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="6.18">and whatever hate speech means now yet</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="4.86">another thing they&amp;#39;re doing you know it</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="4.711">was towards the end of 2017 maybe the</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="5.819">beginning of 2018 if you remember this</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="5.4">YouTube hired 10,000 people to manually</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="4.201">peruse content uploaded to their</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.739">platform and find what they wanted to</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="4.2">ban I guess their algorithms or their AI</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="3.811">wasn&amp;#39;t doing it so they had to hire</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="5.13">thousands of people to manually go</text>
  <text start="77.79" dur="5.189">through content then through 2018 we</text>
  <text start="80.97" dur="4.8">heard stories every few months of</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="5.191">YouTube switching something up to ban</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="5.849">more stuff for of course they&amp;#39;re vague</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="6.15">reasoning and then we get this and like</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="5.521">I said they reasoning extremist views</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="5.009">hate speech that&amp;#39;s almost as vague as</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="3.81">when we hear national security reasons</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="4.29">from the intelligence community right</text>
  <text start="100.95" dur="4.41">hate speech and extremist views could</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="3.481">mean just about anything</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="3.24">now we very well know that there is</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="3.96">actual hate speech and there is</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="5.909">extremist views on YouTube but when they</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="5.669">cast that excuse it&amp;#39;s a very slippery</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="4.231">slope for them to start censoring</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="4.74">citizen journalists censoring</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="4.89">individuals that are asking crucial</text>
  <text start="121.469" dur="4.141">questions and basically banned</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="4.98">truth-telling content okay</text>
  <text start="125.61" dur="4.709">now in The New York Times article that I</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="3.599">read on this I don&amp;#39;t know who is the</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.481">first to report on it but the New York</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="4.291">Times article was one of the very</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="4.86">that I saw intriguing but nevertheless</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="4.74">in the New York Times article it said a</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="5.37">new tube spokesman said algorithm</text>
  <text start="141.24" dur="5.19">changes back in January so six months</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="5.97">ago algorithm changes in January</text>
  <text start="146.43" dur="7.35">resulted in a 50% drop in recommending</text>
  <text start="150" dur="6.6">of conspiracy theory videos well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="5.13">why my subscriber count growth is way</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="4.8">down and probably why the views are down</text>
  <text start="158.91" dur="3.99">on my channel probably many other</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="4.86">channels as well but I have definitely</text>
  <text start="162.9" dur="5.07">personally seen mainly my subscriber</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="4.04">count growth that has dropped</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="6.66">dramatically so no doubt it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="170.3" dur="6.07">YouTube&amp;#39;s algorithm changes and they are</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="4.98">desperate they are so desperate to</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="4.5">maintain the public narrative and I</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="3.93">would imagine many of these big tech</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="6.15">companies right now are also desperately</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="6.36">scared of antitrust violations antitrust</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="5.88">lawsuits against them we know that</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="4.68">earlier this week there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="3.78">different platforms where you literally</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="3.96">can access them they went down across</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="3.66">the nation wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="4.77">were scrubbing data or something that</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="4.35">effect so there&amp;#39;s a lot of problems a</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="3.6">lot of problems for these big tech</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="3.78">companies and a lot of problems for the</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="3.63">deep state to maintain their public</text>
  <text start="208.47" dur="4.02">narrative so this might sound scary</text>
  <text start="210.54" dur="4.2">this might sound Orwellian well number</text>
  <text start="212.49" dur="4.02">one because it is but think of it this</text>
  <text start="214.74" dur="4.32">way think of it positively we are</text>
  <text start="216.51" dur="5.46">winning we are winning the battle of</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="5.49">truth-telling so they&amp;#39;re so scared of</text>
  <text start="221.97" dur="5.76">that that they need to completely rid us</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="5.49">of our accounts on their platforms so</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s absolutely absurd as you guys know</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with plenty of</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="5.25">censorship all across the board at</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="5.07">conferences and on Twitter and Facebook</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="6.99">and especially YouTube for a long time</text>
  <text start="239.55" dur="5.7">so I find it really helpful that the</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="3.66">White House released their censorship</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="4.23">reporting tool just a few weeks ago if</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="4.44">you remember that very soon I will be</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="4.08">finishing my White House statement you</text>
  <text start="251.73" dur="3.75">know I&amp;#39;ve been working on it it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="4.95">couple of pages long and I&amp;#39;m gonna make</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="4.56">a blog post about it when I post it I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="4.32">share it here I&amp;#39;ll tell you guys about</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="5.31">it on YouTube I will post it on my</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="4.53">social media etc because we need to get</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="3.96">this sort of censorship known</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="3.75">another thing that I want to make</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="3.509">another point that I want to make before</text>
  <text start="271.11" dur="3.059">I move on to tell you guys about my</text>
  <text start="272.819" dur="4.59">alternative accounts that you can find</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="4.65">me on but be very careful about who</text>
  <text start="277.409" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re listening to about censorship</text>
  <text start="278.819" dur="4.62">because what I&amp;#39;m noticing is a lot of</text>
  <text start="280.949" dur="4.831">these blue checkmarks on Twitter</text>
  <text start="283.439" dur="4.29">basically what I view is a lot of these</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="2.939">controlled opposition at sets they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.729" dur="3.84">trying to make it like an echo chamber</text>
  <text start="288.719" dur="5.461">and act like only a few people have</text>
  <text start="291.569" dur="4.801">gotten censored and they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="4.32">forgetting about the little guys like me</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="4.049">and all the cue researchers and the</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="4.05">grassroots censorship that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="300.419" dur="5.46">okay they&amp;#39;re trying to make you focus on</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="6.06">individuals like Alex Jones or people</text>
  <text start="305.879" dur="4.021">like that and act like they&amp;#39;re the only</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="3.839">ones that have been censored censored</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="4.769">and forget about the rest of us so when</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="4.5">you see that be very careful there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="314.669" dur="4.351">lot more censorship than what the</text>
  <text start="316.949" dur="4.381">mainstream or even some of these what I</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="4.109">think of mainstream alternative</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="3.329">journalists they&amp;#39;re like alternative</text>
  <text start="323.129" dur="3.84">journalists but they&amp;#39;re still mainstream</text>
  <text start="324.659" dur="2.91">there&amp;#39;s a lot more censorship than they</text>
  <text start="326.969" dur="4.051">claim</text>
  <text start="327.569" dur="5.731">I&amp;#39;ve already seen hundreds of instances</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="3.359">on Twitter of people mentioning that</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="4.2">their accounts have been fully</text>
  <text start="334.379" dur="6.331">demonetised videos removed instances</text>
  <text start="337.5" dur="5.81">like that so it is pervasive this is</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="4.44">very pervasive and like I said</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="4.659">thankfully we have that white house</text>
  <text start="345.15" dur="5.489">reporting tool that I&amp;#39;ll be utilizing</text>

  <text start="363.33" dur="5.639">alternative platforms but we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="5.25">to create echo chambers on alternative</text>
  <text start="368.969" dur="4.2">platforms you know we want to reach the</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="4.229">people who haven&amp;#39;t heard this</text>
