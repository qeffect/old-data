  <text start="0.03" dur="3.24">the UFO issue has always been one of</text>
  <text start="1.68" dur="3.21">ridicule and belittlement but we need to</text>
  <text start="3.27" dur="2.4">adult up and see the reality of this</text>
  <text start="4.89" dur="2.969">situation</text>
  <text start="5.67" dur="4.65">scientific data from NASA itself states</text>
  <text start="7.859" dur="4.381">that there are 40 billion watery planets</text>
  <text start="10.32" dur="3.42">just in our galaxy alone so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="12.24" dur="3.21">arrogant to think that we&amp;#39;re the only</text>
  <text start="13.74" dur="3.539">life-forms here and when you actually</text>
  <text start="15.45" dur="3.12">look at ancient art and scripture there</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="3.42">are countless references to</text>
  <text start="18.57" dur="4.44">extraterrestrials don&amp;#39;t even get me</text>
  <text start="20.699" dur="5.101">started on crop circles they&amp;#39;re symbolic</text>
  <text start="23.01" dur="4.529">hints so with not much critical thought</text>
  <text start="25.8" dur="3.299">at all you can come to the logical</text>
  <text start="27.539" dur="3.421">conclusion that they&amp;#39;ve been here and</text>
  <text start="29.099" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re probably still here waiting for</text>
  <text start="30.96" dur="4.02">us to mature as a civilization and one</text>
  <text start="33.12" dur="4.11">thing that we need to mature about is</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="3.45">why UFOs has been kept secret it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="3.06">that difficult to see that our</text>
  <text start="38.43" dur="4.26">government has gone to great lengths to</text>
  <text start="40.29" dur="4.71">suppress and ridicule the UFO topic even</text>
  <text start="42.69" dur="4.29">going as far to silence some researchers</text>
  <text start="45" dur="4.35">in the million-dollar question is why is</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="3.75">that well one large part of that is</text>
  <text start="49.35" dur="3.599">because of the technology they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="50.73" dur="3.96">to get here the technology used to</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="3.991">propel their vehicles has sometimes been</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="4.169">called zero-point energy and delving</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="3.57">into the science explains how to control</text>
  <text start="58.859" dur="3.511">gravity was simply electricity</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="5.009">zero-point energy has otherwise been</text>
  <text start="62.37" dur="5.91">called free energy so the real reason we</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="4.411">haven&amp;#39;t had full UFO disclosure because</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="4.23">the research associated with it would</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="4.47">literally liberate humanity and let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="4.26">real the powers that be don&amp;#39;t want that</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s their control power and</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="4.95">multitrillion-dollar industries God not</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="3.75">only this but it would open up Pandora&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="4.439">Box regarding the science of human</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="4.68">consciousness and our true human history</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="4.411">so it sounds like we need to start</text>
  <text start="88.14" dur="4.229">asking some questions but here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="3.689">kicker the research regarding</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="3.54">electrogravitics zero-point energy and</text>
  <text start="94.259" dur="3.091">dematerialization systems has been</text>
  <text start="95.909" dur="3.631">around for over a century</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="4.199">during World War two the Nazis were</text>
  <text start="99.54" dur="3.45">delving into this advanced anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="101.549" dur="4.291">research and created what&amp;#39;s known as the</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="5.1">Bell craft and in America in the 1940s</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="4.529">and 50s a scientist named T Townsend</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="4.68">Brown was making metal disk levitate by</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="3.96">simply using electricity his research</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="3.57">was then subsumed into the RAND</text>
  <text start="114.329" dur="3.781">Corporation and many of those Nazi</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="3.45">scientists were shoveled into America</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="3.42">after World War two in Operation</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="3.689">Paperclip and they ended up in these</text>
  <text start="121.53" dur="4.74">military industrial complex deep state</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.771">corporations themselves so some UFOs you</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="4.17">see in the sky might be alien but they</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.56">actually are most likely man-made</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="4.68">vehicles in conclusion</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="3.99">what humanity needs and deserves is the</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="3.839">full disclosure of all of this</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="4.17">information we deserve the truth on the</text>
  <text start="138.959" dur="3.75">UFO subject and all the technology</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="3.42">associated with it because this</text>
  <text start="142.709" dur="3.541">knowledge is what&amp;#39;s going to free our</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="3.959">minds and bring us into that golden age</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="3.66">so keep researching this topic because</text>
  <text start="148.349" dur="3.691">this information is only going to keep</text>

  <text start="152.04" dur="3.9">and his disclosure project and all the</text>
  <text start="154.019" dur="4.231">research that author David Wilcock has</text>
