  <text start="9.96" dur="3.27">been posting too much on YouTube the</text>
  <text start="11.55" dur="2.759">past couple days but don&amp;#39;t worry give it</text>
  <text start="13.23" dur="3">a couple more days I&amp;#39;ll get back to the</text>
  <text start="14.309" dur="5.64">regular routine still wanted to check in</text>
  <text start="16.23" dur="5.459">here and give you guys a video and the</text>
  <text start="19.949" dur="4.891">topic of this video is going to be on</text>
  <text start="21.689" dur="5.76">the most optimal timeline you see this</text>
  <text start="24.84" dur="4.23">morning during my workshop and my</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="3.391">workshop was a hike you know I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="29.07" dur="3.029">want to sit in a stuffy room talking to</text>
  <text start="30.84" dur="3.12">people I was like hey why not just do a</text>
  <text start="32.099" dur="3.451">hike and that&amp;#39;ll be my workshop and it</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="4.439">was fantastic and we had some great</text>
  <text start="35.55" dur="5.46">conversations during the walk and one of</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="5.73">those conversations was on the idea of</text>
  <text start="41.01" dur="5.43">the most optimal timeline now if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="2.7">asking yourself well what exactly does</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="4.709">that mean</text>
  <text start="46.829" dur="6.901">it is a idea mainly in the spiritual</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="4.531">communities people who understand the</text>
  <text start="53.73" dur="6.39">idea of the co-creative consciousness</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="5.969">and what the thought of it manifesting</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="5.7">that optimal timeline means is basically</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="5.701">when you are visualizing using your</text>
  <text start="65.82" dur="3.96">co-creative consciousness to try to</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="4.559">manifest the best timeline the best</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="4.26">future for yourself now if you get</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="3.541">multiple people together and all of</text>
  <text start="74.04" dur="4.439">their thoughts linked up all of their</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="5.13">co-creative consciousnesses in sync well</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="5.25">they have a much greater capacity to</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="5.25">manifest a optimal timeline for</text>
  <text start="83.729" dur="4.32">everybody involved so that&amp;#39;s the idea of</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="4.89">what co-creating the most optimal</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="5.011">timeline is but during this conversation</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="5.399">it got the wheels turning in my head</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="5.699">right and I was asking myself what does</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="5.401">the most optimal timeline exactly mean</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="4.411">and the reason I say that is because I</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="3.599">usually find then when people are</text>
  <text start="103.17" dur="3.989">talking about manifesting the most</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="3.991">optimal timeline what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="5.611">about is manifesting the timeline</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="5.399">manifesting a future from now till you</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="5.18">know some point ahead of ourselves that</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="6.331">is the easiest right that makes them the</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="4.51">happiest they want to manifest that</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="4.959">timeline for themselves</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="4.839">that&amp;#39;s the smoothest ride okay</text>
  <text start="125.799" dur="4.201">now there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that I</text>
  <text start="127.299" dur="5.641">mean it&amp;#39;s good to want things to be easy</text>
  <text start="130" dur="6.45">to get through these very turbulent</text>
  <text start="132.94" dur="6.42">times we are in smoothly but what you</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="5.61">gotta understand is and I&amp;#39;m gonna drop</text>
  <text start="139.36" dur="6.239">an old adage here that I love smooth</text>
  <text start="142.06" dur="6.09">seas never made a skilled sailor right</text>
  <text start="145.599" dur="4.321">and what I brought up in that</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="5.399">conversation earlier was the fact that</text>
  <text start="149.92" dur="6.179">sometimes on that most optimal timeline</text>
  <text start="153.549" dur="4.741">it&amp;#39;s gonna get rough it&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="156.099" dur="5.881">rough and tough and be full of</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="5.61">challenges now if your ego is doing your</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="4.11">thinking for you you might say to</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="4.919">yourself that&amp;#39;s not the most optimal</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="4.649">timeline because it&amp;#39;s tough and it sucks</text>
  <text start="168.819" dur="4.551">and I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with that right</text>
  <text start="170.739" dur="5.821">well here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="7.119">challenge is the only thing that</text>
  <text start="176.56" dur="6.149">stimulates growth okay with a most</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="5.28">optimal timeline do you want that</text>
  <text start="182.709" dur="6.631">timeline to make you into somebody who</text>
  <text start="185.769" dur="6.78">is skillful and conscious and aware and</text>
  <text start="189.34" dur="5.489">is a very high-performing human or do</text>
  <text start="192.549" dur="6.72">you want that timeline to make you into</text>
  <text start="194.829" dur="7.261">somebody who is along for the easy ride</text>
  <text start="199.269" dur="4.5">right who just wants things done for</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="3.66">themselves doesn&amp;#39;t want to have the</text>
  <text start="203.769" dur="4.59">skills to be able to do them or do it</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="4.139">for yourself you see what I&amp;#39;m saying so</text>
  <text start="208.359" dur="4.951">when thinking of that most optimal</text>
  <text start="209.889" dur="7.32">timeline think of something that&amp;#39;s yeah</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="6.6">going to get maybe all of us free get</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="6.18">these powers that be you know done for</text>
  <text start="219.91" dur="7.71">but a timeline that&amp;#39;s going to stimulate</text>
  <text start="223.389" dur="5.761">us to grow and don&amp;#39;t always think maybe</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re in a tough situation right now</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="4.83">right and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="4.56">most optimal timeline for you but later</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="3.089">on in the future you might look back at</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="3.54">these challenges you&amp;#39;re facing right now</text>
  <text start="237.069" dur="3.811">and realize like oh my god that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.29" dur="4.59">exactly what I needed at that point in</text>
  <text start="240.88" dur="6.06">time to grow the example I used this</text>
  <text start="243.88" dur="5.31">morning in the conversation was being in</text>
  <text start="246.94" dur="3.75">a relationship with somebody something</text>
  <text start="249.19" dur="2.699">that everybody can relate to maybe</text>
  <text start="250.69" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re in a relationship that really</text>
  <text start="251.889" dur="4.44">sucks and at this particular point you</text>
  <text start="255.13" dur="3.15">know you think like oh this is</text>
  <text start="256.329" dur="3.331">definitely not what I want for myself in</text>
  <text start="258.28" dur="4.2">my life</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="5.25">for example three years ago myself I was</text>
  <text start="262.48" dur="6.41">in a pretty shitty relationship you know</text>
  <text start="264.91" dur="7.26">two three years ago and it was not fun</text>
  <text start="268.89" dur="5.65">now I got out of that relationship and</text>
  <text start="272.17" dur="4.26">during those times I was like man this</text>
  <text start="274.54" dur="3.45">is like not the you know quote most</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="4.2">optimal timeline for myself that I</text>
  <text start="277.99" dur="4.92">wanted but here&amp;#39;s the thing if I never</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="4.47">would have went through that if that</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="3.39">relationship never ended right I</text>
  <text start="285.1" dur="2.43">wouldn&amp;#39;t be here I wouldn&amp;#39;t be doing</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="4.05">this YouTube thing I wouldn&amp;#39;t be talking</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="5.16">to thousands tens of thousands hundreds</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="5.34">of thousands of people and doing what I</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="4.62">do now so looking back I was creating</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.53">the most optimal timeline for myself in</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="4.38">that moment but in that moment seemed</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="3.63">like it really sucks and it seemed at</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="3.78">that instant like I wasn&amp;#39;t see what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="303.85" dur="6.09">saying so understand that the most</text>
  <text start="305.47" dur="8.18">optimal timeline at this moment might</text>
  <text start="309.94" dur="6.62">suck but it&amp;#39;s gonna harden you into a</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="9.1">much more conscious much more aware much</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="8.32">more skilled human okay so it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.08">dependent on how you view things</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="4.44">remember it&amp;#39;s all perspective it might</text>
  <text start="326.83" dur="4.35">suck it might seem negative now but that</text>
  <text start="329.32" dur="4.41">negativity you&amp;#39;re facing in your life</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="3.87">might be what is the most optimal</text>
  <text start="333.73" dur="4.59">timeline for you okay</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="5.67">so use that co-creative consciousness</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="6.21">always look at every single situation</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re in in a particular light that is</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="4.08">going to make you grow because the</text>
  <text start="345.94" dur="7.74">universe grows that is one of nature&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="7.65">laws we grow okay nature grows life it</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="4.53">grows plants we grow consciousness goes</text>
  <text start="356.26" dur="3.21">through levels of a growth first entity</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="5.43">second density third fourth density</text>
  <text start="359.47" dur="6.15">higher than that right so negative or</text>
  <text start="363.64" dur="4.98">positive I think we&amp;#39;re always on that</text>
  <text start="365.62" dur="6.69">optimal timeline it just depends on what</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="6.11">you are choosing how you are choosing to</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="2.42">look at it</text>
