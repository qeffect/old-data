  <text start="61.36" dur="3.1">[Music]</text>
  <text start="65.47" dur="4.66">first of all shout out to a sponsor of</text>
  <text start="67.67" dur="4.44">today&amp;#39;s video in virtual shield VPN</text>
  <text start="70.13" dur="4.38">virtual private network service</text>
  <text start="72.11" dur="4.83">basically what you do is download their</text>
  <text start="74.51" dur="4.53">app and surf the internet on whatever</text>
  <text start="76.94" dur="4.26">device you normally surf the internet on</text>
  <text start="79.04" dur="5.1">through their app and that helps you do</text>
  <text start="81.2" dur="5.58">many very helpful things number one it</text>
  <text start="84.14" dur="4.38">keeps your IP address anonymous so it</text>
  <text start="86.78" dur="3.089">protects your identity keeping you safe</text>
  <text start="88.52" dur="3.87">and secure when you&amp;#39;re browsing the</text>
  <text start="89.869" dur="4.351">Internet it also keeps your data private</text>
  <text start="92.39" dur="4.74">so no big companies are going to be able</text>
  <text start="94.22" dur="5.069">to track your data and sell it or do</text>
  <text start="97.13" dur="3.9">whatever the heck with it and not just</text>
  <text start="99.289" dur="4.08">keeping you safe and secure and your IP</text>
  <text start="101.03" dur="4.29">address anonymous but if your IP is</text>
  <text start="103.369" dur="3.871">blocked out of any website and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.32" dur="4.29">censored out of that website you can</text>
  <text start="107.24" dur="4.35">change your IP address with a VPN and</text>
  <text start="109.61" dur="4.47">tunnel around that wemp without</text>
  <text start="111.59" dur="4.889">censorship getting into that website so</text>
  <text start="114.08" dur="4.38">a VPN is just super helpful for many</text>
  <text start="116.479" dur="3.661">different things I highly suggest it I</text>
  <text start="118.46" dur="3.75">highly suggest virtual shield because</text>
  <text start="120.14" dur="4.32">they number one do not track your data</text>
  <text start="122.21" dur="4.14">or log your data which is important with</text>
  <text start="124.46" dur="3.719">a VPN and number two they&amp;#39;re super cheap</text>
  <text start="126.35" dur="3.78">you can get their service for two years</text>
  <text start="128.179" dur="3.84">for just three dollars and fifty cents a</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="3.24">month so virtual shield check them out</text>
  <text start="132.019" dur="3.451">they leave some links in the description</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="3.839">for them down below now first order of</text>
  <text start="135.47" dur="3.15">business I want to track some instances</text>
  <text start="137.209" dur="3.421">of censorship that we&amp;#39;ve had in recent</text>
  <text start="138.62" dur="4.14">days on these big tech companies in my</text>
  <text start="140.63" dur="4.889">opinion it&amp;#39;s always good just to track</text>
  <text start="142.76" dur="4.74">this censorship on a daily basis or</text>
  <text start="145.519" dur="4.621">whenever we can and the first one comes</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="5.67">by way of Twitter Twitter shutting down</text>
  <text start="150.14" dur="5.67">the account of the White House reporter</text>
  <text start="153.17" dur="5.25">for one America news network one</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="4.47">American news network I like them I like</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="4.14">them much more than the fake news media</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="4.38">I don&amp;#39;t like any news network 100% but I</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.05">like them a lot more than the fake news</text>
  <text start="164.66" dur="3.78">outlets and it&amp;#39;s just absurd it&amp;#39;s absurd</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="4.62">that their White House reporter got</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="5.7">their account suspended canned and no</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="4.5">specific reason was given if we ever get</text>
  <text start="174.14" dur="3">those from these big tech companies when</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="3.39">they terminate accounts you know Twitter</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="3.48">Facebook YouTube it&amp;#39;s just absurd</text>
  <text start="179.12" dur="4.29">and the other instance of censorship</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="5.28">comes by way of YouTube speaking of them</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="5.01">they blocked the live-streaming ability</text>
  <text start="185.9" dur="6.24">of the right side Broadcasting Network</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="6.149">our SBN and they were a really good</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="4.8">grassroots organization grassroots</text>
  <text start="194.569" dur="4.351">channel that would basically go to every</text>
  <text start="196.94" dur="2.25">single Trump rally and livestream from</text>
  <text start="198.92" dur="2.55">that</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="3.63">probably they went to so many of them it</text>
  <text start="201.47" dur="3.33">was pretty much the only account that I</text>
  <text start="202.82" dur="5.16">would watch livestream Trump rallies</text>
  <text start="204.8" dur="4.08">from for a little while there so sucks</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="3.93">that I&amp;#39;m not gonna be able do that</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="5.55">anymore absurd that they got their live</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="6.54">streaming abilities canned because that</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="5.31">was the crux of their business model</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="3.54">they were getting a lot of funding from</text>
  <text start="219.74" dur="4.29">their Super chats right super chats</text>
  <text start="221.99" dur="5.46">which you donate money live on YouTube</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="5.25">so that just totally Nyx&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="3.93">their abilities a lot of their growth</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="4.68">potential right there so big tech</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="5.61">censorship and no doubt as we come into</text>
  <text start="233.96" dur="5.49">2020 election right that&amp;#39;s why this is</text>
  <text start="236.99" dur="5.25">going on now let&amp;#39;s move on into those</text>
  <text start="239.45" dur="5.01">arrests so first of all the Pennsylvania</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="3.99">State Senator Mike Fullmer he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="244.46" dur="4.8">Republican state senator out of</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="7.56">Pennsylvania arrested on get this child</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="6.12">porn charges so first thing to take note</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="4.22">of here this goes to show you that</text>
  <text start="255.38" dur="5.669">corruption has no political affiliation</text>
  <text start="258.01" dur="4.87">it goes down the left wing it goes down</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="4.801">the right wing right there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="4.62">political corruption in all sides of the</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="3.51">aisle both sides of the coin it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="5.43">that way for a long long time understand</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="5.55">that number two I do find it intriguing</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="4.62">that Donald Trump lately in his tweets</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="5.19">and at his rallies he&amp;#39;s made some sort</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="5.13">of swipes at corrupt Republicans out</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="4.44">there so I wonder if this might have</text>
  <text start="282.68" dur="5.4">anything to do with that or if we might</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="5.43">see more sort of cleansing of the</text>
  <text start="288.08" dur="3.39">Republican Party shall we say because</text>
  <text start="289.97" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s what had to happen right there</text>
  <text start="291.47" dur="3.36">was so much corruption in the Republican</text>
  <text start="292.91" dur="6.03">Party as well as the Democrat that Trump</text>
  <text start="294.83" dur="6.27">and his allied guys political network</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="4.86">the Alliance basically had to first</text>
  <text start="301.1" dur="4.53">sanitize the Republican Party with the</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="3.33">freedom caucus with a bunch of good</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="4.08">people getting in there over the last</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="4.41">few years and then they&amp;#39;re using that</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="3.42">sanitized Republican Party that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.54" dur="3.75">still working on to take down the</text>
  <text start="313.13" dur="4.32">Democrat side so you know it&amp;#39;s both</text>
  <text start="315.29" dur="4.71">sides are being taken down in this great</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="6.15">awakening moving on to the next arrest</text>
  <text start="320" dur="5.7">and buck so right wing arrest now we got</text>
  <text start="323.6" dur="4.77">a left-wing arrest Edie buck Democrat</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="6">donor arrested charged with running a</text>

  <text start="716.01" dur="3.84">putting together the bigger picture</text>
  <text start="717.36" dur="5.69">behind Edward Snowden what he was doing</text>
  <text start="719.85" dur="6.9">as a contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="6.73">was to infiltrate the NSA and undermine</text>
  <text start="726.75" dur="6.37">their data harvesting capabilities</text>
  <text start="729.78" dur="5.68">basically the ability for the NSA to</text>
  <text start="733.12" dur="4.56">fail and monitor the deep state folk the</text>
  <text start="735.46" dur="4.86">CIA was trying to undermine the NSA the</text>
  <text start="737.68" dur="4.83">good guys in military intelligence so</text>
  <text start="740.32" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s what happened with Snowden as</text>
  <text start="742.51" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;ve continuously said when you just</text>
  <text start="745.21" dur="4.41">look at Snowden if he was so damaging</text>
  <text start="747.82" dur="3.48">and threatening to the deep state how</text>
  <text start="749.62" dur="3.51">the heck would he have forty or not</text>

  <text start="756.37" dur="4.71">he have a Hollywood movie filmed the</text>
  <text start="758.71" dur="4.98">named after him just connect these dots</text>
  <text start="761.08" dur="4.53">the deep state wants him out there doing</text>
  <text start="763.69" dur="3.99">what he&amp;#39;s doing right they&amp;#39;re not giving</text>
  <text start="765.61" dur="5.76">you the full shit situation on Snowden</text>
  <text start="767.68" dur="5.22">Snowden did not help the public by</text>

  <text start="772.9" dur="5.34">actually not helping the public by</text>

  <text start="781.9" dur="4.26">all these little pieces of evidence that</text>
  <text start="784.029" dur="5.491">show you that he&amp;#39;s a deep state asset</text>
  <text start="786.16" dur="4.77">the movie the Twitter love he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="789.52" dur="3.84">and not just that but when you take a</text>
  <text start="790.93" dur="4.2">look at his book his recent book that</text>
  <text start="793.36" dur="5.04">came out that the DOJ is suing him for</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s called permanent record well first</text>

  <text start="800.29" dur="4.11">publisher in New York how&amp;#39;s that going</text>
  <text start="803.05" dur="4.229">to happen if the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="804.4" dur="5.76">you and not just that but if you look at</text>
  <text start="807.279" dur="5.491">the main reviews on Amazon about this</text>
  <text start="810.16" dur="5.03">book the main reviews come from the New</text>

  <text start="961.87" dur="5.19">control technologies so I saw this news</text>
  <text start="965.35" dur="3.33">report yesterday I want to touch on it</text>
  <text start="967.06" dur="4.47">briefly and tell you a couple things</text>
  <text start="968.68" dur="5.76">about it so the LA Times reported on</text>
  <text start="971.53" dur="4.43">here that a man accused of killing six</text>
  <text start="974.44" dur="6.57">he basically killed his whole family</text>
  <text start="975.96" dur="8.65">back in 2014 he is claiming that he was</text>
  <text start="981.01" dur="6">controlled by voices a psychiatrist that</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="5.31">evaluated him testifies a psychiatrist</text>
  <text start="987.01" dur="5.16">that evaluated him huh interesting as Q</text>
  <text start="989.92" dur="4.23">has told us follow the psychiatrist but</text>
  <text start="992.17" dur="4.89">not just that when many of these</text>
  <text start="994.15" dur="4.23">instances of high crime and violence</text>
  <text start="997.06" dur="3">like this occur and many of these mass</text>
  <text start="998.38" dur="4.8">shootings for instance</text>
  <text start="1000.06" dur="5.73">you might hear that the shooter goes</text>
  <text start="1003.18" dur="5.04">through delusional hallucinations and</text>
  <text start="1005.79" dur="4.35">then starts hearing voices or starts</text>
  <text start="1008.22" dur="5.34">hearing demons or something like this</text>
  <text start="1010.14" dur="6.42">okay and this reminds me paints a</text>
  <text start="1013.56" dur="5.94">picture gives us evidence that voice to</text>
  <text start="1016.56" dur="5.1">skull or voice of God technologies</text>
  <text start="1019.5" dur="4.2">interchangeable words for the same basic</text>
  <text start="1021.66" dur="4.05">technology I&amp;#39;ve done videos on this</text>
  <text start="1023.7" dur="3.51">before if you research about it you can</text>
  <text start="1025.71" dur="3.27">find that these technologies have</text>
  <text start="1027.21" dur="2.46">existed in the defense industry for a</text>
  <text start="1028.98" dur="3.24">long long time</text>
  <text start="1029.67" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re basically mind control</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="5.07">technologies whereby subliminal</text>
  <text start="1034.32" dur="4.59">frequencies are shot at a person and</text>
  <text start="1037.29" dur="3.39">they can start literally hearing things</text>
  <text start="1038.91" dur="3.72">and become delusional and hallucinate</text>
  <text start="1040.68" dur="3.87">based upon what these subliminal</text>
  <text start="1042.63" dur="3.51">frequencies are doing to their</text>
  <text start="1044.55" dur="4.32">consciousness to their brainwaves right</text>
  <text start="1046.14" dur="5.4">so you can implant thoughts and words</text>
  <text start="1048.87" dur="4.32">and you know maybe even ideas or</text>
  <text start="1051.54" dur="4.41">emotions into people&amp;#39;s minds through</text>
  <text start="1053.19" dur="4.29">technology very much to exist and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1055.95" dur="3.87">existed for a long long time well this</text>
  <text start="1057.48" dur="6.03">guy said that he was hearing voices</text>
  <text start="1059.82" dur="5.31">telling him to kill his family and like</text>
  <text start="1063.51" dur="5.07">I said this isn&amp;#39;t the first time that</text>
  <text start="1065.13" dur="5.7">this has been reported by a killer the</text>

  <text start="1070.83" dur="2.7">Parkland Scheuer</text>
  <text start="1071.58" dur="3.45">said he was here in demon voices we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1073.53" dur="3.27">had a lot of other instances too so</text>
  <text start="1075.03" dur="4.41">something to research something to think</text>
  <text start="1076.8" dur="6.33">about you know targeted individuals mind</text>
  <text start="1079.44" dur="6.45">control technologies patsies committing</text>
  <text start="1083.13" dur="5.01">atrocities like mass shootings so all</text>
  <text start="1085.89" dur="5.25">very possible so all very possible and</text>
  <text start="1088.14" dur="6.27">then this instance happened in New York</text>
  <text start="1091.14" dur="6.24">just yesterday a car plowed into the</text>
  <text start="1094.41" dur="6.39">lobby of Trump Plaza in New York and</text>

  <text start="1100.8" dur="5.79">9:00 in the morning out-of-control black</text>
  <text start="1103.53" dur="5.85">Mercedes right into the building the guy</text>
  <text start="1106.59" dur="6.36">got out and he basically just sat on a</text>
  <text start="1109.38" dur="5.4">couch they say workers at Trump Plaza</text>
  <text start="1112.95" dur="3.87">say after the car plowed into the lobby</text>
  <text start="1114.78" dur="4.71">the driver got out and just took a seat</text>
  <text start="1116.82" dur="4.65">on the sofa and said nothing just really</text>
  <text start="1119.49" dur="4.35">weird we don&amp;#39;t know any other instances</text>
  <text start="1121.47" dur="4.71">about this but you know we just have a</text>
  <text start="1123.84" dur="4.26">lot of weird events like this occur</text>
  <text start="1126.18" dur="4.2">whether it&amp;#39;s cars trying to ram into</text>
  <text start="1128.1" dur="4.32">Trump&amp;#39;s motorcade whether it&amp;#39;s this car</text>

  <text start="1139.48" dur="3.51">just talking about about the subliminal</text>
  <text start="1141.129" dur="5.13">mind control technologies voice to skull</text>
  <text start="1142.99" dur="7.169">tack I wonder if any of these instances</text>
  <text start="1146.259" dur="5.79">trying to attack Trump or his properties</text>
  <text start="1150.159" dur="4.081">or his buildings like this I wonder if</text>
  <text start="1152.049" dur="4.411">these have to do with mind controlled</text>
  <text start="1154.24" dur="4.259">individuals I just wonder you know I</text>
  <text start="1156.46" dur="3.419">wonder be interesting to see what</text>
  <text start="1158.499" dur="3.54">evidence comes up with a little more</text>
  <text start="1159.879" dur="3.42">digging there and then last couple</text>
  <text start="1162.039" dur="5.01">things I want to talk about number one</text>
  <text start="1163.299" dur="5.911">being see BD and vaping so vaping being</text>
