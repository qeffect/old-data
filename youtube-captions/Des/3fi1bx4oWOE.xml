  <text start="0.03" dur="4.289">hello ladies and gents this is Jordan</text>
  <text start="2.28" dur="4.86">Sater here for the February 20th</text>
  <text start="4.319" dur="4.351">disclosure report fairly impromptu one</text>
  <text start="7.14" dur="3.27">but I had some things that I came across</text>
  <text start="8.67" dur="4.74">and needed to be shared so here we go</text>
  <text start="10.41" dur="6.42">this morning I found an article by NPR</text>
  <text start="13.41" dur="5.459">write a standard corporate media outlet</text>
  <text start="16.83" dur="3.3">that was discussing Antarctica and the</text>
  <text start="18.869" dur="4.051">headline of this article literally</text>
  <text start="20.13" dur="4.95">stated why NASA is exploring alien</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="6.09">worlds in Antarctica and they were</text>
  <text start="25.08" dur="6.029">following a NASA JPL doctoral student</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="6.36">and how he had been in Antarctica</text>
  <text start="31.109" dur="5.821">recently testing robotics down in in the</text>
  <text start="35.37" dur="4.349">ice and actually in the geysers</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="4.559">themselves and he was testing robots in</text>
  <text start="39.719" dur="4.291">Antarctica and what they claimed to</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="4.32">prepare for alien worlds so if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="44.01" dur="3.66">not some type of disclosure I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="45.809" dur="5.73">what is basically in this article that</text>
  <text start="47.67" dur="5.7">stated how we knew there were oceans on</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="3.54">moons in this solar system and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="3.599">probably life there so we&amp;#39;re testing</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="4.71">these robots here to go search for it</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="4.741">there so very interesting development</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="3.481">especially in regards to Antarctica</text>
  <text start="61.71" dur="3.269">because as I&amp;#39;ve stated on this channel</text>
  <text start="63.27" dur="3.12">before and as various secret space</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="4.051">program whistleblowers like Corey Goode</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="5.58">have said the powers that be are setting</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="6">up Antarctica to pull as a partial</text>
  <text start="71.97" dur="6.27">disclosure psychological operation if</text>
  <text start="75.03" dur="4.8">they need to so I think that&amp;#39;s one card</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="5.01">that the Cabal or the powers that be</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="5.789">have ready to play if need be if these</text>
  <text start="83.25" dur="4.38">mass arrests of the pedophile pedophiles</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="4.171">and the human traffickers and all that</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="3.72">jazz really started to ramp up I mean</text>
  <text start="89.79" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s already ramped up right we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="5.729">1,500 arrests in the first few weeks of</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="3.09">the Trump presidency so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="4.531">ramping up and I think this is a card</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="4.44">the Antarctica ancient civilizations</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="2.969">that they&amp;#39;ve uncovered uncovered under</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="5.25">the under the ice they&amp;#39;re using as a</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="5.93">card so the alliance right that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="5.369">of like their false flag that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="110.509" dur="5.25">threatening to play per se so I think in</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="4.14">their mainstream media outlets they keep</text>
  <text start="115.759" dur="6.281">flaunting that card and this is an</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="5.461">example now also four days ago on many</text>
  <text start="122.04" dur="3.869">mainstream media outlets like CNN</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="5.399">National Geographic on a bunch of them</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="5.851">we&amp;#39;re talking about Antarctic record ice</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="4.531">lows which I just found all of these</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="1.83">nude art articles this morning and I</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="1.32">want</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="3.39">to talk about that because that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="134.61" dur="5.099">interesting this is complete stark</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="4.5">contrast to NASA studies that CNN</text>
  <text start="139.709" dur="4.381">directly reported on that came out just</text>
  <text start="141.48" dur="5.64">a year ago discussing Antarctic record</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="4.77">ice highs so I don&amp;#39;t know how it flipped</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="5.67">in a year to being low whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="6.39">actually low or whether this is just</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="5.07">some made-up information and if it is</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="4.98">actually low whether that Antarctic ice</text>
  <text start="157.86" dur="5.489">low might have been artificially created</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="5.19">who knows but the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="163.349" dur="3.42">literally reporting on ice lows in tech</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="3.42">dark in Antarctica</text>
  <text start="166.769" dur="3.961">couple that with this massive ice shelf</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s supposedly breaking off again</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="3.96">whether it&amp;#39;s artificially helps to break</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="3.12">off or not</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="3">what I think we&amp;#39;re seeing and what I</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="3">think these powers that be are really</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="3.84">prepping our minds for they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="4.979">hey we&amp;#39;re testing for alien life in</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="5.4">Antarctica aka there&amp;#39;s actually is alien</text>
  <text start="184.319" dur="4.441">life in Antarctica we&amp;#39;re seeing a bunch</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="4.619">of ice melt away in this ice shelf break</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="5.1">off so remember those camera crews that</text>
  <text start="191.549" dur="5.881">CNN and CBS News were just in Antarctica</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="5.459">a week ago so what if we just happened</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="4.32">to stumble upon some ancient</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="4.381">civilization that was uncovered when</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="4.739">this ice melted or this ice sheet broke</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="4.17">off huh huh huh you see you see that</text>
  <text start="206.489" dur="3.241">partial narrative that they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="4.649">up for they&amp;#39;re setting up for like they</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="4.229">stumbled upon it randomly when remember</text>
  <text start="212.519" dur="2.671">David Wilcock Corey Goode and all them</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="2.731">have been saying that they knew about</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="3.9">this and they&amp;#39;ve been uncovering it for</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="4.59">a decade and a half very important to</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="3.72">understand very important to understand</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="5.01">the reality of what&amp;#39;s really going on in</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="4.739">Antarctica and also realize the Nazis</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="2.789">have been there since World War two</text>
  <text start="227.549" dur="3.241">right there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff in</text>
  <text start="229.079" dur="4.94">Antarctica we haven&amp;#39;t been told and a</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="5.94">long history of it that we need to</text>
  <text start="234.019" dur="5.951">familiar sigh familiarize ourselves with</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="5.189">to make sure that we&amp;#39;re not caught up in</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="4.44">that partial disclosure nonsense</text>
  <text start="241.919" dur="5.641">if they try and pull it so that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="5.31">reason I am stressing this narrative</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="5.009">because it has to do with everything</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="4.73">right we can&amp;#39;t separate the Antarctica</text>
  <text start="252.569" dur="4.441">situation extraterrestrial disclosure</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="3.819">the UFO issue from the pizza gate and</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="4.74">the pedophile arrest they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re one</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="5.221">in the same it&amp;#39;s all the same issue when</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="3.39">you start connecting the dots right we</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="2.82">have such a compartmentalize mindset in</text>
  <text start="265.14" dur="1.71">this society because that&amp;#39;s how the</text>
  <text start="266.31" dur="3">powers that</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="4.29">we have groomed us with our academia</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="4.35">systems to think but we must think</text>
  <text start="271.14" dur="4.11">holistically with this right pizza gate</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="3.78">has to do with everything else has to do</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="4.59">with ET issue the history we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="277.44" dur="5.37">denied the suppression of all the</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="4.17">sciences the deep Luciferian cult ruling</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="4.71">over this planet right it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="6.63">connected so anyway that&amp;#39;s what I wanted</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="6.06">to throw out there about Antarctica and</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="5.54">also lastly forgot to mention this</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="4.5">NASA is holding a press conference in</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="3.88">two days right</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s January 20th right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="6.09">holding it on the 22nd discussing what</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="4.29">they so call exoplanets that you know we</text>
  <text start="306.15" dur="2.81">don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re going to talk</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="5.4">about but it&amp;#39;s going to be something</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="7.3">regarding life outside of our solar</text>
  <text start="312.54" dur="5.82">system is claims to be so this can be</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="4.29">very interesting few days and also a few</text>
