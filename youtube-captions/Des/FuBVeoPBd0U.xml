  <text start="0" dur="4.29">a lot of times the inspiration for these</text>
  <text start="2.01" dur="4.41">videos comes from my pet peeves so i&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="4.29" dur="4.62">Irby online or i&amp;#39;ll hear something in</text>
  <text start="6.42" dur="4.139">public and I&amp;#39;ll just be really irked</text>
  <text start="8.91" dur="3.12">because people have it completely</text>
  <text start="10.559" dur="3.33">ass-backwards of what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="12.03" dur="5.22">so I&amp;#39;ll come here and make a video and</text>
  <text start="13.889" dur="5.881">try to explain and in this video the</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="5.939">concept that&amp;#39;s bugging me today is GMOs</text>
  <text start="19.77" dur="5.46">and everybody watching my videos I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="23.189" dur="5.221">going to assume is pretty well-versed on</text>
  <text start="25.23" dur="5.82">this GMO issue if you&amp;#39;re not do it and</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="7.5">if you still eat genetically engineered</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="6.39">ingredients stop right now anyway I mean</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="2.669">there&amp;#39;s been a huge public awakening</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="4.02">especially with the march against</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="5.611">Monsanto movement where many many people</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="4.64">are waking up to the reality of the</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="5.07">truth behind you most past few years and</text>
  <text start="46.1" dur="5.139">Jeffrey Smith if you don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="49.26" dur="3.42">the GMO issue look up Jeff Jeffrey Smith</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="4.771">at the Institute of Responsible</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="6.899">technology this guy is a GMO genius and</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="6.9">he basically deconstructs every biotech</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="5.431">propaganda talking point there is right</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="3.72">he scientifically shows you that</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="3.179">genetically engineered foods are not</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="4.41">healthy they will destroy your digest</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="4.531">system in your brain they are not</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="4.56">helpful to the environment they actually</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="6.18">increase pesticide usage tremendously</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="5.699">and they do not increase yield which is</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="4.05">you know biotechs and Monsanto&amp;#39;s main</text>
  <text start="81.299" dur="4.101">selling point for GMO foods is that hoe</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="4.68">they crease yield they don&amp;#39;t do that so</text>
  <text start="85.4" dur="4.87">anyway there&amp;#39;s all of that information</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="4.26">aside one of the talking points that</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="3.86">really grinds my gears that I want to</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="7.68">focus on here is when people say oh</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="7">everything&amp;#39;s a GMO as if what they try</text>
  <text start="99.57" dur="3.78">to say what they try to back up their</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="5.669">argument with is that oh you know we</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="5.82">have been modifying plants through</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="4.381">natural agriculture for millennia to</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="6.3">build stronger traits in the plants that</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="7.68">we want so you know saying these things</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="4.62">coming from Monsanto are any different</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="2.579">than what we&amp;#39;ve been doing for thousands</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="2.54">of years is completely false and yadda</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="4.771">yadda and that&amp;#39;s their you know</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="6.4">propaganda totally false this</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="4.62">is what&amp;#39;s called hybridization what</text>
  <text start="129.03" dur="3.06">people that say this like oh we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="2.52">genetically engineering things four</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="3.54">thousand years this is</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="4.29">and hybridization what essentially this</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="3.21">is is you take two plants that are</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="3.27">really strong plants and you try to</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="6.66">naturally have them reproduce and</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="6.09">combine them together that is as if I</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="3.09">wanted to have a child that had blue</text>
  <text start="147" dur="3.36">eyes I&amp;#39;m gonna go try to find a chick</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="3.9">that has blue eyes and then through</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="2.99">natural processes we try to make a child</text>
  <text start="152.49" dur="3.99">with blue eyes</text>
  <text start="153.35" dur="5.25">this is far different than the</text>
  <text start="156.48" dur="5.73">artificial genetic engineering that</text>
  <text start="158.6" dur="5.32">Monsanto and those other corporations do</text>
  <text start="162.21" dur="3.41">and this is what&amp;#39;s so important to</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="4.32">understand they&amp;#39;re not the same thing</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="5.02">what these companies will try to do is</text>
  <text start="168.24" dur="4.05">literally take their genetic code and</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;ll use sometimes I know one</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="3.3">technique is called a gene gun they</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="3.18">literally put this genetic code that</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="3.93">they want in the plant and a gene gun</text>
  <text start="177.24" dur="5.07">they put the plant on like a gold plate</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="7.13">and they&amp;#39;ll literally shoot that gene at</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="6.63">the genetics of the plant to try and</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="4.15">splice it the correct way right they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="4.83">do this thousands of times and then</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ll plant thousands of trials to try</text>
  <text start="193.77" dur="5.37">to hopefully grow one with the trait</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="6.9">they like that&amp;#39;s what they do to test</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="5.58">and patent genetically engineered seed</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="4.86">to patent quite literally life to patent</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="3.72">their products it&amp;#39;s a complete random</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="3.18">like hope this works</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="4.32">hope this works hope this works and then</text>
  <text start="210.66" dur="3.93">they plant them all and they try to find</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="4.2">one that grows with the traits they want</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="5.88">so it&amp;#39;s a complete gues game and it</text>
  <text start="216.96" dur="6.39">ruins us and the environment you mess</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="5.22">with the genetics of nature of what God</text>
  <text start="223.35" dur="3.6">did it&amp;#39;s going to have some issues with</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="3.27">us I don&amp;#39;t know how people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="4.32">understand that like oh you know messing</text>
  <text start="228.96" dur="5.91">with the genes of my sustenance is fine</text>
  <text start="231.27" dur="5.43">I don&amp;#39;t know anyway there are two very</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="5.19">different things so keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="236.7" dur="6.38">artificial geo mowing the mowing is very</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="5.1">bad in all forms and hybridization it</text>
  <text start="243.08" dur="4.15">one thing I do want to stress though</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="4.83">about hybridization is that it depends</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="4.92">it must be a very slow natural process</text>
  <text start="249.99" dur="4.74">when you breed plants for stronger</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="4.68">traits that you want naturally one</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="5.16">instance that it is becoming detrimental</text>
  <text start="256.83" dur="4.83">to humans is wheat right we&amp;#39;ve done so</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="3.9">much natural it&amp;#39;s the natural</text>
  <text start="261.66" dur="3.509">modification but we&amp;#39;ve done so much</text>
  <text start="263.79" dur="3.45">hybridization of this plant that the</text>
  <text start="265.169" dur="5.25">gluten protein is becoming so complex</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="6.84">and our bodies can&amp;#39;t break it down so it</text>
  <text start="270.419" dur="6.09">must be done slowly with our biology</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="5.25">given time to process the changes in the</text>
  <text start="276.509" dur="5.731">plants if we are going to hybridize so</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="5.489">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a very important piece of</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="5.78">this puzzle but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the video</text>
  <text start="284.819" dur="8.28">I wanted to do know not everything is</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="7.03">genetically modified and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="293.099" dur="3.301">understand the GMO issue and what</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="4.38">ingredients are specifically in our</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="5.22">foods to avoid please do so because</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="4.919">these GMO foods are screwing up our</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="4.74">genetics they are leading to all types</text>
  <text start="304.349" dur="3.211">of diseases especially cancers digestive</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="5.19">disorders and nervous system</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="5.25">dysfunctions and I mean on the deepest</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="3.03">level they&amp;#39;re not letting us literally</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="3.329">spiritually grow because if we mess the</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="5.01">DNA of our plant and it screws up our</text>
  <text start="316.139" dur="9.331">DNA our DNA this can cannot thus cannot</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="7.65">cohere itself to basically activate the</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="6.33">codons that aren&amp;#39;t activated or activate</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="7.59">our junk DNA or to cohere energies or</text>
  <text start="331.8" dur="4.89">bio photons properly so yeah basically</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="5.209">don&amp;#39;t eat GMO stuff you&amp;#39;re gonna save</text>
  <text start="336.69" dur="3.349">yourself and the planet done</text>
