  <text start="35.43" dur="4.74">comes from I put a call out for</text>
  <text start="37.67" dur="4">suggestions yesterday on patreon and</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s what somebody asked me they</text>

  <text start="44.25" dur="5.67">because I use kratom on occasion and I</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="4.319">know about it and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="4.38">people out there I find that are</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="4.8">ignorant as to what kratom is and how it</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="3.45">can help them I wanted to do this video</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="3.66">but I also wanted to just shout out</text>

  <text start="59.789" dur="4.891">know about patreon or that I&amp;#39;m on it I</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="6.96">actually do a lot of exclusive content</text>

  <text start="76.35" dur="4.05">and you get a lot of exclusive content</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="6.419">but anyway let&amp;#39;s move on into talking</text>
  <text start="80.4" dur="6.509">about kratom what is it well it is an</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="5.911">herb actually it&amp;#39;s an herb that grows</text>
  <text start="86.909" dur="5.85">over in Asia in Thailand and Myanmar and</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="5.629">kind of that little peninsula there and</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s been used for centuries for</text>
  <text start="96.409" dur="5.201">multiple differently things but mainly</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="9.11">what it&amp;#39;s been used for is pain relief</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="10.56">and as a relaxing agent and this is why</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="5.771">so many governments not only are the</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="3.3">government&amp;#39;s around Thailand and whatnot</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.85">kind of cracking down on it but</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="6.12">especially in America here the FDA</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="5.14">wonderful organization right fraud and</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="4.11">death administration the FDA and the DEA</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="5.219">is well they&amp;#39;re both trying to crack</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="3.899">down on kratom and I&amp;#39;ll tell you why in</text>
  <text start="129.209" dur="2.821">a minute</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="4.321">but I want to discuss a little bit more</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="4.98">so about what kratom is</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="5.61">and the effects so kratom as a</text>
  <text start="137.01" dur="5.22">supplement you can see here I take the</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="5.91">capsules of it you can also buy it as a</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="7.65">powder use it as that as well but kratom</text>
  <text start="145.44" dur="6.18">as an herb it works great as a relaxer</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="4.5">kind of like I&amp;#39;ve mentioned it&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="6.08">opiate mind you there&amp;#39;s no opiates in it</text>
  <text start="154.38" dur="5.79">but there&amp;#39;s alkaloids and various</text>
  <text start="157.7" dur="5.14">compounds in there that are much much</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="5.85">safer than opiates it can still be a</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="6.54">little addictive have some addictive</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="5.37">qualities but everything has addictive</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="6.09">qualities that&amp;#39;s more so about your</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="7.47">self-control not necessarily the UH the</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="5.04">compound but anyway the reason a lot of</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="6.69">people use kratom is to actually</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="7.949">withdraw from heavier hardcore drugs so</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="5.73">a lot of people that take opiates or</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="4.981">trying to come down off various hardcore</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="4.83">drugs they use kratom to take the edge</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="4.26">off and that&amp;#39;s exactly what it does it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="3.48">a very kind of safe alternative that</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="4.89">helps people come down off that stuff</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="5.01">and it was worked fantastically and</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s actually in my opinion why this</text>
  <text start="204.6" dur="5.19">stuff is so vilified why the government</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="3.75">institutions that we have are trying to</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="8.06">crack down on it because of course if</text>
  <text start="212.1" dur="9.229">people get off of opioids what happens</text>
  <text start="217.85" dur="6.55">pharmaceutical profits start dropping</text>
  <text start="221.329" dur="5.141">but not only do public pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="5.25">profits start dropping but also the</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="6.18">black market money that the</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="6.36">powers-that-be make from trafficking</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="7.2">drugs and it&amp;#39;ll start to drop - right</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="7.65">why do you think we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="6.419">Afghanistan for so long why our military</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="5.549">soldiers over there guarding opium</text>
  <text start="246.269" dur="5.161">fields that&amp;#39;s another subject that we</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="5.31">can talk about another time but point</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="5.399">being here is that kratom has a very</text>
  <text start="254.519" dur="5.491">safe agent for people to take the edge</text>
  <text start="256.829" dur="7.321">off and not turn towards these hardcore</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="5.79">drugs a lot of powers out there don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="3.42">necessarily like that so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="3.81">reason that the FDA is</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="4.74">coming down on it I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="6.63">it&amp;#39;s completely free from side-effects</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="6.24">but to the extent that the DEA and FDA</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="4.82">are cracking down on it it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="5.34">blown out of proportion and ridiculous</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="4.6">nonsensical for them to do that but</text>
  <text start="283.89" dur="5.25">luckily in some areas around the country</text>
  <text start="285.66" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s still legal you can still buy it in</text>
  <text start="289.14" dur="7.56">my area it&amp;#39;s pretty much all over a lot</text>
  <text start="292.47" dur="6.63">of smoke shops will sell it in my state</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="5.1">wreck recreational cannabis is legal so</text>
  <text start="299.1" dur="4.5">some pot shops will sell it those things</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="6.03">are popping up like Starbucks everywhere</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s crazy but yeah kratom is also some</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="4.5">gas stations as well it&amp;#39;s pretty red</text>
  <text start="309.42" dur="8.49">readily available so me myself</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="7.65">personally I&amp;#39;ve taken it not really for</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="3.96">years I took it a few years ago maybe</text>
  <text start="319.98" dur="4.05">three or four years ago I found these</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="3.84">little like shots little one-ounce shots</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="5.76">as I&amp;#39;m kratom in there those things were</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="5.61">amazing but then I stopped working at</text>
  <text start="329.79" dur="4.23">that place so I didn&amp;#39;t have access to</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="4.08">those little shots and I didn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="4.29">crowd them for a few years but I</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="5.64">recently began adding it back in just</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="4.5">because of the relaxation effects I mean</text>
  <text start="341.04" dur="4.5">believe it or not I still get nervous</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="5.19">doing a lot of these videos when I do</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="3.84">public speeches and whatnot so sometimes</text>
  <text start="348" dur="5.91">I take crowding just to take the edge</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="6.18">off of that or also because of my own</text>
  <text start="353.91" dur="3.81">addictive qualities now I&amp;#39;ve never been</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="5.31">addicted to the hardcore stuff but I</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="5.82">mean caffeine even it&amp;#39;s not good for us</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="6.03">so I&amp;#39;m trying to come down off that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="363.54" dur="5.28">trying to not use cannabis quite as much</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="5.43">either so sometimes I dabble into crowdy</text>
  <text start="368.82" dur="4.86">maybe once a week twice a week if that</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="5.61">you know I don&amp;#39;t take it all the time</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="6.51">but sometimes I dabble and that leads me</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="4.56">into talking about the effects on of it</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="5.7">so how do you actually feel taking</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="7.71">kratom well when I try to discuss with</text>
  <text start="385.89" dur="5.91">people who you know maybe I offered them</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="4.29">a couple kratom capsules to take for</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="4.77">their pain or whatnot you know I</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="3.63">actually had offered a person just last</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="4.29">weekend a couple capsules of kratom for</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="3.06">their pain to help them sleep and they</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="2.76">actually</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="3.93">gave me a really good report on that so</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s a little bit of testimony but</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="6.06">anyway what I usually tell people when I</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="5.49">try to give them something to compare</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="4.8">kratom to is that I tell them it&amp;#39;s often</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="4.23">like taking an edible product of</text>
  <text start="415.98" dur="5.52">cannabis like oh whether it&amp;#39;s a tincture</text>
  <text start="417.48" dur="5.31">or cookie or bar or what-have-you or</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="3.69">what not it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of like that</text>
  <text start="422.79" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s kind of like taking edible cannabis</text>
  <text start="425.19" dur="6.2">but you don&amp;#39;t is a little different</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="6.17">because you don&amp;#39;t quite get the mental</text>
  <text start="431.39" dur="5.02">alterations the psychological up</text>
  <text start="433.76" dur="7.14">alterations as you do on cannabis crowd</text>
  <text start="436.41" dur="8.43">of is much more in the body I find and</text>
  <text start="440.9" dur="6.61">your thought process just maintains much</text>
  <text start="444.84" dur="4.04">more clarity than it would if you take</text>
  <text start="447.51" dur="6.69">cannabis but that&amp;#39;s just my experience</text>
  <text start="448.88" dur="8.98">again and that is also why I like taking</text>
  <text start="454.2" dur="5.43">it to take the edge off when I do this</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="4.11">work as visa because I can still</text>
  <text start="459.63" dur="6.21">formulate thoughts much more clearly</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="5.67">than I can win taking cannabis so I</text>
  <text start="465.84" dur="3.57">think all in all that&amp;#39;s really one of</text>
  <text start="467.64" dur="5.73">what I wanted to cover in regards to</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="7.41">kratom here it&amp;#39;s very safe of course you</text>
  <text start="473.37" dur="6.21">still want to have some discipline when</text>
  <text start="476.82" dur="5.76">taking it don&amp;#39;t take too much I think</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="5.43">the serving size on this says like five</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="4.92">capsules at a time I just take two I</text>
  <text start="485.01" dur="5.64">take two and I feel completely fine so I</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="7.32">don&amp;#39;t take nearly as much as a serving</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="8.61">size says I still get great feelings</text>
  <text start="494.82" dur="5.82">from it great relaxing agent and there</text>
  <text start="499.26" dur="4.98">you go you know you can try it for</text>
  <text start="500.64" dur="5.279">yourself for pain or maybe to help with</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="3.9">any other addictions you got going on in</text>
