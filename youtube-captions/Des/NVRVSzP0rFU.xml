  <text start="9.269" dur="3.99">Earth it&amp;#39;s Sunday September 16th in this</text>
  <text start="11.639" dur="3.63">video here is just gonna be the general</text>
  <text start="13.259" dur="4.11">update for the day we&amp;#39;ve had some Q</text>
  <text start="15.269" dur="4.26">posts with some very important points in</text>
  <text start="17.369" dur="3.931">there to discuss and then I&amp;#39;ve got a few</text>
  <text start="19.529" dur="2.881">articles to talk about towards the end</text>
  <text start="21.3" dur="3.87">of this video we&amp;#39;re gonna touch on</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="6.3">SpaceX the Vatican and a couple other</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="6.38">things so getting into it first point I</text>
  <text start="28.71" dur="6.119">want to make is I have seen a load of</text>
  <text start="31.55" dur="5.5">naivety and gullibility all around the</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="4.561">past couple of days you know people are</text>
  <text start="37.05" dur="4.77">taking speculations and completely</text>
  <text start="39.39" dur="3.84">latching onto them acting as if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="41.82" dur="3.09">fact without doing the proper</text>
  <text start="43.23" dur="5.25">fact-checking without doing the proper</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="6.09">sourcing etc etc and one example of this</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;ve seen is this photograph of Melania</text>
  <text start="51" dur="5.399">Trump go around the past day with what</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="4.95">looks like to be a pink Q on her dress</text>
  <text start="56.399" dur="4.8">but when you actually do some digging</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="4.079">and research this you&amp;#39;ll find that this</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="3.6">is a photoshopped image it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="4.201">actually a Q that was on her dress</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="5.61">this photograph originally was taken in</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="5.13">Poland in July of last year and you can</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="4.471">see it&amp;#39;s actually more of an oh it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="3.96">pink o on her dress well within the last</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="3.51">couple days somebody photoshopped a</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="4.26">little Q tail on it and it spread like</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="5.79">wildfire across the internet and people</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="5.61">are thinking that this is legit and this</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="3.75">might not seem like something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="5.039">very important but it actually is</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="5.07">because in instances like this planted</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="4.461">disinformation it&amp;#39;s a very easy way to</text>
  <text start="93" dur="5.46">discredit the movement any sort of</text>
  <text start="95.72" dur="5.68">mainstream or alternative propaganda</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="4.949">outlet could take this and claim all of</text>
  <text start="101.4" dur="3.929">these Q folks these researchers are</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="3.901">latching on to all this etc etc</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="6.211">it&amp;#39;s just a very easy way to discredit</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="7.86">and it&amp;#39;s a very easy way to show a lack</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="6.21">of discernment that&amp;#39;s the lesson here is</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="4.62">to truly discern and get good doing so</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="4.009">and actually make the effort to do so</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t just hear some speculation that</text>
  <text start="121.759" dur="5.171">superficially sounds good and latch on</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="5.97">to that right so that&amp;#39;s my first point</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="4.29">now let&amp;#39;s get into just discussing Q so</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="3">handful of posts over the last couple</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="2.71">days we&amp;#39;re gonna start right here with</text>

  <text start="171.939" dur="5.97">to the test of the emergency alert</text>
  <text start="175" dur="5.939">system is this latest post right here 21</text>

  <text start="203.049" dur="5.97">quarterback and this briefcase that they</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="6.69">call the football is a it&amp;#39;s a way that</text>

  <text start="218.949" dur="6.72">orders when he&amp;#39;s away from his desk so</text>
  <text start="221.829" dur="6.03">in thinking of this post now with this</text>
  <text start="225.669" dur="5.011">test to confirm the emergency broadcast</text>
  <text start="227.859" dur="4.62">system it&amp;#39;s basically a way for the</text>

  <text start="232.479" dur="2.611">confirm the free flow of direct</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="5.369">communications make sure there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="5.639">the bad actors can dampen or disrupt any</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="3.541">of these messages getting out to the</text>
  <text start="240.729" dur="4.26">public as it says right here the NSA is</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="5.789">monitoring for any attempts to disrupt</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="5.011">or terminate access so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="248.349" dur="4.56">important for the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="250" dur="4.5">and the white hats to completely go</text>
  <text start="252.909" dur="6.42">around the mainstream media to</text>

  <text start="259.329" dur="3.871">of the internet were to go down or be</text>
  <text start="260.949" dur="4.621">blocked they need a way to communicate</text>
  <text start="263.2" dur="3.3">with the American public this is a test</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="4.02">of that</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="5.51">so be warned very big things coming</text>
  <text start="269.59" dur="5.16">tests of the emergency broadcast system</text>
  <text start="272.01" dur="5.83">and those tests are gonna soon I&amp;#39;m sure</text>

  <text start="661.2" dur="5.19">what they&amp;#39;re doing totally paid off</text>
  <text start="663.56" dur="3.73">Flynn who knows if he&amp;#39;s just a spectator</text>
  <text start="666.39" dur="3.059">who knows</text>
  <text start="667.29" dur="4.7">he&amp;#39;s involved in some way shape or form</text>

  <text start="680.22" dur="6.09">is legit and this is a very legitimate</text>
  <text start="683.55" dur="3.089">operation being put into play that right</text>
  <text start="686.31" dur="2.19">there</text>
  <text start="686.639" dur="6.091">okay last few articles I want to share</text>
  <text start="688.5" dur="6.99">with you guys SpaceX is announcing this</text>
  <text start="692.73" dur="4.02">week a private tourist who will fly to</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="3.3">the moon they&amp;#39;re gonna fly to the moon</text>
  <text start="696.75" dur="4.22">on a brand new rocket that SpaceX is</text>
  <text start="698.79" dur="5.489">developing they&amp;#39;re calling it the bfr</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="5.02">big freakin rocket and apparently it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="704.279" dur="4.321">gonna shoot somebody around the moon in</text>
  <text start="705.99" dur="5">a couple of years whenever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.6" dur="4.789">developed and ready not sure when but</text>
  <text start="710.99" dur="4.63">points I want to make with this one I</text>
  <text start="713.389" dur="4.361">don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;ve never been a</text>
  <text start="715.62" dur="4.32">spate of fan of SpaceX quite honestly</text>
  <text start="717.75" dur="4.769">never been a huge fan of Elaan musk</text>
  <text start="719.94" dur="3.269">simply because a lot of the science that</text>
  <text start="722.519" dur="4.74">they deal with</text>
  <text start="723.209" dur="5.671">it&amp;#39;s either a archaic science we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="727.259" dur="4.621">need rocket fuel anymore we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="728.88" dur="5.72">rockets period there&amp;#39;s science and</text>
  <text start="731.88" dur="4.55">technology out there electrogravitics</text>
  <text start="734.6" dur="4.859">anti-gravity if you want to call it that</text>
  <text start="736.43" dur="5.889">zero point free energy systems that</text>
  <text start="739.459" dur="5.11">could completely do away with any sort</text>
  <text start="742.319" dur="5.431">of fossil fuel so the technologies that</text>
  <text start="744.569" dur="5.791">L on musk is acting like is the latest</text>
  <text start="747.75" dur="5.519">and greatest is really not not only that</text>
  <text start="750.36" dur="7.08">but a lot of the quote theoretical</text>
  <text start="753.269" dur="5.94">physics science L on musk maybe he knows</text>
  <text start="757.44" dur="4.8">and just doesn&amp;#39;t speak it or maybe he</text>
  <text start="759.209" dur="6.12">actually doesn&amp;#39;t know it but point being</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="6.779">here SpaceX to me is just as much of a</text>
  <text start="765.329" dur="4.651">smokescreen as NASA is right we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="769.019" dur="2.94">need rockets we don&amp;#39;t need this</text>
  <text start="769.98" dur="4.44">technology we could have done away with</text>
  <text start="771.959" dur="4.771">all this decades ago let&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="774.42" dur="5.479">inform ourselves and understand that</text>
  <text start="776.73" dur="5.909">free energy anti-gravity is absolutely</text>
  <text start="779.899" dur="4.63">real it&amp;#39;s been done it&amp;#39;s been done for</text>
  <text start="782.639" dur="5.911">decades and in fact it&amp;#39;s been built out</text>
  <text start="784.529" dur="8.31">quite a bit in secret space programs in</text>
  <text start="788.55" dur="6.24">black corporate military projects so</text>
  <text start="792.839" dur="4.411">that&amp;#39;s the point I want to make with</text>
  <text start="794.79" dur="5.64">that their next article says here as</text>
  <text start="797.25" dur="3.78">Pope faces crisis in Rome Cardinal warns</text>
  <text start="800.43" dur="3.81">of splett</text>
  <text start="801.03" dur="5.1">in China so every single day now it</text>
  <text start="804.24" dur="5.55">seems like there&amp;#39;s some new news coming</text>
  <text start="806.13" dur="5.67">out that is completely discrediting</text>
  <text start="809.79" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s annihilating the Vatican&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="811.8" dur="3.6">reputation and it seems like every day</text>
  <text start="813.81" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s something happening in a new</text>
  <text start="815.4" dur="5.73">country we had an archbishop in Germany</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="4.59">step forward in recent days and a big</text>
  <text start="821.13" dur="3.48">report released there it was published</text>
  <text start="823.32" dur="3.12">that was completely lightening up the</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="3.42">Vatican we have stuff going on in this</text>
  <text start="826.44" dur="4.98">country of course many allegations</text>
  <text start="828.03" dur="5.34">surfacing now China right the Vatican</text>
  <text start="831.42" dur="4.74">worldwide is he&amp;#39;s absolutely crumbling</text>
  <text start="833.37" dur="4.59">and it&amp;#39;s good news</text>
  <text start="836.16" dur="3.6">harsh news it&amp;#39;s gonna hit a lot of</text>
  <text start="837.96" dur="6.48">people very deep a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="839.76" dur="7.38">very deep emotional ties to religious</text>
  <text start="844.44" dur="6.75">institutions and to religious dogma but</text>
  <text start="847.14" dur="6.45">we really have to break that emotional</text>
  <text start="851.19" dur="5.4">attachment to the belief systems it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="853.59" dur="5.4">not only is the Vatican God awful but a</text>
  <text start="856.59" dur="4.92">lot of this religious dogma that has</text>
  <text start="858.99" dur="5.1">been ingrained into so many people for</text>
  <text start="861.51" dur="3.99">centuries now is so self-limiting and</text>
  <text start="864.09" dur="3.27">people don&amp;#39;t even realize that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.5" dur="3.3">completely giving away their own</text>
  <text start="867.36" dur="4.29">sovereignty and their own personal power</text>
  <text start="868.8" dur="7.29">just for these feel-good stories and</text>
  <text start="871.65" dur="7.56">these feel-good superficial ideas that</text>
  <text start="876.09" dur="5.16">is religious dogma so there&amp;#39;s this whole</text>
  <text start="879.21" dur="5.37">relearning that we&amp;#39;re gonna have to do</text>
  <text start="881.25" dur="5.85">about ancient history and about</text>
  <text start="884.58" dur="6.17">spirituality and the fact that</text>
  <text start="887.1" dur="5.79">spirituality does not come from these</text>
  <text start="890.75" dur="3.58">establishment organized religious</text>
  <text start="892.89" dur="3.09">Institute&amp;#39;s institutions that were</text>
  <text start="894.33" dur="5.79">created to control our minds into</text>
  <text start="895.98" dur="8.55">control humanity that&amp;#39;s that next</text>
  <text start="900.12" dur="6.9">article time said today cancer will kill</text>
  <text start="904.53" dur="4.68">about 10 million people this year now</text>
  <text start="907.02" dur="4.26">this might be made up just to scare us</text>
  <text start="909.21" dur="3.78">might be some fear porn I wouldn&amp;#39;t doubt</text>
  <text start="911.28" dur="3.93">if this was real though because it seems</text>
  <text start="912.99" dur="4.17">as if I think studies have shown one in</text>
  <text start="915.21" dur="4.05">two one in three people now will get</text>
  <text start="917.16" dur="4.32">cancer at some point in their lives and</text>
  <text start="919.26" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s just exponentially increasing</text>
  <text start="921.48" dur="6.06">because we live such unhealthy</text>
  <text start="924.27" dur="5.31">lifestyles we are horribly ignorant when</text>
  <text start="927.54" dur="5.04">it comes to how our own bodies function</text>
  <text start="929.58" dur="3.66">how to move and feed and take care of</text>
  <text start="932.58" dur="2.25">ourselves</text>
  <text start="933.24" dur="2.969">unfortunately we&amp;#39;re not taught</text>
  <text start="934.83" dur="3.3">and schooling and we&amp;#39;re not taught that</text>
  <text start="936.209" dur="3.69">by our doctors and all the stuff that we</text>
  <text start="938.13" dur="5.25">get from the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="939.899" dur="5.491"> right and not only that but</text>
  <text start="943.38" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re not told about how toxic our</text>
  <text start="945.39" dur="3.66">environments are all the poisons that</text>
  <text start="946.98" dur="4.38">are sprayed over our heads sprayed in</text>
  <text start="949.05" dur="7.08">the atmosphere injected right into us</text>
  <text start="951.36" dur="7.26">that we unknowingly drink every single</text>
  <text start="956.13" dur="4.05">day that we eat that it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.62" dur="4.2">horrible you know it&amp;#39;s really horrible</text>
  <text start="960.18" dur="4.77">so point here I want to make is educate</text>
  <text start="962.82" dur="4.38">yourself educate yourself on what is</text>
  <text start="964.95" dur="4.41">healthy what is not healthy not only</text>
  <text start="967.2" dur="3.12">that but take that knowledge and put it</text>
  <text start="969.36" dur="3.21">into practice</text>
  <text start="970.32" dur="4.769">okay they often say knowledge is not</text>
  <text start="972.57" dur="4.11">power but that&amp;#39;s not enough knowledge is</text>
  <text start="975.089" dur="3.151">just potential what are you actually</text>
  <text start="976.68" dur="3.839">going to do with that knowledge are you</text>
  <text start="978.24" dur="4.5">going to apply that knowledge it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="980.519" dur="4.26">actually the application of it that is</text>
  <text start="982.74" dur="4.68">the power because you&amp;#39;re setting that</text>
  <text start="984.779" dur="9.151">knowledge into motion with the action</text>
  <text start="987.42" dur="8.81">okay so cancer can be eradicated with</text>
  <text start="993.93" dur="5.64">simply an increase in consciousness</text>
  <text start="996.23" dur="4.919">understand that guys and really take the</text>
  <text start="999.57" dur="4.35">effort to learn about yourself</text>
  <text start="1001.149" dur="4.75">self-knowledge how you function and we</text>
  <text start="1003.92" dur="4.169">can totally get rid of all this needless</text>
  <text start="1005.899" dur="6.18">suffering from these unnecessary</text>
  <text start="1008.089" dur="5.94">diseases boom done with that point very</text>
  <text start="1012.079" dur="4.891">last thing I want to talk about here so</text>
  <text start="1014.029" dur="4.56">the solar observatory made video of this</text>
  <text start="1016.97" dur="4.29">recently talked about it in my live</text>
  <text start="1018.589" dur="5.791">streams but it&amp;#39;s just crazy to me how</text>
  <text start="1021.26" dur="5.13">this story won&amp;#39;t die every single day</text>
  <text start="1024.38" dur="3.809">there&amp;#39;s a new round of mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1026.39" dur="4.5">articles about it and every single day</text>
  <text start="1028.189" dur="4.711">there&amp;#39;s new narratives that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1030.89" dur="5.279">trying to put out there whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1032.9" dur="4.98">trying to ridicule quote alien</text>
  <text start="1036.169" dur="4.101">conspiracy theorists or whatever the</text>
  <text start="1037.88" dur="5.16">hell they say or if they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1040.27" dur="5.02">put some fear porn out there about some</text>
  <text start="1043.04" dur="4.26">geomagnetic storms or solar flares or</text>
  <text start="1045.29" dur="3.87">whether they&amp;#39;re just trying to say oh</text>
  <text start="1047.3" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s crazy nobody knows what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1049.16" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s this huge cover-up that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1050.72" dur="5.16">really a cover-up because everybody now</text>
  <text start="1052.22" dur="7.41">knows about it so I mean regardless it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1055.88" dur="5.91">very intriguing story still a lot of</text>
  <text start="1059.63" dur="3.99">unanswered questions a lot of things to</text>
  <text start="1061.79" dur="3.36">speculate but I&amp;#39;m gonna reiterate a</text>
  <text start="1063.62" dur="3.38">point here that I made at the very</text>
  <text start="1065.15" dur="3.36">beginning of this video is that</text>
  <text start="1067" dur="4.09">understand when things</text>
  <text start="1068.51" dur="4.38">speculations and understand when things</text>
  <text start="1071.09" dur="4.5">are facts okay I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="1072.89" dur="6.45">people again be very gullible latch on</text>
  <text start="1075.59" dur="6.12">to these theories that people present</text>
  <text start="1079.34" dur="5.79">that don&amp;#39;t have any evidence that have</text>
  <text start="1081.71" dur="6.24">very little if any sourcing it&amp;#39;s just I</text>
  <text start="1085.13" dur="6.42">mean it&amp;#39;s good to go through a mental</text>
  <text start="1087.95" dur="5.76">exercise to try to connect dots and put</text>
  <text start="1091.55" dur="5.31">out some guestimation x&amp;#39; and theorize</text>
  <text start="1093.71" dur="6.15">and speculate right but if you actually</text>
  <text start="1096.86" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t have proper evidence then</text>
  <text start="1099.86" dur="5.61">understand that and and make sure that</text>
  <text start="1103.25" dur="4.05">you say what you&amp;#39;re thinking is a theory</text>
  <text start="1105.47" dur="4.47">or a speculation I&amp;#39;m seeing people think</text>
  <text start="1107.3" dur="5.82">that all this solar observatory is being</text>
  <text start="1109.94" dur="4.8">hacked by the Chinese and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1113.12" dur="4.86">reason they say think that&amp;#39;s the fact</text>
  <text start="1114.74" dur="5.07">well who said this okay do you actually</text>
  <text start="1117.98" dur="3.48">know if that&amp;#39;s true what evidence do you</text>
  <text start="1119.81" dur="3.48">have behind their claims right people</text>
  <text start="1121.46" dur="4.26">hear a claim and they run with it so</text>
  <text start="1123.29" dur="4.62">easily don&amp;#39;t do that make sure you have</text>
  <text start="1125.72" dur="3.57">the sporting evidence or there is any</text>
  <text start="1127.91" dur="4.41">sort of sourcing behind that claim</text>
  <text start="1129.29" dur="4.83">before you run with it kay very very</text>
  <text start="1132.32" dur="6.3">important you know this is the age of</text>
  <text start="1134.12" dur="6.24">spin the age of twisted information that</text>
  <text start="1138.62" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re in all sorts of different</text>
  <text start="1140.36" dur="6.45">narratives out there behind any single</text>
  <text start="1142.97" dur="8.03">topic so do the due diligence do the due</text>
  <text start="1146.81" dur="6.84">diligence to discern and research and</text>
  <text start="1151" dur="4.72">inform yourself truly inform yourself</text>
  <text start="1153.65" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t just run with whatever sounds good</text>
  <text start="1155.72" dur="4.32">in that moment so there you go guys</text>
