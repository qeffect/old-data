  <text start="683.379" dur="4.65">an interview on Fox News and he also did</text>
  <text start="685.629" dur="5.49">an interview on CNN which was talking</text>
  <text start="688.029" dur="7.8">about a minute but he&amp;#39;s basically saying</text>
  <text start="691.119" dur="6.72">that he was involved with Spygate in it</text>
  <text start="695.829" dur="3.51">in that some of the people involved in</text>
  <text start="697.839" dur="6.06">Spygate like Peter struck here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="699.339" dur="6.36">trying to use him to frame more people</text>
  <text start="703.899" dur="4.831">so I&amp;#39;m getting that correct you know</text>
  <text start="705.699" dur="7.2">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s making a lot of claims that</text>
  <text start="708.73" dur="8.43">are very odd and some people are</text>
  <text start="712.899" dur="6.271">believing what he says me I&amp;#39;m a little</text>
  <text start="717.16" dur="4.529">more reserved to his claims</text>
  <text start="719.17" dur="4.289">I&amp;#39;m reserved because he&amp;#39;s was saying a</text>
  <text start="721.689" dur="3.81">lot of interesting stuff as Ryan</text>
  <text start="723.459" dur="4.771">Saavedra reporter for The Daily wire</text>

  <text start="758.529" dur="7.86">you know here&amp;#39;s the one with CNN which</text>
  <text start="760.6" dur="8.25">if you&amp;#39;re actually outing Spygate outing</text>
  <text start="766.389" dur="4.38">the illegal treasonous buys abuses why</text>
  <text start="768.85" dur="4.829">would CNN give you any sort of platform</text>
  <text start="770.769" dur="5.97">to tell your story on if there wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="773.679" dur="5.4">some sort of agenda with it right so I</text>
  <text start="776.739" dur="5.22">think this guy&amp;#39;s just coming out you</text>
  <text start="779.079" dur="5.281">know I don&amp;#39;t know why maybe paid off</text>
  <text start="781.959" dur="4.5">maybe he&amp;#39;s being blackmailed maybe this</text>
  <text start="784.36" dur="4.139">guy is deep state himself and he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="794.29" dur="5.759">he&amp;#39;s muddying the waters he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="797.399" dur="3.481">throw me under the bus and sort of maybe</text>
  <text start="800.049" dur="2.421">insulate</text>
  <text start="800.88" dur="4.08">Larry Clinton that&amp;#39;s just a theory of</text>
  <text start="802.47" dur="5.25">mine why would he leave Clinton have</text>
  <text start="804.96" dur="5.46">been spied upon you know we know Trump</text>
  <text start="807.72" dur="5.25">was we know Ted Cruz was as per Q but</text>
  <text start="810.42" dur="5.46">Clinton and Marco Rubio you know again</text>
  <text start="812.97" dur="5.85">maybe his his claims he&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="4.89">with is to throw a few folk to the</text>
  <text start="818.82" dur="3.54">wolves and then insulate like I said</text>
  <text start="820.77" dur="3.9">Clinton or maybe some others so just</text>
  <text start="822.36" dur="5.52">some things to think about and again</text>
  <text start="824.67" dur="4.5">this guy&amp;#39;s on CNN if he was on just Fox</text>
  <text start="827.88" dur="2.61">News there&amp;#39;ll be a little bit more</text>
  <text start="829.17" dur="4.29">believable when he&amp;#39;s getting rolled out</text>
  <text start="830.49" dur="6.24">to Fox and CNN and everywhere so Plus</text>
  <text start="833.46" dur="8.24">like overstock CEO of all people the</text>
  <text start="836.73" dur="8.46">overstock CEO out of nowhere right so</text>
  <text start="841.7" dur="5.55">seems fishy seems fishy you can do your</text>
  <text start="845.19" dur="3.78">own do your own research do your own</text>
  <text start="847.25" dur="4.96">discernment and come up with your own</text>
  <text start="848.97" dur="5.52">conclusions on that one and then here</text>
  <text start="852.21" dur="5.79">was a couple of those contradictions</text>
  <text start="854.49" dur="6.75">that he stated pointed out by an epic</text>
  <text start="858" dur="5.9">Times researcher here so you know more</text>
  <text start="861.24" dur="6.45">truthful than the rest but he told Fox</text>
  <text start="863.9" dur="5.41">that one of the Russian agents trying to</text>
  <text start="867.69" dur="4.89">get involved with him invited him to</text>
  <text start="869.31" dur="5.31">Moscow in March 2016 but then he told</text>
  <text start="872.58" dur="4.02">CNN that the same individual invited him</text>
  <text start="874.62" dur="3.63">to Moscow in July 2015</text>
  <text start="876.6" dur="3.3">so the timelines like I said the</text>
  <text start="878.25" dur="3.99">timelines he&amp;#39;s given out in these</text>
  <text start="879.9" dur="4.35">interviews don&amp;#39;t match up and if you</text>
  <text start="882.24" dur="4.92">gauge his energy to just read his</text>
  <text start="884.25" dur="5.67">resonance he seems very nervous seems</text>
  <text start="887.16" dur="3.96">kind of sweaty like if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="889.92" dur="3.81">telling the truth if you&amp;#39;re telling the</text>
  <text start="891.12" dur="4.2">story like this I don&amp;#39;t know no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.73" dur="4.19">weird totally weird</text>
  <text start="895.32" dur="5.79">okay let&amp;#39;s move on into talking CNN</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="5.26">signing Andrew McCabe of all freaking</text>
  <text start="901.11" dur="6.06">people the guy that got fired from the</text>
  <text start="903.18" dur="8.52">FBI for lying is now going to work at</text>
  <text start="907.17" dur="8.04">CNN well wonderful place for Liars to</text>
  <text start="911.7" dur="8.31">work we know that and no doubt that this</text>
  <text start="915.21" dur="6.96">is going on because well speaking of</text>
  <text start="920.01" dur="4.62">FISA abuses the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="922.17" dur="4.83">Inspector General reportedly completing</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="4.14">the FISA abuse investigation and some</text>
  <text start="927" dur="6.1">reports are stating that that is going</text>
  <text start="928.77" dur="6.07">to AG bar as soon as next week</text>
  <text start="933.1" dur="4.7">which it&amp;#39;s Friday now so that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="934.84" dur="5.28">few days away so this makes sense to me</text>
  <text start="937.8" dur="4.84">putting the dots together here I mean</text>
  <text start="940.12" dur="3">absolutely Andrew McCabe he&amp;#39;s scared</text>
  <text start="942.64" dur="2.31">shitless</text>
  <text start="943.12" dur="3.69">so that&amp;#39;s why CNN&amp;#39;s hiring him so you</text>
  <text start="944.95" dur="3.57">can write a bunch of propaganda for the</text>
  <text start="946.81" dur="4.74">machine there it&amp;#39;s much like when John</text>
  <text start="948.52" dur="6.23">Podesta got exposed in the WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="5.49">emails wasn&amp;#39;t a short time later that he</text>
  <text start="954.75" dur="3.67">ran over to the Washington Post and</text>
  <text start="957.04" dur="3.63">started writing articles for them right</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="4.8">so when any of these deep stake folk get</text>
  <text start="960.67" dur="4.65">exposed they get a job at a propaganda</text>
  <text start="963.22" dur="5.04">machine just to cover their tracks and</text>
  <text start="965.32" dur="6.09">put a bunch of lying stuff out there but</text>
  <text start="968.26" dur="5.13">of course Andrew run to CNN if FISA</text>
  <text start="971.41" dur="3.84">abuses are gonna drop soon he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="973.39" dur="4.89">to cover tracks and that also makes</text>
  <text start="975.25" dur="5.58">sense to me why this guy X overstock CEO</text>
  <text start="978.28" dur="4.56">would come out with all these sort of</text>
  <text start="980.83" dur="4.44">weird accusations in regard to regards</text>
  <text start="982.84" dur="6.12">to a spy gate weird claims again maybe</text>
  <text start="985.27" dur="8.12">trying to muddy the waters and deter the</text>
  <text start="988.96" dur="7.35">investigations before the IG report hits</text>
  <text start="993.39" dur="4.39">so that&amp;#39;s just my thought process is</text>
  <text start="996.31" dur="3.36">through this all and then let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="997.78" dur="3.36">about the last thing here they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="5.73">want to touch on and that&amp;#39;s the Amazon</text>
  <text start="1001.14" dur="6.81">fires so massive fires blowing up in the</text>
  <text start="1005.4" dur="5.79">Amazon rainforest you know truly awful</text>
  <text start="1007.95" dur="5.28">situation we definitely need to my</text>
  <text start="1011.19" dur="4.67">opinion as a society look out for our</text>
  <text start="1013.23" dur="4.8">mother earth a lot more than we do now</text>
  <text start="1015.86" dur="5.71">but there&amp;#39;s something definitely fishy</text>
  <text start="1018.03" dur="4.8">about all of this because well number</text>
  <text start="1021.57" dur="3.48">one look at all the propaganda coming</text>
  <text start="1022.83" dur="4.98">out about it like so much climate change</text>
  <text start="1025.05" dur="5.039">propaganda yeah it&amp;#39;s very convenient for</text>
  <text start="1027.81" dur="4.95">that narrative to be pushed and not just</text>
  <text start="1030.089" dur="6.331">that but Brazil&amp;#39;s new president balls in</text>
  <text start="1032.76" dur="6.12">our Oh Jer balls in our own you know</text>
  <text start="1036.42" dur="5.49">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s basically like the Trump of</text>
  <text start="1038.88" dur="4.92">Brazil the we could say mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1041.91" dur="3.81">and Brazil but also international</text>
  <text start="1043.8" dur="5.16">mainstream media conglomerate they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1045.72" dur="4.86">all trying to attack this guy call him</text>
  <text start="1048.96" dur="5.1">you know like a far-right conspiracy</text>
  <text start="1050.58" dur="5.79">theorist etc etc well balls Naro said</text>
  <text start="1054.06" dur="4.08">that a bunch of NGOs he blamed</text>
  <text start="1056.37" dur="5.49">non-governmental organizations for</text>
  <text start="1058.14" dur="6.09">starting these fires to attack the</text>
  <text start="1061.86" dur="3.45">presidency attack bolzen are there in</text>
  <text start="1064.23" dur="4.53">Brazil</text>
  <text start="1065.31" dur="4.5">and yeah like I could believe it and you</text>
  <text start="1068.76" dur="3.54">look at the mainstream media like</text>
  <text start="1069.81" dur="4.83">Reuters here and I saw a BBC report on</text>
  <text start="1072.3" dur="5.58">this - they&amp;#39;re saying he&amp;#39;s baselessly</text>
  <text start="1074.64" dur="5.25">blaming these NGOs anytime the</text>
  <text start="1077.88" dur="6.9">mainstream media uses the word</text>
  <text start="1079.89" dur="6.48">baselessly it probably is base full it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1084.78" dur="3.12">probably rude in fact they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1086.37" dur="4.14">saying baselessly because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1087.9" dur="4.83">to frame the narrative so I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1090.51" dur="4.41">doubt if NGOs set these fires to attack</text>
  <text start="1092.73" dur="5.61">the presidency there in Brazil if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1094.92" dur="5.43">presidency that&amp;#39;s anti deep state it</text>

  <text start="1118.29" dur="7.8">two ago and they didn&amp;#39;t seem natural</text>
  <text start="1121.94" dur="7.54">seem like they were set by some NGOs</text>
  <text start="1126.09" dur="6.18">some rogue actors and maybe they were</text>
  <text start="1129.48" dur="4.8">set to get some emergency federal</text>
  <text start="1132.27" dur="5.49">funding for California whatever the case</text>
