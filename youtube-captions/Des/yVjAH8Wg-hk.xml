  <text start="120.72" dur="3.33">hardly been here a day but the most</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="4.77">incredible thing that I found here is</text>
  <text start="124.05" dur="6.44">the stories you know going to really any</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="4.98">of these conferences whether it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="130.49" dur="5.47">vaccine awareness conference like autism</text>
  <text start="132.57" dur="4.11">one or even going to a UFO conference or</text>
  <text start="135.96" dur="3.51">something like that</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="4.92">you meet people you meet people you hear</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="4.8">testimonies you hear experiences right</text>
  <text start="141.6" dur="7.35">I&amp;#39;ve talked to I don&amp;#39;t know how many</text>
  <text start="144.27" dur="8.37">parents that have direct testimony of</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="6.63">their child getting harmed getting</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="5.28">injured by a vaccine and not just that</text>
  <text start="155.58" dur="4.83">but all sorts of other testimony I mean</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="5.46">have some of the top scientists and</text>
  <text start="160.41" dur="4.32">doctors in the vaccine awareness</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="3.81">community here we have Andrew Wakefield</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="3.75">I was listening to dr. Brian Hooker</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="3.81">speak earlier I&amp;#39;m gonna be on a panel</text>
  <text start="168.48" dur="5.88">later with Dell big tree actually I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="171" dur="5.91">very excited for that meet him but they</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="4.59">have stories direct testimony of being</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="5.04">vilified by the mainstream media being</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="4.65">lied about okay</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="4.319">especially Andrew Wakefield gosh he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="7.07">been the the whipping boy for the</text>
  <text start="186.269" dur="4.401">mainstream media for quite a while so</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="5.49">do your own research and come come to</text>

  <text start="338.99" dur="5.209">to that wasn&amp;#39;t like consciousness or</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="6.42">eautiful oriented so that means that the</text>
  <text start="344.199" dur="6.49">the level the consciousness level of the</text>
  <text start="348.139" dur="5.25">attendees here might not be on the same</text>
  <text start="350.689" dur="5.97">page as the other ones right there on</text>

  <text start="372.819" dur="3.761">they you know like cue when it comes to</text>
  <text start="375.379" dur="3.331">cueing on or when it comes to a lot of</text>
