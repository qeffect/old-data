  <text start="6.779" dur="6.99">truly what is it gonna bring us we know</text>
  <text start="9.54" dur="7.05">2018 was a ride so no doubt 2019 is only</text>
  <text start="13.769" dur="5.551">going to be more intense but I&amp;#39;m excited</text>
  <text start="16.59" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m extremely excited to figure out what</text>
  <text start="19.32" dur="4.619">this roller coaster of a year I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="4.109">it&amp;#39;s gonna be is going to bring us I</text>
  <text start="23.939" dur="3.781">think it&amp;#39;s gonna be one for the history</text>
  <text start="25.289" dur="3.631">books and as for this video as you know</text>
  <text start="27.72" dur="3.69">I haven&amp;#39;t done one of these general</text>
  <text start="28.92" dur="4.5">updates in like a week week and a half</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="3.989">now so this is just gonna be short sweet</text>
  <text start="33.42" dur="3.33">to the point we&amp;#39;ll cover some of the</text>
  <text start="35.399" dur="3.601">stuff that&amp;#39;s gone on the past couple of</text>
  <text start="36.75" dur="4.7">days and that&amp;#39;s that so let&amp;#39;s go ahead</text>
  <text start="39" dur="2.45">and get started</text>
  <text start="46.18" dur="4.3">now first of all shout out to a sponsor</text>
  <text start="48.829" dur="4.23">of this channel in virtual shield</text>
  <text start="50.48" dur="4.32">dot-com virtual shield is a VPN virtual</text>
  <text start="53.059" dur="3.75">private network service what you</text>
  <text start="54.8" dur="3.689">basically do is download their app you</text>
  <text start="56.809" dur="4.291">connect whichever one of your devices</text>
  <text start="58.489" dur="5.761">you want to their service and it allows</text>
  <text start="61.1" dur="5.28">you to browse the web anonymously and in</text>
  <text start="64.25" dur="3.57">doing so it protects your identity and</text>
  <text start="66.38" dur="3.599">because you&amp;#39;re browsing the web</text>
  <text start="67.82" dur="4.14">anonymously it also keeps your data</text>
  <text start="69.979" dur="4.051">private so whether you&amp;#39;re sending credit</text>
  <text start="71.96" dur="4.35">card info your address over the Internet</text>
  <text start="74.03" dur="6.03">you&amp;#39;re able to encrypt that and keep it</text>
  <text start="76.31" dur="5.729">safe so a VPN is a very good idea to</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="3.839">utilize to protect yourself to keep</text>
  <text start="82.039" dur="3.421">yourself safe with your internet</text>
  <text start="83.899" dur="3.211">browsing if you want to check out</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="3.39">virtual shield service there&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="87.11" dur="3.72">link in the description down below this</text>
  <text start="88.85" dur="3.51">video alright guys so now the first few</text>
  <text start="90.83" dur="3.899">things that I want to cover in this</text>
  <text start="92.36" dur="5.28">video are some pieces of missin</text>
  <text start="94.729" dur="4.801">disinformation that I&amp;#39;ve seen over the</text>
  <text start="97.64" dur="3.899">last week so I haven&amp;#39;t been posting</text>
  <text start="99.53" dur="4.02">quite as much but I&amp;#39;ve definitely been</text>
  <text start="101.539" dur="4.771">lurking on the Internet and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="103.55" dur="4.92">lot of clickbait that I&amp;#39;m seeing fly</text>
  <text start="106.31" dur="4.47">around so I want to touch on that first</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="4.859">of all let&amp;#39;s talk about this video right</text>
  <text start="110.78" dur="5.58">here so this video surfaced the same day</text>
  <text start="113.329" dur="5.161">is that New York electric plant</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="4.619">explosion you know what made the sky</text>
  <text start="118.49" dur="5.22">glow blue and this video came out you</text>
  <text start="120.979" dur="5.971">can see a bunch of lights will look to</text>
  <text start="123.71" dur="5.4">be UFOs in this video these UFOs are all</text>
  <text start="126.95" dur="5.67">blinking there in that triangle shape</text>
  <text start="129.11" dur="4.71">the top one comes down and then near the</text>
  <text start="132.62" dur="3.149">end of this video</text>
  <text start="133.82" dur="3.93">you can see they all somewhat</text>
  <text start="135.769" dur="5.31">dematerialize they face out of existence</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="5.579">right here now what do I want to say</text>
  <text start="141.079" dur="4.981">about this video a few things first of</text>
  <text start="143.329" dur="4.981">all I feel like that was it could have</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="4.89">been a reflection but also that phase</text>
  <text start="148.31" dur="5.16">out that D materialized at the end here</text>
  <text start="150.95" dur="5.009">that straight looks like CGI to me</text>
  <text start="153.47" dur="5.16">computer-generated imagery so it looks</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="5.37">fake I&amp;#39;ve seen quite a few UFO videos in</text>
  <text start="158.63" dur="5.34">my day and this one just does not look</text>
  <text start="161.329" dur="3.271">real not only that but there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="3.66">weird</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="5.16">ominous music that&amp;#39;s overlaid onto the</text>
  <text start="167.63" dur="4.68">video so all you get is music and you</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="4.379">get no other audio so you can&amp;#39;t hear the</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="4.139">reaction of the filmmaker or the</text>
  <text start="174.139" dur="5.041">reaction of anybody that might have been</text>
  <text start="176.449" dur="4.951">there when this video is being taken and</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="4.199">that&amp;#39;s a big thing to look out for when</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="4.169">analyzing whether a video is real or not</text>
  <text start="183.379" dur="4.5">is the reactions of the people in the</text>
  <text start="185.569" dur="4.92">video if you get no reactions it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.879" dur="4.56">probably fake it&amp;#39;s probably CGI but if</text>
  <text start="190.489" dur="5.7">you&amp;#39;re hearing reactions of the people</text>
  <text start="192.439" dur="6.181">taking the video like shock or aw or</text>
  <text start="196.189" dur="4.621">curse words for instance like holy</text>
  <text start="198.62" dur="4.649">what is that in the sky then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="4.409">probably going to be a bit more real</text>
  <text start="203.269" dur="3.991">that&amp;#39;s more evidence that you have that</text>
  <text start="205.219" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s real right so we get no reaction</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="5.129">with this video we get weird music we</text>
  <text start="209.569" dur="6.211">get what looks to be CGI I personally</text>
  <text start="212.389" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t think this is a legit video so</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="3.539">again guys be very careful be very</text>
  <text start="217.459" dur="3.661">critical with your thinking with your</text>
  <text start="219.319" dur="5.1">analyzing don&amp;#39;t get caught up with</text>
  <text start="221.12" dur="5.13">something that looks amazing or look</text>
  <text start="224.419" dur="4.621">sensational to you make sure you have</text>
  <text start="226.25" dur="6.12">all the facts before you begin reporting</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="6.929">on things now this website right here</text>

  <text start="333.449" dur="6.06">to anti-gravity research or the research</text>
  <text start="336.569" dur="5.761">of Victor Shover and then it gets into</text>
  <text start="339.509" dur="5.28">just a lot of other baseless claims like</text>

  <text start="346.169" dur="5.041">extra minute to look at the sources look</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="4.56">at the links because in here none of the</text>
  <text start="351.21" dur="4.44">links actually give evidence to the</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="4.079">claims made so it&amp;#39;s total clickbait I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="3.63">seen this article fly around which is</text>
  <text start="357.389" dur="4.59">why I wanted to cover it and it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="363.87" dur="4.74">proponent of the space force he used to</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="5.459">be a VP at Boeing so he might very well</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="6.059">know information about black projects</text>

  <text start="721.22" dur="7.11">defense in the accusations of being a</text>
  <text start="725.57" dur="4.8">nexium sex slave cult leader in a</text>
  <text start="728.33" dur="5.31">federal court case so she is literally</text>
  <text start="730.37" dur="6.12">claiming that she shouldn&amp;#39;t be charged</text>
  <text start="733.64" dur="6.33">with any of these charges if the Church</text>
  <text start="736.49" dur="7.14">of Scientology isn&amp;#39;t guilty of the exact</text>

  <text start="743.63" dur="4.92">is the real world here I guess it is but</text>
  <text start="747.05" dur="5.12">no doubt this is putting the Church of</text>
  <text start="748.55" dur="6.33">Scientology on blast because I mean</text>
  <text start="752.17" dur="6.31">she&amp;#39;s trying to invoke that defense in</text>
  <text start="754.88" dur="5.31">federal court and they&amp;#39;re so grasping at</text>
  <text start="758.48" dur="3.6">straws here that they literally have to</text>
  <text start="760.19" dur="3.21">invoke this sort of defense with the</text>
  <text start="762.08" dur="3.36">Church of Scientology so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="763.4" dur="5.07">ridiculous and this is one of the big</text>
  <text start="765.44" dur="5.61">things that happened in 2018 2018 was</text>
  <text start="768.47" dur="5.64">most definitely glorious so many things</text>

  <text start="774.11" dur="4.38">pivotal ones right there and lawsuits</text>
  <text start="776.87" dur="4.05">still going on with that and it looks</text>
  <text start="778.49" dur="4.23">like they&amp;#39;re failing miserably next</text>
  <text start="780.92" dur="5.55">another organization failing miserably</text>
  <text start="782.72" dur="7.56">is the Vatican so the Vatican having a</text>
