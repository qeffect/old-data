  <text start="115.679" dur="4.5">bunch of news stories have been coming</text>
  <text start="117.149" dur="5.82">out in regards to basically invisibility</text>
  <text start="120.179" dur="5.61">technology so Toyota actually just filed</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="4.14">for a patent on June 17th filed for the</text>

  <text start="146.769" dur="4.14">actually plan on doing at some point in</text>
  <text start="148.569" dur="4.29">time because it is difficult to fit all</text>
  <text start="150.909" dur="5.3">of this onto one whiteboard and all this</text>
  <text start="152.859" dur="5.91">into one video so anyway we also had a</text>
  <text start="156.209" dur="4.9">another news story come out saying that</text>
  <text start="158.769" dur="5.011">a new window glass switches from clear</text>
  <text start="161.109" dur="5.13">to opaque so you&amp;#39;ll never need curtains</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="6.15">again now in one hand while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.239" dur="5.551">basically disclosing a bunch of cloaking</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="4.949">technology we have a lot of news stories</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="5.789">discussing flying cars so we had Dubai</text>

  <text start="188.409" dur="6.39">right at just secured a thirty million</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="3.509">dollars in new funding and at the very</text>
  <text start="194.799" dur="2.881">same time</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="5.011">DeLorean aerospace is working on a</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="7.139">flying car with a range about 120 miles</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="6.989">so big disclosures coming out of the</text>
  <text start="204.819" dur="5.37">mainstream media but point being</text>
  <text start="207.519" dur="6.69">remember public technology the stuff</text>
  <text start="210.189" dur="7.11">that they disclosed in the mainstream is</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="5.67">decades behind what they really have in</text>
  <text start="217.299" dur="7.351">the black project so you know imagine</text>
  <text start="219.879" dur="7.89">this stuff existing 6070 I should say</text>
  <text start="224.65" dur="6.059">not years ago but 1960s 1970s right even</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="5.55">you know 5060 years ago even so so</text>
  <text start="230.709" dur="5.571">flying taxi in these flying cars flying</text>
  <text start="233.319" dur="6.15">cars they&amp;#39;re utilizing propellers</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="5.819">explosion based technology right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.469" dur="5.071">grandpa&amp;#39;s technology if we were to use</text>
  <text start="242.099" dur="4.06">some of the technologies that you know</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="4.679">locked away in the black projects that</text>
  <text start="246.159" dur="6.54">good old government has classified and</text>
  <text start="249.219" dur="6.961">deemed unworthy for the public domain</text>
  <text start="252.699" dur="5.491">we have implosive right implosive</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="4.979">technology the opposite of explosive but</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="6.449">we have implosive technology that lets</text>
  <text start="261.159" dur="5.221">stuff control gravity we&amp;#39;ve had cloaking</text>
  <text start="264.639" dur="3.121">right in the black projects for decades</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="4.23">so just remember every</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="4.41">thing they&amp;#39;re telling us is old right</text>
  <text start="270.61" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s just what they&amp;#39;re letting show</text>
  <text start="272.17" dur="4.56">just scratch your head just speculate at</text>
  <text start="274.54" dur="5.19">the real technology that they use the</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="4.68">trillions of dollars in tax money and in</text>
  <text start="279.73" dur="3.42">Pentagon money and all that jazz</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="4.91">trillions of dollars and all the</text>
  <text start="283.15" dur="6.21">classified stuff just speculate just</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="5.26">imagine what they could possibly have</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="2.58">and in my opinion it&amp;#39;s all coming our</text>
  <text start="291.58" dur="3.59">way</text>
  <text start="291.94" dur="5.79">very soon as long as we continue</text>
  <text start="295.17" dur="6.22">disclosing it ourselves right because we</text>
  <text start="297.73" dur="4.53">can&amp;#39;t rely on the mainstream to do it</text>
  <text start="301.39" dur="2.7">for us so as long as we continue</text>
  <text start="302.26" dur="4.86">disclosing ourselves and demand the</text>
  <text start="304.09" dur="5.67">truth take action for it will get</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.47">disclosure ASAP so there&amp;#39;s a bunch of</text>
  <text start="309.76" dur="3.12">stuff on cloaking and flying cars next</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m going to talk to him crap about</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="3.57">health and medicine right it&amp;#39;s all</text>

  <text start="451.25" dur="4.14">the most toxic so really what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="4.11">trying to do is make the masses think</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="5.94">they need it when they don&amp;#39;t and then</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="6.66">this odd article so it says plants have</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="6.72">been hijacked to create a new vaccine</text>
  <text start="464.09" dur="5.76">and it could ratty Raticate polio weird</text>

  <text start="472.61" dur="5.25">eradicated hmm but apparently they need</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="4.05">to hijack plants in this case they took</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="4.41">the tobacco plant and took genes out of</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="4.109">it and manufactured this new vaccine in</text>
  <text start="482.27" dur="4.53">the genes of the tobacco planet let me</text>
  <text start="484.039" dur="5.161">tell you no matter what you hijacked to</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="4.32">make a vaccine it&amp;#39;s not going to be good</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="4.98">for you because you&amp;#39;re injecting foreign</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="5.1">DNA foreign substances and in all cases</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="3.87">every single vaccine has heavy metal</text>
  <text start="496.22" dur="6.3">residue nanoparticles and most likely</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="5.91">bio warfare agents right woo goo I</text>
  <text start="502.52" dur="3.78">wasn&amp;#39;t planning on talking about that on</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="4.62">day 2 but maybe I might add that into my</text>
  <text start="506.3" dur="4.32">presentation real quick and then lastly</text>
  <text start="508.58" dur="6.149">a GMO salmon are not for sale in Canada</text>

  <text start="514.729" dur="4.291">see critical research see that video</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="4.14">that I just did the other week on</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="4.8">vaccine stuff if you need more</text>
  <text start="521.78" dur="3.809">information on it right if you need to</text>
  <text start="523.82" dur="3.39">arm yourself with little more knowledge</text>
  <text start="525.589" dur="3.241">and I have yet to do one on GMOs</text>
  <text start="527.21" dur="4.2">actually but that&amp;#39;d be a good idea to do</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="7.08">and lastly let&amp;#39;s get into some space</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="9.06">history and quantum stuff so first our</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="7.32">article again small whiteboard I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="4.83">getting a big one soon I got 12 articles</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="4.23">written on this trying to fit as much as</text>
  <text start="545.3" dur="4.53">I can this article that came out on the</text>
  <text start="547.46" dur="5.52">10th the moon kept its magnetic field</text>
  <text start="549.83" dur="6.08">far longer than anybody expected so this</text>
  <text start="552.98" dur="5.58">is kind of puzzling scientists in that</text>
  <text start="555.91" dur="7.36">they got some weird readings they</text>
  <text start="558.56" dur="6.24">weren&amp;#39;t expecting from basically a rock</text>
  <text start="563.27" dur="5.52">sample that was brought back by the</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="5.37">Apollo 15 app astronauts and it captured</text>
  <text start="568.79" dur="3.96">it had the evidence of the magnetic</text>
  <text start="570.17" dur="5.94">field that was far stronger than they</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="5.73">thought and very interesting right</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="3.99">because all the whistleblowers we have</text>
  <text start="578.48" dur="6.8">coming out are saying that the moon</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="8.58">isn&amp;#39;t some big rock there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="585.28" dur="5.5">civilizations on it for a long time even</text>
  <text start="588.68" dur="5.49">you know thousands if not millions of</text>
  <text start="590.78" dur="6.9">years so very interesting article I put</text>
  <text start="594.17" dur="5.58">spaceship moon here and then this ties</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="4.92">into the next one a new theory suggests</text>
  <text start="599.75" dur="7.77">we are the only technologically advanced</text>
  <text start="602.6" dur="9.18">civilization still around so I have</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="6.27">written here partial disclosure BS and</text>
  <text start="611.78" dur="4.95">this could very well be fitting into</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="4.53">that whole psychological operation that</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;ve explained before in what partial</text>
  <text start="618.32" dur="5.34">disclosure is very quickly they are</text>
  <text start="621.41" dur="4.92">trying to wow us and dazzle us with all</text>
  <text start="623.66" dur="5.07">this new science new technology and</text>
  <text start="626.33" dur="4.17">cloaking and flying cars and you know</text>
  <text start="628.73" dur="5.58">all this other stuff they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="630.5" dur="5.97">wow us but keep a lot of the deep dark</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="4.71">secrets hushed right like a lot of the</text>
  <text start="636.47" dur="4.44">nefarious occult ritual practice of the</text>
  <text start="639.02" dur="4.05">elite they&amp;#39;re trying to make us think</text>
  <text start="640.91" dur="3.63">that argument artificial intelligence is</text>
  <text start="643.07" dur="4.38">this brand-new thing try to merge man</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="4.83">and machine not brand new but magic new</text>
  <text start="647.45" dur="7.08">thing and then you know still get us on</text>
  <text start="649.37" dur="7.26">the whole vaccine GMO train so big much</text>
  <text start="654.53" dur="3.54">more longer broader story behind it but</text>
  <text start="656.63" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s the big thing which is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.07" dur="3.87">so important to me that I do these</text>
  <text start="659.87" dur="4.2">science and technology you know videos</text>
  <text start="661.94" dur="5.13">so you guys can understand what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="664.07" dur="5.5">going on in that world you know from a</text>
  <text start="667.07" dur="4.39">much more deeper understanding</text>
  <text start="669.57" dur="3.35">new theory suggests we are the only</text>
  <text start="671.46" dur="5.1">technologically advanced civilization</text>
  <text start="672.92" dur="6.79">that&amp;#39;s a bunch of BS and then another</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="4.56">story quantum weirdness right because</text>
  <text start="679.71" dur="3.57">science these days when they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="681.12" dur="3.93">understand something or they&amp;#39;re dots</text>
  <text start="683.28" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t connect because they have a bunch</text>
  <text start="685.05" dur="3.72">of bad foundational theories over there</text>
  <text start="686.79" dur="4.17">they just call it weirdness quantum</text>
  <text start="688.77" dur="5.31">weirdness but how many researchers have</text>
  <text start="690.96" dur="6.06">we have tell us that there&amp;#39;s a basically</text>
  <text start="694.08" dur="4.92">field connecting us all right Rupert</text>
  <text start="697.02" dur="4.2">Sheldrake in his morphic field will talk</text>
  <text start="699" dur="4.71">in a source field we got the ether we</text>
  <text start="701.22" dur="4.59">got the you know intelligent infinity</text>
  <text start="703.71" dur="7.08">and god creator source oneness theories</text>
  <text start="705.81" dur="8.52">so catch up science come on understand a</text>
  <text start="710.79" dur="6.48">little universal law and bring bring</text>
  <text start="714.33" dur="5.43">your creator back to science and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="717.27" dur="4.56">find some answers and then lastly which</text>
  <text start="719.76" dur="4.2">could also a story that could be used in</text>
  <text start="721.83" dur="4.71">that partial disclosure narrative that I</text>
  <text start="723.96" dur="3.99">mentioned all the hidden volcanoes you</text>
  <text start="726.54" dur="2.4">know over 100 hidden volcanoes were</text>
  <text start="727.95" dur="5.19">found in Antarctica</text>
  <text start="728.94" dur="8.37">so I mean could they use this as a story</text>
  <text start="733.14" dur="9.81">to release information about ancient</text>
  <text start="737.31" dur="7.53">civilizations in Antarctica maybe or you</text>
  <text start="742.95" dur="3.54">know they&amp;#39;ll stumble upon it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.84" dur="3.24">setting us up to make us believe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746.49" dur="3.99">the only ones around and then they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="748.08" dur="4.53">stumble upon it these hidden volcanoes</text>
  <text start="750.48" dur="4.14">they went off or there was caverns</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="4.74">created by them that led us find</text>
  <text start="754.62" dur="4.26">magically stumble upon some pyramids</text>
  <text start="757.35" dur="3.48">down in Antarctica or something and then</text>
  <text start="758.88" dur="4.92">you know big partial disclosure of sight</text>
  <text start="760.83" dur="5.27">out there so just speculating again a</text>
  <text start="763.8" dur="5.36">lot of what I do here is speculating but</text>
  <text start="766.1" dur="5.74">part of its necessary just estimating</text>
  <text start="769.16" dur="5.08">what you could call it but anyway</text>
  <text start="771.84" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s much stuff in regards to science</text>
  <text start="774.24" dur="3.99">and tech stay tuned for those live</text>
  <text start="776.19" dur="5.35">videos I&amp;#39;m doing later this week thank</text>
  <text start="778.23" dur="5.37">you all and I&amp;#39;ll be back peace</text>
