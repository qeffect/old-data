  <text start="15.78" dur="3.72">all I want to talk about the new Google</text>
  <text start="17.88" dur="4.319">Whistleblower we have on the scene</text>
  <text start="19.5" dur="4.23">Zachary Voorhees the dude who recently</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="3.301">has been going public with his</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="4.2">experience of literally working at</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="4.56">YouTube and at Google and having</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="5.19">first-hand experience with practices</text>
  <text start="30.06" dur="5.94">like shadow banning censorship search</text>
  <text start="33.12" dur="4.17">engine manipulation all sorts of creepy</text>
  <text start="36" dur="3.27">shady stuff going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="37.29" dur="4.92">at Google there I also want to talk</text>
  <text start="39.27" dur="4.53">about the broad spectrum of topics that</text>
  <text start="42.21" dur="4.2">Google censors you know it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="43.8" dur="4.56">one topic or politics it it&amp;#39;s across the</text>
  <text start="46.41" dur="4.95">board and not just that but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="48.36" dur="5.31">talk about how impactful this really is</text>
  <text start="51.36" dur="4.8">a lot of people might not think much of</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="5.779">Google manipulating a search engine a</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="5.789">little bit but truly this influences the</text>
  <text start="59.449" dur="4.93">public understanding the collective</text>
  <text start="61.949" dur="5.221">consciousness in a massive massive way</text>
  <text start="64.379" dur="5.85">so let&amp;#39;s get into this first with Zack</text>
  <text start="67.17" dur="5.67">Zack Voorhees now I&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="5.671">get an interview of him on this channel</text>

  <text start="79.68" dur="4.14">he&amp;#39;s doing and what he&amp;#39;s bringing to the</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="4.38">table lately and he&amp;#39;s been doing</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="3.15">interviews with people across the board</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="2.94">across the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="3.93">alternative media really whoever will</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="4.83">listen whoever has the courage to report</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="5.7">on what Zack is discussing project</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="4.65">Veritas was one of the first outlets</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="2.699">that went public with his story about a</text>
  <text start="98.07" dur="3.9">week ago and he&amp;#39;s done some other</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="4.14">interviews but as project Veritas says</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="2.969">here and I&amp;#39;ll link them down below</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="4.14">because they have some really</text>
  <text start="104.939" dur="4.47">interesting documents that Zack brought</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="4.051">project Veritas that you can read for</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="4.111">yourself but their headline says Google</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="4.5">quote machine learning fairness</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="5.309">whistleblower goes public says a burden</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="4.94">was lifted off of his soul machine</text>
  <text start="118.829" dur="4.801">learning fairness that&amp;#39;s Google&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.07" dur="5.979">politically correct whitewashed way of</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="6.269">basically saying non biased artificial</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="6.541">intelligence that is absolutely biased</text>
  <text start="129.899" dur="7.56">and let&amp;#39;s be real a human somewhere too</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.85">filip that AI to work so Google&amp;#39;s hidin</text>
  <text start="137.459" dur="4.081">in whitewash and quite a bit here but oh</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="4.5">yeah burden lifted off of his soul for</text>
  <text start="141.54" dur="5.64">sure I mean if you&amp;#39;re involved in these</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="4.59">companies taking corrupt money paychecks</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="3.24">and you start waking up to what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="4.26">on around you and what you&amp;#39;re involved</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="5.58">with oh yeah it&amp;#39;s gonna be a burden</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="6">lifted off of your soul to go public</text>
  <text start="156" dur="4.53">with all of this so good job Zach much</text>
  <text start="158.79" dur="4.68">appreciated and we support you my</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="5.489">brother and he leaked hundreds of</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="6.12">internal Google documents to project</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="7.321">Veritas News blacklists human raters</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="6.57">YouTube CEO video etc etc again at the</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="3.959">very bottom here you can click on these</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="4.889">check them out for yourself especially</text>
  <text start="177.299" dur="4.921">the blacklist the News blacklist that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.049" dur="3.33">when we&amp;#39;ll talk about a minute here you</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="4.2">can find that under the censorship tab</text>
  <text start="184.379" dur="3.631">but nevertheless there&amp;#39;s Zach right</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="3.209">there you can watch some of his</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="4.38">testimonies watch what he has to say in</text>
  <text start="189.629" dur="5.22">fact go follow him twitter at perpetual</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="5.4">maniac I&amp;#39;ll link that down below he</text>
  <text start="194.849" dur="5.281">tweets a lot of great stuff so go follow</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="6.9">him there and then let&amp;#39;s talk about that</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="7.439">News blacklist ok so essentially one of</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="6.269">those leaked documents allegedly said</text>
  <text start="207.569" dur="6.54">that Google has a list of terms that it</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="5.131">was purposefully suppressing and when</text>
  <text start="214.109" dur="4.951">you look at the lists of this terms it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.09" dur="4.799">it&amp;#39;s very long it&amp;#39;s like 20 30 pages and</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="4.709">the list of this terms is incredible a</text>
  <text start="220.889" dur="4.561">lot of these have to do with I mean what</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="2.911">look to be false flag events that the</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="3.149">deeps tape pulled whether it was mass</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="3.059">shootings or this event that event a lot</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="3.961">of stuff having to do with the Las Vegas</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="4.83">shooting and parkland and some other</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="4.769">ones so you know when it comes to those</text>
  <text start="234.569" dur="5.431">events censoring and maintaining the</text>
  <text start="237.329" dur="6.331">public narrative is crucial for the</text>
  <text start="240" dur="6.12">proper execution of a deep state false</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="4.859">flag in their eyes right so no doubt</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="4.35">no wonder Google would do deep state</text>
  <text start="248.519" dur="4.951">bidding and censor anything having to do</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="6.03">with these search terms a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="4.949">across that some political terms that</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="4.169">are suppressed I mean it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="4.441">ridiculous and recently in recent days</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="5.521">we&amp;#39;re learning from individuals that</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="4.35">Google was even suppressing I mean</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="2.52">Google was me</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="3.69">relating their search engine so much</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="4.53">during this 2016 election that it could</text>
  <text start="270.9" dur="6.81">have swung millions of votes Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="8.16">way away from Trump right so gosh no</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="6.12">doubt Google has political bias that we</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="4.919">are learning about but what I find</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="5.76">especially intriguing is that like I</text>
  <text start="286.319" dur="5.341">said earlier it&amp;#39;s not just conservatives</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="3.84">that are censored we have to see the</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="4.05">bigger picture get above the labels guys</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="4.5">not just conservatives it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="4.049">political information that&amp;#39;s damaging to</text>
  <text start="297.93" dur="2.22">the deep state you know it doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="299.759" dur="3">a label</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s just damaging truth that the deep</text>
  <text start="302.759" dur="4.201">state doesn&amp;#39;t want out and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="5.909">political but even the words cure cancer</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="5.79">and cancer cure were found in these</text>
  <text start="310.289" dur="4.111">leaked documents in this blacklist list</text>
  <text start="312.75" dur="5.16">the words that they were shadow banning</text>
  <text start="314.4" dur="5.67">cure cancer and cancer cure and the</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="4.77">information that Google censors here</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="5.01">this is a very important point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="5.639">anything damaging to deep state</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="7.14">narratives especially natural health</text>
  <text start="328.319" dur="5.371">especially information that Big Pharma</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="3.539">doesn&amp;#39;t want out there in fact over the</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="4.83">last two years I&amp;#39;ve been censored a lot</text>
  <text start="335.759" dur="4.171">from Google YouTube same thing as Google</text>
  <text start="338.52" dur="5.119">I&amp;#39;ve been censored a lot from them and</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="6.18">the thing I am censored from the most is</text>
  <text start="343.639" dur="5.381">natural health information I&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="346.11" dur="5.25">videos have Twitter post gone all sorts</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="5.61">of stuff right other topics yes</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="5.67">political false flag events etc even</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="4.08">some free energy information we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="3.99">to in a minute but especially natural</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="4.739">health and this article recently came</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="4.29">out of selfed hacked and it says Google</text>
  <text start="363.449" dur="5.25">is taking censorship of Health websites</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="5.88">to the next level most definitely</text>
  <text start="368.699" dur="4.891">and I&amp;#39;ve discussed this plenty before in</text>
  <text start="371.19" dur="4.62">that natural health censorship has been</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="4.109">ongoing even before Google even before</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="3.359">the internet you know doctors we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.699" dur="3.931">getting natural health doctors were</text>
  <text start="379.169" dur="4.831">getting suppressed way back decades ago</text>
  <text start="381.63" dur="4.379">but the internet you know it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="384" dur="3.719">information that they&amp;#39;re truly trying to</text>
  <text start="386.009" dur="3.75">censor they don&amp;#39;t want that reaching</text>
  <text start="387.719" dur="4.351">people&amp;#39;s eyes you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="389.759" dur="3.571">mental game it&amp;#39;s a mental game that</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re going through here this whole</text>
  <text start="393.33" dur="5.67">awakening it&amp;#39;s a mental spiritual</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="4.8">process so Google is absolutely</text>
  <text start="399" dur="4.53">censoring and in this article</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="4.74">myself hacked it discusses why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.53" dur="4.38">censoring you know discussing different</text>
  <text start="405.69" dur="4.74">search engines you can use which most</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="4.74">definitely you know go to DuckDuckGo go</text>
  <text start="410.43" dur="4.95">to these alternative ones that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="4.14">have the algorithms like Google does you</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="3.6">know you can learn how to work with</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="3.66">Google with different keywords getting</text>
  <text start="418.98" dur="3.48">very specific with you keywords and</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="3.89">searches and whatnot but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="4.32">definitely gonna find better results</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="4.72">utilizing Google and an alternative or</text>
  <text start="426.78" dur="4.62">just an alternative like DuckDuckGo</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="4.23">Google is the thought police there and</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="3.36">now let&amp;#39;s go into the list of some of</text>
  <text start="433.29" dur="4.83">the health websites and health</text>

  <text start="713.879" dur="3.69">because they want us to go along the</text>

  <text start="717.569" dur="7.02">but Google is suppressing low energy</text>
  <text start="721.439" dur="5.791">nuclear reactions or cold fusion cold</text>
  <text start="724.589" dur="4.8">fusion if you do some background</text>
  <text start="727.23" dur="4.469">research on it there was two scientists</text>
  <text start="729.389" dur="4.651">I believe out of Utah who figured out</text>
  <text start="731.699" dur="5.07">how to make room temperature nuclear</text>
  <text start="734.04" dur="5.37">reactions with palladium and then some</text>
  <text start="736.769" dur="5.101">other compounds but nevertheless it was</text>
  <text start="739.41" dur="5.01">room temperature essentially cold fusion</text>
  <text start="741.87" dur="6.899">and this is a breakthrough this is huge</text>
  <text start="744.42" dur="7.74">because this can lead to massive ways of</text>
  <text start="748.769" dur="5.13">bringing energy literally electricity to</text>
  <text start="752.16" dur="4.32">the table that doesn&amp;#39;t need fossil fuels</text>
  <text start="753.899" dur="5.79">doesn&amp;#39;t need gas oil coal any of that</text>
  <text start="756.48" dur="5.729">now these scientists were heavily</text>
  <text start="759.689" dur="3.75">suppressed there was another scientist</text>
  <text start="762.209" dur="3.271">out there by the name of dr. Eugene</text>

  <text start="782.819" dur="4.71">energy inventor body count or how about</text>
  <text start="785.16" dur="4.289">the dead holistic doctor body count</text>
  <text start="787.529" dur="3.9">right is that sort of why I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="796.949" dur="5.971">Internet as I&amp;#39;ve been explaining here</text>
  <text start="800.339" dur="7.98">and Google censoring this stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.92" dur="7.68">it&amp;#39;s massively influential to our</text>

  <text start="813.87" dur="5.219">what could we do with these disease</text>
  <text start="815.249" dur="5.611">rates huh and Big Pharma would lose a</text>
  <text start="819.089" dur="3.54">lot of money what would happen if we</text>
  <text start="820.86" dur="3.659">actually got this free energy science</text>
  <text start="822.629" dur="5.7">true science out into the public domain</text>
  <text start="824.519" dur="5.911">true possibility huh</text>
  <text start="828.329" dur="3.541">the deep state would lose a lot of money</text>
  <text start="830.43" dur="4.529">so no doubt that they want to suppress</text>
  <text start="831.87" dur="6.589">that and this information as well would</text>
  <text start="834.959" dur="5.61">be absolutely liberating to us truly</text>
