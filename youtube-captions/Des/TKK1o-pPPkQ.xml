  <text start="0" dur="3.929">this video is going to involved you</text>
  <text start="1.829" dur="4.53">redesigning what you think you know</text>
  <text start="3.929" dur="4.651">about everything the reciprocal systems</text>
  <text start="6.359" dur="4.711">theory or the theory of everything was</text>
  <text start="8.58" dur="4.71">invented by Dewey B Larsen who is an</text>
  <text start="11.07" dur="4.769">engineer and an astrophysicist in the</text>
  <text start="13.29" dur="4.739">mid 1900s because you think there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="15.839" dur="4.11">many things that modern science cannot</text>
  <text start="18.029" dur="3.931">answer what is gravity</text>
  <text start="19.949" dur="4.471">what is inertial force the Big Bang</text>
  <text start="21.96" dur="4.44">Theory is kind of nonsense so he came to</text>
  <text start="24.42" dur="3.51">this theory very open-minded but very</text>
  <text start="26.4" dur="3.42">structurally and scientifically sound</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="4.259">too he studied the likes of Einstein</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="3.96">Tesla and Schrodinger and he created a</text>
  <text start="32.189" dur="3.511">theoretical framework that explains</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="4.02">everything from the largest to the</text>
  <text start="35.7" dur="4.109">smallest from galaxies and superclusters</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="3.48">all the way down to the atom and cool</text>
  <text start="39.809" dur="3.27">enough it brings together both the</text>
  <text start="41.28" dur="4.11">physical and the metaphysical realm to</text>
  <text start="43.079" dur="3.691">explaining all the magic associated with</text>
  <text start="45.39" dur="3.87">human consciousness and spirituality</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="4.379">this reciprocal Systems Theory blow is</text>
  <text start="49.26" dur="3.84">all current dogmatic science out of the</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="4.741">water the dogmatic science taught in the</text>
  <text start="53.1" dur="5.009">high bastions of our education system by</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="3.689">education I mean indoctrination the</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="3.121">owners of the planet wouldn&amp;#39;t own it if</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="3.361">we knew what was really going on but</text>
  <text start="61.23" dur="3.719">luckily like Larson we can unlearn</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="3.42">relearn and take our power back now</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="3.691">what&amp;#39;s cool about this theory is that</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="4.439">it&amp;#39;s complex enough to explain most all</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="4.049">observable science yet basic enough</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="4.621">fresh actually to comprehend the ideas</text>
  <text start="72.689" dur="4.921">of it reciprocal system as a scientific</text>
  <text start="75.42" dur="4.23">fancy way to describe yin yin yang or</text>
  <text start="77.61" dur="3.57">duality Larsen postulates that what</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="4.23">makes up our physical universe isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="4.71">matter but its motion existing in three</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="4.44">dimensions with two reciprocal aspects</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="4.56">space and time space and time both have</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="4.53">their receptive sectors which he calls</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="4.8">the material in the cosmic sector the</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="5.37">material sector is what we currently see</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.189">that is space-time or space over time</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="4.35">this material sector has three</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="4.651">dimensions of space and only one of time</text>
  <text start="102.57" dur="5.07">the motion occurs physically up down</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="5.279">front back left right but it&amp;#39;s the time</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="6.03">that is fixed now the cosmic sector is</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="5.491">time space or time over space this is</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="5.01">the metaphysical reality with three</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="4.56">dimensions of time and one of space you</text>
  <text start="118.68" dur="4.02">can see the yin-yang duality here</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.44">physical and metaphysical with motion</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="3.84">making it all interesting how they never</text>
  <text start="124.86" dur="3.599">show pictures of our solar system in</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="4.079">school with motion involved they gotta</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="3.661">hide the hints the fun part about this</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="2.431">theory is that it logically explains</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="2.22">gravity free</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="4.83">energy faster than light travel</text>
  <text start="134.34" dur="5.64">telepathy dematerialization and a bunch</text>
  <text start="137.88" dur="3.36">of other fringe concepts hope you</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="3.27">enjoyed the basics of this physical</text>
  <text start="141.24" dur="3.39">model that I tried to piece together and</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="3">I believe Larson&amp;#39;s theory are large</text>
  <text start="144.63" dur="4.37">parts of it&amp;#39;ll be standard learning for</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="2.75">everyone in the near future</text>
