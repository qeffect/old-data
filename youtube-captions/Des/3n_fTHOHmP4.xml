  <text start="10.219" dur="5.05">April 30th coming at you with another</text>
  <text start="12.389" dur="4.711">one of my news roundups today and sorry</text>
  <text start="15.269" dur="4.621">for the video absence for a couple days</text>
  <text start="17.1" dur="5.04">I actually filmed one of these yesterday</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="3.69">on the 29th but when I went to upload it</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="4.32">it was gonna take me three freaking</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="5.459">hours so I wasn&amp;#39;t able to upload I</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="4.829">didn&amp;#39;t at the time nobody got time to</text>
  <text start="29.039" dur="4.591">upload a freaking video for three hours</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="3.391">so don&amp;#39;t worry I&amp;#39;m actually getting a</text>
  <text start="33.63" dur="3.6">new computer probably within the next</text>
  <text start="34.68" dur="5.399">week or so so that means more videos for</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="3.84">you guys and less rage for me man some</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="3.361">people have road rage</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="4.38">I have computer age I grew up in the</text>
  <text start="43.44" dur="4.26">very last stages of that dial-up</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="4.35">internet phase and man I just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="3.839">stand slow computers so anyway I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="5.489">excited for a new computer give you guys</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="5.191">more videos but anyway let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="2.461">today&amp;#39;s news because there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="56.73" dur="2.73">stuff I haven&amp;#39;t done one of these in a</text>
  <text start="57.75" dur="6.03">few days so a lot of little bullet</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="6.42">points to cover and go over and the main</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="5.37">concept is basically today are they</text>
  <text start="65.88" dur="5.94">freaking toying with us right is the</text>
  <text start="69.15" dur="4.829">mainstream media just dangling the truth</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="4.35">right in front of our faces and let me</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="5.28">explain you see the first bullet point</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="4.68">here is the MSM mainstream media ceding</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="3.631">our consciousness or they basically just</text>
  <text start="80.85" dur="5.159">playing games with us because look at</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="5.22">all these bullet points you go on any</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="4.021">mainstream media outlet and the amount</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.13">of truth they&amp;#39;re literally throwing in</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="5.81">plain sight is absurd first I saw this</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="4.5">on science alert a couple days ago they</text>
  <text start="95.84" dur="3.25">the headline of this article was</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="4.05">physicists just came up with a</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="7.349">mathematical model for a viable time</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="6.42">machine Wow because apparently you know</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="4.171">according to mr. Blore testimony they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="108.21" dur="6.9">had this technology in the secret space</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="5.939">projects for decades so if you really</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="5.16">know what&amp;#39;s going on that&amp;#39;s no big whoop</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="6.811">Dee woo but of course to the mainstream</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="5.25">public that&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty cool so</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="4.259">again understand what soft disclosure is</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re letting out bits of</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.921">truth at a time to cede our</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="3.6">consciousness but now what I&amp;#39;m saying is</text>
  <text start="132.54" dur="2.37">that it&amp;#39;s getting to a point where</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re putting so much stuff out there</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="4.56">that it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re toying with us so</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="5.1">not only on science alert time travel</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="5.4">model you look at like any website</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;ll find something on Antarctica all</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="3.99">sorts of stories I saw one on Nat Geo</text>
  <text start="146.82" dur="4.29">yesterday science alert even Hollywood</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="3.99">in the new Fast and Furious movie the</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="4.59">main scene of that movie the main race</text>
  <text start="152.85" dur="4.83">takes place on Antarctica this movie</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="4.98">just came out and it grossed higher than</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="6.15">Star Wars did so a lot of people saw</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="7.41">that on fox news they literally</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="7.53">literally had an article that stated we</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="7.14">bring up the headline here said the</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="6.54">wreckage of a mysterious ancient planet</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="6.9">is orbiting Mars a Starman astronomers</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="5.73">discover Wow because if you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="182.13" dur="4.11">this let me get you give you a little</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="5.73">bit of background again not only</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="6.27">according to whistleblower testimony but</text>
  <text start="189.36" dur="5.58">even a NASA scientist himself I forget</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="6.27">his name but he called it the exploding</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="7.47">planet hypothesis there apparently used</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="6.96">to be a larger planet a larger celestial</text>
  <text start="202.41" dur="5.34">object in our solar system and so many</text>
  <text start="205.74" dur="3.18">thousand years ago whether it was a five</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="3.24">hundred thousand or about a million</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="4.5">years ago by some estimates this planet</text>
  <text start="210.99" dur="3.93">exploded however it exploded but this is</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="3.93">essentially what created the asteroid</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="4.38">belt right and then Mars was a moon of</text>
  <text start="217.35" dur="3.57">this planet this planet goes by many</text>
  <text start="219.3" dur="4.23">names again you can research the</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="4.289">exploding planet hypothesis from that</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="4.47">NASA scientists it&amp;#39;s also been called</text>
  <text start="225.209" dur="5.071">qiyamat Electra</text>
  <text start="228" dur="3.9">I think Wikipedia has an article on it</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="3.63">called like Phaeton or something a lot</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="3.54">of different names but it&amp;#39;s all the same</text>
  <text start="233.91" dur="3.09">concept so this is really interesting</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="4.11">because it says the wreckage of a</text>
  <text start="237" dur="4.8">mysterious ancient planet is orbiting</text>
  <text start="239.55" dur="4.8">Mars so it&amp;#39;s a little bit of truth it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.8" dur="4.2">like okay ancient planet wreckage</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="5.04">orbiting Mars but it&amp;#39;s kind of backwards</text>
  <text start="246" dur="4.89">Mars used to orbit the planet so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="3.51">a big truth in plain sight right there a</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="3.48">little bit of misinformation mixed in of</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="2.25">course because you know they just want</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="3.6">to give us a little bit of the</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="6.33">breadcrumbs but right there in plain</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="6.15">sight and this one was big as well okay</text>
  <text start="261.48" dur="5.07">humans found living a hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="2.97">thousand years ago in California and</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="3.06">this</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="6.06">was everywhere this was on all kinds of</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="7.86">different all kinds of different outlets</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="6.21">and I just pulled up the one on New York</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="4.169">Times right here I need like a green</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="6.9">screen right one of these days I got</text>
  <text start="281.639" dur="6.75">plans don&amp;#39;t you worry but it was a bold</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="4.439">and fierce article published in the</text>
  <text start="288.389" dur="3.691">journal Nature again I actually featured</text>
  <text start="290.699" dur="3.141">the journal Nature in one of these news</text>
  <text start="292.08" dur="4.35">updates talking about soft disclosure</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="4.15">last week I think so it&amp;#39;s like that</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="3.54">journal they&amp;#39;re using they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="4.37">nature to push a lot of this stuff out</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="5.79">there into the public light but anyway</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="5.5">that&amp;#39;s big it literally predates all the</text>
  <text start="305.76" dur="3.48">history that we thought we knew it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="3.029">like they literally have to rewrite the</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="3.69">history books every year because this</text>
  <text start="310.889" dur="5.791">stuff keeps coming and surfacing to the</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="6.93">public so it&amp;#39;s you know crazy 130,000</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="5.19">years ago way before people thought</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="4.74">people existed and then we have NASA</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="4.56">again and this one I didn&amp;#39;t film in</text>
  <text start="324.6" dur="3.06">yesterday&amp;#39;s update but so I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="5.01">glad I did this again today</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="6.72">a NASA article or an article that</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="4.74">circulated around says NASA is on the</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="5.73">brink of the most profound discovery</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="5.67">ever and it says the US Congress has</text>
  <text start="340.11" dur="4.26">been told that NASA is on the cusp of</text>
  <text start="341.85" dur="4.74">the most profound discovery ever alien</text>
  <text start="344.37" dur="6.47">life in our solar system or beyond and</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="7.38">this has to do with that moon of Saturn</text>
  <text start="350.84" dur="4.6">insalata s-- and almost forgot the name</text>
  <text start="353.97" dur="3.36">for a second there it has to do with</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="3.539">that apparently they&amp;#39;ve analyzed</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="3.69">whatever they found on there and found</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="4.891">hydrothermal reactions are happening</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="4.769">between water and rock big whoop</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="4.1">but interestingly enough I&amp;#39;m reading</text>
  <text start="365.789" dur="6.541">this article on the Express right now</text>
  <text start="367.97" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s not found under their weird news</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="3.3">section a lot of times when they like to</text>
  <text start="373.83" dur="3.51">disclose information like this they put</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="3.99">it under their weird news section so</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="3.75">people take it seriously but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="379.62" dur="3.75">really take it seriously this was on</text>
  <text start="381.09" dur="3.54">their straight-up science page so again</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re really trying to get people to</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="6.509">take this stuff seriously and seeing all</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="5.22">of this kind of frustrates me are they</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="2.221">freaking toying with us because I</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="2.4">understand the point of ceding</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="3.66">consciousness but if you&amp;#39;re gonna put</text>
  <text start="394.53" dur="5.91">this much truth out there are they just</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="3.84">playing with us or actually trying to</text>
  <text start="400.44" dur="3.51">get</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="5.25">soft disclosure I mean literally might</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="3.96">as well just do it man fly your secret</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="5.31">space program ships over all the cities</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="4.89">right just do it man it&amp;#39;s getting to a</text>
  <text start="411.42" dur="4.44">point where seeing all this soft</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="3.83">disclosure just gets my panties in a</text>
  <text start="415.86" dur="4.26">bunch</text>
  <text start="416.63" dur="7.6">next anyway past this I want to move</text>
  <text start="420.12" dur="5.79">into Donald Trump now and the well note</text>
  <text start="424.23" dur="3.09">I put for this one is he better drain</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="3.69">the freaking swamp tune because I tell</text>
  <text start="427.32" dur="4.08">you what looking at all the people on</text>
  <text start="429.6" dur="3.54">the interwebs a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="5.34">getting frustrated because not much</text>
  <text start="433.14" dur="5.73">stuff is happening or big enough stuff</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="4.46">is happening now I understand the</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="7.41">monster he&amp;#39;s trying to deal with is</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="6.55">pretty infectious but again we need</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="5.07">results because I see people starting to</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="5.67">question him and they&amp;#39;re like okay 100</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="3.54">days in now as of tomorrow I believe oh</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="4.92">again side note</text>
  <text start="454.89" dur="6.54">tomorrow&amp;#39;s May 1st May Day and we all</text>
  <text start="458.34" dur="4.77">know I mean me being near Seattle May</text>
  <text start="461.43" dur="4.65">Day is a huge kind of day here because</text>
  <text start="463.11" dur="7.49">of the protests like 15 or 20 years ago</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="7.38">but the Cabal or the deep state or those</text>
  <text start="470.6" dur="5.35">occultists they like they&amp;#39;re a cult</text>
  <text start="473.46" dur="4.23">dates and May 1st is the end of the</text>
  <text start="475.95" dur="4.38">season of sacrifice so they all often</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="4.86">have big events that happen on May 1st</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="5.28">and this coincides with Trump&amp;#39;s hundred</text>
  <text start="482.55" dur="5.73">days so warning just throwing warning</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="4.26">out there there might be some type of</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="5.91">false flag tomorrow just keep your eyes</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="8.15">keep your eyes open for that now anyway</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="6.06">a lot of people start to question his</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="4.78">connections right because we have his</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="6">son-in-law Jared Kushner his connections</text>
  <text start="502.8" dur="7.5">to certain globalists we have this guy</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="6.24">Steve I believe Mugen manechan this is</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="3.54">his treasure Treasury secretary and I</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="6.33">saw a little bit of information</text>
  <text start="513.84" dur="7.38">connecting him to George Soros so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.82" dur="4.02">weird and then we all know Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="521.22" dur="4.7">has been pretty outspoken about</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="5.67">supporting Israel but here&amp;#39;s the thing I</text>
  <text start="525.92" dur="3.82">understand the old adage and it&amp;#39;s often</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="3.42">said you keep your friends close and</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="4.89">enemies closer that could still very</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="5.07">well be a possibility and</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="4.04">also right the reason I&amp;#39;m just throwing</text>
  <text start="537" dur="4.05">this out there is because we can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="4.45">fanboys and fangirls about whom we have</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="4.44">to be discerning at all costs even if</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="3.66">the person that we so hope is in our</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="3.3">presidential seat right now is in there</text>
  <text start="546.78" dur="4.29">to drain the swamp we got to make sure</text>
  <text start="548.79" dur="5.22">that so I&amp;#39;m just putting these out there</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="5.58">to think about to ruminate on and be</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="4.35">discerning of but again kind of along</text>
  <text start="556.65" dur="4.88">the lines I still feel what I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="558.36" dur="5.55">saying about him for weeks is that he is</text>
  <text start="561.53" dur="3.91">playing a game he&amp;#39;s playing a big little</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="3.48">stick against the neocons against the</text>
  <text start="565.44" dur="3.15">globalist in the deep state and what I</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="4.95">think right now he&amp;#39;s doing is buying</text>
  <text start="568.59" dur="5.28">time so he&amp;#39;s a lot of those 180s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.34" dur="3.24">done the past like week or two right</text>
  <text start="573.87" dur="3.99">because he&amp;#39;s basically flipped every</text>
  <text start="575.58" dur="4.32">single stance he said even was quoted as</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="4.29">saying he&amp;#39;s a globalist in a nationalist</text>
  <text start="579.9" dur="5.97">at the same time I think all of those</text>
  <text start="582.15" dur="6.33">flips are just to simply buy time or to</text>
  <text start="585.87" dur="5.37">get some of his enemies a little closer</text>
  <text start="588.48" dur="5.04">to him so he can either find information</text>
  <text start="591.24" dur="3.54">out not him per se but like the Alliance</text>
  <text start="593.52" dur="3.69">or the White House they can find</text>

  <text start="614.85" dur="6.03">the scenes and keep in mind when looking</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="6.36">at everything when looking at everything</text>
  <text start="620.88" dur="7.53">um it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that he&amp;#39;s working</text>

  <text start="638.79" dur="4.41">if you if he was truly a deep stator I</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t think we would see a lot of the</text>

  <text start="646.47" dur="3.84">that March oh the climate March that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.69" dur="3.8">right and then there was the science</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="4.83">March just a week or two ago so a lot of</text>
  <text start="652.49" dur="5.23">funding still going against him if you</text>
  <text start="655.14" dur="5.25">look at you know any corporate media rag</text>
  <text start="657.72" dur="6.9">like CNN or Washington Post it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="660.39" dur="5.88">very blatantly anti Trump and then the</text>
  <text start="664.62" dur="2.91">Hawaii House Correspondents Dinner was</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="2.13">yesterday it was pretty funny because</text>
  <text start="667.53" dur="2.4">Trump was no</text>
  <text start="668.4" dur="4.38">to be seen and there was actually a</text>
  <text start="669.93" dur="4.71">small clip that I saw online of a rally</text>
  <text start="672.78" dur="2.85">he held about a hundred miles away from</text>
  <text start="674.64" dur="3.06">the White House Correspondents Dinner</text>
  <text start="675.63" dur="3.36">last night and he was blatantly calling</text>
  <text start="677.7" dur="3.3">out Hollywood and all the corporate</text>
  <text start="678.99" dur="4.86">media fake news so it was hilarious</text>
  <text start="681" dur="5.22">anyway those are just some thoughts that</text>
  <text start="683.85" dur="5.01">we need to keep in mind about him and I</text>
  <text start="686.22" dur="3.75">got a game plan right Donald Trump if</text>
  <text start="688.86" dur="2.46">you hear me out on this if you watch</text>
  <text start="689.97" dur="4.71">this video</text>
  <text start="691.32" dur="6.74">who needs 4d chess you need to teach s</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="5.76">all you need to do one photos to</text>
  <text start="698.06" dur="5.29">disclose disclose everything zero-point</text>
  <text start="700.44" dur="4.77">energy all the truth boom game over</text>
  <text start="703.35" dur="4.16">who needs 40 chess when you just do two</text>

  <text start="707.51" dur="3.31">secretary of disclosure Donald Trump I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="709.98" dur="4.65">gladly do it</text>
  <text start="710.82" dur="7.74">so 2d game plan and then this one war</text>
  <text start="714.63" dur="4.92">hulking freaking everywhere in this</text>
  <text start="718.56" dur="3.03">point right here in North Korea</text>
  <text start="719.55" dur="3.57">neutralized kind of ties into the Donald</text>
  <text start="721.59" dur="3.18">Trump thing a lot of people are worried</text>
  <text start="723.12" dur="2.94">about World War three had a couple</text>
  <text start="724.77" dur="5.55">people message me and text me this</text>
  <text start="726.06" dur="6.3">morning worried about it but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="4.14">because North Korea again they had</text>
  <text start="732.36" dur="3.87">another missile blow up another</text>
  <text start="734.46" dur="4.32">ballistic missile blow up on a launch</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="3.78">pad that they tried to send off so now</text>
  <text start="738.78" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m getting to the point where I think</text>
  <text start="740.01" dur="4.53">North Korea is a cabal proxy that</text>
  <text start="742.83" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re still trying to use because Isis</text>
  <text start="744.54" dur="4.71">is being neutralized by Donald Trump and</text>
  <text start="746.94" dur="4.11">Putin so now they&amp;#39;re trying to use North</text>
  <text start="749.25" dur="3.27">Korea to start whatever war they can</text>
  <text start="751.05" dur="3.12">North Korea&amp;#39;s being neutralized I</text>
  <text start="752.52" dur="5.13">honestly think that these missiles being</text>
  <text start="754.17" dur="4.68">shot off were either hacked by some</text>
  <text start="757.65" dur="2.7">white hats or there was like a</text>
  <text start="758.85" dur="3.57">directed-energy weapon that might have</text>
  <text start="760.35" dur="3.51">blown him up but I think there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="762.42" dur="2.19">behind-the-scenes stuff going on with</text>
  <text start="763.86" dur="5.01">North Korea</text>
  <text start="764.61" dur="7.05">that&amp;#39;s neutralizing them and more war</text>
  <text start="768.87" dur="3.54">Hawking John the freaking Kane this dude</text>
  <text start="771.66" dur="4.08">just won&amp;#39;t give up</text>
  <text start="772.41" dur="5.67">he was he had an article featured on The</text>
  <text start="775.74" dur="4.44">Washington Post right here on April 27th</text>
  <text start="778.08" dur="4.44">so if he couple days ago but the</text>
  <text start="780.18" dur="4.55">headline says the Balkans are heating up</text>
  <text start="782.52" dur="5.72">in Washington is nowhere to be seen</text>
  <text start="784.73" dur="7.06">maybe cuz we&amp;#39;re sick of war you freaking</text>
  <text start="788.24" dur="5.44">sicko so he&amp;#39;s literally saying that we</text>
  <text start="791.79" dur="6.6">need to get into another war right on</text>
  <text start="793.68" dur="7.23">the CIA media rag of all CIA media rags</text>
  <text start="798.39" dur="3.51">Washington Post so it&amp;#39;s just if you</text>
  <text start="800.91" dur="3.81">understand</text>
  <text start="801.9" dur="4.83">who is funded by who again right ask</text>
  <text start="804.72" dur="4.38">yourself followed money and who benefits</text>
  <text start="806.73" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s blatantly obvious John McCain and</text>
  <text start="809.1" dur="5.61">the you know globalists are just trying</text>
  <text start="812.7" dur="5.34">to foment as much war as they can</text>
  <text start="814.71" dur="5.43">because again I think he&amp;#39;s buying time</text>
  <text start="818.04" dur="5.22">to sweep them up I think we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="820.14" dur="5.19">a nice big sweet very soon but again it</text>
  <text start="823.26" dur="4.98">must be soon because a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="6.89">getting really antsy and then lastly</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="6.15">this point Assange and WikiLeaks here</text>
  <text start="832.22" dur="4.15">just a couple things that I saw the past</text>
  <text start="834.39" dur="4.62">couple days we&amp;#39;re really cool on Ron</text>
  <text start="836.37" dur="5.909">Paul interviewed Julian Assange which</text>
  <text start="839.01" dur="6.18">Ron Paul the only bumper sticker I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="842.279" dur="5.341">ever had my car was of his love him and</text>
  <text start="845.19" dur="4.71">he interviewed Julian Assange and they</text>
  <text start="847.62" dur="4.62">were talking about how the deeply deeply</text>
  <text start="849.9" dur="3.93">humiliated the CIA has been from their</text>
  <text start="852.24" dur="5.099">leaks which is cool you can go check it</text>
  <text start="853.83" dur="8.31">out link it down below and then also</text>
  <text start="857.339" dur="7.411">WikiLeaks disclosed another set of vault</text>
  <text start="862.14" dur="5.19">seven documents this one is called</text>
  <text start="864.75" dur="5.3">scribbles they always have these cute</text>
  <text start="867.33" dur="6.56">names for what they what they leak but</text>
  <text start="870.05" dur="6.039">this one&amp;#39;s called scribbles or</text>
  <text start="873.89" dur="4.9">colloquially it&amp;#39;s called the Snowden</text>
  <text start="876.089" dur="4.261">stopper because it was a CIA tool to</text>
  <text start="878.79" dur="4.11">track whistleblowers they would put an</text>
  <text start="880.35" dur="5.1">imprint on documents so they could find</text>
  <text start="882.9" dur="4.53">out where the documents goes if they</text>
  <text start="885.45" dur="3.57">didn&amp;#39;t want them if they were likely to</text>
  <text start="887.43" dur="3.96">be stolen and they didn&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="889.02" dur="7.95">getting out so is the embedding of a web</text>
  <text start="891.39" dur="7.74">beacon tag precisely and the CIA to</text>
  <text start="896.97" dur="4.83">purportedly recite relies on Microsoft</text>
  <text start="899.13" dur="6.63">Office I didn&amp;#39;t know that I just read</text>
  <text start="901.8" dur="6.09">that two-track leaked documents and the</text>
  <text start="905.76" dur="5.46">whistleblowers that release them so</text>
  <text start="907.89" dur="6.87">again great that they&amp;#39;re disclosing</text>
  <text start="911.22" dur="4.98">stuff but big freakin surprise it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="914.76" dur="5.61">of obvious that they would have some</text>
  <text start="916.2" dur="8.19">type of anti leaked something in the CIA</text>
  <text start="920.37" dur="5.79">and again dude we need some bigger</text>
  <text start="924.39" dur="2.97">disclosures we need some stuff to really</text>
  <text start="926.16" dur="4.22">start ramping up which I think it will</text>
  <text start="927.36" dur="3.02">but again</text>
  <text start="932.25" dur="4.17">but again we need to</text>
  <text start="934.86" dur="6">talk about these things we need to be</text>
  <text start="936.42" dur="6.21">vocal and B we need to really press</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="3.09">these disclosures to come out because</text>
  <text start="942.63" dur="2.4">it&amp;#39;s really up to us to inform our</text>
  <text start="943.95" dur="3.09">friends and family about all this stuff</text>
  <text start="945.03" dur="3.93">so it can come out a whole lot freaking</text>
  <text start="947.04" dur="3.12">easier we can get this ball rolling</text>
  <text start="948.96" dur="3.87">because I&amp;#39;m getting impatient</text>
  <text start="950.16" dur="3.66">you probably tell in my voice and I know</text>
  <text start="952.83" dur="2.49">a lot of people out there getting</text>
  <text start="953.82" dur="4.59">frustrated and impatient that we need</text>
  <text start="955.32" dur="6.36">some higher-level names arrested we need</text>
  <text start="958.41" dur="8.76">some information disclosed brought out</text>
  <text start="961.68" dur="6.6">to humans and yeah so but one point one</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="2.28">last point that I want to make with a</text>
  <text start="968.28" dur="3.18">lot of these points up here with the</text>
  <text start="969.45" dur="5.94">seating consciousness thing I didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="971.46" dur="7.08">to this earlier but interesting point</text>
  <text start="975.39" dur="5.82">has been made before that one reason</text>
  <text start="978.54" dur="6.18">they put a lot of these stories into the</text>
  <text start="981.21" dur="6.66">public domain the the elites do is for a</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="6.27">nefarious reason in the point that if</text>
  <text start="987.87" dur="4.59">they were if a certain sweep if a</text>
  <text start="990.99" dur="4.05">certain mass arrest scenario were to</text>
  <text start="992.46" dur="7.85">begin to take place they could use any</text>
  <text start="995.04" dur="8.37">one of these stories as a way to like</text>
  <text start="1000.31" dur="4.99">blow disclosure outright so it would</text>
  <text start="1003.41" dur="3.72">completely distract everybody from an</text>
  <text start="1005.3" dur="4.5">arrest scenario that&amp;#39;s occurring so say</text>
  <text start="1007.13" dur="5.19">they wanted to use Antarctica right we</text>
  <text start="1009.8" dur="4.38">see so many different we sound like</text>
  <text start="1012.32" dur="4.38">markings on the bed I report on that</text>
  <text start="1014.18" dur="4.23">last video overseeing all kinds of</text>
  <text start="1016.7" dur="4.59">different articles and Antarctica so if</text>
  <text start="1018.41" dur="5.94">they needed an out they would have it</text>
  <text start="1021.29" dur="5.04">kind understand or they could use the</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="6.32">ink of ancient records one or they could</text>
  <text start="1026.33" dur="7.08">use this one right the Saturn&amp;#39;s moon</text>
  <text start="1030.67" dur="6.34">stick so they&amp;#39;re putting all of these</text>
  <text start="1033.41" dur="8.22">out in case they need in case they need</text>
  <text start="1037.01" dur="6.87">a card to play okay and so that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1041.63" dur="4.8">positive you can take from that in that</text>
  <text start="1043.88" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re putting all of these different</text>
  <text start="1046.43" dur="4.35">possible outs in the public domain for</text>
  <text start="1048.95" dur="7.98">themselves because they know their time</text>
