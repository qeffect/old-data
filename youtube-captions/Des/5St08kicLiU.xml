  <text start="18.119" dur="5.311">happenings going on with the air force</text>
  <text start="20.25" dur="5.539">and possibly the secret space program</text>
  <text start="23.43" dur="5.07">kind of behind the scenes of all the</text>
  <text start="25.789" dur="6.07">Syria and war distractions going on</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="6.36">right now and I&amp;#39;m going to take some</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="4.741">whistleblower testimony and link these</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="3.99">certain happenings that are going on to</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="4.01">it and try to paint a clearer picture of</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="4.65">what might be really going on right now</text>
  <text start="40.61" dur="5.109">first I want to show you this right here</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="4.829">now I reported on a few days ago and</text>
  <text start="45.719" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s from the Air Force website itself</text>
  <text start="48.329" dur="4.741">and it says the Air Force announces</text>
  <text start="49.829" dur="7.201">major changes to space enterprise and</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="6.149">this is a very technical news release I</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="5.939">don&amp;#39;t necessarily understand too much of</text>
  <text start="59.219" dur="5.791">what it says but this article that I</text>
  <text start="62.969" dur="3.33">just found in researching for this video</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="4.02">kind of helped lays it out a little bit</text>
  <text start="66.299" dur="4.5">more and this is from April 4th that Air</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="4.26">Force announcement was also April 4th</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="5.761">and this article states in a push to</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="6.54">normalize the space domain Air Force</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="5.699">adds a new three-star position so</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="3.84">basically they&amp;#39;re just kind of like it</text>
  <text start="82.259" dur="4.11">says right here they&amp;#39;re shuffling some</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="4.65">things around to make their space</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="5.161">command a little more streamlined a</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="5.52">little easier keep that in mind right</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;m trying to lay let lay some</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="5.489">perspective for you before we get into</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="4.89">discussing Corey good bill Thompkins and</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="4.741">some other whistleblower testimony that</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="4.86">might explain this right so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="4.259">trying to normal a space the Air Forces</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="4.799">and then as I was watching Jimmy Church</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="3.661">or listening to Jimmy Church last night</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="3.57">his interview he just released with</text>

  <text start="114.149" dur="3.75">check it out</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="7.439">he was discussing this that this article</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="8.82">by the drive here discusses and this</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="6.421">article says on April 6th so just two</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="3.66">days after the Air Force reshuffled</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="4.11">Wright announced they were reshuffling</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="3.431">some things on April 6 as part of the</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="3.46">Pentagon&amp;#39;s daily announced</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="3.69">mint of any contracts worth over seven</text>
  <text start="136.15" dur="3.87">million dollars so they have to announce</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="4.26">these things they don&amp;#39;t necessarily have</text>
  <text start="140.02" dur="5.67">to say where the money goes but in this</text>
  <text start="141.76" dur="6.51">case they did and the airforce revealed</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="5.64">a deal with the URS federal services</text>
  <text start="148.27" dur="6.689">some company out of Maryland for nearly</text>
  <text start="151.33" dur="8.18">two decades of work regarding drones it</text>

  <text start="159.51" dur="11.05">dollar contract for piloting unmanned</text>
  <text start="163.989" dur="8.551">aircraft out of area 51 very interesting</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="3.69">right so under understand these points</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="3.9">Air Force reshuffles around some Space</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="4.44">Command stuff then they announced some</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="6.84">giant contract having to do the drones</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="6.75">and you know out of Nevada Air Force</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="4.2">bases and a bunch of stuff in Utah like</text>
  <text start="185.44" dur="5.22">what the heck is really going on makes</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="5.25">you really scratch your head especially</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="3.72">understanding how it fits into the</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="4.17">bigger picture and that&amp;#39;s what I want to</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="4.77">lay out for you now I want to discuss</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="6.03">some of the testimony that&amp;#39;s come out</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="6.149">regarding the Navy factions of the</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="4.17">secret space program right so I think we</text>
  <text start="205.299" dur="3.451">all know by now about Corey Goode in his</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="4.259">testimony this he&amp;#39;s been you know</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="5.16">discussing since 2014 regarding his</text>
  <text start="211.359" dur="4.561">participation in what&amp;#39;s called the solar</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="3.69">warden now he&amp;#39;s not the first one to</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="4.319">ever mention some solar warden we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="5.49">also had gary mckinnon hacked some NASA</text>
  <text start="220.239" dur="6.59">computers and give some glimpses into</text>
  <text start="223.09" dur="5.76">this project of secretive space programs</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="5.071">but Corey goats really been coming out</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="7.229">for a couple years and discussing it and</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="6.82">not only him but Bill Tompkins is really</text>
  <text start="236.079" dur="5.16">throwing down some data about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="4.169">really gone on with the Navy side of</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="4.351">things right remember there&amp;#39;s Air Force</text>
  <text start="242.889" dur="5.07">now we have Navy and when we get to this</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="3.69">level of compartmentalization in the</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="3.391">secret space programs they&amp;#39;re called</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="6">unacknowledged special access projects</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="5.4">who SEPs right unacknowledged a lot of</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="3.84">the Air Force guys might not necessarily</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="3.84">know what&amp;#39;s going on in the Navy a lot</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="3.09">of people you know over here might not</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="3">know what&amp;#39;s going on over here that this</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="2.639">is the level of compartmentalization</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="3.97">we&amp;#39;re getting into so you got to</text>
  <text start="264.849" dur="5.861">understand perspective is everything</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="4.8">and according to Gauri good when he</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="4.26">started really coming out with the Navy</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="4.8">side a deep deep secret space program</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="5.16">that even surpasses anything the Air</text>
  <text start="277.16" dur="4.08">Force thought they had it kind of pissed</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="2.19">off some guys in the Air Force because</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="3.57">they realized they weren&amp;#39;t the biggest</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="3.89">kids on the block anymore and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="4.609">gonna bring into the picture some</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="6.04">articles by dr. Saleh on EXO politics</text>
  <text start="289.419" dur="6.25">just to help gather the perspective of</text>
  <text start="292.25" dur="5.79">all this Corey Goode was abducted in</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="6.481">early 2016 this was a little over a year</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="7.02">ago by some of these guys within the Air</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="5.37">Force projects and they interrogated him</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="4.14">and they found out holy this guy is</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="6.66">actually telling the truth about solar</text>
  <text start="309.2" dur="8.82">warden and then this caused some serious</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="6">internal issues within the Air Force and</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="3.869">those compartmentalized projects because</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="3.239">they realize now their ego got checked</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="6.061">they weren&amp;#39;t the biggest kids on the</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="7.771">block and after this occurred you know</text>
  <text start="327.95" dur="6.18">this brings us now to just a couple</text>
  <text start="331.19" dur="4.38">months ago we&amp;#39;re not even a couple</text>
  <text start="334.13" dur="3.36">months ago lists about three weeks ago</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="3.599">where dr. Michael Salaam briefed Corey</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.2">Goode again and then released this</text>
  <text start="339.169" dur="5.87">article Air Force officials investigate</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="6.9">claims a secret Navy space program and</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="5.231">apparently the guy that interrogated</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="3.93">Corey good and he&amp;#39;s now having regular</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="4.38">contacts with is called Sigmund we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="352.52" dur="4.019">exactly know who he is he might be you</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="3.329">know one of the names we can pick out in</text>
  <text start="356.539" dur="3.421">the Air Force project maybe not maybe</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="8.131">he&amp;#39;s a you know his name is more</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="7.8">hush-hush but he&amp;#39;s been realizing you</text>
  <text start="366.11" dur="5.429">know getting a lot of info from Corey</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="6.029">good about these Navy projects and what</text>
  <text start="371.539" dur="3.63">we could be seeing remember what Corey</text>
  <text start="373.789" dur="6.061">Goods been telling us and Bill Tompkins</text>
  <text start="375.169" dur="6.301">as well is that various factions in</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="3.9">these secret space programs are vying</text>
  <text start="381.47" dur="3.69">for full disclosure especially the Navy</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="3.69">side of things they&amp;#39;re really vying for</text>
  <text start="385.16" dur="5.879">full disclosure the deep secret space</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="5.81">programs and the Air Force part of the</text>
  <text start="391.039" dur="6.75">secret space program or the military</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="6.789">enteric implies sp these guys could now</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="3.451">I mean we just saw week ago they</text>
  <text start="400.039" dur="3.511">restructured their</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="5.64">space organizations now there&amp;#39;s a giant</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="6.269">project for releasing drone technology</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="4.71">out of area 51 and remember Corey Goode</text>
  <text start="409.819" dur="3.481">in his testimony has said that a lot of</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="3.81">the initial stages of this disclosure</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="4.5">project process are going to involve</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="4.799">drones and first he said these drones</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="3.989">are going to be retrofitted with normal</text>
  <text start="420.199" dur="4.59">propellers and then they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="421.789" dur="5.641">advance to anti-gravity technologies</text>
  <text start="424.789" dur="4.651">well now if the Air Force is running</text>
  <text start="427.43" dur="4.829">drone projects directly out of Nevada</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="5.039">test ranges and area 51 maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="4.861">just skipping that whole propeller</text>
  <text start="434.479" dur="4.47">process and going straight to zero-point</text>
  <text start="437.12" dur="3.9">energy energy and electrogravitic</text>
  <text start="438.949" dur="4.951">technologies to catch up to the Navy</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="5.94">disc avicii chrous base program deeper</text>
  <text start="443.9" dur="5.4">disclosures this I mean I&amp;#39;m just looking</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="7.62">to the future here could be we know</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="7.35">right we can we can do some you know</text>
  <text start="454.58" dur="3.899">pretty easy research and find what kind</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="4.68">of projects we know they have we know</text>
  <text start="458.479" dur="4.741">they have essentially large black</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="4.29">triangles with sometimes they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="3.81">called the tr-3b that work off</text>
  <text start="465.62" dur="3.299">anti-gravity technology they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="3.3">these for quite a while we know you know</text>
  <text start="468.919" dur="2.941">we can take a gander at some of the</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="3.54">projects they have we have bill Tompkins</text>
  <text start="471.86" dur="4.32">that have come has come out saying that</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="6.99">okay yeah they have you know deep space</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="6.06">stuff already and again like I said this</text>
  <text start="480.86" dur="2.52">could very well be the air force trying</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="3.75">to play catch-up I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="6.06">understand that if they don&amp;#39;t get on the</text>
  <text start="485.99" dur="6.72">disclosure train they&amp;#39;re gonna be kind</text>
  <text start="489.44" dur="4.8">of rendered obsolete so I want to lay</text>
  <text start="492.71" dur="5.67">some of this scenario out for you guys</text>
  <text start="494.24" dur="7.229">because you know with all this serious</text>
  <text start="498.38" dur="5.039">stuff going on maybe and I will make</text>
  <text start="501.469" dur="4.561">more videos describing my my views on</text>
  <text start="503.419" dur="6.201">this could this all this war talk could</text>

  <text start="517.099" dur="4.891">talk very well could be that certain</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="6.779">secret space program projects are being</text>
