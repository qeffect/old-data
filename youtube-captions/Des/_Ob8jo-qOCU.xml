  <text start="9.03" dur="2.91">that all that Comedy Central stuff is</text>
  <text start="10.92" dur="3.599">off my chest</text>
  <text start="11.94" dur="4.98">for now and getting back into the swing</text>
  <text start="14.519" dur="5.281">of things I want to do this video on the</text>
  <text start="16.92" dur="5.64">SeaTac stolen plane incident and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="19.8" dur="4.469">start with the official story now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="22.56" dur="3.42">sure you&amp;#39;ve seen it awesome video</text>
  <text start="24.269" dur="4.621">footage out there about this plane</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="6.18">getting jacked from SeaTac Airport in</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="6.12">the evening sunset and basically going</text>
  <text start="32.16" dur="6.11">for a loop de lune crashing into an</text>
  <text start="35.01" dur="6.03">island and the official story is that a</text>
  <text start="38.27" dur="6.039">suicidal mechanic a 29 year old guy</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="6.57">decided to just jack this plane from a</text>
  <text start="44.309" dur="6.27">busy tarmac have enough skills to take</text>
  <text start="47.61" dur="5.49">it off fly it at a low altitude do some</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="5.581">barrel rolls and some pretty good</text>
  <text start="53.1" dur="4.709">maneuvers and then have a cool calm</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="3.6">collected with the air traffic</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="4.5">controllers while he decided to just</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="5.88">crash it into this random remote island</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="5.731">that&amp;#39;s the official story and again I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="65.64" dur="3.99">not buying it so many things don&amp;#39;t add</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="3.96">up don&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="5.239">how was he skilled enough to do these</text>
  <text start="72" dur="5.49">kinds of maneuvers at a low altitude and</text>
  <text start="74.869" dur="4.781">also take it off from a busy tarmac just</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="4.379">being a 29 year old suicidal mechanic</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="4.41">right he was joking with the air traffic</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="4.711">control having a very calm conversation</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.16">while doing these maneuvers and being</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="4.56">suicidal one of the jokes was he was</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="3.87">like hey man why don&amp;#39;t I just you know</text>
  <text start="91.14" dur="4.619">can I get a job if I land this properly</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="4.26">and he&amp;#39;s like I didn&amp;#39;t really know I was</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="3.631">suicidal until just now</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="3.69">you know the audio doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="5">and not only that but it sounded</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="7.05">pre-recorded when you listen to it and</text>
  <text start="104.39" dur="6.729">that begs the question you know could it</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="4.139">have been a of course a pre-recorded</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="2.64">conversation but could have been a</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="4.28">remote-controlled plane was there even</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="5.911">an operator in the plane mind you and</text>
  <text start="116.509" dur="5.201">also I saw a point made somewhere that</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="3.809">in an event like this what should have</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="2.939">happened is that the communications</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="3.271">between the plane and the air traffic</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="5.851">controller should have gone secured so</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="5.879">it was really weird that we could hear</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="3.3">the audio recording and it was really so</text>
  <text start="132.629" dur="3.091">fast after</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="3.45">the incident right and then of course it</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="4.77">crashed on that random island called</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="5.28">Ketron island that I&amp;#39;d never even heard</text>
  <text start="140.49" dur="6.3">of before I&amp;#39;ve lived in this area all my</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="6.23">life and I&amp;#39;ve never came across that</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="4.65">name it didn&amp;#39;t stick out to me so</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="4.66">official story doesn&amp;#39;t add up let&amp;#39;s ask</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="3.72">the question then what really happened</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="3.42">let&amp;#39;s connect the dots and bring some</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="3.42">logical thinking into this picture and</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="6.81">to help do that of course we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="8.09">use Q so Q right here in post 1845 and</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="8.79">46 from August 11th he posts a picture</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="11.22">they post a picture of the aircraft that</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="8.43">was used in that incident it was a q400</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="5.2">Alaska Airlines flight q ass autists</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="6.15">catch the message think missile do you</text>
  <text start="183.09" dur="5.52">believe in coincidences so catch the</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="5.22">message quite obviously it was a plane</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="5.75">that was a Q 400 and I have a photograph</text>
  <text start="192.24" dur="6.02">of the flight flight plan here as well</text>
  <text start="194.36" dur="5.86">dude did a Q over this remote island</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="3.97">before it crashed whether it was a</text>
  <text start="200.22" dur="4.08">operator in the plane or it was</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="3.75">remote-controlled right it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="204.3" dur="4.02">suicidal 29 year old mechanic we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="5.759">dropping that story already so my</text>
  <text start="208.32" dur="4.83">thought is that it was an operator with</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="2.881">a pre-recorded audio tape that was</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="2.7">released to the public or it was</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="4.47">remote-controlled could have been and</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="5.4">then it was just sent to do aq over this</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="4.11">island which isn&amp;#39;t random we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="5.33">about it in a minute and then crash</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="6.27">there so q400 does AQ in the air and</text>
  <text start="226.58" dur="3.58">what other notes do I have about the</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="5.16">oddness</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="8.4">of it all again the audio should have</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="5.85">been broadcast the f-15s were scrambled</text>
  <text start="238.56" dur="2.64">from organ which is really weird it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.48" dur="5.13">really far away</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="7.65">McChord Air Force Base is right there in</text>
  <text start="245.61" dur="4.95">the area and the plane almost you know</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="3.33">kind of flew over it they were actually</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.41">asking him in the audio tape</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="4.8">pre-recorded whatever to land it at</text>
  <text start="254.97" dur="4.199">McCord and he was making up some excuse</text>
  <text start="256.98" dur="4.439">in the audio tape and then crashes on</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="4.56">the island so is weird that the f-15s</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="5.31">weren&amp;#39;t scrambled from McCord they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.729" dur="3.541">right in the area they were scrambled</text>
  <text start="266.729" dur="2.551">from Oregon</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="6.239">and also let&amp;#39;s talk about the pilots</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="8.789">name so the pilots name was released as</text>
  <text start="273.509" dur="6.301">Richard B Russell okay so it was</text>
  <text start="278.069" dur="4.47">released to the general public but</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s just the optics again what does</text>
  <text start="282.539" dur="4.831">that actually mean</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="6.239">so let&amp;#39;s paint the picture here</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="5.669">Richard B Russell that name leads us to</text>
  <text start="290.009" dur="7.171">the USS Richard be Russell sub it was a</text>
  <text start="293.039" dur="6.69">sturgeon class attack submarine and it</text>
  <text start="297.18" dur="5.519">was named after a senator from Georgia</text>
  <text start="299.729" dur="5.881">Richard B Russell well this sub was</text>
  <text start="302.699" dur="5.19">actually decommissioned in Bremerton</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="4.739">Washington now I&amp;#39;m gonna show you a map</text>
  <text start="307.889" dur="5.43">of this whole scenario here so you can</text>
  <text start="310.349" dur="4.171">see where the missile was sent off so</text>
  <text start="313.319" dur="3.331">you can see where the sub was</text>
  <text start="314.52" dur="3.299">decommissioned and where Ketron island</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="3.449">is and all that so let&amp;#39;s go to Google</text>
  <text start="317.819" dur="5.19">Maps right let&amp;#39;s check the area out here</text>
  <text start="320.099" dur="4.141">so first of all the missile let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.009" dur="2.34">actually take a step back and talk about</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="4.38">that missile I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="5.91">mentioned it enough in-depth here so</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="5.4">think missile asked you said here right</text>
  <text start="331.259" dur="5.071">well let&amp;#39;s do that so the missile was</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="4.41">this right here as I&amp;#39;m sure you remember</text>
  <text start="336.33" dur="4.47">a couple months ago now beginning of</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="4.56">June was that missile that was sent off</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="4.049">around Whidbey Island and it was</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="4.169">photographed a lot of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="344.849" dur="7.44">media called it a helicopter or made up</text>
  <text start="347.159" dur="8.701">some BS for the public but really it was</text>
  <text start="352.289" dur="5.19">a missile sent off directed at air for</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="4.89">one Air Force one it was in SAS nation</text>
  <text start="357.479" dur="6">attempt right after that q said reverse</text>
  <text start="360.75" dur="5.52">image search think hack and posted a</text>
  <text start="363.479" dur="6.421">picture of a sub so what that then leads</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="6.09">us to believe if we have the pilots name</text>
  <text start="369.9" dur="6.15">of this stolen SeaTac airplane being</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="5.97">Richard B Russell and the Richard B</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="4.919">Russell was supposedly a decommissioned</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="4.41">sub in Bremerton Washington so back to</text>
  <text start="380.969" dur="5.07">the map this is where that missile was</text>
  <text start="382.74" dur="7.079">sent off photograph was taken from right</text>
  <text start="386.039" dur="6.69">here typical SAP and the camera was</text>
  <text start="389.819" dur="5.011">pointing north so the missile was sent</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="5.67">off from this area now mind you this is</text>
  <text start="394.83" dur="6.15">where Naval Air Station Whidbey is okay</text>
  <text start="398.399" dur="5.281">and na s would be does not</text>
  <text start="400.98" dur="5.94">have missile launch capabilities so</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="7.53">putting the pieces together Q says think</text>
  <text start="406.92" dur="7.8">hack picture of a sub a sub what was was</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="4.62">used to launch that missile okay we had</text>
  <text start="414.72" dur="5.07">a sub used to launch that missile</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="6.33">probably from out here near the Naval</text>
  <text start="419.79" dur="3.6">Air Station to the left of Whidbey</text>
  <text start="422.16" dur="3.18">Island or it could have been between</text>
  <text start="423.39" dur="3.15">Camano Island and Whidbey here this is</text>
  <text start="425.34" dur="4.11">probably the area of the sub this</text>
  <text start="426.54" dur="6.83">general area again photograph was taken</text>
  <text start="429.45" dur="6.63">in this direction so think missile</text>
  <text start="433.37" dur="4.33">probably launched from a sub my thought</text>
  <text start="436.08" dur="3.48">is that it could have been this sub now</text>
  <text start="437.7" dur="6.75">this sub was supposedly decommissioned</text>
  <text start="439.56" dur="7.14">and scrapped in 2003 the Richard B</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="5.43">Russell in Bremerton back to the map</text>
  <text start="446.7" dur="7.68">Bremerton is right here this is</text>
  <text start="449.88" dur="7.59">Bremerton PSNS so they do a lot of ship</text>
  <text start="454.38" dur="5.97">work and then Bangor is right here where</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="7.98">they keep the subs okay keep some</text>
  <text start="460.35" dur="8.91">nuclear subs out there so mind you going</text>
  <text start="465.45" dur="6.72">full circle here okay this sub M could</text>
  <text start="469.26" dur="4.38">have been not scrapped at all could have</text>
  <text start="472.17" dur="1.92">been kept off books or something like</text>
  <text start="473.64" dur="2.67">that</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="4.56">in this area in either Bremerton Bangor</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;ve got Everett over here that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="6.15">another Naval Station so could have get</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="6.84">been kept in some off-the-books area</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="6.96">around here and used for that missile</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="6.51">launch so Q in this plane incident</text>
  <text start="491.76" dur="8.16">saying think missile I&amp;#39;m thinking this</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="6.99">whole plane stolen suicidal dude they</text>
  <text start="499.92" dur="3.84">say stealing it off Sea Tac and flying</text>
  <text start="502.2" dur="4.02">it into an island I think it was a white</text>
  <text start="503.76" dur="5.19">hat operation as either a sort of</text>
  <text start="506.22" dur="4.38">payback for this missile missile</text>
  <text start="508.95" dur="3.45">incident or it could have been to</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="3.629">disable something I&amp;#39;ve seen that Theory</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="5.579">thrown out there but I think it was just</text>
  <text start="514.229" dur="5.131">a grand showing a big old middle finger</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="4.081">from the white hats to the black hats</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="4.59">here and some guys might very well be</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="4.71">laughing their asses off after pulling</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="4.29">this operation but I think it was</text>
  <text start="526.77" dur="4.1">payback for that missile incident and</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="6.53">you can see all the communications here</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="3.9">q400 Q in the air</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="4.51">calling it Richard B Russell probably</text>
  <text start="537.449" dur="4.471">letting us know that that was the sub</text>
  <text start="539.31" dur="5.76">that was used for the missile incident</text>
  <text start="541.92" dur="5.55">and then of course last piece here the</text>
  <text start="545.07" dur="4.709">crashing of this plane into Ketron</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="4.71">island remember Ketron islands so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.779" dur="4.951">go back to the mat Katra island is down</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="5.219">here so this is about yeah what&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="554.73" dur="4.95">sixty miles or so fifty sixty seventy</text>
  <text start="557.399" dur="4.981">miles south of where the missile was</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="4.829">launched this is Ketron down here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="5.389">actually right next to the McChord Air</text>
  <text start="564.509" dur="7.651">Force Base that I mentioned a little</text>
  <text start="567.769" dur="6.701">south southwest of Tacoma and then</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="4.47">Seattle appear so this is Ketron this</text>
  <text start="574.47" dur="3.57">tiny little island and it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="576.63" dur="3.66">pretty remote</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="4.919">once I started looking into it I saw</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="6.599">that a ferry only goes there twice a day</text>
  <text start="582.959" dur="6.451">I think and there isn&amp;#39;t much on there</text>
  <text start="586.889" dur="7.26">just a couple roads that are admitted on</text>
  <text start="589.41" dur="6.75">Google Maps and pretty much nothing else</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="4.201">we can go to the satellite view you can</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="4.83">see those houses where the ferry comes</text>
  <text start="598.35" dur="4.919">in there&amp;#39;s kind of this looks like</text>
  <text start="600.99" dur="6.38">abandoned ship and some abandoned cars</text>
  <text start="603.269" dur="6.991">it&amp;#39;s kind of odd right so Ketron Island</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="6.699">what some people are connecting that to</text>
  <text start="610.26" dur="7.829">is it could be some kind of ëletís</text>
  <text start="614.069" dur="8.01">hangout or deep state just area forest</text>
  <text start="618.089" dur="5.971">you know people are noticing how Ketron</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="4.38">Island is very close to another island</text>
  <text start="624.06" dur="6.24">called McNeil Island McNeil Island is</text>
  <text start="626.459" dur="8.451">actually a housing for sexual predators</text>
  <text start="630.3" dur="7.019">there&amp;#39;s a holding facility on here for</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="4.539">felons that have done those kinds of</text>
  <text start="637.319" dur="6.75">things and not only that but Ketron</text>
  <text start="639.449" dur="7.2">Island is home to what&amp;#39;s called clip the</text>
  <text start="644.069" dur="7.32">children&amp;#39;s long-term impatient mental</text>
