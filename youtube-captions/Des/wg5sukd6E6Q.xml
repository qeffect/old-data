  <text start="9.65" dur="3.43">what&amp;#39;s up ladies and gentlemen and</text>
  <text start="11.61" dur="5.009">welcome to another edition of whiteboard</text>
  <text start="13.08" dur="5.43">Wednesday&amp;#39;s whiteboard everyday and in</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="4.41">this edition what I&amp;#39;m gonna discuss with</text>
  <text start="18.51" dur="4.65">you is the science of DNA activation now</text>
  <text start="21.029" dur="3.99">if you haven&amp;#39;t seen my science of</text>
  <text start="23.16" dur="4.14">Ascension video that I released a couple</text>
  <text start="25.019" dur="4.531">days ago go check that out because what</text>
  <text start="27.3" dur="3.899">I do in that video is outline the</text>
  <text start="29.55" dur="4.25">geometries that are happening on a</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="4.86">cosmic scale and what that&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="33.8" dur="5.259">basically what that&amp;#39;s changing in our</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="4.381">universe right now and along with the</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="3.75">law of Correspondence right that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="40.44" dur="3.75">as above concept I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="42.809" dur="3.331">DNA I&amp;#39;m gonna get down to the nitty</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="4.56">little gritty here and talk about the so</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="3.899">below concept so that ascension video</text>
  <text start="48.75" dur="3.149">outlined the changes on a grand scale</text>
  <text start="50.039" dur="5.61">this video is gonna outline the changes</text>
  <text start="51.899" dur="5.131">on a small scale here so we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="3.75">into DNA activation I&amp;#39;m gonna try to</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="4.38">make this video basically half of a</text>
  <text start="59.399" dur="3.96">lesson on DNA the most people don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="4.41">right what schools don&amp;#39;t teach us and</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="3.931">then half of a lesson on holistic health</text>
  <text start="65.82" dur="4.38">because I&amp;#39;m really just gonna show you</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="5.79">how to optimize your body-mind-spirit</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="5.419">concept complex with some ideas that</text>
  <text start="73.08" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;ve just gathered over the years now</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="4.901">first we&amp;#39;re gonna get into the geometry</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="6.87">of DNA and I&amp;#39;m gonna put up a screenshot</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="6.09">of a 2d cross section of DNA just look</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="3.78">at this you can like look straight into</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="3.27">it and just let it hypnotize you and I</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="3.269">like activates your pineal in the</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="3.419">process it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s freaking beautiful and</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="5.491">you can see all the sacred geometric</text>
  <text start="93.299" dur="6.901">patterns that are around it and now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="6.24">gonna show you a 3d version of DNA so</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="6.93">when you take that cross section and</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="6.93">then you spin it through space you get</text>
  <text start="107.13" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s called a fractal tesseract right</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re testing your spectacular</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="5.31">vernacular today fractal tesseract and</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;ma throw up anything in green here are</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="5.19">my references so this is my pibbly</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="4.199">ography in green GW Harden I&amp;#39;m gonna put</text>
  <text start="122.43" dur="6.419">it up put up an article where he talks</text>
  <text start="124.049" dur="7.291">about the 3d component of DNA right now</text>
  <text start="128.849" dur="4.801">what this basically leads us to when we</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="4.289">look at the sacred geometrical</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="5.429">two dimensional aspect of our DNA and</text>
  <text start="135.629" dur="7.351">then rotate it into a vortex in 3d space</text>
  <text start="139.079" dur="5.67">that gives us basically a compression</text>
  <text start="142.98" dur="4.589">antenna okay</text>
  <text start="144.749" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s what our DNA is our DNA is an</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="4.2">antenna that connects basically our</text>
  <text start="149.639" dur="5.701">physical reality to our metaphysical</text>
  <text start="151.769" dur="7.62">reality and what I say it does is that</text>
  <text start="155.34" dur="5.7">it converts what we call gravity because</text>
  <text start="159.389" dur="3.151">again watch that ascension video because</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="3.33">I kind of redefined what gravity is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.54" dur="2.699">it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a pole it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="2.489">inward force</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s the implosion force and</text>
  <text start="166.859" dur="6.3">electromagnetism or radiation is the</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="5.73">outward force yin and yang whenever you</text>
  <text start="173.159" dur="3.54">get thrown off of a vibration you have</text>
  <text start="175.469" dur="3.931">to have a counteracting force that</text>
  <text start="176.699" dur="5.13">brings you back to it so we essentially</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.459">have DNA acting as that antenna and then</text>
  <text start="181.829" dur="9.87">in the process of converting the I wrote</text>
  <text start="184.859" dur="9.66">yin again they&amp;#39;re not be so going from</text>
  <text start="191.699" dur="4.02">yin to yang creates bio photons in the</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="2.761">process and you can look into the work</text>
  <text start="195.719" dur="3.63">of Fritz Albert pop here who is very</text>
  <text start="197.28" dur="5.489">popular I&amp;#39;ll link an article down below</text>
  <text start="199.349" dur="7.2">called is DNA the X the next Internet by</text>
  <text start="202.769" dur="6.661">a guy who lit who discusses a lot of his</text>
  <text start="206.549" dur="6.12">work and what he does showing that our</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="5.459">DNA actually emits photons and our DNA</text>
  <text start="212.669" dur="6.391">repelled repairs itself through a</text>
  <text start="214.889" dur="6.12">process called photo repair and this in</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="4.289">black here is my theory so I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="221.009" dur="5.13">that DNA acts as a fractal antenna that</text>
  <text start="223.349" dur="4.95">connects us to the torsion field if you</text>
  <text start="226.139" dur="6.93">want to call it the field of spin or the</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="6.9">source or call it you know space-time</text>
  <text start="233.069" dur="4.29">call it the ether a lot of scientists</text>
  <text start="235.199" dur="4.831">call it that right like nikola tesla for</text>
  <text start="237.359" dur="4.921">instance or i like to throw this one in</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="4.439">there call it god that one you know</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="3.269">ruffles some people&amp;#39;s feathers because</text>
  <text start="244.469" dur="3.36">they don&amp;#39;t think of it that way but</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s in my opinion how you have to</text>
  <text start="247.829" dur="5.34">think of it so that&amp;#39;s what DNA is DNA</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="5.75">right using geometry to geometry as gods</text>
  <text start="253.169" dur="7.47">math connects us to that divine field</text>
  <text start="256.519" dur="6.4">now understanding this understanding you</text>
  <text start="260.639" dur="4.741">know what it is in us we then go into</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="4.171">junk DNA now what is junk DNA</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="3.39">well again</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="5.67">and conventional science is a little</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="6.78">lost so only 3% of our DNA is actually</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="6.78">used to create proteins that then make</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="6">our flesh suits or meet suits right 97</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="3.93">percent of that DNA conventional science</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.23">has no idea what it does and they call</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="5.46">it literally junk right they act like</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s just trash as a as if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="6.72">frickin accident right they basically</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="6.18">act like idiots now what some scientists</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="3.39">some Russian and I believe English</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="3.57">scientists have actually done it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.04" dur="3.27">always the Russians right that have the</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="4.89">really cool science that just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="6.41">get exposed in the West which is really</text>
  <text start="305.79" dur="5.31">interesting right blame the Russians</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="5.02">they have shown that there&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="311.1" dur="7.379">language in our DNA right so when you</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="6.84">take the I believe what is it ca T and G</text>
  <text start="318.479" dur="6.331">or whatever codons those are and</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="8.339">actually apply certain syntax and</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="6.9">grammatical rhythm to it it forms a sort</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="5.341">of actual language in our DNA it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="4.59">freaking nuts and I will link an article</text>
  <text start="334.26" dur="3.81">down below go check it out so what does</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="4.26">this tell us right well we have an</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="5.13">antenna we have an antenna that connects</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="5.94">us to this all-pervasive field that has</text>
  <text start="343.2" dur="5.91">a language in it so essentially you</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="5.729">could say junk DNA is the part of that</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="5.7">antenna that accesses that higher-self</text>
  <text start="352.229" dur="5.581">that accesses that metaphysical part of</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="4.979">us DNA is the antenna our pineal gland</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="7.47">is the receiver remember a pineal gland</text>
  <text start="359.789" dur="7.411">our third eye right here so that is the</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="4.859">half of this video that I wanted to</text>
  <text start="367.2" dur="4.89">portray to you right just understanding</text>
  <text start="370.139" dur="4.111">just the application of this</text>
  <text start="372.09" dur="4.56">consciousness in your brain connect so</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="5.099">many dots and it awakens you right boom</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="4.889">your being right enlightened right now</text>
  <text start="379.349" dur="3.57">with information because you are a being</text>
  <text start="381.539" dur="3.721">of light and funny enough this dude</text>
  <text start="382.919" dur="4.021">professor fritz Albert pop he&amp;#39;s quoted</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="3.69">as saying we know today man is</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="3.3">essentially a being of light so BAM</text>
  <text start="388.95" dur="3.81">there you are</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="5.1">understand that all the spiritual gurus</text>
  <text start="392.76" dur="4.709">were trying to show you this they did</text>
  <text start="395.34" dur="5.61">not want you to worship them they were</text>
  <text start="397.469" dur="5.551">just they were just received</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="4.5">they were conduits per se of this</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="3.6">information and most scientists right</text>
  <text start="405.45" dur="2.67">you hear stories the scientists</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="4.5">literally downloading their information</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="5.64">they got it from the Akashic records or</text>
  <text start="411.12" dur="4.95">the all-pervasive field so really you</text>
  <text start="413.76" dur="4.53">could simply say those either scientific</text>
  <text start="416.07" dur="4.29">prophets or spiritual prophets we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="5.88">simply able to access the parts of their</text>
  <text start="420.36" dur="7.98">DNA that connected to the higher self or</text>
  <text start="424.17" dur="7.26">that conscious field boom mind blown</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.41">okay now I want to get into the next</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="2.58">part of this video and this just makes</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="4.65">me really excited to show you guys</text>
  <text start="434.01" dur="5.07">because I call this my health fractal</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="3.42">now I used to work at a chiropractic</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="3.78">clinic for a few months as an assistant</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="3.6">and I talked people about you know their</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="2.97">posture and whatnot but I would have a</text>
  <text start="444.42" dur="3.33">lot of downtime to just kind of sit</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="4.11">there and I would like jot down ideas I</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="3.48">had these grand plans and becoming like</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="3.78">a health coach or something like that I</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="4.26">still do some of that but I just jotted</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="2.79">this down I called it my health fractal</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="2.43">and I thought it was like the coolest</text>
  <text start="456.51" dur="4.02">little thing and since we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="457.92" dur="5.25">about DNA being a fractal in my opinion</text>
  <text start="460.53" dur="4.41">what a lot of people don&amp;#39;t do especially</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="3.96">in the New Age or spiritual communities</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="5.04">was really get down to business of well</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="4.92">how do I activate my DNA you have to do</text>
  <text start="469.98" dur="3.57">it through your whole body mind spirit</text>
  <text start="472.05" dur="4.41">complex and I find when a lot of people</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="5.31">think about DNA activation they think</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s some like magic concept that just</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="5.01">comes to them when it happens but you</text>
  <text start="481.08" dur="4.77">know in my opinion you have to work for</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="4.35">it you have to have the discipline to</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="5.4">look at all aspects of yourself and</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="6.15">balance it so you know it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="6.45">some hippy dippy concept I&amp;#39;m just kind</text>
  <text start="494.37" dur="4.86">of a nuts-and-bolts kind of guy now when</text>
  <text start="497.7" dur="3.45">you get into this health fractal what I</text>
  <text start="499.23" dur="5.88">did is I took each aspect I took the</text>
  <text start="501.15" dur="6.12">body-mind-spirit aspect and then I cut</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="4.53">it off so we have when you look at your</text>
  <text start="507.27" dur="5.04">body right because you have to you have</text>
  <text start="509.64" dur="4.64">to feed yourself right you have to move</text>
  <text start="512.31" dur="4.919">right breathe right if you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="514.28" dur="5.319">tune that DNA properly you have to keep</text>
  <text start="517.229" dur="4.321">yourself healthy and as energetic as</text>
  <text start="519.599" dur="3.781">possible so we have body mind spirit</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="4.65">body breaks down into physical and</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="4.53">physiological your physical involves</text>
  <text start="526.2" dur="4.32">your posture in your movement basically</text>
  <text start="527.91" dur="4.68">how you hold yourself standing and then</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="4.17">how all of your muscles then work</text>
  <text start="532.59" dur="4.71">together when motion is in</text>
  <text start="534.69" dur="6.149">so you know I mean probably a lot of</text>
  <text start="537.3" dur="5.43">people watching these videos you have to</text>
  <text start="540.839" dur="3.721">I mean in this day and age spend a lot</text>
  <text start="542.73" dur="3.99">of freaking time at the computer like</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="3.329">relearning everything so I&amp;#39;m pretty sure</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="3.419">a lot of people watching this video have</text>
  <text start="547.889" dur="3.781">pretty bad posture I mean it&amp;#39;s taken me</text>
  <text start="550.139" dur="5.581">years to undo but you have to make sure</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="5.339">your muscular balances basically when it</text>
  <text start="555.72" dur="2.82">comes to your body everything is</text>
  <text start="557.009" dur="2.64">balanced so all the muscular imbalances</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="3.12">around your shoulder girdle around your</text>
  <text start="559.649" dur="4.86">hips especially red your neck everything</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="5.219">like that so make sure you sit right and</text>
  <text start="564.509" dur="4.44">move right - right</text>
  <text start="566.879" dur="3.96">let me get in the physiological aspect</text>
  <text start="568.949" dur="4.801">of our body and I broke this down into</text>
  <text start="570.839" dur="5.761">diet and lifestyle basically you could</text>
  <text start="573.75" dur="6.87">also think of this as like nutrition and</text>
  <text start="576.6" dur="7.739">detoxification dr. max Gerson I do want</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="6.63">to put in here is a good guy for y&amp;#39;all</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="5.011">to check out in my green bibliography</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="3.509">color max Gerson nutrition</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="4.169">detoxification so take a look at your</text>
  <text start="590.759" dur="4.38">diet there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that I can</text>
  <text start="593.519" dur="3.81">tell you there whether we get down to</text>
  <text start="595.139" dur="4.351">metabolic typing biochemical need about</text>
  <text start="597.329" dur="6.961">individuality you obviously want to</text>
  <text start="599.49" dur="6.269">avoid GMOs avoid all of the toxic</text>
  <text start="604.29" dur="2.82">processed foods all the artificial</text>

  <text start="608.97" dur="7.229">put in the junk they call food these</text>
  <text start="613.29" dur="4.859">days not even food and then a good a</text>
  <text start="616.199" dur="5.841">good acronym I just want to pass along</text>
  <text start="618.149" dur="7.321">to you guys and this one is Jeff dude</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="5.68">it&amp;#39;s really simple when you eat just eat</text>
  <text start="625.47" dur="5.52">real food that&amp;#39;s what Jeff stands for so</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="5.219">people overcomplicate dieting but as</text>
  <text start="630.99" dur="3.539">long as you inform yourself about the</text>
  <text start="632.939" dur="4.62">basics and then don&amp;#39;t get caught up in</text>
  <text start="634.529" dur="4.86">like fad diets you&amp;#39;re good there then we</text>
  <text start="637.559" dur="3.96">come to the mind and I really broke this</text>
  <text start="639.389" dur="3.87">down into just the mental aspect and</text>
  <text start="641.519" dur="3.93">emotional aspect of who you are and</text>
  <text start="643.259" dur="6.68">balance is key right so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="645.449" dur="8.01">the mental state you want to essentially</text>
  <text start="649.939" dur="6.281">what I would say is stress and distress</text>
  <text start="653.459" dur="4.86">your mind so you want to apply your</text>
  <text start="656.22" dur="4.409">mental state and learn as much as you</text>
  <text start="658.319" dur="3.931">can use that left brain side of you but</text>
  <text start="660.629" dur="3.57">you also want to use the right brain you</text>
  <text start="662.25" dur="4.649">want to hone your intuition and this is</text>
  <text start="664.199" dur="4.261">when creativity is key and what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="666.899" dur="3.511">sad is that</text>
  <text start="668.46" dur="5.069">that chicken scratch what&amp;#39;s really sad</text>
  <text start="670.41" dur="8.989">is that in our society we are so freakin</text>
  <text start="673.529" dur="5.87">left brained from just academia and</text>
  <text start="679.49" dur="5.469">might be primarily education and</text>
  <text start="681.839" dur="5.341">academia but the state of just how most</text>
  <text start="684.959" dur="3.391">people live and then the environments</text>
  <text start="687.18" dur="3.45">that they get their children to pass</text>
  <text start="688.35" dur="4.739">down to it&amp;#39;s just our culture is so left</text>
  <text start="690.63" dur="3.09">brained and culture is so valued in our</text>
  <text start="693.089" dur="2.911">schools</text>
  <text start="693.72" dur="3.869">i&amp;#39;ma not many years about ten years out</text>
  <text start="696" dur="3.39">of high school but they tried to drill</text>
  <text start="697.589" dur="3.87">culture into our heads and I&amp;#39;m realizing</text>
  <text start="699.39" dur="3.33">now that that was I mean we</text>
  <text start="701.459" dur="3.031">have to bring back creativity into the</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="4.26">picture our right brains right I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="704.49" dur="5.84">really right brain so I&amp;#39;m like opposite</text>
  <text start="706.98" dur="5.609">in this regard but you know Duchess me</text>
  <text start="710.33" dur="3.699">but do things do things that bring</text>
  <text start="712.589" dur="2.161">creativity back in fiction that could be</text>
  <text start="714.029" dur="2.791">anything</text>
  <text start="714.75" dur="6.029">you could sing you could paint you could</text>
  <text start="716.82" dur="6.09">dance I even I classify sport into the</text>
  <text start="720.779" dur="4.771">mix I play soccer so that&amp;#39;s big creative</text>
  <text start="722.91" dur="4.049">release for me is just going to play and</text>
  <text start="725.55" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s almost like I consider that a</text>
  <text start="726.959" dur="5.221">meditation for myself so boom meditation</text>
  <text start="729.51" dur="4.5">that could be your how you connect with</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="4.47">your intuitive self a little bit more so</text>
  <text start="734.01" dur="6.12">but anyway you find what works for you</text>
  <text start="736.65" dur="5.189">you do you and now spirit so we got body</text>
  <text start="740.13" dur="5.52">we got mine and we got spirit and the</text>
  <text start="741.839" dur="6.541">spirit component of it I took this from</text>
  <text start="745.65" dur="6.629">Paul check which I recommend all of you</text>
  <text start="748.38" dur="8.1">go check out he is an absolute holistic</text>
  <text start="752.279" dur="7.171">health body mind spirit soul guru he had</text>
  <text start="756.48" dur="6.06">an idea called the eye we all and you</text>
  <text start="759.45" dur="5.19">basically try to honor each was one of</text>
  <text start="762.54" dur="3.989">these you honor them with specific core</text>
  <text start="764.64" dur="4.699">values that you set your set for</text>
  <text start="766.529" dur="5.731">yourself and you try to honor you right</text>
  <text start="769.339" dur="5.651">self-care self-love a lot of people must</text>
  <text start="772.26" dur="5.1">feel bad for not putting themselves in</text>
  <text start="774.99" dur="4.349">situations that don&amp;#39;t serve them or they</text>
  <text start="777.36" dur="4.44">feel there&amp;#39;s so much guilt in our</text>
  <text start="779.339" dur="6.511">society people feel guilty for like</text>
  <text start="781.8" dur="6.51">everything but sometimes I say there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="785.85" dur="4.83">difference between self-centeredness and</text>
  <text start="788.31" dur="4.95">selfishness right self-centeredness you</text>
  <text start="790.68" dur="5.219">have to be self-centered because what</text>
  <text start="793.26" dur="5.61">was it know thyself write written on the</text>
  <text start="795.899" dur="5.551">temple of Delphi in Greece you have to</text>
  <text start="798.87" dur="3.18">know thyself and be centered around</text>
  <text start="801.45" dur="3.6">yourself</text>
  <text start="802.05" dur="7.77">grounded in who you are to write not be</text>
  <text start="805.05" dur="6.45">walked on but if you&amp;#39;re selfish and</text>
  <text start="809.82" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re serving yourself instead of</text>
  <text start="811.5" dur="3.72">serving others well big difference so I</text>
  <text start="813.24" dur="4.02">often make a important distinction</text>
  <text start="815.22" dur="3.57">between the two so we have the I the we</text>
  <text start="817.26" dur="3">which is like your friends and family</text>
  <text start="818.79" dur="4.77">who&amp;#39;s close to you who you interact with</text>
  <text start="820.26" dur="4.98">could be business partners anybody who</text>
  <text start="823.56" dur="4.35">you have direct relationship to you want</text>
  <text start="825.24" dur="4.65">to serve them as best you can again</text>
  <text start="827.91" dur="5.01">without being a doormat do no harm but</text>

  <text start="841.11" dur="4.919">I put whatever bring thoughts I have out</text>
  <text start="843.899" dur="4.261">there because that&amp;#39;s what we need these</text>
  <text start="846.029" dur="4.531">dates were in a absence of good ideas</text>
  <text start="848.16" dur="4.169">and absence of consciousness so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="850.56" dur="2.519">what I do you do whatever you want to do</text>
  <text start="852.329" dur="2.161">maybe you paint</text>

  <text start="871.26" dur="4.86">this as well I&amp;#39;m still diving into it</text>
  <text start="874.38" dur="2.579">and trying to understand it I mean</text>
  <text start="876.12" dur="3.959">that&amp;#39;s a great thing about doing these</text>
  <text start="876.959" dur="5.101">videos and what for instance like the</text>
  <text start="880.079" dur="4.231">law have one blog one spiritual</text>
  <text start="882.06" dur="4.26">teachings have said if you we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="884.31" dur="4.62">here on this planet to teach and learn I</text>
  <text start="886.32" dur="4.62">learn a ton when I make these</text>
  <text start="888.93" dur="3.87">videos because I study this right now</text>

  <text start="898.5" dur="3.899">anything to feed off of so I study a lot</text>
  <text start="900.69" dur="4.32">for this and then I teach it to you guys</text>
  <text start="902.399" dur="4.141">and if I&amp;#39;m wrong in any of this I do get</text>
  <text start="905.01" dur="4.079">called out and I humble myself and say</text>
  <text start="906.54" dur="4.59">even wrong so really teaching and</text>
  <text start="909.089" dur="3.981">learning boom that&amp;#39;s how you come to</text>
  <text start="911.13" dur="4.05">understanding is doing both of them and</text>
  <text start="913.07" dur="5.62">these guys have done a lot of learning</text>
