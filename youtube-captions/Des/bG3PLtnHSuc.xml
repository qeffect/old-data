  <text start="13.349" dur="4.35">this age of information and this age of</text>
  <text start="16.049" dur="4.8">whistleblowers we&amp;#39;re having so many</text>
  <text start="17.699" dur="4.531">people come to light and reporting on</text>
  <text start="20.849" dur="3.211">the corruption that&amp;#39;s gone on in the</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="3.949">upper echelons of you know our</text>
  <text start="24.06" dur="4.679">governmental and corporate systems and</text>
  <text start="26.179" dur="3.88">every single topic you could think about</text>
  <text start="28.739" dur="3.481">whether it&amp;#39;s corruption within the</text>

  <text start="38.34" dur="3.089">zero-point energy like every single</text>
  <text start="39.989" dur="2.491">topic it&amp;#39;s just getting blown wide open</text>
  <text start="41.429" dur="3.27">so it&amp;#39;s awesome</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="4.8">and what I wanted to do is shine some</text>
  <text start="44.699" dur="5.191">limelight in this video on the topic of</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="3.989">all of the Dead holistic doctors that</text>
  <text start="49.89" dur="3.899">we&amp;#39;ve had over the past year and a half</text>
  <text start="51.269" dur="4.261">to two years and Aaron at health-nut</text>
  <text start="53.789" dur="4.14">News has done a fantastic job reporting</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="5.969">on this past couple years she is uh dr.</text>
  <text start="57.929" dur="4.801">Mercola &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s better half and she&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="61.499" dur="2.461">a great job shining the light on this</text>
  <text start="62.73" dur="2.459">stuff and I just want a report about it</text>
  <text start="63.96" dur="3.03">even a little bit more in case any of</text>
  <text start="65.189" dur="3.241">you guys weren&amp;#39;t quite aware of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="5.03">gone on and all the skullduggery</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="4.74">associated with it so it really began in</text>
  <text start="72.02" dur="3.34">2015</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="4.86">mid 2015 we there was a doctor that</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="4.41">passed away he was found with a shot a</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="4.61">gunshot to his chest it was doctor</text>
  <text start="79.77" dur="7.59">Bradstreet and this guy was a very</text>
  <text start="82.64" dur="7.57">renowned vaccine researcher what he was</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="4.89">doing was actually he helped over a</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="5.22">thousand patients with what with what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="5.789">called the GcMAF protein this is a</text>
  <text start="95.43" dur="4.35">protein that&amp;#39;s like a it&amp;#39;s like an</text>
  <text start="98.039" dur="3.18">immunotherapy it actually strengthens</text>
  <text start="99.78" dur="3.93">your immune system and he was using it</text>
  <text start="101.219" dur="6.9">with a lot of different patients he was</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="6.899">found at the shot his chest now what I</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="4.53">believe you know beyond a shadow of a</text>
  <text start="110.609" dur="4.521">doubt in my mind is that he obviously</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="5.341">was suppressed but with this</text>
  <text start="115.13" dur="5.32">immunotherapy what I think happened is</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="4.64">that Big Pharma wanted to suppress it</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="4.44">because they wanted their own</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="3.849">pharmaceutically funded immunotherapies</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="3.539">on the market the ones that are really</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="4.111">expensive that are coming on the market</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="3.991">to take over chemotherapy because people</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="4.18">came are waking up to how bad chemo and</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="6.82">radiation is so pharma is</text>
  <text start="134.77" dur="6.48">their own immunotherapy avenues of</text>
  <text start="139.24" dur="3.6">cancer targeting and they want all the</text>
  <text start="141.25" dur="3.18">other ones that aren&amp;#39;t on their payroll</text>
  <text start="142.84" dur="3.08">suppressed so that&amp;#39;s what they did in</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="3.66">his case and that&amp;#39;s what they did and</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="4.15">probably a few of the other cases of</text>
  <text start="148.09" dur="4.41">these holistic doctors now throughout</text>
  <text start="150.07" dur="6.8">the rest of 2015 and the rest of 2016 we</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="6.6">also saw many more mysterious deaths and</text>
  <text start="156.87" dur="5.61">many of them were not only working with</text>
  <text start="159.1" dur="6.21">this GcMAF protein but they were also</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="6.25">according to reports some of them began</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="6.03">finding how various vaccines were</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="5.21">infected intentionally infected with a</text>
  <text start="171.34" dur="5.19">cancer-causing enzyme called nag Alize</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="4.6">nag Alize is produced in all of our</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="3.96">bodies by cancer cells so when we have a</text>
  <text start="178.54" dur="4.52">cancerous cell it produces this enzyme</text>
  <text start="180.49" dur="5.96">that suppresses our immune system and</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="5.47">many of these holistic doctors were</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="5.08">probably trying to blow the whistle on</text>
  <text start="188.53" dur="4.65">what they found out here and we&amp;#39;re then</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="3.57">targeted by the pharmaceutical industry</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="5.61">so we had the pharmaceutical industry</text>
  <text start="195.1" dur="5.4">targeting the doctors that were trying</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="2.73">to blow the whistle on the suppression</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="2.31">of the immune system but also the</text>
  <text start="201.52" dur="4.11">doctors that we&amp;#39;re trying to help people</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="5.81">build up their immune system so I mean</text>
  <text start="205.63" dur="5.7">we quite literally have our Big Pharma</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="4.33">suppressing the health right there</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="3.18">because remember there&amp;#39;s no money in a</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="3.21">healthy person there&amp;#39;s no money in a</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="4.35">dead person there&amp;#39;s only money in sick</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="4.23">people so it&amp;#39;s the old adage of our sick</text>
  <text start="218.86" dur="3">care system and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="4.02">trying to do keep people sick by</text>
  <text start="221.86" dur="4.53">suppressing all the researchers all the</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="4.37">evidence all the science that will help</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="4.53">people realize their full potential</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="3.91">happens to all the right how does the</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="3.75">all the researchers that try to help</text>
  <text start="232.69" dur="4.11">humanity not only the vaccine and cancer</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="5.07">researchers but the zero point energy</text>
  <text start="236.8" dur="6">researchers right the I mean scientists</text>
  <text start="239.74" dur="5.46">in every field so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s absurd which</text>
  <text start="242.8" dur="3.99">is why I really want to report on the</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="3.69">suppression of all the stuff that&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="3.78">on because we have to we have to look at</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="3.21">it we have to see the reality of the</text>
  <text start="250.57" dur="3.33">situation to then you know hopefully</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;ll piss off some people enough to</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="6.47">start making a difference and yeah</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="7.29">throughout 2015 2016 and even up to now</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="6.37">the age of autism editor the editor of</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="3.96">the age of autism website fantastic Yael</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="2.97">trained and</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="4.43">native researcher his name was Dan</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="5.16">Holmes did he was found dead and</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="5.17">authorities have yet to comment on his</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="5.25">cause of death as of the end of January</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="5.46">a couple months month ago just about a</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="5.31">month ago so so many of them died under</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="4.62">mysterious circumstances and I even want</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="4.56">to point out a couple more people in</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="7.13">this video a couple more very mysterious</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="8.58">instances of how weird these deaths are</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="5.679">so we had brass Street in mid-2015</text>
  <text start="298.57" dur="4.86">also in mid-2015 we had another doctor</text>
  <text start="300.639" dur="4.141">named dr. Nicholas Gonzalez he the</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="3.15">interview he did literally right before</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="3.78">his death he said the P thought Big</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="4.05">Pharma wanted hit you get wanted him to</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="4.44">get hit by a truck so he knew they were</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="5.88">out for him no question in my mind that</text>
  <text start="313" dur="6.66">his death was not accidental September</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="5.159">2015 a man named dr. Mitch Gaynor was</text>
  <text start="319.66" dur="4.879">found dead and it was ruled again a</text>
  <text start="321.669" dur="6.511">suicide right they all get suicided and</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="5.35">he was actually on Russia today not long</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="4.739">before his death and right after his</text>
  <text start="329.889" dur="5.701">death the co-founder of Russia today was</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="4.321">found dead in a Washington DC hotel I</text>
  <text start="335.59" dur="2.82">don&amp;#39;t know if you remember that that was</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="3.12">kind of a big story that blew up in the</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="4.289">mainstream but right before that Russian</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="4.2">Today co-founder was found dead they</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="5.431">interviewed this doctor who was probably</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="4.919">a you know maybe one of the reasons can</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="3.45">all speculate here butts maybe one of</text>
  <text start="349.479" dur="4.171">the reasons that that Russia Today</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="4.2">co-founder was found dead so anyway that</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="6.06">was weird weird circumstantial things</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="6.24">there January 2016 in my home state here</text>
  <text start="359.71" dur="5.459">a man named dr. John Marshall was found</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="6.06">dead floating in the Spokane River he</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="5.22">was a fourth generation Marine trained</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="5.07">in survival skills in a very fit man and</text>
  <text start="370.389" dur="4.381">somehow authorities said that yeah he</text>
  <text start="373.15" dur="4.73">must have slipped into the river and</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="7.56">died by accident it&amp;#39;s pretty weird</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="7.45">and lastly early 2016 a cancer</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="6.66">researcher his name was Professor Alan</text>
  <text start="385.33" dur="8.03">Clark was found dead hanging from a tree</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="6.989">in a rubber bodysuit ruled an accident</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="4.51">because it&amp;#39;s quite often that I</text>
  <text start="395.979" dur="3.721">accidentally slip into a rubber bodysuit</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="3.75">and then accidentally hang myself from a</text>
  <text start="399.7" dur="4.26">tree so</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="5.85">I know that that honestly sounds kind of</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="5.1">ritualistic to me so anyway there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="2.97">couple examples of many of the</text>
  <text start="409.06" dur="4.32">mysterious circumstances surrounding</text>
  <text start="410.44" dur="4.31">these doctor&amp;#39;s deaths many families</text>
  <text start="413.38" dur="3.48">actually end up hiring their own</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="5.889">investigators to investigate these</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="5.85">deaths because the authorities usually</text>
  <text start="420.639" dur="4.981">rush out an answer will that they</text>
  <text start="422.71" dur="4.739">usually call suicide or accidental but</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s always BS pretty much in every case</text>
  <text start="427.449" dur="4.981">now I don&amp;#39;t doubt that maybe some of</text>
  <text start="429.88" dur="6.3">these deaths might have been a</text>
  <text start="432.43" dur="5.88">legitimate accidental death but the</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="5.489">majority of them in my mind are not and</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s so many just weird circumstances</text>
  <text start="441.669" dur="4.171">revolving around many of them that</text>
  <text start="443.38" dur="5.099">there&amp;#39;s an obvious suppression going on</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="4.71">by the pharmaceutical industry to</text>
  <text start="448.479" dur="4.891">suppress whatever knowledge these guys</text>
  <text start="450.55" dur="5.91">had apparently with that GcMAF protein</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="5.28">that nag Alize enzyme whatever else they</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="5.34">were researching as well because I can</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="6.21">give many many more instances of doctors</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="4.619">before this time who were suppressed for</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="7.07">their research we have dr. max Gerson</text>
  <text start="466.419" dur="9.541">dr. Burzynski dr. royal rife dr. Hoxie</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="6.25">so many different names so anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="5.91">all the dead holistic doctors kind of</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="5.489">the story behind that and hope you</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="4.14">enjoyed my video thanks for watching my</text>
  <text start="483.669" dur="7.22">reporting support as you feel necessary</text>
