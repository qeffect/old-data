  <text start="10.43" dur="5.47">yo what&amp;#39;s up ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="12.929" dur="5.731">welcome back to my world-famous</text>
  <text start="15.9" dur="4.379">whiteboard lessons and in this episode</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="4.349">in this edition what I&amp;#39;m gonna do is</text>
  <text start="20.279" dur="6.811">discuss with you the let me Vanna White</text>
  <text start="23.009" dur="5.971">this secrets of Antarctica there and the</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="3.929">reason I&amp;#39;m discussing this with you</text>
  <text start="28.98" dur="4.89">today is actually for multiple reasons</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="5.04">one is because obviously there&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="33.87" dur="3.93">whole lot of stuff that we&amp;#39;re not told</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="3.721">about Antarctica that it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="3.539">important to learn the reason it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="39.78" dur="3.959">important to learn is because it helps</text>
  <text start="41.339" dur="3.9">connect a whole lot of dots as to why</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="4.32">the world is the way it is and how it</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="5.07">got there and also another reason that I</text>
  <text start="48.059" dur="4.201">really want to do this video is because</text>
  <text start="50.309" dur="3.721">if you&amp;#39;ve been following my news updates</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="6.689">you know that I&amp;#39;ve been including</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="6.779">Antarctica quite a bit and the reason</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;ve been including a lot of Antarctica</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="3.451">news stories that have been coming out</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="4.831">and seeding our consciousness in the</text>
  <text start="64.26" dur="5.31">mainstream media is because along the</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="4.89">lines with all that crap they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="69.57" dur="4.979">us about Antarctica given that the mass</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="5.25">population doesn&amp;#39;t know a lot of these</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="4.831">things if they disclose that information</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="4.08">about Antarctica to the mass public</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="5.519">there would be a very easy way for them</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="6.329">to obfuscate some of the information or</text>
  <text start="84.899" dur="4.68">basically leave some stuff out while the</text>
  <text start="88.079" dur="3.36">public with what they do tell them and</text>
  <text start="89.579" dur="2.731">then keep the rest secret you see kind</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="2.79">of see what I&amp;#39;m saying there they</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;ll give everybody a little piece of</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="2.791">the pie but they&amp;#39;ll keep the rest secret</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="3.081">because they don&amp;#39;t want a full</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.549">disclosure they want to try to avoid</text>
  <text start="98.81" dur="6.089">telling all as much as they can so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="102.569" dur="5.91">gonna help you understand some stuff</text>
  <text start="104.899" dur="7.691">about Antarctica so if any type of</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="6.09">disclosure from the powers that be were</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="4.379">to come in to the public and have an</text>
  <text start="114.569" dur="5.671">agenda behind it you would be able to</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="7.29">sniff out that agenda a lot easier by</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="6.18">knowing the knowledge of Antarctica so</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="2.511">basically that&amp;#39;s why if you catch my</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="2.759">drift</text>
  <text start="126.77" dur="6.22">if you understand what I&amp;#39;m saying just</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="5.851">nod your head behind the screen now I</text>
  <text start="132.99" dur="4.86">divvied this up into two different</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="3.87">sections you see here history reduce</text>
  <text start="137.85" dur="3.35">there&amp;#39;s a lot of unlearning and</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="5.3">relearning we&amp;#39;re gonna do here I did</text>
  <text start="141.2" dur="4.86">into recent and ancient history recent</text>
  <text start="144.2" dur="3.24">history all involved and I have a</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="3.39">timeline here that I&amp;#39;ll discuss with you</text>
  <text start="147.44" dur="5.1">all involves kind of what really went on</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="5.55">around World War two and the ancient</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="3.99">history describes kind of the past few</text>
  <text start="155" dur="4.8">hundred thousand years and what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="156.53" dur="6.03">going on in our solar system so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="4.5">begin recent history and you can see my</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="6.179">timeline here it goes from about the</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="6.87">1930s to about 1950 and there is a</text>
  <text start="168.739" dur="6.111">massive relearning curve that we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="7.71">gonna have to do about World War two</text>
  <text start="174.85" dur="8.08">because it begins here in the 1930s so</text>
  <text start="178.88" dur="7.23">in the 1930s before World War two even</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="6.059">occurred various secret societies in</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="5.43">Germany were obsessed with finding</text>
  <text start="188.989" dur="5.011">what&amp;#39;s called occult knowledge or occult</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="3.87">science now I hope you can see these</text>
  <text start="194" dur="3.63">words I hope I didn&amp;#39;t write too small</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="4.35">for you to see on the video but a cult</text>
  <text start="197.63" dur="4.47">if you don&amp;#39;t know what occult means a</text>
  <text start="199.76" dur="5.52">cult comes from the latin word occult RA</text>
  <text start="202.1" dur="4.8">which means to keep secret so this means</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="3.09">basically secretive science and</text>
  <text start="206.9" dur="4.77">secretive knowledge that the powers that</text>
  <text start="208.37" dur="5.04">be want to keep secret for their own</text>
  <text start="211.67" dur="2.25">gain and then they keep the rest of the</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="4.799">world</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="9.93">ignorant oh cool now this what this</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="9.541">occult knowledge was had to do with very</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="6.359">advanced technology because in the 1930s</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="5.04">the Germans knew they didn&amp;#39;t have as</text>
  <text start="230.209" dur="5.25">much men as the Americans and the Allies</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="6.39">they knew that they didn&amp;#39;t have as many</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="7.021">tanks and not as much of an industrial</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="5.309">capability of like America per se so</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="4.11">what the Germans were obsessed with was</text>
  <text start="244.489" dur="4.681">finding what&amp;#39;s called qualitative</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="5.01">superiority instead of quantitative</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="4.68">superiority those are basically very big</text>
  <text start="251.6" dur="4.47">words to say they wanted quantity they</text>
  <text start="253.85" dur="3.9">wanted more advanced stuff than more men</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="3.15">and more boots on the ground so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="5.37">why they were obsessed with finding this</text>
  <text start="259.22" dur="7.38">secretive science and what they did was</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="5.37">then in the 30s the couple of the secret</text>
  <text start="266.6" dur="5.86">societies in Germany such as the Vril</text>
  <text start="268.49" dur="6.25">the ril the fuel tools</text>
  <text start="272.46" dur="5.76">ETH ule they believe there&amp;#39;s another one</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="6.51">called the order the Black Sun they all</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="5.4">kind of worked in tandem together with</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="3.72">the Nazi regime as well so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="4.26">of different you know secret societies</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="5.07">as is now around the world kind of same</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="4.95">concept but these secret societies were</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="4.02">all working together in Germany to find</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="3.69">this cult science and what they did was</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="5.1">they actually sent and a research</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="6.84">expedition to the Himalayas into India</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="7.62">because in India if you&amp;#39;ve ever read the</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="5.37">I believe it&amp;#39;s the Mahabharata or I know</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;s just ancient Vedic scriptures I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="308.73" dur="3.18">just leave it that general because I</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t know the exact name but in the</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="3.72">ancient Vedic scriptures there was</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="5.73">reference to what was called Vimanas the</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="5.22">I M a na the modest Vimanas in these</text>
  <text start="319.2" dur="4.71">scriptures it literally said that these</text>
  <text start="320.85" dur="6.55">were craft that had the ability to</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="6.23">control gravity and they used</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="5.84">[Music]</text>
  <text start="330.14" dur="6.28">counter-rotating mercury to do so so</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="7.11">this will get you know this will get</text>
  <text start="336.42" dur="6.99">into a video on physical alchemy that I</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="4.74">planning on doing soon here but</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="3.99">basically when you counter-rotate</text>
  <text start="345.09" dur="4.98">mercury and shock it with electricity it</text>
  <text start="347.4" dur="5.31">can create a gravity canceling field</text>
  <text start="350.07" dur="4.38">around it so that&amp;#39;s basically it pretty</text>
  <text start="352.71" dur="3.33">freakin advanced for the 1930s right</text>
  <text start="354.45" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s why they were obsessed with</text>
  <text start="356.04" dur="4.11">finding it so they went to the Himalayas</text>
  <text start="358.23" dur="3.57">they brought they found a bunch of</text>
  <text start="360.15" dur="2.97">scrolls a bunch of texts and things like</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="3.57">that they brought him back to Germany</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="4.92">they brought back monks and people to</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="5.91">decipher these texts with them and they</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="4.92">did so so that was one of the ways that</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="5.55">they were able to obtain this very</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="5.19">advanced science in the 1930s another</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="3.74">one of the ways that I do want to</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="6.36">mention involved channeling</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="7.3">extraterrestrials and not kidding you</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="6.39">with what I say there so what this</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="4.47">secret society did the rill the Vril was</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="6.36">one of them operating in Germany at the</text>
  <text start="392.34" dur="6.66">time they worked with a woman I believe</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="4.8">a group of women but I knew one of them</text>
  <text start="399" dur="6.33">their name was Maria or such far</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="8.43">si si maria orsic and she was able to</text>
  <text start="405.33" dur="8.58">actually channel information from oh I</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="5.64">forget where or what non-terrestrial</text>
  <text start="413.91" dur="5.84">group or whatnot but anyway she was able</text>
  <text start="416.13" dur="7.53">to actually channel directions to build</text>
  <text start="419.75" dur="6.76">these anti-gravity craft these new age</text>
  <text start="423.66" dur="3.99">of amana&amp;#39;s per se so there I just wanted</text>
  <text start="426.51" dur="2.97">to throw that in there because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="4.38">multiple ways that they found this</text>
  <text start="429.48" dur="5.97">occult science but they did and they</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="6.8">were actually able to build what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="435.45" dur="6.09">known as the German Bell craft and</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="5.02">actually quite a few different prototype</text>
  <text start="441.54" dur="4.26">flying discs giant flying discs</text>
  <text start="443.85" dur="4.98">according to some reports big ones</text>
  <text start="445.8" dur="5.64">hundreds of feet sacrifise foot</text>
  <text start="448.83" dur="6.36">potato potato hundreds of feet across</text>
  <text start="451.44" dur="5.28">with turrets and things like that on</text>
  <text start="455.19" dur="5.4">them so they were able to build some</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="9.27">pretty neat stuff now fast-forward to</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="7.29">1945 World War two ends of course</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="3.63">remember the winners always get to write</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="5.099">the textbooks so did World War two</text>
  <text start="469.62" dur="5.96">actually end mm-hmm part of this occult</text>
  <text start="472.979" dur="6.331">science that the Germans found involved</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="4.6">Antarctica and it involved ancient</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="2.609">build-outs</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="4.32">in Antarctica we&amp;#39;ll get more into that</text>
  <text start="481.919" dur="4.021">down here but I just wanted to tell you</text>
  <text start="484.5" dur="3.6">that because the Germans once they found</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="4.38">out what was actually in Antarctica they</text>
  <text start="488.1" dur="4.41">went to build out down there and during</text>
  <text start="490.32" dur="4.29">the 30s they actually built some bases</text>
  <text start="492.51" dur="5.76">in Antarctica they took their u-boats</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="7.679">down there and built it out now when</text>
  <text start="498.27" dur="6.99">world war ii quote ended the Germans</text>
  <text start="502.289" dur="5.791">escaped to Antarctica this is the part</text>
  <text start="505.26" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s not told let me let me clarify</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="5.339">this is the part that&amp;#39;s not told World</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="5.25">War two did end but only in Europe okay</text>
  <text start="513.419" dur="4.441">because like I said earlier the quantity</text>
  <text start="515.58" dur="5.459">versus quality thing the Germans could</text>
  <text start="517.86" dur="5.13">not overcome the Americans manpower they</text>
  <text start="521.039" dur="3.99">just had more men more tanks and the</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="4.11">Germans weren&amp;#39;t able to build enough of</text>
  <text start="525.029" dur="4.711">those really bit really you know cool</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="4.41">anti-gravity craft in time to combat</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="3.48">that so the Germans did lose</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="4.5">Europe but this is the part that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="533.22" dur="8.58">told the Germans were able to escape to</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="6.47">Antarctica in around the end of World</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="5.52">War two</text>
  <text start="542.48" dur="6.97">now what occurred at this point we have</text>
  <text start="547.32" dur="5.64">the Allies right over take care of the</text>
  <text start="549.45" dur="5.88">Germans in Antarctica this begins the</text>
  <text start="552.96" dur="4.47">discussion of what&amp;#39;s called Operation</text>
  <text start="555.33" dur="4.23">Paperclip now many of these people</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="3.84">watching my videos probably know what</text>
  <text start="559.56" dur="3.75">Operation Paperclip is but just for a</text>
  <text start="561.27" dur="5.04">quick refresher this is basically an</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="7.92">operation that lasted from 1945 to 1951</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="7.41">we&amp;#39;re about 3,000 Nazi scientists and</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="4.89">researchers were basically shuttled into</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="4.68">America from Germany and this is pretty</text>
  <text start="576.12" dur="3.87">well known I mean it&amp;#39;s on Wikipedia and</text>
  <text start="578.4" dur="4.47">mainstream media and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="6.05">it&amp;#39;s just they don&amp;#39;t connect the dots</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="6.09">for you so that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m doing it here</text>
  <text start="586.04" dur="6.7">so Operation Paperclip began when World</text>
  <text start="588.96" dur="6.06">War two ended in 1945 thousands of Nazi</text>
  <text start="592.74" dur="5.01">scientists the ones that didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="595.02" dur="4.62">shuttled into Antarctica the Americans</text>
  <text start="597.75" dur="3.42">wanted their brains essentially so they</text>
  <text start="599.64" dur="3.81">were brought into America they were</text>
  <text start="601.17" dur="4.38">debriefed and some of them spilled the</text>
  <text start="603.45" dur="3.63">beans and some of them said oh you know</text>
  <text start="605.55" dur="4.2">a lot of our colleagues freaking escaped</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="4.19">to Antarctica once the Americans caught</text>
  <text start="609.75" dur="5.28">wind of that</text>
  <text start="611.27" dur="7">operation Highjump occurred now this is</text>
  <text start="615.03" dur="5.34">really really important because a lot of</text>
  <text start="618.27" dur="4.74">people that are beginning their</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="3.93">truth-seeking process they know of</text>
  <text start="623.01" dur="2.31">Operation Paperclip because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.3" dur="2.97">quite a bit of information out there</text>
  <text start="625.32" dur="3.78">about that but operation Highjump</text>
  <text start="627.27" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s not so much information out</text>
  <text start="629.1" dur="4.65">there about that and even less that I</text>
  <text start="631.86" dur="3.63">see when people connect the dots between</text>
  <text start="633.75" dur="4.41">the two which is very important to do</text>
  <text start="635.49" dur="5.88">what operation Highjump was it was</text>
  <text start="638.16" dur="7.17">commissioned in December 1946 I believe</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="8.94">and it was led by the Americans by a man</text>
  <text start="645.33" dur="8.36">named Admiral Richard Byrd beard</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="10.01">Admiral beard he</text>
  <text start="653.69" dur="10.59">was tasked with bringing 5,000 men 40</text>
  <text start="660.32" dur="6.9">ships the excuse me 13 ships 40 aircraft</text>
  <text start="664.28" dur="6.15">and a whole buttload of equipment all</text>
  <text start="667.22" dur="5.25">down to Antarctica now this was on</text>
  <text start="670.43" dur="6.54">official record tasked as being a</text>
  <text start="672.47" dur="7.14">scientific exploration but tell me how</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="6.32">many scientific explorations require a</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="5.52">battle group with 5000 men and 13 ships</text>
  <text start="683.29" dur="4.57">none of them I&amp;#39;ll tell you that</text>
  <text start="685.13" dur="4.83">so of course since world war ii was on</text>
  <text start="687.86" dur="3.66">public record ended they had two tasks</text>
  <text start="689.96" dur="4.29">that as being a scientific exploration</text>
  <text start="691.52" dur="4.83">but it wasn&amp;#39;t it was a military assault</text>
  <text start="694.25" dur="2.91">versus the Germans that they knew we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="696.35" dur="4.38">in Antarctica</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="6.24">so when admiral byrd got down there he</text>
  <text start="700.73" dur="6.3">got down to Antarctica in late January</text>
  <text start="703.4" dur="6.3">early February of 1947 he encountered</text>
  <text start="707.03" dur="4.77">the German resistance but the important</text>
  <text start="709.7" dur="6.63">point is that he had no frickin idea</text>
  <text start="711.8" dur="7.41">that the Germans had big-ass UFOs so he</text>
  <text start="716.33" dur="3.3">got down there and the Germans attacked</text>
  <text start="719.21" dur="2.55">him</text>
  <text start="719.63" dur="5.4">they actually sunk a couple of their</text>
  <text start="721.76" dur="4.47">ships and basically stunned this whole</text>
  <text start="725.03" dur="5.28">battle group because these guys had no</text>
  <text start="726.23" dur="5.28">idea what they were in for and all they</text>
  <text start="730.31" dur="2.31">really knew was the Germans were down</text>
  <text start="731.51" dur="6.33">there but they didn&amp;#39;t know what they had</text>
  <text start="732.62" dur="7.29">so these Bell craft these basically</text>
  <text start="737.84" dur="4.95">electrogravitic craft attacked the</text>
  <text start="739.91" dur="4.71">Americans destroyed him Admiral Byrd had</text>
  <text start="742.79" dur="5.3">to retreat he actually retreated back to</text>
  <text start="744.62" dur="6.11">South America and he is on record by a</text>
  <text start="748.09" dur="6.01">Chilean newspaper he was interviewed</text>
  <text start="750.73" dur="7.48">soon after his return and he was quoted</text>
  <text start="754.1" dur="6.78">as saying the enemy has blazingly fast</text>
  <text start="758.21" dur="5.4">ships that can fly from pole to pole at</text>
  <text start="760.88" dur="4.38">an amazing speed something did that</text>
  <text start="763.61" dur="3.27">effect I&amp;#39;m kind of paraphrasing but he</text>
  <text start="765.26" dur="4.47">said pole to pole at his amazing speed</text>
  <text start="766.88" dur="4.2">he was literally talking about oh my god</text>
  <text start="769.73" dur="4.47">I don&amp;#39;t know what the heck they have but</text>
  <text start="771.08" dur="10.13">it blew our up and that was</text>
  <text start="774.2" dur="8.97">operation Highjump now you know with the</text>
  <text start="781.21" dur="3.46">Americans get destroyed the Americans</text>
  <text start="783.17" dur="3.71">knowing that they don&amp;#39;t have quite as</text>
  <text start="784.67" dur="2.21">much</text>
  <text start="788.17" dur="5.83">qualitative superiority you could say</text>
  <text start="790.81" dur="4.69">that essentially forced their hands once</text>
  <text start="794" dur="4.59">they knew what they were dealing with</text>
  <text start="795.5" dur="4.98">they were like oh crap you know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="798.59" dur="5.16">have that really neat stuff and then</text>
  <text start="800.48" dur="5.04">this occurred in 1952 kind of towards</text>
  <text start="803.75" dur="3.6">the end of Operation Paperclip a little</text>
  <text start="805.52" dur="3">bit after our operation Highjump I just</text>
  <text start="807.35" dur="3.09">want to throw this in there because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.52" dur="6.51">a really interesting point there was a</text>
  <text start="810.44" dur="7.98">flyover of a whole group of UFOs right</text>
  <text start="815.03" dur="5.58">above Washington DC okay and you could</text>
  <text start="818.42" dur="4.38">YouTube the video of this it&amp;#39;s plain as</text>
  <text start="820.61" dur="4.62">day it was where it was front-page news</text>
  <text start="822.8" dur="7.55">in the Washington DC paper the next day</text>
  <text start="825.23" dur="7.47">as well not aliens it was not</text>
  <text start="830.35" dur="5.95">nonterrestrials this is a very important</text>
  <text start="832.7" dur="6.15">point to make in that many not all</text>
  <text start="836.3" dur="5.61">definitely not all but many UFO</text>
  <text start="838.85" dur="5.75">sightings that are reported are man-made</text>
  <text start="841.91" dur="5.07">craft okay</text>
  <text start="844.6" dur="3.64">these were man-made the ones that flew</text>
  <text start="846.98" dur="2.79">over the Capitol and they were German</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="3.21">craft they were German Bell craft</text>
  <text start="849.77" dur="4.11">literally right over the US Capitol</text>
  <text start="851.45" dur="5.46">building in Washington DC and what that</text>
  <text start="853.88" dur="6.63">did was that forced the Americans hand</text>
  <text start="856.91" dur="8.16">because the American military they did</text>
  <text start="860.51" dur="6.51">not want to disclose the reality of UFOs</text>
  <text start="865.07" dur="5.22">and all that stuff because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="867.02" dur="4.77">want to cause a huge hysteria in America</text>
  <text start="870.29" dur="3.57">and they also knew that they would</text>
  <text start="871.79" dur="3.66">probably get you know burned at the</text>
  <text start="873.86" dur="3.12">stake if they would be like oh you know</text>
  <text start="875.45" dur="6.18">there&amp;#39;s this that we weren&amp;#39;t telling you</text>
  <text start="876.98" dur="6.51">about for a while right um so they</text>
  <text start="881.63" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t say anything and their hand was</text>
  <text start="883.49" dur="4.38">essentially forced by the Germans to say</text>
  <text start="885.44" dur="5.79">hey we&amp;#39;re going to infiltrate you suckas</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="7.74">that&amp;#39;s exactly what they did so that</text>
  <text start="891.23" dur="5.55">essentially put the ending phases on</text>
  <text start="895.61" dur="4.8">Operation Paperclip</text>
  <text start="896.78" dur="6.36">and of that occurred via Germans were</text>
  <text start="900.41" dur="5.97">then able to infiltrate right into</text>
  <text start="903.14" dur="4.74">America and that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened</text>
  <text start="906.38" dur="3.81">after World War two the Germans never</text>
  <text start="907.88" dur="4.11">lost they won they won World War two and</text>
  <text start="910.19" dur="3.51">remember like I said the winners right</text>
  <text start="911.99" dur="3.81">the textbooks so the textbooks are</text>
  <text start="913.7" dur="4.57">written as if the Germans lost and oh my</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="4.99">gosh you know nobody even questioned</text>
  <text start="918.27" dur="4.71">that the freakin bush family had Nazi</text>
  <text start="920.79" dur="3.12">origins and the propaganda campaigns</text>
  <text start="922.98" dur="4.26">that we&amp;#39;re seeing in America right now</text>
  <text start="923.91" dur="6.35">or directly you know point-to-point</text>
  <text start="927.24" dur="5.37">what they were in nazi germany so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="930.26" dur="4.75">see that stuff it&amp;#39;s really interesting</text>
  <text start="932.61" dur="4.47">so boom germans officially infiltrate</text>
  <text start="935.01" dur="4.71">america and then the rest is history</text>
  <text start="937.08" dur="3.75">Drake the Eisenhower and his farewell</text>
  <text start="939.72" dur="2.67">speech called out the</text>
  <text start="940.83" dur="7.22">military-industrial complex John F</text>
  <text start="942.39" dur="7.98">Kennedy tried to battle them he got and</text>
  <text start="948.05" dur="4.39">you know the rest is history there so</text>
  <text start="950.37" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s essentially the unlearning</text>
  <text start="952.44" dur="2.99">and relearning that we have to do about</text>
  <text start="953.7" dur="4.53">World War two okay</text>
  <text start="955.43" dur="5.2">completely involves Antarctica involves</text>
  <text start="958.23" dur="6.06">a lot of very advanced science involves</text>
  <text start="960.63" dur="5.43">a lot of stuff that you know with with</text>
  <text start="964.29" dur="3.45">the wrong perspectives would go right</text>
  <text start="966.06" dur="3.09">over people&amp;#39;s heads but that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="967.74" dur="4.08">so important to learn it so we get the</text>
  <text start="969.15" dur="5.61">right perspectives so we can&amp;#39;t be duped</text>
  <text start="971.82" dur="5.28">and stuff doesn&amp;#39;t go over our heads so</text>
  <text start="974.76" dur="3.99">boom there&amp;#39;s recent history and then</text>
  <text start="977.1" dur="3.18">ancient history I&amp;#39;m just gonna cover</text>
  <text start="978.75" dur="3.66">really quick I&amp;#39;m not gonna go too deep</text>
  <text start="980.28" dur="4.11">into this because I&amp;#39;m still trying to</text>
  <text start="982.41" dur="4.32">put the pieces together about myself and</text>
  <text start="984.39" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s a lot of other resources I can</text>
  <text start="986.73" dur="3.66">port you towards for the time being that</text>
  <text start="989.01" dur="3.12">would just be much better use of your</text>
  <text start="990.39" dur="4.29">time than me trying to you in</text>
  <text start="992.13" dur="5.34">this video but ancient history just a</text>
  <text start="994.68" dur="4.26">few bullet points about that there used</text>
  <text start="997.47" dur="4.89">to be an ancient planet in our solar</text>
  <text start="998.94" dur="7.77">system and this actually has a whole lot</text>
  <text start="1002.36" dur="6.84">of scientific data and scriptural data</text>
  <text start="1006.71" dur="4.8">to support that you know from both sides</text>
  <text start="1009.2" dur="5.25">as there&amp;#39;s a scientist from NASA is</text>
  <text start="1011.51" dur="4.35">named dr. Tom Van Flandern I think is</text>
  <text start="1014.45" dur="2.76">how you say his name he came up with</text>
  <text start="1015.86" dur="3.3">what&amp;#39;s called the exploding planet</text>
  <text start="1017.21" dur="4.2">hypothesis and I&amp;#39;m gonna do another</text>
  <text start="1019.16" dur="3.51">video you know on this very soon here</text>
  <text start="1021.41" dur="2.82">this is another thing that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1022.67" dur="3.15">important understand there used to be an</text>
  <text start="1024.23" dur="3.42">h planet not four controller system and</text>
  <text start="1025.82" dur="3.51">it goes by many names and went by some</text>
  <text start="1027.65" dur="4.8">people called the TM ah I believe if you</text>
  <text start="1029.33" dur="4.65">fall at stitching&amp;#39;s work I think Tom dr.</text>
  <text start="1032.45" dur="2.54">Tom Lander and just called it an</text>
  <text start="1033.98" dur="5.19">exploding planet</text>
  <text start="1034.99" dur="6.67">it&amp;#39;s been called Phaeton I believe and</text>
  <text start="1039.17" dur="6.3">like Russian religious scripture</text>
  <text start="1041.66" dur="4.77">mythology or something Electra might&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1045.47" dur="3.66">been another name lots of different</text>
  <text start="1046.43" dur="5.01">names anyway there&amp;#39;s planet it was right</text>
  <text start="1049.13" dur="4.649">where the asteroid belt was in</text>
  <text start="1051.44" dur="4.979">ours was a mood of it makes a whole lot</text>
  <text start="1053.779" dur="6.12">of freaking sense because when NASA gets</text>
  <text start="1056.419" dur="5.821">all of their pictures of solar systems</text>
  <text start="1059.899" dur="3.9">that are deep in space why don&amp;#39;t any of</text>
  <text start="1062.24" dur="3.87">them have a freakin asteroid belt ours</text>
  <text start="1063.799" dur="4.201">is like the only one and where did it</text>
  <text start="1066.11" dur="4.439">how did it were to come from you know of</text>
  <text start="1068" dur="3.84">course conventional science they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1070.549" dur="3.51">scratching their heads I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1071.84" dur="5.789">maybe we&amp;#39;ll find out someday here&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="1074.059" dur="4.771">crappy theory in the meantime but the</text>
  <text start="1077.629" dur="3">asteroid belt essentially are the</text>
  <text start="1078.83" dur="3.719">remnants of an exploded planet Mars was</text>
  <text start="1080.629" dur="4.64">a moon of it and when that planet</text>
  <text start="1082.549" dur="5.521">exploded by some estimates approximately</text>
  <text start="1085.269" dur="5.441">500,000 years ago there was also a</text>
  <text start="1088.07" dur="5.099">civilized civilization on it and that</text>
  <text start="1090.71" dur="4.049">civilization then had to obviously move</text>
  <text start="1093.169" dur="6.421">because their planet got blown up some</text>
  <text start="1094.759" dur="7.591">of them were able to escape and the</text>
  <text start="1099.59" dur="5.219">survivors then crash-landed onto</text>
  <text start="1102.35" dur="4.679">Antarctica and this was by some</text>
  <text start="1104.809" dur="4.86">estimates probably 50 to 60 thousand</text>
  <text start="1107.029" dur="4.051">years ago so wherever they you know</text>
  <text start="1109.669" dur="3.931">wherever they left whether they went to</text>
  <text start="1111.08" dur="4.29">Mars or or somewhere else eventually</text>
  <text start="1113.6" dur="3.9">they ended up on planet earth and they</text>
  <text start="1115.37" dur="3.98">ended up in Antarctica and the crash</text>
  <text start="1117.5" dur="4.019">landed there now also keep in mind</text>
  <text start="1119.35" dur="4.689">approximately 50 to 60 thousand years</text>
  <text start="1121.519" dur="8.061">ago Antarctica was at a very different</text>
  <text start="1124.039" dur="5.541">spot on our planet and this is due to</text>
  <text start="1129.669" dur="5.801">pole shifts both magnetic pole shifts</text>
  <text start="1132.98" dur="5.939">and geophysical pole shift geophysical</text>
  <text start="1135.47" dur="4.919">meaning the earth literally Antarctica</text>
  <text start="1138.919" dur="4.171">was in a different place then due to a</text>
  <text start="1140.389" dur="4.79">crust displacement geophysical pole</text>
  <text start="1143.09" dur="5.1">shift the earth literally rotates and</text>
  <text start="1145.179" dur="4.811">Antarctica went to the South Pole flash</text>
  <text start="1148.19" dur="5.9">froze the way because it got colder</text>
  <text start="1149.99" dur="4.1">really quick so Antarctica</text>
  <text start="1154.299" dur="4.181">basically the survivors crash-landed on</text>
  <text start="1156.649" dur="5.73">Antarctica and then a pole shift</text>
  <text start="1158.48" dur="5.73">occurred and froze their remnants down</text>
  <text start="1162.379" dur="3.78">there froze there basically their</text>
  <text start="1164.21" dur="3.24">ancient civilizations will just put some</text>
  <text start="1166.159" dur="6.181">pyramids here because it froze their</text>
  <text start="1167.45" dur="6.9">pyramids and some evidence interesting</text>
  <text start="1172.34" dur="5.52">evidence regarding this is what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="1174.35" dur="8.16">the pre re or pre rice map and this was</text>
  <text start="1177.86" dur="9.33">written in 1513 by a</text>
  <text start="1182.51" dur="7.68">man who ottoman Ottoman Empire here&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1187.19" dur="4.74">ottoman general Admiral and one of those</text>
  <text start="1190.19" dur="6.99">but he was in the Ottoman Empire he</text>
  <text start="1191.93" dur="7.32">wrote he drew up this map in 1513 that</text>
  <text start="1197.18" dur="3.66">showed Antarctica blatantly showed</text>
  <text start="1199.25" dur="5.37">Antarctica and it showed it as being a</text>
  <text start="1200.84" dur="6.63">completely ice-free land mass now he</text>
  <text start="1204.62" dur="5.31">wrote this he didn&amp;#39;t write it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1207.47" dur="4.59">believe he wrote it from exploring it he</text>
  <text start="1209.93" dur="5.04">wrote he wrote this map based off</text>
  <text start="1212.06" dur="5.25">previous Intel based off previous</text>
  <text start="1214.97" dur="4.83">knowledge that he had so that really</text>
  <text start="1217.31" dur="4.8">makes you question well that occult</text>
  <text start="1219.8" dur="3.48">knowledge that I mean there&amp;#39;s a cult</text>
  <text start="1222.11" dur="2.73">knowledge that&amp;#39;s been hidden from us for</text>
  <text start="1223.28" dur="5.19">thousands and thousands and thousands of</text>

  <text start="1228.47" dur="6.06">very people that crash-landed here now</text>
  <text start="1232.31" dur="4.32">let&amp;#39;s tie some dots in together the</text>
  <text start="1234.53" dur="4.56">people that crash-landed crash landed</text>
  <text start="1236.63" dur="5.43">here on Antarctica they then were able</text>
  <text start="1239.09" dur="4.89">to spread out across the planet and set</text>
  <text start="1242.06" dur="3.48">up different civilizations these people</text>
  <text start="1243.98" dur="4.2">had elongated heads</text>
  <text start="1245.54" dur="4.29">which is why in for instance the Mayan I</text>
  <text start="1248.18" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t know South American cultures and</text>
