  <text start="6.089" dur="5.461">noble gold investments and because he is</text>
  <text start="8.82" dur="4.77">a precious metals aficionado I wanted to</text>
  <text start="11.55" dur="3.93">ask his opinion on a couple things one</text>
  <text start="13.59" dur="4.05">of those being the possibility of our</text>
  <text start="15.48" dur="4.86">country soon going back on the gold</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="5.79">standard and some recent legislation</text>
  <text start="20.34" dur="4.98">that might be making that happen and I</text>
  <text start="23.43" dur="4.439">also wanted to ask him his opinion on</text>
  <text start="25.32" dur="4.89">the trade wars and how we best might be</text>
  <text start="27.869" dur="5.37">able to protect ourselves against any</text>
  <text start="30.21" dur="7.25">potential economic chaos that we might</text>
  <text start="33.239" dur="4.221">soon be going through so check it out</text>
  <text start="41.8" dur="3.97">all right well thanks Colin for coming</text>
  <text start="44.36" dur="2.61">back on here there&amp;#39;s a lot of things I</text>
  <text start="45.77" dur="5.219">want to talk about today I want to get</text>
  <text start="46.97" dur="5.64">your thoughts on the new HR 5 404 bill</text>
  <text start="50.989" dur="3.271">talking about actually instituting a</text>
  <text start="52.61" dur="4.23">gold standard and I want to get your</text>
  <text start="54.26" dur="4.29">ideas on the trade war as well because I</text>
  <text start="56.84" dur="4.109">think you could have some good</text>
  <text start="58.55" dur="3.96">perspectives on that so thanks for</text>
  <text start="60.949" dur="4.11">joining me thanks Jordan</text>
  <text start="62.51" dur="4.23">yeah know this bill it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="65.059" dur="3.42">because if you read through the bill</text>
  <text start="66.74" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s short and I actually recommend</text>
  <text start="68.479" dur="6.231">anyone to download it and I&amp;#39;m gonna make</text>
  <text start="71.99" dur="4.83">it available to people that contact us</text>
  <text start="74.71" dur="4.87">so they can read it it&amp;#39;s only about a</text>
  <text start="76.82" dur="4.2">page page and a half text basically just</text>
  <text start="79.58" dur="2.85">talks about what we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="81.02" dur="5.19">about that we need to go back in the</text>
  <text start="82.43" dur="5.969">gold standard that you know in in</text>
  <text start="86.21" dur="4.35">summary he says you know if we if we</text>
  <text start="88.399" dur="5.011">believe the government&amp;#39;s 2% inflation</text>
  <text start="90.56" dur="5.669">number that means you know every you</text>
  <text start="93.41" dur="4.77">know 30 40 years our money the value of</text>
  <text start="96.229" dur="4.881">our purchasing power drops in half and</text>
  <text start="98.18" dur="6.48">so by going back on the gold standard</text>
  <text start="101.11" dur="7.119">and limiting the amount of money that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="104.66" dur="6.3">out there to how much gold we have that</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="5.101">would make it possible for people that</text>
  <text start="110.96" dur="4.92">save money or people that want to buy</text>
  <text start="113.33" dur="5.249">bonds it makes it possible for you and I</text>
  <text start="115.88" dur="6.059">to put money in a bag and have that</text>
  <text start="118.579" dur="4.441">money grow as opposed to now if you put</text>
  <text start="121.939" dur="3.36">money to make not only do you make a</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="4.65">quarter of a percent but you&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="125.299" dur="3.96">losing you know 2% because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="3.69">the government says the inflation is and</text>
  <text start="129.259" dur="4.771">even though the inflation is much higher</text>
  <text start="131.36" dur="4.349">it&amp;#39;s closer to nine or ten percent right</text>
  <text start="134.03" dur="3.59">I&amp;#39;m going back on the gold standard</text>
  <text start="135.709" dur="4.53">would put us in a much better position</text>
  <text start="137.62" dur="3.55">and you know there&amp;#39;s some other things</text>
  <text start="140.239" dur="2.641">in that bill so that we could discuss</text>
  <text start="141.17" dur="3.03">but what are your thoughts what are your</text>
  <text start="142.88" dur="3.09">thoughts at the gold standard what do</text>
  <text start="144.2" dur="4.59">you think about it I mean I think it</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="4.799">would be a definite plus anything to get</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="4.11">us off this baseless fiat currency</text>
  <text start="150.769" dur="3.481">system that we have and the gold</text>
  <text start="152.9" dur="4.26">standard would definitely be a viable</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="4.14">option yeah to shift us on - so what</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="4.65">were your thoughts when you read that</text>
  <text start="158.39" dur="5.28">short I mean a couple page bill that was</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="4.2">introduced just I think two weeks ago</text>
  <text start="163.67" dur="4.069">now it&amp;#39;s pretty recent yeah you know</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s first of all it&amp;#39;s written by</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="4.471">representative Mooney Dartmouth graduate</text>
  <text start="170.69" dur="3.17">our</text>
  <text start="172.21" dur="4.14">government lies exposed with talks about</text>
  <text start="173.86" dur="4.2">inflation talks about the debt that</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re in is written by a Dartmouth</text>
  <text start="178.06" dur="5.01">graduate also an economist so obviously</text>
  <text start="180.55" dur="4.71">the school of thought there is similar</text>
  <text start="183.07" dur="3.96">that we need to get you know off the</text>
  <text start="185.26" dur="4.17">fiat money as you mentioned and move</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="4.65">towards something that&amp;#39;s backed which</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="4.71">would limit the amount of money that</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="5.16">could be printed it would make you know</text>
  <text start="194.14" dur="4.17">everyone&amp;#39;s wages kind of hold value you</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="3.39">know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the real problem with</text>
  <text start="198.31" dur="4.17">our wages today is that the dollars are</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="4.59">shrinking in value so if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="202.48" dur="5.28">getting substantial raises every year</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="5.52">you can&amp;#39;t keep up and you can&amp;#39;t continue</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="4.47">to buy the goods that you need at the</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="3.39">end of the bill they snuck in something</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="4.29">that I thought was really interesting is</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="5.4">that you know it says after thirty days</text>
  <text start="216.52" dur="5.76">after we enact this bill we also need to</text>
  <text start="219.13" dur="6.54">do an accounting of the gold that we</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="5.4">have mmm make that so which is something</text>
  <text start="225.67" dur="4.41">that Ron Paul has been pushing for is</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="3.99">that we want to know is there gold how</text>
  <text start="230.08" dur="3.39">much Gold&amp;#39;s in Fort Knox how much we</text>
  <text start="231.67" dur="4.92">have they&amp;#39;ve never been an actual</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="5.43">physical audit since the 70s so not only</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="4.26">is it moving us towards a gold standard</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="3.51">but also we get some kind of accounting</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="4.41">of what we actually have or if we</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="6.21">actually have gold in Fort Knox so I</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="4.44">think it&amp;#39;s a great bill I&amp;#39;m definitely</text>
  <text start="248.62" dur="4.26">going to be reaching out to the</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="4.98">representative and showing support but I</text>
  <text start="252.88" dur="4.32">think it would it would help with a lot</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="4.38">of our finances and get things under</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="4.08">control which if that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="4.62">the nuts and bolts of it is is that our</text>
  <text start="261.28" dur="5.19">economy our debt is out of control</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="4.86">you know they report 22 trillion if you</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="4.23">factor in unfunded liabilities like</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="3.93">Medicare Medicaid and we talk about this</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="4.47">in our ebook it&amp;#39;s actually closer to a</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="5.55">hundred and seven trillion in debt so</text>
  <text start="275.17" dur="5.34">you can only do that when you can just</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="4.32">print money you can&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not feasible</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="4.11">on a gold standard you can never be in</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="3.93">that kind of debt so I think it would it</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="4.5">would help things out and and I think</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re due for a correction and I think</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="3.69">that you know precious metals tangible</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="4.08">investments they can&amp;#39;t be manipulated</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="4.56">like the dollar are gonna perform well</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="5.67">when that happens so a couple questions</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="5.58">on that note a how feasible do you think</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="5.499">this bill is to being passed and put</text>
  <text start="302.95" dur="5.679">into action and be because you&amp;#39;re more</text>
  <text start="306.319" dur="4.921">well versed on economics and I am what</text>
  <text start="308.629" dur="5.701">would this actually do to our wages or</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="5.039">the prices of various goods you know I I</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="3.75">think in terms of getting it passed it</text>
  <text start="316.279" dur="3.87">just it really comes down to the public</text>
  <text start="318.08" dur="5.13">if the public pushes their</text>
  <text start="320.149" dur="5.22">representatives to start going in this</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="3.449">fashion then it can absolutely happen</text>
  <text start="325.369" dur="4.38">I think everybody&amp;#39;s fed up with</text>
  <text start="326.659" dur="6.15">everything that&amp;#39;s happening right the</text>
  <text start="329.749" dur="5.25">big question will be how do we rein in</text>
  <text start="332.809" dur="4.44">the spending how do we get this under</text>
  <text start="334.999" dur="4.38">control so that you know we can really</text>
  <text start="337.249" dur="4.14">back the currency it also talks about</text>
  <text start="339.379" dur="4.26">you know what you used to be able to do</text>
  <text start="341.389" dur="4.2">is if you had a $20 bill and you had a</text>
  <text start="343.639" dur="4.86">$20 gold piece that you used to be able</text>
  <text start="345.589" dur="5.55">to exchange those you know you can</text>
  <text start="348.499" dur="4.17">change those for currency I think people</text>
  <text start="351.139" dur="2.911">like that I think people like the idea</text>
  <text start="352.669" dur="3.84">of being able exchange something</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="3.72">tangible for something paper so that</text>
  <text start="356.509" dur="4.261">they know that there&amp;#39;s something real</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="5.069">there they&amp;#39;ll have to equate it to where</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="4.859">gold is today because obviously Gold&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.839" dur="5.521">not at $20 an ounce anymore it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="365.629" dur="4.41">higher I think it I think it could</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="3.539">happen I think there&amp;#39;s you know Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="370.039" dur="3.75">started that sentiment he wanted to do</text>
  <text start="371.899" dur="3.42">it and I think there&amp;#39;s a you know a lot</text>
  <text start="373.789" dur="4.44">of young people now that are pushing for</text>
  <text start="375.319" dur="5.58">reform so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised in</text>
  <text start="378.229" dur="4.29">terms of your second question price gold</text>
  <text start="380.899" dur="3.721">as we mentioned last time glow would be</text>
  <text start="382.519" dur="3.54">at 40 or 50 thousand dollars an ounce if</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="3.029">we went back to the gold standard just</text>
  <text start="386.059" dur="4.22">because all the dollars are out there</text>
  <text start="387.649" dur="5.52">and how limited the supply of gold is</text>
  <text start="390.279" dur="5.41">you know just in the world I think that</text>
  <text start="393.169" dur="4.441">we would see just a huge price increase</text>
  <text start="395.689" dur="3.9">it would bring a lot of stability</text>
  <text start="397.61" dur="3.57">because all the central banks have hold</text>
  <text start="399.589" dur="4.32">already it&amp;#39;s an easy bartering</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="4.799">instrument so it makes sense you know</text>
  <text start="403.909" dur="5.76">China India Brazil Russia they all</text>
  <text start="405.979" dur="7.29">happen already so it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s foreign so I think you&amp;#39;d see the</text>
  <text start="413.269" dur="4.14">price shoot up tremendously and but I</text>
  <text start="416.059" dur="3.03">also think you&amp;#39;d see so a lot of</text>
  <text start="417.409" dur="3.78">stability in the markets which I think</text>
  <text start="419.089" dur="3.81">would be good yeah might be volatile for</text>
  <text start="421.189" dur="4.32">a little bit but in the long run be a</text>
  <text start="422.899" dur="5.401">much better option yeah absolutely in</text>
  <text start="425.509" dur="4.83">speaking of the price of gold increasing</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="4.5">I saw an article on Zero Hedge just the</text>
  <text start="430.339" dur="4.771">other day talking about how these trade</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="3.81">wars going on you know another hot topic</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="4.349">another current event to talk about</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="3.57">these potential trade wars could very</text>
  <text start="439.459" dur="4.501">well in</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="5.549">prease the price of gold 14 $1,500 hmm</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="4.98">so what are your thoughts on these trade</text>
  <text start="445.729" dur="6.301">wars yeah I mean I I don&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="448.94" dur="3.509">listen I think that tariffs are never a</text>
  <text start="452.03" dur="2.91">good thing</text>
  <text start="452.449" dur="6.241">I don&amp;#39;t think increasing the cost of</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="6.36">what we pay for goods from China is just</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="5.819">gonna hurt us in terms of buying things</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="5.13">and also the backlash that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="464.509" dur="4.021">is that China&amp;#39;s is not happy with it and</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="4.34">and you know the more that we talk about</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="4.44">that I think it&amp;#39;s gonna hurt the economy</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="4.45">ultimately I understand we want to make</text>
  <text start="472.97" dur="4.71">our goods that we produce cheaper and</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="4.169">that&amp;#39;s a good idea but I I believe in</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="3.51">the free hand I believe that the economy</text>
  <text start="479.389" dur="4.471">should should run and I think that</text>
  <text start="481.19" dur="5.31">tariffs are not going to help us the</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="3.899">other thing is that China you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="486.5" dur="3.539">to poke the bear with China because</text>
  <text start="487.759" dur="4.53">China holds more of our Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="490.039" dur="5.581">than any other country in the world so</text>
  <text start="492.289" dur="5.371">what if they said we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="4.29">calling in these these Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="4.41">and you need to start paying these back</text>
  <text start="499.91" dur="4.56">they hope they hold a tremendous amount</text>
  <text start="502.07" dur="4.56">of our debt and there&amp;#39;s no way we could</text>
  <text start="504.47" dur="4.29">pay that back they can they could crush</text>
  <text start="506.63" dur="4.5">our economy if they basically said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="508.76" dur="3.779">calling in all these bonds or they start</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="3.99">selling the bond they just started</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="4.471">dumping our bonds on the market and</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="4.56">saying that they&amp;#39;re not worth what they</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="5.1">should be worth our market would would</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="5.58">be in turmoil so I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m concerned</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="6.78">that this could create a really unstable</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="5.519">market if we continue to push them and I</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="3.51">hope that I hope that a lot of this</text>
  <text start="530.779" dur="3">chatter just kind of drops down I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.4" dur="3.6">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s good for our economy</text>
  <text start="533.779" dur="3.511">I let the economy it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s moving let</text>
  <text start="536" dur="3.209">they kind of move the way it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="5.28">move to tariffs or in my opinion about</text>
  <text start="539.209" dur="6.12">it right and do you see precious metals</text>
  <text start="542.57" dur="4.41">as a potential way to protect oneself or</text>
  <text start="545.329" dur="3.241">what could happen yeah absolutely I</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="4.5">think that&amp;#39;s you know right now the</text>

  <text start="551.48" dur="3.87">all-time highs are close all-time highs</text>
  <text start="553.459" dur="3.87">so yeah we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of people</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="4.2">that are just taking a portion of their</text>
  <text start="557.329" dur="3.841">portfolio there they&amp;#39;re moving out of</text>
  <text start="559.55" dur="4.05">those equities and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="3.24">taking a position and metals and metals</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="5.13">are undervalued</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="7.21">I mean silver right now is 76% lower</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="5.61">than where it was 78 years</text>
  <text start="571.62" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s a bargain it really is and people</text>
  <text start="574.34" dur="4.33">miners call silver miners that we talked</text>
  <text start="576.96" dur="3.72">to say I don&amp;#39;t understand how Silver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="4.95">not even it should be minimum in the</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="5.01">mid-20s which would be a huge jump from</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.58">where it is today so we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of</text>
  <text start="585.69" dur="4.62">people take some positions and silver</text>
  <text start="588.2" dur="4">silver is also a great bartering</text>
  <text start="590.31" dur="3.42">instrument if we ever did go away from</text>
  <text start="592.2" dur="3.9">the dollar it&amp;#39;s easy because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="5.31">smaller price point for trading and</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="5.61">bartering but yeah I think silver is a</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="3.99">good buy and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a good way so</text>
  <text start="601.71" dur="4.44">yeah a lot of people are taking their</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="4.8">IRAs or 401ks a lot of people have old</text>
  <text start="606.15" dur="3.69">form caves they forgot about they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="607.83" dur="3.06">moving it into metals and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="4.05">gonna say you know what I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="610.89" dur="5.13">wait and see where things are going to</text>
  <text start="613.89" dur="4.26">go where the economies go and so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="4.29">selling high you know and equities and</text>
  <text start="618.15" dur="3.51">hopefully buying low in metals which is</text>
  <text start="620.31" dur="3.68">you know I think that&amp;#39;s what everybody</text>
  <text start="621.66" dur="4.83">tries to do well yeah I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.99" dur="4.24">that&amp;#39;s a good thing and as as we</text>
  <text start="626.49" dur="3.51">progress through these kind of turbulent</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="3.54">times we&amp;#39;ve got these bills being</text>
  <text start="630" dur="4.29">introduced but then these trade wars are</text>
  <text start="631.77" dur="5.04">just lots of stuff going on so what can</text>
  <text start="634.29" dur="4.53">the average person do say how much money</text>
  <text start="636.81" dur="3.48">to put aside to start investing and</text>
  <text start="638.82" dur="3.84">whatnot what can the average person do</text>
  <text start="640.29" dur="4.26">to start protecting themselves right now</text>
  <text start="642.66" dur="3.54">yeah I think what you need to do is you</text>
  <text start="644.55" dur="2.97">need it&amp;#39;s good time it&amp;#39;s tax time so</text>
  <text start="646.2" dur="2.46">everybody&amp;#39;s sort of looking they</text>
  <text start="647.52" dur="2.99">probably looked at their year in</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="4.59">statement from their 401k or their IRA</text>
  <text start="650.51" dur="4.96">and look and look at what returns you</text>
  <text start="653.25" dur="4.41">got last year and look where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="655.47" dur="4.2">invested in and decide if that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="657.66" dur="4.08">you want to be going forward I think the</text>
  <text start="659.67" dur="3.9">biggest thing that we tell people is</text>
  <text start="661.74" dur="3.39">that you want to get educated on your</text>

  <text start="666.93" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s been allowed since 1987 it is an</text>
  <text start="670.14" dur="5.16">option real estate it&amp;#39;s an option there</text>

  <text start="691.26" dur="3.81">control of your finances right now and</text>
  <text start="693.03" dur="5.16">you don&amp;#39;t want to be in a position where</text>

  <text start="840.09" dur="5.25">not supposed to lose so much value over</text>
  <text start="842.82" dur="4.92">time you know that&amp;#39;s why people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="845.34" dur="4.59">trade with with cattle anymore because</text>
  <text start="847.74" dur="3.51">you can make a trade and then maybe you</text>
