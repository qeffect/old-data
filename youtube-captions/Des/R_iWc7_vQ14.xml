  <text start="108.53" dur="4.02">at first I didn&amp;#39;t believe it because I</text>

  <text start="117.649" dur="8.22">was arrested in New Jersey yesterday by</text>

  <text start="153.62" dur="5.58">absolutely massive okay now here&amp;#39;s a few</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="4.11">thoughts of mine in a few details going</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="4.89">through this that I&amp;#39;ve just hadn&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="6.3">since this broke yesterday number one</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="6.39">I&amp;#39;m wondering if the recent NYPD quote</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="4.769">suicides you know what we have four or</text>
  <text start="170.48" dur="4.17">five individuals that have committed</text>
  <text start="172.519" dur="4.44">mysterious suicides in the NYPD in</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="5.7">recent weeks I&amp;#39;m wondering if these are</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="4.771">connected in some way to these arrests</text>
  <text start="180.35" dur="3.83">these indictments that are breaking in</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="4.41">the New York district they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="3.49">intriguing I&amp;#39;m wondering if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="4.86">connected I&amp;#39;m wondering if the deep date</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="5.52">was just trying to avoid this or avoid</text>
  <text start="191" dur="4.47">there an inevitable downfall in some way</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="4.019">how about that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="195.47" dur="4.74">appearance that she was supposed to do</text>
  <text start="197.209" dur="5.071">in October that she recently canceled um</text>
  <text start="200.21" dur="4.23">wondering if the clintons and many of</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="5.37">these deep state cabal folk know that</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="5.37">this arrest might soon turn into many</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="4.44">arrests so Hillary Clinton canceled her</text>
  <text start="209.81" dur="4.86">public appearance in October that she</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="5.37">was supposed to make there in DC mmm</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="5.7">they runnin in fact I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="217.46" dur="4.8">surprised if the Clintons or other</text>
  <text start="220.37" dur="4.08">individuals close to them started</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="4.71">claiming medical issues or claiming</text>
  <text start="224.45" dur="4.91">health problems soon you know to avoid</text>
  <text start="226.97" dur="5.43">the prosecution and slip out of the</text>
  <text start="229.36" dur="5.5">public awareness and also we need to</text>
  <text start="232.4" dur="6.15">keep some keen eyes on that prosecution</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="6.96">I saw a piece of data saying that it was</text>
  <text start="238.55" dur="6.33">James commis daughter has actually been</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="6">named as a prosecutor on this case James</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="6.78">commis daughters so we need to keep very</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="7.8">keen eyes on this this whole situation</text>
  <text start="251.66" dur="5.73">how this court case unveils being there</text>
  <text start="255.62" dur="4.32">in the Southern District of New York as</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="5.25">well I&amp;#39;m hoping there&amp;#39;s not any sort of</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="4.98">crooked prosecutors or crooked judges in</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="3.75">on this case but but of course because</text>
  <text start="264.92" dur="3.78">of how many citizen journalists are out</text>
  <text start="266.39" dur="5.12">there now there&amp;#39;s gonna be so many eyes</text>
  <text start="268.7" dur="5.61">on this so I don&amp;#39;t think any sort of</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="4.93">ridiculous antics can be had by the deep</text>
  <text start="274.31" dur="5.25">state on this one but nevertheless eyes</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="6.21">open on all that and how about Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="6.39">flubs earlier in the week and by flubs I</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="6.18">mean on Twitter he misspelled Air Force</text>
  <text start="285.95" dur="6.15">One as aircraft one and then during his</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="5.07">fourth of July speech he messed up a</text>
  <text start="292.1" dur="4.71">little bit he was talking about the Army</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="5.34">in the 1800s and mentioned that the army</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="4.76">was taking over airports so there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="5.97">aircraft misspelled in his tweet and</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="5.71">airports sort of miss mentioned in his</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="3.57">speech you know I&amp;#39;m wondering if he was</text>
  <text start="307.28" dur="3.57">sort of alluding to the fact that</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="5.64">Jeffrey Epstein would be arrested as he</text>
  <text start="310.85" dur="5.07">got off his aircraft at the airport in</text>
  <text start="314.42" dur="3.75">some way so I&amp;#39;m wondering if those were</text>
  <text start="315.92" dur="4.26">some sort of subtle messages that he was</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="4.11">putting out there you know just in Crete</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="4.65">intriguing dots connecting in my head</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="5.31">with all this and lastly the mainstream</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="5.25">media is trying to drag Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="327.59" dur="5.49">down with Epstein I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="3.78">headlines in the mainstream media just</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="4.26">today</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="5.22">saying that Trump pal Jeffrey Epstein or</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="3.57">Trump is in some way connected to</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="3.51">Jeffrey Epstein you know they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="340.91" dur="4.71">trying to muddy the waters as much as</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="5.04">they can at this point and get ahead of</text>
  <text start="345.62" dur="4.05">the story I believe it was The Daily</text>
  <text start="347.63" dur="3.51">Beast that first reported on it and then</text>
  <text start="349.67" dur="3.06">it quickly moved through a lot of</text>
  <text start="351.14" dur="3.78">mainstream media you know they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="352.73" dur="4.44">doing what they can to manage the</text>
  <text start="354.92" dur="5.73">narrative with all this so we need to be</text>
  <text start="357.17" dur="6.27">very action-oriented we need to be out</text>
  <text start="360.65" dur="5.31">there sharing the information that well</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="3.27">Jeffrey Epstein was actually banned from</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="2.55">mar-a-lago</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="4.65">because Trump found out that Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="368.51" dur="5.31">Epstein was basically hitting on or</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="4.74">sexually assaulting young women there so</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="4.77">this is stuff that we need to share as</text>
  <text start="376.1" dur="4.14">citizen journalists to get the more true</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="3.45">narratives out there and not let the</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="4.68">mainstream media take control of it all</text>
  <text start="382.04" dur="6.09">but that&amp;#39;s all I have on the Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="384.92" dur="4.71">Epstein situation right now as I get</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="3.33">home I&amp;#39;ll be able to research a lot more</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="3.72">of this and share it more on it but</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="2.79">those are just a few details and a few</text>
  <text start="393.35" dur="3.21">thoughts in my mind</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="5.31">let&amp;#39;s keep close eyes on this who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="4.83">involved in the prosecution and not let</text>
  <text start="399.56" dur="3.33">the mainstream media control that</text>
  <text start="401.39" dur="3.45">narrative with all of this but</text>
  <text start="402.89" dur="4.44">nevertheless I would imagine that a lot</text>
  <text start="404.84" dur="4.62">of arrests are coming this summer this</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="4.8">year it&amp;#39;s gonna be very fun to track all</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="4.65">of this so now let&amp;#39;s get into the sealed</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="5.16">court records that I want to share with</text>
  <text start="414.11" dur="8.49">you that new number that we have is one</text>
  <text start="417.29" dur="8.49">hundred and 6502 sealed court records</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="4.92">from across the country and quick point</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="4.8">on that I&amp;#39;m not calling them sealed</text>
  <text start="427.52" dur="5.64">indictments anymore because some of</text>
  <text start="430.58" dur="5.28">these could be court records for other</text>
  <text start="433.16" dur="5.31">things that are still sealed and asked</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="7.61">you mentioned in a post in recent months</text>
  <text start="438.47" dur="10.46">not all of these cases are USA versus</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="7.99">some unnamed individual so little more</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="4.63">logical a little more detail oriented to</text>
  <text start="451.46" dur="4.86">call it sealed court records but</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="5.94">nevertheless 106,000 that number is</text>
  <text start="456.32" dur="5.4">still growing by over 5,000 about per</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="3.75">month and this has been going on for 20</text>
  <text start="461.72" dur="3.54">months you would think if these were</text>
  <text start="463.25" dur="4.17">just routine matters that these would</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="3.84">get sealed and unsealed in a</text>
  <text start="467.42" dur="4.14">work time and this number would not</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="5.07">continuously grow so big news they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="4.02">definitely sharing it here now let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="3.03">into some of those cryptic statements</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="4.98">that President Trump has been making on</text>
  <text start="477.2" dur="6.36">various topics recently number one how</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="5.73">about Trump offering cryptic detail</text>
  <text start="483.56" dur="3.6">after Mike Pence cancels New Hampshire</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="4.65">trip</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="6.6">so last week very mysterious situation</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="4.68">Mike Pence was supposed to travel on Air</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="3.48">Force two to New Hampshire but as he was</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="3.75">getting on the plane they canceled his</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="3.96">trip we don&amp;#39;t know why President Trump</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="3.87">actually said that we&amp;#39;re gonna know in</text>
  <text start="501.2" dur="3.9">about two weeks and it was a very</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="3.66">interesting problem there in New</text>
  <text start="505.1" dur="5.43">Hampshire that&amp;#39;s all he said on the</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="5.97">situation so eyes on this two weeks we</text>
  <text start="510.53" dur="4.8">might find out what happened I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="4.77">interested to see what Mike Pence might</text>
  <text start="515.33" dur="4.59">be really about you know we&amp;#39;ll see if</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="5.31">Mike Pence will be there for the second</text>
  <text start="519.92" dur="4.86">term or not and I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="522.95" dur="3.75">still have the question in their minds</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="4.86">is Mike Pence a white hat is he a black</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="4.17">Pat black hat for me in particular you</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="2.49">know I have no idea</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="2.88">I just haven&amp;#39;t researched into that</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="4.77">enough to draw a conclusion in my own</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="5.25">head so myself I&amp;#39;m interested to see</text>
  <text start="536.9" dur="4.64">what we&amp;#39;re gonna learn about that New</text>
  <text start="539" dur="4.92">Hampshire trip and about Mike Pence and</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="4.96">then Trump&amp;#39;s comments on the Federal</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="4.77">Reserve so Trump tweeting hitting at the</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="3.81">Federal Reserve yet again saying the</text>
  <text start="548.69" dur="4.62">Federal Reserve at the is the most</text>
  <text start="550.31" dur="5.58">difficult problem facing America right</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="4.29">now never in my life would I have</text>
  <text start="555.89" dur="6.27">thought to see a President of the United</text>
  <text start="557.6" dur="7.17">States attack go against the Federal</text>
  <text start="562.16" dur="5.66">Reserve which of course is not federal</text>
  <text start="564.77" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s a private entity outside of</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="4.27">governmental oversight so it&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="570.92" dur="2.22">it&amp;#39;s great that our president is</text>
  <text start="572.09" dur="2.58">attacking the Federal Reserve because</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="4.95">the Federal Reserve has raised interest</text>
  <text start="574.67" dur="6.42">rates seven times seven times during</text>
  <text start="578.09" dur="5.13">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s presidency and if that</text>
  <text start="581.09" dur="4.71">wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened our economy would</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="4.38">be much much higher than it is right now</text>
  <text start="585.8" dur="4.32">and I mean our economy is already</text>
  <text start="587.6" dur="3.78">gaining speed so just imagine where we</text>
  <text start="590.12" dur="3">would be at if the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="4.17">wasn&amp;#39;t trying to stifle everything so no</text>
  <text start="593.12" dur="4.26">doubt Donald Trump attacking the Federal</text>
  <text start="595.55" dur="4.23">Reserve right now as he has every right</text>
  <text start="597.38" dur="3.48">to do and I&amp;#39;m very intrigued to see</text>
  <text start="599.78" dur="3.54">what&amp;#39;s going to happen over the</text>
  <text start="600.86" dur="6">couple of years ask you said gold is</text>
  <text start="603.32" dur="5.31">gonna end the Fed I think bringing back</text>
  <text start="606.86" dur="3.21">a gold standard and really trying to</text>
  <text start="608.63" dur="5.52">restructure that Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="610.07" dur="6.27">gonna be a second term issue for</text>
  <text start="614.15" dur="3.45">president Trump and very excited to see</text>
  <text start="616.34" dur="4.11">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen with all that and</text>
  <text start="617.6" dur="7.05">then one last Trump comment to talk</text>
  <text start="620.45" dur="6.12">about his opinion on UFOs so Tucker</text>
  <text start="624.65" dur="4.02">Carlson aired an interview that he did</text>
  <text start="626.57" dur="4.59">with Donald Trump are basically aired</text>
  <text start="628.67" dur="6.57">what wasn&amp;#39;t aired before with that</text>
  <text start="631.16" dur="6.57">interview of djt and they actually aired</text>
  <text start="635.24" dur="6.63">the question that Tucker asked Donald</text>
  <text start="637.73" dur="6.41">Trump about UFOs and Donald Trump has</text>
  <text start="641.87" dur="4.59">been navigating this situation</text>
  <text start="644.14" dur="5.02">beautifully he has to tiptoe it right</text>
  <text start="646.46" dur="6.06">now okay you got to understand if Donald</text>
  <text start="649.16" dur="5.7">Trump were to openly discuss the reality</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="4.92">of UFOs what that would do is it would</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="5.61">feed a lot of energy to the deep state</text>
  <text start="657.44" dur="4.65">limited hangout partial disclosure UFO</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="3.45">initiative that I&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="662.09" dur="2.85">for so long basically everything we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.92" dur="3.63">seeing in the Manor media right now</text>
  <text start="664.94" dur="5.21">regarding UFOs that the to the Stars</text>
  <text start="667.55" dur="4.86">Academy Tom DeLonge is spearheading</text>
  <text start="670.15" dur="3.97">connected to Harry Reid John Podesta</text>
  <text start="672.41" dur="2.73">etcetera I mean it&amp;#39;s totally deep state</text>
  <text start="674.12" dur="3.39">fingerprints all over it</text>
  <text start="675.14" dur="4.92">Donald Trump doesn&amp;#39;t want to legitimize</text>
  <text start="677.51" dur="3.96">that deep state UFO disclosure so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="680.06" dur="3.51">kind of tiptoeing this he&amp;#39;s saying oh I</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t really believe it but at the same</text>
  <text start="683.57" dur="3.75">time he doesn&amp;#39;t want to lie to the</text>
  <text start="685.13" dur="4.95">public of course there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="4.41">information on UFOs that I&amp;#39;m sure the</text>
  <text start="690.08" dur="2.88">Alliance of the white hats they want to</text>
  <text start="691.73" dur="2.79">get out of the public they just have to</text>
  <text start="692.96" dur="3.27">be really careful doing it right now and</text>
  <text start="694.52" dur="3.93">Donald Trump you know he&amp;#39;s not throwing</text>
  <text start="696.23" dur="4.98">it all out he goes yeah I guess I guess</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="4.5">anything&amp;#39;s possible basically but he</text>
  <text start="701.21" dur="3.21">basically says I&amp;#39;m not a believer so</text>
  <text start="702.95" dur="3.09">like I said he&amp;#39;s navigating this</text>
  <text start="704.42" dur="3.57">beautifully he&amp;#39;s not giving any energy</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="3.99">or legitimacy to the deep state UFO</text>
  <text start="707.99" dur="5.34">disclosures but he&amp;#39;s still keeping it</text>
  <text start="710.03" dur="6.24">open for the public to scratch our heads</text>
  <text start="713.33" dur="6.21">in question and not writing it all off</text>
  <text start="716.27" dur="5.55">which is great so there&amp;#39;s that right</text>
  <text start="719.54" dur="4.71">there and I like the fact that he said</text>
  <text start="721.82" dur="4.41">this answer to Tucker Carlson you know</text>
  <text start="724.25" dur="3.63">George papadopolis was asking him about</text>
  <text start="726.23" dur="4.53">UFOs in the White House during their</text>
  <text start="727.88" dur="5.82">interview a few weeks ago and George</text>
  <text start="730.76" dur="3.54">papadopolis does not deserve an honest</text>
  <text start="733.7" dur="2.7">answer</text>
  <text start="734.3" dur="4.83">about that particular question so Trump</text>
  <text start="736.4" dur="5.37">more sidestepped him gave Tucker Carlson</text>
  <text start="739.13" dur="4.56">a little bit more open of an answer here</text>
  <text start="741.77" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s something that I noticed with</text>
  <text start="743.69" dur="7.55">this and you know a lot more space force</text>
  <text start="748.4" dur="5.64">is going to be discussed by Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="751.24" dur="4.63">space secret space programs bringing</text>
  <text start="754.04" dur="4.43">these technologies out I would imagine</text>
  <text start="755.87" dur="4.32">is one of the top priorities of the</text>
  <text start="758.47" dur="4.06">Alliance of this presidential</text>
  <text start="760.19" dur="4.32">administration and we could see a lot</text>
  <text start="762.53" dur="4.38">more of that again in Trump&amp;#39;s second</text>
  <text start="764.51" dur="4.23">term as well so good news with that and</text>
  <text start="766.91" dur="4.14">then last couple of articles that I had</text>
  <text start="768.74" dur="5.1">to share with you number one on vaccines</text>
  <text start="771.05" dur="6.6">this says here scientists claim to have</text>
  <text start="773.84" dur="7.26">developed the world&amp;#39;s first vaccine with</text>
  <text start="777.65" dur="5.79">artificial intelligence does that sound</text>
  <text start="781.1" dur="5.16">good in any way shape or form no it does</text>
  <text start="783.44" dur="5.31">not an AI developed vaccine and get this</text>
  <text start="786.26" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re calling it a quote turbocharged</text>
  <text start="788.75" dur="3.45">blue vaccine</text>
  <text start="790.22" dur="5.58">so whatever AI program they&amp;#39;ve developed</text>
  <text start="792.2" dur="5.52">went through and it created some sort of</text>
  <text start="795.8" dur="5.73">like turbocharged flu vaccine</text>
  <text start="797.72" dur="5.79">I ain&amp;#39;t injecting that I&amp;#39;ve truly hope</text>
  <text start="801.53" dur="4.2">that you don&amp;#39;t inject that and I truly</text>
  <text start="803.51" dur="3.84">hope that you don&amp;#39;t really inject any of</text>
  <text start="805.73" dur="5.16">these vaccines I don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s made</text>
  <text start="807.35" dur="6.21">by humans made by AI they&amp;#39;re all bunk</text>
  <text start="810.89" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re all just horribly toxic and what</text>
  <text start="813.56" dur="4.05">an AI developing a vaccine they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="815.54" dur="4.5">try to inject nanobots in you some sort</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="5.22">of nano particles actually many vaccines</text>
  <text start="820.04" dur="5.91">out there already have nanoparticles in</text>
  <text start="822.83" dur="6.12">them some tests have found that little</text>
  <text start="825.95" dur="4.65">do these scientists doctors you know</text>
  <text start="828.95" dur="3.81">many of these people even know that</text>
  <text start="830.6" dur="5.52">nanoparticles are in them among many</text>
  <text start="832.76" dur="5.58">other toxic compounds so that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="836.12" dur="3.75">creepy stuff man creepy stuff they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="838.34" dur="2.94">trying to sell vaccines in any way shape</text>
  <text start="839.87" dur="3.66">or form they can to the public right now</text>
  <text start="841.28" dur="3.84">because so many people are waking up and</text>
  <text start="843.53" dur="3.51">questioning the vaccine so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="845.12" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re seeing vaccines so much propaganda</text>
  <text start="847.04" dur="3.75">about them in the mainstream media every</text>
  <text start="848.99" dur="4.17">day and that&amp;#39;s also why I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="850.79" dur="5.01">about it on this channel as much as I</text>
  <text start="853.16" dur="4.2">can and then last hit piece on natural</text>
  <text start="855.8" dur="3.93">health we have this one by Business</text>
  <text start="857.36" dur="6.18">Insider Business Insider has basically</text>
  <text start="859.73" dur="6.57">been the mainstream media outlet the one</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="4.59">they are going to to attack MMS to</text>
  <text start="866.3" dur="4.86">attack chlorine dioxide</text>
  <text start="868.13" dur="5.55">remember YouTube censored they deleted</text>
  <text start="871.16" dur="4.65">my video on MMS a few months ago is</text>
  <text start="873.68" dur="5.099">actually one of the most popular videos</text>
  <text start="875.81" dur="5.519">on YouTube about chlorine dioxide and I</text>
  <text start="878.779" dur="4.771">was discussing it truthfully so the deep</text>
  <text start="881.329" dur="4.081">state is using Business Insider as their</text>
  <text start="883.55" dur="5.49">main stream media mouthpiece to attack</text>
  <text start="885.41" dur="6.57">MMS and this is just awful again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="889.04" dur="4.919">calling it a toxic bleach they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="891.98" dur="4.409">it&amp;#39;s scientifically worthless just a lot</text>
  <text start="893.959" dur="5.401">of fake propaganda if MMS was toxic</text>
  <text start="896.389" dur="4.351">bleach or chlorine dioxide was toxic</text>
  <text start="899.36" dur="3.479">bleach how can you buy potable water</text>
  <text start="900.74" dur="5.82">tablets with the active ingredient being</text>
  <text start="902.839" dur="5.37">chlorine dioxide at REI on Amazon how is</text>
  <text start="906.56" dur="3.719">there a market out there that a lot of</text>
  <text start="908.209" dur="5.701">pharmaceutical companies are invested in</text>
  <text start="910.279" dur="6.81">for chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant</text>
  <text start="913.91" dur="5.4">right it&amp;#39;s only called a toxic bleach by</text>
  <text start="917.089" dur="3.661">the FDA and by The Lying mainstream</text>
  <text start="919.31" dur="3.41">media so you can understand what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="920.75" dur="4.47">trying to do with your brain right there</text>
  <text start="922.72" dur="4.45">so there&amp;#39;s a lot more you can research</text>
  <text start="925.22" dur="4.41">on chlorine dioxide and MMS I would</text>
  <text start="927.17" dur="4.89">imagine that this academic this doctor</text>
  <text start="929.63" dur="4.5">here who lost his title after his study</text>
  <text start="932.06" dur="3.959">was branded scientifically worthless his</text>
  <text start="934.13" dur="2.579">study was likely very scientifically</text>
  <text start="936.019" dur="2.281">sound</text>
  <text start="936.709" dur="3.601">they just stripped him of his title they</text>
