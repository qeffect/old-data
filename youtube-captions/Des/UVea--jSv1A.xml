  <text start="0.14" dur="4.15">how&amp;#39;s it going there guys Jordan here</text>
  <text start="2.73" dur="3.54">and what do you make of this new</text>
  <text start="4.29" dur="3.33">background that I got here for my videos</text>
  <text start="6.27" dur="4.499">right it&amp;#39;s pretty neat</text>
  <text start="7.62" dur="5.25">I like the cosmic and tree theme you</text>
  <text start="10.769" dur="5.18">know me being from the Pacific Northwest</text>
  <text start="12.87" dur="6.419">I like the trees and I like space and</text>
  <text start="15.949" dur="5.261">speaking of space one thing that as you</text>
  <text start="19.289" dur="6">obviously know I talk about all the time</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="5.76">is the secret space program and it&amp;#39;s fun</text>
  <text start="25.289" dur="3.33">to ponder right that&amp;#39;s why I love</text>
  <text start="26.97" dur="4.17">thinking about it talking about it</text>
  <text start="28.619" dur="4.861">because there&amp;#39;s all kinds of things you</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="4.95">can speculate as to what goes on in</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="4.47">these unacknowledged or black projects</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="4.53">that the military and different</text>
  <text start="37.95" dur="3.92">corporations have there&amp;#39;s anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="40.62" dur="5.009">technologies that have been around</text>
  <text start="41.87" dur="5.5">decades and this then leads to oh my</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="4.02">gosh free energy that stuff actually</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="4.829">exists you know and then you think of</text>
  <text start="49.649" dur="5.011">all the other technologies and I mean we</text>
  <text start="52.199" dur="4.081">could literally be living in Star Trek</text>
  <text start="54.66" dur="4.02">you know a Star Trek reality that</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="5.73">absolutely you know can&amp;#39;t exist and</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="4.98">already does exist so it&amp;#39;s fun to ponder</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="3.27">granted it makes you kind of angry</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="5.22">because we don&amp;#39;t have access to these</text>
  <text start="65.28" dur="5.159">technologies yet but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s exciting</text>
  <text start="68.88" dur="5.13">because of all these things I just</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="8.43">mentioned but at the same time it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="8.149">very dark and there are some very not</text>
  <text start="78.869" dur="5.43">fun things to think about you know and</text>
  <text start="82.159" dur="4.931">of course we&amp;#39;re dealing with the</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="4.551">military-industrial complex so granted</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="5.58">you can only imagine what kind of</text>
  <text start="88.85" dur="6.159">nefarious stuff goes on in projects that</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.29">are off the books let alone with stuff</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="3.9">the military-industrial complex does in</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="3.36">classified programs on the books but</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re talking about unacknowledged stuff</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="7.5">here so you know you can only imagine</text>
  <text start="102.659" dur="7.831">dark dark things go on and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="6">holding on to an interview now for a few</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="6.199">weeks and I&amp;#39;ve now feeling that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="6.36">right time to release that interview to</text>
  <text start="116.689" dur="5.86">blow up you know everything going on in</text>
  <text start="120.18" dur="4.74">the secret space programs not only the</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="5.221">fun stuff but all of those dark things</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="7.77">and this interview is with none other</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="6.99">than niara Eisley and Mira Isley is a</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="4.92">who used to be in the Air Force she was</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="5.04">in the Air Force for a few years early</text>
  <text start="137.61" dur="3.36">on in life and then she proceeded to you</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="3.78">know get out of the Air Force and carry</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="6.51">on with her life but as time progressed</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="7.74">she kept trying to remember her time in</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="7.41">the Air Force and when she was trying to</text>
  <text start="151.32" dur="5.01">remember a specific stint of where she</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="3.69">knew she was at what she literally had</text>
  <text start="156.33" dur="5.19">no recollection of any time at this</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="4.17">specific place she she kept trying to</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="3.48">remember and she couldn&amp;#39;t and this</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="3.57">bothered her so if she went through some</text>
  <text start="165" dur="4.56">different processes to try to</text>
  <text start="166.32" dur="5.01">essentially regain back her memories she</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="3.51">knew were there she knew were under the</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="3.93">surface but she couldn&amp;#39;t consciously</text>
  <text start="173.07" dur="4.98">perceive and she finally did some</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="4.62">hypnotic regression and through doing</text>
  <text start="178.05" dur="3.51">this hypnotic regression she was</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="3.21">actually able to get back a lot of these</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="6.06">missing memories of her time in the Air</text>
  <text start="183.09" dur="7.11">Force and they shocked her the I mean</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="4.29">she had at that before this no</text>
  <text start="190.2" dur="3.54">recollection of what secret space</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="3.87">programs or shadow government operations</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="7.14">were but through regaining these</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="6.84">memories she did and you know it was it</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="3.6">haunted her and shocked her it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="3.96">her of course getting back all these</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="5.16">memories of her time in unacknowledged</text>
  <text start="206.58" dur="5.37">projects and as being what&amp;#39;s been termed</text>
  <text start="209.64" dur="4.38">as a my lab or a military abduction</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="5.85">being taken into these secret programs</text>
  <text start="214.02" dur="5.76">and you know through learning all of</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="4.56">this it also of course led to a</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="6.959">spiritual awakening of hers because it</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="6.33">it broke her in a way but it allowed her</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="4.321">to find the truth and then to begin</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="4.11">healing herself and then she began a</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="5.19">journey of not only healing herself but</text>
  <text start="232.8" dur="6.51">learning how to then help heal others as</text>

  <text start="516.539" dur="8.91">like a wave of nausea come over me when</text>
  <text start="521.189" dur="5.971">I thought about it and you know I just</text>
  <text start="525.449" dur="5.611">looked stricken and my friend is looking</text>
  <text start="527.16" dur="7.26">at me and he tried to lighten the mood</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="4.86">because of the way I looked and he was</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="4.32">just kidding around but it was a really</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="5.49">bad joke he says you know I&amp;#39;m from the</text>

  <text start="553.769" dur="7.92">which isn&amp;#39;t all that off and he&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="555.3" dur="7.95">apologized so anyway I had that come up</text>
  <text start="561.689" dur="4.861">and I just thought well whatever</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="6.089">happened it&amp;#39;s scary that I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="6.06">remember it especially feeling nausea at</text>
  <text start="569.339" dur="6.871">the thought that I can&amp;#39;t remember and it</text>
  <text start="572.61" dur="8.52">was later on I think that year</text>
  <text start="576.21" dur="6.54">or the next year it was in 1994 that I</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="4.56">ranted about Hopkins at the whole life</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="5.52">Expo in Las Vegas Nevada and I went to</text>
  <text start="585.69" dur="5.82">his presentation and at the end of it I</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="5.34">raised my hand and I said I have these</text>
  <text start="591.51" dur="5.85">strange experiences from childhood</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="5.76">strange dreams I had another experience</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="4.979">where I woke up and something was in the</text>
  <text start="599.37" dur="5.25">room with me this was before I went into</text>
  <text start="602.339" dur="3.481">the military and then I have three</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="3.719">months of missing time in the military</text>
  <text start="605.82" dur="4.17">where I have no idea what happened to me</text>
  <text start="608.339" dur="3.211">during those three months and he said</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="4.469">talk to me after we&amp;#39;re done here</text>
  <text start="611.55" dur="5.61">so I did and he did hypnosis session</text>
  <text start="614.459" dur="5.911">with me that night and at least a piece</text>
  <text start="617.16" dur="6.09">of the story came tumbling out nothing</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="5.339">about the sexual assaults at that time</text>
  <text start="623.25" dur="4.02">but what I did remember was disturbing</text>
  <text start="625.709" dur="6.331">enough I was taken out in the middle of</text>
  <text start="627.27" dur="7.65">the night to test the radar on UFOs on</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="5.1">special aircraft I didn&amp;#39;t see until I</text>
  <text start="634.92" dur="6.96">was out of the radar van then I saw what</text>
  <text start="637.14" dur="7.05">was in the sky and it was disc shaped</text>
  <text start="641.88" dur="4.44">objects glowing orange on the bottom at</text>
  <text start="644.19" dur="5.24">least the one closest I really focused</text>
  <text start="646.32" dur="6.06">on the one closest because I wanted to</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="5.56">you know imprint every detail of what I</text>
  <text start="652.38" dur="4.35">would see him and I was scared that I</text>
  <text start="654.99" dur="3.48">was seeing it because I only had a</text>
  <text start="656.73" dur="4.609">secret security clearance and I thought</text>
  <text start="658.47" dur="5.22">what I&amp;#39;m seeing his way about top secret</text>
  <text start="661.339" dur="4.721">so I didn&amp;#39;t really understand why they</text>
  <text start="663.69" dur="3.45">took me out there to show me such stuff</text>
  <text start="666.06" dur="3.99">when I can&amp;#39;t have the right</text>
  <text start="667.14" dur="4.02">classification but that&amp;#39;s because they</text>
  <text start="670.05" dur="7.83">knew that they were going to be working</text>
  <text start="671.16" dur="7.85">me over with drugs and trauma mm-hmm and</text>
  <text start="677.88" dur="4.38">[Music]</text>
  <text start="679.01" dur="5.35">and that I wouldn&amp;#39;t when they were done</text>
  <text start="682.26" dur="6.6">with me I wouldn&amp;#39;t remember anything so</text>
  <text start="684.36" dur="8.66">that&amp;#39;s kind of how it went and then</text>
  <text start="688.86" dur="7.4">later on it took me from 1994 to 2003</text>
  <text start="693.02" dur="7.99">before I felt like I could look at more</text>
  <text start="696.26" dur="9.01">so 2003 I met a lady who lives in New</text>
  <text start="701.01" dur="6.42">Mexico and she did hypnosis and I felt</text>
  <text start="705.27" dur="4.86">comfortable enough with her to undergo</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="6.03">hypnosis with her and we did two such to</text>
  <text start="710.13" dur="5.04">long sessions over two days and a lot of</text>
  <text start="713.46" dur="4.44">the rest of the story came out and the</text>
  <text start="715.17" dur="6.27">transcripts are in my book mm-hmm and</text>
  <text start="717.9" dur="5.84">that was the most graceful way that I</text>
  <text start="721.44" dur="4.38">could put what happened to me in my book</text>
  <text start="723.74" dur="13.39">without getting into a lot of graphic</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="15.15">ugliness and it&amp;#39;s it still haunts me to</text>
  <text start="737.13" dur="5.73">this day and it&amp;#39;s one of those things</text>
  <text start="740.97" dur="3.27">you know especially the things that</text>
  <text start="742.86" dur="2.58">happened on the moon a lot of people</text>
  <text start="744.24" dur="3">want to know what happened on the moon</text>
  <text start="745.44" dur="5.91">but I can tell you a few interesting</text>
  <text start="747.24" dur="6.54">things about it I was taken there most</text>
  <text start="751.35" dur="6.35">of the time I did manual labor there was</text>
  <text start="753.78" dur="8.46">one point where I operated some kind of</text>
  <text start="757.7" dur="7.06">very ultra-modern excavation equipment</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="5.76">as if they were excavating a place on</text>
  <text start="764.76" dur="5.28">the moon to put another building and it</text>
  <text start="768" dur="6.2">that was interesting what it seemed to</text>
  <text start="770.04" dur="7.14">be it was too was too big</text>
  <text start="774.2" dur="6.58">electromagnetic play plates that were</text>
  <text start="777.18" dur="6.09">somehow sunk into the ground and then</text>
  <text start="780.78" dur="5.16">when you turned on the plates they would</text>
  <text start="783.27" dur="5.1">both be generating like you know how</text>
  <text start="785.94" dur="5.28">North Pole and South Pole attract but</text>
  <text start="788.37" dur="5.79">north and north up repelled mm-hmm so</text>
  <text start="791.22" dur="4.68">they would set up a repelling field and</text>
  <text start="794.16" dur="4.86">it would just push those plates apart</text>
  <text start="795.9" dur="5.04">and as they came apart he would excavate</text>
  <text start="799.02" dur="4.89">a total flat place where they could put</text>
  <text start="800.94" dur="5.63">another building gotcha</text>
  <text start="803.91" dur="5.85">so that was some of the stuff that I</text>
  <text start="806.57" dur="5.35">worked on and then at night and this is</text>
  <text start="809.76" dur="4.56">another thing that is common to</text>
  <text start="811.92" dur="10.47">trauma-based mind control not allowing</text>
  <text start="814.32" dur="11.1">people to sleep and so I&amp;#39;ve had sleep</text>
  <text start="822.39" dur="7.41">issues for a very long time so anyway I</text>
  <text start="825.42" dur="7.92">wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to sleep and I was I was</text>
  <text start="829.8" dur="6.05">passed around from man to man for more</text>
  <text start="833.34" dur="7.34">sexual assault with the one rule was</text>
  <text start="835.85" dur="4.83">leave no marks and</text>
  <text start="842.17" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s probably the worst of it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="843.85" dur="4.8">the worst memory that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the book</text>
  <text start="846.85" dur="5.7">the most we need to go into right here</text>
  <text start="848.65" dur="5.64">so it&amp;#39;s a very very dark story for those</text>
  <text start="852.55" dur="5.91">of you who aren&amp;#39;t familiar with with</text>
  <text start="854.29" dur="6.69">nearest story but it&amp;#39;s me a lot today</text>
  <text start="858.46" dur="5.01">because with all the sleep issues I have</text>
  <text start="860.98" dur="4.86">and the noise at this place I live that</text>
  <text start="863.47" dur="5.19">keeps me awake a lot in the middle of</text>
  <text start="865.84" dur="4.68">the night it&amp;#39;s very hard to keep those</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="3.54">memories locked in their little door in</text>
  <text start="870.52" dur="8.43">the back of my mind when I&amp;#39;m up in the</text>
  <text start="872.2" dur="8.37">middle of the night so just not even</text>
  <text start="878.95" dur="3.96">being able to sleep as a big trigger</text>
  <text start="880.57" dur="4.86">besides the other things lack of sleep</text>
  <text start="882.91" dur="4.23">does to a person yeah you know and in</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="4.17">discussing these black projects of</text>
  <text start="887.14" dur="4.74">course there&amp;#39;s a lot of fun stuff to</text>
  <text start="889.6" dur="5.1">research like technologies and whatnot</text>
  <text start="891.88" dur="5.19">but there&amp;#39;s also a lot of bad stuff that</text>
  <text start="894.7" dur="6.9">comes along with it so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="897.07" dur="7.05">what needs to be known interesting when</text>
  <text start="901.6" dur="4.68">I got there I remember I was instructed</text>
  <text start="904.12" dur="2.58">to walk directly to the building did not</text>
  <text start="906.28" dur="2.19">look right</text>
  <text start="906.7" dur="5.52">do not look left do not look up or down</text>
  <text start="908.47" dur="7.17">so I I did that but I was you know me</text>
  <text start="912.22" dur="5.49">being me I was thinking okay I&amp;#39;m on the</text>
  <text start="915.64" dur="6.03">moon supposedly that&amp;#39;s what they tell me</text>
  <text start="917.71" dur="5.58">and I can breathe and is there a dome up</text>
  <text start="921.67" dur="5.01">there so I&amp;#39;m like stretching my eyes</text>
  <text start="923.29" dur="4.68">like this you know to look up to see if</text>
  <text start="926.68" dur="3.93">there is I could tell if there was a</text>
  <text start="927.97" dur="4.56">dome I didn&amp;#39;t I couldn&amp;#39;t tell that there</text>
  <text start="930.61" dur="4.2">really was through the way I was trying</text>
  <text start="932.53" dur="3.84">to look but they did a hypnosis session</text>
  <text start="934.81" dur="4.26">with another quantum healing hypnosis</text>
  <text start="936.37" dur="5.64">practitioner that I trade sessions with</text>
  <text start="939.07" dur="5.13">from sometimes and I and I asked the</text>
  <text start="942.01" dur="5.04">question of my Higher Self during that</text>
  <text start="944.2" dur="5.55">session and I said so was there a dome</text>
  <text start="947.05" dur="4.92">on the moon or was there air and I</text>
  <text start="949.75" dur="5.7">didn&amp;#39;t get a verbal response what I got</text>
  <text start="951.97" dur="5.82">was an image of this brownish green</text>
  <text start="955.45" dur="4.83">algae growing on the surface of the</text>
  <text start="957.79" dur="4.14">meadow and it grows really good in the</text>
  <text start="960.28" dur="4.08">cracks and crevices where the Sun</text>
  <text start="961.93" dur="7.59">doesn&amp;#39;t hit it directly and it makes air</text>
  <text start="964.36" dur="8.4">and so I think that there is a thin</text>
  <text start="969.52" dur="7.05">atmosphere on the moon a thin but but</text>
  <text start="972.76" dur="6.94">mostly breathable atmosphere breathable</text>
  <text start="976.57" dur="5.02">interesting yeah so just for that which</text>
  <text start="979.7" dur="4.97">what other people say and I recently</text>
  <text start="981.59" dur="7.14">bumped into Brett Collins Shepherd at a</text>
  <text start="984.67" dur="6.55">Dulce New Mexico conference and I talked</text>
  <text start="988.73" dur="3.69">to him about that bad algae and he said</text>
  <text start="991.22" dur="3.42">that he had heard of it before</text>
  <text start="992.42" dur="4.74">so there&amp;#39;s another little connecting</text>
  <text start="994.64" dur="4.26">point mm-hmm and you start getting a lot</text>
  <text start="997.16" dur="4.59">of these corroborated data points and it</text>
  <text start="998.9" dur="4.89">really makes you confirm your own story</text>
  <text start="1001.75" dur="4.32">believe it and you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1003.79" dur="4.59">how we&amp;#39;re able to piece together what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1006.07" dur="5.19">going on in these projects is from all</text>
  <text start="1008.38" dur="4.56">these corroborating data points yeah so</text>
  <text start="1011.26" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s pretty much the extent of my Moon</text>
  <text start="1012.94" dur="4.59">memories and maybe someday I can look</text>
  <text start="1015.61" dur="8.22">into them more deeply but I&amp;#39;m not ready</text>
  <text start="1017.53" dur="7.11">yet and you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve come a whole long</text>
  <text start="1023.83" dur="5.009">way</text>
  <text start="1024.64" dur="6.48">with healing through all of it yeah what</text>
  <text start="1028.839" dur="12.321">what have you what have you done to heal</text>
  <text start="1031.12" dur="12.57">through that was really good for me and</text>
  <text start="1041.16" dur="5.02">I&amp;#39;ve recently thought maybe I should go</text>
  <text start="1043.69" dur="3.96">back into those four memories of the</text>
  <text start="1046.18" dur="5.85">nights on the moon and write all that</text>
  <text start="1047.65" dur="8.1">out I&amp;#39;m still kind of sitting on that</text>
  <text start="1052.03" dur="8.49">suggestion for my yeah not sure I really</text>
  <text start="1055.75" dur="7.95">want to do that but I do meditation and</text>
  <text start="1060.52" dur="5.12">spiritual practice I do it every day</text>
  <text start="1063.7" dur="6.8">it helps me maintain my balance</text>
  <text start="1065.64" dur="9.13">especially with sleep being an issue and</text>
  <text start="1070.5" dur="7.05">and I&amp;#39;m just about doing well enough now</text>
  <text start="1074.77" dur="5.82">that I&amp;#39;m thinking about taking out a few</text>
  <text start="1077.55" dur="4.6">coaching clients again you know I do the</text>
  <text start="1080.59" dur="4.26">type of work called body centered</text>
  <text start="1082.15" dur="5.24">coaching and I&amp;#39;m thinking about taking</text>
  <text start="1084.85" dur="5.34">on a few clients on a limited basis</text>
  <text start="1087.39" dur="7.12">which I haven&amp;#39;t done for a long time so</text>
  <text start="1090.19" dur="6.81">I am recovering good good it feels good</text>
  <text start="1094.51" dur="4.92">to be able to think about that and I</text>
  <text start="1097" dur="4.74">also do Dory&amp;#39;s cannons quantum healing</text>
  <text start="1099.43" dur="6.23">hypnosis therapy or not therapy</text>
  <text start="1101.74" dur="6.99">technique awesome I&amp;#39;ve heard of the qhht</text>
  <text start="1105.66" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s really a marvelous process because</text>
  <text start="1108.73" dur="3.68">you</text>
  <text start="1109.02" dur="6.95">people in the past lives and you can</text>
  <text start="1112.41" dur="6.57">look at one past life maybe two and</text>
  <text start="1115.97" dur="5.74">during that process the client is going</text>
  <text start="1118.98" dur="4.65">deeper and deeper in hypnosis and then</text>
  <text start="1121.71" dur="3.72">once they&amp;#39;re really deep into hypnosis</text>
  <text start="1123.63" dur="4.38">then you can actually contact their</text>
  <text start="1125.43" dur="4.44">higher self and then they can bring all</text>
  <text start="1128.01" dur="4.59">their questions about their health their</text>
  <text start="1129.87" dur="4.89">life their career their relationships</text>
  <text start="1132.6" dur="3.63">whatever it is that&amp;#39;s really bothering</text>
  <text start="1134.76" dur="4.17">them in their life and they can ask</text>
  <text start="1136.23" dur="6.75">those quite happy they can have like the</text>
  <text start="1138.93" dur="5.82">practitioner ask their questions of them</text>
  <text start="1142.98" dur="3.87">while they&amp;#39;re under hypnosis and then</text>
  <text start="1144.75" dur="3.84">they get these amazing answers and</text>
  <text start="1146.85" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s all these all this information</text>
  <text start="1148.59" dur="4.53">that comes out that&amp;#39;s really amazing and</text>
  <text start="1150.3" dur="6.12">the friend that I do it with we tested</text>
  <text start="1153.12" dur="5.88">at one time and she asked me my</text>
  <text start="1156.42" dur="4.53">questions and her questions then we</text>
  <text start="1159" dur="4.56">flipped around and we did her session</text>
  <text start="1160.95" dur="4.53">and I asked her her questions and my</text>
  <text start="1163.56" dur="4.95">questions and it was amazing the</text>
  <text start="1165.48" dur="6.3">similarity of answers it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>
  <text start="1168.51" dur="6.36">higher self is like a global higher self</text>
  <text start="1171.78" dur="5.31">of which we&amp;#39;re all apart that we we</text>
  <text start="1174.87" dur="4.14">bring this knowledge in from it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1177.09" dur="4.22">an amazing process it&amp;#39;s almost proves</text>
  <text start="1179.01" dur="6.9">the collective consciousness right there</text>
  <text start="1181.31" dur="6.1">yeah that&amp;#39;s awesome and tell us a little</text>
  <text start="1185.91" dur="4.26">bit more about your different spiritual</text>
  <text start="1187.41" dur="7.65">practices that you do well I did a</text>
  <text start="1190.17" dur="8.1">meditation for about eight years</text>
  <text start="1195.06" dur="5.22">that was before I went public and then I</text>
  <text start="1198.27" dur="6.03">did the pasta for a while and now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1200.28" dur="6">doing just kind of chanting in the</text>
  <text start="1204.3" dur="8.82">morning and focusing on the third eye</text>
  <text start="1206.28" dur="9.24">and and that&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s just deeply</text>
  <text start="1213.12" dur="4.05">restful especially when I can get the</text>
  <text start="1215.52" dur="3.09">mind quiet and you have to be kind of</text>
  <text start="1217.17" dur="3.06">strict with the mind they don&amp;#39;t call it</text>
  <text start="1218.61" dur="4.38">the monkey mind and meditation for</text>
  <text start="1220.23" dur="5.43">nothing it won&amp;#39;t be busy with all kinds</text>
  <text start="1222.99" dur="4.89">of stuff but when you can get it quiet</text>
  <text start="1225.66" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s so peaceful and so</text>
  <text start="1227.88" dur="7.53">nurturing and the other thing that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1230.4" dur="7.89">doing is EFT gotcha certification in EFT</text>
  <text start="1235.41" dur="5.19">and the past three years when PTSD was</text>
  <text start="1238.29" dur="4.08">off the charts I couldn&amp;#39;t even get my</text>
  <text start="1240.6" dur="4.32">own head together enough to do</text>
  <text start="1242.37" dur="5.28">but now I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m doing a lot better and</text>
  <text start="1244.92" dur="7.35">and I can start doing some of these</text>
  <text start="1247.65" dur="7.8">things for myself so the EFT is really</text>
  <text start="1252.27" dur="4.53">an amazing tool for healing great the</text>
  <text start="1255.45" dur="6.84">emotional freedom technique that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1256.8" dur="8.91">fantastic when did you go public the</text>
  <text start="1262.29" dur="6.24">first public tremor that I made was in</text>
  <text start="1265.71" dur="5.52">December of 2008 and I published an</text>
  <text start="1268.53" dur="5.88">article on the internet and then I got</text>
  <text start="1271.23" dur="5.97">hundreds of emails and then I ended up</text>
  <text start="1274.41" dur="6.12">in 2009 I was asked to speak at the</text>
  <text start="1277.2" dur="5.729">Aztec UFO symposium in Aztec New Mexico</text>
  <text start="1280.53" dur="7.35">I wish they were still doing that but</text>
  <text start="1282.929" dur="7.261">they shut it down hmm so and then a year</text>
  <text start="1287.88" dur="7.38">later I spoke at the International UFO</text>
  <text start="1290.19" dur="7.35">Congress in Arizona and and during this</text>
  <text start="1295.26" dur="3.87">time I was doing interviews you know</text>
  <text start="1297.54" dur="4.92">radio interviews and things like that</text>
  <text start="1299.13" dur="5.19">and people were getting so hung up on</text>
  <text start="1302.46" dur="4.02">the horror story of what happened to me</text>
  <text start="1304.32" dur="3.84">I just thought you know that&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="1306.48" dur="3.72">years ago and I&amp;#39;ve come a long way since</text>
  <text start="1308.16" dur="4.769">then I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot of healed a lot</text>
  <text start="1310.2" dur="4.71">and so I decided to go ahead and write</text>
  <text start="1312.929" dur="4.141">the book and the book took me four years</text>

  <text start="1317.07" dur="7.05">pages never expected it to be that long</text>
  <text start="1320.19" dur="5.46">and there and a lot of people said why</text>
  <text start="1324.12" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t you make it into two books and I</text>
  <text start="1325.65" dur="5.37">said well for this reason I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="1328.38" dur="4.679">to drag people through all those</text>
  <text start="1331.02" dur="4.2">experiences and what I went through</text>
  <text start="1333.059" dur="5.461">without giving them the fulfillment of</text>
  <text start="1335.22" dur="5.31">those experiences as well so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1338.52" dur="4.89">divided in three parts you know the</text>
  <text start="1340.53" dur="5.16">experiences healing the journey to</text>
  <text start="1343.41" dur="5.04">within and then the third part is called</text>
  <text start="1345.69" dur="4.95">awakening because when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1348.45" dur="5.16">traumatized to this degree is like a</text>
  <text start="1350.64" dur="5.4">shamanic awakening you know in native</text>
  <text start="1353.61" dur="4.41">cultures people go through an induced</text>
  <text start="1356.04" dur="4.35">kind of trauma to awaken their Stremme</text>
  <text start="1358.02" dur="7.2">onic abilities but it&amp;#39;s the same if</text>
  <text start="1360.39" dur="6.72">trauma happens to you that isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="1365.22" dur="4.92">you would never planned for yourself</text>
  <text start="1367.11" dur="5.28">let&amp;#39;s say and it&amp;#39;s still a shamanic</text>
  <text start="1370.14" dur="5.82">awaking and you know I don&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="1372.39" dur="3.94">claims to be a shaman but I do the gifts</text>
  <text start="1375.96" dur="3.13">of my</text>
  <text start="1376.33" dur="4.8">experiences are the only decent with</text>
  <text start="1379.09" dur="5.52">someone who&amp;#39;s been severely traumatized</text>
  <text start="1381.13" dur="6.69">and listens them listen to them talk to</text>
  <text start="1384.61" dur="4.86">me from a deep heart space and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1387.82" dur="4.349">something else that I&amp;#39;m hoping to give</text>
  <text start="1389.47" dur="4.949">that experience to more people the only</text>
  <text start="1392.169" dur="4.591">thing is is I&amp;#39;ve decided to open up and</text>
  <text start="1394.419" dur="5.311">people who want to talk to me integers</text>
  <text start="1396.76" dur="5.31">race with me do it but because I&amp;#39;m on a</text>
  <text start="1399.73" dur="5.16">disability income and I haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="1402.07" dur="6.5">able to work for so long finances are</text>
  <text start="1404.89" dur="6.99">really wiped out so I&amp;#39;m going to ask for</text>
  <text start="1408.57" dur="5.89">about a $50 donation for an hour of my</text>
  <text start="1411.88" dur="4.23">time to do that and I hope that people</text>
  <text start="1414.46" dur="4.439">will understand that I&amp;#39;m asking it</text>
  <text start="1416.11" dur="4.5">because I really I&amp;#39;m sure they will</text>
  <text start="1418.899" dur="5.27">because doing this work is very</text>
  <text start="1420.61" dur="5.85">difficult it is very difficult and</text>
  <text start="1424.169" dur="5.711">especially against the you know not</text>
  <text start="1426.46" dur="5.689">choosing the corporate path is a lot of</text>
  <text start="1429.88" dur="5.1">hurdles associated with that one so</text>
  <text start="1432.149" dur="5.02">totally you know we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll link your</text>
  <text start="1434.98" dur="6.059">website and your book down below this</text>
  <text start="1437.169" dur="9.51">video as well so anybody watching can</text>
  <text start="1441.039" dur="8.25">feel free to go check those out I really</text>
  <text start="1446.679" dur="4.61">put together through looking at my</text>
  <text start="1449.289" dur="5.61">experiences and looking at the whole</text>
  <text start="1451.289" dur="6.01">social cultural political context in</text>
  <text start="1454.899" dur="6.091">which such experiences occur not just</text>
  <text start="1457.299" dur="6.09">for me but for other people I really</text>
  <text start="1460.99" dur="4.89">picture began to emerge as I was writing</text>
  <text start="1463.389" dur="5.01">the book and went into my book and</text>
  <text start="1465.88" dur="5.549">that&amp;#39;s the fact that the indoctrination</text>
  <text start="1468.399" dur="5.731">which is a form of mass mind control has</text>
  <text start="1471.429" dur="5.97">been perpetrated on humanity almost from</text>
  <text start="1474.13" dur="5.94">the very beginning wait going back to</text>
  <text start="1477.399" dur="5.851">Atlantis and it&amp;#39;s been going on all this</text>
  <text start="1480.07" dur="7.5">time and because our thoughts make the</text>
  <text start="1483.25" dur="6.809">world this indoctrination has created</text>
  <text start="1487.57" dur="4.349">the matrix from our own consciousness of</text>
  <text start="1490.059" dur="4.35">what people like to call the matrix the</text>
  <text start="1491.919" dur="6.75">reality that we see around us every day</text>
  <text start="1494.409" dur="5.941">has been created and generated by the</text>
  <text start="1498.669" dur="4.89">programming of human consciousness</text>
  <text start="1500.35" dur="6.87">through all kinds of methods from time</text>
  <text start="1503.559" dur="6.181">immemorial and now here we are in a</text>
  <text start="1507.22" dur="4.05">modern modern day Society</text>
  <text start="1509.74" dur="5.15">and the programming has gotten more</text>
  <text start="1511.27" dur="7.8">insidious more intense more electronic</text>
  <text start="1514.89" dur="6.52">and sometimes I worry a little bit about</text>
  <text start="1519.07" dur="3.84">stuff on YouTube you know people</text>
  <text start="1521.41" dur="2.07">download things from YouTube all the</text>
  <text start="1522.91" dur="2.43">time</text>
  <text start="1523.48" dur="5.78">but I have a feeling that there could be</text>
  <text start="1525.34" dur="7.68">things tainted with some kind of</text>
  <text start="1529.26" dur="6.76">subliminal programming hmm</text>
  <text start="1533.02" dur="5.25">once YouTube processes it and puts it up</text>
  <text start="1536.02" dur="5.28">online I&amp;#39;m just wondering if it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1538.27" dur="5.46">all what we think it is when we download</text>
  <text start="1541.3" dur="4.8">it so I&amp;#39;m very careful anymore about</text>
  <text start="1543.73" dur="4.17">what I do I work from YouTube it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1546.1" dur="3.57">good yeah and when you know just looking</text>
  <text start="1547.9" dur="5.61">at the mainstream media sorts of things</text>
  <text start="1549.67" dur="6.3">the programming is very intense so how</text>
  <text start="1553.51" dur="4.169">how do you go about unprogrammed</text>
  <text start="1555.97" dur="4.68">yourself and helping each other&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1557.679" dur="5.011">unprogrammed well the first the first</text>
  <text start="1560.65" dur="5.279">line of defense is just really</text>
  <text start="1562.69" dur="4.95">understanding what&amp;#39;s going on I put a</text>
  <text start="1565.929" dur="4.441">lot of information about it in my book</text>
  <text start="1567.64" dur="4.47">you know about forms of mass mind</text>
  <text start="1570.37" dur="3.809">control that people just don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1572.11" dur="3.18">realize it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re like fish swimming</text>
  <text start="1574.179" dur="3.811">in a fish bowl</text>
  <text start="1575.29" dur="4.889">that&amp;#39;s all programming and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1577.99" dur="5.46">even realize that it&amp;#39;s there but once</text>
  <text start="1580.179" dur="6.331">you get told that it&amp;#39;s there and start</text>
  <text start="1583.45" dur="4.83">look for all the little pieces of stuff</text>
  <text start="1586.51" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s coming at you then you realize</text>
  <text start="1588.28" dur="4.11">that it&amp;#39;s there and that&amp;#39;s the beginning</text>
  <text start="1589.9" dur="4.56">of deep programming you know just</text>
  <text start="1592.39" dur="3.66">realizing that it&amp;#39;s there and starting</text>
  <text start="1594.46" dur="5.04">to question everything about your</text>
  <text start="1596.05" dur="6.45">reality you know and and isolate it down</text>
  <text start="1599.5" dur="5.22">to what&amp;#39;s true inside of yourself and it</text>
  <text start="1602.5" dur="4.92">starts with body knowledge okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1604.72" dur="5.73">like right now I&amp;#39;m sitting in this chair</text>
  <text start="1607.42" dur="5.28">and I&amp;#39;m feeling you know my my bottom</text>
  <text start="1610.45" dur="3.359">sitting on the chair I&amp;#39;m feeling my back</text>
  <text start="1612.7" dur="3.359">on the backrest</text>
  <text start="1613.809" dur="5.431">that&amp;#39;s all true you know and you start</text>
  <text start="1616.059" dur="5.191">putting what&amp;#39;s true together from body</text>
  <text start="1619.24" dur="5.55">knowledge and then extending out and out</text>
  <text start="1621.25" dur="7.35">and out and anything that comes from TV</text>
  <text start="1624.79" dur="6.06">or radio or print media you need to</text>
  <text start="1628.6" dur="3.84">question it you need to look between the</text>
  <text start="1630.85" dur="4.35">lines you need to really look underneath</text>
  <text start="1632.44" dur="5.34">what&amp;#39;s being put out and look and see if</text>
  <text start="1635.2" dur="5.43">is there an agenda there if you follow</text>
  <text start="1637.78" dur="5.65">the money where does it lead you you</text>
  <text start="1640.63" dur="6.25">know you really have to look hard</text>
  <text start="1643.43" dur="5.43">and we have and as human beings we have</text>
  <text start="1646.88" dur="5.52">these wonderful capacities for love and</text>
  <text start="1648.86" dur="6.42">connection and we need to work on</text>
  <text start="1652.4" dur="4.62">building on those because the forces</text>
  <text start="1655.28" dur="4.56">would be they don&amp;#39;t want us to ever</text>
  <text start="1657.02" dur="5.25">unify our consciousness they&amp;#39;ve unified</text>
  <text start="1659.84" dur="4.56">our consciousness unconsciously through</text>
  <text start="1662.27" dur="4.4">their programming and indoctrination to</text>
  <text start="1664.4" dur="5.07">create the matrix matrix we&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="1666.67" dur="5.01">but what we need to do is we need to</text>
  <text start="1669.47" dur="5.25">understand we&amp;#39;ve been programmed</text>
  <text start="1671.68" dur="5.98">question everything and create a new</text>
  <text start="1674.72" dur="5.04">reality and when we create the new</text>
  <text start="1677.66" dur="3.75">reality then it will start to manifest</text>
  <text start="1679.76" dur="3.78">in the world around us because our</text>
  <text start="1681.41" dur="5.85">thoughts do make the world we know that</text>
  <text start="1683.54" dur="5.46">from quantum science and it&amp;#39;s very but</text>
  <text start="1687.26" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s a very vital process that we need</text>
  <text start="1689" dur="4.26">to undertake and I&amp;#39;m hoping to find like</text>
  <text start="1691.79" dur="4.68">I was saying to you and my message to</text>
  <text start="1693.26" dur="6.06">you there&amp;#39;s so much going on in the</text>
  <text start="1696.47" dur="6.12">world right now that needs consciousness</text>
  <text start="1699.32" dur="5.46">attention and intention mm-hmm that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1702.59" dur="4.02">been thinking you know what are we gonna</text>
  <text start="1704.78" dur="4.68">do run around with like consciousness</text>
  <text start="1706.61" dur="4.37">fly swatters and try to get all these</text>
  <text start="1709.46" dur="4.08">bad things that are happening</text>
  <text start="1710.98" dur="4.42">individually and I&amp;#39;m thinking about</text>
  <text start="1713.54" dur="3.48">something new some of that is probably</text>
  <text start="1715.4" dur="3.3">still gonna be necessary</text>
  <text start="1717.02" dur="5.58">for some of the larger things like</text>
  <text start="1718.7" dur="6.48">averting a nuclear war or redirecting</text>
  <text start="1722.6" dur="7.65">hurricane Irma which I did a video</text>
  <text start="1725.18" dur="7.44">called wrangling hurricanes and but what</text>
  <text start="1730.25" dur="6.66">we need to do is we need to develop as</text>
  <text start="1732.62" dur="6.12">conscious loving human beings who want a</text>
  <text start="1736.91" dur="5.55">better world we need to develop a kind</text>
  <text start="1738.74" dur="6.18">of unified spiritual practice every day</text>
  <text start="1742.46" dur="5.31">where we at we are envisioning the world</text>
  <text start="1744.92" dur="4.77">in which we want to live in and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1747.77" dur="4.14">about turning away from the dark things</text>
  <text start="1749.69" dur="3.93">that are happening it&amp;#39;s about looking at</text>
  <text start="1751.91" dur="4.8">the dark things that are happening and</text>
  <text start="1753.62" dur="6.33">then turning it around 180 degrees and</text>
  <text start="1756.71" dur="6.21">using that darkness to envision what</text>
  <text start="1759.95" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;d like to see in its place you know</text>
  <text start="1762.92" dur="5.34">not get consumed or pulled in by the</text>
  <text start="1765.38" dur="5.85">darkness and you know like this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1768.26" dur="5.19">kind of like okay there it is no do I</text>
  <text start="1771.23" dur="5.1">need to assign a bunch of emotions to it</text>
  <text start="1773.45" dur="3.9">no that&amp;#39;ll just make it stronger okay</text>
  <text start="1776.33" dur="2.55">what I need to do</text>
  <text start="1777.35" dur="4.5">as I need to flip it around and</text>
  <text start="1778.88" dur="5.13">visualize something that I really would</text>
  <text start="1781.85" dur="5.13">love to see in its place what kind of</text>
  <text start="1784.01" dur="5.61">world would it be if that was completely</text>
  <text start="1786.98" dur="4.189">the opposite experience you know</text>
  <text start="1789.62" dur="4.5">something loving something beautiful</text>
  <text start="1791.169" dur="5.591">something that knits humanity together</text>
  <text start="1794.12" dur="6.179">and in loving and compassionate ways and</text>
  <text start="1796.76" dur="5.669">then put our energy and our emotion into</text>
  <text start="1800.299" dur="3.781">that because positive emotions are ever</text>
  <text start="1802.429" dur="4.701">so much more powerful than making at</text>
  <text start="1804.08" dur="6.329">once and we can do this I believe we can</text>
  <text start="1807.13" dur="4.63">that&amp;#39;s great that was fantastic and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1810.409" dur="3">very it&amp;#39;s very funny that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1811.76" dur="3.48">mentioning the matrix because I was just</text>
  <text start="1813.409" dur="4.171">thinking about this yesterday and that</text>
  <text start="1815.24" dur="5.429">you know the made the matrix that is so</text>
  <text start="1817.58" dur="4.95">popular is the one that&amp;#39;s given to us</text>
  <text start="1820.669" dur="4.26">and we have the complete ability to form</text>
  <text start="1822.53" dur="5.16">our new matrix that&amp;#39;s just like you said</text>
  <text start="1824.929" dur="6.5">much greater for us we just have to</text>
  <text start="1827.69" dur="6.51">visualize on that and making it from our</text>
  <text start="1831.429" dur="4.831">collective unconscious mm-hmm and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1834.2" dur="5.28">our consciousness that has the key to</text>
  <text start="1836.26" dur="5.409">unlock it and get us out of it exactly</text>
  <text start="1839.48" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s just becoming aware but you have to</text>
  <text start="1841.669" dur="3.601">become aware of the roaches in the</text>
  <text start="1843.74" dur="3.809">corner you can&amp;#39;t turn away from those</text>
  <text start="1845.27" dur="6">darkness because then it&amp;#39;ll never never</text>
  <text start="1847.549" dur="5.25">get handled so perfect perfect spiritual</text>
  <text start="1851.27" dur="4.92">words right there because so many people</text>
  <text start="1852.799" dur="5.791">want to you know put their put their</text>
  <text start="1856.19" dur="4.979">earmuffs on and turn away from things</text>
  <text start="1858.59" dur="5.839">they don&amp;#39;t like hearing but they need to</text>
  <text start="1861.169" dur="5.521">well I say about my book you know and</text>
  <text start="1864.429" dur="4.091">you know they really don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="1866.69" dur="4.489">information out there that zero-point</text>
  <text start="1868.52" dur="5.19">energy is real and we can use it to</text>

  <text start="1881.15" dur="3.779">want to get out is this thing about</text>
  <text start="1883.4" dur="3.81">consciousness because that&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="1884.929" dur="4.321">genie in a bottle and once that genie</text>
  <text start="1887.21" dur="3.99">consciousness genie is out of the bottle</text>
  <text start="1889.25" dur="4.26">and people realize what&amp;#39;s been done to</text>
  <text start="1891.2" dur="5.04">them for eons and they&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="1893.51" dur="4.71">turn it around then that genie is out of</text>

  <text start="1898.22" dur="5.22">putting it back mm-hmm seems like every</text>
  <text start="1901.28" dur="4.23">day I&amp;#39;m logging onto the course the</text>
  <text start="1903.44" dur="5.09">mainstream science news and they have</text>
  <text start="1905.51" dur="5.58">some article that completely takes</text>

  <text start="1927.17" dur="6.9">devalue us you can&amp;#39;t buy into it you</text>
  <text start="1931.79" dur="5.58">know I mean science is for sale</text>
  <text start="1934.07" dur="5.64">pretty much in our world so hardly I</text>
  <text start="1937.37" dur="5.58">hardly ever read scientific articles</text>
  <text start="1939.71" dur="5.34">anymore without really questioning where</text>
  <text start="1942.95" dur="4.56">the science is coming from and is it is</text>
  <text start="1945.05" dur="6.62">it valid has it really stood up to</text>
  <text start="1947.51" dur="6.39">scientific method of hypothesizing and</text>
  <text start="1951.67" dur="4.2">experimentation and then developing a</text>
  <text start="1953.9" dur="5.13">thesis and then retesting it and</text>
  <text start="1955.87" dur="5.59">publishing correct results or are they</text>
  <text start="1959.03" dur="4.86">publishing skewed results it makes it</text>
  <text start="1961.46" dur="4.56">really it it&amp;#39;s really important to</text>
  <text start="1963.89" dur="4.71">question everything that you look at and</text>
  <text start="1966.02" dur="4.74">really listen to your heart and your gut</text>
  <text start="1968.6" dur="4.29">as to whether it feels true or not</text>
  <text start="1970.76" dur="6.09">because I feel that all of us have a</text>
  <text start="1972.89" dur="6.39">built-in truth detector and</text>
  <text start="1976.85" dur="6">detector inside of us we need to listen</text>
  <text start="1979.28" dur="6.9">to our bodies and how information lands</text>
  <text start="1982.85" dur="7.05">in our body and the one the one caveat</text>
  <text start="1986.18" dur="5.82">on that is because of our conditioning</text>
  <text start="1989.9" dur="4.56">when we look at things that are outside</text>
  <text start="1992" dur="4.58">of our conditioning we come up against</text>
  <text start="1994.46" dur="5.73">something called cognitive dissonance</text>
  <text start="1996.58" dur="6.79">which is when say you&amp;#39;re a religious</text>
  <text start="2000.19" dur="6.75">person you believe that the Virgin Mary</text>
  <text start="2003.37" dur="6.03">bore Jesus as a virgin birth and then</text>
  <text start="2006.94" dur="4.11">one day it just comes across your</text>
  <text start="2009.4" dur="4.68">consciousness or you see it written down</text>
  <text start="2011.05" dur="4.83">someplace that that Jesus was a</text>
  <text start="2014.08" dur="4.02">remarkable man but he didn&amp;#39;t come from a</text>
  <text start="2015.88" dur="4.23">virgin birth you know because of God</text>
  <text start="2018.1" dur="4.68">doesn&amp;#39;t break his own laws you know or</text>
  <text start="2020.11" dur="5.31">some other reason and son somehow that</text>
  <text start="2022.78" dur="5.04">lands on you and you and your gut says</text>
  <text start="2025.42" dur="4.14">you know that really feels true but your</text>
  <text start="2027.82" dur="3.42">mind is saying this is against</text>
  <text start="2029.56" dur="6.36">everything I learned my whole life hmm</text>
  <text start="2031.24" dur="6.54">you know and and so that&amp;#39;s cognitive</text>
  <text start="2035.92" dur="4.11">dissonance it&amp;#39;s when what you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2037.78" dur="4.89">trained to believe your whole life comes</text>
  <text start="2040.03" dur="4.62">into conflict with new truths that are</text>
  <text start="2042.67" dur="4.08">registering themselves in your body</text>
  <text start="2044.65" dur="4.29">and it&amp;#39;s an uncomfortable place to be</text>
  <text start="2046.75" dur="4.08">but you will pass through it and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2048.94" dur="3.959">get to the point where you&amp;#39;re aware</text>
  <text start="2050.83" dur="3.839">you&amp;#39;re awake and you&amp;#39;re beginning to</text>
  <text start="2052.899" dur="5.161">question everything and that is a good</text>
  <text start="2054.669" dur="5.401">thing it&amp;#39;s a very good thing you know</text>
  <text start="2058.06" dur="4.349">that&amp;#39;s a good example you used right</text>
  <text start="2060.07" dur="4.26">there there&amp;#39;s numerous under other</text>
  <text start="2062.409" dur="4.73">examples we could use that you know</text>
  <text start="2064.33" dur="4.98">vaccine one is a huge one or</text>
  <text start="2067.139" dur="4.121">geoengineering chemtrails you know</text>
  <text start="2069.31" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s so many things that people will</text>
  <text start="2071.26" dur="4.11">have that that just harmony in their</text>
  <text start="2073.48" dur="4.71">head with that dissonance and then say</text>
  <text start="2075.37" dur="5.61">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s either a choice of well I</text>
  <text start="2078.19" dur="4.439">can go through that discomfort just like</text>
  <text start="2080.98" dur="4.679">you said and go on a path of truth or I</text>
  <text start="2082.629" dur="12.091">can run back to my ego and keep living a</text>
  <text start="2085.659" dur="11.971">lie mm-hmm and then being recycled over</text>
  <text start="2094.72" dur="5.55">and over and over again here and we</text>
  <text start="2097.63" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t want to do that you know I think</text>
  <text start="2100.27" dur="3.42">the powers that be on this planet are</text>
  <text start="2101.89" dur="4.38">scared to death that there&amp;#39;s 7 billion</text>
  <text start="2103.69" dur="4.47">of us and oh my god what if we all</text>
  <text start="2106.27" dur="4.02">awakened or what if a significant</text>
  <text start="2108.16" dur="5.31">portion of that 7 billion awakened and</text>
  <text start="2110.29" dur="5.79">started to take the consciousness path</text>
  <text start="2113.47" dur="4.74">to change things there is nothing they</text>
  <text start="2116.08" dur="2.58">could do about it nothing they could do</text>
  <text start="2118.21" dur="1.86">about it</text>
  <text start="2118.66" dur="5.1">all they can do is keep spinning out</text>
  <text start="2120.07" dur="5.7">there fear porn and fear porn has an</text>
  <text start="2123.76" dur="6.03">effect of actually affecting us at the</text>
  <text start="2125.77" dur="5.85">DNA level you know love and a lot of</text>
  <text start="2129.79" dur="3.75">other things going on in the world like</text>
  <text start="2131.62" dur="4.65">maybe the solar flares and things like</text>
  <text start="2133.54" dur="5.61">that are trying to awaken our DNA and</text>
  <text start="2136.27" dur="6.9">reconnect the codons that were called</text>
  <text start="2139.15" dur="9.57">junk DNA but the fear porn keeps the DNA</text>
  <text start="2143.17" dur="7.98">shut down and not not turning on those</text>
  <text start="2148.72" dur="5.13">extra codons so we want to turn on all</text>
  <text start="2151.15" dur="5.31">the codons in our DNA and become who</text>
  <text start="2153.85" dur="4.8">were meant to be and with all the fear</text>
  <text start="2156.46" dur="4.77">porn and and not questioning and</text>
  <text start="2158.65" dur="5.79">accepting the programming were we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2161.23" dur="4.65">never going to we&amp;#39;re never we&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="2164.44" dur="3.57">going to awake and we&amp;#39;re never going to</text>
  <text start="2165.88" dur="7.62">become beautiful beings were intended to</text>
  <text start="2168.01" dur="7.62">be and you know I think eventually if</text>
  <text start="2173.5" dur="4.799">they were to have their way we might</text>
  <text start="2175.63" dur="4.859">find ourselves all in some way be</text>
  <text start="2178.299" dur="4.081">very similar to the board you know from</text>
  <text start="2180.489" dur="4.56">starting with the implants that they</text>
  <text start="2182.38" dur="4.53">want to put into people mm-hmm and then</text>
  <text start="2185.049" dur="5.76">it going further and further until</text>
  <text start="2186.91" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s all these mechanical prosthetics</text>
  <text start="2190.809" dur="4.62">you know that would make people like a</text>
  <text start="2192.88" dur="5.309">bionic man better faster stronger or</text>
  <text start="2195.429" dur="3.39">whatever and you know that all sounds</text>
  <text start="2198.189" dur="4.41">great</text>
  <text start="2198.819" dur="5.841">you know better faster stronger but at</text>
  <text start="2202.599" dur="4.94">what cost</text>
  <text start="2204.66" dur="4.29">exactly and it seems like there&amp;#39;s such a</text>
  <text start="2207.539" dur="4.5">push right now for all of this</text>
  <text start="2208.95" dur="5.609">artificial intelligence to try to quell</text>
  <text start="2212.039" dur="5.131">the awakening but then again like you</text>
  <text start="2214.559" dur="4.711">said at what cost when you actually</text>
  <text start="2217.17" dur="5.639">understand what your pineal gland and</text>
  <text start="2219.27" dur="5.039">your DNA and your own brain can do why</text>
  <text start="2222.809" dur="4.23">the heck would you even want anything</text>
  <text start="2224.309" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s artificial you know I&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="2227.039" dur="3.78">that path even if it&amp;#39;s a little more</text>
  <text start="2228.539" dur="4.921">difficult having to turn on your own DNA</text>
  <text start="2230.819" dur="6.331">and and you know get there yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2233.46" dur="9.99">gonna take more effort but man I would</text>
  <text start="2237.15" dur="9.209">like some telepathy what about you that</text>
  <text start="2243.45" dur="4.919">corn fiber shard but I think it&amp;#39;s fairly</text>
  <text start="2246.359" dur="4.281">accurate because when you&amp;#39;re really in</text>
  <text start="2248.369" dur="4.411">tune with another living being</text>
  <text start="2250.64" dur="3.76">you&amp;#39;re not just picking up their</text>
  <text start="2252.78" dur="7.589">thoughts you&amp;#39;re feeling their feelings</text>
  <text start="2254.4" dur="8.04">mm-hmm an AI and mechanized creations</text>
  <text start="2260.369" dur="4.891">they don&amp;#39;t have a conscience</text>
  <text start="2262.44" dur="5.04">human beings have a conscious conscience</text>
  <text start="2265.26" dur="3.99">because they have that empathy with</text>
  <text start="2267.48" dur="4.41">others of their own kind to a greater or</text>
  <text start="2269.25" dur="6.99">lesser degree some are very empathic</text>
  <text start="2271.89" dur="7.02">some are only partially empathic but we</text>
  <text start="2276.24" dur="5.16">have conscience you know that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="2278.91" dur="4.439">rains us in says oh gosh are you really</text>
  <text start="2281.4" dur="3.48">gonna do that you know that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2283.349" dur="4.68">really hurt that person over there and</text>
  <text start="2284.88" dur="6.09">conscience is what steps in it stops us</text>
  <text start="2288.029" dur="4.381">from doing terrible things and machines</text>
  <text start="2290.97" dur="4.559">don&amp;#39;t have that all they have is</text>
  <text start="2292.41" dur="8.25">programming and what a sociopath or a</text>
  <text start="2295.529" dur="7.951">psychopath programs that robot yeah I</text>
  <text start="2300.66" dur="5.639">can see that very easily it has no</text>
  <text start="2303.48" dur="6.75">conscience it just has programming mmm</text>
  <text start="2306.299" dur="6.3">yeah well yeah that&amp;#39;s we and we</text>
  <text start="2310.23" dur="5.19">definitely don&amp;#39;t want that we want to</text>

  <text start="2333" dur="4.49">society and then the machines became so</text>
