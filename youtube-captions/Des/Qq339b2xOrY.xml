  <text start="76.11" dur="6.42">man it&amp;#39;s awesome but what I have to say</text>
  <text start="79.59" dur="6.45">about it is that it doesn&amp;#39;t go far</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="6.69">enough and in fact to illustrate that</text>
  <text start="86.04" dur="7.17">I&amp;#39;m gonna offer my own walkaway story to</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="6.18">help you get my point and my own</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="4.38">walkaway story begins when I was really</text>
  <text start="95.4" dur="5.49">young you see I was raised in a</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="6.72">household that was very hands-off well</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="5.25">say they were like basically didn&amp;#39;t push</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="4.83">me into any particular ideologies they</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="5.009">didn&amp;#39;t my family they didn&amp;#39;t push me any</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="4.589">into any political party they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="4.321">push me into any kind of religious</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="3.811">belief system we didn&amp;#39;t go to church so</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="3.929">by hands-off they were just like let him</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="4.74">go do his thing you&amp;#39;ll formulate his own</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="4.771">beliefs which on one hand is a very good</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="4.17">thing but on the other hand it can be a</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="6.959">very bad thing but anyway it worked out</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="6.2">pretty well for me so me growing up very</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="4.31">hands-off environment</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="5.25">and I was very scientifically minded I</text>
  <text start="135.439" dur="6.36">was a very bright thinker when I was</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="6.24">young still him but uh I was gifted per</text>
  <text start="141.799" dur="3.961">se I was in those programs and the STEM</text>
  <text start="144.14" dur="6">program science technology engineering</text>
  <text start="145.76" dur="7.259">mathematics and I was very astute at the</text>
  <text start="150.14" dur="5.129">left brain stuff and when I was trying</text>
  <text start="153.019" dur="4.951">to figure out what the heck was going on</text>
  <text start="155.269" dur="5.19">in the world I started getting into</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="7.43">different books and different theories</text>
  <text start="160.459" dur="7.521">and ideologies I came across and</text>
  <text start="165.4" dur="5.649">resonated at the time with a lot of the</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="5.08">atheistic thinkers and I read Richard</text>
  <text start="171.049" dur="3.36">Dawkins books and I read Sam Harris and</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="4.289">Christopher Hitchens and I was into that</text>
  <text start="174.409" dur="5.101">Flying Spaghetti Monster and I was</text>
  <text start="177.349" dur="5.071">very hardcore into that and I thought</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="6.24">that religion see I came to form the</text>
  <text start="182.42" dur="4.83">belief that religion was the bane of the</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="3.12">Earth&amp;#39;s existence all the problems that</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="4.349">we had on this planet was just because</text>
  <text start="188.87" dur="5.039">of religion all kinds of religions going</text>
  <text start="191.599" dur="9.241">at each other I&amp;#39;m like it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="193.909" dur="8.91">and I even did projects and exercises in</text>
  <text start="200.84" dur="4.619">classes when I was in high school and in</text>
  <text start="202.819" dur="4.2">college I did a presentation my English</text>
  <text start="205.459" dur="4.62">class I think then in a public speaking</text>
  <text start="207.019" dur="5.821">class in college about religion being</text>
  <text start="210.079" dur="5.19">terrible and you know I was pushing the</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="5.039">envelope pissed some people off even who</text>
  <text start="215.269" dur="4.321">and I was young back then but you know I</text>
  <text start="217.879" dur="3.991">was just very passionate at trying to</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="4.319">get people away from that brainwashing</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="5.13">little did I know I was subject to</text>
  <text start="223.909" dur="7.26">brainwashing myself and then as I grow</text>
  <text start="227" dur="6.389">up now here&amp;#39;s where it changes as I went</text>
  <text start="231.169" dur="3.72">on to college dropped out of college and</text>
  <text start="233.389" dur="2.97">you know started going through my own</text>
  <text start="234.889" dur="4.801">awakening path which is a story for</text>
  <text start="236.359" dur="6.81">another time I was about twenty</text>
  <text start="239.69" dur="6.6">twenty-one when I started delving deeper</text>
  <text start="243.169" dur="4.74">waking up taking the red pill not the</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="4.86">red pill but all the different kinds of</text>
  <text start="247.909" dur="5.01">red pills and once I started to see that</text>
  <text start="251.15" dur="4.92">there was much more to reality than the</text>
  <text start="252.919" dur="5.521"> we&amp;#39;re fed I was hungry for as</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="4.469">many red pills as I could find and I</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="4.229">started connecting so many dots all</text>
  <text start="260.539" dur="3.421">across the board at first it was the</text>
  <text start="262.669" dur="3.091">health care system and the</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="2.58">pharmaceutical I&amp;#39;m like oh my</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="2.25">gosh</text>
  <text start="266.54" dur="3.39">you know there&amp;#39;s so much they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="3.42">us about health vaccines or bad</text>
  <text start="269.93" dur="3.69">fluorides bad and there&amp;#39;s cures for</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="6.84">cancer and then that was quickly into</text>
  <text start="273.62" dur="6.42">the financial system and then the you</text>
  <text start="278.27" dur="4.05">know so many other topics from there and</text>
  <text start="280.04" dur="3.72">it all connected of course to religious</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="3.42">systems and it all connects in one way</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="3.48">or another so I was seeing how it did</text>
  <text start="285.74" dur="3.87">now I was like oh my gosh it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="3.63">religion in itself it&amp;#39;s the people</text>
  <text start="289.61" dur="3.6">behind the scenes you know messing with</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="8.01">religions and handling it managing it</text>
  <text start="293.21" dur="8.82">whatnot so needless to say what I began</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="6.63">to do is walk away from that scientific</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="5.82">dogma I walked away from that atheistic</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="5.16">thinking I began to see like oh my God</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="5.04">look at all this esoteric science is</text>
  <text start="310.67" dur="4.02">hidden science the real science not fake</text>
  <text start="312.89" dur="3.66"> science but real science that</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re not being told that absolutely</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="5.73">explains that there is a cosmic</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="6.15">intelligence here that there is a sort</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="4.98">of design to things right I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="325.16" dur="4.14">talking about nan Thorp amorphic God</text>
  <text start="327.26" dur="5.34">sitting in the clouds judging people but</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m talking about a primal cosmic force</text>
  <text start="332.6" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s absolutely guiding us that we</text>
  <text start="335" dur="4.77">both emanate from and return back to you</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="5.04">know I was beginning to see how oh my</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.62">god look at these these patterns now</text>
  <text start="342.92" dur="3.09">sacred geometry look at all these</text>
  <text start="344.39" dur="3.15">patterns throughout nature look at the</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="3.72">Fibonacci sequence how the heck is it</text>
  <text start="347.54" dur="5.01">manifesting and so many living</text>
  <text start="349.73" dur="5.7">biological organisms organisms from all</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="4.56">levels from plants to us to cosmic</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="4.62">scales even it&amp;#39;s everywhere</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="6.06">geez not only that but just research and</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="8.82">consciousness itself how that operates</text>
  <text start="363.17" dur="7.8">how it&amp;#39;s non-local how there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="3.69">energetic field around not only each one</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="2.7">of us but the earth itself but the</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="3.24">cosmos itself</text>
  <text start="373.67" dur="3.83">everything&amp;#39;s energy vibration frequency</text>
  <text start="375.8" dur="5">I was delving into these Sciences and</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="8.08">looking into DNA now DNA itself is</text>
  <text start="380.8" dur="8.65">sacred geometrically arranged to create</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="5.25">torsion fields and you know be non-local</text>
  <text start="389.45" dur="2.52">in time-space it was just blowing my</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="4.14">freakin mind I don&amp;#39;t need to keep</text>
  <text start="391.97" dur="6.42">getting into it but it absolutely showed</text>
  <text start="394.97" dur="5.49">me that I was brainwashed but I was</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="5.91">brainwashed by science</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="6.48">and by the divide-and-conquer strategy</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="4.41">with mainstream science and mainstream</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="4.5">religion right that&amp;#39;s what got me so i</text>
  <text start="408.71" dur="5.459">walked away from that so what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="411.44" dur="6.42">here is that what we need to do is walk</text>

  <text start="441.349" dur="4.32">from identity politics altogether</text>

  <text start="472.13" dur="7.23">that and begin embracing begin taking</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="3.87">the resourceful information that we do</text>
