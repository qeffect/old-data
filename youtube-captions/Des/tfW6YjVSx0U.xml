  <text start="33.82" dur="3.96">about</text>
  <text start="34.33" dur="5.369">yeah so first question I&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="37.78" dur="4.739">lately let&amp;#39;s talk about gold I think I</text>
  <text start="39.699" dur="5.04">saw this article about an Egyptian</text>
  <text start="42.519" dur="3.811">billionaire investing a crap ton of</text>
  <text start="44.739" dur="4.981">money into gold he&amp;#39;s saying that gold</text>
  <text start="46.33" dur="5.819">prices are going to rise so what do you</text>
  <text start="49.72" dur="4.05">see happening in the very near future do</text>
  <text start="52.149" dur="3.541">you think he&amp;#39;s correct do you think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.77" dur="3.99">a wise choice to be investing that much</text>
  <text start="55.69" dur="5.01">money into gold well there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="57.76" dur="5.16">number of billionaires and hedge fund</text>
  <text start="60.7" dur="4.62">managers over the last year that have</text>
  <text start="62.92" dur="4.44">been putting money into gold this</text>
  <text start="65.32" dur="3.299">billionaire this Egyptian billionaire is</text>
  <text start="67.36" dur="5.28">interesting because he&amp;#39;s a married</text>
  <text start="68.619" dur="8.221">forward-thinking entrepreneur they had a</text>
  <text start="72.64" dur="6.93">family amass I think eight or nine</text>
  <text start="76.84" dur="5.76">hundred million about ten years ago and</text>
  <text start="79.57" dur="5.13">then he decided to invest into North</text>
  <text start="82.6" dur="4.23">Korea Besson in North Korea was the</text>
  <text start="84.7" dur="4.77">first company to invest in telecom in</text>
  <text start="86.83" dur="5.91">North Korea turned that fortune into a</text>
  <text start="89.47" dur="5.52">little over five billion dollars came</text>
  <text start="92.74" dur="4.59">out recently and said that he thinks</text>
  <text start="94.99" dur="4.799">that the dollars in trouble stock</text>
  <text start="97.33" dur="4.98">markets in a really bad tailspin</text>
  <text start="99.789" dur="6.261">and he believes that gold is going to be</text>
  <text start="102.31" dur="5.85">a real safe haven predicting that gold</text>
  <text start="106.05" dur="4.269">quoted he said gold should go to about</text>
  <text start="108.16" dur="5.04">1800 which would be about a $500</text>
  <text start="110.319" dur="6.39">increase in the near future and he put</text>
  <text start="113.2" dur="6.36">half of his net worth half of that 5.3</text>
  <text start="116.709" dur="5.121">billion into gold so obviously someone</text>
  <text start="119.56" dur="5.28">that is as forward-thinking as he is</text>
  <text start="121.83" dur="4.87">someone that&amp;#39;s willing to invest in the</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="3.57">areas that other people won&amp;#39;t he was the</text>
  <text start="126.7" dur="4.649">first company to invest in North Korea</text>
  <text start="128.41" dur="4.5">for telecom obviously he sees something</text>
  <text start="131.349" dur="4.711">there and he&amp;#39;s putting his money where</text>
  <text start="132.91" dur="4.74">his mouth is is this only an</text>
  <text start="136.06" dur="2.94">international phenomenon of people</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="3.809">investing into gold or there a lot of</text>
  <text start="139" dur="4.95">Americans doing it - no it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="5.731">everywhere you know I think that in the</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="6.56">u.s. the buying of gold over the last 30</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="5.51">days was down based on the US Mint</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="5.069">Galatians the selling of gold eagles was</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="4.649">down about 25% last month but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.579" dur="3.781">really because a lot of times what you</text>
  <text start="157.349" dur="4.621">see in gold buying is you see this kind</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="4.53">of the bulrush so a lot of times</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="4.379">investors will just kind of follow the</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="5.069">trend after it&amp;#39;s already moving up so</text>
  <text start="166.349" dur="6.271">they&amp;#39;ll wait until it hits 17 or 18 or</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="6.571">19 hundred like it did in 2011 and then</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ll really start to buy but the</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="6.12">larger investors as you mentioned this</text>
  <text start="177.75" dur="5.489">billionaire he sees the trend happening</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="3.899">soon and he wants again and before that</text>
  <text start="183.239" dur="4.021">happens and you know the interesting</text>
  <text start="185.549" dur="4.77">thing about having a billionaire that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="5.25">invested in something like gold you know</text>
  <text start="190.319" dur="5.371">his thinking is that if I can protect my</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="6.03">wealth now my family&amp;#39;s wealth now let it</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="5.01">rise you know take that profit at some</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="3.9">point maybe sell some and then he can</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="3.659">move into some other assets once these</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="3.6">things pull back once the stock market</text>
  <text start="204.359" dur="3.99">pulls back I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;ll go heavy back</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="5.069">in there so I think that he likes the</text>
  <text start="208.349" dur="4.711">look the liquidity of gold which is one</text>
  <text start="211.109" dur="3.99">of the things that people forget is that</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="5.509">you know investments like real estate</text>
  <text start="215.099" dur="5.551">are great that when the market turns</text>
  <text start="218.569" dur="5.23">you&amp;#39;re gonna have to stay there for a</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="5.489">while you know people in 2008 it took</text>
  <text start="223.799" dur="5.97">you know five six years before the</text>
  <text start="226.139" dur="5.16">market returned and so that&amp;#39;s an asset</text>
  <text start="229.769" dur="3.631">you have to hold gold if it moves up</text>
  <text start="231.299" dur="4.381">tremendously you can always liquidate it</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s what we do for clients we help</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="4.47">them get out of it quickly and take that</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="5.73">profit so I think he likes the liquidity</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="4.29">of it he obviously likes the price and I</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.93">think he&amp;#39;s you know he sees something</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="4.379">gonna happen here in the future and you</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="5.039">know obviously not all of us are</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="5.431">billionaires what would the average</text>
  <text start="251.879" dur="3.72">person on an average budget what would</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="3.239">you recommend for them to begin</text>
  <text start="255.599" dur="5.94">investing if they did want to capitalize</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="7.441">on this potential future gold increase</text>
  <text start="261.539" dur="5.401">yeah and I think it comes down to how</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="3.989">much are you willing to risk right now</text>
  <text start="266.94" dur="3.9">in the stock market most people have the</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="3.99">majority of their net worth if they</text>
  <text start="270.84" dur="4.47">really look at it and they look at what</text>
  <text start="272.909" dur="5.04">they have in their 401ks or their eyes</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="4.89">the majority of people are in stocks</text>
  <text start="277.949" dur="3.96">bonds mutual funds so the question</text>
  <text start="280.2" dur="3.33">really is how much are you willing to be</text>
  <text start="281.909" dur="4.541">exposed there how much</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="6.58">risk especially if you&amp;#39;re very close to</text>
  <text start="286.45" dur="6.81">retirement someone that&amp;#39;s you know 25 or</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="5.13">30 they can withstand the ups and downs</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="4.98">and the volatility of the market over</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="5.82">all those years but if you&amp;#39;re 45 and</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="4.62">older you might not have that much time</text>
  <text start="301.06" dur="4.26">if there&amp;#39;s a major correction right now</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="4.47">so I think the number the purse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="4.74">more of a percentage and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="4.05">going to be personal for everybody but</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="3.42">you know we deal with a lot of</text>
  <text start="311.38" dur="4.65">first-time investors getting into metals</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="4.11">whether they&amp;#39;re doing an IRA whether</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="3.09">they just want to get some gold at home</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="4.29">you know maybe they have some money in a</text>
  <text start="319.12" dur="6.39">savings account they&amp;#39;re fed up making a</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="6.03">quarter of a percent it&amp;#39;s laughable with</text>
  <text start="325.51" dur="4.44">the savings accounts pay so it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="327.91" dur="4.89">to depend on every person it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="329.95" dur="4.2">change you know Charles and I we have</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="3.27">more in gold than what we would</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="3.72">recommend other people but because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.07" dur="4.32">in this space we feel comfortable here</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="5.1">but everyone&amp;#39;s number is gonna be a</text>
  <text start="340.39" dur="3.99">little bit different gotcha and speaking</text>
  <text start="342.97" dur="3">of the stock market you know you guys</text>
  <text start="344.38" dur="4.47">definitely help people invest in gold</text>
  <text start="345.97" dur="5.07">but you also as noted by your background</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="5.01">work with Bitcoin and one thing I saw</text>
  <text start="351.04" dur="6.3">the other week was that the nasdaq CEO</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="6.06">is essentially blessing bitcoin saying</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="4.74">that they&amp;#39;re a fan of it what are your</text>
  <text start="359.92" dur="3.6">thoughts on that yeah so they are what</text>
  <text start="362.08" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re gonna be doing is they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="4.5">be working with the Winklevoss twins who</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="3.51">have one of the larger exchanges which</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="4.32">is called Gemini and they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="369.64" dur="5.97">ahead and they&amp;#39;ve already started the</text>
  <text start="372.34" dur="5.01">process of giving that company the</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="4.31">technology so that they can build a</text>
  <text start="377.35" dur="3.84">platform so that more investors can buy</text>
  <text start="379.92" dur="4.06">cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="381.19" dur="6.21">what that&amp;#39;s going to do the more access</text>
  <text start="383.98" dur="5.43">to traders that are able to buy kryptos</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="4.38">the better it&amp;#39;s better for the price</text>
  <text start="389.41" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s better for liquidity it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="391.78" dur="5.01">give more access to just basically the</text>
  <text start="393.82" dur="4.32">market so by Nasdaq one of the major</text>
  <text start="396.79" dur="3.93">exchanges saying that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="4.17">go ahead and create a platform they know</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="2.88">that the price is going to continue to</text>
  <text start="402.31" dur="3.09">go up they&amp;#39;re not going to jump into</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="4.32">this market unless they see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.4" dur="4.41">huge growth potential so I think when</text>
  <text start="407.92" dur="4.17">you look at the price of Bitcoin just to</text>
  <text start="409.81" dur="5.54">take one of the coins you know Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="412.09" dur="5.89">right now is hitting about 9600</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="7.86">this morning you look where it was</text>
  <text start="417.98" dur="8.02">starting April 1st at 6600 we&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="8.13">at a 40% gain in the last six weeks so</text>
  <text start="426" dur="8.31">it&amp;#39;s moving and you known as XJ in where</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="5.07">could it go I think the price of Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="434.31" dur="4.98">and some of the major points is really</text>
  <text start="436.41" dur="6.36">going to skyrocket here so people that</text>
  <text start="439.29" dur="5.24">want to do it either in an IRA which i</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="3.66">think is the best way to do it because</text>
  <text start="444.53" dur="4.87">you know literally if you bought it</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="5.43">April 1st and it went up 40% you could</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="4.77">sell it today keep the money in the IRA</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="3.93">and you avoid that big tax bill which is</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="3.18">you know one of the big problems when</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="3">you have big games is that you know</text>
  <text start="457.35" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re gonna have to pay on that 40%</text>
  <text start="458.79" dur="6.18">game in the IRA you keep it in the IRA</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="5.34">you avoid that until retirement so you</text>
  <text start="464.97" dur="3.83">know I think that it&amp;#39;s exciting that</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s going to happen with Kryptos and</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="4">you know I think that the price and the</text>
  <text start="471" dur="4.92">price is still low it&amp;#39;s still half of</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="5.22">where it was mm-hmm pointing at 19,000</text>
  <text start="475.92" dur="4.62">and some change in in December of last</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="4.83">year so there&amp;#39;s still a lot of movement</text>
  <text start="480.54" dur="5.13">there so it looks like there&amp;#39;s positive</text>
  <text start="482.85" dur="5.79">news both on the cryptocurrency front</text>
  <text start="485.67" dur="4.47">and also on the precious metal front so</text>
  <text start="488.64" dur="3.21">what would you just say to somebody</text>
  <text start="490.14" dur="4.29">who&amp;#39;s trying to decide which one to go</text>
  <text start="491.85" dur="4.44">into or would you say both we have a lot</text>
  <text start="494.43" dur="4.83">of message doing both you know it</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="5.1">depends gold is is gold and silver</text>
  <text start="499.26" dur="4.53">typically more stable investments</text>
  <text start="501.39" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re gonna outperform inflation and</text>
  <text start="503.79" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very safe and steady</text>
  <text start="507.12" dur="4.26">so someone that&amp;#39;s looking at this they</text>
  <text start="508.83" dur="4.44">just want kind of an insurance policy</text>
  <text start="511.38" dur="3.93">type of investment that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="4.41">the one for them some one that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="5.13">little bit more risk-averse that sees</text>
  <text start="517.68" dur="4.41">the potential with crypto currencies you</text>
  <text start="520.44" dur="3.87">know they get our free guide which</text>
  <text start="522.09" dur="3.63">explains Bitcoin and and we have an</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="3.57">aetherium guide so they can really learn</text>
  <text start="525.72" dur="4.05">about it but someone that&amp;#39;s willing to</text>
  <text start="527.88" dur="4.89">that has some money that they&amp;#39;re willing</text>
  <text start="529.77" dur="5.7">to risk and they want to be a little bit</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="5.37">dive into this market somehow and kind</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="4.62">of get a taste of this potential then I</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="3.51">would say you know kryptos could be good</text>
  <text start="540.09" dur="3.51">for them and we and we explain</text>
  <text start="541.65" dur="3.84">everything we we break down the process</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="5.859">so anybody can understand it it&amp;#39;s really</text>

  <text start="551.29" dur="4.799">make it easy once they&amp;#39;re comfortable</text>
