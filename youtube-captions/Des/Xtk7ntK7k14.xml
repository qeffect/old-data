  <text start="0.03" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s up guys in this video January</text>
  <text start="3.09" dur="5.37">31st I think I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about health</text>
  <text start="5.73" dur="5.85">because you know looking at the</text>
  <text start="8.46" dur="4.349">spiritual community or what not a lot of</text>
  <text start="11.58" dur="3.3">people talk about living high</text>
  <text start="12.809" dur="5.131">vibrationally but I don&amp;#39;t see much</text>
  <text start="14.88" dur="5.52">substance discussed for many people in</text>
  <text start="17.94" dur="4.23">regards to what&amp;#39;s going on with our</text>
  <text start="20.4" dur="3.84">health care system and how to be healthy</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="4.769">in each you know layer who you are the</text>
  <text start="24.24" dur="5.459">physical physiological mental emotional</text>
  <text start="26.939" dur="10.89">so I&amp;#39;m gonna discuss that a little bit</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="11.04">and of course in the halls of the owners</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="4.351">of this world per se health is the one</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="4.381">of the biggest things they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="5.19">necessarily teach us right there&amp;#39;s the I</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="4.68">call it the two bodies of knowledge that</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re not told we have the and I think I</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="3.75">got this from Mark Pass you called</text>
  <text start="51.18" dur="4.379">Arcana and Arcana is a body of knowledge</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s only two things they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="55.559" dur="3.331">us and they don&amp;#39;t teach us in school to</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="4.16">keep us ignorant and control us there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.89" dur="5.009">the lesser Arcana and the greater Arcana</text>
  <text start="61.25" dur="4.84">kind of like the as above so below law</text>
  <text start="63.899" dur="4.921">of Correspondence concept we have the</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="4.95">greater Arcana being that as above that</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="5.01">body of knowledge that pertains to how</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="4.829">the world functions how our solar system</text>
  <text start="73.83" dur="4.109">functions what&amp;#39;s going on you know</text>
  <text start="75.869" dur="3.601">globally collectively then we have the</text>
  <text start="77.939" dur="3.72">lesser Arcana that&amp;#39;s everything</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="5.399">pertaining to us individually who we are</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="4.561">day-to-day lives habits then you know</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.43">thinking in school they don&amp;#39;t teach you</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="6.539">how to deal with the system we have</text>
  <text start="89.299" dur="6.371">balance checkbooks and tune your car and</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="5.911"> like that and they also don&amp;#39;t teach</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="4.89">us about the systems in which we could</text>
  <text start="98.67" dur="3.269">potentially have gift economies and</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="2.91">obviously you know things would</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="3.661">transform our world and they&amp;#39;d also</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="7.64">don&amp;#39;t teach us how to literally eat and</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="8.04">move and basic things like that so the</text>
  <text start="111.11" dur="5.38">managers have always controlled our</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="5.339">health care system and this is a crucial</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="5">point I&amp;#39;ll be making videos on this the</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="5.791">history of health care I should say</text>
  <text start="121.49" dur="6.1">that&amp;#39;s a big thing to for many people to</text>
  <text start="124.77" dur="4.65">understand is the history of that how</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve controlled that lesser Arkana</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="4.02">through the Rockefeller medical system</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="4.44">at least in this country in America</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="8.15">and then globally with other programs in</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="5.18">Europe but the Rockefeller set up the</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="5.29">education system in the early 1900s I</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="4.77">believe it was 1903 in which they set up</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="3.92">their general education board and then</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="6.24">they set up the American Medical</text>
  <text start="150.83" dur="7.03">Association shortly thereafter so this</text>
  <text start="155.52" dur="6.39">this pivotal point in time is sanitized</text>
  <text start="157.86" dur="6.72">from textbooks from you know health</text>
  <text start="161.91" dur="4.17">teaching courses and the Rockefellers</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="4.71">literally hired a guy they hired a guy</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="5.52">named Abraham Flexner and he went around</text>
  <text start="169.29" dur="4.41">the country teaching doctors how to</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="4.35">prescribe more pharmaceutical medication</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="4.8">because the Rockefellers remember they</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="4.44">were they were large investors in the</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="3.9">oil industry and also the petrochemical</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="4.13">industry Rockefellers on this side of</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="5.4">the ocean did a lot of work with</text>
  <text start="184.52" dur="4.99">companies in Germany such as IG Farben</text>
  <text start="187.8" dur="4.8">and corporations and the other side of</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="7.47">the ocean who made chemicals and you</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="6.06">know that corporate governmental control</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="5.07">has always been that way always</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="5.22">you basically rape and pillage in any</text>
  <text start="202.05" dur="3.36">which way they can and they use</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="3.03">chemicals not only for heavy industry</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="4.98">like oil and military industrial complex</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="6.6">and transportation but pharmaceuticals</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="4.349">are made with petrochemicals and far the</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="3.27">pharmaceutical industry is the</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="4.531">highest-grossing industry currently</text>
  <text start="216.78" dur="4.92">right now out of all of them the highest</text>
  <text start="219.27" dur="5.61">profitable profit industry I believe</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="6.06">over trillion a year if not more and not</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="6.26">even oil in the financial system and</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="7.47">others bring in that type of return and</text>
  <text start="231.14" dur="6.64">it&amp;#39;s because they sell product they sell</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="4.59">product and talk about consumerism you</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="4.77">must consume these drugs for the rest of</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="4.199">your life because there&amp;#39;s no money in a</text>
  <text start="242.55" dur="2.61">healthy person there&amp;#39;s only there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="3.69">money in a dead person there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="4.68">money in sick people and people are sick</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="4.321">when they&amp;#39;re kept ignorant so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="3.78">the Rockefellers not only set up the</text>
  <text start="252.03" dur="3.739">Medical Association but they had to</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="5.28">educate the doctors they had to educate</text>
  <text start="255.769" dur="4.571">they had to think make the doctors think</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="3.57">they were getting an education that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s crucial because when they can</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="4.32">then mislead those in which the</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="5.1">population believes to be Authority</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="6.66">now you can see exactly how the</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="6.53">situation is controlled in and has</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="4.77">gotten as large as it has is because</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="5.47">people think they&amp;#39;re right when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="7.02">wrong and egos don&amp;#39;t like to be wrong</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="5.01">and think of a doctor they spend a</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="3.24">hundred thousand dollars to go to a</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="3.33">fancy institution and they are told that</text>
  <text start="288.48" dur="6.66">they are the smartest brightest people</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="7.02">in the world so their ego is entrenched</text>
  <text start="295.14" dur="3.84">in believing exactly what they&amp;#39;re told</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="3.78">they don&amp;#39;t want to see the alternative</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="3.33">they literally like they&amp;#39;re the deep</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="3.03">root of their being does not want to see</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="3">that because that would shatter the</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="4.8">foundations of who they believe</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="4.71">themselves to be and then the populist</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="3.51">looks to the literally the people who</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="4.8">are least likely to change their minds</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="5.16">on the planet the health professionals</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="5.24">themselves everybody looks to them as</text>
  <text start="317.04" dur="8.1">being right and correct when they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="8.83">they&amp;#39;re not even close so I mean</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="5.85">obviously people tell me you know what</text>
  <text start="328.89" dur="5.73">would you do without doctors well if I</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="5.19">break a bone or you know I have a I step</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="3.3">on a nail I&amp;#39;m gonna go to a doctor I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="3.33">gonna get me an emergent mergency</text>
  <text start="337.92" dur="3.42">medicines great is what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="339.51" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s the care for the self that doctors</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="4.77">are you know the continual care for the</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="6.03">self the day-to-day that lifetime health</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="7.05">concept care for self that doctors have</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="5.76">no clue about I&amp;#39;ve give me a medical</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="6.09">doctor that tells me about posture and</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="5.52">how to keep my body aligned let him</text>
  <text start="361.98" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t have a clue I was talking to an</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="4.56">oncologist a couple months ago and he</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="3.81">was you know I he was talking to a</text>
  <text start="367.89" dur="4.07">friend I was just sitting next to him</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="4.56">and his buddy in a coffee shop and this</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="4.3">oncologist breast cancer oncologists</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="4.53">talking to lecturing his friend about</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="6.3">breast cancer I look over I&amp;#39;m like hey</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="7.47">so and I heard in conversation that they</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t know what causes cancer I turn</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="5.1">over I say don&amp;#39;t you know hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="5.85">research supported no how did I phrase</text>
  <text start="391.23" dur="4.86">that question I said how does it you</text>
  <text start="394.14" dur="4.83">know toxins our environment any anything</text>
  <text start="396.09" dur="4.29">like that been found to cause cancer and</text>
  <text start="398.97" dur="3.18">he looks he goes oh you know</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="6.75">research really doesn&amp;#39;t support that you</text>
  <text start="402.15" dur="8.94">know everything they&amp;#39;ve looked at but</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="7.47">will so yeah it must be understood</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="7.71">these concepts of the education system</text>
  <text start="414.6" dur="9.36">itself was created to thus mislead the</text>
  <text start="418.8" dur="6.68">other industries so those are my</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="3.93">thoughts on that on the Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="425.48" dur="6.22">medical system and how they&amp;#39;ve missed</text>
  <text start="427.89" dur="5.37">mislead the leaders so I&amp;#39;ll make a</text>
