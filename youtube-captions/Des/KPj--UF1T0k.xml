  <text start="15.929" dur="3.231">followers it&amp;#39;s really exciting over a</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="3.809">hundred thousand now on YouTube alone</text>
  <text start="19.16" dur="4.15">and I know a lot of people are curious</text>
  <text start="21.449" dur="3.301">you know starting at the beginning which</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="3.42">is a great way to learn about someone</text>
  <text start="24.75" dur="5.24">you know were you always like this as a</text>
  <text start="26.73" dur="4.98">kid were you into more sort of mature</text>
  <text start="29.99" dur="5.65">conversations what was your childhood</text>
  <text start="31.71" dur="4.41">like my childhood was far different than</text>
  <text start="35.64" dur="2.37">it is now</text>
  <text start="36.12" dur="3.81">I mean the only way somebody is really</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="4.41">gonna get into a lot of this stuff in</text>
  <text start="39.93" dur="5.1">this day and age is to have them had</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="10.17">their parents grow them up in this kind</text>
  <text start="45.03" dur="10.32">of higher consciousness in that so as I</text>
  <text start="52.59" dur="5.519">went to high school I was the kind of a</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="5.119">typical kid I played a little bit of</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="5.401">sports played some high school soccer I</text>
  <text start="60.469" dur="5.681">wasn&amp;#39;t the most popular person but I</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="7.89">wasn&amp;#39;t the most shy person either and I</text>
  <text start="66.15" dur="8.719">did what any standard status quo kid</text>
  <text start="71.4" dur="6.96">does and I went to state university so</text>
  <text start="74.869" dur="5.5">through high school I did the standard</text>
  <text start="78.36" dur="4.29">thing and picked a college to go to</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="4.5">ended up going to Washington State</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="5.75">University which was located in my home</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="6.471">state of Washington and graduated with</text>
  <text start="88.4" dur="5.53">me and grades kind of rode my</text>
  <text start="91.34" dur="4.45">standardized test scores my ECT and SAT</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="3.96">into college and ended up going to</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="5.49">college for architecture and</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="5.13">construction believe it or not so no I</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="6.42">definitely have not been into this</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="8.669">although in college I I did begin to</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="5.73">search for answers search for different</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="3.151">truths as to what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="3.99">granted it was on a far different</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="5.01">capacity as in it as it is now I was</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="6.72">actually a pretty staunch atheist in</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="6.059">high school and I remember in high</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="3.24">school I watched a zeitgeist if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="4.111">familiar with that documentary</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="4.92">a free documentary that helps awaken a</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="3.87">lot of people granted the only part of</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="3.84">it that I was interested in at the time</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="4.2">and this is the first movie and the only</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="5.49">part I was interested in was the expose</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="5.88">on standardized religion so that part</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="4.98">helped wake me up I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I was</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="7.28">actually waking up on the path of full</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="7.47">truth but I was interested in underlying</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="7.39">realities of our planet but then of</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="6.57">course after college and up to where I</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="4.5">am now in my whole actual awakening</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="5.88">process is where I broke down a lot of</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="5.1">those ego constructs so in short to</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="4.29">answer that question no definitely was</text>
  <text start="168.24" dur="3.93">not like this when I was younger well</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="2.82">that&amp;#39;s probably gonna be reassuring for</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="3.03">a lot of people to hear out there I mean</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="3.27">I can relate to that I definitely did</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="4.289">not get get cooked in the soup of</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="4.29">consciousness but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s progress</text>
  <text start="179.489" dur="4.171">them so at what point would you say you</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="5.28">really had sort of that that aha</text>
  <text start="183.66" dur="6.03">where your life change you weren&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="6.06">were no longer not on your path I guess</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="4.5">is how you say it totally so progressing</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="5.28">then a couple years later I graduated</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="6.299">from high school I went to state</text>
  <text start="197.82" dur="5.28">university I was in State University for</text>
  <text start="200.489" dur="4.47">one year I did a little bit of too much</text>
  <text start="203.1" dur="3.81">partying and ended up dropping out of</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="4.651">State University in went to Community</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="4.2">College now when I went back home and</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="5.43">started going to the Community College</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="7.29">at the same time I got a job at a local</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="5.3">health food store and this was a very</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="5.25">high-profile health food store we had</text>
  <text start="220.34" dur="7.119">very good products it was a very busy</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="5.97">store and the owners and workers there</text>
  <text start="227.459" dur="4.081">were extremely high conscious you know</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="3.81">it wasn&amp;#39;t kind of your standard we did a</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="4.979">lot of sports nutrition but it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="6.089">your standard what do you want to say</text>
  <text start="236.519" dur="7.381">kind of meathead type of place it was we</text>
  <text start="239.519" dur="8.28">had a lot of fantastic natural non-gmo</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="5.79">organic supplements we had various</text>
  <text start="247.799" dur="4.651">medicines I don&amp;#39;t even call them</text>
  <text start="249.69" dur="4.019">supplements but medicines that were far</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="3.48">deeper than anything you would ever find</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="5.941">in a normal health food store so working</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="7.2">there is really what initiated my actual</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="6.78">aha moment and then it was about six to</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="4.69">nine months into working there where it</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="4.87">really blew my</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="5.1">because one day I remember a customer</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="2.94">coming in and the customer was talking</text>
  <text start="272.92" dur="4.71">to my manager and they were talking</text>
  <text start="274.24" dur="6.27">about various things of geopolitics and</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="6.15">it was aspects of geopolitics that I had</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="7.29">never heard before and this was I was</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="6">wanting to know more so they pointed me</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.11">in the direction of various</text>
  <text start="289.78" dur="4.17">documentaries and certain resources that</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="3.9">I started digging into and it just blew</text>
  <text start="293.95" dur="4.71">my mind I mean these guys pointed me by</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="5.58">way of the financial system and the</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="5.58">truce on hue engineering or chemtrails I</text>
  <text start="301.39" dur="5.73">started learning about pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="6.33">corruption various cancer cures fluoride</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="5.46">vaccines I mean all of it and once I</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.43">really started getting into the depths</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="5.25">of things I was just hungry for</text>
  <text start="315" dur="6.61">everything I went down every rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="6.21">I could find very very fast so it was</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="4.35">only within a matter of probably a few</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="4.62">months that I was learning about okay</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="4.31">fluoride GMOs vaccines suppress cancer</text>
  <text start="328.66" dur="4.26">cures oh my gosh geoengineering</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="6.34">financial corruption then naturally I</text>
  <text start="332.92" dur="8.01">went into free energy and the UFO topic</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="7.41">and everything and this I mean it was</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="6.36">shocking it was shocking to me but I was</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="5.85">I was you know such an avid researcher</text>
  <text start="347.29" dur="5.4">and I remember being in a class in</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="4.98">Community College and each station for</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="3.63">the students had a computer and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354.85" dur="3.12">remember what the class was it might</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="3.68">have been physics or history or</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="3.96">something but here I was researching</text>
  <text start="360" dur="3.19">Rothchilds and geoengineering all this</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="2.52">stuff on the computers and I wasn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="363.19" dur="5.67">didn&amp;#39;t care about what they were</text>
  <text start="364.45" dur="6.57">teaching us so naturally then I just</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="4.8">gave up University I never really even</text>
  <text start="371.02" dur="4.86">had my heart into it so totally dropped</text>
  <text start="373.66" dur="3.75">out of college and then I began working</text>
  <text start="375.88" dur="3.93">at this health food store completely</text>
  <text start="377.41" dur="4.47">because I was making such what I was</text>
  <text start="379.81" dur="4.65">making much more of an impact than I was</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="5.55">anywhere and I ended up working for that</text>
  <text start="384.46" dur="5.43">store for about four to five years and I</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="4.11">learned the depths of so many different</text>
  <text start="389.89" dur="4.26">things that I&amp;#39;m absolutely grateful for</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="6.27">because it gave me a huge perspective on</text>
  <text start="394.15" dur="6.15">us humans human health how to feed</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="3.54">ourselves take care of ourselves and you</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="3.39">know the</text>
  <text start="401.35" dur="4.86">all the fake news they try to give us an</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="4.59">but I learned a lot of other things met</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="3.96">some amazing people and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.28" dur="4.92">how I got into my awakening process</text>
  <text start="410.17" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re fabulous you know I think a lot</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="2.94">of people are gonna resonate with your</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="3.18">particular path and that is exactly what</text>
  <text start="416.14" dur="4.02">happened to me in fact it was through</text>
  <text start="417.55" dur="4.65">getting sort of slingshot into holistic</text>
  <text start="420.16" dur="3.72">health as a patient you know flunking</text>
  <text start="422.2" dur="3.99">out of the medical model decades ago and</text>
  <text start="423.88" dur="4.92">actually getting my eyes open to</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="3.99">functional holistic medicine clinical</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="4.77">nutrition and the fact that you can</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="5.4">really do as you said medicine level</text>
  <text start="433.57" dur="5.25">work with this stuff and it&amp;#39;s just an</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="5.25">easy and fast progression into all the</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="4.86">odds that keep going on as we wake up</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="5.46">more and more into what it&amp;#39;s about in</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="5.91">especially in our culture with health</text>
  <text start="446.29" dur="4.56">and well-being so so here we are and now</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;ve got over a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="450.85" dur="3.81">subscribers on YouTube so how did what</text>
  <text start="452.98" dur="3.87">was the bridge for you where you decided</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="6.24">to do a YouTube channel itself totally</text>
  <text start="456.85" dur="8.55">so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s two answers to this</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="8.1">question and the first part that I want</text>
  <text start="465.4" dur="6.48">to explain this with is that during this</text>
  <text start="469" dur="4.02">awakening stage you know it was very</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="3.17">lonely and it happens for a lot of</text>
  <text start="473.02" dur="4.59">people it&amp;#39;s shocking it&amp;#39;s lonely you get</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="4.09">paranoid and nervous and scared because</text>
  <text start="477.61" dur="4.74">I oh my god the world&amp;#39;s really this way</text>
  <text start="479.14" dur="6.27">oh and that was me that was me for two</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="4.83">three even four years and it started</text>
  <text start="485.41" dur="4.71">gravitating away from a lot of people in</text>
  <text start="487.18" dur="7.23">your life your relationships take a very</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="6.21">sharp turn and I was looking for solace</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="7.08">somewhere I was looking for help and</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="7.17">hope in you know some kind of some kind</text>
  <text start="501.49" dur="5.46">of assistance and I found that through</text>
  <text start="503.5" dur="6.06">people on YouTube and one name primarily</text>
  <text start="506.95" dur="3.84">that I watched a ton of his videos and I</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="4.109">still watch his videos time and again</text>
  <text start="510.79" dur="4.41">his name was Elliott Hulse and his</text>
  <text start="513.669" dur="6.091">videos on YouTube</text>
  <text start="515.2" dur="7.17">they weren&amp;#39;t conspiracy videos for lack</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="4.74">of a better term but they were very</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="3.54">higher conscious and I mean he had a</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="2.7">fitness background he had a fitness</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="3.06">YouTube channel but it wasn&amp;#39;t your</text>
  <text start="527.2" dur="4.29">standard like I said meathead fitness</text>
  <text start="528.97" dur="5.919">channel he was quoting Ralph Waldo</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="5.05">Emerson and dr. Joseph Campbell and</text>
  <text start="534.889" dur="4.17">throwing out some crazy philosophies</text>
  <text start="536.54" dur="5.609">through his videos and his videos were</text>
  <text start="539.059" dur="7.68">basically most of them were five to ten</text>
  <text start="542.149" dur="6.66">minute just clips of him talking and so</text>
  <text start="546.739" dur="4.59">I mean millions thousands millions of</text>
  <text start="548.809" dur="4.62">young men which is the age range I was</text>
  <text start="551.329" dur="3.391">in was it was helping them there was</text>
  <text start="553.429" dur="2.22">something to motivate them and for them</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="4.919">to find their way and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="555.649" dur="6.93">what happened to me so I I had that and</text>
  <text start="559.639" dur="4.86">then the second answer to this question</text>
  <text start="562.579" dur="4.38">is that after I worked at that health</text>
  <text start="564.499" dur="4.95">food store I left and then I had a</text>
  <text start="566.959" dur="4.23">couple other I don&amp;#39;t want to say odd</text>
  <text start="569.449" dur="3.87">jobs but it was also in the health care</text>
  <text start="571.189" dur="5.64">realm but it just wasn&amp;#39;t fulfilling me</text>
  <text start="573.319" dur="6.51">so it got to a point at the end of 2016</text>
  <text start="576.829" dur="5.19">and at the beginning of 2017 where I</text>
  <text start="579.829" dur="5.581">began finding that courage to speak out</text>
  <text start="582.019" dur="6.06">about these subjects and I tried writing</text>
  <text start="585.41" dur="3.209">I wrote some guest articles for a couple</text>
  <text start="588.079" dur="3.331">websites</text>
  <text start="588.619" dur="4.861">one blog or website was called stillness</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="2.969">in the storm and I wrote articles for</text>
  <text start="593.48" dur="3.509">them but I found that I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="594.379" dur="5.79">necessarily the best writer in that</text>
  <text start="596.989" dur="5.16">instance of writing articles but I kind</text>
  <text start="600.169" dur="5.79">of had this aha moment one day I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="602.149" dur="6">what if I just did YouTube and what if I</text>
  <text start="605.959" dur="4.23">just did those kinds of videos where it</text>
  <text start="608.149" dur="4.261">might have been five ten maybe fifteen</text>
  <text start="610.189" dur="5.221">minute videos where I&amp;#39;m speaking on</text>
  <text start="612.41" dur="5.729">these subjects and helping a lot of</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="5.25">people find their way in this crazy</text>
  <text start="618.139" dur="5.401">world because that&amp;#39;s where I was at</text>
  <text start="620.66" dur="4.859">three four five years ago and what if I</text>
  <text start="623.54" dur="7.68">take that model that Ellie also was</text>
  <text start="625.519" dur="8.81">doing and apply that to this like I said</text>
  <text start="631.22" dur="5.88">conspiratorial or higher consciousness</text>
  <text start="634.329" dur="4.271">avenues and you know that would be</text>
  <text start="637.1" dur="4.469">perfect cuz I didn&amp;#39;t see anybody else</text>
  <text start="638.6" dur="4.56">doing that and not only would I speak on</text>
  <text start="641.569" dur="3.781">I ended up kind of gravitating towards a</text>
  <text start="643.16" dur="3.719">lot of new stuff just to help people see</text>
  <text start="645.35" dur="3.149">what&amp;#39;s going on but of course there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="646.879" dur="4.44">lot of other videos where I&amp;#39;m just like</text>
  <text start="648.499" dur="5.161">that giving five ten minute talks on my</text>
  <text start="651.319" dur="5.67">opinions my perspective my experiences</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="5.519">and it ended up happening where so many</text>
  <text start="656.989" dur="4.44">people like you said 100 thousand the</text>
  <text start="659.179" dur="4.65">first year now we&amp;#39;re gravitating towards</text>
  <text start="661.429" dur="4.71">just what I was throwing out there just</text>
  <text start="663.829" dur="4.44">me being authentic I mean I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="666.139" dur="2.551">cutting or editing these videos and I</text>
  <text start="668.269" dur="2.671">was being</text>
  <text start="668.69" dur="5.73">completely straight up and like hey this</text>
  <text start="670.94" dur="5.4">is what I think and I was being honest -</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m like I kept saying in my videos like</text>
  <text start="676.34" dur="4.29">this isn&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t claim to be some kind</text>
  <text start="678.47" dur="4.29">of all-knowing harbinger of truth but</text>
  <text start="680.63" dur="4.11">this is just the way I&amp;#39;m seeing it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="682.76" dur="4.95">gonna source some things and tell you</text>
  <text start="684.74" dur="4.68">why I&amp;#39;m seeing it this way and ended up</text>
  <text start="687.71" dur="5.67">just a lot of people love that message</text>
  <text start="689.42" dur="5.46">so I&amp;#39;m really doing it to help the</text>
  <text start="693.38" dur="3.78">collective consciousness spread these</text>
  <text start="694.88" dur="3.72">messages out there but also help a lot</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="2.91">of people find solace because I know</text>
  <text start="698.6" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s plenty of people out there who</text>
  <text start="700.07" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t have anybody to talk to about</text>
  <text start="701.99" dur="4.77">these things and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="703.7" dur="5.13">favorite part of doing this is the</text>
  <text start="706.76" dur="4.52">people who actually you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="708.83" dur="4.83">every day there&amp;#39;s a video of them to</text>
  <text start="711.28" dur="5.35">watch of mine and it&amp;#39;s like the only</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="4.5">chance they have to hear these things</text>
  <text start="716.63" dur="4.02">from somebody who seems like a normal</text>
  <text start="718.16" dur="4.08">dude and is just making them feel like</text>
  <text start="720.65" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re normal like they&amp;#39;re not crazy</text>
  <text start="722.24" dur="4.44">for delving into these subjects and</text>
  <text start="724.46" dur="4.17">thinking these things so that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="726.68" dur="4.41">kind of it was a very interesting just</text>
  <text start="728.63" dur="5.1">divine leeway it&amp;#39;s all weave together</text>
  <text start="731.09" dur="5.28">over the past four or five years that I</text>
  <text start="733.73" dur="5.31">just got sick of college I got sick of</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="6.86">corporate jobs and I took I took these</text>
  <text start="739.04" dur="6.63">different models that I saw various</text>
  <text start="743.23" dur="4.62">mentors of mine use and I just kind of</text>
  <text start="745.67" dur="4.92">weed that all together and put it online</text>
  <text start="747.85" dur="4.36">yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a fantastic story and</text>
  <text start="750.59" dur="3.45">I know one of my mentors early and</text>
  <text start="752.21" dur="3.9">personal development said the deepest</text>
  <text start="754.04" dur="4.68">human longing is to belong and the fact</text>
  <text start="756.11" dur="4.35">that you&amp;#39;ve created this this place for</text>
  <text start="758.72" dur="2.25">people to belong and really to touch</text>
  <text start="760.46" dur="3">them</text>
  <text start="760.97" dur="4.56">I know only someone who went through</text>
  <text start="763.46" dur="4.17">that phase of sort of the dark night of</text>
  <text start="765.53" dur="3.87">the soul would really feel compelled to</text>
  <text start="767.63" dur="4.26">contribute it back this way and I know</text>
  <text start="769.4" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s really appreciated by so many so</text>
  <text start="771.89" dur="3.15">as you&amp;#39;ve made this transition now and</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="3.87">now you&amp;#39;re giving back and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="775.04" dur="4.14">helping others awaken you know what kind</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="4.23">of experiences are you having from this</text>
  <text start="779.18" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;m having some of the most amazing</text>
  <text start="781.64" dur="4.29">experiences I mean one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="784.28" dur="3.78">that I did this YouTube channel is</text>
  <text start="785.93" dur="4.26">because of the personal development and</text>
  <text start="788.06" dur="5.46">the self growth behind that believe it</text>
  <text start="790.19" dur="6.36">or not when I was younger and even</text>
  <text start="793.52" dur="7.83">earlier this year I was pretty</text>
  <text start="796.55" dur="6.06">introverted and I you know I was scared</text>
  <text start="801.35" dur="3">to speak my mind about</text>
  <text start="802.61" dur="4.44">a lot of things that&amp;#39;s kind of been a</text>
  <text start="804.35" dur="4.47">recurrent theme and a lot of personal</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="4.71">professional relationships I&amp;#39;ve had is</text>
  <text start="808.82" dur="5.459">just having the courage to say what</text>
  <text start="811.76" dur="4.68">needs to be said so I figured I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="814.279" dur="4.321">okay I have an opportunity with with</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="5.31">this YouTube channel to help in a</text>
  <text start="818.6" dur="6">specific niche but also help myself</text>
  <text start="821.75" dur="5.79">so not only do I teach but I learn at</text>
  <text start="824.6" dur="5.82">the same time and I have gained so much</text>
  <text start="827.54" dur="4.919">confidence in doing these videos and</text>
  <text start="830.42" dur="5.22">just putting myself out there and not</text>
  <text start="832.459" dur="5.761">only that but I have learned that in</text>
  <text start="835.64" dur="5.1">this world a lot of people really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="838.22" dur="4.109">have their together as much as some</text>
  <text start="840.74" dur="3.93">people think and that&amp;#39;s almost one of</text>
  <text start="842.329" dur="7.32">the biggest objectives I have is just to</text>
  <text start="844.67" dur="6.84">help people realize that no we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="849.649" dur="5.731">be placing anybody on a pedestal even</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="6.6">the people you think are so intelligent</text>
  <text start="855.38" dur="4.199">and so well-read and so knowing there</text>
  <text start="858.11" dur="3.33">might be a lot of things that they even</text>
  <text start="859.579" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t understand or might have twisted</text>
  <text start="861.44" dur="5.73">or backwards so my one of the goals I</text>
  <text start="865.399" dur="4.321">have now is just to help people realize</text>
  <text start="867.17" dur="6.779">that like hey don&amp;#39;t be searching for</text>
  <text start="869.72" dur="5.76">truth or anything like that from these</text>
  <text start="873.949" dur="3.901">amazing people yeah you can get great</text>
  <text start="875.48" dur="5.039">information from them but it&amp;#39;s up to you</text>
  <text start="877.85" dur="5.429">it&amp;#39;s up to distill that for yourself to</text>
  <text start="880.519" dur="5.671">discern that for yourself and you can</text>
  <text start="883.279" dur="5.55">become just as good if not better than</text>
  <text start="886.19" dur="5.459">the people you&amp;#39;re looking up to now just</text>
  <text start="888.829" dur="7.2">by putting in the effort to research</text>
  <text start="891.649" dur="5.611">yourself and do that so yeah anything we</text>
  <text start="896.029" dur="3.781">can do to help people increase their</text>
  <text start="897.26" dur="6">sense of empowerment and discernment is</text>
  <text start="899.81" dur="5.73">a giant contribution in it exactly and</text>
  <text start="903.26" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like if I mess up in one of my</text>
  <text start="905.54" dur="4.83">videos I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t delete that video</text>
  <text start="908.24" dur="3.57">and I almost am more than happy to</text>
  <text start="910.37" dur="3.659">because that then shows vulnerability</text>
  <text start="911.81" dur="6.389">and I know a lot of people are looking</text>
  <text start="914.029" dur="5.941">up to me as a kind of you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="918.199" dur="3.721">say this egotistically but I&amp;#39;m just as a</text>
  <text start="919.97" dur="3.96">messiah like figure a kind of like</text>
  <text start="921.92" dur="5.039">prophet that&amp;#39;s just natural human beings</text>
  <text start="923.93" dur="6.029">have a natural tendency to idol worship</text>
  <text start="926.959" dur="4.921">so if I can break that tendency in</text>
  <text start="929.959" dur="4.11">people if I can screw up and make myself</text>
  <text start="931.88" dur="4.44">look vulnerable and they realize that</text>
  <text start="934.069" dur="4.411">they realize how I shouldn&amp;#39;t be worship</text>
  <text start="936.32" dur="6.12">anybody I should be doing this on my own</text>
  <text start="938.48" dur="6.87">well then great fantastic I helped</text>
  <text start="942.44" dur="3.69">somebody in some way even by screwing up</text>
  <text start="945.35" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="946.13" dur="3.75">exactly and the vulnerability is such a</text>
  <text start="948.26" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s such a source of empowerment for</text>
  <text start="949.88" dur="4.53">everyone and on that note one last</text>
  <text start="952.07" dur="4.11">question what do you do personally when</text>
  <text start="954.41" dur="3.33">the going gets really rough because you</text>
  <text start="956.18" dur="4.26">know you are a human and as you said</text>
  <text start="957.74" dur="5.67">you&amp;#39;re not a messiah so what are your</text>
  <text start="960.44" dur="4.38">ways of sort of reconverting your energy</text>
  <text start="963.41" dur="3.81">so that you can pick yourself back up</text>
  <text start="964.82" dur="4.44">after you&amp;#39;ve had a assault on social</text>
  <text start="967.22" dur="6.48">media or what do you do yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="969.26" dur="6.05">that&amp;#39;s that has been a fact that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="973.7" dur="3.96">happened to me is that there have been</text>
  <text start="975.31" dur="5.02">assaults and attacks and people some</text>
  <text start="977.66" dur="5.34">people might be naturally jealous or</text>
  <text start="980.33" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s some kind of ego construct they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="983" dur="3.99">getting over and I&amp;#39;m pretty positive</text>
  <text start="985.31" dur="4.11">there have been some people paid some</text>
  <text start="986.99" dur="5.28">actual agents to attack me and my work</text>
  <text start="989.42" dur="5.07">as well and when the going gets tough I</text>
