  <text start="78.119" dur="5.311">first go down here so right here we can</text>
  <text start="81.15" dur="4.98">confirm that this poster is actually Q</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="6.78">because this is the H hand administrator</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="6.57">and he&amp;#39;s confirming it here so we know</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="6.659">that it&amp;#39;s not a LARP with these specific</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="9.72">posts and there there&amp;#39;s not much to go</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="7.29">from with these a lot of very confusing</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="3.659">code it looks like but there is a couple</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="4.651">things that I will make note of right</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="5.131">here it says who is a MB matlock and I</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="5.55">presume that means ambassador Matlock</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="6.449">and ambassador Matlock Jack Foust</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="7.92">Matlock was an ambassador to the Soviet</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="6.691">Union from 1987 to 91 it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="4.92">still a living you know he was a cute</text>
  <text start="124.35" dur="5.07">this website that I found the Moscow</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="5.68">Times it says reagan&amp;#39;s soviet teacher</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="10.13">and apparently he was instrumental in</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="8.59">the assistance of the bringing the</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="5.34">Soviet Union and America together so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="6.6">not too sure what other meanings this</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="6.15">might have but you can of course look</text>
  <text start="148.07" dur="5.37">into that yourself and then also this</text>
  <text start="151.04" dur="6.6">one right here it says what makes a</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="6.12">movie good great actors and instantly</text>
  <text start="157.64" dur="5.01">what when I saw this one I thought of</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="6.39">the Donald Trump and Steve Bannon feud</text>
  <text start="162.65" dur="5.25">because when I saw that feud circulating</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="4.59">around the airwaves in the news</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="5.43">yesterday I kind of instantly had this</text>
  <text start="170.54" dur="7.08">gut reaction that it was some kind of</text>
  <text start="173.33" dur="8.07">show and this tweet right here by Dinesh</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="5.49">D&amp;#39;Souza confirms that he says wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="4.08">it be funny if Trump and Bannon cooked</text>
  <text start="183.11" dur="5.67">this one up together as a decoy for some</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="5.04">bombshell policy initiative and that</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="3.69">could very well be the case it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="190.52" dur="4.29">some kind of distraction for the</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="4.739">mainstream media to chew on while a lot</text>
  <text start="194.81" dur="7.59">of other stuff goes on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="197.209" dur="8.611">so there&amp;#39;s that and also another drop</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="5.19">from cue that wasn&amp;#39;t in this picture</text>
  <text start="205.82" dur="6.06">here but basically just as seven out of</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="7.619">ten and that&amp;#39;s in reference to another</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="6.12">cue drop where he said that most plane</text>
  <text start="215.209" dur="6.451">crashes aren&amp;#39;t accidents seven out of</text>
  <text start="218" dur="6.42">ten are in fact very specific takedowns</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="8.04">with only three out of ten of them being</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="7.2">actual accidents so with this in regards</text>
  <text start="229.7" dur="3.93">to the circumstances of all the plane</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="3.899">anomalies and disappearances and weird</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="3.419">things going on we&amp;#39;ll actually talk</text>
  <text start="235.519" dur="4.44">about another plane disappearance in a</text>
  <text start="237.049" dur="3.811">couple minutes here interesting to know</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="2.941">keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="240.86" dur="5.37">a lot of plane stuff that goes on in the</text>
  <text start="242.9" dur="6.99">skies not a coincidence not an accident</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="6.569">and those the few things I wanted to</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="4.56">talk about in regards to cue and you</text>
  <text start="252.799" dur="4.981">know one last thing I do want to note</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="5.49">that I&amp;#39;ve seen some wise old men say on</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="5.28">the Internet is that we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="6.15">get into a savior complex with queue</text>
  <text start="263.06" dur="5.22">posts during those 10 days</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="5.39">of darkness the key was gone a lot of</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="5.639">people were getting upset and antsy and</text>
  <text start="271.48" dur="5.8">waiting for more queue posts to come</text>
  <text start="273.919" dur="5.161">when there&amp;#39;s so much other work to be</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="3.859">done and who even needs these queue</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="4.53">posts he&amp;#39;s already dropped enough and</text>
  <text start="281.139" dur="6.101">also I mean there&amp;#39;s so much stuff out</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="5.04">there to do so we just that being said</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="3.75">we don&amp;#39;t want to get into us kind of</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="3.92">Savior complex where we think he was</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="4.649">gonna go and save the world</text>
  <text start="292.57" dur="6.97">what Q&amp;#39;s trying to do is get us to save</text>
  <text start="295.639" dur="6.481">the world ourselves but anyway preaching</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="5.46">aside let&amp;#39;s now go into talking about</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="4.769">the Clinton house so of course do you</text>
  <text start="305" dur="3.75">mean I was gonna go last live last night</text>
  <text start="306.889" dur="3.871">just to talk about this but I was a</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="5.03">little bit busy but anyway Bill and</text>
  <text start="310.76" dur="6.75">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s home in New York</text>
  <text start="313.78" dur="6.31">wherever that is I&amp;#39;m not even gonna try</text>
  <text start="317.51" dur="5.52">and say that word shikaka Chappaqua New</text>
  <text start="320.09" dur="6.21">York the property caught on fire it was</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="4.47">not their main house it was an adjacent</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="3.33">property it was actually a Secret</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="4.229">Service building that&amp;#39;s right next to it</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="4.259">and we don&amp;#39;t necessarily know the cause</text>
  <text start="331.729" dur="3.901">of this house fire but once this</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="4.231">happened I mean everybody speculation</text>
  <text start="335.63" dur="6.21">ran wild with this one people were</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="8.04">thinking was it an evidence bird heck</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="5.79">who knows insurance are they trying to</text>
  <text start="346.16" dur="3.75">collect some insurance you know people</text>
  <text start="347.63" dur="4.11">have seen the ankle monitor or the boot</text>
  <text start="349.91" dur="3.96">I should say Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s boot on</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="5.91">that is likely hiding an ankle monitor</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="6.09">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of word that funding</text>
  <text start="357.65" dur="5.37">has been cut off to a lot of these cabal</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="6.889">members so if she means some money who</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="7.98">knows also this is a good one I saw is</text>
  <text start="366.849" dur="6.371">it an easy way for said white hats to</text>
  <text start="371" dur="4.59">get on to and into the property right</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="4.74">they can&amp;#39;t do that without a warrant</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="3.93">necessarily but if a fire goes off ooh</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="3.45">great way to get in there maybe collect</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="4.47">some evidence granted that evidence is</text>
  <text start="381.41" dur="4.5">not going to be permissible in court but</text>
  <text start="383.99" dur="6.06">who knows who knows the reasoning behind</text>
  <text start="385.91" dur="9.36">this one and interestingly enough one of</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="9.6">the previous cue drops was I have it on</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="6.54">my Twitter here</text>
  <text start="399.65" dur="3.9">not fighting this anyway one of the</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="5.52">previous cue drops was discussing how</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="5.369">they&amp;#39;re gonna smoke them out so the</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="6.93">interesting dot to connect with that one</text>
  <text start="408.919" dur="9.051">but yeah I saw this funny floating</text>
  <text start="414.26" dur="5.34">around somebody said fire marshals have</text>
  <text start="417.97" dur="3.46">determined the cause of the fire and</text>
  <text start="419.6" dur="5.58">they called it a spontaneous combustion</text>
  <text start="421.43" dur="6.03">of evidence ha anyway they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="425.18" dur="5.85">what exactly causes fire as far as I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="6.69">heard the fire cause has not been</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="4.83">determined quite yet but now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="4.53">about that plane disappearance so we had</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="6.26">a plane at takeoff from Oklahoma City</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="6.48">and it was supposed to land in Texas</text>
  <text start="442.12" dur="4.72">Georgetown Texas just a few hundred</text>
  <text start="445.16" dur="6.06">miles away I&amp;#39;m going to show you a</text>
  <text start="446.84" dur="6.75">screencap of the flight path of this so</text>
  <text start="451.22" dur="3.96">you can see here this is where it took</text>
  <text start="453.59" dur="3.06">off from middle of Oklahoma</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="5.07">and it was supposed to land in the</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="6.329">middle of Texas but as you can see it</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="5.22">veered off-course and it went basically</text>
  <text start="462.979" dur="5.071">a straight line for hundreds of miles</text>
  <text start="465.47" dur="6.24">far past where it was supposed to land</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="5.28">and then it lost contact they lost</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="4.56">contact with the plane it disappeared</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="7.83">off radar I&amp;#39;ve seen some news reports</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="6.45">say that the plane had likely crashed in</text>
  <text start="481.16" dur="3.99">the Gulf of Mexico but of course we</text>
  <text start="482.72" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t know it crashed pilot could have</text>
  <text start="485.15" dur="5.28">just turned off the transponder there</text>
  <text start="487.13" dur="7.05">and flew to wherever right so in regards</text>
  <text start="490.43" dur="6.56">to that 7 out of 10 right maybe this one</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="4.29">maybe this was somebody trying to escape</text>
  <text start="496.99" dur="5.32">who knows</text>
  <text start="498.47" dur="7.59">plausible could have been this plane was</text>
  <text start="502.31" dur="9.24">taken down somewhere but was very odd</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="7.95">occurrence and again this in combination</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="5.13">with all of the other weird anomalies</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;ve seen in planes with them having to</text>
  <text start="516.68" dur="3.09">turn back because there&amp;#39;s a bird in the</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="3.929">cockpit or there&amp;#39;s weird thumping noises</text>
  <text start="519.77" dur="6.27">or the back uation in airport because of</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="6.36">a bagel or a power outage or smoke or so</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="4.11">many weird things not only in America</text>
  <text start="528.589" dur="3.301">here but across the world you know I</text>
  <text start="530.15" dur="2.88">mentioned this in a video a few days ago</text>
  <text start="531.89" dur="4.47">but</text>
  <text start="533.03" dur="5.34">over in Europe there was a accident with</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="4.46">a fire alarm a few days ago about a week</text>
  <text start="538.37" dur="5.16">ago caused an airport to be evacuated</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="6.28">russia has had weird airport anomalies</text>
  <text start="543.53" dur="6.96">so all around the world man all around</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="5.67">the world and also all the flights going</text>
  <text start="550.49" dur="4.83">to Guantanamo a lot of people have their</text>
  <text start="552.77" dur="5.13">eyes on flights going to and from</text>
  <text start="555.32" dur="4.47">Guantanamo Bay of course there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="557.9" dur="4.5">of flights that are scheduled right</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re scheduled to go there so some</text>
  <text start="562.4" dur="4.29">flights are naturally gonna go and</text>
  <text start="564.08" dur="5.07">originate from Gitmo but there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="7.88">lot of odd ones with no call signs</text>
  <text start="569.15" dur="8.67">flying to and fro the area and in</text>
