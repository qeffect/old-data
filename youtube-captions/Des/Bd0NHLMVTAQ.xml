  <text start="0" dur="15.15">I wanted to film a quick video on this</text>
  <text start="13.11" dur="3.509">topic right here the Mandela effect cuz</text>
  <text start="15.15" dur="4.95">I&amp;#39;ve gotten quite a few questions about</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="5.311">this lately and honestly I see a lot of</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="3.45">people almost freaking out and getting</text>
  <text start="21.93" dur="4.56">their panties in a real bunch over this</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="6.12">issue because they have no idea you know</text>
  <text start="26.49" dur="5.129">how timelines are altering or what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="29.67" dur="3.54">going on with their their thoughts or</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="3.361">how the past is being altered or</text>
  <text start="33.21" dur="3.99">everything like that so what I want to</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="6.329">do is hopefully throw some thoughts and</text>
  <text start="37.2" dur="6.9">opinions of mine out there to quell the</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="6.121">fears anybody may have surrounding this</text>
  <text start="44.1" dur="6.92">topic and also I mean in my opinion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="6.24">very important to understand the</text>
  <text start="51.02" dur="4.99">underlying concepts of what&amp;#39;s causing</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="5.819">this so-called Mandela effect because it</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="6">gives some very important information as</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="5.941">to how human consciousness operates okay</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="5.37">so first and foremost what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="5.4">going on with the Mandela effect is that</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="7.32">human consciousness has the ability to</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="6">alter time both space and time okay and</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="4.23">this has been proven not only in the</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="4.01">alternative or pseudo scientific</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="4.17">community but even in the conventional</text>
  <text start="80.84" dur="4.15">mainstream realm of science as well is</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="4.71">that there&amp;#39;s plenty of research out</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="6.21">there showing that our literal thoughts</text>
  <text start="87.81" dur="6.599">have an effect on our reality on both</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="5.52">space and time you guys space and time</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="4.261">are actually one in the same we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="96.72" dur="3.719">going to get into that here but the</text>
  <text start="98.67" dur="5.04">point of the meeting is that our</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="5.07">thoughts affect space time and with the</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="5.1">Mandela effect what&amp;#39;s essentially going</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="6">on is that people are getting little</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="4.559">instances getting examples of the past</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="5.911">being able to be altered</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="6.631">okay so whether it be your the name of</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="5.339">some television show or the lines in a</text>
  <text start="120" dur="5.34">movie or whatever little detail that</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.37">people miss remember they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="4.5">necessarily miss remember they remember</text>
  <text start="127.129" dur="4.881">differently than what they thought had</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="3.429">been in the past okay and this</text>
  <text start="132.01" dur="2.91">this is what&amp;#39;s freaking people out</text>
  <text start="133.269" dur="3.991">because people like oh my gosh right if</text>
  <text start="134.92" dur="4.56">the past can change is is the present</text>
  <text start="137.26" dur="4.589">even real is the future gonna be real</text>
  <text start="139.48" dur="5.459">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really weirding</text>
  <text start="141.849" dur="5.31">people out but I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.939" dur="4.02">anything to be weirded out by and in</text>
  <text start="147.159" dur="5.791">fact I think it&amp;#39;s really freaking</text>
  <text start="148.959" dur="7.021">exciting because finding examples of the</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="6.209">Mandela effect in action is really</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="6.86">finding examples of the ability of human</text>
  <text start="159.159" dur="9">consciousness to affect our reality and</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="8.95">what&amp;#39;s going on is that in my opinion at</text>
  <text start="168.159" dur="6.031">least since our solar system is moving</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="4.8">into a new essentially a new area of the</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="4.949">cosmos so much higher energetic area of</text>
  <text start="176.59" dur="5.66">the cosmos the laws of physics are</text>
  <text start="179.139" dur="5.641">essentially changing a little bit and</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="4.329">we&amp;#39;re seeing the magnetic field of the</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="5.519">Sun weaken the magnetic field of the</text>
  <text start="186.579" dur="5.761">earth is weakening so because of the</text>
  <text start="190.299" dur="3.81">electromagnetic changes that are going</text>
  <text start="192.34" dur="4.049">on in our solar system that&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="194.109" dur="6.96">causing changes with our thought</text>
  <text start="196.389" dur="6.901">processes okay and this is why I think</text>
  <text start="201.069" dur="4.861">the instances of the Mandela effect are</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="4.65">increasing is because of this effect of</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="5.369">our solar system moving into a new</text>
  <text start="207.94" dur="6.889">region of the universe and I mean just</text>
  <text start="211.299" dur="8.931">think of for instance 2012 there are</text>
  <text start="214.829" dur="7.66">multiple different ancient cultures even</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="4.36">modern scientists and modern</text>
  <text start="222.489" dur="4.261">philosophers who all prophesized a lot</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="5.7">of changes occurring around 2012 whether</text>
  <text start="226.75" dur="5.459">it was Terence Mckenna in his time wave</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="3.87">zero theory whether you&amp;#39;re looking into</text>
  <text start="232.209" dur="3.691">the CIA and their Montauk Project how</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="3.509">they were trying to use human</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="4.739">consciousness to see into the future and</text>
  <text start="237.669" dur="4.47">once they got to any point past 2012</text>
  <text start="240.639" dur="4.35">they literally couldn&amp;#39;t they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="242.139" dur="4.651">remote view into the future or whether</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re talking about ancient Mayans or</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="5.25">other ancient prophecies discussing</text>
  <text start="249.699" dur="4.32">changes occurring around 2012 well one</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="5.039">of these changes that we are seeing</text>
  <text start="254.019" dur="4.53">occurring is the ability for our human</text>
  <text start="257.079" dur="5.881">consciousness to have a much greater</text>
  <text start="258.549" dur="6.151">impact on our reality and on space and</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="3.12">time and</text>
  <text start="264.7" dur="3.21">what&amp;#39;s essentially occurring is that</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="5.58">like I said people are seeing examples</text>
  <text start="267.91" dur="6.6">of it now but here&amp;#39;s the here&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="271.66" dur="6.05">interesting thing though is that these</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="6.42">changes are occurring in past timelines</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="6.67">with people not even having the intent</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="6.54">of doing so which is really friggin</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="3.9">interesting to me because people are I</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="2.58">mean we&amp;#39;re seeing these changes</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="4.86">occurring and people aren&amp;#39;t even having</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="6.71">the focused intent so imagine if we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="7.38">got a group of people together who</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="5.4">focused their thoughts on a specific</text>
  <text start="300.52" dur="4.26">change to occur that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="5.95">exponentially increase the likelihood of</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="6.45">this change happening and also increase</text>
  <text start="308.11" dur="5.67">the amount of impact that they have on</text>
  <text start="311.23" dur="4.74">said timelines so if we got a group of</text>
  <text start="313.78" dur="3.81">people together to I mean we&amp;#39;ll stay</text>
  <text start="315.97" dur="3.96">focused on the past on something</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="3.75">occurring or something changing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="7.68">gonna be so much more likely to occur</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="8.4">and also think of people then focusing</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="2.85">those intents and thoughts into the</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="3.36">future</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="5.82">well that&amp;#39;s literally going to gravitate</text>
  <text start="333.1" dur="6.33">that towards you to happen at a much</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="6.48">more likely rate so the Mandela effect</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="6.18">in my opinion is just a fancy name of</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="5.46">saying that your thoughts can influence</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="4.23">your reality that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="348.22" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing to be scared</text>
  <text start="349.84" dur="3.3">of and in fact there&amp;#39;s everything to be</text>
  <text start="351.46" dur="4.17">excited about because like I said</text>
  <text start="353.14" dur="5.88">because we&amp;#39;re all moving into literally</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="5.67">a new state of existence a new realm if</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="3.66">you will that&amp;#39;s giving our thoughts the</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="4.56">ability to have so much more of an</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="6.15">impact on our reality so then if we all</text>
  <text start="365.86" dur="6.21">come together and focus our thoughts on</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="5.87">something then imagine what can freaking</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="4.319">happen we can alter both space and time</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="4.689">literally</text>
  <text start="376.389" dur="4.53">so that&amp;#39;s really much it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.389" dur="3.511">those are my opinions on the Mendel</text>
  <text start="380.919" dur="4.47">effect honestly I haven&amp;#39;t spent too much</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="6.539">time researching into the Mandela effect</text>
  <text start="385.389" dur="5.851">because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of a cute it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.439" dur="4.741">kind of a buzzword to me Oh Mandela</text>
  <text start="391.24" dur="5.91">effect oh no no just look into human</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.37">consciousness just look into what space</text>
  <text start="397.15" dur="4.889">in time really are I just did a video</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="4.829">the other day on do we be Larsson and</text>
  <text start="402.039" dur="4.921">his theories on space and time how space</text>
  <text start="404.379" dur="4.35">and time are actually the same thing</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re simply reciprocals of each other</text>
  <text start="408.729" dur="5.24">there&amp;#39;s two two sides of the same coin</text>
  <text start="410.529" dur="5.371">and right now we are living in</text>
  <text start="413.969" dur="3.611">space-time where space is</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="5.28">three-dimensional and time has one</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="5.309">dimension time flows and when you flip</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="3.84">those around you can then get into the</text>
  <text start="422.889" dur="3.691">time-space realm where time have three</text>
  <text start="425.02" dur="3.6">dimensions and space has one dimension</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="4.559">what&amp;#39;s essentially occurring is that our</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="4.889">thoughts are having so much more of an</text>
  <text start="431.139" dur="4.471">energetic output in that time-space</text>
  <text start="433.509" dur="6.301">realm in that metaphysical realm that</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="6.149">we&amp;#39;re able to essentially affect any one</text>
  <text start="439.81" dur="3.81">of those dimensions of time so much more</text>
  <text start="441.759" dur="4.65">greater we can affect the past we can</text>
  <text start="443.62" dur="4.44">affect the present and we can thus put</text>
  <text start="446.409" dur="5.88">our intention forward to affect the</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="7.74">future so as we right as we continue</text>
  <text start="452.289" dur="5.011">along on this planet the effects of our</text>
  <text start="455.8" dur="4.589">consciousness our reality are going to</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="7.829">be so much more greater so remember that</text>
  <text start="460.389" dur="8.041">also gives you a responsibility to be</text>
  <text start="465.129" dur="5.31">very careful with your thoughts okay the</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="4.919">more negativity that you&amp;#39;re going to put</text>
  <text start="470.439" dur="6.09">out there the more that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="473.349" dur="5.91">attract negativity into your into your</text>
  <text start="476.529" dur="4.681">reality essentially so with this Mandela</text>
  <text start="479.259" dur="5.31">effect I mean really take it to heart</text>
  <text start="481.21" dur="5.699">take it to heart that you are the</text>
  <text start="484.569" dur="4.081">creator of your reality your thoughts</text>
  <text start="486.909" dur="4.62">literally affect the space and time</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="4.289">around you you can affect material you</text>
  <text start="491.529" dur="3.331">can affect matter with your thoughts and</text>
  <text start="492.939" dur="4.521">you can affect you at the metaphysical</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="6.239">realm or time with your thoughts okay</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="5.679">but also understand that if you have a</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="4.47">positive or negative intent intention as</text>
  <text start="503.139" dur="3.601">we progress right it&amp;#39;s just going to get</text>
  <text start="505.569" dur="4.261">more and more</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="5.34">are powerful you&amp;#39;re going to attract</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="6">more and more of however you think into</text>
  <text start="512.08" dur="6.269">your life so be careful if you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="515.83" dur="4.92">have negative thoughts and you&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="518.349" dur="3.75">a negative life I don&amp;#39;t feel bad for you</text>
  <text start="520.75" dur="4.23">because you&amp;#39;re literally inviting that</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="6.031">to occur if you&amp;#39;re going to think</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="6.09">positively great fantastic I like you</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="5.91">because we&amp;#39;re going to then be able to</text>
  <text start="531.07" dur="4.829">affect the future and bring us a more</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="4.47">optimal timeline or a much more positive</text>
  <text start="535.899" dur="4.711">timeline because you understand the</text>
  <text start="538.51" dur="4.139">effects of your consciousness on your</text>
  <text start="540.61" dur="4.59">reality and that&amp;#39;s the reality</text>
  <text start="542.649" dur="6.991">I want to choose I want the best reality</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="6.72">to occur so again Mandela effect it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="4.86">just a fancy word to say that your brain</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="6.62">affects your reality so be careful with</text>
  <text start="554.5" dur="4.04">your thoughts peace out guys</text>
