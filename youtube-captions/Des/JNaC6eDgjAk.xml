  <text start="12.96" dur="2.969">usual I have a bunch of news articles</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="2.64">here that I&amp;#39;ve found over the past</text>
  <text start="15.929" dur="3.571">couple days I&amp;#39;m gonna give you my two</text>
  <text start="17.55" dur="4.139">cents on them hopefully some helpful</text>
  <text start="19.5" dur="5.16">information and I&amp;#39;m gonna begin talking</text>
  <text start="21.689" dur="4.891">with or about MLK of course because</text>
  <text start="24.66" dur="5.22">yesterday was Martin Luther King jr. Day</text>
  <text start="26.58" dur="4.65">check out this article by NPR what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="4.53">amazing to me is that so many people</text>
  <text start="31.23" dur="6.21">think that NPR is the most unbiased and</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="5.16">stand up in name and journalism but they</text>
  <text start="37.44" dur="2.73">are anything but look at the deadline of</text>
  <text start="39.57" dur="3.89">this one</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="6.09">despite swirl of conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="43.46" dur="5.38">investigators say the ML case is closed</text>
  <text start="46.26" dur="5.04">they are really trying to debunk</text>
  <text start="48.84" dur="5.19">anything in regards to MLK in this one</text>
  <text start="51.3" dur="6.21">here they are talking about conspiracy</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="5.07">theories flourishing about well maybe it</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="3.209">wasn&amp;#39;t James or already that shot him</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="4.919">maybe there was multiple shooters maybe</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="4.62">there was some actual conspiracy in his</text>
  <text start="64.019" dur="3.871">death we&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a minute</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="7.231">here but NPR just goes into this long</text>
  <text start="67.89" dur="6.69">list of all these reasons why we should</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.68">believe the mainstream narrative about</text>
  <text start="74.58" dur="4.71">this but check it out the one thing they</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="6.84">did not mention in this article</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="8.31">speaking of conspiracy is the 1999 civil</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="6.36">trial in Tennessee that literally the</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="5.699">whole jury 12 jurors they all reached a</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="6.72">unanimous verdict and right here the</text>
  <text start="93.299" dur="5.491">testimony of over 70 witnesses they had</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="3.36">in the civil trial they actually</text>
  <text start="98.79" dur="4.95">concluded it was literally a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="5.01">by the very definition right so</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="5.519">conspiracy theory here is becoming</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="6.06">conspiracy fact like so many of these</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="2.851">concepts and topics are but look at it</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="3.21">right here</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="5.57">Martin Luther King Jr&amp;#39;s own wife mrs.</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="7.08">Coretta Scott King welcomed the verdict</text>
  <text start="117.68" dur="6.789">so this is not just some fantasy made-up</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="5.7">idea yes there was literally conspiracy</text>
  <text start="124.469" dur="5.551">in MLK&amp;#39;s death and this is why you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="4.289">trust the media folks and speaking of</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="2.6">not trusting the media people are surely</text>

  <text start="972.22" dur="3.63">and this article is saying that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="974.14" dur="5.37">broken in here and that we have to</text>

  <text start="979.51" dur="4.53">likely et life is and then very last</text>
  <text start="982.75" dur="3.18">thing I want to share with you guys here</text>
  <text start="984.04" dur="4.65">this was pretty funny check it out</text>
  <text start="985.93" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s from Gizmodo but it&amp;#39;s about in</text>
  <text start="988.69" dur="4.85">Canada they&amp;#39;re actually creating a new</text>
  <text start="990.82" dur="6.18">coin it&amp;#39;s a $20 coin and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="993.54" dur="5.53">commemorating a very popular UFO</text>
  <text start="997" dur="4.08">sighting from Canada it&amp;#39;s a 1967</text>
  <text start="999.07" dur="4.68">sighting where apparently a dude saw</text>
  <text start="1001.08" dur="5.4">this huge flying saucer over this Lake</text>
  <text start="1003.75" dur="5.88">in Manitoba and just speaking of</text>

  <text start="1009.63" dur="4.35">preparing our consciousness that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1012.51" dur="3.33">neat that&amp;#39;s just pretty cool</text>
  <text start="1013.98" dur="4.86">and quick note on that just my thought</text>
  <text start="1015.84" dur="5.49">it was in 1967 and it was a flying</text>
  <text start="1018.84" dur="4.05">saucer so I just want to make it known</text>
  <text start="1021.33" dur="2.55">that it could have been one of theirs</text>
  <text start="1022.89" dur="3.12">could have been a non terrestrial</text>
  <text start="1023.88" dur="4.49">sighting absolutely but it could have</text>
  <text start="1026.01" dur="6.15">very well been one of our own because by</text>
  <text start="1028.37" dur="6.339">1967 of course Nazi breakaways secret</text>
  <text start="1032.16" dur="5.6">societies were already developing flying</text>
  <text start="1034.709" dur="5.911">saucer technology and there were various</text>
  <text start="1037.76" dur="6.55">groups or programs in the United States</text>
  <text start="1040.62" dur="5.49">as well that we&amp;#39;re working on actual</text>
  <text start="1044.31" dur="4.47">disks flying saucer disks so they</text>
  <text start="1046.11" dur="5.55">definitely had that technology by 1967</text>
  <text start="1048.78" dur="6.3">so this could have been a saucer out of</text>
  <text start="1051.66" dur="5.7">Antarctica could have been a Nazi saucer</text>
  <text start="1055.08" dur="4.5">could have been an American saucer I</text>
  <text start="1057.36" dur="4.65">mean maybe Canada some groups in Canada</text>
  <text start="1059.58" dur="5.4">were delving into that technology had</text>
  <text start="1062.01" dur="3.769">access to it I&amp;#39;m not sure by then but</text>
  <text start="1064.98" dur="3.739">yeah it could have been</text>
