  <text start="15.92" dur="8.38">that&amp;#39;s the Pentagon and today being</text>
  <text start="20.48" dur="6.45">September 10th 2019 what happened 18</text>
  <text start="24.3" dur="6.479">years ago to the day</text>
  <text start="26.93" dur="7.18">what happened Donald Rumsfeld then</text>
  <text start="30.779" dur="7.321">Secretary of Defense admitted in front</text>
  <text start="34.11" dur="7.05">of Congress that 2.3 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="38.1" dur="6.66">that&amp;#39;s trillion with a T was unaccounted</text>

  <text start="51.48" dur="7.11">after today 18 years ago you remember it</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="3">might not remember but I think you</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="1.98">remember they tell us to never forget</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="4.98">right</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="8.88">never forget that 18 years ago to</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="7.4">tomorrow that somehow two airplanes took</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="6.38">down three buildings in New York City a</text>
  <text start="72.32" dur="6.01">well they tell us an airplane hit the</text>
  <text start="75.83" dur="4.69">Pentagon right there but in my opinion</text>
  <text start="78.33" dur="4.289">it was probably a UAV and unmanned</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="5.91">aerial vehicle look like a drone hit it</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="8.131">and then of course the aircraft that</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="6.57">went down over Pennsylvania 18 years ago</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="4.02">to the day Donald Rumsfeld 2.3 trillion</text>
  <text start="93" dur="4.35">dollars missing what a way to get</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="5.489">everybody to forget about that and turn</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="8">their attention elsewhere on September</text>
  <text start="100.259" dur="9.57">11 2001 18 years ago tomorrow to the day</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="6.339">so pretty incredible stuff that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="3.601">the Pentagon right there Potomac River</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="4.771">behind me Marine one just went overhead</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="5.88">and I needed to just go live and talk</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="8.909">about these missing trillions trillions</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="8.01">with a teeth okay so the story of the</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="5.67">missing money from the Pentagon begins</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.8">really not just 18 years ago but it</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="4.081">begins</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="5.19">I mean like 50 years ago 4050 years ago</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="4.92">truly if you look back in the 1980s in</text>
  <text start="137.31" dur="4.89">to a man named Franklin Spinney Franklin</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="5.43">spitty wrote what&amp;#39;s called the spitty</text>
  <text start="142.2" dur="4.86">report he was a I believe a budget</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="3.72">analyst in the Pentagon right there and</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="3.539">he was going through the budgets one day</text>
  <text start="149.19" dur="4.98">and he found all sorts of</text>
  <text start="150.599" dur="6.511">inconsistencies okay now it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="4.62">Pentagon waste and in the 1980s this</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="3.45">report circulated around it ended up</text>
  <text start="158.79" dur="5.85">getting out to the press and publicized</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="5.37">and they figured probably billions of</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="4.679">dollars of waste this was back in the</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="6.48">1980s you guys so fast-forward a few</text>
  <text start="169.319" dur="5.221">decades that leads us to September 10th</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="4.71">2001 like I said when Donald Rumsfeld</text>
  <text start="174.54" dur="5.43">I admitted admitted that 2.3 trillion</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="5.13">dollars was unaccounted for in the DoD&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="5.04">budgets next day 9/11 happens everybody</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="9.03">forgets about that fast forward about Oh</text>

  <text start="196.23" dur="3.69">miss adjustments or the money that was</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="5.879">unaccounted for you know however they</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="7.14">described it that money went up to six</text>
  <text start="204.329" dur="5.011">point five trillion six point five</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="4.679">trillion dollars missing from that</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="4.679">budget right there okay now some</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="5.071">estimates these days say that it could</text>
  <text start="214.019" dur="6.511">be upwards of 10 if not even closer to</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="5.549">20 trillion dollars trillion guys and</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="3.51">this is just from the Pentagon&amp;#39;s budget</text>

  <text start="308.58" dur="6.78">below we&amp;#39;re talking about those secret</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="5.521">space programs those secret spacecraft</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re building all the amazingly</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="3.44">advanced technologies that they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="318.78" dur="4.47">in those black budgets for decades</text>
  <text start="320.69" dur="4.99">zero-point antigravity of course what is</text>
  <text start="323.25" dur="5.37">the CIA doing in their black program you</text>
  <text start="325.68" dur="5.13">know the mind control the all sorts of</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="4.26">different genetics research and whatnot</text>
  <text start="330.81" dur="5.1">I mean we can go down the list of what</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re probably doing with it secret</text>
  <text start="335.91" dur="4.95">facilities on earth underground deep</text>
  <text start="338.85" dur="3.48">underground military bases maybe some</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="3.869">secret facilities on the back side of</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="4.86">the moon who knows I wouldn&amp;#39;t put it</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="4.321">past any realm of possibility that those</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="3.72">secret bases could even be on Mars or</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="3.6">other planets you know when you have</text>
  <text start="350.91" dur="3.27">these zero-point anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="4.47">technologies that can get you here to</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="5.7">Mars in five minutes and if Lockheed</text>
  <text start="357.12" dur="5.69">built a black triangle back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="9.289">to do it well why wouldn&amp;#39;t they do it</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="8.129">another helicopter right over here so</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="6.99">hold on I want to see which one this is</text>

  <text start="377.9" dur="5.25">budget right there and funny enough as</text>
  <text start="381.259" dur="4.47">well it&amp;#39;s never ever been audited</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="9.75">believe it or not the Pentagon has never</text>
  <text start="385.729" dur="9.341">been audited asterisk before 2018 into</text>
  <text start="392.9" dur="4.78">da</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="4.68">mmm-hmm in 18 we had the very first</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="3.87">audit ever of the Pentagon right there</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="2.91">and of course we had to get Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="2.67">in there as the presidency and some</text>
  <text start="402.66" dur="3.6">Patriots in control before that happened</text>

  <text start="421.05" dur="8.76">be well number one we got to get them to</text>
  <text start="427.29" dur="4.32">believe it in the first place and the</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="3.09">public is not likely to believe that</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="3.69">that much money is missing from the</text>
