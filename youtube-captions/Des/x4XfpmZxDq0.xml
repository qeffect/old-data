  <text start="19.68" dur="4.47">and I did a video this morning going</text>
  <text start="21.9" dur="5.129">through Q&amp;#39;s recent posts if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="24.15" dur="5.219">seen it make a card pop-up but in this</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.801">video I want to discuss something in</text>
  <text start="29.369" dur="4.141">regards to Q something new that I came</text>
  <text start="31.83" dur="4.409">across yesterday and it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="33.51" dur="5.94">Blin blowing my mind I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="5.82">enthralled with it for the past day so</text>
  <text start="39.45" dur="5.519">I&amp;#39;m just gonna go ahead and show you the</text>
  <text start="42.059" dur="5.191">blog that was sent to me and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="4.381">read through it and you&amp;#39;ll guys will get</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="4.14">the understanding the background of what</text>
  <text start="49.35" dur="6.599">I&amp;#39;m talking about here so let&amp;#39;s go ahead</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="10.25">and fade to it it says every trip code</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="8.67">and user ID used by Q points to a book</text>
  <text start="61.64" dur="6.519">so let&amp;#39;s go down into the article for a</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="7.011">little more Q has used eleven trip codes</text>
  <text start="68.159" dur="6.811">and eleven hundred different user IDs</text>
  <text start="71.63" dur="6.099">every one of them points to a book when</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="4.23">you search them in Google Books some of</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="3.241">them are even pointing to specific pages</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="5.4">within that book and here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="80.97" dur="7.759">there&amp;#39;s been 1111 interesting number</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="9.08">there 1111 complete books of information</text>
  <text start="88.729" dur="7.481">so what&amp;#39;s this saying basically since Q</text>
  <text start="93.68" dur="4.479">first began posting at the very end of</text>
  <text start="96.21" dur="6.869">November last year for the last nine</text>
  <text start="98.159" dur="6.481">months on both 4chan and HN they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="4.021">using a variety of trip codes and user</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="6.15">IDs and every single one of them points</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="6.089">to a particular book now this is crazy</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="4.5">this is next level decoding whoever</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="4.051">figured this one out you must have got</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="4.74">some download or you have a magic brain</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="6.21">let me tell you because this is</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="5.31">fantastic and Q keeps telling us keep</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="5.19">saying that we have more than we know</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="6.539">right they&amp;#39;ve said that many different</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="5.25">times now we&amp;#39;ve already had a shitload</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="4.891">of information given to us by Q</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="5.58">of confirmations and suggestions and</text>
  <text start="136.77" dur="3.9">questions and pointers or directives you</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="3.45">know so we&amp;#39;ve had a ton of information</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="3.87">but you keep saying you have more than</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="6.12">you know you have more than you know</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="7.8">so now with this decoded if you will</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="6.99">this opens up a treasure trove of</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="6.33">information for people to start digging</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="6.72">into but I want to say one thing here</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="7.819">really quick this has not been confirmed</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="7.709">by Q okay we don&amp;#39;t know if this is a</text>
  <text start="166.489" dur="7.541">legitimate thing but here&amp;#39;s a note on</text>
  <text start="170.459" dur="6.691">that right so with an intelligence</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="9.57">dissemination operation as sophisticated</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="8.79">as these q drops are right I I mean</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="6.84">you&amp;#39;ve got to think every single little</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="8.519">thing they do is planned and planned</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="7.639">through and through to a tee so is this</text>
  <text start="194.459" dur="6.571">really out of the question</text>
  <text start="198.079" dur="5.681">no Coy&amp;#39;s coincidences as we&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="5.01">told you know I don&amp;#39;t think something</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="4.199">like this would not be purposeful that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="4.759">what I&amp;#39;m saying I you know again it</text>
  <text start="207.959" dur="6.241">hasn&amp;#39;t been confirmed but what a</text>
  <text start="210.799" dur="6.041">beautiful way again as if the cue drops</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="5.16">aren&amp;#39;t magical enough but what a</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="5.239">beautiful way to slide in a bunch of</text>
  <text start="219.36" dur="4.74">information the cue can&amp;#39;t directly say</text>
  <text start="222.079" dur="4.211">because we&amp;#39;re gonna go through these</text>
  <text start="224.1" dur="4.62">books right now or at least the books</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="6.21">that have been found and you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="6.48">these books go far beyond even what Q</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="5.22">has said you said a lot don&amp;#39;t get me</text>
  <text start="235.2" dur="4.89">wrong and a lot of people have learned a</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="5.31">lot of stuff from Q myself even and I</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="4.53">fancied myself as being a very heavily</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="3.42">read pilled before work you came along</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="6.179">and even I&amp;#39;ve learned some stuff from Q</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="9.09">but these books go way beyond that so</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="8.401">again what a beautiful subtle sly way to</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="5.55">get out even more information that Q</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="3.089">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to say and they</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="3.84">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to say it because of</text>
  <text start="262.289" dur="5.341">course I mean there&amp;#39;s a lot of Q</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="4.32">followers that you know the eye</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="4.02">idea of waking up or getting red pill</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s not a one-and-done deal it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="271.65" dur="5.25">continuous process and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="6.99">people following queue some pieces of</text>
  <text start="276.9" dur="5.1">information still might give them</text>
  <text start="280.23" dur="3.62">cognitive dissonance or make them</text>
  <text start="282" dur="4.5">disbelieve or something that effect so</text>
  <text start="283.85" dur="5.26">you got to understand that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="4.68">just go and say everything still even in</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.68">the woke circles it&amp;#39;s got to be slow</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s got to be strategic tactical so</text>
  <text start="293.79" dur="4.83">let&amp;#39;s go ahead and go through some of</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="6.53">these books here and really paint the</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="6.54">picture of how deep expansive this</text>
  <text start="302" dur="4.87">information that we found is so let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="5.55">ahead and go through again this first</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="6.48">blog here ruah comm that I mentioned the</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="5.58">first one from this particular trip code</text>
  <text start="313.35" dur="6.66">by cue points to ramza we ramped the</text>
  <text start="316.29" dur="5.46">books now with the audience following my</text>
  <text start="320.01" dur="3.99">channel I would venture to guess that</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="6.13">many of you are not familiar with Ramtha</text>
  <text start="324" dur="5">what it is but basically Ramtha is a</text>
  <text start="327.88" dur="4.49">[Music]</text>
  <text start="329" dur="6.76">alleged to be a channeled entity and</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s channeled by jay-z Knight out of</text>
  <text start="335.76" dur="3.27">yelm Washington there&amp;#39;s a school of</text>
  <text start="337.74" dur="5.82">enlightenment down there</text>
  <text start="339.03" dur="7.41">so for Ramtha to be in here talking</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="6.39">about prophecies and ramped up being a</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="8.19">channeled entity like holy crap this is</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="7.65">why I was so surprised and mind blown by</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="5.22">this this information being decoded and</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="3.84">found so we have ramped the books in</text>
  <text start="359.85" dur="3.72">there and crazy enough synchronicity</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="3.96">synchronistically @la enough at least</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="4.65">for myself I was literally in Yelm last</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="5.82">weekend I drove right by the ramp to</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="6.63">school there and then to find this you</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="5.58">know on on this list shocked me let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.85" dur="5.01">see what some other books are behold a</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="5.31">pale horse by William Cooper we know Q</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="5.57">has referenced William Cooper behold a</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="7.62">pale horse in drops before but we get</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="6.46">another directive to this book it was</text>
  <text start="389.73" dur="3.9">used with this particular trip code you</text>
  <text start="391.89" dur="3.72">used that trip code like six hundred</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="4.26">times before they had to change it again</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="4.77">and that was all those references to</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="3.749">behold a pale horse right we got a</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="5.069">couple Devin Nunez</text>
  <text start="401.639" dur="7.411">books in there funny enough but of</text>
  <text start="405.449" dur="7.56">course Nunez has been doing the great</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="6.63">work in Congress there definitely a part</text>
  <text start="413.009" dur="4.291">of the white hat collective the Alliance</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="3.72">collective trying to rid the deep state</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="4.079">so makes sense a couple Nunez books</text>
  <text start="419.4" dur="4.859">would be featured in there we have a</text>
  <text start="421.379" dur="5.85">Joseph P Ferrell book another one of</text>

  <text start="434.639" dur="4.02">course Q has outed the Nazis through and</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="4.53">through over the months but Joseph P</text>
  <text start="438.659" dur="5.31">Ferrell goes even deeper than Q has and</text>
  <text start="441.18" dur="4.829">talks about the secret societies the</text>
  <text start="443.969" dur="4.581">order of the Black Sun the Thule Society</text>

  <text start="667.65" dur="3.54">of shares that I feel required</text>
  <text start="669.03" dur="4.14">soft landing I like how they put that</text>
  <text start="671.19" dur="5.31">soft landing so this is something that</text>
  <text start="673.17" dur="5.55">was waiting waiting in the woodwork for</text>
  <text start="676.5" dur="4.11">somebody to figure out and then here it</text>
  <text start="678.72" dur="3.57">comes out and again if you want to</text>
  <text start="680.61" dur="3.87">choose to believe choose to research</text>
  <text start="682.29" dur="4.11">choose to find the evidence it&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="684.48" dur="4.41">there for you the reason I say that is</text>
  <text start="686.4" dur="4.68">because a lot of people have been asking</text>
  <text start="688.89" dur="3.48">me lately well what&amp;#39;s where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="691.08" dur="2.73">evidence for the secret space program</text>
  <text start="692.37" dur="3.33">where&amp;#39;s the evidence for UFOs and all</text>
  <text start="693.81" dur="5.28">this stuff and trust me it&amp;#39;s there I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="695.7" dur="7.32">been researching it heavily deeply for</text>
  <text start="699.09" dur="6.93">years now so I am I wouldn&amp;#39;t call myself</text>
  <text start="703.02" dur="5.94">an expert but I have an expertise in</text>
  <text start="706.02" dur="5.36">that field and just because Hugh hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="708.96" dur="5.04">mentioned the secret space program or</text>
  <text start="711.38" dur="4.75">things in regards to UFOs or those</text>
  <text start="714" dur="4.29">secret Sciences yet a lot of people</text>
  <text start="716.13" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t believe it right</text>
  <text start="718.29" dur="4.08">some people are unfortunately looking to</text>
  <text start="720.39" dur="4.08">q is like an idol Savior figure thinking</text>
  <text start="722.37" dur="5.4">that they know everything or have told</text>
  <text start="724.47" dur="4.23">us everything but you gotta understand</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="3">there&amp;#39;s plenty of evidence out there</text>
  <text start="728.7" dur="5.28">even for things that Hugh hasn&amp;#39;t touched</text>
  <text start="730.77" dur="4.65">on quite yet but it&amp;#39;s great that now</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="3.45">that evidence is coming out and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="735.42" dur="5.01">coming out from a quote authority that</text>
  <text start="737.43" dur="5.43">everybody looks up to in cue so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="740.43" dur="4.53">gonna see their consciousness and allow</text>
  <text start="742.86" dur="4.83">those thoughts to germinate much better</text>
  <text start="744.96" dur="4.35">here so we&amp;#39;re good</text>

  <text start="830.55" dur="5.43">universe theories and the deeper</text>
  <text start="834.03" dur="3.96">esoteric hidden science is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="835.98" dur="5.58">not told of course all the science that</text>
  <text start="837.99" dur="6.78">comes from MIT and you know universities</text>
  <text start="841.56" dur="6.45">these days it&amp;#39;s all lies 99% of it is</text>
  <text start="844.77" dur="6.66">just made-up made-up theory that has no</text>

  <text start="935.86" dur="5.7">and this is why this point in human</text>
  <text start="938.529" dur="4.62">history is the greatest because we all</text>
  <text start="941.56" dur="3.39">have to unlearn what we&amp;#39;ve been taught</text>
  <text start="943.149" dur="3.331">truly that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s probably the</text>
  <text start="944.95" dur="4.17">hardest part here is unlearning the</text>
  <text start="946.48" dur="4.919">programming getting that out of your</text>
  <text start="949.12" dur="4.95">head and we have such an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="951.399" dur="5.521">build new paradigms of learning new</text>
  <text start="954.07" dur="4.92">paradigms of programming you know</text>
  <text start="956.92" dur="5.13">programming ourselves with the truth and</text>
  <text start="958.99" dur="4.32">we really have to throw away everything</text>
  <text start="962.05" dur="6.45">throw away it all</text>
  <text start="963.31" dur="6.33">and build back what we think we know so</text>
