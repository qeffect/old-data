  <text start="13.639" dur="4.771">tell you about an interesting story that</text>
  <text start="15.379" dur="4.651">happened to me just last night so my</text>
  <text start="18.41" dur="3.84">lady friend and I right we were out</text>
  <text start="20.03" dur="5.01">shopping and we decided to make a quick</text>
  <text start="22.25" dur="4.53">stop into Barnes Noble to look around</text>
  <text start="25.04" dur="5.01">the bookstore so we go into Barnes &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="26.78" dur="4.68">Noble look around the bookstore and they</text>
  <text start="30.05" dur="3.06">announced over the intercom that the</text>
  <text start="31.46" dur="3.39">place is closing in a few minutes so we</text>
  <text start="33.11" dur="4.41">go okay you know why don&amp;#39;t we leave and</text>
  <text start="34.85" dur="4.53">as we&amp;#39;re walking out the door I spot the</text>
  <text start="37.52" dur="3.66">magazine rack and since we had a few</text>
  <text start="39.38" dur="3.3">minutes before they closed I say let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="41.18" dur="2.43">go make fun of all the magazines right</text>
  <text start="42.68" dur="2.85">because that&amp;#39;s one of my favorite</text>
  <text start="43.61" dur="4.08">pastime see what kind of BS they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="45.53" dur="5.15">spewing and pops I or Popular Mechanics</text>
  <text start="47.69" dur="7.709">so we walk over to the magazine rack and</text>
  <text start="50.68" dur="6.969">I spot a very specific magazine that I</text>
  <text start="55.399" dur="4.59">wanted to share with you guys and it was</text>
  <text start="57.649" dur="4.291">called skeptic here&amp;#39;s a picture of it</text>
  <text start="59.989" dur="4.291">right here and you can see on the cover</text>
  <text start="61.94" dur="4.59">it says artificial intelligence the rise</text>
  <text start="64.28" dur="4.769">of the alt-right area 51</text>
  <text start="66.53" dur="6.39">chemtrails right just look at this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.049" dur="5.67">literally a magazine called skeptic so I</text>
  <text start="72.92" dur="3.449">flip it open I start going through the</text>
  <text start="74.719" dur="4.32">pages I check out what they had to say</text>
  <text start="76.369" dur="4.71">about area 51 right cuz automatically I</text>
  <text start="79.039" dur="4.561">I knew this magazine was gonna be a</text>
  <text start="81.079" dur="5.521">bunch of so I see what they</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="4.71">have to say about area 51 and of course</text>
  <text start="86.6" dur="4.17">they were saying it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of</text>
  <text start="88.31" dur="3.78">speculation there&amp;#39;s nothing to it you</text>
  <text start="90.77" dur="3.36">know there might have been a few</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="4.559">classified projects at this installation</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="5.04">but nothing more than that right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.649" dur="4.411">quick blurb on that huh so I chuckle it</text>
  <text start="99.17" dur="3.449">off and I I keep searching through the</text>
  <text start="101.06" dur="3.059">magazine and then I get to chemtrails</text>
  <text start="102.619" dur="4.29">and I see what they had to say about</text>
  <text start="104.119" dur="5.31">chemtrails and of course right there</text>
  <text start="106.909" dur="7.111">saying that it&amp;#39;s just persistent</text>
  <text start="109.429" dur="7.411">contrails and the EPA has debunked this</text>
  <text start="114.02" dur="8.009">crazy wild conspiracy theory of</text>
  <text start="116.84" dur="6.689">chemtrails even though there is a big</text>
  <text start="122.029" dur="5.52">difference between chemtrails and</text>
  <text start="123.529" dur="7.171">geoengineering right and I&amp;#39;ll quote Dane</text>
  <text start="127.549" dur="5.691">Wigington here who I got this idea from</text>
  <text start="130.7" dur="4.91">but there&amp;#39;s a very specific reason</text>
  <text start="133.24" dur="4.71">the media and the powers-that-be call it</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="4.29">chemtrails as opposed to geoengineering</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="4.29">because geoengineering is the scientific</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="4.8">term so they can say chemtrails are fake</text>
  <text start="142.24" dur="5.04">and they&amp;#39;re telling the truth but if</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="3.6">they say geoengineering is fake well</text>
  <text start="147.28" dur="1.92">then they wouldn&amp;#39;t be telling the truth</text>
  <text start="148.3" dur="3.9">do you see</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="6">so with that easy nomenclature mix-up</text>
  <text start="152.2" dur="5.52">there they can spread a bunch of</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="5.07">misinformation and not technically be</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="4.53">lying to us so I just want to throw that</text>
  <text start="160.27" dur="6.12">out there real quick but my point being</text>
  <text start="162.25" dur="7.89">here is that this magazine called</text>
  <text start="166.39" dur="6.93">skeptic which was not skeptical at all</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="6.39">right true natural healthy skepticism is</text>
  <text start="173.32" dur="5.61">not being too closed-minded but not</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="4.17">being too open-minded right you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="178.93" dur="3.72">in the middle your minds like a</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="3.09">parachute only works if it&amp;#39;s open but</text>
  <text start="182.65" dur="3.42">you don&amp;#39;t want it to be so open that</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="6.9">your brain falls out so that&amp;#39;s a healthy</text>
  <text start="186.07" dur="6.3">skepticism or a healthy healthy balance</text>
  <text start="190.69" dur="3.78">between closed and open mindedness right</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="3.9">this kind of skepticism is rigid</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="5.76">skepticism it&amp;#39;s the kind of skepticism</text>
  <text start="196.27" dur="5.94">where you you&amp;#39;re so ensconced in your</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="6.06">belief systems that you can&amp;#39;t accept any</text>
  <text start="202.21" dur="6.18">new or true facts or informations into</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="5.58">those belief systems so this magazine</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="6.12">here which you know is blatant</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="5.07">propaganda is front and center at Barnes</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="6.08">&amp;amp; Noble what does that mean that means</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="6.69">the powers that be are so desperate to</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="6.43">quell this conscious awakening going on</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="5.64">that they are calling a magazine skeptic</text>
  <text start="227.02" dur="3.39">and you know as a sub-headline of the</text>
  <text start="229.27" dur="3.93">magazine it literally says like</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="4.35">promoting science it&amp;#39;s awful and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="4.86">placing this front and center at Barnes</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="6.12">&amp;amp; Noble okay I want to tell you how</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="5.01">excited I actually got seeing this</text>
  <text start="240.88" dur="4.02">because that means they are getting</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="5.4">backed into such a corner that they have</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="6.84">to resort to magazines called skeptic</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="5.73">right how awesome is that how fantastic</text>
  <text start="251.74" dur="5.309">is it to be living at this moment in</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="5.01">time where we are saying this conscious</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="5.191">awakening occur to a point where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.21" dur="4.89">literally burning down the old systems</text>
  <text start="262.24" dur="2.58">and we&amp;#39;re seeing it right before our</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="2.22">eyes</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="2.28">so I just wanted to share this with you</text>

  <text start="267.1" dur="3.69">a lot of people out there who are</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="4.29">getting very negative they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="3.48">that there&amp;#39;s no awakening occurring</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s think they&amp;#39;re thinking that you</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="5.79">know humanity has no chance that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.67" dur="5.91">all basically doomed to fail per se and</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="3.96">our earth is just gonna burn into</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="3.9">oblivion or something that effect but I</text>
