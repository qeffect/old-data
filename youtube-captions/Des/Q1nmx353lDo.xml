  <text start="99.81" dur="5.309">below but now let&amp;#39;s talk about the news</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="4.75">obviously the first order of business is</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="5.551">getting everybody&amp;#39;s panties in a bunch</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="5.67">is who is gonna be arrested tomorrow so</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.37">of course as most of you know the</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="4.521">special counsel of this Rusted</text>
  <text start="115.04" dur="4.42">investigation headed by Robert Mueller</text>
  <text start="117.17" dur="5.589">announced that somebody is going to be</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="5.369">arrested likely tomorrow and we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.441">many theories circulating around the</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.891">interwebs on exactly who it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="6.18">of course we&amp;#39;ve heard theories about</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="5.61">Podesta primarily Tony Podesta but</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="3.06">be pretty cool too if John Podesta got</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="2.61">arrested I mean they&amp;#39;re both pretty</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="4.35">weird and probably need to be behind</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="6.03">bars but could be Tony Podesta could be</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="7.35">Paul manna fort that&amp;#39;s another one I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="6.83">heard the Republican who had previously</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="5.04">advised Donald Trump&amp;#39;s administration</text>
  <text start="150.8" dur="5.05"> what if it&amp;#39;s Hillary Clinton right</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.68">that would be pretty neat it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.85" dur="3.84">really matter who it is though there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.86" dur="4.92">going to be some chaos that ensues from</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="6.65">it and you know change always begets</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="5.85">chaos so regardless of what occurs</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="5.8">progress is happening but what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="4.95">interesting on the note of the special</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="3.39">investigation announcing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="3.93">gonna arrest somebody just this morning</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="4.59">I was watching an interview of trey</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="4.59">Gowdy on Fox &amp;amp; Friends that trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="6.72">is the head of the House Oversight</text>
  <text start="182.1" dur="7.95">Committee and he actually said that the</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="5.49">leak of this investigation saying that</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re going to arrest somebody broke</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="4.32">the law and that that was an interesting</text>
  <text start="194.28" dur="4.11">thing to me so Robert Mueller here and</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="3.15">his team actually broke the law by</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="4.17">announcing they were going to indict</text>
  <text start="199.8" dur="4.32">somebody so again it&amp;#39;s a giant show</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="3.09">we don&amp;#39;t necessarily know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="3.96">to happen but it&amp;#39;s gonna be an</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="4.53">interesting week in seeing what occurs</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="4.71">and now next let&amp;#39;s talk a little bit</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="4.68">about those JFK files and it&amp;#39;s been kind</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="3.72">of like a back-and-forth like is Donald</text>
  <text start="214.86" dur="3.54">Trump gonna release them is he not gonna</text>
  <text start="216.51" dur="4.14">release them of course how much</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="4.98">redaction is there gonna be in these</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="4.74">files you know full disclosure means</text>
  <text start="223.38" dur="4.25">there&amp;#39;s no redaction you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="5.37">necessarily have full disclosure without</text>
  <text start="227.63" dur="5.07">disclosing at all you know so we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;ll see what comes of it but</text>
  <text start="232.7" dur="5.11">regardless this this is going to open</text>
  <text start="235.98" dur="3.84">people&amp;#39;s minds no matter how much gets</text>
  <text start="237.81" dur="3.87">out there this is going to start making</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="4.38">people question and that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;ve been noticing the past few days is</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="4.53">that even the people who are still</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="3.75">caught up in the conventional way of</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="3.69">thinking by mainstream media by our</text>
  <text start="250.59" dur="4.14">educational system and all that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="5.91">curious they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re beginning to</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="5.58">realize that things aren&amp;#39;t all that they</text>
  <text start="258.33" dur="4.01">seem and they&amp;#39;re beginning to flirt with</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="5.43">change they&amp;#39;re beginning to flirt with</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="4.57">you know the whole awakening process and</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="2.28">begin to actually try</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="3.87">see things from different perspectives</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="4.23">this is only gonna help that and it was</text>
  <text start="270.78" dur="3.24">really interesting to me that Donald</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="3.8">Trump said that he&amp;#39;s releasing them and</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="5.1">in his tweet he mentioned to put</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="5.86">conspiracy theories to rest and it&amp;#39;s as</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="5.25">if he&amp;#39;s saying well he knows right</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="5.22">I mean the CIA took Clint took JFK out</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.26">and the Bush family and whatnot very</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="3.99">funny of the Bush family doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="3.96">like Donald Trump but by saying that</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="4.49">he&amp;#39;s putting the conspiracy theories to</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="5.61">rest that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="3.85">the mainstream narrative is what&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="2.94">and it&amp;#39;s gonna put all the conspiracy</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="3.33">theories to rest could very well mean</text>
  <text start="301.14" dur="2.52">it&amp;#39;s gonna validate the conspiracy</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="3.93">theories and we&amp;#39;re not gonna have to</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="4.92">question them anymore so that you know</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s always double entendres and</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="5.25">doublespeak behind the things that he</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="6.45">says then this happened just today Roger</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="4.41">stone got banned on Twitter if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="3.75">follow Roger stone on Twitter you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="318.24" dur="5.22">right now cuz he&amp;#39;s banned but go do it</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="5.67">once he gets unbanned because he he post</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="4.98">some good stuff man he posts about you</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="5.04">know John Podesta being a pedophile is</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="5.82">just like last week and he really goes</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="5.25">no-holds-barred on Twitter so also you</text>
  <text start="334.26" dur="4.83">know seeing a previous Trump</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="4.53">administration adviser saying that</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="3.72">things that Roger stone does on Twitter</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="4.56">well then you really got to kind of</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="4.32">question as to what the people say in</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="3.42">this administration actually know right</text>
  <text start="347.13" dur="3.18">a lot of people say oh controlled</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="4.86">opposition and all this but it&amp;#39;s not so</text>
  <text start="350.31" dur="8.31">black and white and it&amp;#39;s a very it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="353.73" dur="8.04">very tough game to try and discern so</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="5.7">but that&amp;#39;s a piece and then also Donald</text>
  <text start="361.77" dur="3.84">Trump&amp;#39;s jr. you know his Twitter account</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="3">has really been kind of raising my</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="3.57">eyebrow lately as well because he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="367.32" dur="6.66">posting a lot of articles here from Zero</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="6.93">Hedge so Zero Hedge com being the you</text>
  <text start="373.98" dur="3.689">know an awesome alternative website that</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="5.309">I&amp;#39;ve been going to for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="5.701">they post quite a bit of truth like you</text>
  <text start="381.419" dur="4.891">could say conspiracy theory stuff but</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="6">we&amp;#39;ll just say nah unspoken truths</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.89">hidden truths or whatnot Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="4.049">jr. has been posting a lot of stuff from</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="5.19">Zero Hedge so again like what do these</text>
  <text start="393.419" dur="5.221">people know all you can guess as to what</text>
  <text start="396.39" dur="4.77">they know is what they&amp;#39;re posting and</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="5.01">saying and there&amp;#39;s so many layers</text>
  <text start="401.16" dur="5.4">that you have to kind of discern down</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="4.64">into but that was you know big piece of</text>
  <text start="406.56" dur="4.77">the puzzle that I&amp;#39;m like okay okay</text>
  <text start="408.29" dur="4.54">Donald Trump jr. posting Zero Hedge you</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="3.51">know what if he&amp;#39;s forwarding these</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="2.43">articles along to his dad right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="2.73">funny</text>
  <text start="415.26" dur="3.99">funny to think about so that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="417.57" dur="4.89">much all I wanted to cover in the realm</text>
  <text start="419.25" dur="4.71">of politics not much new stuff you know</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="3.36">a lot of these things you guys probably</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="5">been thinking about already but again</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;ll see what happens this week and</text>
  <text start="428.96" dur="5.02">also I just want to cover a couple</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="5.22">science things first of all there was a</text>
  <text start="433.98" dur="6.42">giant glowing bubble spotted over Russia</text>
  <text start="436.77" dur="7.53">over Siberia and not only that but I saw</text>
  <text start="440.4" dur="6.57">a news story posting scientific journal</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="6.21">about Jupiter&amp;#39;s gravitational field</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="6.75">being what they said askew so all these</text>
  <text start="450.51" dur="5.58">stories mean to me and again I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="3.96">covering a lot of this in my ascension</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="3.9">webinar that I&amp;#39;m doing in a few weeks</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="5.31">here but there&amp;#39;s a lot of changes going</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="5.04">on in our solar system and all these</text>
  <text start="462.99" dur="3.81">changes are just showing us that that</text>
  <text start="465.03" dur="2.94">electric universe theory if you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="4.59">heard of the electric universe theory</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="5.7">look into it because it describes what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="3.83">going on in this cosmos and actually</text>
  <text start="473.67" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s a science it&amp;#39;s a form of</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="6.55">fundamental science that explains things</text>
  <text start="477.78" dur="6.65">much better than any BS you&amp;#39;ll find in</text>
  <text start="481.77" dur="4.8">conventional textbooks these days so</text>
  <text start="484.43" dur="4.3">that&amp;#39;s basically what&amp;#39;s going on there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="4.2">a lot of changes going on in our cosmos</text>
  <text start="488.73" dur="4.74">and our earth on you know in our whole</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="5.55">realm and we&amp;#39;ve really got to get to the</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="4.8">bottom of it and get to the bottom of</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="3.72">the scientific aspect of it because</text>
  <text start="498.27" dur="4.41">again there&amp;#39;s so much science that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.04" dur="5.07">taught these days that is wrong it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="3.69">just false and it&amp;#39;s false to control our</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="2.57">minds and manipulate us so we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="4.08">really understand what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="5.289">find out the powers of our minds and</text>
  <text start="510.45" dur="4.95">find out you know who we really are here</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="4.621">so again that webinar I&amp;#39;ll do will help</text>
  <text start="515.4" dur="4.139">you with that very interesting science</text>
  <text start="517.59" dur="4.23">stories breaking there was also that</text>
  <text start="519.539" dur="5.161">story about the mysterious object like</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="5.4">coming through our solar system and they</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="4.65">you know at first reading that it made</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="4.619">it sound like it was this UFO thing or</text>
  <text start="529.35" dur="3.89">like they&amp;#39;re trying to trying to seed</text>
  <text start="531.839" dur="2.49">our consciousness and have this like</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="3.159">contingency</text>
  <text start="534.329" dur="4.32">plan if they need to start disclosing</text>
  <text start="536.399" dur="3.511">things instead of like some people</text>
  <text start="538.649" dur="2.31">getting arrested that they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="3.539">the deep state didn&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="540.959" dur="5.82">arrested so anyway I won&amp;#39;t get off on</text>
  <text start="543.449" dur="6.151">that tangent I might do a lie that I</text>

  <text start="596.97" dur="8.969">remembered me of it reminded me of it</text>
  <text start="600.499" dur="7.75">that&amp;#39;s something to note because I mean</text>
  <text start="605.939" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s so many possibilities as to what</text>
  <text start="608.249" dur="5.64">that could mean what if this a</text>
  <text start="610.379" dur="5.76">nationwide drill and it&amp;#39;s a drill for an</text>
  <text start="613.889" dur="4.89">EMP so they say it&amp;#39;s a drill for a</text>
  <text start="616.139" dur="4.081">basically a solar storm if the solar</text>
  <text start="618.779" dur="4.11">flare would hit earth and knock out our</text>
  <text start="620.22" dur="6.089">power this is a drill to emulate that</text>
  <text start="622.889" dur="6.18">well lots of things could be happening</text>
  <text start="626.309" dur="4.56">during this drill what if it&amp;#39;s too I</text>
  <text start="629.069" dur="2.64">mean you kind of got a look at it from</text>
  <text start="630.869" dur="4.08">multiple sides</text>
  <text start="631.709" dur="5.521">what if it&amp;#39;s to formulate a mass arrest</text>
  <text start="634.949" dur="5.01">scenario could be right</text>
  <text start="637.23" dur="4.769">perfect perfect opportunity that would</text>
  <text start="639.959" dur="3.54">be if the you know power got knocked out</text>
  <text start="641.999" dur="3.57">in certain areas oh it&amp;#39;s a drill but</text>
  <text start="643.499" dur="4.65">they were actually able to arrest some</text>
  <text start="645.569" dur="4.35">deep Staters or I mean on the flip side</text>
  <text start="648.149" dur="4.951">that&amp;#39;s kind of a positive spin on it but</text>
  <text start="649.919" dur="6.27">what if there&amp;#39;s the not-so-good spin</text>
  <text start="653.1" dur="5.88">what if this is an opportunity for a</text>
  <text start="656.189" dur="4.95">false flag attack EMP false like tech</text>
  <text start="658.98" dur="3.75">could very well be so again looking at</text>
  <text start="661.139" dur="5.04">this you have to speculate on all sides</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="5.43">to be prepared for the worst but hope</text>
  <text start="666.179" dur="3.631">for the best could be either one of</text>
