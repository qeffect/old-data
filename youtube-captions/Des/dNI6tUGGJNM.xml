  <text start="6.379" dur="4.84">so Donald Trump is ruffling some</text>
  <text start="8.91" dur="6.42">feathers after yet again bringing up the</text>
  <text start="11.219" dur="7.551">idea of a space force Trump teases space</text>
  <text start="15.33" dur="6.72">force idea yet again for the US military</text>
  <text start="18.77" dur="5.44">so at a White House ceremony honoring a</text>
  <text start="22.05" dur="4.049">college football team Trump again</text>
  <text start="24.21" dur="3.45">floated the possibility of creating a</text>
  <text start="26.099" dur="4.02">new branch of the United States military</text>
  <text start="27.66" dur="6.149">dedicated to securing American supremacy</text>
  <text start="30.119" dur="6.631">in space and he goes on to say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="33.809" dur="4.41">actually thinking of a sixth branch of</text>
  <text start="36.75" dur="4.25">the military that would be the space</text>
  <text start="38.219" dur="5.25">force Trump added does that make sense</text>
  <text start="41" dur="4.239">he questioned interesting question to</text>
  <text start="43.469" dur="3.031">throw out there we&amp;#39;ll talk about the</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="3.75">background of this all in a minute</text>
  <text start="46.5" dur="4.53">he says the space force general you</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="3.541">probably haven&amp;#39;t even heard of that but</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="3.209">I&amp;#39;m just telling you now this is perhaps</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="4.74">because we&amp;#39;re getting very big in space</text>
  <text start="54.239" dur="6">both militarily and for other reasons we</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="5.82">are seriously thinking of a space force</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="5.161">now what Donald Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="5.67">here is seeding</text>
  <text start="65.4" dur="5.94">these ideas into the public domain into</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="6.09">the collective consciousness what he is</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="7.47">doing is making very subtle sly remarks</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="7.71">with very poignant questions to prepare</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="6.9">us for secret space program disclosures</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="5.52">in the near future now let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="5.4">some background all of this the United</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="5.85">States military not that just the US</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="6.75">military but there&amp;#39;s been Nazi breakaway</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="5.85">groups there&amp;#39;s been many factions within</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="3.509">the US military I would rather say</text>
  <text start="99.78" dur="3.409">that&amp;#39;s not the US military itself</text>
  <text start="101.369" dur="4.561">there&amp;#39;s groups there&amp;#39;s compartmentalized</text>
  <text start="103.189" dur="4.901">projects within different branches of</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="5.7">the US military and other militaries</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="6.54">around the world that have all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="6.15">all already in space and many of them</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="5.489">have been in space for decades the</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="5.339">United States Navy has had secrets based</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="6.481">projects operational since at least the</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="6.181">1980s we could say the Air Force and the</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="5.04">CIA and other groups within the US</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="4.98">military industrial complex have had</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="4.68">secret space programs for</text>
  <text start="134.28" dur="6.03">maybe even longer than that maybe even</text>
  <text start="136.32" dur="6.39">since the 50s and 60s and then we can go</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="4.32">back even further and say that there</text>
  <text start="142.71" dur="4.5">have been Nazi breakaway groups that</text>
  <text start="144.63" dur="5.25">have had projects operational that were</text>
  <text start="147.21" dur="7.98">able to go into space since even the</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="8.97">1940s and possibly the late 1930s so the</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="5.55">idea of military groups being in space</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s been around for a long long time of</text>
  <text start="160.74" dur="5.18">course it&amp;#39;s been kept covert and kept</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="7.02">secret and been kept extremely</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="7.69">suppressed up until very recently at</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="6.09">least in the public domain now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="6.42">move along into discussing what does</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="5.58">Trump know okay so Donald Trump of</text>
  <text start="180.03" dur="5.76">course is floating these ideas in to the</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="4.77">public and in reality there&amp;#39;s all kinds</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="3.96">of secret space programs already in</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="5.46">existence so what does Trump know well</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="5.79">we can&amp;#39;t say that he knows everything</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="6.36">because of course many presidents are</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="5.61">not at the top of the totem pole I would</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="6.41">say none of them are and very few of</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="6.51">them are read in on or let in on</text>
  <text start="205.25" dur="5.61">particular projects and particular</text>
  <text start="207.66" dur="8.04">information for instance John F Kennedy</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="7.93">he knew about secret space programs he</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="6.66">was in basically an understudy if you</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="5.46">will or a pupil of James Forrestal the</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="5.4">very first secretary of the Navy who</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="5.13">also knew very well of German secret</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="5.009">space projects and was trying to</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="5.96">implement them for the US Navy John F</text>
  <text start="232.769" dur="5.25">Kennedy was trying to get information on</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="6.16">not only secret space programs and</text>
  <text start="238.019" dur="4.981">technology involved but the UFO and</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="3.6">extraterrestrial issue John F Kennedy</text>
  <text start="243" dur="4.459">was trying to get in on it trying to</text>
  <text start="245.1" dur="5.28">disclose it to the public and that is</text>
  <text start="247.459" dur="6.071">one of the main reasons that he was</text>
  <text start="250.38" dur="5.789">taken out not only Kennedy we have</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="5.4">Reagan Reagan was able to gain access to</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="6.211">a little bit of the information but of</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="5.73">course not everything we had Papa Bush</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="5.64">behind-the-scenes kind of pulling the</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="6.27">strings there so presidents have</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="5.459">not always been in a position of need to</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="4.44">know now let&amp;#39;s talk about Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="273.479" dur="4.59">well we can&amp;#39;t say he knows everything</text>
  <text start="275.37" dur="4.549">but looking at his connections</text>
  <text start="278.069" dur="5.82">throughout history of course he has</text>
  <text start="279.919" dur="6.761">almost direct family ties to Nikola</text>
  <text start="283.889" dur="7.951">Tesla and his work Donald Trump&amp;#39;s uncle</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="7.229">John G Trump was the man tasked to go</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="4.47">into a Nikola Tesla&amp;#39;s apartment obtained</text>
  <text start="293.909" dur="5.551">his papers and try to help decipher some</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="6.479">of them so Trump definitely has</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="5.19">connections we can be safe to say that</text>
  <text start="302.789" dur="3.901">he would hear things through the family</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="4.949">lines and through his connections that</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="6.719">would definitely be stuff that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="309.599" dur="5.461">told on the mainstream and look at the</text>
  <text start="313.409" dur="5.94">people that Donald Trump surrounds</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="7.38">himself with there is a plethora of very</text>
  <text start="319.349" dur="5.611">high-ranking military officials around</text>
  <text start="322.44" dur="5.36">him and not just general military</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="7.44">officials but there&amp;#39;s a lot of Navy and</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="6.669">Marine generals Admirals high-ranking</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="6.18">military officials that surround Donald</text>
  <text start="334.469" dur="5.521">Trump and we&amp;#39;re not gonna assume that</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="5.399">they&amp;#39;re gonna go and tell him everything</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="7.669">but we can say I think would be safe to</text>
  <text start="343.979" dur="6.231">say that they may have offered hints or</text>
  <text start="347.659" dur="4.721">pieces of information to trump or</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="7.15">telling Trump to say these particular</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="9.629">things for this very subtle or sly</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="7.859">reason so Donald Trump definitely knows</text>
  <text start="362.009" dur="5.011">I mean just look at his the his</text>
  <text start="365.219" dur="4.621">inauguration speech when he said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.02" dur="5.73">gonna you know unlock the technologies</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="6.449">of tomorrow and figure out the mysteries</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="5.759">of space again seeding the collective</text>
  <text start="376.289" dur="5.671">consciousness approaching these ideas in</text>
  <text start="378.509" dur="5.94">a very very watered-down very easy way</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="6.03">for people to get their minds accustom</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="5.701">to this type of information and not just</text>
  <text start="387.99" dur="5.489">Trump has approached these ideas but</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="4.949">let&amp;#39;s talk about Q of course q a few</text>
  <text start="393.479" dur="3.12">months ago can&amp;#39;t remember exactly one</text>
  <text start="395.099" dur="4.021">but this was pretty early on maybe near</text>
  <text start="396.599" dur="4.801">the end of November maybe a month or two</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="5.03">after Q began posting</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="5.91">he brought up the idea of the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="5.65">missing a whole shitload of money and</text>
  <text start="407.31" dur="7.38">the fact that the Pentagon has never</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="6.39">ever been audited so Q hasn&amp;#39;t directly</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="5.479">brought up the idea of secret space</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="6.72">programs but has approached the subject</text>
  <text start="420.169" dur="4.631">indirectly mentioning the missing money</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="5.039">from the Pentagon the fact that they</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="5.16">charge 1520 thousand dollars for hammers</text>
  <text start="427.949" dur="5.101">and toilet seats and launder the money</text>
  <text start="429.96" dur="5.37">and the fact that the Pentagon has never</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="6.239">been audited this is direct information</text>
  <text start="435.33" dur="5.97">that leads you into the realm of secret</text>
  <text start="439.289" dur="4.591">space programs and deep underground</text>
  <text start="441.3" dur="6.5">military bases and the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="6.3">the amount of that&amp;#39;s been built out</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="6.549">outside of the public knowledge not told</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="8.1">to us okay so there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
  <text start="454.349" dur="6.63">background there&amp;#39;s people in the US</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="5.1">military and especially within the US</text>
  <text start="460.979" dur="7.771">Navy that want this information</text>
  <text start="463.38" dur="7.08">disclosed that want to get the the</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="3.389">public&amp;#39;s consciousness raised to</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="3.57">understand that there are secret space</text>
  <text start="472.139" dur="3.271">programs that we have been in space for</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="3.419">a long time getting to space is very</text>
  <text start="475.41" dur="4.49">easy anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="477.449" dur="4.861">better known as electrogravitic</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="6.73">propulsion platforms exist</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="5.97">they literally bend the laws of physics</text>
  <text start="486.63" dur="3.15">and when I say bend the laws of physics</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="3.69">is because the laws of physics that we</text>
  <text start="489.78" dur="6.48">are taught are we actually need</text>
  <text start="491.97" dur="6.99">to rewrite them and the fact that mass</text>
  <text start="496.26" dur="5.01">cancellation technologies exist call it</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="5.01">portaling if you will or dematerializing</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="5.13">andrey materializing and not just that</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="4.59">but there&amp;#39;s consciousness assisted</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="4.799">technologies where you can literally</text>
  <text start="508.56" dur="6.06">pilot things with just your thoughts and</text>
  <text start="511.199" dur="6.09">remote view and do crazy kinds of things</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="5.94">with just the idea of mind so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.289" dur="6.331">all kinds I mean I&amp;#39;m kind of opening up</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="5.399">Pandora&amp;#39;s box of the SSP topic but once</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="5.28">you start delving into it it brings you</text>
  <text start="525.959" dur="5.191">down a whole host of info not just a</text>
  <text start="528.9" dur="3.929">couple things that float in space but</text>
  <text start="531.15" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re talking about Sciences</text>
  <text start="532.829" dur="4.561">technologies wondrous achievement</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="5.79">that have been done and that we need</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="6.45">disclosed to the public so the dots are</text>
  <text start="541.26" dur="6.21">being laid out there for us to connect</text>
  <text start="543.84" dur="8.04">by Donald Trump very easily by Donald</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="6.6">Trump some of them by Q of course Q has</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="4.53">very particular ways that that group has</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="4.47">to go about handing us information and</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="4.71">there are certain subjects that the Q</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="4.05">group is focusing on right now but there</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="4.2">has been hints there has been crumbs</text>
  <text start="562.59" dur="6.15">secret space program crumbs thrown out</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="5.82">there and it&amp;#39;s up to us to put these</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="5.37">dots together to figure out the truth</text>
  <text start="571.14" dur="5.13">for ourselves and to inform the general</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="3.87">public because we are the ones that are</text>
  <text start="576.27" dur="3.54">really going to prepare the collective</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="4.5">consciousness what Trump in doing right</text>
  <text start="579.81" dur="4.98">now are cracking they&amp;#39;re cracking the</text>
  <text start="582.48" dur="5.28">shell the very hard thick shell that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.79" dur="6.09">around a lot of people&amp;#39;s skulls right so</text>
  <text start="587.76" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re preparing it on a general sense</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="5.58">and then it&amp;#39;s up to us to get very</text>
  <text start="592.08" dur="7.05">specific with it and really hammer home</text>
  <text start="596.46" dur="5.31">the hard truths for people the hard</text>
  <text start="599.13" dur="5.19">information discussing all the aspects</text>
  <text start="601.77" dur="7.17">around SSPs and of course every other</text>
  <text start="604.32" dur="7.11">topic out there so that&amp;#39;s what we need</text>
  <text start="608.94" dur="4.56">to do and I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and link</text>
  <text start="611.43" dur="6.84">below a couple of videos maybe I&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="6.54">some cards pop up of good resource good</text>
  <text start="618.27" dur="4.41">video resources that I&amp;#39;ve done in the</text>
  <text start="620.04" dur="4.71">past maybe some whiteboard videos or</text>
  <text start="622.68" dur="3.63">whatnot about the secret space program</text>
  <text start="624.75" dur="5.49">so if you&amp;#39;re unaware of it you can</text>
  <text start="626.31" dur="5.97">gather some clarity and I&amp;#39;ll also link</text>
  <text start="630.24" dur="5.04">below a few interviews I have done with</text>
  <text start="632.28" dur="6.14">people that have actually been in black</text>
  <text start="635.28" dur="5.37">projects in classified think tanks in</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="5.29">underground military bases that that</text>
  <text start="640.65" dur="5.55">have witnessed these technologies that</text>
  <text start="643.71" dur="4.92">have actually designed craft for the</text>
  <text start="646.2" dur="7.44">Navy that&amp;#39;ll be the interview with</text>
  <text start="648.63" dur="6.69">William Tompkins he was a basically</text>
  <text start="653.64" dur="4.47">secret space program insider</text>
  <text start="655.32" dur="4.98">whistleblower if you will he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="658.11" dur="3.57">necessarily like that term but kind of</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="6.15">what he was doing he was bringing out a</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="7.44">lot of clot of covert information he was</text>
  <text start="666.45" dur="4.11">actually tasked to debrief</text>
  <text start="669.12" dur="2.909">spies during World War two that were</text>
  <text start="670.56" dur="3.27">bringing back information from the</text>
