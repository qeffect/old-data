  <text start="10.27" dur="6.249">boy do we have some illusions to destroy</text>
  <text start="13.82" dur="5.34">today and in this video what I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="16.519" dur="5.43">to do is talk to you about probably what</text>
  <text start="19.16" dur="6.66">is the most important concept to talk</text>
  <text start="21.949" dur="7.861">about period and that is ascension call</text>
  <text start="25.82" dur="5.999">it ascension call it the solar shift</text>
  <text start="29.81" dur="5.339">call it the Age of Aquarius apocalypse</text>
  <text start="31.819" dur="7.851">whatever you want but there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="35.149" dur="8.3">changes going on okay and these changes</text>
  <text start="39.67" dur="6.009">cosmic changes have been prophesized by</text>
  <text start="43.449" dur="4.421">many many many many many different</text>
  <text start="45.679" dur="6.45">religions spiritual teachings and not</text>
  <text start="47.87" dur="7.439">only religions but it&amp;#39;s also been</text>
  <text start="52.129" dur="6.27">calculated by many scientists as that</text>
  <text start="55.309" dur="4.55">there is some type of energetic effect</text>
  <text start="58.399" dur="6.54">something that&amp;#39;s going to take place</text>
  <text start="59.859" dur="8.171">around these years of 2012 to where we</text>
  <text start="64.939" dur="5.54">are now and where we are soon headed so</text>
  <text start="68.03" dur="5.97">what I want to do in this video is</text>
  <text start="70.479" dur="5.92">connect some of these ancient prophecies</text>
  <text start="74" dur="4.77">to a lot of this hardcore science and</text>
  <text start="76.399" dur="5.22">I&amp;#39;m gonna go through multiple scientists</text>
  <text start="78.77" dur="4.32">and then link them all to you so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="81.619" dur="3.841">gonna try to talk fast I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="83.09" dur="5.849">waste your time and I&amp;#39;m gonna try to not</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="5.88">to go off on tangents and rants so first</text>
  <text start="88.939" dur="5.191">I will discuss with you some of the</text>
  <text start="91.34" dur="5.819">prophecies that have discussed this</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="4.83">ascension or this solar shift that is</text>
  <text start="97.159" dur="3.81">essentially imminent which is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.96" dur="3.81">so important to talk about we all know</text>
  <text start="100.969" dur="3.9">about the Mayans they&amp;#39;re Mayans had</text>
  <text start="102.77" dur="3.84">their calendar that ended around 2012 oh</text>
  <text start="104.869" dur="5.07">why does it end and of course the media</text>
  <text start="106.61" dur="4.92">made a show about that the Bible</text>
  <text start="109.939" dur="3.991">obviously apocalypse</text>
  <text start="111.53" dur="4.74">what is apocalypse mean and Greek means</text>
  <text start="113.93" dur="4.53">to literally to uncover to reveal it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.27" dur="6.209">why they call it revelations it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="118.46" dur="6.75">about end times it&amp;#39;s about simply things</text>
  <text start="122.479" dur="4.32">getting the revealed and a new age a new</text>
  <text start="125.21" dur="3.659">beginning occurring</text>
  <text start="126.799" dur="4.321">I believe the Quran said the same thing</text>
  <text start="128.869" dur="3.971">they had the same archetypal themes in</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="3.79">Zoroastrianism</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="3.75">the Hopi had their prophesies a lot of</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="4.59">people who watch my channel might like</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="6.45">the law of one text another reference to</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="5.37">these changes time wave actually that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="6.36">an interesting one Terence Mckenna the</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="6.869">psychonaut he and his uh fractal right</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="4.5">he did some formulations with sacred</text>
  <text start="151.739" dur="4.681">geometry fractal nature stuff but his</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="4.8">time way theory converged at twenty</text>
  <text start="156.42" dur="5.46">twelve I know there&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot of</text>
  <text start="158.7" dur="4.65">stuff so just follow along take the</text>
  <text start="161.88" dur="3.96">keywords I say and do some more research</text>
  <text start="163.35" dur="4.859">on it if you&amp;#39;d like and then the Montauk</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.47">Project the Montauk Project for those</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="5.071">that like black project stuff was a CIA</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="6.99">project I believe in the 70s 80s</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="5.76">timeframe where they took human</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="4.92">consciousness they took people who had</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="5.16">good psy abilities and then had them try</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="7.46">to remote view into the past in the</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="8.759">future because I mean long story short</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="5.38">timeline travel alteration seeing all</text>
  <text start="192.959" dur="3.391">has to human consciousness anyway when</text>
  <text start="195.06" dur="3.989">they would try to look into the future</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="4.56">and get to around the point of 2012</text>
  <text start="199.049" dur="4.291">the impressions they would get from the</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="4.56">subject of the remote viewing would just</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="4.86">come blink it I mean whatever screen or</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="5.64">whatever format they use to see the</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="5.759">visions would just there&amp;#39;d be nothing so</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s very interesting and it&amp;#39;s simply</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="5.791">just all centered around something going</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="5.88">on some new age some new cycle occurring</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="5.459">now first scientists I&amp;#39;ll discuss are</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="5.009">these guys William Tift and Harold</text>
  <text start="225.209" dur="6.541">Hostin dr. William Tift quickly he was a</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="6.09">guy who did a lot of stuff in measuring</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="5.45">what&amp;#39;s called red shift now red shift is</text>
  <text start="234.299" dur="5.461">how conventional a strong astronomers</text>
  <text start="237.2" dur="4.3">find out how far away galaxies are</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="5.94">because they assume there&amp;#39;s this like</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="5.79">linear relationship in this red shift</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="4.74">value that they&amp;#39;re measuring it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="6.18">electromagnetic something they calculate</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="4.829">no no no too much about it but they</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="6">calculate this red shift and they assume</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="6.991">it&amp;#39;s how far away a galaxy is from us he</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="5.52">showed that to be wrong he actually</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="4.11">showed it to be quantum states that the</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="3.63">galaxies would</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="4.29">increase they would increase in certain</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="4.98">levels with their redshift amounts and</text>
  <text start="270.66" dur="4.5">this would not actually show that these</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="3.83">galaxies are you know moving away from</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="7.289">us it totally threw that on its head</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="7.66">Harold Aston who is a huge physicist in</text>
  <text start="282.449" dur="5.131">Europe he was the director of IBM&amp;#39;s full</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="6.06">European Patent Office for years very</text>
  <text start="287.58" dur="9.839">renowned but he took his idea of quantum</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="8.7">redshift States right and put that into</text>
  <text start="297.419" dur="4.711">what he was doing so what he was doing</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="4.02">is finding out certain sacred</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="4.05">geometrical relationships at the atomic</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="4.769">scale he would find how atoms are</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="6.27">surrounded by this like cubical sphere</text>
  <text start="308.639" dur="6.211">and they would be packed in to formulate</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="4.469">matter based upon that so when hearing</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="4.41">about Tiff&amp;#39;s idea that redshift is</text>
  <text start="316.919" dur="4.711">quantum he&amp;#39;s like huh right let&amp;#39;s try to</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="5.189">take the atomic scale and work it at a</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="4.95">galactic scale right as above so below</text>
  <text start="324.449" dur="5.34">that beautiful cosmic law of</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="6.93">Correspondence so Harold Aspen then</text>
  <text start="329.789" dur="6.391">calculated well holy crap our Sun it has</text>
  <text start="333.51" dur="5.73">its own little space domain and right</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="7.65">now it is literally moving into another</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="7.17">and that brings up a big you know one of</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="4.35">those little little things that they</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="4.74">tell us that are totally asked backwards</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="6.06">because remember right here quick</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="5.19">sidenote that&amp;#39;s why modern physics is so</text>
  <text start="354.24" dur="3.929">asked backwards and so just skewed is</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="4.23">because it&amp;#39;s the foundations that are</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="5.641">bad and then they&amp;#39;ll build theory upon</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="4.89">theory with bad foundations okay which</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="4.289">is why it&amp;#39;s they haven&amp;#39;t tough time</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="4.56">understanding things things as simple as</text>
  <text start="368.099" dur="4.201">gravity right ask our modern physicists</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="4.28">what is gravity is is force and Apple</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="4.08">drops anyway</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="4.869">one of those little things that are</text>
  <text start="376.38" dur="4.86">wrong in the foundation of physics is</text>
  <text start="379.169" dur="4.021">solar system movement so this is how</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="5.489">we&amp;#39;re taught in school for years and</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="5.61">years and years is that Sun Earth and</text>
  <text start="386.729" dur="4.291">Mars and Venus all the planets move in</text>
  <text start="388.8" dur="4.17">circles around it I just have a really</text>
  <text start="391.02" dur="4.44">basic question that probably a</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="4.62">four-year-old could ask why don&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="4.65">planets crash into the Sun if there is a</text>
  <text start="397.59" dur="4.86">constant pull of gravity if</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="4.41">what they say why doesn&amp;#39;t the planet end</text>
  <text start="402.45" dur="5.58">up here just crash into the Sun that way</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="6.3">I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s cuz it&amp;#39;s wrong here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="4.35">how solar systems really move and all</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="3.6">like a good video down below about this</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s just super interesting to me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="414.42" dur="4.8">seeing it it&amp;#39;s kind of beautiful to</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="7.71">watch as the Sun moves remember what do</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="7.05">the planets do move around it boom the</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="3.72">law of rhythm right there I&amp;#39;m reading</text>
  <text start="426.27" dur="4.92">the Chi Balian right now so a lot of</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="5.88">like very deep wisdom there but boom</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="5.45">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s rhythmic as our Sun moves</text>
  <text start="433.56" dur="7.25">plants move around it and this is a big</text>
  <text start="436.64" dur="8.08">big thing for multiple reasons one is</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="5.41">the creation of light and physical</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="3">matter which I won&amp;#39;t get into here but</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="3.93">another is just simply because our star</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="6.99">is moving into another region of space</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="8.61">now I want to discuss dr. paul la</text>
  <text start="454.71" dur="6.57">Villette this guy is another awesome</text>
  <text start="458.76" dur="5.25">researcher he has a couple books out one</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="4.8">is called sub quantum kinetics and one</text>
  <text start="464.01" dur="3.96">is called secrets of anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="4.05">propulsion he&amp;#39;s the only one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="3.36">alive out of all these guys you can</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="3.48">actually still find some of his</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="5.97">testimony on Project Camelot and the</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="5.61">disclosure project but he you know along</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="4.98">with researching the coupling between</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="5.31">gravity and electricity and discussing</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="6.54">Thomas Townsend Brown&amp;#39;s research on that</text>
  <text start="484.53" dur="6.24">he has also theorized about what he is</text>
  <text start="488.82" dur="5.75">called the Galactic super wave which is</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="7.26">what kind of made him really popular and</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="6.67">very interesting theory in that what he</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="6.99">found what by testing actually ice core</text>
  <text start="501.24" dur="5.94">samples is that he found cosmic dusts to</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="4.41">be in these ice core samples at certain</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="4.44">intervals he&amp;#39;s like how the heck is</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="4.5">there so much cosmic dust you know and</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="5.31">at these certain intervals well what he</text>
  <text start="513.93" dur="5.64">found was that gamma ray pulses emanate</text>
  <text start="516.93" dur="4.5">from our galactic center at regular at</text>
  <text start="519.57" dur="4.5">these regular intervals and he found</text>
  <text start="521.43" dur="5.25">that they would there would be major</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="5.13">ones and minor ones kind of depending on</text>
  <text start="526.68" dur="5.4">the astrological or the cosmic</text>
  <text start="529.2" dur="4.86">alignments occurring so the major ones</text>
  <text start="532.08" dur="3.96">he found to be found</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="6.63">what major wants to be every 13,000</text>
  <text start="536.04" dur="7.2">years and we are due for a big one now</text>
  <text start="540.69" dur="4.77">so right now we are at the convergence</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="4.65">of like many of these alignments and we</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="6.36">are expecting we&amp;#39;re actually overdue for</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="6.66">one of these large waves now I&amp;#39;ll bring</text>
  <text start="551.82" dur="5.16">some Hopi prophecy into the picture just</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="5.61">to kind of connect to show you how you</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="5.85">know when you disassociate yourself from</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="5.4">both scientific dogma and religious</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="4.14">dogma really the answers are there the</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="3">ant the religion has the answers you</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="4.08">just have to look at much deeper levels</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="3.81">and most people do and with this Hopi</text>
  <text start="571.05" dur="3.39">prophecy I&amp;#39;m gonna literally read it out</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="5.52">to you right I have a note and it says</text>
  <text start="574.44" dur="5.339">and this is the ninth and last sign you</text>
  <text start="577.89" dur="4.74">will hear of a dwelling place in the</text>
  <text start="579.779" dur="6.06">heavens above the earth that shall fall</text>
  <text start="582.63" dur="6.6">with a great crash it will appear as a</text>
  <text start="585.839" dur="5.041">blue star in the sky and very soon after</text>
  <text start="589.23" dur="3.84">this the ceremonies of my people will</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="3.81">cease now why this is important is</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="3.03">because dr. Paul lavallette in</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="5.37">formulating his galactic super wave</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="7.02">theory postulated that when this super</text>
  <text start="600.06" dur="5.7">wave hits the earth it&amp;#39;ll start as a</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="4.5">blue star in the sky because those are</text>
  <text start="605.76" dur="4.44">the gamma rays the cosmic radiation</text>
  <text start="607.62" dur="4.77">beginning to intercept us it will then</text>
  <text start="610.2" dur="4.05">expand and then boom the radiation will</text>
  <text start="612.39" dur="3.78">hit so that&amp;#39;s he didn&amp;#39;t even know about</text>
  <text start="614.25" dur="3.48">that so that&amp;#39;s just a direct kind of</text>
  <text start="616.17" dur="3.84">reference right that are super</text>
  <text start="617.73" dur="4.59">interesting to me and then my theory</text>
  <text start="620.01" dur="5.01">tying these two in together space</text>
  <text start="622.32" dur="5.76">domains and super waves is that and this</text>
  <text start="625.02" dur="8.01">all has to do with torsion physics ether</text>
  <text start="628.08" dur="6.15">physics that uh you know big topic to</text>
  <text start="633.03" dur="3.39">get into I need a white board like this</text>
  <text start="634.23" dur="5.97">big seriously like my whole wall needs</text>
  <text start="636.42" dur="5.25">to be a white board it&amp;#39;s planned for the</text>
  <text start="640.2" dur="3.69">future actually like alternate</text>
  <text start="641.67" dur="4.2">universities where we can piece this all</text>
  <text start="643.89" dur="4.5">together and learn about it but anyway</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="4.44">what I think&amp;#39;s going on is certain</text>
  <text start="648.39" dur="4.59">cosmic alignments are occurring</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="4.71">certain astrological alignments and we</text>
  <text start="652.98" dur="4.049">are due right now this why 2012 so big</text>
  <text start="655.02" dur="4.92">is that because so many of them are</text>
  <text start="657.029" dur="4.801">aligning is that the rotation of each of</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="5.03">them and the torsion energy that each</text>
  <text start="661.83" dur="5.85">planetary and star body creates is</text>
  <text start="664.97" dur="4.33">syncing up okay that</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="3.39">energy is traveling through the cosmic</text>
  <text start="669.3" dur="3.78">web so each other to each other and then</text>
  <text start="671.07" dur="5.1">so yeah as we moving to the next space</text>
  <text start="673.08" dur="8.25">domain it all aligns for that super wave</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="7.169">- right it&amp;#39;s like a tuning fork now I</text>
  <text start="681.33" dur="5.19">want to bring do we be larson into the</text>
  <text start="683.339" dur="5.041">picture lastly here and do we be Larsen</text>
  <text start="686.52" dur="5.91">was an American engineer and physicist</text>
  <text start="688.38" dur="6.75">in the mid 1900s who came up with</text>
  <text start="692.43" dur="4.89">essentially his own type of unified</text>
  <text start="695.13" dur="6.56">field theory his own theory of</text>
  <text start="697.32" dur="7.32">everything and apparently a lot of</text>
  <text start="701.69" dur="4.87">insiders like secret space program</text>
  <text start="704.64" dur="4.02">whistleblowers and even a guy who is</text>
  <text start="706.56" dur="4.98">working on the Montauk Project an</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="4.89">insider named Daniel who I will link</text>
  <text start="711.54" dur="4.02">some research about this down below but</text>
  <text start="713.55" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve all said that Dewey B Larsen</text>
  <text start="715.56" dur="5.46">pretty much came the closest to a theory</text>
  <text start="718.17" dur="5.039">of everything that anyone has and funny</text>
  <text start="721.02" dur="4.86">enough Dewey B Larsen was actually best</text>
  <text start="723.209" dur="3.931">buds with Linus Pauling in school and if</text>
  <text start="725.88" dur="3.39">you don&amp;#39;t know the Linus Pauling is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="727.14" dur="4.05">won the Nobel Peace Prize for all types</text>
  <text start="729.27" dur="3.42">of stuff but he actually proved vitamin</text>
  <text start="731.19" dur="5.76">C therapies are very effective against</text>
  <text start="732.69" dur="6.12">cancer a famous health doctor but anyway</text>
  <text start="736.95" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s really funny that him and do the</text>
  <text start="738.81" dur="4.14">best buds but his reciprocal Systems</text>
  <text start="740.82" dur="5.959">Theory just kind of a background on it</text>
  <text start="742.95" dur="7.17">really quick was that he basically</text>
  <text start="746.779" dur="5.051">scientifically calculated how Yin Yin</text>
  <text start="750.12" dur="4.17">Yang operates which is really friggin</text>
  <text start="751.83" dur="4.949">interesting so he took gravity and</text>
  <text start="754.29" dur="4.44">radiation and he said that they have a</text>
  <text start="756.779" dur="4.201">reciprocal relationship with each other</text>
  <text start="758.73" dur="5.37">right gravity is that compressive inward</text>
  <text start="760.98" dur="5.25">force and radiation is the outward force</text>
  <text start="764.1" dur="4.02">so that&amp;#39;s how grab that he truly</text>
  <text start="766.23" dur="4.52">operates it&amp;#39;s not really you know like</text>
  <text start="768.12" dur="6.5">over here it&amp;#39;s not what they tell us</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="8.829">gravity is compression radiation is</text>
  <text start="774.62" dur="7.18">expression implosion explosion right law</text>
  <text start="779.579" dur="3.841">of polarity haha like the law of</text>
  <text start="781.8" dur="4.979">Correspondence over here I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="783.42" dur="5.039">reading that ty valiant and then we have</text>
  <text start="786.779" dur="3.81">another reciprocal relationship between</text>
  <text start="788.459" dur="6.531">space and time and time and space</text>
  <text start="790.589" dur="7.101">so yeah reciprocal this this actually</text>
  <text start="794.99" dur="5.14">legitimately explains time travel</text>
  <text start="797.69" dur="3.91">explains the antigravity explains the</text>
  <text start="800.13" dur="4.889">free energy explains a whole freakin</text>
  <text start="801.6" dur="5.669">which is you know huge to kind of</text>
  <text start="805.019" dur="3.93">unlearn and relearn with but anyway the</text>
  <text start="807.269" dur="5.281">point I want to make with reciprocal</text>
  <text start="808.949" dur="7.351">systems in this is that a lot of</text>
  <text start="812.55" dur="6.3">arm-flailing is that stellar evolution</text>
  <text start="816.3" dur="3.99">is backwards so another one of those</text>
  <text start="818.85" dur="4.229">points that they teach us wrong in</text>
  <text start="820.29" dur="5.609">school is that and one of the simple</text>
  <text start="823.079" dur="3.481">things is that stars don&amp;#39;t evolve like</text>
  <text start="825.899" dur="2.641">they tell us</text>
  <text start="826.56" dur="5.63">so in conventional mainstream astronomy</text>
  <text start="828.54" dur="6.09">they tell us that stars start out blue</text>
  <text start="832.19" dur="4.36">the blue stars of the young stars and as</text>
  <text start="834.63" dur="4.259">they evolve they turn into red stars and</text>
  <text start="836.55" dur="2.93">then blow up but this is again asked</text>
  <text start="838.889" dur="3.771">backwards</text>
  <text start="839.48" dur="6.19">stars actually go from red to blue</text>
  <text start="842.66" dur="5.169">because when this space dust starts</text>
  <text start="845.67" dur="4.46">swirling around and compresses right</text>
  <text start="847.829" dur="5.281">gravity gets stronger and as gravity</text>
  <text start="850.13" dur="5.05">compresses more matter into the star</text>
  <text start="853.11" dur="5.669">that&amp;#39;s forming it start up it starts out</text>
  <text start="855.18" dur="5.61">is red red is the young stars and then</text>
  <text start="858.779" dur="3.93">the young stars write more stuff</text>
  <text start="860.79" dur="3.239">compresses more stuff compresses the</text>
  <text start="862.709" dur="4.591">stars actually get a little smaller</text>
  <text start="864.029" dur="6.81">turns from red to orange gets a little</text>
  <text start="867.3" dur="5.64">smaller orange to yellow to white as it</text>
  <text start="870.839" dur="4.651">gets to about the white range that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.94" dur="4.74">when enough matter gets into the star</text>
  <text start="875.49" dur="4.02">where it starts expanding it starts</text>
  <text start="877.68" dur="5.279">going into a blue star grows grows grows</text>
  <text start="879.51" dur="6.889">and then the supernova occurs supernovas</text>
  <text start="882.959" dur="5.341">are you&amp;#39;re usually photographed as blue</text>
  <text start="886.399" dur="4.331">now think of it this way</text>
  <text start="888.3" dur="5.55">this makes so much freakin logical sense</text>
  <text start="890.73" dur="5.13">that it&amp;#39;s actually red to blue in</text>
  <text start="893.85" dur="4.26">stellar evolution because thinking about</text>
  <text start="895.86" dur="5.669">think about heating up metal right a</text>
  <text start="898.11" dur="6.779">welder when he starts heating up the</text>
  <text start="901.529" dur="4.891">metal the metal is red at its coldest</text>
  <text start="904.889" dur="6.93">and as the metal gets hotter and hotter</text>
  <text start="906.42" dur="7.349">it turns into blue and then boom so it</text>
  <text start="911.819" dur="3.51">just makes so much freakin sense when</text>
  <text start="913.769" dur="3.541">you think of it that way stars actually</text>
  <text start="915.329" dur="6.031">go from red to blue and what he also</text>
  <text start="917.31" dur="6.42">found was that again stellar evolution</text>
  <text start="921.36" dur="5.64">is quantum it occurs in leaps not</text>
  <text start="923.73" dur="5.549">linearly so you know again these two</text>
  <text start="927" dur="4.56">guys over here whenever people start</text>
  <text start="929.279" dur="3.961">getting into the ether physics or</text>
  <text start="931.56" dur="2.71">torsion physics they always find it to</text>
  <text start="933.24" dur="4.3">be quantum for them</text>
  <text start="934.27" dur="7.98">universe and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="937.54" dur="8.04">is our Sun our star is moving from what</text>
  <text start="942.25" dur="5.43">they call I believe a class F star to a</text>
  <text start="945.58" dur="5.04">Class G star that it&amp;#39;s going from a</text>
  <text start="947.68" dur="4.68">yellow star to a yellow white star if</text>
  <text start="950.62" dur="3.93">you talk to people that have been on</text>
  <text start="952.36" dur="3.81">this planet for longer than I have</text>
  <text start="954.55" dur="3.45">I&amp;#39;ve only been on this planet 26 years</text>
  <text start="956.17" dur="3.84">you know I&amp;#39;ve talked to people who have</text>
  <text start="958" dur="5.31">been around a while and they&amp;#39;ve told me</text>
  <text start="960.01" dur="4.5">yeah you know the Sun is changing it</text>
  <text start="963.31" dur="2.7">used to be yellow and now it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="964.51" dur="4.25">light it&amp;#39;s bright it&amp;#39;s burning my</text>
  <text start="966.01" dur="5.37">eyeballs like yeah it burns mine too</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="5.05">because it&amp;#39;s getting hotter and warmer</text>
  <text start="971.38" dur="5.82">and it&amp;#39;s about to take that jump that</text>
  <text start="973.81" dur="5.67">leap and this brings a quote from</text>
  <text start="977.2" dur="5.04">revelations into the mix right again</text>
  <text start="979.48" dur="5.88">tying together spirituality and science</text>
  <text start="982.24" dur="6.57">in that what do we be larson said is</text>
  <text start="985.36" dur="5.16">that and I believe he might have said</text>
  <text start="988.81" dur="3.33">this too maybe I actually just came</text>
  <text start="990.52" dur="3.09">across all the space domain stuff within</text>
  <text start="992.14" dur="4.68">the last couple of weeks I&amp;#39;ve known</text>
  <text start="993.61" dur="6.12">about these for years but I came across</text>
  <text start="996.82" dur="3.93">David Wilcock work on this so go look at</text>
  <text start="999.73" dur="3.93">him for more on this I don&amp;#39;t know too</text>
  <text start="1000.75" dur="6.24">much about it anyway what he was saying</text>
  <text start="1003.66" dur="6.27">was that when the Sun makes its quantum</text>
  <text start="1006.99" dur="6.12">jump it&amp;#39;s actually going to go dark for</text>
  <text start="1009.93" dur="4.62">a period of time and this brings a</text>
  <text start="1013.11" dur="4.32">revelations quote to the picture that I</text>
  <text start="1014.55" dur="4.65">will also read to you Revelation 6:12 I</text>
  <text start="1017.43" dur="4.28">don&amp;#39;t really know my Bibble all that</text>
  <text start="1019.2" dur="6.03">well so that&amp;#39;s why I need these notes</text>
  <text start="1021.71" dur="5.62">when he opened the sixth seal I looked</text>
  <text start="1025.23" dur="6.33">and behold there was a great earthquake</text>
  <text start="1027.33" dur="8.36">and the Sun became black as sackcloth is</text>
  <text start="1031.56" dur="7.71">what that says boom they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="1035.69" dur="8.35">Sun goes dark again when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1039.27" dur="6.689">like religious texts you really have to</text>
  <text start="1044.04" dur="3.66">look like 18 layers deeper that most</text>
  <text start="1045.959" dur="5.251">people want to because remember they</text>
  <text start="1047.7" dur="5.16">whoever writes biblical or whatever a</text>
  <text start="1051.21" dur="3.21">Bible it is they got to abide by</text>
  <text start="1052.86" dur="3.78">freewill they can&amp;#39;t give us the answers</text>
  <text start="1054.42" dur="5.4">you got to find the answers so trying to</text>
  <text start="1056.64" dur="6.03">help you find them so boom star goes</text>
  <text start="1059.82" dur="5.31">dark and honestly I think that the whole</text>
  <text start="1062.67" dur="5.18">the Sun God dead for three days</text>
  <text start="1065.13" dur="2.72">symbology</text>
  <text start="1068.13" dur="6.03">some people say that that means like the</text>
  <text start="1070.95" dur="4.74">Sun during Christmas time being staying</text>
  <text start="1074.16" dur="2.37">at the same latitude for three days and</text>
  <text start="1075.69" dur="3.06">then starting to rise</text>
  <text start="1076.53" dur="5.16">I actually think at the deepest level</text>
  <text start="1078.75" dur="5.49">that dead for three days theme that</text>
  <text start="1081.69" dur="4.71">archetype is actually discussing the</text>
  <text start="1084.24" dur="4.59">quantum leap our star makes because the</text>
  <text start="1086.4" dur="5.76">Sun God being dead for three days right</text>
  <text start="1088.83" dur="6.27">that dead for three days could mean</text>
  <text start="1092.16" dur="6.75">black turning block and then reappearing</text>
  <text start="1095.1" dur="8.97">as a brighter right being resurrected as</text>
  <text start="1098.91" dur="8.37">a brighter star so anyway trying not to</text>
  <text start="1104.07" dur="5.9">go off on those rants now to tie these</text>
  <text start="1107.28" dur="4.95">three back into the picture for you guys</text>
  <text start="1109.97" dur="4.27">what&amp;#39;s occurring with our solar system</text>
  <text start="1112.23" dur="5.49">our star is moving into its next space</text>
  <text start="1114.24" dur="5.22">domain when we get to that bridge</text>
  <text start="1117.72" dur="3.6">between the space domains I think</text>
  <text start="1119.46" dur="4.77">certain astrological alignments occur</text>
  <text start="1121.32" dur="7.61">that sends off super waves when that</text>
  <text start="1124.23" dur="7.5">super wave hits us it causes this it</text>
  <text start="1128.93" dur="5.65">essentially gives our star enough energy</text>
  <text start="1131.73" dur="5.7">to then make that quantum leap the star</text>
  <text start="1134.58" dur="4.89">goes dark what also occurs is that a</text>
  <text start="1137.43" dur="6.95">magnetic pole reversal occurs on our</text>
  <text start="1139.47" dur="7.31">earth and who knows I mean we can just</text>
  <text start="1144.38" dur="4.48">speculate at what - the literal</text>
  <text start="1146.78" dur="4.69">foundational laws of physics would be</text>
  <text start="1148.86" dur="4.32">but that&amp;#39;s literally what I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1151.47" dur="4.35">headed towards the sun&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="1153.18" dur="4.53">brighter I just saw a video a couple</text>
  <text start="1155.82" dur="3.42">days ago of somebody I&amp;#39;ll even try to</text>
  <text start="1157.71" dur="5.4">put it in for a few seconds here</text>
  <text start="1159.24" dur="5.73">somebody was had a iPhone like a phone</text>
  <text start="1163.11" dur="4.23">camera in Spain and there was pulses</text>
  <text start="1164.97" dur="5.94">going off from the Sun that&amp;#39;s also what</text>
  <text start="1167.34" dur="5.58">I believe these guys said would occur as</text>
  <text start="1170.91" dur="4.38">the Sun gets really close to its quantum</text>
  <text start="1172.92" dur="5.04">leap it&amp;#39;s shift it would start flaring</text>
  <text start="1175.29" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing the magnetic poles of Earth</text>
  <text start="1177.96" dur="4.86">go way far right just look into the</text>
  <text start="1180.69" dur="4.29">where the magnetic poles of Earth are</text>
  <text start="1182.82" dur="3.96">now they are not over actual north and</text>
  <text start="1184.98" dur="5.03">south pole I think the North Pole is</text>
  <text start="1186.78" dur="5.31">over like Siberia and the Antarctic</text>
  <text start="1190.01" dur="4.48">magnetic I&amp;#39;m talking magnetic north and</text>
  <text start="1192.09" dur="5.43">south pole are over it&amp;#39;s out in the</text>
  <text start="1194.49" dur="5.49">ocean not even in Antarctica and we also</text>
  <text start="1197.52" dur="3.629">are seeing very large coronal holes on</text>
  <text start="1199.98" dur="2.519">the Sun there</text>
  <text start="1201.149" dur="3.9">actually one facing the earth right now</text>
  <text start="1202.499" dur="5.701">but the Sun is getting massive coronal</text>
  <text start="1205.049" dur="5.46">holes we&amp;#39;re seeing these coronal holes</text>
  <text start="1208.2" dur="5.069">and golf even like a third of the Sun so</text>
  <text start="1210.509" dur="4.561">a third of the Sun is black almost so</text>
  <text start="1213.269" dur="4.23">that these are signs that we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1215.07" dur="7.109">close and then I think very soon that</text>
  <text start="1217.499" dur="6.961">Sun will be full black and not only will</text>
  <text start="1222.179" dur="4.29">it totally redo what the hell&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1224.46" dur="4.62">in our solar system but also have</text>
  <text start="1226.469" dur="5.25">profound effects on our consciousness</text>
  <text start="1229.08" dur="4.74">and this is one of the biggest things to</text>
  <text start="1231.719" dur="4.14">tie into all of this is that cosmic</text>
  <text start="1233.82" dur="3.959">energy cosmic radiation and this solar</text>
  <text start="1235.859" dur="4.17">shift will profoundly influence our</text>
  <text start="1237.779" dur="5.81">consciousness and what I want to do in</text>
  <text start="1240.029" dur="6.99">this video is I&amp;#39;m going to gift you guys</text>
  <text start="1243.589" dur="6.04">down below from my gaya account one of</text>
  <text start="1247.019" dur="3.78">my favorite documentaries ever I think</text>
  <text start="1249.629" dur="2.91">you were able to watch it for maybe like</text>
  <text start="1250.799" dur="3.87">a day or two but it&amp;#39;s called solar</text>
  <text start="1252.539" dur="6.72">revolution and it was produced by a</text>
  <text start="1254.669" dur="7.041">German biophysicist in 2012 he was</text>
  <text start="1259.259" dur="4.83">discussing all of this he was discussing</text>
  <text start="1261.71" dur="4.659">2012 occurring some solar shift</text>
  <text start="1264.089" dur="4.29">happening but this documentary discussed</text>
  <text start="1266.369" dur="5.25">how it influences our consciousness</text>
  <text start="1268.379" dur="5.91">which is I don&amp;#39;t want to expound in two</text>
