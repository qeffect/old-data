  <text start="10.55" dur="5.559">hey guys Jordans safer here it&amp;#39;s the ass</text>
  <text start="13.559" dur="5.011">crack of dawn and I woke up to give you</text>
  <text start="16.109" dur="5.25">guys the report on the vault seven that</text>
  <text start="18.57" dur="5.25">was just released to update you on what</text>
  <text start="21.359" dur="6.481">did it exactly it is now it&amp;#39;s not any</text>
  <text start="23.82" dur="8.22">large pedophile or UFO disclosures is I</text>
  <text start="27.84" dur="8.01">always get giddy for but this is much</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="6.359">more tactful much more practical and</text>
  <text start="35.85" dur="5.91">what vault seven is is that it&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="4.5">one they WikiLeaks in their overview of</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="3.209">it that I&amp;#39;ll link down below they</text>
  <text start="42.899" dur="4.651">mentioned it&amp;#39;s only part one so that we</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="5.101">there will be more parts coming but this</text>
  <text start="47.55" dur="6.57">is an overview of all the CIA hacking</text>
  <text start="50.07" dur="7.11">and it was obtained very recently these</text>
  <text start="54.12" dur="5.849">vault seven cables were covers through</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="7.65">2016 and it&amp;#39;s the largest intelligence</text>
  <text start="59.969" dur="7.321">publication in history so on one hand it</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="4.829">might not seem like exactly what we</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="3.2">wanted but I think it is exactly what we</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="4.53">needed</text>
  <text start="70.49" dur="8.019">so vault seven released today on March</text>
  <text start="74.189" dur="6.031">seventh but it discusses I&amp;#39;ll kind of go</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="4.591">through specifically what a lot of these</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="6.63">cables discuss it says that all</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="5.67">computerized cars can be hacked and in</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="3.99">the WikiLeaks write-up of these cables</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="5.309">it says they could stay say it can make</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="5.7">for easy assassinations so that makes me</text>
  <text start="94.079" dur="5.731">think like hey Paul Walker right I mean</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="6.21">there&amp;#39;s plenty of death by car that we</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="6.989">see that&amp;#39;s very controversial or</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="7.02">interesting to speculate on all of the</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="5.07">CIA malware they have created in these</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="4.65">hacking programs that WikiLeaks is</text>
  <text start="111.869" dur="4.71">blowing the whistle on states all cell</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="5.699">phones can be hacked and even through</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="5.131">encrypted acts apps I should say so if</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="4.261">you have an encrypted app that you use</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="4.229">to send messages on this CIA malware</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="4.2">where actually take the message before</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="5.04">it gets encrypted so a lot of these in</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="5.04">encryption apps don&amp;#39;t necessarily do the</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="2.941">complete job if somebody knows how to</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="3.06">work</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="4.319">around them and in this WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="3.84">release it also stated that the malware</text>
  <text start="138.239" dur="5.341">could target presidential accounts and</text>
  <text start="140.52" dur="6.51">also the accounts of basically all other</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="5.73">politicians and government workers which</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s a very interesting point to note</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="6.17">because a lot of these people in cabinet</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="9.26">positions and in governmental office are</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="10.15">blackmailed they&amp;#39;re often you could say</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="8.59">drawn in by a CIA asset I mean it could</text>
  <text start="165.63" dur="8">be a girl that is 16 17 18 dresses</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="4.83">herself up to look like 21 ropes in a</text>
  <text start="173.63" dur="4.329">congressman or a type of politician</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="4.34">sleeps with them this they film it and</text>
  <text start="177.959" dur="4.321">then they actually are able to have</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="4.99">blackmail on that politician to do what</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="4.709">they want so this is why oftentimes</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="4.17">going through bureaucratic agencies for</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="3.78">legal help is so difficult right like</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="4.41">the human trafficking stuff because a</text>
  <text start="190.769" dur="5.131">lot of these politicians are blackmailed</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="6.9">with their own dirt on them so they</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="6.33">don&amp;#39;t want to do anything now a lot of</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="3.66">that dirt can be obtained right here</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="4.979">right through the CIA hacking things</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="5.28">like that also in these leaks it stated</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="5.611">that a US consulate in Frankfurt was</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="6.269">basically a secret CIA hacking base for</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="4.5">the Europe region very interesting there</text>
  <text start="215.609" dur="3.451">and this is all just from there right up</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="4.59">on the WikiLeaks page we&amp;#39;ll delve more</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="6.06">into these cables and these files and</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="5.79">see what&amp;#39;s going on and then lastly the</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="4.8">CIA would use a lot of secretive ways to</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="4.43">obtain state funding so they would</text>
  <text start="229.92" dur="5.069">basically leave all of this malware</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="4.87">unclassified so technically nobody was</text>
  <text start="234.989" dur="4.981">sharing classified state secrets when</text>
  <text start="237" dur="5.34">they would spread this malware and the</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="3.87">CIA basically hid a didn&amp;#39;t say much</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="4.08">about it but they were able to obtain a</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="4.5">lot of state funding and go around the</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="4.62">Obama administration for a lot of</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="4.53">support with this because after the NSA</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="5.939">leaks the Obama administration wanted to</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="6.23">crackdown on cyber war cyber warfare but</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="3.991">the CIA was still doing it right so they</text>
  <text start="259.1" dur="3.76">basically went around the Obama</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="5.73">administration used you know deep state</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="4.92">tactics to do so so anyway that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="2.52">basic overview</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="4.32">that I wanted to cover and regardez</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="4.68">leaks it is a large attack on the CIA</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="2.97">which is very interesting right I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="4.38">gonna speculate for a minute here</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="6.36">because the timing of this coincides</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="6.72">with Trump&amp;#39;s wiretap claims just a few</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="3.9">days ago so in the video I just did last</text>
  <text start="285" dur="2.49">night</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="4.32">discussing these wiretap investigations</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="5.55">I mentioned that I believe they are</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="5.31">easing in a lot of this these</text>
  <text start="293.04" dur="3.99">disclosures to the public consciousness</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="3.87">as to not create a hysteria</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="3.9">so not only are Trump&amp;#39;s wiretap claims</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="4.53">coming out but WikiLeaks right we know</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="3.87">as dr. Steve Bennett reported that</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="4.2">WikiLeaks works with a lot of these</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="4.619">American Intel Patriots lies white hats</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="4.26">so WikiLeaks could be dropping into</text>
  <text start="309.419" dur="5.881">vaults seven now specifically on the CIA</text>
  <text start="311.82" dur="9.36">as a master chess move as an attack on</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="8.46">the deep state themselves and also lay</text>
  <text start="321.18" dur="4.83">out easier information to us for us to</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="3.93">acclimate to right everybody already</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="2.969">knows like oh yeah hacking the</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="3.18">government hacks yada yada but now we</text>
  <text start="328.979" dur="3.631">have the nitty-gritty now we have the</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="3.93">specifics of it so people can wake up</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="4.32">that might not have believed at first be</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="4.38">like oh wow right the CIA does all this</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.07">nasty stuff and then they&amp;#39;ll be more apt</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="6.45">to listen to larger disclosures and</text>
  <text start="342" dur="4.979">won&amp;#39;t be so shocked so I think with</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="2.94">these vault seven disclosures they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.979" dur="3.601">getting a lot of the roadblocks out of</text>
  <text start="348.57" dur="3.93">the way they&amp;#39;re getting the CIA out of</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="3.72">the way they&amp;#39;re getting a lot of the</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="4.91">lesser disclosures out of the way to</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.61">acclimate our consciousness with to then</text>
  <text start="357.41" dur="4">blow some things out of the water so I</text>
  <text start="359.91" dur="3.45">think within the next couple weeks we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="5.879">gonna see a lot larger disclosures and a</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="6.059">lot larger I mean hopefully it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="367.289" dur="6">a hopefully we keep saying but hopefully</text>
  <text start="369.419" dur="6.721">some pieces will start to fall some</text>
  <text start="373.289" dur="4.231">pieces being politicians thrown in jail</text>
  <text start="376.14" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s exactly what I mean by that so</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="5.19">anyway that&amp;#39;s a quick vault 7 update</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="3.54">guys and I&amp;#39;ll keep I&amp;#39;ll scan through</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="3.12">these documents see what I can find and</text>
  <text start="384" dur="3.36">keep updating you so thank you all for</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="4.649">your support sharing this information</text>
