  <text start="305.159" dur="4.861">totally gonna document I was thinking of</text>
  <text start="307.02" dur="5.04">doing it on you know just doing it for</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="6.09">myself not telling anybody about it but</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="6.829">I feel that there needs to be much much</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="6.119">more of a balanced dialogue about</text>
  <text start="318.889" dur="7.15">hallucinogenic natural spiritual</text>
  <text start="322.229" dur="5.881">remedies per se I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve done magic</text>
  <text start="326.039" dur="4.59">mushrooms psilocybin a handful of times</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="5.85">you know maybe four or five times I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="330.629" dur="6.061">never done LSD I&amp;#39;ve never done DMT in my</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="4.29">opinion you know you don&amp;#39;t really want</text>
  <text start="336.69" dur="4.92">to be messing with those realms if</text>
  <text start="338.25" dur="5.219">you&amp;#39;re not ready because these these</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="3.299">things mother nature offers us I mean</text>
  <text start="343.469" dur="3.57">they blast you off they blast you off</text>
  <text start="344.909" dur="4.56">into a whole new densities and</text>
  <text start="347.039" dur="5.18">dimensions of whatnot so I&amp;#39;ve really</text>
  <text start="349.469" dur="5.88">only stucked to psilocybin a few times</text>
  <text start="352.219" dur="5.111">fantastic stuff you know I&amp;#39;ve only done</text>
  <text start="355.349" dur="4.651">it about once a year just to really</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="5.94">cleanse yourself get a good squeegee to</text>
  <text start="360" dur="6.509">your pineal gland or whatnot but I do</text>
  <text start="363.27" dur="6.119">you know like I said no no desire to try</text>
  <text start="366.509" dur="5.13">LSD no desire to try DMT in my opinion</text>
  <text start="369.389" dur="4.231">the goal should be to get your own</text>
  <text start="371.639" dur="3.45">endogenous production of DMT right</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="3.53">through meditation through healthy</text>
  <text start="375.089" dur="4.561">practice through grounding and balancing</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="3.759">so I&amp;#39;ve never wanted to do it you know I</text>
  <text start="379.65" dur="4.019">feel like everybody should just try to</text>
  <text start="380.909" dur="4.551">be getting their own out but ayahuasca</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="3.601">is one of those that I do want to try so</text>

  <text start="511.389" dur="7.471">days where nothing happens but something</text>
  <text start="514.539" dur="7.081">I reject us you know who knows but what</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="5.099">do I have to say about the overall human</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="6.54">consciousness being evolved in the</text>
  <text start="523.959" dur="6.391">negative aspect I don&amp;#39;t you know in the</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="4.22">negative aspect I don&amp;#39;t really get that</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="5.4">because</text>
  <text start="532.38" dur="4.78">maybe rephrase your question because you</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="3.449">know nothing is really inherently</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="4.34">negative or positive it&amp;#39;s how you looked</text>
  <text start="539.199" dur="5.94">at it it&amp;#39;s your perspective and you know</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="6.91">like a gun for instance a gun can</text>
  <text start="545.139" dur="5.911">protect you or it can you know do very</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="4.83">bad harm so I don&amp;#39;t know nothing is</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="5.159">really inherently negative you can look</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="5.099">at very negative negative situations</text>
  <text start="556.209" dur="3.57">with a very positive light and gain a</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="4.041">lot of insight you know a lot of wisdom</text>
  <text start="559.779" dur="5.43">from it so yeah I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="4.42">duality world exactly you you need a</text>
  <text start="565.209" dur="2.61">light you need a dark and that&amp;#39;s what a</text>
  <text start="566.8" dur="4.469">lot of people are beginning to realize</text>
  <text start="567.819" dur="5.101">as you do is both is required if you</text>
  <text start="571.269" dur="4.5">know you can&amp;#39;t understand what light is</text>
  <text start="572.92" dur="5.669">without darkness so is darkness really</text>
  <text start="575.769" dur="6.031">negative uh you know that all depends</text>
