  <text start="0.03" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s going on guys may 17th here and I</text>
  <text start="2.76" dur="3.51">want to film a video really quick that</text>
  <text start="4.41" dur="3.899">I&amp;#39;m gonna call Colts of Corey and the</text>
  <text start="6.27" dur="3.57">reason I&amp;#39;m filming this video is because</text>
  <text start="8.309" dur="6.091">I&amp;#39;m seeing so much misinformation</text>
  <text start="9.84" dur="5.94">disinformation ego talking and</text>
  <text start="14.4" dur="2.879">people just acting a fool</text>
  <text start="15.78" dur="3.78">everywhere on both ends of the spectrum</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="3.991">so this video is really gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="19.56" dur="3.719">leave nobody out again it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="21.27" dur="5.37">pretty general but hey if the shoe fits</text>
  <text start="23.279" dur="7.441">wear it and I&amp;#39;m simply going to give you</text>
  <text start="26.64" dur="7.53">my opinions on Corey good my opinions on</text>
  <text start="30.72" dur="5.64">each one of these camps and what I think</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="5.459">they can do to improve and the tools</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="5.01">that I simply used to try to discern as</text>
  <text start="39.629" dur="3.031">best I can with F is really going on</text>
  <text start="41.37" dur="2.73">here because that&amp;#39;s really like all I</text>
  <text start="42.66" dur="4.32">can do in these videos is just offer you</text>
  <text start="44.1" dur="6.9">my experience my understanding and my</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="7.29">knowledge base so first of all what do I</text>
  <text start="51" dur="4.949">think of Corey good yes I do resonate</text>
  <text start="54.27" dur="3.12">with his message I&amp;#39;ve been listening to</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="3.691">him for a couple years now since he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="57.39" dur="3.719">come out and he&amp;#39;s really confirmed and</text>
  <text start="59.64" dur="4.169">connected a lot of dots of what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="61.109" dur="5.161">been studying for 3-4 years previous to</text>
  <text start="63.809" dur="5.221">him coming out so yes I mean that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="66.27" dur="3.24">I will be working with him but here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="3.74">the kicker</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="6.69">I don&amp;#39;t place him on a pedestal I</text>
  <text start="72.77" dur="7.3">understand that he&amp;#39;s human he has his</text>
  <text start="76.2" dur="5.37">drawbacks and has his roadblocks in his</text>
  <text start="80.07" dur="3.75">life just like we all do and I</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="4.68">understand that all he wants is to love</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="5.49">and be loved that&amp;#39;s what I feel from him</text>
  <text start="86.25" dur="5.25">so what I think&amp;#39;s going on is there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="3.239">much division divide and conquer and</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="2.13">people are just literally shooting</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="2.761">themselves in the foot without even</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="3">realizing it and then so many people are</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="4.05">gravitating towards these two ends of</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="4.41">the spectrum and then we have for</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="3.27">instance the haters they&amp;#39;ll talk some</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="3.329"> and catalyze the obsessors which</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="2.94">will then attach which are then</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="3.451">catalyzed these guys and it&amp;#39;s like this</text>
  <text start="105.57" dur="5.64">back and forth game and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="5.159">nonsense so war the first quote I want</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="3.96">to offer you guys I&amp;#39;m gonna quote a lot</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="4.261">in this video outside just threw a bunch</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="3.96">of stuff on this board thinking is</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="3.78">difficult that&amp;#39;s why most people judge</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="3.66">and again both of these guys are</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="3.989">judging&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve been hearing so much</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="4.35">stuff from like these guys spewing Oh</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="4.2">mind control or disinformation yeah yada</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.75">that it&amp;#39;s like you know they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="129.209" dur="4.291">have first second or sometimes even</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="3.9">third hand knowledge of what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="2.7">and they&amp;#39;re saying all this stuff as</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s fact and I&amp;#39;m like oh my god I feel</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="3.93">like in some high school drama class and</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="5.49">then these guys over here the obsessors</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="4.92">I worry about them they&amp;#39;re like these</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="2.64">are the people that are over here just</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="2.73">saying save us you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="6.24">attaching onto every single thing he</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="5.88">says as some or I should say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.55" dur="3.99">attaching onto him as being some</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="4.86">omniscient being and it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="4.14">from such a victimized mindset and I</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="4.77">understand this one because you know I</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="3.84">was kind of there in the first steps of</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="2.88">my truth-seeking journey I&amp;#39;m like oh</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="4.08">save me and Azara save me prosperity</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="5.01">funds but you can&amp;#39;t do that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="4.2">you know that&amp;#39;s completely ass-backwards</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="4.8">of what we&amp;#39;re on this planet to learn</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="4.26">right now so a bad thing both both ends</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="3.42">of the spectrum and really concerned</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="4.26">beyond here because one example I should</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.48">say if this end of the spectrum is some</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="6.72">group on Facebook it had a poll where</text>
  <text start="184.88" dur="5.17">people were saying you know if you</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="3.419">essentially said if you could go to the</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="3.54">Inner Earth and meet with all these</text>
  <text start="191.459" dur="3.75">beings or leave the surface of the</text>
  <text start="193.59" dur="2.88">planet would you in like 30 40 percent</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="2.881">that people would believe we&amp;#39;re like yep</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="4.62">I would pack my bags right now and dip</text>
  <text start="198.09" dur="6.72">on this pole and I&amp;#39;m like dude no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="6.119">that&amp;#39;s scary stuff so that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="3.45">really do giving it up and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="3.421">this video is gonna leave nobody out</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="3.63">because there&amp;#39;s so much better thinking</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="4.74">we could do again because thinking is</text>
  <text start="211.89" dur="5.61">difficult and you can&amp;#39;t judge him badly</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="3.57">or you can&amp;#39;t judge what he&amp;#39;s saying in a</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="3.36">negative light I mean you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="5.579">understand you can&amp;#39;t also attach on to</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="6.83">it so I wrote right here also in green</text>
  <text start="224.519" dur="5.611">my little color color coding here</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="4.03">tyrants and weaklings because you know I</text>
  <text start="230.13" dur="3.63">just quoted Carl Jung here so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.72" dur="4.17">sprinkle it a little more young on him</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="4.41">but these I wrote these words because it</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="3.81">discusses archetypes and it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="3.75">really helpful form of psychoanalysis</text>
  <text start="239.7" dur="3.84">that I&amp;#39;ve been studying a lot recently</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s studying a lot of young and</text>
  <text start="243.54" dur="4.949">Campbell and whatnot but Carl Jung deals</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="3.96">with the use of archetypes to help</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="5.371">understand our psyche and one of those</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="7.08">archetypes is the king king archetype</text>
  <text start="253.86" dur="6.21">and this one when you have an imbalanced</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="3.99">King energy within you it can manifest</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="3.599">as one of two ways it&amp;#39;ll manifest as a</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="3.36">tyrant when it&amp;#39;s over developed or it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="263.669" dur="2.5">manifest as a weekly when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="4.329">underdeveloped so</text>
  <text start="266.169" dur="5.4">the tyrants they&amp;#39;re the ones when their</text>
  <text start="269.439" dur="4.081">ego gets really concerned because they</text>
  <text start="271.569" dur="5.25">feel like their control is slipping</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="4.35">their Dominion right is going away and I</text>
  <text start="276.819" dur="3.241">think all the guys over here that are</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="5.909">screamin disinfo and in mine control</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re just concerned because it&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="283.779" dur="4.35">feel jealousy that&amp;#39;s kind of what I feel</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="3.779">but they&amp;#39;re just concerned that they</text>
  <text start="288.129" dur="2.88">might be wrong their egos getting</text>
  <text start="289.389" dur="3.99">checked and then these guys over here</text>
  <text start="291.009" dur="4.891">the obsessors which I mean ironically</text>
  <text start="293.379" dur="4.861">all of these guys Corey&amp;#39;s been like no</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="3.629">dude don&amp;#39;t write don&amp;#39;t think of me with</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="3.63">that cult mentality he&amp;#39;s literally</text>
  <text start="299.529" dur="5.19">saying that but people were like so</text>
  <text start="301.87" dur="4.5">damaged as a society and we&amp;#39;ve been all</text>
  <text start="304.719" dur="3.331">living with such a victimized mindset</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="3.569">that people they don&amp;#39;t even realize that</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="4.139">they&amp;#39;re attaching onto his words and and</text>
  <text start="309.939" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re like they&amp;#39;re the weaklings okay</text>
  <text start="312.189" dur="3.241">when when you don&amp;#39;t have enough of that</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="3">king energy within you it&amp;#39;ll manifest as</text>
  <text start="315.43" dur="3.509">the weakling and they&amp;#39;re the ones that</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="4.41">always try to push their power onto</text>
  <text start="318.939" dur="3.66">other people right when you have a weak</text>
  <text start="320.949" dur="2.52">King just think of like stories and</text>
  <text start="322.599" dur="2.04">movies and you have a weak King they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.469" dur="5.611">always trying to push the power on other</text>
  <text start="324.639" dur="6.24">people so it&amp;#39;s that victimized mindset</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="3.839">that so many people live from they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="330.879" dur="4.44">even realize it so we have to stop doing</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="4.8">that and then I honestly think a lot of</text>
  <text start="335.319" dur="6.59">these people over here on the disinfo</text>
  <text start="337.719" dur="6.72">camp it&amp;#39;s not that they don&amp;#39;t like Cory</text>
  <text start="341.909" dur="4.841">it&amp;#39;s that they don&amp;#39;t realize they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.439" dur="4.53">like these guys and then they equate</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="3.99">that to Cory and then that catalyzes</text>
  <text start="348.969" dur="3.271">them without realizing that they have to</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="4.44">separate the two here so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="9.78">that&amp;#39;s just some observation that I see</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="10.979">anyway that what up kitty down though so</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="5.549">anyway that&amp;#39;s just like some little Carl</text>
  <text start="366.159" dur="4.171">young that I wanted to sprinkle in there</text>
  <text start="367.569" dur="5.52">for you guys so I want to get now into</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="4.859">the tools the tools that I use to really</text>
  <text start="373.089" dur="4.14">help discern what&amp;#39;s going on and first</text>
  <text start="375.189" dur="3.78">of all is absolute versus relative truth</text>
  <text start="377.229" dur="3.72">and I threw this one in there because</text>
  <text start="378.969" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;ve been reading the Cavalli and lately</text>
  <text start="380.949" dur="5.511">as well so lots of good lots of good</text>
  <text start="384.879" dur="4.951">knowledge and their deep hermetic wisdom</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="4.629">so what this was essentially saying a</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="2.73">part of this book that I really</text>
  <text start="391.089" dur="2.911">resonated with is there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="5.13">difference between absolute and relative</text>
  <text start="394" dur="5.129">truth absolute truth is I mean literally</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="2.279">the only way you can describe it as by</text>
  <text start="399.129" dur="3.42">saying that</text>
  <text start="399.969" dur="5.73">that is there&amp;#39;s I mean just it is what</text>
  <text start="402.549" dur="4.86">it is you can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t change that</text>
  <text start="405.699" dur="2.7">you have to I wrote this quote over here</text>
  <text start="407.409" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;m gonna quote the crap out of this</text>
  <text start="408.399" dur="5.22">video you have to bend to it&amp;#39;s you have</text>
  <text start="411.369" dur="4.8">to bend to true swill or live a lie I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="413.619" dur="3.63">kind of paraphrasing that one but that</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="3.54">is really the truth is the truth you</text>
  <text start="417.249" dur="4.74">have to bend to his will or lie and this</text>
  <text start="419.709" dur="5.22">is a hundred percent this is what it is</text>
  <text start="421.989" dur="7.14">now what is the relative truth the</text>
  <text start="424.929" dur="5.73">relative truth is essentially its each</text>
  <text start="429.129" dur="5.07">one of our own individual perspectives</text>
  <text start="430.659" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s what I see you see it&amp;#39;s what Cory</text>
  <text start="434.199" dur="4.65">good experiences have shown him it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.419" dur="4.59">what he sees right and it&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="438.849" dur="5.16">for everybody perspective is everything</text>
  <text start="441.009" dur="5.7">and like I said earlier you can&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="444.009" dur="4.59">him on some magic pedestal and think he</text>
  <text start="446.709" dur="4.05">you know knows all this stuff that he</text>
  <text start="448.599" dur="4.32">might not because this the absolute</text>
  <text start="450.759" dur="4.38">truth that&amp;#39;s pretty freakin tough to</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="3.45">come by you&amp;#39;re never I don&amp;#39;t care who</text>
  <text start="455.139" dur="3.33">you are you&amp;#39;re never gonna have a</text>
  <text start="456.369" dur="3.39">hundred percent understanding of every</text>
  <text start="458.469" dur="3.42">single little thing that&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="459.759" dur="4.2">the goal of the name of the game the</text>
  <text start="461.889" dur="4.71">goal here is to take our relative truths</text>
  <text start="463.959" dur="4.71">and try to get as close as we can to</text>
  <text start="466.599" dur="3.72">this one but what&amp;#39;s going on is both</text>
  <text start="468.669" dur="6.21">camps haters and obsessors they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.319" dur="6.45">seeing him as having so much of this but</text>
  <text start="474.879" dur="3.57">he doesn&amp;#39;t so we have to stop doing that</text>
  <text start="476.769" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s like I said shooting ourselves in</text>
  <text start="478.449" dur="4.29">the foot understand that he has this but</text>
  <text start="480.909" dur="5.701">you can you can use that you can take</text>
  <text start="482.739" dur="6.03">that and distill it to help you with</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="3.989">your own relative truths so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="488.769" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s a crucial understanding no one is</text>
  <text start="490.599" dur="5.4">absolute and this this deals with is</text>
  <text start="493.779" dur="4.44">then segues into the types of evidence</text>
  <text start="495.999" dur="5.73">okay because you have to understand</text>
  <text start="498.219" dur="5.91">everybody&amp;#39;s relative truth is formulated</text>
  <text start="501.729" dur="3.87">upon different experiences different</text>
  <text start="504.129" dur="6">knowledge and different evidence they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="505.599" dur="5.85">acquired that they&amp;#39;ve let into there let</text>
  <text start="510.129" dur="3.69">into their lives let into their brains</text>
  <text start="511.449" dur="3.93">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of different types of</text>
  <text start="513.819" dur="3.21">evidence there&amp;#39;s physical evidence</text>
  <text start="515.379" dur="4.621">scientific evidence testimonial</text>
  <text start="517.029" dur="6.42">circumstantial lots of different kinds</text>
  <text start="520" dur="5.25">of evidence okay and what a lot of</text>
  <text start="523.449" dur="3.841">people do is they don&amp;#39;t realize there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="525.25" dur="2.97">a lot of different types of evidence so</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="2.75">because they don&amp;#39;t want to do the</text>
  <text start="528.22" dur="5.34">difficult stuff and then they just start</text>
  <text start="530.04" dur="5.29">doing things like throwing the baby out</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="3.96">with bathwater and there&amp;#39;s not thinking</text>
  <text start="535.33" dur="3.54">hard enough that to dissect what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="3.54">really going on so you have to</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="2.97">understand Cory good is not a journalist</text>
  <text start="541.06" dur="3.81">okay</text>
  <text start="541.84" dur="5.189">he&amp;#39;s only he only has a couple types of</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="4.08">evidence he has testimonial evidence and</text>
  <text start="547.029" dur="3.541">that leads us into a lot of</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="3.63">circumstantial evidence which is why I</text>
  <text start="550.57" dur="4.41">resonate with a lot of stuff okay</text>
  <text start="552.58" dur="4.62">he doesn&amp;#39;t have things like physical</text>
  <text start="554.98" dur="4.47">evidence or scientific evidence okay</text>
  <text start="557.2" dur="5.67">again we can&amp;#39;t make him to be something</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="5.85">that he isn&amp;#39;t so that needs to be</text>
  <text start="562.87" dur="4.469">understood when taking his relative</text>
  <text start="565.3" dur="4.11">truths into the picture I do a lot more</text>
  <text start="567.339" dur="4.081">journalistic stuff with my videos in my</text>
  <text start="569.41" dur="3.54">youtube channel so I try to I try to</text>
  <text start="571.42" dur="3.9">throw in a lot of scientific evidence I</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="3.99">try to take the testimony on</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="5.61">circumstantial evidence and connect a</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="5.22">lot of dots and you know not in regards</text>
  <text start="580.93" dur="3.06">to obviously secret space program stuff</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="3.54">but in other videos I show evidence of</text>
  <text start="583.99" dur="5.94">you know whatever I might have on hand</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="9.75">so that needs to be understood okay</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="7.02">and when you realize that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="3.51">different types of evidence you then</text>
  <text start="596.95" dur="3.72">come down into okay how do I discern</text>
  <text start="598.96" dur="3.44">that how do I distill these different</text>
  <text start="600.67" dur="3.72">types of evidence and that leads us into</text>
  <text start="602.4" dur="4.9">something that I like to talk about</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="4.98">quite a bit and just ponder is another</text>
  <text start="607.3" dur="4.92">beautiful manifestation of that yin-yang</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="4.32">law of polarity concept is left and</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="2.91">right brain right well then we have a</text>
  <text start="613.69" dur="2.85">left brain and right brain we have one</text>
  <text start="615.13" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s logical one this holistic one is</text>
  <text start="616.54" dur="6.78">compartmentalized and one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.85" dur="7.8">holistic and intuitive in nature so most</text>
  <text start="623.32" dur="4.59">people in society these days are living</text>
  <text start="626.65" dur="2.55">right here they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="627.91" dur="3.15">compartmentalize mindset primarily</text>
  <text start="629.2" dur="4.02">because of academia and that&amp;#39;s how our</text>
  <text start="631.06" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s how the systems have been built</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="4.38">because it&amp;#39;s very easy to push false</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="5.19">agendas upon people that are simply</text>
  <text start="637.6" dur="4.98">living from a left brain mindset and you</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="2.81">got to understand that we need to bring</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="6.66">the right brain back into the picture</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="8.29">okay now the right brain is the dock</text>
  <text start="649.24" dur="5.19">connector brain but a very important</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="4.47">point to note here is that when you</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="4.47">bring your right brain back in the</text>
  <text start="656.86" dur="4.2">picture and really try to use your gut</text>
  <text start="658.9" dur="3.6">instinct with information your gut</text>
  <text start="661.06" dur="5.58">instinct is always going to be</text>
  <text start="662.5" dur="5.1">predicated upon your experience okay so</text>
  <text start="666.64" dur="4.259">for instance you</text>
  <text start="667.6" dur="4.71">somebody that is for or is for and</text>
  <text start="670.899" dur="2.821">against vaccines the one that is for</text>
  <text start="672.31" dur="3.329">vaccines they&amp;#39;re gone extinct so</text>
  <text start="673.72" dur="3.39">probably be for vaccines if they&amp;#39;ve grew</text>
  <text start="675.639" dur="4.56">if they&amp;#39;ve grown up in that environment</text>
  <text start="677.11" dur="4.62">their whole lives so what we have to do</text>
  <text start="680.199" dur="4.56">is stop living from that fear-based</text>
  <text start="681.73" dur="4.169">mindset stop living from thinking oh my</text>
  <text start="684.759" dur="4.32">gosh my egos gonna be checked I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="685.899" dur="4.56">be wrong or oh my gosh right I I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="689.079" dur="3.541">think of any other scenarios in my head</text>
  <text start="690.459" dur="4.11">or or what if I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="692.62" dur="3.81">to have to do my own research and</text>
  <text start="694.569" dur="4.411">connect my own dots and stuff because I</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="4.5">just want what I read to be right so we</text>
  <text start="698.98" dur="7.46">have to get out of our ego get out of</text>
  <text start="700.93" dur="9.3">the fear I should say and connect dots</text>
  <text start="706.44" dur="5.23">holistically with all information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="2.94">why I wrote down here the edge the mark</text>
  <text start="711.67" dur="2.729">of an educated mind is to entertain a</text>
  <text start="713.17" dur="3.63">thought without accepting it</text>
  <text start="714.399" dur="5.221">good old Greek philosophize errs right</text>
  <text start="716.8" dur="4.32">there that&amp;#39;s very that ties in to what</text>
  <text start="719.62" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;m saying because you have to</text>
  <text start="721.12" dur="5.1">holistically think from every Avenue</text>
  <text start="723.85" dur="6.239">okay when I log on to the internet and I</text>

  <text start="743.74" dur="4.349">so these guys when they&amp;#39;re bickering</text>

  <text start="748.089" dur="3.24">assume the other side is and we</text>
  <text start="749.649" dur="4.92">can&amp;#39;t do that so you have to</text>

  <text start="833.14" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t do that as well you have to take</text>
  <text start="834.61" dur="5.34">all the pieces into the truth puzzle</text>
  <text start="837.37" dur="5.61">okay and then cut it out as you see fit</text>
  <text start="839.95" dur="4.59">we accept what is useful reject what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="842.98" dur="5.52">useless and add what&amp;#39;s uniquely your own</text>

  <text start="848.5" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s kind of all I wanted to offer to</text>
  <text start="850.63" dur="4.74">you guys before I get more ranting and</text>
  <text start="852.31" dur="4.68">tangential here but essentially yes I do</text>
  <text start="855.37" dur="3.96">resonate with Corey&amp;#39;s message but I</text>
  <text start="856.99" dur="5.13">understand that he&amp;#39;s human I understand</text>
  <text start="859.33" dur="4.41">that he doesn&amp;#39;t have all the answers but</text>
  <text start="862.12" dur="5.61">what he is doing is connecting a lot of</text>
  <text start="863.74" dur="6.69">dots and it&amp;#39;s uh then I am resonating</text>
  <text start="867.73" dur="4.02">with that but I understand that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="870.43" dur="3.33">a lot of different types of evidence he</text>
  <text start="871.75" dur="5.82">only has a couple right I don&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="873.76" dur="5.64">there i researching a lot of things past</text>
  <text start="877.57" dur="3.54">that that you know the avenues that i</text>
  <text start="879.4" dur="6.69">haven&amp;#39;t seen that he&amp;#39;s opening up for me</text>
  <text start="881.11" dur="6.21">and i don&amp;#39;t obsess over him but i don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="886.09" dur="2.67">hate him when he&amp;#39;s wrong i don&amp;#39;t hate</text>
  <text start="887.32" dur="3.36">people when they&amp;#39;re wrong i got okay</text>
  <text start="888.76" dur="3.3">okay now that you know diverts my path a</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="4.71">little bit but I understand that I am in</text>
  <text start="892.06" dur="5.22">a path and I have to do it myself</text>
  <text start="895.39" dur="4.68">right we all have to do our own thinking</text>
  <text start="897.28" dur="4.56">we can&amp;#39;t be judging so and there&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="900.07" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s very good reasons as well that I</text>
  <text start="901.84" dur="3.54">didn&amp;#39;t get into here that he might not</text>
  <text start="903.94" dur="2.97">be showing us physical information cuz</text>
  <text start="905.38" dur="5.22">again like I said his path is different</text>
  <text start="906.91" dur="6.84">than ours he if if he has been in these</text>
  <text start="910.6" dur="5.07">super spaced projects then obvious he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="913.75" dur="6.09">not gonna have physical evidence that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="915.67" dur="7.92">huh of a lot of stuff but also being in</text>
  <text start="919.84" dur="9.51">contact with higher beings almost a</text>
  <text start="923.59" dur="7.56">higher hierarchy but I want to say knows</text>
  <text start="929.35" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m more evolved being different a</text>
  <text start="931.15" dur="1.93">different race that&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s just say</text>
  <text start="932.83" dur="2.05">that</text>
  <text start="933.08" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s in contact with a different race</text>
  <text start="934.88" dur="4.47">then they may not want to break the laws</text>
  <text start="938.09" dur="2.7">of free will and give us physical</text>
  <text start="939.35" dur="3.24">evidence but I see some people say fine</text>
  <text start="940.79" dur="4.35">isn&amp;#39;t he show pictures I&amp;#39;m like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="942.59" dur="4.5">kinda defeating the purpose here right</text>
  <text start="945.14" dur="4.26">the purpose here is to have free will</text>
  <text start="947.09" dur="5.37">and come to a lot of truths on our on</text>
  <text start="949.4" dur="5.61">our own so I mean let&amp;#39;s be real as some</text>
  <text start="952.46" dur="3.93">like different beings were to appear in</text>
  <text start="955.01" dur="3.27">front of me I would have a lot different</text>
  <text start="956.39" dur="3.87">response than him because I&amp;#39;m on a</text>
  <text start="958.28" dur="3.33">different path than he is so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="960.26" dur="3.09">reasons there&amp;#39;s reasons he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="961.61" dur="4.56">different kinds of evidence that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="963.35" dur="5.15">want to throw in there but anyway I hope</text>
  <text start="966.17" dur="6.78">that helps right I hope that we can</text>
  <text start="968.5" dur="6.73">entertain all aspects with no cognitive</text>
  <text start="972.95" dur="3.96">dissonance with no ego and all just come</text>
  <text start="975.23" dur="4.08">together to find out what the truth is</text>
  <text start="976.91" dur="6.3">and then lastly I do want to throw this</text>
  <text start="979.31" dur="5.97">one in there just for the haters because</text>
  <text start="983.21" dur="3.78">let&amp;#39;s be real I&amp;#39;m all for talking</text>
  <text start="985.28" dur="6.33">and calling out the disinformation but</text>
  <text start="986.99" dur="6.15">you have to you have to have evidence</text>
  <text start="991.61" dur="3.45">right I see a lot of people claiming</text>
  <text start="993.14" dur="4.11">mind-control and it&amp;#39;s like okay prove it</text>
  <text start="995.06" dur="4.35">into you have to offer a better</text>
  <text start="997.25" dur="4.29">alternative so let&amp;#39;s be real I mean if</text>
  <text start="999.41" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re not saying yeah okay like for</text>
  <text start="1001.54" dur="3.3">instance if I&amp;#39;m calling out the</text>
  <text start="1002.65" dur="3.99">mainstream media or some conventional</text>
  <text start="1004.84" dur="3.63">science for some dumb stuff I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="1006.64" dur="2.99">like this is what I think this is what I</text>
  <text start="1008.47" dur="3.33">feel is much better</text>
  <text start="1009.63" dur="4.42">people are gonna gravitate towards your</text>
  <text start="1011.8" dur="4.83">calling out of this information if you</text>
  <text start="1014.05" dur="4.02">offer good information so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1016.63" dur="5.58">saying that for a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="1018.07" dur="5.82">calling mind control top you got to</text>
  <text start="1022.21" dur="5.07">back up your but you also have to</text>
  <text start="1023.89" dur="7.65">offer good in place of it so anyway</text>
  <text start="1027.28" dur="7.59">this quote here accuse those against you</text>
  <text start="1031.54" dur="3.78">of that which you are guilty and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1034.87" dur="2.07">a big one</text>
  <text start="1035.32" dur="4.769">this if I see a bunch of people claiming</text>
  <text start="1036.94" dur="6.769">disinformation that makes me scratch my</text>
  <text start="1040.089" dur="6.87">head right whoever smelt it dealt it</text>
