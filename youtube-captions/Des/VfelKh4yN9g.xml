  <text start="8.179" dur="4.601">hey there everybody as you can tell by</text>
  <text start="10.95" dur="3.99">now my channel is being messed with</text>
  <text start="12.78" dur="4.8">heavy duty I&amp;#39;ve had multiple streams</text>
  <text start="14.94" dur="5.58">over the past few days all cut abruptly</text>
  <text start="17.58" dur="4.98">right in the middle of them and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="4.29">quite obvious that I&amp;#39;m saying some</text>
  <text start="22.56" dur="4.83">things that some people out there don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="4.5">want me to say and one of those primary</text>
  <text start="27.39" dur="4.049">topics I was discussing in one of my</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="3.769">videos that was cut this was a video on</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="4.71">Friday evening which would have been</text>
  <text start="33.079" dur="5.8">February 16th I was discussing the voice</text>
  <text start="36.149" dur="6.09">of God technology and some inform</text>
  <text start="38.879" dur="4.59">information surrounding that topic so</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="2.941">what we&amp;#39;re gonna do is I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="43.469" dur="3.09">pre-recorded this video today of course</text>
  <text start="45.18" dur="3.39">because I can&amp;#39;t necessarily note</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="3.93">livestream and I&amp;#39;m gonna run you guys</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="4.469">through some articles and some</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="3.811">information about this topic because of</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="3.09">course they don&amp;#39;t want me talking about</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="5.989">it and that&amp;#39;s exactly what I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="7.23">so I&amp;#39;m gonna talk to you about frequency</text>
  <text start="60.289" dur="6.01">brainwaves how our minds literally run</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="5.341">at specific frequencies we are beings of</text>
  <text start="66.299" dur="4.921">frequency right as Nikola Tesla said</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="4.739">secrets of the universe are in frequency</text>
  <text start="71.22" dur="3.99">energy and vibration so we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="4.531">about how we are beings of frequency and</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="4.979">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about how the deep</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="3.96">state call them what you will they have</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="3.991">technologies where they can actually</text>
  <text start="81.93" dur="4.35">implant not our conscious mind we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="4.71">aware of it but our subconscious mind</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="5.82">with certain influences and programs</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="5.72">with frequencies that is this voice of</text>
  <text start="92.1" dur="5.28">God sometimes called voice to skull</text>
  <text start="94.61" dur="6.91">technology so let&amp;#39;s get into it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="6.029">gonna cut now to the screen capture and</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="5.099">I&amp;#39;m gonna show you guys some info about</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="4.861">that alright guys so let&amp;#39;s go through</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="3.841">all the articles that I&amp;#39;ve found here</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="4.23">for you on the subject and surprisingly</text>
  <text start="110.46" dur="4.08">when I first started researching it what</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="4.35">came up was quite a few mainstream media</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="5.039">articles on it so let&amp;#39;s go through those</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="5.76">before we go through a lot more of the</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="5.371">information on it and you can see here</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="5.399">there was one by Washington Post 1 by C</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="5.399">net a couple here by Wired and some of</text>
  <text start="128.009" dur="4.141">the intriguing things was that one they</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="3.101">were all written about 12 to 13 years</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="4.57">ago</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="5.1">and posts published theirs in 2005 CNET</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="5.129">was at the end of 2007</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="6.659">same thing with wired and of 2007 and</text>
  <text start="141.849" dur="6.021">then the other one by Wired was mid 2008</text>
  <text start="145.209" dur="5.28">so all of these around the same time a</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="4.899">little over a decade ago and another</text>
  <text start="150.489" dur="4.651">thing was that the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="4.201">article and the two Wired articles were</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="6.36">all written by the same woman her name</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="6.51">was Sharon Weinberger so you know why</text>
  <text start="161.5" dur="4.53">kind of put the truth in plain sight</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="4.95">admit these things exist publish these</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="3.87">articles and why is the lot of these</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="3.51">articles being written by the same woman</text>
  <text start="169.9" dur="5.16">you know interesting questions to ponder</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="4.859">but let&amp;#39;s actually get into the content</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="2.97">and look at the narratives you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.799" dur="2.52">always good to look at the mainstream</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="5.4">narratives on what they&amp;#39;re putting out</text>
  <text start="179.319" dur="6.631">so the one by Washington Post there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="5">lot of good stuff that&amp;#39;s in this one and</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="5.009">it&amp;#39;s not necessarily pooh-poohing or</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="5.41">shunning any of these ideas it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="190.959" dur="7.171">extreme defense and Sharon Weinberger</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="7.25">goes on to write that these contractors</text>
  <text start="198.13" dur="6.03">that work with the CIA and the military</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="5.729">they get into some pretty interesting</text>
  <text start="204.16" dur="6.12">you know she&amp;#39;s calling it non-lethal</text>
  <text start="206.819" dur="6.581">technologies and they influence people</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="5.19">they actually used him on people down</text>
  <text start="213.4" dur="4.47">here she actually writes in the article</text>
  <text start="215.47" dur="4.41">that a small wiry man wearing a CIA</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="5.699">badge and a lanyard and blazing with</text>
  <text start="219.88" dur="5.88">in-q-tel was at this conference that she</text>
  <text start="223.569" dur="4.051">was reporting on and he stopped at the</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="3.93">booth paused to take a look not only</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="3.81">nodded approvingly and picked up a</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="3.449">business card before moving on you know</text>
  <text start="231.43" dur="3.809">if you&amp;#39;ve been researching any to cue it</text>
  <text start="233.139" dur="5.19">on stuff you&amp;#39;ll notice that this comes</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="5.551">up quite a bit in regards to CIA</text>
  <text start="238.329" dur="5.22">activity so it&amp;#39;s just interesting a lot</text>
  <text start="240.79" dur="5.37">of this truth a lot of these ideas and</text>
  <text start="243.549" dur="5.461">information that was put out there in</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="5.52">the open in this article and a lot of</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="5.069">these technologies are discussing how</text>
  <text start="251.68" dur="5.459">some of them can knock you down actually</text>
  <text start="254.079" dur="6.141">be like force field with electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="257.139" dur="5.311">frequencies it&amp;#39;s actually discussing how</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="4.72">these technologies are based on a</text>
  <text start="262.45" dur="4.74">technique pioneered by Nikola Tesla a</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="4.89">kind of like Tesla coils but they</text>
  <text start="267.19" dur="4.56">use electronics to direct spark streams</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="4.77">knocking people over some of these</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="6.57">talked about kind of stunned phaser</text>
  <text start="274.6" dur="6.63">weapons high-powered pepper balls and no</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="5.1">crazy counterterrorism technologies so</text>
  <text start="281.23" dur="4.08">you could just imagine these things are</text>
  <text start="283.42" dur="4.95">in existence this article was written</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="6.69">quite a while ago so what&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="288.37" dur="5.01">utilized on the American public now but</text>
  <text start="292" dur="4.17">this was you know the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="5.49">one let&amp;#39;s go into the CNET one this one</text>
  <text start="296.17" dur="5.82">here is discussing them not necessarily</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="5.25">in a militarily light but more so by</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="6.8">advertising companies how they could</text>
  <text start="304.12" dur="8.88">actually use sound vibrations and</text>
  <text start="308.79" dur="8.86">microwave frequencies to send sound into</text>
  <text start="313" dur="8.07">your head and how could be used in a of</text>
  <text start="317.65" dur="5.07">course marketing sense which yeah it</text>
  <text start="321.07" dur="3.6">could very well happen seems pretty</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="4.32">weird I wouldn&amp;#39;t want that you know</text>
  <text start="324.67" dur="4.44">bothering me all the time but this is</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="4.68">kind of showing you this stuff exists</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="4.59">and then let&amp;#39;s get to the ones by wired</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="4.56">here now remember the same woman that</text>
  <text start="333.7" dur="5.55">wrote the one by wopo really getting</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="5.1">into some of this tech wrote the same</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="3.99">ones about wired and here in this one by</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="4.8">wired which was a couple years later you</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="5.57">know and just a day after this one by</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="5.25">seen it she kind of maybe saw the</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="4.21">opportunity to discuss it again she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="4.94">talking about the voice of technology</text>
  <text start="353.02" dur="3.35">weapon returns and</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="3.869">actually look I just found here she</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="5.429">referenced her own article on the</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="6.481">subject ha but anyway she&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="365.539" dur="4.59">kind of pooh-poohing it so she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="368.15" dur="3.03">that a device that projects voices into</text>
  <text start="370.129" dur="2.97">your head to make you think God is</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="5.13">speaking to you is the military&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.099" dur="4.981">equivalent of an urban myth and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="4.56">then down here saying that I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="4.589">not does anybody think this thing will</text>
  <text start="380.87" dur="4.769">actually convince people God is speaking</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="4.891">to them could it actually even exist I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="385.639" dur="3.691">thinking not so it&amp;#39;s weird right</text>
  <text start="387.56" dur="5.12">she goes and writes this expose on all</text>
  <text start="389.33" dur="3.35">this stuff and then</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="3.91">poo-poos her own work on it it&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s like why is this narrative shifting</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="5.9">and then her next article on it which</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="5.67">was again for the wired in 2008 is</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="4.119">referencing it in a much different light</text>
  <text start="406.85" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s actually kind of taking it</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="3.78">seriously it&amp;#39;s saying the Army&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="3.18">strange web page on boys to school</text>
  <text start="411.949" dur="3.631">weapons has been removed</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="4.44">it was strange it was there and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="4.08">even stranger it&amp;#39;s gone if you google it</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;ll see the entry for boys to school</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="4.41">device but if you click on the website</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="4.11">the link is dead the entry is still</text>
  <text start="424.07" dur="5.069">available on the Federation of American</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="5.04">scientists website so yeah this just</text>
  <text start="429.139" dur="3.661">weird that her narrative is shifting</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="4.699">you know what talking points maybe is</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="5.429">she getting what four am talking points</text>
  <text start="435.729" dur="4.451">who knows but let&amp;#39;s get into a little</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="3.361">bit more of the science behind this all</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s quit bothering with what the</text>
  <text start="441.59" dur="8.01">mainstream is saying and here is the</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="7.74">army dot mil website archive that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.6" dur="4.98">referencing that was taken offline but</text>
  <text start="451.49" dur="5.91">archived so voice to scold devices</text>
  <text start="454.58" dur="4.98">definition slash scope it&amp;#39;s saying here</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s a non-lethal weapon which includes</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="6.96">a neuro electromagnetic device which</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="5.37">uses microwave transmission of sound</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="4.5">into the skull of persons or animals by</text>
  <text start="469.25" dur="3.81">way of a pulse modulated microwave</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="3.329">radiation it so it&amp;#39;s essentially just</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="4.74">sending a pulse</text>
  <text start="474.349" dur="5.311">pulsed EMF into your subconsciousness</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="4.11">that was weird lights flickering</text>
  <text start="479.66" dur="5.49">flickering there you see but anyway and</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="5.55">- it&amp;#39;s a silent sound device which can</text>
  <text start="485.15" dur="4.56">transmit sound into the skull of persons</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="6.389">or animals note the sound modulation</text>
  <text start="489.71" dur="7.2">maybe voice or audio subliminal messages</text>
  <text start="493.849" dur="4.801">one application of b2k is used as an</text>
  <text start="496.91" dur="3.84">electronic scarecrow to frighten birds</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="4.65">in the vicinity of airports but of</text>
  <text start="500.75" dur="4.44">course it goes far more sinister and</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="4.23">deeper than that check this out audio</text>
  <text start="505.19" dur="3.84">subliminal messages so it&amp;#39;s saying here</text>
  <text start="507.53" dur="4.109">it&amp;#39;s not shooting it into your</text>
  <text start="509.03" dur="5.61">consciousness you&amp;#39;re not aware of these</text>
  <text start="511.639" dur="6.811">messages or these influences coming in</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="5.67">but it&amp;#39;s on your subconscious level and</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="3.81">now let&amp;#39;s look into the weak Wikipedia</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="3.779">archive you know again it&amp;#39;s always good</text>
  <text start="522.26" dur="3.54">to look at what they&amp;#39;re saying the spin</text>
  <text start="524.089" dur="4.31">they&amp;#39;re trying to put on to it</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="5.55">but Wikipedia is calling it a microwave</text>
  <text start="528.399" dur="5.62">auditory effect that&amp;#39;s exactly what it</text>
  <text start="531.35" dur="4.829">is not consciously auditory but</text>
  <text start="534.019" dur="4.17">subconsciously and it&amp;#39;s also known as</text>
  <text start="536.179" dur="4.621">the microwave hearing effect or The Fray</text>
  <text start="538.189" dur="4.95">effect and they&amp;#39;re saying it consists of</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="5.909">audible clicks induced by pulsed</text>
  <text start="543.139" dur="5.91">microwave frequencies it in 1961 the</text>
  <text start="546.709" dur="4.92">American neuroscientist dr. Alan Frey</text>
  <text start="549.049" dur="4.23">studied this phenomenon than was the</text>
  <text start="551.629" dur="3">first to publish information on it we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="553.279" dur="5.011">talk about that a little bit more in a</text>
  <text start="554.629" dur="4.591">sec but down here conspiracy theories I</text>
  <text start="558.29" dur="2.839">like this one</text>
  <text start="559.22" dur="4.14">numerous individuals suffering from</text>
  <text start="561.129" dur="4.33">auditory hallucinations and all these</text>
  <text start="563.36" dur="4.349">things other mental illness have claimed</text>
  <text start="565.459" dur="4.32">the government agents use form of mind</text>
  <text start="567.709" dur="5.61">control technologies and referred to it</text>
  <text start="569.779" dur="5.581">as voiced - Skol or v2 k so you know and</text>
  <text start="573.319" dur="5.81">then here it mentions CIA s MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="575.36" dur="6.24">project and and the use of psychotronics</text>
  <text start="579.129" dur="5.65">so you know if wikipedia is trying to</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="8.07">call it false it&amp;#39;s real and you know why</text>
  <text start="584.779" dur="8.85">would the army have a website on it even</text>
  <text start="589.67" dur="7.139">in 2004 if it&amp;#39;s fake so let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="593.629" dur="5.58">then a little bit more truthful research</text>
  <text start="596.809" dur="4.411">on the subject I found some articles and</text>
  <text start="599.209" dur="4.92">actually some patents that we&amp;#39;ll check</text>
  <text start="601.22" dur="4.26">out and get into on it when I first</text>
  <text start="604.129" dur="4.44">started looking past the mainstream</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="5.519">stuff and found you know a couple</text>
  <text start="608.569" dur="5.82">third-party websites this one was by</text>
  <text start="610.999" dur="6.69">Oregon Oregon blasters I don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="614.389" dur="6.54">runs his websites probably uh a woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.689" dur="6.45">uh you know blog her man&amp;#39;s blog she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.929" dur="4.95">uses to get their thoughts out into the</text>
  <text start="624.139" dur="3.87">public and try to help the consciousness</text>
  <text start="625.879" dur="5.851">but this article was called the e.l.f</text>
  <text start="628.009" dur="9.24">god by Sherri Shriner and she&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="631.73" dur="7.68">really about how people are manipulated</text>
  <text start="637.249" dur="4.351">into doing things and looking at this in</text>
  <text start="639.41" dur="4.409">a very serious light this article was</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="4.319">probably published it doesn&amp;#39;t say but</text>
  <text start="643.819" dur="3.721">around the same time frame maybe ten</text>
  <text start="645.919" dur="4.621">years ago because it&amp;#39;s referencing</text>
  <text start="647.54" dur="5.19">Columbine and the DC sniper but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.54" dur="5.37">seriously saying hey these MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="652.73" dur="6.1">people are Patsy&amp;#39;s that are mind</text>
  <text start="655.91" dur="6.58">controlled and influenced and programmed</text>
  <text start="658.83" dur="5.16">to do these things so her research is</text>
  <text start="662.49" dur="4.95">good because it actually comes up with</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="5.94">quite a few patents this e.l.f</text>
  <text start="667.44" dur="4.65">technology e.l.f meaning extremely low</text>
  <text start="669.93" dur="6">frequency in the electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="672.09" dur="6.03">spectrum right there and it mimics</text>
  <text start="675.93" dur="4.11">brainwaves and we&amp;#39;ll talk about brain</text>
  <text start="678.12" dur="5.67">waves in a sec but let&amp;#39;s look at these</text>
  <text start="680.04" dur="6.42">patents so this patent here is a patent</text>
  <text start="683.79" dur="4.44">that was made in the late 80s and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.46" dur="5.25">actually called silent subliminal</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="5.22">presentation systems and this kind of</text>
  <text start="691.71" dur="4.05">scientifically describes exactly what I</text>
  <text start="693.45" dur="5.13">was saying how microwaved frequencies</text>
  <text start="695.76" dur="5.79">can be pulsed into our minds this one</text>
  <text start="698.58" dur="5.55">here apparatus and method for remotely</text>
  <text start="701.55" dur="4.98">monitoring and altering brainwaves so</text>
  <text start="704.13" dur="6">they can actually influence the little</text>
  <text start="706.53" dur="7.08">literal frequencies that are produced by</text>
  <text start="710.13" dur="5.93">your brain and it regulates so you know</text>
  <text start="713.61" dur="5.61">these things do exist it&amp;#39;s not some</text>
  <text start="716.06" dur="6.25">conspiracy theory crazy paranoid subject</text>
  <text start="719.22" dur="6.21">these things are very real and let&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="722.31" dur="5.1">talk about brain waves so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="725.43" dur="5.43">little bit of good background before we</text>
  <text start="727.41" dur="6.24">move on what are brain waves well our</text>
  <text start="730.86" dur="9.15">brain waves are resonant frequencies</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="8.7">that our brains emit run on and it has</text>
  <text start="740.01" dur="4.83">different ranges in the extremely low</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="5.52">frequency range that coincide with</text>
  <text start="744.84" dur="6.87">different levels of conscious awareness</text>
  <text start="747.87" dur="6.77">so you have different levels waiting for</text>
  <text start="751.71" dur="6.89">this picture to come up here</text>
  <text start="754.64" dur="6.37">called the Beta Alpha Theta Delta and</text>
  <text start="758.6" dur="4.75">there&amp;#39;s another one called gamma range</text>
  <text start="761.01" dur="4.35">that they don&amp;#39;t have up here but in the</text>
  <text start="763.35" dur="4.65">Delta range those are very low they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="765.36" dur="4.74">associated with deep dreamless sleep and</text>
  <text start="768" dur="4.44">then you go all the way up to beta and</text>
  <text start="770.1" dur="4.26">gamma would be appear but that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="772.44" dur="5.16">high conscious snake that&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="774.36" dur="4.83">approximate 30 to 40 Hertz range not a</text>
  <text start="777.6" dur="3.42">little higher than that that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="779.19" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re hyper conscious and even you know</text>
  <text start="781.02" dur="4.14">anxious or taking in a lot of</text>
  <text start="783.63" dur="4.019">information from your environment so</text>
  <text start="785.16" dur="4.85">there&amp;#39;s a range that our brains will</text>
  <text start="787.649" dur="5.491">regulate on depending on our levels of</text>
  <text start="790.01" dur="6.61">awareness and they can actually</text>
  <text start="793.14" dur="5.97">influence that so the in the EMF</text>
  <text start="796.62" dur="6.81">spectrum they can utilize a lot of these</text>
  <text start="799.11" dur="6.69">microwaves you know higher frequencies</text>
  <text start="803.43" dur="4.65">to influence the lower frequencies they</text>
  <text start="805.8" dur="5.22">modulate them or they can in train our</text>
  <text start="808.08" dur="6.74">brain waves to certain certain states</text>
  <text start="811.02" dur="7.17">and I then found a few articles here by</text>
  <text start="814.82" dur="7.24">biblioteca Pleiades now here&amp;#39;s a quick</text>
  <text start="818.19" dur="5.67">tip if your truth searching you know any</text>
  <text start="822.06" dur="4.05">subject you you&amp;#39;re looking for for</text>
  <text start="823.86" dur="5.13">instance voice of God or could be</text>
  <text start="826.11" dur="6.65">zero-point energy or MKULTRA or whatnot</text>
  <text start="828.99" dur="7.77">just type in this website biblioteca</text>
  <text start="832.76" dur="7.12">Pleiades that word and your subject in</text>
  <text start="836.76" dur="6.75">the box and you&amp;#39;ll come up with a bunch</text>
  <text start="839.88" dur="5.16">of great articles on the subject these</text>
  <text start="843.51" dur="1.949">are the ones that I found about voice of</text>
  <text start="845.04" dur="2.43">God</text>
  <text start="845.459" dur="5.25">this one here devices that talk to the</text>
  <text start="847.47" dur="5.609">human mind total individual control</text>
  <text start="850.709" dur="4.651">technology you know it&amp;#39;s kind of like an</text>
  <text start="853.079" dur="5.521">amalgamation of articles from around the</text>
  <text start="855.36" dur="9">web that are on these subjects this one</text>
  <text start="858.6" dur="8.67">here was just a you know article from</text>
  <text start="864.36" dur="5.31">somewhere by somebody and it references</text>
  <text start="867.27" dur="3.6">a lot of good work so this website is</text>
  <text start="869.67" dur="4.95">just like I said</text>
  <text start="870.87" dur="5.909">biblioteca Pleiades is and like an</text>
  <text start="874.62" dur="4.65">amalgam Ettore website that brings in</text>
  <text start="876.779" dur="5.791">everything and let&amp;#39;s talk about these</text>
  <text start="879.27" dur="7.21">couple so new devices that talk to the</text>
  <text start="882.57" dur="5.889">human mind this one was written in 1999</text>
  <text start="886.48" dur="5.19">and then this one here is actually</text>
  <text start="888.459" dur="5.861">fairly recent 2017 this one actually</text>
  <text start="891.67" dur="4.84">gets in to</text>
  <text start="894.32" dur="3.51">this actually looking like a document</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="3.75">from the NSA admitting these</text>
  <text start="897.83" dur="4.98">technologies exist and the work of dr.</text>
  <text start="900.26" dur="7.23">Alan Frei like we mentioned where he</text>
  <text start="902.81" dur="7.05">actually would use electricity and</text>
  <text start="907.49" dur="6.41">carrier frequencies and different power</text>
  <text start="909.86" dur="5.88">levels to influence our our</text>
  <text start="913.9" dur="8.68">consciousness and then it talks a little</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="8.67">bit about bio amplification which excuse</text>
  <text start="922.58" dur="4.35">me send signals that don&amp;#39;t interfere</text>
  <text start="924.41" dur="6.18">with radio or TV appliances extremely</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="6.69">hard to detect but can influence us and</text>
  <text start="930.59" dur="4.74">then it&amp;#39;s discussing the some of the</text>
  <text start="933.62" dur="3.84">patents that I showed you guys as well</text>
  <text start="935.33" dur="3.99">so great article I&amp;#39;ll share with you</text>
  <text start="937.46" dur="4.89">below and then this one here total</text>
  <text start="939.32" dur="5.31">individual control technology so the</text>
  <text start="942.35" dur="4.02">this one is saying how there&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="944.63" dur="4.23">technology that can read your mind</text>
  <text start="946.37" dur="4.77">program your mind with thoughts and like</text>
  <text start="948.86" dur="5.19">we were saying induce emotional states</text>
  <text start="951.14" dur="5.37">in you pain hate fear making these brain</text>
  <text start="954.05" dur="4.26">waves behave a certain way and probably</text>
  <text start="956.51" dur="6.96">influence certain parts your brain and</text>
  <text start="958.31" dur="8.67">then it&amp;#39;s saying how you know discussing</text>
  <text start="963.47" dur="6.51">how they would actually know you based</text>
  <text start="966.98" dur="5.49">upon your DNA resonance so all of our</text>
  <text start="969.98" dur="3.99">DNA resonates at certain frequencies I</text>
  <text start="972.47" dur="6.03">was kind of mentioning this the other</text>
  <text start="973.97" dur="6.42">day in my video and that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="978.5" dur="3.39">reasons why the pharmaceutical system is</text>
  <text start="980.39" dur="5.37">so important because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="981.89" dur="7.56">create a database in essence and they</text>
  <text start="985.76" dur="5.4">want your DNA to be able to know you a</text>
  <text start="989.45" dur="3.45">whole lot more so and influence you with</text>
  <text start="991.16" dur="4.64">these technologies so they get your</text>
  <text start="992.9" dur="2.9">resonant frequency</text>
  <text start="1000.74" dur="5.98">still recording okay that was real weird</text>
  <text start="1004.22" dur="4.84">man my Internet&amp;#39;s doing weird things to</text>
  <text start="1006.72" dur="4.49">guys hey anyway let&amp;#39;s keep going through</text>
  <text start="1009.06" dur="2.15">this</text>
  <text start="1011.779" dur="2.97">there&amp;#39;s the bibliotheca play these</text>
  <text start="1013.069" dur="3.841">articles and again I&amp;#39;ll link those down</text>
  <text start="1014.749" dur="4.02">below and whenever you&amp;#39;re researching a</text>
  <text start="1016.91" dur="3.299">subject you want to know some more</text>
  <text start="1018.769" dur="3.951">actual truth on it</text>
  <text start="1020.209" dur="6.24">type that in with the subject and then</text>
  <text start="1022.72" dur="7.599">here&amp;#39;s a question that Corey Goode had</text>
  <text start="1026.449" dur="5.37">actually answered on the subject and it</text>
  <text start="1030.319" dur="3.24">says here can you tell us more about</text>
  <text start="1031.819" dur="4.02">this technology called the voice of God</text>
  <text start="1033.559" dur="5.49">where people hear voices in their heads</text>
  <text start="1035.839" dur="5.671">and on his website here he says yes this</text>
  <text start="1039.049" dur="4.351">technology uses bio neural interface</text>
  <text start="1041.51" dur="4.71">methods that have evolved over the</text>
  <text start="1043.4" dur="4.98">decades since it was developed and the</text>
  <text start="1046.22" dur="5.579">older ones can actually focus on an</text>
  <text start="1048.38" dur="6.06">individual in a crowd and after a</text>
  <text start="1051.799" dur="3.901">certain rage the the effect is lost but</text>
  <text start="1054.44" dur="3.84">the more recent ones can actually</text>
  <text start="1055.7" dur="5.31">influence the individual from a drone or</text>
  <text start="1058.28" dur="4.47">a satellite so that goes much in line</text>
  <text start="1061.01" dur="5.669">with what we were learning from cue in</text>
  <text start="1062.75" dur="6.929">that they use these classified satellite</text>
  <text start="1066.679" dur="4.921">technologies and mobile devices to send</text>
  <text start="1069.679" dur="5.761">that frequency much more specifically</text>
  <text start="1071.6" dur="7.829">through people and that could be how</text>
  <text start="1075.44" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re in our digital age here in our</text>
  <text start="1079.429" dur="5.191">highly technological age we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1081.83" dur="6.3">into they&amp;#39;re much more able to influence</text>
  <text start="1084.62" dur="5.61">people who are mentally ill who you know</text>
  <text start="1088.13" dur="4.019">aren&amp;#39;t whole individuals and taking care</text>
  <text start="1090.23" dur="3.99">of themselves mentally physically</text>
  <text start="1092.149" dur="3.75">spiritually emotionally they can</text>
  <text start="1094.22" dur="4.53">influence them much more so to do these</text>
  <text start="1095.899" dur="4.981">nasty things and they have much more</text>
  <text start="1098.75" dur="5.34">targeted technology and of course people</text>
  <text start="1100.88" dur="6.299">are so much more toxified and ill so</text>
  <text start="1104.09" dur="5.329">again guys that&amp;#39;s where why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1107.179" dur="5.011">important to keep yourself healthy</text>
  <text start="1109.419" dur="5.921">physically in all layers of who you are</text>
  <text start="1112.19" dur="5.88">because if you&amp;#39;re not that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="1115.34" dur="6.92">influence you they literally do and it</text>
  <text start="1118.07" dur="7.05">take you away from your higher self so</text>
  <text start="1122.26" dur="5.32">understand that guys that&amp;#39;s why I preach</text>
  <text start="1125.12" dur="5.429">on that subject and then lastly what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1127.58" dur="6.479">actually going to do is here&amp;#39;s a voice</text>
  <text start="1130.549" dur="5.88">ode of cosmic disclosure with Corey and</text>
  <text start="1134.059" dur="6.251">David Wilcock on the voice of God</text>
  <text start="1136.429" dur="8.201">technology I am going to</text>
  <text start="1140.31" dur="9.93">um make this free for 72 hours I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1144.63" dur="7.62">utilize a guest share on this and I will</text>
  <text start="1150.24" dur="3.21">post the link down the below in the</text>
  <text start="1152.25" dur="3.42">description of this video so if you want</text>
  <text start="1153.45" dur="6.06">to watch more on it</text>
  <text start="1155.67" dur="5.91">watch that half-an-hour episode I will</text>
  <text start="1159.51" dur="6.12">of course link these articles by</text>
  <text start="1161.58" dur="7.32">biblioteca Pleiades and these patents as</text>
  <text start="1165.63" dur="5.76">well so pretty crazy right these things</text>
  <text start="1168.9" dur="5.88">actually exist technologies that can</text>
  <text start="1171.39" dur="6.39">influence you send pulsed frequencies</text>
  <text start="1174.78" dur="5.25">into your subliminal thoughts and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1177.78" dur="4.47">just weird isn&amp;#39;t it and it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1180.03" dur="4.26">scary but at the same time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1182.25" dur="4.68">scary it&amp;#39;s actually empowering it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1184.29" dur="4.74">liberating because by understanding this</text>
  <text start="1186.93" dur="5.67">kind of information that you know you</text>
  <text start="1189.03" dur="4.83">have brain waves your mental state</text>
  <text start="1192.6" dur="3.81">operates in different frequencies</text>
  <text start="1193.86" dur="5.01">associated with your consciousness then</text>
  <text start="1196.41" dur="5.28">you can alter that you can change that</text>
  <text start="1198.87" dur="4.83">yourself and keep yourself in certain</text>
  <text start="1201.69" dur="4.05">states that won&amp;#39;t allow them to</text>
  <text start="1203.7" dur="4.11">influence you and also by understanding</text>
  <text start="1205.74" dur="3.99">this it&amp;#39;s extremely empowering because</text>
  <text start="1207.81" dur="5.79">then you know wow if I keep myself</text>
  <text start="1209.73" dur="5.91">healthy whole grounded if I focus on</text>
  <text start="1213.6" dur="4.2">balancing all layers of who I am</text>
  <text start="1215.64" dur="4.56">mentally emotionally physically</text>
  <text start="1217.8" dur="4.65">spiritually then again they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1220.2" dur="3.81">influence you they can&amp;#39;t mess with you</text>
  <text start="1222.45" dur="4.05">whatever they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1224.01" dur="4.88">subliminally whether it is advertising</text>
  <text start="1226.5" dur="5.82">or it is something far more sinister and</text>
  <text start="1228.89" dur="5.38">directed they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="1232.32" dur="4.11">accomplish their goals or their agendas</text>
  <text start="1234.27" dur="4.53">so that&amp;#39;s it guys I hope you enjoyed</text>
  <text start="1236.43" dur="4.68">that video on the voice of God</text>
