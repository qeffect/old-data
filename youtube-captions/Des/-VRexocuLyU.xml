  <text start="94.95" dur="4.709">media a lot of ways they divide and</text>
  <text start="97.22" dur="4.99">compartmentalize groups to conquer them</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="4.081">don&amp;#39;t fall for that game guys and now</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="4.199">let&amp;#39;s go through these dot gov websites</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="4.919">so funny enough is they deal with the</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="4.32">Hatch Act now this is something that I</text>
  <text start="108.659" dur="4.081">mentioned in a video maybe earlier this</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="3.811">week late last week I saw some people</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="3.78">out there speculating about this and it</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="4.8">made sense to me is that maybe the</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="5.73">reason Q hasn&amp;#39;t been posting laying low</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="4.47">is because of this Hatch Act right here</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="3.689">it says it limits certain political</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="4.05">activities of most executive branch</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="4.8">employees this is the first website Q</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="5.31">linked second one is a PDF describing</text>
  <text start="130.739" dur="3.121">what government employees can and cannot</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="2.67">do</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="4.83">under this Hatch Act in regards to</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="5.19">elections so on one end maybe this is</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="3.99">sort of a confirmation about why Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="3.63">laying low they don&amp;#39;t want to draw any</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="4.31">negative attention towards themselves</text>
  <text start="144.66" dur="4.95">around the time of the midterm elections</text>
  <text start="146.99" dur="5.17">because of this Hatch Act but again</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="4.77">double meanings exist on the other hand</text>
  <text start="152.16" dur="4.5">they could be posting this information</text>
  <text start="154.38" dur="4.43">about the Hatch Act to send a message to</text>

  <text start="710.139" dur="5.581">it on they said their algorithm this</text>

  <text start="725.29" dur="7.26">then they run one line that is disinfo</text>
  <text start="729.79" dur="4.71">completely confusing people so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="732.55" dur="4.14">how they marginalize these theories is a</text>
  <text start="734.5" dur="3.93">prime example right here earth is flat</text>
  <text start="736.69" dur="3.899">they throw in something crazy something</text>
  <text start="738.43" dur="4.56">nonsensical and then they throw in</text>
  <text start="740.589" dur="4.171">things like anti-vaccination in q and</text>

  <text start="747.089" dur="4.93">NPC mind out there that you could say</text>
  <text start="749.889" dur="6.861">those that are accepting the narratives</text>
  <text start="752.019" dur="8.76">given to them throw out logic is by that</text>
  <text start="756.75" dur="5.319">marginalization so be wary of that when</text>
  <text start="760.779" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;re reading all this stuff that kind</text>
  <text start="762.069" dur="4.051">of neural linguistic programming that</text>
  <text start="764.079" dur="4.351">the mainstream media and the controlled</text>
  <text start="766.12" dur="5.339">opposition plants do out there as well</text>
  <text start="768.43" dur="6.089">so that&amp;#39;s really all I have on Q we have</text>
  <text start="771.459" dur="5.07">two great Q proofs today a year ago</text>
  <text start="774.519" dur="3.901">they&amp;#39;re not done they&amp;#39;re still there</text>
  <text start="776.529" dur="4.201">watching everything happen doing so much</text>
  <text start="778.42" dur="3.69">stuff behind the scenes I&amp;#39;m sure and</text>
  <text start="780.73" dur="3.419">then last thing that I want to talk</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="4.4">about is something that people been</text>
  <text start="784.149" dur="5.041">throwing my way called initiative Q</text>
  <text start="786.51" dur="4.12">initiative Q a lot of people have been</text>
  <text start="789.19" dur="3.78">messaging it to me I&amp;#39;ve been seeing out</text>
  <text start="790.63" dur="4.949">not Twitter I finally did just a tad bit</text>
  <text start="792.97" dur="5.7">of digging into it and what I found with</text>
  <text start="795.579" dur="7.231">that initiative Q is that it actually</text>
  <text start="798.67" dur="6.75">has absolutely nothing to do with Q we</text>
  <text start="802.81" dur="4.89">q and on what it is it&amp;#39;s this like</text>
  <text start="805.42" dur="5.43">alternative currency it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="807.7" dur="6.06">cryptocurrency and it&amp;#39;s not a dollar a</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="6.72">physical medium good what it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.76" dur="6.3">this online nothing money we can call it</text>
  <text start="817.57" dur="4.8">I mean it&amp;#39;s this you can look into it</text>
  <text start="820.06" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;ll link it down below but really what</text>
  <text start="822.37" dur="4.98">it is it claims that it&amp;#39;s going to rival</text>
  <text start="824.68" dur="5.4">the dollar in ten years and be this way</text>
  <text start="827.35" dur="5.91">this value trading system that people</text>
  <text start="830.08" dur="7.02">can trade what is like a money out there</text>
  <text start="833.26" dur="6.03">and it&amp;#39;s great it&amp;#39;s gonna reduce the</text>
  <text start="837.1" dur="3.84">enormous waste caused by cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="839.29" dur="4.26">because you don&amp;#39;t have to consume energy</text>
  <text start="840.94" dur="4.26">with mining anymore and it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="843.55" dur="3.93">this global currency that call it a</text>
  <text start="845.2" dur="5.19">global currency so keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="847.48" dur="5.34">just all these things right and again</text>
  <text start="850.39" dur="4.199">has nothing to do with queuing on but at</text>
  <text start="852.82" dur="4.88">the same time okay it sounds great it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.589" dur="5.94">this what seems to be altruistic like</text>
  <text start="857.7" dur="4.57">planet-saving idea that&amp;#39;s gonna render</text>
  <text start="860.529" dur="4.441">the dollar obsolete and cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="862.27" dur="5.79">obsolete and save the biosphere and</text>
  <text start="864.97" dur="5.49">allow us to do peer-to-peer transactions</text>
  <text start="868.06" dur="4.38">and whatnot but I just find it odd I</text>
  <text start="870.46" dur="4.14">find it odd because the timing it comes</text>
  <text start="872.44" dur="4.08">up came up kind of mid this year April</text>
  <text start="874.6" dur="4.86">May June now we&amp;#39;re getting more</text>
  <text start="876.52" dur="5.49">publicity about it Forbes is talking</text>
  <text start="879.46" dur="4.71">about it they ran this article the other</text>
  <text start="882.01" dur="4.14">day actually just yesterday the</text>
  <text start="884.17" dur="4.02">initiative cue the new Bitcoin it</text>
  <text start="886.15" dur="3.93">questions and then this article goes on</text>
  <text start="888.19" dur="4.53">to kind of go into some pros and cons</text>
  <text start="890.08" dur="4.44">about it it says it sounds awesome but I</text>
  <text start="892.72" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t know but at the very end they say</text>
  <text start="894.52" dur="4.83">oh but it&amp;#39;s great why not let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="896.44" dur="6.48">sign up our name in our email to take</text>
  <text start="899.35" dur="6">part get in earning early on this queue</text>
  <text start="902.92" dur="3.99">venture okay and that&amp;#39;s all it requires</text>

  <text start="911.13" dur="3.55">so I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you all the red flags</text>
  <text start="913.24" dur="3.84">I have going off in my head right now</text>
  <text start="914.68" dur="5.849">how do they get a positive piece on</text>
  <text start="917.08" dur="7.89">Forbes you know to get any sort of</text>
  <text start="920.529" dur="9.06">positive piece on Forbes or on CNN or on</text>
  <text start="924.97" dur="6.45">vice or on wired is odd you know I was</text>
  <text start="929.589" dur="3.601">on Comedy Central they tried to roast</text>
  <text start="931.42" dur="3.14">the out of me to get a positive</text>
  <text start="933.19" dur="3.37">peace on Forbes or something like that</text>
  <text start="934.56" dur="3.86">there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a red flag</text>
  <text start="936.56" dur="4.02">right there not only that but if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="938.42" dur="4.44">called initiative queue I mean it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="940.58" dur="6.65">weird it says nothing about actual queue</text>
  <text start="942.86" dur="7.38">on this it comes up after not related</text>
  <text start="947.23" dur="6.7">but what I see is that it is sort of</text>
  <text start="950.24" dur="7.47">related so if I mean one thing this sort</text>
  <text start="953.93" dur="6.93">of does understand this is that with the</text>
  <text start="957.71" dur="5.55">quote initiative queue that word okay</text>
  <text start="960.86" dur="4.169">that association heating the mainstream</text>
  <text start="963.26" dur="3.45">collective consciousness right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="965.029" dur="3.841">going to confuse both sides of the aisle</text>
  <text start="966.71" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s gonna confuse people into queue</text>
  <text start="968.87" dur="3.48">because they&amp;#39;re gonna maybe think that</text>
  <text start="970.61" dur="4.86">it is associated so they&amp;#39;re gonna be so</text>
  <text start="972.35" dur="5.07">easy to give their data away number one</text>
  <text start="975.47" dur="3.96">it is asking for all of our data all</text>
  <text start="977.42" dur="3.6">right now and then too it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="979.43" dur="3.599">confuse people in the mainstream because</text>
  <text start="981.02" dur="3.18">when they hear of queue and on they</text>
  <text start="983.029" dur="3.031">never heard it before but maybe they</text>
  <text start="984.2" dur="3.78">have heard of initiative queue that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="986.06" dur="4.17">what they&amp;#39;re gonna so associate queue</text>
  <text start="987.98" dur="4.59">and on our queue with so you see it kind</text>
  <text start="990.23" dur="4.65">of muddies the waters on a psychological</text>
  <text start="992.57" dur="4.41">level that way and the fact it does have</text>
  <text start="994.88" dur="3.78">good pieces and Forbes I don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="996.98" dur="4.5">really invested into this apparently it</text>
  <text start="998.66" dur="4.5">was a guy and he you know all I could</text>
