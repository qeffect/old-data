  <text start="82.29" dur="5.48">subscribers on this channel says more</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="6.32">about society than it actually does me</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="6.34">because when you look at society now</text>
  <text start="91.009" dur="5.5">people are becoming so hungry for truth</text>

  <text start="96.509" dur="4.741">getting hungry for authenticity and</text>
  <text start="98.24" dur="5.589">they&amp;#39;re getting hungry for no more</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="5.52"> you know if you look at my</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="6.061">channel and if you look at actually what</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="5.279">I do I&amp;#39;m good at what I do you know I</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="5.61">put good information out there as good</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="5.481">as I can and I&amp;#39;m honest in the way I</text>
  <text start="115.5" dur="4.35">deliver it and whatnot but there are</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="4.869">independent journalists and other truth</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="6.03">is out there that are better than I am</text>
  <text start="122.399" dur="7.021">at what they do you know so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="7.14">like I am extremely amazing</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="4.47">by any means but society just wants it</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="3.18">wants the truth</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="3.87">to get out there and not only is my</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="3.48">channel gaining a bunch of subscribers</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="4.199">but there&amp;#39;s a ton of other people I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="4.11">seeing getting a huge following their</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="4.431">sub counts are growing and I&amp;#39;m super</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="5.91">happy about that it makes me so excited</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="5.86">that people are and by people I mean</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="3.99">just society in general as much as it</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="3.66">sometimes doesn&amp;#39;t seem that way but I</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="5.04">think it really is that way is that</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="5.88">society is starting to see through the</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="5.91"> you know if you look at for</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="5.52">instance a any kind of mainstream media</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="4.349">Twitter account they might have hundreds</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="3.69">of thousands or even millions of</text>
  <text start="168.989" dur="5.28">followers but they don&amp;#39;t get as many</text>
  <text start="171" dur="6.3">likes and retweets on what they post as</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="5.341">many truth shares and independent</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="5.28">journalists do on their accounts that</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="5.629">have a fraction of the followers or a</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="5.61">fraction of the subscribers right and</text>
  <text start="185.239" dur="5.711">that&amp;#39;s just exciting in and of itself</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="6.69">right there so I am super stoked to see</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="7.259">how everybody who is putting truth out</text>
  <text start="194.88" dur="5.04">there gets that recognition this year</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="3.931">not just this year but as we progress</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="4.83">into the future and I think it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="5.909">going to get more exponential and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="6.66">gonna begin to see people who don&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="208.049" dur="6">that authenticity they&amp;#39;re just not going</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="6.419">to get the same kind of I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="214.049" dur="6.451">say Fame but the same kind of positive</text>
  <text start="217.829" dur="4.651">feedback as many others do who are</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="3.299">showing that authenticity you know and</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s a word of advice right there if</text>
  <text start="223.799" dur="5.611">you are going to or if you do want to</text>
  <text start="227.82" dur="3.21">begin your own YouTube channel or your</text>

  <text start="242.13" dur="5.88">I don&amp;#39;t let it get to me if maybe the</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="4.47">video isn&amp;#39;t quite what I wanted or</text>

  <text start="260.789" dur="5.371">the division and and all the hate and</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="3.3">negativity that I&amp;#39;m seeing so many</text>

  <text start="275.55" dur="4.76">man I try to view everything as</text>
  <text start="277.8" dur="5.52">positively as I can because really even</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="5.35">anything that seems extremely negative</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="4.11">it all has positivity in it right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.66" dur="3.24">yin-yang everything that&amp;#39;s dark has</text>

  <text start="311.13" dur="5.22">surprised that that I&amp;#39;m getting this</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="5.61">kind of feedback in the subscriber count</text>
  <text start="316.35" dur="5.7">on my channel and they assume that I</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="4.05">haven&amp;#39;t done any work to get that but</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s not the case I&amp;#39;m telling you now</text>
  <text start="323.85" dur="7.23">I&amp;#39;ve spent hundreds if not thousands of</text>
  <text start="327" dur="5.7">hours studying not only studying all the</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="3.21">topics that I talk about the</text>

  <text start="340.23" dur="5.04">spread and studying public speaking</text>
  <text start="343.35" dur="4.11">actually studying people that have</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="4.44">YouTube channels you know a few years</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="4.59">ago way before I even started this or</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="6.9">envisioned starting a YouTube channel on</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="7.8">my own I would watch certain youtubers</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="5.49">and became drawn in to their</text>
  <text start="359.85" dur="5.55">presentation and I studied that I</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="7.04">studied how they would talk and outlay</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="6.9">their videos and outlay their speeches</text>
  <text start="369.14" dur="5.56">onto these videos and then onto the</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="4.2">internet you know so hard work pays off</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="3.48">and I know a lot of you have heard that</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="5.69">before everybody tells you that but</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="8.58">trust me it does be patient with it and</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="7.06">find a you know find a mentor is even if</text>
  <text start="386.76" dur="4.5">you don&amp;#39;t meet that mentor in person</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="3.33">find somebody you like on the internet</text>
  <text start="391.26" dur="3.09">that you gravitate to that you like</text>

  <text start="394.35" dur="6.45">doing and you want that and study how</text>
  <text start="397.23" dur="7.619">they got that but</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="7.53">on that same note put that knowledge</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="5.431">that you acquire into action actually do</text>

  <text start="410.28" dur="5.22">study study study read read read but</text>
  <text start="412.289" dur="6.81">they don&amp;#39;t make the jump they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="415.5" dur="7.129">the courage to just start making the</text>
  <text start="419.099" dur="7.861">videos or actually make the jump into</text>
  <text start="422.629" dur="6.551">starting their own blog or website or</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="5.269">whatever the case is and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="6.81">often times I say knowledge isn&amp;#39;t power</text>
  <text start="432.229" dur="6.25">knowledge is only potential putting that</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="5.88">knowledge into action is power actually</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="5.31">doing the damn thing is power right for</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="3.21">instance you can understand that</text>
  <text start="443.789" dur="3.87">vaccines are bad for you but if you</text>
  <text start="445.08" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t actually make the choice and take</text>
  <text start="447.659" dur="3.75">the action to not go and get the vaccine</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s not going to do you any damn good</text>
  <text start="451.409" dur="5.371">right so that&amp;#39;s a good word of advice</text>
  <text start="454.53" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t just be the person sitting on the</text>
