  <text start="36.5" dur="3.989">ago he met with Donald Trump one of the</text>
  <text start="38.629" dur="3.811">only two times this guy&amp;#39;s met with him</text>
  <text start="40.489" dur="5.28">and Donald Trump told him to go after</text>
  <text start="42.44" dur="4.349">everything in regards to prosecuting</text>
  <text start="45.769" dur="4.32">Hillary Clinton in the State Department</text>
  <text start="46.789" dur="5.79">so there&amp;#39;s some really good news there</text>
  <text start="50.089" dur="5.641">going for one of the throats essentially</text>
  <text start="52.579" dur="4.971">of the deep state which is that federal</text>
  <text start="55.73" dur="4.8">reserve it is you know the the</text>
  <text start="57.55" dur="4.75">quintessential banker hot spot is the</text>
  <text start="60.53" dur="5.58">federal the central bank of every</text>
  <text start="62.3" dur="5.429">country and this bill essentially the</text>
  <text start="66.11" dur="4.29">idea of this bill was the brainchild of</text>
  <text start="67.729" dur="4.201">none other than Ron Paul which another</text>
  <text start="70.4" dur="2.7">clot yeah let&amp;#39;s give a standing ovation</text>
  <text start="71.93" dur="2.729">to that man right there</text>
  <text start="73.1" dur="4.82">the only bumper sticker I&amp;#39;ve ever had on</text>
  <text start="74.659" dur="5.64">my car was a Ron Paul bumper sticker so</text>
  <text start="77.92" dur="6.76">this is very good news it will speed the</text>
  <text start="80.299" dur="5.85">process up of auditing the Fed and one</text>
  <text start="84.68" dur="2.759">point that a buddy of mine made to me</text>
  <text start="86.149" dur="5.341">that I just want to point out to you</text>
  <text start="87.439" dur="6.241">hopefully they certain deep state powers</text>
  <text start="91.49" dur="4.379">certain cabal banking powers don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="93.68" dur="4.56">to crash the economy before this can</text>
  <text start="95.869" dur="5.25">actually be accomplished so this is not</text>
  <text start="98.24" dur="4.35">any message to spread fear I&amp;#39;m freaking</text>
  <text start="101.119" dur="3.511">happy right now and I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="5.16">all that will happen or if it does that</text>
  <text start="104.63" dur="5.94">will be positive contingency plans in</text>
  <text start="107.75" dur="6.84">place but it&amp;#39;s just a good idea to keep</text>
  <text start="110.57" dur="6.799">any type of week or two food water you</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="5.639">know basic essentials candles on hand</text>
  <text start="117.369" dur="6.341">not only for that but many other reasons</text>
  <text start="120.229" dur="5.1">that might occur now like I said he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.71" dur="3.21">going for one of the throats of the D</text>
  <text start="125.329" dur="2.4">State with auditing the Fed what also</text>
  <text start="126.92" dur="3.809">happened today</text>
  <text start="127.729" dur="5.821">is that and a lot of people are furious</text>
  <text start="130.729" dur="5.491">over the EPA thing and what you need to</text>
  <text start="133.55" dur="5.359">understand is that it&amp;#39;s not Trump I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="4.48">not loving Trump in this video I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="138.909" dur="4.731">loving</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="6.149">evil getting exposed and evil getting</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="4.92">demolished so not only is it Trump but</text>
  <text start="146.849" dur="5.551">it&amp;#39;s a network of people that are</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="7.38">working with him and behind him to take</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="5.76">down this deep dark nasty octopus with a</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="3.48">million different tentacles or you know</text>
  <text start="158.16" dur="4.65">this giant monster with a lot of</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="5.039">different heads and they need to it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="4.41">like a master chess game to take out</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="4.801">each one of those heads and not only is</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="5.31">one of them auditing the Fed one of them</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="6.089">is the pedophilia issue which we know is</text>
  <text start="172.53" dur="5.069">getting exposed another one is the</text>
  <text start="175.349" dur="4.14">military and that&amp;#39;s a tough one because</text>
  <text start="177.599" dur="7.17">it looks like Donald Trump&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="179.489" dur="8.131">more money into the military but when</text>
  <text start="184.769" dur="4.351">you look at it what I think is occurring</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="4.41">is that that actually goes hand in hand</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="6.179">with this EPA issue and that he&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="5.97">looks like there&amp;#39;s a deregulation</text>
  <text start="195.299" dur="5.19">occurring to let alternative energy</text>
  <text start="198" dur="5.16">companies have a much easier time coming</text>
  <text start="200.489" dur="4.201">out and we know the global warming</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="2.76">schtick is a farce I&amp;#39;m gonna do I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="7.199">gonna do another video and that actually</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="7.92">I wanted to to put that to rest so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.889" dur="3.211">gonna let these alternative energy</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="4.17">companies have an easier time coming out</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="4.469">and he&amp;#39;s possibly setting up the money</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="3.479">for them by funneling more money into</text>
  <text start="219.569" dur="3.871">the military industrial you could say</text>
  <text start="221.489" dur="3.78">that complex but really the Department</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="5.879">of Defense because I think that&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="225.269" dur="6.3">the next kind of Avenue to be audited we</text>
  <text start="229.319" dur="4.111">know that there&amp;#39;s been a few reports</text>
  <text start="231.569" dur="3.991">lately I just did one where the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="4.23">has never been audited so I think with</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="4.5">auditing the Fed now that opens up the</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="7.22">added Avenue to auditing the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="4.82">and the Department of Defense which then</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="4.209">that could be hey that&amp;#39;s just a thought</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="3.72">I had what if he&amp;#39;s putting more money in</text>
  <text start="250.109" dur="3.66">the military to say hey we might want to</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="4.261">find out where this money goes and then</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="4.291">audit it there huh anyway speculate on</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="3.06">that but I just wanted to make this</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="4.47">video he&amp;#39;s gonna audit the Federal</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="4.05">Reserve and I&amp;#39;m gonna do one on that EPA</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="2.43">shoe because I know a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="3.66">pissed about that so to help explain</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="4.889">some things about why things are heating</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="4.59">up and it&amp;#39;s not really our fault but we</text>
  <text start="269.849" dur="3.961">should still very much work to keep this</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="4.49">planet clean so anyway peace out guys</text>
