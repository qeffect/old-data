  <text start="30.48" dur="9.39">person on the awakening path yes I have</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="7.25">many and the quote he means is a quote</text>
  <text start="39.87" dur="5.009">you often hear when you&amp;#39;re discussing</text>
  <text start="42.32" dur="4.45">trying to lead somebody to truth and</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="4.02">they say you know you can lead a horse</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="5.91">to water but you can&amp;#39;t make him drink it</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="6.18">and that&amp;#39;s exactly the case you can show</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="5.16">somebody truth about whatever subject</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="5.55">you can try to bring them to reality</text>
  <text start="57.84" dur="5.25">right which you cannot force them to</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="4.89">accept that reality they have to do it</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="4.26">on their own so you can lead a horse to</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="3.871">water but you can&amp;#39;t make them drink it</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="5.58">you can lead a person to the truth but</text>
  <text start="69.39" dur="5.58">you cannot make them accept it right but</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="5">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things you can do to</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="5.55">help them accept that truth which is why</text>
  <text start="77.93" dur="4.39">whenever it comes to this quote I always</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="3.27">like to add a little bit on the end you</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="4.189">can lead a horse to water but you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="83.79" dur="5.939">make him drink it but what you can do is</text>
  <text start="86.509" dur="6.04">make that water look as damn tasty as</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="4.171">you can and that&amp;#39;s exactly the case you</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="5.691">can leave when you lead somebody to</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="8.7">truth what you want to do is offer them</text>
  <text start="98.24" dur="7.08">the positivity behind accepting those</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="5.159">truths and I think that&amp;#39;s a big thing</text>
  <text start="105.32" dur="9.189">these days is that when a lot of people</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="8.581">who are awakened per se or who see the</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="5.121">realities of this world when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="7.59">trying to get people to see that as well</text>
  <text start="119.63" dur="6.16">they focus on the scary aspects or what</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="4.139">many people often think of as the</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="4.85">negative aspects of that truth right</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="5.161">they say oh you know look at all these</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="4.12">deep standards or look at this new world</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re killing us all off they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="4.17">poisoning us with vaccines and</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="4.969">chemtrails they got us by the balls with</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="4.949">the banks they right I mean of course</text>
  <text start="141.409" dur="4.421">the reality of this world is that</text>
  <text start="143.879" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s a lot of scary out there</text>
  <text start="145.83" dur="5.31">right but here&amp;#39;s the thing if you try to</text>
  <text start="148.799" dur="5.881">bring somebody that those truths that</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="6.569">reality without focusing on the positive</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="5.279">aspects of it that people acquire once</text>
  <text start="157.709" dur="4.321">they see the reality people aren&amp;#39;t gonna</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="5.221">want to accept it and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="5.069">powers that be have had such a damn good</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="3.48">control on everything because once</text>
  <text start="167.099" dur="2.881">people begin to see the reality is they</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="2.909">start shutting down they start going</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="3.81">into that fear mode and I did that I did</text>
  <text start="171.569" dur="4.29">that for a couple of years but you have</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="3.72">to the best way to get people to see</text>
  <text start="175.859" dur="4.141">realities is moving past that and saying</text>

  <text start="184.56" dur="3.84">warehouses of people that were trying to</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="4.95">liberate humanity with free energy</text>

  <text start="231.359" dur="3.69">cancer cures to humanity that&amp;#39;s scary</text>

  <text start="235.049" dur="3.81">want to hide under their beds they want</text>
  <text start="236.879" dur="3.571">to go hide under a rock because reality</text>

  <text start="240.45" dur="4.92">reality but if you make that water look</text>

  <text start="260.669" dur="3.331">you to new potentials a lot of people</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="3.47">don&amp;#39;t see those new potentials so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264" dur="4.04">how you help people</text>
  <text start="265.91" dur="4.98">see the awakening right get on that</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="4.41">awakening path is okay you have to be</text>

  <text start="272.45" dur="3.54">negative you have to say yes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="4.59">some scary stuff on this planet but</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s some amazing stuff that they</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="3.75">have held back from us so when I always</text>
  <text start="280.91" dur="3.42">try to bring people to that awakening</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="5.04">path I always try to bring them Pope</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="5.34">both bring them that negativity which it</text>
  <text start="287.42" dur="4.77">with as much positivity as you can</text>
  <text start="289.67" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s why I say you can lead a horse to</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="3.96">water you can&amp;#39;t make them drink it but</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="4.74">you can make that water look damn tasty</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="5.13">you need to make that horse realize that</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="5.4">they are thirsty as and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="5.4">you best lead somebody who is not on the</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="5.22">awakening path to get on it right to</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="4.35">want to get on that to want to see the</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="4.26">negativity on this planet because then</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;ll realize wow then I can attain my</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="3.45">own I can see what&amp;#39;s really going on I</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="5.57">can attain true freedom I can attain my</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="7.38">true potential by accepting and thus</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="7.14">transmuting those negative realities</text>
  <text start="324.47" dur="5.55">right and I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="327.91" dur="3.7">biggest thing I have to say about that</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="3.42">another thing I have to say about that</text>
  <text start="331.61" dur="3.39">path the one of the best ways to lead</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="6.87">people on to the awakening path is start</text>
  <text start="335" dur="7.11">small right I start small and then lead</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="5.34">them on to bigger truths a lot of people</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="5.52">they they try to sell the whole package</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="3.66">all at once and that&amp;#39;s way too much for</text>
  <text start="347.63" dur="4.34">somebody who&amp;#39;s not on that path quite</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="5.1">yet so you got to talk to the person and</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="6.31">find out where they&amp;#39;re coming from and</text>
  <text start="354.41" dur="6.96">then basically sell the issues to them</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="4.2">in which they can handle it so maybe you</text>
  <text start="361.37" dur="3.69">have to start small maybe you have to</text>
  <text start="362.48" dur="5.64">start with things like GMOs or fluoride</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="4.41">right that&amp;#39;s why I still I&amp;#39;m into the</text>
  <text start="368.12" dur="3.12">deep stuff I&amp;#39;m into the secret space</text>
  <text start="369.47" dur="3.57">program and all that jazz but you have</text>
  <text start="371.24" dur="4.67">to start small with maybe the GMO or</text>
  <text start="373.04" dur="4.89">fluoride or the banking system or</text>
  <text start="375.91" dur="4.06">politics right a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="6.03">beginning to see those so it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="379.97" dur="6.18">to bring those issues and brings</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="5.85">somebody further along the awakening</text>
  <text start="386.15" dur="5.49">path with you could say smaller issues I</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t like to say smaller but more</text>
  <text start="391.64" dur="6.33">obvious you could say and then you can</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="4.68">lead them to the deeper stuff so you</text>
  <text start="397.97" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t want to start somebody way</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="5.82">too far ahead from with that point in</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="4.559">which they&amp;#39;re ready and it just you get</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="2.459">better at it you get better at</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="3.331">discussing the topics with people I mean</text>
  <text start="408.139" dur="4.56">I worked in a health food store for five</text>
  <text start="410" dur="4.68">years I was literally selling the ideas</text>
  <text start="412.699" dur="5.21">of GMO foods and vaccines and fluorides</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="5.82">on to people so I got really good at</text>
  <text start="417.909" dur="4.121">selling reality to people at helping</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="4.11">people see what&amp;#39;s really going on at</text>
  <text start="422.03" dur="4.77">helping people become self-aware so</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="4.559">that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s what helped me that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="5.7">you know one of the things that I went</text>
  <text start="429.169" dur="5.601">through that helps sculpt and mold me to</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="4.379">be pretty good at this YouTube channel</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="4.269">and you can practice that right just</text>
  <text start="436.879" dur="4.41">practice talking with people that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="439.039" dur="4.081">big way you can help a lot of people on</text>
  <text start="441.289" dur="5.551">the awakening path that&amp;#39;s just practice</text>
  <text start="443.12" dur="6.599">practice talking with people about these</text>
  <text start="446.84" dur="4.5">ideas and selling them and you always</text>
  <text start="449.719" dur="4.29">want to ask questions as well</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="4.229">you always want to see where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.009" dur="2.97">coming from and their perspectives it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.569" dur="3.541">like I mean I was in sales it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.979" dur="4.861">literally selling these ideas to people</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="4.35">I mean you&amp;#39;re not the in the reward</text>
  <text start="461.84" dur="5.069">you&amp;#39;re getting is not financial it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="5.489">energetic because your your soul is</text>
  <text start="466.909" dur="4.22">happy to help somebody begin to break</text>
  <text start="468.949" dur="4.62">free from their own mental shackles so</text>
  <text start="471.129" dur="7.21">that&amp;#39;s the advice I have for you in this</text>
  <text start="473.569" dur="6.871">one man is understand where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.339" dur="5.19">coming from their perspectives start</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="5.279">with the smaller easier topics if</text>
  <text start="483.529" dur="5.341">necessary and then gradually gravitate</text>
  <text start="485.719" dur="8.82">them towards the deeper issues and then</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="8.88">you also need to be positive with when</text>
  <text start="494.539" dur="5.85">you share the scary stuff right say hey</text>
  <text start="497.75" dur="4.409">yes cancer cures have been suppressed</text>
  <text start="500.389" dur="4.65">free energy devices have been suppressed</text>
  <text start="502.159" dur="6.03">we are in a fiat money system or</text>
  <text start="505.039" dur="4.68">basically debt debt wage slaves but when</text>
  <text start="508.189" dur="3.48">you begin to realize that when you begin</text>
  <text start="509.719" dur="3.391">to accept those things and share those</text>
  <text start="511.669" dur="6.631">things that&amp;#39;s how we all break free from</text>
  <text start="513.11" dur="6.9">it and get those whether you want to say</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="3.359">cancer cures or free energy devices or</text>
  <text start="520.01" dur="4.139">attain our true freedom and our true</text>
  <text start="521.659" dur="3.87">potential behind that scary reality is</text>
  <text start="524.149" dur="4.68">being positive with it</text>
  <text start="525.529" dur="4.56">so there you go be positive and see</text>
  <text start="528.829" dur="3.531">where they&amp;#39;re coming from and star small</text>
