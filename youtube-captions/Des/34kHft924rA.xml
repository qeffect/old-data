  <text start="8.09" dur="6.25">hey there everybody so this video here</text>
  <text start="11.16" dur="5.49">is going to be the first in my Q&amp;amp;A video</text>
  <text start="14.34" dur="4.35">series now I don&amp;#39;t really know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="16.65" dur="4.2">gonna call it yet we&amp;#39;ll pick that up as</text>
  <text start="18.69" dur="4.89">we go along maybe I&amp;#39;ll call it satyr</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="5.339">says or ask Jordan or I&amp;#39;ll figure out</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="4.56">something catchy but anyway this first</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="6.21">question here for the first video comes</text>
  <text start="28.14" dur="4.529">from our friend EQ and on I like that</text>
  <text start="32.399" dur="2.671">one</text>
  <text start="32.669" dur="7.111">EQ anon comes from Twitter but he asks</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="9.66">how do I feel about remote viewing great</text>
  <text start="39.78" dur="7.65">question so to address this first I want</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.23">to talk about what remote viewing is for</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="3.149">those out there who aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="3.66">familiar with it and then I&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="3.721">about some of the underlying principles</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="3.39">because it might sound crazy when I</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="3.899">explain it to you so we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="4.799">some of the underlying principles on how</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="5.371">you can exactly remote view what do you</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="5.041">know how remote viewing is possible and</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="4.14">then we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss how you can do</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="3.57">it I&amp;#39;ll actually show you I&amp;#39;ll show an</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="6.39">example that I&amp;#39;m done but first of all</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="6.9">what is remote viewing remote viewing</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="4.35">so just think about those two words</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="5.52">together remote viewing basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="5.94">the concept that when you get into some</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="5.88">kind of meditative space right you quiet</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="5.85">your brain down and you start connecting</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="6.48">with I don&amp;#39;t to call your higher-self</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="6.839">but connecting with the Akashic records</text>
  <text start="94.2" dur="4.98">the all pervasive information field that</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="8.36">we&amp;#39;re all a part of you can actually</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="10.979">begin to see areas objects things scenes</text>
  <text start="105.439" dur="7.121">that are distanced from you that are</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="6.181">maybe even another spot on this earth</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="5.61">maybe even not even on this earth maybe</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="5.58">somewhere else in the solar system or</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="5.39">somewhere else in the galaxy okay and I</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="4.86">know this might sound crazy but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.56" dur="4.479">extremely possible and it&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="4.199">done all the time there&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="5.191">classes and courses that you can do for</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="6.84">it and believe it or not in</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="8.49">agencies they covet it they covet these</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="6">kind of psionic powers greatly so okay</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="4.86">it might sound nuts sitting there</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="5.67">meditating and being able to view an</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="4.53">object or use something that&amp;#39;s hundreds</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="2.941">of thousands of miles away right so</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="3.9">let&amp;#39;s talk about some of the underlying</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="6.99">principles on what makes remote viewing</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="7.38">possible first remember this I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="5.01">it before I&amp;#39;ll say it again and many</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="5.129">other esteemed scientists have said this</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="9.36">all points in space and time are</text>
  <text start="167.519" dur="7.891">connected okay very pivotal archetypal</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="3.449">understanding of our universe right</text>
  <text start="175.41" dur="4.62">there all points in space and time are</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="4.59">connected quantum physicists say this I</text>
  <text start="180.03" dur="3.84">said this in my video when I was</text>
  <text start="181.829" dur="4.891">discussing antigravity remember</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="6.33">discussing how craft can actually portal</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="9.12">from one place to another and this is</text>
  <text start="190.2" dur="8.31">also this also describes how our mind</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="6.72">works that idea of entanglement</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="8.069">everything&amp;#39;s entangled together and that</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="8.579">being said number two consciousness all</text>
  <text start="206.579" dur="6.72">is mind deep deep hermetic wisdom cosmic</text>
  <text start="211.139" dur="5.22">law right there everything is</text>
  <text start="213.299" dur="6.291">consciousness based consciousness is the</text>
  <text start="216.359" dur="7.53">substance that literally makes up our</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="6.489">reality so seeing as mind is everything</text>
  <text start="223.889" dur="6.021">and all points in space and time are</text>
  <text start="226.079" dur="8.101">connected when you do get into that</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="6.04">quieted mind that space where you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="3.33">have any insistent this incessant</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="3.8">thoughts flowing through your head and</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re able to tap in to that</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="6.609">intelligence source that source field as</text>
  <text start="242.37" dur="5.94">some have called it right then it just</text>
  <text start="246.359" dur="6.111">flows from there that yes you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="7.729">be able to view whatever you focus on</text>
  <text start="252.47" dur="6.04">granted is not easy to do that it takes</text>
  <text start="256.039" dur="6.341">lots and lots of practice lots and lots</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="6.89">of effort it takes a very I wanna say</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="4.2">healthy mind and healthy body but a very</text>
  <text start="265.4" dur="4.269">strong</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="7.32">mind very focused minds to do that to</text>
  <text start="269.669" dur="7.141">remote view so if you want to remote</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="4.979">view if you want to practice with it</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="5.22">right it&amp;#39;s kind of fun to do actually</text>
  <text start="278.879" dur="4.681">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different a lot of</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="4.139">different programs a lot of difference</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="4.59">even simple things you can do online for</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="5.011">free what I&amp;#39;m gonna do is actually post</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="4.56">a picture up of the first remote viewing</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="2.91">session that I ever done right here and</text>
  <text start="292.71" dur="4.56">you can check it out</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s you see how similar the two</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="4.049">pictures are this is the first time that</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="3.659">I had ever done it and I was excited</text>
  <text start="301.319" dur="2.671">granted I did it a couple times after</text>
  <text start="302.849" dur="3.06">this and didn&amp;#39;t get quite the same</text>
  <text start="303.99" dur="4.889">results but I&amp;#39;m pretty proud pretty</text>
  <text start="305.909" dur="5.521">proud of my of how how closely that</text>
  <text start="308.879" dur="5.16">sailboat looked to whatever the heck I</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="4.59">drew and I remember in this instance you</text>
  <text start="314.039" dur="4.081">know what I had done is that I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="3.69">want to overthink it and that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="2.909">think a lot of people do not just when</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="3.239">they meditate but when they Remote View</text>
  <text start="321.029" dur="4.281">they overthink the out of it</text>
  <text start="322.949" dur="4.74">because they overthink the process it</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="4.9">steers them away from getting it right</text>
  <text start="327.689" dur="3.66">so what I did is I just sat down and I</text>
  <text start="330.21" dur="2.459">didn&amp;#39;t want to overthink it</text>
  <text start="331.349" dur="2.94">I only sat there for a couple minutes</text>
  <text start="332.669" dur="5.25">trying to quiet my mind and yeah I just</text>
  <text start="334.289" dur="5.94">drew and I drew and I drew whatever was</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="3.631">coming to me I I don&amp;#39;t even think I</text>
  <text start="340.229" dur="2.94">looked at the paper I kept my eyes</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="4.829">closed and I was just drawing and then</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="5.641">it came out pretty darn similar wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="346.379" dur="4.981">too bad for doing it my very first time</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="3.659">and not really even doing any courses or</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="4.169">learning about it or anything like that</text>
  <text start="352.469" dur="6.06">so yeah if you want to try remote</text>
  <text start="355.529" dur="6.54">viewing do just that find you can find</text>
  <text start="358.529" dur="5.04">easy little things to do on the internet</text>
  <text start="362.069" dur="6.541">you know different websites where they</text>
  <text start="363.569" dur="8.91">give you a kind of quantifier and then</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="5.549">you draw right you meditate and draw</text>
  <text start="372.479" dur="3.72">whatever comes to you just whatever</text>
  <text start="374.159" dur="4.141">comes to you don&amp;#39;t have any kind of</text>
  <text start="376.199" dur="4.47">preconceived notions with it just</text>
  <text start="378.3" dur="8.459">whatever comes to you and then see what</text>
  <text start="380.669" dur="7.68">it is it&amp;#39;s pretty fun and also on remote</text>
  <text start="386.759" dur="4.19">viewing you know one time I met a guy</text>
  <text start="388.349" dur="5.401">his name was Gerald O&amp;#39;Donnell I met him</text>
  <text start="390.949" dur="5.631">at the Eclipse of disclosure conference</text>
  <text start="393.75" dur="4.96">back in August and</text>
  <text start="396.58" dur="5.97">it was awesome meeting this guy I mean</text>
  <text start="398.71" dur="7.23">he he knew very very deep concepts but</text>
  <text start="402.55" dur="5.609">he actually has a course that you can do</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="4.59">on remote viewing as well so if you want</text>
  <text start="408.159" dur="3.69">to go a little deeper into that subject</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="5.039">you can check out Gerald O&amp;#39;Donnell&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.849" dur="6.171">course and go from there so anyway</text>
  <text start="415.569" dur="7.681">that&amp;#39;s how I feel about remote viewing</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="6.82">supercool ideas very deep concepts but</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="4.319">very serious concepts as well might</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="5.97">sound nuts to some at first but this is</text>
  <text start="427.569" dur="6.061">taken extremely seriously by a lot of</text>
  <text start="430.81" dur="5.78">people and if you want to try it out go</text>
  <text start="433.63" dur="6.03">do it peace</text>
