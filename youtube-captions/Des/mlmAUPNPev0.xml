  <text start="15.33" dur="3.449">because it has to do with the</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="4.351">declassification of America&amp;#39;s secret</text>
  <text start="18.779" dur="4.201">space programs quite literally so</text>
  <text start="20.73" dur="4.2">getting into this story I&amp;#39;m gonna use an</text>
  <text start="22.98" dur="4.049">article from defense news.com and the</text>
  <text start="24.93" dur="4.169">headline here states burette and Rogers</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.32">Barret is Barbara Barret she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="29.099" dur="3.841">secretary of the Air Force and Rogers as</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="3.541">Mike Rogers he&amp;#39;s a representative from</text>
  <text start="32.94" dur="3.959">Alabama so we literally have the</text>
  <text start="34.89" dur="3.78">Secretary of the Air Force and a</text>
  <text start="36.899" dur="3.601">congressman considering the</text>
  <text start="38.67" dur="6">declassification of it says here</text>
  <text start="40.5" dur="6.78">secretive space programs yes it actually</text>
  <text start="44.67" dur="3.99">says that so let&amp;#39;s read a little bit</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="4.439">more of this article and then all</text>
  <text start="48.66" dur="5.01">expound on it it says the US Air Force</text>
  <text start="51.719" dur="4.471">is top civilian and a key member of</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="4.5">Congress agreed Saturday on the need to</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="4.47">declassify a large amount of information</text>
  <text start="58.17" dur="4.68">about America&amp;#39;s military space programs</text>
  <text start="60.66" dur="4.56">to both intimidate foes and encourage</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="4.5">support among the public declassifying</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="5.219">some of what is currently held in secure</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="5.04">vaults would be a good idea Air Force</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="3.72">secretary Barbara Barret said during a</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="3.57">panel at the Reagan National Defense</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="4.14">forum you would have to be careful about</text>
  <text start="75.96" dur="4.62">what we do classify but there is much</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="4.921">more classified than what needs to be</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="4.77">Wow big statements there from an Air</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="4.89">Force secretary talking about secure</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="5.46">vaults and declassifying secret space</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.04">program information so let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="90.81" dur="4.919">quick look at Barbara Brett&amp;#39;s background</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="4.41">all right let&amp;#39;s see where she came from</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re gonna use Wikipedia here I know</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="4.53">Wikipedia sucks but they can be good for</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="5.311">basic information I want to know what</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="4.83">Barbara Barret might know about these</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="4.38">black projects so it says here Barret is</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="4.44">a former chair of the Aerospace</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="4.139">Corporation big defense contractor right</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="3.119">there and she&amp;#39;s a member on the boards</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="2.121">of the California Institute of</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="5.161">Technology</text>
  <text start="115.28" dur="6.729">JPL Jet Propulsion Laboratory and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="3.869">interesting considering what JPL has</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="4.201">been involved with and who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="5.581">involved there in terms of space we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="5.19">got the RAND Corporation another very</text>
  <text start="129.09" dur="4.35">interesting one especially considering</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="3">the year the RAND Corporation was</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="3.51">founded</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="5.22">what particular scientists were put into</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="4.77">the RAND Corporation and especially what</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="3.839">the RAND Corporation actually studied</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="4.379">you know what not what we&amp;#39;re told on the</text>
  <text start="143.459" dur="4.381">public surface but putting the evidence</text>
  <text start="146.099" dur="4.081">together to gather the clues about what</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="3.989">they really studied that&amp;#39;s a big one and</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="4.5">she&amp;#39;s also been connected with Raytheon</text>
  <text start="151.829" dur="4.86">in the past so if anybody&amp;#39;s gonna know</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="4.169">something about what&amp;#39;s in those secured</text>
  <text start="156.689" dur="5.22">vaults it might be our Air Force</text>
  <text start="158.849" dur="4.92">secretary Barbara Barret right here this</text>
  <text start="161.909" dur="4.08">article continues fellow panelists</text>
  <text start="163.769" dur="3.69">Representative Mike Rogers said he met</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="3.75">with the secretary earlier in the week</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="4.34">to discuss that very issue calling the</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="5.761">information on space programs quote</text>
  <text start="171.799" dur="6.491">overwhelmingly classified I agree there</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="3.93">for Rogers that over-classification is</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="2.849">one of the reasons it&amp;#39;s been so</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="3.33">difficult for him and others to build</text>
  <text start="181.139" dur="3.69">support both in the public and with</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="5.849">other members of Congress for a space</text>
  <text start="184.829" dur="6.391">force Wow well yeah maybe if we know</text>
  <text start="188.609" dur="5.52">what they were really trying to do with</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="4.62">this space force people would be a lot</text>
  <text start="194.129" dur="3.42">more behind it right now it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="3.269">fantasy in a lot of people&amp;#39;s heads but</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="3.9">Wow if we&amp;#39;re talking about them</text>
  <text start="199.109" dur="4.44">declassifying some stuff for people to</text>
  <text start="201.449" dur="6.12">go ooh and AH this is what we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="203.549" dur="5.511">capable of that&amp;#39;s big news his article</text>
  <text start="207.569" dur="4.651">continues to talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="5.349">declassification to battle foes and</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="5.189">other countries and just have you know</text>
  <text start="214.409" dur="5.371">national security in check right here it</text>
  <text start="217.409" dur="5.281">said the two declined to say how much of</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="4.319">the black space portfolio could move</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="3.629">into the public nor when the changes</text>
  <text start="224.099" dur="3.991">would start happening but Barret pledged</text>
  <text start="226.319" dur="3.66">that it would be a focus for her office</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="4.769">moving forward a sign that progress</text>
  <text start="229.979" dur="4.861">could come during 2020 all right so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="232.859" dur="3.3">gonna stop with the article there one</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="4.47">last thing on the article though I find</text>
  <text start="236.159" dur="6.75">it highly highly surprising that they</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="5.099">put black space portfolio right there in</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="3.601">words not just talking about secret</text>
  <text start="244.409" dur="4.8">space programs but actually saying the</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.05">black project terminology so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="4.14">putting these things out into the public</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="5.19">consciousness which that&amp;#39;s incredible I</text>
  <text start="253.349" dur="4.44">mean truly this is disclosure in action</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="4.019">here folks you know a lot of people and</text>
  <text start="257.789" dur="4.44">they think of disclosure in terms of</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="3.781">space or what the military or</text>
  <text start="262.229" dur="3.93">intelligence community really knows</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="4.89">about what&amp;#39;s really out there people</text>
  <text start="266.159" dur="3.931">think it&amp;#39;s going to be a one-off event</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="3.99">where you have you know the president</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="4.5">get up on a podium and say oh yes</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="4.35">disclosure is here folks I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="274.59" dur="4.41">all of what about what I really know in</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="5.43">the secret programs you know people</text>
  <text start="279" dur="5.19">expect it to be that and it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="3.66">to be that in fact it&amp;#39;s a process it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.14">long process and it&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="285.87" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s currently happening and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="4.98">seeing it right here step by step</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="5.43">alright and this is a pretty big step so</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="3.69">they actually put black space in that</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="3.03">you know what&amp;#39;s funny is that when I</text>
  <text start="297" dur="4.02">first saw this article on Twitter the</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="4.71">headline didn&amp;#39;t state secret of space</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="4.59">programs it said black space programs</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="3.96">but they changed it to say secret of</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="3.39">space programs you know interesting way</text>
  <text start="307.47" dur="3.51">that they&amp;#39;re trying to communicate ideas</text>
  <text start="309" dur="4.62">to the public so there you go</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="7.13">Air Force secretary Congressman want to</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="7.05">declassify what&amp;#39;s really going on to</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="5.23">gains public support behind it which</text>
  <text start="320.67" dur="4.44">totally you know if the public really</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="3.6">had truth and transparency on their side</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="4.08">for sure there&amp;#39;d be a lot more things</text>
  <text start="326.94" dur="5.28">that they would support and of course</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="4.83">they would be against as well so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="3.45">talk a little bit about these secretive</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="5.37">space programs all right now I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="5.25">gonna go off on this subject and I want</text>
  <text start="339.39" dur="4.86">to talk about number one this space</text>
  <text start="340.92" dur="5.55">force and how that connects connects</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="3.87">into the battle for disclosure and you</text>
  <text start="346.47" dur="3.449">know the annihilation of the deep state</text>
  <text start="348.12" dur="4.53">but also the great awaking of humanity</text>
  <text start="349.919" dur="4.441">and where we&amp;#39;re all going as a society</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;ll get there but I first want to start</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="4.5">with the history we&amp;#39;re gonna go back a</text>
  <text start="356.46" dur="4.5">little bit to gain a clearer picture of</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s really in the space programs</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="5.07">these black projects and what we could</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="6.24">expect so I&amp;#39;m gonna backtrack about a</text>
  <text start="366.03" dur="5.97">century here let&amp;#39;s go back to the 30s</text>
  <text start="369.48" dur="6.71">40s even you know about this timeframe</text>
  <text start="372" dur="7.74">8090 years ago this timeframe</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="6.25">looking at the scientists and inventors</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="5.01">and the type of physics that the</text>
  <text start="382.44" dur="3.75">intelligence community was desperately</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="3.84">trying to look at not just in this</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="6.45">country but you know Nazi Germany during</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="6.05">that timeframe as well like the powers</text>
  <text start="392.64" dur="4.38">that be around the world they were</text>
  <text start="394.64" dur="4.54">heavily invested in looking for this</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="5.22">hidden science secret science and also</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="5.37">invested in selling the public</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.35">false sciences and fake histories and a</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="4.88">lot of of course fake news and fake</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="5.34">information to get them off the scent to</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="5.98">control the public but what was really</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="6.54">happening in the secret space realm the</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="5.159">black realm truly happening you had so</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="4.77">many inventors during the 20s 30s 40s</text>
  <text start="420.569" dur="5.1">they were coming forward with all these</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="4.41">type of magnetic resonance technologies</text>
  <text start="425.669" dur="3.601">and vibrational physics they were</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="3.78">looking at the ether they were looking</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="5.31">at space and time and gravity in</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="6.12">completely different ways than the</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="4.32">mainstream the establishment right yeah</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="3.45">because they were doing this and having</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="5.37">a lot of success doing it for instance</text>
  <text start="441" dur="4.319">Nikola Tesla do I even need to say his</text>
  <text start="444.27" dur="3.149">name and what he was doing with his</text>
  <text start="445.319" dur="4.621">radiant energy sending electricity</text>
  <text start="447.419" dur="4.051">wirelessly not just that but Tesla was</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="3.659">getting into his dynamic theory of</text>
  <text start="451.47" dur="4.319">gravity during the end of his life where</text>
  <text start="453.599" dur="4.56">did Tesla&amp;#39;s papers go swooped up by the</text>
  <text start="455.789" dur="5.22">FBI so that&amp;#39;s that we have Thomas</text>
  <text start="458.159" dur="8.421">Townsend Brown in the 30s and 40s who</text>
  <text start="461.009" dur="7.741">was patenting his disks his</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="3.399">electrogravitic disks as he called he</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="3.15">call that electrogravitics he was</text>
  <text start="469.979" dur="4.141">working on being able to unify</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="5.43">electricity in gravity and through high</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="6.359">voltage electrostatics he was able to</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="5.82">make metal disks levitate and move</text>
  <text start="480.479" dur="5.131">around when putting that electric charge</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="5.04">at certain angles at that disks at</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="4.44">certain you know parts of it he would</text>
  <text start="488.19" dur="4.37">able to make the disk be able to move</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="4.5">direction and control that direction</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="5.289">electrogravitics holy crap where&amp;#39;d his</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="5.489">information go classified Navy</text>
  <text start="497.849" dur="4.141">classified it don&amp;#39;t know exactly why</text>
  <text start="500.039" dur="4.35">they classified it if Thomas Townsend</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="3.84">Brown was pressured to do it or if he</text>
  <text start="504.389" dur="3.511">willingly agreed to do it you know</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="3.66">convinced in some way those are just a</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="5.879">couple of examples folks we have the</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="6.21">inventors we also have many of the</text>
  <text start="513.779" dur="4.771">alleged crash craft crashed</text>
  <text start="515.7" dur="3.959">extraterrestrial craft that may have</text>
  <text start="518.55" dur="3.029">error will happen and we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="519.659" dur="5.071">good evidence to actually support that</text>
  <text start="521.579" dur="4.681">there were multiple crafts that crashed</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="4.29">on this planet not just in this country</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="4.8">with like Roswell in the Battle of Los</text>
  <text start="529.02" dur="5.4">Angeles incident that occurred in 1942</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="4.74">over Long Beach Harbor but also maybe</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="3.51">over there in Europe</text>
  <text start="535.8" dur="5.76">South America and around the world you</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="5.61">know this this we have great evidence to</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="5.82">show this happen and also you then think</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="7.2">ok if they&amp;#39;re going to get any sort of</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="5.19">present drop in their lap or be able to</text>
  <text start="550.74" dur="3.93">you know use some directed energy</text>
  <text start="552.57" dur="3.99">technology to take down a craft that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="4.289">not of this world they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="5.37">reverse-engineer that you know however</text>
  <text start="558.959" dur="4.231">they got it whoever they got it from you</text>
  <text start="561.93" dur="2.099">know they&amp;#39;re damn well they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="5.04">everything they can to reverse</text>
  <text start="564.029" dur="6.211">engineering so looks like they have we</text>

  <text start="582.93" dur="5.909">about it why not play it off play it off</text>
  <text start="585.48" dur="5.64">like aliens nobody&amp;#39;s gonna think it</text>
  <text start="588.839" dur="4.321">could actually be man-made right and</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="4.68">then they&amp;#39;re gonna put out all sorts of</text>
  <text start="593.16" dur="5.07">disinformation on the et topic anyway to</text>
  <text start="595.8" dur="6.51">scare people and confuse in there so</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="6.66">very very elaborate psyops they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="602.31" dur="5.19">for decades to keep this all secret but</text>
  <text start="604.89" dur="4.29">thank god it&amp;#39;s coming out now we got the</text>
  <text start="607.5" dur="5.1">internet and people looking into it and</text>
  <text start="609.18" dur="5.34">talking about it but my gosh you go back</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="3.21">through history and you go through all</text>
  <text start="614.52" dur="2.52">the information that&amp;#39;s out there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="3.42">a lot you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="617.04" dur="3.6">information and it takes a lot of time</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve been researching this stuff for</text>
  <text start="620.64" dur="4.29">seven eight years many others out there</text>
  <text start="623.64" dur="3.42">have been researching it a lot longer</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="3.75">and it&amp;#39;s still we&amp;#39;re still trying to</text>
  <text start="627.06" dur="3.57">puzzle together piece together what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="628.68" dur="4.37">really going on some people tell me that</text>
  <text start="630.63" dur="4.89">they don&amp;#39;t want to get into researching</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="4.57">secret space program information or the</text>
  <text start="635.52" dur="4.379">UFO topic because of how confusing it is</text>
  <text start="637.62" dur="6.3">and how much disinformation is out there</text>
  <text start="639.899" dur="5.581">about it and I get it totally but at the</text>
  <text start="643.92" dur="3.419">same time you know the reason why</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="3.89">there&amp;#39;s so much disinformation out there</text>
  <text start="647.339" dur="4.86">about it is because there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="649.37" dur="5.11">liberating truth within it we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="652.199" dur="4.051">technologies that are going to change</text>
  <text start="654.48" dur="3.479">our textbooks number one because all of</text>
  <text start="656.25" dur="3.089">our textbooks are wrong and number two</text>
  <text start="657.959" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re going to change our paradigm as</text>
  <text start="659.339" dur="4.651">we&amp;#39;re talking unlimited net electricity</text>
  <text start="661.98" dur="4.4">creation we&amp;#39;re talking anti-gravity and</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="5.65">consciousness assisted technologies and</text>
  <text start="666.38" dur="5.12">you know mind-blowing changes</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re all in for when this all really</text>
  <text start="671.5" dur="6.269">comes out so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened over</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="4.219">the last century and then all those</text>
  <text start="677.769" dur="4.651">black projects have been built out with</text>
  <text start="679.709" dur="6.221">stolen billions if not trillions of</text>
  <text start="682.42" dur="6.349">dollars that we can very well gauge</text>
  <text start="685.93" dur="5.01">through different testimonies and</text>
  <text start="688.769" dur="3.94">reports and things like that so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="4.11">been billions trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="692.709" dur="5.19">funneled into these space programs to</text>
  <text start="695.05" dur="5.19">develop a whole lot of stuff okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.899" dur="5.31">been said the Air Force has had flying</text>
  <text start="700.24" dur="4.62">discs since the 50s or 60s ARVs they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="703.209" dur="5.031">been termed alien reproduction vehicles</text>
  <text start="704.86" dur="6.06">maybe even tr-3b black triangles</text>
  <text start="708.24" dur="6.3">anti-gravity craft using you know maybe</text>
  <text start="710.92" dur="6.75">some sort of mercury plasma drive to</text>
  <text start="714.54" dur="5.47">levitate create its own little bubble in</text>
  <text start="717.67" dur="4.02">space-time so it can fly it one hundred</text>
  <text start="720.01" dur="4.199">thousand miles an hour and feel zero</text>
  <text start="721.69" dur="5.43">inertia the pilots feel nothing you know</text>
  <text start="724.209" dur="6.961">so these these technologies they get out</text>
  <text start="727.12" dur="7.079">there but it&amp;#39;s real physics folks real</text>
  <text start="731.17" dur="5.13">physics that&amp;#39;s what I want to know so</text>
  <text start="734.199" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m very interested to see where this</text>
  <text start="736.3" dur="4.37">declassification goes because if it goes</text>
  <text start="738.339" dur="4.771">into this these sorts of physics and</text>
  <text start="740.67" dur="4.359">these sorts of truths and you know you</text>
  <text start="743.11" dur="3.419">know we&amp;#39;re looking at legitimate stuff</text>
  <text start="745.029" dur="5.461">and that brings us into the discussion</text>
  <text start="746.529" dur="5.881">of the space force so how do we get into</text>
  <text start="750.49" dur="3.959">this well the battle for disclosure</text>
  <text start="752.41" dur="6.419">let me just paint this picture for you</text>
  <text start="754.449" dur="8.191">okay in 2016 if she won you know what</text>
  <text start="758.829" dur="5.491">I&amp;#39;m talking about if she won disclosure</text>
  <text start="762.64" dur="4.59">would have looked a whole lot different</text>
  <text start="764.32" dur="5.699">sure we would might have got some bits</text>
  <text start="767.23" dur="4.109">and pieces about this black project of</text>
  <text start="770.019" dur="3.661">the space program and there would have</text>
  <text start="771.339" dur="4.141">been some stuff disclosed to us but it</text>
  <text start="773.68" dur="4.589">would have not have been the full truth</text>
  <text start="775.48" dur="4.56">it would have been just like a trinket</text>
  <text start="778.269" dur="3.421">to distract us so they could shove the</text>
  <text start="780.04" dur="3.78">rest of their crimes of humanity the</text>
  <text start="781.69" dur="4.92">deep state under the rug it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="783.82" dur="4.29">what it would have been and then you</text>
  <text start="786.61" dur="6.69">know this country and this world would</text>
  <text start="788.11" dur="6.63">have downhill into shambles that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="793.3" dur="2.729">would have happened we would have got</text>
  <text start="794.74" dur="3.87">this pitiful disclosure they were to</text>
  <text start="796.029" dur="4.5">cook the rest secret now since we have a</text>
  <text start="798.61" dur="3.9">different timeline we&amp;#39;re getting into</text>
  <text start="800.529" dur="2.991">here we have Trump on the scene the</text>
  <text start="802.51" dur="2.3">president trying to</text>
  <text start="803.52" dur="4.68">bringing truth and transparency to the</text>
  <text start="804.81" dur="4.98">public we have cue alerting us on you</text>
  <text start="808.2" dur="3.32">know this stuff is real they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="809.79" dur="4.89">basically saying this stuff&amp;#39;s legit and</text>
  <text start="811.52" dur="5.47">we don&amp;#39;t know what exactly the specifics</text>
  <text start="814.68" dur="4.47">of what&amp;#39;s real legit but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="816.99" dur="4.35">confirming secret space programs yes</text>
