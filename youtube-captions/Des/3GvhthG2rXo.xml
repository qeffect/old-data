  <text start="14.07" dur="5.01">intervention yes this is very real it</text>
  <text start="16.8" dur="4.11">happens and it happens far more than a</text>
  <text start="19.08" dur="3.06">lot of people even realize which is why</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="3.359">shouldn&amp;#39;t light needs to be shed on this</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="5.309">and I also want to get into the concept</text>
  <text start="24.269" dur="4.951">of medical disinformation basically the</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="4.491">untruths that we get from our medical</text>
  <text start="29.22" dur="5.249">authorities and the supposed mainstream</text>
  <text start="31.94" dur="4.66">medical scientific establishment because</text>
  <text start="34.469" dur="5.61">by seeing this medical disinformation</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="5.67">seeing how they lie to us about natural</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="4.651">treatments and about our health you can</text>
  <text start="42.27" dur="4.41">see more clearly as to how these forced</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="2.34">medical interventions take place all</text>
  <text start="46.68" dur="2.879">right</text>
  <text start="47.07" dur="4.489">so in getting into this topic I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="4.711">cover some recent news stories about</text>
  <text start="51.559" dur="4.601">medical kidnapping because this will</text>
  <text start="54.27" dur="3.929">make it personal this will allow you to</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="4.53">see how exactly it happens and who it</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="4.29">happens to so the first story that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="60.69" dur="3.84">gonna start with comes from late last</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="4.141">week and you can see the headline here</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="5.4">it says mom who wants to treat</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="6.87">daughter&amp;#39;s cancer with CBD oil instead</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="4.77">of surgery turns herself into police now</text>
  <text start="73.5" dur="3.479">mind you this was printed in the</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="3.9">mainstream media so we&amp;#39;re gonna parse</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="4.021">this article for all the false</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="4.35">narratives and twisted context that they</text>
  <text start="81" dur="3.869">typically write with but let&amp;#39;s keep</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="3.72">getting into it here Kristina Dixon was</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.14">her name and she&amp;#39;s facing two counts</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.15">each of first-degree custodial</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="6">interference and first-degree criminal</text>
  <text start="91.82" dur="4.54">mistreatment so you&amp;#39;re telling me she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="3.72">being charged with custodial</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="5.539">interference and criminal mistreatment</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="7.92">of her own child for simply wanting to</text>
  <text start="101.899" dur="6.281">treat cancer their own way huh okay</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="3.601">let&amp;#39;s see exactly how this happened an</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="4.469">organ mother they&amp;#39;re out of organ there</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="4.56">is accused of taking her ailing daughter</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="4.801">out of the state to avoid cancer</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="5.099">treatment opting instead to use CBD oil</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="5.19">and other supposed naturopathic</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="4.92">treatments okay two things here number</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="4.589">one it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like she was</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.981">avoiding cancer treatment at all it</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="4.471">sounds like she was avoiding their</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.16">cancer treatments and treating the</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="3.88">cancer her</text>
  <text start="132.97" dur="4.95">all right they don&amp;#39;t say that they</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="3.87">framed that with a very twisted context</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="4.11">and not just that but in the headline</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="5.37">here it states that she only used CBD</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="4.49">oil when in fact she was doing many</text>
  <text start="144.82" dur="4.08">different things many different</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="5.08">naturopathic treatments treating it</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="5.43">naturally basically so that headline is</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="5.58">wrong again framing this with the</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="5.19">twisted context this outlet confirms</text>
  <text start="157.18" dur="3.93">that Kristina Dixon was booked early</text>
  <text start="159.52" dur="4.86">Thursday morning at Clackamas County</text>
  <text start="161.11" dur="5.7">Jail she faces those particular charges</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="4.65">of custodial interference and criminal</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="4.35">mistreatment Dixon&amp;#39;s 13 year old</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="3.99">daughter Kylie is battling liver cancer</text>
  <text start="171.16" dur="4.2">and according to the local news in</text>
  <text start="173.02" dur="4.13">Clackamas there a doctor had ordered a</text>

  <text start="180.64" dur="7.11">remove one cancerous tumor from the</text>
  <text start="183.46" dur="6.57">girl&amp;#39;s liver so the mainstream doctors</text>
  <text start="187.75" dur="4.97">wanted to treat this cancer the</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="5.31">mainstream way we often call this the</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="4.9">poison burn medical system when it comes</text>
  <text start="195.34" dur="4.53">to cancer because that&amp;#39;s typically all</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="4.68">they want to do they want to cut it out</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="4.95">with surgery they want to burn it away</text>
  <text start="202.3" dur="6.84">with radiation or they want to poison</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="7.47">you with chemotherapy to rid you of that</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="5.819">cancer reminds you all very toxic all</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="5.54">very harmful a couple of them being</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="6.271">poisonous and all very expensive right</text>
  <text start="217.83" dur="5.02">but this woman is getting charged</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="3.69">because she didn&amp;#39;t want to do those</text>
  <text start="222.85" dur="4.08">things she didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with the</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="4.92">expensiveness and the toxic nature of</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="5.49">some of these in the risk involved she</text>
  <text start="229.84" dur="4.44">just wanted to do it her own way then</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="3.63">the article continues but Dixon claims</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="3.06">her treatment has gotten results in an</text>
  <text start="236.05" dur="2.58">interview with the news she said she</text>
  <text start="237.34" dur="3.42">believed that an alternative treatment</text>
  <text start="238.63" dur="3.45">of vitamins herbs and pure CBD oil has</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="4.009">been effective in treating her</text>
  <text start="242.08" dur="5.879">daughter&amp;#39;s cancer authorities allege</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="5.351">authorities alleged that Dixon and Kylee</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="4.981">left the state June to avoid treatment</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="5.119">she went to Nevada they literally had to</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="4.65">hunt her down through a series of tips</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="3.161">authorities determined she skipped to</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="2.1">Nevada</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="4.35">they found her they put her in</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="5.19">protective custody in June she went to</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="4.06">court in July in Oregon and a judge</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="4">ruled that state child welfare</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="3.18">workers could make medical decisions for</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="3.12">her child</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="2.91">then they issued a warrant for her</text>

  <text start="290.06" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s effective or next necessary but a</text>
  <text start="291.889" dur="5.701">representative from Court Appointed</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="5.25">Special Advocates recommended that the</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="4.95">alternative medicine should complement</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="3.959">traditional medicine so what do we have</text>

  <text start="338.78" dur="3.36">some research to do you&amp;#39;ve got some</text>
  <text start="340.669" dur="6.75">research to do about natural health</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="7.02">about how non safe and ineffective their</text>
  <text start="347.419" dur="4.741">versions are how safe and effective the</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="4.98">natural versions are and how much again</text>

  <text start="362.99" dur="4.17">poison or burn cancer out of you</text>
  <text start="364.639" dur="4.141">instead of heal it another way which can</text>
  <text start="367.16" dur="3.27">be done which has been done so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="3.9">our first story how about our second</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="4.47">story of medical kidnapping okay so this</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="3.57">one blew up in the mainstream media just</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="3.42">a couple of months ago again this</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="4.08">happens more frequently than a lot of</text>
  <text start="378.32" dur="4.14">people realize you know the ones we see</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="3.99">in the media are just a fraction of what</text>
  <text start="382.46" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t get reported but this one hit</text>
  <text start="384.32" dur="4.86">the mainstream and it involves a story</text>
  <text start="386.15" dur="6.389">of Joshua McAdams and Taylor bland ball</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="6.54">their child three year-old Noah McAdams</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="6.75">had leukemia and again they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="395.72" dur="4.65">avoiding cancer treatment keeping their</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="3.66">child from cancer</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="4.86">as the NBC fake news headline says here</text>
  <text start="402.949" dur="4.381">they were wanting to do it naturally so</text>
  <text start="405.23" dur="5.249">they left Florida they drove out of</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="5.16">state and they were healing their child</text>
  <text start="410.479" dur="4.081">of cancer naturally they were posting</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="3.26">about this all over their Facebook page</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="3.9">documenting the whole experience</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="4.54">documenting the exact modalities they</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="4.76">were using one called the Gerson Therapy</text>
  <text start="420.29" dur="6.27">they were using a lot of natural herbs</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="5.65">natural ways to heal their child but</text>
  <text start="426.56" dur="5.91">again medical authorities found them</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="6.9">they issued a warrant out for their</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="5.16">arrest they took custody away from their</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="6.81">child and they forced their child to</text>
  <text start="437.63" dur="7.259">have chemotherapy for his cancer just</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="3.96">how absurd is this stuff guys how absurd</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="3.871">this is why light needs to be shed on</text>
  <text start="446.54" dur="3.689">these topics because these children are</text>
  <text start="448.76" dur="3.54">getting ripped away from their parents</text>
  <text start="450.229" dur="5.94">how awful is that that you literally</text>

  <text start="738.9" dur="3.57">instrumental in creating the allopathic</text>
  <text start="740.82" dur="3.72">or the current medical system that we</text>
  <text start="742.47" dur="3.87">use these days and then when they did</text>
  <text start="744.54" dur="4.05">that when this was searched into the</text>
  <text start="746.34" dur="4.5">Flexner report when this Flexner report</text>
  <text start="748.59" dur="6.27">was ridiculously written and pushed out</text>
  <text start="750.84" dur="7.32">in 1910 chiropractic naturopathy</text>
  <text start="754.86" dur="6.06">herbalism all of these fields of study</text>
  <text start="758.16" dur="5.43">and all of these practitioners were just</text>
  <text start="760.92" dur="4.65">heavily pushed out because all of the</text>
  <text start="763.59" dur="3.81">money all of the attention was being</text>
  <text start="765.57" dur="3.18">funneled into research millions of</text>
  <text start="767.4" dur="4.59">dollars into research is never-ending</text>
  <text start="768.75" dur="4.8">black hole of research jeez they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="771.99" dur="4.43">researching these things forever with</text>
  <text start="773.55" dur="5.73">millions if not billions of dollars and</text>
  <text start="776.42" dur="5.8">allopath e you know the modern pill</text>
  <text start="779.28" dur="4.74">prescription way of doing things this is</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="6.12">what got built up after that Flexner</text>
  <text start="784.02" dur="6.36">report after the AMA was built to</text>
  <text start="788.34" dur="4.32">publicity in the early 1900s then all</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="4.77">those natural ways got sanitized then</text>
  <text start="792.66" dur="5.22">any sort of natural healers that tried</text>
  <text start="795.15" dur="5.88">to speak up speak out do the great work</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="5.82">since then dr. max Gerson royal rife</text>
  <text start="801.03" dur="5.13">anybody promoting chlorine dioxide all</text>
  <text start="803.7" dur="6.87">those natural cancer doctors even</text>
  <text start="806.16" dur="9.36">mothers even families that are trying to</text>
  <text start="810.57" dur="7.65">treat themselves in natural ways can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.52" dur="6.03">do it it&amp;#39;s the medical mafia in action</text>
  <text start="818.22" dur="5.31">so I leave you here with these thoughts</text>
  <text start="821.55" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s more imperative than ever that we</text>
  <text start="823.53" dur="4.44">number one wake up</text>
  <text start="825.39" dur="7.02">research for ourselves make the effort</text>
  <text start="827.97" dur="6.87">to learn about yourself how to eat how</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="3.87">to move how to be healthy all these</text>
  <text start="834.84" dur="3.48">things probably because of course they</text>
  <text start="836.28" dur="3.69">won&amp;#39;t tell us the right ways the medical</text>
  <text start="838.32" dur="4.13">authorities so we got to educate</text>
  <text start="839.97" dur="6.72">ourselves about ourselves know thyself</text>
  <text start="842.45" dur="6.07">be your own doctor right understand</text>
  <text start="846.69" dur="3.78">these different herbs these different</text>
  <text start="848.52" dur="3.75">modalities how do we use them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="850.47" dur="3.72">very cheap they&amp;#39;re very effective okay</text>
  <text start="852.27" dur="4.32">peer through that Medical disinformation</text>
  <text start="854.19" dur="4.35">to find the truth and share that share</text>
  <text start="856.59" dur="3.72">that with your friends and family as</text>
  <text start="858.54" dur="4.05">much as you can of course you know you</text>
  <text start="860.31" dur="4.86">can only lead a horse to water you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="862.59" dur="5.96">make them drink it but share it when you</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="6.18">can and then more people will know about</text>
  <text start="868.55" dur="4.99">these sorts of things more people will</text>
  <text start="871.35" dur="4.71">start standing for their sovereign</text>
  <text start="873.54" dur="4.08">rights so I think it&amp;#39;s a bipartisan</text>
  <text start="876.06" dur="3.99">issue I think a lot of people can go</text>
  <text start="877.62" dur="4.26">yeah you know they might not be the most</text>
  <text start="880.05" dur="3.78">woke folk they might not be the most</text>
  <text start="881.88" dur="4.23">aware about what&amp;#39;s really going on in</text>
  <text start="883.83" dur="4.44">the world but I think just about anybody</text>
  <text start="886.11" dur="6.35">can agree that we should have the</text>
  <text start="888.27" dur="6.84">freedom and the right to do our own</text>
  <text start="892.46" dur="3.76">medical treatments to not get vaccinated</text>
  <text start="895.11" dur="2.4">if we don&amp;#39;t want to get back sedated</text>
  <text start="896.22" dur="2.76">there&amp;#39;s another forced medical</text>
  <text start="897.51" dur="3.09">intervention I didn&amp;#39;t really talk about</text>
  <text start="898.98" dur="3.54">in this video we should be able to</text>
  <text start="900.6" dur="5.31">choose what we do with our own damn</text>
  <text start="902.52" dur="7.319">bodies all right and our children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="905.91" dur="6.51">bodies so that&amp;#39;s that there you go folks</text>
  <text start="909.839" dur="4.951">forced medical intervention medical</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="4.71">kidnap incredibly infuriating topics yes</text>
  <text start="914.79" dur="3.75">they do happen but the more awareness we</text>
  <text start="917.13" dur="4.16">can spread about these things and the</text>
  <text start="918.54" dur="6">more we can learn about proper health</text>
  <text start="921.29" dur="4.72">period the more we can stop this stuff</text>
  <text start="924.54" dur="3.54">from happening thank you</text>
