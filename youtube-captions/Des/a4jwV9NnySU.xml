  <text start="23.49" dur="4.89">little bit from what I have been doing</text>
  <text start="25.08" dur="5.039">my niche is often seeing as being like a</text>

  <text start="32.489" dur="5.34">of people but I&amp;#39;ll be honest it gets a</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="3.18">little boring gets a little boring and</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="5.491">it gets a little repetitive and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="39.09" dur="6.6">only so much that I can do in a 10</text>
  <text start="43.32" dur="3.989">minute news video and there&amp;#39;s so much</text>

  <text start="55.05" dur="4.59">mix as you&amp;#39;ve already seen some</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.681">interviews throw in some videos much</text>

  <text start="61.17" dur="1.95">camera</text>

  <text start="63.12" dur="4.59">whiteboard videos that won&amp;#39;t be news but</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="4.741">we&amp;#39;re gonna expand we&amp;#39;re gonna expand</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="4.74">the content a little bit and in this one</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="4.86">what I&amp;#39;m going to discuss on is a</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="4.95">question or more so a request I got from</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="4.649">somebody and I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to do</text>
  <text start="77.4" dur="5.88">this for a little while now but her name</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="7.53">will say CJ CJ says I would love to see</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="6.57">you speak on cognitive dissonance we are</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="4.68">all capable of entertaining opposing</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="4.37">viewpoints and still functioning she</text>
  <text start="92.189" dur="6.871">says Hema she says it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="94.22" dur="7.56">intelligence great requests to speak on</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="6.69">cognitive dissonance this has been a</text>
  <text start="101.78" dur="6.1">meme or a concept that&amp;#39;s surfaced quite</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="4.619">a bit over the past couple weeks in my</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="5.58">life so I felt the need to answer this</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="4.651">question now cognitive dissonance of</text>
  <text start="113.46" dur="3.93">course there&amp;#39;s many ways I can go about</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="5.79">this but I&amp;#39;m really gonna boil it down</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="5.729">to the basics for somebody who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="4.47">know what it is I&amp;#39;ll speak on it and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="4.231">gonna discuss with you some things and</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="4.83">how to see if it shows up in people and</text>
  <text start="127.35" dur="6.48">also how to notice when it&amp;#39;s showing up</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="6.09">in you yourself so first cognitive</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s what the heck is it it&amp;#39;s a term</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="6.06">that as you venture into truth seeking</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="4.38">truth sharing conscious community</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="4.89">circles you&amp;#39;ll hear spring up quite a</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="6.54">bit so cognitive dissonance let&amp;#39;s break</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="6.03">that two-word term down into each of its</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="5.52">words let&amp;#39;s analyze it a little bit</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.98">cognitive your mind your brain space</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="4.79">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s referring to</text>
  <text start="158.16" dur="6.21">and then dissonance dissonance meaning</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="5.65">disharmony or some kind of internal</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="6.03">tension so cognitive dissonance is the</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="5.55">idea that you have a lot of disharmony</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="5.64">or tension going on up in your brain</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="8.059">space what causes it well what causes</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="7.71">cognitive dissonance is when you have a</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="5.921">specific belief system whether that</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="6.93">belief system was given to you by the</text>
  <text start="186.63" dur="6.93">education system by the media by your</text>
  <text start="190.68" dur="4.76">family you know or all the three no</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="5.459">matter how that belief system was</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="8.91">engrained into you when you encounter</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="7.861">information or a perspective or evidence</text>
  <text start="204.35" dur="5.2">contrary to that belief system that</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.43">you&amp;#39;re already ingrained into that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.55" dur="3.689">what causes that disharmony up in your</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="4.67">head because you don&amp;#39;t know which way to</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="7.621">go you know your whole life you&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="6.15">essentially is invested into this belief</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="6">systems that you thought was correct</text>
  <text start="223.13" dur="6.25">right so when you get this in this</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="3.629">information that completely goes against</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="4.38">that goes against the grain of</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="5.641">everything that you thought you knew it</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="4.29">causes some stuff to go on up here and</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s something that every single one of</text>
  <text start="238.05" dur="7.92">us has we deal with we&amp;#39;ve all dealt with</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="7.32">it and the easiest way to see if someone</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="6.09">is dealing with it is emotion if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="5.43">talking with somebody and I mean I could</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="4.44">use almost any example here I can say</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="3.15">vaccines chemtrails you know secret</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="3.72">space program where the heck but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="4.59">use vaccines for instance because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="3.99">very emotionally reactive topic causes a</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="3.74">lot of cognitive dissonance in people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="6.859">heads say</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="6.359">or a nurse or mom and you&amp;#39;re ingrained</text>
  <text start="271.069" dur="3.481">in the conventional way of thinking</text>
  <text start="272.719" dur="3.45">you think vaccines are a miracle of</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="3.989">modern medicine and you need them to</text>
  <text start="276.169" dur="5.87">avoid all these diseases that want to</text>
  <text start="278.539" dur="7.47">kill you right you encounter a</text>
  <text start="282.039" dur="8.68">documentary or somebody that&amp;#39;s passing</text>
  <text start="286.009" dur="7.771">you some information and you get mad and</text>
  <text start="290.719" dur="4.2">you get upset and you start attacking</text>
  <text start="293.78" dur="3.359">the messenger you start attacking the</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="3.84">person instead of even the information</text>
  <text start="297.139" dur="4.111">of the evidence that they brought you</text>
  <text start="298.759" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s usually how cognitive dissonance</text>
  <text start="301.25" dur="4.86">surfaces and how you can notice if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.069" dur="4.081">going on when you&amp;#39;re trying to share</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="3.839">your truths with somebody else that</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="3.269">cognitive dissonance will start</text>
  <text start="309.949" dur="2.52">surfacing and they&amp;#39;ll usually start</text>
  <text start="311.419" dur="4.61">attacking you they&amp;#39;ll start attacking</text>
  <text start="312.469" dur="6.391">the messenger instead of the message and</text>
  <text start="316.029" dur="4.57">it&amp;#39;s that is because their ego</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="3.329">constructs are getting checked you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.599" dur="4.051">checking their ego and they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="322.189" dur="5.22">that it gets very uncomfortable but you</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="7.049">gotta understand it&amp;#39;s a natural reaction</text>
  <text start="327.409" dur="6.69">and even if they&amp;#39;re coming at you for</text>
  <text start="331.699" dur="3.631">because they&amp;#39;re pissed off because you</text>
  <text start="334.099" dur="3.271">you know you&amp;#39;re just trying to share the</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="4.5">truth the truth is what it is you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="3.9">been to its will or you live a lie and a</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="2.97">lot of people are living that line they</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="3.959">want to continue living it which is why</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="5.16">they get uncomfortable they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="345.229" dur="4.44">be mad at you and that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="4.919">just a natural reaction you got to have</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="4.771">a detachment when it comes to truth</text>
  <text start="352.879" dur="3.78">sharing and this is what I&amp;#39;ve learned in</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="3.659">doing all these videos and talking to so</text>
  <text start="356.659" dur="3.63">many people is that there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="358.099" dur="4.59">attachment that has to take place and</text>
  <text start="360.289" dur="4.711">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you don&amp;#39;t love</text>
  <text start="362.689" dur="5.581">the person or care for them you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365" dur="4.979">caring for yourself in doing so okay</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="3.989">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of what you have to do</text>
  <text start="369.979" dur="5.521">until the person that you&amp;#39;re sharing the</text>
  <text start="372.259" dur="4.53">truth with is ready for it and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="2.669">want to say the truth let&amp;#39;s just say</text>
  <text start="376.789" dur="3.93">that perspective the contrary</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="5.97">perspective okay I don&amp;#39;t say truth and</text>
  <text start="380.719" dur="6">lock yourself into a box as if you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.139" dur="4.171">change your mind but when you share your</text>
  <text start="386.719" dur="3.211">perspective with somebody and they get</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="4.669">mad at you you got to understand that</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="6.329">everybody is on their own different</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="6.071">paths and they&amp;#39;re at different stages</text>
  <text start="396.259" dur="4.47">different levels of each path</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="4.589">there&amp;#39;s some detachment that needs to be</text>
  <text start="400.729" dur="5.4">had or at least understood that might be</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="5.071">necessary when sharing your truths</text>
  <text start="406.129" dur="3.78">okay that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a huge tip I can</text>
  <text start="408.71" dur="5.07">leave you with here that I&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="409.909" dur="8.85">and also understand right I mean this</text>
  <text start="413.78" dur="6.72">this goes into a discussion that is far</text>
  <text start="418.759" dur="3.511">you know far more in depth but it&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="3.389">you&amp;#39;re portraying your truth that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re bringing in a lawn right you can</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="2.49">get to know a person and connect with</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="2.519">them so they don&amp;#39;t have such an</text>
  <text start="426.379" dur="3.66">emotional reaction when you share your</text>
  <text start="427.759" dur="3.84">truth and you can kind of sell the ideas</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="4.051">to them in one way or another but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.599" dur="4.201">that&amp;#39;s another conversation so we</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="4.139">discussed cognitive dissonance we</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="6.119">discussed how it shows up in people and</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="5.731">what you can kind of do to shield</text>
  <text start="441.919" dur="5.071">yourself from that but also hold space</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="5.01">for somebody that is getting emotionally</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="4.25">reactive to it and the last thing I just</text>
  <text start="448.97" dur="5.49">want to touch on really quick here is</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="5.32">understand and try to become very self</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="5.459">aware in seeing when that cognitive</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="6.829">dissonance is showing up in you because</text>
  <text start="459.919" dur="7.111">it does it shows up in all of us and the</text>
  <text start="463.389" dur="6.101">the purpose that we&amp;#39;re here is to gain</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="4.439">self-awareness we have more awareness of</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="4.2">self we have more awareness of the world</text>
  <text start="471.469" dur="4.591">at hand so if you can notice when that</text>
  <text start="473.69" dur="4.44">cognitive dissonance is bubbling up in</text>
  <text start="476.06" dur="5.039">you and understand what to do with</text>
  <text start="478.13" dur="4.11">yourself when it happens then when</text>
  <text start="481.099" dur="2.85">somebody else is getting emotional</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="3.45">reactivity you because they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="483.949" dur="5.701">all this disharmony in tension in their</text>
  <text start="485.69" dur="5.729">brain then you really know how to handle</text>
  <text start="489.65" dur="2.91">them how to be compassionate with them</text>
  <text start="491.419" dur="3.24">because you understand how to handle</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="3.359">yourself so really you want to notice</text>
  <text start="494.659" dur="4.771">when that cognitive dissonance is</text>
  <text start="495.919" dur="5.34">arising in you and it&amp;#39;s as simple as do</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="4.16">you get triggered do you get triggered</text>
  <text start="501.259" dur="5.041">by anything else people say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.59" dur="5.079">contrary to what you&amp;#39;re saying right if</text>
  <text start="506.3" dur="4.859">you get triggered by what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="508.669" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s just words just opinions and</text>
  <text start="511.159" dur="3.091">perspectives and if you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="4.92">triggered by it well there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="4.229">disharmony going on in your head and you</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="5.239">got to realize that you got to</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="6.661">understand it and what you can do is</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="7.451">don&amp;#39;t get emotionally reactive but what</text>
  <text start="525.14" dur="5.389">you do is engage in a sure if you hear</text>
  <text start="530.18" dur="3.259">those</text>
  <text start="530.529" dur="9.781">footsteps we got some people with big</text>
  <text start="533.439" dur="9.81">feet here what you can do is then engage</text>
  <text start="540.31" dur="7.439">but you don&amp;#39;t engage from a combative</text>
  <text start="543.249" dur="7.371">state you engage in a state of well okay</text>
  <text start="547.749" dur="5.4">just ask a question continuing dialogue</text>
  <text start="550.62" dur="4.719">either one of two things will happen</text>
  <text start="553.149" dur="5.04">okay if you get any cognitive dissonance</text>
  <text start="555.339" dur="5.94">going on your head and instead of acting</text>
  <text start="558.189" dur="5.64">on that acting on that emotion or or you</text>
  <text start="561.279" dur="5.28">know letting that discomfort box you</text>
  <text start="563.829" dur="4.95">back in you learn to live with that</text>
  <text start="566.559" dur="3.57">discomfort right the comfort zone is a</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="4.35">beautiful place but nothing ever grows</text>
  <text start="570.129" dur="5.541">there so what you do is that you engage</text>
  <text start="573.129" dur="6.77">the person and you talk with them and</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="6.37">you come to find what the truth might be</text>
  <text start="579.899" dur="5.62">so either one of two things will happen</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="6.269">either a you&amp;#39;re going to learn something</text>
  <text start="585.519" dur="4.771">from them and that&amp;#39;ll be an opportunity</text>
  <text start="588.309" dur="6.15">for you to better yourself</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="6.18">granted it takes a grounded person and</text>
  <text start="594.459" dur="3.6">grounded ego not an imbalanced ego that</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="3.179">wants to revert but somebody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="598.059" dur="3.77">willing to change willing to alter</text>

  <text start="622.41" dur="6.099">communication skills with people right</text>
  <text start="624.879" dur="5.551">so that&amp;#39;s pretty much the only way I</text>

  <text start="630.43" dur="5.969">any cognitive dissonance happens in you</text>
  <text start="632.35" dur="6.06">or even in other people chill take a</text>

  <text start="647.829" dur="6.36">about it I don&amp;#39;t want say logically but</text>
  <text start="652.329" dur="3.151">if you go a ballad about it balanced if</text>
  <text start="654.189" dur="3.931">you&amp;#39;ve got about it grounded if you</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t go and back go about it very</text>

  <text start="661.42" dur="2.669">last couple minutes here but it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="663.339" dur="3.271">as if the</text>
  <text start="664.089" dur="3.901">that&amp;#39;d be want that cognitive distance</text>
  <text start="666.61" dur="3.3">to happen because it creates such a</text>
  <text start="667.99" dur="3.389">disconnect in people that don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="3.599">to handle their emotions and that are</text>
  <text start="671.379" dur="4.71">ungrounded so they want that cognitive</text>
  <text start="673.509" dur="4.74">dissonance so you truth sharer out there</text>
  <text start="676.089" dur="3.571">gets totally disconnected from everybody</text>
  <text start="678.249" dur="3.601">else who&amp;#39;s getting all tense up in their</text>
  <text start="679.66" dur="3.96">heads who&amp;#39;s flirting with the truth who</text>
  <text start="681.85" dur="3.539">wants to understand it but they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="683.62" dur="2.61">scared you don&amp;#39;t know how to communicate</text>

  <text start="691.42" dur="7.62"> show right hey we we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="696.399" dur="5.701">progress through these times and get the</text>
  <text start="699.04" dur="6">things exposed and disclosed and get the</text>
  <text start="702.1" dur="5.549">population mentally ready and accepting</text>
  <text start="705.04" dur="4.95">all of these deeper darker undisclosed</text>
  <text start="707.649" dur="4.16">unspoken truths if we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="709.99" dur="6.63">disconnected from each other right</text>
  <text start="711.809" dur="7.9">so I guess to finish up here</text>
  <text start="716.62" dur="5.579">you know cognitive dissonance internal</text>
  <text start="719.709" dur="4.531">tension in your in one&amp;#39;s head not your</text>

  <text start="739.99" dur="4.38">their relative truth</text>
  <text start="741.85" dur="4.77">their own individual perspective and the</text>
  <text start="744.37" dur="4.35">purpose here is to come as close as we</text>
  <text start="746.62" dur="5.759">can to that absolute truth as we</text>
  <text start="748.72" dur="6.02">possibly can but that might not happen</text>
  <text start="752.379" dur="5.07">and you got to be ok with that</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="6.67">but to get as too close to that absolute</text>
  <text start="757.449" dur="7.171">truth as possible get past your own</text>
  <text start="761.41" dur="5.099">cognitive dissonance get really good at</text>
  <text start="764.62" dur="3.24">seeing where cognitive dissonance is</text>

  <text start="780.639" dur="4.11">that they&amp;#39;re going to be able to accept</text>
  <text start="782.309" dur="4.931">and if we can all do that and come</text>
  <text start="784.749" dur="6.75">together and actually connect as human</text>
