  <text start="6.68" dur="4.57">internet trolls are an interesting breed</text>
  <text start="9.389" dur="3.511">you see over the past couple weeks I</text>
  <text start="11.25" dur="4.08">made reference to the Gerson Therapy</text>
  <text start="12.9" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s a natural healing modality in</text>
  <text start="15.33" dur="4.56">various talks and videos of mine and</text>
  <text start="17.43" dur="4.679">these pesky internet trolls whatever</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="5.399">their motive is have tried to use this</text>
  <text start="22.109" dur="4.92">as a way to discredit me keyword try</text>
  <text start="25.289" dur="3.75">really what they&amp;#39;re doing is making</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.32">themselves look like blithering idiots</text>
  <text start="29.039" dur="3.93">that don&amp;#39;t have any idea of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="2.64">talking about so in this video we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="2.61">going to talk about the Gerson Therapy</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="4.471">we&amp;#39;re gonna make them look like fools</text>
  <text start="35.579" dur="4.5">and hopefully I&amp;#39;m going to offer you</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="3.27">some information that could potentially</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="3.48">change your life</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="3.48">it couldn&amp;#39;t should if you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="4.59">about the Gerson Therapy so let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="45.21" dur="5.64">about it what is it it&amp;#39;s probably one of</text>
  <text start="48.149" dur="4.081">my favorite alternative healing methods</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="4.229">to talk about because of how</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="5.849">comprehensive it is it really goes for</text>
  <text start="55.079" dur="6.811">the root cause of degenerative disease</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="8.251">and that is nutrition and toxicity</text>
  <text start="61.89" dur="6.15">first of all nutrition there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="5.609">different nutrients that your body</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="5.579">requires to function not just wants to</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="3.54">function it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;ll help a</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="4.201">little bit they need them it&amp;#39;s like gas</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="5.791">in your car your body is a machine it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="6.42">not gonna work without the proper fluids</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="5.099">proper compounds it needs to upgrate on</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="5.19">so you have a bunch of essential fatty</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="5.64">acids you have essential amino acids you</text>
  <text start="89.43" dur="4.53">have enzymes probiotics all kinds of</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="4.921">different vitamins and minerals and</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="5.49">trace minerals etc etc so what the</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="5.61">Gerson Therapy does is that it floods</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="5.37">your body with a shitload of these</text>
  <text start="102.54" dur="6.45">micronutrients and number two</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="6.39">toxicity again enough can&amp;#39;t be said</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="5.01">about how many toxins there are in our</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="5.699">environment that we inject into us that</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.59">we willingly and unknowingly spread all</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="3.81">over our bodies that are sprayed over</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="4.169">our heads that we eat and drink cetera</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="4.171">et cetera think the EPA has somewhere of</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.71">like seventy to eighty thousand</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="4.77">registered industrial carcinogens</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="4.02">carcinogen meaning cancer-causing and</text>
  <text start="129.66" dur="2.44">these are just a registered ones I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="2.081">sure there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.1" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t register probably because</text>
  <text start="133.57" dur="5.01">they don&amp;#39;t want to so malnutrition and</text>
  <text start="136.33" dur="4.26">toxicity the Gerson Therapy truly goes</text>
  <text start="138.58" dur="4.22">for those two things and even if you</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="5.82">just understand that basic concept of</text>
  <text start="142.8" dur="6.79">nutrients and toxicity and apply that to</text>
  <text start="146.41" dur="5.97">your life without even doing a official</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="4.5">Gerson Therapy diet it&amp;#39;ll just help you</text>
  <text start="152.38" dur="3.12">a whole bunch that&amp;#39;s why this is one of</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="3.36">my favorite things to talk about just</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="4.71">because of that concept right there eat</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="5.46">four nutrients micro nutrients don&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="160.21" dur="5.46">four protein fat carbs eat four vitamins</text>
  <text start="162.91" dur="4.65">minerals enzymes probiotics trace</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="4.74">minerals etc you&amp;#39;ll be a whole lot</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="5.04">healthier higher functioning higher</text>
  <text start="170.41" dur="4.47">performing and then really be conscious</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="5.66">of the toxins in your environment how</text>
  <text start="174.88" dur="7.08">you&amp;#39;re living chemical toxins</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="6.58">electromagnetic toxins various other</text>
  <text start="181.96" dur="6.09">detrimental things again without let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="5.22">talk about dr. max Gerson so dr. max</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="4.67">Gerson the formulator of this Gerson</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="8.43">Therapy was a doctor who was born in</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="9.85">early 1918 OS actually in Europe and in</text>
  <text start="198.49" dur="5.91">the early 1900&amp;#39;s he began studying soil</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="4.14">actually when he was in grade school and</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="5.28">as he went to college he was fascinated</text>
  <text start="206.71" dur="5.61">with soil and he studied how plants</text>
  <text start="209.68" dur="4.77">needed back to the nutrition and</text>
  <text start="212.32" dur="4.98">toxicity the right nutrients and the</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="5.31">right kind of soil conditions to become</text>
  <text start="217.3" dur="4.14">healthy plants he was also interested in</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="5.1">the health of the human being so he took</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="5.76">his study of the soil and then began</text>
  <text start="224.86" dur="4.34">applying it to the human as he went into</text>
  <text start="227.2" dur="5.22">later stages of college he went into</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="5.2">health and medicine study and he really</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="5.34">began applying these concepts to the</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="5.85">human now while he was studying and in</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="6.66">the early stages of practicing as a</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="6.24">doctor he created a diet to heal his own</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="3.98">migraines he had debilitating migraines</text>
  <text start="246.49" dur="4.31">and he began playing around</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="5.47">experimenting with his own self and</text>
  <text start="250.8" dur="6.58">found a particular diet that made his</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="5.9">migraines go away and he was like huh</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="4.86">this made my migraines go away what if I</text>
  <text start="259.77" dur="5.2">tried it on some other things and he</text>
  <text start="262.24" dur="4.68">began experimenting with page</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="6.06">who were basically the throw away</text>
  <text start="266.92" dur="5.85">patients where mainstream medicine the</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="3.9">other doctors who were practicing more</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="3.99">allopathic drug based medicine rather</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="3.45">than his diet based medicine they were</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="3.3">with all the throw aways that wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="6.69">work with allopath II he took him in and</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="7.74">he used this diet with the people who</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="4.56">were gonna die and found great success</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.32">with it again Wow</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="4.71">healed that person&amp;#39;s kidney issues the</text>
  <text start="292.12" dur="4.5">hill of that person&amp;#39;s you know this</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="5.52">disease that disease and it got to a</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="4.47">point where he began experimenting with</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="2.64">his diet so much that&amp;#39;s the thing these</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="3.54">days you know so many doctors and</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="4.28">scientists are caught up in theory and</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="3.72">all this jargon when they don&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.81">practice or</text>
  <text start="308.35" dur="7.74">apply anymore well Gerson was applying</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="7.71">and he began applying his diet to skin</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="5.82">tuberculosis now this was a point in the</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="5.55">1920s and early 30s where skin</text>
  <text start="321.91" dur="5.07">tuberculosis was rampant and there was</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="7.65">no no known cure for it at the time</text>
  <text start="326.98" dur="8.4">so dr. Gerson essentially healed skin</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="5.64">tuberculosis with his diet and the word</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="5.63">began spreading and eventually the word</text>
  <text start="338.14" dur="4.98">got to a man named dr. Albert Schweitzer</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="3.94">you see this was very important because</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="4.56">dr. Albert Schweitzer was a very</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="6.69">renowned doctor he actually won a Nobel</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="6.989">Prize and dr. Gerson used his diet to</text>
  <text start="351.64" dur="6">heal dr. Albert Schweitzer&amp;#39;s wife of</text>
  <text start="354.669" dur="4.531">skin TB and then dr. Albert Schweitzer</text>
  <text start="357.64" dur="3.18">was like holy crap he tried the diet I</text>
  <text start="359.2" dur="3.42">think it got rid of his I think he had</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="6.02">migraines to got rid of Schweitzer as</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="7.98">migraines but this essentially created a</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="5.77">huge popularity boom with dr. max Gerson</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="3.99">because a bunch of journals begins</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="5.15">publishing his diet it could heal skin</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="5.52">TB I think it became the world&amp;#39;s first</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="4.6">documented cure for skin tuberculosis</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="5.1">and he also gained a lifelong friend in</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="6.45">a Nobel prize-winning dr. Albert</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="6.36">Schweitzer so early 30s boom his diet</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="5.88">became wildly successful he perfected it</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="6.15">but also in the 1930s we had World War</text>
  <text start="394.69" dur="8.58">two going on in Europe so dr. Gerson</text>
  <text start="397.72" dur="7.75">immigrated to America mid late 1930s to</text>
  <text start="403.27" dur="4.57">escape the Nazis over there in Germany</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="4.919">and once he got into America he began</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="5.639">practicing as a doctor in New York got</text>
  <text start="410.389" dur="5.611">his license began opened a clinic began</text>
  <text start="413.479" dur="5.461">using his diet with patients and again</text>
  <text start="416" dur="7.74">the word spread again but of course over</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="7.74">here in America during the 1940s we had</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="4.56">the American Mafia association Medical</text>
  <text start="426.68" dur="3.69">Association whichever one it is</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="4.83">they began of course expanding their</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="5.28">tentacles of control and people began</text>
  <text start="433.13" dur="4.68">hearing about dr. max Gerson s diet and</text>
  <text start="435.65" dur="5.4">what he was doing and the big pharma</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="5.34">eyes were on him and they vilified him</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="5.94">they pulled his license they prevented</text>
  <text start="443.15" dur="5.67">him from publishing his research and he</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="4.17">was just suppressed he was persecuted</text>
  <text start="448.82" dur="4.469">now funny enough though during this time</text>
  <text start="451.16" dur="4.02">dr. max Gerson even testified in front</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="3.75">of Congress he brought some of his</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="4.799">patients to a Congressional subcommittee</text>
  <text start="457.039" dur="5.371">and said hey guys look at here i frickin</text>
  <text start="459.979" dur="4.44">healed these people that mainstream</text>
  <text start="462.41" dur="3.9">medicine said was gonna die with just</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="3.991">frickin fruits and vegetables and soups</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="5.31">in a diet something so simple so easy</text>
  <text start="468.41" dur="8.129">well of course you know the deep state</text>
  <text start="471.62" dur="8.25">the FDA Big Pharma medical mafia still</text>
  <text start="476.539" dur="5.431">didn&amp;#39;t budge and with control the media</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="5.22">of course by the same entities word of</text>
  <text start="481.97" dur="5.069">that went nowhere and turns out dr. max</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="7.04">Gerson ended up passing away</text>
  <text start="487.039" dur="7.261">I believe in 1958 mid to late 50s and</text>
  <text start="492.13" dur="5.2">according to some reports they found</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="6.75">arsenic in his blood when he passed away</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="6.959">so don&amp;#39;t know if this is a case of deep</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="5.39">state suiciding but you can connect the</text>
  <text start="504.289" dur="6.75">dots and of course it&amp;#39;s plausible</text>
  <text start="506.44" dur="7.42">probable yes and yes so that&amp;#39;s the life</text>
  <text start="511.039" dur="5.461">of dr. max Gerson how he went about</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="5.79">formulating this diet and spreading it</text>
  <text start="516.5" dur="6.69">and getting it popular and of course his</text>
  <text start="519.65" dur="7.11">ultimate demise now we still have a lot</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="4.95">of people carrying on his legacy we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="2.34">talk about that in a sec but I just want</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="1.84">to make a couple notes about what</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="4.359">exactly this</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="6.63">consists of so number one lots and lots</text>
  <text start="533.459" dur="5.401">of juicing if you&amp;#39;re in dire stages of</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="4.5">degenerative disease we&amp;#39;re talking a lot</text>
  <text start="538.86" dur="5.46">of juice like pounds of carrot juice a</text>
  <text start="541.11" dur="6.27">day and a whole host of other different</text>
  <text start="544.32" dur="5.04">soup recipes and a lot of raw foods</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="4.8">because of course raw food carries much</text>
  <text start="549.36" dur="4.89">more lifeforce to you much more</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="5.159">electricity to you than cooked</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="5.279">vegetables do but cooking unlocked some</text>
  <text start="557.339" dur="4.86">enzymatic activity and food so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="559.529" dur="6">mixture of some cooked foods some raw</text>
  <text start="562.199" dur="4.801">foods but like I said lots of it</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="3.091">flooding your body with all those</text>
  <text start="567" dur="3.12">micronutrients helping your body</text>
  <text start="568.62" dur="4.26">detoxify itself</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="4.92">number two speaking of those toxins no</text>
  <text start="572.88" dur="5.009">alcohol no tobacco</text>
  <text start="575.04" dur="5.64">I believe it&amp;#39;s no caffeine as well</text>
  <text start="577.889" dur="4.56">really any kind of toxins or poisons</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="3.81">going into your body so that&amp;#39;s why this</text>
  <text start="582.449" dur="4.351">therapy is great because you become</text>
  <text start="584.49" dur="5.099">conscious and aware of your lifestyle</text>
  <text start="586.8" dur="5.67">right what kind of hygiene products</text>
  <text start="589.589" dur="6.091">you&amp;#39;re using what kind of other fumes</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="5.489">you round or what you&amp;#39;re doing to your</text>
  <text start="595.68" dur="5.339">environment etc etc so you really become</text>
  <text start="597.959" dur="4.951">aware that&amp;#39;s what I like to say</text>
  <text start="601.019" dur="7.38">sometimes the cure to cancer is</text>
  <text start="602.91" dur="8.039">awareness that&amp;#39;s it and then third costs</text>
  <text start="608.399" dur="6.151">of coffee enemas in dire stages so</text>
  <text start="610.949" dur="5.88">coffee enema meeting yes coffee up your</text>
  <text start="614.55" dur="4.92">rectum but coffee ass coffee</text>
  <text start="616.829" dur="4.081">some people like to say but this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="3.15">something to ridicule because if you</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="4.919">actually study the science behind it if</text>
  <text start="622.62" dur="6.449">you take a coffee enema literally just</text>
  <text start="625.829" dur="6">brew it use organic and put it up there</text>
  <text start="629.069" dur="4.561">it stimulates you the bile production in</text>
  <text start="631.829" dur="3.531">your liver and it&amp;#39;s like a flush for</text>
  <text start="633.63" dur="4.8">your liver so it&amp;#39;s one of the most</text>
  <text start="635.36" dur="6.099">detoxifying things that you can do for</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="4.409">yourself is the caffeine not having to</text>
  <text start="641.459" dur="4.5">go through your digestive tract but</text>
  <text start="642.839" dur="5.461">straight straight in your liver flushes</text>
  <text start="645.959" dur="4.62">it out now of course you can do this</text>
