  <text start="9.84" dur="3.69">particular video I&amp;#39;m gonna answer a</text>
  <text start="11.61" dur="4.229">question from a patreon supporter of</text>
  <text start="13.53" dur="4.74">mine thank you very much brother man his</text>
  <text start="15.839" dur="5.041">name is Mike and Mike asked if you had</text>
  <text start="18.27" dur="4.83">the red pill somebody on the SSP on the</text>
  <text start="20.88" dur="4.71">secret space program in five minutes</text>
  <text start="23.1" dur="5.61">what would be your strongest pitch now</text>
  <text start="25.59" dur="5.009">this is a very good idea for a question</text>
  <text start="28.71" dur="4.11">for me to answer because when we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="30.599" dur="4.081">normal everyday conversation and the</text>
  <text start="32.82" dur="3.6">opportunity arises to pass along some</text>
  <text start="34.68" dur="3.21">knowledge to somebody to try to help</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="2.88">wake them up you&amp;#39;re not gonna have much</text>
  <text start="37.89" dur="3.12">time to do that you&amp;#39;re not gonna be able</text>
  <text start="39.3" dur="3.99">to bust out your laptop scroll through</text>
  <text start="41.01" dur="4.41">your bookmarks or log into the YouTube</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="3.69">app type in string the illusion of it</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="3">you know you know I&amp;#39;m saying so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="3.239">gonna have to be something that comes</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="4.229">off the top of the dome in the heat of</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="4.59">the moment and conversation and very</text>
  <text start="52.649" dur="4.741">simple for you to be able to make a</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="4.73">compelling argument for yourself so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="57.39" dur="5.34">gonna just offer you some very basic</text>
  <text start="59.539" dur="6.37">pieces of data that you can remember and</text>
  <text start="62.73" dur="6.209">that looks very good to them and I might</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="4.651">even make this into a running series</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="3.391">where I do this on various topics but in</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="4.77">this particular one we want to prove</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="5.969">that secret space programs exist that</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="4.469">there are projects out there that very</text>
  <text start="78.299" dur="4.14">much exist that we haven&amp;#39;t been told</text>
  <text start="79.799" dur="4.951">about and that have a lot of money and</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="6.661">very advanced technologies that have</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="6.45">funneled into them so in mind you real</text>
  <text start="89.1" dur="4.62">quick to note before I get into this</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="5.3">particular information and this goes for</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="5.579">any concept out there SSP health stuff</text>
  <text start="96.5" dur="4.96">political corruption of whatnot you also</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="2.761">have to realize where they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="4.5">from</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="5.669">so say you offer them some information</text>
  <text start="105.96" dur="3.659">that&amp;#39;s too deep too quick they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="3.481">gonna get cognitive dissonance and you</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="4.231">know run away and call you crazy</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="4.68">so you want to offer information that</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.58">still has some rank mainstream relevance</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="4.95">say they type it in they&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="118.43" dur="3.91">Wikipedia information maybe some sources</text>
  <text start="120.84" dur="3.18">from mainstream media that they can</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="4.77">still fight with but there might be</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="6.269">articles from more alternative sources</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="5.28">that pop up to the top or some</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="2.731">information there that will still expand</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="2.88">their thinking</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="4.5">that will still push the envelope past</text>
  <text start="135.27" dur="3.99">the mind control programming that</text>
  <text start="137.52" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re ingrained with so you just want</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="3.33">to be really easy with how you go about</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="3.6">it and then as they get more and more</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="4.5">open-minded you can start offering them</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="4.59">some deeper and deeper info and key</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="4.23">words and whatnot but in this particular</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="3.6">issue to prove secret space programs</text>
  <text start="151.32" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;re going to go through three things</text>
  <text start="152.52" dur="3.57">right here number two and three you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="3.48">pretty linked so you can kind of talk</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="5.01">about these things at the same time to</text>
  <text start="157.74" dur="5.55">help prop both of them up but number one</text>
  <text start="161.1" dur="4.38">here is Gary McKinnon so if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.86">familiar with who Gary McKinnon is he</text>
  <text start="165.48" dur="6.75">was a hacker based out of the UK in the</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="7.02">early 2000s and he became aware of the</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="6.12">work of the disclosure project Stephen</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="5.46">Greer&amp;#39;s initiative where whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="178.35" dur="4.62">and insiders were offering their</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="5.01">testimony about secret government</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="4.92">projects and UFO cover-ups and the</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="3.84">technologies associated with that so</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="3.15">when he became familiar with the</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="4.05">disclosure project he wanted to find</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="5.22">legit evidence of government cover-up</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="5.61">and his technology so he actually hacked</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="7.68">into US military and NASA government</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="7.71">computer and NASA computers in 2000 and</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="5.07">2001 and he found legit evidence of</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="4.98">secret space programs he found evidence</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="5.55">of a naval secret space program called</text>
  <text start="211.83" dur="5.4">solar Wharton and according to his</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="6.93">testimony he saw documents that said</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="5.91">fleet to fleet transfers with names of</text>
  <text start="221.49" dur="3.06">officers it would even say you know</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="4.11">Colonel lieutenant colonel of their rank</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="5.31">and then he had another document that</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="4.32">discussed or that was the one that said</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="3">non-terrestrial officers excuse me and</text>
  <text start="231.57" dur="3.36">then there was one that said fleet to</text>
  <text start="232.86" dur="4.8">fleet transfers with the names of ships</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="4.17">USS this US has this and he had never</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="3.6">heard of these names before so he</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="4.74">cross-referenced those names with the</text>
  <text start="241.26" dur="4.53">publicly available names of the water</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="5.869">based Navy ships and there was no match</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="6.51">between them that he could see so this</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="4.601">testimony is legit it&amp;#39;s there you type</text>
  <text start="252.3" dur="3.96">it in Wikipedia articles will come up I</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="4.29">think there was even a Huffington Post</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="3.78">article written about him I&amp;#39;ll link that</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="3">down below something you could you know</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="4.02">bookmark real quick maybe to send to</text>
  <text start="261.6" dur="5.11">people so it&amp;#39;s all there and his story</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="5.5">even gained worldwide recognition</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="4.59">even his issue once he was arrested</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="4.65">found out what he did and he was</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="5.16">arrested his story went into the UK</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="6.09">Parliament even reached those levels I</text>
  <text start="276.46" dur="7.32">believe it was a Pink Floyd member that</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="4.77">wrote a song about him for activism to</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="3.449">support his issue</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="3.96">so that&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ll also see that and</text>
  <text start="287.229" dur="3.901">they&amp;#39;ll see like wow there was a serious</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="3.9">attempt to suppress this guy and people</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="3.24">became known about it it was said that</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="3.57">his hack was the biggest hack of all</text>
  <text start="294.37" dur="4.079">time and you know why would there be</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="4.83">suppression and so much backing of him</text>
  <text start="298.449" dur="4.47">if it wasn&amp;#39;t legit so very good just</text>
  <text start="301.33" dur="3.63">simple thing you could pass along in a</text>
  <text start="302.919" dur="3.601">quick five minutes to get people to</text>
  <text start="304.96" dur="3.9">understand like wow secret space</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="4.11">programs exist and it&amp;#39;s really cool that</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="3.839">he even found evidence of this</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="3.87">particular one solar warden the u.s.</text>
  <text start="312.699" dur="4.261">naval program because that could lead</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="4.77">into some further rabbit holes for them</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="3.75">and now let&amp;#39;s get into number two and</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="4.05">three and like I said these ones are</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="6.239">pretty linked here number two is missing</text>
  <text start="323.32" dur="5.43">money and number three is the classified</text>
  <text start="326.949" dur="5.131">technology in these projects and when</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="5.699">you really lay out how much money and</text>
  <text start="332.08" dur="5.579">the timeline that it&amp;#39;s been swiped from</text>
  <text start="334.449" dur="5.96">us through the Pentagon and then the</text>
  <text start="337.659" dur="5.431">classified technology and you know these</text>
  <text start="340.409" dur="4.181">groups these factions these elite</text>
  <text start="343.09" dur="3.329">whatever you want to call them they got</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="4.319">this technology and then the money</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="3.81">started getting siphoned out and whatnot</text>
  <text start="348.909" dur="3.121">when you lay these two things out for</text>
  <text start="350.229" dur="4.021">them build the timeline it really kind</text>
  <text start="352.03" dur="3.75">of shows I&amp;#39;m like wow there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.25" dur="3.33">money that have gone into these things</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="4.29">so what do they really have you know and</text>
  <text start="357.58" dur="4.47">when talking about the missing money</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s three particular dots that you</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="6.03">can show them that will help them see</text>
  <text start="365.02" dur="4.829">the timeline and how much money has been</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="4.35">taken through the Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="4.471">so number one talk about Donald Rumsfeld</text>
  <text start="372.43" dur="3.57">in 2001 they&amp;#39;ll be able to type this</text>
  <text start="374.32" dur="4.74">into YouTube and see his testimony and</text>
  <text start="376" dur="4.83">see even like CBS reports I think that</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="4.109">we&amp;#39;re talking about it in the early</text>
  <text start="380.83" dur="5.369">2000s but Donald Rumsfeld the day before</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="6">9/11 testified in front of Congress to</text>
  <text start="386.199" dur="6.301">two point three trillion dollars that</text>
  <text start="389.169" dur="5.941">were found missing from the Pentagon in</text>
  <text start="392.5" dur="5.13">as a matter of a few years near the end</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="5.489">of the 90s and early 2000s two point</text>
  <text start="397.63" dur="5.339">three trillion and that was report</text>
  <text start="400.599" dur="5.25">in the mainstream but of course the next</text>
  <text start="402.969" dur="6.75">day 9/11 happened a lot of people forgot</text>
  <text start="405.849" dur="8.31">about that and here we are 17 years</text>
  <text start="409.719" dur="6.15">later so this will also open up the idea</text>
  <text start="414.159" dur="3.331">for them you know 9/11 Wow maybe there</text>
  <text start="415.869" dur="3.72">was some cover-ups to distract us and</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="4.5">whatnot so again it&amp;#39;ll open up a couple</text>
  <text start="419.589" dur="4.41">more avenues for them to research but</text>
  <text start="421.99" dur="4.469">yeah he&amp;#39;ll see the 2.3 trillion and say</text>
  <text start="423.999" dur="4.771">oh that&amp;#39;s a lot of money right and then</text>
  <text start="426.459" dur="7.23">you can tell them about well look into</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="7.949">now so and now in 2015 what 14 years</text>
  <text start="433.689" dur="4.891">after that 2015 a Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="436.719" dur="5.85">Inspector General report came out</text>
  <text start="438.58" dur="6.569">detailing that the account of I think</text>
  <text start="442.569" dur="5.19">was missin something that they</text>
  <text start="445.149" dur="5.01">particularly labeled it as is now up to</text>
  <text start="447.759" dur="4.74">two point six point five excuse me six</text>
  <text start="450.159" dur="5.88">point five trillion out of the</text>
  <text start="452.499" dur="6.12">Department of Defense so Wow just you</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="5.97">know decade and a half that nearly</text>
  <text start="458.619" dur="6.061">triple six point five trillion what</text>
  <text start="462.009" dur="5.34">could they build with six point five</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="5.37">trillion various unacknowledged projects</text>
  <text start="467.349" dur="4.951">in the corporation&amp;#39;s and you know</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="6.679">military intelligence circles Wow six</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="7.549">point five trillion and then you can</text>
  <text start="476.729" dur="4.84">really helm at home if they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="479.849" dur="3.82">understanding that a lot of money is</text>
  <text start="481.569" dur="3.72">missing and believing you you can</text>
  <text start="483.669" dur="5.071">mention that that number is very well</text>
  <text start="485.289" dur="6.99">could be up to 20 trillion plus now and</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="5.489">you can reference the recent looking</text>
  <text start="492.279" dur="4.62">into this by I believe it was a Michigan</text>
  <text start="494.229" dur="4.5">State University professor and he had a</text>
  <text start="496.899" dur="4.41">ex government official and a team of</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="4.201">students around him and they they saw</text>
  <text start="501.309" dur="3.241">this and they saw this information and</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="4.889">they studied it and they found wow our</text>
  <text start="504.55" dur="4.769">count is actually up to 20 trillion so</text>
  <text start="507.819" dur="4.35">again I&amp;#39;ll link all these down below so</text>
  <text start="509.319" dur="5.25">you can maybe even send that to people</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="4.081">on bookmark and whatnot so that lays out</text>
  <text start="514.569" dur="4.62">the timeline of Wow in just a few</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="6.329">decades there&amp;#39;s a lot of money that was</text>
  <text start="519.189" dur="5.281">taken and also to note really quick one</text>
  <text start="522.579" dur="4.26">pop-culture reference you can throw in</text>
  <text start="524.47" dur="4.669">there to help them paint the clip</text>
  <text start="526.839" dur="5.55">picture clear a little more so is</text>
  <text start="529.139" dur="3.89">Independence Day so in the 1995 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.389" dur="3.43">the FIR</text>
  <text start="533.029" dur="6.691">Independence Day there was a scene when</text>

  <text start="546.62" dur="2.699">disclosure in that movie night I just</text>
  <text start="547.759" dur="2.911">think about it he was taken to the</text>
  <text start="549.319" dur="2.731">underground base he was like wow he had</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="3.269">never been read in on it before he&amp;#39;d</text>

  <text start="577.699" dur="3.87">audited there&amp;#39;s one going on now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="4.38">another something else where you talk</text>
  <text start="581.569" dur="5.911">about but point being here that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="584.6" dur="5.099">they siphon his money when they make</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="4.649">their proposals they say they need a lot</text>
  <text start="589.699" dur="3.841">for these very cheap items and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="592.129" dur="5.491">lot of money there that&amp;#39;s just sitting</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="5.789">that then gets funneled somewhere you</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="3.18">have an idea where it gets funnel but</text>
  <text start="599.329" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s just something you can mention</text>
  <text start="600.8" dur="4.349">really quick to help them see it and</text>
  <text start="602.629" dur="5.01">laugh and whatnot sometimes laughing the</text>
  <text start="605.149" dur="4.711">truth off is the best way to pound at</text>
  <text start="607.639" dur="4.731">home into somebody but missing money and</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="6.719">now let&amp;#39;s go into classified technology</text>
  <text start="612.37" dur="7.509">so classified technology this begins in</text>
  <text start="616.579" dur="4.651">the 1950s is where you can start this</text>
  <text start="619.879" dur="3.75">actually before we get into the</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="4.919">classified technology mention this right</text>
  <text start="623.629" dur="5.491">here the invention secrecy act so this</text>
  <text start="626.149" dur="6.63">was started in the 1950s 1951 but this</text>
  <text start="629.12" dur="6.389">details how that the government really</text>
  <text start="632.779" dur="4.86">does keep technology secret and classify</text>
  <text start="635.509" dur="4.921">patents so the invention secrecy act was</text>
  <text start="637.639" dur="4.94">made in 1951 and basically any branch of</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="5.43">government State Department Navy</text>
  <text start="642.579" dur="6.61">intelligence agency what not they can</text>
  <text start="645.86" dur="7.68">classify a patent top-secret probably</text>
  <text start="649.189" dur="7.02">hire them top-secret if it go or if it</text>
  <text start="653.54" dur="4.229">would be a matter of national security</text>
  <text start="656.209" dur="4.141">is how it&amp;#39;s technically termed of course</text>
  <text start="657.769" dur="4.92">national security very broad blanket</text>
  <text start="660.35" dur="4.079">term right there but if they find that</text>
  <text start="662.689" dur="3.721">it&amp;#39;s a matter of national security they</text>
  <text start="664.429" dur="3.691">can classify any patent secret</text>
  <text start="666.41" dur="4.409">so of course that&amp;#39;s very vague they can</text>
  <text start="668.12" dur="7.32">do that with many patents whatever they</text>
  <text start="670.819" dur="6.841">want and since 1951 there is now 6,000</text>
  <text start="675.44" dur="4.53">this is documented six thousand patents</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="4.31">could even be a couple more thousand</text>
  <text start="679.97" dur="4.32">than that but somewhere in that range of</text>
  <text start="681.97" dur="3.58">classified patents and it&amp;#39;s been said</text>
  <text start="684.29" dur="3.899">that most of these have to do with</text>
  <text start="685.55" dur="4.229">energy creation technology the</text>
  <text start="688.189" dur="4.101">zero-point energy technology possibly</text>
  <text start="689.779" dur="4.651">even anti-gravity we&amp;#39;ll talk about that</text>
  <text start="692.29" dur="4.419">some of the researchers and the ones</text>
  <text start="694.43" dur="3.329">that have their stuff classified in a</text>
  <text start="696.709" dur="3.75">set here but yeah</text>
  <text start="697.759" dur="5.791">a lot of patents classified top-secret</text>
  <text start="700.459" dur="7.5">and deeper by the invention secrecy act</text>
  <text start="703.55" dur="6.75">in 1951 boom lay that out for them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="707.959" dur="3.841">gonna open some windows right there and</text>
  <text start="710.3" dur="5.339">now let&amp;#39;s talk about some suppressed</text>
  <text start="711.8" dur="5.76">scientists so you can stick to the same</text>
  <text start="715.639" dur="5.25">time frame and say hey invention secrecy</text>
  <text start="717.56" dur="6.089">act 1951 and in the 1950s there was a</text>
  <text start="720.889" dur="5.31">dude named T Townsend Brown and of</text>
  <text start="723.649" dur="4.651">course Tesla can&amp;#39;t forget Tesla you know</text>
  <text start="726.199" dur="4.5">throw him in there but T Townsend Brown</text>
  <text start="728.3" dur="6.089">in particular to secret space program</text>
  <text start="730.699" dur="6.39">research in the early 1900s and</text>
  <text start="734.389" dur="4.411">especially in the 1940s and 50s he was</text>
  <text start="737.089" dur="4.62">doing a research into literal</text>
  <text start="738.8" dur="5.01">anti-gravity more specifically termed</text>
  <text start="741.709" dur="4.141">electrogravitics so you can throw that</text>
  <text start="743.81" dur="3.81">term on to somebody you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="745.85" dur="3.45">wake up so you can sound more legit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="747.62" dur="3.899">not anti-gravity it&amp;#39;s electro critics</text>
  <text start="749.3" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;re actually different so he was</text>
  <text start="751.519" dur="5.49">doing research into electrogravitics and</text>
  <text start="753.199" dur="5.281">how when he took metal flying saucers or</text>
  <text start="757.009" dur="3.241">anything that had a crystalline</text>
  <text start="758.48" dur="5.82">structure in the matter that composed it</text>
  <text start="760.25" dur="9.54">and he put a high-voltage electrostatic</text>
  <text start="764.3" dur="8.389">shock into a metal saucer shape it would</text>
  <text start="769.79" dur="5.669">float and he could create levitation and</text>
  <text start="772.689" dur="6.041">propulsion with just electricity in a</text>
  <text start="775.459" dur="7.411">metal disc and his research was then</text>
  <text start="778.73" dur="5.279">classified by the Navy and you know</text>
  <text start="782.87" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s interesting a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="784.009" dur="4.041">think Navy when they think of space they</text>
  <text start="786.68" dur="7.74">think of airforce and whatnot but</text>
  <text start="788.05" dur="11.2">actually a navy is much more apt to go</text>
  <text start="794.42" dur="5.6">into space because you have a submarine</text>
  <text start="799.25" dur="2.63">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="800.02" dur="3.72">in that shape that can accompany an</text>
  <text start="801.88" dur="4.95">electric rhythmic drive and really easy</text>
  <text start="803.74" dur="4.5">and whatnot and the people that are</text>
  <text start="806.83" dur="4.17">trained in the Navy are trained</text>
  <text start="808.24" dur="6">particularly for long missions in a</text>
  <text start="811" dur="6.149">contained area and a contained ship so</text>
  <text start="814.24" dur="5.039">it&amp;#39;s just you know Navy usually has the</text>
  <text start="817.149" dur="5.491">upper hand actually over the air force</text>
  <text start="819.279" dur="5.581">when it comes to space projects but in</text>
  <text start="822.64" dur="4.23">regards to the classified technology EFT</text>
  <text start="824.86" dur="4.61">Townsend Brown doing that research into</text>
  <text start="826.87" dur="5.4">flying disks floating disk he had some</text>
  <text start="829.47" dur="6.34">patents awarded to his name you can also</text>
  <text start="832.27" dur="6.06">say they can look up and then his</text>
  <text start="835.81" dur="4.5">research was classified top-secret of</text>
  <text start="838.33" dur="5.34">course Tesla Tesla&amp;#39;s papers were taken</text>
  <text start="840.31" dur="5.64">from his apartment when he died in 1943</text>
  <text start="843.67" dur="4.83">in New York and then a lot of that had</text>
  <text start="845.95" dur="3.96">to do with free energy and towards the</text>
  <text start="848.5" dur="4.38">end of his life Tesla was actually</text>
  <text start="849.91" dur="4.89">looking into anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="852.88" dur="4.56">electrogravitic research that he then</text>
  <text start="854.8" dur="5.46">passed along to a protege of his own his</text>
  <text start="857.44" dur="3.959">car and then also of course that all</text>
  <text start="860.26" dur="4.17">William Tompkins</text>
  <text start="861.399" dur="5.871">so William Tompkins has very good</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="4.68">credentials behind his name he was a</text>
  <text start="867.27" dur="4.42">insider he didn&amp;#39;t like the term</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="5.849">whistleblower but he was a will say</text>
  <text start="871.69" dur="4.83">disseminator of inside research he</text>
  <text start="874.959" dur="3.421">worked for naval intelligence work</text>
  <text start="876.52" dur="4.53">during World War two then after that he</text>
  <text start="878.38" dur="7.8">went to design space craft for the Navy</text>
  <text start="881.05" dur="10.08">in highly classified aerospace corporate</text>
  <text start="886.18" dur="10.11">think tanks so there&amp;#39;s a lot of well</text>
  <text start="891.13" dur="7.079">documented very prestigious credentials</text>
  <text start="896.29" dur="4.2">behind his name granted some of his</text>
  <text start="898.209" dur="4.651">testimony might delve into a bit too</text>
  <text start="900.49" dur="5.28">deep too quick for some people he gets</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="5.219">really into talking about the et races</text>
  <text start="905.77" dur="5.28">and the war going on between positive</text>
  <text start="908.079" dur="5.7">and negative factions and whatnot so it</text>
  <text start="911.05" dur="6.84">might be little too much but if people</text>
  <text start="913.779" dur="5.341">are open in the quick few minutes that</text>
  <text start="917.89" dur="2.61">you had to talk to them too a lot of</text>
  <text start="919.12" dur="3.69">this research to say look into William</text>
  <text start="920.5" dur="5.279">Thompkins he just came out a few years</text>
  <text start="922.81" dur="4.95">ago he&amp;#39;s got a book he&amp;#39;s got a lot of</text>
  <text start="925.779" dur="5.341">interviews I didn&amp;#39;t interview with him</text>
  <text start="927.76" dur="5.85">and boom right there they can go watch</text>
  <text start="931.12" dur="5.399">some good information that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="933.61" dur="5.58">their eyes of course - a lot of stuff so</text>
  <text start="936.519" dur="4.141">there you go guys that was a you know</text>
  <text start="939.19" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s a lot of research that you can</text>
  <text start="940.66" dur="5.91">go and understand really quick yourself</text>
  <text start="943.87" dur="6.24">keep up here so you can drop into</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="5.55">conversations really quick and gary</text>
  <text start="950.11" dur="3.9">mckinnon messy money missing money</text>
  <text start="952.12" dur="5.07">classified technology so nobody hope you</text>
  <text start="954.01" dur="5.55">guys enjoyed that video and then also</text>
  <text start="957.19" dur="4.709">want to drop right here go check out my</text>
  <text start="959.56" dur="4.32">secret space program webcasts I do them</text>
  <text start="961.899" dur="3.271">once a month there&amp;#39;s a few over I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="963.88" dur="3.78">already done that you can go back and</text>
  <text start="965.17" dur="5.22">watch and then there&amp;#39;s more coming up</text>
  <text start="967.66" dur="5.609">every month I&amp;#39;m doing one in a week here</text>
  <text start="970.39" dur="6.09">with Emory Smith and you can purchase it</text>
  <text start="973.269" dur="4.801">and watch live and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="976.48" dur="4.14">information painted in those that can</text>
  <text start="978.07" dur="4.8">really help you hone in your</text>

  <text start="982.87" dur="6.51">your skills in being the person to teach</text>
  <text start="986.05" dur="5.55">it to others I&amp;#39;d lay it out very simply</text>
  <text start="989.38" dur="5.16">as I try to do with all of my research</text>
  <text start="991.6" dur="5.52">so there you go quick plug for that get</text>
  <text start="994.54" dur="5.43">yourself educated get yourself</text>
