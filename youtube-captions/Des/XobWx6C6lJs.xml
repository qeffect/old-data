  <text start="0.41" dur="6.88">yo what up YouTube so this morning I did</text>
  <text start="5.22" dur="3.959">a live interview on Facebook with a good</text>
  <text start="7.29" dur="4.17">buddy of mine his name&amp;#39;s Justin booth</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="3.21">you can go check out my Facebook page if</text>
  <text start="11.46" dur="3.75">you want to watch it</text>
  <text start="12.389" dur="4.89">but during this interview we were</text>
  <text start="15.21" dur="4.229">discussing basically we were talking</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="3.931">about the most effective ways to wake</text>
  <text start="19.439" dur="3.811">our friends and family up most effective</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="4.38">ways to red pill how to go about doing</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="5.16">that and the conversation was so good</text>
  <text start="25.59" dur="4.83">that I wanted to reiterate many of those</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="4.649">points right here on YouTube for you</text>
  <text start="30.42" dur="5.49">guys so I&amp;#39;m gonna give you three tips</text>
  <text start="33.059" dur="5.07">for red pilling your friends your family</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="4.44">any random stranger on the street and</text>
  <text start="38.129" dur="4.471">then we&amp;#39;ll open it up for some</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="8.7">discussion some roundtable Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="42.6" dur="9.51">afterwards so number one come down to</text>
  <text start="49.05" dur="4.8">their level let&amp;#39;s be real when you want</text>
  <text start="52.11" dur="5.879">to wake somebody up when you want to red</text>
  <text start="53.85" dur="6.93">pill them normally your ideas your</text>
  <text start="57.989" dur="6.541">what&amp;#39;s going on in your head is gonna be</text>
  <text start="60.78" dur="6.6">at this level way up here and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="4.92">just gonna not have that perspective you</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="5.4">do in fact they&amp;#39;re probably gonna have</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="7.5">the opposite perspective many times so</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="6.21">you&amp;#39;ve got to simplify things greatly</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="3.39">not only that but sometimes you kind of</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="3.3">have an uphill battle because like I</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="5.099">said you have to help them unlearn and</text>
  <text start="82.29" dur="5.34">relearn these concepts at the very same</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="8.301">time especially if they&amp;#39;re concepts that</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="9.57">are so deep so out there cue UFOs</text>
  <text start="93.74" dur="4.96">various health topics etc etc I mean</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="3.779">anything regarding the deep state really</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="4.26">things that are so far out there that</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="3.841">you have to make them so simple and in</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="4.189">fact you might even want to practice</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="6.45">your talking points like if you&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="107.149" dur="5.891">excited if you&amp;#39;re so anxious to get into</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="4.709">a conversation with somebody and try to</text>
  <text start="113.04" dur="4.74">help them wake up see certain things you</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="4.261">know practice literally practice your</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="4.199">talking points talk to yourself I do it</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="3.3">all the time I&amp;#39;d be talking to myself in</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="4.951">the shower in the car wherever the heck</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="6.089">even practice on a video you know when I</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="5.1">started my youtube channel it would</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="3.601">say it still takes me like it might take</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="3.45">me five to ten try</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="4.56">is just to get something right or I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="4.589">just rant into a camera just to practice</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="4.32">literally hone your skills so you hone</text>
  <text start="140.069" dur="4.23">your talking points you just get a few</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="3.42">of them mind you if you&amp;#39;re trying to red</text>
  <text start="144.299" dur="3.091">pill somebody you&amp;#39;re not going to have</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="3.06">more than a minute or two to get your</text>
  <text start="147.39" dur="3.629">points out there so make them really</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="5.34">simple make them effective and come down</text>
  <text start="151.019" dur="7.291">to their level okay but here&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="5.97">is that if they don&amp;#39;t want to get it if</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="3.03">they get cognitive dissonance and want</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="6.479">to run away or something like that</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="7.5">don&amp;#39;t feel guilty don&amp;#39;t feel bad okay it</text>
  <text start="166.379" dur="5.58">is not your responsibility</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="5.64">to wake somebody else up they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="171.959" dur="4.441">be on their path wherever their path</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="4.95">might be at that point in time but</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="5.97">understand don&amp;#39;t be frustrated don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="5.85">feel bad don&amp;#39;t underestimate the power</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="4.35">of planting a seed mind you right maybe</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to get your</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="5.549">talking points your specific information</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="3.959">across to them because maybe their level</text>
  <text start="192.269" dur="3.901">is just so far down here that you</text>
  <text start="193.769" dur="6">literally can&amp;#39;t come down to them right</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="5.7">but never underestimate the power of</text>
  <text start="199.769" dur="5.641">planting that tiny little seed in their</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="6.17">subconscious and letting that grow and</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="5.759">also understand the power of repetition</text>
  <text start="208.04" dur="4.96">okay maybe there&amp;#39;s some huge concept you</text>
  <text start="211.169" dur="3">want them to get and maybe you see this</text>
  <text start="213" dur="3.81">person all the time or something like</text>
  <text start="214.169" dur="4.621">that but you can&amp;#39;t bring that massive</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="4.13">idea to them quite yet bring a little</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="5.279">bits and pieces and use repetition</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="5.229">understand the fake news media has used</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="4.681">repetition for so long to hammer home</text>
  <text start="226.169" dur="5.13">the false propaganda in our heads we</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="4.799">have to use those same tactics to try to</text>
  <text start="231.299" dur="4.111">help wake our friends and family up look</text>
  <text start="233.549" dur="5.701">at how they control our minds and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="5.43">use those tactics to uncontrol our</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="5.579">friends and family our communities</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="5.88">minds right so repetition get that right</text>
  <text start="244.829" dur="3.541">I just had somebody this morning comment</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="4.019">on my Twitter you say the same things</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="4.619">over and over again well a it&amp;#39;s Twitter</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="3.511">there&amp;#39;s only so much you can say and 280</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="3.24">characters and things I talk about her</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="4.139">so deep Malcolm you do that on Twitter</text>
  <text start="256.229" dur="4.38">and be Twitter is for that repetition</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="3.6">yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna say the same over</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="3.12">and over and over again on Twitter to</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="3.601">really hound it home into people&amp;#39;s heads</text>
  <text start="263.729" dur="6.061">okay</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="6.51">so point here being is that you can lead</text>
  <text start="269.79" dur="7.26">a horse to water but you can&amp;#39;t make them</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="6.66">drink it but I always like to add a</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="3.839">little extra piece on the end of that</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="4.11">and this leads me in to tip number two</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="3.78">you can&amp;#39;t lead up you can lead a horse</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="5.49">to water but you can&amp;#39;t make them drink</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="6.301">it although you can sell the water to</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="4.38">that horse now I don&amp;#39;t mind I don&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="3.54">that you&amp;#39;re selling your information to</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="4.05">who you&amp;#39;re trying to wake up what I mean</text>
  <text start="294.51" dur="5.129">is that you&amp;#39;re trying to market your</text>
  <text start="296.79" dur="4.68">ideas you&amp;#39;re trying to make them sexy</text>
  <text start="299.639" dur="3.931">you&amp;#39;re trying to make them you know</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="5.28">applicable for that individual</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="5.31">you have to use sales principles to get</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="6.78">your idea across and by that I mean</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="6.81">you&amp;#39;ve got to get to know the individual</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;ve got to ask them questions figure</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="4.32">them out you&amp;#39;ve got to understand where</text>
  <text start="317.76" dur="4.409">they come from who they are what their</text>
  <text start="320.01" dur="4.62">favorite topics might be you&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="322.169" dur="4.861">figure them out so you know maybe what</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="5.039">topic to approach best with them or to</text>
  <text start="327.03" dur="5.85">how approach the topic approach the</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="6.06">topic with them right so you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="4.83">selling you&amp;#39;re marketing these ideas to</text>
  <text start="335.729" dur="3.601">them you&amp;#39;re basically making the horse</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="3.18">realize that it&amp;#39;s really freaking</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="5.55">thirsty and then it wants to drink that</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="6.69">water okay half the people out there not</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="6.18">half 99.9% of the people out there don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="5.1">realize they&amp;#39;re thirsty right you have</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="3.24">to make them realize they&amp;#39;re thirsty you</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="4.29">have to say hey you&amp;#39;re not looking at</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.22">this but yeah it&amp;#39;s out there right so</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="4.53">get to know your customer see what they</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="4.89">might be respected receptive to and</text>
  <text start="361.5" dur="6.5">question question question question it</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="5.58">says always I mean this is the most</text>
  <text start="368" dur="4.69">fascinating thing about Q the most</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="5.19">impactful thing let&amp;#39;s say is because of</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="4.74">the questions it makes them think it</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="8.239">makes them connect the dots in their own</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="8.52">heads right so when you get into</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="3.941">especially when you get into the heated</text>
  <text start="385.95" dur="3.35">parts of the conversation because I</text>
  <text start="387.36" dur="3.99">understand that it can get heated and</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="4.48">especially if you&amp;#39;re trying to red pill</text>
  <text start="391.35" dur="5.34">somebody your friends and family it can</text>
  <text start="393.78" dur="5.83">be a very nerve-racking situation right</text>
  <text start="396.69" dur="4.659">so always</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="5.19">back and just answer it question it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="401.349" dur="5.1">very easy thing to do if maybe your mind</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="3.45">is boggled and you&amp;#39;re trying to deal</text>
  <text start="406.449" dur="4.171">with some cognitive dissonance or some</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="5.25">really shitty opinion that was thrown</text>
  <text start="410.62" dur="4.289">your way just question them right it</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="2.34">allows you to take a breath get your</text>
  <text start="414.909" dur="2.431">thoughts back in order</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="4.5">and offer something that&amp;#39;s gonna make</text>
  <text start="417.34" dur="6.44">them think and help you get your point</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="8.759">across so that&amp;#39;s the beauty of questions</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="8.02">number three number three is that what</text>
  <text start="429.099" dur="4.171">you have to do like I was just</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="4.709">mentioning you know these these</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="6.66">situations can get very heated very fast</text>
  <text start="436.509" dur="7.891">so what you need to do is not only keep</text>
  <text start="439.93" dur="8.4">yourself very grounded very centered you</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="6.41">know don&amp;#39;t let it delve into emotional</text>
  <text start="448.33" dur="5.339">responses because that often can just</text>
  <text start="450.81" dur="4.949">revel in to you know he said she said</text>
  <text start="453.669" dur="6.24"> and all kinds of ad hominem</text>
  <text start="455.759" dur="6.16">just petty attacks childish attacks but</text>
  <text start="459.909" dur="5.16">what you also need to do is create the</text>
  <text start="461.919" dur="4.65">space for them to open up and by doing</text>
  <text start="465.069" dur="4.41">that you have to be grounded a to do</text>
  <text start="466.569" dur="6.63">that and be your Hoss you have to</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="7.171">understand that these people that you</text>
  <text start="473.199" dur="5.161">know stuck in fantasy land that ridicule</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="4.35">conspiracy theorists et cetera it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="6.359">are people that just you know are not</text>
  <text start="481" dur="7.919">awake they&amp;#39;re not aware the majority of</text>
  <text start="484.719" dur="7.98">these people are very curious they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.919" dur="6.12">very curious they want to wake up I mean</text>
  <text start="492.699" dur="4.381">for example like these these maps behind</text>
  <text start="495.039" dur="5.31">me right I&amp;#39;m gonna do a video on these</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="5.429">maps ASAP eventually when I get to it</text>
  <text start="500.349" dur="6.54">but this particular cue map right here</text>
  <text start="502.509" dur="5.91">there&amp;#39;s a shirt that this map is on I</text>
  <text start="506.889" dur="3.2">have one of them you might have seen it</text>
  <text start="508.419" dur="4.17">if you follow me on Instagram or</text>
  <text start="510.089" dur="4.301">wherever I&amp;#39;ve posted it but basically</text>
  <text start="512.589" dur="3.541">it&amp;#39;s a shirt with this on it so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="4.35">shirt with all sorts of tiny little</text>
  <text start="516.13" dur="5.039">words written all over it it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="7.05">ballsy shirt to wear out in public let</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="6.78">me tell you but if you so for example I</text>
  <text start="525.79" dur="4.23">mean I went out in public with that</text>
  <text start="527.949" dur="4.111">shirt on the very first time that I went</text>
  <text start="530.02" dur="2.67">out in public with that shirt on I was</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="2.49">at</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="5">grocery store buying something I was in</text>
  <text start="534.55" dur="7.409">line checking out and this guy behind me</text>
  <text start="537.69" dur="6.61">said hey I like your shirt like oh</text>
  <text start="541.959" dur="4.74">thanks man like I was not expecting that</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="3.959">at all I don&amp;#39;t know what word he saw it</text>
  <text start="546.699" dur="3.541">might have been like New World Order</text>
  <text start="548.259" dur="4.861">Bohemian Grove herself on the arm right</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="5.639">here but I was so surprised he was like</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="3.899">I like that shirt man like thanks and</text>
  <text start="555.879" dur="2.52">then you started seeing how all the</text>
  <text start="557.019" dur="3.06">other things connecting you saw like</text>
  <text start="558.399" dur="3.451">Nazis and I might have been the one he</text>
  <text start="560.079" dur="3.63">saw and he saw some other things so</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="5.01">people want to wake up they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="563.709" dur="4.711">literally scared too they&amp;#39;re scared to</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="3.209">wake up cuz they&amp;#39;re scared about what</text>
  <text start="568.42" dur="4.5">they might find they&amp;#39;re scared about</text>
  <text start="570.069" dur="4.25">coming to the realization that</text>
  <text start="572.92" dur="5.37">everything they&amp;#39;ve been told is a lie</text>
  <text start="574.319" dur="5.71">right so they have all this fear all</text>
  <text start="578.29" dur="5.45">this scared wake up but they don&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="580.029" dur="6.48">that fear comes out in sadness</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="4.63">oftentimes an anger in ridicule and</text>
  <text start="586.509" dur="4.921">laughter so you have to stay grounded</text>
  <text start="588.37" dur="4.68">and create that space that comfortable</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="4.86">warm environment for them to want to</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="5.43">open up to you with okay the more</text>
  <text start="596.29" dur="5.029">violent we are the more aggressive</text>

  <text start="624.73" dur="3.479">aggressive you keep yourself grounded</text>
  <text start="626.23" dur="3.959">and calm and create that space that warm</text>
  <text start="628.209" dur="5.791">environment to say hey you can open up</text>
  <text start="630.189" dur="8.551">to me and also on that same point create</text>
  <text start="634" dur="6.93">a positive spin on whatever you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.74" dur="4.079">trying to convey whatever message you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="642.819" dur="5.25">time they go as hard as they can with</text>
  <text start="646.149" dur="4.68">trying to wake somebody up and they get</text>
  <text start="648.069" dur="4.651">into some deep dark but they revel</text>
  <text start="650.829" dur="3.48">in that they revel in how deep and dark</text>
  <text start="652.72" dur="3.299">it is and they don&amp;#39;t put any positive</text>
  <text start="654.309" dur="5.46">spin on it for instance human</text>
  <text start="656.019" dur="6.51">trafficking yeah deep dark stuff but get</text>
  <text start="659.769" dur="3.961">the point across that it&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="662.529" dur="2.49">great thing to talk about human</text>
  <text start="663.73" dur="1.65">trafficking because that&amp;#39;s what gets rid</text>
  <text start="665.019" dur="1.501">of it</text>
  <text start="665.38" dur="2.31">you&amp;#39;re not gonna scatter the</text>
  <text start="666.52" dur="3.33">cockroaches in the corner unless you</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="6.21">shine a light on those cockroaches right</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="4.74">so get them to understand that get them</text>
  <text start="673.9" dur="2.16">no scent Hey</text>
  <text start="674.59" dur="3.24">yeah like a lot of these holistic</text>
  <text start="676.06" dur="5.37">doctors are being mysteriously murdered</text>
  <text start="677.83" dur="5.4">etc etc Wow that&amp;#39;s scary but let&amp;#39;s look</text>
  <text start="681.43" dur="3.54">at what these holistic doctors were</text>
  <text start="683.23" dur="4.68">looking at they were looking at cancer</text>
  <text start="684.97" dur="5.24">cures many of them oh my gosh you can</text>
  <text start="687.91" dur="5.34">cure degenerative disease like that and</text>
  <text start="690.21" dur="5.04">then that&amp;#39;s the positive spin you see</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="6.27">this Awakening is not meant to be</text>
  <text start="695.25" dur="6.28">negative even the quote negative or bad</text>
  <text start="699.52" dur="4.98">subjects you got to understand good and</text>

  <text start="709.6" dur="7.08">how are you transmuting that issue right</text>
  <text start="714.15" dur="4.78">so put a positive spin on it and create</text>
  <text start="716.68" dur="3.9">a warm environment for them to open up</text>
  <text start="718.93" dur="3.39">with that&amp;#39;s you know that&amp;#39;s one thing I</text>

  <text start="845.32" dur="3.48">that fear-based programming around</text>
  <text start="847.03" dur="4.74">vaccines so you&amp;#39;re not gonna get them</text>
  <text start="848.8" dur="6.48">with that subject but maybe maybe they</text>
  <text start="851.77" dur="5.58">went to like business or economics class</text>
  <text start="855.28" dur="3.51">in college and there was some serious</text>
  <text start="857.35" dur="3.66">head scratch and they did in that class</text>
  <text start="858.79" dur="4.14">so you ask some questions about health</text>
  <text start="861.01" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t vibe with it but then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.93" dur="4.05">like huh yeah a financial system kind of</text>
  <text start="865.03" dur="4.53"> look at the debt where do these</text>
  <text start="866.98" dur="4.83">freaking Federal Reserve notes for like</text>
  <text start="869.56" dur="5.76">gold-backed currency etc etc and then</text>
  <text start="871.81" dur="6.57">they start huh questioning right there</text>
  <text start="875.32" dur="4.5">you go then you can start your cracking</text>
  <text start="878.38" dur="5.06">your cracking their ego there and you</text>
  <text start="879.82" dur="6.33">can start filling that crack right so</text>
  <text start="883.44" dur="6.61">you know I see I hear a lot of people</text>
  <text start="886.15" dur="5.31">out there they say you&amp;#39;re not gonna be</text>
  <text start="890.05" dur="2.85">able to wake up a hundred percent of the</text>
  <text start="891.46" dur="2.88">people there&amp;#39;s a small percentage out</text>
  <text start="892.9" dur="2.73">there maybe five to ten percent that</text>
  <text start="894.34" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re never gonna wake up</text>
  <text start="895.63" dur="5.25">you can&amp;#39;t get to them</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="8.64">they&amp;#39;re lost cases and I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="900.88" dur="8.04">that I do not believe that nobody can be</text>
  <text start="906.13" dur="5.82">saved for lack of a better term can be</text>
  <text start="908.92" dur="5.52">woken up right I personally believe that</text>
  <text start="911.95" dur="5.82">every single person out there has the</text>
  <text start="914.44" dur="5.94">potential to fully realize self</text>
  <text start="917.77" dur="5.94">actualize their potential fully wake up</text>
  <text start="920.38" dur="6.56">their consciousness and it all just</text>
  <text start="923.71" dur="6.09">depends on how we market this truth</text>
  <text start="926.94" dur="7">because let&amp;#39;s be real we&amp;#39;ve done a very</text>
  <text start="929.8" dur="9.12">shitty job for a long time</text>
  <text start="933.94" dur="6.93">in marketing these ideas and I mean yes</text>
  <text start="938.92" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s our fault but it&amp;#39;s kind of not our</text>
  <text start="940.87" dur="6.69">fault we&amp;#39;ve been so ridiculed and so</text>
  <text start="942.79" dur="8.22">traumatized and so degraded as free</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="6.93">thinkers as conspiracy theorists that I</text>
  <text start="951.01" dur="4.86">mean we&amp;#39;re pretty mad yeah that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="954.49" dur="2.61">it&amp;#39;s so easy to get heat in these</text>
  <text start="955.87" dur="3.3">conversations because we&amp;#39;re just so</text>
  <text start="957.1" dur="7.44">pissed off we just want people to get it</text>
  <text start="959.17" dur="5.82">right but again understand that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="964.54" dur="3.63">helpful</text>
  <text start="964.99" dur="5.76">and I think many of us need to actually</text>
  <text start="968.17" dur="4.83">work on healing ourselves before we ever</text>
  <text start="970.75" dur="4.47">go out in the public and try to wake</text>
  <text start="973" dur="5.76">others up try red peeling others we need</text>
  <text start="975.22" dur="5.73">to heal our own traumas first so when we</text>
  <text start="978.76" dur="5.94">get into those situations we can stay</text>
  <text start="980.95" dur="10.35">grounded we can stay relaxed and we can</text>
  <text start="984.7" dur="9.24">create that space for them to open up so</text>
  <text start="991.3" dur="6.38">that&amp;#39;s another thought I have on that</text>
  <text start="993.94" dur="3.74">next question</text>
  <text start="999.57" dur="6.13">attitude somebody just mentioned that</text>
  <text start="1001.44" dur="7.44">exactly attitude makes everything how</text>
  <text start="1005.7" dur="6.03">many coaches and teachers and you know</text>
  <text start="1008.88" dur="4.92">people mentors in your life have told</text>
  <text start="1011.73" dur="5.07">you that gotta have a good attitude</text>
  <text start="1013.8" dur="3.63">little Jimmy or else you ain&amp;#39;t gonna go</text>
  <text start="1016.8" dur="7.59">nowhere</text>
  <text start="1017.43" dur="11.91">exactly what about comprehensive places</text>
  <text start="1024.39" dur="6.24">for info to reference resources boom you</text>
  <text start="1029.34" dur="4.01">know I should have been number four</text>
  <text start="1030.63" dur="6.93">right there that is something very</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="6.97">effective to do to compile for yourself</text>
  <text start="1037.56" dur="5.34">when trying to red pill people you know</text>
  <text start="1040.32" dur="5.6">one one person I follow on Facebook his</text>
  <text start="1042.9" dur="8.25">name&amp;#39;s Jason Kristoff shout out to Jason</text>
  <text start="1045.92" dur="7.66">he rants on Facebook a lot about the</text>
  <text start="1051.15" dur="5.67">deep state and health topics I follow</text>
  <text start="1053.58" dur="5.7">him for that one thing that I saw him do</text>
  <text start="1056.82" dur="6.27">one time he talks about vaccines a lot</text>
  <text start="1059.28" dur="7.11">and vaccines is a very touchy topic one</text>
  <text start="1063.09" dur="4.73">thing he did was literally find every</text>
  <text start="1066.39" dur="4.88">single documentary</text>
  <text start="1067.82" dur="5.61">he could or good long video from a</text>
  <text start="1071.27" dur="3.9">doctor discussing the truth about</text>
  <text start="1073.43" dur="5.01">vaccines and he put that in a list</text>
  <text start="1075.17" dur="5.34">it was literally a list of like 40</text>
  <text start="1078.44" dur="3.87">different doctors and interviews with</text>
  <text start="1080.51" dur="4.08">them and then at the end there was like</text>
  <text start="1082.31" dur="4.7">20 documentaries and I would see him</text>
  <text start="1084.59" dur="5.97">copy and paste this list all the time</text>
  <text start="1087.01" dur="6.31">what that made me do is that made me</text>
  <text start="1090.56" dur="4.35">create a list like that for a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1093.32" dur="4.74">different topics I did one for free</text>
  <text start="1094.91" dur="4.77">energy I did one for a pizza gate for</text>
  <text start="1098.06" dur="3.69">instance once and it would be something</text>

  <text start="1110.77" dur="4.3">do is they just offer information out</text>
  <text start="1113.66" dur="3.18">there whether the information is true or</text>
  <text start="1115.07" dur="3.77">not you know it can be very legitimate</text>
  <text start="1116.84" dur="4.68">information but they don&amp;#39;t source it and</text>
  <text start="1118.84" dur="4.75">that doesn&amp;#39;t help the argument again</text>
  <text start="1121.52" dur="4.08">market your ideas if you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1123.59" dur="4.59">sell somebody to something and you make</text>
