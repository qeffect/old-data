  <text start="6.919" dur="4.18">yo what&amp;#39;s up guys happy Friday in this</text>
  <text start="9.96" dur="3.15">video here I want to talk about this</text>
  <text start="11.099" dur="3.87">situation that happened last night with</text>
  <text start="13.11" dur="6.089">what reports are saying was a small</text>
  <text start="14.969" dur="5.82">nuclear reactor in Ohio really weird</text>
  <text start="19.199" dur="3.66">that was the headline I saw last night</text>
  <text start="20.789" dur="5.16">emergency crews investigating reports of</text>
  <text start="22.859" dur="6.481">possible small nuclear reactor in an</text>
  <text start="25.949" dur="6.33">Ohio garage and when I first saw that</text>
  <text start="29.34" dur="4.95">headline I was like yo this is weird you</text>
  <text start="32.279" dur="3.571">know caught my eye I wanted to start</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="3.78">tracking it but I didn&amp;#39;t want to share</text>
  <text start="35.85" dur="3.99">it I didn&amp;#39;t want to share it because it</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="4.11">was still a developing story I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="4.17">have really any extra information on it</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="4.14">some people you know they like to jump</text>
  <text start="44.01" dur="4.83">the gun just hit retweet and share</text>
  <text start="46.32" dur="4.59">stories instantly but I like to take a</text>
  <text start="48.84" dur="4.199">few minutes and wait for that context to</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="3.78">roll in so that&amp;#39;s what I did a few</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="3.481">minutes later somebody sent me an update</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="4.56">on Twitter and this update was from</text>
  <text start="56.52" dur="5.789">local news reports in the area said this</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="5.04">man added to the story man reportedly</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="5.551">called officials saying that he</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="5.46">sustained radiofrequency burns while</text>
  <text start="67.86" dur="5.4">working on what he called a quantum</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="5.939">physics generator what quantum physics</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="5.57">generator that was actually coming from</text>
  <text start="75.689" dur="5.401">the local news station in the area there</text>
  <text start="78.83" dur="5.41">so this actually didn&amp;#39;t have anything to</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="6.15">do with a small nuclear reactor or I</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="4.379">don&amp;#39;t know what I saw some news reports</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="3.69">stating it but there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="4.5">confusion in the beginning because 40</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="4.29">homes were evacuated that hazmat bunch</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="3.511">of fire trucks were called in so some</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="3.6">news reports were saying it was a fire</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="4.71">in a house some say small nuclear eka</text>
  <text start="98.82" dur="6.089">all sorts of crazy things but according</text>
  <text start="101.34" dur="5.58">to a local reporter there whose Twitter</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="4.14">I found she was posting actual</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="4.68">photographs on the ground there of the</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="5.581">situation reporting what was said in the</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="6.059">calls to 9-1-1 and dispatch the guy</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="6.029">actually called 9-1-1 said that he got</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="6.21">hurt while working on a quantum physics</text>
  <text start="120.659" dur="5.1">generator wow so what I saw that you</text>
  <text start="123.869" dur="3.331">know the first headline said small</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="4.651">nuclear reactor I was like what the heck</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="5.31">now you know we&amp;#39;re getting a little more</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="2.97">clear picture quantum physics generator</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="2.52">when I saw that</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="4.08">things were getting real weird up in my</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="6.12">head and you know I was going into like</text>
  <text start="137.46" dur="4.89">the multi-dimensional chest mode how the</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="3.54">heck is this getting into the</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="4.98">maintenance of the media quantum physics</text>
  <text start="144.69" dur="6.54">generator with that in fact my initial</text>
  <text start="147.33" dur="6.24">reaction was I was thinking it was some</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="4.92">sort of like I don&amp;#39;t know white hat up</text>
  <text start="153.57" dur="4.89">to start initiating disclosure of free</text>
  <text start="156.15" dur="4.38">energy technologies in some way I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="158.46" dur="4.53">know man I mean with this timeline here</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re on in 2019 it&amp;#39;s get it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="162.99" dur="3.72">weird it&amp;#39;s been weird and it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="3.6">gonna get more weird so we have to</text>
  <text start="166.71" dur="3.42">really expect the unexpected and I</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="3.12">didn&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m like shoot it&amp;#39;s free</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="3.51">energy disclosure gonna come out of a</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="6.69">freaking garage is that what we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="6.39">for at the end of 2019 so that was my my</text>
  <text start="178.32" dur="3.57">reaction but I was still waiting for</text>
  <text start="180.03" dur="4.11">more information to come in you know I</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="3.69">was making this Twitter thread about it</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="6.57">just given my thoughts and information</text>
  <text start="185.58" dur="7.38">as I found it so as I found that local</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="4.11">news reporter Twitter thread and started</text>
  <text start="192.96" dur="3.66">scrolling through it and seeing some of</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="4.02">the quotes and some of the keywords that</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="4.89">were said apparently on that phone call</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="7.26">that the guy he was telling authorities</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="7.4">he was working on like quantum physics</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="4.59">of particle accelerator type stuff</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="3.46">capacitors things like that he was</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="3.93">saying this on the phone called the</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="6.95">9-1-1 and then saying he got hurt and</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="8.31">then I also found a video feed from the</text>
  <text start="219.32" dur="6.13">ground there with all the fire trucks in</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="4.68">the neighborhood and then in this video</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="3.96">feed they actually showed the dude they</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="4.17">showed the guy he was in his like late</text>
  <text start="229.41" dur="4.35">20s early 30s he was a pretty young guy</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="5.1">maybe my age or a little bit older than</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="4.65">me and there was a video of him being</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="5.25">loaded into the back of one of the</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="5.67">ambulances and he looked fine he looked</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="3.78">totally fine he was able to walk he was</text>
  <text start="244.08" dur="4.38">able to get himself into the ambulance</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="7.19">it started getting more weird for me</text>
  <text start="248.46" dur="7.8">right so my reaction then shifted from</text>
  <text start="253.1" dur="5.92">you know that multi dimensional chess</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="5.31">ideas theories in my head to like this</text>
  <text start="259.02" dur="5.58">is getting a little weird this might</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.92">even be I saw somebody with a great take</text>
  <text start="264.6" dur="2.46">on Twitter they said maybe the Deep</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="4.14">States</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="5.88">you know pull some malarkey pull some</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="5.75">skullduggery to try to get ahead of</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="6.72">disclosure maybe make some sort of SIOP</text>
  <text start="276.38" dur="5.71">have a guy hurt himself try to make</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="4.71">working on this type of technology you</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="4.829">know at home in your spare time make it</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.35">illegal or something like that and I cut</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="4.051">it I could have saw that happening that</text>
  <text start="288.72" dur="5.84">in my head was I was trying to you know</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="6.9">do the do the equated in my head do the</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="5.41">analyzing is that possible again I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="3.69">know you know and then the last</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="3.21">possibility in my head of course it</text>
  <text start="301.56" dur="3.75">could just be a nothing burger of course</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="4.83">it could just be a guy who was getting</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="5.82">way over his head with some experiments</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="7.08">into free energy you know zero point</text>
  <text start="311.13" dur="5.52">sort of technologies could have just bit</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="4.65">off way more that he could shoot with</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="5.19">that sustained some injuries and then</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="3.66">called the feds but even that</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="3.45">possibility which is probably the most</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="5.73">likely one honestly even that one&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="325.29" dur="7.11">little weird because quite honestly if I</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="6.48">was working on some sort of free energy</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="5.579">device in my garage and I suffered some</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="6.75">sort of injury from it I sure as hell</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="7.051">wouldn&amp;#39;t call authorities 911 I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="342.36" dur="4.29">call him and I most definitely wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="5.13">tell them over the phone that I was</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="5.73">working on some sort of device even if I</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="5.4">called it a quantum physics generator as</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="6.87">some sort of vague term whatever a</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="5.16">quantum physics generator even is so</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="3.09">that seemed weird to me and then of</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="4.08">course him being fine like why didn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="4.29">just go to the hospital why did he need</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="3.69">to call 9-1-1 and say those things over</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="3.87">the phone in the first place why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="6.03">he just go to the hospital and in fact</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="7.41">you know when looking at history the</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="5.67">history of free energy inventions and</text>
  <text start="377.91" dur="6.39">Sciences and especially the inventors</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="7.26">that made the devices usually this stuff</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="4.89">does not well number one the inventors</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="4.14">know that they&amp;#39;re not going to call the</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="3.66">feds or you know it&amp;#39;s not gonna say</text>
  <text start="391.59" dur="4.23">those sorts of things over the phone</text>
  <text start="392.85" dur="4.68">that could expose themselves because the</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="4.76">intelligence community they have a very</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="5.009">keen eye on</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="4.629">anybody working on that sort of</text>
  <text start="402.539" dur="5.46">technology or science or physics very</text>
  <text start="405.209" dur="3.93">keen eye on it and if in history you</text>
  <text start="407.999" dur="4.02">know throughout the decades even before</text>
  <text start="409.139" dur="7.73">the internet if any sort of whisper any</text>
  <text start="412.019" dur="6.98">sort of slight hint caught the ear of</text>
  <text start="416.869" dur="6.34">anybody in the intelligence apparatus</text>
  <text start="418.999" dur="7.09">boom lights out for them the black suits</text>
  <text start="423.209" dur="7.41">come in and the free energy inventor</text>
  <text start="426.089" dur="7.23">gets paid off gets blackmailed maybe get</text>
  <text start="430.619" dur="4.56">suicided maybe his warehouse</text>
  <text start="433.319" dur="6.12">mysteriously burns down something like</text>
  <text start="435.179" dur="6.66">that and then not a lick of it will get</text>
  <text start="439.439" dur="5.7">in the media at all it&amp;#39;ll all just go</text>
  <text start="441.839" dur="4.95">black get covered up so you know I still</text>
  <text start="445.139" dur="4.71">have a lot of unanswered questions in my</text>
  <text start="446.789" dur="4.321">head I&amp;#39;m sort of seeing now that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.849" dur="5.52">on to the next day this happened last</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="6.329">night almost 24 hours later now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="455.369" dur="3.45">looking at the media I&amp;#39;m trying to see</text>
  <text start="457.439" dur="2.73">if this will blow up into the mainstream</text>
  <text start="458.819" dur="4.5">media because that might give a little</text>
  <text start="460.169" dur="5.1">bit more clear picture as to the agenda</text>
  <text start="463.319" dur="4.47">the greater agenda or the motive behind</text>
  <text start="465.269" dur="4.23">this we&amp;#39;re not really seeing that quite</text>
  <text start="467.789" dur="4.41">honestly this really didn&amp;#39;t get farther</text>
  <text start="469.499" dur="4.19">than like local news and then a bunch of</text>
  <text start="472.199" dur="3.69">people on Twitter that got like</text>
  <text start="473.689" dur="3.79">triggered by it and saw the small</text>
  <text start="475.889" dur="3.9">nuclear reactor thing and then retweeted</text>
  <text start="477.479" dur="6.54">it without doing any due diligence into</text>
  <text start="479.789" dur="6.42">research what was really going on yeah I</text>
  <text start="484.019" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t know man I really don&amp;#39;t know some</text>
  <text start="486.209" dur="3.03">deets tapes I ought to get ahead of</text>
  <text start="487.649" dur="3.69">disclosure and then make this source of</text>
  <text start="489.239" dur="6.24">illegal I don&amp;#39;t know nothing Berger</text>
  <text start="491.339" dur="5.67">probably but still still weird and a guy</text>
  <text start="495.479" dur="5.16">working on this sort of stuff in his</text>
  <text start="497.009" dur="5.39">garage more unanswered questions at that</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="5.7">one like it&amp;#39;s gonna take some serious</text>
  <text start="502.399" dur="7.27">logistical support to do anything that</text>
  <text start="506.339" dur="5.07">this guy seems to be claiming or alleges</text>
  <text start="509.669" dur="6.211">that he was doing I mean it&amp;#39;s gonna take</text>
  <text start="511.409" dur="7.11">huh it&amp;#39;s gonna take some infrastructure</text>
  <text start="515.88" dur="4.11">set up in your home it&amp;#39;s gonna take some</text>
  <text start="518.519" dur="4.83">money to do you&amp;#39;re gonna need some</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="6.24">technical know-how seriously I mean free</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="4.261">energy sciences is completely different</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="3.39">than everything where you know the</text>
  <text start="527.61" dur="4.25">misinformation we&amp;#39;re typically taught in</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="2.24">universities</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s a very coltd it&amp;#39;s very hidden</text>
  <text start="534.83" dur="3.66">secret science it&amp;#39;s very confusing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="4.74">still trying to wrap my head around it</text>
  <text start="538.49" dur="5.94">you know so somebody that&amp;#39;s like my age</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="5.43">or like his early 30s he looked like he</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="3.42">was by himself doing this stuff yeah I</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t know man</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="3.72">still I don&amp;#39;t know so anyway those are</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="4.4">my thoughts on that those are the</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="4.98">possibilities just some situation a</text>
  <text start="554.62" dur="3.48">situational awareness some information</text>
  <text start="556.55" dur="4.44">about it I wanted to share with you guys</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="6.49">that&amp;#39;s all quantum physics generator</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="4.92">pretty crazy but uh anyway I want to</text>
  <text start="564.59" dur="4.76">take a minute here just to talk a little</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="7.31">bit about free energy technologies so</text>
  <text start="569.35" dur="6.22">being this story is what it is got</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="3.79">mentioning quantum physics generators</text>
  <text start="575.57" dur="3.06">and it is getting out into the media</text>
  <text start="577.01" dur="3.5">getting shared around just a great</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="4.59">opportunity to talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="4.93">what free energy technology is really</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="4.08">even are and the science is behind it</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="3.87">and how it exactly has been suppressed</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="6.69">for so long and you have to understand</text>
  <text start="589.31" dur="6.99">like I mentioned a minute ago what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.99" dur="5.31">taught in our educational systems about</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="4.68">history about physics itself just so</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="4.14">much of it is based on flawed</text>
  <text start="600.98" dur="4.17">foundations it&amp;#39;s misinformation you know</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s a lot of great individual bits</text>
  <text start="605.15" dur="4.38">of data that our universities and</text>
  <text start="607.4" dur="4.31">colleges and textbooks from them give us</text>
  <text start="609.53" dur="3.87">but a lot of the big picture</text>
  <text start="611.71" dur="4.09">understandings and foundational</text>
  <text start="613.4" dur="5.46">knowledge is false and it&amp;#39;s wrong and</text>
  <text start="615.8" dur="4.53">they think it&amp;#39;s true and that&amp;#39;s why so</text>
  <text start="618.86" dur="4.01">many so many things that mainstream</text>
  <text start="620.33" dur="5.73">science is doing these days is is</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="4.45">leading them down dead ends because they</text>
  <text start="626.06" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t understand that their foundations</text>
  <text start="627.32" dur="6.12">of physics are wrong and we can look</text>
  <text start="629.57" dur="5.79">back to a hundred years ago farther than</text>
  <text start="633.44" dur="4.8">a hundred years ago all the way back to</text>
  <text start="635.36" dur="5.43">Nikola Tesla even before him with John</text>
  <text start="638.24" dur="5.37">Keeley and others around then as well T</text>
  <text start="640.79" dur="6.57">Henry Moray they were all doing research</text>
  <text start="643.61" dur="8.46">into zero-point energy physics a type of</text>
  <text start="647.36" dur="6.3">science that really is true science so</text>
  <text start="652.07" dur="3.38">it&amp;#39;s actually going on but it&amp;#39;s far</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="3.81">different than what mainstream</text>
  <text start="655.45" dur="4.24">universities love teaches these days and</text>
  <text start="657.47" dur="4.95">they were finding that there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="659.69" dur="4.71">interrelationship between space and time</text>
  <text start="662.42" dur="3.06">time is not outside of space there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.4" dur="2.879">almost this</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="5.609">sip Racal nature to them and they were</text>
  <text start="667.279" dur="5.401">also finding a balanced reciprocal</text>
  <text start="671.089" dur="3.481">nature between electricity and gravity</text>
  <text start="672.68" dur="4.17">as well and the fact that we live in</text>
  <text start="674.57" dur="3.87">this electric universe it&amp;#39;s not gravity</text>
  <text start="676.85" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s running things it&amp;#39;s electricity</text>
  <text start="678.44" dur="4.5">and then everything&amp;#39;s in motion</text>
  <text start="680.66" dur="4.56">everything spinning has this angular</text>
  <text start="682.94" dur="5.16">momentum well how does that play into</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="5.34">electricity and gravity and also the</text>
  <text start="688.1" dur="3.96">influence of space and time and you know</text>
  <text start="690.56" dur="3.99">how can you influence matter with</text>
  <text start="692.06" dur="3.899">electromagnetism itself so all these</text>
  <text start="694.55" dur="3.659">sorts of things you know all these sorts</text>
  <text start="695.959" dur="4.38">of ideas shoot Tesla was working on that</text>
  <text start="698.209" dur="3.841">John Keeley all those guys back then and</text>
  <text start="700.339" dur="3.631">then throughout the year since then</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="4.67">there&amp;#39;s been others you have the Bedini</text>
  <text start="703.97" dur="6.299">brothers in Idaho who were working on</text>
  <text start="706.72" dur="5.71">magnetic resonators creating more</text>
  <text start="710.269" dur="3.81">electricity than it took to run them</text>
  <text start="712.43" dur="4.98">sometimes they call them overunity</text>
  <text start="714.079" dur="6.481">devices because they&amp;#39;re creating more</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="5.4">electricity than goes into the device to</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="4.86">run it so the Bedini brothers we have</text>
  <text start="722.81" dur="6.54">John Searle with his sural device that</text>
  <text start="725.42" dur="6.21">not only has electricity creation behind</text>
  <text start="729.35" dur="3.719">it contact of zero point to create more</text>
  <text start="731.63" dur="4.98">electricity than it takes to run it but</text>
  <text start="733.069" dur="6.75">it also had levitate of effects as well</text>
  <text start="736.61" dur="7.07">so energy creation and levitation you</text>
  <text start="739.819" dur="7.441">know to actually go hand in hand so</text>
  <text start="743.68" dur="6.79">credible stuff right Wow does that piss</text>
  <text start="747.26" dur="4.829">you off the fact that the deep state the</text>
  <text start="750.47" dur="4.349">powers that be they&amp;#39;ve literally</text>
  <text start="752.089" dur="5.151">suppressed not just the technologies but</text>
  <text start="754.819" dur="6.051">the science is behind them they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="757.24" dur="6.899">screwed with our heads for so long and</text>
  <text start="760.87" dur="9.219">we could have had a completely different</text>
  <text start="764.139" dur="7.421">society completely new paradigm if we</text>
  <text start="770.089" dur="5.19">could have actually reached the</text>
  <text start="771.56" dur="5.16">potential that unhindered we should be</text>
  <text start="775.279" dur="3.331">able to reach we would have reached but</text>
  <text start="776.72" dur="3.78">we haven&amp;#39;t because we have these you</text>
  <text start="778.61" dur="6.27">know social engineer has been tinkering</text>
  <text start="780.5" dur="5.699">with our society for so long and also in</text>
  <text start="784.88" dur="3.03">that same timeframe that all these</text>
  <text start="786.199" dur="5.25">inventors were building out these</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="6.779">devices that the intelligence apparatus</text>
  <text start="791.449" dur="6.26">you know the deep state rogue Intel</text>
  <text start="794.689" dur="4.101">communities they&amp;#39;ve been vehemently</text>
  <text start="797.709" dur="2.371">suppressing</text>
  <text start="798.79" dur="2.73">this stuff from getting out into the</text>
  <text start="800.08" dur="3.77">domain so that&amp;#39;s why I said you know any</text>
  <text start="801.52" dur="4.53">whisper of a device being built</text>
  <text start="803.85" dur="5.32">sometimes when these devices are being</text>
  <text start="806.05" dur="5.37">made simply turning them on will pump</text>
  <text start="809.17" dur="7.14">out a resonance and then that resonance</text>
  <text start="811.42" dur="8.49">can be tapped and located and then</text>
  <text start="816.31" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s how the CIA or deep state will</text>
  <text start="819.91" dur="3.24">know what one of these devices is being</text>
  <text start="821.41" dur="5.19">built it&amp;#39;s not with every device but</text>
  <text start="823.15" dur="6.24">some are like that and nevertheless you</text>
  <text start="826.6" dur="6.21">know if they find out they will come</text>
  <text start="829.39" dur="5.61">down on anybody building such a thing</text>
  <text start="832.81" dur="4.2">and that&amp;#39;s because you might wonder why</text>
  <text start="835" dur="3.39">would the you know why haven&amp;#39;t these</text>
  <text start="837.01" dur="4.38">technologies gotten out and helped us</text>
  <text start="838.39" dur="6.17">all well these technologies would lose</text>
  <text start="841.39" dur="5.87">the deep state all of their power</text>
  <text start="844.56" dur="4.99">through and through right there 100%</text>
  <text start="847.26" dur="4.12">they would lose it all because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="849.55" dur="4.08">talking a multitrillion-dollar year</text>
  <text start="851.38" dur="5.48">business in fossil fuels and oil and gas</text>
  <text start="853.63" dur="7.32">and coal and electrical wires and</text>
  <text start="856.86" dur="5.26">centralized power grids trillions of</text>
  <text start="860.95" dur="3.54">dollars a year and not just that but</text>
  <text start="862.12" dur="4.34">like I said energy creation from the</text>
  <text start="864.49" dur="4.17">zero point goes hand in hand with</text>
  <text start="866.46" dur="3.58">electrogravitics antigravity for lack of</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="3.32">a better term so we&amp;#39;re also talking</text>
  <text start="870.04" dur="3.99">about a completely redesigned</text>
  <text start="871.98" dur="3.64">infrastructure we wouldn&amp;#39;t need cars</text>
  <text start="874.03" dur="4.98">anymore we wouldn&amp;#39;t need planes we could</text>
  <text start="875.62" dur="5.91">travel literally like that almost free</text>
  <text start="879.01" dur="4.92">almost for free the only money it really</text>
  <text start="881.53" dur="3.87">takes to create these free energy</text>
  <text start="883.93" dur="3.72">devices is just what it would take for</text>
  <text start="885.4" dur="3.48">the research and development of it you</text>
  <text start="887.65" dur="2.61">know once you got it powered up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="888.88" dur="2.82">creating more electricity than it takes</text>
  <text start="890.26" dur="4.38">to run it and then you can just start</text>
  <text start="891.7" dur="5.13">powering up more stuff you know this is</text>
  <text start="894.64" dur="4.38">why free energy tack and the science is</text>
  <text start="896.83" dur="3.75">behind it relearning what the hell is</text>
  <text start="899.02" dur="3.69">really going on with our reality and the</text>
  <text start="900.58" dur="3.81">potentials that we have here one of the</text>
  <text start="902.71" dur="4.29">biggest passions that I have because</text>
  <text start="904.39" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s going to redesign everything and</text>
  <text start="907" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s where we should already be as a</text>
  <text start="908.74" dur="4.23">society but we&amp;#39;re not so we got to get</text>
  <text start="910.99" dur="3.36">there quick huh we got to get there</text>
  <text start="912.97" dur="4.11">quick and we can get there quick</text>
  <text start="914.35" dur="5.61">all right so there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
  <text start="917.08" dur="4.8">ranting a little bit of monologue for</text>
  <text start="919.96" dur="4.62">you guys hope you enjoyed it talking</text>
  <text start="921.88" dur="4.77">free energy devices I think what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="924.58" dur="3.84">on in Columbus Ohio I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.65" dur="3.42">much I just think this guy I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="928.42" dur="3.03">me you might have been confused</text>
  <text start="930.07" dur="2.15">we&amp;#39;ll see we&amp;#39;ll see if there&amp;#39;s anything</text>
  <text start="931.45" dur="3.87">more to it</text>
  <text start="932.22" dur="5.609">that I that topic of free energy please</text>
  <text start="935.32" dur="5.009">research that because it&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="937.829" dur="5.231">enlightening it&amp;#39;s incredibly liberating</text>
  <text start="940.329" dur="8.19">research the ideas of say Nikola Tesla</text>
  <text start="943.06" dur="6.959">Walter Russell viktor schauberger you</text>
  <text start="948.519" dur="3.781">know and even the names of like John</text>
  <text start="950.019" dur="5.611">Hutchinson and others like that these</text>
  <text start="952.3" dur="5.52">individuals Ed Leedskalnin you know</text>
  <text start="955.63" dur="5.84">Coral Castle they&amp;#39;re in Florida these</text>
  <text start="957.82" dur="8.009">sorts of ideas of vibrational physics</text>
  <text start="961.47" dur="8.29">magnetic resonance based electric based</text>
  <text start="965.829" dur="5.671">physics right a lot more we have to</text>
  <text start="969.76" dur="3.449">learn everybody and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="971.5" dur="3.66">excited for this awakening because there</text>
  <text start="973.209" dur="4.32">is so much to learn out there really</text>
  <text start="975.16" dur="3.6">science these days things that knows</text>
  <text start="977.529" dur="4.17">everything but it doesn&amp;#39;t know jack-shit</text>
  <text start="978.76" dur="4.46">and that might seem scary but on the</text>
  <text start="981.699" dur="4.111">other hand I look at it as like</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="4.979">incredibly exciting because that means</text>
  <text start="985.81" dur="6.899">there&amp;#39;s so much out there for us to</text>
  <text start="988.199" dur="6.221">learn and so much more discovery that we</text>
  <text start="992.709" dur="4.681">have yet to do in so much more</text>
  <text start="994.42" dur="5.49">technological possibility that&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="997.39" dur="4.83">know it sucks it&amp;#39;s been hidden but on</text>
  <text start="999.91" dur="3.78">the other hand it&amp;#39;s a beautiful thing</text>
  <text start="1002.22" dur="6.9">that you and I&amp;#39;ve been born right here</text>
  <text start="1003.69" dur="7.95">to be able to learn about it get it out</text>
  <text start="1009.12" dur="4.11">into the public and start getting our</text>
  <text start="1011.64" dur="3.9">hands dirty and actually changing</text>
  <text start="1013.23" dur="4.2">society literally there you go guys free</text>
  <text start="1015.54" dur="3.56">energy it&amp;#39;s coming and that&amp;#39;s all for</text>
