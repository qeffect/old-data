  <text start="2.7" dur="4.38">projected to have a big upswing this</text>
  <text start="5.46" dur="3.24">interview here is gonna be about how you</text>
  <text start="7.08" dur="3.78">can make money in the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="8.7" dur="4.08">market no matter how it&amp;#39;s doing and get</text>
  <text start="10.86" dur="5.149">yourself off of the globalist</text>
  <text start="12.78" dur="3.229">centralized currency systems</text>
  <text start="20.519" dur="4.361">Bob thank you so much for coming back on</text>
  <text start="22.9" dur="4.139">with me here yeah hey thanks Jared</text>
  <text start="24.88" dur="4.05">thanks for having me buddy absolutely so</text>
  <text start="27.039" dur="3.72">since you&amp;#39;re the resident cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="28.93" dur="4.559">expert here I want to ask your opinion</text>
  <text start="30.759" dur="4.291">on a few things I was checking the news</text>
  <text start="33.489" dur="3.451">of the cryptocurrency markets this</text>
  <text start="35.05" dur="3.93">morning and I found a few things that</text>
  <text start="36.94" dur="4.5">really gave me some hope one of those</text>
  <text start="38.98" dur="4.56">was that Bitcoin seems to be taking a</text>
  <text start="41.44" dur="4.85">step towards becoming what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="43.54" dur="5.25">multi networked cryptocurrency basically</text>
  <text start="46.29" dur="4.479">expanding the capabilities of Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="48.79" dur="4.14">such that it&amp;#39;ll be able to add a bunch</text>
  <text start="50.769" dur="4.551">of new features and not only that but</text>
  <text start="52.93" dur="5.219">Google seems to be reversing a ban on</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="5.44">cryptocurrency ads and I saw an article</text>
  <text start="58.149" dur="6.511">stating that the trading volume is</text>
  <text start="60.76" dur="5.669">expected to see a 50% growth in 2019 so</text>
  <text start="64.66" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s just a lot of things that seem</text>
  <text start="66.429" dur="4.981">to be telling us that cryptocurrency is</text>
  <text start="68.86" dur="4.319">going to bounce back from the previous</text>
  <text start="71.41" dur="3.66">lows that it&amp;#39;s kind of been at what do</text>
  <text start="73.179" dur="4.591">you think of all this yeah you know</text>
  <text start="75.07" dur="5.219">we&amp;#39;ve expected Bitcoin to add just this</text>
  <text start="77.77" dur="4.47">functionality and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="80.289" dur="3.561">always a little reluctant to talk about</text>
  <text start="82.24" dur="3.93">too many of the alt coins because</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="3.97">bitcoins gonna get a lot of the features</text>
  <text start="86.17" dur="3.809">that some of these other all coins have</text>
  <text start="87.82" dur="4.47">been out and that&amp;#39;s all they offer and</text>
  <text start="89.979" dur="4.201">so there&amp;#39;s no need to bolt on an altcoin</text>
  <text start="92.29" dur="4.469">that does a certain thing if Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="94.18" dur="5.64">will already do it so this is great news</text>
  <text start="96.759" dur="5.461">for Bitcoin and and I agree with you on</text>
  <text start="99.82" dur="5.28">the trading volume and as I post it to</text>
  <text start="102.22" dur="5.399">you before where we got on you know at</text>
  <text start="105.1" dur="5.22">the end of August something&amp;#39;s changed in</text>
  <text start="107.619" dur="5.311">the market really around everything what</text>
  <text start="110.32" dur="6.689">I would call non liability assets that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.93" dur="8.039">you know gold and silver and the crypto</text>
  <text start="117.009" dur="6.241">currencies so I think Bitcoin put in the</text>
  <text start="120.969" dur="3.871">bottom I think some of the other alts</text>
  <text start="123.25" dur="3.509">are gonna start following along with it</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="4.369">and we&amp;#39;re waiting all we&amp;#39;re waiting for</text>
  <text start="126.759" dur="6.031">now is that big massive downtrend line</text>
  <text start="129.209" dur="6.731">that&amp;#39;s coming down from 20k you know</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="5.96">across the the top you know left down</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="5.04">right of the the chart once that breaks</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="5.23">then I think we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="5.789">start our next move higher and will at</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="5.28">least attack 11,000 then we&amp;#39;ll attack</text>
  <text start="146.769" dur="4.261">the next tie and then we&amp;#39;ll double top</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="4.73">at 20,000 then we&amp;#39;ll just take it from</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="5.21">there but hey I&amp;#39;d be happy to</text>
  <text start="153.99" dur="3.69">pull it a double here in the next six to</text>
  <text start="156.24" dur="3.36">nine months I think it&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="4.71">possible gotcha</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="4.5">so basically regardless of how many</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="4.26">alternative coins are coming out you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="4.5">still putting your money and your value</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="4.74">behind Bitcoin it sounds like and you</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="5.4">definitely see the trends especially in</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="4.74">2019 being able to hit that upswing</text>
  <text start="174" dur="4.95">again yeah I think it&amp;#39;s gonna start once</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="4.41">already started in my view so we think</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="4.44">the end of August has started the next</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="5.97">move higher how far how fast we really</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t care Jordan because what we do is</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="4.44">we we&amp;#39;re not myopic about this we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="189.21" dur="3.9">gonna sit there in a cave and say you</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="4.2">know I&amp;#39;ll come out when it&amp;#39;s at 50,000</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s incredible amount of training</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="4.5">opportunities in between that and while</text>
  <text start="197.88" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re still in this downtrend we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="5.46">six or seven Bitcoin trades and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="3.84">making money on Bitcoin every month even</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="4.59">though it&amp;#39;s still doing it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="4.65">up-and-down action so once it breaks</text>
  <text start="209.7" dur="4.26">that down trendline then we could be a</text>
  <text start="211.32" dur="4.71">little bit more patient with the trade</text>
  <text start="213.96" dur="4.17">but in the meantime you know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="4.83">care and then we&amp;#39;re like in finance coin</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="5.13">- that&amp;#39;s a great coin to do some really</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="4.34">neat things from a brokerage standpoint</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="4.86">so there are a couple office that will</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="4.69">will trade on the plus side the other</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="3.63">thing that we do as well is that if we</text>
  <text start="229.89" dur="4.62">think we see a downdraft coming in any</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="4.47">of these coins you know we know and we</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="4.53">teach people how to take a short the</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.61">coin protect their Bitcoin investment by</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="5.52">shorting a weaker coin against Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="5.25">and then that way you can hedge without</text>
  <text start="244.56" dur="5.13">jumping out of your Bitcoin and creating</text>
  <text start="247.08" dur="4.47">a tax you know issue for yourself so</text>
  <text start="249.69" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s a lot of strategies that we give</text>
  <text start="251.55" dur="4.8">people to help people make money stay in</text>
  <text start="253.86" dur="4.41">the game not panic not worry and then</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="5.34">once we go back into an uptrend which we</text>
  <text start="258.27" dur="4.92">actually will worldwide that the</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="4.71">currency markets are starting to get</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="5.94">really crazy and you can see money up</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="6.24">you see the network&amp;#39;s you know in Iran</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="5.67">Venezuela Turkey Argentina these</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="3.9">countries are destabilizing and people</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="4.2">are looking to get their wealth and</text>
  <text start="276.54" dur="4.05">assets out of the country and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279" dur="4.65">only two ways you really could do it</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="4.56">quickly is that you can either buy gold</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="3.05">and hop on a plane and get out of there</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="4.37">without getting it confiscated</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="6.06">or you can go ahead and buy Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="289.52" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s already out of the country so we</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="4.83">think kryptos has absolutely a place</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="4.92">especially when we start going into you</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="4.46">know some economic turbulence that we</text>
  <text start="299.63" dur="6.12">expect in 2019 and 2020</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="6.49">what sort of economic turbulence are you</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="5.1">foreseeing you know just two things one</text>
  <text start="308.54" dur="6.15">is this dis expansion has gone on for</text>
  <text start="310.85" dur="6.51">nearly 10 years it&amp;#39;s artificial Jordan</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s only been funded through debt and</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re at a point now where you see</text>
  <text start="319.07" dur="2.82">interest rates are going up tomorrow the</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="4.86">Federal Reserve will raise interest</text>
  <text start="321.89" dur="5.64">rates again at the end of the year the</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="5.07">ECB will have no choice but to start</text>
  <text start="327.53" dur="6.54">raising interest rates as well and once</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="5.46">that happens then we&amp;#39;re debt based</text>
  <text start="334.07" dur="4.08">economies that people just can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="4.59">what they call the cost of the carry of</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="4.59">the interest rate and they&amp;#39;ll just start</text>
  <text start="340.79" dur="5.31">defaulting on their loans which puts it</text>
  <text start="342.74" dur="6.06">into an economic recession and so then</text>
  <text start="346.1" dur="4.47">you get turbulence and then people will</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="3.15">quickly try to put their money in places</text>
  <text start="350.57" dur="3.63">where they don&amp;#39;t have to worry about</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="4.56">whether their counterparty is gonna be</text>
  <text start="354.2" dur="5.16">able to pay them back bitcoins one of</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="4.77">those you know Gold&amp;#39;s another one so you</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="3.9">look for places of safety and and</text>
  <text start="361.28" dur="3.99">cryptocurrencies will be that place if</text>
  <text start="363.26" dur="3.86">that doesn&amp;#39;t happen we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s called an inflationary blow-off</text>
  <text start="367.12" dur="6.25">where the prices of everything will just</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="4.98">go insane in that case currencies are</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="3.87">gonna be a place in which you could</text>
  <text start="374.66" dur="5.52">store your value of your your assets</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="5.25">because it&amp;#39;s gonna be its again it</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t have a liability to it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="5.31">just gonna be a place of gold silver to</text>
  <text start="384.2" dur="4.86">miners and crypto will definitely be an</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="3.63">asset that people will buy an</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="5.19">inflationary environment so you know</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="4.47">either way crypto wins so in the years</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="3.96">to come it sounds like cryptocurrency is</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="4.23">gonna be a really safe option and then</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="4.77">right now no matter where the markets at</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="5.28">whether it&amp;#39;s slowly going down stagnant</text>
  <text start="402.98" dur="5.61">or even growing you guys and your</text>
  <text start="405.41" dur="5.01">software programs can help yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="4.98">look we have buying sell signals right</text>
  <text start="410.42" dur="6.06">on the charts and so you know people can</text>
  <text start="413.57" dur="5.46">follow coins we don&amp;#39;t follow and and we</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="4.17">call out all the Bitcoin trades and and</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="3.9">you know we see the bar</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="4.47">pressure and we see the selling pressure</text>
  <text start="422.93" dur="4.47">and then we help people manage through</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="5.16">how to set what they call stops move</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="5.46">their stops up basically protecting your</text>
  <text start="430.28" dur="4.62">profit and the nice thing about Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="432.86" dur="4.32">it trades 24 hours a day seven days a</text>
  <text start="434.9" dur="4.53">week so that you don&amp;#39;t get hit with some</text>
  <text start="437.18" dur="4.26">like out of the blue something that you</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="3.12">can&amp;#39;t react together for 9 a.m. in the</text>
  <text start="441.44" dur="4.56">morning when you&amp;#39;re sleeping or</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="4.95">something like that yeah and the markets</text>
  <text start="446" dur="3.96">not open and you wake up and you&amp;#39;re down</text>
