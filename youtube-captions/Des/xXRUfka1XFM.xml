  <text start="5.64" dur="4.74">you my experience at the contact in the</text>
  <text start="7.44" dur="5.85">desert conference last weekend in Indian</text>
  <text start="10.38" dur="5.819">Wells California my experience with what</text>
  <text start="13.29" dur="5.1">I believe is blatant censorship blatant</text>
  <text start="16.199" dur="4.111">lying from somebody or some group</text>
  <text start="18.39" dur="4.649">associated with that organization and</text>
  <text start="20.31" dur="4.77">just some really shady stuff that went</text>
  <text start="23.039" dur="4.711">on last weekend so first I want to</text>
  <text start="25.08" dur="4.38">describe what contact in the desert is I</text>
  <text start="27.75" dur="3.599">know many of my audience might have</text>
  <text start="29.46" dur="3.599">never heard of it before or are</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="4.14">unfamiliar with the inner workings in</text>
  <text start="33.059" dur="4.41">the UFO AG community and contact in the</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="4.351">desert is basically one of the largest</text>
  <text start="37.469" dur="4.531">UFO conferences in the world if not the</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="4.02">largest and it&amp;#39;s been held for quite a</text>
  <text start="42" dur="3.559">few years they used to be held at an</text>
  <text start="43.86" dur="4.109">event center in Joshua Tree California</text>
  <text start="45.559" dur="5.471">but over the last two years it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="6.18">held at the Renaissance Hotel and Spa in</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="4.77">Indian Wells and the first time I had</text>
  <text start="54.149" dur="4.521">attended contact in the desert was back</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="5.91">in 2017 it was actually the very first</text>
  <text start="58.67" dur="6.94">conference of any topic that I had</text>
  <text start="61.71" dur="5.67">attended and 2017 was the last time that</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="4.47">they held contact in the desert at</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="4.5">Joshua Tree so I was able to attend and</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="4.5">it was a great time hung out with some</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="4.8">individuals I didn&amp;#39;t speak there in 2017</text>
  <text start="74.58" dur="4.679">but it was a good experience all around</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="5.549">I was happy with it I attended again</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="4.711">last year in 2018 this was the first</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="5.341">time like I said they held it at the</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="6.48">Renaissance Resort &amp;amp; Spa and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="5.61">speak last year either but last year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="5.01">conference most of what I did was a lot</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="3.84">of work for above majestic the</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="4.199">documentary we were doing a lot of</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.489">filming there and we had a pre-screening</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="5.431">of above majestic at last year&amp;#39;s contact</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="4.381">in the desert in 2018 as well so for the</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="4.11">last couple years I attended contact in</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="4.439">the desert I didn&amp;#39;t speak I was either</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="5.07">hanging out or doing some other work and</text>
  <text start="111.329" dur="5.61">there was no drama nothing weird okay</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="4.26">not saying I&amp;#39;ve always agreed with every</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="3.811">single speaker or everything that goes</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="5.729">on at contact in the desert but there</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="5.909">was no weirdness that I experienced and</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="6.75">it was an overall good time the past</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="6.341">couple of years now this year 2019 okay</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="5.291">let&amp;#39;s get to what happened</text>
  <text start="133" dur="6.24">and I&amp;#39;m gonna begin by going through</text>
  <text start="136.3" dur="4.8">this chronologically okay so about six</text>
  <text start="139.24" dur="5.63">or seven months ago this was about</text>
  <text start="141.1" dur="7.35">November December 2018 was when I</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="5.89">received some correspondence from either</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="4.92">a producer or a director associated with</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="4.199">contact in the desert and I was invited</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="3.5">to speak there got an email from</text>
  <text start="154.959" dur="4.921">somebody they invited me to speak and</text>
  <text start="156.87" dur="5.14">after a little bit of deliberation in my</text>
  <text start="159.88" dur="6.15">own head maybe a few weeks or a month or</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="5.729">two I decided to do it so I signed the</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="4.77">speaker&amp;#39;s agreement and I assign I</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="6.781">agreed to do one lecture one workshop</text>
  <text start="170.8" dur="8.52">and one panel for contact in the desert</text>
  <text start="174.52" dur="6.51">this year now from me agreeing to go to</text>
  <text start="179.32" dur="3.93">contact in the desert and signing that</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="5.01">speaker&amp;#39;s agreement late last year up</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="6.959">until the conference just last weekend I</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="8.21">had only ever got on one or two calls</text>
  <text start="190.209" dur="7.111">with directors or producers people</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="5.65">associated with contact in the desert to</text>
  <text start="197.32" dur="5.22">discuss my appearance there and these</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="4.8">phone calls were a long long time ago I</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="5.25">barely even remember who I was talking</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="6.78">to or what was spoken but I do remember</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="6.509">that there wasn&amp;#39;t anything that they</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="5.22">were really trying to influence me to do</text>
  <text start="214.299" dur="5.791">and by that I mean they weren&amp;#39;t telling</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="7.86">me what to say or what not to say they</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="5.67">were very introductory phone calls just</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="3.929">getting to know these people they were</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="5.16">getting to know me etc so nothing really</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="4.47">more than that all right an important</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="4.56">point that we&amp;#39;ll discuss a little bit</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="3.991">later and like I said for months and</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="4.59">months I didn&amp;#39;t hear from him</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="4.41">I thought all was well and contact in</text>
  <text start="240.07" dur="3.21">the desert was coming up there was</text>
  <text start="241.36" dur="5.49">nothing I really had to worry about and</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="5.82">that was that so fast forward to the</text>
  <text start="246.85" dur="5.28">conference just last weekend now I</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="7.62">arrived in Indian Wells California on</text>
  <text start="252.13" dur="7.079">Thursday checked into my Airbnb and then</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="6">Friday is when I decided to head over to</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="5.551">the venue and check in myself so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="4.14">what I did I went to the venue checked</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="5.249">in got my badge</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="5.85">got the Welcome Packet basically in the</text>
  <text start="270.009" dur="4.62">itinerary for the weekend and then I</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="3.87">took a few moments to walk around the</text>
  <text start="274.629" dur="6.241">venue meet with some people I wanted to</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="6.6">see and then I left that was Friday now</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="5.13">when I arrived there and got my Welcome</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="4.65">Packet and checked out the schedule for</text>
  <text start="286" dur="5.669">the weekend and whatnot I found a couple</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="6.329">weird things number one I was not slated</text>
  <text start="291.669" dur="4.74">to be on a panel so this is weird to me</text>
  <text start="294.159" dur="4.141">it was actually written into the</text>
  <text start="296.409" dur="3.48">contract the speaker&amp;#39;s agreement that I</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="5.16">signed that I was supposed to be on a</text>
  <text start="299.889" dur="6.06">panel wasn&amp;#39;t on one not just that but I</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="5.669">found out just some really weird things</text>
  <text start="305.949" dur="4.741">things that I hadn&amp;#39;t experienced really</text>
  <text start="309.129" dur="4.26">with any other conference and with the</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="5.029">size and stature of contact in the</text>
  <text start="313.389" dur="4.381">desert it was very weird to me that</text>
  <text start="315.719" dur="5.771">these certain things were taken care of</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="5.31">and by that I mean parking wasn&amp;#39;t taken</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="3.51">care of at least for me I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="4.47">about other speakers if they had their</text>
  <text start="325" dur="4.439">parking comped or got parking passes</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="3.899">from contact in the desert but as a</text>
  <text start="329.439" dur="4.95">speaker I had to pay to park as a</text>
  <text start="331.449" dur="5.31">speaker I also had to pay for all my own</text>
  <text start="334.389" dur="4.381">food I didn&amp;#39;t get any food tickets there</text>
  <text start="336.759" dur="3.421">which is also weird you know every</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="4.199">single other conference I&amp;#39;d ever been to</text>
  <text start="340.18" dur="4.829">those things were comped or at least</text>
  <text start="342.969" dur="5.341">supported for the speaker wasn&amp;#39;t here</text>
  <text start="345.009" dur="5.791">and I also found out that my talk in my</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="5.579">workshop remember no panel but my talk</text>
  <text start="350.8" dur="4.919">of my workshop my talk was at 7:30 in</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="4.131">the morning on Sunday and then my</text>
  <text start="355.719" dur="6.931">workshop was at 7:00 p.m. Sunday night</text>
  <text start="358.02" dur="5.949">so you know fine I wasn&amp;#39;t really rubbed</text>
  <text start="362.65" dur="3.569">the wrong way actually quite frankly I</text>
  <text start="363.969" dur="3.781">was like okay let&amp;#39;s work for me no panel</text>
  <text start="366.219" dur="4.471">I&amp;#39;m just here to do my talk and my</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="6.18">workshop and good to go so that was that</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="4.979">on Friday and then Saturday came I</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="5.31">didn&amp;#39;t end up going to the venue on</text>
  <text start="375.669" dur="6.09">Saturday quite frankly I had some work I</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="4.979">needed to do for some other things work</text>
  <text start="381.759" dur="5.31">to do for my presentation and I was just</text>
  <text start="384.219" dur="5.491">hanging out at the air B&amp;amp;B didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="387.069" dur="5.761">feel like the desire to go on Saturday</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="4.53">and then Sunday came around and this is</text>
  <text start="392.83" dur="6.66">where it starts getting a little weird</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="6.18">so I wake up and I go to the venue you</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.08">know pay for</text>
  <text start="400.42" dur="7.25">parking park and I get to my talk there</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="6.96">at 7:30 in the morning and it was packed</text>
  <text start="407.67" dur="5.38">regardless of them putting me at the</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="5.46">earliest slot there 7:30 in the morning</text>
  <text start="413.05" dur="5.7">on the Sunday it was packed it was a</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="5.91">completely full room and in fact they</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="4.74">had to turn away dozens of people I</text>
  <text start="421.9" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t know exactly how many people they</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="5.25">had to turn away but I&amp;#39;ve had multiple</text>
  <text start="425.95" dur="5.94">people message me telling me that there</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="5.33">was dozens maybe 30 maybe 40 people that</text>
  <text start="431.89" dur="4.29">actually were not allowed into my talk</text>
  <text start="434.07" dur="3.49">some people were telling me that there</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="4.29">were folks lined up in the hallway</text>
  <text start="437.56" dur="6.84">outside of the lecture room just to hear</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="6.45">me speak so you know it kind of bummed</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="6.51">me out the fact that we had these people</text>
  <text start="446.92" dur="6.78">pay pay good money to get to this</text>
  <text start="450.91" dur="5.61">conference be allowed in and they were</text>
  <text start="453.7" dur="6.29">turned away from a lecture that they</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="6.89">should have been able to access you know</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="6.97">why wouldn&amp;#39;t this conference put me in</text>
  <text start="463.41" dur="5.32">some sort of a bigger room for everybody</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="3.93">to be able to listen to me I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="468.73" dur="6.9">but anyway people were turned away</text>
  <text start="470.89" dur="8.16">unfortunately packed room there and then</text>
  <text start="475.63" dur="8.67">I gave my talk and that was that it was</text>
  <text start="479.05" dur="6.66">a overwhelmingly positive support that I</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="4.56">got from my talk everybody was happy</text>
  <text start="485.71" dur="6.84">with it nobody walked out nobody was</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="5.67">upset they loved it now I&amp;#39;m gonna tell</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="3.87">you a little bit about what I discussed</text>
  <text start="494.53" dur="4.83">because this will help you understand</text>
  <text start="496.42" dur="6">what goes on later in this story what</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="4.86">did I discuss during my talk well you</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="4.98">know if you follow my YouTube channel</text>
  <text start="504.22" dur="5.58">and know what I like to talk about when</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="6.3">I discuss things like you f ology and</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="5.22">the whole disclosure battle for</text>
  <text start="513.7" dur="3.36">disclosure going on that was actually</text>
  <text start="515.02" dur="4.709">the name of my talk I called it the</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="4.5">battle for disclosure against the deep</text>
  <text start="519.729" dur="3.841">state or something that effect so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="4.98">essentially what I talked about and I</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="6.57">talked about disclosure in terms of UFOs</text>
  <text start="526.54" dur="5.01">so of course we have the mainstream UFO</text>
  <text start="530.14" dur="2.76">disclosures we&amp;#39;re seeing all over the</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="2.64">mainstream media right now being</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="3">spearheaded by</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="5.97">Tom DeLonge and the whole to the Stars</text>
  <text start="535.9" dur="7.2">Academy so I was discussing how it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="5.7">limited hangout and how very corrupted</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="6.27">folks like John Podesta are involved I</text>
  <text start="545.86" dur="7.44">was showing some evidence supporting the</text>
  <text start="549.37" dur="7.26">reality of pizza gate I was showing some</text>
  <text start="553.3" dur="4.89">evidence of Hillary Clinton being</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="3.93">involved in some of these UFO</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="3.72">disclosures I went back I showed</text>
  <text start="560.56" dur="3.54">something called the Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="4.5">initiative which was an initiative in</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="4.86">the early 90s where Lawrence Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="566.41" dur="5.58">in concert with John Podesta and Hillary</text>
  <text start="568.96" dur="4.95">Clinton and some other UFO researchers</text>
  <text start="571.99" dur="3.72">and actually quite a few individuals</text>
  <text start="573.91" dur="6.36">some senators and media people and</text>
  <text start="575.71" dur="7.32">whatnot they that was this initiative in</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="5.58">the early 90s for them to start getting</text>
  <text start="583.03" dur="5.76">UFO disclosure into the mainstream so I</text>
  <text start="585.85" dur="6.03">exposed the Rockefeller connections in</text>
  <text start="588.79" dur="5.43">UF ology deep state infiltration into</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="4.17">ufology like I said I was talking about</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="4.53">pizza gate I was talking about cue and</text>
  <text start="596.05" dur="7.08">on of course cue and on put some drops</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="5.7">out last year about UFOs and I said to</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="3.24">the audience you know this is something</text>
  <text start="604.45" dur="3.87">that so many people and you ethology</text>
  <text start="606.37" dur="3.42">your mission missing disclosure is</text>
  <text start="608.32" dur="3.06">already going on it&amp;#39;s already coming</text>

  <text start="611.38" dur="6.54">queuing on about UFOs and</text>
  <text start="613.66" dur="6.42">extraterrestrial life etc so yes I did</text>
  <text start="617.92" dur="5.16">get political but as you know if you</text>
  <text start="620.08" dur="5.37">follow my work that&amp;#39;s what I do and I</text>
  <text start="623.08" dur="4.92">expose a lot of deep state infiltration</text>
  <text start="625.45" dur="4.44">into many different circles that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="628" dur="4.53">a you apology conference that was a lot</text>

  <text start="638.98" dur="7.53">walked out overwhelming support now I</text>
  <text start="643.03" dur="6.3">was told that a DVD would be available</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="5.19">of my lecture just a few hours later</text>
  <text start="649.33" dur="6.53">later on in the day so I said all right</text>
  <text start="651.7" dur="6.87">and I&amp;#39;ll come back later to get that and</text>
  <text start="655.86" dur="5.83">after my talk there was a lot of people</text>
  <text start="658.57" dur="5.46">that wanted to ask me questions still</text>
  <text start="661.69" dur="4.649">wanted to talk now I had to vacate the</text>
  <text start="664.03" dur="3.54">room because there was another speaker</text>
  <text start="666.339" dur="3.331">they was going to talk right</text>
  <text start="667.57" dur="4.2">after me so I left the room and I</text>
  <text start="669.67" dur="4.53">actually went outside the venue onto</text>
  <text start="671.77" dur="6.81">this grassy area and I was sitting there</text>
  <text start="674.2" dur="5.85">with about twenty to thirty people just</text>
  <text start="678.58" dur="4.2">doing somewhat of like a roundtable</text>
  <text start="680.05" dur="4.38">discussion Q&amp;amp;A you know I wanted to be</text>
  <text start="682.78" dur="3">gracious and hang out with fans</text>
  <text start="684.43" dur="3.51">afterward all these people there to</text>
  <text start="685.78" dur="4.41">support me so I hung out for about</text>
  <text start="687.94" dur="3.75">probably an hour hour and a half talking</text>
  <text start="690.19" dur="3.84">to all these wonderful people that were</text>
  <text start="691.69" dur="5.94">outside and what&amp;#39;s interesting is that</text>
  <text start="694.03" dur="6.36">during that little kind of impromptu Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="697.63" dur="6.6">that I was doing I had a heckler I had a</text>
  <text start="700.39" dur="5.46">heckler come up and it was a really just</text>
  <text start="704.23" dur="3.51">odd experience because I was sitting</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="4.92">down talking all these people and he</text>
  <text start="707.74" dur="5.31">came up behind me and interrupted the</text>
  <text start="710.77" dur="3.93">conversation that was going on and I</text>
  <text start="713.05" dur="3.99">can&amp;#39;t quite remember exactly how he</text>
  <text start="714.7" dur="4.5">initiated the heckling we could call it</text>
  <text start="717.04" dur="4.74">but he started off talking something</text>
  <text start="719.2" dur="4.68">about the Alliance versus the deep state</text>
  <text start="721.78" dur="4.83">he was questioning that you know in a</text>
  <text start="723.88" dur="4.62">very assertive manner questioning that</text>
  <text start="726.61" dur="4.32">interrupting the question that was</text>
  <text start="728.5" dur="4.35">already going on so I turned around</text>
  <text start="730.93" dur="4.2">because he&amp;#39;s being very loud and I sort</text>
  <text start="732.85" dur="3.57">of answered him a little bit and we were</text>
  <text start="735.13" dur="3.12">getting into a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="736.42" dur="5.37">conversation because I thought he was</text>
  <text start="738.25" dur="6.27">well-meaning with what he was asking now</text>
  <text start="741.79" dur="5.13">after I answered his question I was</text>
  <text start="744.52" dur="4.11">turning around because it was a answer</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="4.05">question move on to the next format you</text>
  <text start="748.63" dur="5.49">know QA but he kept talking and he kept</text>
  <text start="750.97" dur="5.73">talking very loud and he brought up the</text>
  <text start="754.12" dur="4.23">daxing allegations there&amp;#39;s allegations</text>
  <text start="756.7" dur="3.99">that have been going around the ufology</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="5.73">community very false allegations about</text>
  <text start="760.69" dur="5.64">me being a doctor and illegally doxxing</text>
  <text start="764.08" dur="5.43">various individuals so since he brought</text>
  <text start="766.33" dur="6.39">those allegations up I literally stood</text>
  <text start="769.51" dur="6.6">up out of my chair turned to face him</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="6.92">and I answered his question in full</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="5.61">answered all the daxing allegations I</text>
  <text start="779.64" dur="4.54">completely explained to the whole</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="4.74">audience there what happened and I shut</text>
  <text start="784.18" dur="4.44">him down because these are very very</text>
  <text start="786.46" dur="4.14">false phony allegations that continue to</text>
  <text start="788.62" dur="3.54">get circulated around so I felt the need</text>
  <text start="790.6" dur="3.93">boom to put it to rest</text>
  <text start="792.16" dur="4.73">I in fact even got like a 10 to 13</text>
  <text start="794.53" dur="6.81">minute video of this whole situation and</text>
  <text start="796.89" dur="7.78">this is when he became hostile and</text>
  <text start="801.34" dur="7.53">loud he started yelling when he kept</text>
  <text start="804.67" dur="7.14">asking questions the people that were</text>
  <text start="808.87" dur="4.98">there the attendees started pretty much</text>
  <text start="811.81" dur="3.51">yelling at him telling him you know wait</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="4.38">your turn shut up go away</text>
  <text start="815.32" dur="5.61">stop being so hostile and trying to take</text>
  <text start="818.23" dur="5.4">over this QA this discussion we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="820.93" dur="4.77">just trying to have and he started</text>
  <text start="823.63" dur="5.34">calling people a cult this is exactly</text>
  <text start="825.7" dur="5.28">what a cult does I believe he said these</text>
  <text start="828.97" dur="3.63">people are all defending you like a cult</text>
  <text start="830.98" dur="3.06">he kept claiming that I didn&amp;#39;t answer</text>
  <text start="832.6" dur="3.12">his question there was actually a couple</text>
  <text start="834.04" dur="3.33">other individuals I don&amp;#39;t know if they</text>
  <text start="835.72" dur="3.87">were there with him but they were</text>
  <text start="837.37" dur="3.57">parroting the same narratives trying to</text>
  <text start="839.59" dur="2.25">claim that I wasn&amp;#39;t answering the</text>
  <text start="840.94" dur="2.43">question or something like that when I</text>
  <text start="841.84" dur="4.38">literally stood up and answered it and</text>
  <text start="843.37" dur="5.55">it was just absurd and in fact this guy</text>
  <text start="846.22" dur="4.89">he even had a press pass this is the</text>
  <text start="848.92" dur="5.55">really weird part to me he had a press</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="5.85">pass so I don&amp;#39;t know how he got that</text>
  <text start="854.47" dur="4.5">press pass I didn&amp;#39;t know who he was at</text>
  <text start="856.96" dur="4.53">the time I know who he is now but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="858.97" dur="4.64">gonna refrain from saying any names in</text>
  <text start="861.49" dur="5.55">this video just because keeping it a</text>
  <text start="863.61" dur="6.04">low-key like that but very weird to me</text>
  <text start="867.04" dur="4.62">that this guy got a press pass and he</text>
  <text start="869.65" dur="4.49">really took it upon himself to come</text>
  <text start="871.66" dur="5.79">heckle me spread these false allegations</text>
  <text start="874.14" dur="5.02">become hostile try to yell from the back</text>
  <text start="877.45" dur="2.94">over this discussion I was having and</text>
  <text start="879.16" dur="3.21">the attendees that were there it was</text>
  <text start="880.39" dur="6.63">just very very odd he finally walked off</text>
  <text start="882.37" dur="5.96">and the situation de-escalated luckily</text>
  <text start="887.02" dur="3.66">with no violence or anything like that</text>
  <text start="888.33" dur="4.63">it was peaceful but it got a little</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="5.34">heated there because he was getting</text>
  <text start="892.96" dur="7.05">hostile so anyway finished up that Q&amp;amp;A I</text>
  <text start="896.02" dur="5.79">went back to my Airbnb and I was hanging</text>
  <text start="900.01" dur="2.37">out just waiting for my workshop later</text>
  <text start="901.81" dur="4.02">in the day</text>
  <text start="902.38" dur="6.36">when I got a call from David Wilcock so</text>

  <text start="919.39" dur="4.14">controversial things and we discussed</text>
  <text start="921.43" dur="3.51">that for a moment and I mentioned to him</text>
  <text start="923.53" dur="3.06">that I didn&amp;#39;t have a panel over the</text>
  <text start="924.94" dur="2.94">weekend I was like David I was supposed</text>
  <text start="926.59" dur="3.84">to have a panel but I didn&amp;#39;t have one</text>
  <text start="927.88" dur="4.8">and he actually said well actually I</text>
  <text start="930.43" dur="4.23">have a panel that I&amp;#39;m hosting that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="932.68" dur="4.23">coming up in about Oh 40 minutes</text>

  <text start="936.91" dur="4.71">special guest David actually offered to</text>
  <text start="939.819" dur="4.291">bring me onto the panel that he was</text>
  <text start="941.62" dur="4.8">hosting as his special guest because I</text>
  <text start="944.11" dur="4.11">didn&amp;#39;t get one you know that&amp;#39;s it was</text>
  <text start="946.42" dur="3.12">actually a very nice gesture that he did</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="3.299">he really didn&amp;#39;t have to do that so I</text>
  <text start="949.54" dur="4.109">said yeah okay I&amp;#39;ll do it</text>
  <text start="951.519" dur="4.38">heck yeah so I took a really quick</text>
  <text start="953.649" dur="5.13">shower got dressed I went to the venue</text>
  <text start="955.899" dur="5.04">and went to the ballroom that it was in</text>

  <text start="965.62" dur="7.889">then we went up on the panel and David</text>
  <text start="969.16" dur="6.84">ended up eventually getting into some</text>
  <text start="973.509" dur="7.38">pretty political topics say</text>
  <text start="976" dur="6.24">controversial topics as some people have</text>
  <text start="980.889" dur="2.791">various perspectives on these things</text>
  <text start="982.24" dur="2.67">from time to time but like I said you</text>
  <text start="983.68" dur="3.209">know these are the things that I talk</text>
  <text start="984.91" dur="4.77">about on my channel this is what I am</text>
  <text start="986.889" dur="7.44">passionate at educating the public about</text>
  <text start="989.68" dur="7.8">and informing about so that was that I</text>
  <text start="994.329" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t know why they didn&amp;#39;t expect me to</text>
  <text start="997.48" dur="4.349">go there something that effect so we</text>

  <text start="1017.97" dur="5.46">in the crowd that were a little upset</text>
  <text start="1021.569" dur="5.34">and walked out</text>

  <text start="1435.71" dur="5.76">here&amp;#39;s another lie as Wilcock told me I</text>
  <text start="1439.34" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t use that word that was the last</text>

  <text start="1467.66" dur="3.69">look at this tweet I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="1469.19" dur="5.52">why are they bringing David Wilcock into</text>
  <text start="1471.35" dur="6.36">this it&amp;#39;s as if there&amp;#39;s some serious gas</text>

  <text start="1493.01" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s incredible to me to see this tweet</text>
  <text start="1494.75" dur="7.05">from this organization that claims to be</text>
  <text start="1498.53" dur="5.64">about higher consciousness the second</text>
  <text start="1501.8" dur="5.85">tweet everyone was informed that we can</text>

  <text start="1543.2" dur="6.12">II would like proof about that measly</text>
  <text start="1546.83" dur="4.26">little three number quite frankly I</text>
  <text start="1549.32" dur="3.96">think that might be another thing that</text>
  <text start="1551.09" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re making up and then the last line</text>
  <text start="1553.28" dur="3.36">you can order the DVD by emailing us at</text>

  <text start="1575.54" dur="4.92">forward I think one of the reasons I</text>
  <text start="1577.72" dur="4.77">read in one of the emails is that it was</text>

  <text start="1846.08" dur="2.91">community the truth community especially</text>
  <text start="1847.46" dur="3.09">you have followed you doesn&amp;#39;t matter you</text>
  <text start="1848.99" dur="3.86">know my my goal is to bring honesty</text>
  <text start="1850.55" dur="5.79">integrity back as much as I can</text>
  <text start="1852.85" dur="6.04">everywhere so what I think we should do</text>
  <text start="1856.34" dur="5.3">is start investing our time our energy</text>
  <text start="1858.89" dur="5.94">our money into individuals and</text>
  <text start="1861.64" dur="5.47">organizations that are relevant that do</text>
  <text start="1864.83" dur="4.05">speak about these very important topics</text>
  <text start="1867.11" dur="3.049">that so many others are scared to that</text>
  <text start="1868.88" dur="3.72">so many others avoid</text>
  <text start="1870.159" dur="5.14">invest our time and our money and our</text>
  <text start="1872.6" dur="5.549">energy in people with substance who are</text>
  <text start="1875.299" dur="4.771">authentic and honest and ethical and</text>
  <text start="1878.149" dur="4.111">have integrity okay</text>
  <text start="1880.07" dur="3.989">just like Buckminster Fuller said in</text>
  <text start="1882.26" dur="3.96">that quote I&amp;#39;ll paraphrase here he</text>
  <text start="1884.059" dur="5.071">basically said don&amp;#39;t worry about this</text>
  <text start="1886.22" dur="5.339">failing paradigm over here turn your</text>
  <text start="1889.13" dur="5.279">eyes turn your attention and focus on</text>
  <text start="1891.559" dur="5.641">put your energy towards a paradigm</text>
  <text start="1894.409" dur="4.201">that&amp;#39;s much better for us so I think</text>
  <text start="1897.2" dur="3.329">that&amp;#39;s really what we need to start</text>
  <text start="1898.61" dur="4.38">doing and quite frankly you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1900.529" dur="4.471">want to see contact in the desert</text>
  <text start="1902.99" dur="3.51">fail they&amp;#39;ve built a good brand for</text>
  <text start="1905" dur="3.539">themselves there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="1906.5" dur="4.86">go there every year with well intentions</text>
  <text start="1908.539" dur="5.13">people that do want to raise their</text>
  <text start="1911.36" dur="4.799">consciousness and awareness and and see</text>
  <text start="1913.669" dur="4.411">substance so I don&amp;#39;t want to see them</text>
  <text start="1916.159" dur="5.041">fail but if they&amp;#39;re gonna continue</text>
  <text start="1918.08" dur="5.67">making bad choices and acting without</text>
  <text start="1921.2" dur="5.099">integrity well that needs to be known</text>
  <text start="1923.75" dur="4.409">that needs to be shared so I&amp;#39;m more than</text>
  <text start="1926.299" dur="3.721">happy to go back but they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="1928.159" dur="4.351">to prove their integrity and in fact I</text>
