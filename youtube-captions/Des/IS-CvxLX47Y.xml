  <text start="396.94" dur="3.72">Jim Watkins was in Reno</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="3.81">few days ago he uploaded a video to his</text>
  <text start="400.66" dur="4.77">YouTube channel and he basically said</text>
  <text start="402.13" dur="5.97">that 8chan right now is voluntarily down</text>

  <text start="1513.41" dur="4.41">centralize everything so they</text>
  <text start="1515.66" dur="5.12">centralized media you got five</text>
  <text start="1517.82" dur="5.46">corporations that own like 95% of media</text>
  <text start="1520.78" dur="6.07">same thing in the medical system you got</text>
  <text start="1523.28" dur="6.33">five journals that publish pretty much</text>
  <text start="1526.85" dur="4.32">all the research out there five science</text>
  <text start="1529.61" dur="6.06">journals five you know they centralized</text>
  <text start="1531.17" dur="8.22">that&amp;#39;s how they that&amp;#39;s a modus operandi</text>
  <text start="1535.67" dur="6.509">so in one of their centralized journals</text>
  <text start="1539.39" dur="5.669">that jemma there&amp;#39;s a study that came out</text>
