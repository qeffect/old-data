  <text start="12.71" dur="4.9">what&amp;#39;s going on guys July 12th Jordan</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="5.251">state through here and what I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="17.61" dur="6.329">in this update is talk to you a little</text>
  <text start="21.06" dur="5.67">bit more about the earth changes going</text>
  <text start="23.939" dur="4.621">on one of the stories that I did report</text>
  <text start="26.73" dur="4.32">on a couple days ago and a couple of new</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="7.02">ones and then I&amp;#39;m gonna also discuss a</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="7.23">lot of the soft disclosures creeping out</text>
  <text start="35.58" dur="7.229">through the mainstream media and put</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="7.41">some perspective on a lot of why and how</text>
  <text start="42.809" dur="4.68">and when that&amp;#39;s all happening so I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="45.69" dur="2.969">talk about that all in a minute but</text>
  <text start="47.489" dur="3.6">first of all I want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="48.659" dur="4.741">earth changes and the first story I have</text>
  <text start="51.089" dur="3.511">on here is that Yellowstone lava story</text>
  <text start="53.4" dur="6">that I reported about a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="8.48">I think that is actual fake news my bad</text>
  <text start="59.4" dur="7.829">for not verifying it a little deeper but</text>
  <text start="63.08" dur="5.8">this story I mean a lot of people were</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="5.701">talking to me about being actual fake</text>
  <text start="68.88" dur="6.059">news at first the thickness I saw or at</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="4.68">least the debunking report that I saw</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="5.671">came from Snopes and we all know how BS</text>
  <text start="77.61" dur="4.38">Snopes is so I was like ah you know of</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="4.62">course they would debunk it they try to</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="5.4">debunk everything but this story you</text>
  <text start="85.23" dur="3.84">know as I thought about a little more</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="2.85">researched a little more I did research</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="2.76">into where it came from</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="4.83">looks like it just came from out of the</text>
  <text start="91.83" dur="6.69">blue out of nowhere and if this actually</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="9.05">was happening I&amp;#39;m sure it would be more</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="9.17">reported than it is and also in terms of</text>
  <text start="104.12" dur="6.43">this story I do want to make a note</text>
  <text start="107.69" dur="4.63">whether this was planted on purpose or</text>
  <text start="110.55" dur="3.84">not we&amp;#39;re not gonna speculate on that we</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="3.87">know it&amp;#39;s probably fake let&amp;#39;s just move</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="4.38">on from it but I want to make a point</text>
  <text start="116.19" dur="6.42">about actual fake news sometimes fake</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="6.57">news stories are made on purpose and</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="4.83">then debunked by the very people that</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="5.16">made them such as Snopes and a lot of</text>
  <text start="127.44" dur="7.89">the mainstream media outlets so for</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="6.959">instance if the deep state or you know</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="4.34">that group of people they made an actual</text>
  <text start="137.459" dur="6.271">fake story and then they used their</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="6.3">mainstream media syndicates to debunk it</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="3.92">that would then look like the</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="3.45">Syndicates whatever they use whether it</text>
  <text start="147.65" dur="3.51">was Snopes or whatnot would gain more</text>
  <text start="149.42" dur="3.81">credibility that way do you see so</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="4.86">sometimes they&amp;#39;ll actually plant true</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="5.07">fake stories for them to debunk and look</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="5.04">better with so whether this was that</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="6.06">maybe not maybe it was planted out there</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="5.79">to stir up some stuff in the truth and</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="3.72">crowd who knows but just one throw that</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="5.33">out there probably actually fake news</text>
  <text start="168.08" dur="6.75">next the ring in the sky this one I</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="5.74">don&amp;#39;t think is fake so I&amp;#39;m gonna point</text>
  <text start="174.83" dur="5.79">you towards a facebook video that came</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="6.87">out on July 8th here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="6.51">it here&amp;#39;s another screenshot of it this</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="4.23">you know I can&amp;#39;t post the video on here</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="3">go check it out on her face but she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.02" dur="4.71">the one that took it I don&amp;#39;t know her</text>
  <text start="190.13" dur="7.579">name but her name was you know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="6.42">even gonna say it go check the link but</text>
  <text start="197.709" dur="4.121">that doesn&amp;#39;t look fake and apparently</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="2.97">according to her video which actually I</text>
  <text start="201.83" dur="2.85">mean there&amp;#39;s a bunch of people lined up</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="6.24">on the side of the road and she&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="6.839">talking and you can tell by the voice</text>
  <text start="209.36" dur="4.29">inflections and what was going on that</text>
  <text start="211.519" dur="3.871">this does not seem fake apparently this</text>
  <text start="213.65" dur="3.96">ring in the sky was lasting for like at</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="3.87">least 15 to 20 minutes and if you look</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="4.379">at it it&amp;#39;s almost perfectly spherical</text>
  <text start="219.26" dur="4.86">now some people sent me some articles</text>
  <text start="221.989" dur="4.291">and I saw some stuff around saying that</text>
  <text start="224.12" dur="4.53">sometimes smoke rings can occur in the</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="3.72">sky because of either transformers or</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="4.92">fireworks or things like that</text>
  <text start="230" dur="5.01">and you know good skeptical thinking</text>
  <text start="233.57" dur="2.46">good critical thinking trying to see</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="2.82">what it actually was</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="5.489">but when you look at this thing it</text>
  <text start="237.83" dur="5.61">lasted for 15 minutes she said no smoke</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="3.361">ring is gonna last 15 minutes it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="4.14">dissipate by then and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="4.669">shape of it it is this perfect sphere</text>
  <text start="247.58" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s way up in the sky</text>
  <text start="249.549" dur="5.261">so yeah it&amp;#39;s legitimate to say it might</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="4.65">be a smoke ring that&amp;#39;s good thinking but</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="4.35">a little more thinking leads you to</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="3.81">conclude or at least it leads me to</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="4.98">conclude that this is not a smoke ring</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="5.599">so what the heck is it you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.14" dur="6.12">a lot of different speculations that I</text>
  <text start="266.979" dur="6.151">could offer you for it some of the ones</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="6.81">I wrote on Facebook I&amp;#39;ll just read here</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="5.56">I mean it could be an example of the</text>
  <text start="277.07" dur="1.98">earth changes or the cosmic changes</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="1.32">right</text>
  <text start="279.05" dur="4.56">maybe this</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="5.94">on the earth was over some intersecting</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="4.74">ley lines maybe there&amp;#39;s some increased</text>
  <text start="285.95" dur="4.74">energetics around that spot maybe a</text>
  <text start="288.35" dur="5.25">portal just vortex open in the sky</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="5.7">something of that sort that&amp;#39;s one option</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="6.12">could very well be maybe this is an</text>
  <text start="296.39" dur="4.97">actual UFO stunt maybe you know that you</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="4.77">saying UFO could be either</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="6.91">extraterrestrial or man-made so we know</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="5.94">that there&amp;#39;s ET races that want to open</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="4.35">you know offer themselves to us divulge</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="4.89">themselves to us per se and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="6.57">factions within earth-based secret space</text>
  <text start="315.32" dur="6.81">programs that want to open themselves up</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="4.8">to us as well so this UFO show it could</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="4.2">be you know could be from either of</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="5.04">those factions either of those groups</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="5.64">could be non terrestrial or earth-based</text>
  <text start="329.03" dur="5.22">right it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s the showing of a UFO</text>
  <text start="331.97" dur="4.38">without actually showing something that</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="3.18">is a legitimate or looks exactly like a</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="3.33">UFO because that it makes people</text>
  <text start="337.43" dur="6.33">question without freaking out you see</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s an easier way to put this on to</text>
  <text start="343.76" dur="4.86">their conscience with but it could also</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="2.67">be a test of some holographic</text>
  <text start="348.62" dur="4.76">technologies right</text>
  <text start="349.91" dur="5.76">we know Project Blue Beam esque</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="4.83">holographic technologies like that could</text>
  <text start="355.67" dur="4.92">exist it could have been a test of it</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="4.42">you know I won&amp;#39;t get too far into</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="3.69">Project Blue Beam here but could very</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="4.14">well be granted I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="4.74">viable option because enough people know</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="4.5">of Project Blue Beam now where they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="5.63">probably be able to wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="371.27" dur="5.91">be pulled per se that false flag and</text>
  <text start="374.65" dur="3.79">could&amp;#39;ve been faked right so he&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="3.36">option to throw on the table and tell</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="5.91">something is pretty much beyond a shadow</text>
  <text start="380.54" dur="6.21">of a doubt proven true but again we I</text>
  <text start="384.35" dur="4.26">kind of already went over the likelihood</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="5.07">of the fakeness of it and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="388.61" dur="4.8">so so I want to show you this I wanted</text>
  <text start="391.82" dur="3.6">to show this to you guys cuz it kind of</text>
  <text start="393.41" dur="3.99">blew me away and let me scratch my head</text>
  <text start="395.42" dur="3.63">for a little bit and then I also saw</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="4.38">another facebook video that was from</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="5.19">July 6th I saw this one just this</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="6.09">morning and it came out of Georgia but</text>
  <text start="404.24" dur="5.64">on this Facebook video I I saw it what</text>
  <text start="407.87" dur="4.44">it was it was about a seven-minute video</text>
  <text start="409.88" dur="4.06">of this giant light in the sky it was a</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="3.1">person driving who&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="2.94">this video and as they pulled into the</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="3.39">parking lot they shot it for an extra</text>
  <text start="416.88" dur="3.3">couple minutes and it was this big it</text>
  <text start="418.8" dur="3.36">was just like a light and at first it</text>
  <text start="420.18" dur="4.41">looked like the Sun in the sky but then</text>
  <text start="422.16" dur="4.98">it just sort of rose turned into like a</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="6.09">geometric triangle and dissipated now</text>
  <text start="427.14" dur="6.84">when I tried to look this video back up</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="5.46">right before I did this video it was</text>
  <text start="433.98" dur="4.23">deleted from Facebook so it actually</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="4.35">said you know this attachment or this</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="5.91">person whatever could not exist error</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="5.52">message from Facebook so I know I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="444.12" dur="3.9">offer any proof of me seeing it but I</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="3.63">did see this and it&amp;#39;s deleted from</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="4.43">Facebook now so that&amp;#39;s real weird but</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="6.33">you can still go see this one which is a</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="5.86">little more weird little weirder the</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="4.14">ring in the sky so earth changes right</text>
  <text start="458.31" dur="5.34">and again like my video I said on the</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="6.45">tenth there are so many changes going on</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.76">not just on the earth but in the earth</text>
  <text start="466.56" dur="6.33">and above the earth and in our solar</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="6.9">system and in our galaxy and our cosmos</text>
  <text start="472.89" dur="6.18">right there&amp;#39;s changes going on at every</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="4.65">single level so we&amp;#39;re gonna be seeing a</text>
  <text start="479.07" dur="6.06">lot more weird stuff I&amp;#39;m gonna keep</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="7.47">covering it and understand that if you</text>
  <text start="485.13" dur="6.45">see weird things in the sky it could be</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="6.6">a UFO from another civilization it could</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.25">be a UFO that&amp;#39;s been made in secret</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="5.42">government projects or it could be</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="6.41">example of changes that are going on on</text>
  <text start="500.45" dur="5.08">every level right now so there probably</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="5.62">will be weird things that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="505.53" dur="7.65">start seeing or feeling or any of that</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="6.809">sort don&amp;#39;t freak out ride the wave a</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="4.02">change don&amp;#39;t let it suck you under so</text>
  <text start="515.669" dur="4.081">that&amp;#39;s what I have to say about that</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="6.269">now let&amp;#39;s get into some of the free</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="4.5">energy and soft disclosure stuff that</text>
  <text start="523.469" dur="3.841">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="9.56">media and what I want to say before we</text>
  <text start="527.31" dur="10.64">get into all of this is what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="7.18">on this planet right now is because the</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="5.139">deep state or the new world order or the</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="4.17">dark forces the allure minority</text>
  <text start="543.089" dur="4.621">whatever you want to call them because</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re getting so exposed</text>
  <text start="547.71" dur="4.59">many people are waking up to them the</text>
  <text start="549.72" dur="5.82">consciousness revolution is occurring</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="7.02">it&amp;#39;s such a breakneck speed they are</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="7.35">trying to divulge its much information</text>
  <text start="559.32" dur="6.84">as they can without divulging that</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="5.12">information that implicates them so what</text>
  <text start="566.16" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="568.01" dur="6.28">disclose a lot of stuff like free energy</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="4.62">and the technologies that have been</text>
  <text start="574.29" dur="3.57">locked away in the black projects for</text>
  <text start="576.12" dur="4.2">years and years and years and just all</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="5.85">this stuff that&amp;#39;s gonna wow the out</text>
  <text start="580.32" dur="5.13">of the mainstream population but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.71" dur="3.06">gonna be so wowed by the stuff that</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re gonna disclose that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="586.77" dur="4.56">even gonna realize that there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="588.93" dur="5.58">more out there do you see that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="591.33" dur="5.91">the idea of partial disclosure versus</text>
  <text start="594.51" dur="5.88">full disclosure so a partial disclosure</text>
  <text start="597.24" dur="4.86">are these groups trying to get out all</text>
  <text start="600.39" dur="3.33">this information but only giving you a</text>
  <text start="602.1" dur="4.35">little bit of it enough to distract</text>
  <text start="603.72" dur="5.43">people but to hide the rest of their</text>
  <text start="606.45" dur="5.76">crimes or what else they&amp;#39;re hiding from</text>
  <text start="609.15" dur="4.85">us right versus full disclosure full</text>
  <text start="612.21" dur="3.87">disclosure is then coming out and</text>
  <text start="614" dur="3.7">admitting that we&amp;#39;ve had basically</text>
  <text start="616.08" dur="3.15">secret space programs on this earth for</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="3.69">almost a hundred years now</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="3.87">since the time of the Germans full</text>
  <text start="621.39" dur="3.93">disclosure is them coming out saying</text>

  <text start="636.84" dur="6.69">so many what I want to say people into</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="4.77">really weird stuff in high political and</text>
  <text start="643.53" dur="4.86">corporate office buy weird stuff I mean</text>

  <text start="652.02" dur="3.81">stuff out there so that&amp;#39;s full</text>
  <text start="653.13" dur="3.99">disclosure right versus partial what</text>
  <text start="655.83" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re trying to do in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="657.12" dur="3.87">media right now is put so much</text>
  <text start="659.4" dur="5.13">information out there that&amp;#39;s of the</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="6.6">partial disclosure narrative okay so for</text>
  <text start="664.53" dur="8.19">instance just today scientists teleport</text>
  <text start="667.59" dur="7.5">photon 300 miles into space huh Star</text>
  <text start="672.72" dur="6.98">Trek tech still way off says the</text>
  <text start="675.09" dur="6.3">Guardian but they said this proves that</text>
  <text start="679.7" dur="4.39">quantum entanglement</text>
  <text start="681.39" dur="4.98">is a thing now quantum entanglement of</text>
  <text start="684.09" dur="3.93">course is that idea that all points in</text>
  <text start="686.37" dur="4.82">space and time are connected that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.02" dur="6.59">pretty much it that&amp;#39;s the main</text>
  <text start="691.19" dur="6.01">foundation of you know all of the</text>
  <text start="694.61" dur="4.72">science that is science and all of the</text>
  <text start="697.2" dur="7.4">spirituality that is spirituality all</text>
  <text start="699.33" dur="8.19">points in space / time are connected now</text>
  <text start="704.6" dur="3.88">that has been found out again as I</text>
  <text start="707.52" dur="3">mentioned just a couple minutes ago</text>
  <text start="708.48" dur="6.89">secret space programs have been on this</text>
  <text start="710.52" dur="9.39">earth for decades since World War two</text>
  <text start="715.37" dur="7.78">since at least the 30s and 40s I want to</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="6.68">say so this has been done right they</text>
  <text start="723.15" dur="6.33">figured this out in the black projects</text>
  <text start="726.59" dur="4.45">but like I said so many people are</text>
  <text start="729.48" dur="2.67">waking up to these facts like little owe</text>
  <text start="731.04" dur="3.15">me with my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="732.15" dur="3.57">thousands of people tens hundreds of</text>
  <text start="734.19" dur="3.48">thousands of people are waking up to the</text>
  <text start="735.72" dur="3.42">fact that technology has existed for</text>
  <text start="737.67" dur="4.26">years and years and years they have to</text>
  <text start="739.14" dur="5.13">rush all this out you see so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="741.93" dur="4.02">like every week there&amp;#39;s some new science</text>
  <text start="744.27" dur="3.63">articles saying oh quantum entanglement</text>
  <text start="745.95" dur="3.42">now it&amp;#39;s a theory now it&amp;#39;s a test now</text>
  <text start="747.9" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s been successfully tested now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="749.37" dur="4.89">been done now they&amp;#39;re teleporting this</text>
  <text start="751.08" dur="6.03">and this and this and this so understand</text>
  <text start="754.26" dur="4.32">that and when they say a photon they</text>
  <text start="757.11" dur="4.29">teleport of Photon</text>
  <text start="758.58" dur="5.88">just as a side tangent here that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="761.4" dur="6.6">really interesting because what is a</text>
  <text start="764.46" dur="5.88">photon it&amp;#39;s a packet of information it</text>
  <text start="768" dur="4.2">could be considered that so they said</text>
  <text start="770.34" dur="2.55">they&amp;#39;ve teleported essentially a packet</text>
  <text start="772.2" dur="5.69">of information</text>
  <text start="772.89" dur="7.08">well when spacecraft teleport itself</text>
  <text start="777.89" dur="5.26">basically turns itself into a giant</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="6.63">photon and then D materializes and REE</text>
  <text start="783.15" dur="6.06">materializes elsewhere so you know as</text>
  <text start="786.6" dur="4.8">above so below on the smallest scale</text>
  <text start="789.21" dur="3.9">they just teleported one photon because</text>
  <text start="791.4" dur="3.78">of course they&amp;#39;re sliding this out into</text>
  <text start="793.11" dur="3.9">the mainstream world right now but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="795.18" dur="4.14">that same concept at a greater scale</text>
  <text start="797.01" dur="3.9">when other things teleport whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="799.32" dur="4.71">a human or a spacecraft or anything like</text>
  <text start="800.91" dur="5.73">that so tangent they&amp;#39;re quantum</text>
  <text start="804.03" dur="6.51">entanglement does exist for any sized</text>
  <text start="806.64" dur="5.58">thing you want to do with it next DARPA</text>
  <text start="810.54" dur="4.5">Awards a contract to make a two-way</text>
  <text start="812.22" dur="5.46">brain computer interface and</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="4.77">always seems to be that bridge between</text>
  <text start="817.68" dur="4.17">the covert projects and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="819.81" dur="4.56">realm so whenever they want to slide</text>
  <text start="821.85" dur="5.07">some stuff out into the public they</text>
  <text start="824.37" dur="4.83">always use DARPA so DARPA stands for the</text>
  <text start="826.92" dur="4.92">Defense Advanced Research Projects</text>
  <text start="829.2" dur="4.53">Agency so they try to claim that DARPA</text>
  <text start="831.84" dur="5.64">is the most advanced on the market</text>
  <text start="833.73" dur="5.88">but it&amp;#39;s really just that bridge between</text>
  <text start="837.48" dur="4.05">the ungodly amount of stuff they already</text>
  <text start="839.61" dur="3.6">have and they&amp;#39;re trying to seep out a</text>
  <text start="841.53" dur="3.99">little bit of whatever they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="843.21" dur="5.04">discovered or reverse engineered or all</text>
  <text start="845.52" dur="5.6">that jazz into the public domain whether</text>
  <text start="848.25" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s to like monetize something or</text>
  <text start="851.12" dur="4.78">whatever the case may be</text>
  <text start="853.44" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s what darvis for and in this case</text>
  <text start="855.9" dur="5.25">I think DARPA is being used just to</text>
  <text start="857.49" dur="4.95">slide out some soft disclosures and when</text>
  <text start="861.15" dur="4.32">it comes to the two-way brain computer</text>
  <text start="862.44" dur="5.25">interface what&amp;#39;s been told to me I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="865.47" dur="3.63">remember who told me this but you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="867.69" dur="5">find this information out multiple</text>
  <text start="869.1" dur="5.22">places when it comes to piloting</text>
  <text start="872.69" dur="3.88">extraterrestrial specifically non</text>
  <text start="874.32" dur="5.34">terrestrial quad crafts because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.57" dur="4.89">what we reverse engineered from when</text>
  <text start="879.66" dur="3.81">they found a lot of these crashed craft</text>
  <text start="881.46" dur="3.48">they came with brain computer interfaces</text>
  <text start="883.47" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s how the nonterrestrials in the</text>
  <text start="884.94" dur="5.73">ETS would pilot their craft is through</text>
  <text start="888.06" dur="5.97">simply thought and even the craft itself</text>
  <text start="890.67" dur="5.97">was made from thought it was made from</text>
  <text start="894.03" dur="3.63">the ETS consciousness because and they</text>
  <text start="896.64" dur="7.08">could tell that because there was no</text>
  <text start="897.66" dur="8.85">rivets so in early space program craft</text>
  <text start="903.72" dur="4.89">that they made for instance like the</text>
  <text start="906.51" dur="4.11">Nazi Bell craft and whatnot in the 40s</text>
  <text start="908.61" dur="4.11">they could tell it was a man-made craft</text>
  <text start="910.62" dur="3.69">because there was rivets in it in the et</text>
  <text start="912.72" dur="3.84">craft it would be a completely smooth</text>
  <text start="914.31" dur="5.16">surface with no rivets because it was</text>
  <text start="916.56" dur="5.4">simply the consciousness of the ET being</text>
  <text start="919.47" dur="5.64">that would bring that matter into</text>
  <text start="921.96" dur="5.22">existence and certain brain computer</text>
  <text start="925.11" dur="3.72">interfaces within the craft would boost</text>
  <text start="927.18" dur="3.84">their consciousness powers to be able to</text>
  <text start="928.83" dur="4.8">do that so there would be certain chairs</text>
  <text start="931.02" dur="5.79">or things like that that they would use</text>
  <text start="933.63" dur="5.79">to enhance different interfaces they</text>
  <text start="936.81" dur="5.55">would use to enhance their conscious</text>
  <text start="939.42" dur="4.59">abilities to create matter and to do</text>
  <text start="942.36" dur="4.29">materialized or ships and all that jazz</text>
  <text start="944.01" dur="4.38">and speed around so there&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="946.65" dur="4.65">of information on that</text>
  <text start="948.39" dur="4.41">again we could you know go on so many</text>
  <text start="951.3" dur="5.909">tangents with each of these news stories</text>
  <text start="952.8" dur="5.84">so a super-secret SSP technology that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="957.209" dur="3.331">probably been around for a long time</text>
  <text start="958.64" dur="4">finally making its way in the public</text>
  <text start="960.54" dur="3.96">light then we have futurism I saw a</text>
  <text start="962.64" dur="5.189">couple interesting articles on futurism</text>
  <text start="964.5" dur="7.5">which is one of my favorite mainstream</text>
  <text start="967.829" dur="5.82">science rags in futures and they love</text>
  <text start="972" dur="3.75">their artificial intelligence there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="973.649" dur="3.511">always another you know AI is the next</text>
  <text start="975.75" dur="3.959">best thing when it comes to futurism and</text>
  <text start="977.16" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s so much corporate science BS on</text>
  <text start="979.709" dur="3.661">futurism like they love their vaccines</text>
  <text start="981.57" dur="3.9">and they love their global warming</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="4.79">shtick but anyway when it came to these</text>
  <text start="985.47" dur="6">soft disclosures I saw one article about</text>
  <text start="988.16" dur="6.04">floating images and this holographic</text>
  <text start="991.47" dur="5.94">display and then another article about a</text>
  <text start="994.2" dur="6.629">holographic phone being on the market as</text>
  <text start="997.41" dur="5.94">early as 2018 now of course many a</text>
  <text start="1000.829" dur="6.661">whistleblower has said they already have</text>
  <text start="1003.35" dur="5.37">this stuff whether it be like smart pads</text>
  <text start="1007.49" dur="3.57">you could bring up any kind of</text>
  <text start="1008.72" dur="2.76">information on or whatever the case may</text>
  <text start="1011.06" dur="2.88">be</text>
  <text start="1011.48" dur="5.16">they already have this stuff in covert</text>
  <text start="1013.94" dur="4.44">projects and a lot you know a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1016.64" dur="3.36">movies that we see is basically the</text>
  <text start="1018.38" dur="3.87">truth in plain sight so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1020" dur="3.93">like Minority Report for instance when</text>
  <text start="1022.25" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s slidin around that interface and</text>
  <text start="1023.93" dur="4.83">they can just use their fingers there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1026.9" dur="5.76">3d like Star Wars</text>
  <text start="1028.76" dur="6.449">there&amp;#39;s 3d projections that can already</text>
  <text start="1032.66" dur="3.96">be done right Holograms holographic it</text>
  <text start="1035.209" dur="4.801">like the Project Blue Beam that I</text>
  <text start="1036.62" dur="7.26">mentioned up here they already have this</text>

  <text start="1043.88" dur="4.799">we&amp;#39;re led to believe so there&amp;#39;s that</text>

  <text start="1052.22" dur="5.24">that they&amp;#39;ve had in the black projects</text>
  <text start="1053.45" dur="6.51">for a while now it&amp;#39;s exactly how they</text>

  <text start="1068.299" dur="5.191">is and men and black right there with</text>
  <text start="1071.66" dur="4.44">Will Smith in his little bit you know I</text>
  <text start="1073.49" dur="5.28">can remember this anymore device been</text>
  <text start="1076.1" dur="5.91">done been done and then this one was</text>
  <text start="1078.77" dur="5.85">super interesting I saw this on</text>
  <text start="1082.01" dur="4.65">Tyler it says India is about to be the</text>

  <text start="1088.91" dur="4.71">and on about how you know this is gonna</text>
  <text start="1091.37" dur="5.46">change the renewable energy game and all</text>
  <text start="1093.62" dur="5.31">yada yada but what it said and it was</text>
  <text start="1096.83" dur="3.96">talking about a fast breeder test</text>
  <text start="1098.93" dur="6.72">reactor or whatever you know cool new</text>
  <text start="1100.79" dur="8.01">nuclear technology but a one line in</text>
  <text start="1105.65" dur="6.15">this that I want to say to you guys was</text>
  <text start="1108.8" dur="5.34">this one right here this type of reactor</text>
  <text start="1111.8" dur="7.44">is capable of generating more fuel than</text>

  <text start="1122.51" dur="3.6">being slipped right into the public</text>
  <text start="1125.27" dur="2.37">domain right there</text>
  <text start="1126.11" dur="3.93">and there&amp;#39;s also been many articles</text>
  <text start="1127.64" dur="5.01">coming out about cold fusion recently as</text>
  <text start="1130.04" dur="5.04">well with them saying cold fusion is</text>
  <text start="1132.65" dur="4.32">this you know we&amp;#39;re one step away from</text>

  <text start="1154.73" dur="7.11">and then lastly the one I want to get to</text>
  <text start="1157.85" dur="6.63">is an article about Tesla and of course</text>
  <text start="1161.84" dur="7.53">I reported on this two days ago it was</text>
  <text start="1164.48" dur="7.74">Tesla&amp;#39;s birthday on that day The</text>
  <text start="1169.37" dur="6.44">Guardian decided to release a big old</text>
  <text start="1172.22" dur="7.47">report on Nikola Tesla and they</text>
  <text start="1175.81" dur="7.87">basically it was his biography now what</text>
  <text start="1179.69" dur="9.47">they didn&amp;#39;t do though is say a single</text>

  <text start="1189.16" dur="6.4">wireless transportation of electricity</text>

  <text start="1215.94" dur="3.4">download his information there&amp;#39;s nowhere</text>
  <text start="1217.81" dur="4.83">better way to put it then downloading</text>
  <text start="1219.34" dur="5.91">but not a word about any of that but</text>
  <text start="1222.64" dur="4.74">what they did was try to say oh you know</text>
  <text start="1225.25" dur="4.26">he&amp;#39;s little eccentric and weird because</text>
  <text start="1227.38" dur="5.16">he went a period without eating solid</text>

  <text start="1232.54" dur="6.14">in weird because he loved a pigeon and</text>
  <text start="1235.2" dur="6.1">what I mean it seems like they were</text>
  <text start="1238.68" dur="5.32">paying homage to him in the shittiest</text>
  <text start="1241.3" dur="5.7">way possible not saying a word about all</text>
