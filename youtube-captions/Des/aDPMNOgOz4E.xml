  <text start="11.969" dur="3.271">and I want to fill you in on basically</text>
  <text start="14.25" dur="4.71">just piece together a lot of things</text>
  <text start="15.24" dur="5.61">going on the white hat versus deep state</text>
  <text start="18.96" dur="3.27">fight that we&amp;#39;re quite literally seeing</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="2.429">you know a lot of things going on behind</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="3.629">the scenes that we have to piece</text>
  <text start="23.279" dur="4.111">together because of course corporate</text>
  <text start="25.859" dur="5.401">media will not do that for us</text>
  <text start="27.39" dur="5.13">so on this in the area of WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="2.79">right they&amp;#39;ve been releasing a lot of</text>
  <text start="32.52" dur="2.699">things about a week ago they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="3.33">released kind of a little thing called</text>
  <text start="35.219" dur="3.961">dark matter where it basically just said</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="4.14">hey all of your iPhones and Apple</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="4.68">products are screwed so hey looky here</text>
  <text start="41.52" dur="4.62">not really a big surprise but then a</text>
  <text start="43.86" dur="4.41">couple days ago just on Friday they</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="4.8">released what they called the marble and</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="6.53">marble was essentially their and their</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="8.549">third vault 7 release that encompassed I</text>
  <text start="54.8" dur="6.25">mean it was essentially a chess move</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="4.5">against the deep state with all their</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="6.27">Russia propaganda because Wikileak came</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="5.071">out and said the CIA literally has ass</text>
  <text start="67.32" dur="5.25">covering programs or anti forensic</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="5.22">programs and they will hide all the</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="4.02">traces of the hacks they do to foreign</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="3.449">governments with foreign codes so they</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="3.87">can literally look like a false flag</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="4.741">cyberattack that they&amp;#39;ll do so I mean</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="5.43">who are you gonna believe WikiLeaks that</text>
  <text start="82.47" dur="5.759">has never ever been proven wrong or CNN</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="3.839">which is wrong basically 100% of time</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="5.041">right it&amp;#39;s April through April Fool&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="7.441">Day every day with them so it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="5.309">a no-brainer there and I call it for</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="3.21">frame the Russians and blame the</text>
  <text start="98.579" dur="4.801">Russians that&amp;#39;s exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="4.47">doing and anybody with you know half a</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="4.44">brain can see through that propaganda</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="5.1">and just see the blatant bias when they</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="5.43">turn on anything CNN Washington Post New</text>
