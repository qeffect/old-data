  <text start="0.03" dur="3.899">hey there everybody welcome back to</text>
  <text start="1.65" dur="4.439">another interview of mine and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3.929" dur="4.231">extremely happy to be getting Dane</text>
  <text start="6.089" dur="4.651">Wigington on my channel for the very</text>
  <text start="8.16" dur="4.71">first time couldn&amp;#39;t do a video interview</text>
  <text start="10.74" dur="4.62">because he lives in a very remote area</text>
  <text start="12.87" dur="4.59">of California but I was able to get an</text>
  <text start="15.36" dur="5.249">audio interview with him and he just</text>
  <text start="17.46" dur="6.21">lays down the facts on geoengineering</text>
  <text start="20.609" dur="5.49">and solar radiation management you might</text>
  <text start="23.67" dur="4.619">have heard those concepts sometimes</text>
  <text start="26.099" dur="3.33">being termed as chemtrails but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="28.289" dur="3.38">actually more technically known as</text>
  <text start="29.429" dur="4.921">geoengineering and we talked about that</text>
  <text start="31.669" dur="5.861">specification in this interview he also</text>
  <text start="34.35" dur="6.08">lays down a lot of new research and new</text>
  <text start="37.53" dur="5.91">progress into exposing the</text>
  <text start="40.43" dur="4.539">geoengineering phenomena and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="43.44" dur="3.389">great interview great interview I think</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="3.93">you guys are really gonna like it Dane</text>
  <text start="46.829" dur="4.32">Wigington is just one of my favorite</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="4.771">speakers there is because of how clear</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="5.811">and concise he is and I think you guys</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="3.29">are really gonna enjoy this</text>
  <text start="61.83" dur="4.2">nein thank you so much for coming on</text>
  <text start="64.12" dur="4.56">here with me today how are you doing</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="3.67">good Jordan thank you for having me and</text>
  <text start="68.68" dur="3.35">your willingness to address this</text>
  <text start="69.7" dur="5.04">critical issue of climate adjourn</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="5.8">absolutely so getting into this topic</text>
  <text start="74.74" dur="4.59">for those of my listeners that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="77.83" dur="3.87">familiar with you and your work and your</text>
  <text start="79.33" dur="4.89">history in the geoengineering subject</text>
  <text start="81.7" dur="4.83">how did you get into it all and how did</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="4.1">you come to find the reality of these</text>
  <text start="86.53" dur="5.25">trails being laid above us</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="5.38">well it&amp;#39;s something in my background</text>
  <text start="91.78" dur="3.03">with Bechtel power that I would have</text>
  <text start="93.7" dur="3.39">thought would have been on my radar</text>
  <text start="94.81" dur="2.88">sooner but I moved to the Pacific</text>
  <text start="97.09" dur="2.67">Northwest</text>
  <text start="97.69" dur="4.74">to try to find clean air I grew up in a</text>
  <text start="99.76" dur="5.46">very sluggish Southern California built</text>
  <text start="102.43" dur="4.86">a large off-grid home solar hydro and</text>
  <text start="105.22" dur="6.24">wind power and I immediately began to</text>
  <text start="107.29" dur="7.02">notice very drastic drops in my solar PV</text>
  <text start="111.46" dur="5.909">uptake on days that had no natural cloud</text>
  <text start="114.31" dur="5.49">cover was the spreading expanding</text>
  <text start="117.369" dur="4.021">emissions from jet aircraft and this was</text>
  <text start="119.8" dur="3.87">certainly perplexing to loosen some days</text>
  <text start="121.39" dur="3.36">60 70 80 percent of my solar PV up cake</text>
  <text start="123.67" dur="3.059">from whatever these aircraft were</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="4.64">emitting I began to research Jordan</text>
  <text start="126.729" dur="4.711">found mountains of data on</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="4.06">geoengineering solar radiation</text>
  <text start="131.44" dur="3.69">management stratospheric aerosol</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="3.39">injection describing exactly what I was</text>
  <text start="135.13" dur="3.42">seeing in the skies above look for the</text>
  <text start="136.84" dur="2.73">primary elements listed in climate</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="3.42">engine and patents starting with</text>
  <text start="139.57" dur="4.77">aluminum found those elements and</text>
  <text start="141.97" dur="3.81">precipitation tests which are a very</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="5.15">good indicator of what is in the air</text>
  <text start="145.78" dur="5.91">column subsequent testing revealed</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="6.25">skyrocketing levels for those elements</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="6.15">and after enough research there was no</text>
  <text start="155.74" dur="4.32">denying the fact that climate</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="5.22">engineering was indeed occurring when</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="5.55">the skies above us and once one realizes</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="3.93">around the cases of this just couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="165.61" dur="2.79">turn away my life&amp;#39;s never been the same</text>
  <text start="166.99" dur="5.22">since this is all I&amp;#39;ve done for the last</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="6.83">15 years and then you began to research</text>
  <text start="172.21" dur="5.609">the ideas of geoengineering and solar</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="4.87">radiation management but a lot of people</text>
  <text start="177.819" dur="4.921">tend to term this as chemtrails that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.1" dur="4.29">the colloquial nomenclature of it can</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="3.3">you talk to me for a second the</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="4.26">important distinction between the two</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s extremely important and we have</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="4.53">example after example after example of</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="3.69">people who try to speak out on this</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="3.72">issue being instantly</text>
  <text start="194.8" dur="4.05">marginalized because they use the non</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="3.75">science chemtrails term there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="3.81">scientific basis for that term Jordan</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="4.59">some claim that there&amp;#39;s an Air Force</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="5.55">manual that proves that terms valid the</text>
  <text start="205.24" dur="5.04">manual in question that says the</text>
  <text start="208.21" dur="3.33">chemtrails turn on it has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="3.6">with climate engineering it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="4.71">first-year cadet chemistry course has</text>
  <text start="213.88" dur="3.9">nothing to do with this subject so again</text>
  <text start="216.25" dur="4.29">if you want credibility if you want to</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="3.89">help in this fight this critical fight</text>
  <text start="220.54" dur="4.02">to exposing all climate engineering</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="5.98">imperative to use the science terms</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="5.1">which lead people to science and solid</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="4.86">data and we can&amp;#39;t be marginalizing that</text>
  <text start="229.66" dur="7.79">way so again the media every single time</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="8.22">people like Kitty Jenner or we have a</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="5.17">prince who&amp;#39;s now no longer with us but</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="3.93">we have others that have used that term</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="3.24">and they were immediately marginalized</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="2.34">because of that term so this is</text>
  <text start="245.86" dur="4.08">semantics we&amp;#39;re playing a game of</text>
  <text start="247" dur="4.98">semantics semantics do matter we need to</text>
  <text start="249.94" dur="3.36">play chess effectively use the science</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="4.08">terms if you really want to help this</text>
  <text start="253.3" dur="4.71">bow gotcha and you mentioned the Air</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="4.29">Force manual that mentioned chemtrails</text>
  <text start="258.01" dur="5.82">quote that had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="260.35" dur="5.31">geoengineering topic what data and</text>
  <text start="263.83" dur="4.53">evidence have you found from actual</text>
  <text start="265.66" dur="5.4">government agencies that describe</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="6.99">geoengineering and how far back have you</text>
  <text start="271.06" dur="6.18">found data certainly the amount of</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="3.78">documents that we have and some of those</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="4.77">are in one case of Senate document</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="7.289">nearly 800 pages long indicates these</text>

  <text start="286.419" dur="3.841">World War two they&amp;#39;ve been going on that</text>
  <text start="288.79" dur="4.8">long and we have global temperature</text>
  <text start="290.26" dur="7.909">records that would indicate the initial</text>

  <text start="392.69" dur="4.17">because climate injuring climate</text>
  <text start="394.909" dur="4.5">engineering card was played 70 years ago</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="4.83">in regard to the data I&amp;#39;ll give you a</text>
  <text start="399.409" dur="3.961">little bit of breaking news on this</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="3.56">program and I&amp;#39;ll elaborate more on my</text>

  <text start="405.25" dur="5.5">we&amp;#39;re suing the US Department of</text>

  <text start="418.03" dur="3.91">7,000 documents the court has ordered</text>
  <text start="420.169" dur="4.53">Noah to give us seven thousand documents</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="4.44">that Noah now claims to have in fact the</text>

  <text start="426.38" dur="3.75">directly to know before we had to sue</text>

  <text start="430.13" dur="4.17">about any weather modification program</text>
  <text start="432.05" dur="4.56">anywhere ever obviously a blatant</text>
  <text start="434.3" dur="4.47">glaring lie now after we sue the DLC now</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="5.279">Noah says oh we have 7,000 documents we</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="4.53">found then they they&amp;#39;ve tried to drag</text>
  <text start="441.889" dur="6">their feet and releasing those documents</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="8.549">we were promised 1,400 per month</text>
  <text start="447.889" dur="5.791">starting April 6th we got nothing</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="3.841">April 13th we were totally we get</text>
  <text start="453.68" dur="4.38">documents again we&amp;#39;ve got nothing now</text>
  <text start="455.69" dur="4.41">out of the 1,400 the dealer</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="4.23">that they have assured they would</text>
  <text start="460.1" dur="5.93">release the beginning of April we were</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="7.26">just given seven documents seven seven</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="5.2">seven documents out of 1,400 which is</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="3.78">only a fraction of the 7,000 we were</text>
  <text start="471.23" dur="3.95">ordered to be given and those seven</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="5.16">documents are completely redacted</text>
  <text start="475.18" dur="3.82">nothing on them this is the world we</text>
  <text start="478.49" dur="2.52">live in</text>
  <text start="479" dur="6.06">the total cover-up and a government that</text>
  <text start="481.01" dur="5.43">is completely criminal so again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="3.359">it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re back to critical mass</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="4.68">awareness I&amp;#39;ll give this back to you but</text>
  <text start="488.419" dur="3.841">we are finding as far as we can do every</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="5.12">single channel to bring these programs</text>
  <text start="492.26" dur="8.19">to life but it takes people like you and</text>
  <text start="496.24" dur="5.98">others to help get this information out</text>
  <text start="500.45" dur="3.51">help encourage people to pick up the</text>
  <text start="502.22" dur="4.199">store to carry themselves share credible</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="6.99">data help us expose this issues we can</text>
  <text start="506.419" dur="6.12">expose it we have a chance to stop well</text>
  <text start="510.95" dur="3.269">so there&amp;#39;s some serious foot dragging</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="2.761">going on by the prowl structures as</text>
  <text start="514.219" dur="3.031">you&amp;#39;re saying and one thing I have</text>
  <text start="515.3" dur="3.6">noticed though recently is the idea of</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="5.219">geoengineering hitting the mainstream</text>
  <text start="518.9" dur="5.64">being talked about on I think I saw an</text>
  <text start="522.469" dur="4.231">article on the Guardian and others in</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="4.35">serious mainstream journals discuss this</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="4.86">issue yet you&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s been done</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="4.17">since World War two there&amp;#39;s thousands of</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="3.72">documents the government has they just</text>
  <text start="533.06" dur="4.35">won&amp;#39;t release so so why are we seeing</text>
  <text start="535.28" dur="4.74">the idea being talked about on the</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="6.54">mainstream level as if it&amp;#39;s only a</text>

  <text start="543.95" dur="3.78">pacifies the population even though they</text>
  <text start="545.9" dur="2.939">can see it with their own eyes and the</text>

  <text start="548.839" dur="6.391">couldn&amp;#39;t get much bigger it&amp;#39;s we live in</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="4.32">a planet now that looks like something</text>

  <text start="556.55" dur="4.05">known driving up by five yesterday it</text>
  <text start="559.28" dur="2.94">looked like another plane at the</text>

  <text start="570.41" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong they will not have</text>
  <text start="572.78" dur="4.29">that option for much longer and I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1451.87" dur="5.92">profound challenges that we face and</text>
  <text start="1455.33" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re valid those fighting against the</text>

  <text start="1460.55" dur="3">cell phone transmissions and so forth</text>
  <text start="1462.08" dur="5.52">those are all valid battles but I would</text>
  <text start="1463.55" dur="5.34">point out that those transmissions being</text>
  <text start="1467.6" dur="3.57">used for climate engineering are</text>
  <text start="1468.89" dur="4.2">exponentially more powerful and more</text>
  <text start="1471.17" dur="3.45">dangerous and we have the same</text>
  <text start="1473.09" dur="3.81">facilities being used for those</text>
  <text start="1474.62" dur="4.98">transmissions so what people mistakenly</text>
  <text start="1476.9" dur="5.76">believe the are only a cell phone</text>
  <text start="1479.6" dur="4.41">repeating tower if you will we know the</text>
  <text start="1482.66" dur="4.47">service entrance is the electrical</text>
  <text start="1484.01" dur="5.4">service supply for those towers is 10</text>
  <text start="1487.13" dur="3.87">times greater than they need for cell</text>
  <text start="1489.41" dur="4.59">phone repeating and we know those towers</text>
  <text start="1491" dur="5.22">are being used for the manipulation of</text>
  <text start="1494" dur="4.23">the particles in the atmosphere when you</text>
  <text start="1496.22" dur="3.42">Jordan you&amp;#39;ve seen on it if you put on</text>
  <text start="1498.23" dur="2.64">shavings on a table you put a magnet</text>
  <text start="1499.64" dur="3.69">below it you&amp;#39;ll see how they arranged</text>
  <text start="1500.87" dur="4.11">right based on the flux lines from the</text>
  <text start="1503.33" dur="3.48">magnet same thing happens with the</text>
  <text start="1504.98" dur="3.54">microwave radio frequency transmissions</text>
  <text start="1506.81" dur="3.75">and these are the herringbone patterns</text>
  <text start="1508.52" dur="4.23">rigged perfectly uniform grid patterns</text>
  <text start="1510.56" dur="3.78">people see in the sky it&amp;#39;s the way they</text>
  <text start="1512.75" dur="3.63">manipulate the particulate so they can</text>
  <text start="1514.34" dur="5.25">as they disperse these particulate stay</text>
  <text start="1516.38" dur="5.07">can further enhance their their ability</text>
  <text start="1519.59" dur="4.5">to scatter those particulate spikes</text>
  <text start="1521.45" dur="3.93">Lunger the radio frequency this is how</text>
  <text start="1524.09" dur="2.84">they can disband rain</text>
  <text start="1525.38" dur="5.63">for example coming over the west coast</text>
  <text start="1526.93" dur="5.74">we see heavy seating and the rain is</text>
  <text start="1531.01" dur="3.88">scattered because there&amp;#39;s too many</text>
  <text start="1532.67" dur="4.71">condensation nuclei too many particulate</text>
  <text start="1534.89" dur="3.87">there they&amp;#39;re scattered further with the</text>
  <text start="1537.38" dur="3.18">radio frequency transmissions and they</text>
  <text start="1538.76" dur="4.47">can migrate massive rainless cloud</text>
  <text start="1540.56" dur="4.8">covered further inland and that&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="1543.23" dur="4.62">of solar radiation management so Wow</text>
  <text start="1545.36" dur="5.07">here you explain the whole process I get</text>
  <text start="1547.85" dur="3.99">this visual visualization that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="1550.43" dur="3.99">how they&amp;#39;re doing it when they spray and</text>
  <text start="1551.84" dur="6.06">then they use the frequencies to push it</text>
  <text start="1554.42" dur="5.79">inward fascinating they&amp;#39;re correct and</text>
  <text start="1557.9" dur="4.44">so those those frequencies again</text>
  <text start="1560.21" dur="3.63">immensely harmful and when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1562.34" dur="3.51">fighting radio frequencies we must</text>
  <text start="1563.84" dur="4.74">consider climate engineering and I hope</text>

  <text start="1766.37" dur="3.299">to be a data repository so people can</text>
  <text start="1768.23" dur="4.38">have the ammunition they need to wake</text>
  <text start="1769.669" dur="4.201">those around them so we&amp;#39;ll continue to</text>
  <text start="1772.61" dur="3.179">do everything we can to sound the alarm</text>
  <text start="1773.87" dur="4.049">to provide the best most effective</text>
  <text start="1775.789" dur="3.721">materials people can use to circulate</text>
  <text start="1777.919" dur="3.301">and help wake those up around them and</text>
  <text start="1779.51" dur="3.24">if we all participated in this Jordan</text>
  <text start="1781.22" dur="3.87">you know the mathematical equation if</text>
  <text start="1782.75" dur="4.26">you if you woke two people up at the</text>
  <text start="1785.09" dur="3.329">beginning of a 30 day month and those</text>
  <text start="1787.01" dur="3.51">two two weeks the second day and so</text>
  <text start="1788.419" dur="3.72">forth you&amp;#39;re into the many millions by</text>
  <text start="1790.52" dur="2.33">the end of only thirty days if we all</text>
  <text start="1792.139" dur="4.231">pull</text>
  <text start="1792.85" dur="5.23">we could still affect the flavor of what</text>
  <text start="1796.37" dur="4.11">we face we&amp;#39;re in for immense challenges</text>
  <text start="1798.08" dur="4.95">under any scenario but again there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1800.48" dur="3.69">single the single greatest leap we could</text>
  <text start="1803.03" dur="3.33">take in the right direction</text>
  <text start="1804.17" dur="3.87">would be to expose and halt climate</text>
  <text start="1806.36" dur="3.15">engineering and that would drag so much</text>
  <text start="1808.04" dur="5.72">to the surface with it when people</text>
  <text start="1809.51" dur="7.77">realize that they&amp;#39;ve been forced to be a</text>
  <text start="1813.76" dur="5.53">test subject in an experiment from which</text>
  <text start="1817.28" dur="4.68">there is no return and we need people to</text>
  <text start="1819.29" dur="4.85">understand that we the challenge we face</text>
  <text start="1821.96" dur="5.04">with climate engineering is existential</text>
  <text start="1824.14" dur="5.26">it&amp;#39;s our collective futures that are at</text>
  <text start="1827" dur="4.59">stake your joy it may seem completely</text>
  <text start="1829.4" dur="4.2">overwhelming and completely scary but</text>
  <text start="1831.59" dur="4.14">one thing I like to do is visualize that</text>
  <text start="1833.6" dur="4.98">world that we get once all of this stuff</text>
  <text start="1835.73" dur="4.829">is cleaned up and we actually get these</text>
  <text start="1838.58" dur="6.06">programs exposed and get rid of them</text>
  <text start="1840.559" dur="7.441">I agree our intent is very important and</text>
  <text start="1844.64" dur="4.83">people should never underestimate their</text>
  <text start="1848" dur="2.88">ability to affect the equation if they</text>
  <text start="1849.47" dur="2.67">simply start marching in the right</text>
  <text start="1850.88" dur="2.79">direction the journey of a thousand</text>
  <text start="1852.14" dur="2.52">miles begins with a single step correct</text>
  <text start="1853.67" dur="3.06">- correct</text>
  <text start="1854.66" dur="3.63">so we start moving that direction and I</text>
  <text start="1856.73" dur="3.63">would argue to put one foot on that path</text>
  <text start="1858.29" dur="5.1">and still have arrived the journey is</text>
  <text start="1860.36" dur="4.41">the destination so again if we know</text>
  <text start="1863.39" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re waking people up behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1864.77" dur="4.62">and this is what I just described to add</text>
  <text start="1867.86" dur="3.33">a little credence to that I just had a</text>
  <text start="1869.39" dur="3.12">long conversation with a former member</text>
  <text start="1871.19" dur="4.92">of the Senate Armed Services Committee</text>
  <text start="1872.51" dur="7.049">member or committee in DC I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1876.11" dur="5.61">communicating now with three former US</text>
  <text start="1879.559" dur="4.381">military generals we are waking people</text>
  <text start="1881.72" dur="4.02">up but this is back to the the effort</text>
  <text start="1883.94" dur="3.33">from each and every one of us to spread</text>
  <text start="1885.74" dur="4.23">awareness wherever we&amp;#39;re at hold</text>
  <text start="1887.27" dur="4.23">viewings we have very extensive</text>
  <text start="1889.97" dur="3.24">presentations on the home page of</text>
  <text start="1891.5" dur="3.36">cheering watch that anybody can use I</text>
  <text start="1893.21" dur="3.99">Skype into events often to answer</text>
  <text start="1894.86" dur="4.38">questions all of us need to pull</text>
  <text start="1897.2" dur="5.91">together and share that credible data if</text>
  <text start="1899.24" dur="6">we do so we are getting much much closer</text>
  <text start="1903.11" dur="4.47">to critical mass the effort again will</text>
  <text start="1905.24" dur="3.689">take all of us Jordan thank you so much</text>
