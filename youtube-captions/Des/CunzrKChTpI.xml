  <text start="2.37" dur="4.139">Sunday morning July 23rd here and I want</text>
  <text start="5.22" dur="3.089">to film this update to tell you a little</text>
  <text start="6.509" dur="4.351">bit about my experiences over the last</text>
  <text start="8.309" dur="5.011">24 hours now if you&amp;#39;ve been following me</text>
  <text start="10.86" dur="4.08">on social media mainly Facebook and</text>
  <text start="13.32" dur="3.09">YouTube where the typical ones I stick</text>
  <text start="14.94" dur="3.87">to a little bit of Instagram thrown in</text>
  <text start="16.41" dur="5.039">there then you know I&amp;#39;m in Las Vegas for</text>
  <text start="18.81" dur="4.709">the MUFON symposium and at this</text>
  <text start="21.449" dur="5.371">symposium we have a range of different</text>
  <text start="23.519" dur="4.891">authors and scientists and even insiders</text>
  <text start="26.82" dur="3.629">themselves bringing forth their</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="4.559">information and even their direct</text>
  <text start="30.449" dur="6.031">experiences with the secret space</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="7.171">program and the secret space program is</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="6.96">just in fact that it&amp;#39;s secret covert</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="5.82">projects that are normally found in</text>
  <text start="43.44" dur="4.26">different corporations and military</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="3.689">organizations that have all been kept</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="5.129">secret they&amp;#39;ve been kept out of the</text>
  <text start="49.649" dur="5.761">public eye for even up to 70 years now</text>
  <text start="52.829" dur="4.89">and it was absolutely mind-blowing to</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="4.77">hear some of the direct testimony from</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="4.201">these individuals at this conference and</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.47">just yesterday I sat through two</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="4.83">different lectures one was dr. Robert</text>
  <text start="64.65" dur="2.88">wood and another one was William</text>
  <text start="66.75" dur="4.49">Thompkins</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="6.6">now dr. Robert Wood is a Cornell</text>
  <text start="71.24" dur="4.78">graduate he graduated with a PhD in</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="4.98">physics and he went on to work at</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="5.58">Douglas aerospace company for 43 years</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="4.53">on a variety of different classified</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="3.92">projects he was telling us about some of</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="4.589">the projects he worked on including the</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="5.68">radar systems ballistic missile defense</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="6.121">systems even International Space Station</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="6.87">projects so he&amp;#39;s a brilliant man and he</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="8.18">was then discussing his knowledge on the</text>
  <text start="98.07" dur="7.729">UFO subject now if we have a PhD</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="6.129">scientists scientists of physics</text>
  <text start="105.799" dur="5.35">discussing the UFO phenomenon with us</text>
  <text start="108.659" dur="4.291">it&amp;#39;s I mean you can&amp;#39;t really ridicule</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="5.341">this guy it&amp;#39;s not a subject that you can</text>
  <text start="112.95" dur="6.15">keep suppressed and he was discussing in</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="4.739">fact the ways that are kept secret many</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="4.589">different ways from people literally</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="7.021">being blackmailed people literally</text>
  <text start="123.689" dur="6.901">receiving death threats and a whole host</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.91">of different ways from psychological</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="5.27">warfare and the media to</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="6.54">secret courts that whistleblowers can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="5.01">testify in public with to all kinds of</text>
  <text start="139.7" dur="5.22">different reasons right</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="6.72">I mean it&amp;#39;s when you entertain the ideas</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="5.16">of compartmentalization and how many</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="6.3">different people even in one corporation</text>
  <text start="150.08" dur="5.64">itself they could have zero idea of the</text>
  <text start="153.89" dur="3.54">names in the person even in the next</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="3.69">room let alone what they&amp;#39;re working on</text>
  <text start="157.43" dur="4.59">so there&amp;#39;s many different ways that</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="5.88">these space programs are kept secret and</text>
  <text start="162.02" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve kept lots of stuff secret and</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="5.07">then I listened to the testimony of</text>
  <text start="168.05" dur="3.93">William Tompkins which was extremely</text>
  <text start="170.36" dur="4.41">interesting because William Tompkins</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="5.4">worked at Douglas aerospace for a about</text>
  <text start="174.77" dur="5.34">twelve years at the very same time that</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="4.68">dr. wood did and they knew the exact</text>
  <text start="180.11" dur="3.9">same individuals and they had zero idea</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="4.32">of each other until just a couple years</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="4.77">ago and William Tompkins testimony is</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="4.56">absolutely riveting I was sitting front</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="4.29">and center looking directly at him and</text>
  <text start="190.94" dur="5.4">his testimony is just it&amp;#39;s mind-blowing</text>
  <text start="193.07" dur="8.52">because he was the man that was directly</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="7.11">tasked with debriefing naval spies that</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="3.99">were embedded in Germany during World</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="3.539">War two and these naval spies were</text>
  <text start="205.58" dur="3.93">embedded in different German</text>
  <text start="206.989" dur="5.851">corporations and around all of the</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="5.37">access conscious powers control</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="3.96">territory in Europe in different</text>
  <text start="214.88" dur="4.62">corporations military organizations and</text>
  <text start="216.8" dur="4.71">secret think tanks bringing back the</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="3.84">secret science the secret technologies</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="3.54">many having to do with anti-gravity and</text>
  <text start="223.34" dur="4.41">free energy technologies they were</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="5.159">bringing it back from Germany into the</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="4.709">Navy and it was William Tompkins job</text>
  <text start="230.209" dur="4.231">himself to disseminate this information</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="3.961">to different think tanks aerospace</text>
  <text start="234.44" dur="6.78">corporations and laboratories around</text>
  <text start="236.42" dur="8.34">America but of course the due to</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="4.68">different dark factions we could say</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="2.24">embedded in the military-industrial</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="3.18">complex</text>
  <text start="247" dur="5.23">infiltrated into the military-industrial</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="5.93">complex this information has been kept</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="7.77">secret ever since World War two but</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="7.24">William Tompkins is almost being coming</text>
  <text start="260" dur="4.11">forward as a sanctioned insider to</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="4.2">discuss this information because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="2.66">time it&amp;#39;s time for all of this to come</text>
  <text start="266.45" dur="2.149">out</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s time for all of this to reach a</text>
  <text start="268.599" dur="4.591">much larger audience than just 500</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="6.15">people sitting in the conference center</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="6.93">in a Las Vegas hotel so to do this I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="277.99" dur="4.2">been a part of some meetings in past</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="7.5">couple days and I&amp;#39;m gonna do some more</text>
  <text start="282.19" dur="9">work here today to bring out a lot of</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="4.799">different almost re educational material</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="3.33">because that&amp;#39;s exactly what we have to</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="4.741">do when William Tompkins was on stage</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="6.72">there I mean bless his 94 year old heart</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="7.939">he was describing how literally every</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="7.579">textbook we&amp;#39;ve ever bought in</text>
  <text start="305.099" dur="6.581">universities have all been manipulated</text>
  <text start="308.819" dur="6.551">specifically to control our minds and he</text>
  <text start="311.68" dur="6.079">was I quote him as saying every officer</text>
  <text start="315.37" dur="4.65">that has gone through military training</text>
  <text start="317.759" dur="3.611">especially in Annapolis he was you know</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s in the Navy he was specifically</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="3.329">talking about the Navy but every officer</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s gone through military training</text>
  <text start="324.699" dur="5.791">they&amp;#39;ve had their minds manipulated with</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="5.789">false information so everybody has</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s a massive relearning curve that</text>
  <text start="333.039" dur="4.38">we all needs to do and even myself I</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="6.389">mean I think of myself as being pretty</text>

  <text start="347.44" dur="3.87">new things every single day so I can</text>
  <text start="349.389" dur="4.83">only imagine the learning curve that</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="4.56">people need to do that are still that</text>
  <text start="354.219" dur="3.211">still have their minds ingrained in the</text>
  <text start="355.87" dur="4.41">conventional system in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="7.139">system their learning curve is massive</text>
