  <text start="1520.91" dur="6.21">most def and ok moving on now to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1525.62" dur="3.93">happening there in California with</text>
  <text start="1527.12" dur="5.16">Senate bill 276 that was the Senate bill</text>
  <text start="1529.55" dur="5.52">whereby it&amp;#39;s basically making it</text>
  <text start="1532.28" dur="4.44">impossible for parents to get childhood</text>
  <text start="1535.07" dur="4.5">exemptions from vaccines for their</text>
  <text start="1536.72" dur="5.64">children there in California on 9/11 a</text>
  <text start="1539.57" dur="6.6">vigil was held there in Sacramento it</text>
  <text start="1542.36" dur="6.36">was not a 9/11 visual vigil this vigil</text>
  <text start="1546.17" dur="5.25">was for children that died after being</text>
  <text start="1548.72" dur="5.55">vaccinated as you can see there a lot of</text>
  <text start="1551.42" dur="4.92">photographs of children who were either</text>
  <text start="1554.27" dur="6.06">injured or died after being vaccinated</text>
  <text start="1556.34" dur="5.36">and note all the photos you see here all</text>
  <text start="1560.33" dur="4.08">the photos you see in these photographs</text>
  <text start="1561.7" dur="5.5">is just a small percentage of the total</text>
  <text start="1564.41" dur="5.84">very small percentage of the total</text>
  <text start="1567.2" dur="6.81">because of course if you want to sue</text>
  <text start="1570.25" dur="5.62">vaccine manufacturers for being vaccine</text>
  <text start="1574.01" dur="4.29">injured you have to go through a total</text>
  <text start="1575.87" dur="4.92">separate court system completely</text>
  <text start="1578.3" dur="4.8">separate court and it&amp;#39;s very very tough</text>
  <text start="1580.79" dur="6.72">to get anything awarded or get your case</text>
  <text start="1583.1" dur="6.09">through that court ok so really what we</text>
  <text start="1587.51" dur="3.27">learn about the dangers and harms of</text>
  <text start="1589.19" dur="3.36">vaccines is just a fraction of what</text>
  <text start="1590.78" dur="3.9">actually goes on out there most of us</text>
  <text start="1592.55" dur="4.62">just all brushed under the rug so the</text>
  <text start="1594.68" dur="4.53">public doesn&amp;#39;t learn about it and shout</text>

  <text start="2133.8" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s just from ancient times right I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2137.22" dur="2.91">talking about things a long time ago we</text>
  <text start="2138.69" dur="3.36">even have modern</text>
  <text start="2140.13" dur="4.2">sightings in the sky of UFOs we have</text>
  <text start="2142.05" dur="5">modern insiders and whistleblowers that</text>
  <text start="2144.33" dur="7.86">have come forward with their knowledge</text>
  <text start="2147.05" dur="6.88">so I can keep going but total nonsense</text>
  <text start="2152.19" dur="4.08">from the mainstream media when it comes</text>
  <text start="2153.93" dur="4.65">to extraterrestrial information or UFOs</text>

  <text start="2173.1" dur="5.07">Forbes this article just goes on to say</text>
  <text start="2175.56" dur="4.92">that Venus is gonna start rising on the</text>

  <text start="2190.62" dur="5.16">narcissist total psychological</text>
  <text start="2192.3" dur="5.94">manipulation and also false headlines</text>
  <text start="2195.78" dur="5.22">just completely false statements a lot</text>
  <text start="2198.24" dur="6.48">of the UFO sightings that many of us see</text>
  <text start="2201" dur="5.46">around yes are exotic US government</text>
  <text start="2204.72" dur="4.59">craft it&amp;#39;s actually been that way since</text>
  <text start="2206.46" dur="5.7">probably the 50s believe it or not that</text>
  <text start="2209.31" dur="5.67">long 1950s a lot of those sightings in</text>
  <text start="2212.16" dur="4.89">the 50s and 60s when we got a whole rash</text>
  <text start="2214.98" dur="5.64">of UFO sightings around America here in</text>
  <text start="2217.05" dur="6.57">my opinion not saying all but many of</text>
  <text start="2220.62" dur="6.87">those were probably US government craft</text>
  <text start="2223.62" dur="7.2">and probably Nazi secret society craft</text>
  <text start="2227.49" dur="5.67">as well so they figured out the gravity</text>
  <text start="2230.82" dur="4.74">equation in the black projects long ago</text>
  <text start="2233.16" dur="4.05">and there&amp;#39;s some pretty incredible and</text>
  <text start="2235.56" dur="3.51">credible government technology that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2237.21" dur="4.83">hidden from us not really government</text>
  <text start="2239.07" dur="5.37">though it&amp;#39;s more corporate and it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="2242.04" dur="4.71">you can&amp;#39;t even label it corporate or</text>
  <text start="2244.44" dur="4.05">government because it&amp;#39;s more like quasi</text>
  <text start="2246.75" dur="3.89">corporate government it&amp;#39;s these secret</text>
  <text start="2248.49" dur="4.5">groups that keep their unacknowledged</text>
  <text start="2250.64" dur="4.93">special access projects to themselves</text>
  <text start="2252.99" dur="4.02">right so you can have maybe a few</text>
  <text start="2255.57" dur="3.39">military guys and on it maybe a few</text>
  <text start="2257.01" dur="5.06">corporate guys in on it and then they</text>
  <text start="2258.96" dur="6.03">delegate and compartmentalize out the</text>
  <text start="2262.07" dur="7.54">the development and research outside of</text>
  <text start="2264.99" dur="6.27">them so long conversation but yes many</text>
  <text start="2269.61" dur="3.42">of these sightings totally corporate of</text>
  <text start="2271.26" dur="2.73">government you know what&amp;#39;s Lockheed</text>
  <text start="2273.03" dur="2.64">really got</text>

  <text start="2286.29" dur="3.84">underground facilities and that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="2287.94" dur="6.08">want to know next story</text>
  <text start="2290.13" dur="6.78">NASA saying a new comet is likely an</text>

  <text start="2325.52" dur="5.89">again it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s a story as I think</text>
  <text start="2330.06" dur="4.11">a lot of these are in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="2331.41" dur="5.58">media lately just to keep the idea of</text>
  <text start="2334.17" dur="5.13">you know interstellar visitors or UFOs</text>
  <text start="2336.99" dur="4.23">or this stuff in our consciousness so</text>
  <text start="2339.3" dur="6.42">they can psychologically mess with us</text>
  <text start="2341.22" dur="5.399">with so with this yeah we&amp;#39;ll see you</text>
  <text start="2345.72" dur="3.72">know they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="2346.619" dur="6.271">interstellar visitor will go through our</text>

  <text start="2356.52" dur="4.62">October actually looks to be fairly soon</text>
  <text start="2359.13" dur="3.75">so they&amp;#39;ll just keep running stories</text>
  <text start="2361.14" dur="3.6">about this you know that&amp;#39;s what you can</text>
  <text start="2362.88" dur="3.21">expect but keep running stories and</text>
  <text start="2364.74" dur="4.02">maybe we&amp;#39;ll figure out some things about</text>
  <text start="2366.09" dur="4.32">it it&amp;#39;ll be a card that the deep state</text>
  <text start="2368.76" dur="4.05">has in their back pocket that they can</text>
  <text start="2370.41" dur="3.78">run some you know distracting narratives</text>
  <text start="2372.81" dur="4.29">in the mainstream media if they ever</text>
  <text start="2374.19" dur="5.07">need to so just another one of those to</text>
  <text start="2377.1" dur="6.45">be mindful of and then the Washington</text>

  <text start="2388.2" dur="6.93">just another another easy thread that</text>
  <text start="2392.04" dur="5.27">they can use to put some weird stories</text>
  <text start="2395.13" dur="4.89">out with and just ridicule the idea</text>
  <text start="2397.31" dur="5.08">right here you see there was actually</text>
  <text start="2400.02" dur="5.13">two Dutch vloggers they were like young</text>

  <text start="2437.16" dur="6.6">this area 51 thing has ever been about</text>
  <text start="2440.67" dur="4.53">it was just a convenient story that they</text>
