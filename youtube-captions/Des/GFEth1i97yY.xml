  <text start="109.71" dur="4.439">many hours working on above majestic</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="4.199">really throughout like I said over a</text>
  <text start="114.149" dur="5.311">year you know we were doing interviews</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="5.161">last summer 2017 that we didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="4.019">know where they would end up we had no</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="4.349">idea we just knew that we had to start</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="5.161">getting interviews and little did we</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="5.041">know year in almost a year and a half</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="5.31">later then when we began these</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="6.21">interviews would become a part of this</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="4.649">and not only that but going to all the</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="5.969">conferences that&amp;#39;s where many of the</text>
  <text start="138.599" dur="6.541">interviews we&amp;#39;re done was just like back</text>
  <text start="143.129" dur="4.201">hotel rooms at conferences trying to</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="4.29">snag people at these and bring them back</text>
  <text start="147.33" dur="3.93">and sit him down to talk on camera and</text>
  <text start="149.43" dur="4.2">give their testimony that&amp;#39;s where a lot</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="3.99">of this happened it was a grind going to</text>
  <text start="153.63" dur="2.91">these events and like literally chasing</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="3.81">people down like I would be waiting</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="4.29">there for hours to get like David Adair</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="3.81">for instance and a few other people who</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="4.95">were trying to coordinate all that and</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="5.369">not only that but taking uh taking a</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="6.78">road trip down the west coast basically</text>
  <text start="168.239" dur="5.821">did this earlier this year and got a few</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="3.66">interviews along the way a couple of</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="4.44">those interviews ended up in the movie</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="4.29">and being able to basically make a</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="4.41">lifelong friend along the way JJ who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="3.809">the filmmaker we worked with for many of</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="4.59">the shots all the really high quality</text>
  <text start="184.319" dur="5.941">shots that you saw was him in his Canon</text>
  <text start="187.5" dur="6.15">cameras and it was fantastic to make not</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="5.28">only a fantastic friend in JJ go on the</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="4.619">road trip with him get the documentaries</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="6">go some other places but also somebody</text>
  <text start="198.269" dur="5.461">who I&amp;#39;m going to begin creating with in</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="3.539">the future some of the videos that you</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="3.33">see up on this channel some of them are</text>
  <text start="205.079" dur="6.75">edited by his I&amp;#39;m going to drop another</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="6.149">one later tonight edited by him and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.829" dur="5.461">teaching me he&amp;#39;s teaching me a whole lot</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="8.25">about filmmaking being able to learn</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="6.09">this art learn this creative expression</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="5.191">because I do little videos on this</text>
  <text start="223.38" dur="5.759">channel but it&amp;#39;s just basic like editing</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="4.08">techniques and things like that I</text>
  <text start="229.139" dur="4.111">actually want to learn a lot more a lot</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="5.819">more in depth of not only documented</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="5.22">creation but other types of of</text>
  <text start="236.549" dur="3.571">filmmaking and he&amp;#39;s teaching me a lot so</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s cool and I&amp;#39;m learning a lot from</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="3.869">elsewhere Internet&amp;#39;s a great resource</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="5.49">learn a bunch on YouTube you definitely</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="5.31">can so that was great the rush that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="3.9">seeing it all go live and we really had</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="3.84">no expectations with this like I said</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="4.619">when we first began getting interviews</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="4.71">it was like don&amp;#39;t know don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="256.049" dur="3.99">this is gonna end up it&amp;#39;s just we felt</text>
  <text start="257.849" dur="4.5">like and that&amp;#39;s kind of the way the</text>
  <text start="260.039" dur="4.321">universe works it just conspires for you</text>
  <text start="262.349" dur="4.141">when you have the focus and the will and</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="3.21">the determination to make these things</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="2.4">happen so</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="3.18">we just started doing we were just doing</text>
  <text start="268.89" dur="3.78">it and we didn&amp;#39;t know where this doing</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="4.62">was gonna end up but this is how it</text>
  <text start="272.67" dur="6.29">ended up super cool to see so what are</text>
  <text start="275.37" dur="6.03">my thoughts on the movie quite frankly I</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="4.27">saw the final cut of the movie actually</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="3.06">after it was released many of you guys</text>
  <text start="283.23" dur="4.02">out there probably saw it before I even</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="6.66">did you know I saw the edited one which</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="7.65">was back in June first edit saw the</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="6.93">second edit in August and since August</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s been super duper reworked in I mean</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="2.91">it&amp;#39;s basically a whole different movie</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="4.11">so it&amp;#39;s been worked on for a long time</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="5.64">and what did I think of this final cut</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="5.9">well the good pieces in my mind again it</text>
  <text start="306.6" dur="6.39">was just my thoughts from just seeing it</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="7">animation the animation was pretty sweet</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="4.92">how they had the saucer craft in the</text>
  <text start="316.38" dur="4.28">interest to eat sequence and then</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="5.79">throughout showing the cigar-shaped UFOs</text>
  <text start="320.66" dur="7.39">you know the different types of craft</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="7.71">even the animation of what they were</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="5.01">depicting as Nazi saucers and old Nazi</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="3.75">craft from the German secret space</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="4.86">programs that was super cool good</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="5.49">production value there and I really</text>
  <text start="337.92" dur="7.05">liked how the narrative was able to be</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="6.03">tight in the way it was because again we</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="3.78">were so sporadic with our shooting we</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="4.65">had like I mean truly we did this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="6.51">amateurs the amateurs the way we were</text>
  <text start="351.33" dur="7.31">doing this just super ghetto grassroots</text>
  <text start="355.26" dur="5.67">and throwing this all together just</text>
  <text start="358.64" dur="5.92">getting in the due mode not focusing</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="5.04">about all the extraneous stuff all those</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="3.17">little thoughts enter your head we were</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="4.2">just like asking random questions</text>
  <text start="367.73" dur="6.21">getting the testimony that we could out</text>
  <text start="370.17" dur="9.18">of people and we didn&amp;#39;t originally have</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="7.3">the structure that ended up in the final</text>
  <text start="379.35" dur="3.09">cut it wasn&amp;#39;t like that at all so it was</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="3.45">really cool to see how all the</text>
  <text start="382.44" dur="4.05">narratives tied in it began with this</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="3.69">particular topic and went into this and</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="3.6">this and this so it was cool to see that</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="3.45">you know the next productions that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.09" dur="3.54">gonna focus on you&amp;#39;ll learn as you go</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="5.73">and I&amp;#39;m learning a whole lot and the</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="6.84">next big documentary movies that we work</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="3.91">on are going to be just beautiful and</text>
  <text start="400.47" dur="4.18">way better</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="6.89">and production value was good</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="8.64">JJ&amp;#39;s cameras good-looking shots the</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="8.92">distribution of it I was really happy</text>
  <text start="413.29" dur="8.13">with because there were some very heavy</text>
  <text start="417.28" dur="7.05">topics left in that movie the word that</text>
  <text start="421.42" dur="4.83">starts with an A adrenochrome like that</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5.88">was left in there and the missing money</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="6.18">and talking about the not just the deep</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="4.95">state influence but the cult aspect of</text>
  <text start="432.43" dur="6.83">their D of their influence and the human</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="8.49">trafficking and all that that was really</text>
  <text start="439.26" dur="8.02">made me impressed that they left that in</text>
  <text start="443.65" dur="7.05">there and the companies we&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="6.33">with like folks that are in LA they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.7" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s like amazing to see people who are</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="4.92">in the business but not about the</text>
  <text start="455.95" dur="5.219">business you know they deal with this</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="3.9">you could say 3d reality why we still</text>
  <text start="461.169" dur="3.031">have to deal with it but they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="4.14">very aware folks they want to get the</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="3.81">truth out there and again guys it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="3">a black-and-white world like just</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="3.45">because you see a company&amp;#39;s based in LA</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="3.599">in LA or somebody lives in LA or</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="3.6">something like that you know or this</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="3.541">company put out this documentary or</text>
  <text start="475.06" dur="3.3">whatever the case is like it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="3.18">black-and-white world there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="3.119">there&amp;#39;s good people out there you just</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="4.74">have to have that sort of faith that</text>
  <text start="481.479" dur="5.461">there&amp;#39;s good in people&amp;#39;s hearts and if</text>
  <text start="484.63" dur="4.62">you really have the focus in the will</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="4.95">and don&amp;#39;t get caught up with all that</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="4.62">negative BS you will have opportunities</text>
  <text start="491.89" dur="6">open up for you and then things like</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="5.43">this can happen for you now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="497.89" dur="4.41">about some of the bad things so what</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="5.96">constructive criticisms do I have about</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="5.61">the movie myself well me haha my shots</text>
  <text start="505.26" dur="4.3">we did the shooting at least for myself</text>
  <text start="507.91" dur="4.499">but like 2:00 in the morning that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="4.74">I just look like I look like I had these</text>
  <text start="512.409" dur="3.451">bags under my eyes and my brain I could</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="3.27">hardly focus so it was tough getting</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="3.42">those it was very forced and I never</text>
  <text start="517.57" dur="2.61">shot a documentary before totally</text>
  <text start="519.28" dur="4.08">different than new and stuff like this</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="4.5">so kind of awkward but I got the</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="5.03">information out I needed to still</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="5.73">grateful just to end up in the movie but</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="4.99">again next things we&amp;#39;re gonna be working</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="4.83">on far better and the fact that my</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="6.51">particular piece</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="7.849">was shot a while ago that could have</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="5.699">been redone but again it was just like</text>
  <text start="543.089" dur="3.701">things were so busy these days for so</text>
  <text start="545.589" dur="3.06">many people and there&amp;#39;s so many moving</text>
  <text start="546.79" dur="5.85">parts to all this stuff and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.649" dur="5.871">difficult but at least I thought what</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="4.83">could have been better is particularly</text>
  <text start="554.52" dur="4.96">the Q part at the end there were some</text>
  <text start="557.47" dur="3.51">things I noticed that I even said that</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="4.82">was wrong and some things that could&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="6.63">been framed and phrased a lot better</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="5.2">like I said the shot we did for me was</text>
  <text start="567.61" dur="4.59">bleep AK and like March or April and I</text>
  <text start="569.5" dur="5.82">didn&amp;#39;t understand quite as much about Q</text>
  <text start="572.2" dur="5.28">then as I did now I think I mentioned</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="3.87">something about the indictments that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="577.48" dur="4.44">like man oh that was a little wrong but</text>
  <text start="579.19" dur="7.98">I said there and a few other things but</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="8.1">it was still great to see Q and mo and</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="4.47">Rick Trump reality in a documentary you</text>
  <text start="590.02" dur="4.05">know not something that frames Trump is</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="5.58">fake news or something like that but a</text>
  <text start="594.07" dur="5.579">level-headed logical documentary sweet</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="5.609">to see that you know basically this is I</text>
  <text start="599.649" dur="4.831">guess the first time q and on has really</text>
  <text start="602.829" dur="4.921">been mentioned on anything that ended up</text>
  <text start="604.48" dur="6.15">on like iTunes or Amazon right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.75" dur="4.86">pretty sweet but anyway there&amp;#39;s that and</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="5.28">then it was only interviews that was one</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="4.65">thing that I noticed that again it would</text>

  <text start="924.46" dur="4.77">evidence it&amp;#39;s because their brain is</text>
  <text start="928.24" dur="3.12">just too close-minded</text>

  <text start="949.42" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re even looking for a person there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="950.74" dur="3.6">evidence all over the place and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="953.02" dur="4.77">different kinds of evidence this is</text>
  <text start="954.34" dur="7.56">important because there&amp;#39;s testimonial</text>
  <text start="957.79" dur="4.32">evidence that is legitimate in a court</text>
  <text start="961.9" dur="2.94">of law</text>

  <text start="969.31" dur="2.66">it is</text>
  <text start="969.79" dur="5.16">and then there&amp;#39;s corroboree</text>
  <text start="971.97" dur="6.25">corroboration evidence corroborate ori i</text>
  <text start="974.95" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t know where it goes this dot lines</text>

  <text start="984.16" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s holistic thinking in action when</text>
  <text start="986.77" dur="3.12">you&amp;#39;re corroborating things you know</text>
  <text start="988.51" dur="2.43">that makes sense that person said that</text>
  <text start="989.89" dur="3.18">that person said that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="990.94" dur="3.87">connected this this person saying these</text>

  <text start="1009.6" dur="3.3">divided they don&amp;#39;t like this group to</text>
  <text start="1011.25" dur="3">intermingle with this group in communica</text>
  <text start="1012.9" dur="3.48">with this group because then start</text>
  <text start="1014.25" dur="4.32">figuring things out right then people</text>
  <text start="1016.38" dur="7.41">start thinking holistically seeing the</text>
  <text start="1018.57" dur="7.619">big picture so corroborate ori evidence</text>
  <text start="1023.79" dur="3.75">that one&amp;#39;s important that&amp;#39;s when i see</text>
  <text start="1026.189" dur="2.731">how people often overlook then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1027.54" dur="3.39">photographic evidence and digital</text>
  <text start="1028.92" dur="6.48">evidence and all kinds of other content</text>

  <text start="1043.17" dur="5.25">particular evidence in cetera etcetera</text>
  <text start="1044.88" dur="7.59">and and i can go on and on about a lot</text>
  <text start="1048.42" dur="6.06">of just the word twist the misinforming</text>
  <text start="1052.47" dur="3.45">i&amp;#39;m seeing out there about so many</text>
