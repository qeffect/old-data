  <text start="553.12" dur="5.13">literally break us into war this</text>
  <text start="555.569" dur="5.26">Rasmussen poll that came out earlier in</text>

  <text start="596.949" dur="3.811">many other polls that we see in the</text>
  <text start="598.839" dur="4.651">mainstream out there so I highly doubt</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="6.3">that that many people think a civil war</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="4.98">is likely soon highly doubt it even</text>
