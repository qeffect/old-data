  <text start="29.189" dur="6.631">the Space Command this week and that is</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="4.14">different than the space force they were</text>
  <text start="35.82" dur="3.69">pushing for let&amp;#39;s discuss this so the</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="3.51">Space Command is going to be a combatant</text>
  <text start="39.51" dur="3.93">command and it&amp;#39;s going to be the 11th</text>
  <text start="41.43" dur="3.6">one it&amp;#39;s going to be created now because</text>
  <text start="43.44" dur="3.56">it&amp;#39;s a combatant command</text>
  <text start="45.03" dur="4.619">it doesn&amp;#39;t need congressional approval</text>
  <text start="47" dur="4.719">you see with the space force that was</text>
  <text start="49.649" dur="4.64">what was stifling that from moving</text>
  <text start="51.719" dur="5.311">forward is because the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="54.289" dur="4.391">getting control of the house and there</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="4.619">was a lot of bureaucratic nonsense</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="5.01">stifling it right well by Trump signing</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="4.141">an executive order creating a combatant</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="3.84">command Congress doesn&amp;#39;t need to do</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="4.259">anything they can go outside of their</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="5.4">jurisdiction for that and this space</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="4.89">command is going to be aligning this is</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="4.829">what CNN and then I&amp;#39;m reading the hill</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="7.171">here is saying on this space command is</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="6.391">going to be aligning with the Special</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="4.74">Operations Command Special Operations</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="6.87">Command in the ranks of Central Command</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="6.87">okay alright so let&amp;#39;s connect some dots</text>
  <text start="91.02" dur="5.13">with this one Special Operations Command</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="5.609">where&amp;#39;s that based out of that is based</text>
  <text start="96.15" dur="8.27">out of MacDill MacDill Air Force Base in</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="8.521">Florida ok so this is out of MacDill now</text>
  <text start="104.42" dur="5.83">by this space command now what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.85" dur="6.24">going to do is basically be like a</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="5.969">command that parts of Navy Air Force you</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="4.26">know parts of all the those departments</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="4.591">will be able to be unified under being</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="3.9">out of MacDill right there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="2.489">interesting things at MacDill some</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="5.369">photographs i want to show you guys</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="8.401">what&amp;#39;s at Mack do okay so we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="5.911">space okay we&amp;#39;re talking secret space</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="3.87">programs covert black</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="3.9">projects now what you have to understand</text>
  <text start="135.57" dur="3.84">about that is that there&amp;#39;s many programs</text>
  <text start="137.43" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s kind of a misnomer about secret</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="5.76">space program makes it seem like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="5.69">one there&amp;#39;s actually many and these</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="4.5">programs are unacknowledged in nature so</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="4.08">you don&amp;#39;t really know about it you could</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="4.65">have a program that&amp;#39;s being worked on by</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="3.73">multiple corporations multiple branches</text>
  <text start="154.32" dur="3.66">of the government the guys in it just</text>
  <text start="155.49" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t talk about it and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="3.6">this program in this program they have</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="6.78">different technologies so as you with</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="6.6">them but in regards to Special</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="4.47">Operations Command at MacDill I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="6.15">reference dr. Saleh dr. Michael solace</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="5.22">website here and in late 2017 is about a</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="6.06">year ago right</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="6">we had sightings of craft anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="3.96">craft I mean these are levitating</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="5.22">platforms triangular platforms we had</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="5.91">cylindrical objects and also a square</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="6.39">one right here see those square I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="6.78">look too bad okay so I square triangles</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.78">triangular ones cylindrical and when you</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="5.88">delve into the physics of</text>
  <text start="198.89" dur="7.629">electrogravitics how these craft operate</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="5.67">they are these particular shapes with</text>
  <text start="206.519" dur="3.72">toroidal energy systems within them so I</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="3.209">mean you&amp;#39;re not looking at Bernoulli&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="3.481">principle here you&amp;#39;re not looking at</text>
  <text start="211.799" dur="4.171">something that needs rocket fuel and</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="3.75">wings this is what I often try to hammer</text>
  <text start="215.97" dur="5.16">home into people&amp;#39;s heads these sorts of</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="7.62">technologies just utilize the ether per</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="6.27">se electromagnetic wave enix to levitate</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="3.36">and then I can go really really fast and</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="5.04">basically create their own little bubble</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="8.46">in space-time but these craft different</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="6.06">shapes looks like they exist at Special</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="3.81">Operations Command in mactal Air Force</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="5.28">Base and there were showings of these</text>
  <text start="240.72" dur="6.96">craft maybe this was like a soft</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="5.519">disclosure if you will right soft</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="3.42">disclosure of these sorts of things but</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="5.521">funny thing about MacDill Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="251.1" dur="5.58">actually went to speak there very early</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="5.94">on in his presidency it was about</text>
  <text start="256.68" dur="7.29">February 6 looks like he went to speak</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.529">at MacDill Air Force Base and he</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="2.86">addressed the troops that were there</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="4.66">Special Operations Command</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="6.269">now when Trump was there funny enough he</text>
  <text start="269.949" dur="5.491">met with some military leaders of his</text>
  <text start="273.099" dur="3.961">and some advisors one of those advisors</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="2.87">funny enough just coincidentally was</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="3.06">Michael Flint</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="4.06">Michael Flynn is there that&amp;#39;s when he</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="5.789">was an advisor for him before he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="5.1">anymore early on but briefed him so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.909" dur="5.581">very intriguing to see all these dots</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="4.729">sort of line up right now where are we</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="3.899">at now</text>
  <text start="292.199" dur="4.84">Trump made first is it Mack del and then</text>
  <text start="295.389" dur="3.9">the space force creation so I want to</text>
  <text start="297.039" dur="4.831">get there see space forces created in</text>
  <text start="299.289" dur="3.991">June that&amp;#39;s when he announced it not</text>
  <text start="301.87" dur="5.19">created but that&amp;#39;s when the announcement</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="5.879">was to want to create it space force</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="4.62">that was in June now let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="309.159" dur="6.421">this is just kind of where mine mind is</text>
  <text start="311.68" dur="7.32">going at with this one the idea of space</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="6.03">force I mean that was exciting everybody</text>
  <text start="319" dur="4.65">people were wanting that because it</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="6.54">sounds I mean it sounds granite just the</text>
  <text start="323.65" dur="5.579">idea that space force but now these</text>
  <text start="328.15" dur="3.9">articles the hill</text>
  <text start="329.229" dur="7.44">CNN etc they were saying that Space</text>
  <text start="332.05" dur="6.63">Command would be a Segway a lead</text>
  <text start="336.669" dur="3.511">essentially a push towards creating that</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="3.389">space force that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="340.18" dur="5.4">this that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re signing the</text>
  <text start="342.069" dur="6.57">executive order but if space force is</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="4.139">gonna be stifled and this this space</text>
  <text start="348.639" dur="2.671">command just kind of came out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="349.719" dur="3.45">right the executive order for a Space</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="2.789">Command why wouldn&amp;#39;t they have done this</text>
  <text start="353.169" dur="4.021">sooner if they don&amp;#39;t need congressional</text>
  <text start="354.099" dur="5.28">approval mm-hmm it&amp;#39;s as if the idea of</text>
  <text start="357.19" dur="4.11">space force was purposely done not to</text>
  <text start="359.379" dur="3.931">even create space force but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="4.41">like maybe this is just why I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="4.56">at it Space Command leading to space</text>
  <text start="365.71" dur="5.34">force what if they purposely did it the</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="5.639">other way they wanted to pump the idea</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="6.239">of space force out there first to lead</text>
  <text start="373.509" dur="7.981">into Space Command sort of like not</text>
  <text start="377.289" dur="6.511">disinformation is necessary but</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="5.729">misinformation might be necessary and</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="7.829">that space force I mean thinking of the</text>
  <text start="387.219" dur="6.871">idea that conveyed space force it uh it</text>
  <text start="391.629" dur="6.09">emitted conveyed a lot of imagination a</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="5.04">lot of wonder into people and when they</text>
  <text start="397.719" dur="2.671">heard the idea of space force you know</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="3.36">they thought</text>
  <text start="400.39" dur="5.58">Star Wars they have Star Trek they</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="7.02">thought like Starship Troopers you know</text>
  <text start="405.97" dur="5.67">something&amp;#39;s like that and when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.51" dur="3.87">disclosing these sorts of things to</text>
  <text start="411.64" dur="5.94">people that&amp;#39;s exactly what you have to</text>
  <text start="413.38" dur="6.38">do for a mass public that is very asleep</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="4.65">at the wheel for lack of a better term</text>
  <text start="419.76" dur="5.35">they need these sorts of ideas pumped</text>
  <text start="422.23" dur="5.49">into their heads to prepare them for it</text>
  <text start="425.11" dur="4.53">right to soften the disclosure if you</text>
  <text start="427.72" dur="5.94">will so it&amp;#39;s like space force was pumped</text>
  <text start="429.64" dur="5.85">all the time every rally he did space</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="4.38">force crowd goes wild yeah people were</text>
  <text start="435.49" dur="7.02">excited about it and it was prepping</text>
  <text start="438.04" dur="6.66">them for the idea now on December 17th</text>
  <text start="442.51" dur="4.26">funny enough 17th right yeah</text>
  <text start="444.7" dur="5.19">December 17th right before the new year</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="5.04">right before a lot of stuff looks like</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s about to take place we get an</text>
  <text start="451.81" dur="3.93">executive order for the Space Command</text>
  <text start="453.64" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s going to align with the Special</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="2.67">Operations Command</text>
  <text start="456.64" dur="6.54">what do they have we have evidence of</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="6.72">them having things and this I mean this</text>
  <text start="463.18" dur="3.63">is just kind of stunning to me look into</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="2.88">all the little dots line up with this</text>
  <text start="466.81" dur="4.05">and what this could very well lead to</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="5.7">like Special Operations Command a new</text>
  <text start="470.86" dur="6.33">command overseeing space coming out to</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="5.1">the public domain well that&amp;#39;s also going</text>
  <text start="477.19" dur="4.14">to give them a lot of capabilities as</text>
  <text start="478.81" dur="5.97">well and this what pops into my mind is</text>
  <text start="481.33" dur="6.75">the 11:11 wave here like okay they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="5.28">gaining access to technologies now is it</text>
  <text start="488.08" dur="6.69">time to begin bringing them out and they</text>
  <text start="490.06" dur="6.54">slowly but hastening pace here so these</text>
  <text start="494.77" dur="5.37">are questions in my mind things where of</text>
  <text start="496.6" dur="6.48">course I&amp;#39;m only what 10 minutes in to</text>
  <text start="500.14" dur="4.86">listen to hearing about this but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="5.91">see how it plays out right the articles</text>
  <text start="505" dur="6.09">are stating that pence is going to be</text>
  <text start="508.99" dur="3.45">making a couple meetings later this week</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="5.85">is gonna go to Kennedy Space Center</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="6.96">Florida interestingly enough and also</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="4.8">the Pentagon so we&amp;#39;ll see where pence is</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="4.65">that with all of this I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="7.14">of interesting thoughts on pence lately</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="9.57">and we&amp;#39;ll see what comes about maybe</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="5.25">space force was just the you know they</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="3">never</text>
  <text start="534.13" dur="4.88">and to go forward with that very</text>
  <text start="536.62" dur="5.31">possibly or this could be again a</text>
  <text start="539.01" dur="6.88">lead-in into the space force we know the</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="6">house is gaining control of or the demo</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="3.54">or the deep state not to use the</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="3.15">Democrat conservative thing err but the</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="5.88">deep state is gaining control of the</text>
  <text start="551.08" dur="6.03">house more so so we&amp;#39;ll see I&amp;#39;m not too</text>
  <text start="555.31" dur="3.98">sure of the Senate&amp;#39;s involvement in all</text>
  <text start="557.11" dur="4.02">of this if it&amp;#39;s just a house</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="4.33">jurisdiction when it comes to the space</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="4.19">force but space command what&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="7.29">gonna lead to it&amp;#39;s gonna be interesting</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="8.73">seeing how this goes into 2019 and just</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="6.72">last video was it Popular Mechanics</text>
  <text start="574.05" dur="5.59">where they ran an article a couple days</text>
  <text start="577.63" dur="4.08">ago saying that they are going to be</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="3.66">classifying a lot of things in orbit</text>
  <text start="581.71" dur="3.38">right and I was saying some of those</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="4.23">things don&amp;#39;t actually need to orbit well</text>
  <text start="585.09" dur="3.85">they&amp;#39;re at Special Operations Command it</text>
  <text start="587.53" dur="4.49">sounds like they might have things that</text>
  <text start="588.94" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t need to orbit and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="592.02" dur="5.35">disclosing in soft ways you know showing</text>
  <text start="594.7" dur="5.64">their craft time and time again and now</text>
  <text start="597.37" dur="6.24">it could be such that they want to begin</text>
  <text start="600.34" dur="6.92">the process of making it known to the</text>
  <text start="603.61" dur="8.24">public so we&amp;#39;ll see anyway</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="4.59">sign me up guys it&amp;#39;s all for this one</text>
