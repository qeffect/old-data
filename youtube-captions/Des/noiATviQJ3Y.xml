  <text start="137.37" dur="4.56">was amazing all the volunteers out there</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="3.96">James just creates such a positive</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="5.16">atmosphere they&amp;#39;re like he doesn&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="143.82" dur="5.85">any bullshit enter that that wrench</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="4.38">enter those grounds so it&amp;#39;s incredible</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="5.03">what you guys present on we actually</text>
  <text start="151.47" dur="5.37">presented on the human body and</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="3.97">extraterrestrial beings and kind of how</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="3.84">to understand I think the relationship</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="3.3">between you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of I</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="3.24">think I don&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="3.32">misunderstandings but there&amp;#39;s a kind of</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="4.08">a limited understanding of</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="4.18">extraterrestrials in this lateral</text>
  <text start="168" dur="3.39">dimension and then and I kind of wanted</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="3.78">to present on everything that we know</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="3.33">about that well yeah I mean because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.25" dur="3.15">not just extraterrestrials right you</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="3.66">have interdimensional beings and you</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="4.11">have like the negative ETS they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="178.38" dur="4.47">coming into like what we would call like</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="5.039">demons and you know the spectrum is so</text>
  <text start="182.85" dur="6.18">massive and then on top of that you know</text>
  <text start="185.549" dur="5.671">really show that our super our bodies</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="5.03">our human bodies are very special you</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="5.94">know we almost like super normal and how</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="4.989">really weird divine beings man exactly</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="4.47">all these powers that people barely know</text>
  <text start="199.049" dur="4.141">about them barely tuned into exactly and</text>
  <text start="201.63" dur="3.48">like I mean if you look at every</text>
  <text start="203.19" dur="4.98">religion that says that we are created</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="5.129">in the divine image image of God I guess</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="2.55">you could say you know so I mean</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="3.421">literally</text>
  <text start="210.72" dur="8.549">so I mean using that and then how and</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="8.549">why the negative et&amp;#39;s just in general</text>
  <text start="219.269" dur="5.161">why so much activity on earth you know</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="4.59">why they&amp;#39;re so interested in us yes</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="4.95">little humans here and we all think</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re like this puny undeveloped you</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="4.26">know life-form but I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="3.239">much the opposite of right into there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="2.97">a read there&amp;#39;s a reason why number one</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="2.911">all the benevolent species are here</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="3.29">interested in this planet right now and</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="4.08">want us to succeed in number two all the</text>
  <text start="239.9" dur="2.64">malevolent the bad species have been</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="3.199">here for</text>
  <text start="242.54" dur="4.77">long time sort of farming us in a way</text>
  <text start="245.209" dur="3.601">you know harvesting our energy sack well</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="3.569">I mean and also one thing we were</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="3.84">showing is that we only use 10% of our</text>
  <text start="250.879" dur="4.321">brain according to science right we</text>
  <text start="252.65" dur="6.059">could unlock that I mean who knows yeah</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="5.61">that DNA is just junk that&amp;#39;s just junk</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="3.601">DNA you don&amp;#39;t need that take that out</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="3.18">and put it in with some nanobots or</text>
  <text start="262.31" dur="6.09">something I&amp;#39;ll go watch your TV then yes</text>
  <text start="263.99" dur="5.88">go watch your TV so but speaking it well</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="3.15">actually one of the cool things that I</text>
  <text start="269.87" dur="3.48">saw and this guy actually one of the</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="5.459">last nights we were there going back to</text>
  <text start="273.35" dur="5.64">that there is this super bright UFO that</text>
  <text start="277.009" dur="4.41">was flying over as the brightest I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="278.99" dur="4.47">seen and there was like this either</text>
  <text start="281.419" dur="3.81">ejected something or there was like some</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="4.679">kind of shooting star or something that</text>
  <text start="285.229" dur="4.951">went right behind it and then it changed</text>
  <text start="288.139" dur="3.301">course and started going faster and then</text>
  <text start="290.18" dur="3.06">it just stopped and it looked like it</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="3.27">was hovering over us for a while and</text>
  <text start="293.24" dur="3.81">then it just like kind of took off</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="3.84">straight so then it just got smaller and</text>
  <text start="297.05" dur="6.119">how long have a span did this all happen</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="6.75">it from no no no no this was probably a</text>
  <text start="303.169" dur="3.99">matter of at least a few minutes</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="4.02">actually okay we were fought because as</text>
  <text start="307.159" dur="3.781">soon as I shine the laser on it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.32" dur="3.45">when I saw it looked like he injected</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="3.3">something from the spacecraft resting</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="4.1">and then how late in the morning was</text>

  <text start="389.68" dur="5.22">at 9/11 you know everything&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="391.42" dur="6.39">but really that was the first time when</text>
  <text start="394.9" dur="5.85">I started realizing our government right</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="4.22">now is really behind the scenes with all</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="3.9">of this because I was seeing both sides</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="4.66">fighting and I&amp;#39;m like man this is crazy</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="3.45">some crazy things something&amp;#39;s wrong here</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="3.6">all these humans shouldn&amp;#39;t be at each</text>
  <text start="408.1" dur="4.29">other&amp;#39;s throats doing all this yeah and</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="3.93">that was also in Hong Kong at the</text>
  <text start="412.39" dur="3.99">protest there and then right away I</text>
  <text start="414.22" dur="3.78">whenever the first in so seeing all of</text>
  <text start="416.38" dur="3.96">this so I&amp;#39;m like man there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="418" dur="5.04">going on behind the scenes and also like</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="4.44">I would be at an event and something</text>
  <text start="423.04" dur="4.14">what something minor would happen and</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="4.8">then I would come back and see the media</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="4.55">blowing that like mainstream media not</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="4.47">not epic times with the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="431.73" dur="4.63">focusing just on that small thing and</text>
  <text start="434.05" dur="4.38">making it seem like this massive thing</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="4.02">happened and you were there witnessing</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="4.26">certain events so you had the direct</text>
  <text start="440.38" dur="4.56">experience saying that&amp;#39;s a lie exactly</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="4.05">that didn&amp;#39;t happen and he was like well</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="5.82">yeah yeah so I was the creative director</text>
  <text start="446.74" dur="5.52">and so you know he&amp;#39;s shooting photos and</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m actually laying out the front page</text>
  <text start="452.26" dur="4.59">laying out the inside of the paper and</text>
  <text start="454.6" dur="7.38">him and I are talking basically while</text>
  <text start="456.85" dur="7.56">he&amp;#39;s you know on his photography jobs</text>
  <text start="461.98" dur="5.52">and I would be looking at what we were</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="4.71">laying out and while watching CNN and</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="3.57">all of these different media cover it</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="3.57">and lie about all the different things</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="2.73">that we&amp;#39;re going on you&amp;#39;re laying out</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="4.02">these papers you&amp;#39;re like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="4.71">different than that it&amp;#39;s like well yeah</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m watching the original</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="3.51">stuff and then I&amp;#39;m looking at what</text>
  <text start="480.1" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re saying and I&amp;#39;m like I don&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="482.02" dur="4.83">was actually blowing my mind</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="4.74">it took me a while to realize how off</text>
  <text start="486.85" dur="4.02">the mainstream media was cuz you know</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re all kind of programmed I guess you</text>
  <text start="490.87" dur="4.8">could say do I believe that what these</text>
  <text start="493.09" dur="4.77">talking heads are telling us is true and</text>
  <text start="495.67" dur="4.03">that there are like you know journalism</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="4.12">at its best shouldn&amp;#39;t be those things</text>
  <text start="499.7" dur="4.08">right you&amp;#39;re taught that growing up and</text>
  <text start="501.98" dur="3.9">you know freedom of press all of those</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="4.98">things and then to see it in front of me</text>
  <text start="505.88" dur="6.06">and it was like this atomic bomb inside</text>
  <text start="508.76" dur="5.22">me went off of just wanting to do</text>
  <text start="511.94" dur="5.46">something about it right and and I think</text>
  <text start="513.98" dur="5.61">towards the end of our careers I guess</text>
  <text start="517.4" dur="5.76">you could say at the epoch times it was</text>
  <text start="519.59" dur="6.48">about - it was at the end of 2017 and we</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="5.34">had the opportunity to do like basically</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="4.02">to create a channel and him and I talked</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="2.91">for a while at first I was gonna do most</text>
  <text start="530.09" dur="3.51">of the branding stuff cuz you know I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="3.72">designer and then we just decided to</text>

  <text start="941.419" dur="3.72">you know we we went deep into this</text>
  <text start="943.039" dur="4.05">rabbit hole we decided to definitely</text>
  <text start="945.139" dur="4.14">take what other people&amp;#39;s research was</text>
  <text start="947.089" dur="4.71">but then also do our own on this and</text>
  <text start="949.279" dur="5.88">what we ended up finding was really</text>
  <text start="951.799" dur="6.02">unsettling especially in the way of art</text>
  <text start="955.159" dur="5.191">so as you know like you know John</text>
  <text start="957.819" dur="4.09">performance art okay it&amp;#39;s not just there</text>
  <text start="960.35" dur="3.809">from Sartre it&amp;#39;s also that these people</text>
  <text start="961.909" dur="3.691">are collectors and when you understand</text>
  <text start="964.159" dur="2.941">that these people are collectors and</text>
  <text start="965.6" dur="3.299">then that the artwork that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="967.1" dur="3.689">getting in is often of pedophilia and</text>
  <text start="968.899" dur="3.33">all these different things and you start</text>
  <text start="970.789" dur="3.3">looking at where they&amp;#39;re getting at the</text>
  <text start="972.229" dur="6.06">galleries ie people behind the galleries</text>

  <text start="990.499" dur="3.3">on those you know there&amp;#39;s a reason Q</text>
  <text start="992.509" dur="2.55">says symbolism would be their downfall</text>
  <text start="993.799" dur="2.73">because that&amp;#39;s how many of these</text>
  <text start="995.059" dur="4.98">individuals communicate with each other</text>
  <text start="996.529" dur="7.56">and seeing this on all sorts of</text>

  <text start="1585.91" dur="4.17">they boom get on ink chin let&amp;#39;s do some</text>
  <text start="1588.04" dur="4.08">researching and who knows who might be</text>
  <text start="1590.08" dur="3.45">lurking on those boards and picking up</text>
  <text start="1592.12" dur="3.78">what you might be putting down on there</text>
  <text start="1593.53" dur="4.23">right man I think the H Hann boards have</text>
  <text start="1595.9" dur="4.32">been so important for everything here</text>
  <text start="1597.76" dur="4.71">yeah and I think the the biggest you</text>
  <text start="1600.22" dur="4.67">know when you think about what the work</text>
  <text start="1602.47" dur="6.15">that we&amp;#39;re doing right the biggest</text>
  <text start="1604.89" dur="5.29">distraction from us honestly doing this</text>
  <text start="1608.62" dur="2.94">and exposing all the stuff that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1610.18" dur="3">trying to expose and doing all the</text>
  <text start="1611.56" dur="4.65">research that we&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="1613.18" dur="4.41">actually Q himself or itself because</text>
  <text start="1616.21" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a group I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1617.59" dur="3.9">person but if Q wasn&amp;#39;t doing this and</text>
  <text start="1620.11" dur="4.23">dropping all of this stuff and really</text>
  <text start="1621.49" dur="4.65">like paving the way like it would I</text>
  <text start="1624.34" dur="3.78">think I really think it would have been</text>
  <text start="1626.14" dur="4.53">so much harder for us oh we would go on</text>
  <text start="1628.12" dur="4.92">this okay so discombobulated and we&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="1630.67" dur="4.08">huge targets I mean think about it like</text>
  <text start="1633.04" dur="3.63">well well this this this is what</text>
  <text start="1634.75" dur="3.9">inspired and motivated a lot of people I</text>
  <text start="1636.67" dur="3.51">mean yeah sure I think what Q did it</text>
  <text start="1638.65" dur="3.72">kind of funneled everybody into one</text>
  <text start="1640.18" dur="4.95">place which originally was fortune would</text>
  <text start="1642.37" dur="4.83">you have taken everybody moved to hmnh</text>
  <text start="1645.13" dur="4.17">and but I think what the really really</text>
  <text start="1647.2" dur="4.14">good thing about this is that it kind of</text>
  <text start="1649.3" dur="3.66">everyone kind of joined forces and like</text>
  <text start="1651.34" dur="3.15">you know Q post one thing and then</text>
  <text start="1652.96" dur="3.69">everyone&amp;#39;s like oh let&amp;#39;s all research</text>
  <text start="1654.49" dur="3.66">this together so everyone&amp;#39;s not on their</text>
  <text start="1656.65" dur="4.2">own thing like doing different every</text>
  <text start="1658.15" dur="4.74">every time you see Q post about a</text>
  <text start="1660.85" dur="3.5">particular topic you feel the collective</text>

  <text start="1704.49" dur="4.019">hope this injects a little bit more hope</text>
  <text start="1706.769" dur="4.831">into the entire movement that&amp;#39;s going on</text>

  <text start="1949.62" dur="6.06">I what was that were those infrared</text>
  <text start="1952.14" dur="5.55">goggles they were so they had really</text>
  <text start="1955.68" dur="4.02">expensive equipment out there to survey</text>
  <text start="1957.69" dur="2.97">and document military yeah</text>
  <text start="1959.7" dur="3.3">military-grade</text>

  <text start="1963" dur="3.03">any activity or what was going on in the</text>
  <text start="1964.71" dur="4.08">mountain because the mountains are just</text>
  <text start="1966.03" dur="4.32">a very strange phenomena right and so I</text>
  <text start="1968.79" dur="3.3">was given the goggles at a certain point</text>
  <text start="1970.35" dur="3.27">and I got that I got to use them for</text>
  <text start="1972.09" dur="3.9">about five or ten minutes straight and</text>
  <text start="1973.62" dur="4.92">so somebody gives me the goggles and as</text>
  <text start="1975.99" dur="4.8">soon as I pull them up I&amp;#39;m not kidding</text>
  <text start="1978.54" dur="4.02">immediately a light appears on the</text>
  <text start="1980.79" dur="3.84">mountain and then I see another light</text>
  <text start="1982.56" dur="4.23">appeared across the mountain and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1984.63" dur="4.71">watching and I&amp;#39;m like oh my god what is</text>
  <text start="1986.79" dur="4.68">this and all of a sudden this stream of</text>
  <text start="1989.34" dur="4.71">lights appears between those two dots</text>
  <text start="1991.47" dur="4.53">Wow I&amp;#39;m looking at the same thing yeah</text>
  <text start="1994.05" dur="3.69">and I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m sitting there and</text>
  <text start="1996" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m like oh my god everyone&amp;#39;s like what</text>
  <text start="1997.74" dur="2.43">are you saying what are you saying and</text>
  <text start="1999.12" dur="3.57">then when you say no you have to</text>
  <text start="2000.17" dur="4.46">understand there are two dots were like</text>
  <text start="2002.69" dur="4.44">I mean you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2004.63" dur="4.48">thousands of meters of away on this</text>
  <text start="2007.13" dur="4.2">mountain right and there&amp;#39;s a stream of</text>
  <text start="2009.11" dur="3.39">lights connecting those two dots and I</text>
  <text start="2011.33" dur="2.52">was like I don&amp;#39;t even know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2012.5" dur="3.18">looking at right now and I immediately</text>
  <text start="2013.85" dur="3.69">gave the goggles to someone else and</text>
  <text start="2015.68" dur="3.18">they were like oh my god what is this</text>
  <text start="2017.54" dur="3.24">right like it wasn&amp;#39;t just me that saw</text>
  <text start="2018.86" dur="3.96">this but it was dark it was nighttime</text>
  <text start="2020.78" dur="3.18">but these infrared goggles do it is when</text>
  <text start="2022.82" dur="2.73">you pull them up and you look through</text>
  <text start="2023.96" dur="2.03">them it almost looks like it&amp;#39;s daytime</text>
  <text start="2025.55" dur="3.14">right</text>

  <text start="2030.1" dur="5.22">talking about what I saw was impossible</text>
  <text start="2032.309" dur="4.661">it was an impossible thing like it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2035.32" dur="3.72">like I saw this like it was two people</text>
  <text start="2036.97" dur="4.17">or there was like fires that&amp;#39;s hyper</text>

  <text start="2041.14" dur="4.59">possible</text>
  <text start="2043.12" dur="4.11">I mean anyway it was just a very strange</text>
  <text start="2045.73" dur="3.03">thing that I saw</text>
  <text start="2047.23" dur="3.27">totally unexplainable I have no idea</text>
  <text start="2048.76" dur="3.21">what it was but there was credit the</text>
  <text start="2050.5" dur="3.09">lights coming off of those mountains</text>

  <text start="2065.29" dur="5.28">mountain and there&amp;#39;s really only a</text>
  <text start="2066.61" dur="5.64">couple paths that go up to it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2070.57" dur="3.569">just very it&amp;#39;s very weird when you see</text>
  <text start="2072.25" dur="3.75">these lights that aren&amp;#39;t constant that</text>
