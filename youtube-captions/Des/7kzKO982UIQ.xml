  <text start="1363.7" dur="6.48">I&amp;#39;ve got a jet I&amp;#39;ve got to get some</text>
  <text start="1367.18" dur="6.03">stuff together a few more questions here</text>
  <text start="1370.18" dur="7.5">ooh Greenland yes let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="1373.21" dur="5.85">Greenland so I had a lot of thoughts</text>
  <text start="1377.68" dur="3.9">come up in my head when when the</text>
  <text start="1379.06" dur="7.34">Greenland conversation comes to mind I</text>
  <text start="1381.58" dur="4.82">mean it makes me wonder what the</text>
  <text start="1386.46" dur="4.81">projects any secret classified projects</text>
  <text start="1389.23" dur="4.26">military intelligence or otherwise from</text>
  <text start="1391.27" dur="4.29">mainly America but really in any country</text>
  <text start="1393.49" dur="4.26">what have they been doing in Greenland</text>
  <text start="1395.56" dur="3.87">for decades and decades a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1397.75" dur="3.66">have been looking into project iceworm</text>
  <text start="1399.43" dur="6.15">research which is great I heard of that</text>
  <text start="1401.41" dur="7.19">a few years ago I believe Cory Cory</text>
  <text start="1405.58" dur="8.13">Goods dad was associate product ice warm</text>
  <text start="1408.6" dur="7.96">but yeah what are they what are they</text>
  <text start="1413.71" dur="5.52">been doing what&amp;#39;s uh does Greenland have</text>
  <text start="1416.56" dur="5.46">any secrets like Antarctica you know</text>
  <text start="1419.23" dur="5.16">under the ice there we&amp;#39;ve heard of a lot</text>
  <text start="1422.02" dur="6.21">of stories about ancient ruins and</text>
  <text start="1424.39" dur="6.03">various stuff that was just flash-frozen</text>
  <text start="1428.23" dur="4.53">under the ice in Antarctica during any</text>
  <text start="1430.42" dur="4.46">sort of pole shift so it was Greenland</text>
  <text start="1432.76" dur="6.45">Greenland has some ancient stuff there</text>
  <text start="1434.88" dur="5.89">flash-frozen under some ice and not just</text>
  <text start="1439.21" dur="4.47">that but do you think of if there was</text>
  <text start="1440.77" dur="4.38">any sort of physical geophysical pole</text>
  <text start="1443.68" dur="5.6">shift not just a magnetic with the</text>
  <text start="1445.15" dur="4.13">magnetic fields but an actual earth tilt</text>
  <text start="1450.45" dur="4.8">maybe Greenland was used to be in a</text>
  <text start="1452.77" dur="7.74">different place in a not so distant past</text>
  <text start="1455.25" dur="8.59">and then begs a lot more questions you</text>
  <text start="1460.51" dur="6.29">know it was researching some stuff</text>
  <text start="1463.84" dur="5.22">recently on the expanding Earth theory</text>
  <text start="1466.8" dur="3.58">it&amp;#39;s not just a pole shift but maybe</text>
  <text start="1469.06" dur="4.35">something happened with Greenland</text>
  <text start="1470.38" dur="7.31">expanding earth and I a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="1473.41" dur="11.79">a lot of stuff you could research there</text>
  <text start="1477.69" dur="10.96">if you know where to look and then I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1485.2" dur="5.19">seen some digs on Greenland now that you</text>
  <text start="1488.65" dur="3.18">know each hands-down you kind of go to a</text>
  <text start="1490.39" dur="3.39">lot of people have been posting their</text>
  <text start="1491.83" dur="4.02">research on Twitter a little more so but</text>
  <text start="1493.78" dur="4.53">people looking into the air force base</text>
  <text start="1495.85" dur="7.32">that&amp;#39;s there on Greenland tool th ule</text>
  <text start="1498.31" dur="7.89">and yes tool tool Society of you know</text>
  <text start="1503.17" dur="6.93">early Germany interesting just</text>
  <text start="1506.2" dur="5.1">coincidence there but you&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="1510.1" dur="3.54">allow for space then you had that</text>
  <text start="1511.3" dur="5.46">explosion that happened last year think</text>
  <text start="1513.64" dur="5.25">near tool Air Force Base and then news</text>
  <text start="1516.76" dur="4.89">reports claimed it was an asteroid yet</text>
  <text start="1518.89" dur="4.35">nobody saw this asteroid as per the same</text>
  <text start="1521.65" dur="3.87">report so nobody saw the sastras</text>
  <text start="1523.24" dur="3.93">exploded no there&amp;#39;s magic explosion in</text>
  <text start="1525.52" dur="4.38">the atmosphere so I&amp;#39;m thinking that</text>
  <text start="1527.17" dur="10.49">maybe that wasn&amp;#39;t an asteroid maybe that</text>
  <text start="1529.9" dur="7.76">was shadow shadow space war who knows</text>
  <text start="1540.66" dur="5.29">probably a few people that know but uh</text>
  <text start="1543.04" dur="4.71">huh we don&amp;#39;t we just got to pick up the</text>
  <text start="1545.95" dur="4.08">pieces and try to fit it together yeah</text>
  <text start="1547.75" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m wondering you know that matter cuz</text>
  <text start="1550.03" dur="3.12">magical explosion of an asteroid they</text>
  <text start="1551.86" dur="4.44">didn&amp;#39;t see yeah they would have saw an</text>
  <text start="1553.15" dur="5.91">asteroid come on it would have had some</text>
  <text start="1556.3" dur="8.85">sort of telemetry equipment that would</text>
  <text start="1559.06" dur="7.95">have picked that up so maybe some black</text>
  <text start="1565.15" dur="8.31">project craft was taken out by another</text>
  <text start="1567.01" dur="8.67">black project crab I just get that I</text>
  <text start="1573.46" dur="3.6">just get an esoteric vibe to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1575.68" dur="2.88">going on with greening you know some</text>
  <text start="1577.06" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s a bigger reason there&amp;#39;s a deeper</text>
  <text start="1578.56" dur="5.37">reason why maybe that interest or this</text>
  <text start="1581.8" dur="5.9">gets brought up or something something</text>
  <text start="1583.93" dur="7.65">there and it&amp;#39;s funny how that&amp;#39;s been so</text>
  <text start="1587.7" dur="6.37">not talked about not talked about even</text>
  <text start="1591.58" dur="6.95">more than Antarctica Antarctica&amp;#39;s hushed</text>
  <text start="1594.07" dur="6.84">but know many things about Greenland</text>
  <text start="1598.53" dur="4">yeah and where&amp;#39;s where&amp;#39;s Greenland gonna</text>
  <text start="1600.91" dur="4.07">be after this next pole shift coming up</text>
  <text start="1602.53" dur="2.45">right</text>
  <text start="1612.64" dur="9.67">scheme in the comments here we&amp;#39;ll finish</text>
  <text start="1617.09" dur="7.77">up grand solar minimum yeah a lot of</text>
  <text start="1622.31" dur="6.68">good stuff on the Sun to discuss that</text>
  <text start="1624.86" dur="7.86">needs to be discussed and quite frankly</text>
  <text start="1628.99" dur="5.23">if you&amp;#39;re talking about hidden esoteric</text>
  <text start="1632.72" dur="4.92">research that the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1634.22" dur="5.99">want out astrophysics</text>
  <text start="1637.64" dur="5.94">solar mechanics is one of those things</text>
  <text start="1640.21" dur="5.02">like massively you know they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1643.58" dur="3.09">us to understand the true physics and</text>
  <text start="1645.23" dur="3.6">what happens with our Sun because then</text>
  <text start="1646.67" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;ll learn a little bit more about the</text>
  <text start="1648.83" dur="4.8">cycles here on earth and a little bit</text>
  <text start="1651.95" dur="4.41">more about ancient history and our</text>
