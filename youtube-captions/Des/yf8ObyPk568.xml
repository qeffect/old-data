  <text start="0.06" dur="4.71">what&amp;#39;s up guys back on that video grind</text>
  <text start="2.669" dur="5.43">for you today and in this installment I</text>
  <text start="4.77" dur="6.03">want to philosophize for you a little</text>
  <text start="8.099" dur="5.941">bit and discuss something called the</text>
  <text start="10.8" dur="5.67">hero&amp;#39;s journey which was invented by a</text>
  <text start="14.04" dur="4.23">man named dr. Joseph Campbell and the</text>
  <text start="16.47" dur="4.319">reason I want to discuss this hero&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="18.27" dur="5.13">journey with you is because I believe</text>
  <text start="20.789" dur="5.4">that this concept can very well help you</text>
  <text start="23.4" dur="4.68">discover who you really are and help</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="3.66">anybody with trials and tribulations</text>
  <text start="28.08" dur="4.319">that&amp;#39;s going on in their own individual</text>
  <text start="29.849" dur="4.651">lives but it can also help us understand</text>
  <text start="32.399" dur="4.921">what&amp;#39;s going on in a global collective</text>
  <text start="34.5" dur="5.19">scale and I&amp;#39;ll kind of tie those things</text>
  <text start="37.32" dur="5.13">together a little later on in this video</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="5.76">but first I will tell you about dr.</text>
  <text start="42.45" dur="5.699">Joseph Campbell and outlined this hero&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="6.69">journey for you dr. Joseph Campbell was</text>
  <text start="48.149" dur="8.011">a very renowned very popular neo Jungian</text>
  <text start="52.14" dur="6.36">psychoanalyst in the 1900s and a lot of</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="5.669">people who I follow who been very</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="6.299">influential in my own growth referenced</text>
  <text start="61.829" dur="6.351">his work and for instance David Wilcock</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="6.961">references is quite a bit and another</text>
  <text start="68.18" dur="6.43">influential online mentor to me his name</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="5.399">is Elliott Hulse and he is referenced</text>
  <text start="74.61" dur="4.71">this hero&amp;#39;s journey a bit too so the</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="2.881">synchronicity of seeing them both talk</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="4.35">about it</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="6.689">gave me the kind of intuitive drive to</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="4.62">research more into this and I found it</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="3.39">to be extremely helpful for me for that</text>
  <text start="88.29" dur="5.789">for me so I&amp;#39;m passing it along to you</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="6.301">now his principle work his most famous</text>
  <text start="94.079" dur="4.981">work was a book called the hero of a</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="7.62">Thousand Faces which dr. Campbell wrote</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="6.87">in released in 1949 and this book the</text>
  <text start="104.04" dur="5.73">hero with a thousand faces describes</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="7.2">this hero&amp;#39;s journey and what dr.</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="6.12">Campbell did is that he studied myth he</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="6.919">studied many many different stories from</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="6.57">the story of Buddha and Jesus to more</text>
  <text start="120.049" dur="4.481">modern stories he studied many many</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="4.5">different plays and books and all kinds</text>
  <text start="124.53" dur="4.649">of stuff and that&amp;#39;s why he called it the</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="4.62">hero of a thousand faces because this</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="4.151">hero&amp;#39;s journey is essentially a pattern</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="4">or it&amp;#39;s a frame</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="7.44">work that discusses the hero archetype</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="11.91">and how that hero transforms himself and</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="9.27">overcomes everything to basically have a</text>
  <text start="147.49" dur="4.64">spiritual transformation what you could</text>
  <text start="150.04" dur="4.56">literally call an an alchemical</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="4.36">transmutation right this hero&amp;#39;s journey</text>
  <text start="154.6" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s not so much about the hero it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.49" dur="6.66">about overcoming overcoming hardships</text>
  <text start="160.84" dur="4.35">and how that transforms you so it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="163.15" dur="2.66">a spiritual alchemy it&amp;#39;s really really</text>
  <text start="165.19" dur="4.65">cool</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="5.95">anyway this hero&amp;#39;s journey that he</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="3.9">described in the hero of a thousand</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="3.9">faces which interested in HeLa</text>
  <text start="173.74" dur="4.26">interestingly enough George Lucas</text>
  <text start="175.66" dur="4.44">actually made Star Wars based off this</text>
  <text start="178" dur="3.45">book based off the hero&amp;#39;s journey and a</text>
  <text start="180.1" dur="3.23">documentary about Joseph Campbell is</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="4.77">actually filmed at Skywalker Ranch so</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="5.35">very influential work that not many</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="4.83">people in this modern day and age know</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="3.69">about so very interesting which is why I</text>
  <text start="191.05" dur="4.71">want to pass along this information to</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="7.83">you but this hero&amp;#39;s journey I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="8.79">summarize it as best I can and it occurs</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="6.96">in dr. Campbell outlined seventeen state</text>
  <text start="204.55" dur="5.76">seventeen steps that occur in three</text>
  <text start="207.16" dur="6.48">stages there is the departure the</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="5.73">initiation and the return okay and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="213.64" dur="5.67">kind of paraphrase these seventeen steps</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="6.39">for you so the very first thing that</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="6.75">happens is in the hero&amp;#39;s journey is</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="5.1">called the call to action and you can I</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="4.17">mean you can literally think of this</text>
  <text start="227.53" dur="6.15">with any pick your favorite story or</text>
  <text start="230.23" dur="7.53">your favorite movie and as I&amp;#39;m outlining</text>
  <text start="233.68" dur="6.99">these stages think of how that story</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="4.83">fits into this this is like a a perfect</text>
  <text start="240.67" dur="5.52">puzzle that literally any single story</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="6.39">can fit into I like to think of it in</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="4.35">terms of Star Wars or one of my favorite</text>
  <text start="248.98" dur="3.6">movies is gladiator I like to think of</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="4.71">that too but the first is the call to</text>
  <text start="252.58" dur="5.49">action right that call to action in Star</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="5.85">Wars is Luke&amp;#39;s aunt and uncle get blown</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="7.2">to pieces on Tatooine or in gladiator</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="5.49">that is Maximus Aurelius is family</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="1.95">getting killed right there&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="3.33">call to</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="4.56">for the hero to embark upon his quest so</text>
  <text start="269.92" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s the very first thing that happens</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="4.95">and once that call of action happens the</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="6.78">second stage is the refusal call to</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="5.49">action there is the refusal to not go on</text>
  <text start="280.72" dur="4.35">this journey right Luke didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="5.04">go on it but then the mentor HAP enters</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="4.17">into the picture that is step three so</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="6.06">the mentor enters in that&amp;#39;s Bobbi Wan</text>
  <text start="289.24" dur="7.65">kenobe talks to the hero and the hero</text>
  <text start="293.32" dur="5.43">then agrees to embark upon his quest and</text>
  <text start="296.89" dur="5.1">that is called crossing the threshold</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="5.22">and once that threshold is crossed the</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="4.74">hero goes into what&amp;#39;s called the belly</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="4.83">of the whale and that&amp;#39;s when he starts</text>
  <text start="306.73" dur="6.26">fighting that&amp;#39;s when he over that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="308.8" dur="7.47">he has a lot of battles that&amp;#39;s when he</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="5.92">befriends allies that&amp;#39;s when he meets</text>
  <text start="316.27" dur="4.29">his enemies and even the enemies have</text>
  <text start="318.91" dur="3.81">different archetypes that they follow</text>
  <text start="320.56" dur="7.56">along that Joseph Campbell outlines</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="7.77">there&amp;#39;s the I can&amp;#39;t remember right now</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="4.799">but a lot of different archetypes and</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="4.83">you know the battles occur there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="5.971">always the the temptress whether that</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="6.12">temptress is a woman or something else</text>
  <text start="338.89" dur="4.2">that tempts that hero so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="7.65">of archetypes that enter into this play</text>
  <text start="343.09" dur="7.71">the four that hero now once he goes</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="5.01">through that belly of the whale once he</text>
  <text start="350.8" dur="6.119">endures his trials and his battles the</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="8.46">final ordeal is what that hero then</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="7.651">faces and that final ordeal is to get</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="5.55">there he must go through what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="364.57" dur="8.31">the dark night of the soul and that dark</text>
  <text start="368.11" dur="7.41">night of the soul is there there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="4.76">been many books written about this</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="6.38">concept the dark night of the soul is</text>
  <text start="377.64" dur="7.39">hitting rock bottom it&amp;#39;s realizing that</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="5.59">he basically the hero coming face to</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="4.53">face with all of his issues and then</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="6.21">transcending that the dark night of the</text>
  <text start="389.56" dur="6.359">soul is that Phoenix literally rising</text>
  <text start="393.7" dur="4.98">from the ashes it&amp;#39;s burning down and</text>
  <text start="395.919" dur="4.301">then transmuting I like the word</text>
  <text start="398.68" dur="4.78">transmuting more than transfer</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="4.38">because transformation implies that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="4.8">still the same thing just a little</text>
  <text start="404.6" dur="6.3">different transmutation is has more of a</text>
  <text start="408.26" dur="4.41">content connotation of being completely</text>
  <text start="410.9" dur="5.09">different which is why I like that word</text>
  <text start="412.67" dur="9.45">better in terms of alchemy and these</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="7.81">types of archetypal changes so the dark</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="5.19">night of the soul literally transmutes</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="5.88">the hero he then has his final ordeal</text>
  <text start="427.31" dur="5.16">which is the final battle overcomes that</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="6.3">once he overcomes that final ordeal</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="9.3">there&amp;#39;s then the road back and upon the</text>
  <text start="435.98" dur="12.27">road back there is a a temptation for</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="9.36">the hero to stay in what&amp;#39;s called to</text>
  <text start="448.25" dur="6.06">stay in that state in that world</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="6.33">of spiritual transformation rather than</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="6.12">returning to his fellow man and sharing</text>
  <text start="457.46" dur="7.8">the gifts that he&amp;#39;s found so after the</text>
  <text start="460.43" dur="7.71">ordeal and after the after overcoming</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="5.85">that temptation to refuse then it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="468.14" dur="6.26">road back and the reward so that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="471.11" dur="7.17">of an outline of this hero&amp;#39;s journey and</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="6.09">it is it&amp;#39;s very profound work I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="478.28" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;ll link a couple basics down below and</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="7.9">I invite you to look into this hero&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="6.6">journey because of how individually it</text>
  <text start="488.39" dur="5.55">can help us understand our own call to</text>
  <text start="490.97" dur="4.74">adventures and our own it can literally</text>
  <text start="493.94" dur="4.59">help you understand yourself that these</text>
  <text start="495.71" dur="4.83">archetypes that different psychologists</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="4.02">and psychoanalysts like Carl Jung and</text>
  <text start="500.54" dur="4.32">Joseph Campbell and Robert Moore deal</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="5.19">with are extremely helpful in</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="4.77">understanding yourself and we all have</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="5.09">our own call calls to adventure we all</text>
  <text start="509.63" dur="5.73">have our own mentors in our lives</text>
  <text start="512.83" dur="4">whether we know that mentor in person or</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s like an online mentor or whatnot</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="5.399">and we all have our own dark nights of</text>
  <text start="519.95" dur="4.8">the soul our own rock bottom&amp;#39;s that we</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="5.61">hit that we have to realize in our lives</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="6.03">like I&amp;#39;m gonna have to change or</text>
  <text start="527.839" dur="4.591">things are going to keep going the way</text>
  <text start="530.78" dur="3.1">they are whether it&amp;#39;s in a career or a</text>
  <text start="532.43" dur="4">relationship or</text>
  <text start="533.88" dur="3.9">or whatnot so this this concept of the</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="5.03">hero&amp;#39;s journey is something we all</text>
  <text start="537.78" dur="6.75">embark upon it&amp;#39;s almost as if our souls</text>
  <text start="541.46" dur="5.44">incarnated into these bodies on this</text>
  <text start="544.53" dur="5.55">earth to each have our own hero&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.9" dur="5.67">journey do you see now</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="4.62">not only does this hero&amp;#39;s journey apply</text>
  <text start="552.57" dur="8.13">to us individually and can very well</text>
  <text start="554.7" dur="8.55">help us find ourselves but it can it as</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="5.76">with that law of Correspondence as above</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="4.74">so below concept right it also allows us</text>
  <text start="566.46" dur="5.55">to see what&amp;#39;s happening on a global</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="6.75">scale and globally what&amp;#39;s going on is</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="5.22">that humanity is going through that dark</text>
  <text start="574.74" dur="4.44">night of the soul right now it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="577.23" dur="5.46">obvious if you just turn on the TV or</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="5.25">look online that things are crazy things</text>
  <text start="582.69" dur="3.81">are insane out there and so many people</text>
  <text start="584.43" dur="4.98">are having so much internal tension and</text>
  <text start="586.5" dur="4.68">things are so insane because of this</text>
  <text start="589.41" dur="5.61">dark night of the soul work work going</text>
  <text start="591.18" dur="5.52">on and let&amp;#39;s just I mean we&amp;#39;ll quickly</text>
  <text start="595.02" dur="4.04">it&amp;#39;s already a ten minute video but I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="596.7" dur="7.5">summarize it quick here</text>
  <text start="599.06" dur="7.96">humanity is right it&amp;#39;s balls deep in its</text>
  <text start="604.2" dur="4.59">own hero&amp;#39;s journey we&amp;#39;ve had the call to</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="4.62">action what was the call to action for</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="5.82">all of us collectively it was realizing</text>
  <text start="611.64" dur="5.31">that oh my god there is a power-hungry</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="4.26">group that&amp;#39;s at the very top of the</text>
  <text start="616.95" dur="4.5">totem pole that&amp;#39;s completely controlling</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="4.77">the planet this call to action occurs</text>
  <text start="621.45" dur="5.7">there&amp;#39;s the refusal right the refusal is</text>
  <text start="623.64" dur="6.09">that ego not wanting to see the darkness</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="4.11">that refusal is literally people put in</text>
  <text start="629.73" dur="2.96">their head down acting like an ostrich</text>
  <text start="631.26" dur="5.39">with their head in the sand</text>
  <text start="632.69" dur="6.64">the mentors come along the mentors to</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="4.54">humanity collectively is all of those</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="5.46">that have come to us to speak their</text>
  <text start="641.19" dur="7.26">truths Bruce Lee Nikola Tesla Jesus</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="5.76">George Carlin John Lennon right usually</text>
  <text start="648.45" dur="5.79">the ones that the powers that be like to</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="6.9">off but could be any of them they were</text>
  <text start="654.24" dur="7.83">all mentors that incarnated here to help</text>
  <text start="657.45" dur="8.94">us collectively grow those mentors are</text>
  <text start="662.07" dur="5.67">spurring that threshold of us to cross</text>
  <text start="666.39" dur="2.97">right many of us have already</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="3.48">across that threshold and where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="669.36" dur="3.75">doing the work necessary to help free</text>
  <text start="671.22" dur="5.25">our fellow man which is what I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="673.11" dur="5.7">with these videos and where we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="676.47" dur="4.89">through that battle we are obviously</text>

  <text start="681.36" dur="7.98">facing in this world but we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="685.7" dur="8.53">we&amp;#39;re also finding many allies and our</text>

  <text start="704.28" dur="3.54">finding each other in this process so</text>
  <text start="705.81" dur="5.58">thanks to YouTube for helping me find</text>
  <text start="707.82" dur="5.34">you guys and then after this we are what</text>
  <text start="711.39" dur="3.15">we are currently going on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="713.16" dur="6.24">currently going on right now is that</text>
  <text start="714.54" dur="7.35">dark night of the soul and the big thing</text>
  <text start="719.4" dur="4.89">to note that what I want to finish this</text>
  <text start="721.89" dur="3.9">video with is with this dark night of</text>
  <text start="724.29" dur="5.76">the soul that we&amp;#39;re collectively going</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="7.98">on with we have to face that darkness we</text>
  <text start="730.05" dur="7.2">have to face the bad stuff that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="733.77" dur="6.5">on on this world to transmute that right</text>
  <text start="737.25" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s a common fallacy it&amp;#39;s a common</text>
  <text start="740.27" dur="5.44"> in New Age ideology and</text>
  <text start="743.13" dur="3.72">dogmatic religion is that you know we</text>
  <text start="745.71" dur="2.49">don&amp;#39;t want to look at the darkness we</text>
  <text start="746.85" dur="2.91">just have to focus on the positive</text>
  <text start="748.2" dur="3.38">focusing on the positive is all we need</text>
  <text start="749.76" dur="5.52">to do to save you know save ourselves</text>
  <text start="751.58" dur="7.21">that&amp;#39;s BS in my opinion because you need</text>
  <text start="755.28" dur="5.01">a darkness you need that to catalyze you</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="3.33">to come to consciousness without</text>
  <text start="760.29" dur="3.75">darkness you can&amp;#39;t have light so you</text>
  <text start="762.12" dur="4.77">cannot avoid the darkness you have to</text>
  <text start="764.04" dur="7.26">face it - then transcend that duality</text>
  <text start="766.89" dur="7.56">you see and the cool thing is and in all</text>
  <text start="771.3" dur="7.91">honesty there is so much darkness on</text>
  <text start="774.45" dur="7.56">this planet which is scary you know but</text>
  <text start="779.21" dur="4.36">it&amp;#39;s a very very good thing that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="782.01" dur="3.99">so much darkness on this planet because</text>
  <text start="783.57" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s going to have such a catalyst to</text>
  <text start="786" dur="4.14">have such an amazing ascension process</text>
  <text start="788.01" dur="5.31">once that darkness is fully realized</text>
  <text start="790.14" dur="4.56">right so the more darkness there is then</text>
  <text start="793.32" dur="3.78">to catalyze you to have more light if</text>
  <text start="794.7" dur="4.89">there wasn&amp;#39;t is such you know if it</text>
  <text start="797.1" dur="4.71">wasn&amp;#39;t such low it what if it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="799.59" dur="4.679">such a low vibratory plane we were here</text>
  <text start="801.81" dur="5.969">we wouldn&amp;#39;t have that catalyzation to</text>
  <text start="804.269" dur="6.391">such a grand ascension so I that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="807.779" dur="5.281">point that I&amp;#39;m making right here is look</text>
  <text start="810.66" dur="4.589">at the darkness but don&amp;#39;t fear it you</text>
  <text start="813.06" dur="6.99">should be grateful for it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="815.249" dur="6.9">going to make us collectively have such</text>
  <text start="820.05" dur="7.349">a wonderful awakening experience</text>
