  <text start="85.65" dur="4.98">one of over 60 compounds that&amp;#39;s found in</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="5.1">cannabis that belongs to a class of</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="5.309">ingredients called cannabinoids one of</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="5.269">the most famous cannabinoids there is is</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="6.211">THC and THC of course is the</text>
  <text start="98.869" dur="6.28">mind-altering component of marijuana</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="5.579">that marijuana is most famous for but</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="7.351">CBDs don&amp;#39;t have any kind of</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="6.511">mind-altering effects and many strains</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="5.579">of common cannabis you can get out there</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="6.9">have very high THC very low CBD some</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="4.561">strains have very high of both but in</text>

  <text start="122.64" dur="5.39">guys it&amp;#39;s actually specific C V DS and</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="4.08">the thing about CBD Zoar these</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="5.3">cannabinoids is that they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="7.211">illegal to be so a bot and soul</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="6.24">in 49 states so since these CBDs don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.59" dur="5.46">really have anything to do with the</text>
  <text start="139.57" dur="6.72">mind-altering THC the legality of it is</text>
  <text start="143.05" dur="5.91">much more lenient than THC granted we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="5.34">seeing marijuana being legalized in</text>
  <text start="148.96" dur="4.86">states pretty much every year now around</text>
  <text start="151.63" dur="3.93">the country Richard which is great you</text>
  <text start="153.82" dur="3.9">know I&amp;#39;m all for that kind of freedom</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="4.71">but with CBDs there&amp;#39;s much more freedom</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="4.62">to it and it goes to be known here</text>
  <text start="160.27" dur="2.85">Stevie DS will not make you pop on a</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="2.91">drug test</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s what THC will do so you can</text>
  <text start="165.25" dur="6.27">safely take CBDs even if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="168.46" dur="5.97">federal government worker or a kind of</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="6.24">professional that is trying to avoid the</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="6.44">mind altering THC but now let&amp;#39;s go into</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="8.13">some of the studies that dr. axe</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="8.26">discusses in this article here and how</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="6.03">is the CBDs have actually been shown</text>
  <text start="189.13" dur="4.94">right here in a 2013 study published by</text>
  <text start="191.92" dur="5.55">the british journal of clinical</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="5.169">pharmacology CVD benefits include acting</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="4.47">in some experimental models as an</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="6.75">anti-inflammatory antioxidant</text>
  <text start="201.94" dur="6.42">anticonvulsant an actual anti-psychotic</text>
  <text start="205.989" dur="4.051">agent and therefore is a potential</text>
  <text start="208.36" dur="3.96">medicine for the treatment of neuro</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="7.65">inflammation or inflammation of the</text>
  <text start="212.32" dur="7.77">brain epilepsy vomiting nausea anxiety</text>
  <text start="217.69" dur="6.299">and schizophrenia these are just a few</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="5.7">things that CBDs may help right here it</text>
  <text start="223.989" dur="5.011">says research is beginning to show that</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="5.13">CBD is different than other well studied</text>
  <text start="229" dur="5.13">cannabinoids because remember there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="6.599">many many different cannabinoids CBD</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="5.1">specifically can act as ligands meaning</text>
  <text start="237.519" dur="3.811">they dock onto the binding side of a</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="5.19">protein and have the ability to modulate</text>
  <text start="241.33" dur="7.8">a receptors behavior and in your body</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="6.9">you actually have various receptors for</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="3.98">cannabinoids let&amp;#39;s talk about that for a</text>
  <text start="251.32" dur="3.63">sec here let&amp;#39;s go talk about the</text>
  <text start="253.11" dur="4.57">endocannabinoid system and I&amp;#39;m show you</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="6.12">this picture here so in your body your</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="7.58">your nervous system is actually set up</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="6.06">with receptors specifically to bind with</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="2.8">cannabinoid</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="6.63">endocannabinoids system I want to note</text>
  <text start="271" dur="7.38">here really quick just for consciousness</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="6.93">sake information sake that cannabis is</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="5.43">not the only plant that contains</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="5.07">cannabinoids in nature there&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="4.95">a my rat of plants that do for instance</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="3.84">echinacea you may be familiar with</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="5.37">echinacea is a plant that contains</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="5.19">cannabinoids so you can get cannabinoids</text>
  <text start="294.13" dur="3.45">from all kinds of different sort of</text>
  <text start="295.72" dur="5.25">different sources but the cannabis plant</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="6.12">is called cannabis because it has so</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="7.2">many cannabinoids in there remember is</text>
  <text start="303.7" dur="6.81">dr. Josh axe said it has CBD is one over</text>
  <text start="308.17" dur="5.34">sixty compounds found in cannabis that</text>
  <text start="310.51" dur="5.88">are cannabinoids so cannabis has a load</text>
  <text start="313.51" dur="5.4">of cannabinoids and your body has a</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="5.37">receptor system directly set up for it</text>
  <text start="318.91" dur="4.44">the cb1 receptors are concentrated in</text>
  <text start="321.76" dur="4.62">your brain and in your nervous system</text>
  <text start="323.35" dur="6.18">and then you have what&amp;#39;s called cb2</text>
  <text start="326.38" dur="6.06">receptors which are mostly in the</text>
  <text start="329.53" dur="4.89">peripheral organs and especially in the</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="4.14">cells associated with the immune system</text>
  <text start="334.42" dur="5.1">so your nervous system in your immune</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="4.53">system are very intricately linked it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.52" dur="3.93">not a conversation we&amp;#39;ll have here as we</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="5.04">talk about that quite a bit but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.45" dur="4.89">very linked and they go hand-in-hand so</text>
  <text start="346.15" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s why both your nervous system and</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="3.8">your immune system have these</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="5.22">cannabinoid receptors that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="352.14" dur="5.71">cannabinoids can be so good for your</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="4.47">brain and also for inflammation because</text>
  <text start="357.85" dur="4.32">they work so well with your immune</text>
  <text start="359.62" dur="5.79">system so here&amp;#39;s some proven benefits</text>
  <text start="362.17" dur="6.51">back to this dr. Josh axe article of CBD</text>
  <text start="365.41" dur="4.26">it helps to relieve plane and</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="5.01">inflammation</text>
  <text start="369.67" dur="6.87">a 2007 meta-analysis conducted in Canada</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="5.07">shows like we said earlier it has</text>
  <text start="376.54" dur="6.27">antipsychotic effects it can reduce</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="6.36">anxiety they can even help fight cancer</text>
  <text start="382.81" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s been shown by a few studies here</text>
  <text start="385.12" dur="6.63">and there&amp;#39;s a whole lot more effects</text>
  <text start="389.17" dur="4.23">that these DVDs can have so I&amp;#39;ll link</text>
