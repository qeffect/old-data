  <text start="94.88" dur="6.96">extra-terrestrial visitors that is quite</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="5.61">the line to lead into this article with</text>
  <text start="101.84" dur="5.62">moving on the idea is that launching the</text>
  <text start="105" dur="4.04">space force will be a big step towards</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="4.14">the government&amp;#39;s acknowledgement of</text>

  <text start="133.41" dur="5.88">out there into the public as opposed to</text>
  <text start="136.08" dur="4.26">what&amp;#39;s a partial disclosure interesting</text>
  <text start="139.29" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ll talk about that a little bit more</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="5.37">in the article now third paragraph it</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="5.61">says making it all the more real the</text>

  <text start="258.06" dur="6.48">long time ago somebody somewhere either</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="5.189">must have had these tweets saved to be</text>
  <text start="264.54" dur="3.959">used in a situation like this or they</text>

  <text start="282.509" dur="7.051">smear piece now goes to note here I mean</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="5.62">when talking about these sorts of</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="5.939">subjects subjects that are often</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="5.369">ridiculed or hard-hitting truths that</text>
  <text start="295.499" dur="4.38">people might not normally believe if</text>
  <text start="297.419" dur="4.411">you&amp;#39;re gonna have a mainstream outlet</text>
  <text start="299.879" dur="3.69">report on these it&amp;#39;s a very fine line</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="3.57">that they&amp;#39;re gonna have to walk they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.569" dur="4.201">gonna have to pander to a mainstream</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="4.769">audience somewhat so when I see the</text>

  <text start="322.169" dur="6.451">topics right so I&amp;#39;m really wondering</text>
  <text start="325.819" dur="4.57">what the motive behind this article was</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="5.069">and remember how I said it was written</text>

  <text start="645.279" dur="4.35">filler paragraph between the first half</text>
  <text start="647.8" dur="3.019">of this article in the second half but I</text>
  <text start="649.629" dur="3.57">mean</text>
  <text start="650.819" dur="4.63">there&amp;#39;s plenty of evidence for this if</text>
  <text start="653.199" dur="5.341">you go read dr. Saul as books there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="655.449" dur="5.88">huge amount of research around this</text>

  <text start="684.539" dur="8.2">behind the lines that they&amp;#39;re writing in</text>
  <text start="689.169" dur="5.22">this article but it&amp;#39;s stunning to see</text>
  <text start="692.739" dur="4.38">this in the mainstream start to</text>
  <text start="694.389" dur="4.64">breakthrough now moving on into the</text>
  <text start="697.119" dur="4.56">latter half the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="699.029" dur="5.26">described space force as a military</text>

  <text start="704.289" dur="4.14">in space such as satellites and fending</text>
  <text start="706.569" dur="4.2">off cyberattacks so now they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="708.429" dur="4.08">into more of a mainstream understanding</text>
  <text start="710.769" dur="5.19">of the space force to reiterate that to</text>
  <text start="712.509" dur="5.04">their reader as I&amp;#39;ve often said when it</text>
  <text start="715.959" dur="3.391">comes to secret space programs and what</text>
  <text start="717.549" dur="4.95">we actually have in space it goes far</text>
  <text start="719.35" dur="5.299">beyond satellites and small craft like</text>
  <text start="722.499" dur="5.13">that as this article stated earlier</text>

  <text start="732.699" dur="2.61">pandering to the mainstream audience</text>
  <text start="733.659" dur="3.93">here kind of reading at to the readers</text>
  <text start="735.309" dur="3.84">the Defense Department for years warned</text>

  <text start="757.209" dur="6.03">has had some Opposition in being created</text>
  <text start="759.909" dur="4.95">so I like that they&amp;#39;re doing that at</text>
  <text start="763.239" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re selling the idea of the space</text>

  <text start="843.519" dur="4.951">Defense Department program that for at</text>
  <text start="845.86" dur="5.129">least five years investigated UFOs the</text>
  <text start="848.47" dur="4.079">program allegedly shut down in 2012 but</text>
  <text start="850.989" dur="4.111">officials said they continue to</text>
  <text start="852.549" dur="4.95">investigate UFO episodes so now we get</text>
  <text start="855.1" dur="4.829">into a little bit of the idea of full</text>
  <text start="857.499" dur="4.5">disclosure it&amp;#39;s very important that they</text>
  <text start="859.929" dur="3.59">put that in quotations and mention that</text>
  <text start="861.999" dur="3.93">at the beginning of this article is</text>
  <text start="863.519" dur="4.54">because when it comes to that New York</text>
  <text start="865.929" dur="6.57">Times report revealing the secret DoD</text>
  <text start="868.059" dur="7.08">program that and much more work I will</text>
  <text start="872.499" dur="5.31">do in the very near future discussing</text>
  <text start="875.139" dur="5.04">all of this that as I said before is</text>
  <text start="877.809" dur="5.34">what we could term as a limited hangout</text>
  <text start="880.179" dur="5.301">program a partial disclosure a half</text>

  <text start="885.48" dur="7.089">minuscule percentage of disclosure to</text>
  <text start="888.279" dur="6.331">distract the public to give them chunk</text>
  <text start="892.569" dur="4.83">something shiny to look at while they</text>
  <text start="894.61" dur="5.88">brushed the rest of their corruption and</text>
  <text start="897.399" dur="5.28">crimes the deep state under the rug so</text>
  <text start="900.49" dur="3.99">very intriguing that they&amp;#39;re featuring</text>
  <text start="902.679" dur="3.66">dr. Saleh at the beginning of this</text>
  <text start="904.48" dur="4.169">article outlined full disclosure and</text>
  <text start="906.339" dur="3.66">then going into a little bit of the</text>
  <text start="908.649" dur="3.36">partial disclosure of course this</text>
  <text start="909.999" dur="4.95">article doesn&amp;#39;t mention that but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="912.009" dur="5.25">somewhat kind of subconsciously puts</text>
  <text start="914.949" dur="4.411">that out there and this New York Times</text>
  <text start="917.259" dur="5.82">report that reveal the secret DoD</text>
  <text start="919.36" dur="6.18">program a little bit of dots to connect</text>
  <text start="923.079" dur="3.6">there very briefly again I&amp;#39;ll do much</text>
  <text start="925.54" dur="3.93">more work on this in the future but that</text>
  <text start="926.679" dur="7.081">DoD report some of the names involved in</text>
  <text start="929.47" dur="6.809">that Harry Reid John Podesta</text>

  <text start="936.279" dur="7.62">Academy promoting this DoD program just</text>
  <text start="941.14" dur="4.949">a lot of questionable individuals so</text>
  <text start="943.899" dur="4.141">again what&amp;#39;s the motive behind this New</text>
  <text start="946.089" dur="4.261">York Times report that came out and that</text>
  <text start="948.04" dur="3.93">DoD program and it actually wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="4.14">secret at all that was never officially</text>
  <text start="951.97" dur="4.7">classified it&amp;#39;s as if they created that</text>
  <text start="954.49" dur="5.31">program ran it for five years and</text>
  <text start="956.67" dur="4.57">purposefully left it Declassified so</text>
  <text start="959.8" dur="6.15">they could bring it out to the public in</text>
  <text start="961.24" dur="6.39">the future as they did right amazing</text>
  <text start="965.95" dur="4.17">stuff when you begin to piece it all</text>
  <text start="967.63" dur="3.93">together there is also abundant evidence</text>
  <text start="970.12" dur="3.57">that the Pentagon has top-secret</text>
  <text start="971.56" dur="4.5">operations in space such as spy</text>
  <text start="973.69" dur="3.75">satellites satellites okay</text>
  <text start="976.06" dur="3.48">we know that of course there&amp;#39;s secret</text>

  <text start="1009.51" dur="2.97">here I don&amp;#39;t really think the space</text>
  <text start="1010.829" dur="3.061">Force has anything to do with ETS or</text>
  <text start="1012.48" dur="3.57">aliens I know people are thinking it</text>
  <text start="1013.89" dur="4.23">does my personal opinion is that it is</text>
  <text start="1016.05" dur="3.45">just that all the pieces of our military</text>
  <text start="1018.12" dur="3.27">doing the same thing and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1019.5" dur="4.32">probably some benefit of putting it all</text>
  <text start="1021.39" dur="3.99">under one head mr. Carson doubted the</text>
  <text start="1023.82" dur="3.57">government was getting closer to quote</text>
  <text start="1025.38" dur="3.6">full disclosure of what he believes the</text>
  <text start="1027.39" dur="3.15">government hides about aliens I do</text>
  <text start="1028.98" dur="2.64">believe that we have technology which</text>
  <text start="1030.54" dur="3.36">has been reverse-engineered from</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="3.809">aircraft that are not from here and that</text>
  <text start="1033.9" dur="3.75">we are probably using that technology</text>
  <text start="1035.429" dur="3.9">someplace but are we trolling out</text>
  <text start="1037.65" dur="3.45">amongst the stars like Star Trek or</text>
  <text start="1039.329" dur="3.931">something else I don&amp;#39;t know that it has</text>
  <text start="1041.1" dur="3.359">gotten that far he said and to finish up</text>
  <text start="1043.26" dur="3.24">in the article then I&amp;#39;ll give you my</text>
  <text start="1044.459" dur="4.131">final notes does mr. Trump know the</text>
  <text start="1046.5" dur="4.59">truth about extraterrestrial visitors</text>
  <text start="1048.59" dur="4.24">Washington Times wrote I would be</text>
  <text start="1051.09" dur="4.079">shocked if the president was not briefed</text>
  <text start="1052.83" dur="3.39">mr. Carson said how much they tell him I</text>
  <text start="1055.169" dur="3.861">have no clue</text>
  <text start="1056.22" dur="5.699">so in finishing up some comments about</text>
  <text start="1059.03" dur="7.7">mutual UFO network MUFON and Carson&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1061.919" dur="9.071">comments here so what I find intriguing</text>
  <text start="1066.73" dur="6.3">is that harson is kind of brushing this</text>
  <text start="1070.99" dur="3.63">under the rug a little bit he&amp;#39;s saying I</text>
  <text start="1073.03" dur="5.639">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s gotten that far he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1074.62" dur="8.52">kind of putting some plausible denying</text>
  <text start="1078.669" dur="7.26">you know but I find it intriguing that</text>
  <text start="1083.14" dur="5.7">literally last year in 2017 the MUFON</text>
  <text start="1085.929" dur="5.971">symposium the yearly big ol conference</text>
  <text start="1088.84" dur="5.55">that MUFON throws was on the secret</text>
  <text start="1091.9" dur="5.64">space program that was the topic of it</text>
  <text start="1094.39" dur="5.43">they had speakers like Corey Goode and</text>
  <text start="1097.54" dur="3.75">William Tompkins especially I sat front</text>
  <text start="1099.82" dur="3.42">row and watched William Tompkins he was</text>
  <text start="1101.29" dur="4.769">their keynote speaker there William</text>
  <text start="1103.24" dur="4.11">Tompkins according to this testimony he</text>
  <text start="1106.059" dur="3.691">used to work in many of these secret</text>
  <text start="1107.35" dur="4.59">think tanks he&amp;#39;s designed the initial</text>
  <text start="1109.75" dur="4.98">stages of the space craft for that Navy</text>
  <text start="1111.94" dur="5.28">solar warden program why would MUFON</text>
  <text start="1114.73" dur="4.199">have a symposium dedicated to the secret</text>
  <text start="1117.22" dur="3.75">space program with William Tompkins</text>
  <text start="1118.929" dur="6.091">being their keynote speaker they also</text>
  <text start="1120.97" dur="5.43">had gary mckinnon he Skyped in he</text>
  <text start="1125.02" dur="4.02">patched himself in because he still</text>
  <text start="1126.4" dur="5.24">lives over in the UK he hacked NASA</text>
  <text start="1129.04" dur="5.129">computers back in the year 2000 and</text>
  <text start="1131.64" dur="5.38">found evidence of that solar warden</text>
  <text start="1134.169" dur="4.111">secret Navy space program so why would</text>
  <text start="1137.02" dur="2.37">they have a whole symposium and all</text>
  <text start="1138.28" dur="3.3">these speakers talking about all these</text>
  <text start="1139.39" dur="4.74">things for Hudson to kind of brush</text>
  <text start="1141.58" dur="4.17">another rug and what&amp;#39;s also interesting</text>
  <text start="1144.13" dur="6.21">to note is that MUFON the mutual UFO</text>
  <text start="1145.75" dur="6.78">network they have a lot of ties a lot of</text>
  <text start="1150.34" dur="5.7">connections to a corporation called</text>
  <text start="1152.53" dur="5.85">Bigelow Aerospace a corporation&amp;#39;s run by</text>
  <text start="1156.04" dur="4.65">billionaire Robert Bigelow what else has</text>
  <text start="1158.38" dur="5.52">Robert Bigelow done in the UFO realm</text>
  <text start="1160.69" dur="6.21">well actually Bigelow Aerospace was the</text>
  <text start="1163.9" dur="6.32">main contractor for that DoD program</text>
  <text start="1166.9" dur="5.97">that the New York Times broke last year</text>
  <text start="1170.22" dur="5.709">Harry Reid was the one that initiated</text>
  <text start="1172.87" dur="4.5">that program back in 2007 and then</text>
  <text start="1175.929" dur="4.951">Bigelow Aerospace was the main</text>
  <text start="1177.37" dur="5.67">contractor so what&amp;#39;s MUFON angle here is</text>
  <text start="1180.88" dur="5.1">MUFON purposely trying to brush a lot of</text>
  <text start="1183.04" dur="5.58">this under the rug what is this limited</text>
  <text start="1185.98" dur="4.56">hangout disclosure operation that the</text>
  <text start="1188.62" dur="6.63">New York Times reported on and revealed</text>
  <text start="1190.54" dur="8.609">about the atyp advanced aerial threat</text>
  <text start="1195.25" dur="5.789">identification program hmm again</text>
  <text start="1199.149" dur="3.811">this is good stuff a lot more in the</text>
