  <text start="26.16" dur="3.48">concepts are very important to</text>
  <text start="28.02" dur="4.55">understand to make sure we don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="29.64" dur="5.76">duped by the dark forces yet again and</text>
  <text start="32.57" dur="8.65">what I mean by that is enough with the</text>
  <text start="35.4" dur="8.1">new Hipps is that there&amp;#39;s this idea now</text>
  <text start="41.22" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s not just new agey it&amp;#39;s I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="2.88">found in a religion it&amp;#39;s found just kind</text>
  <text start="44.88" dur="2.52">of in society in general and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="46.38" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;m making this video because I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="47.4" dur="6.36">it a lot and it&amp;#39;s not hippy right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="51.93" dur="3.24">just it&amp;#39;s just a good was so funny way I</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="3.45">described it because I&amp;#39;m totally hippie</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="3.3">I eat all organic food and do things as</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="3.03">natural as I can what they would call</text>
  <text start="58.47" dur="2.94">like crunchy I guess I&amp;#39;m on the west</text>
  <text start="60.24" dur="2.67">coast I&amp;#39;ve never heard that over here</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="5.069">but I hear it from East Coasters a lot</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="5.31">of ecology but New Age hippie BS what</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="4.861">that basically means is that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="4.59">people that go oh just focus on the</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="3.629">positive that&amp;#39;s all you need to think</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="3.54">about right use the law of attraction</text>
  <text start="74.969" dur="2.94">and just focus on the happy blissful</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="3.39">thoughts and that&amp;#39;s what the universe is</text>
  <text start="77.909" dur="3.99">going to give you don&amp;#39;t focus on</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="4.86">anything negative anything bad anything</text>
  <text start="81.899" dur="7.08">dark just think happy thoughts and that</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="6.659">will come to you and that itself is BS</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="6.09">and I&amp;#39;m going to tell you why is because</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="6.481">that&amp;#39;s exactly how the powers that be or</text>
  <text start="95.069" dur="4.44">the Cabal or whatever name deep state</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="3.36">you want to give them that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="99.509" dur="3.99">want you thinking because if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="6.059">look at the negative it&amp;#39;s never gonna go</text>
  <text start="103.499" dur="5.58">away it&amp;#39;s not gonna get remedied if you</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t pay any attention to it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="109.079" dur="4.261">want you paying attention to it so then</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="3.121">they can act like the puppet master</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="3.75">behind the scenes with the strings</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="5.97">messing with your subconscious because</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="5.129">they&amp;#39;re still there and I mean think</text>
  <text start="120.78" dur="3.21">about it just like Martin Luther King</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="3.271">said right the only way or I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="3">paraphrasing but the only way to get rid</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="2.61">of the dark is to shine the light at it</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="3.12">you know like the candle and dark the</text>
  <text start="128.1" dur="5.88">only way to get rid of it is to deal</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="5.52">with it so this idea that you know you</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s not even how the law of</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="3.59">attraction really works they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="5.34">understand these natural cosmic laws</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="4.48">talk about that a minute actually</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="2.759">they&amp;#39;re just focusing on all this</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="3.36">blissful stuff and it still letting the</text>
  <text start="145.319" dur="5.701">dark live it&amp;#39;s something dark do their</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="7.77">stuff not good so this idea it needs to</text>
  <text start="151.02" dur="5.82">go away we must see what the dark is</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="4.89">doing in the negative to transmute that</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="5.72">to transform then it that is that is</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="4.86">spiritual alchemy in and of itself is</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.12">going through that dark night as the</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="4.02">soul is dealing with that negativity is</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="6.15">looking at it and then exposing it</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="8.79">talking about it discussing it then only</text>
  <text start="172.83" dur="6.78">then can you get rid of it and I mean</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="4.14">talking about spiritual alchemy right</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="4.23">here I&amp;#39;m actually reading where is it</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="3.6">saying right here this book some of</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="3.899">y&amp;#39;all might know this book it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="4.939">the chi chi belong at chi valley and</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="4.741">kaiba lien kaiba lion</text>
  <text start="190.069" dur="5.741">however you say it but what it deals</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="5.16">with is what&amp;#39;s called ancient hermetic</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="3.509">philosophy hermetic philosophy is like</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s like an archetype or a pattern</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="5.311">that&amp;#39;s found through like all all</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="5.55">religion all even science even I mean</text>
  <text start="204.63" dur="7.05">it&amp;#39;s fantastic work but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a cult</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="6.84">it&amp;#39;s deep occult wisdom and what one of</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="4.589">the cosmic laws in there is the natural</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="6.019">laws is that it&amp;#39;s called the law of</text>
  <text start="216.269" dur="7.411">polarity and when you really begin to</text>
  <text start="219.799" dur="6.131">understand I mean we live in a plane</text>
  <text start="223.68" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s called duality consciousness and</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="4.44">that means you have to have both duality</text>
  <text start="229.32" dur="3.18">consciousness that is the law of</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="4.44">polarity you have to have the poles you</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="3.959">have to have the light to understand the</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="4.799">dark you have to have left to understand</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="5.731">right see what I&amp;#39;m saying and if you</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="4.741">don&amp;#39;t have them both you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="4.049">have any type of consciousness you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="8.13">not gonna understand what good feelings</text>
  <text start="246.239" dur="8.37">are without the dark and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="4.02">so amazing I mean honestly about being</text>
  <text start="254.609" dur="4.41">at on this planet at this point in time</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="5.91">is that this planet has such a low</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="6.421">vibratory plane it it&amp;#39;s so dark and</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="4.83">dense deep that once we&amp;#39;re able to face</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.86">all that darkness that&amp;#39;s coming to light</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="5.46">right now in these times of disclosure</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.619">and the age of information we&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="3.42">look at that darkness and then once we</text>
  <text start="274.919" dur="3.361">collectively do</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="3.81">with it oh my gosh they&amp;#39;re wonderful</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="4.44">times that are ahead that&amp;#39;s why whatever</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="4.59">I talk to people about the darkness I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="4.14">like yeah look look at this this is the</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="4.05">reality of the situation but this is</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="3.72">what we can get when we deal with that</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="3.81">do you want free energy do you want</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="3.54">cures for disease do you want to end</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="3.33">poverty world hunger and travel amongst</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="2.85">the stars well we got a look at the</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="3.45">assholes that are on this planet right</text>
  <text start="296.97" dur="2.97">now they&amp;#39;re keeping that from us it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="3.09">the only way to get it</text>
  <text start="299.94" dur="4.289">so that&amp;#39;s why you need to you need to</text>
  <text start="302.25" dur="4.85">look at the darkness and understand that</text>
  <text start="304.229" dur="6.301">it&amp;#39;s what makes you feel so damn good</text>
  <text start="307.1" dur="5.02">darkness itself is good it&amp;#39;s bad but</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="2.639">it&amp;#39;s also good at the same time because</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s letting you know how good good</text>
  <text start="313.169" dur="5.161">feels good is bad good I mean what I</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="3.72">should say is good is good but good can</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="3.27">also be bad because if you&amp;#39;re focusing</text>
  <text start="320.19" dur="3.449">on the good all the freaking time you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.6" dur="4.97">not gonna it&amp;#39;s just gonna get mundane</text>
  <text start="323.639" dur="5.701">and lame and you&amp;#39;ll have nothing to -</text>
  <text start="326.57" dur="5.02">you know contrast that with you need the</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="3.72">contrast so I&amp;#39;m saying here it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="3.69">called the law of paradox which is also</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="5.46">in the Chi Bali and they&amp;#39;re discussing</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="4.83">you know bad is good and bad good is</text>
  <text start="338.52" dur="3">good and bad it&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="340.11" dur="4.32">perspective it&amp;#39;s all relative it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="4.35">relative truth so very interesting the</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="3">law of polarity and law paradox there</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="3.75">but it ties into this New Age hippie</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="4.35"> issue in that you need to look</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="4.68">at the darkness darkness is good it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="4.8">bad is good but you need to look at it</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="3.929">and then once we do look at it and we</text>
  <text start="356.58" dur="5.01">transmute that we transform that then we</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="6.12">get all of the fun stuff afterwards so</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s the point of this video don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="364.349" dur="5.701">look away from the darkness I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="5.43">scary take baby steps if you need to but</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="4.17">you have to do it you must do it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="4.76">what we need to do here that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="374.22" dur="5.34">are all here on this planet at this time</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="3.759">to not screw things up this time because</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="5.13">I believe that we&amp;#39;ve been through many</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="5.731">cycles of this before as humanity in the</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="4.409">past and it&amp;#39;s really up to us to get it</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="4.32">right this time so that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="3.901">putting this concept out there so we can</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="5.91">all get it right anyway thank you guys</text>
  <text start="393" dur="5.729">for watching I&amp;#39;m sorry if I caused any</text>
  <text start="396.69" dur="4.65">internal tension with my passion and</text>
  <text start="398.729" dur="5.581">intensity with this issue or if I</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="4.77">brushed you know major ego a little</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="3.359">queasy in there but that&amp;#39;s kind of what</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="3.119">I do I find that line and I like to</text>
  <text start="407.669" dur="2.311">deliberately cross it so we can make</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="3.091">sure that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="4.44">not being controlled by our egos and we</text>
  <text start="412.32" dur="4.77">are in fact doing the ones controlling</text>
  <text start="414.42" dur="3.99">it so anyway thank you guys thanks for</text>
