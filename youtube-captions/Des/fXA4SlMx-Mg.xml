  <text start="0.03" dur="4.95">yo guys what&amp;#39;s up so yesterday morning I</text>
  <text start="3.21" dur="3.72">uploaded my video on The Comedy Central</text>
  <text start="4.98" dur="4.199">situation just trying to be as clear and</text>
  <text start="6.93" dur="6.06">concise as I could about what really</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="6.151">went on why what did it etc etc and as I</text>
  <text start="12.99" dur="3.81">saw the comments start to roll in the</text>
  <text start="15.33" dur="3.27">fallout ensue</text>
  <text start="16.8" dur="3.78">I read them and there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="18.6" dur="3.99">positive ones people voicing their</text>
  <text start="20.58" dur="5.279">support and understanding thank you very</text>
  <text start="22.59" dur="4.89">much but there was also as expected a</text>
  <text start="25.859" dur="5.01">lot of shade thrown my way</text>
  <text start="27.48" dur="6.78">negative feedback now mind you I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="30.869" dur="5.341">aware of the online troll paid accounts</text>
  <text start="34.26" dur="4.11">but there seems to be some</text>
  <text start="36.21" dur="5.25">well-intentioned people that were just</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="5.33">confused or basing their opinions off</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="4.32">some kind of false assumption and</text>
  <text start="43.7" dur="3.91">throwing some shade my way for it so</text>
  <text start="45.78" dur="5.25">what this video is gonna be is a</text>
  <text start="47.61" dur="5.16">response to the responses now this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="3.599">me being triggered I&amp;#39;ve always been one</text>
  <text start="52.77" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s very in control my emotion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.629" dur="4.41">very easy for me to detach with what I</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="5.25">see on the internet but again I just</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="6.721">want this to be as clear and concise as</text>
  <text start="61.8" dur="5.4">possible so no matter what Comedy</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="4.08">Central decides to do with the material</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="5.07">or no matter what this person says or</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="4.319">that person says you can get it all</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="4.08">straight from the source</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="5.64">and understand my intentions behind</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="6.21">everything so there were five particular</text>
  <text start="79.799" dur="4.261">threads of thought that I saw five</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="3.059">things I kept seeing repeated over and</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.01">over again that I&amp;#39;m going to address</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="5.581">here and number one I kept seeing people</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="4.17">say Jordan they&amp;#39;re just gonna ridicule</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="3.69">you don&amp;#39;t you know that they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="3.03">trying to make you look like a fool</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="3.869">you&amp;#39;re just going into enemy territory</text>
  <text start="96.27" dur="5.22">doing this I kept seeing enemy territory</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="6.36">people you said that and my answer to</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="8.22">that is well obviously I do know that</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="7.14">you know I&amp;#39;m not naive I&amp;#39;m hopeful but</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="4.71">I&amp;#39;m not naive and I&amp;#39;m fully aware that</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="5.25">Comedy Central now has the opportunity</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="7.949">to do whatever they want with this</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="7.051">material but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="4.081">already know how they&amp;#39;re going to do it</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="3.72">right how they&amp;#39;re gonna go about it so</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;m hoping for the best</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="4.89">hoping for the best and expecting the</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.69">worst with this situation again even if</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="2.94">they do</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.46">decide to edit this up to try and roast</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="5.61">us and ridicule and a rag on everything</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="6.45">what&amp;#39;s that going to do it&amp;#39;s only gonna</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="7.14">backfire so get that and not only that</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="6.69">but they would have done this with or</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="6.9">without me right so why not use this</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="8.43">opportunity to go down there and explain</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="7.23">cue articulately as best I can and not</text>
  <text start="160.8" dur="4.17">only talk about cue but you guys know me</text>
  <text start="162.99" dur="4.47">I talk about so many other things as</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="4.44">well and I did talk about those things I</text>
  <text start="167.46" dur="3.24">brought up pharmaceutical corruption I</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="3.24">brought up the Gerson Therapy</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="4.5">I brought up a mess I brought up free</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="5.22">energy I brought up Antarctica our</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="4.38">cosmic lineage I brought up the black</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="4.47">projects I brought up so many different</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="4.92">things so of course I&amp;#39;m going to take</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="4.74">this opportunity to go down there to</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="3.81">hopefully red pill awaken the 10 to 15</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="4.59">people that were in the room that day</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="6.15">but also get that on camera and then</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="6.75">Comedy Central can choose to do whatever</text>
  <text start="194.46" dur="6.93">they want with it and then deal with the</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="6.15">consequences of their choice right so</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s that number two I did it for</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="9.21">money Jordan did it for money he sold</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="9.33">out and my answer to that is fYI I was I</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="5.73">wasn&amp;#39;t paid anything to do this all they</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="5.58">did was comp flights rides and a hotel</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="4.35">and like I said I didn&amp;#39;t even take the</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="6.38">rides and I didn&amp;#39;t even stay at the</text>
  <text start="223.86" dur="6.27">hotel I purchased a last-minute small</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="4.66">Hollywood apartment from a really</text>
  <text start="230.13" dur="5.67">adorable couple and if anything I</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="4.98">actually paid money to go do this with</text>
  <text start="235.8" dur="2.46">less amenities than I would have had</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="3.93">otherwise</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="5.94">but you know due to my morals my</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="5.55">standards I don&amp;#39;t want to give the</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="4.8">standard hotel my business nor do I want</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="3.39">to be you know just go into that</text>
  <text start="249" dur="2.85">situation where they have cameras</text>
  <text start="250.77" dur="2.67">everywhere could have had somebody</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="5.22">follow me at that place whatever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.44" dur="6.18">just you know I have morals I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="5.19">to spend my money on corrupted</text>
  <text start="259.62" dur="6.51">corporations and that&amp;#39;s how I live my</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="7.23">life I actually paid money to be there</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="5.43">and number three I did this to promote</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="4.47">my brand George is just doing this for</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="6.72">self-promotion and my answer to that is</text>
  <text start="273.96" dur="8.04">well of course I am right I mean anybody</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="8.64">who is a public figure or author or</text>
  <text start="282" dur="7.86">speaker or you know business owner what</text>
  <text start="286.92" dur="5.16">are the cases every lots of what they do</text>

  <text start="298.35" dur="5.97">the masses if I don&amp;#39;t get it out to the</text>
  <text start="302.04" dur="5.76">masses right so yeah you have to do</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="7.74">promotion but the thing is a question is</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="8.61">is what you are promoting substance less</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.64">or full of substance are you doing the</text>
  <text start="316.41" dur="3.77">promotion of your brand for your own</text>
  <text start="317.7" dur="4.74">self-interests or is your brand actually</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="4.45">serving others are you serving yourself</text>
  <text start="322.44" dur="7.17">or serving others right very base the</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="8.25">thing to ask when thinking about actions</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="5.1">services self service to others and with</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="4.74">the work I do the content I make I try</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="4.89">to serve others as much as I can with</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="3.69">health information with understanding</text>

  <text start="342.87" dur="6.69">the mind works etc etc so no well yeah I</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="7.49">did it to promote my brand but no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="6.86">not for something that is not helpful</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="5.43">number four</text>
  <text start="356.42" dur="8.97">he&amp;#39;s got an ego jordan has a huge ego</text>
  <text start="360.23" dur="7.78">doing this that&amp;#39;s all it is right well a</text>
  <text start="365.39" dur="4.27">very deep answer to this one and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="368.01" dur="3.87">try to keep it short and sweet here but</text>
  <text start="369.66" dur="5.22">the funny thing about social media is</text>
  <text start="371.88" dur="4.5">that I&amp;#39;m sure you understand this but I</text>
  <text start="374.88" dur="3.15">just want to reiterate this from</text>
  <text start="376.38" dur="3.81">somebody who&amp;#39;s now in the position</text>
  <text start="378.03" dur="4.65">behind the camera on the screen is that</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;ll never get to know somebody a</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="4.08">hundred percent of the way you&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="4.5">get to truly deeply know somebody you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="386.76" dur="4.29">know a lot about me I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="4.8">you guys out there know a whole lot</text>
  <text start="391.05" dur="4.44">about me certain things about me that</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="5.94">I&amp;#39;ve just put out over the last couple</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="7.44">years but you never truly get</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="7.94">no me and what&amp;#39;s funny is that I</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="6.96">actually come from a very introverted</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="5.56">background somebody who just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.89" dur="5.52">speak up in when I was younger in</text>
  <text start="412.89" dur="4.32">various relationships and in situations</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="5.67">yada yada you know I was very</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="6.27">introverted person and one of the</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="5.49">reasons that I did start this YouTube</text>
  <text start="423.48" dur="7.2">channel and go on this path was for my</text>
  <text start="426.57" dur="7.17">own self discovery and to work on those</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="4.89">shadows about myself you see through my</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="4.38">awakening process before I was ever even</text>
  <text start="435.57" dur="4.38">on the internet a few years ago I was</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="4.74">connecting with individuals on YouTube</text>
  <text start="439.95" dur="6.57">and I was watching them go through their</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="7.05">own self-discovery self individuation</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="5.28">process as I was going through my own</text>
  <text start="449.91" dur="3.63">where I just wasn&amp;#39;t on the internet but</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="3.48">I saw what happened to them and then I</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="3.15">was in that position a couple years ago</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="2.7">where I was like wow you know maybe I</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="5.37">could just do this whole YouTube thing</text>
  <text start="457.98" dur="6.18">and we&amp;#39;ll see hey how many people I can</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="5.61">help but be how much I can help myself</text>
  <text start="464.16" dur="5.82">and what I can do with my own soul you</text>
  <text start="467.67" dur="6.54">know my own ego alright because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.98" dur="5.82">the thing about the ego is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="4.44">gonna get some philosophical talk here</text>
  <text start="475.8" dur="4.26">is that everybody thinks they need to</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="2.7">destroy their ego they need to kill</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="3.6">their ego they need to get rid of it we</text>
  <text start="481.35" dur="4.89">hear this reiterated over and over and</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="4.62">over again but with the ego it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="486.24" dur="5.04">something you kill you need your ego</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="5.16">your ego is what helps you understand</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="6.78">this experience wherein it&amp;#39;s what helps</text>
  <text start="493.44" dur="6.06">you gauge the outside physical world so</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="3.63">your ego isn&amp;#39;t lens and it&amp;#39;s the lens</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="4.61">you need to develop and the problem is</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="4.74">that people&amp;#39;s egos are either</text>
  <text start="504.11" dur="4.24">underdeveloped or overdeveloped either</text>
  <text start="506.43" dur="4.35">under inflated or overinflated right</text>
  <text start="508.35" dur="4.2">this is why oh well yes you can see I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="510.78" dur="4.43">been studying a lot of psychology lately</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s why psychoanalysts psychoanalysis</text>
  <text start="515.21" dur="5.71">excuse me fascinates me I love to study</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="5.76">young and Campbell &amp;amp; Moore and</text>
  <text start="520.92" dur="5.19">archetypes these concepts learn a lot</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="4.83">about yourself but anyway that&amp;#39;s just me</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="4.83">talking about this in general at least</text>
  <text start="528.78" dur="4.69">in this particular instance of going</text>
  <text start="530.94" dur="5.71">down to Comedy Central no it wasn&amp;#39;t from</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="6.38">ego it was for the greater good you know</text>
  <text start="536.65" dur="5.07">because help this could definitely be</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="4.3">there could be a lot of people out there</text>
  <text start="541.72" dur="5.37">that think I&amp;#39;m a nut ball in a few weeks</text>
  <text start="544.15" dur="6.93">right but hey I&amp;#39;m not concerned about</text>
  <text start="547.09" dur="5.67">that you know we&amp;#39;ll see we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="551.08" dur="3.99">kind of challenge that makes I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="5.07">about challenges I&amp;#39;m always about self</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="4.86">development self growth so that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="557.83" dur="6.3">thought I could accomplish here and the</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="5.85">very last thing is number five is that</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="4.17">Jordan does not represent me</text>
  <text start="565.78" dur="4.56">or represent the Q community sock up</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="6">when people say that and what I would</text>
  <text start="570.34" dur="9.57">say to that is you are right you are</text>
  <text start="574.3" dur="9.32">right I do not represent anybody or any</text>
  <text start="579.91" dur="7.05">movement or any community but myself I</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.93">am the only thing that I represent I</text>
  <text start="586.96" dur="3.33">have never once said that I represent</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="7.25">anybody else or any movement or any</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="8.28">community so if you think I am that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.8" dur="5.46">your own misconception that your let</text>
  <text start="598.57" dur="6.96">getting to your own head right</text>
  <text start="601.26" dur="5.89">my beliefs differ from a lot of people</text>
  <text start="605.53" dur="5.25">out there not not just on the mainstream</text>
  <text start="607.15" dur="5.04">but even in the Q community itself my</text>
  <text start="610.78" dur="4.17">beliefs differ from a lot of people</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="4.2">there and I don&amp;#39;t hold you know I</text>
  <text start="614.95" dur="3.24">understand that I understand that we all</text>
  <text start="616.39" dur="4.43">come from different experiences so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.19" dur="6.77">gonna have different ways we see things</text>
  <text start="620.82" dur="8.59">but I am here for the greater good and</text>
  <text start="624.96" dur="6.94">the with the work I do what I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="629.41" dur="6.03">to do is create individuals create</text>
  <text start="631.9" dur="7.56">people who are free thinking free acting</text>
  <text start="635.44" dur="5.73">sovereign human beings right I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="639.46" dur="3.45">doing this for movements or communities</text>
  <text start="641.17" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m creating individuals who can go out</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="4.56">there and put themselves into</text>
  <text start="644.29" dur="4.98">communities but not be attached to those</text>
  <text start="647.47" dur="3.63">communities you owe you know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
