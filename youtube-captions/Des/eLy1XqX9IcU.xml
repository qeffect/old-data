  <text start="0" dur="5.58">I feel like I&amp;#39;m floatin or something</text>
  <text start="2.79" dur="4.92">besides coming down I&amp;#39;m really scared</text>
  <text start="5.58" dur="5.939">and nothing if it&amp;#39;s me it gets the world</text>
  <text start="7.71" dur="6.059">I&amp;#39;m gonna be okay so I want to talk</text>
  <text start="11.519" dur="3.481">about disclosure and what it is in</text>
  <text start="13.769" dur="3.751">general because it&amp;#39;s a term that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="15" dur="4.38">thrown around quite a bit and honestly</text>
  <text start="17.52" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s been somewhat hijacked by the UFO</text>
  <text start="19.38" dur="4.35">community but when you look at that word</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="5.88">disclosure it simply means the act of</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="4.86">revealing secret information so for all</text>
  <text start="27.06" dur="3.18">intents and purposes you could say</text>
  <text start="28.59" dur="3.45">disclosures going on right now because</text>
  <text start="30.24" dur="3.569">there&amp;#39;s all kinds of information coming</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="3.33">to light you could say we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="33.809" dur="4.111">disclosure for a while and are gonna</text>
  <text start="35.37" dur="4.14">keep going in it now eventually we will</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="4.799">get to somewhat of a breakthrough and</text>
  <text start="39.51" dur="6.63">like a hundredth monkey effect but right</text>
  <text start="42.719" dur="6.031">now we are in disclosure and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="3.96">just about UFOs there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="48.75" dur="2.37">different subjects there&amp;#39;s vaccine</text>
  <text start="50.1" dur="3">disclosures right we have a</text>
  <text start="51.12" dur="4.05">whistleblower there we have GMO</text>
  <text start="53.1" dur="3.57">disclosures we have human history</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="3.93">disclosures drug trafficking human</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="4.229">trafficking arms trafficking we have I</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="4.08">mean there&amp;#39;s lots of different pieces to</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="5.4">it right along with UFOs and the</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.49">technology and secret stuff associated</text>
  <text start="66.299" dur="5.07">there so disclosure is one big thing</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="6.42">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different pieces and in</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="5.851">all honesty two of the pieces that are</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="4.139">the biggest to me that I think we can</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.89">get a very telling sign as to who is</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="5.701">advocating for full disclosure and is</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="4.71">you advocating for non full disclosure</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="4.56">are these two these are the two biggest</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.83">issues in my opinion that are plaguing</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="4.32">humanity and what I did is actually</text>
  <text start="91.65" dur="4.71">charted a graph and I put different</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="4.59">people who are really into these realms</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="4.23">on this graph to see where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="7.56">standing in this full disclosure because</text>
  <text start="100.59" dur="8.13">let&amp;#39;s be real I mean if we are for human</text>
  <text start="105.96" dur="5.01">freedom complete human freedom you and I</text>
  <text start="108.72" dur="4.98">we need to be free ourselves we need to</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="4.439">be transparent ourselves right as within</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="3.75">so without it&amp;#39;s gonna reflect right back</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="3.75">on to us what we put out so if we want</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="4.199">full disclosure you got to talk about it</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="4.74">you got to be about it and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="5.43">dissect different people for you and see</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="5.791">where they&amp;#39;re at now when I need pedal</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="4.261">gate and kind of uncle origins here you</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="5.42">can consider this pedal gate</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="3.77">trafficking human trafficking</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="10.45">graphic warning here but ritualistic sex</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="8.97">abuse I say that what needs to be said</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="4.71">so this is that really deep deep dark</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="3.96">dirty stuff right the stuff that nobody</text>
  <text start="151.8" dur="6">wants to look at but we need to it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="5.7">the darkness that you know you have to</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="6.21">face to transcend and over here we have</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="6.42">the UFO the free-energy sspc your space</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="4.68">program stuff the you know call it</text>
  <text start="166.23" dur="5.4">zero-point energy this is all the fun</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="6.3">technology and this stuff is amazing</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="5.13">on one hand you&amp;#39;re absolutely pissed off</text>
  <text start="174.99" dur="3.87">because it&amp;#39;s been kept from us for a</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="4.5">hundred years and built out far more</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="3.66">than the mass public realizes but on the</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="2.76">other hand I think a lot of people get</text>
  <text start="182.52" dur="3.24">caught up in here they get caught up in</text>
  <text start="184.02" dur="3.84">the light of this in the excitement of</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="3.9">getting all their their technologies and</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="5.76">stuff without admitting that that&amp;#39;s real</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="7.2">so I took people that are talking about</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="5.46">both of these on this graph plotted them</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="4.2">and I&amp;#39;m gonna see where they&amp;#39;re at and</text>
  <text start="199.08" dur="5.28">why for you guys now I&amp;#39;m gonna begin</text>
  <text start="201.06" dur="6.18">here right we have Hillary Clinton Tom</text>
  <text start="204.36" dur="6.57">DeLonge and John Podesta now these guys</text>
  <text start="207.24" dur="7.23">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t know they are all</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="6.27">for UFO disclosure but what kind is the</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="5.25">question so everybody knows that in</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="4.56">Podesta&amp;#39;s emails he was referencing hot</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="4.05">dogs and cheese and a bunch of other fun</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="3.63">party foods but what not only people</text>
  <text start="223.77" dur="4.29">realize is he was actually mentioning</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="5.94">zero-point energy and disclosure by name</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="6.99">he had emails with Tom DeLonge who he</text>
  <text start="231.33" dur="5.43">was setting up with actually a Air Force</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="4.38">general general McCasland and the</text>
  <text start="236.76" dur="7.62">director of Lockheed skunkworks Rob</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="8.46">Weiss Hillary Clinton was also known for</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="4.08">her advocacy of her version of UFO</text>
  <text start="247.89" dur="2.43">truth-telling</text>
  <text start="248.46" dur="3.96">of her unexplained aerial phenomena</text>
  <text start="250.32" dur="4.44">telling it&amp;#39;s what she called it on Jimmy</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="4.789">Fallon I think and she was also filmed</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="5.16">at Lawrence Rockefellers ranch holding a</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="6.821">extra book remember that&amp;#39;s Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="259.92" dur="5.55">so these guys are actually for UFO</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="3.259">disclosure because I like down here not</text>
  <text start="265.47" dur="4.919">that much but a little bit right</text>
  <text start="267.289" dur="5.521">what kind of application are they for</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="5.37">pedo gate disclosure</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="4.359">none of them DeLong was actually all for</text>
  <text start="275.759" dur="4.921">Hillary Clinton a system to say he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="7.5">it Tom DeLonge you know the the for who</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="5.04">is in Angels and Airwaves and the well</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="3.03">arguably one of the biggest bands of all</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="3.87">time blink-182 he&amp;#39;s kind of appealing to</text>
  <text start="287.699" dur="4.28">the younger generation for him which is</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="6.63">funny because he was my favorite freakin</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="7.271">you know band person ever I actually met</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="5.669">him once picture it&amp;#39;s just ironic which</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;m here now doing this um these guys</text>
  <text start="301.889" dur="3.691">are all for this disclosure but none for</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="4.14">that I actually put Podesta below the</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="6.42">line for his various pizza party</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="6.06">obsession so these guys got questioning</text>
  <text start="312" dur="4.289">where you at you like way down here in</text>
  <text start="314.31" dur="3.12">the corner it&amp;#39;s probably whether it</text>
  <text start="316.289" dur="2.701">should be for the rest of eternity</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="5.34">except him you can keep making good</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="7.53">music dude next we have Steven Greer and</text>

  <text start="332.58" dur="3.57">reading his stuff for decades not</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="3.269">decades he&amp;#39;s been around for decades</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ve been reading it for like five or</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="4.951">six years now his stuffs been fantastic</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="3.78">and a lot of great military</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="4.26">whistleblowers talking about their</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="6.149">experiences with UFOs the ones that have</text>
  <text start="347.13" dur="8.46">been willing to go on camera so good</text>
  <text start="350.669" dur="7.5">stuff but in regards to over here not</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="4.379">word he actually briefed John Podesta no</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="3.391">Diane I was one of the persons he</text>
  <text start="359.969" dur="3.661">briefed in Obama&amp;#39;s administration about</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="3.9">UFOs and free energy so maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="4.379">where he got a lot of his ideas and like</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="4.139">hi maybe we can you know fake the public</text>
  <text start="368.009" dur="5.551">out with UFO stuff so we can keep that</text>

  <text start="373.56" dur="2.759">that&amp;#39;s just what I have question about</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="3.06">him I mean if we&amp;#39;re advocating for full</text>
  <text start="376.319" dur="4.53">disclosure you got talking about that</text>
  <text start="377.849" dur="5.701">too now we move on to kind of this</text>
  <text start="380.849" dur="6.151">region I&amp;#39;m gonna go up in an arc like so</text>

  <text start="387" dur="3.84">media now most alt media this is what</text>
  <text start="389.699" dur="5.33">I&amp;#39;m classifying like Collective</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="7.59">evolution and maybe waking times and</text>
  <text start="395.029" dur="5.251">that anti needy and you know those those</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="5.959">places the ones that are larger and</text>
  <text start="400.28" dur="5.55">appeal to a broader audience um it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="404.389" dur="3.061">kind of a tough bind for them because</text>

  <text start="414.8" dur="2.82">guys because they&amp;#39;re trying to appeal to</text>
  <text start="416.18" dur="3.75">a wide audience but I know Collective</text>

  <text start="599.589" dur="4.99">but anyway so that&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="602.93" dur="3.48">definitely seeing space program</text>
  <text start="604.579" dur="3.57">disclosures but not so much there and</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="3.239">understand you know just be aware of the</text>
  <text start="608.149" dur="7.321">reason so you can discern what people</text>
  <text start="609.649" dur="8.011">are saying and why so they&amp;#39;re there and</text>
  <text start="615.47" dur="3.42">we don&amp;#39;t David Wilcock up here I put him</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="2.52">a little higher and I put Corey Goode</text>
  <text start="618.89" dur="3.81">actually a little separate from Gaia</text>
  <text start="620.18" dur="6.3">because him for instance on his YouTube</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="5.61">and some articles he&amp;#39;s shared online he</text>
  <text start="626.48" dur="3.39">has talked about human trafficking he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="628.31" dur="3.99">talked about little in the and he</text>
  <text start="629.87" dur="5.43">doesn&amp;#39;t reference it much on this stuff</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="5.94">for various reasons who knows but he has</text>
  <text start="635.3" dur="5.34">so props to him for that okay because I</text>
  <text start="638.24" dur="7.05">remember on his uh on his Corey Goods</text>
  <text start="640.64" dur="5.88">YouTube he was when what was it Trump</text>
  <text start="645.29" dur="2.4">had that executive order when he signed</text>
  <text start="646.52" dur="3.33">the executive order about human</text>
  <text start="647.69" dur="5.04">trafficking he filmed that right on his</text>
  <text start="649.85" dur="5.669">TV there so no that&amp;#39;s cool but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.73" dur="4.14">still a lot more to discuss a lot of</text>
  <text start="655.519" dur="3.331">people think he&amp;#39;s the top of the totem</text>
  <text start="656.87" dur="3.87">pole and and he is too but definitely</text>
  <text start="658.85" dur="3.15">not there&amp;#39;s so much more to research but</text>
  <text start="660.74" dur="5.52">then that brings us to David Wilcock</text>
  <text start="662" dur="5.49">David Wilcock had his great expose on</text>
  <text start="666.26" dur="1.56">pizza gate it&amp;#39;s one of the ones that I</text>
  <text start="667.49" dur="4.62">actually</text>
  <text start="667.82" dur="6.12">reference the most in all honesty though</text>
  <text start="672.11" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;s kind of difficult to lead on to the</text>
  <text start="673.94" dur="3.51">general public because it starts out</text>
  <text start="675.23" dur="6.15">with just like crazy Antarctic UFO stuff</text>
  <text start="677.45" dur="5.19">so people kind of the the muggles that</text>
  <text start="681.38" dur="2.94">not only call them muggles like</text>
  <text start="682.64" dur="3.21">derogatory but more unawakened per se</text>
  <text start="684.32" dur="2.61">kind of get shunned off by that before</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="2.88">they go to the pizza gate article but</text>
  <text start="686.93" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s a really good write-up really</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="4.32">friggin good on pizza gate so he has</text>
  <text start="690.77" dur="4.62">definitely talked about a little more in</text>
  <text start="693.05" dur="3.3">the way of pedagogical origins so yeah</text>
  <text start="695.39" dur="2.73">they woke up there</text>
  <text start="696.35" dur="4.41">he&amp;#39;s always advocating for full</text>
  <text start="698.12" dur="4.26">disclosure which you know and he may not</text>
  <text start="700.76" dur="3.42">talk about more in Japan okay because</text>
  <text start="702.38" dur="3.78">time time concerns he knows a lot of</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="4.26">stuff over here so understand there</text>
  <text start="706.16" dur="4.14">there might be various reasons why I</text>
  <text start="708.44" dur="5.19">placed them where they are and where</text>
  <text start="710.3" dur="6.71">they&amp;#39;re at so Stalin speculate and we</text>
  <text start="713.63" dur="5.76">got David Seaman over here he is</text>
  <text start="717.01" dur="4">definitely a man shoot if you follow</text>
  <text start="719.39" dur="4.83">this guy for a day you know he is all</text>
  <text start="721.01" dur="7.59">about that but he&amp;#39;s not very far along</text>
  <text start="724.22" dur="6.84">on the UFO scale and again for various</text>
  <text start="728.6" dur="5.09">reasons it could have been he just</text>
  <text start="731.06" dur="5.43">didn&amp;#39;t know right and I&amp;#39;ll get to that</text>
  <text start="733.69" dur="6.13">the reasons that separate kind of these</text>
  <text start="736.49" dur="4.77">areas of the grid David Seaman but when</text>
  <text start="739.82" dur="3.36">he got briefed he actually got briefed</text>
  <text start="741.26" dur="5.19">by David Wilcock back in early March I</text>
  <text start="743.18" dur="4.5">think or no January I don&amp;#39;t think my</text>
  <text start="746.45" dur="3.27">time frames off there anyway he got</text>
  <text start="747.68" dur="5.94">briefed by David Wilcock earlier this</text>
  <text start="749.72" dur="6.15">year late last year and who on his</text>
  <text start="753.62" dur="4.26">Twitter he started tweeting like UFO</text>
  <text start="755.87" dur="5.67">stuff and contact and whatnot for a</text>
  <text start="757.88" dur="4.95">couple days of people people like um on</text>
  <text start="761.54" dur="2.91">the internet some of them thought he was</text>
  <text start="762.83" dur="3.69">nuts but he just got briefed by David</text>
  <text start="764.45" dur="5.82">Wilcock boom his consciousness increases</text>
  <text start="766.52" dur="5.22">he moves this way on the graft now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.27" dur="3.03">advocating for a little more full</text>
  <text start="771.74" dur="3.66">disclosure and we have George Webb up</text>
  <text start="773.3" dur="5.46">here oh my gosh you know if you want to</text>
  <text start="775.4" dur="6.9">know anything about DynCorp or this</text>
  <text start="778.76" dur="6.3">stuff follow him on YouTube my gosh so</text>
  <text start="782.3" dur="5.13">he is like all the way over for pedo</text>
  <text start="785.06" dur="3.57">gate but you know of course in regards</text>
  <text start="787.43" dur="3.21">to the UFO and free energy stuff again</text>
  <text start="788.63" dur="3.69">he definitely does that time or it could</text>
  <text start="790.64" dur="3.42">be an unawareness right</text>
  <text start="792.32" dur="5.22">the of this stuff and how that really</text>
  <text start="794.06" dur="5.85">ties into everything so how we kind of</text>
  <text start="797.54" dur="4.2">differentiate these is I wrote these</text>
  <text start="799.91" dur="4.32">right here</text>
  <text start="801.74" dur="5.51">47 Graff people in the UFO in the</text>
  <text start="804.23" dur="5.07">free-energy area if they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="807.25" dur="3.43">honestly with all the changing</text>
  <text start="809.3" dur="3.86">energetics going on this university they</text>
  <text start="810.68" dur="5.01">want to keep going and survive and</text>
  <text start="813.16" dur="4.239">prosper you could say ride the wave and</text>
  <text start="815.69" dur="4.62">say I get sucked under they need</text>
  <text start="817.399" dur="4.981">transparency they need transparency to</text>
  <text start="820.31" dur="5.07">talk about all this stuff as well so</text>
  <text start="822.38" dur="7.2">them obviously they&amp;#39;re gonna want to</text>
  <text start="825.38" dur="5.07">talk about him he&amp;#39;s all into UFOs a free</text>
  <text start="829.58" dur="1.59">energy but he&amp;#39;s gonna have to talk about</text>
  <text start="830.45" dur="4.77">that stuff</text>
  <text start="831.17" dur="6.359">if let&amp;#39;s keep going then you know all</text>
  <text start="835.22" dur="4.14">these guys down here if you&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="837.529" dur="5.461">area basically you just need more</text>
  <text start="839.36" dur="7.53">transparency to move that way these guys</text>
  <text start="842.99" dur="7.37">either need courage to talk about it or</text>
  <text start="846.89" dur="6.06">they just need a broadening perspective</text>
  <text start="850.36" dur="4.18">so maybe they don&amp;#39;t know maybe George</text>
  <text start="852.95" dur="2.84">Webb just doesn&amp;#39;t know the pieces of</text>
  <text start="854.54" dur="4.32">this down here he doesn&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="855.79" dur="4.54">zero-point energy or the basics of you</text>
  <text start="858.86" dur="3.599">know electrogravitic technology and</text>
  <text start="860.33" dur="4.83">whatnot he doesn&amp;#39;t really understand all</text>
  <text start="862.459" dur="4.711">that missing money and the money they</text>
  <text start="865.16" dur="6.66">make from a lot of this stuff over here</text>
  <text start="867.17" dur="6.81">goes into that so who knows also could</text>
  <text start="871.82" dur="3.48">be just a time thing I know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="873.98" dur="2.729">probably a busy dude with all stuff he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="875.3" dur="3.06">researching so he probably wishes he</text>
  <text start="876.709" dur="3.691">could get over here but he&amp;#39;s got his</text>
  <text start="878.36" dur="5.39">niche that he&amp;#39;s flowing in right now so</text>
  <text start="880.4" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s cool too but or they need courage</text>
  <text start="883.75" dur="3.7">did I say courage because I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.07" dur="4.44">got balls of steel I mean all these guys</text>
  <text start="887.45" dur="4.44">do but broadening perspective as well</text>
  <text start="890.51" dur="2.04">because we saw when David Seaman got</text>
  <text start="891.89" dur="2.28">briefed</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="3.42">he was probably you know over here</text>
  <text start="894.17" dur="3.45">before he had no idea what this stuff is</text>
  <text start="895.97" dur="5.67">down here and then David Wilcock talked</text>
  <text start="897.62" dur="5.94">to him boo you moved up this way so what</text>
  <text start="901.64" dur="4.38">we really where we want to go is this</text>
  <text start="903.56" dur="5.1">far into like that direction as possible</text>
  <text start="906.02" dur="4.68">right full freedom full transparency and</text>
  <text start="908.66" dur="3.39">honestly you like you don&amp;#39;t even worry</text>
  <text start="910.7" dur="4.44">about this graph you transcend the graph</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="4.77">and understand I mean there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="915.14" dur="2.639">different topics not just these twos you</text>
  <text start="916.82" dur="4.019">have you transparent about everything</text>
  <text start="917.779" dur="6.381">remember the trafficking of everything</text>
  <text start="920.839" dur="7.711">guns drugs humans organs everything and</text>
  <text start="924.16" dur="11.049">the medical the history the all the lies</text>
  <text start="928.55" dur="7.889">there but yeah so then you just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="935.209" dur="2.55">worried about the graph and you advocate</text>
  <text start="936.439" dur="2.82">for full disclosure I kind of lost my</text>
  <text start="937.759" dur="3.091">thought print train there but one last</text>
  <text start="939.259" dur="5.67">thing I do want to say this is just a</text>
  <text start="940.85" dur="7.2">thought I have sometimes if you want</text>
  <text start="944.929" dur="5.371">full disclosure think of this right</text>
  <text start="948.05" dur="5.159">think of you know in law of one terms</text>
  <text start="950.3" dur="5.55">they call a human group that so-called</text>
  <text start="953.209" dur="5.341">ascends from third density a was it a</text>
  <text start="955.85" dur="4.709">social memory complex or something like</text>
  <text start="958.55" dur="4.159">that but it&amp;#39;s to the effect of if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="960.559" dur="4.62">going to be an advanced civilization</text>
  <text start="962.709" dur="4.18">with certain you understand your</text>
  <text start="965.179" dur="4.111">potential of consciousness and you are</text>
  <text start="966.889" dur="5.341">able to thus ascend imagine if everybody</text>
  <text start="969.29" dur="5.039">had telepathy that&amp;#39;s basically what</text>
  <text start="972.23" dur="3.51">happens because everybody you know you</text>
  <text start="974.329" dur="2.7">you understand the power of your</text>
  <text start="975.74" dur="4.73">consciousness and you&amp;#39;re able to tie in</text>
  <text start="977.029" dur="5.701">together so if everybody had telepathy</text>
  <text start="980.47" dur="4.359">there&amp;#39;s no secrets there&amp;#39;s no secrets</text>
  <text start="982.73" dur="5.99">you could hide there should be no</text>
  <text start="984.829" dur="6.99">secrets that we have here to hide so</text>
  <text start="988.72" dur="4.239">that&amp;#39;s just what I want to advocate you</text>
  <text start="991.819" dur="3.63">guys may think of that sometimes if</text>
  <text start="992.959" dur="4.021">everybody had to let the thief man we</text>
  <text start="995.449" dur="3.87">would have to be pretty freaking honest</text>
  <text start="996.98" dur="4.349">wouldn&amp;#39;t be and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="999.319" dur="3.81">headed so just think of that sometimes</text>
  <text start="1001.329" dur="4.591">and understand you know full disclosure</text>
  <text start="1003.129" dur="4.111">people need to advocate for everything</text>
  <text start="1005.92" dur="2.159">and there&amp;#39;s various reasons they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1007.24" dur="5.069">or they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1008.079" dur="6.701">but those reasons need to be admitted so</text>
  <text start="1012.309" dur="5.721">anyway thanks guys</text>
