  <text start="108.36" dur="5.49">recording them just because with the</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="5.07">live like it&amp;#39;s tough to do all on my own</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.379">I totally wish I had some production</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="3.419">help to do those live streams but it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="465.539" dur="2.461">through some comments some people were</text>
  <text start="466.649" dur="4.38">saying they didn&amp;#39;t even know about it</text>
  <text start="468" dur="4.469">and it was promoted not too well and I</text>
  <text start="471.029" dur="2.73">will agree with you the promotion could</text>
  <text start="472.469" dur="4.44">have been better it was a very</text>
  <text start="473.759" dur="4.71">last-minute thing even myself I was</text>
  <text start="476.909" dur="2.73">skeptical about it for like a week or</text>
  <text start="478.469" dur="2.97">two I&amp;#39;m like I don&amp;#39;t even know who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.639" dur="4.921">doing this or what it&amp;#39;s gonna be like</text>
  <text start="481.439" dur="4.71">and many other queue accounts and</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="3.479">followers and researchers and</text>
  <text start="486.149" dur="3.871">journalists out there they they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="488.039" dur="3.87">just say anything about it because they</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="4.229">didn&amp;#39;t go or whatever the case so yeah</text>
  <text start="491.909" dur="4.44">promotion was minimal but next one we do</text>
  <text start="494.249" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;ll definitely be better and frankly</text>
  <text start="496.349" dur="4.261">that&amp;#39;s about what I was expecting there</text>
  <text start="497.789" dur="5.731">was like maybe a hundred ish people</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="5.07">there in and out during the day and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="3.629">kind of what I was expecting based upon</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="5.87">the promotion based upon the day it was</text>
  <text start="507.149" dur="6.63">on it was on a weekday it was you know</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="4.899">it was what it was and it turned out to</text>
  <text start="513.779" dur="4.711">be pretty neat pretty being event just</text>
  <text start="516.449" dur="5.7">good to get people there you know we are</text>
  <text start="518.49" dur="6.529">we might be few but we are mighty and it</text>
  <text start="522.149" dur="6.63">reminds me of that quote where it says</text>
  <text start="525.019" dur="6.161">paraphrasing here but basically never</text>
  <text start="528.779" dur="3.93">doubt a small committed group of people</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="2.94">that are wanting to change the world</text>
  <text start="532.709" dur="5.011">because no doubts the only thing that</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="5.64">has so I think that can describe that</text>
  <text start="537.72" dur="3.66">event quite well but there will be more</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="3.9">and when there&amp;#39;s more we&amp;#39;ll promote</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="4.86">better and we&amp;#39;ll get them bigger and</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="4.86">bigger so it&amp;#39;s gonna be grand it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="3.72">about finding events you can go to just</text>
