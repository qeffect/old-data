  <text start="8.99" dur="4.3">guys welcome to another video of me</text>
  <text start="11.519" dur="4.32">talking and in this episode one-minute</text>
  <text start="13.29" dur="4.77">discuss with you is what I call the</text>
  <text start="15.839" dur="3.421">three stages of the propaganda troll and</text>
  <text start="18.06" dur="3.42">the reason I&amp;#39;m discussing this with you</text>
  <text start="19.26" dur="5.04">is because with all the information</text>
  <text start="21.48" dur="5.4">coming out these days there are literal</text>
  <text start="24.3" dur="6.479">campaigns going on by the powers that be</text>
  <text start="26.88" dur="6.839">to really muddy the waters and obfuscate</text>
  <text start="30.779" dur="5.401">all of this information and really not</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="4.141">let people who are trying to seek the</text>
  <text start="36.18" dur="5.64">truth find the truth so what I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="6.42">do is take you through essentially the</text>
  <text start="41.82" dur="7.62">three stages or the three depths at</text>
  <text start="44.28" dur="7.64">which the powers that be will go to skew</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="4.65">all of the information out there and</text>
  <text start="51.92" dur="4.299">hopefully this will help you discern it</text>
  <text start="54.09" dur="3.629">this will help you have a keen eye when</text>
  <text start="56.219" dur="4.801">you&amp;#39;re looking at the internet and</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="5.191">trying to find information how you can</text>
  <text start="61.02" dur="4.169">really sift through it all and sift</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="4.59">through what people say so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="65.189" dur="4.981">gonna take you through these three and</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="5.369">the first one up here we have data</text>
  <text start="70.17" dur="5.37">centers and what I write analytics</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.981">tampering so this basically doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="3.84">usually involve people people don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="77.85" dur="3.629">to the picture until the lower steps but</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="5.34">I wrote this one is number one because</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="5.671">there are literal data centers will ever</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="4.14">have you know iPhones lined up or</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="3.96">computers in a row will they&amp;#39;ll generate</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="6.149">fake likes and think subs on account to</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="5.49">boost the ratings and I also wrote this</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="4.831">into the picture here as well D</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="6">monetization and messing with SEO SEO</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="4.529">means search engine optimization so</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s for instance you go to type in</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="5.941">anything on Google or YouTube like GMOs</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="4.799">and vaccines and whatnot the analytics</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="5.4">of Google and other search engines will</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="5.191">literally promote the ones promote the</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="4.199">videos and the articles that serve their</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="4.949">agenda so of course I mean just think</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="4.92">you going to you know Google you type in</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="4.381">September 11th and you&amp;#39;re gonna see all</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.081">the same corporate media websites as</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="3.63">number one and you&amp;#39;ll have to search</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="3.64">through page you know you get to page</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="3.43">three four or five till you get to any</text>
  <text start="132.55" dur="4.44">that might be some type of alternative</text>
  <text start="134.02" dur="6.33">news so they mess with the search engine</text>
  <text start="136.99" dur="5.79">they definitely D monetize videos to try</text>
  <text start="140.35" dur="5.01">to not allow the independent or</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="3.06">alternative reporters to really make a</text>
  <text start="145.36" dur="4.17">living</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="5.13">I mean I&amp;#39;ve even myself on my smaller</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="2.85">youtube channel I&amp;#39;ve had plenty of</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="2.34">videos that have D monetized a lot of</text>
  <text start="152.38" dur="3.39">them that have to do is like pizza</text>
  <text start="153.31" dur="4.26">gating pedo gay when the Syria thing</text>
  <text start="155.77" dur="3.27">happened you know those cruise missiles</text>
  <text start="157.57" dur="3.12">went off I had a few videos do you</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="3.33">monetize with the serious situation and</text>
  <text start="160.69" dur="3.72">then recently</text>
  <text start="162.37" dur="4.47">Seth rich actually the Seth rich topic</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="4.65">has been one that the powers-that-be do</text>
  <text start="166.84" dur="5.13">not want getting out so they definitely</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="4.8">do monetize people&amp;#39;s videos and again</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="4.44">the fakes likes and the fake sub so a</text>
  <text start="173.86" dur="6.06">lot of accounts that you&amp;#39;ll find on the</text>
  <text start="176.41" dur="4.86">internet whether it be a politician&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="3.36">account I think I read recently that</text>
  <text start="181.27" dur="4.11">Hillary Clinton had some crazy amount of</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="4.05">fake likes on her account or really just</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="4.77">anything anything that serves the powers</text>
  <text start="187.33" dur="4.11">that be is agenda and basically has</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="2.61">money behind it you always follow the</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="2.52">money they&amp;#39;re probably gonna have some</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="3.96">fake likes or fake subs on their</text>
  <text start="193.96" dur="4.02">accounts so that&amp;#39;s number one and again</text>
  <text start="196.72" dur="2.73">number one doesn&amp;#39;t normally of all</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="2.759">people I mean the people who be setting</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="4.17">up the data centers and messing with the</text>
  <text start="200.739" dur="4.711">analytics but this one you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="4.38">persons into the picture until you get</text>
  <text start="205.45" dur="4.77">number two here and number two I wrote</text>
  <text start="208" dur="6.27">the keyboard warrior armies and these</text>
  <text start="210.22" dur="5.64">are the people that are literally in I</text>
  <text start="214.27" dur="3.54">mean I coulda they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="3.72">data centers per se but these are the</text>
  <text start="217.81" dur="4.14">people or maybe they&amp;#39;re in the NSA&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.58" dur="4.17">dungeon and NSA basement but these are</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="3.96">the people who are behind computers and</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re the ones operating those troll</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="6.66">accounts that you see completely blast</text>
  <text start="229.27" dur="6">on YouTube you find them on blogs you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="4.65">find them on the comments section of</text>
  <text start="235.27" dur="3.42">both mainstream media and alternative</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="4.4">media websites you&amp;#39;ll find them just</text>
  <text start="238.69" dur="5.49">scoured throughout the internet and</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;re the ones especially on YouTube I</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="3.51">mean I&amp;#39;m most familiar with YouTube but</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re pretty easy to spot elsewhere</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="6.269">you&amp;#39;ll find them with some random</text>
  <text start="250.75" dur="6.06">obscure name and usually no profile</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="7.53">picture or some just goofy one and</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;ll always be pumping out some type</text>
  <text start="261.489" dur="4.521">of</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="6.12">misinformation disinformation or just</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="5.62">obscure narrative to really like I said</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="4.35">muddy the waters and confuse people who</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="3.51">are the honest truth seekers who are the</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="3.72">ones on these blogs and videos trying to</text>
  <text start="275.14" dur="4.32">find their way they look at the comments</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="6.03">and they see all these you know for</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="6.56">instance you could say a vaccine topic</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="5.4">or you find them a lot on GMOs or</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="4.21">anything that&amp;#39;s you know I wrote here</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="4.35">they will attack controversial or</text>
  <text start="290.23" dur="5.43">conspiratorial subjects with varied</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="4.8">arguments and for instance like you know</text>
  <text start="295.66" dur="2.91">you got any one of my vaccine videos</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re pretty strong on that topic</text>
  <text start="298.57" dur="3.96">because that&amp;#39;s a big red pill for people</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="4.71">so they&amp;#39;ll go on to vaccines and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="4.23">type in you know oh my child got all the</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="4.08">shots and he was fine and you know the</text>
  <text start="306.76" dur="8.07">idea they&amp;#39;ll use varied arguments so</text>
  <text start="308.98" dur="7.35">you&amp;#39;ll often find them how best I want</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="3.18">to describe this though they&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="4.08">different avenues to try and discredit</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="4.97">you with so they&amp;#39;ll either take oh</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="6.6">you&amp;#39;re just an idiot your jackass or</text>
  <text start="322.98" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;ll try to really degrade you and</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="3.51">just make it look obvious like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.23" dur="3.21">trying to call you out I need to</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="3.24">threaten you or they&amp;#39;ll say you know</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="5.01">where did you get your degree you got</text>
  <text start="333.76" dur="6.659">that or again they&amp;#39;ll maybe take a much</text>
  <text start="337.45" dur="5.43">more like subtle approach with their</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="5.281">trolling so they&amp;#39;ll go oh you know like</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="3.93">my child is fine and I understand where</text>
  <text start="345.7" dur="2.79">you&amp;#39;re coming from you know though</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;ll try to make it look like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.49" dur="6.66">a lot more legitimate but you can still</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="8.28">feel some type of agenda and issues</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="5.55">behind what they&amp;#39;re saying so I mean it</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="3.87">could be you know the the topics that</text>
  <text start="360.7" dur="3.78">they usually get their orders for across</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="3.48">the board I said GMOs and vaccines it</text>
  <text start="364.48" dur="3.24">could be chemtrails could be really</text>
  <text start="366.22" dur="3.81">anything anything they need to hit and</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="3.99">they I wrote this down as well they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="3.51">get marching orders for current events</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="4.26">and that&amp;#39;s quite literally what happens</text>
  <text start="373.54" dur="3.81">so for instance like the the best</text>
  <text start="375.97" dur="3.69">example I can give for this one is the</text>
  <text start="377.35" dur="5.37">recent false flag attack in Manchester</text>
  <text start="379.66" dur="5.1">and a lot of people came out saying that</text>
  <text start="382.72" dur="3.66">oh this false flag was to distract from</text>
  <text start="384.76" dur="3.09">the seth rich story blowing up which</text>
  <text start="386.38" dur="2.67">it&amp;#39;s probably one of those probably many</text>
  <text start="387.85" dur="5.1">reasons for that false flag attack but</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s one of them and not only is the</text>
  <text start="392.95" dur="3.27">seth rich story big but that false flag</text>
  <text start="394.84" dur="3.18">right a lot of people started</text>
  <text start="396.22" dur="3.51">Oh what if whistle false I was false</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="4.02">flag and then even Snopes had to debunk</text>
  <text start="399.73" dur="5.39">it a lot of mainstream media websites</text>
  <text start="402.04" dur="5.28">did but you saw or at least I saw</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="4.06">because I had a keen eye for this stuff</text>
  <text start="407.32" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;ve been watching it for a while you</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="5.16">saw once that Manchester false like hit</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="3.18">anything that had like Manchester or</text>
  <text start="414.34" dur="4.98">false flag in the title the trolls just</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="5.31">went for you also find them on for</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="3.93">instance like the series thing anytime</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s an event that happens</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="3">and then a lot of people especially the</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="3.72">alt media start making videos on it or</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="3.96">articles on it they&amp;#39;ll usually get the</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="3.42">marching orders and you know they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="3.39">whatever analytics and search engine</text>
  <text start="431.89" dur="6.45">optimization they need to to find out</text>
  <text start="433.6" dur="6.12">who to hit you see so that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="438.34" dur="3">know you also find them a lot on like</text>
  <text start="439.72" dur="4.53">Flat Earth stuff and we&amp;#39;re not gonna get</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="5.64">into that here but there&amp;#39;s a reason you</text>
  <text start="444.25" dur="4.53">find a lot of flatter stuff and then you</text>
  <text start="446.98" dur="3.36">know anything like that so that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="448.78" dur="4.38">lot of examples that I can use for you</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="6.9">to help you navigate where the trolls</text>
  <text start="453.16" dur="6.81">might be and then after we go from the</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="4.05">keyboard warriors keyboard warrior</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="2.94">armies these are the ones again they</text>
  <text start="461.29" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t show their face they are real</text>
  <text start="462.91" dur="5.97">people behind real keyboards but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.76" dur="5.82">just perusing with their pseudonym</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="5.52">accounts and after we go from this one</text>
  <text start="471.58" dur="5.46">we then go to the public faces the this</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="5.88">is the the troll boss number three this</text>
  <text start="477.04" dur="5.52">is the you know the big one these are</text>
  <text start="480.28" dur="4.17">the ones where you know their face you</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="3.6">know who they are you know their name I</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="2.7">mean of course if it&amp;#39;s their real name</text>
  <text start="486.16" dur="4.85">they&amp;#39;re giving you but you know their</text>
  <text start="487.15" dur="8.16">name and they&amp;#39;re the ones who are out</text>
  <text start="491.01" dur="6.6">there so the best example I can give for</text>
  <text start="495.31" dur="4.5">this one is the popular names who spread</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="4.18">mainstream disinformation and I have</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="4.56">written down here Bill Nye and Neil</text>
  <text start="501.79" dur="5.55">deGrasse sorry if this triggers you but</text>
  <text start="504.37" dur="4.74">this is absolute truth they are like the</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="4.53">shill of all shills I call him she&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="5.13">not a science lie and Neil disgrace</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="4.07">Tyson huh but they&amp;#39;re the ones they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="4.28">spreading all kinds of disinformation</text>
  <text start="515.94" dur="5.56">especially Bill Nye with his new like</text>
  <text start="518.52" dur="5.38">Netflix show and then Neil deGrasse</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="6.23">Tyson is always up there just talking a</text>
  <text start="523.9" dur="5.74">bunch of not actual scientific</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="4.73">mainstream dogma</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="5.28">so they&amp;#39;re out there as the public faces</text>
  <text start="532.46" dur="5.16">the public trolls who are there to use</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="4.53">their confident air right the public</text>
  <text start="537.62" dur="5.34">trolls they always have this confident</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="5.1">kind of arrogant feeling about them you</text>
  <text start="542.96" dur="3.72">could just look at them and understand</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="3.75">it and whenever they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="546.68" dur="4.62">disagree with something they&amp;#39;ll raise</text>
  <text start="548.3" dur="5.13">their voice they&amp;#39;ll try to fall back</text>
  <text start="551.3" dur="4.68">upon their science science said this</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="5.79">least these guys do but that&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="4.89">thing same thing different day and we</text>
  <text start="559.22" dur="4.44">won&amp;#39;t necessarily go too far into these</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="5.58">two trolls but not only will you find</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="5.25">the public faces as the trolls but also</text>
  <text start="566.45" dur="4.62">the placed assets so wrote this down</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="4.32">here this is becoming a very pertinent</text>
  <text start="571.07" dur="6.12">issue placed assets in online</text>
  <text start="573.23" dur="5.88">communities to detract and confuse so</text>
