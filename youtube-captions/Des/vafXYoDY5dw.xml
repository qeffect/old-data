  <text start="35.719" dur="4.601">not enough people have like the right</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="3.54">perspectives or a frame of mine to</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="4.739">understand where I&amp;#39;m coming from with</text>
  <text start="42" dur="4.53">this little topic so I&amp;#39;m gonna as like</text>

  <text start="55.379" dur="5.25">mean I can&amp;#39;t tell you how to live your</text>
  <text start="57.329" dur="4.921">freakin life and basically my opinion of</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="3.93">it is great it has good physical</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="4.17">qualities but mentally it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="3.751">conscious usage and you can get addicted</text>
  <text start="66.42" dur="3.9">to it and use it to sedate yourself with</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="4.47">and run away from your pain or you can</text>
  <text start="70.32" dur="4.32">use it creatively so it&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="4.89">basics anyway I&amp;#39;m gonna talk to you</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="4.29">about this aliens in weed rights what</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="3.05">better two words to get people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="4.71">attentions than aliens and wheat and</text>
  <text start="80.72" dur="6.34">sure gets my attention but what occurred</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="4.86">is an actual crop circle so this is kind</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="3.75">of gonna be a lesson about crop circles</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="3.829">right class is in session that is</text>
  <text start="90.81" dur="5.669">actually from a really cool local band</text>
  <text start="92.329" dur="5.321">that song anyway blue scholars we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="2.64">gonna talk about crop circles and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="97.65" dur="3.48">going to show you this crop circle that</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="5.701">was made in the middle of last year in</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="5.46">England and uh uh just give you some</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="2.939">thoughts of mine on it that I&amp;#39;m like I</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="2.76">really want to get out there just</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="4.531">because it&amp;#39;s so interesting to me but</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="5.01">anyway I want to start right here first</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="4.679">first premises that we&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="4.71">right what are crop circles ok crop</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="4.171">circles are very real and they are not</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="3.57">man-made ok you can tell the man-made</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="3.479">ones cuz they&amp;#39;re just absolutely shitty</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="4.409">and tiny and they don&amp;#39;t look like</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="5.821">anything coherent look like a bunch of</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="5.91">drunks just made them right the big</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="3.06">giant ones right like this one for</text>
  <text start="132.959" dur="4.441">instance I&amp;#39;ll put</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="5.82">a real screenshot of it in a minute but</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s I mean just ungodly amounts of</text>
  <text start="139.32" dur="3.6">examples of ones that are like hundreds</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="4.89">and hundreds of feet just big circles</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="5.73">mandalas or designs and things like that</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="4.98">but they are not man-made they&amp;#39;re made</text>
  <text start="148.65" dur="4.47">by energetic orbs and there&amp;#39;s videos you</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="5.43">can find online right Patti Greer has</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="5.43">done a lot of good video work on crop</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="3.96">circles but you can find videos of</text>
  <text start="158.55" dur="4.68">energetic orbs making them and it just</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="3.66">makes logical sense that you know it</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="3.24">would be from some type of</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="3.45">extraterrestrial and most likely some</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="3.69">type of entity that&amp;#39;s you know obviously</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="7.05">not on our physical plane but doing it</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="6.03">with energetics now the crops obviously</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="3">you can just tell by looking at the</text>
  <text start="176.19" dur="5.58">crops not only the fact that the sizes</text>
  <text start="177.72" dur="7.019">are huge but that the crops bend and</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="5.34">they layer and they don&amp;#39;t die so when</text>
  <text start="184.739" dur="4.381">the people right humans do them they</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="6">break them and then they do them like</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="5.79">that but when actual energetic entities</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="3.42">make crop circles they&amp;#39;ll layer</text>
  <text start="194.91" dur="3.75">themselves somehow that you like</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="3.9">literally can&amp;#39;t do overnight you know</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="4.62">human hands would take years to do this</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="5.82">or a long time but they layer down and</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="4.2">they Bend they don&amp;#39;t die right they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="2.1">actually you can tell they&amp;#39;re bit</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="2.4">microwaved</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s the microwave emissions that causes</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="4.62">them to bend and then they find</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="5.64">electromagnetic fields around the crops</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="5.94">very weird and then normally the crop</text>
  <text start="218.28" dur="4.23">circles are always overlay lines so</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s a very big one and I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="3.36">probably a video soon on ley lines</text>
  <text start="224.579" dur="5.88">around the earth very interesting</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="6.709">concept when you look at the sacred</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="5.37">geometrical patterns that engrave our</text>
  <text start="232.579" dur="5.711">sphere earth and so they&amp;#39;re normally</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="4.171">overlay lines and that&amp;#39;s all just</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="6.35">basically all the evidence that proves</text>
  <text start="240" dur="7.86">crop circles are not human so anyway</text>
  <text start="244.64" dur="5.86">down to the reasoning of them then now</text>
  <text start="247.86" dur="5.34">that we understand that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="250.5" dur="6.329">man-made what they are is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="6.06">symbolic hints because of course free</text>
  <text start="256.829" dur="4.59">will right the prime directive exists in</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="5.25">our universe and you can&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="4.531">break that so all of these crop circles</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="2.79">that are over these energetic points</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="2.88">right over these ley lines</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="3.39">which makes it easier for these orbs to</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="3.929">create them which is why they&amp;#39;re usually</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="5.129">over reading water which is why this one</text>
  <text start="272.759" dur="7.681">right kind of back to that one this one</text>
  <text start="275.819" dur="6.06">was found over a in Wiltshire England I</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="2.909">believe and that&amp;#39;s why so many crop</text>
  <text start="281.879" dur="4.951">circles are found there is because their</text>
  <text start="283.349" dur="5.341">specific ley lines and water Pat</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="3.329">earnings that enhance the energetics</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="3.84">that make it so easy to do but these are</text>
  <text start="290.159" dur="4.591">found all over the world right just tend</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="3.539">to be around certain points anyway the</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="2.58">reasoning is because they&amp;#39;re symbolic</text>
  <text start="296.069" dur="5.331">hints and they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="7.019">certain things put up a picture here of</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="6.22">it&amp;#39;s like a it was a crop circle that</text>
  <text start="304.349" dur="4.711">was found and a designer used the design</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="3.15">of the crop circle to make free energy</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="3.99">devices right so secrets of our universe</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="3.84">are encoded in these you see the</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="3.329">Fibonacci spiral of certain sacred</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="3.72">geometrical patterns in this one I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="316.379" dur="3.63">gonna talk to you about this the Flower</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="2.989">of Life is found in it but it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="320.009" dur="3.481">freaking funny what that logo represents</text>
  <text start="321.319" dur="3.31">which I&amp;#39;ll get to in a sec but they</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="2.1">can&amp;#39;t break free will so they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="324.629" dur="2.76">trying to tell us things they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="325.59" dur="3.81">to give us hints I think there&amp;#39;s certain</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="4.53">astrological alignments they&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="329.4" dur="4.41">show in a lot of these so basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="3.511">like hey these are a bunch of hints out</text>
  <text start="333.81" dur="3.3">there for people who want to know who</text>
  <text start="335.43" dur="3.599">choose to know who choose to find out</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="3.63">who choose to believe it so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.029" dur="3.091">basically it and I&amp;#39;m choosing to believe</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="2.459">it and choosing to look at these hints</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="2.49">because it&amp;#39;s pretty frickin interesting</text>
  <text start="343.199" dur="3.991">when you can make a free energy device</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="4.32">out of what they put in crops so anyway</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="4.319">those are the premises behind crop</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="4.049">circles ii now i want to talk about this</text>
  <text start="351.509" dur="3.481">really freakin interesting thing and i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="352.979" dur="4.53">gonna put up a screenshot right here of</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="4.5">what it actually was and this was a crop</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="4.59">circle that was found in i think it was</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="5.91">the end of July or early August of last</text>
  <text start="362.099" dur="5.211">year 2016 and it was I just called</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="5.759">cannabis crop circle because what that</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="7.329">actually symbolizes is a pipe and bong</text>
  <text start="371.159" dur="4.711">making company they&amp;#39;ve been a bong I was</text>
  <text start="374.639" dur="2.131">investigating this a little bit because</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="2.4">I just thought it was so interesting</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="2.579">nobody&amp;#39;s really reported on it which is</text>
  <text start="378.27" dur="4.29">another reason I want to do this because</text>
  <text start="379.349" dur="5.461">nobody nobody&amp;#39;s found it as funny as me</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="4.05">it was a real crop circle referencing a</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="3.15">pipe in bong making company that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="2.88">existed for like three or four years</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="3.12">actually since like two thousand</text>
  <text start="389.49" dur="4.889">thirteen or fourteen out of Bellingham</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="5.61">Washington so fairly close to me but the</text>
  <text start="394.379" dur="3.72">piped bong making company you can see</text>
  <text start="396.69" dur="3.569">I&amp;#39;m gonna put up another screenshot</text>
  <text start="398.099" dur="2.731">right here it&amp;#39;s called mother ship</text>
  <text start="400.259" dur="3.361">mother</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="7.29">and is the name of it and you can see</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="7.35">the logo the logo has mothership and you</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="5.31">can see like I drew it out right here</text>
  <text start="410.97" dur="6.48">each of these hieroglyphs is like a</text>
  <text start="413.43" dur="6.27">symbol for the mothership word it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="417.45" dur="3.9">like they&amp;#39;re symbolizing that and right</text>
  <text start="419.7" dur="4.73">it&amp;#39;s a bomb pipe making company called</text>
  <text start="421.35" dur="5.43">mothership its transformer like the life</text>
  <text start="424.43" dur="4.51">should be like transformer like</text>
  <text start="426.78" dur="4.05">hieroglyphics symbolize the mothership</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="3.59">word so it looks like like transformer</text>
  <text start="430.83" dur="4.47">you know the movie transformer with uh</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="4.57">what&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s crazy face in it I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="435.3" dur="3.03">think right now but there&amp;#39;s been so many</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="2.31">people in those movies anyway the</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="2.46">Transformers when they have like the</text>
  <text start="439.41" dur="2.67">hieroglyphs and stuff and the movies it</text>
  <text start="440.79" dur="5.91">looks like that</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="6.9">Shia LaBeouf that&amp;#39;s the one so in a it</text>
  <text start="446.7" dur="3.63">symbolizes the name mothership of course</text>
  <text start="448.98" dur="3.39">they can&amp;#39;t tell us mothership they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.33" dur="6.27">right mothership in the crop circle but</text>
  <text start="452.37" dur="5.97">boom there it&amp;#39;s you know like I said you</text>
  <text start="456.6" dur="3.81">could choose to believe it and see it if</text>
  <text start="458.34" dur="3.48">you want the free will of it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="460.41" dur="3.3">break the prime directive would it</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="4.71">really be a PR stunt I&amp;#39;ve kind of seen</text>
  <text start="463.71" dur="4.56">this one and I want to address that how</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="2.7">do you really think that&amp;#39;s gonna be a PR</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="4.05">stunt how do you think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="469.23" dur="6.48">create a four to five hundred massive</text>
  <text start="472.32" dur="5.4">beautiful design overnight as a type of</text>
  <text start="475.71" dur="4.47">PR stunt</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="5.88">I just wrote what are they some et some</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="5.91">good day it&amp;#39;s just silly to think so I</text>
  <text start="483.6" dur="5.25">may be this company was like lucky maybe</text>
  <text start="486.09" dur="4.83">whatever they do is just so in alignment</text>
  <text start="488.85" dur="3.78">that the II decide ok let&amp;#39;s use this you</text>
  <text start="490.92" dur="3.54">know not many people will know and stuff</text>
  <text start="492.63" dur="4.94">only the weird kids with YouTube</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="5.1">channels that get high on for twenty</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="4.45">figure that&amp;#39;s not talking about it but</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="4.89">anyway I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s any type of PR</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="6.51">stunt but what is the message of it</text>
  <text start="504.45" dur="5.31">right what are the nonterrestrials what</text>
  <text start="508.53" dur="5.25">are the extraterrestrials trying to tell</text>
  <text start="509.76" dur="7.08">us this is saying mothership right so</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="5.19">are they calling right is it some type</text>
  <text start="516.84" dur="5.07">of saying to say hey some mother ships</text>
  <text start="518.97" dur="5.52">are here right because we&amp;#39;ve had certain</text>
  <text start="521.91" dur="4.02">testimony say that you know certain ETS</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="3.78">are coming here at the specific time to</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="5.52">look basically watch these cosmic</text>
  <text start="528.27" dur="5.91">changes occur and or help us per se</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="3.18">depending or is it saying maybe the</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="2.58">earth</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="5.76">is a type of mothership saying hey we</text>
  <text start="536.76" dur="5.25">better take care the freaking earth and</text>
