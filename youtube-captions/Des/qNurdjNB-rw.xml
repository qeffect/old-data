  <text start="8.84" dur="6.549">on May 31st and here to destroy some</text>
  <text start="13.139" dur="5.491">mainstream news illusions for today and</text>
  <text start="15.389" dur="4.921">first though probably sued what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="3.569">gonna do I was just contemplating before</text>
  <text start="20.31" dur="3.719">this video I want to make all these news</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="3.931">updates live videos that would be a</text>
  <text start="24.029" dur="3.66">whole lot easier for me and that way it</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="2.85">could just upload right to YouTube and</text>
  <text start="27.689" dur="4.59">have to worry about the exporting and</text>
  <text start="28.98" dur="6.239">the uploading part so what some things</text>
  <text start="32.279" dur="5.701">get shipped around once I get a better</text>
  <text start="35.219" dur="3.75">set up and certain things happen because</text>
  <text start="37.98" dur="4.079">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff going on a lot of</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="5.701">things I have lined up you can expect a</text>
  <text start="42.059" dur="4.831">lot more of those as well and anyway</text>
  <text start="44.67" dur="4.53">let&amp;#39;s get into all the news first and</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="4.2">foremost the Paris agreement I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="4.08">seeing things saying that Trump is</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="4.05">expected to withdraw the u.s. from the</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="6.75">Paris agreement as early as next week</text>
  <text start="55.14" dur="6.63">which is a great thing in my opinion and</text>
  <text start="60.03" dur="3.599">I know a lot of people get triggered</text>
  <text start="61.77" dur="3.66">when it comes to the EPA and climate</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="3.771">change or global warming or whatever you</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="7.59">want to call it but I wrote right here</text>
  <text start="67.4" dur="7.03">EPA equals bad epa is my anti and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s just the thing that triggers a</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="5.46">lot of people but they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="5.97">the epa not only are they in deep</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="3.69">collusion with monsanto and have let</text>
  <text start="81.9" dur="3.78">millions of pounds of pesticides</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="4.41">absolutely pollute the earth but the</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="4.95">climate change stick climate change</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="5.19">science is essentially tobacco science</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="4.02">where they pay off a bunch of doctors to</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="4.53">go out there with specific narratives</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="5.789">and from all the research that I have</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.769">personally done I don&amp;#39;t buy the man-made</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="3.871">climate change stick now that&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="3.721">say that we aren&amp;#39;t absolutely polluting</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="4.29">the crap out of our earth and we need</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="5.699">zero point free energy technologies</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="5.25">disclosed yesterday but I&amp;#39;m not buying</text>
  <text start="111.899" dur="4.26">the man way man-made global warming</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.229">thing and I think it&amp;#39;s all just a ruse</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="3.42">for the globalist to get more control</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="3.661">through their carbon taxes and their</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="6.271">agreements so what Donald Trump may do</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="6.15">is actually withdraw the US and then I</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="3.93">believe I read that the US will be one</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="3.929">of a only handful of countries that</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="2.6">aren&amp;#39;t in these agreements and some of</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="3.021">those country</text>
  <text start="132.38" dur="3.93">include Syria and then I think like</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="3.81">Nicaragua Guatemala or something like</text>
  <text start="136.31" dur="5.22">that so it&amp;#39;s like the countries that</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="5.16">aren&amp;#39;t for the whole deep state complex</text>
  <text start="141.53" dur="4.89">group are the ones withdrawing from this</text>
  <text start="143.81" dur="4.86">so that&amp;#39;s a good thing to me if he does</text>
  <text start="146.42" dur="4.56">that that&amp;#39;d be cool and then next we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148.67" dur="6.24">gonna get into this right here this word</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="5.73">that Trump tweeted out and caused an</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="4.83">absolute show in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="156.71" dur="6.66">media and that is cop cuff em cuff F</text>
  <text start="159.74" dur="7.49">imitate coffee coffee coffee V so he</text>
  <text start="163.37" dur="7.83">tweeted this his tweet actually said</text>
  <text start="167.23" dur="6.97">came out last night and he said despite</text>
  <text start="171.2" dur="6.57">the constant negative press coffe a day</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="6.42">and then he deleted that tweet and then</text>
  <text start="177.77" dur="5.1">soon after that it looked as if he was</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="4.47">making like a cover-your-ass tweet next</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="5.34">and it said who can figure out the true</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="6.03">meaning of coffee may enjoy and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.21" dur="5.1">what he said and you know I mean we all</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="3.93">have autocorrect issues and a lot of us</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="4.26">have big sausage fingers we can&amp;#39;t type</text>
  <text start="195.05" dur="4.56">on these tiny little iPhone screens that</text>
  <text start="197.57" dur="4.23">are out these days so I get that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="3.9">difficult the mainstream media decided</text>
  <text start="201.8" dur="4.2">to do their thing and use any little</text>
  <text start="203.51" dur="4.2">thing they can to get a you know back</text>
  <text start="206" dur="5.88">against this administration so they did</text>
  <text start="207.71" dur="6.69">that but I had a very interesting thing</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="5.1">come across my path literally like five</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="3.93">minutes before I did this video and just</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="3.09">really interesting the way the universe</text>
  <text start="218.33" dur="4.59">works sometimes but this little tidbit</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="5.85">of info cross my paths and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="4.83">complete speculation I don&amp;#39;t know you</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="3.539">know the verification status of it if</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="3.72">any of you guys know linguistics out</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="4.471">there let me know you know if this is</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="3.96">legit or not but I saw a piece of</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="2.82">information actually multiple places</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="3.96">which is why I kind of I wrote it up</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="8.24">here the cooperation of it but does</text>
  <text start="239.39" dur="8.22">cavae in ancient Arabic mean apocalypse</text>
  <text start="244.99" dur="5.62">very freaking interesting and this</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="4.08">actually is pretty cool it makes a whole</text>
  <text start="250.61" dur="2.49">lot of sense it makes things a whole lot</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="4.5">more interesting because when Donald</text>
  <text start="253.1" dur="7.35">Trump says despite the constant negative</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="8.01">press apocalypse if that&amp;#39;s if this was</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="5.28">in fact a super secret four dimensional</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="4.74">five dimensional chest</text>
  <text start="265.73" dur="5.64">great code he threw out there right what</text>
  <text start="268.94" dur="5.34">if I mean apocalypse again don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="271.37" dur="4.32">some fear-based reaction to it some bad</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="3.9">conch from a bad connotation of the word</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="5.07">apocalypse in Greek just literally</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="7.53">translates to revealing or uncovering or</text>
  <text start="280.76" dur="7.71">disclosing so bring in the etymology</text>
  <text start="285.71" dur="6.03">understanding into the picture despite</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="6.81">the constant negative press revealing</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="7.97">right what if this was some type of code</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="6.54">for a revealing about to take place yeah</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="3.64">it&amp;#39;s just I wanted to throw that out</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="4.32">there I want that to speculate in your</text>
  <text start="303.35" dur="4.41">mind&amp;#39;s because ruminate in your minds I</text>
  <text start="306.14" dur="4.05">want you to speculate on it because I</text>
  <text start="307.76" dur="5.34">think we&amp;#39;re really close to some kinds</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="6.51">of breakthroughs I&amp;#39;ll actually make more</text>
  <text start="313.1" dur="5.7">of a point on that through these points</text>
  <text start="316.7" dur="4.23">some of the me but I just the way that</text>
  <text start="318.8" dur="4.83">everything feels right now the way that</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="3.93">the world&amp;#39;s going geopolitically and the</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="3.48">way that you see all these</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="3.36">disinformation campaigns out there all</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="2.79">the desperate ones and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="3.66">media and alternative media just</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="4.71">everywhere I feel like we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="6.03">close to something big happening and</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="6.33">that you know this might well - very</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="5.4">well be some kind of code for it and I</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t know you can speculate on this as</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="3.78">much as you want as well but I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="3.75">some people say that Donald Trump is</text>
  <text start="347.09" dur="3.15">involved with the Knights Templar and</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="4.29">this could very well be some like</text>
  <text start="350.24" dur="5.73">Templar code for his secret society</text>
  <text start="353.06" dur="4.89">buddies I don&amp;#39;t know but interesting you</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="4.65">know speculate on that now next we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.95" dur="6.27">gonna get into James Comey testifying</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="6.66">and this was broken just a few hours ago</text>
  <text start="364.22" dur="5.85">but James Comey plans to testify</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="6.33">publicly in the Senate as early as next</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="6.39">week to confirm bombshell accusations</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="7.08">that Donald Trump pressured him to end</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="7.32">his investigation of a top Trump&amp;#39;s aides</text>
  <text start="380.69" dur="5.67">ties to Russia so James Comey just won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="4.44">give up whether he&amp;#39;s being threatened or</text>
  <text start="386.36" dur="4.83">whether he&amp;#39;s doing it upon his own free</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="5.91">will to go out there and just not give</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="4.86">up and spew a bunch of BS but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="4.47">basically he&amp;#39;s gonna testify to the</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="3">Senate okay and keep that in mind he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="2.249">test</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="4.109">find to the Senate this is a point I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="400.849" dur="3.931">gonna make in a minute now let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="403.159" dur="3.901">down to this point and this is another</text>
  <text start="404.78" dur="3.81">thing that broke just today and this</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="4.16">isn&amp;#39;t in the Senate Intelligence</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="6.569">Committee this is in the house</text>
  <text start="411.22" dur="5.59">Intel committee so seven people were</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="4.201">subpoenaed by the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="416.81" dur="4.62">Committee to discuss that unmasking</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="4.769">scandal Michael Flynn was one of them</text>
  <text start="421.43" dur="4.59">Susan Rice former CIA director John</text>
  <text start="424.129" dur="3.271">Brennan was also subpoenaed and there</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="3.299">were some other names thrown in there</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="2.97">but these are the important ones I</text>
  <text start="429.319" dur="3">wondered it right now so Michael Flynn</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="3.9">Susan Rice former CIA director all</text>
  <text start="432.319" dur="4.861">subpoenaed to testify in front of the</text>
  <text start="434.27" dur="4.35">house Intel committee and these are all</text>
  <text start="437.18" dur="4.56">things they&amp;#39;re gonna testify again about</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="4.65">the unmasking so this is it&amp;#39;s as if like</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="4.229">do you see kind of what I&amp;#39;m why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="5.489">separating these two so it&amp;#39;s as if the</text>
  <text start="445.969" dur="6.211">Senate Intelligence Committee won&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="448.759" dur="6.03">up their Russia propaganda shtick do you</text>
  <text start="452.18" dur="4.799">see so they&amp;#39;re trying to go like anti</text>
  <text start="454.789" dur="3.81">anti Trump or anti administration or</text>
  <text start="456.979" dur="3.421">just basically muddy the waters no</text>
  <text start="458.599" dur="3.841">matter you know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="460.4" dur="3.989">focus it on Trump per se a lot of people</text>
  <text start="462.44" dur="3.93">get attached to the name but I like to</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="4.71">say okay they&amp;#39;re trying to their for the</text>
  <text start="466.37" dur="3.599">deep State you&amp;#39;ll call it house Intel</text>
  <text start="469.099" dur="2.551">committee they&amp;#39;re trying to get these</text>
  <text start="469.969" dur="3.69">people to testify about the unmasking</text>
  <text start="471.65" dur="4.53">which you could say would help the</text>
  <text start="473.659" dur="3.69">administration especially if Susan Rice</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="4.41">came out there and dropped some truth</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="6.81">bombs assuming that their testimonies</text>
  <text start="480.59" dur="4.5">are truthful but very interesting to</text>
  <text start="484.159" dur="2.76">note that the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="4.079">Committee is almost acting for the</text>
  <text start="486.919" dur="3.631">administration so I just want to point</text>
  <text start="489.169" dur="4.8">that out to you because there is a</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="5.97">massive civil war going on and almost</text>
  <text start="493.969" dur="6.121">like every organization and government</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="5.82">and corporation it&amp;#39;s I mean it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="500.09" dur="4.47">blatant so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s as if even within</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="4.65">our own Congress there&amp;#39;s a bifurcation</text>
  <text start="504.56" dur="4.349">of support on what&amp;#39;s going on so just</text>
  <text start="506.99" dur="3.239">understand that and I made the point in</text>
  <text start="508.909" dur="3.24">my last news update that in the</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="4.5">mainstream media we&amp;#39;re saying a big a</text>
  <text start="512.149" dur="4.741">big split a big civil war going on so</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="6.42">that that was just something interesting</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="6.62">that I noticed so you can put a wrinkle</text>
  <text start="521.149" dur="5.491">in your brain with that one and then</text>
  <text start="523.51" dur="4.36">then we get into a couple of my last two</text>
  <text start="526.64" dur="3.15">points here and a couple of very</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="4.95">interesting ones that tie into this</text>
  <text start="529.79" dur="4.41">revealing going on which you know</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="4.17">could have donald trump could have very</text>
  <text start="534.2" dur="4.46">well meant some type of revealing by</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="5.01">tweeting that word real quick</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="6.28">robert bigelow who is an aerospace</text>
  <text start="542" dur="5.94">executive head of his own company it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.94" dur="6.57">called Bigelow Aerospace I believe he</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="5.76">just did a sixty minutes interview so</text>
  <text start="551.51" dur="3.42">somehow he got on sixty minutes he was</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="4.38">asked a bunch of questions and he</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="4.5">blatantly blatantly came out and said he</text>
  <text start="558.08" dur="4.16">was asked do you believe in aliens and</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="5.39">he straight-up said I&amp;#39;m absolutely</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="6.34">convinced that&amp;#39;s all there is to it and</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="6.31">then the interviewer Lara Logan Lara</text>
  <text start="568.58" dur="5.28">Logan asked him do you also believe that</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="5.07">UFOs have come to earth to which Bigelow</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="5.91">replied there has been and is an</text>
  <text start="576.2" dur="5.82">existing presence and et presence and I</text>
  <text start="579.77" dur="3.48">probably spent more as an individual</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="3.48">than anybody else in the US has ever</text>
  <text start="583.25" dur="7.38">spent on this subject granted I doubt</text>
  <text start="585.5" dur="7.74">that but I&amp;#39;m just saying he is on 60</text>
  <text start="590.63" dur="5.31">minutes saying these things that&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="4.2">and then the interview awesome is it</text>
  <text start="595.94" dur="2.94">risky for you to say in public that you</text>
  <text start="597.44" dur="3.92">believe in UFOs and aliens and he just</text>

  <text start="617.27" dur="3.99">mainstream circuit I&amp;#39;m looking at a</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="4.18">report on The Huffington Post on my</text>
  <text start="621.26" dur="3.54">computer right now that got 5,000 shares</text>
  <text start="623.15" dur="4.05">on Facebook just from this article and</text>
  <text start="624.8" dur="6.18">then it went around all kinds of media</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="6.33">outlets as well so again are we seeing</text>
  <text start="630.98" dur="4.34">breakthroughs are we seeing some kind of</text>
  <text start="633.53" dur="6.33">revealing finally begin to happen are</text>
  <text start="635.32" dur="7.06">there what you could call white hats or</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="4.26">alliance groups or I mean are there</text>
  <text start="642.38" dur="5.01">literally people trying to get the truth</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="5.31">out as much as they can through you know</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="4.83">as much of a mainstream to as much of a</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="4.89">mainstream audience as they can things</text>
  <text start="652.22" dur="5.7">we have to think about okay and that</text>
  <text start="654.32" dur="7.02">this is a big soft disclosure for the et</text>
  <text start="657.92" dur="5.22">presence but again there&amp;#39;s so much more</text>
  <text start="661.34" dur="3.45">that they need to tell us and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.14" dur="2.509">you know free energy technologies they</text>
  <text start="664.79" dur="3.5">need to disclose</text>
  <text start="665.649" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s 80 years of a secret space</text>
  <text start="668.29" dur="3.599">program that they need to disclose so</text>
  <text start="670.389" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s a lot of ketchup we got to do</text>
  <text start="671.889" dur="3.63">but this point is just cool because in</text>
  <text start="674.499" dur="3.84">the mainstream they&amp;#39;re trying to prep</text>
  <text start="675.519" dur="6.69">people so not only are they preppy</text>
  <text start="678.339" dur="7.74">prepping people for the aliens but this</text>
  <text start="682.209" dur="5.37">is another big revealing big like oh my</text>
  <text start="686.079" dur="2.79">gosh maybe there&amp;#39;s actually white hats</text>
  <text start="687.579" dur="3.18">in certain organizations trying to get</text>
  <text start="688.869" dur="7.741">the truth out there and I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="690.759" dur="8.25">that because on Netflix there is a new</text>
  <text start="696.61" dur="4.68">show called the keepers I believe it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="699.009" dur="5.851">documentary and it&amp;#39;s a documentary</text>
  <text start="701.29" dur="7.26">that&amp;#39;s literally exposing pedophilia and</text>
  <text start="704.86" dur="7.079">the cover-up cover-up of murder in elite</text>
  <text start="708.55" dur="8.519">circles so this is about pedophilia I</text>
  <text start="711.939" dur="8.64">believe in the Catholic realm and you</text>
  <text start="717.069" dur="6.51">know viewer discretion here but this</text>
  <text start="720.579" dur="5.43">this show is discussing this now I saw</text>
  <text start="723.579" dur="5.971">this article I saw this information I</text>
  <text start="726.009" dur="5.25">should say on your news wire calm which</text>
  <text start="729.55" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;m kind of iffy about that website</text>
  <text start="731.259" dur="4.8">sometimes it can be really clicked matey</text>
  <text start="732.85" dur="4.95">but this I went and watched the trailer</text>
  <text start="736.059" dur="5.041">for this I&amp;#39;ll link the trailer and the</text>
  <text start="737.8" dur="5.159">article down below this article they did</text>
  <text start="741.1" dur="3.959">seemed pretty legit and it was kind of</text>
  <text start="742.959" dur="4.56">sensationally but what they said in this</text>
  <text start="745.059" dur="4.231">article was that they actually mentioned</text>
  <text start="747.519" dur="3.81">one of the main players in this</text>
  <text start="749.29" dur="5.7">documentary is named Skippy or they</text>
  <text start="751.329" dur="5.94">named him Skippy which I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="754.99" dur="5.539">you&amp;#39;ve been following the pet okay</text>
  <text start="757.269" dur="5.79">shenanigans going on but one of the</text>
  <text start="760.529" dur="4.03">alleged focal point one of the focal</text>
  <text start="763.059" dur="7.351">points of the pedo gate investigations</text>
  <text start="764.559" dur="7.89">is John Podesta and his alleged run-ins</text>
  <text start="770.41" dur="3.599">and dealings with pedophilia human</text>
  <text start="772.449" dur="3.93">trafficking so they&amp;#39;re calling him</text>
  <text start="774.009" dur="5.25">Skippy John Podesta &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s nickname is</text>
  <text start="776.379" dur="4.861">Skippy okay so if this isn&amp;#39;t some type</text>
  <text start="779.259" dur="5.55">of like soft disclosure blatant in your</text>
  <text start="781.24" dur="5.039">eyeballs thing I don&amp;#39;t know what is so</text>
  <text start="784.809" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re really it looks like certain</text>
  <text start="786.279" dur="3.961">people are trying to get the truth out</text>
  <text start="787.839" dur="5.19">as much as they freakin can and I mean</text>
  <text start="790.24" dur="4.319">they don&amp;#39;t mention John Podesta in this</text>
  <text start="793.029" dur="3.66">but they do mention Skippy that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="794.559" dur="4.831">want to say so it&amp;#39;s like boom truth in</text>
  <text start="796.689" dur="4.65">your face and lots of freaking</text>
  <text start="799.39" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s a lot of revealing coming out</text>
  <text start="801.339" dur="4.951">there&amp;#39;s a lot of disinformation nonsense</text>
  <text start="804.31" dur="5.04">going on some really muddy the waters</text>
  <text start="806.29" dur="5.7">and a lot of people are exposing their</text>
  <text start="809.35" dur="5.01">agendas right now but I think we&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="811.99" dur="5.099">close to a freaking breakthrough and I</text>
  <text start="814.36" dur="7.14">think we really we&amp;#39;re over I just feel</text>
  <text start="817.089" dur="6.361">like we&amp;#39;re over a hump right on a world</text>
  <text start="821.5" dur="4.709">scale on a national scale on an</text>
  <text start="823.45" dur="6.36">individual scale I feel that some type</text>
  <text start="826.209" dur="5.401">of energetic stuff has gone on the past</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="4.26">few days to week or so where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.61" dur="6.39">really over it&amp;#39;s almost like we&amp;#39;re over</text>
  <text start="834.07" dur="5.49">that prep prep over the apex that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="838" dur="4.649">good way to describe we&amp;#39;re over the apex</text>
  <text start="839.56" dur="4.86">and breakthroughs are gonna occur and</text>
  <text start="842.649" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s gonna be hopefully a smoother</text>
  <text start="844.42" dur="6.69">sailing from here but there definitely</text>
  <text start="847.839" dur="5.101">is a revealing that&amp;#39;s going on and last</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="4.919">point I want to make in regards to all</text>
  <text start="852.94" dur="4.95">of this with these disclosures that are</text>
  <text start="856.029" dur="4.231">seeping out through the mainstream the</text>
  <text start="857.89" dur="7.86">most important thing is to make sure</text>
  <text start="860.26" dur="8.43">that we don&amp;#39;t get caught up by the chaos</text>
  <text start="865.75" dur="4.199">that&amp;#39;s going to ensue and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="868.69" dur="2.94">to I mean there&amp;#39;s good stuff&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="869.949" dur="5.961">keep rampant keep ramping keep ramping</text>
  <text start="871.63" dur="7.5">up so my main worry is that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="875.91" dur="6.039">fed a little bit of truth with a little</text>
  <text start="879.13" dur="4.5">bit of misinformation and the deep</text>
  <text start="881.949" dur="4.801">elites or whatever you want to call them</text>
  <text start="883.63" dur="4.769">are able to basically pull some kind of</text>
  <text start="886.75" dur="4.04">like partial disclosure where they only</text>
  <text start="888.399" dur="4.981">real reveal part of the narrative to</text>
  <text start="890.79" dur="4.69">satisfy us but they keep a lot secret so</text>
  <text start="893.38" dur="6.12">I&amp;#39;m not into that I&amp;#39;m into a full</text>
  <text start="895.48" dur="6.81">disclosure and there&amp;#39;s so much freaking</text>
  <text start="899.5" dur="4.35">stuff going on that I might even like I</text>
  <text start="902.29" dur="4.89">said I mentioned the live videos but I</text>
  <text start="903.85" dur="5.429">might even divvy this up into one new</text>
  <text start="907.18" dur="3.96">show being like geopolitical stuff in</text>
  <text start="909.279" dur="3.87">the other news show being just simply</text>
  <text start="911.14" dur="5.16">science like science disclosures because</text>
  <text start="913.149" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s a lot that I can&amp;#39;t fit into here</text>
  <text start="916.3" dur="4.02">and fit into a short enough video but</text>
  <text start="918.399" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;m checking out all kinds of things</text>
  <text start="920.32" dur="4.74">that they&amp;#39;re putting out in science and</text>
  <text start="922.209" dur="4.891">medical journals in the last just few</text>
  <text start="925.06" dur="4.41">days to a week and I&amp;#39;m like man right</text>
