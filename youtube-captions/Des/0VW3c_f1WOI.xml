  <text start="43.379" dur="6.601">80 degrees the mountain was right there</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="4.831">in front of our faces during the sky</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="3.66">watches that we went to every night</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="4.169">there was definitely some weird stuff in</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="4.86">the sky one of the nights we even saw</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="4.59">you know you would see the lights</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="3.629">traveling overhead they would look like</text>

  <text start="96.84" dur="4.849">nobody would be camping and this</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="6.24">mountain was 13 miles away from us so</text>
