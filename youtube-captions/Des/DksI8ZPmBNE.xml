  <text start="334.52" dur="3.72">interesting things he was saying in</text>

  <text start="372.229" dur="4.051">particular photograph of being lights in</text>

  <text start="383.06" dur="6.359">steps of good analyzing good decoding of</text>
  <text start="386.78" dur="6.21">the information and then how about that</text>
  <text start="389.419" dur="6.78">Coast Guard callsign so during Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="5.31">speech he was he went through a</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="4.141">particular part of the speeches near the</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="3.63">end where he would discuss each</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="3.48">particular branch of the military and</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="3.72">then he would have fighter jets fly</text>
  <text start="403.82" dur="4.529">overhead from that branch so he went</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="4.829">through Air Force Navy Coast Guard arm</text>
  <text start="408.349" dur="4.081">etcetera etcetera well the Coast Guard</text>
  <text start="410.479" dur="4.701">aircraft that were flying overhead it</text>
  <text start="412.43" dur="5.88">was the only craft that were actually</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="5.32">publicized with their call signs if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="3.93">describing this coherently here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="4.139">call signs were the only ones that were</text>
  <text start="422.24" dur="5.04">publicly available and the call signed</text>
  <text start="424.639" dur="7.861">to the Coast Guard aircraft that were</text>
  <text start="427.28" dur="9.24">flying overhead was endgame 20 e and D G</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="5.909">M 20 basically endgame 20 and we all</text>
  <text start="436.52" dur="6.3">know there&amp;#39;s been some really intriguing</text>
  <text start="438.409" dur="6.391">call signs on aircraft in the past</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="4.29">especially over the last year in regards</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="4.83">to q Don and the white hats and the</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.83">Alliance etcetera so in game 20 with the</text>
  <text start="449.63" dur="3.81">Coast Guard aircraft huh what a message</text>
  <text start="451.94" dur="3.15">that one is I think that&amp;#39;s what Trump</text>
  <text start="453.44" dur="3.659">was really alluding us to really wanting</text>
  <text start="455.09" dur="3.78">us to take a look at when he was</text>
  <text start="457.099" dur="2.701">mentioning the aircraft and misspelling</text>
  <text start="458.87" dur="3.45">the word aircraft</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="5.01">well what callsign did we get from one</text>
  <text start="462.32" dur="4.38">of the aircraft and game 20 huh and game</text>
  <text start="464.81" dur="3.75">soon I dig that now</text>
  <text start="466.7" dur="3.3">move on into a few other things that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="4.35">as much as I wanted to talk about in</text>
  <text start="470" dur="5.22">regards to the address and some sky</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="4.47">anomalies and maybe some misinformation</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="4.8">that some people may or may not be</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="4.65">unwittingly sharing so again be careful</text>
  <text start="480.02" dur="3.96">but nevertheless I think we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="4.14">a lot of big disclosures in regards to</text>
  <text start="483.98" dur="5.7">UFOs and space programs and whatnot</text>
  <text start="486.17" dur="5.4">coming let&amp;#39;s move on into cue we had one</text>

  <text start="498.47" dur="3.9">there and this was a totally weak hit</text>
  <text start="500.51" dur="4.56">piece it took the angle of trying to</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="6.42">attack kyun on based upon the whole JFK</text>
  <text start="505.07" dur="6.24">jr. situation and again really weak</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="5.28">article here but what I want to say</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="6.03">about it is that uh be careful going all</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="5.43">in on that JFK jr. theory and I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="517.34" dur="4.8">honest you know I&amp;#39;ve seen some fairly</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="5.76">interesting dots here and there but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="5.16">not enough to make me go public with a</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="3.66">one hundred-percent belief that JFK jr.</text>
  <text start="527.3" dur="4.47">alive is alive and is gonna come back</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="5.82">okay no it&amp;#39;s something that I&amp;#39;m keeping</text>
  <text start="531.77" dur="5.34">an arm distance hey if JFK jr. faked his</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="4.83">death and kept himself secret for a</text>
  <text start="537.11" dur="6.27">couple decades cool would that frankly</text>
  <text start="539.57" dur="6.99">surprise me not really but I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="543.38" dur="4.62">to based upon the you know non</text>
  <text start="546.56" dur="4.32">conclusive evidence that we have</text>
  <text start="548" dur="4.98">conclude that he&amp;#39;s alive and is going to</text>
  <text start="550.88" dur="3.93">come back okay and for those who are</text>
  <text start="552.98" dur="3.12">concluding it and being very public</text>
  <text start="554.81" dur="2.88">about it it&amp;#39;s just a dangerous thing to</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="3.96">do it&amp;#39;s a dangerous thing to do because</text>
  <text start="557.69" dur="5.76">it gives the fake news media ammunition</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="5.85">such as this to you know all over</text>

  <text start="582.32" dur="4.65">internet went down we had a CloudFlare</text>
  <text start="585.26" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s CloudFlare that went down and</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="4.41">few research CloudFlare one of the</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="7.05">websites that uses CloudFlare to host is</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="5.67">hn of all places 8chan so CloudFlare</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="3.69">going down meaning people across the</text>
  <text start="597.05" dur="3.66">world didn&amp;#39;t get access to each hand</text>
  <text start="599.18" dur="3.78">earlier in the week</text>
  <text start="600.71" dur="4.5">and then Wednesday the day after</text>
  <text start="602.96" dur="4.29">CloudFlare went down we had Facebook and</text>

  <text start="607.25" dur="5.67">Facebook all going down all having</text>
  <text start="609.29" dur="6.27">issues and you know to me this basically</text>
  <text start="612.92" dur="5.37">just looks like some sort of shadow</text>
  <text start="615.56" dur="6.48">cyber Civil War because Facebook and</text>
  <text start="618.29" dur="7.669">Instagram being basically DARPA CIA</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="6.51">rogue Intel created apps services</text>
  <text start="625.959" dur="4.601">platforms and we have CloudFlare which</text>
  <text start="628.55" dur="3.87">each hand hosts so I don&amp;#39;t know again</text>
  <text start="630.56" dur="3.39">this is a theory that I am telling you</text>
  <text start="632.42" dur="4.28">guys but it looks really intriguing to</text>
  <text start="633.95" dur="4.98">me and then I saw this tweet by the CIA</text>
  <text start="636.7" dur="4.81">amazingly tongue-in-cheek and will you</text>
  <text start="638.93" dur="4.08">actually understand the deeper aspects</text>
  <text start="641.51" dur="3.21">of it all it&amp;#39;s intriguing the CIA</text>
  <text start="643.01" dur="4.26">tweeted yes we are affected by the</text>
  <text start="644.72" dur="5.16">Instagram down to no we didn&amp;#39;t cause it</text>
  <text start="647.27" dur="5.7">they say and no we can&amp;#39;t fix yours</text>
  <text start="649.88" dur="4.829">no the CIA doesn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t cause it well</text>
  <text start="652.97" dur="5.22">especially when you realize that wow</text>
  <text start="654.709" dur="4.741">that Facebook and Instagram are CIA no</text>
  <text start="658.19" dur="3.45">they wouldn&amp;#39;t cause it they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.45" dur="4.62">take down their own servers little do</text>
  <text start="661.64" dur="3.81">the mass public know about these sorts</text>
  <text start="664.07" dur="3.84">of connections though but just</text>
  <text start="665.45" dur="4.35">interesting CIA tweet here I wanted to</text>

  <text start="844.639" dur="4.89">to Big Pharma so New York Times reports</text>
  <text start="846.889" dur="5.55">new weapons against cancer millions of</text>
  <text start="849.529" dur="5.071">bacteria programmed to kill so some</text>
  <text start="852.439" dur="5.851">scientists actually genetically modified</text>
  <text start="854.6" dur="6.479">bacteria to target cancer cells in your</text>
  <text start="858.29" dur="5.31">body sounds fantastic sounds like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="861.079" dur="5.191">gonna be a great breakthrough for</text>
  <text start="863.6" dur="5.07">combating cancer right</text>
  <text start="866.27" dur="4.14">oh man well number one it comes for the</text>
  <text start="868.67" dur="4.35">New York Times number two it&amp;#39;s coming</text>

  <text start="875.57" dur="5.25">GMO bacteria no I don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="878.209" dur="4.711">genetically modified bacteria in my body</text>
  <text start="880.82" dur="4.38">that just sounds like a disaster waiting</text>
  <text start="882.92" dur="4.2">to happen and also how about all of the</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="5.43">other safe and effective and cheap</text>
  <text start="887.12" dur="6.06">cancer remedies out there I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="890.63" dur="5.22">got all sorts of herbs and mushroom</text>
  <text start="893.18" dur="5.25">extracts and very cheap mineral</text>
  <text start="895.85" dur="4.13">compounds and literally just lifestyle</text>
  <text start="898.43" dur="4.56">changes I mean people out there who are</text>
  <text start="899.98" dur="5.26">helping heal diseases such as this with</text>
  <text start="902.99" dur="5.46">just lifestyle changed their particular</text>
  <text start="905.24" dur="5.76">methods which work very well so no I</text>
  <text start="908.45" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t expect any of this we see from the</text>
  <text start="911" dur="5.49">mainstream media to be well-intentioned</text>
  <text start="913.82" dur="4.079">health disclosures you know they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="916.49" dur="4.8">probably make you pay a pretty penny for</text>
  <text start="917.899" dur="5.461">it patent this GMO bacteria oh you want</text>
  <text start="921.29" dur="3.51">this fantastic new cancer cure you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="923.36" dur="2.46">going to have to pay up the ass for it</text>
  <text start="924.8" dur="3.03">and go to this pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="925.82" dur="3.57">corporation and don&amp;#39;t think about those</text>
  <text start="927.83" dur="5.249">cheap cures over there right</text>
  <text start="929.39" dur="6.66">and then lastly vaccines NBC News</text>
  <text start="933.079" dur="5.791">reports gene mutation in the brain maybe</text>
  <text start="936.05" dur="5.22">early clue to autism studies suggests</text>
  <text start="938.87" dur="3.839">with this one I mean so many things I</text>
  <text start="941.27" dur="4.009">can break down in these various articles</text>
  <text start="942.709" dur="5.82">with this one number one study suggests</text>
  <text start="945.279" dur="6.341">we know how fabricated studies can be we</text>
  <text start="948.529" dur="5.011">know that a huge amount of scientific</text>
  <text start="951.62" dur="4.29">studies across the board and this is in</text>
  <text start="953.54" dur="4.26">any area of study could be health could</text>
  <text start="955.91" dur="4.83">be physics could be history cetera et</text>
  <text start="957.8" dur="6.029">cetera as fabricated studies are</text>
  <text start="960.74" dur="5.4">fabricated so don&amp;#39;t trust him secondly</text>
  <text start="963.829" dur="5.601">gene mutation in the brain is early clue</text>
  <text start="966.14" dur="5.22">to autism well I&amp;#39;m actually not</text>
  <text start="969.43" dur="3.849">contradicting that I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="971.36" dur="4.229">as wrong but they won&amp;#39;t give you the</text>
  <text start="973.279" dur="3.601">context behind all of that what</text>
  <text start="975.589" dur="5.101">mainstream science tries to make you</text>
  <text start="976.88" dur="5.19">think these days is that we are a victim</text>
  <text start="980.69" dur="2.76">to our genes there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do</text>
  <text start="982.07" dur="3.29">about it but that&amp;#39;s actually not the</text>
  <text start="983.45" dur="4.74">case when you look into the study of</text>
  <text start="985.36" dur="4.599">epigenetics our genes actually change</text>
  <text start="988.19" dur="4.83">based upon many different factors</text>
  <text start="989.959" dur="5.281">environmental factors toxic factors our</text>
  <text start="993.02" dur="4.319">genes can change for the better if we</text>
  <text start="995.24" dur="4.17">treat ourselves better if we think</text>
  <text start="997.339" dur="2.701">better thoughts or our genes can change</text>
  <text start="999.41" dur="3.75">for the worse</text>
  <text start="1000.04" dur="5.01">if that&amp;#39;s what we allow ourselves to</text>
  <text start="1003.16" dur="4.5">basically get into the lifestyle that we</text>
  <text start="1005.05" dur="4.92">choose so yeah I could see gene</text>
  <text start="1007.66" dur="4.71">mutations being an early clue to autism</text>
  <text start="1009.97" dur="4.47">and causing autism but that begs the</text>
  <text start="1012.37" dur="4.889">question what causes the gene mutations</text>
  <text start="1014.44" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s not random it&amp;#39;s based upon our</text>
  <text start="1017.259" dur="2.731">actions and if it&amp;#39;s a gene mutation in</text>
  <text start="1019.24" dur="4.68">the brain</text>
  <text start="1019.99" dur="6.059">well what harms the brain heavy</text>
  <text start="1023.92" dur="5.159">metals especially how do these heavy</text>
  <text start="1026.049" dur="6.26">metals get into our bodies vaccines so</text>
  <text start="1029.079" dur="5.461">Wow this study is could be suggesting</text>
  <text start="1032.309" dur="2.89">could be actually pointing to the fact</text>
  <text start="1034.54" dur="3.899">that yes</text>
  <text start="1035.199" dur="6.541">vaccines play a massive part in autism</text>
  <text start="1038.439" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s just basic math ingest toxins</text>
  <text start="1041.74" dur="3.959">poisons heavy metals etc right in your</text>

  <text start="1049.66" dur="6.09">neurons in your brain it&amp;#39;s so basic but</text>
