  <text start="315.36" dur="3.51">worldwide markets how you&amp;#39;re able to see</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="3.69">things globally and how all these little</text>

  <text start="327.39" dur="4.74">get their money out and now at Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="4.08">blowing up okay so that&amp;#39;s a big problem</text>
  <text start="332.13" dur="3.65">for them too because that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="4.67">they&amp;#39;ve been laundering a lot of their</text>
  <text start="335.78" dur="4.38">is that they have cryptocurrency so</text>

  <text start="340.16" dur="3.63">devaluation in the China yuan you</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="3.84">started seeing the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="343.79" dur="5.16">Bitcoin rise rise right there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="4.95">why we went from 3,000 to 13,000 this</text>
  <text start="348.95" dur="5.34">year the Chinese owned most of the</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="6.27">mining activity and the nodes and</text>
  <text start="354.29" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;ve been buying okay and and they it</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="4.71">you give them their money outside the</text>
  <text start="360.14" dur="3.87">country immediately so if they smell</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="3.15">something going on they just take a trip</text>
  <text start="364.01" dur="4.38">to one of their subsidiaries that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="4.53">come back and other all their assets are</text>
  <text start="368.39" dur="3.6">sitting in Bitcoin where the where the</text>

  <text start="373.91" dur="4.95">that you can&amp;#39;t hustle out silver or cash</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="4.77">but Bitcoin does the press of a button</text>
  <text start="378.86" dur="4.89">and you&amp;#39;re out of there remember and or</text>
  <text start="381.53" dur="4.65">the yuan and you&amp;#39;re in the crypto and so</text>
