  <text start="8.82" dur="3.21">September 14th and let&amp;#39;s go ahead and</text>
  <text start="10.71" dur="3.599">talk about this National Solar</text>
  <text start="12.03" dur="4.53">Observatory situation so about a week</text>
  <text start="14.309" dur="5.06">ago this happened on September 6th the</text>
  <text start="16.56" dur="5.58">FBI went in and locked down and</text>
  <text start="19.369" dur="5.41">evacuated very suspiciously this whole</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="4.32">observatory in New Mexico now for the</text>
  <text start="24.779" dur="4.231">first couple days this was only reported</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="6.48">in local news but come about September</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="5.459">11th or 12th this hit the mainstream and</text>
  <text start="32.94" dur="3.63">then this story just spread like</text>
  <text start="34.469" dur="4.291">wildfire everybody began hearing about</text>
  <text start="36.57" dur="4.169">it I started seeing a lot of kind of</text>
  <text start="38.76" dur="3.75">clickbait sensationalist claims made</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="3.59">about it but of course with the lack of</text>
  <text start="42.51" dur="4.319">details we have about this situation</text>
  <text start="44.329" dur="4.151">just everybody was confused a lot of</text>
  <text start="46.829" dur="4.351">people are speculating different things</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="4.38">I went ahead and did some research into</text>
  <text start="51.18" dur="4.109">this and I want to share with you guys a</text>
  <text start="52.86" dur="3.96">lot of what I found here now before we</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="3.301">get into that I just want to talk about</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="5.309">exactly what the National Solar</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="5.01">Observatory is and where it is to give</text>
  <text start="62.129" dur="4.071">you guys a little bit of background so</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="6.42">the NSO the National Solar Observatory</text>
  <text start="66.2" dur="5.26">was originally created in the 1950s and</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="4.26">it was created by the Air Force actually</text>
  <text start="71.46" dur="5.49">it was owned and operated by the Air</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="4.229">Force to study the Sun the physics and</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="5.22">the optics of the Sun for a few decades</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="6.72">and in 1976 the NSO was passed from the</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="5.1">Air Force along to the National Science</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="4.53">Foundation and that&amp;#39;s when it became a</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="5.94">public Research Institute so since the</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="5.101">1970s this facility actually the</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="3.449">National Solar Observatory is a few</text>
  <text start="94.86" dur="3.18">facilities it&amp;#39;s actually headquartered</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="3.301">here in Boulder Colorado that I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="3.329">right now you know been thinking about</text>
  <text start="99.96" dur="3.479">just going knocking on the door and see</text>
  <text start="101.369" dur="4.921">if they can give me any details but the</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="5.581">specific facility that was evacuated was</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="5.46">located on Sacramento peak in sunspot</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="4.41">New Mexico now let&amp;#39;s take a look at this</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="3.78">particular facility and where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="4.229">located gonna bring up Google Maps here</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="5.04">so you can see this is where sunspot New</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="5.25">Mexico is that&amp;#39;s where this particular</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="4.77">facility of the National Solar</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="4.801">Observatory is operated and you can see</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="4.02">that this facility actually has its</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="3.6">facing this direction it&amp;#39;s facing west</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="4.43">and it has basically an unobstructed</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="4.459">view of Holloman Air Force</text>
  <text start="133.79" dur="4.289">base and the White Sands testing</text>
  <text start="135.769" dur="6.84">facility so keep that in mind that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="138.079" dur="6.36">very crucial piece of data to deduce</text>
  <text start="142.609" dur="3.931">what the heck is going on at this</text>
  <text start="144.439" dur="4.08">Observatory so they have an unobstructed</text>
  <text start="146.54" dur="3.66">view of Holloman Air Force Base now at</text>
  <text start="148.519" dur="3.181">Holloman Air Force Base there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="150.2" dur="4.17">lot of weird stuff going on there for</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="5.159">decades could be testing of secret</text>
  <text start="154.37" dur="5.55">weaponry secret technologies who knows</text>
  <text start="156.859" dur="7.621">but given that this Observatory faces it</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="6">keep that in mind and that being said ok</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="3.929">so you know what the National</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="5.31">Observatory is who founded it who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.409" dur="4.771">operated by now where it is let&amp;#39;s talk a</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="4.709">little bit about all the clickbait T&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.18" dur="6.179">sensationalist claims that I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="175.939" dur="6.75">come out about this situation before I</text>
  <text start="179.359" dur="4.891">tell you my own particular feelings the</text>
  <text start="182.689" dur="4.38">possibilities that I think of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.25" dur="5.97">going on here so the first thing that I</text>
  <text start="187.069" dur="5.64">began seeing just spreading like</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="5.699">wildfire sensationalist claim was that</text>
  <text start="192.709" dur="6.12">this Observatory was closed because of a</text>
  <text start="195.919" dur="5.551">geomagnetic storm I saw this reported on</text>
  <text start="198.829" dur="4.38">Zero Hedge on 9/11 they said the</text>
  <text start="201.47" dur="5.189">National Solar Observatory mysteriously</text>
  <text start="203.209" dur="5.881">closed as geomagnetic storm looms not</text>
  <text start="206.659" dur="4.92">only that but I saw say this headline in</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="4.399">the express they claimed that a super</text>
  <text start="211.579" dur="4.08">solar flare to wipe out humanity</text>
  <text start="213.489" dur="4.301">theorists fear after Solar Observatory</text>
  <text start="215.659" dur="5.491">shut down so as you can see very</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="5.159">clickbait very sensationalist but like I</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="3.6">mentioned in one of my videos in</text>
  <text start="222.949" dur="4.35">previous days if you actually check</text>
  <text start="224.75" dur="5.19">solar Hamnet one of my favorite websites</text>
  <text start="227.299" dur="5.91">to check to actually track solar weather</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="6.449">there has been no real big geomagnetic</text>
  <text start="233.209" dur="5.011">storms no super solar flare nothing of</text>
  <text start="236.389" dur="4.32">light nothing of that concern to worry</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="4.919">about so like I said clickbait</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="5.34">sensationalist don&amp;#39;t fear I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="243.139" dur="5.25">that it&amp;#39;s being evacuated and shut down</text>
  <text start="246.049" dur="5.52">because of a geomagnetic storm at this</text>
  <text start="248.389" dur="7.261">moment next thing we&amp;#39;re seeing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.569" dur="6.72">being put into the headlines to really</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="4.53">clickbait and actually discredit put out</text>
  <text start="258.289" dur="4.321">a particular narrative I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="5.25">of headlines say this alien conspiracy</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="4.65">theories swirl after FBI evacuates Space</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="4.59">Observatory and refuses to say</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="5.34">why so alien conspiracy theories this</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="4.56">one on CNET mysterious observatory</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="3.78">evacuation stirs alien conspiracy</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="4.71">theories so of course in these</text>
  <text start="276.38" dur="5.1">mainstream media propaganda outlets</text>
  <text start="279.29" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re being used or I should say this</text>
  <text start="281.48" dur="5.1">event is being used to spread that</text>
  <text start="284.48" dur="4.89">discrediting ridiculing narrative of</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="5.85">quote alien conspiracy theories so keep</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="5.64">that in mind this event is being used to</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="4.59">spread multiple narratives multiple</text>
  <text start="295.01" dur="4.11">pieces of sensationalism and clickbait</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="5.28">of course to muddy the waters to confuse</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="6.54">this all about it so when you see these</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="5.4">headlines be able to separate and</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="4.65">discern what is the misinformation</text>
  <text start="307.7" dur="5.37">what&amp;#39;s the sensationalism and what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="310.31" dur="4.5">objective truth about it okay I always</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="3.72">you know one of the things I try to do</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="4.35">on this channel is to squash that</text>
  <text start="316.79" dur="6.21">sensationalism combat themes very</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="6.15">objectively right okay now one more</text>
  <text start="323" dur="6.42">thing I want to get to peace of kind of</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="6.86">clickbait some misinformation that was</text>
  <text start="329.42" dur="5.13">put out there before I get into my own</text>
  <text start="332.17" dur="4.57">thoughts and theories and possibilities</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="6">of this I&amp;#39;ve seen this particular blog</text>
  <text start="336.74" dur="6.8">post being spread around quite a bit in</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="5.55">regards to this solar observatory</text>
  <text start="343.54" dur="5.11">evacuation situation so this blog post</text>
  <text start="346.1" dur="4.29">came out yesterday and it says six more</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="3.81">solar observatories closed and this</text>
  <text start="350.39" dur="4.71">could be the reason and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="4.29">claiming is that okay the National Solar</text>
  <text start="355.1" dur="2.66">Observatory in says about New Mexico</text>
  <text start="356.75" dur="3.84">that was shut down</text>
  <text start="357.76" dur="4.06">unfortunately this blog says it has some</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="2.97">wrong information at there it says it</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="4.23">was shut down on September 9th it was</text>
  <text start="363.56" dur="4.92">actually shut down on September 6th now</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="5.52">on September 9th we had a woman on</text>
  <text start="368.48" dur="5.49">Facebook she&amp;#39;s actually in I think she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.57" dur="3.6">in my facebook group but her photos that</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="3.99">she posted was posted to my facebook</text>
  <text start="375.17" dur="4.26">group anyway these she started sharing</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="3.81">these photographs that she took of the</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="5.94">Sun with a lot of anomalous objects in</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="5.31">it now these could be real anomalous</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="4.5">objects in these photographs photographs</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="4.77">could be legit I&amp;#39;m not quashing the</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="4.11">legitimacy of the photographs here what</text>
  <text start="391.85" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;m quashing is the connections that</text>
  <text start="393.98" dur="2.19">people are trying to make between these</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="4.65">photographs in the Solar Observatory</text>
  <text start="396.17" dur="4.89">like I said this blog post tries to say</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="2.85">that the observatory we should</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="4.79">on the 9th it was shut down on the 6th</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="5.07">these photographs came out on the 9th so</text>
  <text start="405.85" dur="3.61">what I&amp;#39;m feeling is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="3">actually unrelated a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="2.76">again getting sensationalist and</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="2.76">thinking that these photographs are</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="3.23">related to the observatory being</text>
  <text start="413.51" dur="5.55">evacuated I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the case</text>
  <text start="415.45" dur="7.77">so now let&amp;#39;s ask now that we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="419.06" dur="4.16">through all of those kind of</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="3.91">misconstrued data points that people are</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="3.87">getting right they&amp;#39;re thinking it has to</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="3.75">do with humanik storms of course the</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="2.85">alien conspiracy narratives are getting</text>
  <text start="431.21" dur="3.269">put out there a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="3.81">thinking these photographs are connected</text>
  <text start="434.479" dur="3.961">to the observatory evacuations in some</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="6.93">way but all of those things in my</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="6.06">opinion are I don&amp;#39;t want to say debunked</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="4.35">because I hate that word</text>
  <text start="444.5" dur="4.77">but they are misconstrued so what I want</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="3.75">to say so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and ask</text>
  <text start="449.27" dur="3.75">ourselves what&amp;#39;s the possibly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="4.38">possibly going on what are the</text>
  <text start="453.02" dur="5.13">possibilities and I&amp;#39;m going to speculate</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="3.389">and theorize here for you guys there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.15" dur="4.14">about three to four different</text>
  <text start="459.169" dur="5.25">possibilities that I&amp;#39;m seeing number one</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="4.65">of course something going on with the</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="5.761">Sun that they don&amp;#39;t want us to see now</text>
  <text start="466.94" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s a lot going on with the Sun that</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="4.89">they are trying to write that they</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="4.29">haven&amp;#39;t told us let&amp;#39;s just say now of</text>
  <text start="475.07" dur="3.719">course we went through solar Hamnet and</text>
  <text start="477.2" dur="3.63">showed that okay there&amp;#39;s no geomatics</text>
  <text start="478.789" dur="3.991">geomagnetic storm that&amp;#39;s luening looming</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="6.69">etc etc but it could be that they are</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="8.46">trying to prevent the viewing of the Sun</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="5.34">by various observatories and could be</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="4.11">something else going on with the Sun</text>
  <text start="492.86" dur="4.17">right I&amp;#39;m gonna reference a post I saw</text>
  <text start="495.35" dur="4.28">on each hand right here that I tweeted</text>
  <text start="497.03" dur="4.71">and it&amp;#39;s actually a list of multiple</text>
  <text start="499.63" dur="4.24">observatories that their camera feeds</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="5.82">were taken offline with and you can see</text>
  <text start="503.87" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s like 12 of them around the not</text>
  <text start="507.56" dur="2.82">just the country but the world that are</text>
  <text start="508.94" dur="3.03">getting taken offline so yeah it could</text>
  <text start="510.38" dur="3">totally be that there&amp;#39;s something going</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="3.18">on with the Sun they don&amp;#39;t want us to</text>
  <text start="513.38" dur="3.48">see there&amp;#39;s a lot of things going on</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="5.129">with the Sun we&amp;#39;re actually expecting we</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="5.669">are expecting a large solar flash or</text>
  <text start="520.279" dur="4.951">solar sneeze as it&amp;#39;s been called to</text>
  <text start="522.529" dur="5.521">occur this has everything to do with the</text>

  <text start="528.05" dur="5.039">cycles that we&amp;#39;re you know we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="4.89">into what the Age of Aquarius all of the</text>
  <text start="533.089" dur="4.771">ancient cultures were</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="4.32">our prophesizing various things going on</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="3.06">with the Sun and there&amp;#39;s actually a lot</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="4.77">of scientific evidence to show that our</text>

  <text start="547.7" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s going to be visible on solar</text>
  <text start="549.649" dur="4.68">Hamnet but who knows maybe they are</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="5.579">trying to prevent us from seeing that</text>
  <text start="554.329" dur="6.271">number two is their craft in the sky is</text>
  <text start="557.149" dur="5.341">there some sort of ETA or manmade secret</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="4.77">space program craft that&amp;#39;s being picked</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="7.26">up on these observatories that again</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="6.36">they some groups who knows what groups</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="4.2">as well we don&amp;#39;t know exactly if it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="574.88" dur="5.22">who knows but is there some craft in the</text>
  <text start="576.86" dur="5.849">sky that particular insider groups don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="5.79">want us to see very plausible in my</text>
  <text start="582.709" dur="4.861">opinion like I mentioned these</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="3.629">photographs picked up some very large</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="4.889">objects granted it was days after these</text>
  <text start="589.519" dur="6.541">observatories were taken down but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="592.459" dur="5.37">seen a lot of photographs just within</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="5.07">the past few weeks of people taking</text>
  <text start="597.829" dur="5.551">pictures of weird craft in the sky so</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="4.17">again could be one reason that many of</text>
  <text start="603.38" dur="3.99">these observatories are going offline we</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="3.51">know anytime the International Space</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="4.29">Station live feed</text>
  <text start="608.81" dur="5.58">picks up a weird craft some craft just</text>
  <text start="611.66" dur="5.609">materializes in the camera feed they</text>
  <text start="614.39" dur="5.33">instantly take that offline so again</text>
  <text start="617.269" dur="5.041">this could be one thing that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="7.09">craft up in space they don&amp;#39;t want us to</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="6.45">see number three and this one in my</text>
  <text start="626.81" dur="4.23">opinion might be the most plausible</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="3.81">again it could be a mixture of any of</text>
  <text start="631.04" dur="4.38">these possibilities that I&amp;#39;m lying out</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="4.74">to you but number three I think there</text>
  <text start="635.42" dur="4.229">could be some sort of espionage that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="4.68">going on at these observatories it could</text>
  <text start="639.649" dur="5.94">be such that some rogue Intelligence</text>
  <text start="641.99" dur="5.88">Agency or rogue group has been utilizing</text>
  <text start="645.589" dur="5.37">these observatories either for some sort</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="6.079">of communication could be communication</text>
  <text start="650.959" dur="6.141">to platforms in space</text>
  <text start="653.949" dur="6.82">secret space installations facilities</text>
  <text start="657.1" dur="5.53">craft etc etc or they&amp;#39;re using these</text>
  <text start="660.769" dur="3.93">observatories as some sort of SS</text>
  <text start="662.63" dur="3.6">intelligence gathering remember what I</text>
  <text start="664.699" dur="4.081">told you the location of this</text>
  <text start="666.23" dur="4.71">Observatory directly overlooks Hall</text>
  <text start="668.78" dur="4.05">an air force base not only that but all</text>
  <text start="670.94" dur="4.41">of these observatories around the globe</text>
  <text start="672.83" dur="4.92">I mean what if they were originally</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="4.47">created or have they been used for years</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="6.6">for intelligence gathering by rogue</text>
  <text start="679.82" dur="5.7">groups right totally plausible not only</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="3.72">intelligence gathering but like I said</text>
  <text start="685.52" dur="4.62">communication so what if many of these</text>
  <text start="688.07" dur="4.74">observatories are being shut down much</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="5.1">like the CIA satellites that were shut</text>
  <text start="692.81" dur="5.04">down by the Q team or announced by the Q</text>
  <text start="695.24" dur="4.35">team just in recent weeks this could be</text>
  <text start="697.85" dur="4.11">along the same lines of that these</text>
  <text start="699.59" dur="6.45">observatories being used by row groups</text>
  <text start="701.96" dur="5.64">by you know people who have access to</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="4.97">these secret space programs over to</text>
  <text start="707.6" dur="6">various black projects programs and</text>
  <text start="711.01" dur="3.88">their espionage their intelligence</text>
  <text start="713.6" dur="3.24">gathering is being shut off their</text>
  <text start="714.89" dur="4.68">communications being shut off by white</text>
  <text start="716.84" dur="5.34">hat groups is that a plausibility could</text>
  <text start="719.57" dur="4.41">be I think that might be the most</text>
  <text start="722.18" dur="4.92">plausible but again could be any and all</text>
  <text start="723.98" dur="6.51">of these situations that I&amp;#39;m laying out</text>
  <text start="727.1" dur="5.43">to you here so whatever the case is last</text>
  <text start="730.49" dur="5.46">point I want to make here before I go</text>
  <text start="732.53" dur="6.51">whatever the case is they want attention</text>
  <text start="735.95" dur="3.57">on this regardless because if this was a</text>
  <text start="739.04" dur="3.18">cover-up</text>
  <text start="739.52" dur="6.3">we wouldn&amp;#39;t be hearing anything about it</text>
  <text start="742.22" dur="5.49">right now this was a cover-up that they</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="4.11">could cover it up without any of it</text>
  <text start="747.71" dur="4.59">reaching the news right so just the fact</text>
  <text start="749.93" dur="4.26">that this hit the local news and then</text>
  <text start="752.3" dur="3.96">this hit the mainstream news and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="754.19" dur="4.71">seeing this reported in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="756.26" dur="5.76">as oh wow you know there&amp;#39;s a whole gag</text>
  <text start="758.9" dur="4.47">order being in place sheriffs local</text>
  <text start="762.02" dur="3.45">deputies have no idea what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="763.37" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s Black Hawk helicopters circling</text>
  <text start="765.47" dur="3.93">the place you know just the fact that</text>
  <text start="767.39" dur="6.3">this is getting into the media means</text>
  <text start="769.4" dur="5.52">that would they whoever is evacuating</text>
  <text start="773.69" dur="4.32">and shutting down these observatories</text>
  <text start="774.92" dur="5.22">want this to be known they want eyes on</text>
  <text start="778.01" dur="4.89">this right it&amp;#39;s a really bad cover-up</text>
  <text start="780.14" dur="5.01">right that being said they want</text>
  <text start="782.9" dur="4.65">attention on it so I think whatever is</text>
  <text start="785.15" dur="5.01">going to manifest out of this situation</text>
  <text start="787.55" dur="4.2">out of this story whether we do hear</text>
  <text start="790.16" dur="3.39">about some stuff going on with the Sun</text>
  <text start="791.75" dur="3.66">whether we do hear about some sort of</text>
  <text start="793.55" dur="4.35">craft or things in the sky from whoever</text>
  <text start="795.41" dur="4.92">whether this man-made craft or et craft</text>
  <text start="797.9" dur="4.62">or whether it is some sort of espionage</text>
  <text start="800.33" dur="4.86">or deeper things going on with these</text>
  <text start="802.52" dur="5.79">servitor &amp;#39;is that aren&amp;#39;t just to study</text>
  <text start="805.19" dur="5.01">the Sun what if it is to gather</text>
  <text start="808.31" dur="4.89">intelligence or to communicate by rogue</text>
  <text start="810.2" dur="5.52">groups whatever it is any and all of</text>
  <text start="813.2" dur="5.46">those three or more they want us to know</text>
  <text start="815.72" dur="4.44">they want to pique people&amp;#39;s interests</text>
  <text start="818.66" dur="3.57">they want people to start getting</text>
  <text start="820.16" dur="4.26">curious and paying attention to the Sun</text>
  <text start="822.23" dur="3.99">to what&amp;#39;s going on in outer space and to</text>
  <text start="824.42" dur="2.97">these observatories so anyway that&amp;#39;s all</text>
