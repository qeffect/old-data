  <text start="92.159" dur="5.491">definitely a much younger yes like last</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="4.41">year there was a bit there was a bit of</text>
  <text start="97.65" dur="10.969">a more older crowd the numbers were</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="8.689">still big it was yeah and especially</text>
  <text start="109.61" dur="4.39">awesome you&amp;#39;re really targeting kind of</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="3.81">a younger audience with the articles you</text>
  <text start="114" dur="3.63">write everything is going on and I love</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="3.12">the fact that you guys have the</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="3.089">disclosure narrative in there it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="3.659">you said it&amp;#39;s the biggest issue that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="3.871">plaguing us we have trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="3.061">that are missing literally missing we</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="2.819">have technologies that are out there</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="4.35">that are very real that have been real</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="4.171">for decades that have been suppressed so</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="2.58">tell me it tell me a little bit about</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="2.31">your thoughts on that tell me about what</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="3.15">you think that</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="6.42">next couple years in tales of how</text>
  <text start="135.87" dur="5.85">disclosure is gonna go there&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="2.52">been like a million and one theories on</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="2.31">this there&amp;#39;s been so many people who</text>
  <text start="142.83" dur="3.3">talked about it all we can do is</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="4.32">speculate yeah I want your speculation I</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="3.78">know some people get you know they get</text>
  <text start="148.35" dur="3.63">flack for throwing dates out there those</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="4.5">dates come and go but I just want you</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="6.18">know zero flight zero judgment zone</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="8.19">we&amp;#39;re in a safe place a safe place I</text>
  <text start="158.16" dur="6.12">think in reality the pizzelle you know</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="3.15">what I&amp;#39;ll do I&amp;#39;ll speak about up in the</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="3.06">position of like what we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="4.02">producing in terms of we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="3.48">producing a series that is going to be</text>
  <text start="169.77" dur="4.41">looking at what life could look like</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="5.25">after disclosure alright so in that what</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="4.11">the way we&amp;#39;re approaching it is we feel</text>
  <text start="176.07" dur="3.15">that at the end of the day regardless of</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="2.64">dates that&amp;#39;s not whatever</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="3.6">when humanity&amp;#39;s consciousness is ready</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="3.39">for this stuff to come out and for it to</text>
  <text start="182.82" dur="2.91">be it when I say that like for example</text>
  <text start="184.32" dur="3.24">free energy everybody knows if you look</text>
  <text start="185.73" dur="3.27">at the you know secret patent laws if</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="2.34">you look at you know the technologies</text>
  <text start="189" dur="2.91">have been out there everybody probably</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="3.63">knows somebody who&amp;#39;s met somebody who</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="3.329">had a device or who you know had</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="3.15">something with it I&amp;#39;ve met I&amp;#39;ve met</text>
  <text start="195.239" dur="3.181">somebody than making one so absolutely</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="3.66">we and we work with a company that</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="6">actually has one that is going to be</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="6.03">deployed like very very shortly and so</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re there but why has it</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="3.39">not hit you know human conscious why has</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="3.03">it why has it not hit like you know the</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="2.61">infrastructure what is what is holding</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="3.87">back and it&amp;#39;s human consciousness</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="4.679">because with these technologies it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="4.5">very easy like if someone just released</text>
  <text start="217.049" dur="4.621">free energy it could be very very simple</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="4.229">for very powerful people to get it hoard</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="4.23">it you know and not just shelve it but</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="4.261">hoard it and and then charge people for</text>
  <text start="225.9" dur="4.77">it in a way that is not what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="3.53">designed for yeah right so when humanity</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="3.03">gets to a point where we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="3.79">infrastructurally are beyond this need</text>
  <text start="233.7" dur="3.89">for all we need money we need this we</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="5.1">need to do that Baba we got to like you</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="5.05">know you have a group of people that are</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="3.42">hoarding that&amp;#39;s when it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="3.09">start to come out a lot more what does</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="3.36">that look like I mean it&amp;#39;s all up to us</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="4.259">at the end of the day it comes up to us</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s like when we begin to actually take</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="3.961">control of this situation and look hey</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="3.54">change is gonna happen by us changing</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="3.06">within that is the focus when you come</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="3.27">to an event like this you learn from</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="3.509">people who are deep in this field who</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="2.85">are diving into the exciting stuff</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="3.181">that&amp;#39;s happening but then you got to</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="3.45">turn it back to you what am I gonna do</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="3.98">and take away with this information you</text>
  <text start="265.2" dur="3.95">can&amp;#39;t wait you don&amp;#39;t want to sit around</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="3.209">for this stuff to happen you want to</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="4.2">think within yourself how can I be part</text>
  <text start="270.889" dur="3.78">of it not just physically in this world</text>
  <text start="273.35" dur="3.15">of like going and doing things but</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="4.351">within the shifts I&amp;#39;m creating within</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="4.199">myself that to me is is the most</text>
  <text start="279.02" dur="3.81">important aspect of this entire thing</text>
  <text start="280.699" dur="3.331">and anybody can do I mean anybody can</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="2.64">use their creative talents no matter</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="2.52">what avenue is whether you make videos</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="2.819">whether you write articles whether</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="3.66">you&amp;#39;re building a business that does</text>
  <text start="288.289" dur="3.63">both or whether you just want to talk to</text>
  <text start="290.21" dur="3.87">your friends and family do artwork do</text>
  <text start="291.919" dur="4.231">something to bring your creative nature</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="3.54">out but use it to advance the</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="3.78">consciousness and that&amp;#39;s the big thing</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="3.93">is that you said action of actions huge</text>
