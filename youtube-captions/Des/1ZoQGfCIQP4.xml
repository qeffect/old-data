  <text start="106.24" dur="6.33">disseminator of information regarding</text>
  <text start="108.9" dur="6.76">secret space programs and ETS in the</text>
  <text start="112.57" dur="7.17">whole UFO topic you know he was out</text>
  <text start="115.66" dur="8.4">there disclosing so much and helping us</text>
  <text start="119.74" dur="7.29">piece together so many dots about that</text>
  <text start="124.06" dur="6.86">topic you know for a short kind of life</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="6.6">synopsis on who William Tompkins is he</text>
  <text start="130.92" dur="5.68">lived in Long Beach when he was really</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="5.28">young he passed away last year mind you</text>
  <text start="136.6" dur="6.21">at the age of 94 so he&amp;#39;s had a long life</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="6.96">and he lived in Long Beach in the 1930s</text>
  <text start="142.81" dur="5.22">and 40s and really what happened is that</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="4.8">he was born with a natural gift a gift</text>
  <text start="148.03" dur="4.769">of visualization a gift of art and</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="4.17">design and what he would do when he was</text>
  <text start="152.799" dur="4.231">a young boy is he would go to Long Beach</text>
  <text start="154.84" dur="4.679">Harbor and he would tour the Navy ships</text>
  <text start="157.03" dur="5.4">and then he would make scale models of</text>
  <text start="159.519" dur="4.951">the naval ships in the harbor there just</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="5.76">based upon his own sketches and drawings</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="6.06">and his his remembrance of what they</text>
  <text start="168.19" dur="5.07">looked like during the tours and his</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="6.41">designs were so amazing</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="6.72">at a very young age that they got</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="5.32">featured in a storefront there on</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="4.05">Hollywood Boulevard right and then one</text>
  <text start="182.26" dur="3.3">day a couple of naval intelligence</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="2.87">officers were walking down the street</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="3.62">and they see these</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="4.289">scale models of naval ships in the</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="4.83">storefront there and they were shocked</text>
  <text start="191.189" dur="4.44">because they saw classified systems like</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="5.28">radar systems and weapon systems on</text>
  <text start="195.629" dur="6.06">these scale models so they figured it</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="3.99">had to have been a spy or something that</text>
  <text start="201.689" dur="3.841">made these so they ended up</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="3.539">interrogating the store owner which was</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="2.67">William Tompkins dad</text>
  <text start="206.819" dur="2.581">they literally interrogated him for a</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="2.819">couple of days and found out well it</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="4.11">wasn&amp;#39;t a Japanese spy or anything it was</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="5.461">just young William Tompkins their young</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="5.58">boy I think he was nine ten eleven you</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="4.11">know very young so they ended up finding</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="3.44">out it was him and these naval</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="5.819">intelligence officers basically the Navy</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="6.129">recruited him kind of groomed him out of</text>
  <text start="226.409" dur="4.08">high school and he ended up going into</text>
  <text start="228.659" dur="3.3">the service right out of high school and</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="4.801">that was during the times of World War</text>
  <text start="231.959" dur="5.581">two and very top levels of the Navy</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="6.05">knew about Tompkins because they knew</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="6.39">about his skills they knew about his</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="3.009">witnessing of the Battle of LA event as</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="2.13">well</text>

  <text start="246.06" dur="5.31">mass UFO sighting in Long Beach in 1942</text>
  <text start="249.349" dur="4.931">very important thing to look up and</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="5.369">understand because the Army and the Navy</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="4.889">were actually able to recover a couple</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="4.201">ET drones try to reverse-engineer them</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="4.831">anyway William Tompkins was a witness to</text>
