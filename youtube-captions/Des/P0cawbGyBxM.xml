  <text start="21.359" dur="3.901">really be of benefit to you so if you</text>

  <text start="51.51" dur="4.31">discuss with you today especially in</text>
  <text start="53.73" dur="4.5">regards to gold will talk about the</text>
  <text start="55.82" dur="4.6">comparisons between cryptocurrency and</text>
  <text start="58.23" dur="3.78">gold and whatnot but before we get into</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="4.949">all that I want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="5.01">comparisons between gold and our paper</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="4.68">fiat currency that we&amp;#39;re currently</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="6.599">dealing with of course so discuss with</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="6">us the pros to purchasing and investing</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="3.841">in gold as opposed to putting our money</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="5.61">in the stock market like we&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="6.51">told I&amp;#39;d love to it&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="4.5">thing you know we talked about fiat</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="3.87">currency and and that&amp;#39;s really all we</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="2.64">know that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been told for</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="4.56">generations</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="4.741">you know dollar dollars the king you got</text>
  <text start="92.4" dur="2.399">to be in the stock market because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="3.539">the only way you&amp;#39;re gonna save for your</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.591">retirement it&amp;#39;s the only way you have to</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="5.881">make any money but really what you have</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="5.4">there is a scenario where the</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="4.979">government&amp;#39;s trying to enforce the use</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="5.34">of the dollar because we the dollars</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="4.171">have a hegemony in the world as the</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="4.919">reserve currency and they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="5.07">lose that so anytime you invest in</text>
  <text start="115.049" dur="4.021">something that&amp;#39;s not dollar related like</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="6.18">stocks and bonds and things like that</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="5.939">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a form of non faith showing</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="3.84">non faith in the government and the</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="6.511">central reserve and how they&amp;#39;re handling</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="5.91">our economy mm-hmm so we look at them</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="4.2">for those of us who have</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="4.26">some thought we think wait a minute what</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="3.99">else is there and and this is where gold</text>
  <text start="137.37" dur="3.63">comes in and cryptocurrencies too and</text>
  <text start="139.71" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ll make a correlation there you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="141" dur="5.67">you&amp;#39;ll see why they&amp;#39;re not so dissimilar</text>
  <text start="143.49" dur="6.45">but gold has been the store of wealth</text>
  <text start="146.67" dur="6.78">for 5000 plus years it&amp;#39;s always had</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="5.07">value it&amp;#39;s never gone bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s an important thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="7.77">a hedge against inflation and against</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="6.21">the banking system mm-hm when you have</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="4.71">metals you have something that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="6.42">to offset the loss that you&amp;#39;re told is</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="5.91">acceptable and that&amp;#39;s why we people have</text>
  <text start="171.3" dur="3.9">for occurred you know years and years</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="4.77">and you know hundreds of years thousands</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="7.14">of years had gold and silver that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="6.569">ultimate form of currency so you may ask</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="5.01">how do I lose money by being in dollars</text>
  <text start="184.739" dur="6.991">it&amp;#39;s really simple</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="7.2">one word inflation that is the killer of</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="5.25">anyone who saves any money where it</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="5.61">plans to save so they can live their</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="5.52">retirement as well as if not better than</text>
  <text start="200.16" dur="4.859">when they were working and inflation is</text>
  <text start="202.5" dur="4.53">at an amazingly high rate I mean the</text>
  <text start="205.019" dur="5.461">paper dollar has lost 99 percent of its</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="5.85">value in the last hundred years exactly</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="5.88">so when you and and that&amp;#39;s the key point</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="5.25">right there we don&amp;#39;t you know we think</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re trained to think we need to have</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="4.26">dollars in our account we want as many</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="3.96">dollars as possible but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="4.11">really what we want we want the</text>
  <text start="224.64" dur="4.05">purchasing power of that dollar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="5.16">what&amp;#39;s really important to us what can</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="6.21">we do with it and what inflation does is</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="5.07">it steals that purchasing power this is</text>
  <text start="234.9" dur="3.24">why and I&amp;#39;m getting up there in that age</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="3.09">now where we&amp;#39;ve all heard our</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="6.12">grandfather say I could buy that low for</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="6.03">bread for a nickel that&amp;#39;s inflation and</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="4.08">what we really care about is that loaf</text>
  <text start="245.85" dur="4.59">of bread not the nickel so much but that</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="5.429">loaf of bread because now that loaf of</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="6.24">bread is three dollars and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="4.801">perfect example of inflation and this is</text>
  <text start="256.68" dur="3.63">why it&amp;#39;s so hard for people to plan for</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="4.529">retirement because they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="5.359">things will cost but here&amp;#39;s the great</text>
  <text start="263.099" dur="3.901">thing when you look at gold and silver</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="5.021">they</text>
  <text start="267" dur="7.47">inflation what a loaf of bread costs now</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="9.15">is equal in gold as it what it was in</text>
  <text start="274.47" dur="6.84">the 1900s so if you had gold to replace</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="3.84">those dollars you have the same</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="8.34">purchasing power which is what we really</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="7.83">care about that&amp;#39;s how you offset the</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="3.24">effects of inflation and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="3.81">everyone should have some precious</text>
  <text start="292.89" dur="5.49">metals you know what you keep it in a</text>
  <text start="295.32" dur="5.34">safe at home whether you take an IRA</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="4.17">that you have an old 401k that you have</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="4.92">and you invest that in the precious</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="4.56">metals that&amp;#39;s gonna give you that safety</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="3.839">net that&amp;#39;s gonna give you that hedge</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="3.87">that gives you the same purchasing power</text>
  <text start="309.419" dur="5.25">for things so that you can live your</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="5.91">retirement as you want it to and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.669" dur="5.101">the difference between gold and silver</text>
  <text start="316.89" dur="4.92">if I may ask which one would you prefer</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="4.47">to go to or what&amp;#39;s your thoughts on that</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="3.93">you know I typically tell people to</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="3.09">diversify amongst the metals as well</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="3.6">they should have something gold and some</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="4.95">silver but it really depends on each</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="5.49">individual well we do here is we take a</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="4.139">personal approach someone you know gets</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="3.089">in contact with us and they want to get</text>
  <text start="336.419" dur="3.931">themselves protected and diversified</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="4.741">we&amp;#39;re gonna spend time with them and see</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="4.44">what risk temperament they have what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.66" dur="4.55">their objectives and from that we create</text>
  <text start="344.79" dur="4.71">a portfolio that will fit their needs</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="3.64">that&amp;#39;s the important thing is this</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="3.33">investment should work for you and</text>
  <text start="350.85" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s where we really focus on and</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s one of our specialties is being</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="3.39">able to to get in there and have</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="4.92">conversations with people and get them</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="4.86">protected for themselves so if our</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="4.35">economy were to have another giant</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="4.8">bubble burst and somebody would have a</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="4.8">large investment in a precious metal</text>
  <text start="367.35" dur="5.96">stash instead of the stock market they</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="7.62">would be much much better off absolutely</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="7.3">great great classic example there before</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="5.429">the the collapse in 2007 and before the</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="4.71">collapse in 2000 and before the collapse</text>
  <text start="382.919" dur="5.161">in 1992 you know there&amp;#39;s a cycle to</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="6.14">these bubbles that burst with real</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="7.04">estate or stocks or whatever you know</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="7.6">gold was sitting at about $600 an ounce</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="4.66">all right on the build-up to the 2007</text>
  <text start="399.06" dur="2.67">collapse</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="3.81">after we saw that pull back in the</text>
  <text start="401.73" dur="4.53">market and we saw that devastation that</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="3.93">happened gold actually reached $1,900 an</text>
  <text start="406.26" dur="4.98">ounce Wow</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="5.79">so exactly so if people had had a</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="4.14">portion of their investments in precious</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="4.47">metals yes they lost big in the stock</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="4.68">market but that gold offset that loss</text>
  <text start="417.78" dur="4.71">and that&amp;#39;s that protection that we</text>
  <text start="420.06" dur="4.62">talked about mm-hmm keeps your</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="4.8">purchasing power because now you have</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="6.6">your same valuations in fact those who</text>
  <text start="427.29" dur="5.67">had gold did better that&amp;#39;s awesome the</text>
  <text start="431.28" dur="3.32">gain in the gold was greater than the</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="5.61">loss in the stock market</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="7.96">cool cool so with that being said Gold</text>
  <text start="438.57" dur="6.84">being a great plan in case a bubble were</text>
  <text start="442.56" dur="5.82">to burst or a great option to invest in</text>
  <text start="445.41" dur="5.78">a lot of people are now also investing</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="5.039">in cryptocurrency so can discuss the</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="5.34">pros and cons and differences between</text>
  <text start="453.419" dur="6.541">either investing in gold or investing in</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="5.53">cryptocurrency absolutely and just so</text>
  <text start="459.96" dur="3.959">you know that you know as an alternative</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="3.87">asset firm we deal in both precious</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="4.861">metals and crypto currencies okay and</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="4.98">they are both available for your IRA so</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="3.99">when you&amp;#39;re looking at them one of the</text>
  <text start="470.91" dur="3.78">big differences that people see with</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="3.99">when they first look at it as gold is</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="4.74">this tangible asset you can hold it you</text>
  <text start="476.76" dur="5.31">can feel it you can store it the</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="4.2">cryptocurrency is their virtual so for</text>
  <text start="482.07" dur="3.93">those of us are a little bit more gray</text>
  <text start="483.63" dur="5.34">in the beard we may not understand those</text>
  <text start="486" dur="5.82">crypto currencies as much so that</text>
  <text start="488.97" dur="5.43">difference is that tangibility and that</text>
  <text start="491.82" dur="5.22">longevity and gold there&amp;#39;s been a value</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="5.19">for like I said 5,000 plus years crypto</text>
  <text start="497.04" dur="4.23">currencies are new sometimes new scares</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="4.56">people and then there&amp;#39;s a virtual</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="5.58">embrace it so one of the big differences</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="6.69">in this virtual world versus this</text>
  <text start="506.85" dur="5.58">tangible world they both operate on the</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="3.54">same principles though because if you</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="4.799">look at what the crypto currencies are</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="5.52">there are people who say I don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="517.229" dur="5.641">the banking system I don&amp;#39;t trust the</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="7.79">government mm-hmm I want someplace else</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="9.36">to store my money it&amp;#39;s the same same</text>
  <text start="527.69" dur="5.8">need different vehicle awesome</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="3.96">and that being said I mean</text>
  <text start="533.49" dur="5.19">cryptocurrency seems like an amazing</text>
  <text start="536.19" dur="5.04">resource for lots of different reasons</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="5.55">less than ways but the fact that we live</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="5.55">in the digital age if our power systems</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="4.59">were to just go down very likely</text>
  <text start="546.78" dur="3.99">occurrence we would still have that</text>
  <text start="548.82" dur="3.96">tangible object there that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="550.77" dur="3.5">benefits that I see and that&amp;#39;s one thing</text>
  <text start="552.78" dur="4.01">that scares me about cryptocurrency is</text>
  <text start="554.27" dur="5.89">you know any kind of electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="6.16">attack or pulse or anything to that</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="6.33">effect shutting down our power systems</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="5.82">still have hope and it lets say the</text>
  <text start="566.49" dur="5.49">worst case happens it&amp;#39;s not an EMP let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.77" dur="6.57">just say suddenly solar flare could be</text>
  <text start="571.98" dur="4.86">the Sun coming off I mean something less</text>
  <text start="575.34" dur="3.56">natural maybe the government decides to</text>
  <text start="576.84" dur="3.84">shut down all the Internet oh very true</text>
  <text start="578.9" dur="4.45">then you&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="6.21">mm-hmm I mean Angie will be very</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="5.19">important then that is and I mean would</text>
  <text start="586.89" dur="4.62">there that being said would there be any</text>
  <text start="588.54" dur="5.91">way for them to dip their hands into the</text>
  <text start="591.51" dur="5.16">gold stash by any means great question</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="5.73">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of talk about</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="5.85">what happened in 1932 1933 when the</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="4.77">United States government you&amp;#39;ll hear</text>
  <text start="602.52" dur="3.96">words like they confiscated gold it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.95" dur="3.33">really what happened but what happened</text>
  <text start="606.48" dur="3.78">at the time is that the United States</text>
  <text start="608.28" dur="4.38">was actually on a gold standard our</text>
  <text start="610.26" dur="5.55">dollar was backed by gold and silver</text>
  <text start="612.66" dur="5.55">that was the value of the paper because</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="4.02">there was so much gold held in deposit</text>
  <text start="618.21" dur="3.06">and you could actually redeem that</text>
  <text start="619.83" dur="5.13">currency for that gold or silver</text>
  <text start="621.27" dur="5.7">equivalent so when we had the Great</text>
  <text start="624.96" dur="4.08">Depression and we had to come out of it</text>
  <text start="626.97" dur="3.87">they did something very similar to what</text>
  <text start="629.04" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ve done recently is they started</text>
  <text start="630.84" dur="4.44">spending money they started pushing</text>
  <text start="632.52" dur="4.95">money out into the system to do that</text>
  <text start="635.28" dur="4.08">they had to take the backing away from</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="4.89">gold and silver because gold and silver</text>
  <text start="639.36" dur="4.41">is a finite amount totally right but</text>
  <text start="642.36" dur="4.41">they needed to print more than what was</text>
  <text start="643.77" dur="5.88">available so they said okay turn in your</text>
  <text start="646.77" dur="4.8">gold for this paper you&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="649.65" dur="3.96">this $20 bill instead of that $20 gold</text>
  <text start="651.57" dur="4.44">coin and they were allowed to do it</text>
  <text start="653.61" dur="6.14">because that gold coin was minted by the</text>
  <text start="656.01" dur="6.9">United States government so I need a</text>
  <text start="659.75" dur="5.32">currency change but is there a way for</text>
  <text start="662.91" dur="4.59">them to take it not without them paying</text>
  <text start="665.07" dur="4.32">you for it gotcha</text>
  <text start="667.5" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s very similar to the eminent domain</text>
  <text start="669.39" dur="3.81">we all hear stories of how you know the</text>
  <text start="672" dur="3.03">government came in and bought someone</text>
  <text start="673.2" dur="2.97">else&amp;#39;s property then they were mad</text>
  <text start="675.03" dur="3.06">because they didn&amp;#39;t want to sell it but</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="4.02">they didn&amp;#39;t just steal it they did pay</text>
  <text start="678.09" dur="3.78">for it it may not have like the value</text>
  <text start="680.19" dur="3.63">they paid for it but they did pay you</text>
  <text start="681.87" dur="3.21">for it and gold&amp;#39;s very similar if they</text>
  <text start="683.82" dur="3.63">decided to come in and take it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.08" dur="5.61">gonna have to pay you for it gotcha</text>
  <text start="687.45" dur="4.56">gotcha so if somebody were to want to</text>
  <text start="690.69" dur="3.57">start investing in precious precious</text>
  <text start="692.01" dur="5.43">metals whether they had money invested</text>
  <text start="694.26" dur="4.5">in stocks or money invested elsewhere</text>
  <text start="697.44" dur="4.11">and they want to move that precious</text>
  <text start="698.76" dur="5.4">metals how would your company noble gold</text>
  <text start="701.55" dur="5.88">be able to assist them in that great</text>
  <text start="704.16" dur="5.31">question what we we do is especially if</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s in an IRA IRA is going to be very</text>
  <text start="709.47" dur="2.79">intimidating if you&amp;#39;re trying to fill</text>
  <text start="710.85" dur="3.93">out the paperwork yourself to get it</text>
  <text start="712.26" dur="4.98">done I have a team here that will help</text>

  <text start="720.99" dur="4.83">tax free so they&amp;#39;ll be no tax</text>
  <text start="723.18" dur="3.99">consequences to move your funds which is</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="4.38">important you don&amp;#39;t want to pay any more</text>
  <text start="727.17" dur="4.92">taxes than necessary so we can do that</text>
  <text start="730.2" dur="3.69">and help you get that converted over and</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="3.51">at that point purchase the precious</text>
  <text start="733.89" dur="2.97">metals or the cryptocurrency if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="735.6" dur="5.73">what you&amp;#39;re looking for you have the</text>
  <text start="736.86" dur="9.69">option on both beautiful and then also</text>
  <text start="741.33" dur="6.84">what is your speculation bad bad thing</text>
  <text start="746.55" dur="3.84">to do sometimes but I mean people</text>
  <text start="748.17" dur="6.12">looking to invest are looking for growth</text>
  <text start="750.39" dur="5.85">and cryptocurrency on one hand it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="754.29" dur="4.53">volatile but it&amp;#39;s been growing a lot</text>
  <text start="756.24" dur="4.8">over the past couple years what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="758.82" dur="3.69">comparison in growth to precious metals</text>
  <text start="761.04" dur="3.63">what can people expect</text>
  <text start="762.51" dur="4.5">investing in noble gold and what can</text>
  <text start="764.67" dur="4.23">they expect with growth they&amp;#39;re great</text>
  <text start="767.01" dur="3.99">you know and that&amp;#39;s a great question</text>
  <text start="768.9" dur="3.48">the crypto currencies it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the new</text>
  <text start="771" dur="3.84">ride at the amusement park you know</text>
  <text start="772.38" dur="4.56">everyone&amp;#39;s lined up for it but when you</text>
  <text start="774.84" dur="5.37">look at your precious metals you can see</text>
  <text start="776.94" dur="6.57">a 10% return annualized overtime mm-hm</text>
  <text start="780.21" dur="4.92">okay it&amp;#39;s consistent growth and that has</text>
  <text start="783.51" dur="3.21">a lot to do with that inflation that we</text>
  <text start="785.13" dur="4.59">talked about and the constant</text>
  <text start="786.72" dur="5.1">devaluation of the dollar so and I like</text>
  <text start="789.72" dur="4.35">to say this for people too if you think</text>
  <text start="791.82" dur="4.17">the dollar is fine and the economy here</text>
  <text start="794.07" dur="3.87">is just fine you don&amp;#39;t need any of this</text>
  <text start="795.99" dur="3.18">you don&amp;#39;t need the crypto currencies or</text>
  <text start="797.94" dur="3.929">you don&amp;#39;t need the gold</text>
  <text start="799.17" dur="5.49">if you don&amp;#39;t believe we&amp;#39;re on that solid</text>
  <text start="801.869" dur="4.56">footing then that&amp;#39;s exactly why you</text>
  <text start="804.66" dur="3.649">wanted gotcha</text>
  <text start="806.429" dur="3.12">so it might even be wise to invest</text>
  <text start="808.309" dur="3.671">everywhere</text>
  <text start="809.549" dur="5.15">both you know on the internet crypto</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="5.459">currency and with tangible products</text>
  <text start="814.699" dur="4.93">diversity is so important and a lot of</text>
  <text start="817.439" dur="3.81">our clients will do that with this wild</text>
  <text start="819.629" dur="3.75">ride we&amp;#39;ve seen in the crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="821.249" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;ve had some customers who&amp;#39;ve gone up</text>
  <text start="823.379" dur="4.68">ridiculous percentages in a short period</text>
  <text start="825.54" dur="3.269">of time and they&amp;#39;ll come to us and say</text>
  <text start="828.059" dur="4.32">what do we do now</text>
  <text start="828.809" dur="5.58">it but almost saying my grandfather told</text>
  <text start="832.379" dur="5.94">me you never go broke taking a profit</text>
  <text start="834.389" dur="6">okay so what we&amp;#39;ll do is if they&amp;#39;re of</text>
  <text start="838.319" dur="3.781">that mindset we&amp;#39;ll we reduce some of the</text>
  <text start="840.389" dur="4.5">crypto currency they hold we&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="842.1" dur="3.899">some profits off and a good portion of</text>
  <text start="844.889" dur="4.651">the time they&amp;#39;ll invest that in the</text>
  <text start="845.999" dur="5.971">precious metals then we&amp;#39;ll continue to</text>
  <text start="849.54" dur="5.19">accumulate metals based on the returns</text>
  <text start="851.97" dur="5.279">of crypto currencies that sounds like a</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="3.689">pretty good plan not too bad yes miss</text>
  <text start="857.249" dur="3.06">especially when you&amp;#39;re doing it in your</text>
  <text start="858.419" dur="4.14">IRA because that&amp;#39;s a tax-free event</text>
  <text start="860.309" dur="3.9">because that&amp;#39;s a tax deferred account so</text>
  <text start="862.559" dur="3.301">you&amp;#39;re not paying that capital gains on</text>
  <text start="864.209" dur="4.23">that the gain you had in the crypto</text>
