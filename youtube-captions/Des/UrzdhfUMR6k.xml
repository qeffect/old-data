  <text start="1525.73" dur="4.74">should know what compartmentalization is</text>
  <text start="1527.5" dur="4.65">so sure he might be able to control this</text>
  <text start="1530.47" dur="3.9">network or that network on the NSA or</text>
  <text start="1532.15" dur="4.02">CIA but doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s gonna be able</text>
