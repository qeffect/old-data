  <text start="675.309" dur="4.44">that oh yeah UFO sightings have just</text>
  <text start="677.8" dur="2.819">dropped off a cliff and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="679.749" dur="2.58">getting them anymore</text>
  <text start="680.619" dur="7.32">I don&amp;#39;t believe that at all I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="682.329" dur="11.401">all sorts of videos and on Facebook and</text>
  <text start="687.939" dur="8.37">YouTube etc of sightings and - I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="693.73" dur="7.709">my own sightings past few months - so I</text>
  <text start="696.309" dur="7.411">don&amp;#39;t believe about that sightings are</text>
  <text start="701.439" dur="4.02">not on the not on the decline only</text>
  <text start="703.72" dur="4.589">reporting somebody said totally I</text>
  <text start="705.459" dur="4.47">believe that and they probably want you</text>
  <text start="708.309" dur="3.661">to think that UFO sightings are on the</text>
  <text start="709.929" dur="7.681">decline don&amp;#39;t they they want you to get</text>
  <text start="711.97" dur="9.39">this stuff out of your head whoo where&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="717.61" dur="11.959">my mods looks like we need some mods in</text>
  <text start="721.36" dur="8.209">this room let&amp;#39;s see here let me do some</text>
  <text start="730.679" dur="4.26">troll cleansing real quick there we go</text>
  <text start="735.66" dur="10.06">talk structured water ooh that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="738.73" dur="9.839">topic so structured water yeah where do</text>
  <text start="745.72" dur="4.649">we even start with that one so I guess I</text>
  <text start="748.569" dur="4.05">could say that when it comes to water</text>
  <text start="750.369" dur="3.601">all the water we drink out of bottles</text>
  <text start="752.619" dur="4.02">and taps and all that it is literally</text>
  <text start="753.97" dur="4.89">dead dead water look at dr. Emoto</text>
  <text start="756.639" dur="5.901">studies and his studies showed that</text>
  <text start="758.86" dur="6.479">water is a I mean it&amp;#39;s an electrical</text>
  <text start="762.54" dur="4.599">conductive substance but not only that</text>
  <text start="765.339" dur="3.391">it holds our intentions because your</text>
  <text start="767.139" dur="4.351">thoughts are electric your thoughts have</text>
  <text start="768.73" dur="6.24">an electromagnetic nature to them and it</text>
  <text start="771.49" dur="7.73">extends outside of your head okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="774.97" dur="4.25">the phenomena of consciousness there so</text>
  <text start="779.61" dur="6.189">when talking structured water you can</text>
  <text start="782.47" dur="8.19">structure water with various mechanisms</text>
  <text start="785.799" dur="7.89">you can use orgonite or crystals things</text>
  <text start="790.66" dur="5.459">like that but you can also use three</text>
  <text start="793.689" dur="4.61">dimensional physics toroidal physics and</text>
  <text start="796.119" dur="6.481">by that I mean you can actually find</text>
  <text start="798.299" dur="7.361">devices that you can run water</text>
  <text start="802.6" dur="5.599">through that vortex that water at very</text>
  <text start="805.66" dur="5.539">specific sacred geometrical ratios</text>
  <text start="808.199" dur="7.51">three-dimensional sacred geometric</text>
  <text start="811.199" dur="6.431">ratios and it will essentially enhance</text>
  <text start="815.709" dur="4.201">it&amp;#39;ll electrically enhance the water so</text>
  <text start="817.63" dur="4.68">when you drink it much more lifeforce</text>
  <text start="819.91" dur="4.409">for you you can water your plants with</text>
  <text start="822.31" dur="4.44">structured water and there studies done</text>
  <text start="824.319" dur="6.39">that show structured water can increase</text>
  <text start="826.75" dur="7.41">the basically the growth of the plant by</text>
  <text start="830.709" dur="5.88">three or fourfold even and the fruit</text>
  <text start="834.16" dur="6">that you get from watering plants with</text>
  <text start="836.589" dur="5.94">structured water is massive much larger</text>
  <text start="840.16" dur="4.229">than you would often have just with you</text>
  <text start="842.529" dur="4.591">know basic water out of the hose and</text>
  <text start="844.389" dur="4.82">whatnot so yeah I don&amp;#39;t have a water</text>
  <text start="847.12" dur="5.04">structure riser unfortunately I have a</text>
  <text start="849.209" dur="4.781">purifier get all the fluoride and</text>
  <text start="852.16" dur="4.799">whatever the heck else is in water out</text>
  <text start="853.99" dur="7.11">of it but I have I need to work on</text>
  <text start="856.959" dur="6.511">getting a structure Iser there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="861.1" dur="4.2">question here on on to the stars and Tom</text>
  <text start="863.47" dur="4.14">DeLonge do I think Tom DeLonge knows who</text>
  <text start="865.3" dur="3.389">he was working with or if he knows who</text>
  <text start="867.61" dur="6.75">these people really are</text>
  <text start="868.689" dur="10.89">I I hope I hope he is just wholly</text>
  <text start="874.36" dur="7.11">ignorant as to the connections that he</text>
  <text start="879.579" dur="4.74">has and who he&amp;#39;s associated with in</text>
  <text start="881.47" dur="5.63">working you know it&amp;#39;s funny because when</text>
  <text start="884.319" dur="5.731">I was younger Tom DeLonge was my</text>
  <text start="887.1" dur="5.2">favorite musician I was I was a teenager</text>
  <text start="890.05" dur="5.909">I was super into blink-182 once</text>
  <text start="892.3" dur="5.519">blink-182 broke up in 2003 and then Tom</text>
  <text start="895.959" dur="5.43">went to start Angels and Airwaves in</text>
  <text start="897.819" dur="5.731">2005 that was my favorite band dude I</text>
  <text start="901.389" dur="4.56">even went to an Asian JAL&amp;#39;s &amp;amp; Airwaves</text>
  <text start="903.55" dur="5.01">show in 2005 in Seattle and I met Tom</text>
  <text start="905.949" dur="5.461">DeLonge backstage at a meet-and-greet</text>
  <text start="908.56" dur="5.16">and that was like huge for me and now</text>
  <text start="911.41" dur="5.849">just the way the crazy universe works</text>
  <text start="913.72" dur="6.78">who would have thunk that 10 15 years</text>
  <text start="917.259" dur="4.621">later Here I am talking about Tom</text>
  <text start="920.5" dur="4.62">DeLonge in a completely different way</text>
  <text start="921.88" dur="6.449">and yeah I I really hope that he just</text>
  <text start="925.12" dur="5.64">doesn&amp;#39;t know how he&amp;#39;s being used or her</text>
  <text start="928.329" dur="3.81">who he&amp;#39;s really working with but there</text>
  <text start="930.76" dur="4.92">are some weird connections there man</text>
  <text start="932.139" dur="4.711">some really weird dots of information to</text>
  <text start="935.68" dur="5.08">connect</text>
  <text start="936.85" dur="9.1">Tom DeLonge with his Freemason symbols</text>
  <text start="940.76" dur="7.86">on his guitar and Tom DeLong&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="945.95" dur="4.65">business called it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a hot dog</text>
  <text start="948.62" dur="4.89">stand business in San Diego I believe</text>
  <text start="950.6" dur="6.18">called our two dogs and I mean okay</text>
  <text start="953.51" dur="5.13">sounds innocent could be innocent but</text>
  <text start="956.78" dur="6.72">again in context of who he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="958.64" dur="10.44">with Podesta and what they mean when</text>
  <text start="963.5" dur="10.14">they say hot dogs again I really really</text>
  <text start="969.08" dur="9.87">pray that he just doesn&amp;#39;t know flu shot</text>
  <text start="973.64" dur="11.76">info hmm it&amp;#39;s a good topic so blue shots</text>
  <text start="978.95" dur="9.45">I saw in a Twitter account yesterday an</text>
  <text start="985.4" dur="5.27">anonymous Twitter account anonymous</text>
  <text start="988.4" dur="4.89">being like the organization Anonymous</text>
  <text start="990.67" dur="4.27">and it said get your flu shot that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="993.29" dur="3.32">it said and if you needed any more</text>
  <text start="994.94" dur="7.35">evidence than anonymous was compromised</text>
  <text start="996.61" dur="7.33">or at least some groups or accounts that</text>
  <text start="1002.29" dur="4.98">claim to be affiliated with anonymous</text>
  <text start="1003.94" dur="6.24">are compromised there you go don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1007.27" dur="6.69">get your flu shots guys don&amp;#39;t go not</text>
  <text start="1010.18" dur="5.7">only do you have aluminum in your flu</text>
  <text start="1013.96" dur="4.56">shots yes many of them still have</text>
  <text start="1015.88" dur="3.63">mercury you even have nano particles</text>
  <text start="1018.52" dur="3.54">that are in flu shots</text>
  <text start="1019.51" dur="4.5">this isn&amp;#39;t disclosed on the label and I</text>
  <text start="1022.06" dur="4.88">heart most doctors probably even don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1024.01" dur="6.57">know this but there was a study done</text>
  <text start="1026.94" dur="5.8">last year 2017 I believe you can look at</text>
  <text start="1030.58" dur="3.78">this on green med infocomm I love that</text>
  <text start="1032.74" dur="4.14">website for health information Green Med</text>
  <text start="1034.36" dur="6.93">info I saw this study reported there</text>
  <text start="1036.88" dur="6.18">where it was found in Italy they studied</text>
  <text start="1041.29" dur="3.18">a whole bunch of vaccines in Italy and</text>
  <text start="1043.06" dur="3.68">they found that literally every single</text>
  <text start="1044.47" dur="4.5">human vaccine they studied had</text>
  <text start="1046.74" dur="4.3">nanoparticles in there and then they</text>
  <text start="1048.97" dur="3.87">studied a couple animal vaccines and an</text>
  <text start="1051.04" dur="3.15">animal that nanoparticles weren&amp;#39;t in the</text>
  <text start="1052.84" dur="4.86">animal vaccines they were only in the</text>
  <text start="1054.19" dur="5.04">human vaccines so what&amp;#39;s the agenda</text>
  <text start="1057.7" dur="4.22">behind that how did they get in there</text>
  <text start="1059.23" dur="6.45">who put him in and for what purpose</text>
  <text start="1061.92" dur="6.06">you can reconcile that on your own but</text>
  <text start="1065.68" dur="4.45">yeah heavy metals nanoparticles</text>
  <text start="1067.98" dur="5.21">mycoplasma</text>
  <text start="1070.13" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s a great rabbit hole to go down go</text>
  <text start="1073.19" dur="4.98">look into Michael plasma a little bio</text>
  <text start="1075.77" dur="5.19">engineered warfare agents there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1078.17" dur="7.53">doctor on YouTube cut called named dr.</text>
  <text start="1080.96" dur="8.79">Garth Nicholson he&amp;#39;s a he&amp;#39;s a bot was he</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="7.38">a biochemist or anyway he was a really</text>
  <text start="1089.75" dur="5.25">really well renowned scientist out of</text>
  <text start="1093.08" dur="4.32">California and he started studying these</text>
  <text start="1095" dur="5.9">vaccines and he studied Michael plasma</text>
  <text start="1097.4" dur="5.4">he stout he found that vaccines were</text>
  <text start="1100.9" dur="3.64">Mandela effect I&amp;#39;ll get to that question</text>
  <text start="1102.8" dur="2.94">in a second for sure Mandela effect his</text>
  <text start="1104.54" dur="5.28">fascinating stuff and it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1105.74" dur="5.46">really simple in my eyes but he&amp;#39;s my co</text>
  <text start="1109.82" dur="4.5">these vaccines were contaminated with</text>
  <text start="1111.2" dur="6.27">mycoplasma and these mycoplasma are many</text>
  <text start="1114.32" dur="7.65">of them could be bioengineered and they</text>
  <text start="1117.47" dur="6.96">are basically little parasitic micro</text>
  <text start="1121.97" dur="4.23">bacterium that get into us and they</text>
  <text start="1124.43" dur="3.93">attach themselves to our red blood cells</text>
  <text start="1126.2" dur="4.53">and Matt and Michael plasma will suck</text>
  <text start="1128.36" dur="6.72">the cholesterol out of our red blood</text>
  <text start="1130.73" dur="5.76">cells in a parasitic fashion so and</text>
  <text start="1135.08" dur="3.18">these Michael plasma are very tough to</text>
  <text start="1136.49" dur="4.8">test for you have to do very specialized</text>
  <text start="1138.26" dur="6.15">I believe like blood plasma test to see</text>
  <text start="1141.29" dur="5.58">if they are in you or how much they are</text>
  <text start="1144.41" dur="4.44">in you well yeah Michael plasmas and</text>
  <text start="1146.87" dur="3.92">vaccines I would say Michael plasmas</text>
  <text start="1148.85" dur="6.45">would probably sprayed over our heads in</text>
  <text start="1150.79" dur="7.78">chemtrails too but hopefully just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1155.3" dur="6.81">just don&amp;#39;t go get any sort of flu shot</text>
  <text start="1158.57" dur="6.33">nothing reject the poison and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1162.11" dur="5.4">even sign the consent form like</text>
  <text start="1164.9" dur="4.08">oftentimes in the doctor&amp;#39;s offices if</text>
  <text start="1167.51" dur="3.42">you reject vaccines or you reject</text>
  <text start="1168.98" dur="3.59">vaccines for your little ones they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1170.93" dur="5.67">try to make you sign this consent form</text>
  <text start="1172.57" dur="5.89">don&amp;#39;t even do that you don&amp;#39;t need to the</text>
  <text start="1176.6" dur="3.84">doctor has no control over you nobody</text>
  <text start="1178.46" dur="4.14">has control over you but yourself right</text>
  <text start="1180.44" dur="6.33">you&amp;#39;re your own sovereign human being on</text>
  <text start="1182.6" dur="7.92">this earth so make your own choices</text>
  <text start="1186.77" dur="8.4">be smart could Michael plasma be causing</text>
  <text start="1190.52" dur="8.49">the dementia so when it comes to causes</text>
  <text start="1195.17" dur="7.71">of diseases think of it this way there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1199.01" dur="5.01">many different causes for particular</text>
  <text start="1202.88" dur="2.46">disease</text>
  <text start="1204.02" dur="2.72">everything in our body is connected</text>
  <text start="1205.34" dur="4.56">everything that every single system</text>
  <text start="1206.74" dur="4.96">every single organ angle and they all</text>
  <text start="1209.9" dur="4.44">work together our body is a holistic</text>
  <text start="1211.7" dur="6.33">unit so when it comes to dementia</text>
  <text start="1214.34" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s so many different causes heavy</text>
  <text start="1218.03" dur="4.11">metals electromagnetic radiation you</text>
  <text start="1220.85" dur="4.11">know we can talk about 5g if you guys</text>
  <text start="1222.14" dur="5.13">want to there&amp;#39;s bad food</text>
  <text start="1224.96" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s your own thought processes</text>
  <text start="1227.27" dur="5.85">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s just so many different</text>
  <text start="1228.8" dur="7.65">things to look at but there&amp;#39;s also the</text>
  <text start="1233.12" dur="5.82">symptom okay how can I get into this</text>
  <text start="1236.45" dur="6.18">let&amp;#39;s talk about Candida for a sec so</text>
  <text start="1238.94" dur="5.94">body fungus fungus in your body such as</text>
  <text start="1242.63" dur="6.78">Candida is a cause of many issues but</text>
  <text start="1244.88" dur="8.94">it&amp;#39;s also a symptom of bad habits and an</text>
  <text start="1249.41" dur="7.53">unhealthy lifestyle so anything in our</text>
  <text start="1253.82" dur="5.63">body this is the way I view it is both a</text>
  <text start="1256.94" dur="5.88">cause and a symptom right so if you have</text>
  <text start="1259.45" dur="6.01">inflammation for instance inflammation</text>
  <text start="1262.82" dur="6.3">is a cause of all sorts of things cause</text>
  <text start="1265.46" dur="6.66">a pain cause of low immune system but</text>
  <text start="1269.12" dur="5.01">the inflammation is also a symptom so</text>
  <text start="1272.12" dur="5.49">you have inflammation because something</text>
  <text start="1274.13" dur="5.22">is off right so don&amp;#39;t view everything so</text>
  <text start="1277.61" dur="4.92">black and white I mean this can be said</text>
  <text start="1279.35" dur="5.97">for so many different topics and in so</text>
  <text start="1282.53" dur="4.74">many different regards but in terms of</text>
  <text start="1285.32" dur="2.39">your health don&amp;#39;t think of it so black</text>
  <text start="1287.27" dur="3.81">and white</text>
  <text start="1287.71" dur="6.28">so we can bring back vaccines and for</text>
  <text start="1291.08" dur="5.43">instance autism into this picture yes</text>
  <text start="1293.99" dur="6.6">vaccines lead to autism it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="1296.51" dur="6.03">easy critical thinking test right there</text>
  <text start="1300.59" dur="3.06">yeah you inject heavy metals into</text>
  <text start="1302.54" dur="2.82">yourself and whatever other</text>
  <text start="1303.65" dur="3.6">preservatives and nanoparticles in there</text>
  <text start="1305.36" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re going to get neural developmental</text>
  <text start="1307.25" dur="6.21">dysfunction right but there&amp;#39;s also many</text>
  <text start="1310.07" dur="5.4">other causes of neurodevelopmental</text>
  <text start="1313.46" dur="4.11">dysfunction like autism yes the heavy</text>
  <text start="1315.47" dur="4.26">metals but there&amp;#39;s also the food there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1317.57" dur="6.15">also the the Wi-Fi and like I said</text>
  <text start="1319.73" dur="6.99">there&amp;#39;s all sorts of causes for</text>
  <text start="1323.72" dur="4.89">different diseases okay so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1326.72" dur="6.75">when it comes to health and knowing</text>
  <text start="1328.61" dur="6.66">yourself it&amp;#39;s a deep deep subject it</text>
  <text start="1333.47" dur="3.66">takes a long time to really learn it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1335.27" dur="2.73">pretty pathetic when you go into going</text>
  <text start="1337.13" dur="2.97">to the doctor&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1338" dur="5.19">office for some sort of issue and they</text>
  <text start="1340.1" dur="6.23">hand you a one-sided paper a one-sided</text>

  <text start="2070.679" dur="5.131">they are in control so okay you could</text>
  <text start="2073.77" dur="5.879">say Cavanaugh is swap because he has</text>
  <text start="2075.81" dur="6.27">these connections to Bush well what if</text>

  <text start="2082.08" dur="2.52">working for Bush during those years</text>
  <text start="2083.159" dur="3.871">maybe he had no idea what he was getting</text>
  <text start="2084.6" dur="4.37">into and he might know where the bodies</text>
  <text start="2087.03" dur="4.95">were buried that&amp;#39;s why they chose him</text>
  <text start="2088.97" dur="5.35">maybe he doesn&amp;#39;t want to do that anymore</text>
  <text start="2091.98" dur="8.16">and he wants to work for this alliance</text>
  <text start="2094.32" dur="7.77">now right again with the way that the</text>
  <text start="2100.14" dur="4.11">Alliance is in control there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="2102.09" dur="6.9">no people getting into important</text>
  <text start="2104.25" dur="7.26">positions that aren&amp;#39;t gonna be there to</text>
  <text start="2108.99" dur="3.9">work for the plan right okay maybe there</text>
  <text start="2111.51" dur="3.12">were in the swamp maybe they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="2112.89" dur="6.87">some bad things in the past but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2114.63" dur="8.31">making amends for that now right or the</text>
  <text start="2119.76" dur="6.48">Alliance is using these particular ties</text>
  <text start="2122.94" dur="5.31">for some way maybe many in the Alliance</text>
  <text start="2126.24" dur="3.36">are defectors that&amp;#39;s a great point and</text>
  <text start="2128.25" dur="3.21">that point has been thrown around for</text>
  <text start="2129.6" dur="4.02">years now years now is that many of</text>
  <text start="2131.46" dur="3.83">these white hats used to be black hats</text>
  <text start="2133.62" dur="7.4">they&amp;#39;re just sick of the game anymore</text>
  <text start="2135.29" dur="9.85">okay and that&amp;#39;s exactly the case I</text>
  <text start="2141.02" dur="7.45">believe it with many of them is they</text>
  <text start="2145.14" dur="6.98">were probably in some bad networks in</text>
  <text start="2148.47" dur="3.65">the past but they&amp;#39;re just sick of it so</text>
  <text start="2158.9" dur="6.37">closed solar observatory they may have</text>
  <text start="2163.74" dur="3.03">found some deep state communication</text>
  <text start="2165.27" dur="3.95">devices yeah still don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2166.77" dur="4.89">going on with that solar observatory</text>
  <text start="2169.22" dur="4.06">let&amp;#39;s back up and running now I believe</text>
  <text start="2171.66" dur="6.33">but it was closed for a little while</text>
  <text start="2173.28" dur="8.13">there that&amp;#39;s my most likely thought in</text>
  <text start="2177.99" dur="6.54">my head is that maybe it was a some sort</text>
  <text start="2181.41" dur="6.36">of espionage by rogue intelligence</text>
  <text start="2184.53" dur="5.64">agency or foreign enemy whatever the</text>
  <text start="2187.77" dur="6">case is I think that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="2190.17" dur="5.49">observatory was closed there was that</text>
  <text start="2193.77" dur="3.72">news article that was released it was</text>
  <text start="2195.66" dur="5.22">claiming it was one of the workers</text>
  <text start="2197.49" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re downloading child porn or</text>
  <text start="2200.88" dur="4.53">something like that</text>
  <text start="2201.48" dur="7.26">but I don&amp;#39;t know doesn&amp;#39;t really make</text>
  <text start="2205.41" dur="4.56">that much sense to me with everything</text>
  <text start="2208.74" dur="3.48">that went on with that Observatory I</text>
  <text start="2209.97" dur="5.04">mean they made a huge fuss about it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2212.22" dur="5.06">closed down for like week I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="2215.01" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t know there man</text>
  <text start="2217.28" dur="3.91">what do I think about the earth being</text>
  <text start="2219.09" dur="5.1">Hollow somebody asked I particularly</text>
  <text start="2221.19" dur="5.91">think the earth is a honeycomb so I</text>
  <text start="2224.19" dur="5.94">think yes we live on a spherical</text>
  <text start="2227.1" dur="6.12">spinning ball maybe a little oblong</text>
  <text start="2230.13" dur="4.71">maybe not completely spherical spins but</text>
  <text start="2233.22" dur="9.3">I think inside the earth there are</text>
  <text start="2234.84" dur="9.72">caverns and it has somewhat of like a</text>
  <text start="2242.52" dur="9.06">kind of a honeycomb shape to it where</text>
  <text start="2244.56" dur="9">you get down in there expanding Earth</text>
  <text start="2251.58" dur="4.26">theory to not just Hollow Earth or</text>
  <text start="2253.56" dur="2.73">honeycomb earth by expanding earth good</text>
  <text start="2255.84" dur="5.18">point</text>
  <text start="2256.29" dur="9.66">Justin very good point expanding earth I</text>
  <text start="2261.02" dur="8.98">don&amp;#39;t remember who scientifically</text>
  <text start="2265.95" dur="6.9">researched this but if you actually make</text>
  <text start="2270" dur="5.37">the earth a little bit smaller then all</text>
  <text start="2272.85" dur="4.89">of the continents fit together perfectly</text>
  <text start="2275.37" dur="4.71">like a puzzle and then when you expand</text>
  <text start="2277.74" dur="5.97">the earth when you grow that sphere</text>
  <text start="2280.08" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s how the continents move away from</text>
  <text start="2283.71" dur="4.64">each other because I believe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2285.57" dur="2.78">many more</text>
  <text start="2289.5" dur="8.16">I did really good in geology in college</text>
  <text start="2293.61" dur="5.94">but I drank a lot in college so I killed</text>
  <text start="2297.66" dur="8.63">off a lot of those brain cells went</text>
  <text start="2299.55" dur="11.79">Cavanaugh on that beer but there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="2306.29" dur="7.42">could we say zones where the continent</text>
  <text start="2311.34" dur="4.32">the continents are continental plates</text>
  <text start="2313.71" dur="3.6">are drifting away from each other and</text>
  <text start="2315.66" dur="10.23">stuff&amp;#39;s coming up then they are</text>
  <text start="2317.31" dur="13.02">subducting under each other here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2325.89" dur="7.86">really good question that I will answer</text>
  <text start="2330.33" dur="7.17">what things do I not believe about Cory</text>
  <text start="2333.75" dur="7.14">good so quite honestly it took me a long</text>
  <text start="2337.5" dur="6.48">time to come around to him and his</text>
  <text start="2340.89" dur="7.14">testimony I became familiar with him</text>
  <text start="2343.98" dur="5.46">right when he came out in 2014/15 I was</text>
  <text start="2348.03" dur="5.1">following the stillness and the storm</text>
  <text start="2349.44" dur="5.7">blog and dr. Saleh David Wilcock so you</text>
  <text start="2353.13" dur="7.2">know I was following his stuff heavily</text>
  <text start="2355.14" dur="7.2">in 2015 and 16 and it - I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2360.33" dur="4.32">such an expansive testimony and story</text>
  <text start="2362.34" dur="4.98">that you&amp;#39;re just like what the hell is</text>
  <text start="2364.65" dur="6.02">this guy even talking about right is</text>
  <text start="2367.32" dur="7.29">this even true what the heck and I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="2370.67" dur="6.64">I&amp;#39;m a open-minded skeptic I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="2374.61" dur="5.33">open-minded but stuff has to make</text>
  <text start="2377.31" dur="6.77">logical sense to me for me to believe it</text>
  <text start="2379.94" dur="9.55">once I met Cory last year and I began to</text>
  <text start="2384.08" dur="10.2">get my intuitive sense of him and also</text>
  <text start="2389.49" dur="9.66">see the fact that Cory good yes has</text>
  <text start="2394.28" dur="7.99">insider Alliance sources and recently</text>
  <text start="2399.15" dur="6.09">the fact that Cory was slipped those dia</text>
  <text start="2402.27" dur="4.25">documents somehow by someone on the</text>
  <text start="2405.24" dur="5.37">inside</text>
  <text start="2406.52" dur="6.7">why why why would they choose to slip</text>
  <text start="2410.61" dur="6.17">them to him of all people right why are</text>
  <text start="2413.22" dur="6.6">inside sources looking at Cory</text>
  <text start="2416.78" dur="6.31">legitimately like that so there must be</text>
  <text start="2419.82" dur="5.64">something to his testimony</text>
  <text start="2423.09" dur="7.26">and that wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened if there</text>
  <text start="2425.46" dur="11.7">wasn&amp;#39;t so I&amp;#39;m not gonna say I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2430.35" dur="8.76">believe anything but yeah I do I do</text>
  <text start="2437.16" dur="5.61">believe his his testimony</text>
  <text start="2439.11" dur="4.05">someone said Cory might be CIA no not at</text>
  <text start="2442.77" dur="6.03">all</text>
  <text start="2443.16" dur="7.92">he&amp;#39;s not CIA trust me and it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ll tell</text>
  <text start="2448.8" dur="4.85">you I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ve ever I think I</text>
  <text start="2451.08" dur="5.43">have said this before but the one of the</text>
  <text start="2453.65" dur="4.78">he was a second or third time I met Cory</text>
  <text start="2456.51" dur="5.25">I actually went to his house when he</text>
  <text start="2458.43" dur="6.81">used to live in Dallas Texas and we were</text>
  <text start="2461.76" dur="7.26">hanging out at his house outside in his</text>
  <text start="2465.24" dur="7.22">backyard and there was this c-130 Air</text>
  <text start="2469.02" dur="7.68">Force jet that circled over the house</text>
  <text start="2472.46" dur="6.19">five times and it circled so low that I</text>
  <text start="2476.7" dur="4.5">could see I actually have this I have it</text>
  <text start="2478.65" dur="4.65">on video I could see the US Air Force</text>
  <text start="2481.2" dur="3.86">painted on the underside of the wing and</text>
  <text start="2483.3" dur="6.84">where he lived in Dallas</text>
  <text start="2485.06" dur="8.2">there&amp;#39;s no Air Force Base for miles</text>
  <text start="2490.14" dur="5.28">the closest military anything to where</text>
  <text start="2493.26" dur="4.32">Cory used to live in Dallas was the</text>
  <text start="2495.42" dur="5.06">Naval Air Station it was a Naval Air</text>
  <text start="2497.58" dur="7.2">Station that was about 40 miles away and</text>
  <text start="2500.48" dur="7.81">like I said this c-130 Hercules tanker</text>
  <text start="2504.78" dur="5.43">those were big-ass jets four times did</text>
  <text start="2508.29" dur="4.05">circles right over us right over our</text>
  <text start="2510.21" dur="4.5">head could see it go off in the distance</text>
  <text start="2512.34" dur="2.85">about five minutes later right over her</text>
  <text start="2514.71" dur="3.12">head again</text>
  <text start="2515.19" dur="7.85">dude it was nuts I&amp;#39;m like this is not a</text>
  <text start="2517.83" dur="7.53">an accident and it was crazy</text>
  <text start="2523.04" dur="3.58">Cory pointed up at this building that</text>
  <text start="2525.36" dur="3.38">was kind of off in the distance you</text>
  <text start="2526.62" dur="6.09">could see the windows up and he was like</text>
  <text start="2528.74" dur="9.13">they used to watch me from there like</text>
  <text start="2532.71" dur="6.87">look over like that was like five</text>
  <text start="2537.87" dur="2.91">months into me doing the YouTube thing</text>
  <text start="2539.58" dur="6.63">and like getting into all this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2540.78" dur="7.83">just like so yeah there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="2546.21" dur="4.74">people that take him seriously so and</text>
  <text start="2548.61" dur="3.75">these people are important</text>
  <text start="2550.95" dur="3.95">well-connected people so I&amp;#39;m gonna take</text>
  <text start="2552.36" dur="2.54">him seriously</text>
  <text start="2562.28" dur="6.06">all right kind of other questions we got</text>
  <text start="2565.11" dur="3.23">hang out for a few more minutes</text>
  <text start="2569.21" dur="4.9">even if his name was Corey bad I would</text>
  <text start="2571.86" dur="3.87">still trust him that&amp;#39;s the thing guys</text>
  <text start="2574.11" dur="8.7">just just get your intuitive sense of</text>
  <text start="2575.73" dur="9.33">people when it comes to Corey he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2582.81" dur="4.95">shy away from talking about the dark</text>
  <text start="2585.06" dur="4.89">issues that many people in the UFO AG</text>
  <text start="2587.76" dur="4.92">community do he mentions human</text>
  <text start="2589.95" dur="5.09">trafficking he mentions Q in my opinion</text>
  <text start="2592.68" dur="9.21">that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why the</text>
  <text start="2595.04" dur="7.72">insiders take Cory seriously and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2601.89" dur="3.54">grown a lot</text>
  <text start="2602.76" dur="3.18">he has grown so much he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="2605.43" dur="2.52">healthy</text>
  <text start="2605.94" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s totally change his diet he&amp;#39;s lost a</text>
  <text start="2607.95" dur="3.87">lot of weight like I said he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2609.72" dur="5.4">scared to talk about those issues that</text>
  <text start="2611.82" dur="7.23">need to be talked about and dude his</text>
  <text start="2615.12" dur="8.4">it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ll kind of go off</text>
  <text start="2619.05" dur="8.34">philosophically here in my own rant I</text>
  <text start="2623.52" dur="6.42">think Cory was chosen by particular</text>
  <text start="2627.39" dur="4.56">beings to be contacted and bring out his</text>
  <text start="2629.94" dur="4.65">story because of how many people it</text>
  <text start="2631.95" dur="4.41">would trigger it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re in we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2634.59" dur="2.94">in the age of mass triggering because so</text>
  <text start="2636.36" dur="2.88">many people are stuck in their belief</text>
  <text start="2637.53" dur="4.59">systems that they need to be triggered</text>
  <text start="2639.24" dur="4.65">out of them so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2642.12" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s why Trump&amp;#39;s president trigger the</text>
  <text start="2643.89" dur="3.87">hell out of people wake him up</text>
  <text start="2645.87" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s why Q busted onto the scene in</text>
  <text start="2647.76" dur="3.33">October last year trigger the heck out</text>
  <text start="2649.5" dur="3.66">of people waking up show them things</text>
  <text start="2651.09" dur="5.37">they don&amp;#39;t normally see that&amp;#39;s why Cory</text>
  <text start="2653.16" dur="5.52">was contacted three four years ago</text>
  <text start="2656.46" dur="4.62">and told to bring his story forward</text>
  <text start="2658.68" dur="9.23">because he was going to trigger a</text>
  <text start="2661.08" dur="10.55">particular section of people right so</text>
  <text start="2667.91" dur="6.9">yeah dude there&amp;#39;s just there is a</text>
  <text start="2671.63" dur="6.04">massive increase in the amount of</text>

  <text start="3161.13" dur="6.36">that I do resonate with Bob Lazar as</text>
  <text start="3163.77" dur="6.69">claims now I haven&amp;#39;t looked too deeply</text>
  <text start="3167.49" dur="5.87">into them and picked them apart but I</text>
  <text start="3170.46" dur="5.84">read a lot of Michael sallows work and</text>
  <text start="3173.36" dur="5.71">he has he&amp;#39;s done a very good job at</text>
  <text start="3176.3" dur="4.48">bringing in a lot of these perspectives</text>
  <text start="3179.07" dur="10.07">and meshing them together in his books</text>

  <text start="3189.14" dur="7.36">share more about my secret space program</text>
  <text start="3191.91" dur="8.01">movie above majestic man that was quite</text>
  <text start="3196.5" dur="5.82">an amazing I mean we&amp;#39;ve been working on</text>
  <text start="3199.92" dur="4.68">that for like a year a year and three</text>
  <text start="3202.32" dur="3.9">months because the very versed</text>
  <text start="3204.6" dur="4.5">interviews that we got for above</text>
  <text start="3206.22" dur="4.14">majestic was William Tompkins William</text>
  <text start="3209.1" dur="3.09">Tompkins was the first person I</text>
  <text start="3210.36" dur="3.27">interviewed and we didn&amp;#39;t even know at</text>
  <text start="3212.19" dur="3.42">the time I interviewed him last July</text>
  <text start="3213.63" dur="5.25">month before he passed away last</text>
  <text start="3215.61" dur="5.73">interview he ever did and we just felt</text>
  <text start="3218.88" dur="5.67">like we got this intuitive hit that we</text>
  <text start="3221.34" dur="5.43">need to get him on camera now so we did</text>
  <text start="3224.55" dur="4.08">I interviewed him and we didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="3226.77" dur="4.05">know that that interview was going to</text>
  <text start="3228.63" dur="3.87">end up in this movie at that time we</text>
  <text start="3230.82" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t even know this movie was gonna be</text>
  <text start="3232.5" dur="6.89">made we didn&amp;#39;t have any plans for it way</text>
  <text start="3234.51" dur="8.67">back then and funny enough the way the</text>
  <text start="3239.39" dur="7.96">divine universe the way God operates we</text>
  <text start="3243.18" dur="6.45">actually lost half of the footage and</text>
  <text start="3247.35" dur="4.34">the files for William Tompkins and we</text>
  <text start="3249.63" dur="6.24">didn&amp;#39;t know where they were for like</text>
  <text start="3251.69" dur="5.05">four months five months we only had one</text>
  <text start="3255.87" dur="2.51">of the angles on his</text>
  <text start="3256.74" dur="3.629">face and we didn&amp;#39;t even have the audio</text>
  <text start="3258.38" dur="4.239">the audio we only had was from the</text>
  <text start="3260.369" dur="4.831">camera not from the recorder and we were</text>
  <text start="3262.619" dur="7.201">like we felt so bad for misplacing</text>
  <text start="3265.2" dur="8.03">his footage but then in December I found</text>
  <text start="3269.82" dur="5.82">it I found his footage I was I was at a</text>
  <text start="3273.23" dur="4.69">business partner mines house and I would</text>
  <text start="3275.64" dur="4.74">just like picked up this random SD card</text>
  <text start="3277.92" dur="4.38">put it into my computer and then boom I</text>
  <text start="3280.38" dur="4.23">found all of the files for William</text>
  <text start="3282.3" dur="4.44">Tompkins now the reason I say that it</text>
  <text start="3284.61" dur="5.07">was freakin divine is because if we</text>
  <text start="3286.74" dur="3.99">would have had those files before we</text>
  <text start="3289.68" dur="3.21">probably just would have put them out on</text>
  <text start="3290.73" dur="5.61">YouTube or do something with them that</text>
  <text start="3292.89" dur="6.51">you know wouldn&amp;#39;t have been mounted too</text>
  <text start="3296.34" dur="5.49">much but the fact that we lost those</text>
  <text start="3299.4" dur="4.29">files for five months and then found</text>
  <text start="3301.83" dur="3.99">them and found them at the time when</text>
  <text start="3303.69" dur="4.71">these plans for a movie was getting</text>
  <text start="3305.82" dur="5.43">drawn up it was like it was like it was</text>
  <text start="3308.4" dur="4.56">meant to happen that we weren&amp;#39;t gonna</text>
  <text start="3311.25" dur="3.36">put those files out anywhere else and</text>
  <text start="3312.96" dur="4.17">then we found them right when the movie</text>
  <text start="3314.61" dur="2.82">was starting so boom plug it right in</text>
  <text start="3317.13" dur="1.65">there</text>
  <text start="3317.43" dur="5.189">it was just a very interesting</text>
  <text start="3318.78" dur="7.02">experience you know a lot of weird</text>
  <text start="3322.619" dur="4.561">synchronicities truly look for those</text>
  <text start="3325.8" dur="4.88">synchronicities in your lives because</text>
  <text start="3327.18" dur="6.24">that is that is God talking to you</text>
  <text start="3330.68" dur="6.1">you&amp;#39;re your own higher self leading you</text>
  <text start="3333.42" dur="6.96">in the direction that you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="3336.78" dur="9.089">be going in so yeah there was that and</text>
  <text start="3340.38" dur="7.53">then this year a lot of the traveling I</text>
  <text start="3345.869" dur="4.021">did this year was to go to conferences</text>
  <text start="3347.91" dur="6.36">to not even speak at the conferences but</text>
  <text start="3349.89" dur="5.94">just to interview people and went on a</text>
  <text start="3354.27" dur="2.97">road trip to go interview a bunch of</text>
  <text start="3355.83" dur="4.05">people up and down the west coast so</text>
  <text start="3357.24" dur="5.04">every single interview in above majestic</text>
  <text start="3359.88" dur="5.67">was me on the other side of the camera</text>
  <text start="3362.28" dur="4.89">asking them questions so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3365.55" dur="6.87">pretty surreal to watch that movie</text>
  <text start="3367.17" dur="6.6">because I did all the interviews so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3372.42" dur="3.449">gonna be I&amp;#39;m really excited I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3373.77" dur="7.95">seen the final cut so I&amp;#39;m really stoked</text>
