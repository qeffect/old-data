  <text start="493.459" dur="5.64">take it first yes sir go ahead alright</text>
  <text start="496.429" dur="5.19">so there&amp;#39;s three things we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="499.099" dur="5.28">get across number one was the lead-up to</text>
  <text start="501.619" dur="5.34">the attacks and the actual attacks of</text>
  <text start="504.379" dur="4.22">Benghazi and what happened what wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="506.959" dur="4.95">done and what should have been done</text>
  <text start="508.599" dur="5.11">number two were trying to go to the next</text>
  <text start="511.909" dur="3.99">phase which is where the congressional</text>
  <text start="513.709" dur="3.661">committee met and how we shared the</text>
  <text start="515.899" dur="3.3">information with this committee and</text>
  <text start="517.37" dur="3.479">nothing was done with that because</text>
  <text start="519.199" dur="3.411">everything we&amp;#39;re speaking about it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="4.53">going to be factual from what we know</text>
  <text start="522.61" dur="4.419">first-hand knowledge and then the third</text>
  <text start="525.379" dur="3.991">thing we&amp;#39;re trying to accomplish is to</text>
  <text start="527.029" dur="5.1">get dishonourable president to write an</text>
  <text start="529.37" dur="4.709">executive order to allow for him to go</text>
  <text start="532.129" dur="4.411">back and gain the information and start</text>
  <text start="534.079" dur="5.581">holding those that failed to do their</text>
  <text start="536.54" dur="5.01">duties and obeyed unlawful orders to be</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="3.419">held accountable there are too many</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="3.389">obstructionists within the government</text>
  <text start="543.079" dur="4.171">right now and many of the meat to be</text>
  <text start="544.939" dur="4.26">held accountable so that this president</text>
  <text start="547.25" dur="5.009">has the opportunity to run the country</text>
  <text start="549.199" dur="5.851">as he&amp;#39;s supposed to be able to Benghazi</text>
  <text start="552.259" dur="4.68">issue and overall we&amp;#39;re trying to also</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="3.839">get closure and justice for the families</text>
  <text start="556.939" dur="2.671">a lot of them are very dissatisfied with</text>
  <text start="558.889" dur="3.331">what happened</text>
  <text start="559.61" dur="5.519">what was done and what&amp;#39;s been done up to</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="5.059">this point so we&amp;#39;re gonna say the story</text>
  <text start="565.129" dur="5.161">time and fairytales for everybody else</text>
  <text start="567.279" dur="6.101">myself and Nick now are going to discuss</text>
  <text start="570.29" dur="5.16">only what we know about</text>
  <text start="573.38" dur="4.95">do you think these people will be</text>
  <text start="575.45" dur="5.91">brought forward eventually do you think</text>
  <text start="578.33" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ll be able to see this actually yes</text>
  <text start="581.36" dur="4.02">the president United States just has to</text>
  <text start="583.19" dur="4.17">sign an executive work Westing all the</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="2.97">information from the day before during</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="5.16">and after the attacks</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="6.78">well factually was where and who decided</text>
  <text start="592.52" dur="4.92">not to go in and do the duty who gave</text>
  <text start="595.13" dur="4.59">the orders and he can get all of those</text>
  <text start="597.44" dur="3.66">folks in a very short amount of time but</text>
  <text start="599.72" dur="3.18">the president is nothing more than</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="3.66">signing an executive order he has people</text>
  <text start="602.9" dur="3.71">that will take care of it once he gets</text>
  <text start="604.76" dur="3.69">the feedback and recommendations from</text>
  <text start="606.61" dur="4.12">Department of Defense and Department of</text>
  <text start="608.45" dur="3.99">Justice and he can take action on select</text>
  <text start="610.73" dur="5.88">individuals most likely senior</text>
  <text start="612.44" dur="5.64">individuals set the standard Nick your</text>
  <text start="616.61" dur="3.03">thoughts on the situation that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.08" dur="4.29">bringing bringing to everyone</text>
  <text start="619.64" dur="4.5">I think he&amp;#39;s spot-on and something</text>
  <text start="622.37" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s really important important too is</text>
  <text start="624.14" dur="6.99">that there was a gag order put on an</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="6.42">extra NDA given to the people who were</text>
  <text start="631.13" dur="7.95">rescued from the NX and the other</text>
  <text start="634.16" dur="6.48">compound right and those people the way</text>
  <text start="639.08" dur="3.66">from what I understand it is when they</text>
  <text start="640.64" dur="4.59">got back they didn&amp;#39;t even let him go</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="4.23">anywhere until after they signed and you</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="3.96">know so if they were able to talk to</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="6.87">that would really help piece together</text>
  <text start="649.19" dur="6.03">some information and I think that from</text>
  <text start="653.84" dur="2.46">what I understand too that Congress</text>
  <text start="655.22" dur="6.81">didn&amp;#39;t get all the information that</text>
  <text start="656.3" dur="7.08">there should have had in order to in</text>
  <text start="662.03" dur="2.73">order to bring it to light and then you</text>
  <text start="663.38" dur="4.05">know show the real story of what</text>
  <text start="664.76" dur="7.85">happened they were left hanging out too</text>
  <text start="667.43" dur="8.01">they were as there&amp;#39;s no way that any</text>
  <text start="672.61" dur="4.39">American soldier or anybody representing</text>
  <text start="675.44" dur="3.99">and is a shoe they treat it that way and</text>
  <text start="677" dur="5.76">I think that the people that are</text>
  <text start="679.43" dur="6.59">responsible for what happened definitely</text>
  <text start="682.76" dur="5.97">need to have their day in court</text>
  <text start="686.02" dur="5.14">absolutely guys people in the chatter</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="4.92">saying if you could get closer to the</text>
  <text start="691.16" dur="4.04">mic a little bit it&amp;#39;s a little low they</text>
  <text start="693.65" dur="4.71">can hear you but it&amp;#39;s just a little low</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="7.27">compared to me sure I speak softly</text>
  <text start="698.36" dur="6.15">doesn&amp;#39;t I understand yeah you know</text>
  <text start="702.47" dur="3.3">people are saying that when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="704.51" dur="2.19">saying in the chat right now that when</text>
  <text start="705.77" dur="2.52">they hear of big</text>
  <text start="706.7" dur="3.39">it makes them sick to their stomach</text>
  <text start="708.29" dur="4.47">first thing that comes to mind is you</text>
  <text start="710.09" dur="5.22">think of the thick ankle dogface this is</text>
  <text start="712.76" dur="5.61">who I talk about Hillary Clinton this is</text>
  <text start="715.31" dur="8.52">the mind this is the word the name that</text>
  <text start="718.37" dur="10.98">comes to mind is there who do we pin</text>
  <text start="723.83" dur="8.58">this on this situated we pin this on is</text>
  <text start="729.35" dur="6.99">there a direct person a group who who do</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="6.6">we blame for this for that we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.34" dur="3.78">answer that we don&amp;#39;t have knowledge what</text>
  <text start="739.01" dur="2.85">happened in the White House we don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="747.32" dur="4.38">was doing what at that time and who also</text>
  <text start="749.27" dur="4.68">was told to stand down at that time from</text>
  <text start="751.7" dur="4.32">our levels we could speak factually to</text>
  <text start="753.95" dur="3.87">that that&amp;#39;s why we can&amp;#39;t say you know</text>
  <text start="756.02" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s this person or that person and</text>
  <text start="757.82" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re requesting from the</text>
  <text start="759.44" dur="3.87">president an executive order to go back</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="4.44">and find those who were in command and</text>

  <text start="856.49" dur="5.37">checks that were ticked and those boxes</text>
  <text start="859.43" dur="5.07">indicate whether key personnel should</text>
  <text start="861.86" dur="5.729">stay or go whether security needs to be</text>
  <text start="864.5" dur="4.62">increased or decreased or both and what</text>
  <text start="867.589" dur="3.481">took place in this is that the</text>
  <text start="869.12" dur="4.95">Ambassador and key personnel were left</text>
  <text start="871.07" dur="4.86">in place insecurity was lessened which I</text>
  <text start="874.07" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t have an answer as to why that took</text>
  <text start="875.93" dur="4.589">place but I will tell you that</text>
  <text start="878.51" dur="4.56">throughout that time we were going</text>
  <text start="880.519" dur="4.411">through every single intelligence peace</text>
  <text start="883.07" dur="5.13">and settlement forward some of this</text>
  <text start="884.93" dur="5.339">intelligence was very credible and we</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="3.8">didn&amp;#39;t understand why the Ambassador and</text>
  <text start="890.269" dur="3.781">his teams were being pulled out</text>
  <text start="892" dur="3.67">furthermore we didn&amp;#39;t understand why</text>
  <text start="894.05" dur="4.02">security wasn&amp;#39;t being increased</text>
  <text start="895.67" dur="4.71">especially more with actual active duty</text>
  <text start="898.07" dur="3.63">military personnel and not so many of</text>
  <text start="900.38" dur="3.54">the contractors that were on the ground</text>
  <text start="901.7" dur="4.11">have visibility on how many who they</text>
  <text start="903.92" dur="5.46">were and all that we were only getting</text>
  <text start="905.81" dur="7.67">numbers as spot checks so during the day</text>
  <text start="909.38" dur="6.51">of the attack on September 11th 2012</text>
  <text start="913.48" dur="4.51">Central Command was involved with an</text>
  <text start="915.89" dur="2.939">exercise called internal look 12 or</text>
  <text start="917.99" dur="3.78">il-12</text>
  <text start="918.829" dur="6.901">that&amp;#39;s where 75% of our command was at</text>
  <text start="921.77" dur="5.61">duty working that night and we were not</text>
  <text start="925.73" dur="5.609">allowed to stop the training exercise</text>
  <text start="927.38" dur="5.76">for Benghazi but incidentally at the</text>
  <text start="931.339" dur="4.591">same time the Benghazi attacks took</text>
  <text start="933.14" dur="5.91">place our embassy in Cairo Egypt was</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="5.94">also being overrun by Muslim Brotherhood</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="4.86">folks the words we were getting from the</text>
  <text start="941.87" dur="5.37">commanders was that the State Department</text>
  <text start="943.91" dur="5.13">wanted to let the Morsi government gain</text>
  <text start="947.24" dur="5.219">control of our embassy in Cairo Egypt</text>
  <text start="949.04" dur="5.609">and at the same time that other elements</text>
  <text start="952.459" dur="5.971">to other units had it in hand with</text>
  <text start="954.649" dur="5.671">Benghazi so at this point I would change</text>
  <text start="958.43" dur="4.32">over to Nick because Nick can tell you</text>
  <text start="960.32" dur="8.91">about what he was watching Islam I feed</text>

  <text start="1031.089" dur="5.761">is this what is this fair to say it was</text>
  <text start="1034.48" dur="4.56">Nikhil be able to explain to you about</text>
  <text start="1036.85" dur="3.87">the fact that we already had a UAB</text>
  <text start="1039.04" dur="4.26">predator up in the air and all the</text>
  <text start="1040.72" dur="4.739">Predators are usually armed so they can</text>
  <text start="1043.3" dur="3.9">go into more depth about that but I can</text>
  <text start="1045.459" dur="3.781">tell you well he&amp;#39;s trying to catch back</text>
  <text start="1047.2" dur="4.47">up and let him speak his piece more</text>
  <text start="1049.24" dur="4.32">factually than I could that throughout</text>
  <text start="1051.67" dur="4.77">the night we were getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="1053.56" dur="4.86">reports um through personnel at CENTCOM</text>
  <text start="1056.44" dur="4.05">and other commands that there was</text>
  <text start="1058.42" dur="4.41">rescues being mounted that there were</text>
  <text start="1060.49" dur="4.65">troops off the coast all this stuff and</text>
  <text start="1062.83" dur="4.56">the commanders were telling us not to</text>
  <text start="1065.14" dur="4.41">worry about that just continue the</text>
  <text start="1067.39" dur="3.78">training exercise I had never been in</text>
  <text start="1069.55" dur="3.87">any military unit where training</text>
  <text start="1071.17" dur="4.2">exercise ever supersedes a real-world</text>
  <text start="1073.42" dur="4.62">mission it&amp;#39;s never happened</text>
  <text start="1075.37" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;ll give you when I was with the</text>
  <text start="1078.04" dur="3.75">hundred and first Airborne in 1992 at</text>
  <text start="1080.11" dur="3.06">Fort Chaffee Arkansas we were doing</text>
  <text start="1081.79" dur="4.89">what&amp;#39;s called a joint Readiness Training</text>
  <text start="1083.17" dur="5.19">Center or JROTC and some idiot in a van</text>
  <text start="1086.68" dur="2.28">decided to try to blow up the World</text>
  <text start="1088.36" dur="3.45">Trade Center</text>
  <text start="1088.96" dur="5.94">which was the blind Sheikh once that</text>
  <text start="1091.81" dur="6.21">bomb hit we were at a training posture</text>
  <text start="1094.9" dur="4.95">we changed turned in our blank rounds we</text>
  <text start="1098.02" dur="3.3">set up what&amp;#39;s called PC posture which is</text>
  <text start="1099.85" dur="4.77">a bunch of helicopter standing by with</text>
  <text start="1101.32" dur="5.28">us with live rounds ready to go and at a</text>
  <text start="1104.62" dur="3.87">moment&amp;#39;s notice all we had to do was</text>
  <text start="1106.6" dur="5.37">know about it and go this was two hours</text>
  <text start="1108.49" dur="6.3">into that attack Wow we were exercise so</text>
  <text start="1111.97" dur="5.25">this is 1993 and we&amp;#39;ll fast forward that</text>
  <text start="1114.79" dur="5.64">to today&amp;#39;s day group you know for the</text>
  <text start="1117.22" dur="6.63">2012 attacks nothing was being done</text>
  <text start="1120.43" dur="5.22">there was troops that were on on the</text>
  <text start="1123.85" dur="3.15">ground in different areas from different</text>
  <text start="1125.65" dur="4.47">countries that offered assistance they</text>
  <text start="1127" dur="4.95">were turned down there were other assets</text>
  <text start="1130.12" dur="3.84">that were available within a very short</text>
  <text start="1131.95" dur="5.22">amount of time and they were not allowed</text>
  <text start="1133.96" dur="5.52">to go on to and deal with the mission so</text>
  <text start="1137.17" dur="4.14">again nobody could understand why matter</text>
  <text start="1139.48" dur="3.63">of fact our training exercise didn&amp;#39;t end</text>
  <text start="1141.31" dur="4.56">for eight and a half hours after the</text>
  <text start="1143.11" dur="6.02">attacks began and we were not able to</text>
  <text start="1145.87" dur="5.61">help or do anything leadership told</text>
  <text start="1149.13" dur="4.69">non-essential personnel to go home and</text>
  <text start="1151.48" dur="7.439">only key leaders to stay behind</text>
  <text start="1153.82" dur="8.339">oh wow so you a you were told to stand</text>
  <text start="1158.919" dur="5.19">down almost that&amp;#39;s correct we were told</text>
  <text start="1162.159" dur="5.85">to stand down and just do our job as far</text>
  <text start="1164.109" dur="5.79">as training mission yours really be but</text>
  <text start="1168.009" dur="4.29">then we we can fast forward that to</text>
  <text start="1169.899" dur="3.24">after the attacks and we get what called</text>
  <text start="1172.299" dur="3.24">reflections</text>
  <text start="1173.139" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s post attack analysis we try to</text>
  <text start="1175.539" dur="4.47">find out who&amp;#39;s talking to who on the</text>
  <text start="1177.129" dur="4.86">ground who said they saw what and what</text>
  <text start="1180.009" dur="3.6">information we can come up with there</text>
  <text start="1181.989" dur="4.5">was a great deal of that that had come</text>
  <text start="1183.609" dur="4.861">in and we didn&amp;#39;t know who was gonna</text>
  <text start="1186.489" dur="5.24">action that or we didn&amp;#39;t know if anybody</text>
  <text start="1188.47" dur="3.259">was going to actually not either</text>
  <text start="1193.72" dur="5.62">got a question good yeah yeah sorry</text>
  <text start="1196.94" dur="3.9">no people were saying you know guys if</text>
  <text start="1199.34" dur="3.75">you have a question that you want to ask</text>
  <text start="1200.84" dur="5.01">sergeant Cattell you can we got Nikolas</text>
  <text start="1203.09" dur="4.38">back hopefully right now let me bring</text>
  <text start="1205.85" dur="4.62">him in it should just pop in Nick</text>
  <text start="1207.47" dur="4.829">whenever you get a chance if you have a</text>
  <text start="1210.47" dur="3.87">question for either these men while</text>
  <text start="1212.299" dur="4.201">we&amp;#39;re talking super chatted and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1214.34" dur="5.219">stop the conversation and bring you in</text>
  <text start="1216.5" dur="5.37">which is perfect someone asked earlier</text>
  <text start="1219.559" dur="4.951">nothing none of this would have happened</text>
  <text start="1221.87" dur="6.899">without the blessings from Obama would</text>
  <text start="1224.51" dur="6.539">you consider that factual no no okay</text>
  <text start="1228.769" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;ll tell you why that that&amp;#39;s not I mean</text>
  <text start="1231.049" dur="3.72">I know you can make an inference to that</text>
  <text start="1232.639" dur="4.351">and I&amp;#39;m not here to make conjecture or</text>
  <text start="1234.769" dur="5.461">opinion that doesn&amp;#39;t matter from my</text>
  <text start="1236.99" dur="5.069">position mm-hmm but there&amp;#39;s a great deal</text>
  <text start="1240.23" dur="4.559">of information that gets pushed and</text>
  <text start="1242.059" dur="4.891">pulled from the White House to different</text>
  <text start="1244.789" dur="5.281">commands to different combatant commands</text>
  <text start="1246.95" dur="4.979">and they all have a sequence of</text>
  <text start="1250.07" dur="4.979">following you know instruction and order</text>
  <text start="1251.929" dur="5.781">but one thing for sure that the</text>
  <text start="1255.049" dur="5.61">questioner can ask or be answered to is</text>
  <text start="1257.71" dur="4.63">no matter what when we have personnel in</text>
  <text start="1260.659" dur="5.191">harm&amp;#39;s way we don&amp;#39;t leave them hanging</text>
  <text start="1262.34" dur="6.24">and commanders are duty-bound to go and</text>
  <text start="1265.85" dur="4.949">rescue them now if let&amp;#39;s say if a</text>
  <text start="1268.58" dur="4.68">command order was given to stand down</text>
  <text start="1270.799" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s an unlawful order all of us took</text>
  <text start="1273.26" dur="5.399">an oath we do not abide unlawful orders</text>
  <text start="1276.289" dur="4.081">let&amp;#39;s take that&amp;#39;s tantamount to ordering</text>
  <text start="1278.659" dur="4.26">troops to kill innocent civilians we</text>
  <text start="1280.37" dur="5.399">don&amp;#39;t do that that&amp;#39;s illegal and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1282.919" dur="4.441">unlawful so that can&amp;#39;t be followed so</text>
  <text start="1285.769" dur="2.941">anybody that followed those unlawful</text>
  <text start="1287.36" dur="3.15">orders are the ones we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1288.71" dur="4.559">talking about to the president to ask</text>
  <text start="1290.51" dur="4.95">him to please do the executive order to</text>
  <text start="1293.269" dur="3.78">get them onto the carpet and let&amp;#39;s hold</text>
  <text start="1295.46" dur="3.78">them accountable they had no business</text>
  <text start="1297.049" dur="4.081">doing that you know they took an oath</text>
  <text start="1299.24" dur="3.39">they got their stars on and that was</text>
  <text start="1301.13" dur="3">their duty to take care of the</text>

  <text start="1306.26" dur="4.56">that are in harm&amp;#39;s way right so in the</text>
  <text start="1309.289" dur="3.36">way that you&amp;#39;ll be able to do this is by</text>
  <text start="1310.82" dur="2.91">hitting up these channels right this is</text>
  <text start="1312.649" dur="2.611">what you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re basically going</text>
  <text start="1313.73" dur="3.87">on like a tour of channels and just</text>
  <text start="1315.26" dur="4.08">talking about this exposing because you</text>

  <text start="1675.95" dur="4.469">with stuff and then the fear level for</text>
  <text start="1677.84" dur="6.81">the others is pretty high it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1680.419" dur="6.571">tantamount to you know basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1684.65" dur="4.05">imprisoned in their own way you know</text>

  <text start="2219.49" dur="5.49">any additional weapon I mean they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="2222.25" dur="4.2">the weapons cache that that was</text>
