  <text start="1664.91" dur="5.52">house once you attach it to the land and</text>
  <text start="1667.49" dur="3.54">now it becomes rightful to the owner of</text>
  <text start="1670.43" dur="2.55">the land</text>

  <text start="1945.75" dur="3.84">first of all one start that visit you</text>
  <text start="1947.76" dur="4.77">know this little paradigm is a lie</text>
  <text start="1949.59" dur="6.03">anyway you know remember that the income</text>
  <text start="1952.53" dur="3.72">tax was only supposed to be for two</text>
  <text start="1955.62" dur="3.18">years</text>
  <text start="1956.25" dur="5.58">it was early 1900 I forgot what it was</text>
  <text start="1958.8" dur="4.56">supposed to fund but it was only</text>
  <text start="1961.83" dur="3.57">supposed to be paid for two years and</text>
  <text start="1963.36" dur="4.35">then some what we just kept on you know</text>
  <text start="1965.4" dur="5.04">paying it but of course deals being made</text>
  <text start="1967.71" dur="4.77">I think that was Woodrow Wilson in</text>
  <text start="1970.44" dur="5.61">office at that time but he really was</text>
  <text start="1972.48" dur="7.65">kind of compromised but anyway it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1976.05" dur="7.44">it&amp;#39;s such a a thieving and parasitic way</text>
  <text start="1980.13" dur="5.46">of having a trip it&amp;#39;s basically like</text>
  <text start="1983.49" dur="5.55">you&amp;#39;ve given them your gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1985.59" dur="5.76">and then they give you you know you they</text>
  <text start="1989.04" dur="4.41">print paper money but when it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="1991.35" dur="4.5">pay back you have to pay them back in</text>
  <text start="1993.45" dur="7.92">gold and silver it&amp;#39;s a heck of a scam</text>
  <text start="1995.85" dur="7.8">yes it&amp;#39;s a heck of a scam and let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="2001.37" dur="4.56">what else so I don&amp;#39;t think it basically</text>
  <text start="2003.65" dur="4.08">you know what like even in the better</text>
  <text start="2005.93" dur="4.29">bar you know that&amp;#39;s the British</text>
  <text start="2007.73" dur="6.65">accreditation registry so even our</text>
  <text start="2010.22" dur="9.03">lawyers or attorneys are still really</text>
  <text start="2014.38" dur="7.09">under the rule of Britain so we have to</text>
  <text start="2019.25" dur="4.14">see evidence of all this stuff changing</text>
  <text start="2021.47" dur="4.65">you know it&amp;#39;s good to know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2023.39" dur="7.26">being exposed but we also have to demand</text>
  <text start="2026.12" dur="6.15">it right yeah we have to rise yeah I</text>
  <text start="2030.65" dur="3.45">surprised enough you know first of all</text>
  <text start="2032.27" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s like a power then isn&amp;#39;t knowing it</text>
  <text start="2034.1" dur="7.11">but also I think also to promise anyone</text>
  <text start="2038.42" dur="4.5">we really are under the use of sorcery</text>
  <text start="2041.21" dur="4.32">and magic and people think that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2042.92" dur="6.84">ridiculous but it&amp;#39;s not we just been</text>
  <text start="2045.53" dur="5.95">under a hedge and it&amp;#39;s been you think of</text>
  <text start="2049.76" dur="5.169">and we see this stuff happen we</text>
  <text start="2051.48" dur="5.85">been brainwashed from little with movies</text>
  <text start="2054.929" dur="3.75">and and and everything and we need to</text>
  <text start="2057.33" dur="4.14">stop calling propaganda propaganda</text>
  <text start="2058.679" dur="5.97">propaganda is a lie because even when we</text>
  <text start="2061.47" dur="6">changed with ally means propaganda</text>
  <text start="2064.649" dur="4.791">that&amp;#39;s a lie propaganda is lying so</text>
  <text start="2067.47" dur="4.889">we&amp;#39;ve you know we&amp;#39;ve been under that</text>
  <text start="2069.44" dur="4.84">ferociously for you anyway that was</text>
  <text start="2072.359" dur="13.621">wrong when to say I&amp;#39;m so sorry Hilda</text>

  <text start="2102.21" dur="7.14">se we&amp;#39;ve in this like dark mist heavy</text>
  <text start="2106.92" dur="6.439">and what they&amp;#39;re doing to keep that up</text>
  <text start="2109.35" dur="7.41">is we have the power of prayer and also</text>
  <text start="2113.359" dur="5.531">kind of just reversing it by believing</text>
  <text start="2116.76" dur="3.95">and knowing what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="2118.89" dur="9.15">these people are doing the darkest</text>
  <text start="2120.71" dur="10.03">ugliest thing it is murder and it and</text>
