  <text start="168.44" dur="6.27">pavilion I went over a podcast the other</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="5.85">day and this is just validation for it</text>
  <text start="174.71" dur="5.31">the story was from about four or five</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="7.02">years ago a gentleman who was high up in</text>
  <text start="180.02" dur="8.58">security basically used key codes to get</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="8.1">in to a behind a steel door found a lot</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="6.87">of basically children&amp;#39;s furniture and so</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="6.03">on and so forth very strange eerie rooms</text>
  <text start="195.47" dur="6.239">where people were not allowed to go and</text>
  <text start="198.53" dur="5.16">a gentleman by the name of Opie has sent</text>
  <text start="201.709" dur="4.681">me this article that I&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="4.5">before and I ties everything and it just</text>
  <text start="206.39" dur="3.72">validates it so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="4.08">into it and we&amp;#39;ll also get into some</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="3.69">images a little later so it says here</text>
  <text start="212.27" dur="3.96">and this is actually before I start this</text>
  <text start="213.8" dur="4.92">is actually the home that the guy was</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="4.47">talking about in the last podcast and I</text>
  <text start="218.72" dur="4.83">will link that video in the description</text>
  <text start="220.7" dur="4.5">box below moving forward I see I know</text>
  <text start="223.55" dur="3.27">the whole idea of a secret bedroom</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="4.2">highly intrigue some of you</text>
  <text start="226.82" dur="4.53">never mind wanted Epcot I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="229.4" dur="2.91">what type of person gets intrigued by</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="3.27">secret bedrooms</text>
  <text start="232.31" dur="3.899">I guess you in case you&amp;#39;re wondering if</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s a fancy guest room like in the</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="5.221">Cinderella Castle suite the answer is no</text>
  <text start="238.61" dur="4.38">you can&amp;#39;t stay there to my best to the</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="5.13">best of my knowledge no one has ever</text>
  <text start="242.99" dur="5.04">stayed there not even a card walker so</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="3.54">that adds to the people who carry the</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="4.14">cards remember that gentleman said that</text>
  <text start="250.1" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s not even an entryway into that</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="3.42">bedroom which is very strange so</text>
  <text start="254.09" dur="3.119">obviously there&amp;#39;s one that&amp;#39;s hidden and</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.35">if you&amp;#39;re the tide that likes the idea</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="5.791">of a secret bedroom for shall we say</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="4.979">less disney reasons it&amp;#39;s off-limits for</text>
  <text start="263" dur="4.43">that too unless you&amp;#39;re a good climber</text>
  <text start="264.919" dur="4.921">the secret bedroom is believe it or not</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="5.65">part of the living with the</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="5.97">land boat ride it has existed since day</text>
  <text start="273.08" dur="4.2">one but the reason I never noticed it</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="4.26">before is because it&amp;#39;s not visible</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="5.01">visible from the ride at all an early</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="4.47">model of the boat ride note that you</text>
  <text start="282.29" dur="4.77">actually the actual ride is a mirror</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="4.34">image of this layout so basically you</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="4.53">can see that this is a giant image</text>
  <text start="288.88" dur="5.17">pretty much an early model of it right</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="3.96">to get a glimpse into this fully themed</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="4.619">highly immersive and wonderful</text>
  <text start="295.55" dur="6.21">environment you have to plunk down $35</text>
  <text start="298.669" dur="5.611">plus tip for the character dinner at the</text>
  <text start="301.76" dur="4.92">Garden Grill restaurant this is not</text>
  <text start="304.28" dur="4.26">something I do often however last Sunday</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="4.26">we decided to go to the garden grill for</text>
  <text start="308.54" dur="4.02">the first time and maybe 15 years and I</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="4.14">came face to face with the secret</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="4.169">bedroom as you probably know the garden</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="3.75">grill is unique in the whole restaurant</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="5.041">is constantly rotating on a giant</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="4.89">turntable when Epcot Center first opened</text>
  <text start="321.77" dur="3.89">the restaurant was called the good turn</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="3.84">which seems like a more fitting name</text>
  <text start="325.66" dur="4.479">thankfully Disney changed it to</text>
  <text start="327.56" dur="4.2">something much more bland to match the</text>
  <text start="330.139" dur="3.721">food hardy-har-har</text>
  <text start="331.76" dur="3.75">right to double down on clever</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="3.63">restaurant gimmicks the garden grill</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="4.26">actually overlooks several scenes from</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.08">living with the land boat ride to this</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.29">day I still remember the elegant</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="4.64">phrasing used by Harry and Abrams in his</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="5.1">classic book Walt Disney&amp;#39;s Epcot Center</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="6.07">where else can you have a in quote</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="5.1">Prairie with your prime rib desert with</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="4.41">your desert desert with your desert</text>
  <text start="354.26" dur="4.76">right mmm delicious we see here and this</text>
  <text start="356.69" dur="4.86">is the desert he was talking about in</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="4.39">practice the rainforest area comes first</text>
  <text start="361.55" dur="3.9">followed by the desert Prairie and</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="4.35">finally the American farm complete with</text>
  <text start="365.45" dur="4.23">a large-scale farmhouse from the boat</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="3.629">ride as you float by the farmhouse you</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="3.75">can see the dog barking from the porch</text>
  <text start="371.389" dur="5.041">the rooster crowing from the mailbox and</text>
  <text start="373.43" dur="4.56">if you happen to look up parky ologists</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="3.69">emptying their wallets in an average</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="5.04">restaurant for a couple of hasty photos</text>
  <text start="380.12" dur="4.769">with with a disinterested duo of Chip</text>
  <text start="383.03" dur="5.21">and Dale and if you think of yesterday</text>
  <text start="384.889" dur="6.481">guys when I released the other podcast</text>
  <text start="388.24" dur="5.08">it just seems as though someone is</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="5.76">almost dug into this you know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="6.659">actually gone to this place looking for</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="5.75">this particular room very strange so</text>
  <text start="399.979" dur="4.641">obviously it&amp;#39;s all lining up to be true</text>
  <text start="402.88" dur="4.08">and I try I believed it when I read this</text>
  <text start="404.62" dur="3.9">yesterday right in this lighting it</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="2.64">looks like the house from Halloween and</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="3.93">this is the house that they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="409.6" dur="5.49">about there it is a full-on themed</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="5.34">secret bedroom right there in the ride</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="4.62">the window in the a-frame is not really</text>
  <text start="417.79" dur="3.87">visible either from the ride or the</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="4.17">restaurant but you can see lights</text>
  <text start="421.66" dur="4.23">burning in there the window on the left</text>
  <text start="423.88" dur="5.19">side of the house directly faces the</text>
  <text start="425.89" dur="5.7">restaurant let&amp;#39;s zoom in juice a slice</text>
  <text start="429.07" dur="3.93">just a slice of Americana and a weather</text>
  <text start="431.59" dur="4.32">vane that looks like it might slice</text>
  <text start="433" dur="5.25">someone up in a good horror movie so</text>
  <text start="435.91" dur="4.56">pretty much what he says is you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="438.25" dur="4.92">even barely see into this place into</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="5.1">this bedroom without it facing perfectly</text>
  <text start="443.17" dur="5.04">the restaurant for about 20 to 30</text>
  <text start="445.57" dur="4.92">seconds that&amp;#39;s why it says let&amp;#39;s zoom in</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s got a quilt on the bed a nice</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="4.47">antique globe in the corner and a few</text>
  <text start="452.29" dur="4.68">Gaslight lights burning there&amp;#39;s a model</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="4.8">train on the nightstand and behind it is</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="5.34">a tennis racket a bowling pin Nagin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="4.95">barbed wire bat Lucille whatever it is</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s a lot of props it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="464.71" dur="4.65">Disney is giving tours in there like</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="4.11">with Walt&amp;#39;s fire station apartment the</text>
  <text start="469.36" dur="3.66">only difference is this room seems to be</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="3.78">set up solely for guests who are more</text>
  <text start="473.02" dur="4.53">interested in taking pictures with Pluto</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="5.67">an illuminated barely glimpsed secret</text>
  <text start="477.55" dur="5.58">bedroom that might enter your peripheral</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="5.94">vision for half a minute as you rotate</text>
  <text start="483.13" dur="4.86">pass from 15 feet away so guys another</text>
  <text start="486.46" dur="5.33">thing I want to add in off-the-cuff I</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="6.57">don&amp;#39;t think this person knows of what is</text>
  <text start="491.79" dur="4.48">that what Disney is capable of doing</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="4.35">what these monsters are doing Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="4.56">spirit cooking child trafficking so on</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="3.09">and so forth I think this person is just</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="3.45">interested in the fact that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="502" dur="4.74">secret bedroom and we just know a little</text>
  <text start="504.28" dur="4.74">bit more of what&amp;#39;s going on and I can</text>

  <text start="547.66" dur="2.94">were going to say if this was fate</text>
  <text start="549.01" dur="4.19">because if they said it was fake I knew</text>
