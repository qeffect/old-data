  <text start="310.01" dur="4.29">I have started to learn I would</text>
  <text start="312.2" dur="4.17">encourage others to do the same it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="3.75">simple by any means as they&amp;#39;ve changed</text>
  <text start="316.37" dur="5.57">and evolved through the years like</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="6.54">chameleons they were hits Phoenicians</text>
  <text start="321.94" dur="5.14">Babylonians and Romans this looks like</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="5.04">an artifact rather dug up from the</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="4.68">ground right Canaanites managed to</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="3.93">infiltrate and deceive in order to make</text>

  <text start="333.56" dur="4.56">and structures on epstein Island child</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="5.13">and human sacrifice we have to</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="5.49">understand the enemy this truly is a</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="5.55">spiritual battle good versus evil and I</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="4.83">say this all the time about duality I</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="4.23">speak about duality and good versus evil</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="4.86">good is winning and it&amp;#39;s probably very</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="5.87">many a many year thousands of years of</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="4.98">good that are we are awakening to but is</text>
  <text start="356.5" dur="3.82">evil gone forever</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="5.759">absolutely not we will always have</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="6.24">duality because if you don&amp;#39;t have evil</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="4.621">you don&amp;#39;t know what evil is you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="4.44">know what good is you have to know what</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="5.25">evil is to understand good thus the</text>
  <text start="371" dur="4.56">duality so we can see here Epstein</text>
  <text start="373.91" dur="3.569">Island these pictures right here and</text>
  <text start="375.56" dur="6.99">then all of a sudden we see it down here</text>

  <text start="382.55" dur="5.88">Island and mosques in Aleppo the same</text>
  <text start="384.95" dur="5.58">thing I&amp;#39;m no expert on this topic by any</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="2.94">means he says since following QED I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="3.37">started to learn</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="3.88">I would encourage others to do the same</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="3.33">and this is when he was talking about</text>
  <text start="395.25" dur="4.47">the chameleons and so forth so on and so</text>

  <text start="550.47" dur="4.95">this is also far above us and I think</text>
  <text start="553.35" dur="4.35">that all of the elites know this they</text>

  <text start="568.44" dur="3.27">us but it&amp;#39;s not only we couldn&amp;#39;t learn</text>
  <text start="569.79" dur="3.09">it obviously scientists are learning</text>

  <text start="572.88" dur="5.64">there but I guarantee you it is 100%</text>
  <text start="575.4" dur="5.79">suppressed so as you can see see here</text>

  <text start="670.64" dur="5.19">that Moloch was another name for milcom</text>
  <text start="672.74" dur="5.16">the chief deity of the ammonites but</text>
  <text start="675.83" dur="4.53">this view has fallen out of the favor</text>
  <text start="677.9" dur="4.95">because of more recent research the name</text>
  <text start="680.36" dur="5.64">of Moloch was most likely a title or</text>
  <text start="682.85" dur="5.79">epithet for a deity rather than the</text>
  <text start="686" dur="5.33">actual name it is common in Phoenician</text>

  <text start="701.63" dur="5.16">translates to king of man we can check</text>
  <text start="704.9" dur="4.29">out this picture right here obviously</text>
  <text start="706.79" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re serving him a child up here in</text>
  <text start="709.19" dur="3.48">the top is this a real thing or a statue</text>
  <text start="711.44" dur="4.11">you get my drift</text>
  <text start="712.67" dur="5.19">did these did these gods you know people</text>
  <text start="715.55" dur="4.92">with wings and so on and so forth did</text>
  <text start="717.86" dur="4.83">this happen was this around then one</text>
  <text start="720.47" dur="4.71">would imagine why would they just build</text>
  <text start="722.69" dur="3.09">statues after them right I believe it to</text>
  <text start="725.18" dur="4.11">be true</text>
  <text start="725.78" dur="6.15">Moloch and Baal Haddad once suggested</text>
  <text start="729.29" dur="6.06">identity for Moloch is the canaanites</text>
  <text start="731.93" dur="5.34">deity Baal Haddad or Haddad Haddad was</text>
  <text start="735.35" dur="4.32">considered the king of the gods by the</text>
  <text start="737.27" dur="4.14">ancient Canaanites evidence that Moloch</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="3.63">can be identified with him comes from</text>
  <text start="741.41" dur="4.41">the fact that the pagan altars in the</text>
  <text start="743.3" dur="4.29">valley of been he Nome where children</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="4.97">were sacrificed and also described as</text>
  <text start="747.59" dur="6.6">altars to Baal by the Prophet Jeremiah</text>
  <text start="750.79" dur="6.55">furthermore Azorean tanks state that the</text>
  <text start="754.19" dur="5.82">child sacrifices were made to ad odd the</text>
  <text start="757.34" dur="5.73">Assyrian equivalent of the Canaanites</text>
  <text start="760.01" dur="6.09">Haddad so you have a dodd with no h&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="763.07" dur="5.76">and then Haddad one being a Syrian one</text>
  <text start="766.1" dur="4.65">being Canaanite this makes it reasonable</text>
  <text start="768.83" dur="4.41">to suggest that the child sacrifices may</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="4.62">have been made to Haddad and that a cult</text>
  <text start="773.24" dur="3.09">of child sacrifice may have been related</text>
  <text start="775.37" dur="4.02">to him</text>
  <text start="776.33" dur="6.27">so obviously Haddad is definitely ball</text>
  <text start="779.39" dur="6.99">and we can see here that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="782.6" dur="5.79">that child sacrifices may have been</text>
  <text start="786.38" dur="4.71">given to Haddad</text>
  <text start="788.39" dur="3.87">and that there was also a cult that was</text>
  <text start="791.09" dur="3.24">related to him</text>
  <text start="792.26" dur="4.29">so a cult following right and then we</text>
  <text start="794.33" dur="4.26">can see him being carried here very</text>
  <text start="796.55" dur="5.88">strange god of weather or hurricanes</text>
  <text start="798.59" dur="5.52">storms thunder and rain Haddad right so</text>
  <text start="802.43" dur="4.65">do you think they&amp;#39;re worshiping this</text>
  <text start="804.11" dur="7.02">entity and maybe then bringing storms</text>
  <text start="807.08" dur="6.51">into it onto the shores or earthquakes</text>
  <text start="811.13" dur="6.48">or fire so on and so forth and then they</text>
  <text start="813.59" dur="5.91">use geoengineering to even exacerbate it</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="4.47">right could that be possible</text>
  <text start="819.5" dur="5.16">nothing&amp;#39;s nothing&amp;#39;s out of reach at this</text>
  <text start="822.08" dur="4.2">point the cult of Moloch in the biblical</text>
  <text start="824.66" dur="4.11">account children are said to have been</text>

  <text start="834.02" dur="4.5">valley of ABBA Nome although it is most</text>
  <text start="836.39" dur="4.59">likely that this practice was due to an</text>

  <text start="840.98" dur="5.07">also been suggested that the Judah hits</text>

  <text start="852.71" dur="3.96">either way the prophets harshly</text>

  <text start="901.67" dur="4.35">scholars dispute this suggestion saying</text>
  <text start="903.8" dur="5.55">that the qartheen ian&amp;#39;s practice</text>
  <text start="906.02" dur="4.56">differed from the cult of Moloch so</text>
  <text start="909.35" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re two different a little bit of</text>
  <text start="910.58" dur="3.39">difference in there it&amp;#39;s commonly</text>

  <text start="969.92" dur="3.21">commonly believed that the child</text>

  <text start="977.18" dur="4.2">whereas child sacrifice is said to have</text>
  <text start="979.34" dur="4.74">been a regular part of the cult of</text>
  <text start="981.38" dur="5.55">Moloch and this is who they worship guys</text>
  <text start="984.08" dur="5.22">this is who they worship on the other</text>
  <text start="986.93" dur="4.32">hand it isn&amp;#39;t necessarily clear from the</text>
  <text start="989.3" dur="3.78">biblical text that child sacrifice was</text>

  <text start="995.45" dur="4.5">also have only involved sacrifice of</text>
  <text start="997.37" dur="4.05">children in times of crisis or it may</text>
  <text start="999.95" dur="4.2">have occurred on only on special</text>

  <text start="1006.97" dur="4.62">practices are attested in other parts of</text>
  <text start="1009.37" dur="4.47">the ancient Mediterranean as a result</text>
  <text start="1011.59" dur="3.87">there is necessarily a reason to think</text>
  <text start="1013.84" dur="4.77">that one cult involved regular</text>
  <text start="1015.46" dur="3.99">sacrifices while the other did not child</text>
  <text start="1018.61" dur="3.45">sacrifice</text>
  <text start="1019.45" dur="4.26">or initiation another major point of</text>
  <text start="1022.06" dur="2.879">contention in the study of Moloch is</text>
  <text start="1023.71" dur="4.109">whether or not children were sacrificed</text>
  <text start="1024.939" dur="5.161">at all some scholars as well as ancient</text>
  <text start="1027.819" dur="4.081">rabbis have suggested that the pass</text>
  <text start="1030.1" dur="4.77">through the fire meant passing between</text>
  <text start="1031.9" dur="6.15">rows of fire in an initiation rite in</text>

  <text start="1038.05" dur="4.409">of Moloch condemned by the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="1040.03" dur="5.49">prophets was Jewish children being</text>
  <text start="1042.459" dur="4.831">initiated into paganism thus children</text>
  <text start="1045.52" dur="3.75">were not actually sacrificed at all and</text>
  <text start="1047.29" dur="3.96">it was the initiation ceremony that</text>
  <text start="1049.27" dur="3.72">alarmed the prophets there are some</text>
  <text start="1051.25" dur="3.33">problems with this view however</text>
  <text start="1052.99" dur="2.97">although there are some cases where the</text>
  <text start="1054.58" dur="3.54">text could be referring to something</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="4.14">like this initiation right there are</text>
  <text start="1058.12" dur="4.83">also cases where passing through fire is</text>
  <text start="1060.1" dur="5.189">clearly referring to burning furthermore</text>
  <text start="1062.95" dur="4.109">ancient near-eastern texts give good</text>
  <text start="1065.289" dur="4.431">reason to believe that actual child</text>
  <text start="1067.059" dur="5.1">sacrifice occurred of course it did</text>
  <text start="1069.72" dur="4.51">uncertainty remains there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="1072.159" dur="3.841">uncertainty regarding Moloch though a</text>
  <text start="1074.23" dur="3.99">few things can be said with relative</text>
  <text start="1076" dur="4.32">confidence it is clear from biblical and</text>
  <text start="1078.22" dur="5.55">ancient near-eastern sources that Moloch</text>
  <text start="1080.32" dur="6.15">was probably a title or epithet excuse</text>
  <text start="1083.77" dur="4.98">me epithet used for a prominent</text>
  <text start="1086.47" dur="4.74">Canaanite deity to whom children were at</text>
  <text start="1088.75" dur="5.25">least occasionally sacrificed this deity</text>
  <text start="1091.21" dur="5.969">was either a foreign deity or he may</text>
  <text start="1094" dur="5.73">have been mischaracterization of Yahweh</text>
  <text start="1097.179" dur="5.431">himself though this is one of the less</text>
  <text start="1099.73" dur="6.929">likely explanations beyond this there is</text>
  <text start="1102.61" dur="6.059">still so much to learn and guys we can</text>
  <text start="1106.659" dur="4.411">bring this into modern times we can</text>
  <text start="1108.669" dur="4.351">bring this into planned parenthood we</text>
  <text start="1111.07" dur="3.87">can bring this in the spirit cooking do</text>
  <text start="1113.02" dur="4.74">you think they do this just to do it</text>
  <text start="1114.94" dur="6.15">just to get a good laugh or to pretend</text>
  <text start="1117.76" dur="4.919">no they are doing these ancient texts</text>
  <text start="1121.09" dur="4.8">and they brought them into modern times</text>
