  <text start="89.28" dur="3.69">more eyes on the truth with that being</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="4.86">said my friends let&amp;#39;s go ahead and hop</text>
  <text start="92.97" dur="5.88">into it this is true reporting so as I</text>
  <text start="96.299" dur="6.471">said just have to finish saying that</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="9.269">this is referring to AQ group back in</text>
  <text start="102.77" dur="8.29">what is this June 2013 so we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="5.07">six years ago right so what does that</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="7.04">tell me that tells me that this Q group</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="8.671">Q team has been around for a long time</text>
  <text start="118.1" dur="7.33">part of the NSA we all know that and we</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="7.47">know that Edward snowed Snowden had Q</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="6.77">clearance so what I&amp;#39;m suggesting is that</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="5.659">I don&amp;#39;t think that this Q group was a</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="6.39">out to be activated until we got until</text>
  <text start="134.989" dur="5.841">they got their guy in POTUS djt they</text>
  <text start="138.59" dur="6.899">needed someone to get in there because</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="6.28">the NSA was exposing everyone and we all</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="3.78">knew that that was always in the</text>
  <text start="147.11" dur="5.099">mainstream media that the government is</text>
  <text start="149.269" dur="5.491">watching you there&amp;#39;s no privacy well in</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="4.981">my opinion maybe they had to do that so</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="6.089">that they could track these enemies</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="6.689">these enemy combatants as q so</text>
  <text start="160.849" dur="6.121">eloquently puts it and if Hillary</text>
  <text start="163.879" dur="4.531">Clinton you know was president none of</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="3.48">this would have happened it would have</text>
  <text start="168.41" dur="5.609">been a purge it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been such</text>
  <text start="170.45" dur="6.119">a smooth operation so I will continue</text>
  <text start="174.019" dur="4.921">with the article it says even before</text>
  <text start="176.569" dur="4.17">last week&amp;#39;s revelations by The Guardian</text>
  <text start="178.94" dur="4.409">newspaper that the National Security</text>
  <text start="180.739" dur="5.22">Agency the NSA was collecting call</text>
  <text start="183.349" dur="5.131">records from telecommunication companies</text>
  <text start="185.959" dur="5.491">and had the ability to mine user data</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="5.28">from major US Internet companies the</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="4.56">internet or the NSA was already on the</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="4.53">trail of the leaker according to two</text>
  <text start="196.01" dur="6.3">former u.s. intelligent officers with</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="6.449">close ties to the agency on Sunday the</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="4.98">Guardian revealed its source a 29 year</text>
  <text start="204.739" dur="6">old former US Army soldier in CIA</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="5.22">employee named Edward Snowden now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.739" dur="3.661">remember he is a plant</text>
  <text start="212.51" dur="4.58">he was planted in there to leak</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="8.399">information obviously to the deep States</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="7.84">and one thing that completely validates</text>
  <text start="222.799" dur="4.651">that that he&amp;#39;s a black hat is because</text>
  <text start="224.93" dur="5.85">the MSM back then was making him out to</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="5.099">be a patriot he&amp;#39;s not a patriot and we</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="3.859">know that the MSM is the greatest threat</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="4.681">to the American people correct</text>
  <text start="234.639" dur="5.111">Snowden who worked as a contract</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="4.259">employee at an NSA station in Hawaii</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="4.019">said he agreed to have his identity</text>
  <text start="241.489" dur="4.08">revealed because he feared that the NSA</text>
  <text start="243.769" dur="3.241">would put pressure on his family and</text>
  <text start="245.569" dur="3.871">friends for information about his</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="5.43">whereabouts again he&amp;#39;s a black hat the</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="6.81">NSA the Q team are white hat so you can</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="5.159">see the optics within this article even</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="4.38">six years ago</text>
  <text start="257.599" dur="6.091">that&amp;#39;s how awake we&amp;#39;ve become right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="4.79">awesome from a hotel in Hong Kong he</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="3.29">told the Guardian he expected he</text>
  <text start="265.42" dur="3.78">would never be allowed to return home</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="4.52">and that he could end up in prison or</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="4.77">murder because of his decision to leak</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="5.29">again they&amp;#39;re making him out to be a</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="5.06">good guy the people who began chasing</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="5.1">Snowden work for the associate a</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="4.93">Directorate for security and</text>
  <text start="281.89" dur="4.2">counterintelligence according to former</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="4.74">US intelligence officers who spoke on</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="6.56">condition of anonymity the Directorate</text>
  <text start="288.7" dur="6.45">sometimes known as the Q group is</text>
  <text start="292.65" dur="4.54">continuing to track Snowden now that he</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="4.11">has outed himself as the Guardian source</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="4.08">according to the intelligence officers</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="3.69">Snowden began final preparations for his</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="4.23">departure three weeks ago</text>
  <text start="302.95" dur="4.83">The Guardian reports copying the final</text>
  <text start="305.5" dur="3.84">documents he intended to share telling</text>
  <text start="307.78" dur="3.27">his supervisor that he would need time</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="4.37">off for medical treatment and his</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="5.13">girlfriend simply that he would be away</text>
  <text start="313.71" dur="3.7">that is not an uncommon occurrence for</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="3.54">someone who has spent the last decade</text>
  <text start="317.41" dur="4.77">working in the intelligence world he</text>
  <text start="319.72" dur="4.8">told the paper in his interview from</text>

  <text start="383.35" dur="6.12">information and abide by the law and</text>
  <text start="386.35" dur="4.8">what he is saying is true but back then</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="4.53">the mainstream media was trying to flip</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="6.12">it saying that Snowden as a patriot and</text>
  <text start="394" dur="4.61">he&amp;#39;s trying to help everyone out even</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="3.53">exposing everyone</text>

  <text start="407.189" dur="3.66">chased around Hong Kong we remember all</text>
  <text start="409.379" dur="5.401">of that from the queue post and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="410.849" dur="6.421">gonna get into that right after this so</text>
  <text start="414.78" dur="5.099">yeah again he does have Q clearance we</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="4.889">remember because Q anon told us it</text>
