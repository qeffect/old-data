  <text start="213.84" dur="5.76">in the afternoon time but it starts off</text>
  <text start="217.35" dur="4.98">by saying and my previous articles neon</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="5.13">revolt says I&amp;#39;ve detailed the efforts of</text>
  <text start="222.33" dur="5.04">one Frederic Brennan the previous</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="5.46">founder and owner of eight you know what</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="5.49">to continuously D platform the newest</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="6.06">image born owned and operated by the</text>
  <text start="232.86" dur="5.43">Watkins named Aitken anyone who has been</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="3.93">watching this space for a while knows</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="4.35">how incredibly frustrating it&amp;#39;s been to</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="4.92">watch Brennan launch d platforming</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="5.49">efforts after a deep platforming effort</text>
  <text start="245.1" dur="5.25">upon a coon forcing them to hop from</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="4.59">service provider to service provider and</text>
  <text start="250.35" dur="5.819">they fight to come back online in a</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="5.46">fully operational capacity so guys again</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="3.661">neon revolt is just telling us and if</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="4.47">you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on basically</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="4.71">when everyone talks about when 17 posts</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="3.66">he posts on these boards that were</text>
  <text start="264.54" dur="3.9">formerly on h-hand</text>
  <text start="266.31" dur="4.65">now they will be on 8 kun and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="5.94">battle between the original owner and</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="7.26">now the current owner Jim Watkins the</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="6.21">former owner being Fred Brennan and guys</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="4.53">this is just going on and on and on and</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s really just frustrating as we can</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="4.38">see neon revolts saying to so many</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="4.44">people who want to get on the boards but</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="4.62">I believe they may have found an outlet</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="4.229">we see here the most recent example of</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="4.8">this has been Brennan getting two cows</text>
  <text start="293.729" dur="5.161">to lock a Coons new domain after all</text>
  <text start="296.55" dur="4.71">several weeks long messaging campaign</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="4.92">this guy does not give up everybody</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="4.38">Thanks to everyone who emailed to cows I</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="2.469">hope we get a statement from them soon</text>
  <text start="305.64" dur="2.139">about</text>
  <text start="306.279" dur="4.23">they acted and I hope they won&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="307.779" dur="5.64">the domain to be moved out they will</text>
  <text start="310.509" dur="6.27">also terminate NT technology as a</text>
  <text start="313.419" dur="6.81">reseller for ignoring the ban to Cal&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.779" dur="4.05">placed on H hands domains before I log</text>
  <text start="320.229" dur="3.33">off</text>
  <text start="320.829" dur="5.58">may as well report a coon status this</text>
  <text start="323.559" dur="5.52">will be a thread to Cal still has the</text>
  <text start="326.409" dur="5.13">eight Coon net domain in client hold</text>
  <text start="329.079" dur="4.71">then he has the emoji face of laughing</text>
  <text start="331.539" dur="4.74">hope they don&amp;#39;t allow it transfer out to</text>
  <text start="333.789" dur="4.11">another register even bulletproof</text>
  <text start="336.279" dur="5.13">hosting can&amp;#39;t help them without a</text>
  <text start="337.899" dur="5.82">complicit registry registrar so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.409" dur="5.85">happening if I understood correctly is</text>
  <text start="343.719" dur="6.66">because the a coon net domain is not old</text>
  <text start="347.259" dur="5.07">like eight Chan net it couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="350.379" dur="4.68">immediately transferred when at two</text>
  <text start="352.329" dur="4.83">Cal&amp;#39;s D platform it was registered on</text>
  <text start="355.059" dur="5.49">September 12th so it should be</text>
  <text start="357.159" dur="6.33">transformed transferable soon November</text>
  <text start="360.549" dur="4.59">12th which is tomorrow so guys it looks</text>
  <text start="363.489" dur="4.05">like they&amp;#39;ve been dropped they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.139" dur="4.89">dropping the a Coon net that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="367.539" dur="6.02">looks like so who is record domain tools</text>
  <text start="370.029" dur="6.09">are losing this domain a coon net and</text>
  <text start="373.559" dur="5.62">then we can see here registers can</text>
  <text start="376.119" dur="6.27">choose to deny domains name transfer a</text>
  <text start="379.179" dur="5.58">request within 60 days of a window after</text>
  <text start="382.389" dur="7.23">the original domain is registrated it</text>
  <text start="384.759" dur="7.5">can it is a real ICANN thing so and of</text>
  <text start="389.619" dur="5.73">course as you can see two cows</text>
  <text start="392.259" dur="5.52">lock the a tuna net domain and is</text>
  <text start="395.349" dur="4.89">holding it as we assumed until tomorrow</text>
  <text start="397.779" dur="3.96">the 12th of November though it remains</text>
  <text start="400.239" dur="3.72">to be seen if they allow it to be</text>
  <text start="401.739" dur="4.41">transferred so if you&amp;#39;re wondering why</text>
  <text start="403.959" dur="5.16">you haven&amp;#39;t been able to access a Coon</text>
  <text start="406.149" dur="4.59">net on the clear net this is the reason</text>
  <text start="409.119" dur="3.93">why and the clear net is definitely code</text>
  <text start="410.739" dur="4.53">word for you know what their domain was</text>
  <text start="413.049" dur="4.2">effectively locked down due to the</text>
  <text start="415.269" dur="4.29">prolonged deep platforming efforts of</text>
  <text start="417.249" dur="6.09">Brennan in the corporate complicity of</text>
  <text start="419.559" dur="6.09">sites like two cows as such the Watkins</text>
  <text start="423.339" dur="4.83">have decided to decisively navigate</text>
  <text start="425.649" dur="4.68">around this roadblock entirely these</text>

  <text start="570.519" dur="4.651">taken to the heart my friends let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="4.379">forward into some symbolism some memes</text>

  <text start="585.2" dur="4.98">today I know I don&amp;#39;t usually do stuff</text>
  <text start="587.24" dur="5.49">like this but Starbucks coffee you may</text>
  <text start="590.18" dur="4.53">be well aware of this and symbolism will</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="4.95">be their downfall basically it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="4.65">around us and that&amp;#39;s why they have free</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="5.76">range to do whatever they want because</text>
  <text start="599.36" dur="7.11">in the rule the universal law is that we</text>

  <text start="616.55" dur="3.84">process we&amp;#39;re doing it actually more and</text>
  <text start="618.589" dur="3.331">more quicker and quicker as we awaken</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="3.66">but they&amp;#39;re allowed to do these</text>

  <text start="624.05" dur="3.66">against humanity children&amp;#39;s spirit</text>
  <text start="626" dur="4.62">cooking everything like that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.71" dur="4.86">allowed to do this because their</text>
