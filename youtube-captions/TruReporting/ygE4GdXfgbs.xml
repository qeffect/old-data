  <text start="557.14" dur="6.24">unconscious at the time or even alive</text>
  <text start="559.69" dur="5.67">absolutely and where was he in the MCC</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="4.709">where&amp;#39;s the surveillance camera footage</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="4.8">from other parts of the MCC and if he</text>
  <text start="568.089" dur="4.44">wasn&amp;#39;t in his cell to hang himself how</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="4.08">did he die dozens of disturbing</text>
  <text start="572.529" dur="3.391">questions await answers and these new</text>
  <text start="574.24" dur="4.43">wrinkles turned the Justice Department&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.92" dur="5.19">official suicide narrative on its ear</text>

  <text start="593.35" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s the second one not the first one</text>
  <text start="595" dur="3.63">but some federal agents believe the</text>
  <text start="597.13" dur="3.75">truth about what happened to Epstein</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="4.17">just moments before his death is too</text>

  <text start="607.42" dur="4.8">loose in any official capacity and there</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="4.26">is pushback to pursue the information</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="6.48">about Epstein being taken from a cell</text>
  <text start="614.44" dur="7.26">before the 911 FBI insider said my</text>

  <text start="626.68" dur="4.32">back to the Clintons I guarantee you</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="4.11">this is exactly what will happen</text>
  <text start="631" dur="4.77">federal sources said the media including</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="4.26">the New York Times project Mockingbird</text>
  <text start="635.77" dur="3.72">have worked to craft a narrative that</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="4.26">Epstein was ignored by prison guards who</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="4.709">failed to inspect a cell prior to his</text>
  <text start="641.77" dur="4.41">death prison guards even fell asleep</text>
  <text start="644.199" dur="3.991">according to the Times reporting that</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="3.51">information went viral with hundreds of</text>

  <text start="881.63" dur="4.32">existence of such a memo calls into</text>
  <text start="883.64" dur="4.29">questions commis actions both when he</text>

  <text start="892.09" dur="6.81">if the 30th of January 2017 DOJ Flynn</text>
  <text start="896.02" dur="4.8">the memo does exonerate Flynn then it</text>
  <text start="898.9" dur="3.69">will call into question commis actions</text>
  <text start="900.82" dur="2.37">when he had the private meetings with</text>

  <text start="927.91" dur="4.23">where they follow up in early February</text>
  <text start="929.67" dur="4.72">remember the information was leaked by</text>
  <text start="932.14" dur="5.3">senior government officials according to</text>
  <text start="934.39" dur="5.55">the author and columnist David Ignatius</text>
  <text start="937.44" dur="4.75">Ignatius said that senior officials</text>
  <text start="939.94" dur="5.58">accuse Flynn of violating the Logan Act</text>
  <text start="942.19" dur="6.36">even worse conspiring with Russia never</text>

  <text start="954.97" dur="6.42">internal memo of January 30th that Flynn</text>
  <text start="958.09" dur="5.16">in quote was not an agent of Russia was</text>
  <text start="961.39" dur="3.6">enough information for coming to advise</text>
  <text start="963.25" dur="3.33">the president that Flynn had been</text>
  <text start="964.99" dur="4.56">cleared of any wrongdoing</text>
  <text start="966.58" dur="6.69">instead Comey claimed obstruction of</text>
  <text start="969.55" dur="7.7">justice by the president p&amp;#39;omise memos</text>
  <text start="973.27" dur="5.82">versus the DOJ January 2017 Flynn memo</text>
  <text start="977.25" dur="4.33">Comey said in one of the most</text>
  <text start="979.09" dur="5.43">significant memos chronicling his</text>
  <text start="981.58" dur="4.92">February 14 2017 meeting at the Oval</text>
  <text start="984.52" dur="6.06">Office with Trump which was the day</text>
  <text start="986.5" dur="7.2">after Trump had fired Flynn it says here</text>
  <text start="990.58" dur="5.61">that Trump asked everyone but Comey to</text>
  <text start="993.7" dur="5.13">leave the room and told him he wanted in</text>
  <text start="996.19" dur="4.59">quote to talk about Mike Flynn Flynn was</text>
  <text start="998.83" dur="3.54">fired at the time of her controversy</text>
  <text start="1000.78" dur="3.63">that arose from a classified information</text>
  <text start="1002.37" dur="3.71">leaked to the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="4.02">hmm that doesn&amp;#39;t sound too sketchy</text>
  <text start="1006.08" dur="4.84">regarding his conversations by phone in</text>
  <text start="1008.43" dur="6.6">December 2016 with former Russian</text>
  <text start="1010.92" dur="6">ambassador Sergei kids lack the story</text>
  <text start="1015.03" dur="3.33">stated that Flynn had discussed the</text>
  <text start="1016.92" dur="3.72">sanctions with kizlet</text>
  <text start="1018.36" dur="4.17">however Comey later admitted that the</text>
  <text start="1020.64" dur="3.81">FBI agency sent to interview Flynn</text>
  <text start="1022.53" dur="3.18">didn&amp;#39;t believe he was lying about his</text>
  <text start="1024.45" dur="4.08">conversation with the four</text>
  <text start="1025.71" dur="5.55">ambassador according to Comey in the</text>
  <text start="1028.53" dur="5.46">memo to trump it said I hope you can see</text>
  <text start="1031.26" dur="5.73">your way clear to letting this go to</text>
  <text start="1033.99" dur="4.58">letting Flynn go he is a good guy I hope</text>
  <text start="1036.99" dur="3.81">you can let this go</text>
  <text start="1038.57" dur="4.39">however if Comey would have advised</text>
  <text start="1040.8" dur="4.32">Trump on the 30th of January memo it</text>
  <text start="1042.96" dur="5.43">would have cleared up any unfounded lies</text>
  <text start="1045.12" dur="4.98">that Flynn had any in any way colluded</text>
  <text start="1048.39" dur="4.2">or conspired with Russia</text>
  <text start="1050.1" dur="4.77">it looks like Comey who would have been</text>
  <text start="1052.59" dur="5.85">fully aware of this memo has a lot of</text>
  <text start="1054.87" dur="5.85">explaining to do absolutely guys this</text>
