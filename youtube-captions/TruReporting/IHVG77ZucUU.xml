  <text start="133.39" dur="4.62">that was also the trigger for all the</text>
  <text start="135.91" dur="4.41">trolling because it&amp;#39;s almost like that</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="5.16">you have to jump through this fiery hoop</text>
  <text start="140.32" dur="5.039">if you want to become known because the</text>
  <text start="143.17" dur="4.289">trolls they can&amp;#39;t stand it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="145.359" dur="4.5">want anybody who is just nobody this</text>

  <text start="149.859" dur="4.891">modicum of attention on their internet</text>
  <text start="152.23" dur="5.46">and so they destroyed people like that</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="4.62">and boy that and that&amp;#39;s what happened</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="4.59">like I said that happened to me for</text>
  <text start="159.37" dur="6.72">something so long that was I was like</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="5.31">you know in a state of anger and fear</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="5.04">all the time and has a very bad</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="5.64">combination of emotions but once I</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="4.439">started getting established well knew</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="3.24">who I really was then it became easier</text>
  <text start="175.569" dur="3.421">to</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="4.98">no and you know once we were able to out</text>
  <text start="178.99" dur="4.59">shop the Charles I would say the swap</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="6.33">cartoons I have drawn several but that</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="6.72">that one with the the Trump&amp;#39;s swamp</text>
  <text start="187.78" dur="5.73">draining service that was a huge hit but</text>
  <text start="190.3" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;ve had several others like I drew a</text>
  <text start="193.51" dur="5.34">brexit cartoon that was extremely</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="5.64">popular in Europe and it&amp;#39;s been reposted</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="5.97">and republished and you know newsletters</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="5.88">and books and magazines and that one got</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="3.87">a lot of attention and then it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="207.13" dur="3.72">upset the Guardian that they actually</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="4.68">assigned a columnist to write a hit</text>
  <text start="210.85" dur="5.25">piece on me is this the abandoned ship</text>
  <text start="213.37" dur="5.04">one yeah Bandon abandon ship and you</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="7.37">know just because I had that I had the</text>
  <text start="218.41" dur="9.21">temerity to criticize the unlimited</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="8.68">influx of refugees and immigrants and</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="6.56">Muslim in particular into your which and</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;m kind of blunt about it you know that</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="4.78">Islam is a threat to Western</text>
  <text start="236.38" dur="6.42">civilization because Sharia law is not</text>
  <text start="238.96" dur="7.08">compatible with with Western law</text>
  <text start="242.8" dur="6.21">especially our Constitution so this is</text>
  <text start="246.04" dur="5.22">something that do we really want to it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="3.93">kind of like it bothers me that the West</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="4.17">has lost confidence in their own</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="3.99">institutions and therefore and they they</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="3.57">want to be they almost like they want to</text>
  <text start="256.93" dur="3.989">be conquered and this ties into the</text>
  <text start="259" dur="3.72">socialism because they want us to be</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="3.75">conquered especially in there that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="4.29">what it&amp;#39;s all about is to destroy</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="4.471">America so they can out of the ashes</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="5.25">bring up their their socialist</text>
  <text start="269.14" dur="4.95">system that&amp;#39;s why the progressives and</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="4.32">the left and the socialists all want to</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="5.43">portray America is some vile evil place</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="4.83">that and we have to we have to renounce</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="5.67">all of our history we have to tear down</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="6.42">statues we have to you know allow</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="4.41">everybody in the world to come here and</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="5.19">get free stuff it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="289.6" dur="6.15">destruction and you know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="4.71">this postmodern subjective morality</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="4.23">there is no right and wrong there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="297.73" dur="5.28">objective morality that can&amp;#39;t stand that</text>
  <text start="299.98" dur="5.76">so there&amp;#39;s no really any foundation or</text>
  <text start="303.01" dur="3.899">edifice that can be remained that has</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="3.899">allowed to be</text>
  <text start="306.909" dur="4.38">an attacked that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="309.639" dur="4.191">after our freedom of speech that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="311.289" dur="5.25">they want to grab our zhenya on and on</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="5.41">and I could go all day about this but</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="5.97">the source of this is really it goes</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="6.439">back decades ago well I could just name</text>
  <text start="322.509" dur="7.231">one one guy for example there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="325.679" dur="6.94">famous journalist professor named Curtis</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="5.489">MacDougall now this guy wrote textbooks</text>
  <text start="332.619" dur="5.6">that I think they went into like six or</text>
  <text start="335.229" dur="5.94">seven editions and generations of</text>
  <text start="338.219" dur="4.96">journalists were used this textbook it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.169" dur="4.92">called advocate advocacy advocacy</text>
  <text start="343.179" dur="3.96">journalism in other words that I think</text>
  <text start="346.089" dur="2.521">you know what the book was called I</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="3.691">think it was called interpretive</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="4.739">reporting in other words there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="4.559">there&amp;#39;s no you know a fair and balanced</text>
  <text start="353.349" dur="5.28">objective reporting anymore it&amp;#39;s replace</text>
  <text start="355.389" dur="4.62">with let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s sway the audience see</text>
  <text start="358.629" dur="3.87">because you&amp;#39;re doing the right thing</text>
  <text start="360.009" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s that we wanted we want you to go</text>
  <text start="362.499" dur="5.43">out there and twist and distort and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.919" dur="4.2">all paid for you to weave in your</text>
  <text start="367.929" dur="5.251">personal opinions which are basically</text>
  <text start="370.119" dur="5.28">socialist based that&amp;#39;s why we have the</text>
  <text start="373.18" dur="3.689">media we have today that&amp;#39;s their minds</text>
  <text start="375.399" dur="4.47">have all been poisoned by these people</text>
  <text start="376.869" dur="7.25">these teachers at the university to go</text>
  <text start="379.869" dur="6.66">ahead and push as hard as they could</text>
  <text start="384.119" dur="3.79">socialism and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="386.529" dur="5.49">place we are today that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="387.909" dur="6.451">mainstream media always always always on</text>
  <text start="392.019" dur="4.5">this and it goes back to it goes back to</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="4.079">people like Walter Cronkite who has a</text>
  <text start="396.519" dur="3.781">university named after I&amp;#39;m a journalism</text>
  <text start="398.439" dur="3.72">school named after him somewhere but he</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="4.5">never graduated from journalism school</text>
  <text start="402.159" dur="5.16">he he the reason he was allowed to</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="4.589">become so successful is because he had</text>
  <text start="407.319" dur="4.76">kind of a grandfatherly voice but mostly</text>
  <text start="409.389" dur="5.04">he was a globalist and he hated</text>
  <text start="412.079" dur="4.24">nationalism he wanted to destroy work</text>
  <text start="414.429" dur="4.47">and he was like in the 60s and everybody</text>
  <text start="416.319" dur="4.77">trusted him it was a big con game this</text>
  <text start="418.899" dur="5.85">is this is the era where the CIA got</text>
  <text start="421.089" dur="5.67">involved too with their mockingbird yes</text>

  <text start="432.429" dur="6.48">consider yourself on the fringe of being</text>
  <text start="435.729" dur="4.851">conspiratorial or no or do you not want</text>
  <text start="438.909" dur="4.771">to label yourself with that</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.08">well I&amp;#39;m not a conspiracy theorist I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="4.5">the one who shows you actual conspiracy</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="5.82">snow theory is not a theory not a</text>

  <text start="1426.07" dur="4.92">my real cartoons don&amp;#39;t make people mad</text>
  <text start="1428.14" dur="4.35">and I and in a certain level I want to</text>
  <text start="1430.99" dur="2.13">make a bad you know because I want them</text>
  <text start="1432.49" dur="2.82">to be</text>
  <text start="1433.12" dur="4.32">I want my cartoons do you remember and I</text>
  <text start="1435.31" dur="4.02">often say that if you tell somebody</text>
  <text start="1437.44" dur="4.95">something important while punching him</text>
  <text start="1439.33" dur="5.01">in their gut they remember that right so</text>
  <text start="1442.39" dur="3.9">the cartoons are kind of like work on</text>
  <text start="1444.34" dur="3.66">different levels there&amp;#39;s an intellectual</text>
  <text start="1446.29" dur="4.05">level but there&amp;#39;s also this emotional</text>
  <text start="1448" dur="4.56">level and it&amp;#39;s a punch in the gut and so</text>
  <text start="1450.34" dur="4.95">I don&amp;#39;t want to draw something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1452.56" dur="5.31">just something that&amp;#39;s cheap laughs</text>
  <text start="1455.29" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s easy for you so hard for that</text>
  <text start="1457.87" dur="3.69">like that&amp;#39;s what I was saying before</text>
  <text start="1459.4" dur="3.81">that your whole drawings it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1461.56" dur="3.45">looking at every you have to look at</text>
  <text start="1463.21" dur="4.86">every inch of the drawing because</text>
  <text start="1465.01" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s a story being told there and you</text>
  <text start="1468.07" dur="6.06">know you put words and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="1469.81" dur="7.83">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very intricate and you</text>
  <text start="1474.13" dur="4.95">get a special talent man you mentioned</text>
  <text start="1477.64" dur="4.32">the words and this is what I get the</text>
  <text start="1479.08" dur="6.33">most flak for is you put so many labels</text>
  <text start="1481.96" dur="5.37">on your cartoons well it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1485.41" dur="3.44">that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s an old American</text>
  <text start="1487.33" dur="4.25">tradition and that</text>
  <text start="1488.85" dur="5.64">I want to you know I want it my heroes</text>
  <text start="1491.58" dur="5.67">to go way way way way back to the Golden</text>
  <text start="1494.49" dur="5.46">Age of newspapers when there were like</text>
  <text start="1497.25" dur="3.899">two or three thousand paid cartoonists</text>
  <text start="1499.95" dur="3.359">because this that was the Internet of</text>
  <text start="1501.149" dur="4.26">the day but you had so many great</text>
  <text start="1503.309" dur="5.011">editorial cartoonists from that era that</text>
  <text start="1505.409" dur="5.37">and their cartoons were peppered with</text>
  <text start="1508.32" dur="4.38">labels and and you know what a hundred</text>
  <text start="1510.779" dur="3.331">years later later you can understand</text>
  <text start="1512.7" dur="3.569">what&amp;#39;s going on because they&amp;#39;re labeled</text>
  <text start="1514.11" dur="3.84">you don&amp;#39;t have to question well who is</text>
  <text start="1516.269" dur="3.931">this and what&amp;#39;s going on because they do</text>
  <text start="1517.95" dur="5.13">so that&amp;#39;s what I do again but that</text>
  <text start="1520.2" dur="5.04">really annoys a lot of people but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1523.08" dur="5.04">good too but see that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="1525.24" dur="5.37">to do here because a cartoon is not an</text>
  <text start="1528.12" dur="4.86">illustration a lot of people think that</text>
  <text start="1530.61" dur="5.039">the best cartoons have no labels at all</text>
  <text start="1532.98" dur="5.13">and a lot of people in Europe subscribe</text>
  <text start="1535.649" dur="4.051">to this belief because a lot of European</text>
  <text start="1538.11" dur="3.6">cartoonists they don&amp;#39;t want to put any</text>
  <text start="1539.7" dur="3.599">labels whatsoever on their things but I</text>
  <text start="1541.71" dur="3.75">always think well that&amp;#39;s an illustration</text>
  <text start="1543.299" dur="4.801">then that&amp;#39;s not really that&amp;#39;s not a real</text>
  <text start="1545.46" dur="6.51">editorial cartoon real editorial cartoon</text>
  <text start="1548.1" dur="6.6">combines words and images you combine</text>
  <text start="1551.97" dur="4.74">the symbolic with the semantic and what</text>
  <text start="1554.7" dur="4.349">that does is get both hemispheres of the</text>
  <text start="1556.71" dur="5.79">brain engaged and that helps you</text>
  <text start="1559.049" dur="5.161">remember things so what I do is try to</text>
  <text start="1562.5" dur="3.99">take and I take a lot of tired old</text>
  <text start="1564.21" dur="4.38">cliches and metaphors at all editorial</text>
  <text start="1566.49" dur="3.87">cartoonists do but I try to combine them</text>
  <text start="1568.59" dur="4.16">and put a put a twist to it and make it</text>
  <text start="1570.36" dur="6.929">new again in different different</text>
  <text start="1572.75" dur="8.379">permutations and so but the dimension is</text>
  <text start="1577.289" dur="7.85">all my fundamental intent is to use</text>
  <text start="1581.129" dur="6.811">satire which includes humor but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1585.139" dur="4.66">necessarily all predicated on humor</text>
  <text start="1587.94" dur="4.319">alone there&amp;#39;s a lot of things involved</text>
  <text start="1589.799" dur="4.23">with satire rather than just just you</text>
  <text start="1592.259" dur="4.38">know I consider humor to be a byproduct</text>
  <text start="1594.029" dur="4.471">of the satire and in fact not funny</text>
  <text start="1596.639" dur="3.691">people see me and they might think in</text>
  <text start="1598.5" dur="4.649">person I should be this funny guy you</text>
  <text start="1600.33" dur="4.65">know and I&amp;#39;m actually I&amp;#39;m actually not</text>
  <text start="1603.149" dur="4.5">very funny at all I&amp;#39;m really serious</text>

  <text start="1755.09" dur="2.91">high school I did the same thing I would</text>
  <text start="1756.59" dur="6.03">draw my teachers and I remember one time</text>
  <text start="1758" dur="6.99">I drew my math teacher and some some</text>

  <text start="1769.34" dur="7.95">of a big fearsome man right it was a man</text>
  <text start="1774.35" dur="4.41">that said I&amp;#39;m dead you know instead he</text>
  <text start="1777.29" dur="3.6">turned to random he put it up on his</text>
  <text start="1778.76" dur="4.14">building board he loved it so but that</text>
  <text start="1780.89" dur="4.26">was it that&amp;#39;s the kind of stuff that I</text>
  <text start="1782.9" dur="4.649">did when I when I started out but when I</text>
  <text start="1785.15" dur="4.14">got to college I kind of gave up the</text>
  <text start="1787.549" dur="3.721">cartooning because I wanted to become a</text>
  <text start="1789.29" dur="3.54">I want to become a painter and I wanted</text>
  <text start="1791.27" dur="4.89">to be a fine artist and that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1792.83" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s what I intended on doing only to</text>
  <text start="1796.16" dur="3.149">discover that you know it&amp;#39;s nearly</text>
  <text start="1797.54" dur="3.84">impossible to make a living as a fine</text>
  <text start="1799.309" dur="4.021">artist so then I became I became a</text>
  <text start="1801.38" dur="6.929">newspaper artist and I did that for like</text>
  <text start="1803.33" dur="6.75">20 years and then in 97 I started my own</text>
  <text start="1808.309" dur="4.141">business where I did business and</text>
  <text start="1810.08" dur="3.93">corporate graphics like information</text>
  <text start="1812.45" dur="3.479">graphics and things like that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1814.01" dur="4.35">what I did it for you know until I</text>
  <text start="1815.929" dur="4.471">started messing with these cartoons I</text>
  <text start="1818.36" dur="5.58">kind of rediscovered cartooning again</text>
  <text start="1820.4" dur="5.67">and then you know and that proved my</text>
  <text start="1823.94" dur="4.71">demise in a way because it that killed</text>
  <text start="1826.07" dur="4.229">my commercial art career but now hey I&amp;#39;m</text>
