  <text start="306.97" dur="4.53">for me it marked the end of a story I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="4.8">wanted to write for two years in</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="7.2">November of 2017 I was working for CBS</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="5.639">as the security editor at ZDNet a hacker</text>
  <text start="318.7" dur="3.66">group reached out to me over an</text>
  <text start="320.349" dur="4.111">encrypted chat claiming to have broken</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="4.77">into a dart web site running a massive</text>
  <text start="324.46" dur="5.61">child sexual exploitation operation I</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="4.95">was stunned I had previous interactions</text>
  <text start="330.07" dur="4.349">with the hacker hacker group but nothing</text>
  <text start="332.08" dur="4.649">like this the group claimed it broke</text>
  <text start="334.419" dur="5.491">into the dart web site which it said was</text>
  <text start="336.729" dur="6.541">titled welcome to video and identified</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="5.819">four real-world IP addresses of the site</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="5.04">said to be different servers running the</text>
  <text start="345.729" dur="4.5">supposedly massive child abuse site they</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="3.9">also provided me with a text file</text>
  <text start="350.229" dur="4.411">containing a sample of thousands of IP</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="4.59">addresses of individuals who they said</text>
  <text start="354.64" dur="4.369">had logged into the site the hackers</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="4.31">boasted about how they siphon</text>
  <text start="359.009" dur="4.891">off the list as the users logged in</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="5.04">without the users knowledge and had more</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="4.889">than a hundred thousand more but they</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="4.049">would not share them if proven true the</text>
  <text start="368.789" dur="3.481">hackers would have made a major</text>
  <text start="370.199" dur="4.59">breakthrough in not only discovering a</text>
  <text start="372.27" dur="4.59">major dart web child-abuse site but</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="4.71">could potentially identify the owners</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.679">and the visitors to the site but at the</text>
  <text start="379.499" dur="3.991">time we could not prove it my then</text>
  <text start="381.539" dur="4.291">editor-in-chief and I discussed how we</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="4.679">could approach the story a primary</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="4.35">concern was that the dart website was</text>
  <text start="388.169" dur="3.84">already under federal investigation and</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="4.019">writing about it could jeopardize that</text>
  <text start="392.009" dur="4.47">effort but we also faced another</text>
  <text start="394.199" dur="4.95">headache there was no legal way we could</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="4.62">access the site to verify it if the</text>
  <text start="399.149" dur="4.35">hackers had claimed what they had done</text>
  <text start="401.099" dur="4.56">the hackers gave me a user name and</text>
  <text start="403.499" dur="3.931">password for the site which they said</text>
  <text start="405.659" dur="4.47">they had just created for me to verify</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="4.709">their claims but we could not access the</text>
  <text start="410.129" dur="4.08">site for any reason even for</text>
  <text start="412.139" dur="4.26">journalistic reasons and in a controlled</text>
  <text start="414.209" dur="5.07">environment for fear that the site may</text>
  <text start="416.399" dur="4.56">display child abuse imagery only federal</text>
  <text start="419.279" dur="3.45">agents working an investigation are</text>
  <text start="420.959" dur="4.29">allowed to access sites that contain</text>
  <text start="422.729" dur="4.83">illegal content while journalists have a</text>
  <text start="425.249" dur="4.38">lot of flexibility and freedoms this was</text>
  <text start="427.559" dur="4.38">not one of them after a call with</text>
  <text start="429.629" dur="4.231">several CBS lawyers we decided that</text>
  <text start="431.939" dur="3.45">there was no legal way to write the</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="3.72">story without verifying the site&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.389" dur="4.8">contents something we legally weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.58" dur="4.649">able to do the story was dead but the</text>
  <text start="440.189" dur="4.26">site was not one thing the lawyers</text>
  <text start="442.229" dur="4.23">couldn&amp;#39;t tell me as if I should report</text>
  <text start="444.449" dur="4.26">the findings to the government that was</text>
  <text start="446.459" dur="4.44">ultimately my decision to make it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="448.709" dur="3.781">bizarre situation to be in as a</text>
  <text start="450.899" dur="4.651">cybersecurity and national security</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="5.399">reporter the government is all too often</text>
  <text start="455.55" dur="3.899">the Nemesis often a target of</text>
  <text start="457.889" dur="4.05">journalistic inquisitions</text>
  <text start="459.449" dur="5.131">and investigations but while journalists</text>
  <text start="461.939" dur="4.65">are total are told to report and observe</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="4.829">and not get involved there are</text>
  <text start="466.589" dur="4.771">exceptions risk to life and child</text>
  <text start="469.409" dur="4.32">exploitation on top of the list</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="4.139">a journalist cannot idly stand by</text>
  <text start="473.729" dur="3.81">knowing there could be a car bomb</text>
  <text start="475.499" dur="4.71">sitting outside of a building ready to</text>
  <text start="477.539" dur="4.44">detonate nor can one dismiss the idea of</text>
  <text start="480.209" dur="4.02">a child abuse site continuing to operate</text>
  <text start="481.979" dur="4.02">on the dark web I spoke with the</text>
  <text start="484.229" dur="4.261">well-known journalist to ask for ethical</text>
  <text start="485.999" dur="5.19">advice we agreed to speak on background</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="4.5">from the reporter to reporter having</text>
  <text start="491.189" dur="4.651">never faced a situation like the</text>
  <text start="492.99" dur="5.04">my primary concern was to ensure I was</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="5.13">on the right moral ethical and legal</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="5.039">side of things was it right to report</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="5.009">this to the feds the answer was simple</text>
  <text start="503.069" dur="5.011">and expected yes it was right to report</text>
  <text start="505.979" dur="4.62">the information to the authorities so</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="4.019">long as I protected my source protecting</text>
  <text start="510.599" dur="3.93">your sources is one of the cardinal</text>
  <text start="512.099" dur="4.86">rules of journalism but my source was a</text>
  <text start="514.529" dur="4.981">hacker group it was not the dart website</text>
  <text start="516.959" dur="4.231">itself after all I was working under the</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="4.019">assumption that the authorities would</text>
  <text start="521.19" dur="5.13">not care much for the source information</text>
  <text start="523.529" dur="5.551">anyway I reached out to a contact at the</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="5.01">FBI who passed me on to a special agent</text>
  <text start="529.08" dur="4.5">at a field office after a brief phone</text>
  <text start="531.33" dur="4.14">call I emailed the four IP addresses</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="4.41">slated to be the dart web sites real</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="4.83">world location and the list of the</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="5.039">thousand alleged users on the site and</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="5.25">then silence I heard nothing back I</text>
  <text start="543.029" dur="4.441">followed up an ass but the agent warned</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="4.53">that if the site became or was already</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="4.41">subjected to investigation there was</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="4.53">little if anything they could say I</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="4.35">recall the hackers were frustrated after</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="3.87">I told them I wouldn&amp;#39;t be writing the</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="5.76">story we are no longer communicating</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="5.669">weeks went by I felt just as frustrated</text>
  <text start="561.99" dur="4.589">at the lack of insight into what I had</text>
  <text start="564.149" dur="4.741">only guessed her hope was progress by</text>
  <text start="566.579" dur="4.111">the federal agents I recall running the</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="3.63">list of IP addresses that the hackers</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="4.08">gave me through a resolver which</text>
  <text start="572.52" dur="4.559">provided some limited insight into the</text>
  <text start="574.77" dur="4.17">might into who might be visiting the</text>
  <text start="577.079" dur="4.231">dart web site we found individuals</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="4.95">accessed the dart web site from the</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="5.19">networks of the US Army Intelligence the</text>

  <text start="591.51" dur="5.55">several universities around the world we</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="4.921">could not identify however specific</text>
  <text start="597.06" dur="4.68">individuals who access the site and</text>
  <text start="599.07" dur="5.519">because the dart web site is analyzed</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s likely that not even companies knew</text>
  <text start="604.589" dur="4.111">their staff were accessing the site how</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="3.689">could they possibly let this go I</text>
  <text start="608.7" dur="4.259">thought to myself wondering whether the</text>
  <text start="610.829" dur="3.871">FBI agent had acted on the information I</text>
  <text start="612.959" dur="3.901">had handed over if there was an</text>
  <text start="614.7" dur="4.11">investigation it would take time and</text>
  <text start="616.86" dur="4.11">effort and the wheels of the government</text>
  <text start="618.81" dur="4.68">cell to move quickly would I ever know</text>
  <text start="620.97" dur="5.3">whether the perpetrators would ever be</text>
  <text start="623.49" dur="5.33">caught today two years later</text>
  <text start="626.27" dur="5.22">my answer US prosecutors said in the</text>

  <text start="649.13" dur="3.96">after the news of the site&amp;#39;s removal had</text>
  <text start="651.32" dur="3.21">been reported I rifled through the</text>

  <text start="654.53" dur="3.87">Department&amp;#39;s website it found a</text>

  <text start="660.68" dur="3.87">match for the first time since the</text>
  <text start="662.69" dur="4.77">hackers told me of the dark web site I</text>

  <text start="672.77" dur="3.84">according to the indictment federal</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="4.74">agents began investigating the site in</text>
  <text start="676.61" dur="4.83">September of 2017 two months before the</text>
  <text start="679.49" dur="4.98">hackers breached the site the site&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="681.44" dur="4.92">administrator Wang Woo&amp;#39;s son had been</text>
  <text start="684.47" dur="3.9">running the operation from the residents</text>
  <text start="686.36" dur="4.32">in South Korea since 2015</text>
  <text start="688.37" dur="4.38">the indictment said the main landing</text>
  <text start="690.68" dur="4.26">page to the site contain a security flaw</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="4.41">that let investigators discover some of</text>
  <text start="694.94" dur="4.65">the IP addresses of the dark web site</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="4.29">simply by right-clicking the page and</text>
  <text start="699.59" dur="4.11">viewing the source of the website it was</text>
  <text start="701.45" dur="4.23">a major error one that would trigger a</text>
  <text start="703.7" dur="5.16">chain of events that would ensnare the</text>
  <text start="705.68" dur="4.5">entire site and its users prosecutors</text>
  <text start="708.86" dur="3.54">said in the indictment that they found</text>
  <text start="710.18" dur="4.77">several IP addresses as you can see here</text>
  <text start="712.4" dur="5.31">one of the IP addresses the hackers gave</text>
  <text start="714.95" dur="5.1">me was a match and address on the same</text>
  <text start="717.71" dur="4.53">network subnet as the dart web site it</text>
  <text start="720.05" dur="4.2">was long awaited confirmation that the</text>
  <text start="722.24" dur="4.08">hackers were telling the truth they did</text>
  <text start="724.25" dur="3.78">in fact breach the site but whether or</text>
  <text start="726.32" dur="4.5">not the government knew about the breach</text>
  <text start="728.03" dur="6">remains a mystery some five months after</text>
  <text start="730.82" dur="4.92">I contacted the FBI the government</text>
  <text start="734.03" dur="3.57">obtained a warrant to seize and</text>

  <text start="822.47" dur="4.92">government&amp;#39;s investigation potentially</text>
  <text start="824.69" dur="5.28">sinking in entirely it was a frustrating</text>
  <text start="827.39" dur="4.26">time not least being in the dark and not</text>
