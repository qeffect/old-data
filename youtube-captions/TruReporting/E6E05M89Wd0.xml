  <text start="199.959" dur="5.371">support the persecution of Julian</text>
  <text start="202.299" dur="5.041">Assange former British ambassador Craig</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="4.02">Murray has published a very disturbing</text>
  <text start="207.34" dur="4.05">account of Julian Assange his court</text>
  <text start="209.35" dur="3.93">appearance yesterday which I recommend</text>
  <text start="211.39" dur="3.69">reading in full there have been many</text>
  <text start="213.28" dur="3.69">reports published about Assange his case</text>
  <text start="215.08" dur="3.81">management hearing but the combination</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="4.47">of Murray&amp;#39;s prior experience with</text>
  <text start="218.89" dur="4.26">torture victims his familiarity with</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="4.68">British courts his friendship with</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="5.07">Assange and his lack of reverence for</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="4.53">Western power structures allowed for a</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="4.44">much more penetrating insight into what</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="5.07">happened than anyone else has been able</text>
  <text start="232.66" dur="5.549">to provide so far here&amp;#39;s a small excerpt</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="4.71">before I get on to the blatant lack of</text>
  <text start="238.209" dur="4.261">fair process the first thing I must note</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="4.02">was Julian&amp;#39;s condition I was badly</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="4.29">shocked by just how much weight my</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="4.289">friend has lost by the speed his hair</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="4.71">has receded and by the appearance of</text>
  <text start="248.739" dur="5.851">premature and vastly accelerated aging</text>
  <text start="251.47" dur="5.4">he is pronounced limp I have never seen</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="4.829">this before since his arrest he has lost</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="4.23">over 15 kilograms in weight but his</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="4.411">physical appearance was not as shocking</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="4.68">as his mental deterioration when asked</text>
  <text start="263.83" dur="4.44">to give his name and date of birth he</text>
  <text start="265.78" dur="4.68">struggled visibly over several seconds</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="4.62">to recall both I will come to the</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="4.05">important content of his statement at</text>
  <text start="272.89" dur="4.8">the end of the proceedings in due course</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="5.43">but his difficulty in making it was very</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="4.32">evident it was a real struggle for him</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="4.38">to articulate the words and focus his</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="4.86">train of thought until yesterday I had</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="4.14">always been quietly sceptical of those</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="4.5">who claim that Julian&amp;#39;s treatment</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="6.73">amounted to torture even of Nils Melser</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="6.34">the UN Special Rapporteur on torture</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="4.74">sceptical of those who suggested he may</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="4.23">be subjected to debilitating drug</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="3.9">treatments but having attended the</text>
  <text start="301.94" dur="4.02">trials in Yucca Stan</text>
  <text start="303.83" dur="4.02">they have several victims of extreme</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="5.55">torture and having worked with survivors</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="5.22">from cear√° loan and elsewhere I can tell</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="4.32">you that yesterday changed my mind</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="5.1">entirely and Julian exhibited exactly</text>
  <text start="315.83" dur="4.98">the symptoms of a torture victim brought</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="5.79">blinking into the light particularly in</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="5.34">terms of disorientation confusion and</text>
  <text start="323.96" dur="5.18">the real struggle to assert free will</text>
  <text start="326.15" dur="6.18">through the fog of learned helplessness</text>
  <text start="329.14" dur="5.29">Murray reports that there were no fewer</text>
  <text start="332.33" dur="3.21">than five representatives of the US</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="3.66">government in the Westminster</text>
  <text start="335.54" dur="3.93">magistrates court that day and that they</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="3.6">were seated behind the British</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="4.83">prosecutors and essentially giving them</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="5.25">orders the judge Vanessa barrister</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="5.4">reportedly behaved coldly and snarkily</text>
  <text start="346.94" dur="4.77">toward the defense smirking and refusing</text>
  <text start="349.7" dur="4.11">their request without explanation</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="4.56">while behaving warmly and receptively</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="3.9">toward the prosecution Assange his</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="3.96">extradition hearing will commence</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="5.79">without delay on February of next year</text>
  <text start="360.23" dur="6.21">despite the case violating the 2003 US</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="5.88">UK extradition treaty and despite new</text>

  <text start="369.38" dur="5.31">on Assange and his lawyers while he was</text>
  <text start="372.26" dur="4.32">at the Ecuadorian Embassy it will</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="4.53">commence in a tiny Belmarsh court</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="5.01">warrant courtroom with almost no room</text>
  <text start="379.22" dur="4.44">for public to provide scrutiny without</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="2.64">Assange defence having adequate time to</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="2.88">prepare</text>
  <text start="384.23" dur="4.32">Assange his lawyer Marc summers told the</text>
  <text start="386.54" dur="4.17">court that the case was in quote a</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="5.19">political attempt by the United States</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="4.62">and quote to signal to journalists the</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="4.71">consequence of publishing information</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="5.97">and of course he&amp;#39;s right nobody</text>
  <text start="398.45" dur="5.33">sincerely believes at 175 years sentence</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="4.86">that Assange is looking at if he is</text>
  <text start="403.78" dur="4.54">successfully extradited to the US by</text>
  <text start="406.16" dur="4.13">Trump administration is reasonable</text>
  <text start="408.32" dur="4.44">punishment for publishing activities</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="4.81">which the Obama administration had</text>
  <text start="412.76" dur="4.47">previously declined to prosecute based</text>
  <text start="415.1" dur="4.38">on the exact same evidence citing</text>
  <text start="417.23" dur="5.52">concern for the damage the president</text>
  <text start="419.48" dur="5.309">would do to press freedoms these charges</text>

  <text start="424.789" dur="4.051">aren&amp;#39;t meant to be merely punitive</text>
  <text start="426.229" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re made to serve as a deterrent</text>
  <text start="428.84" dur="4.98">a deterrent to journalists anywhere in</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="5.07">the world who might otherwise see fit it</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="5.34">published inconvenient facts about the</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="4.32">US government this is obvious it is</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="3.63">obvious that the u.s. government is</text>
  <text start="440.72" dur="4.11">destroying Assange to signal to</text>
  <text start="442.79" dur="4.47">journalists the consequences of</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="4.83">publishing information it is therefore</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="4.62">also obvious that any journalist who</text>
  <text start="449.66" dur="3.6">fails to use whatever platform they had</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="3.78">to speak out against Assange ins</text>
