  <text start="242.18" dur="5.01">people don&amp;#39;t know since people are new</text>
  <text start="243.71" dur="5.87">to me that in about a year ago I made a</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="6.51">periscope outing a major Hollywood</text>
  <text start="249.58" dur="9.64">producer and you people can go find that</text>
  <text start="253.7" dur="7.56">periscope it&amp;#39;s gone very far and I told</text>
  <text start="259.22" dur="4.2">my story because I saw people really</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="4.92">confused about Hollywood and about what</text>
  <text start="263.42" dur="7.65">it actually was and what we had started</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="6.84">to see and I would say 2015 2016 as all</text>
  <text start="271.07" dur="4.37">of these celebrities and everyone in</text>
  <text start="273.02" dur="4.92">Hollywood was just in lockstep with</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="4.69">these political and social agendas that</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.91">were now being really overtly pushed on</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="5.34">us who to vote for blah blah I knew what</text>
  <text start="283.85" dur="4.47">this all was and I knew that people</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="7.08">didn&amp;#39;t really know the full extent of it</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="6.17">and became very I would say activated by</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="6.63">God is what I believe happened</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="7.87">absolutely because what I did was walk</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="5.43">away from some opportunities that people</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="6.21">fight for for a really long time and</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="5.82">most people never get the level that I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="3.93">infiltrated into Hollywood was at the</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="3.48">very very top and I do want to address</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="4.02">this because people ask me like why do</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="5.67">you have an IMDB well my career was such</text>
  <text start="316.52" dur="5.76">that I had a couple of major pilots TV</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="4.35">pilots that I had written and I got shot</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="3.84">right up into the top with the talk</text>
  <text start="323.93" dur="5.82">people so I&amp;#39;m going Network meetings at</text>

  <text start="332.06" dur="7.32">etholon of the top top people and it was</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="6.69">this time period for about four years</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="4.26">where I was they were trying to they</text>
  <text start="342.29" dur="2.88">were basically trying to compromise me I</text>
  <text start="343.64" dur="3.81">kept coming back with project after</text>
  <text start="345.17" dur="4.23">project I had Monica Potter attached to</text>
  <text start="347.45" dur="4.26">star and produced in one show called</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="4.8">dignity and every time and so I had five</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="4.83">projects like that that were mega I have</text>
  <text start="354.2" dur="4.92">one right now so so we&amp;#39;re on the channel</text>
  <text start="356.54" dur="6.06">right now we have somebody who was on</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="6.39">upper tier of Hollywood you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="4.65">talking about you know shows of that are</text>
  <text start="365.51" dur="5.31">making you know primetime television</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="6.9">that you were going to write I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="370.82" dur="5.37">with the people who put all the shows</text>
  <text start="374.15" dur="5.4">you watch on air I&amp;#39;m in those rooms</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="7.55">right people the top people the top</text>
  <text start="379.55" dur="7.38">networks at ABC NBC Disney so Sony</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="7.09">everywhere and I had the top agent top</text>
  <text start="386.93" dur="6.33">manager and you go alright and I sit and</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="4.35">I start I just I thought that what you</text>
  <text start="393.26" dur="4.79">thought I thought here&amp;#39;s how it works</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="6.11">I write a great show everybody loves it</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="4.78">all these people freak out and then</text>
  <text start="401.29" dur="3.46">every time</text>
  <text start="402.83" dur="4.95">weird stuff would start happening and</text>
  <text start="404.75" dur="5.37">I&amp;#39;d never did play this game that I</text>
  <text start="407.78" dur="4.83">didn&amp;#39;t realize was going on so I was</text>
  <text start="410.12" dur="4.26">asked to do all this stuff that was</text>
  <text start="412.61" dur="4.38">against what I would do morally as a</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="4.47">person and then every every each project</text>
  <text start="416.99" dur="3.6">would just kind of start to fizzle away</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="2.37">oh so and so it&amp;#39;s got to work on another</text>
  <text start="420.59" dur="2.16">project</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="3.66">this one&amp;#39;s stopped because you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="4.59">commit to their basically their criminal</text>
  <text start="424.88" dur="4.17">intent right right well that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="427.34" dur="4.56">eventually figured out what I eventually</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="4.46">figured out after Harvey Weinstein and</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="3.96">all of that stuff start to come out was</text>
  <text start="433.51" dur="4.84">everybody at the top is compromised and</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="4.47">everybody who&amp;#39;s so in Hollywood there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.35" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s a line and you&amp;#39;re either above</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="3.45">the line or you&amp;#39;re below the line and</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="5.28">this is a serious thing in Hollywood so</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="6.27">if you&amp;#39;re above the line you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="5.88">producer actor big net you know big-name</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="4.17">actor writer or director those people</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="2.94">are considered above the line and this</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="4.2">is on the budget this is everything and</text>
  <text start="455.93" dur="3.99">then everybody else is below the line so</text>
  <text start="458.42" dur="3.69">the below the line people in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="459.92" dur="4.23">are very much like the working class</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="4.68">people they&amp;#39;re the working class people</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="4.5">of Hollywood they are not telling you</text>
  <text start="466.79" dur="4.17">who to vote for even if they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="3.12">greatest stuntman there is you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="3.33">even know who he is</text>
  <text start="471.77" dur="3.9">you don&amp;#39;t even know his name right might</text>
  <text start="474.29" dur="3.3">be the best gig in Hollywood right</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="4.23">because you&amp;#39;re not compromised you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="3.69">making probably good cash and now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="3.87">doing something you love so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="4.98">probably good gig except for the fact</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="3.6">that these people are all jumping ship</text>
  <text start="486.26" dur="4.08">and there&amp;#39;s like a mutiny on the bounty</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="4.62">because they&amp;#39;re tired of agendas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="3.21">tired of using their gifts and talents a</text>
  <text start="491.99" dur="3.18">lot of global and people are</text>
  <text start="493.55" dur="3.27">conservatives that would that&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="6.09">thing that shocks people well we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="6.21">heard that with gaffer Anton right Debra</text>
  <text start="501.26" dur="3.12">yes he&amp;#39;s you know he&amp;#39;s brought out</text>
  <text start="503.03" dur="2.88">saying that hey you</text>
  <text start="504.38" dur="3.24">people who are doing the lights and</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="4.62">painting the sets and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="507.62" dur="5.28">like they are these are working-class</text>
  <text start="510.53" dur="6.449">hard-working people most of them don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="512.9" dur="5.579">even they are somewhat aware probably</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="4.171">through research not by actually</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="4.44">visually seeing it in person you know</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="2.94">the corruption of it but you know</text>
  <text start="522.919" dur="2.491">they&amp;#39;re just hard working people</text>
  <text start="524.09" dur="3.81">blue-collar people who want to make a</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="4.23">good living and you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.9" dur="3.9">probably done with this right because</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="6.12">this is coming out left and right with</text>
  <text start="531.8" dur="6">with sex allegations and weinstein and</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="5.37">all of this that&amp;#39;s coming out you know</text>
  <text start="537.8" dur="5.49">day by day is got to be detrimental to</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="4.59">their livelihood eventually so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.29" dur="3.9">why what they&amp;#39;re bailing right I think a</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="3.87">lot of them are starting to see what</text>
  <text start="547.19" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve been a part of mm-hmm when you</text>
  <text start="549.59" dur="6.08">give your gifts and talents to something</text>
  <text start="551.48" dur="7.32">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re using what God gave you in</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="6.07">service of you know basically you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.8" dur="5.07">feeding the eye where we could all just</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="4.5">be building something different instead</text>
  <text start="563.87" dur="4.17">and so that&amp;#39;s kind of what&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="4.56">organic thing that&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="6.39">everybody is waking up even people in</text>
  <text start="570.8" dur="7.2">Hollywood so people like me who above</text>
  <text start="574.43" dur="7.74">the line if if if all my shows were to</text>
  <text start="578" dur="6">have gone I would be you know Shonda</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="3.21">Rhimes David E Kelly right now I would</text>
  <text start="584" dur="3.36">be able to tell you guys who to vote for</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="5.25">I would you know I&amp;#39;d be able to go out</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="5.19">and send a tweet and tell millions of</text>
  <text start="590.63" dur="4.11">Americans just like Reese Witherspoon</text>
  <text start="592.55" dur="3.9">and all these people they go you know</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re telling you who to vote for it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="4.11">because these people are owned and</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re compromised and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="600.56" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s the difference between above the</text>
  <text start="602.15" dur="3.96">line and below the line so that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="603.95" dur="4.98">experienced and people you know need to</text>
  <text start="606.11" dur="5.81">understand that for for me at the level</text>
  <text start="608.93" dur="6.57">that I&amp;#39;ve functioned at in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="6.88">selling my soul was required right so</text>

  <text start="807.02" dur="5.85">of traction so before I came out</text>
  <text start="809.86" dur="4.47">publicly publicly I was already speaking</text>
  <text start="812.87" dur="3.57">I was already going around to</text>
  <text start="814.33" dur="4.18">universities and talking about the deep</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="5.28">state infiltration of Hollywood what on</text>
  <text start="818.51" dur="5.66">the university grounds yes and they love</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="4.95">this information because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="824.17" dur="4.06">the stuff that people don&amp;#39;t know and</text>
  <text start="826.67" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s not I don&amp;#39;t sit there and say deep</text>
  <text start="828.23" dur="4.65">state but basically the CIA the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="830.99" dur="3.42">the Department of Defense and how</text>
  <text start="832.88" dur="2.579">they&amp;#39;ve had their hand over Hollywood</text>
  <text start="834.41" dur="3.63">since the beginning and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="835.459" dur="5.911">provable it&amp;#39;s all based on Declassified</text>
  <text start="838.04" dur="5.01">and FOIA documents we had I have the</text>
  <text start="841.37" dur="4.92">script changes that the Pentagon did on</text>
  <text start="843.05" dur="6.09">Hulk I have I have documents that will</text>
  <text start="846.29" dur="4.68">blow your mind I have the fact that the</text>
  <text start="849.14" dur="3.6">government was involved in every Marvel</text>
  <text start="850.97" dur="3.989">movie do you know that I mean people</text>
  <text start="852.74" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t know that so I would go run it</text>
  <text start="854.959" dur="4.351">I&amp;#39;ve looked into it I&amp;#39;ve looked at your</text>
  <text start="856.76" dur="4.17">work you know I&amp;#39;ve seen some of your</text>
  <text start="859.31" dur="4.02">stuff and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s mind-blowing some of</text>
  <text start="860.93" dur="5.43">the stuff I knew just from my own</text>
  <text start="863.33" dur="4.82">research it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="866.36" dur="4.89">believe they allowed you onto a</text>
  <text start="868.15" dur="5.11">University ground of how left-wing these</text>
  <text start="871.25" dur="4.709">psychopaths are you know these Dean&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="873.26" dur="4.14">and you know the people that run these</text>
  <text start="875.959" dur="3.361">places I can&amp;#39;t believe they were</text>
  <text start="877.4" dur="3.78">allowing you to say these things like</text>
  <text start="879.32" dur="5.759">blasphemy some of the places where I</text>
  <text start="881.18" dur="6.36">spoke were in in peace building type</text>
  <text start="885.079" dur="4.471">initiatives right so one of the things</text>
  <text start="887.54" dur="4.23">that all of this has done is created a</text>
  <text start="889.55" dur="4.529">mind control over Americans to where we</text>
  <text start="891.77" dur="3.27">continually consent to war and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="894.079" dur="3.241">know the difference between being</text>
  <text start="895.04" dur="4.47">patriotic and being propagandized and</text>
  <text start="897.32" dur="3.959">that is sort of the basis of where I was</text>
  <text start="899.51" dur="4.019">coming from for their purposes for</text>
  <text start="901.279" dur="4.92">educational purposes to</text>
  <text start="903.529" dur="4.23">explain to people what&amp;#39;s been done how</text>
  <text start="906.199" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s been done and the results around</text>
  <text start="907.759" dur="6.33">the world and that Hollywood has really</text>
  <text start="911.389" dur="5.221">enabled the American psyche to consent</text>
  <text start="914.089" dur="5.25">to being a standing army of this global</text>
  <text start="916.61" dur="5.61">economic order we don&amp;#39;t even realize it</text>
  <text start="919.339" dur="5.281">these wars that were fighting Hollywood</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="3.839">is helping manufacture the fact that we</text>
  <text start="924.62" dur="3.149">think we always have to go do everything</text>
  <text start="926.059" dur="4.2">and everything we do is justified and</text>
  <text start="927.769" dur="4.341">everything we do is for the greater good</text>
  <text start="930.259" dur="4.95">and everything we do is worth doing</text>
  <text start="932.11" dur="4.75">meanwhile you know what are we really</text>
  <text start="935.209" dur="3.93">doing what are these wars of conquest</text>
  <text start="936.86" dur="3.839">and who are we fighting them on behalf</text>
  <text start="939.139" dur="4.081">of I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m fighting on behalf</text>
  <text start="940.699" dur="6.57">of you and me and our neighbors know</text>
  <text start="943.22" dur="6.659">Syria and wherever and so what what</text>
  <text start="947.269" dur="7.471">Hollywood&amp;#39;s role in that is is massive</text>
  <text start="949.879" dur="6.96">its massive and so to me that&amp;#39;s before I</text>
  <text start="954.74" dur="3.42">even came out and told my me two story</text>
  <text start="956.839" dur="3.18">and all this started and before I</text>
  <text start="958.16" dur="4.109">started writing my blogs I was doing</text>
  <text start="960.019" dur="5.01">that you had a legitimate me to movement</text>
  <text start="962.269" dur="5.911">because I&amp;#39;m not bashing me - it has a</text>
  <text start="965.029" dur="4.92">lot of people who cry rape rape and then</text>
  <text start="968.18" dur="4.259">they throw some dude under the bus I</text>
  <text start="969.949" dur="4.5">mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where they took this</text>
  <text start="972.439" dur="3.661">in the wrong direction what happened to</text>
  <text start="974.449" dur="3.151">you and the fact that you&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="976.1" dur="3.12">you&amp;#39;re stepping away from all this</text>
  <text start="977.6" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;re trying to build your own</text>
  <text start="979.22" dur="5.13">Hollywood a non corrupt Hollywood</text>
  <text start="981.74" dur="4.86">because that&amp;#39;s all they are is amazing</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="3.599">and I&amp;#39;m uh you know I applaud you for</text>

  <text start="1210.56" dur="4.17">that will never go away and so then so a</text>
  <text start="1212.93" dur="3.06">movie will have 9,000 producers so what</text>
  <text start="1214.73" dur="3.51">so what</text>
  <text start="1215.99" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;ll look you know who cares some</text>
  <text start="1218.24" dur="4.23">movies are crowd funded out there I know</text>
  <text start="1220.1" dur="3.93">some producers and directors who hey you</text>
  <text start="1222.47" dur="3.45">know I don&amp;#39;t have the cash to do this</text>
  <text start="1224.03" dur="3.45">let&amp;#39;s crowd fund this you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1225.92" dur="3.84">saying right and that&amp;#39;s but then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1227.48" dur="4.74">all donation and that&amp;#39;s great and that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1258.14" dur="4.02">of the movie it&amp;#39;s there it&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="1259.67" dur="5.7">within this movement I can tell you that</text>
  <text start="1262.16" dur="6.09">right now and then we distribute it on a</text>
  <text start="1265.37" dur="5.28">streaming platform so it&amp;#39;s all got to be</text>
  <text start="1268.25" dur="4.76">built and it&amp;#39;s gonna be built to</text>

  <text start="1288.68" dur="4.65">fanbase and they&amp;#39;re not gonna be owned</text>
  <text start="1290.9" dur="4.05">and then we&amp;#39;re able to go do what they</text>
  <text start="1293.33" dur="4.65">want it&amp;#39;s like dispersing it out it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1520.52" dur="4.26">asset of something else this person is</text>
  <text start="1522.65" dur="3.93">not at all what she&amp;#39;s purporting to be</text>
  <text start="1524.78" dur="3.39">not what she&amp;#39;s passing herself off today</text>
  <text start="1526.58" dur="3.93">and this exact same thing with George</text>
  <text start="1528.17" dur="4.95">Clooney so he got heat so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1530.51" dur="4.34">Ellen got on my radar so PS don&amp;#39;t get on</text>
  <text start="1533.12" dur="5.67">my radar you know if you&amp;#39;re in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="1534.85" dur="6.91">but gonna get an exposed Sun George</text>
  <text start="1538.79" dur="5.22">Clooney was named in unsealed obscene</text>
  <text start="1541.76" dur="3.87">documents and I just thought it was</text>
  <text start="1544.01" dur="4.05">really interesting that he was getting</text>
  <text start="1545.63" dur="4.41">sexual favors in bathrooms from</text>
  <text start="1548.06" dur="4.71">international child sex traffickers and</text>
  <text start="1550.04" dur="5.13">I wondered where that led to I wondered</text>
  <text start="1552.77" dur="4.8">if there&amp;#39;s a chance he could have known</text>
  <text start="1555.17" dur="3.72">that he could have not known that this</text>
  <text start="1557.57" dur="2.85">was an international child sex</text>
  <text start="1558.89" dur="2.82">trafficker who&amp;#39;s giving him sexual favor</text>
  <text start="1560.42" dur="4.47">and I thought the chances were pretty</text>
  <text start="1561.71" dur="6.12">slim that he could have not known who</text>
  <text start="1564.89" dur="5.88">this woman was and what she did</text>
  <text start="1567.83" dur="3.78">so I thought horse let&amp;#39;s just see who</text>
  <text start="1570.77" dur="2.58">you really are</text>
  <text start="1571.61" dur="4.8">let&amp;#39;s see who and what you really are</text>
  <text start="1573.35" dur="5.1">and I could continue to dig on him and</text>
  <text start="1576.41" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of whistleblowers call me</text>
  <text start="1578.45" dur="4.74">and people call me um I think I&amp;#39;ll leave</text>
  <text start="1581.72" dur="4.92">him alone for now and move on to other</text>
  <text start="1583.19" dur="6.09">well but there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s plenty to go</text>
  <text start="1586.64" dur="3.84">around and here&amp;#39;s the thing is I I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1589.28" dur="3.81">necessarily want to spend all my time</text>
  <text start="1590.48" dur="5.43">digging into these people and outing</text>
  <text start="1593.09" dur="4.8">people individually but it seems to be</text>
  <text start="1595.91" dur="5.04">really effective for helping we want you</text>
  <text start="1597.89" dur="5.61">to yeah people can just start to assume</text>
  <text start="1600.95" dur="4.56">and they can also start to do it</text>
  <text start="1603.5" dur="4.71">themselves you don&amp;#39;t I mean and say you</text>
  <text start="1605.51" dur="4.17">know what and I know that we don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1617.17" dur="4.15">there&amp;#39;s a balancing act right between</text>
  <text start="1619.49" dur="4.17">tearing things down and building things</text>
  <text start="1621.32" dur="3.87">and for everything I tear down I have to</text>
