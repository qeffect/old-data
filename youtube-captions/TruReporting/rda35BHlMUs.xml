  <text start="12.66" dur="4.05">important thing that that bar said today</text>
  <text start="15.18" dur="2.61">that is important for people to</text>
  <text start="16.71" dur="3.33">understand because I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="17.79" dur="5.1">highlighting this - that people are it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="20.04" dur="4.649">getting lost on people it wasn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="22.89" dur="4.65">that they used the Democrat and Hillary</text>
  <text start="24.689" dur="5.07">Clinton dirt gave it to fake news and</text>
  <text start="27.54" dur="4.89">use that as evidence for the FISA what</text>
  <text start="29.759" dur="4.14">cache and myself and trey gowdy John</text>
  <text start="32.43" dur="3.93">Ratcliffe what we said for a long time</text>
  <text start="33.899" dur="4.68">is you need to really know what else is</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="4.589">in there to and what you&amp;#39;re finding out</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="5.73">today is they didn&amp;#39;t wait for the Carter</text>
  <text start="40.949" dur="4.621">Page FISA to spy on the campaign they</text>
  <text start="44.309" dur="3.541">actually were recording their</text>
  <text start="45.57" dur="5.64">conversations with listening devices and</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="4.979">then they decided to only put a piece of</text>
  <text start="51.21" dur="3.059">that to the court they left out the</text>
  <text start="52.829" dur="4.8">exculpatory evidence so you have to</text>
  <text start="54.269" dur="4.171">remember we fought so hard for so long I</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="3.93">had to come on your show</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="5.579">nearly every night because DOJ and the</text>
  <text start="61.559" dur="5.971">dirty cops in the FBI and the dirty cops</text>
  <text start="64.019" dur="5.401">there refused refused to give us what we</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="3.479">called at the time the tech cuts we had</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="4.32">to fight over the tech guts remember we</text>
  <text start="71.009" dur="5.07">had to threaten to impeach officers of</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="4.23">the Trump administration okay in order</text>
  <text start="76.079" dur="3.841">to get these tech cuts well now you find</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="3.57">out why we wanted these tech cuts let me</text>
  <text start="79.92" dur="3.12">talk about in the cave okay let me talk</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="3.929">about in the K because mccabe wrote a</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="4.35">book that came out a few months ago and</text>
  <text start="85.469" dur="4.891">at one point i had to walk into a</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="5.579">meeting where they tried to kick me out</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="4.53">and rod Rosenstein at the time the</text>
  <text start="92.969" dur="3.781">acting Attorney General the Deputy</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="3.75">Attorney General comes up to me and says</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="4.5">hey you&amp;#39;re not gonna be allowed in this</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="3.81">room I said sorry I&amp;#39;m getting a bate I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="3.18">in this room on the chair of the</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="3.959">Intelligence Committee I thought at the</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="3.539">time that it was the Democrats of Nancy</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="3.301">Pelosi that were trying to keep kicking</text>
  <text start="107.969" dur="4.981">me out of the room it was actually</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="5.88">McCabe now look that&amp;#39;s obstruction of a</text>
  <text start="112.95" dur="4.019">congressional investigation so you know</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="2.819">I think mccabe has a lot of other</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="3.031">problems that he needs to worry about</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="4.201">and he probably ought to start with</text>
  <text start="120" dur="3.69">actually reading the IG report</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="3.06">so the men and women at home need to</text>
  <text start="123.69" dur="5.37">know what&amp;#39;s happening a lawyer at the</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="6.33">FBI creates fraudulent evidence alters</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="5.34">an email that is in turn used as the</text>
  <text start="132" dur="5.46">basis for a sworn statement to the court</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="5.19">that the court relies on am i stating</text>
  <text start="137.46" dur="4.8">that accurately that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="4.11">that is what occurred from my time at</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="2.79">the Department of Justice and from my</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="4.83">time in law enforcement</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="6.33">any responsible leader when hearing that</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;re talking about sending in spies</text>
  <text start="151.38" dur="6.45">and sending in a wiretap on any</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="5.55">presidential nominee should say what in</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="4.08">the hell are we do it and by the way the</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="4.32">people up the chain who are saying we</text>
  <text start="161.91" dur="4.17">didn&amp;#39;t know if you had responsible</text>
  <text start="163.77" dur="3.72">leadership there&amp;#39;s no more important</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="3.12">decision than you make I can tell you</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="4.11">when I was at DOJ if someone says let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.2" dur="4.5">tap Hillary Clinton or let&amp;#39;s tap Bill</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="4.14">Clinton or John Kerry the people there</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="3.21">would have said what in the hell are you</text>
  <text start="175.74" dur="3.3">talking about</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="5.52">they never told Trump about the concerns</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="7.5">is it fair to say they came a point to</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="8.97">where surveilling Carter page became</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="6.93">unlawful I will let the Court decide</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="3.839">that the court has this report and will</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="4.5">make that decision let&amp;#39;s put it this way</text>

  <text start="197.97" dur="3.57">surveil somebody and you keep doing it</text>
  <text start="200.22" dur="5.22">is that bad</text>
