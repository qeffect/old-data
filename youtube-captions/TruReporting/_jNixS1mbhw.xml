  <text start="27.39" dur="5.049">hey friends Thomas here in front of me I</text>
  <text start="30.279" dur="6.331">had the latest post from Cyril brain -</text>
  <text start="32.439" dur="7.14">it was posted about two hours ago and he</text>
  <text start="36.61" dur="4.92">states Trump has just validated Q and</text>
  <text start="39.579" dur="6.421">the Great Falls rally and gave us the</text>
  <text start="41.53" dur="8.22">solution to q1 675 let that sink in so</text>
  <text start="46" dur="5.46">again Trump has just validated Q in</text>
  <text start="49.75" dur="4.29">front of thousands of people at the</text>
  <text start="51.46" dur="6.719">Great Falls rally so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and</text>
  <text start="54.04" dur="6.15">show you what he means by that q1 675</text>
  <text start="58.179" dur="4.02">controversial post I gave you in my</text>
  <text start="60.19" dur="4.86">previous post the solution to the riddle</text>
  <text start="62.199" dur="5.791">so if you want to check back on my about</text>
  <text start="65.05" dur="5.69">two podcasts ago I went over that post</text>
  <text start="67.99" dur="5.73">that he put on the Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="70.74" dur="5.019">covers everything I have seen many other</text>
  <text start="73.72" dur="3.539">attempts which I respect because I have</text>
  <text start="75.759" dur="3.841">found some of the ideas to be very</text>
  <text start="77.259" dur="4.411">interesting and clever but I must defend</text>
  <text start="79.6" dur="5.01">the truth I have not seen any other</text>
  <text start="81.67" dur="5.1">solution solution addressing all the</text>
  <text start="84.61" dur="4.5">following issues at the same time in one</text>
  <text start="86.77" dur="5.84">condensed meaningful and backed with</text>
  <text start="89.11" dur="7.89">known open source facts not conjectures</text>

  <text start="107.29" dur="4.35">solution I presented address all these</text>
  <text start="109.299" dur="4.32">issues at once and today for the purpose</text>
  <text start="111.64" dur="4.47">of sharing how the reasoning is higher</text>
  <text start="113.619" dur="5.701">archives I will address the Twitter</text>
  <text start="116.11" dur="5.1">phone component it is a piece of the</text>
  <text start="119.32" dur="6.229">puzzle elegantly joining the others</text>
  <text start="121.21" dur="7.559">because Prince Alois is a major tweeter</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="6.431">shareholder do you see it just the</text>
  <text start="128.769" dur="5.881">information Twitter + Apple could have</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="5.94">been triangulated and led to Prince</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="6.78">Alois and resolved Saudi Arabia in queue</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="7.319">1681 but but it would have been a weaker</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="6.42">link than getting him through the mug</text>
  <text start="145.239" dur="4.791">why because the probability of one being</text>
  <text start="147.85" dur="5.37">a shareholder and Apple and Twitter</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="7.72">including just $1 is higher than a</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="5.04">triple random emphasis on mug q Prince</text>

  <text start="158.26" dur="4.72">and Al Jazeera</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="6.33">using a couple Twitter phone Apple logo</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="5.16">was a hint to activate our intuition but</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="4.47">not to use it in the reasoning because</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="3.179">the mug clue would have then lost its</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="3.93">relevance</text>
  <text start="171.319" dur="8.371">look how Q subtly dismisses the tweet</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="6.54">phone in the reasoning queue 1677 who</text>
  <text start="179.69" dur="4.34">would have thought the Twitter phone</text>
  <text start="181.19" dur="7.049">could be so useful this is pure</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="6.4">delectation for the mind the mug route</text>
  <text start="188.239" dur="4.5">was there for the route queue preferred</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="4.98">otherwise he would have limited the</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="4.441">riddle to triangulation of Apple and</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="4.23">Twitter to get to the prince</text>
  <text start="197.18" dur="5.19">which he did not the reason is the mug</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="4.62">brings the idea of detention makes the</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="4.23">riddle self-sufficient and does not</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="4.41">require us to conjecture that Q wanted</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="4.38">us to include it in our reasoning the</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="5.34">detention component is crucial because</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="5.07">it is if it is removed we don&amp;#39;t get to</text>
  <text start="214.01" dur="6.39">the DC politicians being freed and</text>
  <text start="216.05" dur="6.24">therefore don&amp;#39;t get to queue 1681 today</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="4.74">as patriots we celebrate our</text>
  <text start="222.29" dur="4.65">independence I would like to also give</text>

  <text start="265.94" dur="5.19">okay i am walking you through all these</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="4.59">details so you know the thought process</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="3.57">queue is expected from us and how i</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="4.139">discipline and constrain myself when</text>

  <text start="276.919" dur="5.041">through which you assess the quality of</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="4.14">a solution you first need to verify all</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="4.079">the claims are back with verifiable</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="4.68">information then you need to verify all</text>
  <text start="286.039" dur="4.621">the clues are used in a flawless manner</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="4.26">to render the hidden message absolutely</text>
  <text start="290.66" dur="2.52">I have summarized the solution of the</text>
