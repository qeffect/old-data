  <text start="187.67" dur="4.11">that he has the authority to make good</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="4.83">on his threat to force all American</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="4.439">businesses to leave China citing a</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="3.929">national security law that has been used</text>
  <text start="196.219" dur="5.1">mainly to target terrorists drug</text>
  <text start="198.349" dur="6.301">traffickers and pariah States like Iran</text>
  <text start="201.319" dur="5.431">Syria and North Korea so obviously we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.65" dur="6">reading a deep state article is from the</text>
  <text start="206.75" dur="5.28">New York Times and they are the arm of</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="3.919">the deep State because they&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="4.709">the mainstream media we all know that</text>
  <text start="214.569" dur="4.42">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying here is</text>
  <text start="216.739" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re putting words on President Trump</text>
  <text start="218.989" dur="5.821">saying that he is saying China is on the</text>
  <text start="222.169" dur="4.5">same level that he has to use this</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="4.079">national security law because China&amp;#39;s on</text>

  <text start="228.889" dur="5.82">drug traffickers and pariah states like</text>
  <text start="232.219" dur="4.561">Iran Syria North Korea which is not true</text>
  <text start="234.709" dur="5.34">the only thing that is true about this</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="5.429">is that there is a deep state in within</text>
  <text start="240.049" dur="4.981">China there&amp;#39;s a faction that is still in</text>
  <text start="242.209" dur="5.55">China and that would be the communist</text>
