  <text start="204.299" dur="3.091">know how you want to start off the show</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="5.16">we can go right into Google we could</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="5.67">talk about September 11th it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="4.649">matter what your talking points want to</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="4.679">be as what we&amp;#39;ve been wanting to talk</text>
  <text start="215.459" dur="2.911">about is continuing on with Google so as</text>
  <text start="217.739" dur="3.901">anything</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="5.49">else happened since we last talked we</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="3.39">need my god so much has happened since</text>
  <text start="223.86" dur="6.62">we&amp;#39;ve last talked let me tell you about</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="8.36">it let&amp;#39;s go so it turns out that the</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="6.46">Google search engine has restored</text>
  <text start="233.39" dur="6.58">Clinton body-count Auto suggestion now</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s not that big of a deal because</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="3.93">obviously the election is over but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="4.47">showing that Google is trying to back</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="4.559">off from its censorship regime and</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve essentially blinked at</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="4.681">this point why do they blink well it</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="4.919">could&amp;#39;ve could be due to the fact that</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="6.89">50 states and territories have banded</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="8.101">together to start a class-action</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="6.73">antitrust lawsuit against Google they</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="4.02">are that they&amp;#39;re being joined not in the</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="3.99">class action but they&amp;#39;re being joined in</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="5.309">parallel by the federal government DOJ</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="5.19">that is that is now opening up a</text>
  <text start="273.389" dur="6.9">antitrust investigation against Google</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="7.349">and also the city of New York</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="5.581">so that&amp;#39;s federal government state and</text>
  <text start="283.289" dur="5.791">city now what&amp;#39;s really amazing is that</text>
  <text start="285.87" dur="5.609">there is one notable exception of one</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="5.66">state that is not joining in this class</text>
  <text start="291.479" dur="7.62">action lawsuit and that is the state of</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="7.359">California and the reason why the people</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="5.281">right well we can all figure out why</text>
  <text start="302.099" dur="6.031">Google is located in California</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="6.87">primarily and they have been paying off</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="6.63">a lot of the politicians in there Robert</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="5.699">Epstein who i retweeted called out the</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="5.01">Attorney General I&amp;#39;m saying that he had</text>
  <text start="316.949" dur="5.611">received money from Google and that this</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="4.29">was likely corruption for the reason why</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="5.91">I mean they&amp;#39;re not even having the</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="6.359">semblance of of being judicial right I</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="5.1">mean at least at least join in the class</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="5.341">action they&amp;#39;d like quietly leave later</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="4.08">but they&amp;#39;re not even joining it so you</text>
  <text start="335.76" dur="5.129">know we&amp;#39;ll see what happens as this</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="5.04">develops so you think that like you said</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re bleak they&amp;#39;re blinking at this</text>
  <text start="342.69" dur="5.25">so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re obviously kind of</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="4.02">saying okay we&amp;#39;ll bring this back up the</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="4.05">obviously they&amp;#39;re a little nervous</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="6.9">correct yeah they&amp;#39;re a little nervous</text>
  <text start="351.99" dur="6.09">the DOJ sent them a demand for the</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="6.72">paperwork involved in the previous</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="6.69">antitrust investigation yeah this I when</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="5.429">I saw this I did see this this seemed to</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="4.769">have come about extremely quickly this</text>
  <text start="367.949" dur="4.171">is the turnaround was just extremely</text>
  <text start="369.539" dur="4.38">fast from what we&amp;#39;re usually adjusted to</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="4.109">you know with a lot of other things</text>
  <text start="373.919" dur="4.081">that&amp;#39;s going on with 17 and the movement</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="4.141">and all this sort of thing this was like</text>
  <text start="378" dur="3.93">you know bamm-bamm which I was kind of</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="3.54">extremely impressed with I mean</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="5.76">obviously this has so much to do with</text>
  <text start="383.91" dur="6.99">you man so much yeah that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="4.74">amazing they were forced to do something</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="3.63">if they would have continued to not do</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="5.609">anything then it would have just looked</text>
  <text start="394.53" dur="5.85">even worse now one thing I did notice is</text>
  <text start="398.039" dur="4.681">that although Clinton body count was</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="4.469">auto-completed when you search for</text>
  <text start="402.72" dur="4.949">Clinton body count all that came up were</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="5.85">very recent articles trashing the idea</text>
  <text start="407.669" dur="4.951">of the Clinton body count or in relation</text>
  <text start="410.699" dur="4.821">to the Jeffrey Epstein death murder</text>
  <text start="412.62" dur="5.729">suicide whatever it may be exfiltration</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.2">and you had to go about nine or ten</text>
  <text start="418.349" dur="5.91">pages deep before you got to anything</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="6.24">like wnd.com or any actual reporting on</text>
  <text start="424.259" dur="5.851">the Clinton body count it&amp;#39;s just another</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="6.09">example of how atrociously Google has</text>
  <text start="430.11" dur="6.149">destroyed their own product Google</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="6.03">search is done YouTube is unfortunately</text>
  <text start="436.259" dur="4.771">done it is so difficult to find anything</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="3.839">that you really want to watch anything</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="4.59">that has anything to do with whatever it</text>
  <text start="442.919" dur="5.37">is that you&amp;#39;re searching for that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="6.21">right that&amp;#39;s right and Patrick has been</text>
  <text start="448.289" dur="8.31">doing an interesting investigation into</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="7.11">how the MSM 4:00 a.m. news drop affects</text>
  <text start="456.599" dur="4.801">the Google searches what do you think</text>
  <text start="458.94" dur="4.92">about that Patrick it sure does</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="7.049">4:00 a.m. is traditionally the time in</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="6.83">which can you mute your microphone 4:00</text>
  <text start="468.449" dur="5.94">a.m. is traditionally the time in which</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="5.56">mass news production would produce their</text>
  <text start="474.389" dur="4.231">papers and then give them out to the</text>
  <text start="476.25" dur="4.169">morning commuters or to the people who</text>
  <text start="478.62" dur="4.2">wake up early who are the CEOs and the</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="3.631">movers and shakers of the countries they</text>
  <text start="482.82" dur="2.91">tend to wake up early and do their thing</text>
  <text start="484.05" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s their productive hour</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="3.56">and then their workday begins and then</text>
  <text start="487.8" dur="3.21">it works so they get the news upfront</text>
  <text start="489.29" dur="3.46">traditionally and read it from there and</text>
  <text start="491.01" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s kind of been the way it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="6.14">for quite a while the 4:00 a.m. has a</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="9.96">historical relevance but it also has a</text>
  <text start="498.89" dur="10.3">ai training relevance as well so when in</text>
  <text start="506.73" dur="3.9">order for Google to figure out what</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="3">you&amp;#39;re searching for you give it words</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="3.3">you type in your words and it gives you</text>
  <text start="512.19" dur="3.36">some suggestions but how does it map</text>
  <text start="513.93" dur="3.06">those suggestions how does it know what</text>
  <text start="515.55" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re talking about how can I give it a</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="5.16">word and then it just happens to know</text>
  <text start="518.79" dur="5.58">what it is I&amp;#39;m making context about well</text>
  <text start="522.15" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s mapping all of us doing this</text>
  <text start="524.37" dur="4.41">at the same time and is building the</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="3.6">associations from what it is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.78" dur="4.35">looking for so if I type in dog and I</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="4.14">click on a link that registers somewhere</text>
  <text start="533.13" dur="3.99">so that when someone else searches for</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="3.51">it they see that Oh dog was associated</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="2.88">with this thing because this person</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="6.03">clicked on it and it kind of feeds and</text>
  <text start="540" dur="6.69">builds up but when you have a new cycle</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="5.7">which is about 24 hours for the most</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="5.85">part you have a topic for a day you</text>
  <text start="549.96" dur="5.4">plant it out your editor of your post</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.08">your editor of Washington Post and you</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="2.67">say here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="3.06">for the day here&amp;#39;s the points here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="558.03" dur="4.05">personalities here&amp;#39;s the narrative and</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="4.68">go get the work and you coordinate this</text>
  <text start="562.08" dur="5.22">across the outlets you can do as well as</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="5.31">your other peer outlets too so if you</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="3.87">are part of what would have what we know</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="1.92">on Twitter for example as the blue</text>
  <text start="571.17" dur="2.73">checks</text>
  <text start="571.59" dur="8.82">well Google also has a factor called</text>
  <text start="573.9" dur="8.88">authoritative &amp;#39;no stood Thorat ativ on a</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="5.94">subject so they&amp;#39;re a subject expert or</text>
  <text start="582.78" dur="5.43">they are a a a news outlet who has</text>
  <text start="586.35" dur="3.66">journalistic integrity or stuff like</text>
  <text start="588.21" dur="4.83">that and so those people will get</text>
  <text start="590.01" dur="5.28">special weights and bonuses in the</text>
  <text start="593.04" dur="3.72">Google system and this is all in you</text>
  <text start="595.29" dur="4.53">know all in Zacks documents you can</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="6.96">definitely find it and so what this</text>
  <text start="599.82" dur="6.26">means is if all of these players decide</text>
  <text start="603.72" dur="6.48">to have a coordinated message for a day</text>
  <text start="606.08" dur="6.37">let&amp;#39;s say New York Times says is Trump</text>
  <text start="610.2" dur="4.17">racist let&amp;#39;s say Washington Post turns</text>
  <text start="612.45" dur="5.27">around and says racist man likes Trump</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="5.38">and let&amp;#39;s say some other person says</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="3.77">accusations of racism plague</text>
  <text start="619.75" dur="3.48">krump those are three totally separate</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="3.93">headlines but the two objects of that</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="5.4">sentence are racist and Trump so you</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="5.58">feed all that up to your articles Google</text>
  <text start="628.63" dur="5.52">will crawl these articles and because of</text>
  <text start="631" dur="5.34">their rating of authoritative Nosara</text>
  <text start="634.15" dur="4.62">khals get jammed in at 4:00 in the</text>
  <text start="636.34" dur="5.7">morning when they reset the the the</text>
  <text start="638.77" dur="5.31">narrative theoretically reset the</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="4.05">narrative at Google so what happens is</text>
  <text start="644.08" dur="3.93">racists and Trump gets associated for</text>
  <text start="646.09" dur="4.29">the entire day because of their highly</text>
  <text start="648.01" dur="4.86">authoritative score and anybody else who</text>
  <text start="650.38" dur="5.28">tries to knock that Association back has</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="4.59">no chance of doing so so what happened</text>
  <text start="655.66" dur="3.84">basically to sum this all down the</text>

  <text start="661.72" dur="5.67">sure we&amp;#39;ve all seen videos of that where</text>
  <text start="663.85" dur="5.13">you have local local newscasters saying</text>

  <text start="670.63" dur="5.67">if you have all of these news players</text>
  <text start="673.3" dur="5.58">putting out their articles at that time</text>
  <text start="676.3" dur="4.2">by the time Google comes collected for</text>
  <text start="678.88" dur="4.47">the beginning of the day the narrative</text>
  <text start="680.5" dur="4.65">that sets the tone of how your search</text>

  <text start="685.15" dur="7.08">subjects Wow very interesting that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.28" dur="4.02">extremely interesting yes so they</text>
  <text start="692.23" dur="3.359">basically they block it through like</text>
  <text start="694.3" dur="3.75">each day is a new different thing</text>
  <text start="695.589" dur="4.591">correct that&amp;#39;s right the daily cycle and</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="4.05">they block it by not blocking it this is</text>
  <text start="700.18" dur="3.63">where it gets convoluted this is where</text>
  <text start="702.1" dur="3.36">they see Google can throw their hands up</text>
  <text start="703.81" dur="3.81">and saying well we&amp;#39;re not censoring and</text>
  <text start="705.46" dur="3.66">then the journalist can say where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="707.62" dur="3.69">not censoring and in reality what</text>
  <text start="709.12" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re doing is Google is opening up</text>
  <text start="711.31" dur="5.61">the gateway to allow the the journalist</text>
  <text start="713.92" dur="5.04">articles to train the AI which then</text>
  <text start="716.92" dur="4.08">determines the contextual associations</text>
  <text start="718.96" dur="3.69">of the words which then determines what</text>
  <text start="721" dur="4.98">appears in the first five pages of a</text>
  <text start="722.65" dur="5.93">Google search result so in machine</text>
  <text start="725.98" dur="5.94">learning what we call this is hyper</text>
  <text start="728.58" dur="5.83">parameterization Patrick knows more</text>
  <text start="731.92" dur="4.74">about that though what is that so in the</text>
  <text start="734.41" dur="4.77">documents you&amp;#39;ll see a you&amp;#39;ll - search</text>
  <text start="736.66" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s a website I&amp;#39;m just gonna rename</text>
  <text start="739.18" dur="5.159">I don&amp;#39;t know how much of this is being</text>
  <text start="740.589" dur="6.931">seen I will change my name to the</text>

  <text start="754.12" dur="5.07">I should probably write that down let me</text>
  <text start="756.52" dur="4.319">go do that but in the meantime hyper</text>
  <text start="759.19" dur="6.75">parameters work like this and they are</text>
  <text start="760.839" dur="7.771">in Zacks documents where they say okay</text>
  <text start="765.94" dur="4.83">well we&amp;#39;re trying to stop unfair search</text>
  <text start="768.61" dur="6.15">results and their example of that would</text>
  <text start="770.77" dur="5.569">say men are two kings as women are two</text>
  <text start="774.76" dur="3.72">queens</text>
  <text start="776.339" dur="6.341">well I can&amp;#39;t write and talk at the same</text>
  <text start="778.48" dur="6.51">time and so that&amp;#39;s a fair Association</text>
  <text start="782.68" dur="4.52">but what if the Association was men are</text>
  <text start="784.99" dur="4.71">two programmers as women are two</text>
  <text start="787.2" dur="4.84">homemakers and that&amp;#39;s considered an</text>
  <text start="789.7" dur="4.17">unfair Association so what the</text>
  <text start="792.04" dur="4.14">recommendation is to use Hyper</text>
  <text start="793.87" dur="4.2">parameters which say we&amp;#39;re going to blow</text>
  <text start="796.18" dur="3.48">away that association before it happens</text>
  <text start="798.07" dur="3.269">so you want to go to this webpage not</text>
  <text start="799.66" dur="5.16">the one that&amp;#39;s crossed out just there</text>
  <text start="801.339" dur="6.121">Google - leaked on search SH and you</text>
  <text start="804.82" dur="5.519">want to search for hyper parameter one</text>

  <text start="810.339" dur="6.151">example of where what document to look</text>
  <text start="814" dur="4.62">into in his leaks and what the context</text>
  <text start="816.49" dur="6.99">is so what a hyper parameter does it</text>
  <text start="818.62" dur="7.17">does this you can&amp;#39;t train the AI to say</text>
  <text start="823.48" dur="4.32">stop making that Association because</text>
  <text start="825.79" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s Google and has billions of points</text>
  <text start="827.8" dur="3.479">of reference that&amp;#39;s telling it that this</text>
  <text start="829.24" dur="4.289">association is valid in its own system</text>
  <text start="831.279" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s not like a hard drive or a database</text>
  <text start="833.529" dur="6.421">where you can just kind of walk in and</text>
  <text start="835.18" dur="6.72">rip out a certain code and just free</text>
  <text start="839.95" dur="4.95">compile that&amp;#39;s not how a AI works at all</text>
  <text start="841.9" dur="5.4">what ends up happening is you have to</text>
  <text start="844.9" dur="5.01">trick your AI into doing what you want</text>
  <text start="847.3" dur="4.26">it to do so you have to eliminate this</text>
  <text start="849.91" dur="3.48">association and then you might have to</text>
  <text start="851.56" dur="3.719">eliminate some other weird Association</text>
  <text start="853.39" dur="4.17">and some other Asuza it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="855.279" dur="4.111">complicated surgical task so hyper</text>

  <text start="1224.47" dur="3.45">these hyper parameters so those three</text>
  <text start="1226.09" dur="5.76">things I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s massive</text>
  <text start="1227.92" dur="5.31">operational oversight and they can they</text>
  <text start="1231.85" dur="3.12">can hide any kind of government</text>
  <text start="1233.23" dur="3.06">legislation that comes up from saying</text>
  <text start="1234.97" dur="3.3">antitrust or anything along those lines</text>
  <text start="1236.29" dur="4.14">they can turn around and feign</text>
  <text start="1238.27" dur="4.11">compliance they can go through the</text>
  <text start="1240.43" dur="3.21">audits all day long and say see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1242.38" dur="2.97">not doing this and they&amp;#39;ll just pack it</text>
  <text start="1243.64" dur="3.63">in let us pack it in the machine</text>
  <text start="1245.35" dur="4.02">learning even further this isn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="1247.27" dur="5.07">discourage but this is both almost like</text>
  <text start="1249.37" dur="6.99">we do are you familiar at all with the</text>
  <text start="1252.34" dur="7.47">antitrust case that happened in the EU</text>
  <text start="1256.36" dur="5.85">with Google oh yeah the GDR GPR believe</text>
  <text start="1259.81" dur="6.09">it was yes that was a privacy issue</text>
  <text start="1262.21" dur="5.97">primarily okay that was the EU being</text>
  <text start="1265.9" dur="4.5">upset that Google was basically</text>
  <text start="1268.18" dur="4.47">dominating our markets and they wanted</text>
  <text start="1270.4" dur="2.91">they wanted a local sort of competition</text>
  <text start="1272.65" dur="2.86">to take over</text>
  <text start="1273.31" dur="4">I mean brush&amp;#39;s Yandex China&amp;#39;s Baidu</text>
  <text start="1275.51" dur="6.27">we have Google but does Europe have you</text>
  <text start="1277.31" dur="6.68">know so yeah so they the GD P R I might</text>
  <text start="1281.78" dur="5.04">be mangling that that was primarily</text>
  <text start="1283.99" dur="5.98">citizens privacy rights not so much</text>
  <text start="1286.82" dur="5.4">antitrust that that was the idea saying</text>
  <text start="1289.97" dur="4.23">hey if you&amp;#39;re selling my ad rep if</text>
  <text start="1292.22" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re selling my behavior and my</text>
  <text start="1294.2" dur="4.83">associations and what I&amp;#39;m doing online</text>
  <text start="1296.57" dur="4.53">to generate revenue either pay me or get</text>
  <text start="1299.03" dur="4.41">you know tell me you&amp;#39;re doing that and</text>
  <text start="1301.1" dur="2.85">so I can opt out and that&amp;#39;s kind of how</text>
  <text start="1303.44" dur="4.86">that went</text>
  <text start="1303.95" dur="6.72">I think that they considered it</text>
  <text start="1308.3" dur="4.32">antitrust still just because of the fact</text>
  <text start="1310.67" dur="3.3">that Google is you know they have the</text>
  <text start="1312.62" dur="2.7">monopoly on it I mean they&amp;#39;re the only</text>
  <text start="1313.97" dur="3.54">people that really are doing it I mean</text>
  <text start="1315.32" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s Google and Facebook think about who</text>
  <text start="1317.51" dur="2.94">owns data it&amp;#39;s you know 50/50</text>
  <text start="1319.19" dur="5.25">essentially split between the two of</text>
  <text start="1320.45" dur="5.43">them but I just wondered you&amp;#39;ve said a</text>
  <text start="1324.44" dur="3.54">couple of things that I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="1325.88" dur="3.57">recently I can&amp;#39;t go I can&amp;#39;t talk about</text>
  <text start="1327.98" dur="4.53">it right now I&amp;#39;ve kind of bummed out but</text>
  <text start="1329.45" dur="5.97">I would I would really like to have you</text>
  <text start="1332.51" dur="4.59">back a you know it perhaps on my show in</text>
  <text start="1335.42" dur="5.37">the future because I think that you</text>
  <text start="1337.1" dur="6.63">would have a lot of insight into these</text>
  <text start="1340.79" dur="4.23">specific instances of information then I</text>
  <text start="1343.73" dur="4.07">want to talk about but I can&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="1345.02" dur="7.17">about it follow-up all right sweet</text>

  <text start="1380.84" dur="1.68">off for a second well how about this</text>
  <text start="1382.25" dur="5.22">then</text>
  <text start="1382.52" dur="7.98">Zach in within the confines of the</text>
  <text start="1387.47" dur="5.67">information that you brought forward you</text>
  <text start="1390.5" dur="5.73">know how it was this information</text>
  <text start="1393.14" dur="6.84">relevant to the things that you saw on a</text>
  <text start="1396.23" dur="7.2">daily basis there at Google I mean a lot</text>
  <text start="1399.98" dur="6.42">of it a lot of it was how can I search</text>
  <text start="1403.43" dur="5.239">for executive order donald trump cuban</text>
  <text start="1406.4" dur="5.239">trafficking and then i get</text>
  <text start="1408.669" dur="5.46">redirected towards kids and cages there</text>
  <text start="1411.639" dur="3.87">you go and I was just like why is this</text>
  <text start="1414.129" dur="3.27">happening over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="1415.509" dur="3.63">how come whenever I search for a keyword</text>
  <text start="1417.399" dur="5.21">I get redirected towards an</text>
  <text start="1419.139" dur="6.99">establishment manufactured narrative and</text>
  <text start="1422.609" dur="6.01">at first the hyper parameters thing I</text>
  <text start="1426.129" dur="4.941">didn&amp;#39;t even know what it meant right and</text>
  <text start="1428.619" dur="5.221">so I skipped over it when I saw it</text>
  <text start="1431.07" dur="4.359">Patrick had the knowledge of what that</text>
  <text start="1433.84" dur="4.169">meant because of the experience with</text>
  <text start="1435.429" dur="5.25">that big data and AI techniques and so</text>
  <text start="1438.009" dur="5.01">he was a little pulled out and confirmed</text>
  <text start="1440.679" dur="4.5">that they were using hyper parameters</text>
  <text start="1443.019" dur="5.331">and I was like what does that mean he</text>
  <text start="1445.179" dur="4.68">wrote up this this huge PowerPoint</text>
  <text start="1448.35" dur="4.24">presentation</text>
  <text start="1449.859" dur="4.231">flow chart of how this works and you</text>
  <text start="1452.59" dur="3.809">know I want to tie this back into a lot</text>
  <text start="1454.09" dur="5.1">of things that Q is saying is that he</text>
  <text start="1456.399" dur="5.13">kept on talking about the 4:00 a.m. news</text>
  <text start="1459.19" dur="5.209">cycle and the question that I&amp;#39;ve had for</text>
  <text start="1461.529" dur="6.061">a very long time is why has that been in</text>
  <text start="1464.399" dur="6.85">importance and now we we know why is</text>
  <text start="1467.59" dur="6.51">that this is how the establishment is</text>
  <text start="1471.249" dur="4.77">training the 24-hour news cycle</text>
  <text start="1474.1" dur="3.539">that&amp;#39;s just why they have to release it</text>
  <text start="1476.019" dur="3.75">at 4:00 a.m. now there might be some</text>
  <text start="1477.639" dur="4.5">legacy reasons I think that 4 a.m. is</text>
  <text start="1479.769" dur="4.47">the time that no no one&amp;#39;s got any</text>
  <text start="1482.139" dur="3.691">business hours I dig that like London or</text>
  <text start="1484.239" dur="3.87">something ends and then there&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="1485.83" dur="5.969">30-minute window between New York</text>
  <text start="1488.109" dur="6.03">starting something like that and and so</text>
  <text start="1491.799" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s that there may be a legacy reason</text>
  <text start="1494.139" dur="4.591">but I think that this has evolved into a</text>
  <text start="1496.149" dur="5.78">way in which the establishment can set</text>
  <text start="1498.73" dur="6.929">the agenda for the next 24 hours ok</text>
  <text start="1501.929" dur="5.411">makes sense and using AI to do it using</text>
  <text start="1505.659" dur="3.84">AI as an enforcement agent of that</text>
  <text start="1507.34" dur="3.569">narrow different yeah and this and this</text>
  <text start="1509.499" dur="3.87">and this kind of goes into everything</text>
  <text start="1510.909" dur="5.161">else that that I&amp;#39;ve seen Google do and</text>
  <text start="1513.369" dur="4.89">sort of a pattern is that they want to</text>
  <text start="1516.07" dur="4.589">preserve possible deniability and so</text>
  <text start="1518.259" dur="5.37">what they do is that they allow their</text>
  <text start="1520.659" dur="5.671">services to have certain exploits or</text>
  <text start="1523.629" dur="5.52">gamification and then that gamification</text>
  <text start="1526.33" dur="4.979">is given to a group of insiders who then</text>
  <text start="1529.149" dur="4.41">exploit that and then get the upper hand</text>
  <text start="1531.309" dur="4.771">and anti-competitive way against other</text>
  <text start="1533.559" dur="4.651">people you know this is something that</text>
  <text start="1536.08" dur="3.959">I&amp;#39;ve noticed quite often with Google is</text>
  <text start="1538.21" dur="3.599">they they have that level of plausible</text>
  <text start="1540.039" dur="2.581">deniability like we were talking about</text>
  <text start="1541.809" dur="3.271">Tim</text>
  <text start="1542.62" dur="4.77">this list comes out and it&amp;#39;s Tim Poole</text>
  <text start="1545.08" dur="4.56">is part of this list of journalists that</text>
  <text start="1547.39" dur="5.22">are being censored but Tim Poole will</text>
  <text start="1549.64" dur="5.97">get over 200,000 views on a video within</text>
  <text start="1552.61" dur="4.55">two hours of putting it out and I think</text>
  <text start="1555.61" dur="4.77">that by and large he&amp;#39;s fully monetized</text>
  <text start="1557.16" dur="5.139">but then Google says well we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1560.38" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re not censoring Tim Poole despite</text>
  <text start="1562.299" dur="3.331">the fact that there is like clear</text>
  <text start="1563.89" dur="4.86">indication that he&amp;#39;s on a list of people</text>
  <text start="1565.63" dur="5.1">that are being censored but by by</text>
  <text start="1568.75" dur="4.2">showing that information you know I look</text>
  <text start="1570.73" dur="4.079">at Tim you know he&amp;#39;s on a list but he</text>
  <text start="1572.95" dur="4.41">definitely has commercials and he gets a</text>
  <text start="1574.809" dur="4.951">lot of views so clearly they&amp;#39;re sending</text>
  <text start="1577.36" dur="5.28">on notifications but then you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1579.76" dur="5.01">many other people who are in YouTube who</text>
  <text start="1582.64" dur="3.99">their subscribers never get a</text>
  <text start="1584.77" dur="4.74">notification that something is going out</text>
  <text start="1586.63" dur="5.64">they maybe receive a notification days</text>
  <text start="1589.51" dur="5.399">after a videos been released</text>
  <text start="1592.27" dur="4.26">you know then that way they can say well</text>
  <text start="1594.909" dur="4.051">you know we just we haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="1596.53" dur="4.889">censoring anybody but they they clearly</text>
  <text start="1598.96" dur="4.98">have and the thing is is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1601.419" dur="4.831">actually censoring Tim Poole and when we</text>
  <text start="1603.94" dur="5.729">did the first leak he came out and on</text>
  <text start="1606.25" dur="6.63">his first video after the leak in June</text>
  <text start="1609.669" dur="6.12">he said no I we&amp;#39;re not seeing any</text>
  <text start="1612.88" dur="7.83">traffic drop well then the next day he</text>
  <text start="1615.789" dur="6.811">actually realized that that yes they did</text>
  <text start="1620.71" dur="5.28">have a drop but it was being masked</text>
  <text start="1622.6" dur="5.4">because YouTube had featured them and so</text>
  <text start="1625.99" dur="3.54">it was it was it was covering up the</text>
  <text start="1628" dur="6.84">fact that there was this search</text>
  <text start="1629.53" dur="7.35">suggestion you know break and so it was</text>
  <text start="1634.84" dur="6.12">it was kind of a temporary fix giving</text>
  <text start="1636.88" dur="7.08">him viewers not to hide to hide this and</text>
  <text start="1640.96" dur="4.98">so yeah like interest no Tim Poole got</text>
  <text start="1643.96" dur="4.05">special access and that kind of like I</text>
  <text start="1645.94" dur="3.239">think bought his silence and it was</text>
  <text start="1648.01" dur="3.72">really good that he was able to pay</text>
  <text start="1649.179" dur="4.531">attention to this because you know later</text>
  <text start="1651.73" dur="5.429">on down the road when they would have</text>
  <text start="1653.71" dur="4.89">turned off that that funnelling then he</text>
  <text start="1657.159" dur="5.461">would have fallen just like everyone</text>
  <text start="1658.6" dur="7.11">else Wow okay well I know that Thomas</text>
  <text start="1662.62" dur="5.07">has seen a you know a drop in traffic</text>
  <text start="1665.71" dur="3.9">over the last several months so I think</text>
  <text start="1667.69" dur="4.59">we you know all of us in this in this</text>
  <text start="1669.61" dur="5.01">little Club we have all seen precipitous</text>
  <text start="1672.28" dur="3.22">drop in traffic occasionally it comes</text>
  <text start="1674.62" dur="2.26">back up but</text>
  <text start="1675.5" dur="3.27">doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be any rhyme or reason</text>
  <text start="1676.88" dur="4.11">from it so you know I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1678.77" dur="4.35">just another way for them to have that</text>
  <text start="1680.99" dur="3.39">plausible deniability they just you know</text>
  <text start="1683.12" dur="2.64">oh look you know all the sudden I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1684.38" dur="5.09">getting traffic I don&amp;#39;t know where it</text>
  <text start="1685.76" dur="6.69">came from you know it seems that when</text>
  <text start="1689.47" dur="6.64">when the Huffington Post wrote that</text>
  <text start="1692.45" dur="5.52">article it was not even less than 24</text>
  <text start="1696.11" dur="4.05">hours that&amp;#39;s when I noticed it so all</text>
  <text start="1697.97" dur="4.29">these people are like correlating with</text>
  <text start="1700.16" dur="4.14">each other some way I don&amp;#39;t I mean</text>
  <text start="1702.26" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re all pro knees with each other</text>
  <text start="1704.3" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s very strange but that&amp;#39;s when I</text>
  <text start="1705.53" dur="4.44">noticed it it stayed like that this time</text>
  <text start="1707.51" dur="2.85">though the levels have not gone back to</text>
  <text start="1709.97" dur="2.91">normal</text>
  <text start="1710.36" dur="6.21">they still are suppressed this is</text>
  <text start="1712.88" dur="7.01">probably the worst it&amp;#39;s been since I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1716.57" dur="6.03">had this channel what about you Zack or</text>
  <text start="1719.89" dur="4.89">down below is that is that is that sound</text>
  <text start="1722.6" dur="2.18">about right</text>
  <text start="1726.24" dur="9.12">you&amp;#39;re heated oh wait no I muted ya what</text>
  <text start="1734.1" dur="3.149">has it been for me I mean I don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1735.36" dur="3.059">youtube channel no but is it like corley</text>
  <text start="1737.249" dur="2.76">do you think these people are like</text>
  <text start="1738.419" dur="2.73">correlating this together like with</text>
  <text start="1740.009" dur="3.39">huffington post and then they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1741.149" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;ll do like a they&amp;#39;ll do a hit piece</text>
  <text start="1743.399" dur="4.02">on they did a hit piece on like four or</text>
  <text start="1745.019" dur="4.051">five channels and then these people then</text>
  <text start="1747.419" dur="4.291">that all their numbers go down so</text>
  <text start="1749.07" dur="5.299">obviously they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re waiting it yes</text>
  <text start="1751.71" dur="6.539">it&amp;#39;s called operation Mockingbird</text>
  <text start="1754.369" dur="6.16">correct yeah exactly it&amp;#39;s sickening</text>
  <text start="1758.249" dur="4.68">and it&amp;#39;s not fair and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the the</text>

  <text start="1768.72" dur="7.699">are Patrick or Zach but what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>

  <text start="1781.529" dur="4.59">worst it&amp;#39;s been but let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="1783.72" dur="7.939">PewDiePie because he just gave a</text>
  <text start="1786.119" dur="5.54">generous donation of $50,000 to the ADL</text>

  <text start="1797.36" dur="4.809">which proves that there are an extortion</text>
  <text start="1799.74" dur="4.409">racket right like yeah the ADL gets done</text>
  <text start="1802.169" dur="3.691">trashing someone and you know</text>
  <text start="1804.149" dur="3.51">essentially it&amp;#39;s thugs going in and</text>
  <text start="1805.86" dur="3.779">breaking everything up and then the guys</text>
  <text start="1807.659" dur="3.691">like oh now I&amp;#39;m paying the thugs thank</text>
  <text start="1809.639" dur="3.721">you very much thugs for offering me the</text>
  <text start="1811.35" dur="5.069">protection that I so desperately needed</text>

  <text start="1816.419" dur="3.901">going on right now and I can paint where</text>
  <text start="1818.669" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s going to go as well because of</text>

  <text start="1822.509" dur="3.571">Law Center&amp;#39;s history as well which has a</text>

  <text start="1830.999" dur="4.111">institutions which work with these</text>
  <text start="1833.1" dur="4.769">journalists what they can do is they can</text>
  <text start="1835.11" dur="6.299">take that extortion racket and automate</text>
  <text start="1837.869" dur="6.451">it so they won&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1841.409" dur="5.041">target a person directly if you if you</text>
  <text start="1844.32" dur="4.5">get targeted it&amp;#39;s because you tripped up</text>

  <text start="1848.82" dur="3.689">followers you have too many views you</text>
  <text start="1850.769" dur="3.691">have too many this that and another and</text>
  <text start="1852.509" dur="2.76">then the automated nosov it comes down</text>
  <text start="1854.46" dur="3.059">and tax you</text>
  <text start="1855.269" dur="3.571">PewDiePie was probably an individual hit</text>

  <text start="1859.52" dur="4.11">train these AIS on what to look for and</text>
  <text start="1862.13" dur="3.33">then once that was done then he could</text>

  <text start="1950.27" dur="2.49">let Zack go you&amp;#39;re muted right now Zack</text>
  <text start="1951.86" dur="3.24">if you want to go first</text>
  <text start="1952.76" dur="4.83">like you know my theory I mean I think</text>
  <text start="1955.1" dur="4.77">that you know there&amp;#39;s this Google detox</text>
  <text start="1957.59" dur="5.16">that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about which is</text>
  <text start="1959.87" dur="5.16">that you stop using Google products</text>
  <text start="1962.75" dur="3.96">ironically your channel is on YouTube</text>
  <text start="1965.03" dur="3.42">and we&amp;#39;re talking about all this on on</text>
  <text start="1966.71" dur="5.76">YouTube which is owned by Google and</text>
  <text start="1968.45" dur="6.75">alphabet but you know I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="1972.47" dur="5.52">the ADL and the SL PC have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1975.2" dur="7.02">inroads with alternative platforms like</text>
  <text start="1977.99" dur="6.66">bit chutes you know and mine&amp;#39;s calm so</text>
  <text start="1982.22" dur="6.12">you know what we may be looking at is a</text>
  <text start="1984.65" dur="5.61">balkanization of contents that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1988.34" dur="5.01">distributed across different types of</text>
  <text start="1990.26" dur="5.46">platforms you know we may see that</text>
  <text start="1993.35" dur="5.1">the ADL may you know be able to sink its</text>
  <text start="1995.72" dur="5.67">hooks and stay involved in the decisions</text>
  <text start="1998.45" dur="4.95">of YouTube and Google but they may not</text>
  <text start="2001.39" dur="4.95">be able to have this little fiefdom in</text>
  <text start="2003.4" dur="6.57">these other platforms and so my might</text>
  <text start="2006.34" dur="6.51">you know my my recommendation is that</text>
  <text start="2009.97" dur="4.98">the solution is that we start we start</text>
  <text start="2012.85" dur="4.89">diversifying and start being more</text>
  <text start="2014.95" dur="6.229">inclusive with the platforms that were</text>
  <text start="2017.74" dur="6.33">that we&amp;#39;re ingesting for content</text>
  <text start="2021.179" dur="6.971">absolutely that&amp;#39;s sort of um that</text>
  <text start="2024.07" dur="6.239">Federation of how consumption is</text>
  <text start="2028.15" dur="5.45">produced distributed and consumed is a</text>
  <text start="2030.309" dur="5.73">natural organic reaction to this type of</text>
  <text start="2033.6" dur="5.41">technology sort of business going on</text>
  <text start="2036.039" dur="5.611">there&amp;#39;s also a much more proactive way</text>
  <text start="2039.01" dur="4.35">to do this and it&amp;#39;s called butterfly war</text>
  <text start="2041.65" dur="3.42">and butterfly war you can go to cult</text>
  <text start="2043.36" dur="3.99">State comm you can read all about</text>
  <text start="2045.07" dur="4.95">butterfly war basically it is a</text>
  <text start="2047.35" dur="6.079">technique that tricks the AIS and to</text>
  <text start="2050.02" dur="6.96">targeting the wrong people so right now</text>
  <text start="2053.429" dur="6.19">you will have Google going after</text>
  <text start="2056.98" dur="6.09">politically sensitive targets or</text>
  <text start="2059.619" dur="5.401">politically saturated targets so that</text>
  <text start="2063.07" dur="3.78">would include my LOI innopolis out</text>
  <text start="2065.02" dur="3.75">include Alex Jones that would include</text>
  <text start="2066.85" dur="5.519">like you know the list you guys are here</text>
  <text start="2068.77" dur="6.72">so going after those people is what the</text>
  <text start="2072.369" dur="5.28">AI is already trained to do we know who</text>
  <text start="2075.49" dur="5.399">it&amp;#39;s going after but we also know who it</text>
  <text start="2077.649" dur="5.851">isn&amp;#39;t going after it isn&amp;#39;t going after</text>
  <text start="2080.889" dur="4.861">certain types of people it isn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="2083.5" dur="3.96">after protected classes in the United</text>
  <text start="2085.75" dur="4.53">States we have a legal concept known as</text>
  <text start="2087.46" dur="7.5">a protected class which means we cannot</text>
  <text start="2090.28" dur="6.869">go after I&amp;#39;m sorry we the if you decide</text>

  <text start="2097.149" dur="4.71">a corporation or any type of powerful</text>

  <text start="2118.99" dur="5.73">you after the 70s in particular I should</text>
  <text start="2121.39" dur="5.27">say if you were a like for example when</text>
  <text start="2124.72" dur="3.71">banks were issuing out loans in the</text>
  <text start="2126.66" dur="3.84">70s and 80s they were engaging in a</text>
  <text start="2128.43" dur="4.47">process called redlining and that meant</text>
  <text start="2130.5" dur="3.809">they were giving out loans to whites in</text>
  <text start="2132.9" dur="4.889">a neighborhood and they were not giving</text>
  <text start="2134.309" dur="5.04">out loans to blacks because they they</text>
  <text start="2137.789" dur="2.971">looked at their metrics and saw that</text>
  <text start="2139.349" dur="2.311">blacks probably didn&amp;#39;t play back pay</text>
  <text start="2140.76" dur="2.7">back the loans that was our</text>
  <text start="2141.66" dur="4.199">justification so they would draw a red</text>
  <text start="2143.46" dur="4.32">line across a map saying do not issue</text>
  <text start="2145.859" dur="4.021">loans beyond this red line this was</text>
  <text start="2147.78" dur="4.38">considered massive institutional racism</text>
  <text start="2149.88" dur="3.9">and I got slapped down but google has</text>
  <text start="2152.16" dur="5.129">also been caught doing this multiple</text>
  <text start="2153.78" dur="6.569">times they&amp;#39;ve been caught denying ads to</text>

  <text start="2166.14" dur="2.88">that because of their inroads to the</text>

  <text start="2332.71" dur="4.71">attack vector and then I found out that</text>
  <text start="2335.079" dur="5.881">this was actually used at gamergate in</text>
  <text start="2337.42" dur="4.74">order to get people to the I think like</text>
  <text start="2340.96" dur="3.319">the white feminists and the black</text>
  <text start="2342.16" dur="10.5">feminists to go against each other and</text>
  <text start="2344.279" dur="10.691">and I was just like doing that my</text>
  <text start="2352.66" dur="4.32">factions against each other yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2354.97" dur="4.26">like who is this guy right but I</text>
  <text start="2356.98" dur="4.5">couldn&amp;#39;t come out and just be like you</text>
  <text start="2359.23" dur="3.799">know blah blah blah because you know I</text>
  <text start="2361.48" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t know whether he was good or bad</text>
  <text start="2363.029" dur="4.931">you know he had a lot of weird symbolism</text>
  <text start="2365.5" dur="4.74">all over his shit so I was like I was</text>
  <text start="2367.96" dur="3.839">like okay well I&amp;#39;m yeah I actually asked</text>
  <text start="2370.24" dur="3.18">like Jordan who this guy was and he was</text>
  <text start="2371.799" dur="5.841">like oh yeah he&amp;#39;s really awesome he yeah</text>
  <text start="2373.42" dur="7.83">check him out and so it wasn&amp;#39;t until I</text>
  <text start="2377.64" dur="6.34">was just about to leak that I reached</text>
  <text start="2381.25" dur="4.559">out to him over Facebook he accepted my</text>
  <text start="2383.98" dur="4.41">facebook why did you accept my facebook</text>
  <text start="2385.809" dur="4.56">friend I don&amp;#39;t know you did it right so</text>
  <text start="2388.39" dur="5.19">we were friends on Facebook and I</text>
  <text start="2390.369" dur="5.401">reached out and I was like hey Patrick</text>
  <text start="2393.58" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;m doing an operation and I want to</text>
  <text start="2395.77" dur="5.1">talk to you over secure comms and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2398.2" dur="7.11">like absolutely not I will not do any</text>
  <text start="2400.87" dur="6.03">secure comms because what he&amp;#39;s known in</text>
  <text start="2405.31" dur="2.94">the intelligence circles and so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2406.9" dur="4.44">a lot of people that have come after him</text>
  <text start="2408.25" dur="5.61">over the years I do anything secure it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2411.34" dur="4.08">bad i if like I get a random call from</text>
  <text start="2413.86" dur="2.76">someone let&amp;#39;s go secure comms I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="2415.42" dur="2.61">all right you&amp;#39;re probably gonna put me</text>
  <text start="2416.62" dur="2.85">in some mass shooting scenario and</text>
  <text start="2418.03" dur="2.97">probably spin that on me</text>
  <text start="2419.47" dur="4.65">nope not doing it I&amp;#39;m doing everything</text>
  <text start="2421" dur="4.8">open cops yeah so I was like I was like</text>
  <text start="2424.12" dur="4.28">okay well you&amp;#39;re not going to talk to me</text>
  <text start="2425.8" dur="7.86">over you know secure comms that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="2428.4" dur="7.03">this time is on my side and I&amp;#39;ll loop</text>
  <text start="2433.66" dur="5.52">back with you at the appropriate time</text>
  <text start="2435.43" dur="8.94">and so on Sunday at I think it was like</text>
  <text start="2439.18" dur="7.8">99 p.m. my time about maybe was 12:12</text>
  <text start="2444.37" dur="4.86">p.m. my time or 12:00 a.m. my time I I</text>
  <text start="2446.98" dur="4.32">sent a message and I said hey you know</text>
  <text start="2449.23" dur="4.8">check this out send them a link to the</text>
  <text start="2451.3" dur="4.88">project Veritas preview of the leaked</text>
  <text start="2454.03" dur="7.32">disclosure and I said hey Patrick</text>
  <text start="2456.18" dur="10.72">stock up on popcorn and and then he</text>
  <text start="2461.35" dur="11.34">tweeted out the Google Snowden that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2466.9" dur="8.16">predicted has finally arrived so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2472.69" dur="4.02">how we met all right and then and then</text>
  <text start="2475.06" dur="5.01">Patrick can you tell us about your</text>
  <text start="2476.71" dur="5.19">background like like what how you got</text>
  <text start="2480.07" dur="5.04">into this stuff because this is</text>
  <text start="2481.9" dur="5.01">remarkably like detailed and in pretty</text>
  <text start="2485.11" dur="5.61">intense work you know I mean for you to</text>
  <text start="2486.91" dur="5.67">be able to almost divine the actions of</text>
  <text start="2490.72" dur="4.05">Zak before knowing him it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="2492.58" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s yeah</text>
  <text start="2494.77" dur="6.03">divine is divinity had little to do with</text>
  <text start="2498.61" dur="7.08">that part of it might have had something</text>
  <text start="2500.8" dur="6.42">to do a bit earlier though so to let me</text>
  <text start="2505.69" dur="4.8">tie this into the question that was</text>
  <text start="2507.22" dur="6.69">asked what do we do about this stuff so</text>
  <text start="2510.49" dur="6.51">I was describing the concept of</text>
  <text start="2513.91" dur="4.77">protected classes and Zak touched on the</text>
  <text start="2517" dur="4.2">idea of spoofing metadata and I was</text>
  <text start="2518.68" dur="5.43">demonstrating how you spoof metadata so</text>
  <text start="2521.2" dur="5.19">if you have millions of people swiping</text>
  <text start="2524.11" dur="3.04">their phone it turns out that certain</text>
  <text start="2526.39" dur="2.59">races</text>
  <text start="2527.15" dur="3.99">swipe there one second you have certain</text>
  <text start="2528.98" dur="3.72">races swipe their phone one way you have</text>
  <text start="2531.14" dur="4.02">certain genders swipe their phone as</text>
  <text start="2532.7" dur="3.93">certainly so economic classes swipe</text>
  <text start="2535.16" dur="3.99">their phone a certain way it all</text>
  <text start="2536.63" dur="6.09">categorizes and classifies classifies</text>
  <text start="2539.15" dur="6.72">people the I&amp;#39;m sorry stop you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="2542.72" dur="6.45">that just the physicality the way that</text>
  <text start="2545.87" dur="5.34">someone swipes they can tell what type</text>
  <text start="2549.17" dur="4.05">of a person you are that is one factor</text>
  <text start="2551.21" dur="4.14">to a certainty conclusion</text>
  <text start="2553.22" dur="4.53">so the swiping is one part of it your</text>
  <text start="2555.35" dur="4.65">accelerometers in this phone as you move</text>
  <text start="2557.75" dur="4.26">you have a certain gait there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2560" dur="4.14">certain way just you can clearly</text>
  <text start="2562.01" dur="4.92">determine the gender of a person just</text>
  <text start="2564.14" dur="6.69">from the accelerometer data alone you</text>
  <text start="2566.93" dur="5.73">can this you&amp;#39;re a girl the hips</text>
  <text start="2570.83" dur="5.34">structures are different statistically</text>
  <text start="2572.66" dur="8.01">when you compile all the information</text>
  <text start="2576.17" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s not 100% accurate it&amp;#39;s not like I</text>
  <text start="2580.67" dur="3.69">know your phone and now I know your life</text>
  <text start="2581.96" dur="3.9">history that&amp;#39;s partially true but when</text>
  <text start="2584.36" dur="3.27">they want to drill down and narrow down</text>
  <text start="2585.86" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll come up with I&amp;#39;m 70%</text>
  <text start="2587.63" dur="2.82">certain as a female may 80% certain this</text>
  <text start="2589.91" dur="3.51">is a male</text>
  <text start="2590.45" dur="4.86">so accelerometers are a part of it and</text>
  <text start="2593.42" dur="3.78">then you obviously voice a voice</text>
  <text start="2595.31" dur="3.33">recognition we have now and camera stuff</text>
  <text start="2597.2" dur="4.11">we have now that&amp;#39;s also playing a large</text>
  <text start="2598.64" dur="4.2">part of things when you tweet right</text>
  <text start="2601.31" dur="3.78">there was one person who tried to come</text>
  <text start="2602.84" dur="4.35">at me online pretending he was anonymous</text>
  <text start="2605.09" dur="3.93">hunting down he was an auntie 4 person</text>
  <text start="2607.19" dur="2.88">hunting down what he thought was Nazis</text>
  <text start="2609.02" dur="3.12">everywhere in his mind</text>
  <text start="2610.07" dur="4.71">mm-hmm try to come after me because of</text>
  <text start="2612.14" dur="4.02">my background in gamergate and he</text>
  <text start="2614.78" dur="2.91">thought he was completely anonymous I</text>
  <text start="2616.16" dur="3.39">tried to do some research on couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2617.69" dur="3.96">find anything except one thing I did</text>
  <text start="2619.55" dur="3.99">find it was his entire tweet history in</text>
  <text start="2621.65" dur="4.02">The Times he was tweeting what that</text>
  <text start="2623.54" dur="3.96">meant was he was tweeting at certain</text>
  <text start="2625.67" dur="3.56">hours and not tweeting at certain hours</text>
  <text start="2627.5" dur="4.35">which means I knew when he fell asleep</text>
  <text start="2629.23" dur="4.12">now if I know when you fall asleep then</text>
  <text start="2631.85" dur="2.67">I could figure out what your timezone is</text>
  <text start="2633.35" dur="2.52">and if I could figure out what your</text>
  <text start="2634.52" dur="3.6">timezone is I can figure out where you</text>
  <text start="2635.87" dur="4.74">live needless to say that person hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2638.12" dur="4.53">attacked me since so there is all kinds</text>
  <text start="2640.61" dur="4.23">of metadata you can use to correlate to</text>
  <text start="2642.65" dur="4.59">figure out the identity of a person now</text>
  <text start="2644.84" dur="4.59">what I&amp;#39;m proposing to fight against</text>
  <text start="2647.24" dur="4.32">Google if they don&amp;#39;t want to play fair</text>
  <text start="2649.43" dur="5.31">and go by the law and admit what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2651.56" dur="6.66">doing what you can do instead is you can</text>
  <text start="2654.74" dur="6.39">spoof the metadata that means you can</text>
  <text start="2658.22" dur="4.649">say all right why don&amp;#39;t I fire up a fur</text>
  <text start="2661.13" dur="5.399">to a machine that represents this phone</text>
  <text start="2662.869" dur="5.46">and I will submit fake data to Google I</text>
  <text start="2666.529" dur="4.171">will submit fake swipes I will submit</text>
  <text start="2668.329" dur="4.801">fake accelerometer data fake GPS data</text>
  <text start="2670.7" dur="4.29">fake Wi-Fi data fake battery power I</text>
  <text start="2673.13" dur="3.719">will submit the entire thing to</text>
  <text start="2674.99" dur="3.39">everything that&amp;#39;s collecting and how</text>
  <text start="2676.849" dur="6.061">will I know that the spoof worked</text>
  <text start="2678.38" dur="8.28">because Google will show me an ad Wow</text>
  <text start="2682.91" dur="6.359">did this oh it works in concept it</text>
  <text start="2686.66" dur="4.8">absolutely works if you can if you can</text>
  <text start="2689.269" dur="4.951">hit it with a large enough amount of</text>
  <text start="2691.46" dur="4.139">resources you send all the metadata to</text>
  <text start="2694.22" dur="3.089">all the things that are collecting it</text>
  <text start="2695.599" dur="3.571">what will happen is Google will show you</text>
  <text start="2697.309" dur="4.411">an ad that will say I think you&amp;#39;re this</text>
  <text start="2699.17" dur="4.889">person right so if you start seeing ads</text>
  <text start="2701.72" dur="5.369">for freaking Popeye&amp;#39;s Chicken guess what</text>
  <text start="2704.059" dur="6.841">race they think you are just like that</text>
  <text start="2707.089" dur="5.401">so so what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s the benefit of this</text>
  <text start="2710.9" dur="3.629">I mean like are you saying that there</text>
  <text start="2712.49" dur="5.819">are places where there&amp;#39;s like a server</text>
  <text start="2714.529" dur="6.3">farm of virtual in Google pixels just</text>
  <text start="2718.309" dur="4.74">like swinging around so that they can</text>
  <text start="2720.829" dur="4.861">you know maybe get ads served up to</text>
  <text start="2723.049" dur="5.851">Google for a certain thing like how</text>
  <text start="2725.69" dur="5.31">would this be useful sure so in the</text>
  <text start="2728.9" dur="4.23">usefulness is amazing because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2731" dur="5.039">such thing as metadata security doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2733.13" dur="4.679">exist all it the only the closest thing</text>
  <text start="2736.039" dur="3.78">the metadata security you have is the</text>
  <text start="2737.809" dur="3.78">already historical information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2739.819" dur="4.02">available to compare against but all</text>
  <text start="2741.589" dur="3.901">that will do is lock down the importance</text>
  <text start="2743.839" dur="4.051">of that information and deny all future</text>
  <text start="2745.49" dur="4.92">information you cloud the entire ability</text>
  <text start="2747.89" dur="4.229">to do metadata analysis so what that</text>
  <text start="2750.41" dur="3.54">means is what they do that lock down</text>
  <text start="2752.119" dur="5.22">defensively what they&amp;#39;re going to end up</text>
  <text start="2753.95" dur="5.339">doing is saying crap we can&amp;#39;t tell fake</text>
  <text start="2757.339" dur="3.631">black people from real black people we</text>
  <text start="2759.289" dur="3.961">can&amp;#39;t tell fake females from real</text>
  <text start="2760.97" dur="4.47">females anymore and so their ability to</text>
  <text start="2763.25" dur="4.74">serve ads get destroyed which means it</text>
  <text start="2765.44" dur="4.619">affects their revenue and worse if they</text>
  <text start="2767.99" dur="4.289">decide to let&amp;#39;s say the spoofing</text>
  <text start="2770.059" dur="4.29">technique ends up on 4chan 8chan when it</text>
  <text start="2772.279" dur="4.29">comes back whatever and you have a bunch</text>
  <text start="2774.349" dur="3.811">of hilarious trolls pretending to be</text>
  <text start="2776.569" dur="4.381">these different groups which by the way</text>
  <text start="2778.16" dur="4.47">are absolutely confusing the AIS and</text>
  <text start="2780.95" dur="4.02">Google comes in with their fairness</text>
  <text start="2782.63" dur="4.139">strategy and says well we have to we</text>
  <text start="2784.97" dur="4.079">have to do something because these white</text>
  <text start="2786.769" dur="4.471">nationalists are pretending to be black</text>
  <text start="2789.049" dur="3.51">feminists and that&amp;#39;s not going to do so</text>
  <text start="2791.24" dur="3.24">we have to actually go after black</text>
  <text start="2792.559" dur="2.201">feminists but based on what data they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2794.48" dur="2.2">going</text>
  <text start="2794.76" dur="4.41">accidentally target real black feminists</text>
  <text start="2796.68" dur="5.64">in the process so are you saying that</text>
  <text start="2799.17" dur="6.03">this is useful as like a disruption</text>
  <text start="2802.32" dur="4.47">mechanism okay all right once they see</text>
  <text start="2805.2" dur="6.9">what arguing it was used during</text>
  <text start="2806.79" dur="7.59">gamergate let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go there</text>
  <text start="2812.1" dur="3.6">then because I don&amp;#39;t know that many</text>
  <text start="2814.38" dur="3.72">people in the audience here are gonna</text>
  <text start="2815.7" dur="4.44">know about gamergate I mean I only you</text>
  <text start="2818.1" dur="4.77">know know just a little bit about it it</text>
  <text start="2820.14" dur="6.75">seemed like it was kind of overblown the</text>
  <text start="2822.87" dur="7.89">something about you know fairness and</text>
  <text start="2826.89" dur="5.78">equity in the gaming programming world I</text>
  <text start="2830.76" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t know tell us about it</text>
  <text start="2832.67" dur="3.27">gamergate is truly the gift that keeps</text>
  <text start="2835.11" dur="8.46">on giving</text>
  <text start="2835.94" dur="9.46">it is an amazingly snitch thing so you</text>
  <text start="2843.57" dur="6.68">can&amp;#39;t talk gamergate if you don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="2845.4" dur="7.98">before chin 4chan is we all know fortune</text>
  <text start="2850.25" dur="6.01">fortune is the opposite of social media</text>
  <text start="2853.38" dur="5.61">what I mean by that is Facebook and</text>
  <text start="2856.26" dur="5.85">Tumblr Twitter these are all competitive</text>
  <text start="2858.99" dur="5.22">games they&amp;#39;re MMORPGs where you are</text>
  <text start="2862.11" dur="4.2">constantly fighting for attention</text>
  <text start="2864.21" dur="5.85">currency and you steal it from other</text>
  <text start="2866.31" dur="6.99">players so as an open source PvP</text>
  <text start="2870.06" dur="5.37">attention game and so that creates</text>
  <text start="2873.3" dur="3.63">different winning strategies you say</text>
  <text start="2875.43" dur="3.33">well I&amp;#39;m going to group together with</text>
  <text start="2876.93" dur="3.81">these people and do podcasts with</text>
  <text start="2878.76" dur="3.54">similar people here&amp;#39;s one strategy to</text>
  <text start="2880.74" dur="4.62">win the attention game we&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="2882.3" dur="5.55">right now other strategies involve going</text>
  <text start="2885.36" dur="4.8">after people who are getting attention</text>
  <text start="2887.85" dur="3.75">but we need to expose them and deny them</text>
  <text start="2890.16" dur="3.15">attention so you have all these</text>
  <text start="2891.6" dur="3.99">different competitive and cooperation</text>
  <text start="2893.31" dur="4.35">strategies that take place in a open</text>

  <text start="3457.45" dur="3.96">whoa and they they just mindlessly do</text>
  <text start="3460.15" dur="2.58">this because that was their conditioning</text>

  <text start="3492.28" dur="7.17">can have the media okay this is good</text>
  <text start="3494.53" dur="6.57">this is fun and by the time that</text>
  <text start="3499.45" dur="3.45">happened between both of those events</text>
  <text start="3501.1" dur="4.41">there were some researchers who were</text>
  <text start="3502.9" dur="4.56">starting to get wise because we were</text>
  <text start="3505.51" dur="4.53">actually stepping on and interfering</text>
  <text start="3507.46" dur="5.91">with the ability to conduct political</text>
  <text start="3510.04" dur="4.98">polling for the elections that were</text>
  <text start="3513.37" dur="3.09">upcoming so we were interfering with</text>
  <text start="3515.02" dur="2.85">their studies we&amp;#39;re interfering with</text>
  <text start="3516.46" dur="2.94">their political stuff because they were</text>
  <text start="3517.87" dur="3.06">like where are these black feminists</text>
  <text start="3519.4" dur="3.54">coming from they don&amp;#39;t know where did</text>
  <text start="3520.93" dur="4.02">they come from or of these people so the</text>
  <text start="3522.94" dur="3.63">metadata was saying one thing but their</text>
  <text start="3524.95" dur="4.74">behavior was doing something else so</text>
  <text start="3526.57" dur="4.74">that was a total mismatch and they were</text>
  <text start="3529.69" dur="3.18">definitely you know sticking out like a</text>
  <text start="3531.31" dur="5.52">sore thumb when you have that type of</text>
  <text start="3532.87" dur="5.79">ability so all the stuff I said about</text>
  <text start="3536.83" dur="4.05">gamergate happens and then when that</text>
  <text start="3538.66" dur="4.53">happens once again this black fake</text>
  <text start="3540.88" dur="6.09">feminist army appears out of nowhere and</text>
  <text start="3543.19" dur="6.62">starts pushing hard they start pushing</text>
  <text start="3546.97" dur="5.49">what&amp;#39;s known as operation shield where</text>
  <text start="3549.81" dur="4.36">they start saying you they start</text>
  <text start="3552.46" dur="5.76">pretending to be minorities saying that</text>
  <text start="3554.17" dur="6.33">you can&amp;#39;t hide behind us so usually what</text>
  <text start="3558.22" dur="4.23">a American white liberal is known to do</text>
  <text start="3560.5" dur="3.24">is they tend to hide behind minorities</text>
  <text start="3562.45" dur="3.6">and use them as human shields for</text>
  <text start="3563.74" dur="4.2">political arguments right in this case</text>
  <text start="3566.05" dur="4.29">they were pre-empting that saying you</text>
  <text start="3567.94" dur="4.05">can&amp;#39;t hide behind us this is in a sense</text>
  <text start="3570.34" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re saying this is primarily the</text>
  <text start="3571.99" dur="5.58">white woman thing you&amp;#39;re overreacting</text>
  <text start="3574.6" dur="4.47">here ridiculously and that in turn</text>
  <text start="3577.57" dur="3.24">actually took a bunch of like actual</text>
  <text start="3579.07" dur="2.52">minority gamers and they&amp;#39;re like yeah I</text>
  <text start="3580.81" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t want to be your human shield</text>
  <text start="3581.59" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous they were like the</text>
  <text start="3584.5" dur="5.25">front of the line the spike of it and</text>
  <text start="3586.81" dur="6.09">then the whole thing it was exploded</text>
  <text start="3589.75" dur="5.94">gamers were constantly on like Kotaku in</text>
  <text start="3592.9" dur="4.77">action there in V there are on other</text>
  <text start="3595.69" dur="3.929">boards on Reddit they were communicating</text>
  <text start="3597.67" dur="4.59">private they were sending email</text>
  <text start="3599.619" dur="4.591">campaigns they were working on Gawker I</text>
  <text start="3602.26" dur="5.819">mean they were doing everything they</text>
  <text start="3604.21" dur="8.28">could to just level a full-blown culture</text>
  <text start="3608.079" dur="6.361">war against what was effectively Zoe</text>
  <text start="3612.49" dur="4.589">Quinn and her enablers and their</text>
  <text start="3614.44" dur="4.379">handlers and her backers and this is a</text>
  <text start="3617.079" dur="3.27">long story I&amp;#39;m trying to do my best to</text>
  <text start="3618.819" dur="1.951">make it entertaining I&amp;#39;m gonna wrap it</text>
  <text start="3620.349" dur="3.361">up</text>
  <text start="3620.77" dur="5.069">it&amp;#39;s then finally hits the tipping point</text>
  <text start="3623.71" dur="3.359">where all the journalists every time a</text>
  <text start="3625.839" dur="2.701">journalist takes a look at this match</text>
  <text start="3627.069" dur="3.211">like oh it&amp;#39;s a bunch of racist gamers</text>
  <text start="3628.54" dur="3.38">gamers of racists and and they just they</text>
  <text start="3630.28" dur="3.69">run with that narrative thoughtlessly</text>
  <text start="3631.92" dur="3.76">they got their marching orders</text>
  <text start="3633.97" dur="3.69">you know they&amp;#39;ve did their preliminary</text>
  <text start="3635.68" dur="4.02">analysis they&amp;#39;ve checked the Wikipedia</text>
  <text start="3637.66" dur="3.48">hacking and that&amp;#39;s what it says so I</text>
  <text start="3639.7" dur="4.08">guess we&amp;#39;re gonna run with it so the</text>
  <text start="3641.14" dur="4.679">circular reference circle-jerk happens</text>
  <text start="3643.78" dur="5.579">and they keep running that sort of thing</text>
  <text start="3645.819" dur="6.03">and then this very intelligent very</text>
  <text start="3649.359" dur="4.74">stylish gay guy comes in and says I</text>
  <text start="3651.849" dur="5.401">think gamers are all right and it was my</text>
  <text start="3654.099" dur="4.831">Louie innopolis yeah Milo yeah innopolis</text>
  <text start="3657.25" dur="3.329">and I took a look at him and I took a</text>
  <text start="3658.93" dur="3.75">look at gamergate and I took a look at</text>
  <text start="3660.579" dur="3.631">all my fake black feminists and I took a</text>
  <text start="3662.68" dur="3.899">look at the four Chan&amp;#39;s and I did some</text>
  <text start="3664.21" dur="6.389">like you know the math meme where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3666.579" dur="9.601">just like mine type thing bunch of</text>
  <text start="3670.599" dur="7.921">golden numbers in the sky I&amp;#39;m having</text>
  <text start="3676.18" dur="3.09">that moment and I&amp;#39;m like I can connect</text>
  <text start="3678.52" dur="2.73">this all together</text>
  <text start="3679.27" dur="4.62">I can supercharge this whole fight and</text>
  <text start="3681.25" dur="5.25">so I decided to purchase 20,000 BOTS</text>
  <text start="3683.89" dur="5.4">from Milo yeah innopolis that doubled</text>
  <text start="3686.5" dur="5.19">his follower count to 40,000 which then</text>
  <text start="3689.29" dur="4.5">in turn hacked all the metrics that were</text>
  <text start="3691.69" dur="3.389">being watched by the journalists because</text>
  <text start="3693.79" dur="2.789">they were saying because they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="3695.079" dur="3.661">looking for any type of interaction that</text>
  <text start="3696.579" dur="3.75">has a spike of activity whose do type</text>
  <text start="3698.74" dur="3.869">gamergate and all of a sudden boom</text>
  <text start="3700.329" dur="3.871">followers and this is 2014 when they</text>
  <text start="3702.609" dur="3.601">didn&amp;#39;t have really good anti-bot detect</text>
  <text start="3704.2" dur="4.32">how many thousands of dollars did that</text>
  <text start="3706.21" dur="3.56">cost you Patrick oh wow well is the best</text>
  <text start="3708.52" dur="6.53">fifty dollars I ever spent</text>
  <text start="3709.77" dur="8.349">[Laughter]</text>
  <text start="3715.05" dur="4.81">what real quick did Milo know that you</text>
  <text start="3718.119" dur="4.5">were purchasing these bonds for him or</text>
  <text start="3719.86" dur="4.41">did you just said I&amp;#39;m gonna buy these</text>
  <text start="3722.619" dur="2.541">pots for you in which he said please</text>
  <text start="3724.27" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="3725.16" dur="3.91">and I said I&amp;#39;m going to do it now my</text>
  <text start="3727.63" dur="3.78">bots were different they weren&amp;#39;t dumbots</text>
  <text start="3729.07" dur="4.71">they were actually like half human half</text>
  <text start="3731.41" dur="5.97">BOTS in Southeast Asia so they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="3733.78" dur="5.52">okay so they evaded everything that</text>
  <text start="3737.38" dur="3.57">doubled his follower count because it</text>
  <text start="3739.3" dur="4.08">looked organic and human they had good</text>
  <text start="3740.95" dur="4.68">metadata about them and so what happened</text>
  <text start="3743.38" dur="3.57">is because of that you see Milo just</text>
  <text start="3745.63" dur="3.45">trending doing nothing mentioned</text>
  <text start="3746.95" dur="4.86">something gamergate if you&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="3749.08" dur="4.47">his statistics you looking at your pet</text>

  <text start="3758.44" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s when Bannon gets involved Bannon</text>
  <text start="3761.86" dur="5.64">comes down and hand selects Milo from</text>
  <text start="3764.41" dur="4.709">Olympia and pulls him into Olympia and</text>
  <text start="3767.5" dur="5.07">gives him the training the rigger room</text>
  <text start="3769.119" dur="6.691">all the funding the now tremendous</text>

  <text start="3787.26" dur="4.599">yeah there&amp;#39;s a lot I mean this is a lot</text>
  <text start="3789.67" dur="7.41">this is like a whole I&amp;#39;m done packing it</text>
  <text start="3791.859" dur="8.041">yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s so okay so so prior to</text>
  <text start="3797.08" dur="6.24">gamergate you were just very active on</text>
  <text start="3799.9" dur="6.48">the chance or you were working in an</text>
  <text start="3803.32" dur="5.61">industry which gave you the skills</text>
  <text start="3806.38" dur="5.88">necessary to do this stuff a little bit</text>
  <text start="3808.93" dur="5.49">of both I was I had I had wrote a book</text>
  <text start="3812.26" dur="3.69">about AI warfare in 2005 and I never</text>
  <text start="3814.42" dur="2.91">published and that is literally its own</text>
  <text start="3815.95" dur="3">conversation I&amp;#39;m just gonna end it there</text>
  <text start="3817.33" dur="4.529">that&amp;#39;s fine we can talk about that one</text>
  <text start="3818.95" dur="5.1">later right but I wanted to test the</text>
  <text start="3821.859" dur="5.071">theories in my book and who can do it</text>
  <text start="3824.05" dur="5.309">was well online was the internet was</text>
  <text start="3826.93" dur="3.99">this never-ending sociological</text>
  <text start="3829.359" dur="4.081">experiment where you can actually all</text>
  <text start="3830.92" dur="4.14">right well if people think this do they</text>
  <text start="3833.44" dur="3.3">act on that belief if people don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3835.06" dur="3.75">this do they act on this belief and that</text>
  <text start="3836.74" dur="5.369">was poking and prodding there&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="3838.81" dur="5.52">I have a whole history of my experiments</text>
  <text start="3842.109" dur="3.961">of just anybody&amp;#39;s willing to do</text>
  <text start="3844.33" dur="4.29">research can go to abusive oracle at</text>
  <text start="3846.07" dur="3.72">blogspot.com back in 2011 when I was</text>
  <text start="3848.62" dur="2.94">training all this stuff and been</text>
  <text start="3849.79" dur="4.86">practicing and working out in my head</text>
  <text start="3851.56" dur="5.37">Wow so I I left a very long trail of</text>
  <text start="3854.65" dur="3.75">research that led me to all of these</text>
  <text start="3856.93" dur="2.91">actions that I was finally able to do</text>
  <text start="3858.4" dur="3.48">this wasn&amp;#39;t just I woke up one day and</text>
  <text start="3859.84" dur="6.3">like oh I did things and this was this</text>
  <text start="3861.88" dur="6.33">was a long-term complex analysis and</text>
  <text start="3866.14" dur="5.13">just dedication to it because the</text>
  <text start="3868.21" dur="5.13">internet had not happened before it that</text>
  <text start="3871.27" dur="5.34">that sort of thing didn&amp;#39;t exist so this</text>
  <text start="3873.34" dur="5.16">was like this was the front lines of how</text>
  <text start="3876.61" dur="4.56">humans are going to interact with one</text>
  <text start="3878.5" dur="4.23">another for the rest of time so you</text>
  <text start="3881.17" dur="5.49">probably want to get a good handle on it</text>
  <text start="3882.73" dur="6.33">and that was so I a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="3886.66" dur="4.5">asking if you have your own channel if</text>
  <text start="3889.06" dur="5.46">people can follow you like on Twitter or</text>
  <text start="3891.16" dur="4.8">I have cult state com</text>
  <text start="3894.52" dur="6">I&amp;#39;m better with words if you can believe</text>
  <text start="3895.96" dur="6">that so cult stay is it cult - state</text>
  <text start="3900.52" dur="6.06">because I tried to type in cult state</text>
  <text start="3901.96" dur="7.32">calm and it gave me a 503 know - okay</text>
  <text start="3906.58" dur="5.79">just cult state calm</text>
  <text start="3909.28" dur="3.84">you should load up super fast I coded it</text>
  <text start="3912.37" dur="4.23">all myself</text>
  <text start="3913.12" dur="5.37">okay all right sweet yeah if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3916.6" dur="4.02">bunch of stuff musings a lot of</text>
  <text start="3918.49" dur="6.87">geopolitical analysis AI warfare</text>
  <text start="3920.62" dur="8.21">analysis I there on what I found is</text>
  <text start="3925.36" dur="5.85">people who are interested in this stuff</text>
  <text start="3928.83" dur="4.33">they get demeaned as conspiracy</text>
  <text start="3931.21" dur="3.27">theorists and that&amp;#39;s not true what</text>
  <text start="3933.16" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re entertaining</text>
  <text start="3934.48" dur="4.92">the possibilities and what I like to do</text>
  <text start="3937.48" dur="4.02">is sort of give guidance on how to</text>
  <text start="3939.4" dur="3.66">resolve some of the complex of those</text>
  <text start="3941.5" dur="4.77">possibilities into something more</text>
  <text start="3943.06" dur="4.83">digestible all right cool there&amp;#39;s a ton</text>
  <text start="3946.27" dur="4.2">of other questions from earlier before</text>
  <text start="3947.89" dur="5.04">we went into gamergate people that there</text>
  <text start="3950.47" dur="5.82">was a super chest that we wanted to go</text>
  <text start="3952.93" dur="5.25">from okay so people were asking when you</text>
  <text start="3956.29" dur="4.86">were thinking of searching something how</text>
  <text start="3958.18" dur="4.89">does that get into what is recommended</text>
  <text start="3961.15" dur="3.36">for you is that a thing</text>
  <text start="3963.07" dur="4.08">yes that&amp;#39;s a thing so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3964.51" dur="5.94">reading your brainwaves that technology</text>
  <text start="3967.15" dur="4.89">is not in your phone they don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="3970.45" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s more expensive because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3972.04" dur="4.95">lot going on in your brain and trying to</text>
  <text start="3974.98" dur="3.18">narrow down precisely what your brain is</text>
  <text start="3976.99" dur="2.46">doing it</text>
  <text start="3978.16" dur="3.63">is a bit of an expensive endeavor</text>
  <text start="3979.45" dur="4.59">instead you just watched the behavior</text>
  <text start="3981.79" dur="4.38">because the behavior is literally the</text>
  <text start="3984.04" dur="3.48">output of what your brain is thinking so</text>
  <text start="3986.17" dur="3.09">you watch the behavior so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3987.52" dur="4.23">sitting there on your phone and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3989.26" dur="5.1">like I&amp;#39;m thinking about alligators and</text>
  <text start="3991.75" dur="4.17">then suddenly alligators appear well it</text>
  <text start="3994.36" dur="4.47">turns out that when you think about</text>
  <text start="3995.92" dur="4.68">alligators you have a behavioral tick</text>
  <text start="3998.83" dur="5.7">you have a poker face when you think</text>
  <text start="4000.6" dur="6.15">about alligators unbelievable and it</text>
  <text start="4004.53" dur="3.75">shows up in accelerometers it shows up</text>
  <text start="4006.75" dur="3.42">in your Wi-Fi it shows up in your</text>
  <text start="4008.28" dur="4.83">battery power it shows up in all these</text>
  <text start="4010.17" dur="5.28">other all these inferences of your</text>
  <text start="4013.11" dur="5.07">behavior you have a poker face basically</text>
  <text start="4015.45" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s detecting it so another person</text>
  <text start="4018.18" dur="4.62">said this kind of goes along with that</text>
  <text start="4020.1" dur="4.65">sitting next to a friend you&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="4022.8" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s probably I don&amp;#39;t they weren&amp;#39;t into</text>
  <text start="4024.75" dur="4.29">detail about conversation or anything</text>
  <text start="4026.19" dur="4.47">like that obviously has voice</text>
  <text start="4029.04" dur="3.36">recognition and everything like that</text>
  <text start="4030.66" dur="2.91">so obviously probably the same thing if</text>
  <text start="4032.4" dur="2.4">someone of your friend is sitting beside</text>
  <text start="4033.57" dur="2.97">you on the couch they&amp;#39;re researching</text>
  <text start="4034.8" dur="4.34">something you may be thinking if</text>
  <text start="4036.54" dur="7.05">something and it pops up on their phone</text>
  <text start="4039.14" dur="8.56">same thing same thing so that is when</text>
  <text start="4043.59" dur="7.41">you are doing the search the search</text>
  <text start="4047.7" dur="6.21">engine knows the other person is there I</text>
  <text start="4051" dur="6.54">hold on it&amp;#39;s not the search engine it is</text>
  <text start="4053.91" dur="5.04">the retarget and the ad exchanges I want</text>
  <text start="4057.54" dur="3.33">I like to be specific about who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4058.95" dur="3.99">responsible here so those people are</text>
  <text start="4060.87" dur="4.14">constantly gathering the data and then</text>
  <text start="4062.94" dur="3.57">placing their bets saying that I think</text>
  <text start="4065.01" dur="2.79">because this person&amp;#39;s in this room with</text>
  <text start="4066.51" dur="2.67">this person and these are the behaviors</text>
  <text start="4067.8" dur="2.67">and that&amp;#39;s a tic that they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="4069.18" dur="3.2">is what they&amp;#39;re actually thinking about</text>
  <text start="4070.47" dur="4.32">so it&amp;#39;s an attempt to be predictive</text>
  <text start="4072.38" dur="3.94">using all of those factors I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4074.79" dur="3.18">true so why a lot of people get ads</text>
  <text start="4076.32" dur="3.78">saying hey do you want to get like</text>
  <text start="4077.97" dur="3.96">pregnancy supplies and they&amp;#39;re like what</text>
  <text start="4080.1" dur="9.81">the heck I&amp;#39;m not pregnant and then we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="4081.93" dur="9.09">find out yeah you see I&amp;#39;m still waiting</text>
  <text start="4089.91" dur="2.85">for our generation to get in there like</text>
  <text start="4091.02" dur="4.73">40s and 50s and you just start seeing</text>
  <text start="4092.76" dur="5.28">the divorce ads it&amp;#39;s gonna be beautiful</text>
  <text start="4095.75" dur="6.04">hey so here&amp;#39;s another question it says</text>
  <text start="4098.04" dur="6.45">could we retrain the four amai to become</text>
  <text start="4101.79" dur="4.41">an even playing field someone&amp;#39;s asking</text>
  <text start="4104.49" dur="4.02">all the right questions whoever that</text>
  <text start="4106.2" dur="5.4">person is give that man 20 internets he</text>
  <text start="4108.51" dur="3.48">is correct or she that is exactly the</text>
  <text start="4111.6" dur="1.65">way</text>
  <text start="4111.99" dur="4.68">you need to think about this sort of</text>
  <text start="4113.25" dur="6.42">stuff hyper parameters are a tough bias</text>
  <text start="4116.67" dur="7.59">to go against it is worth exploring how</text>
  <text start="4119.67" dur="6.3">the the authoritative Mis rating and the</text>
  <text start="4124.26" dur="5.49">Raider system works you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="4125.97" dur="7.62">delve into the the finer large points of</text>
  <text start="4129.75" dur="5.91">how this whole coordinated dance works</text>
  <text start="4133.59" dur="3.96">and you can identify the weakness if you</text>
  <text start="4135.66" dur="3.51">critically evaluate it so if you look at</text>
  <text start="4137.55" dur="5.91">the authoritative this these journalists</text>
  <text start="4139.17" dur="5.84">get you can possibly to be fair I</text>
  <text start="4143.46" dur="3.78">haven&amp;#39;t found a way to crack that oh</text>
  <text start="4145.01" dur="3.79">there&amp;#39;s also another problem here is</text>
  <text start="4147.24" dur="3.63">that now is that they&amp;#39;re hyper</text>
  <text start="4148.8" dur="4.26">parameters that are biasing it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="4150.87" dur="4.5">weighted hyper parameters so the thing</text>
  <text start="4153.06" dur="6.39">is is that the authoritative nough score</text>
  <text start="4155.37" dur="5.79">is live is boosting like CNN and so not</text>
  <text start="4159.45" dur="4.02">only did they get first crack at it but</text>
  <text start="4161.16" dur="5.16">they also get a weighted first crack at</text>
  <text start="4163.47" dur="5.19">it so even if you&amp;#39;re able to inject your</text>
  <text start="4166.32" dur="3.96">story at the 40mm the thing is is that</text>
  <text start="4168.66" dur="4.32">you don&amp;#39;t have the authoritative this</text>
  <text start="4170.28" dur="4.77">score you know that CNN does or the New</text>
  <text start="4172.98" dur="3.9">York Times or The Washington Post that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4175.05" dur="4.5">right so even if you did decide to do in</text>
  <text start="4176.88" dur="3.6">front run on it I&amp;#39;d like 359 or 358 is</text>
  <text start="4179.55" dur="3.93">still not gonna work as the</text>
  <text start="4180.48" dur="5.43">authoritative miss so how do you beat</text>
  <text start="4183.48" dur="4.35">authoritative nough status the question</text>
  <text start="4185.91" dur="3.99">and I think your audience is already on</text>
  <text start="4187.83" dur="3.45">the right thing and I do not like to</text>
  <text start="4189.9" dur="2.85">stand in the way of good people doing</text>
  <text start="4191.28" dur="3.66">good things so if you guys come up with</text>
  <text start="4192.75" dur="6.63">anything by all means just share it and</text>
  <text start="4194.94" dur="6.72">work it out perfect I would like to</text>
  <text start="4199.38" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;ve been going over this for a while a</text>
  <text start="4201.66" dur="3.66">lot of people but I you know I threw out</text>
  <text start="4203.49" dur="4.38">tweets out there that we need to start</text>
  <text start="4205.32" dur="4.44">that we were going to talk about Isaac</text>
  <text start="4207.87" dur="5.99">Cappy is that okay that we go into this</text>
  <text start="4209.76" dur="7.32">now or what do we want to do with that</text>
  <text start="4213.86" dur="11.8">you guys talk about mr. caffee and I</text>
  <text start="4217.08" dur="9.9">will chime in when I can well I happened</text>
  <text start="4225.66" dur="4.77">right so new things have come to light</text>
  <text start="4226.98" dur="5.49">this well yeah I mean all of the</text>
  <text start="4230.43" dur="3.69">information that Phoenix enigma&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="4232.47" dur="4.74">presented on the show the other night</text>
  <text start="4234.12" dur="5.82">was pretty eye-opening I mean it was it</text>
  <text start="4237.21" dur="5.58">was kind of subtle I mean just what he</text>
  <text start="4239.94" dur="5.489">really brought forth was the occult</text>
  <text start="4242.79" dur="6.48">aspects surrounding Isaac&amp;#39;s dad</text>
  <text start="4245.429" dur="4.471">and it calls into question exactly what</text>
  <text start="4249.27" dur="3.24">happened</text>
  <text start="4249.9" dur="4.47">one thing Patrick I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="4252.51" dur="6.18">were aware of this but there was someone</text>
  <text start="4254.37" dur="7.77">that Phoenix spoke to that was with</text>
  <text start="4258.69" dur="6.6">Isaac and Isaac said that he was being</text>
  <text start="4262.14" dur="6.8">bombarded with like voice to skull</text>
  <text start="4265.29" dur="7.86">technology he was being hit with</text>
  <text start="4268.94" dur="6.73">microwaves essentially pounding music in</text>
  <text start="4273.15" dur="5.16">his head 24 hours a day and they went</text>
  <text start="4275.67" dur="5.64">around a corner and all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="4278.31" dur="5.19">car filled up with in the air tonight by</text>
  <text start="4281.31" dur="3.84">Phil Collins and they could both hear it</text>
  <text start="4283.5" dur="6.84">and she could hear it but it was only</text>
  <text start="4285.15" dur="7.56">for a moment but it it showed her what</text>
  <text start="4290.34" dur="5.1">he had been going through and it just</text>
  <text start="4292.71" dur="7.86">kind of informed the his State of Mind</text>
  <text start="4295.44" dur="10.23">there at the end it was I personally</text>
  <text start="4300.57" dur="6.6">think that he was he was driven he was</text>
  <text start="4305.67" dur="4.14">everything that he was doing everything</text>
  <text start="4307.17" dur="5.31">that he was saying it was a great threat</text>
  <text start="4309.81" dur="5.28">to all of the people that he was trying</text>
  <text start="4312.48" dur="5.4">to expose and I think that one of the</text>
  <text start="4315.09" dur="5.49">things that that these people will do is</text>
  <text start="4317.88" dur="4.29">if they can&amp;#39;t completely discredit you</text>
  <text start="4320.58" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;ll do what they can to discredit</text>
  <text start="4322.17" dur="7.2">you but if that doesn&amp;#39;t work then they</text>
  <text start="4324.57" dur="7.589">will drive you insane and there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="4329.37" dur="5.07">of people and a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="4332.159" dur="5.221">wondered you know whether Isaac was even</text>
  <text start="4334.44" dur="5.39">really gone you know it was shocking to</text>
  <text start="4337.38" dur="6.45">me I&amp;#39;m sure that it was shocking to you</text>
  <text start="4339.83" dur="9.82">it was the last thing that I expected</text>
  <text start="4343.83" dur="8.76">and the the information the evidence</text>
  <text start="4349.65" dur="5.64">from the police report from the full</text>
  <text start="4352.59" dur="5.64">investigative file that he was able to</text>
  <text start="4355.29" dur="4.65">get from I believe it was the County PD</text>
  <text start="4358.23" dur="3.48">and then also the state police were</text>
  <text start="4359.94" dur="3.549">involved because it happened on a</text>
  <text start="4361.71" dur="7.119">highway</text>
  <text start="4363.489" dur="9.36">I essentially verified that Isaac is is</text>
  <text start="4368.829" dur="5.971">not here anymore you know and I</text>
  <text start="4372.849" dur="3.12">personally I haven&amp;#39;t I haven&amp;#39;t looked at</text>
  <text start="4374.8" dur="2.73">any of the crime-scene photos that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4375.969" dur="4.11">true too traumatic I wouldn&amp;#39;t what</text>
  <text start="4377.53" dur="5.04">happened to the body is the body like I</text>
  <text start="4380.079" dur="5.37">believe he was cremated if I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="4382.57" dur="5.73">mistaken there was a funeral there was a</text>
  <text start="4385.449" dur="5.011">funeral for the family and it wasn&amp;#39;t all</text>
  <text start="4388.3" dur="6.569">that long ago I mean relatively speaking</text>
  <text start="4390.46" dur="7.039">but he you know either fell off the</text>
  <text start="4394.869" dur="4.741">bridge or was pushed off the bridge</text>
  <text start="4397.499" dur="5.08">Patrick I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re aware but</text>
  <text start="4399.61" dur="6.929">there was a guard for the army base</text>
  <text start="4402.579" dur="6.091">right there by where he died who was</text>
  <text start="4406.539" dur="6.031">driving on his way to work and he had a</text>
  <text start="4408.67" dur="7.679">dash cam and he cost yeah I thought that</text>
  <text start="4412.57" dur="6.029">that was that was pretty odd the song</text>
  <text start="4416.349" dur="5.37">that was playing wallet when he drove by</text>
  <text start="4418.599" dur="7.08">when I first saw that still from the</text>
  <text start="4421.719" dur="6.661">video I thought that some asshat was</text>
  <text start="4425.679" dur="4.86">making a joke you know had taken a</text>
  <text start="4428.38" dur="5.1">picture of Isaac and and placed it</text>
  <text start="4430.539" dur="6.48">sitting there on the guardrail because</text>
  <text start="4433.48" dur="5.46">he you know I mean like you could say he</text>
  <text start="4437.019" dur="4.591">looked peaceful but to me he looked like</text>
  <text start="4438.94" dur="4.409">he was already gone you know I mean the</text>
  <text start="4441.61" dur="7.489">way that he was sitting the way his</text>
  <text start="4443.349" dur="9.12">hands were placed he was very pale and</text>
  <text start="4449.099" dur="7.091">just perhaps because of the the effect</text>
  <text start="4452.469" dur="5.52">of the fisheye lens going by him there</text>
  <text start="4456.19" dur="4.559">was a bit of distortion behind him there</text>
  <text start="4457.989" dur="4.65">was some pixelation behind his head so</text>
  <text start="4460.749" dur="4.261">you know many people who only saw that</text>
  <text start="4462.639" dur="6.031">image they thought you know that well</text>
  <text start="4465.01" dur="5.25">this is fake as well you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4468.67" dur="3.27">know to be quite honest with you the</text>
  <text start="4470.26" dur="5.759">interview left me with more questions</text>
  <text start="4471.94" dur="8.549">than than answers you know because if</text>
  <text start="4476.019" dur="6.691">there is an occult nature to all of</text>
  <text start="4480.489" dur="5.911">these deaths you know and there&amp;#39;s stuff</text>
  <text start="4482.71" dur="5.989">with Tom Hanks and you know just so many</text>
  <text start="4486.4" dur="5.61">so many different points you know like</text>
  <text start="4488.699" dur="6.55">different numbers appearing you know</text>
  <text start="4492.01" dur="4.95">anytime you have you know a tragic death</text>
  <text start="4495.249" dur="5.671">like this</text>
  <text start="4496.96" dur="7.12">the first thing I thought was is it</text>
  <text start="4500.92" dur="5.5">evidence of an occult ritual or is it</text>
  <text start="4504.08" dur="9.63">evidence that we&amp;#39;re living in a computer</text>
  <text start="4506.42" dur="9.93">simulation great question you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4513.71" dur="6.57">never spoken about Cappy before on a</text>
  <text start="4516.35" dur="6.42">public medium well that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="4520.28" dur="4.7">I&amp;#39;ve left hints and clues and a couple</text>
  <text start="4522.77" dur="5.85">people found things that are good I</text>
  <text start="4524.98" dur="7.51">speak a lot in anagrams anagrams can</text>
  <text start="4528.62" dur="5.67">evade a lot of AI they have a way of you</text>
  <text start="4532.49" dur="3.39">can say one thing but if you reshuffle</text>
  <text start="4534.29" dur="4.05">the letters it&amp;#39;ll say something else if</text>
  <text start="4535.88" dur="4.17">you know where to look you can find what</text>
  <text start="4538.34" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m talking about but you got to look</text>
  <text start="4540.05" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;m not gonna hand it to you because I</text>
  <text start="4541.73" dur="6.36">just can&amp;#39;t but what I can tell you about</text>
  <text start="4544.73" dur="6.33">this stuff is that you have an entire</text>
  <text start="4548.09" dur="6.42">army of people who are very very</text>
  <text start="4551.06" dur="6.12">interested in the events of Isaac a pea</text>
  <text start="4554.51" dur="5.94">that led up to it were part of it and</text>
  <text start="4557.18" dur="7.38">then around his very very suspicious</text>
  <text start="4560.45" dur="5.61">death there is a very large amount of</text>
  <text start="4564.56" dur="3.54">people who are researching that and</text>
  <text start="4566.06" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re covering a lot of</text>
  <text start="4568.1" dur="6.87">data they&amp;#39;re generating a lot of data it</text>
  <text start="4573.26" dur="4.11">is important to understand how to</text>
  <text start="4574.97" dur="4.41">extract knowledge from data because not</text>
  <text start="4577.37" dur="3.78">all data is equal you have to be able to</text>
  <text start="4579.38" dur="3.24">find the data that is actionable that is</text>
  <text start="4581.15" dur="3.27">pointing in the right direction it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4582.62" dur="3.96">giving you exactly what it is and</text>
  <text start="4584.42" dur="4.05">building the context because if you</text>
  <text start="4586.58" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t do that then all the data yet</text>
  <text start="4588.47" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;re accumulating is gonna give you</text>
  <text start="4590.15" dur="4.26">the wrong context which itself isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4592.88" dur="3.39">that bad because that&amp;#39;ll force you to</text>

  <text start="4679.27" dur="6.33">you know it was all about that when it</text>
  <text start="4681.91" dur="6.06">was taking place you know I mean with I</text>
  <text start="4685.6" dur="6.93">I brought this up before about the the</text>
  <text start="4687.97" dur="6.93">the dead man which like that video I I</text>
  <text start="4692.53" dur="4.23">want to know where that&amp;#39;s from I have a</text>
  <text start="4694.9" dur="3.9">lot of questions with that I&amp;#39;ve yet to</text>
  <text start="4696.76" dur="4.91">see I haven&amp;#39;t looked at the footage of</text>
  <text start="4698.8" dur="6.6">him on the bridge anything like that but</text>
  <text start="4701.67" dur="6.01">for people who besmirched his character</text>
  <text start="4705.4" dur="4.98">without knowing him I would suggest not</text>
  <text start="4707.68" dur="4.5">doing that because imagine if that was</text>
  <text start="4710.38" dur="3.9">someone in your family or someone you</text>
  <text start="4712.18" dur="3.57">knew and they were doing that to you you</text>
  <text start="4714.28" dur="3.23">know I&amp;#39;ve seen it a couple times in the</text>
  <text start="4715.75" dur="5.13">chat it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not right to do</text>
  <text start="4717.51" dur="4.81">that&amp;#39;s just very negative very low vibes</text>
  <text start="4720.88" dur="4.53">so just don&amp;#39;t do that you didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="4722.32" dur="6.66">him obviously Patrick knew him all three</text>
  <text start="4725.41" dur="5.1">of you knew him and you know that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="4728.98" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s disrespectful to do that so just</text>
  <text start="4730.51" dur="5.31">let&amp;#39;s just keep that out of the chat I</text>
  <text start="4732.55" dur="5.49">found this guy I assume that he was a</text>
  <text start="4735.82" dur="2.46">patriot he was doing the right thing you</text>
  <text start="4738.04" dur="4.08">know</text>
  <text start="4738.28" dur="6.15">yes so yeah and for that I am thankful</text>
  <text start="4742.12" dur="3.579">and I&amp;#39;m grateful for what he&amp;#39;s done you</text>
  <text start="4744.43" dur="3.249">know</text>
  <text start="4745.699" dur="5.341">no one should have to go out like that</text>
  <text start="4747.679" dur="8.461">obviously he was of high importance he</text>
  <text start="4751.04" dur="8.1">was a threat to the darkness and again</text>
  <text start="4756.14" dur="6.74">show respect for those who risk it all</text>
  <text start="4759.14" dur="8.3">that&amp;#39;s what I want to just add on there</text>
  <text start="4762.88" dur="7.18">yeah you know you got to think about the</text>
  <text start="4767.44" dur="5.89">everything that he gave up you know I</text>
  <text start="4770.06" dur="5.85">mean he he went from having one life to</text>
  <text start="4773.33" dur="5.94">in an in an instant completely changing</text>
  <text start="4775.91" dur="6.059">it and you know I mean I think that a</text>
  <text start="4779.27" dur="5.46">lot of people were suspicious because of</text>
  <text start="4781.969" dur="5.281">that but I mean when you actually spoke</text>
  <text start="4784.73" dur="4.92">with Isaac it was so obvious where his</text>
  <text start="4787.25" dur="4.62">heart was and the type of person that he</text>
  <text start="4789.65" dur="4.26">was that doesn&amp;#39;t always translate when</text>
  <text start="4791.87" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;re looking at someone&amp;#39;s periscope</text>
  <text start="4793.91" dur="5.7">you know he had a very particular type</text>
  <text start="4796.94" dur="5.009">of persona you know he had to project</text>
  <text start="4799.61" dur="3.72">one thing to the world and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="4801.949" dur="7.201">saying he was much different behind the</text>
  <text start="4803.33" dur="8.01">scenes but I he was doing what he knew</text>
  <text start="4809.15" dur="7.11">how to do he was a performer you know</text>
  <text start="4811.34" dur="7.68">and so I I think that one of the things</text>
  <text start="4816.26" dur="5.55">I hate about the Internet is that veil</text>
  <text start="4819.02" dur="5.73">of anonymity it turns people into</text>
  <text start="4821.81" dur="4.83">monsters more often than not you know</text>
  <text start="4824.75" dur="3.449">and I think 4chan you know I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4826.64" dur="3.24">an excellent indicator of that but</text>
  <text start="4828.199" dur="3.211">because everybody&amp;#39;s anonymous you know</text>
  <text start="4829.88" dur="3.87">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you say really</text>
  <text start="4831.41" dur="4.17">you know but when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="4833.75" dur="5.46">person who&amp;#39;s putting yourself out there</text>
  <text start="4835.58" dur="4.5">and even if you don&amp;#39;t believe what</text>
  <text start="4839.21" dur="4.38">people are saying</text>
  <text start="4840.08" dur="6.45">it can be very spiritually demoralizing</text>
  <text start="4843.59" dur="6.03">to see that crap rolling through you</text>
  <text start="4846.53" dur="6.66">know day after day and if you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="4849.62" dur="5.579">other elements that are you know working</text>
  <text start="4853.19" dur="4.65">against you at the exact same time I</text>
  <text start="4855.199" dur="5.821">think that it can it can build up over</text>
  <text start="4857.84" dur="8.72">time and it can really affect a person -</text>
  <text start="4861.02" dur="9.24">um - to give a picture of context here</text>
  <text start="4866.56" dur="5.59">making the transition from Palin around</text>
  <text start="4870.26" dur="7.02">the well-connected and Hollywood as he</text>

  <text start="5074.78" dur="6.78">cappy&amp;#39;s sort of flaw in the way that he</text>
  <text start="5077.57" dur="7.98">did his operations he was an entertainer</text>
  <text start="5081.56" dur="7.23">first when you&amp;#39;re an entertainer there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5085.55" dur="6.12">a psychological predisposition on your</text>

  <text start="5091.67" dur="7.11">you like to make people happy or you</text>
  <text start="5095.81" dur="4.68">want to nullify any conflict or or you</text>
  <text start="5098.78" dur="6.44">want to have kind of like act as a</text>
  <text start="5100.49" dur="7.95">diplomat in the way right so people</text>
  <text start="5105.22" dur="8.1">pleasers or at least people with the</text>
  <text start="5108.44" dur="8.28">behavior of a of a people-pleaser they</text>
  <text start="5113.32" dur="10.12">know how to attract the eyes they know</text>
  <text start="5116.72" dur="8.52">how to bring people and invite them into</text>
  <text start="5123.44" dur="3.51">a story and they know how to tell that</text>
  <text start="5125.24" dur="3.48">story and they know how to make it</text>
  <text start="5126.95" dur="3.27">compelling and they learn these tricks</text>
  <text start="5128.72" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s what makes a good politician you</text>
  <text start="5130.22" dur="3.84">know what makes a good salesperson and</text>
  <text start="5132.59" dur="4.02">occasionally for most industries</text>
  <text start="5134.06" dur="4.71">actually makes good leaders because you</text>
  <text start="5136.61" dur="6.59">have to manage so many different tribes</text>
  <text start="5138.77" dur="4.43">of people and people possessed</text>
  <text start="5145.61" dur="4.39">it depends how far into it you go</text>
  <text start="5148.17" dur="3.24">because all of us have a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="5150" dur="3.12">people-pleaser in us we&amp;#39;re not all</text>
  <text start="5151.41" dur="3.51">stodgy people beating up everyone who</text>
  <text start="5153.12" dur="3.18">disagrees with us we have a little bit</text>
  <text start="5154.92" dur="3.45">of these traits in this as well but some</text>
  <text start="5156.3" dur="3.629">people go really off the charts with it</text>
  <text start="5158.37" dur="3.119">and then they have to continuously make</text>
  <text start="5159.929" dur="3.511">the selection to reinforce that sort of</text>
  <text start="5161.489" dur="3.091">behavior so to keep going into being a</text>
  <text start="5163.44" dur="3.81">people pleaser and maybe there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="5164.58" dur="4.08">reward for it maybe like hey I my sister</text>
  <text start="5167.25" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t get in a fight with my dad all</text>
  <text start="5168.66" dur="4.53">right no fights right so I love my</text>
  <text start="5170.94" dur="5.7">sister or whatever so these types of</text>
  <text start="5173.19" dur="5.4">things accumulate over time and if you</text>
  <text start="5176.64" dur="3.45">go for the hyper people pleasers which</text>
  <text start="5178.59" dur="3.149">hollywood is completely full of that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5180.09" dur="4.08">what actors really are they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="5181.739" dur="5.011">serve other people&amp;#39;s emotional needs</text>
  <text start="5184.17" dur="6.09">storytelling needs whatever at least</text>
  <text start="5186.75" dur="7.489">psychologically here so so capys flow in</text>
  <text start="5190.26" dur="8.79">that regard was that he knew how to</text>
  <text start="5194.239" dur="7.901">please people in this sense that tell</text>
  <text start="5199.05" dur="6.27">them the story and this was enough of a</text>
  <text start="5202.14" dur="4.74">threat because when you were dealing</text>
  <text start="5205.32" dur="4.95">with all of the people that were</text>
  <text start="5206.88" dur="4.89">listening the capys information these</text>
  <text start="5210.27" dur="2.88">were people who come from walks of life</text>
  <text start="5211.77" dur="4.44">who probably don&amp;#39;t even agree with one</text>
  <text start="5213.15" dur="5.13">another you had people who were queueing</text>
  <text start="5216.21" dur="3.81">on people you had people who were one</text>
  <text start="5218.28" dur="3.57">political affiliation you had people who</text>
  <text start="5220.02" dur="3.39">were in Hollywood you had people who</text>
  <text start="5221.85" dur="3.27">were not in Hollywood you had people who</text>
  <text start="5223.41" dur="3.99">knew not all these all these different</text>
  <text start="5225.12" dur="4.59">walks of life and be a people pleaser</text>
  <text start="5227.4" dur="4.71">attitude can be beneficial if you temper</text>
  <text start="5229.71" dur="4.529">it in that scenario you act excuse me</text>
  <text start="5232.11" dur="3.6">you act as a unifier of tribes you can</text>
  <text start="5234.239" dur="3.96">bring all these desperate parties</text>
  <text start="5235.71" dur="5.12">together and then you can act as one and</text>
  <text start="5238.199" dur="4.921">Cappy was demonstrating that capability</text>
  <text start="5240.83" dur="3.94">very much so which is why they hammered</text>
  <text start="5243.12" dur="7.11">him as hard as he could they hit him in</text>
  <text start="5244.77" dur="10.08">TMZ they hit him in Twitter the Hoffman</text>

  <text start="5257.28" dur="4.5">dismantle his ability to unify these</text>
  <text start="5259.59" dur="4.859">people and to act and it worked it</text>
  <text start="5261.78" dur="6.54">absolutely worked unfortunately yeah I</text>
  <text start="5264.449" dur="5.461">have to agree the reason I brought that</text>

  <text start="5269.91" dur="3.329">know people are asking about on the chat</text>
  <text start="5271.14" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s just like I look at you know Jim</text>
  <text start="5273.239" dur="3.911">Carrey for instance and the erratic</text>
  <text start="5275.82" dur="3.22">behavior</text>
  <text start="5277.15" dur="4.32">that he goes through with drawing these</text>
  <text start="5279.04" dur="9.24">pictures and just being like isolated</text>
  <text start="5281.47" dur="8.31">and it just seems like he&amp;#39;s not I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5288.28" dur="4.56">know the man obviously but it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="5289.78" dur="5.91">like he&amp;#39;s completely shifted into some</text>

  <text start="5298.78" dur="4.38">other people his handlers or whatever</text>
  <text start="5301.06" dur="5.25">but I&amp;#39;d like to give a thought on that</text>
  <text start="5303.16" dur="5.07">yeah just always felt that these people</text>
  <text start="5306.31" dur="5.04">are so disconnected from everyday</text>
  <text start="5308.23" dur="6.09">reality like Patrick was saying they</text>
  <text start="5311.35" dur="6.42">exist in a world which is so far from</text>
  <text start="5314.32" dur="7.11">anything that you or I would be involved</text>
  <text start="5317.77" dur="6.9">in Thomas can you imagine killing</text>

  <text start="5344.38" dur="4.95">do anything for them if you live your</text>
  <text start="5347.59" dur="5.03">life like that and you&amp;#39;ve become a</text>
  <text start="5349.33" dur="7.41">50-year old man and you&amp;#39;re still working</text>
  <text start="5352.62" dur="7.39">imagine what type of an emotional</text>

  <text start="5360.01" dur="4.65">one has ever told him no he&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="5361.6" dur="5.54">Jim Carrey is probably essentially you</text>
  <text start="5364.66" dur="6.03">know emotionally an eight-year-old boy</text>
  <text start="5367.14" dur="5.44">okay maybe an 18 year old boy because</text>
  <text start="5370.69" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s when he got famous or whatever</text>
  <text start="5372.58" dur="5.82">but he they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>

  <text start="5391.66" dur="3.93">different for you I mean yeah but the</text>
  <text start="5393.91" dur="5.49">reason I said say that is because a</text>
  <text start="5395.59" dur="5.64">quarter of his life he was broke he was</text>
  <text start="5399.4" dur="5.22">completely homeless living out of a car</text>

  <text start="5404.62" dur="3.379">the first million dollar I think he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="5406.54" dur="2.57">like wrote a check through it you know</text>
  <text start="5407.999" dur="2.401">put it in his grave or something like</text>
  <text start="5409.11" dur="5.879">that I don&amp;#39;t know the story is kind of</text>
  <text start="5410.4" dur="9.659">good but so I mean obviously he has some</text>
  <text start="5414.989" dur="7.32">sort of a normal person connection then</text>
  <text start="5420.059" dur="6">I feel like it&amp;#39;s eradicated like he</text>
  <text start="5422.309" dur="6.901">wasn&amp;#39;t born into this that&amp;#39;s exactly it</text>
  <text start="5426.059" dur="5.37">right so not to delve into the</text>
  <text start="5429.21" dur="5.07">psychological nurture versus nature sort</text>
  <text start="5431.429" dur="5.55">of debate Hollywood has a way of</text>

  <text start="5444.84" dur="4.62">behavior sink experiments like about the</text>
  <text start="5447.78" dur="3.33">rat motels where they would give them</text>
  <text start="5449.46" dur="3.119">unlimited food and how they evolved</text>
  <text start="5451.11" dur="3.299">you&amp;#39;ll see all the behavior you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="5454.409" dur="4.23">sort of behavior the rats would actually</text>
  <text start="5455.94" dur="4.529">delve up into four large sub groups and</text>
  <text start="5458.639" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m gonna ruin the experiment I</text>
  <text start="5460.469" dur="4.23">recommend people looking it up where if</text>
  <text start="5462.239" dur="3.721">you gave someone unlimited food you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="5464.699" dur="3.42">have one group that would endlessly</text>
  <text start="5465.96" dur="3.929">preen them&amp;#39;s prune them to clean</text>
  <text start="5468.119" dur="3.63">themselves you would have the females</text>

  <text start="5471.749" dur="3.361">never interact with anyone you&amp;#39;d have</text>

  <text start="5478.349" dur="6.361">of behavior look it up it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="5480.92" dur="10.15">it applies to this case in the sense</text>
  <text start="5484.71" dur="7.92">that when you are a intrinsic people</text>
  <text start="5491.07" dur="3.12">pleaser and that&amp;#39;s the commonality with</text>
  <text start="5492.63" dur="3.9">a lot of these actors there is a part of</text>

  <text start="5508.679" dur="5.61">physically or financially you you engage</text>
  <text start="5512.34" dur="4.23">in a strategic isolation of that person</text>
  <text start="5514.289" dur="3.39">that doesn&amp;#39;t prevent their behavior that</text>
  <text start="5516.57" dur="2.58">doesn&amp;#39;t change your behavior but still</text>
  <text start="5517.679" dur="4.531">people pleasers they just have no one to</text>

  <text start="5655.499" dur="4.5">podcasts and I don&amp;#39;t like the blank</text>

  <text start="5659.999" dur="5.49">that humans can be whatever you train</text>
  <text start="5662.219" dur="5.581">them to be that&amp;#39;s just not true I can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="5667.8" dur="4.23">you to be a chair but there are people</text>
  <text start="5669.689" dur="4.111">who sincerely believe in academic</text>

  <text start="5673.8" dur="1.67">more</text>
  <text start="5674.03" dur="3.72">getting firms and everything else and</text>
  <text start="5675.47" dur="4.08">even in the legislative positions who</text>

  <text start="5688.82" dur="4.38">destroying that intrinsic Ness they</text>
  <text start="5690.8" dur="4.62">can&amp;#39;t get enough of it and they try to</text>
  <text start="5693.2" dur="4.56">turn this into policy or science or</text>
  <text start="5695.42" dur="4.68">chemical interactions so for example</text>
  <text start="5697.76" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s a one fascinating piece of study</text>
  <text start="5700.1" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;ve seen with my generation in</text>

  <text start="5707.2" dur="5.05">amphetamines increase the amount of</text>
  <text start="5709.55" dur="4.77">white matter in your brain that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5712.25" dur="3.75">sound like much but if you connect the</text>
  <text start="5714.32" dur="3.72">dots you&amp;#39;ll see one of the problems here</text>
  <text start="5716" dur="2.85">and feta means are also known as Ritalin</text>
  <text start="5718.04" dur="2.76">and Adderall</text>

  <text start="5722.96" dur="4.95">I took my ass off of that but a lot of</text>
  <text start="5725.6" dur="4.2">people didn&amp;#39;t and so your white matter</text>
  <text start="5727.91" dur="3.09">increases and that&amp;#39;s usually associated</text>
  <text start="5729.8" dur="2.85">with being hey that&amp;#39;s great you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5731" dur="3.29">smarter because back in those days they</text>
  <text start="5732.65" dur="3.57">had very poor understanding</text>
  <text start="5734.29" dur="3.43">understandings of neurology and just</text>
  <text start="5736.22" dur="3.66">assumed that more white matter meant</text>
  <text start="5737.72" dur="5.36">better well it turns out that more white</text>
  <text start="5739.88" dur="4.35">matter means more body disassociation</text>
  <text start="5743.08" dur="5.38">hmm</text>
  <text start="5744.23" dur="7.14">okay okay yeah that&amp;#39;s a fun one so what</text>
  <text start="5748.46" dur="5.94">happens is you no longer see your body</text>
  <text start="5751.37" dur="4.89">as an extension of as a as a directly</text>

  <text start="5869.86" dur="5.25">ago they found out that this one band</text>
  <text start="5871.57" dur="6">was the best at transmitting TV signals</text>
  <text start="5875.11" dur="4.5">and so they used it for TV and then they</text>
  <text start="5877.57" dur="3.81">switched TV to digital so that they</text>
  <text start="5879.61" dur="5.64">could release the band in order to use</text>
  <text start="5881.38" dur="6.21">it for 5g and so this is what 5g is now</text>
  <text start="5885.25" dur="4.079">the thing that supposedly makes 5g more</text>
  <text start="5887.59" dur="3.96">dangerous is the fact that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5889.329" dur="4.921">directional so instead of a broadcast</text>
  <text start="5891.55" dur="5.129">wave that comes out they they claim that</text>
  <text start="5894.25" dur="4.469">there&amp;#39;s a narrow beam so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5896.679" dur="3.75">talking on the phone they&amp;#39;re sending a</text>
  <text start="5898.719" dur="5.67">beam it&amp;#39;s going through your head in</text>
  <text start="5900.429" dur="5.52">order to get to your phone.i how are</text>
  <text start="5904.389" dur="3.931">they doing the beam aiming how do you do</text>
  <text start="5905.949" dur="5.821">that I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know popping</text>
  <text start="5908.32" dur="5.19">up over night overnight they&amp;#39;ll just be</text>
  <text start="5911.77" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;ll just be like well there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="5913.51" dur="3.87">little clearing and then boom it&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="5915.309" dur="4.201">there like it literally takes 24 hours</text>
  <text start="5917.38" dur="3.839">for them to put up these towers I live</text>
  <text start="5919.51" dur="3.029">close to Augusta Georgia a fairly big</text>
  <text start="5921.219" dur="3.811">city it&amp;#39;s close to about the size of</text>
  <text start="5922.539" dur="5.37">Jacksonville and I&amp;#39;m seeing these things</text>
  <text start="5925.03" dur="4.379">pop up when I go when I go for a day or</text>
  <text start="5927.909" dur="3.9">two I come back there&amp;#39;s like three or</text>
  <text start="5929.409" dur="5.19">four I don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing you</text>
  <text start="5931.809" dur="5.43">know it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m fearful of it I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="5934.599" dur="4.14">honest I&amp;#39;m good I can tell you what</text>
  <text start="5937.239" dur="7.681">they&amp;#39;re doing with it but in terms of</text>
  <text start="5938.739" dur="10.771">harming here I&amp;#39;ll put on my human</text>
  <text start="5944.92" dur="7.86">Wikipedia for a moment so like 2.4</text>
  <text start="5949.51" dur="5.609">gigahertz that&amp;#39;s one bit 1 billion four</text>
  <text start="5952.78" dur="4.879">hundred million vibrations a second so</text>
  <text start="5955.119" dur="2.54">that means</text>
  <text start="5958.019" dur="5.35">everything in the universe has what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5960.099" dur="4.681">known as a resonant frequency so even</text>
  <text start="5963.369" dur="3.241">you have a resonant frequency it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="5964.78" dur="2.969">17 Hertz or something like that after</text>
  <text start="5966.61" dur="2.639">you human resonance</text>
  <text start="5967.749" dur="2.91">yeah Schumann resonance six Hertz for</text>
  <text start="5969.249" dur="3.95">the Platte for six Hertz for the planet</text>
  <text start="5970.659" dur="6">alright so this is an intrinsic</text>
  <text start="5973.199" dur="4.99">vibration that a structure operates at</text>
  <text start="5976.659" dur="3.661">and every structure in the universe has</text>
  <text start="5978.189" dur="3.78">it down to the individual particle so</text>
  <text start="5980.32" dur="5.94">even the galaxy has an intrinsic</text>
  <text start="5981.969" dur="9.78">frequency too so the intrinsic frequency</text>
  <text start="5986.26" dur="8.069">of water is 2.4 gigahertz which is how</text>
  <text start="5991.749" dur="4.44">microwaves work so what happens is you</text>
  <text start="5994.329" dur="3.931">turn on the microwave it&amp;#39;s not shooting</text>
  <text start="5996.189" dur="4.231">heat into your food it&amp;#39;s shooting</text>
  <text start="5998.26" dur="4.439">electromagnetic energy into your food</text>
  <text start="6000.42" dur="4.409">which in turn is vibrating the water and</text>
  <text start="6002.699" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s heating your food is the</text>
  <text start="6004.829" dur="1.591">friction of the water that&amp;#39;s heating</text>
  <text start="6005.939" dur="2.76">your food</text>
  <text start="6006.42" dur="5.759">oh that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why my Wi-Fi doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="6008.699" dur="9">work underwater that&amp;#39;s true exactly</text>
  <text start="6012.179" dur="8.07">that&amp;#39;s actually true yeah because the</text>
  <text start="6017.699" dur="5.55">the router gets wet therefore it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="6020.249" dur="6.99">it does that&amp;#39;s the problem exactly okay</text>
  <text start="6023.249" dur="8.881">so so because there&amp;#39;s water vapor in the</text>
  <text start="6027.239" dur="7.291">air that is why 4G works 5g when you</text>
  <text start="6032.13" dur="6.839">start dealing with what 50 million 50</text>
  <text start="6034.53" dur="6.629">for the 54 I think 54 G Jesus what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="6038.969" dur="5.13">resonant frequency of that I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="6041.159" dur="4.411">know but well basically there is</text>
  <text start="6044.099" dur="5.071">something in this universe that has a</text>
  <text start="6045.57" dur="5.129">resonant frequency of 54 G and this</text>
  <text start="6049.17" dur="3.389">thing is taking advantage of it I would</text>
  <text start="6050.699" dur="7.74">start your research there if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="6052.559" dur="9.27">interested in this I someone asked</text>
  <text start="6058.439" dur="6.111">regarding those stocks if I name a</text>
  <text start="6061.829" dur="2.721">couple of things</text>
  <text start="6064.94" dur="8.17">Belmonte project by Bill Gates or Google</text>
  <text start="6068.13" dur="12.18">sidewalk cafe doesn&amp;#39;t ring a bell</text>
  <text start="6073.11" dur="9.15">okay all right keep searching don&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="6080.31" dur="4.05">up there is information here because no</text>
  <text start="6082.26" dur="4.62">one has talked about the stocks after he</text>
  <text start="6084.36" dur="4.41">died what happens to stocks when they</text>
  <text start="6086.88" dur="4.79">when a person dies I would start there</text>
  <text start="6088.77" dur="7.02">well I mean wouldn&amp;#39;t they be included in</text>

  <text start="6101.88" dur="4.71">broker a lawyer a broker failure okay</text>
  <text start="6104.79" dur="5.01">when people die there is a whole process</text>
  <text start="6106.59" dur="7.19">one has to go through did he have a yes</text>
  <text start="6109.8" dur="9.06">no if he did what happened to the stocks</text>
  <text start="6113.78" dur="8.08">okay that&amp;#39;s odd that&amp;#39;s pretty breaking</text>
  <text start="6118.86" dur="5.34">news right there guys yes yeah remember</text>

  <text start="6218.19" dur="5.909">Gateway pundit talking about the fact</text>
  <text start="6220.619" dur="7.141">that the New York Times they referred to</text>
  <text start="6224.099" dur="6.48">9/11 and and they did so in terms of the</text>
  <text start="6227.76" dur="6.18">planes on 9/11 killing almost 3,000</text>
  <text start="6230.579" dur="6.12">people well I mean I guess if you look</text>
  <text start="6233.94" dur="5.219">at it one way you could say that yes the</text>
  <text start="6236.699" dur="4.801">planes are what killed people in the -</text>
  <text start="6239.159" dur="4.471">in the Trade Towers you know but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6241.5" dur="4.949">nice it&amp;#39;s like you don&amp;#39;t say that you</text>
  <text start="6243.63" dur="4.98">know the gun you know the bullet was</text>
  <text start="6246.449" dur="3.571">what did the you know the murder you</text>
  <text start="6248.61" dur="4.199">know I mean it&amp;#39;s whoever was pulling the</text>
  <text start="6250.02" dur="6.059">trigger you know so I you know and the</text>
  <text start="6252.809" dur="6.27">there was either somebody flying those</text>
  <text start="6256.079" dur="5.881">planes or they were remote-controlled so</text>
  <text start="6259.079" dur="4.681">however you look at it so people got</text>
  <text start="6261.96" dur="3.75">upset some people got upset that I</text>
  <text start="6263.76" dur="3.93">didn&amp;#39;t go into all of the various</text>
  <text start="6265.71" dur="4.909">theories now you know it could be</text>
  <text start="6267.69" dur="4.139">remote-controlled it could be you know</text>
  <text start="6270.619" dur="3.79">Holograms</text>
  <text start="6271.829" dur="5.1">it could be directed-energy weapons dr.</text>
  <text start="6274.409" dur="4.801">judy would there&amp;#39;s no way that i could</text>
  <text start="6276.929" dur="4.081">have made that video in the time that i</text>
  <text start="6279.21" dur="3.659">have allotted for myself every day if I</text>

  <text start="6282.869" dur="5.551">various theories about 9/11 the things</text>
  <text start="6286.26" dur="4.56">that I do know I&amp;#39;m fairly confident that</text>
  <text start="6288.42" dur="5.069">George HW Bush and the owners of the</text>
  <text start="6290.82" dur="4.18">5-star trust and the Saudis and Mossad</text>
  <text start="6293.489" dur="4">and the</text>
  <text start="6295" dur="5.43">they were all involved but in what</text>
  <text start="6297.489" dur="7.471">capacity and to what degree I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="6300.43" dur="6.6">so yes it was an inside job but there</text>
  <text start="6304.96" dur="5.009">was many many different players that</text>
  <text start="6307.03" dur="5.28">were involved the Bush family definitely</text>
  <text start="6309.969" dur="4.621">highly involved I think that there</text>
  <text start="6312.31" dur="4.44">probably were some Islamic extremists</text>
  <text start="6314.59" dur="3.81">patsies that were involved from Saudi</text>
  <text start="6316.75" dur="3.12">Arabia I think that&amp;#39;s definite and</text>
  <text start="6318.4" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s the only thing that I made</text>
  <text start="6319.87" dur="5.48">reference to in the video you know the</text>
  <text start="6323.08" dur="4.92">they were I believe that they were taken</text>
  <text start="6325.35" dur="4.48">where they were from Saudi Arabia so</text>
  <text start="6328" dur="4.56">they were funded by Saudi Arabia there</text>
  <text start="6329.83" dur="4.74">was a paper trail of these guys training</text>
  <text start="6332.56" dur="3.9">and doing all these things they must</text>
  <text start="6334.57" dur="4.11">have had handlers that would have been</text>
  <text start="6336.46" dur="6.23">the clowns in America I know that there</text>
  <text start="6338.68" dur="6.62">are ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel</text>
  <text start="6342.69" dur="6.04">so that would be Mossad right there</text>
  <text start="6345.3" dur="5.41">there was two point one trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="6348.73" dur="4.14">worth of money that was mysteriously</text>

  <text start="6362.92" dur="4.67">there was a couple of pieces of an</text>

  <text start="6375.13" dur="5.58">not a plane guys I&amp;#39;m not buying into the</text>
  <text start="6377.59" dur="7.53">official mainstream story about this</text>
  <text start="6380.71" dur="7.41">tragic event but I just wanted to I</text>
  <text start="6385.12" dur="5.73">guess give respect today to the fact</text>
  <text start="6388.12" dur="6.119">that these people died and it was not</text>
  <text start="6390.85" dur="5.76">just the planes that killed them on that</text>
  <text start="6394.239" dur="6.991">fateful day 18 years ago today so</text>
  <text start="6396.61" dur="6.33">everybody chill out you know well Tom</text>
  <text start="6401.23" dur="3.75">threw Bob over the building and it was</text>
  <text start="6402.94" dur="6.87">the ground that killed him right exactly</text>
  <text start="6404.98" dur="7.23">yeah yeah the thing the thing that makes</text>
  <text start="6409.81" dur="4.079">me upset about a lot of this is the fact</text>
  <text start="6412.21" dur="4.11">that</text>
  <text start="6413.889" dur="4.381">I think I said this earlier about the</text>
  <text start="6416.32" dur="4.379">way that the administration still they</text>
  <text start="6418.27" dur="4.08">had the ceremonies and the we know</text>

  <text start="6430.96" dur="5.82">makes me upset about this is that why</text>
  <text start="6433.719" dur="7.17">you know I got a counter for that tell</text>
  <text start="6436.78" dur="6">me all right so president Trump has been</text>
  <text start="6440.889" dur="4.471">taking action the entire time that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6442.78" dur="5.339">been in office all right if he was just</text>

  <text start="6450.429" dur="6.21">what guys it was you that done 9/11 then</text>
  <text start="6454.06" dur="5.369">he would get shot as quickly as JFK was</text>
  <text start="6456.639" dur="6.361">okay yes he cannot come out and say it</text>
  <text start="6459.429" dur="5.25">it has to be a covert operation and you</text>

  <text start="6582.31" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s just complete destruction there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="6585.13" dur="5.94">big hole and you know let&amp;#39;s just say</text>
  <text start="6588.52" dur="5.91">that the Pentagon is is built you know</text>
  <text start="6591.07" dur="7.95">like a brick Shi T house all right and</text>
  <text start="6594.43" dur="7.19">the it&amp;#39;s an aluminum 747 or 737 whatever</text>
  <text start="6599.02" dur="5.43">it was that that plane would have been</text>
  <text start="6601.62" dur="4.45">completely just smashed up and it would</text>
  <text start="6604.45" dur="3.63">have all just like crumpled and then</text>
  <text start="6606.07" dur="4.92">laid there on the ground</text>
  <text start="6608.08" dur="4.35">see yeah I&amp;#39;ve got disagree because you</text>
  <text start="6610.99" dur="8.46">know they make all these bullets out of</text>

  <text start="6619.45" dur="5.43">they certainly make them we have a super</text>
  <text start="6622.66" dur="5.22">chance from Mike gal it says those</text>
  <text start="6624.88" dur="4.89">planes tail numbers are being used right</text>
  <text start="6627.88" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;m not sure what that means I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="6629.77" dur="6.81">know that they still are but they were</text>
  <text start="6631.24" dur="6.9">being used after the attacks so you know</text>
  <text start="6636.58" dur="4.44">the theory that I heard is that the</text>
  <text start="6638.14" dur="5.64">planes were they were flown to like like</text>
  <text start="6641.02" dur="3.93">a like a black black budget like hanger</text>
  <text start="6643.78" dur="4.59">or something like that</text>
  <text start="6644.95" dur="6.06">people were unloaded the they had</text>
  <text start="6648.37" dur="5.04">additional planes maybe that were</text>
  <text start="6651.01" dur="4.29">painted to look like these planes they</text>
  <text start="6653.41" dur="3.78">used the same tail number and then they</text>
  <text start="6655.3" dur="3.72">were flown by remote I mean we know now</text>
  <text start="6657.19" dur="3.9">that they had the technology at that</text>
  <text start="6659.02" dur="4.86">time to fly those planes by remote and</text>
  <text start="6661.09" dur="5.07">that would completely compensate for the</text>
  <text start="6663.88" dur="4.95">unnatural maneuvers that they did you</text>
  <text start="6666.16" dur="6.6">know I mean like the bank around and the</text>
  <text start="6668.83" dur="6.45">roll and stuff and there was actually an</text>
  <text start="6672.76" dur="5.7">interview do you guys remember there was</text>
