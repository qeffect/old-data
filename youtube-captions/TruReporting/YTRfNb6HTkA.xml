  <text start="748.19" dur="5.61">Egypt or the UK Pettersen explained the</text>

  <text start="756.11" dur="5.16">a foreign leader the military aid goes</text>
  <text start="758.51" dur="5.67">to the State Department makes sure the</text>
  <text start="761.27" dur="5.37">military aid is on the line as well then</text>
  <text start="764.18" dur="4.89">we talk to whoever the handlers are for</text>
  <text start="766.64" dur="4.17">the foreign leader oftentimes President</text>
  <text start="769.07" dur="4.5">Clinton would say would you stay on the</text>
  <text start="770.81" dur="4.019">line and take notes the NCS National</text>
  <text start="773.57" dur="4.259">Security Council and State Department</text>
  <text start="774.829" dur="5.721">would also do that we would all listen</text>
  <text start="777.829" dur="4.88">in with the two principal talks some</text>
  <text start="780.55" dur="4.05">times he would say to me get me on the</text>

  <text start="784.6" dur="4.919">and don&amp;#39;t be on the line and we would do</text>

  <text start="791.41" dur="4.59">Clinton and foreign leaders Patterson</text>
  <text start="793.42" dur="4.74">said with the Trump leak clearly</text>
  <text start="796" dur="4.29">something went wrong and it is written</text>
  <text start="798.16" dur="5.21">is the responsibility of a person either</text>
  <text start="800.29" dur="6.09">at the de State Department or the NCS</text>
  <text start="803.37" dur="5.14">NSC rather somebody in Trump&amp;#39;s chain</text>
  <text start="806.38" dur="4.61">apparently has divulged what I would</text>
  <text start="808.51" dur="5.34">call highly privileged information</text>
  <text start="810.99" dur="6.31">somebody in that loop probably not the</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="6.09">military aide it was either the in SC or</text>
  <text start="817.3" dur="5.25">the State Department Patterson said that</text>
  <text start="819.94" dur="4.589">means that circle of trust was broken so</text>
  <text start="822.55" dur="4.5">someone in the State Department or the</text>
  <text start="824.529" dur="5.791">National Security Center broke that</text>
  <text start="827.05" dur="5.31">circle of trust I never would have been</text>
  <text start="830.32" dur="4.139">remotely I never wouldn&amp;#39;t even remotely</text>
  <text start="832.36" dur="4.38">thought to leak conversation material or</text>
  <text start="834.459" dur="4.461">a Content somebody out there is trying</text>
  <text start="836.74" dur="5.039">to sabotage the president and</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="5.02">commander-in-chief that is not how the</text>
  <text start="841.779" dur="4.831">process is supposed to work these are</text>
  <text start="843.94" dur="4.53">people sworn to protect when you start</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="4.32">leaking stuff like that you become an</text>
  <text start="848.47" dur="4.679">enemy domestically I understand the</text>
  <text start="850.93" dur="4.74">hatred for president Trump is huge but</text>
  <text start="853.149" dur="6.091">that is 100% out of bounds Patterson</text>
  <text start="855.67" dur="5.88">said Patterson said that Trump can and</text>
  <text start="859.24" dur="4.789">should keep the State Department in NSC</text>
  <text start="861.55" dur="5.46">off his future calls with world leaders</text>
  <text start="864.029" dur="6.791">absolutely that is 100% the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="867.01" dur="5.79">privilege Patterson said he has a much</text>
  <text start="870.82" dur="4.769">better feel now for the fact that he has</text>
  <text start="872.8" dur="5.4">leakers Washington DC is a very complex</text>
  <text start="875.589" dur="5.221">city so you have a lot of things acting</text>
  <text start="878.2" dur="4.199">and oftentimes opposing you&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="880.81" dur="4.41">figure out the lay of the land</text>
  <text start="882.399" dur="4.921">he&amp;#39;s got leakers he needs to eliminate</text>
  <text start="885.22" dur="4.47">them Patterson said I think he&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="887.32" dur="3.18">for leakers and sets people up to be</text>
  <text start="889.69" dur="3.389">eliminated</text>
  <text start="890.5" dur="5.1">Patterson noted absolutely scaramouche</text>
  <text start="893.079" dur="4.081">effect right think of how many people he</text>
  <text start="895.6" dur="3.72">pulls in and then releases him after</text>
  <text start="897.16" dur="3.84">about three weeks of work he knows who</text>
  <text start="899.32" dur="4.769">the leakers are scre Moochie effect</text>
  <text start="901" dur="4.589">there are a lot of Obama hand holdovers</text>
  <text start="904.089" dur="3.451">who were still working in the State</text>
  <text start="905.589" dur="4.291">Department White House and Pentagon</text>
  <text start="907.54" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re not happy their team didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="909.88" dur="3.94">I was a commander for civil service</text>
  <text start="912.07" dur="3.55">people in 20 years</text>
  <text start="913.82" dur="3.84">it is really hard to root out civil</text>
  <text start="915.62" dur="3.03">servants hard to root out people who are</text>
  <text start="917.66" dur="3.66">counter-productive</text>
  <text start="918.65" dur="4.8">I think Trump has a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="921.32" dur="3.66">that still don&amp;#39;t want him to last or be</text>
  <text start="923.45" dur="3.69">successful in 2020</text>
  <text start="924.98" dur="5.46">that&amp;#39;s how DC works Patterson said</text>
  <text start="927.14" dur="5.73">everybody at the White House the NSC was</text>
  <text start="930.44" dur="4.71">serving in the kill box at the privilege</text>
  <text start="932.87" dur="3.84">of the president I always knew I was</text>
  <text start="935.15" dur="3.87">serving at the privilege of President</text>
  <text start="936.71" dur="3.78">Clinton Patterson said every president</text>
  <text start="939.02" dur="3.53">has the absolute authority to do</text>
  <text start="940.49" dur="4.44">whatever it takes in terms of executive</text>
  <text start="942.55" dur="4.3">communications to do the best job in the</text>
  <text start="944.93" dur="3.93">defense of the country if people are</text>
  <text start="946.85" dur="3.9">leaking there had to be a small group of</text>
  <text start="948.86" dur="4.35">people on the phone calls Patterson said</text>
  <text start="950.75" dur="4.62">I guarantee you in quotes there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="953.21" dur="3.84">transcript if the president has other</text>
  <text start="955.37" dur="3.81">people on the phone call there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="957.05" dur="3.51">transcript every single time the</text>
  <text start="959.18" dur="3.42">president makes a phone call to a</text>
  <text start="960.56" dur="5.13">foreign leader the State Department and</text>
  <text start="962.6" dur="4.89">NSC have a transcript is definitely</text>
  <text start="965.69" dur="3.93">possible that President Trump picked up</text>
  <text start="967.49" dur="4.17">the phone called another guy personally</text>
  <text start="969.62" dur="4.14">but there would be no way that would</text>
  <text start="971.66" dur="4.44">leak unless it was a phone call that was</text>
  <text start="973.76" dur="5.61">listened to by other parties that means</text>
  <text start="976.1" dur="4.88">the NSC the military possibly ended the</text>
  <text start="979.37" dur="3.48">State Department Patterson said</text>
  <text start="980.98" dur="3.88">Patterson is currently running for</text>
  <text start="982.85" dur="4.98">Congress as a Republican in California</text>
  <text start="984.86" dur="4.56">7th US House District District Wow</text>
  <text start="987.83" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s a dangerous spot to be running</text>
  <text start="989.42" dur="5.07">but guys yes this kid&amp;#39;s developing right</text>
  <text start="992.21" dur="4.29">now this is huge this is very dangerous</text>
  <text start="994.49" dur="3.72">that there could be more leakers that</text>
  <text start="996.5" dur="4.92">are within the White House of our</text>
  <text start="998.21" dur="5.82">administration of President Trump guys</text>

  <text start="1007.38" dur="4.66">Nazism this is what they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1009.97" dur="4.74">the same thing over and over again and</text>
  <text start="1012.04" dur="5.52">it works every time but with the</text>
  <text start="1014.71" dur="5.49">internet it will stop to do this they</text>
  <text start="1017.56" dur="5.22">will stop brainwashing us because we can</text>
  <text start="1020.2" dur="4.739">get ahead of the curve with the internet</text>
