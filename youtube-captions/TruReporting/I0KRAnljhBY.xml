  <text start="182.109" dur="7.38">sadness and unfailing support today</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="3">all right I want you to pause it there</text>
  <text start="189.489" dur="3.691">because the first thing that I wanted to</text>
  <text start="191.23" dur="5.46">call attention to is the fact that this</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="5.94">took place in Texas in Ohio okay these</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="4.71">are two battleground states all right</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="4.41">these are states that the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="4.949">definitely going to need if they are</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="6.109">going to carry the election in 2020</text>
  <text start="206.349" dur="5.28">things were very close in 2016</text>
  <text start="209.639" dur="4.861">obviously we&amp;#39;ve got a lot going on with</text>
  <text start="211.629" dur="5.851">the border there specifically in El Paso</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="5.139">it&amp;#39;s interesting because the I believe</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="3.599">it&amp;#39;s the mayor of El Paso they have some</text>
  <text start="219.639" dur="3.511">type of court action where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.079" dur="5.011">trying to stop the wall from being built</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="5.309">and we knew that there was the the</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="4.56">radical leftist group in Tifa they were</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="4.5">planning to do some demonstrations or</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="3.989">some civil action there in the very near</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="4.081">future the the fact that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.639" dur="4.621">choosing these two states if they can if</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="3.659">they can sway the public to you know</text>
  <text start="239.26" dur="4.14">make them think that these are Trump</text>
  <text start="240.699" dur="4.62">supporters it is you know because of</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="4.769">Trump because of the things that he has</text>
  <text start="245.319" dur="5.64">done the the policies that he has you</text>
  <text start="248.169" dur="4.53">know his kind of you know his opinion on</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="3.24">the Second Amendment they can sway</text>
  <text start="252.699" dur="2.731">people they can sway enough people then</text>
  <text start="254.199" dur="3.84">they might be able to carry those states</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="6.39">and those electoral votes our nation to</text>
  <text start="258.039" dur="6.301">president over door of Mexico and all</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="5.54">the people of Mexico for the loss of</text>
  <text start="264.34" dur="8.009">their citizens in the El Paso shooting</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="7.91">terrible terrible thing I have also been</text>
  <text start="272.349" dur="7.181">in close contact with Attorney General</text>
  <text start="275.27" dur="6.989">and FBI director ray federal authorities</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="5.9">are on the ground and I have directed</text>
  <text start="282.259" dur="7.921">them to provide any and all assistance</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="8.28">required whatever is needed the shooter</text>
  <text start="290.18" dur="8.4">in El Paso posted a manifesto online</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="8.739">consumed by racist hate in one voice our</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="7.38">nation must condemn racism bigotry and</text>
  <text start="302.449" dur="7.921">white supremacy before the other thing</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="7.049">is that Patrick Cruces was a registered</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="5.37">Democrat all right as was the shooter in</text>
  <text start="313.009" dur="4.891">Dayton Ohio and we know that the shooter</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="4.109">in Dayton was not only just a registered</text>
  <text start="317.9" dur="5.82">Democrat but he was a supporter of</text>
  <text start="319.849" dur="5.401">antiva he was virulent ly anti Trump and</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="4.74">he was a Satanist</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="5.039">all right so none of these things are in</text>
  <text start="328.46" dur="4.53">line with what a trump supporter is or</text>
  <text start="330.289" dur="3.63">holy order would be okay so very very</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="2.01">strange</text>
  <text start="333.919" dur="3.661">you know I&amp;#39;d also like to mention</text>
  <text start="335" dur="4.86">something regarding the father of the</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="5.79">shooter and El Paso or the supposed</text>
  <text start="339.86" dur="6.179">father of the shooter now passive he was</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="4.62">a therapist involved in some kind of</text>
  <text start="346.039" dur="5.341">like weird energy working or something</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="6.12">like that also a specialist in in in</text>
  <text start="351.38" dur="4.469">children and you know how parents should</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="5.309">be dealing with their children or how to</text>
  <text start="355.849" dur="5.641">change the the the the mood and and the</text>
  <text start="359.419" dur="4.761">you know just the way that a teenager</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="6.03">acts you know how to get past that also</text>
  <text start="364.18" dur="7.269">he was trained by disciples of none</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="7.17">other than John of God the brazilian</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="6.21">faith healer who was recently africa yes</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="4.86">imprisoned for trading babies in prison</text>
  <text start="377.659" dur="4.921">for running farms where he abused over</text>
  <text start="379.55" dur="3.869">600 women so I find that very very</text>
  <text start="382.58" dur="3.69">interesting</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="5.821">as well yeah absolutely and yesterday on</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="6.239">yesterday&amp;#39;s podcast I just I went</text>
  <text start="389.24" dur="5.01">through and found out that the kids that</text>
  <text start="392.509" dur="5.311">were doing this obviously they were</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="5.219">registered as Democrat but on pretty</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="3.54">much a and a website it&amp;#39;s called my life</text>
  <text start="399.469" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s basically like a Wikipedia of</text>
  <text start="401.36" dur="4.95">everyone in the nation you sign yourself</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="5.41">up actually he was signed up as a</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="4.9">Democrat but someone went in there in</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="6.109">changed it to being a Republican also</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="7.29">following our favorite and on and also</text>
  <text start="414.889" dur="6.521">being Christian loving you know just</text>
  <text start="418.5" dur="4.77">being a evangelical Christian so all of</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="4.229">that was changed so what does that make</text>
  <text start="423.27" dur="4.56">it as it makes it a threat that makes</text>
  <text start="425.639" dur="4.561">that puts a target on the back of Trump</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="5.22">supporters that person whoever did that</text>
  <text start="430.2" dur="5.01">should be arrested because in my opinion</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s terrorism in itself that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.21" dur="3.84">putting a target on the back of innocent</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="4.62">people who don&amp;#39;t follow violence they</text>
  <text start="439.05" dur="5.97">don&amp;#39;t promote violence nope no Trump</text>
  <text start="441.57" dur="5.849">supporter promotes violence so I find it</text>
  <text start="445.02" dur="5.07">to be that&amp;#39;s sickening in itself and</text>
  <text start="447.419" dur="4.291">really suspicious highly suspicious and</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="3.66">that needs to be in the news because</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="4.89">that is very dangerous to those of us</text>
  <text start="453.75" dur="5.27">who actually do support our president</text>
  <text start="456.6" dur="6.21">and do support this movement their</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="5.08">ideologies must be defeated hate has no</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="5.28">place in America</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="8.01">hatred warps the mind ravages the heart</text>
  <text start="468.09" dur="6.78">and devours the soul I found that</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.1">statement to be very deep ravages the</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="5.16">mind and destroys the soul you know I</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="4.92">know we said other words for that but it</text>
  <text start="480.03" dur="6.54">almost kind of makes me think of MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="6.53">maybe some fracturing that&amp;#39;s that you</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="4.86">know that we can go down that line but</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="6.43">that stood out to me just that little</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="6.359">piece by all further resources they need</text>
  <text start="495.09" dur="6.63">to investigate and disrupt hate crimes</text>
  <text start="497.789" dur="8.221">and domestic terrorism whatever they</text>
  <text start="501.72" dur="6.87">need we must recognize that the Internet</text>
  <text start="506.01" dur="5.969">has provided a dangerous Avenue to</text>
  <text start="508.59" dur="7.62">radicalize disturbed minds and perform</text>
  <text start="511.979" dur="7.261">demented X we must shine light on the</text>
  <text start="516.21" dur="6.75">dark recesses of the Internet and stop</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="6.15">mass murders before they start the</text>
  <text start="522.96" dur="4.98">internet likewise is used for human</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="6.72">trafficking illegal drug distribution</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="6.71">and so many other heinous crimes the</text>
  <text start="532.11" dur="6.45">perils of the internet and social media</text>
  <text start="534.65" dur="6.7">cannot be ignored and they will not be</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="3.87">ignored in the two decades since</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="4.2">Columbine</text>
  <text start="542.43" dur="6.78">our nation is watched with rising Hara</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="6.98">and read as one mass shooting has</text>
  <text start="549.21" dur="7.38">followed another over and over again</text>
  <text start="552.53" dur="7.57">decade after decade we cannot allow</text>
  <text start="556.59" dur="7.02">ourselves to feel powerless we can and</text>
  <text start="560.1" dur="6.81">will stop this evil contagion in that</text>
  <text start="563.61" dur="6.45">task we must honor the sacred memory of</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="7.05">those we have lost by acting as one</text>
  <text start="570.06" dur="8.04">people open wounds cannot heal if we are</text>
  <text start="573.96" dur="7.26">divided we must seek real bipartisan so</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="6.03">we have to do that in a bipartisan</text>
  <text start="581.22" dur="6.66">manner that will truly make America</text>
  <text start="584.13" dur="6.69">safer and better for all first we must</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="6.42">do a better job of identifying and</text>
  <text start="590.82" dur="6.09">acting on early warning signs I am</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="5.58">directing the Department of Justice to</text>
  <text start="596.91" dur="6.21">work in partisan partnership with local</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="5.37">state and federal agencies as well as</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="4.14">social media companies to develop tools</text>
  <text start="605.25" dur="5.31">that can detect mass shooters before</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="6.48">they strike as an example the monster in</text>
  <text start="610.56" dur="5.1">the Parkland High School in Florida had</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="4.89">many red flags against him and yet</text>
  <text start="615.66" dur="4.94">nobody took decisive action nobody get</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="5.52">anything why not</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="6.73">second we must stop the glorification of</text>
  <text start="624.15" dur="5.52">violence in our society this includes</text>
  <text start="627.33" dur="6.06">the gruesome and grisly video games that</text>
  <text start="629.67" dur="6.27">are now commonplace it is too easy today</text>
  <text start="633.39" dur="4.86">for troubled youth to surround</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="5.28">themselves with a culture that</text>
  <text start="638.25" dur="5.22">celebrates violence go for it all right</text>
  <text start="641.22" dur="3.21">so what do you see I mean he&amp;#39;s sitting</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="4.35">on a lot of things here</text>
  <text start="644.43" dur="5.04">you know this this has been a long time</text>
  <text start="647.82" dur="4.53">coming that this was a social</text>
  <text start="649.47" dur="5.88">engineering project for many decades all</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="5.4">right if you go back and look at the the</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="3.39">way that we lived in the 50s and early</text>
  <text start="657.75" dur="4.4">60s</text>
  <text start="658.74" dur="7.08">uh it is a vastly different landscape</text>
  <text start="662.15" dur="6.79">violence predominates our society today</text>
  <text start="665.82" dur="4.89">and then has not been on accident you</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="3.66">know they push it in you know inner</text>
  <text start="670.71" dur="3.42">cities they push it in video games they</text>
  <text start="672.6" dur="2.74">push it on television they push it in</text>
  <text start="674.13" dur="4.149">movies people are</text>
  <text start="675.34" dur="5.43">sensitised all right you know the video</text>
  <text start="678.279" dur="4.411">game started with the military wanting</text>
  <text start="680.77" dur="3.509">to be able to train people without</text>
  <text start="682.69" dur="3.3">having them get into the military they</text>
  <text start="684.279" dur="3.361">wanted them to be sharpshooters before</text>
  <text start="685.99" dur="2.34">they got to the military correct done a</text>
  <text start="687.64" dur="3.03">great job</text>
  <text start="688.33" dur="4.61">you know none of this stuff on its own</text>
  <text start="690.67" dur="4.68">causes violence but all of it together</text>
  <text start="692.94" dur="4.54">certainly adds to the climate that we</text>
  <text start="695.35" dur="4.53">have today it&amp;#39;s very scary you know and</text>

  <text start="931.51" dur="5.49">put down at that bottom ticker and just</text>
  <text start="934.36" dur="5.55">something to take note of ensuring that</text>

  <text start="954.75" dur="6.6">of cooperation that we can pursue I am</text>
  <text start="958.92" dur="5.85">open and ready to listen and discuss all</text>
  <text start="961.35" dur="6.69">ideas that will actually work and make a</text>
  <text start="964.77" dur="6.03">very big difference Republicans and</text>
  <text start="968.04" dur="5.4">Democrats have proven that we can join</text>

  <text start="1023.87" dur="5.73">destructive bipartisan it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="1026.6" dur="5.87">battle that he&amp;#39;s battling so many areas</text>
  <text start="1029.6" dur="5.01">because of rhino&amp;#39;s because of actual</text>
  <text start="1032.47" dur="5.83">communists within the Democrat Party</text>
  <text start="1034.61" dur="4.94">it&amp;#39;s so messed up and upside down that</text>

  <text start="1043.25" dur="5.4">going with that but it it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1046.28" dur="4.11">difficult for him to do this I think</text>

  <text start="1050.39" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fine you know I understand</text>
  <text start="1052.61" dur="3.87">that some people that is a little</text>
  <text start="1054.5" dur="3.57">unnerving and it can bring more people</text>
  <text start="1056.48" dur="4.32">on from the left over to the right</text>
  <text start="1058.07" dur="5.04">because you know I think that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="1060.8" dur="5.04">step forward but do I think to take away</text>
  <text start="1063.11" dur="6.06">the guns absolutely not in no way shape</text>
  <text start="1065.84" dur="5.52">or form no I mean the problem is not the</text>
  <text start="1069.17" dur="4.25">weapons themselves the problem is people</text>
  <text start="1071.36" dur="4.16">who are mentally ill and</text>
  <text start="1073.42" dur="3.72">you know and there&amp;#39;s a major distinction</text>
  <text start="1075.52" dur="4.43">between people who suffer from mental</text>

  <text start="1094.15" dur="7.26">have and we always will win the choice</text>
  <text start="1099.01" dur="5.82">is ours and ours alone</text>
  <text start="1101.41" dur="6.57">it is not up to mentally ill monsters it</text>
  <text start="1104.83" dur="6.06">is up to us that we are able to pass</text>
  <text start="1107.98" dur="5.81">great legislation after all of these</text>
  <text start="1110.89" dur="7.53">years we will ensure that those who were</text>
  <text start="1113.79" dur="6.64">attacked will not have died in vain may</text>
  <text start="1118.42" dur="6.71">God bless the memory of those who</text>
  <text start="1120.43" dur="9.24">perished in Toledo may God protect them</text>
  <text start="1125.13" dur="7.99">may God protect all of those from Texas</text>
  <text start="1129.67" dur="6.57">to Ohio may God bless the victims and</text>
  <text start="1133.12" dur="11.04">their families may god bless america</text>
  <text start="1136.24" dur="10.62">thank you very much thank you we see no</text>
  <text start="1144.16" dur="6.36">questions from the press no to discuss</text>
  <text start="1146.86" dur="6.45">anything furthermore he got out of there</text>
  <text start="1150.52" dur="4.08">very quickly I think he was uh in my</text>
  <text start="1153.31" dur="3.36">personal opinion I felt like he was</text>
  <text start="1154.6" dur="3.75">towards the end getting almost a little</text>
  <text start="1156.67" dur="3.6">emotional maybe a gone I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1158.35" dur="5.07">he was reading the teleprompter at that</text>
  <text start="1160.27" dur="4.65">point I think he was going he was just</text>
  <text start="1163.42" dur="3.42">speaking from the heart I mean he did</text>
  <text start="1164.92" dur="3.12">say Toledo instead of Dayton so I think</text>
  <text start="1166.84" dur="4.05">that he wasn&amp;#39;t reading the teleprompter</text>
  <text start="1168.04" dur="4.53">at that point you know he was Scott yeah</text>
  <text start="1170.89" dur="3.12">he just got a little luck a little</text>
  <text start="1172.57" dur="4.41">flustered there and I definitely I felt</text>
  <text start="1174.01" dur="5.49">like he was getting emotional yeah so</text>
  <text start="1176.98" dur="5.34">you know where do we go from here you</text>
  <text start="1179.5" dur="8.34">know what do we do now we can move</text>
  <text start="1182.32" dur="9.9">forward with more censorship of internet</text>
  <text start="1187.84" dur="7.59">sites more of regulation on guns mental</text>
  <text start="1192.22" dur="5.67">illness so on and so forth but nothing</text>
  <text start="1195.43" dur="4.68">I believe neither of those three things</text>
  <text start="1197.89" dur="4.65">is going to fix what the deep state is</text>
  <text start="1200.11" dur="5.25">capable of no I mean clearly the the</text>
  <text start="1202.54" dur="4.18">only answer is ending this deep state</text>
  <text start="1205.36" dur="2.799">operation to turn</text>
  <text start="1206.72" dur="4.8">to cold-blooded killers and criminals</text>
  <text start="1208.159" dur="6.211">you know we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve been since the</text>
  <text start="1211.52" dur="5.279">1950s they instituted these social</text>
  <text start="1214.37" dur="4.62">welfare programs you know mental health</text>
  <text start="1216.799" dur="4.26">problems you used to be able to you know</text>
  <text start="1218.99" dur="3.9">get help in an institution then they</text>
  <text start="1221.059" dur="4.051">took all that stuff away and the only</text>
  <text start="1222.89" dur="4.649">thing that people have left is to go</text>
  <text start="1225.11" dur="3.809">live on the streets they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1227.539" dur="3.151">ability to take care of themselves</text>
  <text start="1228.919" dur="3.931">because they were raised basically in</text>
  <text start="1230.69" dur="4.02">the welfare system so now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1232.85" dur="4.23">created this under car under current of</text>
  <text start="1234.71" dur="4.65">a criminal class and they&amp;#39;ve done that</text>
  <text start="1237.08" dur="4.62">on purpose so that they can continue to</text>
  <text start="1239.36" dur="3.39">fill up these for-profit prisons and you</text>
  <text start="1241.7" dur="2.94">know each of these things are things</text>
  <text start="1242.75" dur="5.19">that President Trump is working on but</text>
  <text start="1244.64" dur="5.34">it is a huge huge problem each one of</text>
  <text start="1247.94" dur="4.56">them on their own and it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="1249.98" dur="4.29">be taken care of overnight so I really</text>
  <text start="1252.5" dur="4.169">hope that something happens here you</text>
  <text start="1254.27" dur="4.23">know that&amp;#39;s you know takes us away from</text>
  <text start="1256.669" dur="3.211">the direction that we&amp;#39;re going I do I</text>
  <text start="1258.5" dur="3.57">certainly don&amp;#39;t think that shutting down</text>
  <text start="1259.88" dur="5.1">sites like 8chan is the way to do it I</text>
  <text start="1262.07" dur="4.349">mean H hands not where people go to to</text>
  <text start="1264.98" dur="3.39">get radicalized they don&amp;#39;t go to buy</text>
  <text start="1266.419" dur="2.791">guns people go to H an to do research</text>
  <text start="1268.37" dur="3.21">okay</text>
  <text start="1269.21" dur="4.41">people go to H n to speak about things</text>
  <text start="1271.58" dur="3.93">that you can&amp;#39;t speak about publicly due</text>
  <text start="1273.62" dur="4.16">to the incredible censorship that we</text>
  <text start="1275.51" dur="4.74">have in this country right now</text>
  <text start="1277.78" dur="5.019">absolutely great segue - you said that</text>
  <text start="1280.25" dur="5.97">you wanted to talk about the DDoS and</text>
  <text start="1282.799" dur="6.271">the future of H in and what hangs in the</text>
  <text start="1286.22" dur="5.43">peril so if you want to screen share</text>
  <text start="1289.07" dur="4.83">what you wanted to with the D do DDoS</text>
  <text start="1291.65" dur="5.009">and bring everyone up to speed I find it</text>
  <text start="1293.9" dur="5.37">to be extremely important and intriguing</text>
  <text start="1296.659" dur="5.191">to those who may not know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1299.27" dur="4.56">talking about well yeah I just I just</text>
  <text start="1301.85" dur="3.99">wanted to you know the idea of a DDoS</text>
  <text start="1303.83" dur="4.829">attack it&amp;#39;s a denial of service attack</text>
  <text start="1305.84" dur="4.41">basically what a group or an individual</text>
  <text start="1308.659" dur="3.991">does is they attempt to take a website</text>
  <text start="1310.25" dur="4.08">offline and make it unavailable to</text>
  <text start="1312.65" dur="3.87">people who want to visit it with</text>
  <text start="1314.33" dur="4.5">overwhelming traffic from you know many</text>
  <text start="1316.52" dur="4.32">different sources so it&amp;#39;s happened at H</text>
  <text start="1318.83" dur="4.56">and many times in the past until</text>
  <text start="1320.84" dur="5.819">yesterday they had something called</text>
  <text start="1323.39" dur="6.6">CloudFlare CloudFlare was a denial of</text>
  <text start="1326.659" dur="5.221">service attack service so basically what</text>
  <text start="1329.99" dur="4.29">it would do would be to weed out those</text>
  <text start="1331.88" dur="3.929">bond attacks so that people who wanted</text>
  <text start="1334.28" dur="3.269">to visit the website and were actual</text>
  <text start="1335.809" dur="4.561">individuals then they could go ahead and</text>
  <text start="1337.549" dur="4.021">do that but now do</text>
  <text start="1340.37" dur="2.91">to everything that&amp;#39;s happened there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1341.57" dur="4.26">been this tremendous outcry from the</text>
  <text start="1343.28" dur="5.19">press and from the left saying that each</text>
  <text start="1345.83" dur="4.05">hand has to be taken offline because you</text>
  <text start="1348.47" dur="2.76">know it&amp;#39;s because of a chain you know</text>
  <text start="1349.88" dur="3.21">that these attacks have happened we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1351.23" dur="4.2">had it&amp;#39;s no mistake that these last</text>
  <text start="1353.09" dur="4.71">several shooters have specifically tried</text>
  <text start="1355.43" dur="5.67">to you know tag queue or tag a chain</text>
  <text start="1357.8" dur="3.87">along with this attack so you know late</text>
  <text start="1361.1" dur="3.11">last night</text>
  <text start="1361.67" dur="6.45">they lost their CloudFlare service and</text>
  <text start="1364.21" dur="7.66">luckily my friend neon revolt was</text>
  <text start="1368.12" dur="7.2">talking and told us that they had moved</text>
  <text start="1371.87" dur="6.18">over to something called bit let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="1375.32" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s called bit mitigate bit mitigate is</text>
  <text start="1378.05" dur="5.79">a another denial of service protection</text>
  <text start="1381.14" dur="4.83">that is available to websites I believe</text>
  <text start="1383.84" dur="5.1">they also had to move their their web</text>
  <text start="1385.97" dur="4.2">domains to a new registrar because they</text>
  <text start="1388.94" dur="3.869">were gonna get kicked off it was very</text>
  <text start="1390.17" dur="5.04">similar to what they did to gab several</text>
  <text start="1392.809" dur="4.921">months ago trying to get them taken</text>
  <text start="1395.21" dur="5.46">offline but you know there was I believe</text>
  <text start="1397.73" dur="5.34">there might have been a small you know</text>
  <text start="1400.67" dur="4.889">lapse in service but you know as far as</text>
  <text start="1403.07" dur="4.32">I can tell each hand is up there we go</text>
  <text start="1405.559" dur="3.811">got it right here got queue research</text>
  <text start="1407.39" dur="3.18">right here alright so everything is</text>
  <text start="1409.37" dur="2.61">working you know I saw a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1410.57" dur="2.76">freaking out saying that a chain was</text>
  <text start="1411.98" dur="3.329">going to go away that this was the end</text>
  <text start="1413.33" dur="3.66">of a chain but you know that just</text>
  <text start="1415.309" dur="4.051">because they lost one service doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1416.99" dur="5.46">mean they can&amp;#39;t go to another correct so</text>
  <text start="1419.36" dur="7.68">basically CloudFlare prevented bots it</text>
  <text start="1422.45" dur="6.63">kept down the the spamming of a website</text>
  <text start="1427.04" dur="4.53">so that people could actually visit the</text>
  <text start="1429.08" dur="4.11">website and you know actually get</text>
  <text start="1431.57" dur="3.57">research done talk to one another so on</text>
  <text start="1433.19" dur="3.81">and so forth they want to have anything</text>
  <text start="1435.14" dur="4.37">to do with this anymore because of the</text>
  <text start="1437" dur="5.82">shootings so they bring in another one</text>
  <text start="1439.51" dur="6.52">which is called what was it it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="1442.82" dur="6.12">bit mitigate bit mitigate to come in so</text>
