  <text start="310.93" dur="4.2">not just mirrored in the rise of mass</text>

  <text start="329.28" dur="4.75">not only because you were a good person</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="3.96">and a good friend but also because the</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="3.84">community would suffer without your</text>
  <text start="335.59" dur="4.11">presence and skills now the vast</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="3.66">majority of people can barely count on</text>
  <text start="339.7" dur="4.38">one hand the number of people whose</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="5.7">lives would be truly altered by their</text>

  <text start="347.23" dur="5.61">feel like no one cares about you anymore</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="5.91">your skills are you bitter quits you</text>
  <text start="352.84" dur="5.55">have no true community and God doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="355.12" dur="6.09">exist so what you may ask is exactly the</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="4.68">point we have created a society that now</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="4.85">offers almost none of the things that</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="6.36">make people truly happy family community</text>

  <text start="398.729" dur="4.201">not as if we haven&amp;#39;t had large numbers</text>
  <text start="400.469" dur="4.491">of powerful semi-automatic weapons in</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="4.56">this country for many decades in fact</text>
  <text start="404.96" dur="4.81">when I was in high school my classmates</text>
  <text start="407.49" dur="4.829">regularly kept rifles in their trucks in</text>

  <text start="412.319" dur="5.1">in light of these facts the only</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="5.34">sensible question to ask is what has</text>
  <text start="417.419" dur="5.191">changed instead politicians and pundits</text>
  <text start="420.36" dur="5.309">ask all the wrong questions do we have</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="5.04">too many guns we always have our video</text>

  <text start="433.069" dur="5.951">discarding institutions no the thing has</text>
  <text start="437.009" dur="4.02">fundamentally changed is that we have</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="3.929">discarded those regulating social</text>
  <text start="441.029" dur="3.78">institutions that have helped people</text>
  <text start="442.949" dur="4.44">understand their value in place in this</text>
