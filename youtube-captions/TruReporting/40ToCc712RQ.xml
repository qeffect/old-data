  <text start="435.72" dur="4.62">hearing about martial law again could we</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="3.51">be seeing something like that swooping</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="3.15">in throughout the night I had people</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="4.17">calling in all the time on my college</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="5.6">show asking about when is martial law</text>
  <text start="445.92" dur="6.06">being placed into effect</text>
