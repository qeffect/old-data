  <text start="528.45" dur="3.2">business is booming</text>

  <text start="534.71" dur="6.75">oxygenation it has become much much more</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="4.77">lucrative 20 years ago it was also</text>
  <text start="541.46" dur="4.56">possible to successfully harvest an</text>

  <text start="546.02" dur="4.32">from a transplant victim the other</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="3.42">organs such as the lungs and liver had</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="4.38">to be discarded because they had been</text>
  <text start="551.9" dur="5.64">deprived of oxygen too long to be usable</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="4.92">now the victims were put on an ECMO</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="4.83">machine oh my god this is like</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="4.77">Frankenstein which serves as an</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="4.08">artificial heart and lung and keeps</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="5.07">every last organ fresh enough to be</text>
  <text start="566.45" dur="5.22">harvested just like you know who says in</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="4.47">the Alliance they are harvesting people</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="4.95">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing now the</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="5.16">victims obviously we&amp;#39;re put on the ECMO</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="5.49">machine and before the ECMO machine a</text>
  <text start="579.11" dur="5.94">victims few solvable salvageable organs</text>
  <text start="582.11" dur="5.58">were worth maybe 250,000 now with the</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="4.91">ECMO to keep the organs fresh every</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="5.1">organ can be harvested even this skin</text>
  <text start="589.96" dur="5.02">let&amp;#39;s think about clones right and the</text>
  <text start="592.79" dur="4.89">victim is easily worth two or three</text>
  <text start="594.98" dur="4.71">times as much ECMO which has saved</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="3.75">countless lives in the West has had the</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="3.78">opposite effect in China it has</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="4.8">accelerated the killing of innocent</text>
  <text start="603.47" dur="4.95">people in recent years China has gone to</text>
