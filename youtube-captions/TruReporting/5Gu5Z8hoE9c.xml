  <text start="295.53" dur="4.37">which any normal person would have gone</text>

  <text start="310.59" dur="5.419">Epstein Ward explained the background of</text>
  <text start="313.259" dur="5.041">that deal which is now a news for Acosta</text>
  <text start="316.009" dur="4.451">specifically she elaborated that the</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="4.35">Epstein issue came up when Acosta was</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="5.31">appointed to the cabinet by President</text>
  <text start="322.65" dur="4.92">Donald Trump Ward writes he&amp;#39;d cut the</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="3.51">non-prosecution deal with one of the</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="5.279">Epstein&amp;#39;s attorneys because he had been</text>
  <text start="329.28" dur="6">told to back off that Epstein was above</text>
  <text start="332.849" dur="4.591">his pay grade I was told Epstein</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="5.069">belonged to intelligence and to leave it</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="6.36">alone again I was told</text>
  <text start="340.349" dur="4.831">Epstein belonged to intelligence he told</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="3.45">his interviewers in the trumpet</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="4.229">transition who evidently thought that</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="4.8">was a sufficient answer and went ahead</text>
  <text start="349.409" dur="4.35">and hired Acosta the Labor Department</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="3.089">had no comment when asked about this</text>
  <text start="353.759" dur="4.291">wait what</text>
  <text start="355.139" dur="5.671">so Acosta according to himself backed</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="4.95">off on prosecuting Epstein back in 2007</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="4.919">despite the possession of ample evidence</text>
  <text start="363" dur="5.009">proving his guilt because he in quote</text>
  <text start="365.729" dur="4.771">belonged to intelligence whose</text>
  <text start="368.009" dur="4.861">intelligence exactly is the first of</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="4.47">many questions that arise here this</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="4.74">claim was met with an appropriate degree</text>
  <text start="374.97" dur="4.229">of skepticism and a Kosta had a chance</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="4.2">to explain what he meant in a press</text>
  <text start="379.199" dur="5.371">conference this afternoon on camera a</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="5.219">cause to maintain that he did the best</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="4.05">he could with that case while admitting</text>
  <text start="387.029" dur="2.151">that it hardly looks like a fair</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="3.53">punished</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="4.769">now the intelligence issue came up and a</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="4.29">casus response was bizarre</text>
  <text start="393.949" dur="4.021">he punted on setting the record straight</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="4.14">instead of proffering</text>
  <text start="397.97" dur="5.28">this strange word salad when asked about</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="4.38">Ward&amp;#39;s reporting in quote so there has</text>
  <text start="403.25" dur="4.5">been a lot of reporting to that effect</text>
  <text start="404.96" dur="5.34">and let me say there&amp;#39;s been reporting to</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="5.61">a lot of effect in this case not just</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="6.33">now but over the years and again I would</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="5.94">hesitate to take this reporting as fact</text>
  <text start="416.63" dur="5.099">this was a case that was brought by our</text>
  <text start="419.3" dur="5.28">office it was brought based on the facts</text>
  <text start="421.729" dur="4.741">and I look at that reporting and others</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="4.29">I can&amp;#39;t address it directly because of</text>
  <text start="426.47" dur="4.379">our guidelines but I can tell you that a</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="5.16">lot of reporting is going down rabbit</text>
  <text start="430.849" dur="5.311">holes to anyone acquainted with our</text>
  <text start="434.03" dur="6">nation&amp;#39;s capital that&amp;#39;s non-denial</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="6.689">denial of an epic kind given the chance</text>
  <text start="440.03" dur="5.13">to refute wards report specifically that</text>
  <text start="442.849" dur="5.1">the Epstein case involved intelligence</text>
  <text start="445.16" dur="5.16">matters Acosta did nothing of the sort</text>
  <text start="447.949" dur="5.131">indeed he functionally admitted that</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s true what then can we conclude at</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="3.63">this point it appears that Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="5.19">Epstein was involved in intelligence</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="5.07">work of some kind for someone and it</text>
  <text start="460.34" dur="4.41">probably was in American intelligence</text>
  <text start="461.78" dur="5.22">either the US intelligence community at</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="4.039">community is lenient about the private</text>
  <text start="467" dur="4.349">habits of high-value agents or</text>
  <text start="468.789" dur="5.201">informants but they won&amp;#39;t countenance</text>
  <text start="471.349" dur="5.79">running sex trafficking rings for minors</text>
  <text start="473.99" dur="4.799">on American soil for years when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.139" dur="3.421">plausible that Epstein was sharing some</text>
  <text start="478.789" dur="4.38">information with the FBI</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="5.82">many criminals do so to buy themselves</text>
  <text start="483.169" dur="5.461">some insurance it&amp;#39;s implausible that he</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="4.89">was mainly working for the Americans who</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="4.8">are the suspects then it seems awfully</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="4.44">coincidental that Epstein&amp;#39;s best pal and</text>
