  <text start="380.51" dur="4.71">raised concerns about the facility</text>
  <text start="382.28" dur="5.27">safety late last week an Israeli Court</text>
  <text start="385.22" dur="5.01">heard arguments that the site had leaked</text>

  <text start="390.23" dur="3.81">occasion and that information about</text>

  <text start="406.34" dur="4.23">the site the exposure of the numerous</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="3.99">leaks at the Damona facility is greatly</text>
  <text start="410.57" dur="3.87">concerning especially in light of the</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="4.619">revelation just a few years ago that the</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="4.62">Damona reactor is believed according to</text>
  <text start="417.169" dur="6.321">a group of Israeli scientists to have</text>

  <text start="433.88" dur="4.34">just fit the Fixer reactor right</text>
  <text start="436.54" dur="4.2">fact that the site has leaked and is</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="5.25">rife with defects should be a major</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="5.28">issue for Israelis as the facility is</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="5.46">just 30 miles south of Israel&amp;#39;s capital</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="6.03">Tel Aviv yet is the city of Damona</text>

  <text start="452.05" dur="5.01">is also located just eight miles from a</text>
  <text start="453.97" dur="5.43">highly defective reactor Wow but Damona</text>
  <text start="457.06" dur="5.52">is largely largely populated by Jews</text>
