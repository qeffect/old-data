  <text start="290.659" dur="7.35">Patriots and I got into a conversation</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="6.9">with a guy there and he was expressing</text>
  <text start="298.009" dur="4.921">to me that he doesn&amp;#39;t have anyone to</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="5.549">talk to about this stuff but he watches</text>

  <text start="312.469" dur="6.54">you know just all of this stuff that we</text>
  <text start="315.319" dur="5.07">are going to talk about because I feel</text>
  <text start="319.009" dur="3.09">like there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that want</text>
  <text start="320.389" dur="4.14">to talk about this stuff they want to</text>
  <text start="322.099" dur="7.111">explore what&amp;#39;s happening we&amp;#39;ve been told</text>
  <text start="324.529" dur="7.17">that everything we know is a lie that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="5.13">a pretty heavy statement right there</text>
  <text start="331.699" dur="4.321">yeah I I heard a statement today I</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.199">believe Jordans say they threw it out</text>
  <text start="336.02" dur="7.29">there it was like if you think they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="6.93">lie about if you think they&amp;#39;ll lie about</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="4.859">whistleblowers and stuff if you think</text>
  <text start="345.469" dur="5.181">the news lies what else would they lie</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="5.041">about like if they&amp;#39;re willing to almost</text>
  <text start="350.65" dur="5.65">blatantly lie in front of us just about</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="4.949">the news you know about just you know</text>
  <text start="356.3" dur="3.839">meaningless things not everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.159" dur="4.741">meaningless on the news but just you</text>
  <text start="360.139" dur="4.801">know miniscule things just imagine what</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="4.109">else they&amp;#39;re lying to us about and</text>
  <text start="364.94" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s a reason for that and that&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="367.009" dur="5.16">keep us down it&amp;#39;s to keep our IQs down</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="4.44">is to keep our thought processes down</text>
  <text start="372.169" dur="7.141">you know this is what they&amp;#39;re here to do</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="7.14">and you know it&amp;#39;s a sick place you know</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="4.949">these oligarchs and these people that</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="5.009">hold us down and these people that write</text>
  <text start="384.259" dur="6.421">the rules and we&amp;#39;re plebs and you will</text>
  <text start="386.839" dur="6.041">obey and abide by what we say and I feel</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="4.69">like we&amp;#39;re breaking out of that</text>
  <text start="392.88" dur="5.37">somehow somehow we&amp;#39;re breaking out of</text>
  <text start="395.37" dur="3.27">this how do you think we&amp;#39;re breaking out</text>
  <text start="398.25" dur="3.6">of it</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="5.4">well I the one thing while you were</text>
  <text start="401.85" dur="5.04">talking I was thinking of isn&amp;#39;t it how</text>
  <text start="404.04" dur="5.61">long have they been doing this right</text>
  <text start="406.89" dur="5.16">when you think you really have to open</text>
  <text start="409.65" dur="5.73">up your mind a little bit yeah we just</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="6.06">found out about all this in 2016 but</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;ve had control of all the history</text>
  <text start="418.11" dur="5.88">books all of the science books they the</text>
  <text start="421.26" dur="6.15">Rothschilds the Rothschilds publish all</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="6.72">that all the books that you use in</text>
  <text start="427.41" dur="8.82">school you know encyclopedias things</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="7.95">like that and it&amp;#39;s like Jordan said if</text>
  <text start="436.23" dur="4.53">they would lie about these smaller</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="3.81">things think about all the control they</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="6.39">have and all the things they have</text>
  <text start="442.47" dur="6.18">control over so everything yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="4.29">what I was gonna say you have to start</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="7.29">questioning everything the food you eat</text>
  <text start="451.44" dur="7.17">the your school your education your</text>
  <text start="455.94" dur="5.93">entire education and I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="6.42">that this goes way back before our</text>
  <text start="461.87" dur="4.78">schoolbooks you know anybody that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="465.03" dur="4.59">mean I&amp;#39;m older than you but anybody</text>
  <text start="466.65" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s watching this within our age is</text>
  <text start="469.62" dur="5.63">that we&amp;#39;re still alive today and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.69" dur="3.56">watching this and we&amp;#39;re talking about it</text>
  <text start="475.8" dur="9.119">has probably been fed from the same</text>
  <text start="479.449" dur="8.771">poisonous tree you know and so we really</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="6">have to go back way before I try to</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="4.289">figure out how long is this been going</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="6.21">on and I think it&amp;#39;s been going on since</text>
  <text start="492.509" dur="8.461">ancient Egypt in before and maybe even</text>
  <text start="497.129" dur="5.91">before we even know about time existing</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="4.83">you know what I&amp;#39;m saying like everything</text>
  <text start="503.039" dur="6.78">is on a different timeline that they</text>
  <text start="505.8" dur="6.96">have created and the real timeline we</text>
  <text start="509.819" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t know so you talk about timelines</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="9.029">and I talk about timelines sometimes on</text>
  <text start="514.979" dur="10.651">my channel and it seems as though the</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="5.461">way I believe things and guys like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.63" dur="5.94">gonna go into some stuff that you main</text>
  <text start="527.25" dur="6.63">disagree with this is all just the the</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="4.889">majority of this is hypothetical but I</text>
  <text start="533.88" dur="4.35">no longer really believe in a ton of</text>
  <text start="536.459" dur="3.811">conspiracy theories I now believe them</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="4.32">just as conspiracies I think that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="540.27" dur="3.809">come to a point I&amp;#39;ve come to a point in</text>
  <text start="542.55" dur="3.659">my life where I&amp;#39;m starting to realize</text>
  <text start="544.079" dur="4.081">that the more tea the majority of</text>
  <text start="546.209" dur="5.431">something that I&amp;#39;m researching just has</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="7.11">so many coincidences and we know that</text>
  <text start="551.64" dur="6.75">those don&amp;#39;t exist that it&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="555.27" dur="6.509">really is it&amp;#39;s true so you know when we</text>
  <text start="558.39" dur="5.52">talk about timelines I believe that we</text>
  <text start="561.779" dur="4.771">everything everyone&amp;#39;s path is</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="5.929">pre-written and the universe</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="5.58">continuously will give you something to</text>
  <text start="569.839" dur="5.831">your in goal</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="9.569">everyone has an in goal and this is my</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="9.57">belief and let&amp;#39;s say for instance you</text>
  <text start="581.699" dur="5.76">keep you want this this house you keep</text>
  <text start="585.24" dur="3.78">you buy this house the house keeps just</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="3.69">everything&amp;#39;s going wrong with it going</text>
  <text start="589.02" dur="4.74">wrong with it but you refuse to sell it</text>
  <text start="591.149" dur="4.321">even though something keeps going wrong</text>
  <text start="593.76" dur="4.23">with it over and over again you should</text>
  <text start="595.47" dur="5.82">just sell it get rid of it move all move</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="5.25">forward to another house and I believe</text>
  <text start="601.29" dur="4.409">that the universe will continuously</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="5.07">giving you roadblocks until you take it</text>
  <text start="605.699" dur="3.431">it&amp;#39;s like a loop effect you keep going</text>
  <text start="608.31" dur="2.53">in the loop and</text>
  <text start="609.13" dur="3.39">loop in the loop before you learn your</text>
  <text start="610.84" dur="5.28">lesson and then you make your way out of</text>
  <text start="612.52" dur="6.21">it on to your next journey so and within</text>
  <text start="616.12" dur="5.1">that journey you grow you grow within</text>
  <text start="618.73" dur="4.5">this journey and I believe that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.22" dur="5.37">what we&amp;#39;re here for I think the whole</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="6.24">thing even entangling in the Great</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="7.05">Awakening is we&amp;#39;re here to learn and</text>
  <text start="629.47" dur="6.69">grow and I believe that you can either</text>
  <text start="633.64" dur="6.06">slow down the process which is what the</text>
  <text start="636.16" dur="7.92">Cabal which is what this this deep state</text>
  <text start="639.7" dur="6.24">or you could think of these oligarchs</text>
  <text start="644.08" dur="5.79">and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="6.45">all these people and our cons I mean we</text>
  <text start="649.87" dur="3.66">can get into this archons if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="2.49">know what that is I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="653.53" dur="3.95">into it I can bring it up on the</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="6.09">computer I believe that they try and</text>
  <text start="657.48" dur="6.52">stagnate us so that they can trap us</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="5.79">back even further but with a great</text>
  <text start="664" dur="6.09">awakening with like learning what things</text>
  <text start="666.76" dur="6.48">are for real the matrix begins to break</text>
  <text start="670.09" dur="5.34">it begins you know the the the veil</text>
  <text start="673.24" dur="3.06">begins to lift and then there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="3.51">stopping it</text>
  <text start="676.3" dur="5.45">then we then from a stagnant point of</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="5.97">view from a stagnant a stagnation point</text>
  <text start="681.75" dur="4.99">you begin to grow and blossom and then</text>
  <text start="684.91" dur="5.06">then the effect moves forward even</text>
  <text start="686.74" dur="5.85">quicker like most people say Linda and</text>
  <text start="689.97" dur="5.74">I&amp;#39;d like to hear your opinion on this a</text>
  <text start="692.59" dur="6.15">lot of people say that we are over 300</text>
  <text start="695.71" dur="4.98">years in the past when it comes to</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="3.99">technology when it comes to medicine</text>
  <text start="700.69" dur="5.94">when it comes to knowledge we&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="702.73" dur="6.84">300 Pat 300 years in the hole when we</text>
  <text start="706.63" dur="5.34">should be 300 years in the future what</text>
  <text start="709.57" dur="5.07">do you think about that well I think</text>
  <text start="711.97" dur="5.1">when it comes to these people yeah we</text>
  <text start="714.64" dur="4.32">are because they&amp;#39;ve been hoarding all</text>
  <text start="717.07" dur="3.86">the science they&amp;#39;ve been telling us what</text>
  <text start="718.96" dur="4.89">to think and what to believe</text>
  <text start="720.93" dur="6.13">basically because when you own all of</text>
  <text start="723.85" dur="5.61">the school you&amp;#39;re the one publishing all</text>
  <text start="727.06" dur="5.85">of the books that are being used in</text>
  <text start="729.46" dur="7.23">school to teach all over the world you</text>
  <text start="732.91" dur="7.29">basically hold the key to everything I</text>
  <text start="736.69" dur="6.24">mean you are teaching and and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="740.2" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s kind of like why I got in</text>
  <text start="742.93" dur="5.46">in flatter theory you know just</text>
  <text start="746.35" dur="5.55">researching it and wanting to know about</text>
  <text start="748.39" dur="5.94">it I mean I&amp;#39;m you do I think that the</text>
  <text start="751.9" dur="4.11">universe is the way they say it is no I</text>
  <text start="754.33" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t I think they&amp;#39;re lying to us</text>
  <text start="756.01" dur="6.42">I do I understand why people believe in</text>
  <text start="759.46" dur="5.25">Flat Earth yeah if I was to learn</text>
  <text start="762.43" dur="4.71">tomorrow that there was flat earth I</text>
  <text start="764.71" dur="5.25">could accept that because I I&amp;#39;ve studied</text>
  <text start="767.14" dur="6.9">it but I&amp;#39;m kind of leaning towards the</text>
  <text start="769.96" dur="6.24">solar system again but I did dip into</text>
  <text start="774.04" dur="6.21">where I opened up my mind to the Flat</text>
  <text start="776.2" dur="10.34">Earth you know and I see why people did</text>
  <text start="780.25" dur="9.75">that they were bucking the this this</text>
  <text start="786.54" dur="8.26">them trying to force this solar system</text>
  <text start="790" dur="7.56">thing on into the schools and stuff</text>
  <text start="794.8" dur="4.92">because they believe that the Flat Earth</text>
  <text start="797.56" dur="6.27">was biblical and if you look back into</text>
  <text start="799.72" dur="9.32">it there is a lot of evidence that that</text>
  <text start="803.83" dur="5.21">is very hard to explain you know such as</text>
  <text start="809.25" dur="7">there&amp;#39;s a certain part there&amp;#39;s a certain</text>
  <text start="812.2" dur="6.12">I think it&amp;#39;s the San Francisco bridge</text>
  <text start="816.25" dur="5.54">somebody out there might know what it is</text>
  <text start="818.32" dur="5.94">but it&amp;#39;s where there&amp;#39;s no D it goes for</text>
  <text start="821.79" dur="6.79">miles and miles and miles and you can</text>
  <text start="824.26" dur="6.81">see the end you know so it if the earth</text>
  <text start="828.58" dur="3.96">was curved at that point so I kind of</text>
  <text start="831.07" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t know what the shape of the earth</text>
  <text start="832.54" dur="8.07">is but my point about it is I studied</text>
  <text start="836.35" dur="7.65">Hollow Earth Flat Earth you know every</text>
  <text start="840.61" dur="5.96">other kind of Earth you know underground</text>
  <text start="844" dur="6.09">all the different theories about Earth</text>
  <text start="846.57" dur="7.45">because I learned that everything that I</text>
  <text start="850.09" dur="7.14">learned in school is probably a lie so I</text>
  <text start="854.02" dur="9.66">don&amp;#39;t trust the solar system the whole</text>
  <text start="857.23" dur="9.9">round earth solar system I had to go out</text>
  <text start="863.68" dur="5.76">and do all this research in order to get</text>
  <text start="867.13" dur="4.32">my grounding again you know that was the</text>
  <text start="869.44" dur="3.93">only way I could get my grounding again</text>
  <text start="871.45" dur="4.98">and even now I&amp;#39;m still waiting to see</text>
  <text start="873.37" dur="3.36">what surprises there are you know that</text>
  <text start="876.43" dur="3.959">they</text>
  <text start="876.73" dur="5.64">haven&amp;#39;t told us so yeah it pulls the rug</text>
  <text start="880.389" dur="5.041">right out from under us you know there</text>
  <text start="882.37" dur="6.89">how long has this been going on how long</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="8.55">have they known about everything and</text>
  <text start="889.26" dur="9.939">we&amp;#39;ve been 300 years behind them I think</text>
  <text start="893.98" dur="10.83">I think way longer than we think yeah I</text>
  <text start="899.199" dur="7.95">think I really do think that with</text>
  <text start="904.81" dur="4.62">military with military and you have</text>
  <text start="907.149" dur="3.571">these boring of holes in the earth and</text>
  <text start="909.43" dur="3.54">you know you have you know deep</text>
  <text start="910.72" dur="4.5">underground military bases and then you</text>
  <text start="912.97" dur="4.26">have you know these satellites and now</text>
  <text start="915.22" dur="6.059">Trump&amp;#39;s talking about going to Mars and</text>
  <text start="917.23" dur="7.289">so on and so forth it&amp;#39;s very it it makes</text>
  <text start="921.279" dur="6.721">you think what is out there in right</text>
  <text start="924.519" dur="5.88">that we are so asleep and it&amp;#39;s true it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928" dur="4.92">just exactly what 17 always says he says</text>
  <text start="930.399" dur="4.31">if you knew the truth it would put 99</text>
  <text start="932.92" dur="4.859">percent of people in the hospital and</text>
  <text start="934.709" dur="4.841">when I think my theory on that after I</text>
  <text start="937.779" dur="7.49">give mine I&amp;#39;d like to hear your theory</text>
  <text start="939.55" dur="12.719">my theory on that is that this is a</text>
  <text start="945.269" dur="9.791">matrix this is your what you do what</text>
  <text start="952.269" dur="5.401">your reality is you shape your reality</text>
  <text start="955.06" dur="4.889">and I know people and I know this guys I</text>
  <text start="957.67" dur="4.2">know that everyone&amp;#39;s gonna say Thomas</text>
  <text start="959.949" dur="5.101">you know you you&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="961.87" dur="5.37">finding God and in in in Jesus and I</text>
  <text start="965.05" dur="4.349">have I really have but I&amp;#39;m not just</text>
  <text start="967.24" dur="4.2">gonna limit myself just to that like I</text>
  <text start="969.399" dur="4.111">still let my mind wander but I know who</text>
  <text start="971.44" dur="4.8">my Savior is I know I know</text>
  <text start="973.51" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s what gives me strength and energy</text>
  <text start="976.24" dur="4.079">and everything like that but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="978.16" dur="4.71">reason for me to just shut every else</text>
  <text start="980.319" dur="4.95">thing to shut every other else thing</text>
  <text start="982.87" dur="5.01">down and not learn and expand my</text>
  <text start="985.269" dur="5.391">thinking that&amp;#39;s what we have keep our 17</text>
  <text start="987.88" dur="7.55">it always says expands your thinking so</text>
  <text start="990.66" dur="7.539">what I think all this is is I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="995.43" dur="6.219">synchronicities I believe that it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="998.199" dur="6.421">a matrix where what I do with my life</text>
  <text start="1001.649" dur="6.851">what I push out whether it be negative</text>
  <text start="1004.62" dur="7.21">or positive or confusing or angry</text>
  <text start="1008.5" dur="5.48">I get that back that it comes back to me</text>
  <text start="1011.83" dur="5.16">in that shapes the people around me</text>
  <text start="1013.98" dur="5.29">because if we learn and we can you know</text>
  <text start="1016.99" dur="5.55">we can research this here today that</text>
  <text start="1019.27" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re all linked we are all created by</text>
  <text start="1022.54" dur="4.77">God we are all a reflection of ourselves</text>
  <text start="1024.55" dur="5.22">so the people who you who you surround</text>
  <text start="1027.31" dur="5.43">yourself with are usually the way you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1029.77" dur="5.58">acting is if you&amp;#39;re being you know a</text>
  <text start="1032.74" dur="4.17">real-ass you&amp;#39;re gonna surround yourself</text>
  <text start="1035.35" dur="3.51">with probably bad people who are not</text>
  <text start="1036.91" dur="3.75">doing good things if you surround</text>
  <text start="1038.86" dur="4.14">yourself with good people who are</text>
  <text start="1040.66" dur="4.56">generous and kind you yourself will</text>
  <text start="1043" dur="4.069">adapt to them because it&amp;#39;s almost as if</text>
  <text start="1045.22" dur="5.01">you were just reflecting off each other</text>
  <text start="1047.069" dur="5.911">so what I think when everyone says or</text>
  <text start="1050.23" dur="5.46">when seventeen says that when you have a</text>
  <text start="1052.98" dur="4.51">99.9 percent breakdown of humanity when</text>
  <text start="1055.69" dur="2.52">they realize everything I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1057.49" dur="3.6">what it is</text>
  <text start="1058.21" dur="4.89">I think people are so asleep that they</text>
  <text start="1061.09" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t really realize that they can</text>
  <text start="1063.1" dur="5.82">actually manipulate their reality and</text>
  <text start="1065.41" dur="5.97">that this what we&amp;#39;re living in isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1068.92" dur="5.49">just so structured like it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="1071.38" dur="5.19">like a thing that can&amp;#39;t be molded like I</text>
  <text start="1074.41" dur="7.52">think it can be molded and I think it</text>
  <text start="1076.57" dur="8.34">can be m&amp;#39;&amp;#39;d what do you think about that</text>
  <text start="1081.93" dur="4.39">well I agree with you that that&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="1084.91" dur="7.38">of it</text>
  <text start="1086.32" dur="9.9">I think that that what 17 means mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1092.29" dur="9.09">when they say that I&amp;#39;m think of course</text>
  <text start="1096.22" dur="8.58">you know I&amp;#39;m also the scream queen a lot</text>
  <text start="1101.38" dur="4.8">of horrible murders and and I follow you</text>
  <text start="1104.8" dur="4.38">know I know a lot about serial killers</text>
  <text start="1106.18" dur="9.08">and horrible murders and things but I</text>
  <text start="1109.18" dur="11.25">think what 17 means is when and if</text>
  <text start="1115.26" dur="7.78">within what we already know okay I think</text>
  <text start="1120.43" dur="4.44">the cannibalism and the fact that</text>
  <text start="1123.04" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re putting this stuff in the food</text>
  <text start="1124.87" dur="4.26">look you and I know it&amp;#39;s in there but</text>
  <text start="1127" dur="3.33">these people don&amp;#39;t what are they gonna</text>
  <text start="1129.13" dur="5.12">do when they find out they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1130.33" dur="6.15">eating human meat and aborted fetuses</text>
  <text start="1134.25" dur="4.39">what do they go do when they find out</text>
  <text start="1136.48" dur="5.26">that their their father died of cancer</text>
  <text start="1138.64" dur="5.26">and that these people caused it you know</text>
  <text start="1141.74" dur="6.54">I think we&amp;#39;re going to be introduced to</text>
  <text start="1143.9" dur="6.15">new levels of evil because ultimately I</text>
  <text start="1148.28" dur="4.98">think what you&amp;#39;re talking about is</text>
  <text start="1150.05" dur="7.79">definitely part of it but I think it</text>
  <text start="1153.26" dur="9.66">goes back to the ultimate battle between</text>
  <text start="1157.84" dur="6.7">good and evil and that the good and then</text>
  <text start="1162.92" dur="2.58">this is where I think what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1164.54" dur="4.83">talking about</text>
  <text start="1165.5" dur="7.02">is so much better than we know it is but</text>
  <text start="1169.37" dur="5.91">the e on the flip side of that the evil</text>
  <text start="1172.52" dur="7.05">is so much darker than we can ever</text>
  <text start="1175.28" dur="6.54">imagine and this whole thing that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1179.57" dur="4.41">talking about because I do believe we</text>
  <text start="1181.82" dur="4.32">are vibrating you know all the time</text>
  <text start="1183.98" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re vibrating we&amp;#39;re sending out</text>
  <text start="1186.14" dur="5.16">frequencies you know what depending on</text>
  <text start="1188.63" dur="4.74">what kind of mood we&amp;#39;re in what kind of</text>
  <text start="1191.3" dur="3.69">mood we allowed ourselves to get into</text>
  <text start="1193.37" dur="3.96">because a lot of times it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="1194.99" dur="6.689">what kind of mood you&amp;#39;re in you stubbed</text>
  <text start="1197.33" dur="7.77">your toe you know and Men start cursing</text>
  <text start="1201.679" dur="7.591">and then you should be able to get over</text>
  <text start="1205.1" dur="6.66">it but you don&amp;#39;t you just keep dwelling</text>
  <text start="1209.27" dur="4.77">on it you know you just can&amp;#39;t you wrote</text>
  <text start="1211.76" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re like dang my foot hunts you know</text>
  <text start="1214.04" dur="6.54">it&amp;#39;s a my grandmother used to do this</text>
  <text start="1216.95" dur="6.81">thing when we would get into the car and</text>
  <text start="1220.58" dur="8.66">it&amp;#39;d be steaming hot so we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1223.76" dur="5.48">hot right and she would get in the car</text>
  <text start="1239.05" dur="7.24">she&amp;#39;s literally making the temperature</text>
  <text start="1242.12" dur="7.68">go by talking about it like that yeah</text>
  <text start="1246.29" dur="5.07">yes yeah all right I know I get what</text>
  <text start="1249.8" dur="2.85">you&amp;#39;re saying yeah it&amp;#39;s like yeah I</text>
  <text start="1251.36" dur="3.48">understand what you&amp;#39;re saying like she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1252.65" dur="3.84">complaining about the heat and then the</text>
  <text start="1254.84" dur="3.36">more you think about the heat the hotter</text>
  <text start="1256.49" dur="3.84">it gets it&amp;#39;s like yeah that makes</text>
  <text start="1258.2" dur="8.28">complete sense it&amp;#39;s like also she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1260.33" dur="10.14">putting out these audio frequencies you</text>
  <text start="1266.48" dur="5.79">know her voices inflect is adding to the</text>
  <text start="1270.47" dur="4.26">heat you know she&amp;#39;s putting out these</text>
  <text start="1272.27" dur="6.9">frequencies these audio frequency</text>
  <text start="1274.73" dur="7.05">that are in it&amp;#39;s not even just that</text>
  <text start="1279.17" dur="5.58">she&amp;#39;s expressing irritation which she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1281.78" dur="6.12">doing or the suffocation or whatever</text>
  <text start="1284.75" dur="7.34">she&amp;#39;s feeling it&amp;#39;s that I&amp;#39;m picking that</text>
  <text start="1287.9" dur="6.09">up from her by this tone in her voice</text>
  <text start="1292.09" dur="3.25">because think about it</text>
  <text start="1293.99" dur="4.62">you could say in a hundred different</text>
  <text start="1295.34" dur="5.37">ways you can go whew it&amp;#39;s getting hot in</text>
  <text start="1298.61" dur="6.6">here let&amp;#39;s turn the air conditioner on</text>
  <text start="1300.71" dur="6.78">cool things down you know and sort of</text>
  <text start="1305.21" dur="8.52">and everybody ready to get cool you know</text>
  <text start="1307.49" dur="11.16">or you can do what she does and then</text>
  <text start="1313.73" dur="8.01">you&amp;#39;re just you know I mean it all is an</text>
  <text start="1318.65" dur="5.49">attitude its atmosphere that you create</text>
  <text start="1321.74" dur="4.65">through all these different devices like</text>
  <text start="1324.14" dur="7.32">the sound of your voice your body</text>
  <text start="1326.39" dur="8.33">language your your posture you know just</text>
  <text start="1331.46" dur="5.64">everything about you these vibrations</text>
  <text start="1334.72" dur="3.94">well I mean here we go</text>
  <text start="1337.1" dur="3.93">I wanted to bring this I&amp;#39;m gonna bring</text>
  <text start="1338.66" dur="6.29">this in on screen real quick it says</text>
  <text start="1341.03" dur="7.83">here that let me scoot it over a bit</text>
  <text start="1344.95" dur="8.61">there&amp;#39;s a theory that the change from</text>
  <text start="1348.86" dur="9.24">432 Hertz to 440 Hertz was dictated by a</text>
  <text start="1353.56" dur="7.15">you know what propaganda minister Adolf</text>
  <text start="1358.1" dur="5.4">I can&amp;#39;t I want to say that word Joseph</text>
  <text start="1360.71" dur="5.55">Goebbels he used to make people think</text>
  <text start="1363.5" dur="4.44">and feel a certain manner and to make</text>
  <text start="1366.26" dur="4.86">them a prisoner of a certain</text>
  <text start="1367.94" dur="5.79">consciousness then around 1940 the</text>
  <text start="1371.12" dur="6.57">united states introduced 440 Hertz</text>
  <text start="1373.73" dur="10.68">worldwide and finally in 1953 it became</text>
  <text start="1377.69" dur="10.59">the ISO 16 standard so if you go on if</text>
  <text start="1384.41" dur="7.68">you go on to you too and I and I sleep</text>
  <text start="1388.28" dur="6.54">to this every night 432 Hertz because</text>
  <text start="1392.09" dur="5.7">there&amp;#39;s a reason that somebody who was</text>
  <text start="1394.82" dur="7.05">part of the Third Reich switched that up</text>
  <text start="1397.79" dur="5.16">from 432 to 440 everything the earth is</text>
  <text start="1401.87" dur="3.21">tuned to a Hertz</text>
  <text start="1402.95" dur="4.65">we are tuned to a Hertz and if you</text>
  <text start="1405.08" dur="4.589">slightly tweak that</text>
  <text start="1407.6" dur="3.569">it can obviously do something it could</text>
  <text start="1409.669" dur="3.181">do something to your DNA could do</text>
  <text start="1411.169" dur="3.301">something to your brain it could make</text>
  <text start="1412.85" dur="3.539">you feel a certain way and this is what</text>
  <text start="1414.47" dur="3.929">he&amp;#39;s talking about he&amp;#39;s talking about it</text>
  <text start="1416.389" dur="3.961">could actually make people feel in a</text>
  <text start="1418.399" dur="4.83">certain manner and to make them a</text>
  <text start="1420.35" dur="5.819">prisoner on certain consciousnesses now</text>
  <text start="1423.229" dur="7.04">Linda this is my thought on this where</text>
  <text start="1426.169" dur="6.63">in the hell did he get that information</text>
  <text start="1430.269" dur="4.571">well okay</text>
  <text start="1432.799" dur="6.84">let me tell you and I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="1434.84" dur="7.139">people are you know I I wouldn&amp;#39;t call</text>
  <text start="1439.639" dur="4.081">myself a Christian in the sense that I</text>
  <text start="1441.979" dur="5.16">go to church all the time and read the</text>

  <text start="1480.109" dur="5.31">evil because when I saw that they were</text>

  <text start="1792.46" dur="4.98">something different and it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1794.26" dur="8.24">positive well a couple things about what</text>
  <text start="1797.44" dur="7.74">you just said sure one thing is if BBC</text>
  <text start="1802.5" dur="7.66">it&amp;#39;s an enigma to me I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="1805.18" dur="7.05">obsessed with BBC in the sense that you</text>
  <text start="1810.16" dur="6.33">need so much of their programming is so</text>
  <text start="1812.23" dur="6.72">good it really is good program it&amp;#39;s if</text>
  <text start="1816.49" dur="6.54">you want to be entertained I mean I know</text>
  <text start="1818.95" dur="8.1">it&amp;#39;s all programming but it it&amp;#39;s so well</text>
  <text start="1823.03" dur="5.97">done and I don&amp;#39;t know you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1827.05" dur="3.75">sometimes it&amp;#39;s really hard to even see</text>
  <text start="1829" dur="3.15">what the programming is because I feel</text>
  <text start="1830.8" dur="5.88">like the whole thing was so beneficial</text>
  <text start="1832.15" dur="9.48">to watch and they had a series you know</text>
  <text start="1836.68" dur="7.02">I think it was beyond the pier where the</text>
  <text start="1841.63" dur="3.36">hist the mystery of the pyramids or</text>
  <text start="1843.7" dur="7.2">something like that it was a whole</text>
  <text start="1844.99" dur="9.09">series and there was a lot of disclosure</text>
  <text start="1850.9" dur="5.55">in there of course now I know that they</text>
  <text start="1854.08" dur="4.65">have to tell you some of the truths or</text>
  <text start="1856.45" dur="6.51">whatever but they did a whole thing</text>
  <text start="1858.73" dur="7.38">about how the pyramids were a system all</text>
  <text start="1862.96" dur="7.44">across the globe and that there were</text>
  <text start="1866.11" dur="7.71">certain pyramids that they used to use</text>
  <text start="1870.4" dur="6.21">the vibrations and the frequencies that</text>
  <text start="1873.82" dur="6.44">they would go in and lay down in these</text>
  <text start="1876.61" dur="7.77">pyramids and and be healed from the</text>
  <text start="1880.26" dur="7.63">vibrations and the frequencies that were</text>
  <text start="1884.38" dur="7.32">going inside these certain pyramids and</text>
  <text start="1887.89" dur="6.51">yeah you can look it up and see guide my</text>
  <text start="1891.7" dur="4.71">memories going I can&amp;#39;t remember the name</text>
  <text start="1894.4" dur="3.93">of it but I think it&amp;#39;s the secret of the</text>
  <text start="1896.41" dur="3.48">pyramids or the mystery of the pyramids</text>
  <text start="1898.33" dur="4.14">or something like that and it was a</text>
  <text start="1899.89" dur="5.19">series but they talked about these</text>
  <text start="1902.47" dur="4.53">healing pyramids that they had and they</text>
  <text start="1905.08" dur="5.55">would go in and the frequent they would</text>
  <text start="1907" dur="6.66">create sounds and frequencies inside of</text>
  <text start="1910.63" dur="5.64">these pyramids and you&amp;#39;d lay on these</text>
  <text start="1913.66" dur="7.44">tables and you would just lay in that</text>
  <text start="1916.27" dur="7.41">there and it you would be healed and so</text>
  <text start="1921.1" dur="3.37">I know I was watching Mark Taylor one</text>
  <text start="1923.68" dur="3.01">time and he was</text>
  <text start="1924.47" dur="7.53">talking about satan&amp;#39;s frequency versus</text>
  <text start="1926.69" dur="9.71">the healing frequency and you know when</text>
  <text start="1932" dur="8.99">he said was well if you can heal with a</text>
  <text start="1936.4" dur="7.54">frequency then you can do damage with</text>
  <text start="1940.99" dur="5.37">the frequency and that&amp;#39;s what these</text>
  <text start="1943.94" dur="6.51">creeps have done you know they&amp;#39;ve found</text>
  <text start="1946.36" dur="7.42">the most damaging frequencies to put out</text>
  <text start="1950.45" dur="4.8">and I think it&amp;#39;s Alan Watts that has a</text>
  <text start="1953.78" dur="4.95">video it&amp;#39;s called never watched</text>
  <text start="1955.25" dur="5.07">television it&amp;#39;s a short video but he</text>
  <text start="1958.73" dur="4.26">talks about how it was created by the</text>

  <text start="2044.86" dur="5.43">stuff about airplane mode it actually</text>
  <text start="2048.159" dur="4.621">shuts off something within the phone</text>
  <text start="2050.29" dur="3.93">that is emitting frequencies that I</text>
  <text start="2052.78" dur="2.639">think it&amp;#39;s really bad for us when we</text>

  <text start="2057.58" dur="6.51">level with us something to look into I</text>
  <text start="2060.48" dur="9.43">pulled up this Linda real quick as I am</text>
  <text start="2064.09" dur="9.03">as you were talking about the the sound</text>
  <text start="2069.91" dur="5.76">healing Pyramids of Egypt and we could</text>
  <text start="2073.12" dur="5.13">see here how some pyramids of Egypt were</text>
  <text start="2075.67" dur="4.56">designed with the healing purpose with</text>
  <text start="2078.25" dur="4.11">the purpose of healing while it is</text>
  <text start="2080.23" dur="4.35">traditionally believed that the pyramids</text>
  <text start="2082.36" dur="4.49">of Egypt were used for the final resting</text>

  <text start="2086.85" dur="5.47">academics are be are beginning to</text>
  <text start="2089.86" dur="5.94">challenge this idea claiming that some</text>
  <text start="2092.32" dur="6.42">pyramids were used for sound healing so</text>
  <text start="2095.8" dur="4.95">it also says the first and most obvious</text>
  <text start="2098.74" dur="4.05">reason that many of the Great Pyramids</text>
  <text start="2100.75" dur="3.36">were not used for burial sites is that</text>
  <text start="2102.79" dur="3.54">they are not decorated with</text>
  <text start="2104.11" dur="5.22">hieroglyphics which was an important</text>
  <text start="2106.33" dur="5.25">feature for all Egyptian tombs secondly</text>
  <text start="2109.33" dur="4.95">because tomb Raider&amp;#39;s were a constant</text>

  <text start="2131.05" dur="3.3">story all the time it says they were</text>
  <text start="2132.76" dur="3.06">buried in the Valley of the Kings so</text>
  <text start="2134.35" dur="5.01">that the mummy would rest in peace</text>
  <text start="2135.82" dur="5.43">undisturbed not buried in plain sight in</text>
  <text start="2139.36" dur="3.54">the most recognizable buildings in the</text>
  <text start="2141.25" dur="3.57">world for these reasons keeping up in</text>
  <text start="2142.9" dur="3.75">mind that the great pyramids were used</text>
  <text start="2144.82" dur="5.34">for something else</text>
  <text start="2146.65" dur="6.39">Linda&amp;#39;s correct doctor Abid Hakeem a</text>
  <text start="2150.16" dur="4.11">yawn is a native Egyptian archeologist</text>
  <text start="2153.04" dur="3.54">elder who has been endowed with</text>
  <text start="2154.27" dur="5.4">knowledge that has been passed down from</text>
  <text start="2156.58" dur="5.28">generation to generation and he believes</text>
  <text start="2159.67" dur="4.44">that the pyramids were used for sound</text>
  <text start="2161.86" dur="4.71">healing and we can look at these</text>
  <text start="2164.11" dur="5.25">pictures right here dr. beeves believes</text>
  <text start="2166.57" dur="4.95">that the quartz and we&amp;#39;ve all know about</text>
  <text start="2169.36" dur="3.66">limestone we all know about ghosts we</text>
  <text start="2171.52" dur="3.42">could talk about paranormal here too</text>
  <text start="2173.02" dur="4.35">that most buildings that are built out</text>
  <text start="2174.94" dur="4.11">of limestone built near water or more</text>
  <text start="2177.37" dur="4.11">paranormal active they have more</text>
  <text start="2179.05" dur="4.35">paranormal activity within them so it</text>
  <text start="2181.48" dur="3.54">says here that these granite slabs found</text>
  <text start="2183.4" dur="3.69">in some chambers and I&amp;#39;m gonna slide it</text>
  <text start="2185.02" dur="4.77">over so we can see chambers were not</text>
  <text start="2187.09" dur="4.2">meant as a sarcophagus but were meant</text>
  <text start="2189.79" dur="4.2">for people to lie in</text>
  <text start="2191.29" dur="5.13">they absorbed healing power of the</text>
  <text start="2193.99" dur="5.52">particular frequency that the chamber</text>
  <text start="2196.42" dur="4.5">resonated and as we can see here I will</text>
  <text start="2199.51" dur="4.23">blow this up for you guys on the screen</text>
  <text start="2200.92" dur="5.16">these are the tombs as we can see here</text>
  <text start="2203.74" dur="4.23">sound chambers like the ones found in</text>
  <text start="2206.08" dur="4.56">the Red Pyramid are designed exactly</text>
  <text start="2207.97" dur="5.1">like modern-day acoustic chambers that</text>
  <text start="2210.64" dur="5.7">sound therapist used today</text>
  <text start="2213.07" dur="7.41">so very good Linda right on point with</text>
  <text start="2216.34" dur="6.42">what you just said you know you know</text>
  <text start="2220.48" dur="5.63">this we got off on this tangent she I</text>
  <text start="2222.76" dur="6.72">just add something to that sure sure</text>
  <text start="2226.11" dur="5.5">intriguing if you will it pertains to</text>
  <text start="2229.48" dur="8.79">the pyramids and I had this conversation</text>
  <text start="2231.61" dur="8.31">with 107 and he I want to have it do an</text>
  <text start="2238.27" dur="4.8">interview with him about this but but</text>
  <text start="2239.92" dur="5.4">what he was telling me or her started to</text>
  <text start="2243.07" dur="4.05">tell me or touched on it and then moved</text>
  <text start="2245.32" dur="4.89">on just other things and I was like hey</text>
  <text start="2247.12" dur="7.25">wait a minute let&amp;#39;s go back here was</text>
  <text start="2250.21" dur="9.18">that in when the pyramids actually also</text>
  <text start="2254.37" dur="10.03">they were preserving their DNA because</text>
  <text start="2259.39" dur="7.35">they had advanced knowledge that on a</text>
  <text start="2264.4" dur="6.09">big so that they could because they all</text>
  <text start="2266.74" dur="6.24">do this like the Royals they they all do</text>
  <text start="2270.49" dur="5.16">this these bloodlines mm-hmm they want</text>
  <text start="2272.98" dur="5.36">to be brought back to life they want to</text>
  <text start="2275.65" dur="6.48">preserve their DNA for the future and</text>
  <text start="2278.34" dur="7.24">there&amp;#39;s this idea that many of them</text>
  <text start="2282.13" dur="8.55">believe that they come from an ancient</text>
  <text start="2285.58" dur="8.1">civilization that landed here millions</text>
  <text start="2290.68" dur="6.45">of years ago and they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck</text>
  <text start="2293.68" dur="5.43">here and they want to get back you know</text>
  <text start="2297.13" dur="4.44">but they don&amp;#39;t have the technology but</text>
  <text start="2299.11" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re saving their DNA that like they</text>
  <text start="2301.57" dur="5.76">know that eventually the technology will</text>
  <text start="2304.51" dur="5.37">come when they can be brought back to</text>
  <text start="2307.33" dur="5.94">life now that&amp;#39;s what they believe you</text>
  <text start="2309.88" dur="6.45">know but it&amp;#39;s I think a fascinating</text>
  <text start="2313.27" dur="5">thing and also they do save their DNA</text>
  <text start="2316.33" dur="5.28">they save their bones and their teeth</text>
  <text start="2318.27" dur="5.38">especially because of the Pharaohs new I</text>
  <text start="2321.61" dur="5.72">learned this from 107</text>
  <text start="2323.65" dur="7.23">that the pharaohs knew that the teeth is</text>
  <text start="2327.33" dur="5.68">the most perfect form of DNA and holds</text>
  <text start="2330.88" dur="7.47">the most concentrated and the most</text>
  <text start="2333.01" dur="8.6">information and I will say also adding</text>
  <text start="2338.35" dur="6.87">to this sort of mysterious conversation</text>
  <text start="2341.61" dur="9.58">that Jeffrey Epstein had a dental office</text>
  <text start="2345.22" dur="8.49">in his Florida home a dental chair and</text>
  <text start="2351.19" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s photographs of him pulling these</text>
  <text start="2353.71" dur="6.69">little girls their teeth and he also</text>
  <text start="2356.71" dur="5.1">wanted to create a race of people yeah I</text>
  <text start="2360.4" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve heard that yeah oh</text>
  <text start="2361.81" dur="8.43">yeah he was a completely in the human</text>
  <text start="2363.97" dur="8.61">human eugenics and basically wanted to</text>
  <text start="2370.24" dur="5.04">make I forget what the word is I wish I</text>
  <text start="2372.58" dur="6.45">could think of it right now but you know</text>
  <text start="2375.28" dur="6.42">he basically wanted to you know have sex</text>
  <text start="2379.03" dur="6.69">with tons and tons of women he basically</text>
  <text start="2381.7" dur="6.39">wanted to like procreate yeah it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2385.72" dur="4.65">strange we wanted to make his own race</text>
  <text start="2388.09" dur="4.02">of people right and if anyone in the</text>
  <text start="2390.37" dur="3.51">chat if you know what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="2392.11" dur="7.59">about what was that what is that word</text>
  <text start="2393.88" dur="7.2">where you let me see real quick you</text>
  <text start="2399.7" dur="3.96">could continue talk I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="2401.08" dur="5.94">gonna search this about really I think</text>
  <text start="2403.66" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s interesting that first of all</text>
  <text start="2407.02" dur="6.96">Epstein Island even though it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2409.75" dur="8.13">linked back to this bath place it still</text>
  <text start="2413.98" dur="6.57">has Egyptian flavor to it with the blue</text>
  <text start="2417.88" dur="5.75">and white stripes and and all of this it</text>
  <text start="2420.55" dur="5.97">has it still has that Egyptian air and</text>
  <text start="2423.63" dur="7.03">he wants to create his own race of</text>
  <text start="2426.52" dur="14.01">people and he&amp;#39;s extracting teeth from</text>
  <text start="2430.66" dur="12.87">these girls and the Pharaohs and you</text>
  <text start="2440.53" dur="6.36">know the I guess the leaders of the</text>
  <text start="2443.53" dur="5.91">rulers in ancient Egypt they all had</text>
  <text start="2446.89" dur="5.67">their teeth preserved as the perfect</text>
  <text start="2449.44" dur="4.71">source of DNA so somehow I feel like</text>
  <text start="2452.56" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s all connected</text>
  <text start="2454.15" dur="5.909">you know in some way right there talking</text>
  <text start="2457" dur="5.64">about it in the in the chat and that</text>
  <text start="2460.059" dur="3.27">right when I found transhumanism is what</text>
  <text start="2462.64" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="2463.329" dur="5.25">transhumanism Jeffrey Epstein the</text>
  <text start="2466.24" dur="3.539">wealthy financière who was accused I can</text>
  <text start="2468.579" dur="2.79">bring this over this is actually from</text>
  <text start="2469.779" dur="3.81">the crooked New York Times</text>
  <text start="2471.369" dur="3.75">so actually somebody did a real article</text>
  <text start="2473.589" dur="3.99">over there mr. Epstein over the years</text>
  <text start="2475.119" dur="4.44">was confided to scientists and others</text>
  <text start="2477.579" dur="3.331">about his scheme according to four</text>
  <text start="2479.559" dur="3.211">people familiar with his thinking</text>
  <text start="2480.91" dur="4.11">although there&amp;#39;s no evidence that it</text>
  <text start="2482.77" dur="4.86">ever came to fruition I guarantee you he</text>
  <text start="2485.02" dur="4.799">tried mr. Epstein&amp;#39;s vision reflected his</text>
  <text start="2487.63" dur="4.32">long-standing fascination with what</text>
  <text start="2489.819" dur="3.75">became known as transhumanism the</text>
  <text start="2491.95" dur="3.48">science of improving the human</text>
  <text start="2493.569" dur="3.75">population through technologies like</text>
  <text start="2495.43" dur="4.619">genetic engineering and artificial</text>
  <text start="2497.319" dur="5.581">intelligence he would also have many</text>
  <text start="2500.049" dur="6.27">women and he had sex with and trying to</text>
  <text start="2502.9" dur="5.61">do that what a sick individual where did</text>
  <text start="2506.319" dur="4.53">he get this information from this is</text>
  <text start="2508.51" dur="5.7">what how people need to think trans</text>
  <text start="2510.849" dur="5.43">human transhumanism why would this man</text>
  <text start="2514.21" dur="4.619">where would he get this information</text>
  <text start="2516.279" dur="4.411">because your average Joe the guy who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2518.829" dur="3.99">down the street working at your your</text>
  <text start="2520.69" dur="5.01">Publix or the guy who&amp;#39;s changing your</text>

  <text start="2530.02" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t know what this is like then they</text>
  <text start="2531.849" dur="3.121">would never even don&amp;#39;t die not knowing</text>
  <text start="2533.41" dur="3.06">what this is and I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="2534.97" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re simple-minded but they live</text>
  <text start="2536.47" dur="4.079">simple lives I used to live a simple</text>
  <text start="2538.27" dur="6">life before I found this you could see</text>
  <text start="2540.549" dur="6.51">here that where are they getting this</text>
  <text start="2544.27" dur="5.339">information and this is what I want to</text>
  <text start="2547.059" dur="4.23">get to the bottom of because I want the</text>
  <text start="2549.609" dur="4.531">root of it I want to know where they get</text>
  <text start="2551.289" dur="6.631">this from it&amp;#39;s insane well let me say</text>
  <text start="2554.14" dur="5.909">this okay I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot of this</text>
  <text start="2557.92" dur="7.439">from 107 because he knows a lot about</text>
  <text start="2560.049" dur="7.8">DNA and a lot of this information is</text>
  <text start="2565.359" dur="4.801">stored in your DNA and that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="2567.849" dur="4.411">breeding program is all about that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="2570.16" dur="5.639">they keep their bloodlines pure because</text>
  <text start="2572.26" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re passing this knowledge down from</text>
  <text start="2575.799" dur="4.53">generation to generation and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2578.38" dur="4.08">lot of what their satanic ritual abuse</text>
  <text start="2580.329" dur="4.831">thing is about these kids they have to</text>
  <text start="2582.46" dur="5.46">learn all this crap not only that they</text>
  <text start="2585.16" dur="6.36">have to be many of the upper</text>
  <text start="2587.92" dur="7.86">salon slaves because I don&amp;#39;t you seem</text>
  <text start="2591.52" dur="5.67">because I love your titles I&amp;#39;m like oh I</text>
  <text start="2595.78" dur="3.15">want to know about this or I want to</text>
  <text start="2597.19" dur="4.379">know about this is you seem pretty much</text>
  <text start="2598.93" dur="9">on top of a lot of this stuff in your</text>
  <text start="2601.569" dur="11.941">reports but you know that they that he</text>
  <text start="2607.93" dur="7.53">was Jeffrey Epstein was experimenting</text>
  <text start="2613.51" dur="7.789">trying to create the perfect race of</text>
  <text start="2615.46" dur="11.659">people and so they do all this with the</text>
  <text start="2621.299" dur="7.871">bloodlines and the DNA stores memory and</text>
  <text start="2627.119" dur="4.601">information so that&amp;#39;s why they try to</text>
  <text start="2629.17" dur="5.129">keep their bloodline pure so that they</text>
  <text start="2631.72" dur="4.859">can pass this information down from</text>
  <text start="2634.299" dur="4.02">generation to generation and I also</text>
  <text start="2636.579" dur="5.191">think there&amp;#39;s more to it than that I</text>
  <text start="2638.319" dur="6.391">think they are perfecting cloning and</text>
  <text start="2641.77" dur="5.19">this type of thing and using the DNA so</text>
  <text start="2644.71" dur="6.26">that they can live longer and that they</text>
  <text start="2646.96" dur="8.67">have been working or perfected the</text>
  <text start="2650.97" dur="9.01">cloning you know process to this end but</text>
  <text start="2655.63" dur="7.28">it&amp;#39;s also that they can also I believe</text>
  <text start="2659.98" dur="10.079">that they believe they are contacting</text>
  <text start="2662.91" dur="10.09">the wise ones the wise evil ones spirits</text>
  <text start="2670.059" dur="5.161">if you will look whether you believe it</text>
  <text start="2673" dur="3.809">they&amp;#39;re really doing it or whether I</text>
  <text start="2675.22" dur="3">believe they&amp;#39;re really doing it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2676.809" dur="4.29">matter they believe they&amp;#39;re really doing</text>
  <text start="2678.22" dur="5.51">it this is a great quote just because if</text>

  <text start="2694.75" dur="4.049">getting anything out of it why the hell</text>
  <text start="2696.97" dur="4.29">would they do it they wouldn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="2698.799" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;re obviously contacting and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2701.26" dur="5.069">getting something in return but the</text>
  <text start="2703.39" dur="5.55">giving me the biggest sacrifice their</text>
  <text start="2706.329" dur="5.401">soul sorry about that</text>
  <text start="2708.94" dur="4.889">know what go ahead I was gonna say and</text>
  <text start="2711.73" dur="3.569">why would they be experimenting with all</text>
  <text start="2713.829" dur="3.51">of this stuff they have laboratories</text>
  <text start="2715.299" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ve got money they they could do</text>
  <text start="2717.339" dur="4.081">anything with that money they could buy</text>
  <text start="2718.809" dur="5.77">builder me they big builder man</text>
  <text start="2721.42" dur="5.619">build bigger mansions for themselves</text>
  <text start="2724.579" dur="4.29">they could go on more cruises they could</text>
  <text start="2727.039" dur="4.381">have more expensive jewelry no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2728.869" dur="6.21">underground experimenting with all this</text>
  <text start="2731.42" dur="8.069">stuff and I think this goes to their end</text>
  <text start="2735.079" dur="9.51">of creating a perfect satanic world</text>
  <text start="2739.489" dur="10.38">where they have these slaves that have</text>
  <text start="2744.589" dur="7.321">been you know designed you know and</text>
  <text start="2749.869" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re just practicing all this stuff</text>
  <text start="2751.91" dur="7.52">but I do believe this has been an</text>
  <text start="2753.859" dur="13.23">age-old goal of this bloodline of people</text>
  <text start="2759.43" dur="9.97">so or whatever and that they are passing</text>
  <text start="2767.089" dur="4.5">the information all this stuff on from</text>

  <text start="3751.22" dur="9.78">the center of the circle and the circle</text>
  <text start="3753.68" dur="9.419">is there to protect them from demons so</text>
  <text start="3761" dur="4.68">they begin to call up these demons right</text>
  <text start="3763.099" dur="5.73">but they cannot come on the inside of</text>
  <text start="3765.68" dur="6.659">the circle because the priestess who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3768.829" dur="6.54">calling up the demons is controlling</text>
  <text start="3772.339" dur="6.03">them and keeping them on the outside of</text>
  <text start="3775.369" dur="4.021">the circle and I I don&amp;#39;t know whether</text>

  <text start="3792.17" dur="3.99">doing it has to stay on the inside of</text>
  <text start="3794.51" dur="3.21">that circle because it but for some</text>
  <text start="3796.16" dur="2.76">reason they get pulled on the outside</text>
  <text start="3797.72" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ll die</text>
  <text start="3798.92" dur="5.34">the demons will kill them now so my next</text>
  <text start="3802.22" dur="3.42">question is well where are the demons</text>

  <text start="3827.36" dur="7.8">opening themselves up to the demons and</text>
  <text start="3830.9" dur="8.04">so they suddenly become inhabited by the</text>
  <text start="3835.16" dur="5.75">demons so they will kill the witch</text>
  <text start="3838.94" dur="4.08">because they don&amp;#39;t want to be controlled</text>
  <text start="3840.91" dur="3.25">they don&amp;#39;t want to be controlled they</text>
  <text start="3843.02" dur="2.73">want to do what they want to do they</text>

  <text start="4478.01" dur="5.63">around since the 1400s even you know I</text>
  <text start="4481.49" dur="5.94">mean this this is we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="4483.64" dur="5.8">multi-generational elites you know and</text>
  <text start="4487.43" dur="5.52">they have all the money they&amp;#39;ve hoarded</text>
  <text start="4489.44" dur="7.29">all the money whether they&amp;#39;re witchcraft</text>
  <text start="4492.95" dur="6.54">helped them in this I would say probably</text>
  <text start="4496.73" dur="4.98">it did even if you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="4499.49" dur="4.59">quantum physics you know if you want to</text>
  <text start="4501.71" dur="5.07">look at it that way that if they believe</text>
  <text start="4504.08" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s helping them and so therefore you</text>
  <text start="4506.78" dur="3.99">know they&amp;#39;re empowered by that belief</text>
  <text start="4508.58" dur="5.22">you can believe it that way I believe</text>
  <text start="4510.77" dur="5.1">that and it&amp;#39;s something that I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4513.8" dur="4.59">used to believe in but well I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4515.87" dur="5.52">know but I definitely believe in a</text>
  <text start="4518.39" dur="11.09">spiritual world now and I believe in</text>
  <text start="4521.39" dur="12.87">spiritual entities and these people who</text>
  <text start="4529.48" dur="8.98">like to play and contact these spiritual</text>
  <text start="4534.26" dur="7.26">entities and who are they believe</text>
  <text start="4538.46" dur="8.49">they&amp;#39;re working for their father Satan</text>
  <text start="4541.52" dur="7.74">Lucifer or or even a legion you know you</text>
  <text start="4546.95" dur="6.87">could call it Legion as well yes</text>
  <text start="4549.26" dur="6.99">absolutely but Neville enforce an evil</text>
  <text start="4553.82" dur="5.28">force more evil than even any of us</text>
  <text start="4556.25" dur="5.04">could ever know about and so evil that</text>
  <text start="4559.1" dur="4.38">all of these people like Anderson Cooper</text>
  <text start="4561.29" dur="4.14">like all of these people all of these</text>
  <text start="4563.48" dur="4.26">people what do you have to look at it</text>
  <text start="4565.43" dur="5.73">this way they&amp;#39;re in control of</text>
  <text start="4567.74" dur="7.68">everything they don&amp;#39;t trust a regular</text>
  <text start="4571.16" dur="6.24">person to go into a public office they</text>
  <text start="4575.42" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t want that they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="4577.4" dur="6.06">that by the time they get up to that</text>
  <text start="4579.92" dur="6.72">position they are completely under their</text>
  <text start="4583.46" dur="7.32">control if they&amp;#39;re not initiated through</text>
  <text start="4586.64" dur="7.079">the bloodline then they are blackmailed</text>
  <text start="4590.78" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re put into a blackmail situation</text>
  <text start="4593.719" dur="5.511">wrecked and I have this book it&amp;#39;s by</text>
  <text start="4597.38" dur="4.53">Fritz spring Meyer who was a</text>
  <text start="4599.23" dur="5.08">deprogrammer he&amp;#39;s deep program and</text>
  <text start="4601.91" dur="4.98">deprogramming a lot of these MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="4604.31" dur="6.36">victims and these escapees for decades</text>
  <text start="4606.89" dur="6.9">and he described it this way just like</text>
  <text start="4610.67" dur="5.52">you have an appearance where you have</text>
  <text start="4613.79" dur="4.5">the loominatee at the top and then you</text>
  <text start="4616.19" dur="4.59">have it all goes down and then we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4618.29" dur="5.4">underneath sure yeah that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="4620.78" dur="6.36">graphic they have the same thing with</text>
  <text start="4623.69" dur="5.88">their slaves their whole slave Asha line</text>
  <text start="4627.14" dur="4.559">and people like Anderson Cooper</text>
  <text start="4629.57" dur="5.97">they are the upper tiered slaves and</text>
  <text start="4631.699" dur="7.201">even when they go into their child</text>
  <text start="4635.54" dur="8.85">trafficking they have the children of</text>
  <text start="4638.9" dur="9.72">the elite are a special class of MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="4644.39" dur="7.829">slaves and they get a certain MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="4648.62" dur="7.86">and believe me all of it is horrific so</text>
  <text start="4652.219" dur="6.661">they go and they are split their</text>
  <text start="4656.48" dur="3.989">personalities are split and they are</text>
  <text start="4658.88" dur="3.569">controlled through these multiple</text>
  <text start="4660.469" dur="5.941">personalities and if you remember the</text>
  <text start="4662.449" dur="8.161">Rothschild ball from the 1970s a lot of</text>
  <text start="4666.41" dur="6.99">these people had multiple face masks you</text>
  <text start="4670.61" dur="4.56">know with with different faces or a face</text>
  <text start="4673.4" dur="5.31">on the back and a face on the front</text>
  <text start="4675.17" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re all programs all have wrecked</text>
  <text start="4678.71" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s very weird that they do that in</text>
  <text start="4681.86" dur="6.54">the horns they all had the faces and the</text>
  <text start="4683.75" dur="6.12">horns again I will bring in this you</text>
  <text start="4688.4" dur="2.64">continue on with that that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="4689.87" dur="3.63">interesting when you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="4691.04" dur="4.38">the two faces at the parties when you</text>
  <text start="4693.5" dur="5.31">think of these Rothschild parties it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4695.42" dur="6.509">very very weird what they are wearing</text>
  <text start="4698.81" dur="8.28">because they were all raised in the</text>
  <text start="4701.929" dur="7.801">MKULTRA system and the way Fritz spring</text>
  <text start="4707.09" dur="4.56">Meyer talks about this and you know our</text>
  <text start="4709.73" dur="3.48">German friends over there that came over</text>
  <text start="4711.65" dur="8.49">here after</text>
  <text start="4713.21" dur="10.56">or - they were pioneering this before</text>
  <text start="4720.14" dur="7.05">World War two and trying to come up with</text>
  <text start="4723.77" dur="5.19">the perfect you know they wanted a race</text>
  <text start="4727.19" dur="5.9">that they could control just like they</text>
  <text start="4728.96" dur="7.41">still do it&amp;#39;s the same bloodlines and</text>
  <text start="4733.09" dur="6.34">they had started this programming and</text>
  <text start="4736.37" dur="6.06">then of course we welcomed them in and</text>
  <text start="4739.43" dur="5.01">they had all the monies in the world all</text>
  <text start="4742.43" dur="5.039">of the facilities in the world to do</text>
  <text start="4744.44" dur="5.4">in-depth research and what they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="4747.469" dur="5.941">now it&amp;#39;s mind-blowing</text>
  <text start="4749.84" dur="6.78">and they pick these children and their</text>
  <text start="4753.41" dur="7.29">children small children because of their</text>
  <text start="4756.62" dur="5.46">aptitudes and because of their DNA see</text>
  <text start="4760.7" dur="2.97">this is another reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4762.08" dur="3.45">interested in the DNA they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="4763.67" dur="3.9">for people with certain aptitudes and</text>
  <text start="4765.53" dur="6.99">they know it is handed down through the</text>
  <text start="4767.57" dur="8.33">DNA and they&amp;#39;ll kidnap a kid you know to</text>
  <text start="4772.52" dur="7.64">take it down into the underground dumbs</text>
  <text start="4775.9" dur="8.29">they&amp;#39;ll kidnap a kid clone this kid and</text>
  <text start="4780.16" dur="8.14">start programming it and because they</text>
  <text start="4784.19" dur="8.37">want what they want they need they have</text>

  <text start="5465.18" dur="5.07">singing a lot of jazz and I absolutely</text>
  <text start="5466.71" dur="5.64">loved that so two of my period of my</text>
  <text start="5470.25" dur="3.81">life I&amp;#39;ve been completely confused about</text>
  <text start="5472.35" dur="4.86">religion and what you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="5474.06" dur="4.92">think and I believe right now obviously</text>
  <text start="5477.21" dur="4.16">I know that they are</text>
  <text start="5478.98" dur="4.77">Lilley corrupting this next generation</text>
  <text start="5481.37" dur="4.54">so basically it&amp;#39;s going to take ten it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5483.75" dur="5.13">going to take decades before between the</text>
  <text start="5485.91" dur="5.16">drugs to pull everything else gets put</text>
  <text start="5488.88" dur="3.6">back into how it used to be like back in</text>
  <text start="5491.07" dur="3.87">the 50s where everybody covered</text>
  <text start="5492.48" dur="4.56">themselves and they weren&amp;#39;t so open</text>
  <text start="5494.94" dur="6.26">about everything and there wasn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="5497.04" dur="7.92">kind of drug use that just goes on now</text>
  <text start="5501.2" dur="5.11">what&amp;#39;s your thoughts on that Lindy you</text>
  <text start="5504.96" dur="3.05">want to take this one you want to take</text>
  <text start="5506.31" dur="3.69">the thought of maybe that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="5508.01" dur="5.32">indoctrinated too many people and that</text>
  <text start="5510" dur="6.44">the the the process will take maybe</text>
  <text start="5513.33" dur="5.43">another generation to get out of it</text>
  <text start="5516.44" dur="6.4">thank you so much for the phone call man</text>
  <text start="5518.76" dur="7.17">I think that that goes completely to the</text>
  <text start="5522.84" dur="6.149">point is that they are trying to number</text>
  <text start="5525.93" dur="5.94">one confuse us about religion and about</text>
  <text start="5528.989" dur="5.941">you know the Bible and and God and</text>
  <text start="5531.87" dur="5.369">everything all of it they want to keep</text>
  <text start="5534.93" dur="4.77">they don&amp;#39;t want us to think that Satan</text>
  <text start="5537.239" dur="4.381">is real they don&amp;#39;t want us to think any</text>
  <text start="5539.7" dur="3.57">of their stuff is real because they want</text>
  <text start="5541.62" dur="5.01">the whole world to see god that&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="5543.27" dur="5.61">you know that way when people go and try</text>
  <text start="5546.63" dur="4.2">to report it so they want to keep us in</text>
  <text start="5548.88" dur="4.859">the dark but I think more to the point</text>
  <text start="5550.83" dur="7.01">they want to degenerate us and our</text>
  <text start="5553.739" dur="9.511">beings they want us to focus on lower</text>
  <text start="5557.84" dur="8.08">frequency things because that keeps us</text>
  <text start="5563.25" dur="5.46">asleep and they can do what they want to</text>
  <text start="5565.92" dur="6.51">do but also it keeps us spiritually from</text>
  <text start="5568.71" dur="6.66">knowing what&amp;#39;s possible correct from</text>
  <text start="5572.43" dur="5.25">knowing God you know and and I think</text>
  <text start="5575.37" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s a big reason why we&amp;#39;re here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5577.68" dur="4.8">here to get to know God you know</text>
  <text start="5580.56" dur="3.06">absolutely I agree with you and I</text>
  <text start="5582.48" dur="3.63">believe that the way that they</text>
  <text start="5583.62" dur="5.76">indoctrinate these kids into Nickelodeon</text>
  <text start="5586.11" dur="4.56">and the MTV and to just movies and</text>
  <text start="5589.38" dur="3.27">Hollywood and stuff like that is</text>
  <text start="5590.67" dur="4.65">basically they&amp;#39;re just building false</text>
  <text start="5592.65" dur="5.01">idols and that these false idols are</text>
  <text start="5595.32" dur="3">able to manipulate kids whose brains are</text>
  <text start="5597.66" dur="4.92">still growing</text>
  <text start="5598.32" dur="6.57">thus they grow into this entity the this</text>
  <text start="5602.58" dur="3.57">personality that&amp;#39;s not even theirs it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5604.89" dur="3.81">just something that they&amp;#39;re imitating</text>
  <text start="5606.15" dur="5.37">and it&amp;#39;s extremely negative because</text>

  <text start="7020.43" dur="4.65">about the fracturing of the</text>
  <text start="7022.11" dur="5.07">personalities it made me think of Ashton</text>
  <text start="7025.08" dur="5.1">Kutcher and someone in the chat had</text>
  <text start="7027.18" dur="6.48">brought up Ashton Kutcher and you know</text>
  <text start="7030.18" dur="6.48">he was involved in a case where a girl</text>
  <text start="7033.66" dur="5.22">he was dating got murdered and he just</text>
  <text start="7036.66" dur="4.71">happened to be like the last person at</text>
  <text start="7038.88" dur="5.55">her house so he had to testify and stuff</text>

  <text start="7054.63" dur="4.65">mentioned you know about Anderson Cooper</text>

  <text start="7059.28" dur="4.68">they really if they&amp;#39;re having their</text>
  <text start="7061.2" dur="7.14">personality split like this Kamiya</text>
  <text start="7063.96" dur="8.07">almost seems like it was probably Ashton</text>
  <text start="7068.34" dur="6.18">Kutcher&amp;#39;s personality that that are they</text>
  <text start="7072.03" dur="5.49">really aware of what they&amp;#39;re doing I</text>
  <text start="7074.52" dur="8.25">mean I think this awakening is for them</text>
  <text start="7077.52" dur="6.72">to to get out of that and realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
