  <text start="656.45" dur="5.19">launch of the Russian investigation what</text>
  <text start="658.64" dur="5.25">do you make of this well I should yeah</text>
  <text start="661.64" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m very curious since presumably I I</text>
  <text start="663.89" dur="3.03">guess I&amp;#39;m one of those under</text>
  <text start="666.23" dur="3.72">investigation</text>
  <text start="666.92" dur="7.35">and I and you just heard about this yes</text>
  <text start="669.95" dur="7.35">just you know read the clip on about 20</text>
  <text start="674.27" dur="6.9">minutes ago I found that the timing</text>
  <text start="677.3" dur="8.479">interesting given the increasing heat</text>
  <text start="681.17" dur="7.65">around the impeachment inquiry and so</text>
  <text start="685.779" dur="5.081">the time he&amp;#39;s interesting I&amp;#39;ll just let</text>
  <text start="688.82" dur="4.32">it go at that and the other thing I</text>
  <text start="690.86" dur="5.31">wonder about is whether we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="693.14" dur="6.23">about the overall investigation of the</text>
  <text start="696.17" dur="6.78">Russian reporting on the Russian</text>
  <text start="699.37" dur="5.29">interference or are we talking about the</text>
  <text start="702.95" dur="4.16">counterintelligence investigation that</text>
  <text start="704.66" dur="6.15">was launched in July by the by the FBI</text>

  <text start="718.97" dur="5.52">that prompted this do you have any idea</text>
  <text start="721.7" dur="4.53">even what they might think may rise to</text>
  <text start="724.49" dur="6.06">the level of a criminal offense no I</text>
  <text start="726.23" dur="7.349">don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s obviously an item in great</text>
  <text start="730.55" dur="5.88">interest to me what what is it any of us</text>
  <text start="733.579" dur="5.51">did that would rise the level of a</text>
  <text start="736.43" dur="5.399">criminal infraction I I just don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="739.089" dur="7.101">so guys as you can see James clapper</text>
  <text start="741.829" dur="6.31">looks to be terrified he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="746.19" dur="3.87">kind of you know swaying back and forth</text>
