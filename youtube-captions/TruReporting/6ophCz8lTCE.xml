  <text start="431.25" dur="4.08">in quote well that&amp;#39;s something to be</text>
  <text start="433.26" dur="3.93">discussed but then shifted to discussing</text>
  <text start="435.33" dur="3.75">the trump appointees who previously</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="4.62">testified before the House Intelligence</text>

  <text start="441.81" dur="5.13">another thing I that I touched on at the</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="6.33">very beginning of this podcast is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="7.229">very it&amp;#39;s very likely and we all know</text>
  <text start="450.57" dur="6.84">this that 17 is POTUS it could be you</text>

  <text start="461.9" dur="7.24">100% cooperating with POTUS and the</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="3.7">reason I say so is as soon as he leaves</text>
  <text start="469.14" dur="4.66">for a three-day</text>

  <text start="484.96" dur="4.56">Trump or trip codes that have been</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="6.96">updated and I believe that&amp;#39;s why we all</text>
