  <text start="558.88" dur="4.26">happen to them there&amp;#39;s a good reason to</text>
  <text start="561.339" dur="4.231">believe that an enforced death penalty</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="4.08">is a deterrent and saves innocent lives</text>
  <text start="565.57" dur="5.31">there is no proof of it</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="5.88">black murderers are no more likely to be</text>
