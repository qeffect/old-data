  <text start="286.77" dur="5.43">can see what that shortening is that</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="5.52">abbreviation the story broke I have been</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="5.04">saying it was designed operation</text>
  <text start="294.48" dur="6.3">targeting the Democrats somehow Trump</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="6.03">baited someone to leak to the WB a false</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="5.07">description of the call with Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="303.27" dur="4.8">president it seems the purpose was to</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="5.01">force the Democrats into a baseless</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="5.61">impeachment chase and open a national</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="4.8">conversation about Ukraine this then</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="5.25">becomes the catalyst to reveal the</text>
  <text start="315.66" dur="6.06">results of what I have termed phase 2</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="5.88">the prosecution phase of dealing with</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="5.699">the coup plotters and I believe that 17</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="5.4">has even talked about phase 1 phase 2 we</text>
  <text start="327.419" dur="4.5">get to phase 5 there is no phase 5 and</text>
  <text start="330.21" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ll bring that up later into the</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="5.25">podcast with the 17 drops that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="5.28">been getting lately continuing forward</text>
  <text start="337.169" dur="5.241">the prosecution phase of dealing with</text>
  <text start="339.78" dur="6.389">coup plotters I&amp;#39;ve had different ideas</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="5.53">about who leaked we know who the WB did</text>
  <text start="346.169" dur="4.381">not have the first-hand knowledge so</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="4.74">someone leaked it to him at first I</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="4.619">speculated it could have been a whisper</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="6.45">campaign in the presence of a previously</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="6.841">known WH leaker White House then when</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="6.24">the second WB story broke I speculated</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="4.23">it was a fellow CA agent assigned to the</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="3.81">White House</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="5.519">or some purpose for some purpose but</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="5.4">admittedly this was still an area of</text>
  <text start="371.759" dur="5.101">uncertainty the leaker had to be someone</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="4.11">so credible that the Democrats would</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.47">launch into action assuming the</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="4.979">information was accurate makes complete</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="4.38">sense guys on Monday</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="4.381">Fiona Hill gave testimony to Adams</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="4.709">shifts Inquisition she testified that</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="4.32">Bolton told her over the summer that he</text>
  <text start="390.419" dur="4.141">wanted Giuliani referred to the White</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="4.769">House attorneys because he in quote</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="4.979">wanted no part of the effort and as a</text>
  <text start="397.139" dur="5.101">result more scrutiny turned to Bolton as</text>
  <text start="399.539" dur="5.22">the leaker I hadn&amp;#39;t I hadn&amp;#39;t explored</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.35">that idea too much because I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="404.759" dur="4.44">want to buy that Bolton wants to hurt</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="5.52">Trump then earlier today someone shared</text>
  <text start="409.199" dur="4.56">a video with me on YouTube and this will</text>
  <text start="412.11" dur="4.739">be in the description box below if you</text>
  <text start="413.759" dur="5.671">want to watch it he basically lays it</text>
  <text start="416.849" dur="4.021">out for you to be clear I only watched</text>
  <text start="419.43" dur="3.81">the first five minutes where they were</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="4.229">discussing Bolton being the leaker I am</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="4.38">not endorsing either of the two people</text>
  <text start="425.099" dur="4.021">in this video or any of their ideas but</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="3.66">I thought it was important to explain</text>
  <text start="429.12" dur="4.229">how I ended go ended up going down the</text>
  <text start="431.28" dur="5.1">rabbit hole I&amp;#39;m about to share with you</text>
  <text start="433.349" dur="5.611">what I will say is that mister shipp was</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="5.19">sufficiently persuasive that it made me</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="4.17">start thinking mr shipp is the person in</text>
  <text start="441.57" dur="4.29">this video right here above us</text>
  <text start="443.13" dur="5.73">why would bolton speak to someone so</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="5.549">clearly anti-trump as Fiona Hill and</text>
  <text start="448.86" dur="4.22">push the idea that Giuliani was doing</text>
  <text start="451.409" dur="5.31">something inappropriate in the summer</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="6.61">presumably this preceded the July 25th</text>
  <text start="456.719" dur="5.371">call with ukrainian President you Lenski</text>
  <text start="459.69" dur="5.49">well either he was authentically</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="4.889">concerned or it was bait like chumming</text>
  <text start="465.18" dur="4.5">the waters for anyone with fishing</text>
  <text start="466.979" dur="4.47">experience since mr. Schiff had</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="3.539">mentioned that Laura Ingraham had</text>
  <text start="471.449" dur="3.871">discussed Bolton being the leaker I</text>
  <text start="473.219" dur="4.98">figured I would search Twitter to find a</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="4.86">clip I typed Ingram Bolton into the</text>
  <text start="478.199" dur="5.371">search and a very interesting article</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="7.079">popped up it was written by at Jonathan</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="6.689">V Swan at Axios and it is entitled</text>
  <text start="487.259" dur="5.071">exclusive leaked trump vetting documents</text>
  <text start="490.259" dur="4.47">somehow I missed this story but</text>
  <text start="492.33" dur="4.709">immediately triggered my thinking Trump</text>
  <text start="494.729" dur="4.711">is infamous for leaking information that</text>
  <text start="497.039" dur="3.1">most would consider damaging what do we</text>
  <text start="499.44" dur="3.37">have here</text>
  <text start="500.139" dur="4.65">a treasure trove of information on all</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="4.74">of the people that were vetted during</text>
  <text start="504.789" dur="6.12">the transition in effect dishing the</text>
  <text start="507.55" dur="4.95">dirt on everyone in Trump world but I</text>
  <text start="510.909" dur="3.541">was looking for information that could</text>
  <text start="512.5" dur="4.979">persuade me that Bolton was the leaker</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="5.219">so what did I find well along with this</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="4.321">article came links to each person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.669" dur="3.93">vetting document you will never guess</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="5.4">whose vetting document was included in</text>
  <text start="523.599" dur="7.11">this trove yup John Bolton here were the</text>
  <text start="527.2" dur="5.249">two top items and we see here Bolton was</text>
  <text start="530.709" dur="3.961">critical of Trump&amp;#39;s remarks on NATO</text>
  <text start="532.449" dur="3.75">calling them and in quote a dagger at</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="3.9">the heart of the most successful</text>
  <text start="536.199" dur="5.101">military political alliance in human</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="5.19">history and urged Trump to retract his</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="5.729">remarks Bolton said what Trump said</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="4.949">about Aragon in his statements to the</text>
  <text start="547.029" dur="4.081">New York Times was in quote very</text>
  <text start="548.709" dur="4.051">troubling the information was</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="4.11">interesting but what I found more</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="4.949">interesting was the timing remember we</text>
  <text start="555.22" dur="4.29">found out from Fiona Hill testimony that</text>
  <text start="557.709" dur="3.361">in the summer bolton was telling her</text>
  <text start="559.51" dur="4.949">that he wanted nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="5.509">Giuliani summer so just preceding that</text>
  <text start="564.459" dur="5.971">conversation the waters were chummed</text>
  <text start="566.579" dur="7.091">Bolton has issues with Trump a dagger at</text>
  <text start="570.43" dur="5.73">the heart very troubling now the idea</text>
  <text start="573.67" dur="4.26">Bolton was the leaker as part of a bait</text>
  <text start="576.16" dur="4.799">trap strategy had my full attention</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="5.46">there are no coincidences so I kept</text>
  <text start="580.959" dur="4.56">searching first thing I did was look for</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="4.77">the Engram clip referring to mr. Shipp</text>
  <text start="585.519" dur="5.791">but I also found the clip from the night</text>
  <text start="588.16" dur="5.7">bolton quit / got fired being quote</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="6.24">firing and the ingram episode happened</text>

  <text start="1524.82" dur="5.78">as we could see here pulao seized press</text>
  <text start="1527.909" dur="5.851">event began precisely at 7:00 p.m. p.m.</text>
  <text start="1530.6" dur="6.25">initially sands shift and instead of</text>
  <text start="1533.76" dur="4.11">updating reports and impeachment Pelosi</text>
  <text start="1536.85" dur="3.57">spoke about a mere</text>
  <text start="1537.87" dur="4.47">period of other subjects efforts to</text>
  <text start="1540.42" dur="4.83">reduce the cost of prescription drugs</text>

  <text start="1549.96" dur="4.11">barely said anything about the</text>
  <text start="1551.37" dur="4.26">impeachment until Schiff arrived only it</text>
  <text start="1554.07" dur="4.92">wouldn&amp;#39;t be Pelosi addressing the</text>
  <text start="1555.63" dur="5.45">appeasement Pelosi would yield to Schiff</text>

  <text start="1561.08" dur="5.65">actions leaked louder than words</text>
  <text start="1563.79" dur="6.03">Pelosi then walked off the days leaving</text>
  <text start="1566.73" dur="5.22">shift at the lectern Pelosi took a seat</text>
  <text start="1569.82" dur="4.68">in the front row of the radio TV gallery</text>
  <text start="1571.95" dur="5.25">studio amid the reporters to listen to</text>
  <text start="1574.5" dur="5.22">shift all she lacked was a notebook in a</text>
  <text start="1577.2" dur="4.95">tape recorder there are a lot of ways to</text>
  <text start="1579.72" dur="4.38">read Pelosi decision to defer to shift</text>
  <text start="1582.15" dur="5.1">it was almost to indicate that</text>
  <text start="1584.1" dur="6.12">impeachment was under shifts silo in his</text>
  <text start="1587.25" dur="4.95">only congressional leaders frequently</text>
  <text start="1590.22" dur="4.44">have liked to cede power to their</text>
  <text start="1592.2" dur="4.32">committee chairs or at least give the</text>
  <text start="1594.66" dur="2.399">illusion of seating power to committee</text>
  <text start="1596.52" dur="3.39">chairs</text>
  <text start="1597.059" dur="5.161">perhaps the speaker was distancing</text>
  <text start="1599.91" dur="3.63">herself from impeachment or indicating</text>
  <text start="1602.22" dur="2.93">that the house would conduct its</text>

  <text start="1609.78" dur="4.71">Pelosi decision to sit in the front row</text>
  <text start="1612.09" dur="5.4">as a way to divorce yourself from the</text>
