  <text start="416.44" dur="4.56">like Dante Gabriel Rossetti but</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="3.81">photographs of children dominate his</text>

  <text start="422.86" dur="3.24">troublesome pictures</text>
  <text start="424" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s one that unnerved the BBC</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="5.28">experts particularly it is an image of a</text>

  <text start="450.82" dur="4.35">little the little girl who inspired the</text>
  <text start="452.62" dur="4.17">famous Alice character my understanding</text>
  <text start="455.17" dur="3.39">is that he was in love with Alice but he</text>
  <text start="456.79" dur="3.99">was so repressed that he never would</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="3.93">have transgressed any boundaries says</text>
  <text start="460.78" dur="4.59">Vanessa Tate great-granddaughter of</text>
  <text start="462.49" dur="5.34">Alice Liddell in the documentary she</text>
  <text start="465.37" dur="4.47">adds that the explicit photograph may</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="5.67">explain the rift that made Carol break</text>
  <text start="469.84" dur="5.04">contact with Liddell girls in 1863 when</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="3.95">Alice was 11 years old</text>

  <text start="487.6" dur="4.62">this wasn&amp;#39;t the only time he would do</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="5.07">this after the falling out with the</text>

  <text start="494.47" dur="5.49">young girls such as Beatrice hatch whom</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="6.6">he sketched nude in 1873 so we can click</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="6.48">on that it&amp;#39;s not offensive this is the</text>
  <text start="503.5" dur="4.26">picture right here Beatrice hatch it is</text>
  <text start="506.44" dur="4.08">offensive but there&amp;#39;s nothing and</text>
  <text start="507.76" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s no nudity or anything like that</text>
  <text start="510.52" dur="4.8">meaning node like genitals and whatnot</text>
  <text start="512.77" dur="4.26">apology if that link offends I debated</text>
  <text start="515.32" dur="3.33">whether I should include that link or</text>
  <text start="517.03" dur="3.449">not but ended up including it because</text>
  <text start="518.65" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s an ancient sketch not a photograph</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="4.771">and it&amp;#39;s been in the public domain for</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="4.56">150 years but the excuse was that this</text>
  <text start="525.25" dur="4.17">was all just innocent and perfectly</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="5.04">natural like the admiration of sheriffs</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="4.47">or whatever and again this was all done</text>
  <text start="532.09" dur="3.69">with knowledge of the parents</text>
  <text start="533.89" dur="4.94">Beatrice along with her sisters were</text>

  <text start="557.26" dur="4.019">it&amp;#39;s but I think it&amp;#39;s perfectly clear to</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="2.58">everyone here that this was anything but</text>
  <text start="561.279" dur="2.641">innocent</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="4.14">there was a repeated pattern of behavior</text>
