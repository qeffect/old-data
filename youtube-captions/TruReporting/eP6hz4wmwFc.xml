  <text start="524.91" dur="4.97">because the war on conservative voices</text>

  <text start="535.44" dur="5.13">know that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about what I</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="4.32">call the slaughter meter Adams started</text>
  <text start="540.57" dur="3.66">in the video the slaughter meter is a</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="3.3">measure of how the election will go and</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="3.599">whether President Trump will win by a</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="4.409">smaller slaughter or a large slaughter</text>
  <text start="547.829" dur="4.26">and I update it based on the current</text>
  <text start="550.079" dur="3.841">events so it&amp;#39;s not really a prediction</text>
  <text start="552.089" dur="4.201">it&amp;#39;s more like a moment in time in which</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="4.32">the current conditions if they were to</text>
  <text start="556.29" dur="4.68">continue until the end would give you</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="5.49">that result he continues but of course</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="4.739">things that always change things always</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="4.02">change so it&amp;#39;s not a prediction it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="565.709" dur="3.931">just sort of if nothing changed this is</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="3.029">where you would end up that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="569.64" dur="3.15">interesting I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind looking at</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="3.901">that I have downgraded the slaughter</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="4.32">meter from one hundred and forty percent</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="4.56">where I said to myself the competition</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="3.87">for the presidency is so weak that I</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="3.9">couldn&amp;#39;t imagine any situation other</text>
  <text start="580.98" dur="5.07">than Trump dominating the election I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="583.14" dur="4.74">reset that to zero so at my current</text>
  <text start="586.05" dur="4.17">thinking is that the president has no</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="4.53">chance of reelection now remember the</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="4.29">slaughter meter is if nothing changes</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="3.35">but of course things will change so you</text>
  <text start="594.51" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about this</text>
  <text start="595.76" dur="3.939">necessarily will be the condition on</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="4.589">election day but the current situation</text>
  <text start="599.699" dur="5.341">would give him no chance that&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="602.699" dur="4.921">like that even goes into talking about</text>
  <text start="605.04" dur="5.039">the online censorship conservatives</text>
