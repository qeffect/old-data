  <text start="203.47" dur="5.43">Navy out in the middle of the desert</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="6.22">then we scroll up here and we see what</text>
  <text start="208.9" dur="5.489">the f is this this is from Google Earth</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="4.83">this is the epicenter right here this is</text>
  <text start="214.389" dur="5.311">where the the earthquake took place and</text>
  <text start="216.67" dur="5.86">then we see this smooth out legitimate</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="5.5">complete circle</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="5.61">so this is an old article but it ties in</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="5.25">directly with what we are talking about</text>
  <text start="228.14" dur="4.86">net says here California coast reveals</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="4.8">an underwater entrance to an alien base</text>
  <text start="233" dur="3.78">again take it for what it&amp;#39;s worth but</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="5.04">from the rabbit holes that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="5.79">down is it so outlandish to think that</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="6.419">this couldn&amp;#39;t be possible so again and</text>
  <text start="242.57" dur="7.77">this is an underwater 3d version of what</text>
  <text start="246.709" dur="6.271">is I believe underneath that spot a huge</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="4.619">submerged underwater entrance has been</text>
  <text start="252.98" dur="6.03">discovered off the Malibu California</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="6.301">coast at Point Dume this entrance has</text>
  <text start="259.01" dur="4.26">been at the forefront of UFO Watchers</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="5.52">lists they have been looking for the</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="4.98">shelter for at least the fad the past 40</text>
  <text start="266.78" dur="3.75">years</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="6.24">it says here underwater alien base found</text>
  <text start="270.53" dur="7.32">the structure is 1.3 miles by 2.4 miles</text>
  <text start="274.49" dur="5.67">wide and about 6.66 miles from land</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="5.069">that&amp;#39;s a weird number the opening</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="6.96">between and the support columns is about</text>
  <text start="282.919" dur="6.931">almost 2,800 feet wide and 630 feet tall</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="5.43">it is possible that the structure also</text>
  <text start="289.85" dur="5.97">has a nuclear bomb proof ceiling that</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="5.46">seems to be around 500 feet thick this</text>
  <text start="295.82" dur="4.95">location was found by Maxwell Dale</text>
  <text start="298.01" dur="4.68">Romero and Jimmy Church conspiracy</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="4.709">theorists remember that is what the CIA</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="5.67">likes to label people and network</text>
  <text start="305.479" dur="4.771">leaders the the supposed base has been a</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="4.83">target of the conspiracy communities</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="5.28">when hundreds of UFO and USO sightings</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="6.09">and many photographers of the sightings</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="6.15">in this area until now there was no hope</text>
  <text start="319.28" dur="4.38">of finding the entrance the entrance is</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="5.04">large enough that could be housing</text>
  <text start="323.66" dur="7.02">nuclear sized submarines and massive US</text>

  <text start="330.68" dur="5.82">more famous for those who reside in it</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="5.58">not for its alien occurrences sources</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="4.11">show however that California and the</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="5.28">surrounding desert like areas have a</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="5.4">high concentration of alien activity the</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="4.62">fact that this interest is on the coast</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="4.2">of California is no surprise to those</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="4.17">who are familiar with the sightings and</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="5.01">abductions this area is riddled with</text>
  <text start="352.64" dur="3.27">them this discovery is not surprising to</text>
  <text start="355.22" dur="2.43">those familiar</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="4.68">with the situation but it is however</text>
  <text start="357.65" dur="6.18">mildly terrifying with an entrance that</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="6.39">large and the built-in bomb-proof walls</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="5.43">the real the real question is what is</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="5.34">hidden inside also the fact that</text>
  <text start="369.26" dur="4.86">extraterrestrials life felt the need to</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="4.14">shelter themselves from humans is</text>
  <text start="374.12" dur="4.11">terrifying they may be working with the</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="4.11">United States government but under what</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="5.07">means the technology that they have is</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="5.46">unimaginable to common human minds and</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="4.74">is only saying to wonder what they might</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="3.57">be hiding alright guys here&amp;#39;s a better</text>
  <text start="388.04" dur="4.26">look at it this is remember this is only</text>

  <text start="392.3" dur="4.5">number from the coast this is underwater</text>
  <text start="394.91" dur="5.51">you can see the coast here it&amp;#39;s right</text>

  <text start="459.83" dur="3">that way too</text>
  <text start="460.37" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;d um and it gives the coordinates</text>
  <text start="462.83" dur="4.02">right here so we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="4.17">remember this is right there where these</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="4.98">earth earthquakes took place literally</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="4.92">not even 50 miles from where it took</text>
  <text start="471.83" dur="4.41">place again here is a better look for</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="6.15">you as we can see how close this is to</text>
  <text start="476.24" dur="5.25">the shore going right in right it&amp;#39;s wide</text>
  <text start="480.23" dur="5.18">enough that you can have nuclear</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="6.11">submarines go in also housing probably</text>
  <text start="485.41" dur="5.52">tons of people under there who knows</text>
  <text start="487.6" dur="5.37">what lives underneath in these military</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="5.18">bases these underground military bases</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s quite interesting to say the least</text>
  <text start="496.11" dur="4.86">it all started in the 18th century with</text>
  <text start="498.97" dur="4.68">the Scotsman named James Clerk Maxwell</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="4.51">he was a mathematical genius and his</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="4.2">work led to the development of quantum</text>

  <text start="507.85" dur="5.999">relativity Maxwell&amp;#39;s equations linked</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="3.84">electricity and magnetism and he</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="4.741">discovered other waves that were higher</text>
  <text start="515.47" dur="5.58">than the normal Hertzian electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="518.59" dur="4.29">waves they are positioned at right</text>

  <text start="532.6" dur="4.77">they are also called grow Vinick waves</text>
  <text start="535.21" dur="4.89">because they belong to the gravitational</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="4.38">field please see the glossary for the</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="3.92">other names of scalar waves and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="4.83">very familiar with scalar waves right</text>
  <text start="544.02" dur="5.11">Maxwell&amp;#39;s electromagnetic spectrum went</text>
  <text start="546.58" dur="4.14">higher than our 3d physical reality and</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="4.08">into hyperspace</text>
  <text start="550.72" dur="5.7">where the fine indiscernible scalar</text>

  <text start="566.83" dur="5.25">hence finer than x-ray and gamma rays</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="4.26">they can also be manipulated into</text>
  <text start="572.08" dur="4.14">various types of modes and frequencies</text>
