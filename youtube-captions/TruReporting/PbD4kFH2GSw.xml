  <text start="283.32" dur="5.13">off the lights turn off the lights</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="5.73">equals think of laughing thinking of</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="4.47">laughing then he smiles Trump is saying</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="4.38">of course I have no confidence in the</text>
  <text start="292.92" dur="4.86">intelligence agencies hearing myself say</text>
  <text start="295.35" dur="5.16">I do makes me want to laugh you got it</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="4.89">let&amp;#39;s try another in this video Trump</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="5.16">says in a key sentence in my remarks I</text>
  <text start="302.67" dur="4.4">say the word would instead of wouldn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="305.67" dur="5.01">know you all saw that press conference</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="6.22">the sentence should have been I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="5.34">see any reason why I wouldn&amp;#39;t or why it</text>
  <text start="313.29" dur="5.4">wouldn&amp;#39;t be Russia sort of a double</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="4.41">negative so you could put that in and I</text>
  <text start="318.69" dur="4.14">think that probably clarifies things</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="4.53">pretty good by itself did you catch what</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="4.98">he is really saying so you could put</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="5.85">that in so you could put that in who</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="5.1">where Trump knows the fake news media</text>
  <text start="330.81" dur="4.47">has no interest in the truth and will</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="4.56">certainly not archive it do you think</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="4.77">Trump all of a sudden cares about what</text>
  <text start="337.47" dur="5.43">the MSM understands and keeps from him</text>
  <text start="340.05" dur="5.64">no he is talking to us he is saying I</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="5.07">want to clarify a point that I know is</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="7.59">of interest to you the American people</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="7.02">once I clarify it put it in and and add</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.08">it to the other points I have already</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="4.8">made since my great fall speech you got</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="4.5">it now ask yourself why isn&amp;#39;t Trump even</text>
  <text start="359.79" dur="4.43">more explicit since he is clarifying</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="5.49">wouldn&amp;#39;t it be more powerful and</text>
  <text start="364.22" dur="6.49">unequivocal to say would not instead of</text>
  <text start="367.35" dur="6.15">wouldn&amp;#39;t why is he using in tea instead</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="6.15">of not because he wants us to focus on</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="6.24">in tea what is in tea expand your</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.74">thinking Windows NT is a family of</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="5.73">operating systems produced by Mac</text>
  <text start="381.6" dur="6.06">Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 was the first</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="4.35">version of the operating system that was</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="5.79">intended for workstations in servers</text>
  <text start="389.82" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s the latest version its latest</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="5.97">version is known under the name Windows</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="5.4">Server 2016 through this input Trump has</text>
  <text start="399.42" dur="2.91">put to rest</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="3.63">start laughing just because I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="3.63">excited Trump has put to rest all</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="5.94">speculations regarding the</text>
  <text start="405.96" dur="6.95">interpretation of mirror in the q1 675</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="4.83">riddle he is saying yes the server</text>
  <text start="412.91" dur="5.17">interpretation is also correct</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="3.81">I am validating it add it to what you</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="5.52">already know</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="7.95">think Q 666 think mirror which team they</text>
  <text start="423.6" dur="7.32">don&amp;#39;t know Apache you now see the power</text>
  <text start="427.11" dur="5.67">of q1 675 I told you it&amp;#39;s like a TV set</text>
  <text start="430.92" dur="4.11">through which you understand the news</text>
  <text start="432.78" dur="4.83">this gives me the opportunity to address</text>
  <text start="435.03" dur="4.89">a very important question sometimes an</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="5.37">ins asked me to share my views about the</text>
  <text start="439.92" dur="5.55">hypotheses and complain my responses are</text>
  <text start="442.98" dur="4.41">vague and not definitive the reason is</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="4.5">at the time they asked the question even</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="6.83">though I find the hypotheses hypotheses</text>
  <text start="449.97" dur="7.86">very aesthetically or rhetoric ly</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="5.44">attractive the riddle does not give a</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="4.14">strong link to the hypotheses I</text>
  <text start="459.66" dur="4.59">therefore remain silent until Trump or Q</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="4.77">gives more information to confirm the</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="6.15">validity the validity of the hypotheses</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="5.76">example when I said b2 Trump said Oregon</text>
  <text start="470.4" dur="4.65">when I said Hammond any part in the</text>
  <text start="472.5" dur="6">Hammonds going from b2 to Hammond wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="5.79">impossible for me because b2 is a note</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="4.32">any instrument can play Trump had to</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="4.62">validate it this is why he gave the</text>
  <text start="482.82" dur="5.37">missing link organ like many other</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="6.18">Anton&amp;#39;s I saw mirror was related to a</text>
  <text start="488.19" dur="5.37">mirrored server but making the link was</text>
  <text start="491.64" dur="4.74">not allowed by the riddle it would have</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="5.73">been a very weak link now Trump coming</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="5.85">and saying NT is enough to bring in the</text>
  <text start="499.29" dur="5.55">server side but there is more trunk</text>
  <text start="502.23" dur="5.25">further solidifies this link he also</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="8.28">says in quote sort of a double negative</text>
  <text start="507.48" dur="9.21">initials s DN rearrange DNS domain name</text>
  <text start="513.12" dur="4.95">server indeed we are in server territory</text>
  <text start="516.69" dur="4.26">confirmed resolved</text>
  <text start="518.07" dur="5.64">now that POTUS himself has validated the</text>
  <text start="520.95" dur="5.82">server we can add another tangent to the</text>
  <text start="523.71" dur="8.57">q1 675 riddle and draw the following</text>
  <text start="526.77" dur="5.51">image rip red clockwise okay</text>
  <text start="532.57" dur="6.42">in the key sentence in my remarks I said</text>
  <text start="535.42" dur="5.55">that the word that word instead would</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="3.63">instead of wouldn&amp;#39;t sorry guys the</text>
  <text start="540.97" dur="3.54">sentence should have been I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="542.62" dur="6.06">any reason why I wouldn&amp;#39;t or why it</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="6.98">wouldn&amp;#39;t be Russia in TNT sort of a</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="7.59">double negative okay</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="6.73">SD in so you could put that in and think</text>
  <text start="556.27" dur="3.84">that probably clarifies things pretty</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="4.95">good by itself president Donald Trump</text>
