  <text start="272.84" dur="5.49">we know Obama was in on it because on</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="5.79">numerous pieces of information for</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="5.13">starters we now know that Obama spied on</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="4.44">numerous people for years while he was</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="4.68">President Obama took the US intelligence</text>
