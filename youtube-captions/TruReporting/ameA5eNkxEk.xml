  <text start="284.36" dur="6.25">Frederic Brennan noted on Twitter but he</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="5.25">and myself mistakenly referred to by the</text>
  <text start="290.61" dur="4.619">document provided below by a number of</text>
  <text start="292.889" dur="5.431">terms Brennan is correct when he says</text>
  <text start="295.229" dur="5.461">that in fact the document is a criminal</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="5.31">complaint which is something that may or</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="6.9">may not lead to a criminal indictment in</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="5.94">ultimately a criminal trial as such the</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="4.77">article has been updated to reflect this</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="5.879">that&amp;#39;s here well folks it seems like the</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="5.73">Watkins family family Jim Watkins the</text>
  <text start="315.449" dur="5.431">current owner a true patriot someone who</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="5.46">actually I just watching his live videos</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="5.67">you saw spoken just very genuine just</text>
  <text start="323.55" dur="4.799">seems like a great person it has finally</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="3.75">hit back at Frederick Brennan after</text>
  <text start="328.349" dur="4.561">Brennan&amp;#39;s relentless efforts to</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="4.92">repeatedly deep platform their new</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="5.009">websites across multiple vendors have</text>
  <text start="335.22" dur="5.669">come to a head and why would they want</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="5.851">to deep platform 8 a coon at this point</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s because Frederick Brennan is no</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="3.959">longer a patriot he has been blackmailed</text>
  <text start="346.139" dur="4.111">obviously he&amp;#39;s probably done some bad</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="4.971">things on the side and they got ahold of</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="6.23">him and and by they I mean</text>
  <text start="352.7" dur="6.09">the deep state so as we can see here</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s Frederick&amp;#39;s in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="358.79" dur="4.8">guys he&amp;#39;s in a lot of a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="8.04">and it it&amp;#39;s rightfully so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="7.17">rightfully so that this guy be given an</text>
  <text start="368.6" dur="4.95">indictment because he&amp;#39;s actually slowing</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="6.57">up the process of getting 17 back on the</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="5.33">boards direct communication with us what</text>
