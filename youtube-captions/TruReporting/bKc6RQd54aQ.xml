  <text start="7.46" dur="5.23">hello friends and welcome it is December</text>
  <text start="10.2" dur="5.16">7th and on today&amp;#39;s podcast we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="12.69" dur="5.849">discussing these strange seismic waves</text>
  <text start="15.36" dur="5.88">not due to earthquakes most of these</text>
  <text start="18.539" dur="6.091">waves and tsunamis occur during a</text>
  <text start="21.24" dur="4.049">seismic shift within the plates of the</text>
  <text start="24.63" dur="2.52">earth</text>
  <text start="25.289" dur="4.23">but that&amp;#39;s not the case they&amp;#39;re too</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="4.77">perfect to be natural those strange</text>
  <text start="29.519" dur="6.151">seismic waves we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="31.92" dur="6.36">about this today a lot of a lot of</text>
  <text start="35.67" dur="4.59">things are happening in our world we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="3.57">seeing people try and take over the</text>
  <text start="40.26" dur="4.29">government this is a revolution in</text>
  <text start="41.85" dur="5.4">France and Mexico and other places even</text>
  <text start="44.55" dur="5.25">in America we know about globalism our</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="5.19">consciousness is expanding we are</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="5.16">changing the planet that we live on we</text>
  <text start="52.44" dur="5.459">are changing the reality that we subside</text>
  <text start="54.96" dur="5.579">in and I believe that this has something</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="6.271">to do with everything I believe that the</text>
  <text start="60.539" dur="6.601">earth is also changing I believe that it</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="4.89">is alive everything on this planet is</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="3.299">alive so why wouldn&amp;#39;t the earth be alive</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="3.27">well I wouldn&amp;#39;t play it it&amp;#39;s me alive</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="4.231">it&amp;#39;s something to look at and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="7.52">been talked about within the scientific</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="7.11">community now with that being said I</text>
  <text start="79.85" dur="5.23">understand that a lot of people may</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="5.31">disagree with this but I truly believe</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="6.6">in this and I think that we are</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="8.099">definitely on a path to a higher</text>
  <text start="91.68" dur="7.2">consciousness level a better life for</text>
  <text start="95.189" dur="7.341">all of us a Christ consciousness level</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="6.93">is what we are in the wake of I believe</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="6.43">and with that being said if you are new</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="5.55">to my channel please go ahead and click</text>
  <text start="108.96" dur="4.17">that blue bell so when I post you&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="3.84">notifications and you&amp;#39;ll be the first to</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="4.199">know when I do post also please follow</text>

  <text start="119.49" dur="4.05">this video receives the more times that</text>
  <text start="121.53" dur="3.93">it is recommended to other people thus</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="3.96">more eyes on the truth so with that</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="4.889">being said let&amp;#39;s hop into it this is</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="5.01">true reporting so this came out two days</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="3.481">ago too perfect to be natural those</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="5.43">strange seismic wave</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="5.64">my inbox has been very flooded with so</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="2.88">many different versions of this story I</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t know where to begin</text>

  <text start="145.02" dur="5.19">story has now rippled around the world</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="6.42">from its point of origin Madagascar to</text>
  <text start="150.21" dur="5.52">the Antipodes and back again more times</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="4.26">in the seismic waves themselves but this</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="4.11">story is truly strange</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="5.22">and since we&amp;#39;re into strange stuff on</text>

  <text start="210.26" dur="5.02">one of the leading theories at this</text>

  <text start="283.08" dur="6.3">is how even spaced out they were I have</text>
  <text start="286.29" dur="5.01">no idea how to explain it the article</text>

  <text start="291.3" dur="4.26">are going with the volcano theory and</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="3.72">that they plan to survey the ocean floor</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="4.59">in the region to see if there are any</text>
  <text start="297" dur="5.73">clues that the event might have been</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="4.74">volcanic in nature that probably is the</text>

  <text start="317.7" dur="6.09">and quietly talking amongst themselves</text>
