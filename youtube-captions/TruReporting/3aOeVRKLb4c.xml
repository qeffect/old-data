  <text start="1254.06" dur="3.83">the general master key which essentially</text>
  <text start="1256.25" dur="4.02">is the real key to the kingdom</text>
  <text start="1257.89" dur="5.08">interesting thing about this lock was</text>
  <text start="1260.27" dur="6.15">that my master did not open it it looked</text>
  <text start="1262.97" dur="6.63">I look closer and it was a best lock but</text>
  <text start="1266.42" dur="4.32">the inscription said CC on it which I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1281.27" dur="5.07">it it&amp;#39;s amazing how trash works this way</text>
  <text start="1283.76" dur="4.92">into odd places I&amp;#39;m going to figure out</text>
  <text start="1286.34" dur="4.14">where these kids went I rode the boat</text>
  <text start="1288.68" dur="4.86">back out to the platform and went back</text>
  <text start="1290.48" dur="5.61">to the EPCOT security office to play</text>
  <text start="1293.54" dur="4.8">back some footage from the DVR it took</text>
  <text start="1296.09" dur="4.08">me a while but I zeroed in on the period</text>
  <text start="1298.34" dur="4.56">where the kids entered the land and the</text>
  <text start="1300.17" dur="5.04">sea pavillion and I followed them there</text>
  <text start="1302.9" dur="4.62">were four kids total three girls and one</text>
  <text start="1305.21" dur="5.06">boy the girls actions were almost</text>
  <text start="1307.52" dur="5.43">robotic and it sent chills up my spine</text>
  <text start="1310.27" dur="4.63">they walked in a straight line through</text>
  <text start="1312.95" dur="4.65">the pavilion but what scared me was</text>
  <text start="1314.9" dur="5.16">there was a man with them escorting them</text>
  <text start="1317.6" dur="3.96">through the place I paused him look</text>
  <text start="1320.06" dur="3.99">closer and I realized the man was</text>
  <text start="1321.56" dur="6.06">wearing a black polo and khakis the same</text>
  <text start="1324.05" dur="5.58">thing I was wearing holy crap I even</text>

  <text start="1342.25" dur="5.94">on the tour of the botanic Botanic lab</text>
  <text start="1345.19" dur="5.7">and lost track of them until I hit play</text>
  <text start="1348.19" dur="4.11">on the film the boy was not walking in</text>

  <text start="1352.3" dur="5.22">Allen problems he keeps venturing away</text>
  <text start="1354.52" dur="5.07">and getting distracted various things at</text>
  <text start="1357.52" dur="3.54">various things in the pavilion the</text>
  <text start="1359.59" dur="3.75">benefit of the doubt I gave Allen</text>
  <text start="1361.06" dur="4.68">subsided when I saw the kid go press the</text>
  <text start="1363.34" dur="4.89">button for the fast pass on Soren and</text>
  <text start="1365.74" dur="5.22">take the paper fast pass almost like a</text>
  <text start="1368.23" dur="4.68">prize Allen then tucked him away and</text>
  <text start="1370.96" dur="4.5">stood back and observed as the kids</text>
  <text start="1372.91" dur="5.37">walked into the living with the land</text>
  <text start="1375.46" dur="4.47">I saw them get on the boat I saw them</text>

  <text start="1390.1" dur="3.54">it on the other scenes and once it</text>
  <text start="1391.96" dur="3.24">resumes I saw the boat again in the</text>

  <text start="1395.2" dur="4.26">the boat was empty</text>
  <text start="1396.58" dur="5.49">I also saw freaking Allen looking down</text>
  <text start="1399.46" dur="5.13">off the observation deck which explains</text>
  <text start="1402.07" dur="4.38">how he responded so quickly I switched</text>
  <text start="1404.59" dur="4.14">the cameras back to live view and left</text>
  <text start="1406.45" dur="4.41">that area I haven&amp;#39;t been exactly honest</text>
  <text start="1408.73" dur="5.16">with you thus far I know a lot of things</text>

  <text start="1443.59" dur="2.61">right now</text>
  <text start="1443.92" dur="5.25">I would encourage you to research it so</text>
  <text start="1446.2" dur="4.23">guys out there research gas cots I never</text>
  <text start="1449.17" dur="3.51">thought what we did was okay by</text>
  <text start="1450.43" dur="4.74">containing these dark secrets but paid</text>
  <text start="1452.68" dur="4.29">well I have seen them quickly inject</text>
  <text start="1455.17" dur="4.59">some experimental drug on a guest and</text>
  <text start="1456.97" dur="5.22">throw them back out there our job was to</text>

  <text start="1467.37" dur="4.99">procedural first thing I did was go over</text>
  <text start="1470.59" dur="3.6">to the room where we keep the keys I</text>
  <text start="1472.36" dur="3.25">looked through the log books for the</text>

  <text start="1475.61" dur="4.98">see I found it but it had no zone or</text>
  <text start="1478.4" dur="5.279">specific location issue to the core and</text>
  <text start="1480.59" dur="6.06">the number of copies was marked as one</text>
  <text start="1483.679" dur="4.291">this key was in our system but my master</text>
  <text start="1486.65" dur="3.84">key didn&amp;#39;t open it</text>
  <text start="1487.97" dur="5.49">I grabbed the core key and a few zone 1</text>
  <text start="1490.49" dur="5.55">course the core key is specific is a</text>
  <text start="1493.46" dur="4.98">specific key that when inserted into the</text>
  <text start="1496.04" dur="4.83">lock will remove the core so it can be</text>
  <text start="1498.44" dur="5.28">replaced with another I put this in my</text>
  <text start="1500.87" dur="6.03">pocket and make a beeline for the land</text>
  <text start="1503.72" dur="5.37">and sea pavilion I may be paranoid but I</text>
  <text start="1506.9" dur="4.95">swear I saw Allen following me in the</text>
  <text start="1509.09" dur="5.01">shadows I got to the ride and got to the</text>
  <text start="1511.85" dur="5.76">house and back in the front door to the</text>
  <text start="1514.1" dur="5.88">Masonic room I locked the door as I</text>
  <text start="1517.61" dur="4.53">entered I inserted the key of the core</text>
