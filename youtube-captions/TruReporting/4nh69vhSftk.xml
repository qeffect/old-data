  <text start="188.58" dur="4.89">know how to let&amp;#39;s not forget that at</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="3.9">real Donald Trump graduated from a</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="5.07">private military academy in New York and</text>
  <text start="195.66" dur="5.67">then on to Wharton his father Fred Trump</text>

  <text start="228.269" dur="3.601">Trump has been saying the same thing</text>
  <text start="229.8" dur="4.83">since the beginning it&amp;#39;s uncanny how</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="5.43">consistent his message and politics have</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="5.839">remained and we can go ahead and take a</text>
  <text start="237.3" dur="7.32">listen in this real quick</text>
  <text start="240.469" dur="7.781">remover you are a doer if you could make</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="5.849">America perfect how would you do it well</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="5.4">I think that America is a country that</text>
  <text start="250.469" dur="5.55">is tremendous tremendous potential I</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="4.649">think that much like the mind I think</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="5.37">that America is using very very little</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="4.921">of its potential I feel that this</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="4.831">country with the proper leadership can</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="5.789">go on to become what it once was and I</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="5.91">hope and certainly hope that it does go</text>
  <text start="269.009" dur="5.851">in to be what it what it should be what</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="4.89">should it be well it should be a coup it</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="4.29">should really be a country that gets the</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="3.81">respect of other countries do they</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="3.449">respect the most important thing in your</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.11">opinion well respect can lead to other</text>
  <text start="282.599" dur="3.871">things when you get the respect of the</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="4.05">other countries than the other countries</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="4.919">tend to do a little bit as you do and</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="4.859">you can create the right attitudes the</text>
  <text start="291.389" dur="7.34">the Iranian situation is a case in point</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="8.25">that they hold our hostages is just</text>
  <text start="298.729" dur="5.591">absolutely and totally ridiculous that</text>
  <text start="302.099" dur="4.29">this country sits back and allows a</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="4.74">country such as Iran to hold our</text>
  <text start="306.389" dur="6.21">hostages to my way of thinking is a</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="6.27">horror and I don&amp;#39;t think they do it with</text>
  <text start="312.599" dur="4.35">other countries I honestly don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="3.3">they do it with other country you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.949" dur="3.871">advocating that we should have gone in</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="4.62">there with troops etc and brought our</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="3.719">boys out I absolutely feel that yes I</text>
  <text start="323.25" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any question and</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="4.021">there&amp;#39;s no question in my mind I think</text>
  <text start="327.06" dur="3.84">right now would be an oil-rich Nathe</text>
  <text start="328.56" dur="4.59">nation and I believe that we should have</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="4.019">done it and I&amp;#39;m very disappointed that</text>
  <text start="333.15" dur="4.17">we didn&amp;#39;t do it and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="334.919" dur="3.93">anybody would have held us in abeyance I</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t think anybody would have been</text>
  <text start="338.849" dur="4.651">angry with us and we had every right to</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="4.86">do it at the time I think we&amp;#39;ve lost the</text>
  <text start="343.5" dur="6.12">opportunity some people the ultimate</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="5.25">goal in life has been becoming the</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="3.78">president of the United States would you</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="3.18">like to be the president of the United</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="2.88">States I really don&amp;#39;t believe I would</text>
  <text start="354.87" dur="3.479">wrote it but I would like to see</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="3.24">somebody as the president who could do</text>
  <text start="358.349" dur="3.481">the job and there are very capable</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="4.079">people in this country most people who</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="3.6">are capable and not running for office</text>
  <text start="363.599" dur="4.051">most men are frightened of politics</text>
  <text start="365.43" dur="5.67">today it is a shame isn&amp;#39;t it yes it is a</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="5.28">shame the most capable people are not</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="3.96">necessarily running for political office</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="4.77">and that is a very sad commentary out of</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="4.14">the country they had major corporations</text>
  <text start="377.7" dur="3.24">and they had this and that but they are</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="3.42">not running for political office why</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="3.09">wouldn&amp;#39;t someone like yourself run for</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="3.27">political office who have all the money</text>
  <text start="384.03" dur="3.39">that you possibly need you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="385.89" dur="4.38">accomplished a great deal even though</text>
  <text start="387.42" dur="4.41">you are only 34 I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="390.27" dur="2.25">things that you possibly can do in the</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="2.97">years ahead</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="4.08">why wouldn&amp;#39;t you dedicate yourself to</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="4.56">public service because I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="396.6" dur="4.68">very mean life I would love and I would</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="3.69">I would dedicate my life to this country</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="3.84">but I see it as being a mean life and I</text>
  <text start="403.05" dur="4.5">also see it that somebody with strong</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="4.17">views and somebody with the kind of</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="4.23">views that are maybe a little bit</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="4.89">unpopular which may be right but maybe</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="3.81">unpopular wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily have a</text>
  <text start="414.18" dur="3.39">chance of getting elected against</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="4.56">somebody with no great brain but a big</text>
  <text start="417.57" dur="4.95">smile and that&amp;#39;s a sad commentary for</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.11">the political process television in a</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="3.42">strange way has ruined that process</text>
  <text start="424.26" dur="3.3">hasn&amp;#39;t it it&amp;#39;s hurt the process very</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="3.39">much I mean the Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s of the</text>
  <text start="427.56" dur="4.23">world Abraham Lincoln would probably not</text>
  <text start="429.33" dur="4.65">be electable today because of television</text>
  <text start="431.79" dur="5.67">he was not a handsome man and he did not</text>
  <text start="433.98" dur="5.25">smile at all he would not be considered</text>
  <text start="437.46" dur="3.45">to be a prime candidate for the</text>
  <text start="439.23" dur="4.92">presidency and that&amp;#39;s a shame isn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="440.91" dur="4.83">but if all the men I like you then when</text>
  <text start="444.15" dur="3.63">are we gonna get somebody who might be</text>
  <text start="445.74" dur="3.9">good I don&amp;#39;t know I hope it&amp;#39;s around the</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="3.63">corner but I don&amp;#39;t know I really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="4.77">know what I would like to be involved in</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="5.37">is trying to help choose somebody or</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="4.35">working with a group of people whereby</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="4.98">they put up a candidate who would be</text>
  <text start="458.76" dur="6.57">acceptable to be a presidential you know</text>
  <text start="461.76" dur="6.14">to be the president the country if we</text>
  <text start="465.33" dur="5.22">had the one man and it&amp;#39;s really not that</text>
  <text start="467.9" dur="4.39">big situation you know people say well</text>
  <text start="470.55" dur="3.27">what could anybody do as president that</text>
  <text start="472.29" dur="4.23">one man could turn this country around</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="5.31">the one proper president could turn this</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="4.23">country around I firmly believe that if</text>
  <text start="479.13" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;d lost your fortune today what would</text>
  <text start="480.75" dur="5.64">you do tomorrow maybe I&amp;#39;d run for</text>

  <text start="491.97" dur="4.32">just speculation to try to make things</text>
