  <text start="133.07" dur="4.33">information based off of what is</text>

  <text start="151.47" dur="3.39">this about a hundred times but we all</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.05">know what&amp;#39;s going on with YouTube and</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="3.99">Google and Facebook and Twitter and the</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="3.39">rest of them these social media</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="4.53">companies but especially in my case here</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="4.56">for this channel Google and YouTube are</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="3.84">deciding to become the arbiters of</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="4.23">morality and truth and they decide what</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="4.11">content gets suggested and they act more</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="4.86">as publishers and less as an open speech</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="4.38">platform so I depend on you guys to hit</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="3.27">that share button you guys don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="175.71" dur="3.51">how much of a difference that actually</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="3.09">makes there&amp;#39;s a share button at the</text>

  <text start="188.4" dur="4.23">that we&amp;#39;re here and that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="3.93">silence us just by you know pushing us</text>
  <text start="192.63" dur="4.86">into these memory holes and these</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="6.24">digital gulags as Matt Drudge said so we</text>
  <text start="197.49" dur="4.65">have to be continually pushing the</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="2.97">information out there and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="4.68">asking yourself what&amp;#39;s cute on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.52" dur="5.19">this guy rambling about all of that well</text>
  <text start="206.82" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s a good answer for that so watch</text>
  <text start="208.71" dur="2.88">this video what is Q on the Great</text>
  <text start="210" dur="3.33">Awakening you can find it here on the</text>

  <text start="215.25" dur="3.03">said thank you so much for your support</text>

  <text start="218.28" dur="5.34">makes a huge difference today what are</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="5.49">we looking at this now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="4.35">controversy at this story we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="226.32" dur="5.43">get into other stories later here in the</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="5.94">episode with of course regard to what I</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="4.14">mentioned earlier with Alex Jones and</text>
  <text start="233.91" dur="5.37">all that but for now we&amp;#39;re gonna focus</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="4.59">on this story so basically President</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="3.81">Trump decided to give an interview to</text>
  <text start="240.48" dur="5.37">George Stephanopoulos on ABC which I</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="5.07">believe it was ABC News but cute or</text>
  <text start="245.85" dur="4.2">somebody said that there was something</text>
  <text start="248.16" dur="3.84">weird a present from tweeting at ABC</text>
  <text start="250.05" dur="5.04">instead of ABC News which I&amp;#39;m not sure I</text>
  <text start="252" dur="4.65">know that but there&amp;#39;s a lot to this</text>
  <text start="255.09" dur="3.6">story that we&amp;#39;re gonna unpack here let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="4.53">read the tweet first then we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="3.72">look at an older Q post and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="3.48">kind of put some of these things</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="3.78">together in context of why the</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="3.3">mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="3.9">going after the president so hard and</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s a lot of easy simple answers</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="5.01">there to that but we&amp;#39;ll get into the</text>
  <text start="272.73" dur="3.87">more complex ones here as I enjoyed my</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="3.06">interview with George Stephanopoulos on</text>
  <text start="276.6" dur="3.36">ABC so funny to watch the fake news</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="3.72">media trying to dissect and distort</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="3.84">every word and as negative away as</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="3.09">possible it will be aired on Sunday</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="2.64">night at 8:00 p.m. and it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="3.03">president Trump 30 hours which is</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="3.93">somewhat misleading and then I</text>
  <text start="288" dur="4.56">personally spent only a small fraction</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="4.92">of that time doing interviews I do have</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="4.71">a few other things to do you know think</text>
  <text start="295.29" dur="4.53">I will do many more Network interviews</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="5.16">as I did in 2016 or to get the word out</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="7.62">that no president has done what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="6.72">what I have in the first two and a half</text>
  <text start="307.44" dur="3.03">years of his presidency including the</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="3.09">fact that we have one of the best</text>
  <text start="310.47" dur="4.32">economies in the history of the country</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="3.42">it is called earned media in any event</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="4.23">enjoy the show</text>
  <text start="315.66" dur="7.2">perfect okay so enjoy the show how many</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="6.87">times has Q said that to us we all know</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="4.62">what Q is right for those of you who are</text>
  <text start="325.89" dur="2.97">like really new to this and green to it</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="4.95">I&amp;#39;ll give you that the the little</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="6.15">elevator pitch run down it Q on is a</text>
  <text start="332.43" dur="4.56">group of cute clearance Patriots who are</text>
  <text start="335.01" dur="3.96">close to and near the president who are</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="5.45">also affiliated with military</text>
  <text start="338.97" dur="6.75">intelligence who have been basically</text>
  <text start="342.44" dur="5.32">posting online and asking questions that</text>
  <text start="345.72" dur="4.35">draw a narrative without actually giving</text>
  <text start="347.76" dur="4.59">away classified or stop secret</text>
  <text start="350.07" dur="4.47">information so we&amp;#39;ve been doing a</text>
  <text start="352.35" dur="5.49">parallel construction for I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="354.54" dur="5.52">almost two years and in that parallel</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="4.11">construction where we&amp;#39;re taking these</text>
  <text start="360.06" dur="3.9">questions that Q&amp;#39;s been giving us and</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="4.17">applying them to the news and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="4.92">happening we were able to put together a</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="7.5">whole set of information that that lends</text>
  <text start="368.88" dur="7.95">itself to explain an incredible amount</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="5.7">of the reasons why the fake news were</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="5.46">lying reasons why the FISA Court was</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="4.83">abused reasons why there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="382.29" dur="3.81">problem that&amp;#39;s not reported on by the</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="3.72">mainstream media with human trafficking</text>
  <text start="386.1" dur="7.57">and sex trafficking in our country when</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="12.81">it comes to some of the most on</text>
  <text start="393.67" dur="9.75">believable and high-ranking individuals</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="4.21">involved that you&amp;#39;ll ever imagine we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="403.42" dur="2.82">been able to do a lot of work with the</text>
  <text start="404.89" dur="3.27">information that we&amp;#39;ve been getting and</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="4.11">the reason it&amp;#39;s had to come out this way</text>
  <text start="408.16" dur="5.58">has everything to do with the fact that</text>
  <text start="410.35" dur="5.97">the mainstream media will not report on</text>
  <text start="413.74" dur="4.71">this information therefore we are</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="4.44">disseminating the information that the</text>
  <text start="418.45" dur="5.67">American public needs to know to not be</text>
  <text start="420.76" dur="5.61">smen ttle slaves of these big media</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="4.83">propagandists and what do I mean by that</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="5.49">well quite simply put let&amp;#39;s consider</text>
  <text start="428.95" dur="5.46">this here&amp;#39;s President Trump addressing</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="5.07">the fact that George Stephanopoulos did</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="4.32">this report on him and that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="3.84">just an exaggeration they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="438.73" dur="4.11">sect his words you guys price on the</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="4.11">news recently where they talked about</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="4.08">how President Trump was saying it was</text>
  <text start="444.88" dur="4.74">okay to take information from foreign</text>
  <text start="446.92" dur="7.02">agents about his adversaries political</text>
  <text start="449.62" dur="6.06">adversaries but the hypocrisy is just is</text>
  <text start="453.94" dur="3.63">palpable when you look at the fact that</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;ll accuse the president in a</text>
  <text start="457.57" dur="4.11">hypothetical you know making a statement</text>
  <text start="459.64" dur="4.23">and a hypothetical question that yeah he</text>
  <text start="461.68" dur="3.68">would look at information as compared to</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="4.92">Hillary Clinton who literally</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="6.01">orchestrated the purchasing of Oppo</text>
  <text start="468.79" dur="4.89">basically disinformation propaganda</text>
  <text start="471.37" dur="3.99">research that was then used as a</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="3.81">predicate by our intelligence</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="3.6">communities to illegally spy on the</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="2.58">president and they didn&amp;#39;t even need a</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="3.48">predicate because they were already</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="5.4">abusing the surveillance systems before</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="5.03">all of this happened allegedly let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.47" dur="4.95">just look at this for what it is</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="5.55">President Trump is accusing ABC of being</text>
  <text start="490.42" dur="5.22">one of the worst at distorting</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="4.51">information that should be otherwise</text>
  <text start="495.64" dur="4.71">presented to the American people and</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="5.16">then he has to continue to be engaged</text>
  <text start="500.35" dur="5.1">with this for its what two and a half</text>
  <text start="502.69" dur="5.43">years there&amp;#39;s one thing to have a media</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="4.62">that that scrutinizes the president it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.12" dur="4.71">one thing to have a media that questions</text>
  <text start="510.07" dur="5.61">a narrative and reports you know what</text>
  <text start="512.83" dur="5.49">they feel but it&amp;#39;s a whole nother thing</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="7.89">to look at the media today where it is a</text>
  <text start="518.32" dur="7.93">weaponized a attack dog for the Liberal</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="7.199">Democrats and leftist in this country</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="10.23">there is no way that you can tell me</text>
  <text start="530.769" dur="9.43">that CNN MSNBC ABC NBC and CBS don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="536.48" dur="6.57">have an extreme liberal left biased and</text>
  <text start="540.199" dur="4.711">have an extreme disdain for our</text>
  <text start="543.05" dur="3.539">president and his policies in his</text>
  <text start="544.91" dur="5.19">administration and his followers and</text>
  <text start="546.589" dur="5.641">supporters no one in America can turn on</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="3.839">a TV and watch one of these mainstream</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="4.799">media companies which are all owned by</text>
  <text start="553.939" dur="4.5">the bit same six corporations you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="557.029" dur="3.24">turn on the TV without seeing negative</text>
  <text start="558.439" dur="4.291">news about the president they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="560.269" dur="5.401">to hinder his ability to administer or</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="6.12">rather implement his administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="6">policies and this is really one of the</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="4.409">most dangerous parts of the fake news</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="4.44">and how they are truly the enemy of the</text>
  <text start="573.259" dur="5.13">people so this is one example and it</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="4.169">kind of makes sense considering one of</text>
