  <text start="147.12" dur="5.01">me by YouTube from this person</text>
  <text start="150.33" dur="4.2">apparently the David Horowitz freedom</text>

  <text start="159.27" dur="4.37">didn&amp;#39;t like that and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="161.07" dur="5.07">that video to go out so that&amp;#39;s on them</text>
  <text start="163.64" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;ve done that and i&amp;#39;ve gotten a</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="3.3">copyright strike now and i&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="4.11">figure it out with them behind the</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="4.2">scenes still a great video still think</text>
  <text start="171.99" dur="3.45">you guys should go find it</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="3.39">even if you have to go over to the</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="4.29">wherever the david horowitz Freedom</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="5.67">Center to go watch it it&amp;#39;s fine by me I</text>
  <text start="179.73" dur="4.59">think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I thought my work was</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="3.78">transformative I thought it was covered</text>
  <text start="184.32" dur="3.96">under fair use I still believe that and</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="4.14">I really hope that the people over at</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="5.82">the David Horowitz quote-unquote Freedom</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="6.21">Center decide to retract that claim</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="5.4">because I&amp;#39;ve removed the video or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.83" dur="4.26">been taken down so I just think it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="3.39">would be a common courtesy for them to</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="3.66">do that but you know that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="4.79">up to them I can&amp;#39;t control what they do</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="5.91">all I can do is continue to move forward</text>
  <text start="207.68" dur="6.01">yes it hurts the channel yes it puts me</text>
  <text start="210.66" dur="5.16">in a tough position yes it makes my work</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="3.9">even that much more difficult yes it</text>
  <text start="215.82" dur="4.26">makes everything that much more</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="5.369">complicated and it may limit certain</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="4.92">things I can do in the future so you</text>
  <text start="222.959" dur="3.811">know but that&amp;#39;s the situation guys so</text>
  <text start="225" dur="3.87">for those of you who are noticing that</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s a video missing yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s what happened with that so</text>
  <text start="231" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s not much I can do I&amp;#39;ve written</text>
  <text start="233.07" dur="4.35">an email to them I&amp;#39;ve reached out and</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="5.49">asked them to kindly please retract</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="5.91">their claim but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and</text>

  <text start="250.41" dur="5.699">of positive feedback and yeah it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="5.699">part of the the the you know part of the</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.621">job here is reporting information and</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="3.781">disseminating information that I think</text>
  <text start="260.73" dur="4.2">is important I thought that that speech</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="3.56">was important I spent a very long time</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="4.16">editing it to</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="4.709">to highlight the the sections that I</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="4.62">thought were most pertinent and then to</text>
  <text start="271.039" dur="6.81">put it into a package that was easily</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="6.9">digestible for you the viewer so to me</text>
  <text start="277.849" dur="7.141">you know I was working under the the</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="7.619">idea of fair use and I still would stand</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="4.679">by that to this day it is what it is so</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="4.261">I just thought it addressed that really</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="4.771">quickly because it&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="5.209">happened so with that being said</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="5.279">obviously here is another one which is</text>
  <text start="297.699" dur="2.891">what is cute on the Great Awakening if</text>

  <text start="309.469" dur="3.091">happened today with the Obama</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="3.09">administration so this is the report</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="4.889">this came out of the American report</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="4.44">dot-org great investigative journalist</text>
  <text start="317.449" dur="1.951">probably some of the best in the country</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="4.049">right now</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="5.91">Mary Fanning and Alan Jones the these</text>
  <text start="322.669" dur="5.4">individuals are uncovering the next big</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="5.729">story in my opinion and what is the next</text>
  <text start="328.069" dur="5.641">big story it&amp;#39;s the story of the CIA NSA</text>
  <text start="331.039" dur="6.091">whistleblower Dennis Montgomery who came</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="6.179">forward to the FBI in 2015 and presented</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="4.86">them with 47 hard drives worth of</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="6.03">evidence that proved beyond a reasonable</text>
  <text start="341.99" dur="7.649">doubt according to his own witness count</text>
  <text start="345.919" dur="6.09">that the Obama administration was</text>
  <text start="349.639" dur="5.221">weaponizing this surveillance tool</text>
  <text start="352.009" dur="5.611">called the hammer in order to spy on</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="5.19">their political adversaries and use it</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="5.659">for allegedly blackmail and other</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="6.03">nefarious things so this to me is like</text>
  <text start="363.279" dur="4.661">one of those those stories that I just</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="4.26">have to keep reporting on and this is a</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="4.49">new iteration of it where they just keep</text>
  <text start="370.34" dur="7.979">coming out with more and more incredible</text>

  <text start="403.79" dur="5.04">testifying against all of these</text>

  <text start="714.18" dur="3.69">into the next part here because it talks</text>
  <text start="715.38" dur="4.29">about how is the vault seven revealed</text>
  <text start="717.87" dur="4.59">one of the hacking tools that was used</text>
  <text start="719.67" dur="4.68">by the intelligence agencies was this</text>
  <text start="722.46" dur="4.53">thing called the hammer which was a</text>
  <text start="724.35" dur="5.61">throwing framework for browser exploits</text>
  <text start="726.99" dur="4.62">so obviously it was used to exploit</text>
  <text start="729.96" dur="4.05">browsers but here&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="731.61" dur="4.47">fascinating because this is a statement</text>
  <text start="734.01" dur="4.44">from William Binney on this and how this</text>
  <text start="736.08" dur="4.17">could have went says this was the this</text>
  <text start="738.45" dur="3.27">was key because Montgomery was the</text>
  <text start="740.25" dur="3">designer and developer of a super</text>
  <text start="741.72" dur="3.39">surveillance system known as the hammer</text>
  <text start="743.25" dur="3.66">that was intended for foreign</text>

  <text start="752.88" dur="3.66">military sources the hammer had multiple</text>
  <text start="754.65" dur="3.42">echelons of safeguards in place to</text>
  <text start="756.54" dur="3.87">ensure that the foreign super</text>

  <text start="760.41" dur="3.45">for illegal domestic surveillance</text>
  <text start="762.06" dur="3.81">operations against the American people</text>
  <text start="763.86" dur="3.63">those military sources state that</text>
  <text start="765.87" dur="3.24">Montgomery&amp;#39;s work was effective</text>
  <text start="767.49" dur="3.93">Montgomery&amp;#39;s foreign surveillance system</text>
  <text start="769.11" dur="4.83">not only worked but it was also but it</text>
  <text start="771.42" dur="4.02">also saved American lives according to</text>
  <text start="773.94" dur="2.94">Montgomery the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="775.44" dur="3.51">turned that super surveillance system</text>
  <text start="776.88" dur="5.01">against the American people including</text>
  <text start="778.95" dur="5.73">FISA Court judges US Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="781.89" dur="5.13">justices and Donald Trump among many</text>
  <text start="784.68" dur="3.93">others so think about that what&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="787.02" dur="4.59">alleged here by Dennis Montgomery and</text>
  <text start="788.61" dur="4.74">others is that they Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="791.61" dur="6">administration used this super</text>
  <text start="793.35" dur="6.46">surveillance tool to our system to spy</text>
  <text start="797.61" dur="5.83">on FISA Court judges</text>

  <text start="803.44" dur="7.04">President of the United States among</text>
  <text start="806.26" dur="6.48">others this is bad this looks really bad</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="3.85">since the Obama administration used data</text>
  <text start="812.74" dur="3.06">harvested by the illegal super</text>
  <text start="814.33" dur="3.75">surveillance system for leverage and</text>
  <text start="815.8" dur="3.45">blackmail according to Montgomery oh</text>
  <text start="818.08" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="819.25" dur="5.18">Wow William Binney who served as NSA</text>
  <text start="822.67" dur="4.14">technical director of the world</text>
  <text start="824.43" dur="4.09">geopolitical military analysis reporting</text>

  <text start="828.52" dur="5.28">stated during a May 25th 2019 interview</text>
  <text start="831.1" dur="5.52">on the Sgt report quote the hammer</text>
  <text start="833.8" dur="5.25">program as far as I can see was run by</text>
  <text start="836.62" dur="4.14">CIA and the point was that the NSA</text>
  <text start="839.05" dur="4.26">already had their massive clock</text>
  <text start="840.76" dur="5.04">collection on everybody anyway that was</text>
  <text start="843.31" dur="4.65">called the stellar wind program and it</text>
  <text start="845.8" dur="3.75">had the tapping points for the upstream</text>
  <text start="847.96" dur="4.08">collection of everything on the fiber</text>
  <text start="849.55" dur="4.98">networks everything so they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="852.04" dur="4.89">to do a hammer because they already had</text>
  <text start="854.53" dur="4.65">all of the data but if CIA wanted to do</text>
  <text start="856.93" dur="4.5">it and have it separately and not be</text>
  <text start="859.18" dur="4.68">because anybody clearing the NSA data</text>
  <text start="861.43" dur="4.98">goes through a system where they get</text>
  <text start="863.86" dur="4.8">reported where queries go right in there</text>
  <text start="866.41" dur="4.47">and they are registered they know they</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="4.11">made this query on this date and got</text>
  <text start="870.88" dur="4.56">this data so the NSA&amp;#39;s got that</text>
  <text start="872.77" dur="4.92">information but if CI wanted to do it</text>
  <text start="875.44" dur="4.02">but not let NSA or anybody else in the</text>
  <text start="877.69" dur="4.17">government know about it they could set</text>
  <text start="879.46" dur="5.1">up separate secret program like hammer</text>
  <text start="881.86" dur="4.68">and do a subset of tapping in the</text>
  <text start="884.56" dur="4.2">critical points around Washington and</text>
  <text start="886.54" dur="4.11">decision-making centers and then take in</text>
  <text start="888.76" dur="4.05">that data and have it scanned and</text>
  <text start="890.65" dur="4.83">session eyes and locally examined by</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="9.21">members of CIA only so that nobody knew</text>
  <text start="895.48" dur="7.38">they were doing it whoa I mean this gets</text>
  <text start="902.02" dur="2.73">crazier and crazier</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="3.99">and that&amp;#39;s unquote and then it says</text>
  <text start="904.75" dur="5.22">during day one of Baker&amp;#39;s interview</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="5.16">representative Jamey hat Raskin asked</text>
  <text start="909.97" dur="4.23">Baker quote to your knowledge did the</text>
  <text start="912.01" dur="5.1">FBI or DOJ ever investigate the Trump</text>
  <text start="914.2" dur="5.28">campaign quote for political purposes no</text>
  <text start="917.11" dur="4.65">Baker replied to your knowledge to</text>
  <text start="919.48" dur="4.77">President Obama or anyone into his White</text>
  <text start="921.76" dur="5.1">House ever quote demand a request that</text>
  <text start="924.25" dur="6.18">the FBI or DOJ or DOJ or FBI quote</text>
  <text start="926.86" dur="5.34">infiltrate or surveil the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="930.43" dur="3.21">for quote political purposes for asking</text>
  <text start="932.2" dur="4.319">then ask Baker no Baker</text>
  <text start="933.64" dur="4.259">again replied it is notable that the</text>
  <text start="936.519" dur="3.81">line of questioning from representative</text>
  <text start="937.899" dur="4.351">Raskin was very narrowly stated</text>
  <text start="940.329" dur="4.111">representative raskins use of the</text>
  <text start="942.25" dur="3.45">wording political purposes is key or</text>
  <text start="944.44" dur="2.91">asking was creating the narrative that</text>
  <text start="945.7" dur="4.05">the surveillance of Trump was not being</text>
  <text start="947.35" dur="4.169">done for political purposes and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="949.75" dur="3">basically implying that the surveillance</text>
  <text start="951.519" dur="3.391">was done because they thought he was a</text>
  <text start="952.75" dur="4.56">Russian agent which I I believe about as</text>
  <text start="954.91" dur="6.15">much as I believe that you know the moon</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="7.649">is made out of cotton candy so just come</text>
  <text start="961.06" dur="5.88">on right and apparently this Raskin</text>
  <text start="964.959" dur="4.081">woman&amp;#39;s got connections and her family</text>
  <text start="966.94" dur="5.31">to this person who was a Soviet spy</text>
  <text start="969.04" dur="6.989">named Alger Hiss allegedly and then it</text>
  <text start="972.25" dur="5.97">goes on to kind of outline what happened</text>
  <text start="976.029" dur="3.87">and how President Trump and his father</text>
  <text start="978.22" dur="3.2">apparently Fred Trump had been under</text>
  <text start="979.899" dur="5.93">surveillance for a very long time</text>
  <text start="981.42" dur="7.12">because they were they were basically</text>
  <text start="985.829" dur="5.051">against communism and you have two</text>
  <text start="988.54" dur="3.87">people running the top intelligence and</text>

  <text start="994.779" dur="4.56">another had either a said quote from a</text>

  <text start="1008.73" dur="2.43">unquote</text>

  <text start="1304.03" dur="5.07">get embarrassed by trying to indict a</text>
  <text start="1306.22" dur="4.32">president with nothing and so then they</text>
