  <text start="192.32" dur="6.47">at Trump&amp;#39;s tweet something that be</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="6.12">notice you Trump made a lot of comments</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="4.449">regarding his relationship with Mike</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="5.04">Pompeo being different than that of his</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="5.731">relationship with Rex Tillerson so how</text>

  <text start="228.23" dur="7.47">get fired you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="4.98">to me that we&amp;#39;re actually changing up</text>
  <text start="235.7" dur="4.98">the leadership the CIA which has been I</text>
  <text start="237.65" dur="5.28">think all we&amp;#39;ve been talking about on</text>
  <text start="240.68" dur="6.66">our videos here have been mostly about</text>
  <text start="242.93" dur="6.75">clowns and their reorganizational or not</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="7.89">the real Rachel I should say more overly</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="8.429">their attempts to undermine the active</text>
  <text start="255.23" dur="4.74">presidency the Trump administration so</text>
  <text start="258.109" dur="3.841">it&amp;#39;s fascinating to me that we actually</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="4.71">are shaking it up again</text>
  <text start="261.95" dur="4.29">Mike Pompeo you know maybe being put as</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="3.99">the Secretary of State is a totally</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="4.29">different position than the CIA which is</text>
  <text start="268.67" dur="3.45">an interesting thing I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="270.53" dur="2.88">the inside baseball works on that if you</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="4.32">guys have any insights please let me</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="6.69">know in the comments but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="5.449">read an article that was pointed to by</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="5.13">Julian Assange from WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="281.889" dur="7.181">he actually retweeted this and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="285.23" dur="8.189">article from 2017 and that&amp;#39;s April 15th</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="6.03">and it says Roger stone CIA director</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="6.121">Mike Pompeo should resign after ripping</text>
  <text start="295.1" dur="6.6">WikiLeaks and it goes on to say Roger</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="3.78">stone said on Friday that CIA director</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="3.54">Mike Pompeo should resign after he</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="5.49">delivered a speech this week rebuking</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="6.179">WikiLeaks during that address thursday</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="4.08">in washington d.c Pompeo said it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="311.419" dur="4.621">to call out wikileaks for what it really</text>
  <text start="312.89" dur="5.07">is a non-state hostile intelligence</text>
  <text start="316.04" dur="4.56">service often abetted by state actors</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="4.89">like Russia when asked to react to that</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="4.47">speech in a Newsmax TV interview stone</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="4.44">said there is no convincing evidence to</text>
  <text start="325.07" dur="4.32">support this assertion quote the</text>
  <text start="327.29" dur="6.66">bureaucrats in scurry of CIA are</text>
  <text start="329.39" dur="9.93">spinning a BS narrative mr. Pompeo is so</text>
  <text start="333.95" dur="8.37">dumb that he is bought buying added</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="5.25">stone before calling for pompeius</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="3.99">departure this really raises questions</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="3.15">about his qualifications and his ability</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="3.57">to do the job there are strong</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="4.38">indications that stone a trump confidant</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="3.84">and longtime political trickster dating</text>
  <text start="352.1" dur="3.99">back to the Nixon area has been in some</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="4.98">sort of contact with WikiLeaks a recent</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="4.86">CNN review of stones public statements</text>
  <text start="358.7" dur="3.93">show stone repeatedly seemed to have</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="4.71">forthcoming knowledge about the leaks</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="7.67">and that that&amp;#39;s all been disproven</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="8.52">he had a small correspondence that was</text>
  <text start="370.3" dur="7.869">completely it&amp;#39;s been openly admitted in</text>
  <text start="374.18" dur="5.97">under congressional testimony and so his</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="5.491">connection there was that was just being</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="6.389">overstated but so WikiLeaks points to</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="6.09">this you know this is the last thing</text>
  <text start="386.539" dur="6.841">that uh Julian Assange tweeted from</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="5.28">WikiLeaks the account but their</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.32">WikiLeaks tweet</text>
  <text start="395.03" dur="5.13">tweeted I should say Julian Assange has</text>
  <text start="397.7" dur="5.46">a separate account so fascinating times</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="4.74">that we live in so let&amp;#39;s keep looking at</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="3.9">this and another fascinating thing that</text>
  <text start="404.9" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re gonna go through is basically</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="3.87">reviewing Julian Assange is Twitter</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="3.78">bored because we have so much there</text>

  <text start="468.41" dur="6.09">archive and then the the last one before</text>
  <text start="472.79" dur="6.26">that which is fascinating given what</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="7.76">we&amp;#39;ve been covering okay is basically</text>
  <text start="479.05" dur="6.429">Julian Assange retweeting at Snowden and</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="6.07">Snowden says are these really the values</text>
  <text start="485.479" dur="4.861">that the US should be promoting the CIA</text>

  <text start="508.43" dur="4.83">several different ways are somehow</text>
  <text start="510.77" dur="4.05">involved I mean if we take a look at the</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="5.73">map all we have to do is come right in</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="6.45">here I mean the CIA comes right out of</text>
  <text start="518.99" dur="5.21">the Office of Strategic service which is</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="7.13">the Pentagon which is marked here</text>
  <text start="524.2" dur="8.28">as you can tell as Nazi Germany and a</text>
  <text start="528.4" dur="8.88">product of what was left of a Adolf</text>
  <text start="532.48" dur="6.3">Hitler and then they&amp;#39;re connected to</text>
  <text start="537.28" dur="3.45">Bilderberg and then it&amp;#39;s all connected</text>

  <text start="667.12" dur="5.6">think it&amp;#39;s really here there what I</text>

  <text start="672.72" dur="12.79">the use of torture should be disallowed</text>
  <text start="679.83" dur="7.87">openly at least and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.51" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s definitely an argument to be</text>
  <text start="687.7" dur="5.49">made for both sides I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="690.46" dur="5.91">make that argument either way here not</text>
  <text start="693.19" dur="6.15">firmly for or against it I can neither</text>
  <text start="696.37" dur="5.13">confirm nor deny I have a thought here</text>
  <text start="699.34" dur="3.84">for this but I want to hear what you</text>
  <text start="701.5" dur="4.23">guys have to think cuz that would be way</text>
  <text start="703.18" dur="5">more important to me just thinking of</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="6.75">what you guys have to say about all this</text>
  <text start="708.18" dur="6.1">now she will be the first female CIA</text>
  <text start="712.48" dur="3.54">chief and yeah it takes probably a</text>
  <text start="714.28" dur="5.01">really hard woman to do that kind of job</text>
  <text start="716.02" dur="6.51">and you know obviously if you&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="719.29" dur="5.13">middle of a war anything goes so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="722.53" dur="3.12">gonna sit here and make a judgment one</text>
  <text start="724.42" dur="2.76">way or the other I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="725.65" dur="3.33">people with a lot of differing views in</text>
  <text start="727.18" dur="3.27">the audience so I&amp;#39;m gonna leave that to</text>
  <text start="728.98" dur="4.02">you guys to let me know what you think</text>
  <text start="730.45" dur="5.52">as I find that much more fascinating and</text>
  <text start="733" dur="5.64">important and then here you have Julian</text>
  <text start="735.97" dur="4.65">Assange actually tweeting that he says I</text>
  <text start="738.64" dur="3.96">cannot confirm or deny a secret plot to</text>

  <text start="759.22" dur="5.67">going on here it&amp;#39;s amazing to see</text>
  <text start="761.49" dur="5.74">Assange retweeting at Snowden and kind</text>
  <text start="764.89" dur="4.44">of promoting what Snowden saying and</text>
  <text start="767.23" dur="10.05">then to see what Snowden saying which is</text>
  <text start="769.33" dur="10.89">even more fascinating on his channel we</text>
  <text start="777.28" dur="8.31">have just him bunch of retweets talking</text>
  <text start="780.22" dur="8.37">about the new incoming director of the</text>

  <text start="790" dur="6.88">I&amp;#39;m not sure where we&amp;#39;re at with Snowden</text>

  <text start="796.88" dur="5.43">hat you guys let me know what you think</text>
  <text start="800.019" dur="3.731">but this is all fascinating it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="802.31" dur="4.05">breaking right now it all relates back</text>
  <text start="803.75" dur="5.399">to Cuban what we&amp;#39;ve been going over the</text>
  <text start="806.36" dur="5.37">last I don&amp;#39;t know how long I have my own</text>
  <text start="809.149" dur="4.171">opinions about Snowden I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve thought</text>
  <text start="811.73" dur="3.99">for a while that he worked with the</text>
  <text start="813.32" dur="4.8">Chinese maybe is like a double or a</text>

  <text start="818.12" dur="4.89">grey hat white hat</text>
  <text start="819.79" dur="4.75">there&amp;#39;s too much still yet to be</text>
  <text start="823.01" dur="4.47">determined I mean let the cards fall</text>
  <text start="824.54" dur="5.7">where they may hear and see where that</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="5.37">all ends up pointing us to but just</text>
  <text start="830.24" dur="5.01">fascinating things that I think we all</text>
  <text start="832.85" dur="8.489">need to look at in more detail and cover</text>
  <text start="835.25" dur="10.26">as we move forward in this time that we</text>
  <text start="841.339" dur="6.721">are in now this is kind of a segue into</text>
  <text start="845.51" dur="5.759">what I want to cover really quickly and</text>
  <text start="848.06" dur="7.16">it&amp;#39;s regarding the censorship here on</text>
  <text start="851.269" dur="6.781">this channel my last two videos now</text>
  <text start="855.22" dur="5.95">don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I don&amp;#39;t mind them D</text>
  <text start="858.05" dur="5.96">monetizing my content for the pure fact</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="5.46">of the money that doesn&amp;#39;t bother me</text>
  <text start="864.01" dur="4.81">what does bother me though is the the</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="4.769">way that deep what D monetization does</text>
  <text start="868.82" dur="6.509">to a video so for instance my last you</text>
  <text start="871.399" dur="6.481">know I don&amp;#39;t know seven videos or so</text>
  <text start="875.329" dur="6.061">have gotten a good flow of traffic and</text>
  <text start="877.88" dur="6.18">we&amp;#39;re talking about you know 40 30 40 50</text>
  <text start="881.39" dur="5.939">60 thousand views which is good okay and</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s good but I think that the</text>
  <text start="887.329" dur="3.931">censorship is kicked in on a certain</text>
  <text start="889.07" dur="3.81">topic that they don&amp;#39;t want getting out</text>
  <text start="891.26" dur="1.829">there and we&amp;#39;re gonna look at that right</text>
  <text start="892.88" dur="1.8">now</text>
  <text start="893.089" dur="3.541">and I want to say a special shout-out to</text>
  <text start="894.68" dur="4.32">all the commenters who pointed this out</text>
  <text start="896.63" dur="4.44">so thanks to these guys I see their</text>
  <text start="899" dur="4.11">comments a lot on the boards and I</text>
  <text start="901.07" dur="3.389">responded but they say why isn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="903.11" dur="3">video on your landing page a double</text>
  <text start="904.459" dur="3.031">checked not there that happens to me all</text>
  <text start="906.11" dur="3.15">the time I upload a video and it takes</text>
  <text start="907.49" dur="3.93">forever to get to the landing page I</text>
  <text start="909.26" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t know what that&amp;#39;s about I think</text>
  <text start="911.42" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s all a hüsnü lot that it says the</text>
  <text start="915.32" dur="4.41">one he uploaded last night about merkel</text>
  <text start="917.06" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t be played now is there a reason</text>
  <text start="919.73" dur="3.359">why says i don&amp;#39;t know to other channels</text>
  <text start="922.31" dur="2.49">i had</text>
  <text start="923.089" dur="3.961">watch had Merkel videos taken down maybe</text>
  <text start="924.8" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re over the target of her being</text>
  <text start="927.05" dur="7.229">related to Hitler and then it says that</text>
  <text start="929.48" dur="6.329">the AI Go algorithm and it couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="934.279" dur="3.091">more true if you guys read my response</text>
  <text start="935.809" dur="3.15">here I lay it out exactly how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="937.37" dur="4.469">happening to me it says you guys are</text>
  <text start="938.959" dur="5.19">both correct harsh hard censorship on</text>
  <text start="941.839" dur="4.8">last two videos d monetize meaning</text>
  <text start="944.149" dur="4.68">kicked out of algorithms so video gains</text>
  <text start="946.639" dur="4.68">no traction majority of videos rely on</text>
  <text start="948.829" dur="4.591">being suggested speech-to-text rant</text>
  <text start="951.319" dur="3.841">transcribes videos immediately and runs</text>
  <text start="953.42" dur="3.779">transcripts through keyword filters</text>
  <text start="955.16" dur="4.679">video automatically gets placed out of</text>
  <text start="957.199" dur="5.88">suggested videos thanks for watching I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="959.839" dur="5.31">working on fixes god bless and that that</text>
  <text start="963.079" dur="5.641">is basically the whole thing that I&amp;#39;m up</text>
  <text start="965.149" dur="5.761">against here in all reality I think we</text>
  <text start="968.72" dur="4.469">all we are all up against is how the</text>
  <text start="970.91" dur="5.399">algorithms work so my last two videos</text>
  <text start="973.189" dur="6.27">which this one&amp;#39;s not even still to this</text>
  <text start="976.309" dur="4.621">point it hasn&amp;#39;t put up my second video</text>
  <text start="979.459" dur="5.161">from last night the one dealing with</text>
  <text start="980.93" dur="5.909">Tommy Robinson and it&amp;#39;s over here it is</text>
  <text start="984.62" dur="4.29">excuse me it has put it up thankfully</text>
  <text start="986.839" dur="3.69">but you can see that the dramatic</text>
  <text start="988.91" dur="2.88">difference in the amount of traffic I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="990.529" dur="2.61">getting now I understand queuing on</text>
  <text start="991.79" dur="4.25">posts they&amp;#39;re gonna get a lot more</text>
  <text start="993.139" dur="5.661">traffic because they&amp;#39;re much more</text>
  <text start="996.04" dur="5.08">watched videos much more sought-after</text>
  <text start="998.8" dur="4.269">information but look at how this works</text>
  <text start="1001.12" dur="4.139">because this video was D monetized -</text>
  <text start="1003.069" dur="3.96">when I pointed out at snown so you guys</text>
  <text start="1005.259" dur="4.38">need to come watch these videos if they</text>
  <text start="1007.029" dur="4.11">have a few less views it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="1009.639" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re not being put into that the</text>
  <text start="1011.139" dur="4.831">suggested video that&amp;#39;s where I get a lot</text>
  <text start="1013.209" dur="5.61">of my traffic from and if you look at</text>
  <text start="1015.97" dur="4.529">you can see how how what my traffic is</text>
  <text start="1018.819" dur="3.21">like but as soon as the demonics has a</text>
  <text start="1020.499" dur="3.631">video it&amp;#39;s like taking it out of the</text>
  <text start="1022.029" dur="4.56">rail guru them it puts it into a whole</text>
  <text start="1024.13" dur="4.049">nother category they don&amp;#39;t suggest it</text>
  <text start="1026.589" dur="3.45">they don&amp;#39;t promote it they don&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="1028.179" dur="4.051">push the information and when they do</text>
  <text start="1030.039" dur="4.62">you can see that I naturally get a lot</text>
  <text start="1032.23" dur="4.849">of views so what what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="1034.659" dur="4.77">is is just pure raw unadulterated</text>
  <text start="1037.079" dur="3.58">censorship and it&amp;#39;s automatically</text>
  <text start="1039.429" dur="3.181">happening there&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t you think</text>
  <text start="1040.659" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s one person at the the</text>
  <text start="1042.61" dur="4.709">corporation who is purposefully doing</text>
  <text start="1045.159" dur="4.951">and I think it&amp;#39;s literally it&amp;#39;s just an</text>
  <text start="1047.319" dur="5.431">automatic filter so what happens is like</text>
  <text start="1050.11" dur="4.85">I said this before they have this thing</text>
  <text start="1052.75" dur="3.77">called text or speech to text</text>
  <text start="1054.96" dur="3.75">transcription and</text>
  <text start="1056.52" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s a program that can literally in</text>
  <text start="1058.71" dur="3.63">real-time as I&amp;#39;m speaking this video</text>
  <text start="1060.48" dur="5.01">when I go to upload it it will</text>
  <text start="1062.34" dur="5.01">transcribe every word I say into a Word</text>
  <text start="1065.49" dur="3.78">document now and this is the kind of</text>
  <text start="1067.35" dur="4.98">technology they&amp;#39;ve had for a while over</text>
  <text start="1069.27" dur="4.77">at the NSA dealing with how they make</text>
  <text start="1072.33" dur="4.74">metadata databases where they can</text>
  <text start="1074.04" dur="5.61">categorical aughh your phone calls by</text>
  <text start="1077.07" dur="4.98">simply transcribing them from voice to</text>
  <text start="1079.65" dur="4.98">text and then putting them into</text>
  <text start="1082.05" dur="5.25">databases that can be searched as a</text>
  <text start="1084.63" dur="5.46">keyword search so it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="1087.3" dur="6.66">principle here with how they are d</text>
  <text start="1090.09" dur="6.06">monetizing these videos so we need to</text>
  <text start="1093.96" dur="6.15">ask ourselves something is this fair and</text>
  <text start="1096.15" dur="5.82">free and I don&amp;#39;t think it is I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1100.11" dur="3.81">know how or who to complain to other</text>
  <text start="1101.97" dur="4.59">than to reach out to you guys my</text>
  <text start="1103.92" dur="4.17">audience and hope you guys can shed some</text>
  <text start="1106.56" dur="5.13">light on this and maybe give me some</text>
  <text start="1108.09" dur="5.7">pointers I know algorithms it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="1111.69" dur="3.84">the words we type into the description</text>
  <text start="1113.79" dur="8.28">or the keywords we put for searching it</text>
  <text start="1115.53" dur="8.79">I fairly certain that it is the way that</text>
  <text start="1122.07" dur="4.77">the algorithms can actually transcribe</text>
  <text start="1124.32" dur="5.58">your your words and then put those into</text>
  <text start="1126.84" dur="4.74">filters that automatically D monetize</text>
  <text start="1129.9" dur="3.51">videos and when a video gets D monetized</text>
  <text start="1131.58" dur="3.18">you know I may have thirty thousand</text>
  <text start="1133.41" dur="3.99">subscribers or twenty-eight thousand</text>

  <text start="1160.95" dur="4.61">about the way they go about doing and</text>
  <text start="1163.2" dur="5.64">how they select what they actually</text>
  <text start="1165.56" dur="4.84">censor that all to me is it needs to be</text>
