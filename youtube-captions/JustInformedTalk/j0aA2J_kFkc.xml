  <text start="129.599" dur="5.731">what Q posts in response now I read this</text>
  <text start="133.71" dur="4.23">since it was mentioned in the comment by</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="4.8">the Anton says Barlow was sometimes held</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="5.37">up as a straw man for a kind of naive</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="4.8">techno utopianism that believed that the</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="3.36">internet could solve all of humanity&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="146.67" dur="4.26">someone who spent the last 27 years</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="4.05">working with him at EF F I can say that</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="3.27">nothing can be further from the truth</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="4.2">Barlow knew that new technology could</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="3.99">create and empower evil as much as it</text>
  <text start="156.33" dur="4.62">could create in power good he made a</text>
  <text start="158.19" dur="6.3">conscious decision to focus on the</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="5.34">latter quote I knew it&amp;#39;s also true that</text>
  <text start="164.49" dur="4.47">a good way to invent the future is to</text>
  <text start="166.29" dur="4.26">predict it so I predicted utopia hoping</text>
  <text start="168.96" dur="4.77">to give Liberty a running start before</text>

  <text start="176.61" dur="6.6">turnkey totalitarianism Barlow&amp;#39;s lasting</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="5.64">legacy is that is that he devoted his</text>
  <text start="183.21" dur="3.78">life to making the Internet into a world</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="4.32">that all may enter without privilege or</text>

  <text start="200.34" dur="5.1">into silence or conformity in the days</text>
  <text start="203.07" dur="4.56">and weeks to come we will be take</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="3.6">talking and writing more about what an</text>

  <text start="215.34" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ll pray for his family and everyone</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="4.44">involved but it says heart attacks can</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="5.25">be deadly so I think there&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="7.26">an insinuation there that somebody was</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="6.42">not a good actor and was actually taking</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="4.74">down so now we go to the next one and</text>

  <text start="243.9" dur="3.63">bill now it&amp;#39;s interesting if you go back</text>
  <text start="246.36" dur="13.29">here and look at all the capitalized</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="15.51">letters you have T ba M I s M ay grd B</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="5.19">right and then so an an on on this board</text>
  <text start="263.04" dur="3.78">basically puts together this pretty</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="2.82">complex post it says this is pure</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="3.27">speculation</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="4.83">just fitting things in places but from</text>

  <text start="356.07" dur="4.41">like a reference to the art of the deal</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="5.61">maybe and if we go back we can scroll</text>
  <text start="360.48" dur="7.05">down to let&amp;#39;s see it would be January</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="6.51">19th I believe was when Chuck Schumer</text>
  <text start="367.53" dur="3.71">went and visited the White House and we</text>
  <text start="369.66" dur="6.03">actually had some information that was</text>
  <text start="371.24" dur="8.08">given to us by Q regarding that funny</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="6.24">thing all right so look it says Chuck</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="4.62">Schumer will live in fear from today</text>

  <text start="405.57" dur="6.36">thing we go back to this message here it</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="7.83">says reread the crumbs and so basically</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="6.15">I think that that Schumer is terrified</text>

  <text start="418.08" dur="8.13">moving forward with everything so it&amp;#39;s</text>
