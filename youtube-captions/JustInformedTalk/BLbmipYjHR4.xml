  <text start="69.33" dur="5.539">mentioned all the way down here which</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="6.03">was not too long ago when he</text>
  <text start="74.869" dur="7.901">accidentally or purposefully exposed his</text>
  <text start="77.939" dur="6.511">own trip code which will have to see</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="4.34">what time will tell what that is it</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="6.84">seems is now that that was on purpose</text>
  <text start="87.11" dur="5.649">that he says for us to watch the news</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="5.64">and a lot of people speculated that the</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="7.051">23 was referring to the February 23rd as</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="5.04">was yesterday now a lot of things have</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="4.26">been happening in the news lately that</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="3.539">would point to a lot of things that</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="3.329">we&amp;#39;ve been discussing here on this board</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="5.341">in great detail so it&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="5.851">thing to go back and re review what Q</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="4.559">has posted and then juxtaposed against</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="4.29">what is going on in the news and give</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="3.631">you all a better idea of how this is all</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="4.41">connected and how it&amp;#39;s going to continue</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="4.829">to connect as we keep moving in to what</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="5.459">is going on here but it&amp;#39;s saying I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="123.869" dur="6.081">watch the news that day I think he was</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="7.201">responding to the person who</text>
  <text start="129.95" dur="6.28">pointed out the - 20-23 and a lot of</text>
  <text start="134.61" dur="6.51">people pointed out to me when I said</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="6.63">that the - - - 23 is the - is those mean</text>
  <text start="141.12" dur="4.56">T in Morse code somebody pointed out I</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="6.42">believe it&amp;#39;s one long - that means T in</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="8.07">in Morse code and that the - here is -</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="8.91">23 and I still believe that 23 days is</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="6.12">the it could also it could mean 23 days</text>
  <text start="158.19" dur="3.54">that I&amp;#39;m just saying I still believe it</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="4.38">could mean 23 days which would be June</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="4.65">11th from the time this was posted right</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="3.81">but another big thing we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="3.96">talk about is the biggest story in the</text>
  <text start="168.06" dur="5.22">news and that is what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="5.04">North Korea but um this all is just</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="6.74">happening and it seems like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="8.67">involved in a very very controversial</text>
  <text start="180.02" dur="5.71">debate as to what&amp;#39;s going on with North</text>
  <text start="184.05" dur="3.27">Korea I mean it&amp;#39;s not controversial if</text>
  <text start="185.73" dur="4.92">you follow the news enough to understand</text>
  <text start="187.32" dur="5.91">that there is an art to this the tactic</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="4.17">tactics that are being taken but for</text>
  <text start="193.23" dur="3.84">those of you who don&amp;#39;t then you would be</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="3.9">kind of lost and you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="3.63">people just don&amp;#39;t follow that closely so</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="4.98">the news is able to distort the truth</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="6.03">and to convince them that somehow that</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="5.34">trump is failing in his negotiation by a</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="4.86">walking away from this meeting and what</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="10.97">am I talking about here well first you</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="11.1">would have to look at this which is the</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="5.32">person pointing out here whoever Anton</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="4.079">made this graphic did a good job but</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;re pointing out here these two CNN</text>
  <text start="226.769" dur="4.261">headlines and it&amp;#39;s saying disinformation</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="4.141">necessary and says White House cancels</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="3.84">summit with North Korea that says North</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="8.37">Korea blows up tunnels at p-- young</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="8.76">hungry nuclear test site I have a very</text>
  <text start="241.5" dur="6.32">very sneaking suspicion first of all</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="6.03">that some of these institutions were</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="4.93">installments here in North Korea were</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="5.18">already destroyed but let&amp;#39;s just say</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="5.489">that this is a true story</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="6.25">was this a direct retaliation so I mean</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="4.291">you go I mean imagine this is my the</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="2.28">disinformation that you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="4.08">out there</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="5.16">but what if this was the real case</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="5.91">behind the scenes let&amp;#39;s say that the</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="6.359">bass was there and in response to Kim&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="4.32">basically going and talking to China so</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="5.161">I think here let me explain really</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="5.37">quickly my opinion on what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="280.05" dur="6.72">with kim jeong-hoon getting away from</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="9.75">the table because the actual story</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="9.929">that&amp;#39;s out about this is talking about</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="8.16">how president Trump has cancelled the</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="5.611">North Korea summit right now what was</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="3.66">the the insider baseball and all that is</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="4.889">basically that people have speculated</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="6.81">that China had gone back to the table</text>
  <text start="307.199" dur="5.931">with kim jong hoon after Mike Pompeo is</text>
  <text start="310.59" dur="5.52">visit and what ever happened between</text>
  <text start="313.13" dur="5.909">China and North Korea has actually</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="5.01">affected the relationship now between</text>
  <text start="319.039" dur="4.991">China or North Korea in the United</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="5.25">States in regard to this upcoming summit</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="4.92">so what could have happened and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="6.18">my speculative thought for this</text>
  <text start="328.95" dur="6.23">particular scenario as I see it you have</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="6.21">Donald Trump and the Americans trying to</text>
  <text start="335.18" dur="7.33">give North Korea an option to join the</text>
  <text start="338.76" dur="6.089">American faction Global faction if you</text>
  <text start="342.51" dur="6.15">will to get certain protections and</text>
  <text start="344.849" dur="6.991">trade and to you know to be to be able</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="5.039">to work with American dollars and trade</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="5.549">in American dollars and basically join</text>
  <text start="353.699" dur="4.771">the petrel dollar complex and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="357.389" dur="5.161">lot of benefits that can be offered</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="7.319">through that and I think that Kim</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="7.2">jong-un was probably excited at that</text>
  <text start="365.789" dur="6.451">prospect but they could be doing a</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="5.13">couple different things here imagine if</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="4.17">China came to them and said look we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="374.88" dur="3.659">the second largest economy in the world</text>
  <text start="376.41" dur="4.74">and we can do everything that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="378.539" dur="6.301">is promising you and you&amp;#39;ll continue to</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="5.79">be our buffer state between American</text>
  <text start="384.84" dur="4.41">aggression and the South China Sea and</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="4.08">all the territorial disputes they have</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="4.2">to have a distraction because China I</text>
  <text start="391.02" dur="5.88">think realizes right now that if North</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="6.75">Korea were to establish this peace</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="6.72">with the United States that once they</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="6.63">would once they stop being the basically</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="6.86">bad actor the focus of attention for all</text>
  <text start="406.83" dur="7.98">of our you know sanctions and and</text>
  <text start="410.48" dur="6.67">threats and rhetoric and basically our</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="7.44">whole disinformation campaign against</text>
  <text start="417.15" dur="6.36">the North Korea North Korean regime what</text>
  <text start="422.25" dur="3.3">do you think is going to happen next</text>
  <text start="423.51" dur="5.52">when there&amp;#39;s no one left in the in the</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="5.19">Asian Pacific to be the bad guy well</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="4.32">China realizes I think that they will</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="4.08">become that bad guy not that they</text>
  <text start="433.35" dur="3.6">haven&amp;#39;t already been getting so much</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="4.86">flack from Trump and others in our</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="6.14">government regarding their trade</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="6.21">policies the the unfair unfairly</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="6.55">imbalanced trade deficits all of the</text>
  <text start="445.89" dur="5.52">things that are likely to be important</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="5.19">to be highlighted between US and China</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="5.19">that there&amp;#39;s these stark differences in</text>
  <text start="454.83" dur="3.54">how we&amp;#39;re treated as countries globally</text>
  <text start="456.6" dur="3.9">you know China&amp;#39;s economy is still</text>
  <text start="458.37" dur="5.55">considered a developing economy which</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="5.79">actually gets them many different</text>
  <text start="463.92" dur="5.4">benefits and many exemptions from</text>
  <text start="466.29" dur="5.07">certain global laws because of their</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="3.48">status as a developing economy is</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="4.05">although they are the second largest</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="5.22">economy in the world but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.41" dur="5.97">underdeveloped in a lot of other in many</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="5.43">certain other aspects if you look at</text>
  <text start="481.38" dur="5.64">their society they still have huge</text>
  <text start="483.45" dur="6.45">swathes of unemployed homeless people</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="4.44">who are living so far below the poverty</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="3.48">line that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s incredible a</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="4.98">majority of their population I believe</text>
  <text start="493.38" dur="4.86">so what they realize is that they need</text>
  <text start="496.44" dur="7.5">to get North Korea to sign on to be</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="7.29">basically come more of a communist even</text>
  <text start="503.94" dur="4.08">though they are already communist in</text>
  <text start="505.53" dur="4.71">nature and but they are dictatorship</text>
  <text start="508.02" dur="4.56">basically they want them to say okay</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="4.47">well you sign on for the the Chinese</text>
  <text start="512.58" dur="3.69">model instead of the American model</text>
  <text start="514.71" dur="4.43">because you don&amp;#39;t want democracy in your</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="4.89">country Kim and you don&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="519.14" dur="4.3">capitalism in your country if unless</text>
  <text start="521.16" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s regulated capitalism not free</text>
  <text start="523.44" dur="5.61">capitalism so the capitalism that they</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="3.45">are trying to instill in it are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.05" dur="3">offering to kim jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="2.73">and part as a part of the package</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="2.63">because I think that&amp;#39;s the one of the</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="3.66">bigger selling points is that the</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="6.52">economically starved nation of North</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="5.94">Korea is just seeking basically anyone</text>
  <text start="541.2" dur="4.05">who&amp;#39;s willing to throw a life raft to</text>
  <text start="542.91" dur="3.78">them economically because that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="3.329">where they&amp;#39;re being hit the hardest</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="3.209">especially with American sanctions that</text>
  <text start="548.579" dur="4.38">have been backed by the international</text>
  <text start="549.899" dur="6.69">community so this is what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="552.959" dur="6.511">with North Korea and so that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="556.589" dur="4.5">opinion on why and how China came to</text>
  <text start="559.47" dur="4.049">North Korea behind the scenes and</text>
  <text start="561.089" dur="4.56">basically tried or is trying to make</text>
  <text start="563.519" dur="7.38">them a better offer and telling them to</text>
  <text start="565.649" dur="9.031">basically walk away from the American</text>
  <text start="570.899" dur="5.611">deal and walk over to them now the</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="3.48">disinformation part of this is</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="4.92">interesting because if you think about</text>
  <text start="578.16" dur="5.82">it what what would this be if it were</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="5.64">being the 3d chess that this game could</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="5.46">be there&amp;#39;s a nuclear site that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="587.07" dur="4.47">blown up right and they said now the</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="5.72">North Koreans are saying we did it like</text>
  <text start="591.54" dur="6.63">isn&amp;#39;t they the North Koreans did this</text>
  <text start="595.16" dur="5.38">okay was that a show of good faith or</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="4.38">was that facility already destroyed or</text>
  <text start="600.54" dur="6.63">was that facility destroyed in response</text>
  <text start="602.55" dur="6.65">to Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s comments about the vice</text>
  <text start="607.17" dur="5.49">president and then him basically</text>
  <text start="609.2" dur="6.639">deciding to walk away from this deal for</text>
  <text start="612.66" dur="5.82">temporarily these are all good questions</text>
  <text start="615.839" dur="4.411">I&amp;#39;m not sure which one is the truth but</text>
  <text start="618.48" dur="5.609">I can tell you that it certainly would</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="7.11">be one of those and in my opinion the</text>
  <text start="624.089" dur="7.591">most likely of them is that this was a</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="6.21">response or it was already done and that</text>
  <text start="631.68" dur="4.83">North Korea is just trying to save face</text>
  <text start="633.57" dur="4.91">by saying that they did it and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="636.51" dur="4.05">part of what the disinformation is and</text>
  <text start="638.48" dur="5.32">the fact that it&amp;#39;s all coming through</text>

  <text start="1033.079" dur="5.83">what this article is basically</text>
  <text start="1035.01" dur="5.909">suggesting is that the spy which they</text>

  <text start="1537.11" dur="4.83">the most important thing and what is</text>
  <text start="1538.76" dur="4.95">that well it is always God and God is</text>
  <text start="1541.94" dur="4.41">the number one most important thing that</text>
  <text start="1543.71" dur="7.16">we all have to look to every day in</text>
  <text start="1546.35" dur="4.52">order to understand and make the world</text>
  <text start="1552.01" dur="6.7">make the world see the good in God and</text>
  <text start="1554.69" dur="6.3">the good of God and in that sense then</text>
  <text start="1558.71" dur="7.55">we can see a lot more for ourselves and</text>
  <text start="1560.99" dur="10.17">so today I want to read a very very</text>
  <text start="1566.26" dur="7.27">strong and powerful quote from the book</text>
  <text start="1571.16" dur="5.67">of 1st Corinthians and it&amp;#39;s chapter 3</text>
  <text start="1573.53" dur="7.53">verses 18 it&amp;#39;s talking about the follies</text>
  <text start="1576.83" dur="6.6">of human wisdom so what we have to do is</text>
  <text start="1581.06" dur="6.14">temper ourselves and what I mean by that</text>
  <text start="1583.43" dur="7.17">is everything we do has to be</text>
  <text start="1587.2" dur="6.37">where we seek God&amp;#39;s wisdom we seek God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1590.6" dur="4.65">glory we seek God&amp;#39;s guidance and we seek</text>
  <text start="1593.57" dur="4.14">these things from the Lord on a daily</text>
  <text start="1595.25" dur="4.13">basis because we inherently understand</text>
  <text start="1597.71" dur="4.829">that our own wisdom and our own</text>
  <text start="1599.38" dur="5.5">intuition is not perfect and that it is</text>
  <text start="1602.539" dur="7.291">flawed and it&amp;#39;s only perfect and and</text>
  <text start="1604.88" dur="7.289">truly correct vision of what could be</text>
  <text start="1609.83" dur="5.88">and and wisdom what it should be</text>
  <text start="1612.169" dur="5.73">is God&amp;#39;s and although it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="1615.71" dur="6.75">never going to be possible I think for</text>
  <text start="1617.899" dur="7.201">us to truly attain the full scope of</text>
  <text start="1622.46" dur="5.64">God&amp;#39;s wisdom until maybe we pass and we</text>
  <text start="1625.1" dur="4.62">join him in heaven but while we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="1628.1" dur="3.299">on earth that we have to seek that we</text>
  <text start="1629.72" dur="6.51">have to always remind ourselves that we</text>
  <text start="1631.399" dur="6.51">do not know everything because as I go</text>
  <text start="1636.23" dur="5">through this information with you guys</text>
  <text start="1637.909" dur="5.61">here just in the Q post that I</text>
  <text start="1641.23" dur="4.569">understand I take that second to always</text>
  <text start="1643.519" dur="5.64">humble myself and to remind myself every</text>
  <text start="1645.799" dur="6.51">day that only through God will I ever</text>
  <text start="1649.159" dur="5.12">gain the glory of of everlasting life</text>
  <text start="1652.309" dur="3.931">and that that is what matters and that</text>
  <text start="1654.279" dur="3.431">reporting on this information and</text>
  <text start="1656.24" dur="4.439">bringing all this stuff to you guys is</text>
  <text start="1657.71" dur="4.559">is super important because you know we</text>
  <text start="1660.679" dur="4.5">have to shine a light on the darkness</text>
  <text start="1662.269" dur="7.711">and we have to bring the truth against</text>
  <text start="1665.179" dur="7.531">this false narrative and we have to</text>
  <text start="1669.98" dur="7.079">bring good where there was evil and we</text>
  <text start="1672.71" dur="7.559">have to shed God&amp;#39;s light where these</text>
  <text start="1677.059" dur="6.301">these truly troublesome and and terrible</text>
  <text start="1680.269" dur="5.971">things have happened but what we should</text>
  <text start="1683.36" dur="4.89">not fall victim to is the folly of our</text>
  <text start="1686.24" dur="4.139">own human wisdom and this is what first</text>
  <text start="1688.25" dur="4.62">Corinthians says it says no one should</text>
  <text start="1690.379" dur="4.981">deceive himself if anyone among you</text>
  <text start="1692.87" dur="4.019">thinks he is wise in this age he must</text>
  <text start="1695.36" dur="4.019">become foolish so that he can become</text>
  <text start="1696.889" dur="5.01">wise for the wisdom of this world is</text>
  <text start="1699.379" dur="5.191">foolishness with God since it is written</text>
  <text start="1701.899" dur="5.191">he catches the wise in their craftiness</text>
  <text start="1704.57" dur="6.51">and again the Lord knows the reasonings</text>
  <text start="1707.09" dur="6.179">of the wise that they are futile so no</text>
  <text start="1711.08" dur="5.579">one should boast in men for all things</text>
  <text start="1713.269" dur="6.61">are yours whether Paul or Apollo&amp;#39;s or</text>
  <text start="1716.659" dur="7.3">Cephas or the world or life or death</text>
  <text start="1719.879" dur="7.74">or things present or things or things to</text>

  <text start="1727.619" dur="6.9">Christ and Christ to God remember that</text>
  <text start="1731.94" dur="4.469">just remember that remember that we</text>
  <text start="1734.519" dur="4.2">should never deceive ourselves we should</text>
  <text start="1736.409" dur="5.07">never think that we know more than we</text>
  <text start="1738.719" dur="4.221">actually do because the minute that we</text>
  <text start="1741.479" dur="3.87">think that we&amp;#39;re right about everything</text>
  <text start="1742.94" dur="5.439">is the minute God will come in and</text>
  <text start="1745.349" dur="5.61">humble you once again by showing you</text>
  <text start="1748.379" dur="4.23">that you don&amp;#39;t know everything and that</text>
  <text start="1750.959" dur="5.42">is the folly of our own human wisdom</text>
  <text start="1752.609" dur="5.94">that we have to stay guarded against and</text>
  <text start="1756.379" dur="3.94">understand in ourselves that the only</text>
  <text start="1758.549" dur="4.23">true wisdom that&amp;#39;s available in this</text>

  <text start="1762.779" dur="6.69">one that&amp;#39;s truly worth fighting for</text>
  <text start="1764.789" dur="7.17">or trying to attain and you attain God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1769.469" dur="4.8">wisdom by abiding in God abiding in the</text>

  <text start="1774.269" dur="8.07">Christian sharing the values of what</text>

  <text start="1784.529" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;ve learned through Jesus Christ and</text>
  <text start="1785.849" dur="4.35">the Holy Spirit you must share those</text>
  <text start="1788.549" dur="4.05">things and you must live them on a daily</text>

  <text start="1803.279" dur="4.98">or wiser than God and the minute that</text>
  <text start="1806.039" dur="7.8">you start believing that unfortunately</text>
  <text start="1808.259" dur="8.431">is the same minute that you can possibly</text>
  <text start="1813.839" dur="5.61">lose your connection to God and nobody</text>
  <text start="1816.69" dur="3.989">ever and I don&amp;#39;t want that for you and I</text>
  <text start="1819.449" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t think that you want that for</text>
  <text start="1820.679" dur="7.53">yourself so just remember that um we</text>
  <text start="1824.339" dur="7.02">humans we tend to stumble and fall and</text>
