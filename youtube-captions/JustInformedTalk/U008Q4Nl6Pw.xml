  <text start="137.769" dur="7.591">quickly it&amp;#39;s a new one that&amp;#39;s just been</text>
  <text start="140.14" dur="6.78">posted eight hours ago so but I&amp;#39;ll break</text>
  <text start="145.36" dur="3.659">this I read through the article it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="4.89">really a great article uh well-written</text>
  <text start="149.019" dur="5.481">but what it says is that here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="151.81" dur="9.179">here&amp;#39;s the simple breakdown</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="10.299">Bill Clinton Lynch met at an airport in</text>
  <text start="160.989" dur="6.33">Arizona I believe and that meeting was</text>
  <text start="164.799" dur="4.741">not by chance but they&amp;#39;ve publicly</text>
  <text start="167.319" dur="4.051">stated that that meeting was completely</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="3.33">by chance that they just happen to</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="3.509">notice that one another was at the</text>
  <text start="172.87" dur="3.149">airport at the same time and decided to</text>
  <text start="174.879" dur="3.051">get together and have a friendly</text>
  <text start="176.019" dur="6.511">conversation about golf and their family</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="7.899">that&amp;#39;s the official story but but</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="4.769">according to a deeply buried revelation</text>
  <text start="185.829" dur="3.351">inside of the inspector general&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="187.299" dur="4.891">that was just released there&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="4.899">a report by the Secret Service that</text>
  <text start="192.19" dur="3.329">would be throwing a wrench directly into</text>
  <text start="194.079" dur="4.41">the narrative that&amp;#39;s being drawn by</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="4.291">Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton that</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="4.381">wrench would be that the Secret Service</text>
  <text start="199.81" dur="8.37">has reportedly stated on the record that</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="6.69">they were there they had previous</text>
  <text start="208.18" dur="6.54">knowledge of the meeting because they</text>
  <text start="209.56" dur="7.259">had to coordinate their security so that</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="3.87">being said that means that the United</text>
  <text start="216.819" dur="3.54">States Secret Service knew that the</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="3.66">acting Attorney General was going to go</text>
  <text start="220.359" dur="3.271">meet with the former president United</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="3.03">States whose wife was under</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="5.31">investigation by the Department of</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="6.09">Justice for allegedly stealing and</text>
  <text start="228.94" dur="5.939">storing classified and or I guess</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="6.06">storing listen rule storing not stealing</text>
  <text start="234.879" dur="4.47">heaven forbid we call it what it is but</text>
  <text start="237.43" dur="3.679">uh storing classified information on</text>
  <text start="239.349" dur="4.53">private servers that basically</text>
  <text start="241.109" dur="5.681">circumvented the you know freedom of</text>
  <text start="243.879" dur="7.98">information laws and things that make</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="6.69">public record a federal law if you try</text>
  <text start="251.859" dur="6.901">to avoid keeping things on the public</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="6.66">record so unfortunately this all has</text>
  <text start="258.76" dur="2.759">blown up in their face it would seem</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="3.269">because Loretta Lynch is being called</text>
  <text start="261.519" dur="3.051">out by her I believe Secret Service</text>
  <text start="263.409" dur="4.671">detail in</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="5.94">this note or her security detail and the</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="4.23">Secret Service had coordinated or her</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="4.95">security detail in the Secret Service of</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="5.49">Bill Clinton had coordinated with her to</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="4.38">set up this meeting now who knows how</text>
  <text start="277.8" dur="4.17">far in advance it was the report here on</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="4.47">the blaze doesn&amp;#39;t go on that but it</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="4.23">could have been anywhere from them</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="4.59">calling an hour ahead and saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="4.05">flying this airport let&amp;#39;s meet up or it</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="3.72">could although we go back to you know</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="4.65">week before saying hey you&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="4.32">in that airport that day or you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="3.39">that in this part of the country let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="4.5">meet here where nobody&amp;#39;s gonna be able</text>
  <text start="298.29" dur="4.86">to see it and the reports the legend</text>
  <text start="301.44" dur="2.61">reports coming out of this meeting for</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="2.76">those of you who don&amp;#39;t know why the</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="4.26">Lynch Clinton tarmac meeting is so</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="4.65">important as I&amp;#39;ve described before it</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.74">was the acting Attorney General sitting</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="5.37">going for a private meeting with the</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="4.32">husband of a woman who has been who was</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="5.36">under investigation by the Department of</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="7.59">Justice obviously showing a very very</text>
  <text start="321.29" dur="5.77">there&amp;#39;s a possibility of a credible bias</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="5.52">if they were meeting to discuss that</text>
  <text start="327.06" dur="5.04">case right and the alleged reports out</text>
  <text start="330.48" dur="4.17">of that meeting are suggesting that</text>
  <text start="332.1" dur="4.68">things were offered like Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="4.59">was offered allegedly this is all</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="5.01">conjectures not been verified yet but</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="4.98">she was offered allegedly from Bill</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="5.04">Clinton a position on the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="344.22" dur="5.97">in exchange for clearing his wife</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="6.18">Hillary Clinton who could possibly have</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="4.59">become the next president United States</text>
  <text start="353.01" dur="4.17">at that time and most of them believed</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="4.62">it would happen so therefore that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="357.18" dur="3.66">this is important to look at and q is</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="4.82">telling us that he United States Secret</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="5.64">Service because their information</text>
  <text start="364.22" dur="4.99">mentioned in probably a footnote of the</text>
  <text start="366.48" dur="5.85">IG report has actually turned out to be</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="7.53">completely counter to the narrative that</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="6.78">has been described by Loretta Lynch and</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="4.07">Bill Clinton they think they say it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="5.45">chance encounter that there was no</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="6.04">coordination to it and that there was no</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="3.67">it was just a random chance they have</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="3.74">miss each other that has turned out to</text>
  <text start="388.23" dur="4.56">be completely untrue so you know hey</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="4.06">take that with a grain of salt I guess</text>
  <text start="392.79" dur="3.56">but you know at least we&amp;#39;re trying here</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="5">to tell the truth and</text>
  <text start="396.35" dur="4.8">not many others are so the next one is</text>
  <text start="399.65" dur="2.73">interesting because we talked about in</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="3.51">this last video if you guys want to go</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="3.6">back and watch it we talked about in a</text>
  <text start="404.66" dur="2.7">few other of the videos we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="405.98" dur="4.2">about like an Tifa we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="4.17">what happened in Portland how these</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="3.3">people were attacked they were just</text>
  <text start="411.53" dur="3.39">going for a prayer March and yeah a lot</text>
  <text start="413.48" dur="3.21">of them are patriots a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="414.92" dur="3.96">conservative some of them are kind of</text>
  <text start="416.69" dur="4.44">loony but there&amp;#39;s always gonna be</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="3.78">loonies I mean it&amp;#39;s what are you gonna</text>
  <text start="421.13" dur="3.42">say that&amp;#39;s America right that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="422.66" dur="3.71">makes America great is that people have</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="4.08">differing opinions and we have great</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="6.25">conversations and discussions about how</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="7.2">we disagree right but at t foot went and</text>
  <text start="432.62" dur="6.78">they threw their their little temper</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="5.67">tantrum and got the protest shut down</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="4.53">basically forgot that the March shut</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="4.77">down the prayer march permit vote and</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="5.43">then the it was declared a riot by the</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="4.53">police and I think a lot of didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="3.15">as far as the last time I read this</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="5.28">article not many arrests have been made</text>
  <text start="452.51" dur="7.02">in regard to people associated with the</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="5.19">actual protests more overly there were</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="3.3">people who were just randomly picked up</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="3.51">through the protests that already had</text>
  <text start="462.83" dur="5.7">outstanding warrants and other things</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="7.32">but this story in himself was talking</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="4.8">about how you know I basically wondering</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="3">the fact that it&amp;#39;s crazy you look at</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="3.78">these people that they have these masks</text>
  <text start="475.1" dur="3.99">on they look like terrorists they they</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="3.45">do these awful things to people who are</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="4.56">just trying to exercise the free speech</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="5.19">and it&amp;#39;s completely it&amp;#39;s crazy to watch</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="4.44">people who call themselves anti-fascist</text>
  <text start="485.75" dur="3.96">act like fascists in the streets but</text>
  <text start="488.09" dur="3.3">then something really clicked when Q</text>
  <text start="489.71" dur="3.69">posted this next one and I think it</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="4.08">speaks exactly to what that is it says</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="4.74">there will be no civil war coordinating</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="4.59">is M hysteria designed to instill fear</text>

  <text start="526.7" dur="3.99">can&amp;#39;t look to the the most extreme</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="7.5">answer</text>

  <text start="2346.78" dur="7.65">psychological warfare that&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="2349.57" dur="6.84">on for decades and even I myself am NOT</text>

  <text start="2378.07" dur="5.61">you everything that we&amp;#39;ve done here is</text>
  <text start="2381.18" dur="4.36">for the betterment of our country I mean</text>
  <text start="2383.68" dur="3.12">people want to cause conspiracy</text>
  <text start="2385.54" dur="3.72">theorists they&amp;#39;re going to cause these</text>
  <text start="2386.8" dur="5.37">these alt-right nuts and that we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="2389.26" dur="4.83">just a bunch of Nazis apparently but the</text>
  <text start="2392.17" dur="4.62">reality is is that we&amp;#39;re just very</text>
  <text start="2394.09" dur="4.56">sensible rational logical people who are</text>
  <text start="2396.79" dur="4.41">asking questions and are trying to get</text>
  <text start="2398.65" dur="4.38">answers especially because we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="2401.2" dur="3.27">told that there&amp;#39;s a lot more going on</text>
  <text start="2403.03" dur="4.59">beneath the surface since being then is</text>
  <text start="2404.47" dur="4.8">being presented to us publicly and there</text>
  <text start="2407.62" dur="4.71">are evil doers who are trying to commit</text>
  <text start="2409.27" dur="5.76">harm against us that we don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="2412.33" dur="9.6">and those that want to commit those acts</text>
  <text start="2415.03" dur="11.19">of evil those who are so rushed to</text>
  <text start="2421.93" dur="7.5">destroy our ability to have free speech</text>
  <text start="2426.22" dur="6.18">free thought and all of that they need</text>
  <text start="2429.43" dur="5.28">to take good long hard look in the</text>
  <text start="2432.4" dur="4.25">mirror and ask themselves what happens</text>
  <text start="2434.71" dur="6.78">when this comes back around on me</text>
  <text start="2436.65" dur="7.47">because at this point as God says he</text>
  <text start="2441.49" dur="4.92">will protect us from the evil doers and</text>
  <text start="2444.12" dur="3.58">they will scheme against us and they</text>
  <text start="2446.41" dur="4.17">will do all their plots to try to</text>
  <text start="2447.7" dur="5.94">undermine us and subvert us but if we</text>
  <text start="2450.58" dur="6.84">put our ultimate faith in God and we</text>
  <text start="2453.64" dur="7.08">love one another which is important we</text>
  <text start="2457.42" dur="5.55">will be successful we&amp;#39;ll overcome this</text>
  <text start="2460.72" dur="4.2">this will not end in a civil war won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2462.97" dur="4.41">end in anything like that what it will</text>
  <text start="2464.92" dur="4.59">end in is is hopefully a positive</text>
  <text start="2467.38" dur="5.13">outcome where we all come together and</text>
  <text start="2469.51" dur="4.62">say look we&amp;#39;ve agreed these things are</text>
