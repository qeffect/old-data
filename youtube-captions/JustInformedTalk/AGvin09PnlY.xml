  <text start="5.45" dur="4.54">concerned that Nancy Pelosi and others</text>
  <text start="8.16" dur="4.29">can&amp;#39;t be trusted with this kind of</text>
  <text start="9.99" dur="4.26">information well I guess the only thing</text>
  <text start="12.45" dur="4.11">is they were talking about why didn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="14.25" dur="4.529">give the information to Adam Schiff and</text>
  <text start="16.56" dur="3.9">his committee and the answer is because</text>
  <text start="18.779" dur="4.021">I think Adam Schiff is the biggest</text>
  <text start="20.46" dur="4.14">linker in Washington you know that I</text>
  <text start="22.8" dur="3">know that we all know that I&amp;#39;ve watched</text>
  <text start="24.6" dur="3.81">Adam Schiff leak</text>
  <text start="25.8" dur="6.059">he&amp;#39;s a corrupt politician he&amp;#39;s a leaker</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="5.34">like nobody&amp;#39;s ever seen before we had a</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="4.561">very good conversation with the</text>
  <text start="33.75" dur="4.53">Ukrainian president the conversation was</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="4.409">was perfect they don&amp;#39;t even talk about</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="4.17">the conversation it started with a</text>
  <text start="40.829" dur="3.631">whistleblower now they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="42.45" dur="3.78">whistleblower then they had a second</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="4.23">whistleblower now they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="46.23" dur="5.25">second whistleblower the reason is that</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="4.68">when the whistleblower when they saw was</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="4.649">the whistleblower wrote and then when I</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="4.709">released the conversation which for no</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="4.291">relationship to what the whistle blows</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="4.5">off they said their case was out the</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="6.059">window and I think it&amp;#39;s a disgrace</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="7.11">in a nutshell a whistleblower wrote a</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="4.621">false narrative of the conversation now</text>
  <text start="69.689" dur="3.93">they don&amp;#39;t want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="4.47">whistleblower because they didn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="4.951">I was going to release the conversation</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="6.229">when I released the conversation I blew</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="6.6">up shifts act and just to finish it off</text>
  <text start="81.799" dur="5.831">Adam Schiff went up before Congress and</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="4.53">he made up by words he</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="5.04">copy what I said he didn&amp;#39;t know him</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="5.279">probably at the time nobody thought I</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.59">was going to release the conversation I</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="4.921">got the approval from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="97.26" dur="4.56">once I released the conversation this</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="3.87">thing all died and that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="4.53">should be looking and Adam Schiff went</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="6.03">before Congress and Adam Schiff what he</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="5.51">did will never be forgotten he made up a</text>
  <text start="109.8" dur="4.709">conversation that was a phony</text>
  <text start="111.86" dur="4.21">fabrication who was a fraud and people</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="4.051">shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to get away they</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="4.59">say he has immunity because he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="118.56" dur="4.26">member of Congress people shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="120.66" dur="4.44">allowed to do that that&amp;#39;s a criminal act</text>

  <text start="323.79" dur="4.53">the assertion that Baghdady</text>

  <text start="336.54" dur="7.5">progressive journalism and I say that in</text>
  <text start="341.13" dur="8.12">the worst possible way because this to</text>

  <text start="367.02" dur="4.38">a martyr isn&amp;#39;t that exactly what</text>
  <text start="369" dur="4.68">president Trump&amp;#39;s trying to keep from</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="4.53">happening by explaining the truth of the</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="4.23">situation how he was a coward how he ran</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="3.39">into a tunnel with a bunch of children</text>
  <text start="377.91" dur="3.96">and then decided to take his own life</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="4.92">and the lives of those children while he</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="4.32">was probably crying and a whimpering</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="7.88">like a like his president Trump said</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="10.38">like a dog this is the kind of you know</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="6.49">anti-american craziness that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="3.54">and these are the same people who are a</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="3.81">part of the establishment they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="6.12">basically just mouthpieces for the</text>
  <text start="402.42" dur="6.84">globalist deep state cabal and all they</text>
  <text start="406.23" dur="4.77">want to do is sow the seeds of division</text>
  <text start="409.26" dur="3.9">and to undermine President Trump they</text>
  <text start="411" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t care about this country they care</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="5.19">more about making sure that President</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="6.5">Trump doesn&amp;#39;t come out on top in any way</text>
  <text start="418.35" dur="6.06">for anything even when he takes out a</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="7.6">known despicable</text>
  <text start="424.41" dur="6.87">evil terrorist who has been it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="5.25">documented that this person is a</text>
  <text start="431.28" dur="6.86">sadistic animal who has killed many many</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="5.79">people and hurt others many others so I</text>
  <text start="438.14" dur="4.87">just have to start here because it kind</text>

  <text start="443.01" dur="3.45">apparently singing now I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="4.74">this is true but story came out today on</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="4.08">this Paul Preston&amp;#39;s report here I just</text>
  <text start="449.19" dur="2.64">found this article where they were</text>

  <text start="963.85" dur="2.67">interesting when I saw that I figured it</text>
  <text start="965.32" dur="3.66">was worth looking at not to mention</text>
  <text start="966.52" dur="4.98">here&amp;#39;s another story Susan Rice&amp;#39;s rice</text>

  <text start="1797.579" dur="2.64">really important it kind of goes in with</text>
  <text start="1799.049" dur="3.42">the scripture we talked about yesterday</text>
  <text start="1800.219" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s out of the same book Philippians</text>
  <text start="1802.469" dur="4.29">and now we&amp;#39;re in chapter 3 and I want to</text>

  <text start="1806.759" dur="4.721">goal and this is chapter 3 verse 12</text>
  <text start="1809.519" dur="3.701">through 21</text>
  <text start="1811.48" dur="4.079">and I want to read this to you it says</text>
  <text start="1813.22" dur="5.069">not that I have already reached the goal</text>
  <text start="1815.559" dur="5.011">or am already fully mature but I make</text>
  <text start="1818.289" dur="4.35">every effort to take hold of it because</text>
  <text start="1820.57" dur="2.609">I also have been taken hold of by Christ</text>

  <text start="1835.059" dur="5.37">heavenly call in Christ Jesus therefore</text>
  <text start="1837.73" dur="4.559">all who are mature should think this way</text>
  <text start="1840.429" dur="4.47">and if you think differently about</text>
  <text start="1842.289" dur="5.281">anything God will reveal this to you</text>
  <text start="1844.899" dur="5.49">also in any case we should live up to</text>

  <text start="1854.83" dur="5.309">have in us for I have often told you and</text>
  <text start="1857.679" dur="4.801">now say again with tears that many live</text>

  <text start="1870.25" dur="5.73">our citizenship is in heaven from which</text>
  <text start="1872.95" dur="5.67">we also eagerly wait for a savior the</text>
  <text start="1875.98" dur="4.5">Lord Jesus Christ he will transform the</text>

  <text start="1888.19" dur="4.199">this verse touches your heart as it</text>
  <text start="1890.679" dur="4.59">touched mine I hope it gives you an idea</text>
  <text start="1892.389" dur="6.15">of how we reach forward to God&amp;#39;s goal</text>
  <text start="1895.269" dur="5.061">and how we understand that God will</text>
  <text start="1898.539" dur="6.99">transform the body of our humble</text>

  <text start="1905.529" dur="7.86">glorious body by the power that enables</text>
  <text start="1908.44" dur="7.68">him to subject everything to himself so</text>
  <text start="1913.389" dur="5.341">we have to just submit ourselves to</text>
  <text start="1916.12" dur="5.25">God&amp;#39;s awesome and glorious power and his</text>
  <text start="1918.73" dur="4.65">plan and his grace and His mercy and we</text>
  <text start="1921.37" dur="5.13">have to ask God to help us live a humble</text>
  <text start="1923.38" dur="6">and righteous and strong and faithful</text>
  <text start="1926.5" dur="4.47">life because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="1929.38" dur="3.99">important than anything that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1930.97" dur="4.65">in this world all these things we talked</text>
  <text start="1933.37" dur="5.49">about here these these crimes and these</text>
  <text start="1935.62" dur="6.16">these betrayals and these spies and</text>
  <text start="1938.86" dur="5.39">these whistleblowers and this and that</text>
  <text start="1941.78" dur="6.84">ultimately it&amp;#39;s all gonna end up being</text>
  <text start="1944.25" dur="7.83">meaningless now God does say you know</text>
  <text start="1948.62" dur="5.77">there&amp;#39;s a time to stand in righteous</text>
  <text start="1952.08" dur="4.89">indignation against this evil and</text>
  <text start="1954.39" dur="6.33">injustice that is in this modern age but</text>
  <text start="1956.97" dur="6.27">we also have to temper that with the</text>
  <text start="1960.72" dur="4.05">teachings of the gospel and what Jesus</text>
  <text start="1963.24" dur="2.97">taught us to do and how we need to</text>
  <text start="1964.77" dur="3.21">remind ourselves every day is as</text>
  <text start="1966.21" dur="4.89">difficult as it may be and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1967.98" dur="6.99">definitely imperfect and I am NOT a free</text>
  <text start="1971.1" dur="6.84">of sin by any means but we have to</text>
  <text start="1974.97" dur="7.89">remind ourselves every day that as long</text>
  <text start="1977.94" dur="7.92">as we put God first and remember that</text>
  <text start="1982.86" dur="6.36">our citizenship is in heaven and we will</text>
  <text start="1985.86" dur="7.46">be saved and we will understand how to</text>
