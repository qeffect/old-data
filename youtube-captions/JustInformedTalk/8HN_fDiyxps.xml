  <text start="100.86" dur="3.539">what is this of course this is the last</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="4.729">post we got from Q right here which</text>
  <text start="104.399" dur="6.271">basically says it talks about the the</text>
  <text start="107.149" dur="6.101">Democrat Party Khan as a whole right and</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="6.199">it talks about how they raise money</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="5.67">through funneling tax dollars into</text>
  <text start="116.869" dur="4.78">organizations like Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="6.57">who in turn spend millions and millions</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="7.47">of dollars on political donations and</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="5.829">other sort of political quid pro quo</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="6.01">type setups that</text>
  <text start="131.319" dur="6.271">is just one example of many of how the</text>
  <text start="135.129" dur="5.73">reason that the bureaucracies tends to</text>
  <text start="137.59" dur="5.129">generate itself and fun and to be like a</text>
  <text start="140.859" dur="3.6">self powering engines because once you</text>
  <text start="142.719" dur="4.561">put a politician in office right and</text>
  <text start="144.459" dur="4.051">then they say oh we&amp;#39;re gonna give 1.5</text>
  <text start="147.28" dur="3.539">billion dollars to Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="148.51" dur="3.959">over the next three years and then you</text>
  <text start="150.819" dur="4.711">look at Planned Parenthood spending</text>
  <text start="152.469" dur="7.35">between thirty and sixty million dollars</text>
  <text start="155.53" dur="8.429">a year in influence to influence outcome</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="5.911">of the 2018 midterm elections or you</text>
  <text start="163.959" dur="3.541">know that much money to influence</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="3.3">outcome of elections I wonder where that</text>
  <text start="167.5" dur="4.049">money is funneling back to I think</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="2.879">that&amp;#39;s what Q want us to look at and it</text>
  <text start="171.549" dur="2.55">talked</text>
  <text start="171.909" dur="5.01">told us to look back at like Soros and</text>
  <text start="174.099" dur="4.29">taxpayer funding and it was basically</text>
  <text start="176.919" dur="2.94">giving us this example of an</text>
  <text start="178.389" dur="2.791">organization like Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="179.859" dur="1.951">whether you agree with it or disagree</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="2.639">with it</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="3.629">if this is actually what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="3.331">which I mean according to the paperwork</text>
  <text start="185.439" dur="4.02">and the numbers I&amp;#39;ve looked at the their</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="4.819">filings in Planned Parenthood and they</text>
  <text start="189.459" dur="6.27">actually count for this this money so</text>
  <text start="191.969" dur="6.1">you know and and that&amp;#39;s part of their</text>
  <text start="195.729" dur="5.13">their game so that&amp;#39;s what I think he</text>
  <text start="198.069" dur="6.12">wants us to look back at of course Q</text>
  <text start="200.859" dur="5.97">says here last post before going dark</text>
  <text start="204.189" dur="4.8">regarding Planned Parenthood what events</text>
  <text start="206.829" dur="4.62">followed that post coincidence and ons</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="3.99">understand Q now what could he be</text>
  <text start="211.449" dur="4.41">talking about well I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="212.979" dur="4.62">guys haven&amp;#39;t seen this clip yet it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.859" dur="4.861">it&amp;#39;s a very disturbing clip now this is</text>
  <text start="217.599" dur="5.07">a tweet from charlie kirk and he says it</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="4.439">mildly he says nothing to see here just</text>
  <text start="222.669" dur="5.1">a sitting Democrat governor governor of</text>
  <text start="225.159" dur="4.86">Virginia talking about how babies should</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="4.771">be comforted out of the womb and then</text>
  <text start="230.019" dur="4.59">killed see it for yourself the Democrats</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="4.559">are the party of infanticide where is</text>
  <text start="234.609" dur="6.12">the media on this and then it says RT so</text>
  <text start="237.099" dur="5.82">look let me explain what this guy says</text>
  <text start="240.729" dur="4.141">you know I&amp;#39;m gonna spare you the clip</text>
  <text start="242.919" dur="4.891">because you guys have probably already</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="5.009">seen it by now but this guy basically</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="6.149">says he&amp;#39;s the governor of Virginia he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.879" dur="5.73">on this radio show and he says look when</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="4.351">you take the baby out of the womb and</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="4.201">there&amp;#39;s this late term abortion and he</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="3.239">makes the direct reference to late term</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="3.57">abortion and then he talks about how</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="3.781">they would actually remove the baby from</text>
  <text start="263.38" dur="3.81">the womb and then make it comfortable</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="3.63">and then consult the parents and the</text>
  <text start="267.19" dur="3.21">doctors would consult with the parents</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="4.62">as to what they should do next and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="6.75">like what like what are you talking</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="6.3">about that is to me first of all that is</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="5.269">literally murder right I mean you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="4.86">kill another living human being</text>
  <text start="282.419" dur="5.081">there&amp;#39;s no laws on the books that say</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="4.32">this is legal except these crazy state</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="3.36">laws that are coming out like out of New</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="3.99">York where you know they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="4.38">third term abortions are illegal now you</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="4.289">can think or whatever you want about</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="4.349">abortions right my personal opinion is</text>
  <text start="297.339" dur="4.561">I&amp;#39;m pro-life I think all life is</text>
  <text start="299.589" dur="4.771">valuable and I would always argue that</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="5.009">that whatever we can do to help save</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="4.35">lives is what we should do but wherever</text>
  <text start="306.909" dur="4.531">you fall on this issue you need to</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="6.5">remember that these people now are just</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="6.659">openly talking about committing as</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="5.05">Charlie cook / charlie Kirk puts it and</text>
  <text start="318.099" dur="3.391">fantasise it would seem if there if</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="3.659">there are actually proponents of the</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="5.97">policies that they&amp;#39;re describing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="5.851">it&amp;#39;s insanity it&amp;#39;s crazy right and then</text>
  <text start="327.46" dur="6.6">of course along with that came this we</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="8">have this incredible slew of stories and</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="7.56">the news cycle has just completely been</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="7.36">taken by storm with this because these</text>
  <text start="341.62" dur="7.2">people like Andrew Cuomo out in New York</text>
  <text start="345.13" dur="6.659">are literally signing laws that say you</text>
  <text start="348.82" dur="4.29">can do late term abortion meaning if</text>
  <text start="351.789" dur="3.171">there&amp;#39;s a baby in your womb now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="4.83">know how many of you have had a baby I</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="5.769">personally I&amp;#39;m not a woman so I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.94" dur="4.83">tell you but I can say it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="4.381">worth to just think about whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="4.019">a man or woman if you have a baby inside</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="4.32">of you and it&amp;#39;s nine months old and it</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="7.591">could be taken out and it could live</text>
  <text start="369.43" dur="6.9">right then there is no I don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="374.38" dur="3.93">the logic behind people saying oh yeah</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="3.63">well that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the woman&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="4.859">well no it&amp;#39;s I mean it&amp;#39;s a living</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="5.34">breathing being but I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="4.141">going to get too wrapped up in my own</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="4.44">opinions because I those were my</text>
  <text start="387.31" dur="3.69">opinions and that&amp;#39;s what cues telling us</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="3.51">to understand that this is not a</text>
  <text start="391" dur="3.719">coincidence that this issue has come up</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="3.99">for a reason he was giving us a</text>
  <text start="394.719" dur="5.811">forewarning to tell us this was coming</text>
  <text start="397.24" dur="6.17">and of course that&amp;#39;s another subtle</text>
  <text start="400.53" dur="5.979">future-proof spaz type deal alright so</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="6.039">the next one here that I&amp;#39;ll get into is</text>
  <text start="406.509" dur="5.19">actually this picture now this picture</text>
  <text start="409.449" dur="8.19">is pretty simple it&amp;#39;s of these two I</text>

  <text start="417.639" dur="5.37">that being said a few places you can</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="3.389">kind of find this the picture a lot of</text>
  <text start="423.009" dur="3.511">the Anton&amp;#39;s were really quick to point</text>
  <text start="424.449" dur="4.861">out that this picture was part of a</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="7.44">wikipedia posting that showed a pair of</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="6.449">US Air Force f-15e Strike Eagles fly</text>

  <text start="438.069" dur="5.13">airstrikes in Syria these aircrafts were</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="5.07">part of a large coalition strike package</text>
  <text start="443.199" dur="3.931">that was the first to strike ISIL</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="3.949">targets in Syria</text>

  <text start="458.319" dur="3.66">and on over on the boards had a really</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="4.41">great theory about this right it talks</text>
  <text start="461.979" dur="4.47">about how it&amp;#39;s too f-15e Strike Eagles</text>
  <text start="464.71" dur="3.9">and it says they have the long-range</text>
  <text start="466.449" dur="4.53">weapons packages with precision</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="5.339">capabilities and it gives kind of this</text>
  <text start="470.979" dur="5.881">breakdown of what the picture name is</text>
  <text start="473.949" dur="5.94">the file name the dot jpg it&amp;#39;s sis</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="5.91">underscore conf underscore respect</text>
  <text start="479.889" dur="4.201">underscore Y so what the anti over here</text>
  <text start="482.77" dur="3.239">said which I thought was very</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="4.259">interesting says system confirmation</text>
  <text start="486.009" dur="5.491">special weaponry and then it talks about</text>
  <text start="488.349" dur="5.16">how if you guys will remember February</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="3.84">15th is the deadline that was set by</text>
  <text start="493.509" dur="3.801">President Trump that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="495.34" dur="4.139">government will shut down again if the</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="5.02">Congress hasn&amp;#39;t come together and</text>
  <text start="499.479" dur="5.731">created a legislation that will provide</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="5.16">funding for the southern border wall so</text>
  <text start="505.21" dur="5.34">if they don&amp;#39;t get this done by February</text>
  <text start="507.49" dur="6.33">15th I think this was a little wink and</text>
  <text start="510.55" dur="5.34">a nod from cue saying look this is what</text>
  <text start="513.82" dur="3.959">the the deadline is it&amp;#39;s February 15th</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="3.12">and I think it&amp;#39;s kind of pointing to the</text>
  <text start="517.779" dur="2.76">fact that there will be an emergency</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="3.089">declared and that he&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="4.92">build the wall because obviously</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="4.921">President Trump has said here there was</text>
  <text start="525.459" dur="2.971">a recent this is another thing the end</text>
  <text start="527.02" dur="2.89">on points out which I was going to point</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="2.98">out in a video upcoming but</text>
  <text start="529.91" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;ll just point out here real quick is</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="4.65">that it says I think that by having the</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="4.289">shutdown we have set the table now</text>
  <text start="536.06" dur="2.82">President Trump said set the table you</text>
  <text start="537.949" dur="3.06">know he does these a little</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="4.68">tongue-in-cheek things with with us I</text>
  <text start="541.009" dur="4.741">think because and in the world I guess</text>
  <text start="543.56" dur="4.62">who everyone&amp;#39;s watching because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s part of the plan right the table</text>
  <text start="548.18" dur="3.959">was being set and the very next day we</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="3.299">have of course then come out but they</text>
  <text start="552.139" dur="4.021">say the stage was set for a February</text>

  <text start="730.19" dur="3.15">the interview itself where Maggie</text>
  <text start="731.9" dur="3.39">Haberman says but what do you see the</text>
  <text start="733.34" dur="3.99">role of the Free Press as what do you</text>
  <text start="735.29" dur="4.11">think the Free Press does and Trump says</text>
  <text start="737.33" dur="3.63">President Trump says it describes and</text>
  <text start="739.4" dur="3.84">should describe accurately what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="740.96" dur="4.17">on in anywhere it&amp;#39;s covering whether</text>
  <text start="743.24" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s a nation or a state or game or</text>
  <text start="745.13" dur="4.05">whatever and I really appreciate that</text>
  <text start="747.92" dur="3.51">now if you guys don&amp;#39;t remember who</text>
  <text start="749.18" dur="5.04">Maggie Haberman is she&amp;#39;s been referenced</text>
  <text start="751.43" dur="5.22">many times by cue and there&amp;#39;s been some</text>
  <text start="754.22" dur="5.01">tweets where it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s cryptic language</text>
  <text start="756.65" dur="5.19">about being on a train and conductors</text>
  <text start="759.23" dur="5.7">and you know messages seemingly being</text>
  <text start="761.84" dur="4.98">sent veiled messages but it says this</text>
  <text start="764.93" dur="3.78">was from Podesta&amp;#39;s emails this was</text>
  <text start="766.82" dur="3.93">Maggie Haberman when she was with</text>
  <text start="768.71" dur="4.17">Politico before she joined the New York</text>
  <text start="770.75" dur="4.62">Times where this is actually I think</text>

  <text start="789.44" dur="6.15">before never been disappointed we think</text>
  <text start="793.49" dur="3.649">we can achieve our objective and do the</text>
  <text start="795.59" dur="3.679">most shaping by going</text>
  <text start="797.139" dur="4.62">to Maggie oh of course you can cuz she&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="880.929" dur="3.84">it was a sea of seats we had the entire</text>

  <text start="895.209" dur="4.38">sorry we were in the security tent right</text>
  <text start="897.429" dur="3.63">and I think this is just indicative of</text>
  <text start="899.589" dur="3.54">President Trump throwing it back in her</text>
  <text start="901.059" dur="3.301">face and saying you know and you got to</text>

  <text start="906.519" dur="6.391">much the whole thing and President Trump</text>
  <text start="909.85" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s basically you can tell that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="912.91" dur="4.739">letting it down for Maggie and saying</text>
  <text start="914.829" dur="4.17">look this is what it is this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="917.649" dur="4.11">kind of asking all these different</text>
  <text start="918.999" dur="4.77">questions and there&amp;#39;s some neat little</text>
  <text start="921.759" dur="4.62">exchanges in there that are definitely</text>
  <text start="923.769" dur="5.731">worth looking at so I&amp;#39;m going to leave</text>

  <text start="936.39" dur="5.95">coming up in the news and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="939.25" dur="4.41">so another thing I always like to do is</text>
  <text start="942.34" dur="3.51">look at president Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter where</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="3.99">we have so much information that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="945.85" dur="3.78">always coming out I like to go back and</text>
  <text start="947.65" dur="4.71">read through these because I think</text>
  <text start="949.63" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s a lot of wisdom inside of what</text>
  <text start="952.36" dur="6.93">he says and the first thing I want to</text>
  <text start="953.71" dur="9.12">talk about is the fact that right here</text>
  <text start="959.29" dur="5.43">you can see they have basically come out</text>
  <text start="962.83" dur="5.43">with these stories in the news about how</text>
  <text start="964.72" dur="6.57">Don jr. made telephone calls to private</text>
  <text start="968.26" dur="6.57">numbers or from private number you know</text>

  <text start="1043.59" dur="7.92">where the the media just goes with any</text>
  <text start="1048.42" dur="4.71">story 100 miles an hour when they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1051.51" dur="3.9">even take the time to actually talk</text>

  <text start="1055.41" dur="3.48">discussion it is you are immediately</text>
  <text start="1057.27" dur="3.54">guilty in the court of public opinion</text>
  <text start="1058.89" dur="4.26">and then you have to work your way from</text>
  <text start="1060.81" dur="3.96">there backwards you can&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="1063.15" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s no presumption of innocence with</text>

  <text start="1066.57" dur="3.57">have it in our courts I would say at</text>
  <text start="1068.01" dur="3.54">this point but there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be</text>
  <text start="1070.14" dur="2.85">much of a presumption of innocence with</text>
  <text start="1071.55" dur="3.51">the media for the most part especially</text>
  <text start="1072.99" dur="4.17">when it comes to issues that just pop up</text>
