  <text start="9.769" dur="5.53">so what are we doing</text>
  <text start="11.55" dur="5.489">basically this sounds easy but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="15.299" dur="4.261">really hard to do we&amp;#39;re pushing down the</text>
  <text start="17.039" dur="4.32">take news we&amp;#39;re demoting it and we are</text>
  <text start="19.56" dur="4.62">increasing the authoritative news and</text>
  <text start="21.359" dur="3.991">promoting it how do we do that we can</text>
  <text start="24.18" dur="2.79">have a whole system we came up with</text>
  <text start="25.35" dur="4.11">trashy news where we have build</text>
  <text start="26.97" dur="4.649">classifiers we identify it we look for</text>
  <text start="29.46" dur="5.52">salacious for clickbait content that</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="5.401">isn&amp;#39;t that we don&amp;#39;t think is you know</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="3.63">the authoritative news it&amp;#39;s just kind of</text>
  <text start="37.02" dur="3.719">encouraging people to look at that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="4.74">not true and we&amp;#39;re training we added</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="5.701">these instructions to our readers and</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="5.369">with updated our classifiers and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="46.44" dur="3.75">working to understand identify that with</text>
  <text start="48.719" dur="3.901">machine learning and then to push that</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="5.49">down this episode of just inform talk I</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="5.579">sit down with the Google whistleblow mr.</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="5.609">Zack Voorhees and he&amp;#39;s gonna tell us all</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="6.6">about Google&amp;#39;s secret projects including</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="6.15">their a I projects known as deep mind</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="5.82">which Q has told us about that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="5.671">gonna dive even deeper into what it can</text>
  <text start="70.619" dur="5.371">be used for and how it will eventually</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="5.369">be weaponized by these big tech sensors</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="4.14">and used against you and me so you guys</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="6.481">don&amp;#39;t wanna stick around to check this</text>
  <text start="80.13" dur="7.32">out and welcome to just informed talk</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="4.86">today we have a very special guest you</text>
  <text start="87.45" dur="5.33">guys don&amp;#39;t need to hear me say his name</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="5.759">out loud because there are Google</text>
  <text start="92.78" dur="4.6">speech-to-text algorithms that could</text>
  <text start="95.579" dur="4.411">pick it up and might actually take this</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="5.97">video offline but he is known as the</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="7.29">Google whistleblower and he is here with</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="7.199">us today so so let&amp;#39;s get into your</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="5.46">knowledge of project deep mind what is</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="4.831">deep mind can we get into that because</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="3.9">this is relevant to my audience and I</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="3.33">think what who&amp;#39;s going to be watching</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="4.799">this video we want to know more about</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="5.28">where that came from his dragon fly fake</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="4.021">was that a head fake by Google to get</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="3.72">people looking in one direction when</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="4.829">yeah you know it was it was really</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="5.52">interesting because I so let&amp;#39;s rewind</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="4.681">back to 2018 I had to</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="5.52">delivered nine hundred fifty pages to</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="8.879">project Veritas explaining how the whole</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="6.9">system of censorship worked and you know</text>
  <text start="143.849" dur="4.681">then nothing can happen for a while but</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="7.32">then my handler came back and said yo</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="9.06">man what about project dragonfly and my</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="7.079">response to him was I have no idea what</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="5.52">project dragonfly is I&amp;#39;ve looked for it</text>
  <text start="160.049" dur="7.111">I can&amp;#39;t find any information on it it</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="6.269">doesn&amp;#39;t seem to really exist but I have</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="6.299">all this information on machine learning</text>
  <text start="169.379" dur="6.091">fairness like who made it like how long</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="3.78">it was incubating at Stanford for like</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="3.739">the contributors like this whole network</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="4.441">of people that was involved in this</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="7.261">machine learning fairness censorship</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="8.01">regime and I said but I can&amp;#39;t find thing</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="7.72">about project dragonfly</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="6.18">so yeah but then I seek that Q&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="5.24">posting about it and said that it was</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="6.69">given over to to China or something</text>
  <text start="199.43" dur="4.75">my personal opinion having worked within</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="5.04">the company and researching what its</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="6.59">activities were I believe that project</text>
  <text start="207.6" dur="3.17">dragonfly is fake and</text>
  <text start="212.17" dur="5.19">the reason and what another clue to this</text>
  <text start="214.36" dur="5.58">happened after I left the company and</text>
  <text start="217.36" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a big statement let me</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="6.21">just kind out there for a second and say</text>
  <text start="221.77" dur="6.39">so if project dragonfly is fake let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="3.87">on that premise and just kind of go down</text>
  <text start="228.16" dur="5.43">there this path with you for a second</text>
  <text start="230.02" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t negate the fact that Google was</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="4.83">working with the Chinese on a mass</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="3.84">censorship search algorithm that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="3.72">correct</text>
  <text start="239.02" dur="5.4">okay so so we&amp;#39;re what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="242.14" dur="4.56">about is not that the project itself was</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="4.38">drafted dragonfly was fake but Q may</text>
  <text start="246.7" dur="4.14">have obviously used that colloquial term</text>
  <text start="248.8" dur="4.11">to refer to it because it was the</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="6.36">popular term that the people were</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="6.78">grasping onto but is there any</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="4.77">connection to a project that was also</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="3.75">named deep dream and do you know</text>
  <text start="261.97" dur="3.54">anything about that I think that&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="3.45">centered out of Twitter so not a man</text>
  <text start="265.51" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s something that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.89" dur="6.41">researching that my team is researching</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="6.69">right now because deep dream</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="4.42">deep dream was a really interesting</text>
  <text start="275.2" dur="4.86">project that made these really trippy</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="4.53">LSD like videos that was you know that</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="5.12">you can find them on YouTube in fact if</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="5.97">you just type a deep dream Google and</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="5.02">what it does is it&amp;#39;s a machine learning</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="6.63">algorithm that is trained to find</text>
  <text start="290.2" dur="7.11">certain things and in images so it will</text>
  <text start="294.85" dur="5.069">tell you how much an image contains a</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="4.53">cat like a hundred percent it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="299.919" dur="3.541">totally a cat if it&amp;#39;s zero percent it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="5.19">definitely not like a cat that it</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="8.519">recognizes and so deep dream was able to</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="6.3">generate these and to generate these</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="3">images because what they would do is</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="3.39">that they would they would take the</text>
  <text start="314.979" dur="3.421">images input they would feed it into the</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="5.54">algorithm and then the algorithm would</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="3.86">kind of come up with and with a</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="3.85">representation in its mind about how the</text>
  <text start="325" dur="3.15">image looked and how it kind of looked</text>
  <text start="326.41" dur="4.23">like a cat well you could take that</text>
  <text start="328.15" dur="4.73">image kind of flatten it into pixels and</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="4.74">then add that back to the picture and</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="4.12">and if you keep on repeating this</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="5.159">process that what happens is that you</text>
  <text start="337" dur="7.95">get like you know dog faces out of you</text>
  <text start="340.539" dur="5.161">know what is essentially noise and as it</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="3.36">keeps</text>
  <text start="345.7" dur="5.19">through that the image of a dog face</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="5.31">gets like more stronger and stronger and</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="5.3">stronger and then people do things like</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="5.07">they can like zoom in on the video now</text>
  <text start="356.19" dur="5.92">to get even deeper what do you think</text>
  <text start="358.69" dur="4.62">about the AI Manhattan Project what do</text>
  <text start="362.11" dur="2.4">you think that they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="3.6">when they talk about this we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="364.51" dur="4.53">about the the ability that the abilities</text>
  <text start="366.91" dur="4.2">of deep dream and how can we use for</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="4.37">these deep fakes what do you think this</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="8.49">Manhattan Project is referring to</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="10.87">so this Manhattan Project known as deep</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="7.35">mind has produced the best go and chess</text>
  <text start="384.28" dur="4.95">players in the world and it has</text>
  <text start="386.95" dur="3.48">developed as one of its many</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="5.55">technologies something called</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="7.62">transferable AI so usually when you grow</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="5.82">an AI to solve a particular problem it</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="5.34">is only going to solve that problem so</text>
  <text start="400.6" dur="5.31">for example your AI that can play chess</text>
  <text start="403.39" dur="5.67">can&amp;#39;t play checkers</text>
  <text start="405.91" dur="6.33">it just doesn&amp;#39;t know how to do it will</text>
  <text start="409.06" dur="5.01">make the wrong moves and so one of the</text>
  <text start="412.24" dur="3.78">key technologies that they have is hey</text>
  <text start="414.07" dur="6.51">let&amp;#39;s build a neuro net and then retrain</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="8.1">it for a related problem you know and so</text>
  <text start="420.58" dur="5.91">that was one of their key technologies</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="5.91">that they have been able to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="6.39">experts in these neuro networks so so</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="4.95">here&amp;#39;s a great question then you know as</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="4.2">for what I do you know I&amp;#39;m on YouTube</text>
  <text start="434.98" dur="3.9">creating content and I&amp;#39;m very aware that</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="3.99">their algorithms I know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="3.84">speech-to-text I know they&amp;#39;re combing</text>
  <text start="441.07" dur="3.54">through all of that the content that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="3.48">created and they&amp;#39;re looking for keywords</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="4.38">they looking for</text>
  <text start="446.2" dur="4.62">all of these different markers is the</text>
  <text start="448.99" dur="3.75">machine because I used to get these</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="3.72">emails when I used to talk to group it</text>
  <text start="452.74" dur="3.15">say YouTube all the time I&amp;#39;d write to</text>
  <text start="454.54" dur="3.12">Google basically and we&amp;#39;d be having</text>
  <text start="455.89" dur="3.66">these conversations and this is</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="3.33">happening on YouTube they&amp;#39;re taking my</text>
  <text start="459.55" dur="2.58">videos they&amp;#39;re not suggesting them</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re doing this or doing that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="4.62">not fair and they would always say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.5" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s the machine learning you know you</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="4.83">we don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s the machine learning</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="4.56">yeah so they taught a lot of this off on</text>
  <text start="471.58" dur="3.75">the machine learning as if ya know</text>
  <text start="473.17" dur="4.2">control over the like creating it</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="4.149">they&amp;#39;re obviously creating it but to</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="5.769">what extent do you think that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.479" dur="5.37">- this kind of threshold where it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.139" dur="3.691">like you&amp;#39;re talking about with I think</text>
  <text start="484.849" dur="3.9">we talked about earlier with chess I</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="5.669">don&amp;#39;t know if it was here or not but and</text>
  <text start="488.749" dur="6.51">how the AI is it goes and it does all</text>
  <text start="492.499" dur="4.32">the the scenarios on its own and then it</text>
  <text start="495.259" dur="3.69">goes and plays the world&amp;#39;s top player</text>
  <text start="496.819" dur="4.62">and it beats them because it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="498.949" dur="5.761">gone and played a bajillion games of</text>
  <text start="501.439" dur="6.241">chess and it knows every scenario right</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="5.819">and so what point do they really</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="5.909">fine-tune enough and have they done that</text>
  <text start="510.529" dur="4.8">I think with YouTube yet I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="513.589" dur="3.33">they fine-tune it perfectly but I mean</text>
  <text start="515.329" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re definitely working on this as</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="6.99">far as you know giving it some sort of</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="6.69">scope to go out and actually be more</text>
  <text start="523.909" dur="5.43">autonomous and to just act as it will I</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="3.93">mean you saw the videos I mentioned the</text>
  <text start="529.339" dur="3.661">whistleblowers they were my video gets</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="4.019">taken down you told me I mentioned your</text>
  <text start="533" dur="4.26">name and who knows what it&amp;#39;ll happen I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="534.889" dur="5.31">sure my computer will blow up so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="5.4">just I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out how bad is</text>
  <text start="540.199" dur="3.87">it and and how where does it go from</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="7.31">here I mean it&amp;#39;s a form of liability</text>
  <text start="544.069" dur="5.901">laundering so you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="5.83">Google had blacklists and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="4.31">continue to have black lists but these</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="4.02">black lists are gonna be hidden in</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="5.35">convoluted machine learning networks</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="5.52">that no one can decipher how they</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="6.69">actually work it will be almost like a</text>
  <text start="566.66" dur="6.3">mystical you know you know Mechanical</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="4.68">Turk the Oracle of Google says you are</text>
  <text start="572.96" dur="5.61">not allowed exactly right like we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="4.77">know how the box works right and good</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="3.6">luck trying to convicting algorithm of</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="5.91">discrimination there has to be like a</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="6.45">person behind the thing doing it for you</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="3.84">to have an actual cause because you can</text>
  <text start="588.62" dur="3.3">bring that person into court you can be</text>
  <text start="590.06" dur="3.6">like are you racist and like hell yeah a</text>
  <text start="591.92" dur="4.41">racist and then it&amp;#39;s like why I rest my</text>
  <text start="593.66" dur="4.5">case but you can&amp;#39;t do that with like an</text>
  <text start="596.33" dur="4.98">algorithm it&amp;#39;s much harder you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="598.16" dur="5.46">cross examine an algorithm hell people</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t even know how it works if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="603.62" dur="4.56">machine learning neural network because</text>
  <text start="605.78" dur="4.65">like as a software engineer I can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="3.78">tell you how a neural network works well</text>
  <text start="610.43" dur="3.51">and if you think about it I mean most</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="3.24">neurologists have a very limited</text>
  <text start="613.94" dur="3.48">understanding of how the brain works</text>
