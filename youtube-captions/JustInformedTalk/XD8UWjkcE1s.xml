  <text start="132.92" dur="3.78">meeting with President Trump where he</text>
  <text start="135.35" dur="3.18">had said probably to them in the</text>
  <text start="136.7" dur="4.08">Situation Room that we are planning a</text>
  <text start="138.53" dur="5.79">strike on Iran and then president Trump</text>
  <text start="140.78" dur="7.38">calls it off because he is a rational</text>
  <text start="144.32" dur="5.669">man who sees the full context of the</text>
  <text start="148.16" dur="3.27">situation and there&amp;#39;s a lot more to it</text>

  <text start="165.35" dur="3.66">tech companies and how they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="167.06" dur="4.59">the the narrative to get out any other</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="4.5">way than their authoritarian a message</text>
  <text start="171.65" dur="4.86">that they want you to have you know be</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="5.28">force-fed that&amp;#39;s why when you search for</text>

  <text start="188.15" dur="6.42">written articles web page articles at</text>
  <text start="191.24" dur="5.58">all the top of that search bar will most</text>
  <text start="194.57" dur="6.12">likely show an article as some people</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="6.51">pointed out from CNN basically calling</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="4.23">President Trump a liar and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="203.33" dur="3.45">authoritative source you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="204.92" dur="4.71">believe the same authoritative source</text>

  <text start="209.63" dur="4.41">trying to paint President Trump as some</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="3.93">sort of Russian spy and Russian agent</text>
  <text start="214.04" dur="3.72">and then when that fell through now they</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="3.99">want to get them on these completely</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="4.35">bogus obstruction of justice charges</text>
  <text start="219.8" dur="4.2">these are the people who YouTube and</text>
  <text start="222.11" dur="4.28">Google and Twitter these are the people</text>
  <text start="224" dur="5.16">that they call authoritative sources</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re more like authoritarian sources</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="4.7">out of some dystopia and some George</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="5.61">Orwell 1984&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="251.45" dur="6.95">gonna start this was a report that came</text>
  <text start="254.21" dur="8.43">out recently about a billion-dollar</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="7.18">cocaine bust in Philadelphia zoos more</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="6.12">specifically in the port there and what</text>
  <text start="265.58" dur="5.25">they actually took was 1.1 excuse me I</text>
  <text start="268.76" dur="5.34">made misspoke earlier I think I said 1.5</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="5.82">but one point 1 billion dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="274.1" dur="5.01">cocaine at the Philadelphia Seaport</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="6.09">earlier this week the largest such</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="5.46">seizure in the history of US Customs and</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="4.47">Border Protection officials said Friday</text>
  <text start="284.57" dur="4.29">the quarter of the drug ceased were put</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="3.93">on grand display and then this is like</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="5.45">going into what they showed and how</text>
  <text start="291.14" dur="6.23">it&amp;#39;ll happen but so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="294.31" dur="6.12">is in context of some other things that</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="6.47">have happened here&amp;#39;s video of something</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="7.86">that happened at the port in</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="6.01">Philadelphia this is pretty insane but</text>
  <text start="308.29" dur="4.62">these people were driving and filmed</text>
  <text start="309.85" dur="5.97">this explosion an oil refinery in the</text>
  <text start="312.91" dur="5.67">port of Philadelphia right near the port</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="5.61">Seaport where that the major 1.5 billion</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="7.56">dollar bust was made so here you have a</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="7.47">video of this explosion happening I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="326.14" dur="4.08">trying to show it as we go here and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="3.18">just one of those things that you look</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="5.31">at and go this is crazy</text>
  <text start="332.08" dur="5.19">right well is it a coincidence I guess</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s really the question that I have</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="3.78">you know when I see these things I</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="4.77">automatically get skeptical that</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="3.84">happening in such close proximity so let</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="4.29">me ask you a few questions here before</text>
  <text start="344.89" dur="4.59">we dive any deeper in this do you guys</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="5.37">remember this story that came out a few</text>
  <text start="349.48" dur="3.81">days ago about a week ago and President</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="4.43">Trump</text>
  <text start="353.29" dur="7.14">starts accusing the New York Times of</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="5.32">basically working against our country</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="4.29">now this is what leads me to believe</text>
  <text start="362.65" dur="3.57">that the fake news media like the New</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="4.37">York Times in the Washington Post and</text>
  <text start="366.22" dur="4.95">CNN and others that they&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="4.06">reporting fake news because they hate</text>
  <text start="371.17" dur="3.51">the president I&amp;#39;m actually starting to</text>
  <text start="373.15" dur="3.63">see a pattern here where it looks like</text>
  <text start="374.68" dur="4.5">the New York Times in the Washington</text>
  <text start="376.78" dur="5.28">Post and CNN are being called out by</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="4.2">President Trump for committing acts of I</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t know what you would call it</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="4.05">sedition treason whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="3.48">call it against our country and what do</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="3.71">I mean by that well you have a major</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="4.35">publication like the New York Times</text>
  <text start="391.14" dur="3.91">releasing this report about the United</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="4.59">States ramping up cyber attacks on</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="5.25">Russia now what what does that what</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="5.37">response does this kind of story elicit</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="5.76">I mean because whatever you want to say</text>
  <text start="403.42" dur="4.35">about a journalistic integrity even if</text>
  <text start="406.06" dur="3.33">they throw all that out the window there</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="3.69">comes a point where if somebody comes to</text>
  <text start="409.39" dur="4.5">you with information for instance and</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="4.02">says they haven&amp;#39;t you know sensitive</text>
  <text start="413.89" dur="3.96">information about an ongoing operation</text>
  <text start="415.48" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going to share with you in the</text>
  <text start="417.85" dur="4.98">hopes that you&amp;#39;ll you know put that on</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="5.04">your your platform trust me I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="5.34">to people about maybe not stuff like</text>
  <text start="425.5" dur="4.56">this but I mean I&amp;#39;ve definitely had to</text>
  <text start="428.17" dur="4.38">decide not to report certain things</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="4.65">because let&amp;#39;s be quite honest I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="4.8">trying to sabotage the US government</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="5.01">right and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the thing that I</text>
  <text start="437.35" dur="4.86">think people look they glance right over</text>
  <text start="439.72" dur="4.47">when president Trump goes on and on and</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="4.17">on on his Twitter calling out the New</text>
  <text start="444.19" dur="5.4">York Times there is a reason for it</text>
  <text start="446.38" dur="5.49">and I I&amp;#39;m proposing here I&amp;#39;m theorizing</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="6.18">that that reason is because these people</text>
  <text start="451.87" dur="9.39">are not only disseminating information</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="6.75">that that is wildly inappropriate to be</text>
  <text start="461.26" dur="3.81">put out there to be quite honest</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="5.28">especially with with with regard to</text>
  <text start="465.07" dur="4.62">national security but that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="3.69">purposefully taking weaponized</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="4.5">intelligence from foreign adversaries</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="5.88">and printing it printing it on their</text>
  <text start="474.19" dur="6.41">national platforms in an effort to</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="5.97">undermine the United States at large and</text>
  <text start="480.6" dur="5.05">you brigher going well yeah we know that</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="5.01">come on this is obvious and then you</text>
  <text start="485.65" dur="5.27">know fine if you think it&amp;#39;s obvious you</text>
  <text start="488.35" dur="6.57">know good for you but the reality is</text>
  <text start="490.92" dur="6.34">that they&amp;#39;re trying to destroy our</text>
  <text start="494.92" dur="4.91">country if this is true hypothetically</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="6.12">if all of this really is true then these</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="5.89">individuals are not just writing stories</text>
  <text start="503.38" dur="5.79">because they think Trump&amp;#39;s you know a</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="5.31">bad person whose uses naughty words but</text>
  <text start="509.17" dur="5.46">then they go watch their you know TV</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="5.28">shows they&amp;#39;re their evil satanic TV</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="3.81">shows every night that curse and have</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="4.41">all types of debauchery and immorality</text>
  <text start="518.44" dur="4.68">and then they come and they act like the</text>
  <text start="520.72" dur="3.93">moral that they&amp;#39;re the most moral people</text>
  <text start="523.12" dur="3.15">in the world and that when President</text>
  <text start="524.65" dur="4.77">Trump says a swear word it&amp;#39;s the end of</text>
  <text start="526.27" dur="7.02">the the whole world but not only do they</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="7.7">have that but they&amp;#39;re actively engaging</text>
  <text start="533.29" dur="6.99">in practices which are having a</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="6.49">real-world detriment to our country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.28" dur="6.09">national security and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="543.61" dur="5.01">believe me well let&amp;#39;s look at these two</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="5.64">stories more closely first of all we</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="4.83">have this major cocaine bust at the port</text>
  <text start="552.01" dur="3.96">in Philadelphia and then right after</text>
  <text start="553.45" dur="5.64">that you have this massive explosion in</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="5.58">the oil refinery there now this comes on</text>
  <text start="559.09" dur="5.429">the heels of this New York Times</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="4.289">story about the cyberattacks ramping up</text>
  <text start="564.519" dur="2.791">on Russia now what happened shortly</text>
  <text start="565.839" dur="3.661">after this story was put out</text>
  <text start="567.31" dur="4.74">well you had one thing President Trump</text>
  <text start="569.5" dur="4.769">went off on the New York Times he says</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="4.17">here in his tweet the story in The New</text>
  <text start="574.269" dur="3.871">York Times with us escalating attacks on</text>
  <text start="576.22" dur="3.48">Russia&amp;#39;s power grid is fake news and the</text>
  <text start="578.14" dur="3.18">failing New York Times knows it they</text>
  <text start="579.7" dur="4.199">should immediately release their sources</text>
  <text start="581.32" dur="5.699">which if they exist at all which I doubt</text>
  <text start="583.899" dur="6.541">our phony Times must be held fully</text>
  <text start="587.019" dur="5.101">accountable hmm well now why is that</text>
  <text start="590.44" dur="4.079">important well it&amp;#39;s important because</text>
  <text start="592.12" dur="4.649">what President Trump is doing there is</text>
  <text start="594.519" dur="6.171">he&amp;#39;s calling out the New York Times for</text>
  <text start="596.769" dur="8.25">printing a story that has an incredible</text>
  <text start="600.69" dur="6.25">massive detriment and effect on our</text>
  <text start="605.019" dur="4.771">national security so these people are</text>
  <text start="606.94" dur="5.639">literally weaponizing their information</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="5.25">to destroy our country and you could go</text>

  <text start="615.04" dur="3.96">what then what skewing on if he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="617.23" dur="4.229">well you know what the difference is the</text>
  <text start="619" dur="4.14">difference is this cue and on and the</text>
  <text start="621.459" dur="4.051">movement that we&amp;#39;re working on here in</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="5.189">the investigatory Investigatory work</text>
  <text start="625.51" dur="4.68">that we we do has a lot more to do with</text>
  <text start="628.329" dur="4.621">exposing corruption within our own</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="4.769">government we&amp;#39;re not printing stories in</text>
  <text start="632.95" dur="4.8">order to start wars with other countries</text>
  <text start="634.959" dur="6.391">right or to have some retaliatory</text>
  <text start="637.75" dur="6.27">attacks happen on our country and if by</text>
  <text start="641.35" dur="5.45">chance there was some clandestine</text>
  <text start="644.02" dur="6.78">organization or some government backed</text>
  <text start="646.8" dur="6.55">organization who was moving 1.5 billion</text>
  <text start="650.8" dur="5.82">dollars worth of cocaine into our port</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="5.16">and then we seized it well 1.5 billion</text>
  <text start="656.62" dur="4.709">dollars that&amp;#39;s probably about how much</text>
  <text start="658.51" dur="4.35">an oil refinery costs right I mean I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="661.329" dur="3.721">just guessing here we&amp;#39;re gonna throw out</text>
  <text start="662.86" dur="4.32">some wild numbers maybe 500 million to a</text>
  <text start="665.05" dur="5.99">billion so that might be what you would</text>
  <text start="667.18" dur="3.86">call a retaliatory</text>
  <text start="672.209" dur="4.931">proportional response I guess you&amp;#39;d call</text>
  <text start="674.38" dur="4.17">it but this is what we&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="677.14" dur="4.139">here and I don&amp;#39;t think any of us really</text>
  <text start="678.55" dur="3.84">know what&amp;#39;s happening behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="681.279" dur="3.151">but let me tell you what we are</text>
  <text start="682.39" dur="6">definitely finding out more and more</text>
  <text start="684.43" dur="6.149">every single day about this and how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.39" dur="4.139">connected to what we&amp;#39;re going what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.579" dur="4.07">going through now obviously we can go</text>
  <text start="692.529" dur="3.381">back and read older q post</text>
  <text start="694.649" dur="3.031">few things that you want to point out</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="3.359">when you think about the drugs and what</text>
  <text start="697.68" dur="4.649">cues told us about the drugs and how</text>
  <text start="699.269" dur="5.221">they have affected our country it talks</text>
  <text start="702.329" dur="4.92">about Barack Obama talks about ms-13 it</text>
  <text start="704.49" dur="4.92">talks about why his his instructions for</text>
  <text start="707.249" dur="4.02">Homeland Security and Border Patrol were</text>
  <text start="709.41" dur="4.14">to release these people in our country</text>
  <text start="711.269" dur="4.44">and why they effectively helped shape</text>
  <text start="713.55" dur="4.17">the laws to make it so that people could</text>
  <text start="715.709" dur="6.211">not be deported especially those that</text>
  <text start="717.72" dur="7.7">come across illegally so you ask</text>
  <text start="721.92" dur="6.089">yourself why and Q explains it to us</text>
  <text start="725.42" dur="6.699">incredibly well saying that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="728.009" dur="6.841">connection between the agency and major</text>
  <text start="732.119" dur="5.19">drug cartels right who do you think that</text>
  <text start="734.85" dur="4.82">might have been right the clowns</text>
  <text start="737.309" dur="5.161">possibly working with the drug cartels</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="4.93">wonder you know don&amp;#39;t forget about fast</text>
  <text start="742.47" dur="5.369">fast and furious and what happened with</text>
  <text start="744.6" dur="4.589">Obama giving guns to the drug cartels</text>
  <text start="747.839" dur="4.141">and then they turn around and use them</text>
  <text start="749.189" dur="4.89">to kill Border Patrol that happened but</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="4.349">then the other thing is Q asks who do</text>
  <text start="754.079" dur="4.56">you hire for a hit and a hit would be an</text>
  <text start="756.329" dur="4.26">insinuation to some sort of antacid an</text>
  <text start="758.639" dur="8.12">assassination attempt and then if you</text>
  <text start="760.589" dur="9.331">think about it what is Q alleged that</text>
  <text start="766.759" dur="5.26">ms-13 is involved with these</text>
  <text start="769.92" dur="4.019">organizations these deep state actors</text>
  <text start="772.019" dur="3.831">it&amp;#39;s their throwaway actors that they</text>
  <text start="773.939" dur="4.59">use to get their dirty work done</text>
  <text start="775.85" dur="6.459">allegedly that these individuals are</text>
  <text start="778.529" dur="5.25">hired for these menial low-level tasks</text>
  <text start="782.309" dur="3.51">such as you know committing a murder</text>
  <text start="783.779" dur="4.65">which I know that sounds too crazy but</text>
  <text start="785.819" dur="4.02">it is it&amp;#39;s like the people who are the</text>
  <text start="788.429" dur="3.9">higher-ups don&amp;#39;t get their hands dirty</text>
  <text start="789.839" dur="3.93">if you know what I mean and then you</text>
  <text start="792.329" dur="3.86">have what happened to Seth rich now</text>
  <text start="793.769" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s just some very crazy</text>
  <text start="796.189" dur="3.671">circumstances surrounding his death and</text>
  <text start="798.629" dur="3.81">these are these are the facts that we</text>
  <text start="799.86" dur="5.699">know he was murdered on his way home one</text>
  <text start="802.439" dur="7.681">night the peared that it was a robbery</text>
  <text start="805.559" dur="6.24">but nothing was taken and there probably</text>
  <text start="810.12" dur="3.389">was a link to some sort of gang violence</text>
  <text start="811.799" dur="3.9">and they still haven&amp;#39;t found out who</text>
  <text start="813.509" dur="4.92">killed him</text>
  <text start="815.699" dur="5.37">but then shortly thereafter there was</text>
  <text start="818.429" dur="5.1">their work there was a murder of two</text>
  <text start="821.069" dur="4.68">ms-13 gang members and if you think</text>
  <text start="823.529" dur="4.621">about it how would you clean up after</text>
  <text start="825.749" dur="5.011">yourself if you hire two guys</text>
  <text start="828.15" dur="3.72">from a gang to go do a high-profile</text>
  <text start="830.76" dur="4.82">murder like with Seth Ridge</text>
  <text start="831.87" dur="6.3">hypothetically then how would you</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="4.15">basically get rid of the evidence then</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="3.48">you go take out the guys that did it and</text>
  <text start="839.73" dur="3.9">then there&amp;#39;s no link back to you and</text>
  <text start="841.65" dur="3.78">Seth rich besides those two guys who</text>
  <text start="843.63" dur="3.75">nobody&amp;#39;s investigating they&amp;#39;re barely</text>
  <text start="845.43" dur="2.849">investigating Seth Rich&amp;#39;s murder so I</text>
  <text start="847.38" dur="2.7">don&amp;#39;t know why they would be</text>
  <text start="848.279" dur="3.631">investigating you know if it was two</text>
  <text start="850.08" dur="4.71">ms-13 they probably just chalk it up to</text>
  <text start="851.91" dur="4.23">that it&amp;#39;s some inter gang violence right</text>
  <text start="854.79" dur="3">because that&amp;#39;s what I mean I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="856.14" dur="5.88">saying that this is what these gangs do</text>
  <text start="857.79" dur="7.23">right and then when it talks about Seth</text>
  <text start="862.02" dur="5.7">rich again the complete insinuation here</text>
  <text start="865.02" dur="4.62">is that there was a hit put out on Seth</text>
  <text start="867.72" dur="3.27">rich that&amp;#39;s the the theory but nobody</text>
  <text start="869.64" dur="3.24">has been able to prove that yet because</text>
  <text start="870.99" dur="3.84">the police haven&amp;#39;t really been following</text>
  <text start="872.88" dur="4.38">up on that investigation that well and</text>
  <text start="874.83" dur="5.55">quite to be quite honest everybody</text>
  <text start="877.26" dur="4.14">involved with the clintons and what was</text>
  <text start="880.38" dur="2.91">happening in the run-up to the election</text>
  <text start="881.4" dur="4.08">these people just disappear there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="883.29" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;s a list of people whose lives</text>
  <text start="885.48" dur="5.43">have been lost going after the the</text>
  <text start="888.33" dur="6.09">Clintons and the Democrats and this is</text>
  <text start="890.91" dur="5.34">what Q has told us from day one okay</text>
  <text start="894.42" dur="3.57">this is we&amp;#39;re talking November of 2017</text>
  <text start="896.25" dur="4.92">this is one of the first Q post he</text>
  <text start="897.99" dur="4.289">started posting October 2017 so this was</text>
  <text start="901.17" dur="4.53">one of the first things that we were</text>
  <text start="902.279" dur="5.701">told and it still is relevant today of</text>
  <text start="905.7" dur="4.04">course you know then you kind of tie</text>
  <text start="907.98" dur="5.58">that into what happened with Iran now</text>
  <text start="909.74" dur="6.31">here&amp;#39;s an interesting idea it says what</text>
  <text start="913.56" dur="4.469">are why is Iran protected why is it ran</text>
  <text start="916.05" dur="2.88">funded by the US what news about Iran</text>
  <text start="918.029" dur="2.821">broke drugs</text>
  <text start="918.93" dur="4.08">what about WMDs so could it be the</text>
  <text start="920.85" dur="5.04">Russians that are pushing the Iranians</text>
  <text start="923.01" dur="6.66">who are into some sort of subterfuge in</text>
  <text start="925.89" dur="6.24">our country and that&amp;#39;s why listen when Q</text>
  <text start="929.67" dur="6.539">says drugs what do you think one of the</text>
  <text start="932.13" dur="6.72">main imports might be for you know the</text>
  <text start="936.209" dur="6.301">type of government like Iran where they</text>
  <text start="938.85" dur="5.97">are trying to you know illicitly make</text>
  <text start="942.51" dur="4.05">money in lieu of the sanctions that have</text>
  <text start="944.82" dur="3.269">been put on their country do you think</text>
  <text start="946.56" dur="4.529">they might be trafficking some drugs</text>
  <text start="948.089" dur="6.601">possibly and you think that if we made a</text>
  <text start="951.089" dur="6.541">seizure of those drugs that cost them</text>
  <text start="954.69" dur="5.04">1.5 billion dollars that their response</text>
  <text start="957.63" dur="4.3">might be to do some sort of subterfuge</text>
  <text start="959.73" dur="5.32">inside of our country to maybe</text>
  <text start="961.93" dur="5.7">disable one of our major oil refineries</text>
  <text start="965.05" dur="6.24">in the Philadelphia port to give us like</text>
  <text start="967.63" dur="5.48">a an answer to what we did it&amp;#39;s like if</text>
  <text start="971.29" dur="3.51">we you take what&amp;#39;s ours then we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="973.11" dur="4.45">destroy what&amp;#39;s yours</text>
  <text start="974.8" dur="5.46">I&amp;#39;m hypothetically speaking about a</text>
  <text start="977.56" dur="5.79">theory here but you know look and then</text>
  <text start="980.26" dur="5.91">Russia&amp;#39;s back in Iran we know that so</text>
  <text start="983.35" dur="4.59">Russia&amp;#39;s got the same problem Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="986.17" dur="3.539">got the same problem in what we saw in</text>
  <text start="987.94" dur="4.68">South America I think might have been a</text>
  <text start="989.709" dur="5.371">message from Russia in response to this</text>
  <text start="992.62" dur="4.2">article from the New York Times and of</text>
  <text start="995.08" dur="4.199">course you know you guys go why do i ucn</text>
  <text start="996.82" dur="4.889">n ucn n so they can&amp;#39;t be like oh he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="999.279" dur="4.68">just using non authoritative sources</text>
  <text start="1001.709" dur="4.38">right so it&amp;#39;s like alright fine I&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="1003.959" dur="4.171">your own sources and I&amp;#39;ll debunk every</text>
  <text start="1006.089" dur="5.641">single piece of it and I&amp;#39;ll show you why</text>
  <text start="1008.13" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s garbage right so this all is</text>
  <text start="1011.73" dur="5.04">connected I think and if you think to</text>
  <text start="1013.5" dur="4.11">back to it Iran&amp;#39;s got no money so what</text>
  <text start="1016.77" dur="3.06">are they doing they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="1017.61" dur="4.14">smuggling drugs and trying to get oil</text>

  <text start="1032.73" dur="6.78">Iran but let&amp;#39;s say that we hit them at</text>
  <text start="1036.329" dur="5.25">one point like I keep saying 1.5 1.1</text>

  <text start="1222.1" dur="4.11">stupid fluff piece story that has</text>
  <text start="1224.71" dur="3.48">nothing to do with the real reason why</text>
  <text start="1226.21" dur="2.49">they were dancing they&amp;#39;re gonna say that</text>
  <text start="1228.19" dur="2.4">Oh</text>
  <text start="1228.7" dur="3.84">probably dancing because he&amp;#39;s so happy</text>
  <text start="1230.59" dur="4.83">that they told President Trump he was a</text>
  <text start="1232.54" dur="5.31">mean guy and and he was bad for being</text>
  <text start="1235.42" dur="4.82">mean to all those Iranian you know like</text>
  <text start="1237.85" dur="6.15">yeah I highly doubt that&amp;#39;s what happened</text>

  <text start="1244" dur="5.55">trying to avoid war and hold the corrupt</text>
  <text start="1247.09" dur="5.28">criminals in our country and abroad</text>
  <text start="1249.55" dur="5.34">accountable for their crimes against the</text>
  <text start="1252.37" dur="5.55">world and others so or the world I guess</text>
  <text start="1254.89" dur="4.92">at large so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what it is</text>
  <text start="1257.92" dur="3.12">because right after that of course you</text>
  <text start="1259.81" dur="3.12">have President Trump</text>
  <text start="1261.04" dur="4.44">approving the strike on Iran but then</text>
  <text start="1262.93" dur="5.13">abruptly pulls back at last second</text>
  <text start="1265.48" dur="5.04">thanks Maggie Haberman see I got all</text>
  <text start="1268.06" dur="5.97">your trusted news sources so you guys</text>
  <text start="1270.52" dur="6.24">can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m just cherry-picking here</text>
  <text start="1274.03" dur="6.48">I mean look so president Trump goes in</text>
  <text start="1276.76" dur="5.19">and says look you know as he says it in</text>
  <text start="1280.51" dur="3.84">his tweet better than I could probably</text>
  <text start="1281.95" dur="4.65">explain it to you we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="1284.35" dur="5.31">as Twitter to in a second but here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1286.6" dur="4.77">what he says and I&amp;#39;ll read the whole</text>
  <text start="1289.66" dur="3.33">thing so things very fascinating real</text>
  <text start="1291.37" dur="3.27">quick President Obama made a desperate</text>
  <text start="1292.99" dur="3.9">and terrible deal with Iran gave them</text>
  <text start="1294.64" dur="4.41">150 billion dollars plus 1.8 billion</text>
  <text start="1296.89" dur="4.08">dollars in cash Iran was in big trouble</text>
  <text start="1299.05" dur="4.11">and he bailed them out gave him a free</text>
  <text start="1300.97" dur="4.41">pass into nuclear weapons and soon</text>
  <text start="1303.16" dur="4.62">instead of saying thank you Iran yelled</text>
  <text start="1305.38" dur="4.74">death to America I terminated the deal</text>
  <text start="1307.78" dur="4.44">which was not even ratified by Congress</text>
  <text start="1310.12" dur="5.25">and imposed strong sanctions they are a</text>
  <text start="1312.22" dur="4.98">much weakened nation today than at the</text>
  <text start="1315.37" dur="3.78">beginning of my presidency when they</text>
  <text start="1317.2" dur="6.09">were causing major problems throughout</text>
  <text start="1319.15" dur="6.32">the Middle East now they are a bust it</text>
  <text start="1323.29" dur="4.98">says on Monday they shot down an</text>
  <text start="1325.47" dur="4.72">unmanned drone flying in international</text>
  <text start="1328.27" dur="4.17">waters we were cocked and loaded to</text>
  <text start="1330.19" dur="5.22">retaliate last night on three different</text>
  <text start="1332.44" dur="5.34">sites when I asked how many will die 150</text>
  <text start="1335.41" dur="4.14">people sir was the answer from a general</text>
  <text start="1337.78" dur="5.28">10 minutes before the strike I stopped</text>
  <text start="1339.55" dur="5.64">it not not proportionate to shooting</text>
  <text start="1343.06" dur="4.95">down an unmanned drone I&amp;#39;m in no hurry</text>
  <text start="1345.19" dur="5.13">our military is real bit rebuilt new and</text>
  <text start="1348.01" dur="4.41">ready to go by far the best in the world</text>
  <text start="1350.32" dur="4.05">sanctions are biting and more added last</text>
  <text start="1352.42" dur="3.9">night Iran can never have nuclear</text>
  <text start="1354.37" dur="2.49">weapons not against the USA not against</text>
  <text start="1356.32" dur="3.06">the world</text>
  <text start="1356.86" dur="4.67">so we&amp;#39;re sanctioning them into oblivion</text>
  <text start="1359.38" dur="4.52">and President Trump had the</text>
  <text start="1361.53" dur="3.9">or the foresight and the wisdom to see</text>
  <text start="1363.9" dur="4.29">that it&amp;#39;s not a proportionate response</text>
  <text start="1365.43" dur="4.61">to kill 150 people for maybe you know</text>
  <text start="1368.19" dur="5.46">for any dollar amount worth of</text>
  <text start="1370.04" dur="5.29">technology that&amp;#39;s lost I mean and that</text>
  <text start="1373.65" dur="5.61">to me is something that we can take and</text>
  <text start="1375.33" dur="5.88">really take that as a a good sign a</text>
  <text start="1379.26" dur="3.66">positive sign that you know that the</text>
  <text start="1381.21" dur="7.05">strategy the thinking in the white house</text>
  <text start="1382.92" dur="8.82">is not just this complete annihilation</text>
  <text start="1388.26" dur="5.43">of our enemies at any cost including it</text>
  <text start="1391.74" dur="3.99">the cost of our own country there is</text>
  <text start="1393.69" dur="3.45">some calculated thought behind this and</text>
  <text start="1395.73" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s what I think that we&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="1397.14" dur="4.17">against and the whole thing with Iran</text>
  <text start="1399.09" dur="3.48">has been a setup from day one so the</text>
  <text start="1401.31" dur="3.87">fact of the matter is is that we&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="1402.57" dur="4.77">against something that&amp;#39;s way bigger than</text>
  <text start="1405.18" dur="5.34">any of us could ever imagine</text>
  <text start="1407.34" dur="6.09">and that&amp;#39;s kind of where I&amp;#39;m gonna leave</text>
  <text start="1410.52" dur="5.97">it one more thing before we go I want to</text>
  <text start="1413.43" dur="4.83">talk about here the 2019 trafficking in</text>
  <text start="1416.49" dur="3.21">persons report was just released this is</text>
  <text start="1418.26" dur="4.02">a must-read if you guys want to learn</text>
  <text start="1419.7" dur="4.2">more but this was put out by this I</text>
  <text start="1422.28" dur="3.45">believe it was the Department of State</text>
  <text start="1423.9" dur="3.72">and it talks about trafficking human</text>
  <text start="1425.73" dur="3.15">trafficking and you guys should read</text>
  <text start="1427.62" dur="3.72">this report I&amp;#39;ve been reading through it</text>
  <text start="1428.88" dur="4.8">a little bit there&amp;#39;s a lot to read here</text>
  <text start="1431.34" dur="4.17">so 500 pages obviously but this is a</text>
  <text start="1433.68" dur="2.82">global report on human trafficking and</text>
  <text start="1435.51" dur="2.4">there&amp;#39;s some very fascinating</text>
  <text start="1436.5" dur="4.14">information especially if you just read</text>
  <text start="1437.91" dur="4.2">in the first few pages here where it</text>
  <text start="1440.64" dur="6.09">talks about the United States it gives</text>
  <text start="1442.11" dur="6.27">examples of how human trafficking varies</text>
  <text start="1446.73" dur="3.15">from country to country and even the</text>
  <text start="1448.38" dur="3.21">United States is named here and what I</text>
  <text start="1449.88" dur="3.54">thought was fascinating and this ties</text>
  <text start="1451.59" dur="3.87">back to a lot of missing children cases</text>
  <text start="1453.42" dur="4.2">in this country a lot of broken hearts</text>
  <text start="1455.46" dur="3.69">and broken families that are suffering</text>
  <text start="1457.62" dur="3.21">because of this but it says in the</text>
  <text start="1459.15" dur="4.5">United States traffickers prey upon</text>
  <text start="1460.83" dur="5.25">children in the foster care system this</text>
  <text start="1463.65" dur="3.99">is an official report mind you from the</text>
  <text start="1466.08" dur="3.45">Department of State saying recent</text>
  <text start="1467.64" dur="3.87">reports have consistently indicated a</text>
  <text start="1469.53" dur="3.33">large number of victims of child sex</text>
  <text start="1471.51" dur="4.2">trafficking where at one time in foster</text>
  <text start="1472.86" dur="5.46">care system so I&amp;#39;m very proud and happy</text>
  <text start="1475.71" dur="4.35">to say that we are in this country</text>
  <text start="1478.32" dur="3.69">addressing our own problems and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1480.06" dur="5.25">not afraid to address the fact that</text>
  <text start="1482.01" dur="6.99">foster care does breed a large amount of</text>
  <text start="1485.31" dur="5.31">human trafficking and child abuse and we</text>
  <text start="1489" dur="3.69">have to be aware of that as a culture</text>
  <text start="1490.62" dur="4.38">and we have to fight it at every point</text>
  <text start="1492.69" dur="2.79">that we can so I just thought I&amp;#39;d point</text>

  <text start="1608.63" dur="4.39">and then we&amp;#39;ll talk about it says</text>
  <text start="1610.68" dur="4.74">brothers and this is talking about</text>
  <text start="1613.02" dur="4.62">righteousness by faith alone and I think</text>
  <text start="1615.42" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s just a beautiful passage that that</text>
  <text start="1617.64" dur="3.48">can give us all insight on how we should</text>

  <text start="1623.4" dur="5.01">prayer to God concerning them is for</text>
  <text start="1625.71" dur="5.16">their salvation I can testify about them</text>
  <text start="1628.41" dur="4.77">that they have zeal for God but not</text>
  <text start="1630.87" dur="4.65">according to knowledge because they have</text>

  <text start="1656.13" dur="7.62">comes from faith speaks like this says</text>
  <text start="1660.51" dur="5.88">do not say in your heart who will go up</text>

  <text start="1675.39" dur="4.95">near you in your mouth and in your heart</text>
  <text start="1677.96" dur="4.48">this is the message of faith that we</text>
