  <text start="205.62" dur="4.57">monopoly that he controls that the size</text>
  <text start="208.66" dur="3.75">of the monopoly he controls over just</text>

  <text start="232.27" dur="3.06">people who report the truth but Q</text>
  <text start="233.86" dur="3.81">explains it all right here so let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.86">look at this so first it&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="237.67" dur="4.47">the network right and for those of you</text>
  <text start="240.19" dur="3.299">who haven&amp;#39;t seen the Q did post this</text>
  <text start="242.14" dur="3.96">before and it&amp;#39;s basically like a</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="4.5">flowchart of how the MSM get their</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="4.109">information from the government how</text>
  <text start="247.989" dur="3.901">basically project mockingbird works you</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="3.631">have these reporters and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.89" dur="5.219">all basically connected to special</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="7.19">agents and attorneys and specialists and</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="7.021">deputy directors and and executives and</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re all getting fed information</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="5.19">right so</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="4.89">that in and of itself is not you know a</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="3.87">bad thing I mean they have to contact</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="3.33">these people to get information but the</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="3.54">reporters are basically just reporting</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="4.26">propaganda they&amp;#39;re just reporting lies</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re reporting whatever that their</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="4.59">corporate overlords tell them to in</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="6.42">conjunction with their unelected deep</text>
  <text start="283.54" dur="6.09">state globalist running officials like</text>
  <text start="287.23" dur="4.47">John Brennan James clapper and others</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="4.59">those people were basically I mean</text>
  <text start="291.7" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re trying to influence us every day</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="3.39">but then they&amp;#39;re influenced by the</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="5.19">corporations that paid them through</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="4.86">their lobbying and it&amp;#39;s just a sick sick</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="3.87">circle that they live in up there and</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="4.74">then q points us to this which is</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="4.92">another flowchart and this is an</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="3.93">interesting one if you want to look at</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="3.47">it a little bit closer we&amp;#39;ll blow it up</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="5.43">here but it&amp;#39;s talking about how the</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="5.77">actual chain of command works here at</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="3.57">the FBI talking about how it goes from</text>

  <text start="343.9" dur="5.07">saying look these guys are really really</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="4.02">not doing a good job and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="3.72">talk about that here in a second but</text>

  <text start="690.76" dur="8.19">this was around 1,000 okay and in since</text>
  <text start="696.18" dur="5.2">basically in the last year we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="698.95" dur="3.87">from I think it was about fourth there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.38" dur="7.7">three or four thousand or something like</text>
  <text start="702.82" dur="9.06">that in the 2017 then jumping up to</text>
  <text start="709.08" dur="6.43">45,000 in all the in every federal</text>

  <text start="715.51" dur="3.48">indictments that are waiting to be</text>
  <text start="717.13" dur="4.92">unsealed and what are sealed indictments</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="5.58">do well they allow prosecutors and they</text>
  <text start="722.05" dur="4.86">allow investigators to bring charges and</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="3.63">then seal them so that they do not have</text>
  <text start="726.91" dur="3.679">to tell the people who are being</text>
  <text start="728.2" dur="5.28">investigated if it may affect an ongoing</text>
  <text start="730.589" dur="5.981">investigation so imagine people like</text>
  <text start="733.48" dur="4.71">Hillary may have possibly sealed</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="6.87">indictments that are waiting to be</text>
  <text start="738.19" dur="8.91">unsealed to prove possibly that she is a</text>
  <text start="743.44" dur="4.98">criminal so and then media you know what</text>
  <text start="747.1" dur="2.67">they&amp;#39;re never gonna report it they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="803.91" dur="8.16">it&amp;#39;s post from yesterday so it should</text>
  <text start="807.75" dur="5.94">not be hard to find whatsoever but yeah</text>
  <text start="812.07" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s what Q is pointing to and and</text>
  <text start="813.69" dur="4.2">these Ceylon diamonds could be for some</text>
  <text start="815.97" dur="4.17">of these people in the media which then</text>
  <text start="817.89" dur="3.27">then you have the complete conflict of</text>
  <text start="820.14" dur="2.9">interest because they&amp;#39;re sitting there</text>
  <text start="821.16" dur="4.619">trying to tell you that they&amp;#39;re the true</text>
  <text start="823.04" dur="3.91">spokesman&amp;#39;s of truth while at the same</text>
  <text start="825.779" dur="2.971">time they have sealed indictments</text>
  <text start="826.95" dur="4.68">waiting to come out to expose them for</text>
  <text start="828.75" dur="4.38">basically they could be they could get</text>
  <text start="831.63" dur="4.5">in trouble for a myriad of different</text>
  <text start="833.13" dur="4.59">things but I&amp;#39;ll just say this there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="836.13" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s no verifiable evidence in that</text>
  <text start="837.72" dur="5.1">regard yet but it&amp;#39;s definitely a</text>
  <text start="839.64" dur="4.83">speculation that can be looked at now</text>
  <text start="842.82" dur="4.11">the next one is interesting really</text>
  <text start="844.47" dur="5.58">interesting so in an on post this Eric</text>
  <text start="846.93" dur="4.59">trump post from today where Trump says</text>
  <text start="850.05" dur="3.36">the level of hatred and the willingness</text>
  <text start="851.52" dur="3.42">to disparage my family and our great</text>
  <text start="853.41" dur="3.81">company has never been so ugly and</text>
  <text start="854.94" dur="4.98">unrelenting as I have seen recently by</text>
  <text start="857.22" dur="4.76">the Washington Post it is clearly coming</text>
  <text start="859.92" dur="6.03">from the top with one motivation in mind</text>
  <text start="861.98" dur="7.12">at Jeff Bezos then an Anton here</text>
  <text start="865.95" dur="6.09">basically puts the same tweet up and</text>
  <text start="869.1" dur="4.32">then writes the tweet out and cue points</text>
  <text start="872.04" dur="5.28">to both of them and says do you believe</text>
  <text start="873.42" dur="6.75">in coincidences q so I already know</text>
  <text start="877.32" dur="5.37">pretty much without a doubt in my mind</text>
  <text start="880.17" dur="4.169">at least I don&amp;#39;t have any facts to back</text>
  <text start="882.69" dur="3.48">it up but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure Eric Trump is</text>
  <text start="884.339" dur="3.361">watching the Q boards he&amp;#39;s following q</text>
  <text start="886.17" dur="4.47">and on and he understands probably</text>
  <text start="887.7" dur="6.29">exactly what q non is that being the</text>
  <text start="890.64" dur="6.78">case then obviously we can infer that</text>
  <text start="893.99" dur="6.55">everything about Q is closer getting</text>
  <text start="897.42" dur="6.45">closer and closer to leading us to see</text>
  <text start="900.54" dur="5.73">that it&amp;#39;s really an actual movement here</text>
  <text start="903.87" dur="3.69">but that&amp;#39;s where that&amp;#39;s something with</text>
  <text start="906.27" dur="3.48">people near the President or the</text>
  <text start="907.56" dur="4.5">president himself and that is just</text>
  <text start="909.75" dur="5.22">another confirmation in my mind because</text>
  <text start="912.06" dur="4.44">this post came out just after Q posted</text>
  <text start="914.97" dur="4.38">here about the Washington Post articles</text>
  <text start="916.5" dur="5.61">so you know it&amp;#39;s kind of like a signal a</text>
  <text start="919.35" dur="4.62">nod and a wink if you will and then the</text>
  <text start="922.11" dur="5.52">next one I thought was great q responds</text>
  <text start="923.97" dur="6.21">to his own post here and it&amp;#39;s this q q</text>
  <text start="927.63" dur="3.24">map pub and it&amp;#39;s basically going over</text>
  <text start="930.18" dur="2.7">and this</text>
  <text start="930.87" dur="3.36">you know one of the q9 pub keymap pub</text>
  <text start="932.88" dur="4.11">wherever you want to go to get your info</text>
  <text start="934.23" dur="6.81">this has got all the drops and it points</text>
  <text start="936.99" dur="6.12">to that one saying oh so yes the</text>
  <text start="941.04" dur="3.72">Washington Post and then that yeah okay</text>
  <text start="943.11" dur="4.83">well we see the times we understand</text>
  <text start="944.76" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s very very clever and I am just</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="5.04">another interesting thing now we&amp;#39;ll read</text>
  <text start="950.52" dur="5.61">these and Anton posted Jim Jordans</text>
  <text start="952.98" dur="5.22">Twitter account as of today where he</text>

  <text start="1805.36" dur="7.01">president Trump signed into law an</text>
  <text start="1807.91" dur="6.75">executive order that basically</text>
  <text start="1812.37" dur="6.85">reorganized the articles for a court</text>
  <text start="1814.66" dur="7.29">martial which seemed to now include that</text>
  <text start="1819.22" dur="4.8">public officials who are found to have</text>
  <text start="1821.95" dur="3.75">committed crimes against the country</text>

  <text start="1825.7" dur="4.38">office can still be held accountable and</text>
  <text start="1827.92" dur="5.31">put to a court-martial so if you guys</text>
  <text start="1830.08" dur="5.85">want to go check that out it&amp;#39;s executive</text>
  <text start="1833.23" dur="5.79">order here it is it&amp;#39;s the executive</text>

  <text start="1842.77" dur="4.89">exactly how that&amp;#39;s going to work but</text>
  <text start="1844.78" dur="4.8">just rest assured that January 2019 is</text>
  <text start="1847.66" dur="2.69">going to be a very interesting time and</text>
  <text start="1849.58" dur="3.14">they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1850.35" dur="5.55">thing they can tell then to obstruct and</text>
  <text start="1852.72" dur="6.48">try to delay and try to basically create</text>
  <text start="1855.9" dur="5.909">havoc and anarchy and chaos and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1859.2" dur="4.62">what we have to really stay driven and</text>
  <text start="1861.809" dur="3.571">focused and motivated to exposing the</text>
  <text start="1863.82" dur="3.66">truth and holding these people</text>

  <text start="1869.549" dur="4.201">crimes they need to be held accountable</text>
  <text start="1871.08" dur="6.45">and that&amp;#39;s what it is so trusting and</text>
  <text start="1873.75" dur="5.039">that goes directly into this piece of</text>
  <text start="1877.53" dur="3.99">Scripture I want to share with you today</text>
  <text start="1878.789" dur="4.441">and and it&amp;#39;s not just that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1881.52" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s people being arrested every day</text>

  <text start="1887.22" dur="3.66">overcome the evil that is all around us</text>
  <text start="1888.87" dur="3.12">but here&amp;#39;s a great just little piece of</text>
  <text start="1890.88" dur="4.62">Scripture I want to share with you from</text>
  <text start="1891.99" dur="6.689">James the book of James chapter 5 verses</text>
  <text start="1895.5" dur="5.64">7 &amp;amp; 4 it talks about patience and it</text>
  <text start="1898.679" dur="3.75">talks about truthful speech and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1901.14" dur="3.6">share both those things it says</text>
  <text start="1902.429" dur="4.5">therefore brothers be patient until the</text>
  <text start="1904.74" dur="4.2">Lord&amp;#39;s coming see how the farmer waits</text>

  <text start="1914.13" dur="3.179">be patient strengthen your hearts</text>
  <text start="1915.75" dur="3.9">because the Lord&amp;#39;s coming is near</text>
  <text start="1917.309" dur="4.471">brothers do not complain about one</text>
  <text start="1919.65" dur="4.519">another so that you will not be judged</text>
  <text start="1921.78" dur="5.009">look the judge stands at the door</text>
  <text start="1924.169" dur="4.151">brothers take the prophets who spoke in</text>
  <text start="1926.789" dur="4.681">the Lord&amp;#39;s name as an example of</text>
  <text start="1928.32" dur="5.79">suffering and patience see we count as</text>
  <text start="1931.47" dur="4.589">blessed those who have endured you have</text>
  <text start="1934.11" dur="3.99">heard of job&amp;#39;s endurance and have seen</text>
  <text start="1936.059" dur="4.561">the outcome from the Lord the Lord is</text>
  <text start="1938.1" dur="4.439">very compassionate and merciful now</text>

  <text start="1944.97" dur="5.85">other oath yes or your yes must be yes</text>
  <text start="1948.33" dur="7.829">and your no must be no so that you won&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1956.159" dur="3.991">the truth that&amp;#39;s what God is telling us</text>
  <text start="1958.289" dur="5.161">right there and I think those two</text>
  <text start="1960.15" dur="6.84">messages are so important today we tend</text>
  <text start="1963.45" dur="5.76">to overlook the fact that we have to</text>
  <text start="1966.99" dur="5.88">bring God into the equation we have to</text>
  <text start="1969.21" dur="6.81">bring his message into our daily</text>
  <text start="1972.87" dur="4.62">equation for living because a message</text>
  <text start="1976.02" dur="3.48">like that is something we need to hear</text>
  <text start="1977.49" dur="4.2">in our hearts that we need to exercise</text>
  <text start="1979.5" dur="4.559">patience we need to look to the prophets</text>
  <text start="1981.69" dur="5.75">who exercised the most</text>
  <text start="1984.059" dur="5.7">patience under duress and suffering when</text>
  <text start="1987.44" dur="4.329">everything seemed to be going wrong it</text>
  <text start="1989.759" dur="4.02">was all a part of God&amp;#39;s plan because</text>
  <text start="1991.769" dur="4.441">God&amp;#39;s plan is way beyond anything that</text>
  <text start="1993.779" dur="4.44">we can ever know but we have to trust it</text>
  <text start="1996.21" dur="4.199">and then we have to trust in the Lord</text>
  <text start="1998.219" dur="4.471">and speak the truth as we know it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2000.409" dur="5.13">the only two things that we can really</text>
