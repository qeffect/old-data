  <text start="72.33" dur="7.16">here and what he says is very important</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="8.45">and it all ties back to Tommy Robinson</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="7.69">Martin Sellner and Brittney Pettibone</text>
  <text start="83.81" dur="5.89">and what they&amp;#39;re doing right now in the</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="4.829">UK is literally the definition of</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="5.099">Orwellian to me</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="6.18">they are literally throwing people out</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.371">of the country for what they perceive as</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="3.511">thoughtcrime</text>
  <text start="99.17" dur="6.879">the wrong thing whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="7.919">call it it is the ideal Orwellian</text>
  <text start="106.049" dur="8.881">outcome if you ask me and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="7.231">this deserves very much a lot of</text>
  <text start="114.93" dur="5.16">coverage very much needs to be</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="4.949">highlighted ultimately I&amp;#39;m not doing</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="4.41">this for myself and doing it because</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="5.311">it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="4.56">gonna do here is when I get into what</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s talking about here now what</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="4.56">happened was Martin Sellner and Britney</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="5.09">Pettibone tried to come into the country</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="7.97">Martin Selmer was going to give a speech</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="5.64">at one of the free speech corners in</text>
  <text start="142.159" dur="5.321">downtown London and also you have</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="2.7">Britney Pettibone who was coming in to</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="3.569">interview</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="4.55">Tommy Robinson who for those of you who</text>
  <text start="151.049" dur="4.711">don&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;s a very well-known</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="5.05">basically just civil convert with</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="4.47">conservative in Britain who has been</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="4.2">pointing out the terrible atrocities</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="4.64">that have been happening since the open</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="5.3">borders policy has been implemented now</text>
  <text start="164.87" dur="7.6">going into who Britney Pettibone is</text>
  <text start="167.39" dur="6.55">she&amp;#39;s basically she has her website here</text>
  <text start="172.47" dur="4.099">she gives a little bio she became she</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="7.379">was a sci-fi writer who became</text>
  <text start="176.569" dur="7.09">politically active around 2016 I think</text>
  <text start="181.319" dur="7.29">that she&amp;#39;s married to this Martin</text>
  <text start="183.659" dur="7.231">Sellner and he&amp;#39;s an Austrian activist he</text>
  <text start="188.609" dur="5.22">is the leader of the new right as an</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="5.849">identity Rhian movement of Austria a lot</text>
  <text start="193.829" dur="5.91">of people have categorized them as hate</text>
  <text start="196.739" dur="6.36">speech monitors and right-wingers and</text>
  <text start="199.739" dur="4.771">just these awful things but sometimes if</text>
  <text start="203.099" dur="2.76">you just really sit down and listen to</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="3.36">what somebody has to say maybe you can</text>
  <text start="205.859" dur="4.891">find similarities and then have</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="5.64">something to discuss but I think</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="5.459">ultimately this is really the attack on</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="4.86">free speech now here&amp;#39;s a picture of a</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="4.021">letter that is really I&amp;#39;m gonna blow</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="4.769">this up for you guys a little bit but it</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="5.939">is Britney coming into the country and</text>
  <text start="223.139" dur="6.66">they said that she had done this let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.169" dur="5.671">listen it says you have asked for leave</text>
  <text start="229.799" dur="4.41">to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="3.989">for five days but as you stated in your</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="3.481">interview I have reasons to believe that</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="4.141">you are seeking admission to the United</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="4.109">Kingdom to interview Tommy Robinson a</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="4.29">far-right leader whose materials and</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="5.16">speeches incite racial Rachel racial</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="4.5">hatred you&amp;#39;ve stated at the interview</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="4.831">that you will be filming your boyfriend</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="5.369">Martin Sellner speech at speakers corner</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="5.069">in London Hyde Park your boyfriend</text>
  <text start="254.129" dur="4.621">admitted at the interview to being a</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="4.56">co-founder of the Austrian branch of</text>
  <text start="258.75" dur="4.59">generation identity which is viewed in</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="5.461">the UK as a right-wing organization</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="5.7">furthermore your boyfriend have</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="4.14">in his possession the leaflets with</text>
  <text start="269.04" dur="4.05">scenarios regarding possible violence at</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="5.1">his speech I believe that you your</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="4.65">planned activities whilst in the United</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="3.99">Kingdom bear serious threat to the</text>
  <text start="277.74" dur="4.59">fundamental interest of society and are</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="4.59">likely to incite tensions between local</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="4.82">communities in the United Kingdom you</text>
  <text start="284.7" dur="5.46">have not sought entry under any other</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="6.27">provisions other under the immigration</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="5.12">rules I therefore refuse to you leave I</text>
  <text start="293.42" dur="4.63">refuse</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="5.8">therefore excuse me tongue-tied I</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="5.52">therefore refuse you leave to enter the</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="5.19">United Kingdom removal directions and</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="7.8">they&amp;#39;ve given their direction to remove</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="8.91">them so what does this all tie into and</text>
  <text start="311.37" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s first of all Martin Sellner</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="8.76">had arrived in the country to give a</text>
  <text start="316.92" dur="10.04">speech there in the public square at</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="6.9">speakers corner in London&amp;#39;s Hyde Park</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="5.41">and it&amp;#39;s basically as they&amp;#39;ll highlight</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="2.55">and what I&amp;#39;m going to show you we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="5.7">gonna go through the interview between</text>
  <text start="333.39" dur="7.47">Tommie Robinson and Martin cylinder and</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="4.47">Britany Pettibone but uh he was coming</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="3.51">to one of the the pinnacle places for</text>
  <text start="342.54" dur="3.84">free speech it&amp;#39;s basically like a</text>
  <text start="344.37" dur="4.59">soapbox area where you can just stand up</text>
  <text start="346.38" dur="4.14">on a chair and start talking and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="4.26">where some of the most controversial</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="5.61">political figures have come to speak for</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="7.77">a very long time kind of traditional in</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="8.57">the country and now what happened was</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="6.72">these two activists authors whatever</text>
  <text start="364.7" dur="7.03">they actually were detained in the</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="7.59">British detention area at the airport in</text>
  <text start="371.73" dur="5.91">London upon their arrival for three days</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="5.67">and this is them talking to Tommy</text>
  <text start="377.64" dur="5.64">Robinson in Austria afterwards I think</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="4.32">they flew back to Austria and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="4.53">where they conducted this video so you</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="4.83">obviously have them sitting in Austria</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="4.41">doing this interview with Tommy Robinson</text>
  <text start="390.12" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m gonna annotate it for you kind of</text>
  <text start="392.22" dur="3.81">give you the the big parts let&amp;#39;s take it</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="3.47">the first part where they talk about the</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="3.62">criminal treatment they received Punnett</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="2.97">just explain to me</text>
  <text start="399.65" dur="3.989">walk gently happened from the minute you</text>
  <text start="401" dur="4.44">landed yeah we didn&amp;#39;t land and at</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="4.65">passport control I was holding the guy</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="4.14">asked me if it was hot there before and</text>
  <text start="408.289" dur="4.35">he said it&amp;#39;s just a matter of a few</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="5.16">minutes but this was the beginning of a</text>
  <text start="412.639" dur="4.441">three days detention actually they found</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="3.84">Brittany we were separated we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="417.08" dur="3.24">allowed to look on her phone snow a lot</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="4.29">to talk and then they put us on hold</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="3.78">there to search topics and we spent the</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="3.389">whole day there and then in the night</text>

  <text start="430.66" dur="6.22">treated like criminals so there you have</text>
  <text start="435.229" dur="3.571">the first part is where they explain</text>
  <text start="436.88" dur="3.96">what happened when they arrived now</text>
  <text start="438.8" dur="5.07">here&amp;#39;s where they cover what crime they</text>
  <text start="440.84" dur="5.97">actually committed and what was your</text>
  <text start="443.87" dur="6.419">intention to come in to you guys yeah my</text>
  <text start="446.81" dur="5.579">crime bring this crime for us that you</text>

  <text start="452.389" dur="4.471">I wanted to speak at speakers corner and</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="4.41">even that&amp;#39;s a backstory to it because I</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="3.839">was invited the second time by young</text>
  <text start="459.139" dur="3.391">independence youth movement of you kid</text>
  <text start="460.699" dur="5.101">to give a speech about freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="5.97">at one of their events and both times</text>
  <text start="465.8" dur="6.66">that they lost a venue because of</text>
  <text start="468.5" dur="7.44">pressure of anti-fur against them</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="5.4">threats of violence so there you go I</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="6.349">mean now we&amp;#39;re gonna get into how they</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="6.989">explain that that was their basic</text>
  <text start="482.289" dur="4.06">explanation for why they were kicking</text>
  <text start="484.849" dur="3.331">around the country is literally because</text>
  <text start="486.349" dur="3.421">they thought that his speech would</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="4.2">incite violence therefore he was a</text>
  <text start="489.77" dur="4.769">threat now let&amp;#39;s get into what he</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="5.34">actually what thought crime he was gonna</text>
  <text start="494.539" dur="4.741">commit so I have the official statement</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="5.729">here I&amp;#39;ll just read read the sentence</text>
  <text start="499.28" dur="5.79">which it involves you so they say you</text>
  <text start="503.449" dur="3.451">have asked for leave to enter the United</text>
  <text start="505.07" dur="3.51">Kingdom as a visitor for five days but</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="2.97">as you stated in your interview I have</text>
  <text start="508.58" dur="2.97">reasons to believe that you are seeking</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="3.69">admission to the United Kingdom to</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="3.63">interview Tommy Robinson a far-right</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="5.52">leader whose materials and speeches</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="5.76">incite racial hatred so that said I just</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="4.379">want to add really quick Martin said</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="3.96">okay you can detain me you know I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.459" dur="1.891">give my speech the event won&amp;#39;t happen so</text>
  <text start="524.9" dur="1.8">let</text>
  <text start="525.35" dur="2.67">we go through and she can go and conduct</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="2.76">her interviews because she has other</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="3.63">work there she was just gonna film my</text>
  <text start="529.46" dur="3.84">speech they said no actually your case</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="4.5">is worse because you want to interview</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="8.19">Tommy Robinson so they were completely</text>
  <text start="536.15" dur="8.22">just up in arms about you so they even</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="8.25">told her directly that the the more</text>
  <text start="544.37" dur="8.04">prevalent assault on their safety would</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="4.56">be her just having a chance to sit down</text>
  <text start="552.41" dur="5.64">and cordially interview another human</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="6.12">being now since when has you know just</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="5.67">the ability to have a conversation been</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="5.51">a danger to anyone as far as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="5.22">concerned words don&amp;#39;t kill people and</text>
  <text start="565.93" dur="5.92">until people start realizing that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="4.29">gonna still see problems now this is</text>
  <text start="571.85" dur="4.08">going to be great we&amp;#39;re Sellner kind of</text>
  <text start="573.23" dur="7.16">gets into entirely Robinson gets into</text>
  <text start="575.93" dur="6.6">how antifa work their way into all this</text>
  <text start="580.39" dur="8.86">you guys go ahead and take a look at it</text>
  <text start="582.53" dur="9.03">for yourself I could handle a little bit</text>
  <text start="589.25" dur="4.62">of both because the thing is we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="3.81">incited any kind of violence ever we</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="4.53">just we simply want to go places and</text>
  <text start="595.37" dur="4.83">speak we&amp;#39;re not like chasing after you</text>
  <text start="598.4" dur="4.02">know crazy things happening we just</text>
  <text start="600.2" dur="3.9">wanted to go and speak peacefully and we</text>
  <text start="602.42" dur="4.29">stated that in a video before he went to</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="5.43">the UK what troubles me is the fact that</text>
  <text start="606.71" dur="4.92">they don&amp;#39;t ever pursue and Tifa who set</text>
  <text start="609.53" dur="4.05">up a counter protest on Facebook then</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="3.03">many of them were tweeting for over the</text>
  <text start="613.58" dur="2.46">course of several days about how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.66" dur="1.98">gonna shut this down by any means</text>
  <text start="616.04" dur="3.48">necessary</text>
  <text start="616.64" dur="4.62">and the fact that the UK patrols online</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="3.3">hate speech so often and yet they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="660.6" dur="4.08">showing its totalitarian face and you</text>

  <text start="671.22" dur="3.9">more and more measures to shut them down</text>
  <text start="673.08" dur="3.69">to shut free speech down so I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="675.12" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s linked to each other you see</text>
  <text start="676.77" dur="5.01">at the UK how Western democracies are</text>

  <text start="694.26" dur="4.65">foe if the government&amp;#39;s going to do it</text>

  <text start="731.55" dur="5.49">not afraid to speak his mind and we can</text>
  <text start="734.55" dur="4.11">commend somebody for that especially</text>
  <text start="737.04" dur="3.87">when they use fact and logic and they</text>
  <text start="738.66" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t just blurt out an emotional</text>
  <text start="740.91" dur="5.52">feeling and say that this is why I feel</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="6.66">this way more overly they actually use</text>
  <text start="746.43" dur="5.4">facts to back up what they believe which</text>
  <text start="749.82" dur="3.84">i think is very very important now</text>
  <text start="751.83" dur="3.81">here&amp;#39;s an interesting clip that I heard</text>
  <text start="753.66" dur="5.22">where there&amp;#39;s actually secret Patriots</text>
  <text start="755.64" dur="4.5">inside the UK probably a lot of people</text>
  <text start="758.88" dur="4.2">who would be watching a channel like</text>
  <text start="760.14" dur="4.68">this who actually were giving them words</text>
  <text start="763.08" dur="3.72">of encouragement behind the scenes so</text>
  <text start="764.82" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m gonna let you guys check that out go</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="4.47">back I spoke to several of the border</text>
  <text start="769.26" dur="3.1">patrol people and who were secretly</text>
  <text start="771.27" dur="3.069">white right-wing but</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="3.12">obviously they were very kind to us but</text>
  <text start="774.339" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re live we can&amp;#39;t do anything you</text>
  <text start="775.48" dur="3.33">know we don&amp;#39;t wanna lose our jobs but</text>
  <text start="777.339" dur="3.841">one of them said to me you know the</text>
  <text start="778.81" dur="4.05">British people we just suffer in silence</text>
  <text start="781.18" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s just how we are</text>
  <text start="782.86" dur="4.53">and I said to him that okay if you have</text>
  <text start="785.89" dur="3.449">cancer you don&amp;#39;t suffer in silence</text>
  <text start="787.39" dur="6.66">because it&amp;#39;s only going to get worse</text>
  <text start="789.339" dur="6.24">you have to act in some way or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.05" dur="2.849">gonna incrementally lose your freedoms</text>
  <text start="795.579" dur="3.69">one day it&amp;#39;s going to affect you whether</text>
  <text start="796.899" dur="4.021">or not it is right now one day it will</text>
  <text start="799.269" dur="4.171">so you might as well stand up now</text>
  <text start="800.92" dur="4.859">because you&amp;#39;re only losing every day</text>
  <text start="803.44" dur="6.389">you&amp;#39;re not gaining anything suffering in</text>
  <text start="805.779" dur="5.611">silence and it&amp;#39;s not the option so I</text>
  <text start="809.829" dur="3.601">mean she kind of lays it out perfectly</text>
  <text start="811.39" dur="4.17">that there were people there given them</text>
  <text start="813.43" dur="6.17">words of encouragement people there who</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="7.41">are you know secret quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="819.6" dur="5.77">Patriots to the country who actually are</text>
  <text start="822.97" dur="4.799">working for the best of the betterment</text>
  <text start="825.37" dur="3.63">and no but they need to stand up and I</text>
  <text start="827.769" dur="3.601">think that&amp;#39;s kind of a call to action</text>
  <text start="829" dur="4.5">everybody out there not just those in</text>
  <text start="831.37" dur="4.26">Britain but those in Australia those in</text>
  <text start="833.5" dur="3.48">the United States those in Canada a lot</text>
  <text start="835.63" dur="3.269">of the people that watch this show and</text>
  <text start="836.98" dur="4.169">even comment and I get a lot of great</text>
  <text start="838.899" dur="3.961">comments from these people that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="841.149" dur="3.69">all patriots in their own right and they</text>
  <text start="842.86" dur="5.33">want the best for not only us but they</text>
  <text start="844.839" dur="7.351">want the best for their own country it</text>
  <text start="848.19" dur="8.41">ultimately America can serve as a model</text>
  <text start="852.19" dur="7.2">but we can&amp;#39;t enact it for you with Trump</text>
  <text start="856.6" dur="5.429">and what we&amp;#39;re doing here we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="859.39" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re starting the initiative we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.029" dur="5.25">succeeding day by day by day chipping</text>
  <text start="865.42" dur="3.479">away at the globalists I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="867.279" dur="3.5">people get frustrated at the speed at</text>
  <text start="868.899" dur="4.951">which we actually make progress but</text>
  <text start="870.779" dur="5.761">understand that we&amp;#39;re working inside the</text>
  <text start="873.85" dur="6.12">parameters of our democracy and</text>
  <text start="876.54" dur="6.729">basically our Republic so it&amp;#39;s certainly</text>
  <text start="879.97" dur="4.679">important to understand that and now</text>
  <text start="883.269" dur="3.991">here&amp;#39;s another quick clip from this</text>
  <text start="884.649" dur="5.791">video that kind of goes to the the</text>
  <text start="887.26" dur="8.67">Patriots and silence but the way that</text>
  <text start="890.44" dur="7.05">they silenced the the people there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.93" dur="5.04">just really fascinating let&amp;#39;s watch this</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="5.49">clip really quick it&amp;#39;s what they want is</text>
  <text start="900.97" dur="4.75">silenced I want to silence everybody you</text>
  <text start="902.98" dur="4.479">know Britney was hitting those cells but</text>
  <text start="905.72" dur="3.39">every British citizen is also sitting in</text>
  <text start="907.459" dur="4.951">a cell in a cell of fear and silence</text>
  <text start="909.11" dur="5.279">suffering in silence there and we need</text>
  <text start="912.41" dur="3.33">to get them to come out of the cells and</text>
  <text start="914.389" dur="2.43">all the people went to speaker&amp;#39;s corner</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="3.24">all the people who showed their faces</text>
  <text start="916.819" dur="5.64">they showed that freedom of speech is</text>
  <text start="918.98" dur="6.899">still alive in the okay so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="922.459" dur="5.221">promising that people showed up and you</text>
  <text start="925.879" dur="3.541">know represented selling her even though</text>
  <text start="927.68" dur="4.92">he couldn&amp;#39;t be there and his his speech</text>
  <text start="929.42" dur="4.82">was being sounds but but just as we in</text>
  <text start="932.6" dur="4.679">America have to stand up for our rights</text>
  <text start="934.24" dur="5.349">you and Britain every all you guys in</text>
  <text start="937.279" dur="5.48">Australia all you guys in New Zealand</text>
  <text start="939.589" dur="6.721">and Canada you guys need to stand up and</text>
  <text start="942.759" dur="5.291">affirm your right to free speech even if</text>
  <text start="946.31" dur="3.899">they tried to restrict it and take it</text>
  <text start="948.05" dur="4.62">away from you that is certainly a</text>
  <text start="950.209" dur="4.74">privilege that we all share as human</text>
  <text start="952.67" dur="4.95">beings and it can&amp;#39;t be controlled by</text>
  <text start="954.949" dur="5.01">anyone and the more that we realize that</text>
  <text start="957.62" dur="4.38">the better off I think we&amp;#39;ll be now</text>
  <text start="959.959" dur="5.31">here&amp;#39;s a very interesting part where</text>
  <text start="962" dur="5.129">they talk about how there was a</text>
  <text start="965.269" dur="4.891">possibility of danger to their lives</text>
  <text start="967.129" dur="6.95">because they were locked up in these</text>
  <text start="970.16" dur="9.289">descent detention cells with a bunch of</text>
  <text start="974.079" dur="8.591">migrants and other Africans illegals who</text>
  <text start="979.449" dur="5.95">Africans and Middle Easterners who would</text>
  <text start="982.67" dur="5.58">not think kindly or not take kindly to</text>
  <text start="985.399" dur="4.29">what their political viewpoints are and</text>
  <text start="988.25" dur="4.139">these were like hardened criminals as</text>
  <text start="989.689" dur="6.031">opposed to these authors activists and</text>
  <text start="992.389" dur="5.851">journalists here who are basically being</text>
  <text start="995.72" dur="4.559">persecuted for their ideas being put in</text>
  <text start="998.24" dur="4.589">a jail with these criminals and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1000.279" dur="4.74">gonna go over that right now which is a</text>
  <text start="1002.829" dur="4.2">risk yeah because once people know that</text>
  <text start="1005.019" dur="3.391">you speak about about Islam for example</text>
  <text start="1007.029" dur="4.201">in the detention to know what</text>
  <text start="1008.41" dur="6.149">nationality were the people you most</text>
  <text start="1011.23" dur="4.799">people were black of AB nationality many</text>
  <text start="1014.559" dur="3.061">of them also Muslims so I think if the</text>
  <text start="1016.029" dur="4.05">word spread if I would have stayed a few</text>
  <text start="1017.62" dur="8.37">more days don&amp;#39;t actually really be a</text>
  <text start="1020.079" dur="7.561">real danger in a way boss so but I also</text>
  <text start="1025.99" dur="3.569">to say that the border forces to normal</text>
  <text start="1027.64" dur="4.14">policemen they were very friendly a lot</text>
  <text start="1029.559" dur="4.441">of them are sympathizing with us it was</text>
  <text start="1031.78" dur="3.96">also very British thing like even going</text>
  <text start="1034" dur="3.71">to put put on your handcuffs and search</text>
  <text start="1035.74" dur="3.08">your bodies it was very polite</text>
  <text start="1037.71" dur="3.36">I think it&amp;#39;s a little bit creative</text>
  <text start="1038.82" dur="3.75">people can do it like that well you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1041.07" dur="2.76">really complaining and what we are upset</text>
  <text start="1042.57" dur="3.54">about is the decision of the government</text>
  <text start="1043.83" dur="3.63">but I think it&amp;#39;ll backfire because they</text>
  <text start="1046.11" dur="3.48">wanted to keep it silent they want to</text>
  <text start="1047.46" dur="4.11">keep it on the blanket and they want one</text>
  <text start="1049.59" dur="3.36">no tensions to rise and now they have it</text>
  <text start="1051.57" dur="1.89">back because a lot of people are upset</text>
  <text start="1052.95" dur="2.52">now</text>
  <text start="1053.46" dur="5.49">and they want to know what I was</text>
  <text start="1055.47" dur="5.4">prevented to talk about well why I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1058.95" dur="3.36">seen this for years and what the British</text>
  <text start="1060.87" dur="3.54">government have attempted to do is</text>
  <text start="1062.31" dur="3.66">obviously silence you and what I believe</text>
  <text start="1064.41" dur="3.69">the reason for that is because they they</text>
  <text start="1065.97" dur="3.63">are worried about the reaction they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1068.1" dur="2.94">always so basically they&amp;#39;ll take away</text>
  <text start="1069.6" dur="6.06">your voice low they take away my voice</text>
  <text start="1071.04" dur="7.14">because of a violent opposition now so</text>
  <text start="1075.66" dur="4.35">there you go I mean it&amp;#39;s time your outs</text>
  <text start="1078.18" dur="4.08">and getting into more detail about what</text>
  <text start="1080.01" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re doing but you saw it right there</text>
  <text start="1082.26" dur="5.63">where he kind of lays it out pretty</text>
  <text start="1084.96" dur="7.4">clearly and succinctly</text>
  <text start="1087.89" dur="7.06">and what we&amp;#39;re gonna get into here is</text>
  <text start="1092.36" dur="6.76">something I want to be totally</text>
  <text start="1094.95" dur="7.44">supportive of is that Tommy Robinson is</text>
