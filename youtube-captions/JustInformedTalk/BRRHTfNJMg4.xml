  <text start="240.6" dur="4.68">villain or something and you know this</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="2.7">is what we&amp;#39;re up against here people</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="4.769">these lying</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="5.88">corrupt career politicians lying corrupt</text>
  <text start="250.049" dur="5.22">career bureaucrats and lying corrupt</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="4.379">fake news media reporters who are all</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="4.47">working together right now</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="5.371">to lie to you there and you know the</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="3.99">best part is it&amp;#39;s projection it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.14" dur="3.12">psychological projection whatever you</text>
  <text start="263.729" dur="3.331">think whatever you know you&amp;#39;re guilty</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="3.03">about you you tend to put</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="3.51">to other people that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.29" dur="6.27">doing if you watch Jerry Nadler you can</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="6.21">almost see this kind of Gestalt that he</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="4.08">gets from reading out of his written</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="4.14">statement he goes president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.64" dur="5.19">lying to you and he&amp;#39;s a liar and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.92" dur="4.17">like man this is what has come down to</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="2.82">these people don&amp;#39;t want to legislate</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="3.51">they don&amp;#39;t want to make our country</text>
  <text start="286.65" dur="4.17">better they don&amp;#39;t want to tackle issues</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="3.6">like health care border crisis they</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t want to tackle the real issues</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="4.14">that are killing this country you know</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="4.23">infrastructure what they want to do is</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="3.92">they want to unseat a duly elected</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="5.49">president and they&amp;#39;ve spent two years</text>
  <text start="300.26" dur="7.38">now doing this more more than two years</text>
  <text start="303.84" dur="6.66">and this is just getting beyond me</text>
  <text start="307.64" dur="5.47">because it&amp;#39;s what this is what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="3.87">next so they&amp;#39;re still reluctant to</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="2.85">embrace impeachment because they know</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="2.88">it&amp;#39;s gonna backfire armed first of all</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;ll never get it through the Senate</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="5.49">therefore it will never become anything</text>
  <text start="319.29" dur="6.66">more than a political stunt and they</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="5.429">know there&amp;#39;s no evidence so even if they</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="5.13">do get this impeachment somehow through</text>
  <text start="328.169" dur="4.771">and they actually go to vote on</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="4.32">everything I&amp;#39;m tell you what there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="4.289">nothing there you can&amp;#39;t convict</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="3.18">something for a crime that never convict</text>
  <text start="337.229" dur="4.141">someone for a crime that never happened</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="6.75">and then they make up this whole push</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="6.51">for obstruction because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a in</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="4.47">the legal terms it&amp;#39;s defined in a gray</text>
  <text start="347.88" dur="3.72">area where it&amp;#39;s objectively can be</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="3.3">applied you could say well he was</text>
  <text start="351.6" dur="3.18">obstructing justice here he was</text>
  <text start="353.1" dur="3.15">obstructing justice here but there was</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="3.3">never a crime and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="4.76">set him up from the beginning and this</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="5.91">was their big trap and Hugh told us back</text>

  <text start="1221.22" dur="6.38">report explains that decision it</text>
  <text start="1225.93" dur="4.89">explains that under long-standing</text>
  <text start="1227.6" dur="5.26">department policy a president president</text>
  <text start="1230.82" dur="4.79">cannot be charged with a federal crime</text>
  <text start="1232.86" dur="5.55">while he is in office that is</text>

  <text start="1247.02" dur="5.93">Department of Justice and by regulation</text>
  <text start="1249.42" dur="5.91">it was bound by that department policy</text>
  <text start="1252.95" dur="4.63">charging the president with a crime was</text>
  <text start="1255.33" dur="6">therefore not an option</text>
  <text start="1257.58" dur="5.85">we could consider the department&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1261.33" dur="4.73">written opinion explaining the policy</text>
  <text start="1263.43" dur="5.25">makes several important points that</text>

  <text start="1268.68" dur="5.4">obstruction investigation those points</text>
  <text start="1272.04" dur="5.76">are summarized in our report and I will</text>
  <text start="1274.08" dur="6.24">describe two of them for you first the</text>
  <text start="1277.8" dur="5.03">opinion explicitly explicitly permits</text>
  <text start="1280.32" dur="4.74">the investigation of a sitting president</text>
  <text start="1282.83" dur="4.41">because it is important to preserve</text>
  <text start="1285.06" dur="5.94">evidence while memories are fresh and</text>
  <text start="1287.24" dur="5.53">documents available among other things</text>
  <text start="1291" dur="4.08">that evidence could be used if there</text>
  <text start="1292.77" dur="3.33">were co-conspirators who could be</text>
  <text start="1295.08" dur="4.17">charged now</text>
  <text start="1296.1" dur="6">and second the opinion says that the</text>
  <text start="1299.25" dur="5.88">Constitution requires a process other</text>
  <text start="1302.1" dur="5.52">than the criminal justice system to</text>
  <text start="1305.13" dur="7.14">formally accuse a sitting president of</text>
  <text start="1307.62" dur="7.07">wrongdoing and beyond Department policy</text>
  <text start="1312.27" dur="7.14">we were guided by principles of fairness</text>
  <text start="1314.69" dur="6.85">it would be unfair to potentially it</text>
  <text start="1319.41" dur="4.86">would be unfair to potentially accuse</text>
  <text start="1321.54" dur="6.96">somebody of a crime when there can be no</text>
  <text start="1324.27" dur="7.05">court resolution of the actual charge so</text>
  <text start="1328.5" dur="4.38">that was Justice Department policy those</text>
  <text start="1331.32" dur="2.92">were the principles under which we</text>
  <text start="1332.88" dur="3.49">operated</text>
  <text start="1334.24" dur="5.37">and from them we concluded that we would</text>
  <text start="1336.37" dur="5.34">would not reach a determination one way</text>
  <text start="1339.61" dur="5.43">or the other about whether the president</text>
  <text start="1341.71" dur="5.76">committed a crime that is the opposite</text>
  <text start="1345.04" dur="4.56">yeah that is the opposite final position</text>
  <text start="1347.47" dur="4.95">and we will now comment on any other</text>
  <text start="1349.6" dur="6.03">conclusions or hypotheticals about the</text>
  <text start="1352.42" dur="6.42">president we conducted an independent</text>
  <text start="1355.63" dur="4.7">criminal investigation and reported the</text>
  <text start="1358.84" dur="5.79">results to the Attorney General as</text>
  <text start="1360.33" dur="5.89">required by department regulations the</text>
  <text start="1364.63" dur="4.26">Attorney General then concluded that it</text>
  <text start="1366.22" dur="6.24">is appropriate to provide our report to</text>
  <text start="1368.89" dur="5.31">Congress and to the American people at</text>
  <text start="1372.46" dur="3.3">one point in time I requested that</text>
  <text start="1374.2" dur="3.93">certain portions of the report be</text>
  <text start="1375.76" dur="4.59">released the Attorney General preparing</text>
  <text start="1378.13" dur="4.77">preferred to make that and prefer to</text>
  <text start="1380.35" dur="5.64">make the entire report public all at</text>
  <text start="1382.9" dur="5.31">once and we appreciate that the Attorney</text>
  <text start="1385.99" dur="4.44">General made the report largely public</text>
  <text start="1388.21" dur="3.69">and I certainly did not question the</text>
  <text start="1390.43" dur="3.71">Attorney General&amp;#39;s good faith in that</text>
  <text start="1391.9" dur="4.65">decision</text>
  <text start="1394.14" dur="3.91">now I hope and expect this to be the</text>
  <text start="1396.55" dur="5.34">only time that I will speak to you in</text>
  <text start="1398.05" dur="6.84">this manner I am making that decision</text>
  <text start="1401.89" dur="6.24">myself no one has told me whether I can</text>
  <text start="1404.89" dur="6.42">or should testify or speak further about</text>
  <text start="1408.13" dur="5.67">this matter there has been discussion</text>
  <text start="1411.31" dur="4.53">about an appearance before Congress any</text>
  <text start="1413.8" dur="6">testimony from this office would not go</text>
  <text start="1415.84" dur="6.51">beyond our report it contains our</text>
  <text start="1419.8" dur="6.18">findings and analysis and the reasons</text>
  <text start="1422.35" dur="5.64">for the decisions we made we chose those</text>
  <text start="1425.98" dur="6.3">words carefully and the work speaks for</text>
  <text start="1427.99" dur="6.72">itself and the report is my testimony I</text>
  <text start="1432.28" dur="5.28">would not provide information beyond</text>

  <text start="1445.48" dur="6.42">that doesn&amp;#39;t that does not involve our</text>
  <text start="1447.97" dur="6.48">office so beyond what I&amp;#39;ve said here</text>
  <text start="1451.9" dur="4.74">today and what is contained in our</text>
  <text start="1454.45" dur="3.81">written work I do not believe it is</text>
  <text start="1456.64" dur="4.17">appropriate for me to speak further</text>
  <text start="1458.26" dur="4.77">about the investigation or to comment on</text>
  <text start="1460.81" dur="2.98">the actions of the Justice Department or</text>
  <text start="1463.03" dur="2.59">Congress</text>
  <text start="1463.79" dur="5.37">and it&amp;#39;s for that reason I will not be</text>
  <text start="1465.62" dur="5.85">taking questions today as well now</text>
  <text start="1469.16" dur="6.36">before I step away and I want to thank</text>
  <text start="1471.47" dur="6.39">the attorneys the FBI agents the</text>
  <text start="1475.52" dur="5.16">analysts the professional staff who</text>
  <text start="1477.86" dur="6.99">helped us conduct this investigation in</text>
  <text start="1480.68" dur="6.09">a fair and independent manner these</text>

  <text start="1489.53" dur="5.88">the highest integrity and I will close</text>
  <text start="1493.16" dur="5.48">by reiterating the central allegation of</text>
  <text start="1495.41" dur="6.57">our indictments that there were multiple</text>
  <text start="1498.64" dur="6.61">systemic efforts to interfere in our</text>
  <text start="1501.98" dur="6.93">election and that allegation deserves</text>
  <text start="1505.25" dur="5.79">the attention of every American thank</text>
  <text start="1508.91" dur="4.05">you thank you for being here today mr.</text>
  <text start="1511.04" dur="5.22">Muller and his team of prosecutors and</text>
  <text start="1512.96" dur="6.06">investigators worked tirelessly to</text>
  <text start="1516.26" dur="5.52">follow the facts and pursue justice to</text>
  <text start="1519.02" dur="4.92">the furthest extent allowed although</text>
  <text start="1521.78" dur="4.11">Department of Justice policy prevented</text>
  <text start="1523.94" dur="3.6">the Special Counsel from bringing</text>
  <text start="1525.89" dur="4.05">criminal charges against the president</text>
  <text start="1527.54" dur="4.86">the special counsel has clearly</text>
  <text start="1529.94" dur="5.4">demonstrated that President Trump is</text>
  <text start="1532.4" dur="5.28">lying he is lying about the special</text>
  <text start="1535.34" dur="4.11">counsels findings lying about the</text>
  <text start="1537.68" dur="4.41">testimony of key witnesses in the</text>
  <text start="1539.45" dur="4.89">special counsels report and above all</text>
  <text start="1542.09" dur="4.77">lying and saying that the special</text>
  <text start="1544.34" dur="5.33">counsel found no obstruction and no</text>
  <text start="1546.86" dur="5.31">collusion in a statement this morning</text>
  <text start="1549.67" dur="5.38">special counsel Muller reaffirms his</text>
  <text start="1552.17" dur="4.38">report it found substantial evidence</text>
  <text start="1555.05" dur="4.68">that Russia attacked our political</text>
  <text start="1556.55" dur="6.33">system that the Trump campaign benefited</text>
  <text start="1559.73" dur="5.04">from Russian interference that Trump in</text>
  <text start="1562.88" dur="4.5">those around him repeatedly welcomed</text>
  <text start="1564.77" dur="5.1">Russia&amp;#39;s support and that throughout the</text>
  <text start="1567.38" dur="6.2">subsequent investigation Trump sought to</text>
  <text start="1569.87" dur="6.99">obstruct Muller time and time again</text>
  <text start="1573.58" dur="5.92">special counsel Muller today repeated</text>
  <text start="1576.86" dur="6.33">three central points which are critical</text>
  <text start="1579.5" dur="6.6">for the American people one the special</text>
  <text start="1583.19" dur="5.16">counsel did not exonerate the President</text>
  <text start="1586.1" dur="3.41">of the United States of obstruction of</text>
  <text start="1588.35" dur="5.09">justice</text>
  <text start="1589.51" dur="5.549">to obstruction of justice of which</text>
  <text start="1593.44" dur="4.5">special counsel mother found substantial</text>
  <text start="1595.059" dur="5.581">evidence is a serious crime</text>
  <text start="1597.94" dur="6.39">that strikes at the core of our justice</text>
  <text start="1600.64" dur="5.97">system three the Constitution points to</text>
  <text start="1604.33" dur="5.69">Congress to take action to hold the</text>
  <text start="1606.61" dur="6.12">president accountable for his misconduct</text>
  <text start="1610.02" dur="4.39">unfortunately special counsel mullah was</text>
  <text start="1612.73" dur="4.41">unable to pursue criminal charges</text>
  <text start="1614.41" dur="5.31">against the president because Department</text>
  <text start="1617.14" dur="5.19">of Justice policy prevents a sitting</text>
  <text start="1619.72" dur="5.43">president from being prosecuted that</text>
  <text start="1622.33" dur="5.25">policy in my opinion is wrong but it</text>
  <text start="1625.15" dur="4.769">prevented the Special Counsel from</text>
  <text start="1627.58" dur="3.44">pursuing justice to the fullest extent</text>
  <text start="1629.919" dur="4.201">possible</text>
  <text start="1631.02" dur="5.74">therefore as Muller again highlighted</text>
  <text start="1634.12" dur="3.87">this morning it falls to Congress to</text>
  <text start="1636.76" dur="4.799">respond to the crimes</text>
  <text start="1637.99" dur="8.01">lies and other wrongdoing of President</text>
  <text start="1641.559" dur="6.781">Trump we will do so make no mistake no</text>
  <text start="1646" dur="15.75">one not even the President of the United</text>
  <text start="1648.34" dur="17.43">States is above the law mr. Muller told</text>
  <text start="1661.75" dur="6.12">us a lot of what we need to hear today</text>
  <text start="1665.77" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s very important to be clear on what</text>
  <text start="1667.87" dur="3.929">he told us on what the special</text>
  <text start="1669.94" dur="4.1">prosecutor told the American people he</text>
  <text start="1671.799" dur="4.201">reaffirmed what was in the investigation</text>
  <text start="1674.04" dur="4.09">which was in the report about the</text>
  <text start="1676" dur="3.48">investigation which found substantial</text>
  <text start="1678.13" dur="3.84">evidence that Russia attacked our</text>
  <text start="1679.48" dur="4.199">political system that the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="1681.97" dur="3.72">benefited from Russia&amp;#39;s interference</text>
  <text start="1683.679" dur="5.011">that Trump and those around them</text>
  <text start="1685.69" dur="4.979">repeatedly welcomed Russia&amp;#39;s support and</text>
  <text start="1688.69" dur="4.229">that throughout the investigation Trump</text>
  <text start="1690.669" dur="4.26">sought to obstruct justice and undermine</text>
  <text start="1692.919" dur="4.26">Muller and the investigation over and</text>
  <text start="1694.929" dur="4.441">over again the president did the</text>
  <text start="1697.179" dur="4.171">investors I&amp;#39;m sorry the special counsel</text>
  <text start="1699.37" dur="3.33">did not exonerate the president from</text>
  <text start="1701.35" dur="3.54">having a committed a crime</text>
  <text start="1702.7" dur="3.78">DOJ policy prevented Muller from</text>
  <text start="1704.89" dur="3.74">bringing criminal charges against the</text>
  <text start="1706.48" dur="4.56">president so the president is lying</text>
  <text start="1708.63" dur="4.69">about the special counsels findings</text>
  <text start="1711.04" dur="3.75">lying and saying that the special</text>
  <text start="1713.32" dur="3.33">counsel found no obstruction and no</text>
  <text start="1714.79" dur="3.48">conclusion and I should add the Attorney</text>
  <text start="1716.65" dur="3.84">General is lying about that too</text>
  <text start="1718.27" dur="3.78">that is serious and we will take action</text>
  <text start="1720.49" dur="4.56">to hold the president accountable</text>
  <text start="1722.05" dur="5.1">misconduct again I&amp;#39;ll repeat no one not</text>
  <text start="1725.05" dur="4.65">even the president is above the law</text>
  <text start="1727.15" dur="4.44">thank you what better way in the pic a</text>
  <text start="1729.7" dur="3.57">discretionary crime like obstruction of</text>
  <text start="1731.59" dur="2.43">justice where you don&amp;#39;t need a bank who</text>
  <text start="1733.27" dur="3.21">cares</text>
  <text start="1734.02" dur="4.32">you just keep the investigation open and</text>
  <text start="1736.48" dur="4.41">use every single thing Trump says</text>
  <text start="1738.34" dur="6.06">publicly as evidence of him obstructing</text>
  <text start="1740.89" dur="5.67">a crime that never happened isn&amp;#39;t it you</text>
  <text start="1744.4" dur="4.11">probably specially like this actually</text>
  <text start="1746.56" dur="4.11">happened what are we in Cuba</text>
  <text start="1748.51" dur="4.11">that means the Cubans are honest about</text>
  <text start="1750.67" dur="3.81">it but there were socialists we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
