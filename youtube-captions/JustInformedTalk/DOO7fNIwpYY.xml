  <text start="97.17" dur="5.64">of this episode now getting into the</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="6.96">latest Q post first Q post here not</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="6.36">official quote-unquote product 5 eyes</text>
  <text start="106.259" dur="5.341">listen carefully no evidence to support</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="4.47">POTUS targeting none do you understand</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="4.47">the gravity of what&amp;#39;s unfolding evil and</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="3.54">corruption she had to win it all costs</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="3.18">you know why</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="5.299">how do people support vote for these</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="9.899">people and it gives a link to a Fox News</text>
  <text start="122.479" dur="8.411">clip from a show and sign Q here is that</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="3.241">clip and we&amp;#39;re gonna watch it for a</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="3.27">minute here we&amp;#39;re gonna actually go</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="2.2">through some of the key points that are</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="3.579">brought up</text>
  <text start="134.59" dur="5.61">but this is a video in an interview so</text>
  <text start="137.739" dur="6.381">you have Sunday morning futures a show</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="8.789">on Fox News being hosted by Maria</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="8.14">Bartiromo and she reports for Fox News</text>
  <text start="148.989" dur="5.911">but she&amp;#39;s actually literally getting the</text>
  <text start="152.26" dur="5.49">exact answers from Devyn Nunez that we</text>
  <text start="154.9" dur="5.03">all understand are true not to mention</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="4.11">the fact that Devon Nunez is obviously</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="6.04">pointing to things that we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="7.17">here on the cute on boards as in proof</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="5.31">that Q has foreknowledge of future</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="4.89">events now we&amp;#39;re going to go through</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="5.429">this and I want you guys to watch first</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="5.539">the reason for spying on Trump with the</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="5.761">five eyes this is the justification that</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="37.36">has been able to uncover to this point</text>
  <text start="182.47" dur="35.389">so guys intelligence original reasons</text>
  <text start="216.819" dur="3.75">that the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="217.859" dur="4.541">investigation was started now this is</text>
  <text start="220.569" dur="4.111">really important to us because a</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="5.459">counterintelligence investigation uses</text>
  <text start="224.68" dur="5.399">the tools of our intelligence services</text>
  <text start="227.859" dur="4.171">that are not supposed to be used on</text>
  <text start="230.079" dur="4.321">American citizens so we&amp;#39;ve long wanted</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="4.799">to know well what intelligence did you</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="7.199">have that actually led to this</text>
  <text start="236.829" dur="6.99">investigation so right there you heard</text>
  <text start="241.599" dur="5.851">it for yourself they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="243.819" dur="5.67">there really is no imminence of this</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="4.2">Russian collusion other than what has</text>
  <text start="249.489" dur="3.84">been manufactured by the lying criminals</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="4.829">at the Department of Justice FBI</text>
  <text start="253.329" dur="5.641">Department of State and Devon Nunez is</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="4.44">actually very courageous and standing up</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="7.17">and talking about the fact that the five</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="7.321">eyes have produced no evidence and it</text>
  <text start="266.14" dur="4.32">may seem when you listen to this clip at</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="6.96">first that what Devon Nunez is saying</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="5.73">something to the effect of the five eyes</text>
  <text start="275.2" dur="2.49">had nothing to do with this</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="5.13">investigation but if you listen</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="6.33">carefully as Q tells us to you actually</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="4.86">see that what he&amp;#39;s saying is who brought</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="4.32">up the five eyes he just is bringing it</text>
  <text start="286.18" dur="5.7">up basically out of nowhere saying in</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="7.1">relation to this these accusations there</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="6.839">is no proof other than the fact that</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="5.14">there may have been collection of this</text>
  <text start="298.719" dur="4.051">data and then there was proof so I mean</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="3.63">you guys listen and let me know for</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="3.59">yourselves what you think but here you</text>
  <text start="304.21" dur="2.15">go</text>
  <text start="306.59" dur="4.99">so what we found now after the</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="4.56">investigators have reviewed it is that</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="5.33">in fact there was no intelligence so we</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="5.58">have a traditional we have a traditional</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="5.08">partnership with what&amp;#39;s called the five</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="4.86">eyes agreement five eyes agreement</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="4.5">involves our friends in Australia New</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="5.34">Zealand the United Kingdom Canada and of</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="4.92">course us so longtime process and</text>
  <text start="329.64" dur="3.6">procedures in place where we move</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="4.41">intelligence across we are not supposed</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="4.47">to spy on each other citizens and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="3.78">worked well and it continues to work</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="4.11">well and we know it&amp;#39;s working well</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="4.83">because there was no intelligence that</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="4.98">pass from five eyes through the five</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="4.41">eyes channels to our government and</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s why we had to see that original</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="3.63">communication so now we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="350.43" dur="4.29">figure out as you know we are</text>
  <text start="352.47" dur="4.89">investigating the State Department we</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="4.44">think there&amp;#39;s some major irregularities</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="4.08">at the State Department and we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="4.95">to figure out how it is that this</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="5.34">information about mr. Papadopoulos of</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="6.15">all people who was supposedly meeting</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="6.45">with some folks in London how that made</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="4.53">it over across into the FBI&amp;#39;s hands we</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="2.49">know a little bit about that because of</text>
  <text start="374.79" dur="3.48">what some of the State Department</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="4.789">officials themselves have said about</text>
  <text start="378.27" dur="5.069">that</text>
  <text start="380.509" dur="4.84">so there you go obviously right there</text>
  <text start="383.339" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re talking about things that are very</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="5.64">important to the issues at hand</text>
  <text start="389.459" dur="3.48">especially the stuff we&amp;#39;re covering here</text>
  <text start="390.989" dur="3.6">on the cue boards regarding the fact</text>
  <text start="392.939" dur="6.27">that if you listen carefully really</text>
  <text start="394.589" dur="6.15">saying the five eyes didn&amp;#39;t find any</text>
  <text start="399.209" dur="2.82">intelligence they didn&amp;#39;t they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="400.739" dur="2.25">responsible for producing a tone just</text>
  <text start="402.029" dur="2.25">because there was no intelligence</text>
  <text start="402.989" dur="4.44">because they were basically being</text>
  <text start="404.279" dur="4.65">illegally used against the person</text>
  <text start="407.429" dur="4.11">running for president in the United</text>
  <text start="408.929" dur="4.53">States here this is what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="411.539" dur="5.22">about with the five eyes which is the</text>
  <text start="413.459" dur="5.97">the British Canadian Australian and the</text>
  <text start="416.759" dur="8.04">United States and and someone else HQ</text>
  <text start="419.429" dur="9.09">all of our countries joint intelligence</text>
  <text start="424.799" dur="5.64">being used by other countries so if the</text>
  <text start="428.519" dur="4.23">Australian government wants to spy on</text>
  <text start="430.439" dur="3.51">somebody in Australia the last the</text>
  <text start="432.749" dur="3.84">Canadian government to give them</text>
  <text start="433.949" dur="4.5">information about it if the Americans</text>
  <text start="436.589" dur="4.32">want to spy on somebody in America will</text>
  <text start="438.449" dur="4.77">ask the British GCHQ to give us</text>
  <text start="440.909" dur="2.76">information about them that&amp;#39;s how it</text>
  <text start="443.219" dur="2.19">works</text>
  <text start="443.669" dur="4.05">and then the British can say that</text>
  <text start="445.409" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re spying on a enemy of the state</text>
  <text start="447.719" dur="4.02">whatever easily defendable in their</text>
  <text start="450.269" dur="6.81">country and they can share that</text>
  <text start="451.739" dur="7.68">information with us thereby passing over</text>
  <text start="457.079" dur="4.98">our constitutional protections our</text>
  <text start="459.419" dur="4.32">Fourth Amendment rights our ability to</text>
  <text start="462.059" dur="4.08">have any kind of privacy in this country</text>
  <text start="463.739" dur="6.51">because the deep state can just dictate</text>
  <text start="466.139" dur="6.03">when and how they want to effectively</text>
  <text start="470.249" dur="3.47">spy on the people who are going to be</text>
  <text start="472.169" dur="3.81">effecting change in this country now</text>
  <text start="473.719" dur="4.69">listening the next one then I talked</text>
  <text start="475.979" dur="19.14">about how the FBI had no Intel which I</text>
  <text start="478.409" dur="20.16">think is very interesting we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="495.119" dur="4.86">seen well maybe there was one that went</text>
  <text start="498.569" dur="3.36">through a different channel that was</text>
  <text start="499.979" dur="4.05">kept really quiet that was secret that</text>
  <text start="501.929" dur="4.2">was kept from the Congress and and other</text>
  <text start="504.029" dur="4.44">folks well in fact after our</text>
  <text start="506.129" dur="3.69">investigators reviewed this that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="508.469" dur="4.761">is not what happened there what there</text>
  <text start="509.819" dur="5.871">was no five eyes intelligence product</text>
  <text start="513.23" dur="4.08">as it&amp;#39;s been reported there was no</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="3.48">product and I think that&amp;#39;s a major</text>
  <text start="517.31" dur="3.33">problem because we have to have trust</text>
  <text start="519.17" dur="3.48">with our with our partners with our</text>
  <text start="520.64" dur="5.19">allies we have to make sure that our</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="4.74">agencies talk and they work out problems</text>
  <text start="525.83" dur="3.87">we have to make sure that they don&amp;#39;t spy</text>
  <text start="527.39" dur="3.96">on on either American citizens or that</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re not spying on British citizens</text>
  <text start="531.35" dur="5.16">these are all things that have been</text>
  <text start="533.21" dur="5.04">around for decades so and this is even</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="3.69">more critical let&amp;#39;s just let&amp;#39;s just at</text>
  <text start="538.25" dur="4.02">the highest level what what is this what</text>
  <text start="540.2" dur="4.11">is this about this was about a</text>
  <text start="542.27" dur="5.28">counterintelligence investigation that</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="6.15">was at the at the height of a political</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="5.57">campaign where you opened up an</text>
  <text start="550.46" dur="6.36">investigation using these these</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="8.88">intelligence services to spy on the</text>
  <text start="556.82" dur="5.18">other campaign it&amp;#39;s really serious stuff</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="4.57">yeah it is really serious stuff and if</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="3.72">you watch what we&amp;#39;re gonna get into next</text>
  <text start="566.81" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re actually going to talk about the</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="6.45">Comey memos which i think is very</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="7.86">interesting to talk about the reasoning</text>
  <text start="575.06" dur="6.18">behind them being put out pushed out and</text>
  <text start="578.09" dur="4.95">then if we talk about it with QQ has</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="4.17">referred to them as being fake but if we</text>
  <text start="583.04" dur="3.99">talk about in regards to what Nunez is</text>
  <text start="585.41" dur="6.45">talking about here they were pushed out</text>
  <text start="587.03" dur="7.71">because he&amp;#39;s making a case for criminal</text>
  <text start="591.86" dur="4.74">charges against himself by exposing the</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="3.12">fact that he was a criminal leaker but</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="4.08">then on the same heel</text>
  <text start="597.86" dur="4.2">token it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s in fascinating to see</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="3.27">how he&amp;#39;s actually vindicating the</text>
  <text start="602.06" dur="3.9">president of all guilt in the Russian</text>
  <text start="603.95" dur="3.6">conspiracy but that&amp;#39;s not what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="605.96" dur="3.48">talking about in his interviews and then</text>
  <text start="607.55" dur="5.7">Devin Nunez is just simply pointing out</text>
  <text start="609.44" dur="5.46">that it&amp;#39;s obvious that Comey has a</text>
  <text start="613.25" dur="4.62">striking difference between what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="4.65">saying publicly in these interviews and</text>
  <text start="617.87" dur="4.02">what he&amp;#39;s actually written down and</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="5.97">implicated in the memos that had been</text>
  <text start="621.89" dur="18.54">turned over so fascinating but you guys</text>
  <text start="625.52" dur="17.54">be the judge watch it for yourself they</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="6.12">moved on to obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="643.06" dur="5.77">obstruction of justice was able to</text>
  <text start="646.55" dur="4.32">review these a long time ago and mr.</text>
  <text start="648.83" dur="4.38">Goodlatte had said and now we know this</text>
  <text start="650.87" dur="4.92">from reading them is that once you read</text>
  <text start="653.21" dur="5.82">all of the Comey memos it becomes</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="4.98">Exhibit A in a defense against that</text>
  <text start="659.03" dur="4.02">there was no obstruction of justice so</text>
  <text start="660.77" dur="4.83">this would so I think when you read all</text>
  <text start="663.05" dur="4.29">of them good legal minds review these</text>

  <text start="694.58" dur="5.07">that he&amp;#39;s giving I think he&amp;#39;s got a lot</text>
  <text start="696.92" dur="4.47">of problems coming in the future as it</text>
  <text start="699.65" dur="4.17">relates to what the IG is looking at</text>
  <text start="701.39" dur="7.17">into his behavior in the concerning the</text>
  <text start="703.82" dur="6.69">Clinton email investigation yes James</text>
  <text start="708.56" dur="4.47">Comey has a lot to look forward to in</text>
  <text start="710.51" dur="3.8">the coming investigations basically</text>
  <text start="713.03" dur="3.66">given the fact that he&amp;#39;s leaked</text>

  <text start="716.69" dur="4.38">classified</text>
  <text start="717.5" dur="4.82">so obviously and he&amp;#39;s politically biased</text>
  <text start="721.07" dur="3.84">which is you&amp;#39;re supposed to be a</text>
  <text start="722.32" dur="5.28">nonpartisan as the director of the FBI</text>

  <text start="737.09" dur="2.34">going to get him to something</text>
  <text start="737.93" dur="3.36">interesting where devonee&amp;#39;s talks about</text>
  <text start="739.43" dur="17.52">the possibility of criminal charges</text>
  <text start="741.29" dur="18.14">against James Comey please watch this is</text>
  <text start="756.95" dur="2.48">not true</text>
  <text start="765.26" dur="5.37">the right to go talk to the press so</text>
  <text start="768.2" dur="5.82">this all has to be flushed out clearly</text>
  <text start="770.63" dur="5.73">the IG doesn&amp;#39;t believe the IG believed</text>
  <text start="774.02" dur="3.9">mr. Comey that Comey did not get mr.</text>
  <text start="776.36" dur="3.75">McCabe the ability to go talk to the</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="4.14">press now as it relates to mr. Comey</text>
  <text start="780.11" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;ve got the added problem now that</text>
  <text start="782.06" dur="4.47">the memos that he wrote the seven memos</text>
  <text start="784.97" dur="3.57">that he decided to write on President</text>
  <text start="786.53" dur="3.69">Trump never wrote memos on any of the</text>
  <text start="788.54" dur="4.29">other meetings he had with would the</text>
  <text start="790.22" dur="4.47">other president or the the AG or anyone</text>
  <text start="792.83" dur="3.75">else prior to this but he wrote kept</text>
  <text start="794.69" dur="5.07">seven memos four of those were</text>
  <text start="796.58" dur="5.52">classified he decided to launder them to</text>
  <text start="799.76" dur="5.19">a friend who then leaked them to the New</text>
  <text start="802.1" dur="6.45">York Times if those memos contain</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="5.43">classified information he purposely did</text>
  <text start="808.55" dur="5.1">that he purposely leaked them in order</text>
  <text start="810.38" dur="5.7">to get a special counsel started after</text>
  <text start="813.65" dur="4.83">he was fired he leaked pieces of these</text>
  <text start="816.08" dur="4.05">so we need to figure out exactly what is</text>
  <text start="818.48" dur="5.32">it that he leaked who did he give these</text>
  <text start="820.13" dur="4.93">memos to and was it just the friend</text>
  <text start="823.8" dur="3.9">to the New York Times or were there</text>
  <text start="825.06" dur="4.41">others I believe there were others i</text>
  <text start="827.7" dur="5.25">think i think that these Comey memos</text>
  <text start="829.47" dur="6.6">were actually given to several people</text>
  <text start="832.95" dur="6">it contained classified information the</text>
  <text start="836.07" dur="6.38">irony is the very thing that mr. Comey</text>
  <text start="838.95" dur="3.5">cleared mrs. Clinton up</text>
  <text start="843.82" dur="5.38">so there you have it obviously there is</text>
  <text start="846.68" dur="4.11">so much going on that is just being</text>
  <text start="849.2" dur="3.62">pointed to here by Devon Nunez and</text>
  <text start="850.79" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s what Q is pointing us to so</text>
  <text start="852.82" dur="5.65">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at right now so this</text>
  <text start="856.85" dur="4.56">makes a lot more sense when we go back</text>
