  <text start="355.08" dur="4.17">know back in April</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="6.21">Rudy of 2018 Rudy Giuliani joined</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="4.979">president Trump&amp;#39;s legal team so and he</text>
  <text start="362.7" dur="3.3">was directly discussing all this with</text>
  <text start="364.229" dur="3.451">Muller well that&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="366" dur="3.15">if Rudy Giuliani was taking all the</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="3.39">stuff that he had found from that</text>
  <text start="369.15" dur="3.81">insurance filing going to Robert Muller</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="4.17">maybe that&amp;#39;s why Robert Muller was</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="3.8">forced to come out and say that</text>
  <text start="375.24" dur="5.31">President Trump did nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="5.92">because he couldn&amp;#39;t lie because they had</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="3.63">the proof to show that everything that</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="4.62">Muller and the Democrats were accusing</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="6.87">president Trump of in fact the Democrats</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="5.549">and Muller were guilty of right and this</text>
  <text start="391.05" dur="3.989">was back in April 2008 Dean where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.849" dur="4.201">being told this Q says we have</text>

  <text start="400.53" dur="3.81">what are you witnessing unfold trust the</text>
  <text start="402.54" dur="4.74">plan Q now this is why a lot of people</text>
  <text start="404.34" dur="4.98">think that this whistleblower is a part</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="3.6">of the broader plan the operation and</text>
  <text start="409.32" dur="3.48">that President Trump did this</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="4.32">purposefully to bring this whole</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="3.69">Ukrainian case to light so that they</text>
  <text start="415.2" dur="3.42">could go after the corruption with</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="4.53">hunter Biden and Joe Biden and Ukraine</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="3.87">and China and that&amp;#39;s the tip of the</text>
  <text start="421.02" dur="3.45">iceberg but those are the people that</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="4.92">want to take over this country and we</text>

  <text start="589.35" dur="3.63">interesting because kolomoiskiy Bank</text>
  <text start="591.269" dur="4.591">which was obviously like I said taken</text>
  <text start="592.98" dur="5.25">over by the state later revealed was a</text>

  <text start="598.23" dur="5.28">the IMF and it&amp;#39;s believed that those</text>
  <text start="601.56" dur="3">funds were looted but the question is at</text>
  <text start="603.51" dur="2.519">the end of this article which I think is</text>
  <text start="604.56" dur="2.82">important where are the billions of</text>
  <text start="606.029" dur="4.11">dollars that went missing in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="607.38" dur="4.41">what do oh by Obama Biden and Kerry and</text>
  <text start="610.139" dur="4.14">their children know about where that</text>
  <text start="611.79" dur="3.63">money is and are they connected so what</text>
  <text start="614.279" dur="2.61">have we talked about in queue here</text>
  <text start="615.42" dur="3.75">before we&amp;#39;ve talked about these major</text>
  <text start="616.889" dur="3.75">deals these international global deals</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="5.909">whether its climate change or or</text>
  <text start="620.639" dur="7.351">whatever you name it the the TPP or any</text>
  <text start="625.079" dur="5.671">of these global pacts trades what do</text>
  <text start="627.99" dur="8.43">they do they set up these unaccountable</text>
  <text start="630.75" dur="7.86">money slush funds which can ship money</text>
  <text start="636.42" dur="4.83">out of the United States out of the IMF</text>
  <text start="638.61" dur="6.029">to you know foreign countries where we</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="6.06">apparently have these huge rackets of</text>
  <text start="644.639" dur="4.981">influence which we then just apparently</text>
  <text start="647.31" dur="5.37">that not we but the corrupt Democrats</text>
  <text start="649.62" dur="4.92">and others corrupt rhinos and the rest</text>
  <text start="652.68" dur="6">they just funnel back into their own</text>
  <text start="654.54" dur="6.63">pockets so you wonder why our country</text>
  <text start="658.68" dur="5.31">was being sold out globally</text>
  <text start="661.17" dur="4.77">to China and to Ukraine until you name</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="3.57">it we were being sold out globally</text>
  <text start="665.94" dur="3.93">because the people running our country</text>
  <text start="667.56" dur="4.17">were basically just enriching themselves</text>
  <text start="669.87" dur="5.269">lining their own pockets with the money</text>
  <text start="671.73" dur="7.909">that was being laundered overseas</text>
  <text start="675.139" dur="5.981">allegedly so that&amp;#39;s one story right</text>
  <text start="679.639" dur="3.13">here&amp;#39;s another one</text>
  <text start="681.12" dur="3.75">Peter Schweitzer just came out and</text>
  <text start="682.769" dur="3.57">dropped the Biden corruption documents</text>
  <text start="684.87" dur="2.76">because you know the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="686.339" dur="3.961">trying to say oh there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="687.63" dur="6.98">with hunter Biden going and working in</text>
  <text start="690.3" dur="7.2">China and working in you know a Ukraine</text>
  <text start="694.61" dur="5.08">except in Peter Schweitzer&amp;#39;s own release</text>
  <text start="697.5" dur="5.04">here what he talks about is the book</text>
  <text start="699.69" dur="4.199">that he wrote secret empires and how it</text>
  <text start="702.54" dur="3.78">relates to what we&amp;#39;re looking at today</text>
  <text start="703.889" dur="3.781">with this whole hunter Biden thing so</text>
  <text start="706.32" dur="2.819">I&amp;#39;m gonna read the three key points from</text>
  <text start="707.67" dur="4.32">this release because I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="709.139" dur="4.38">worth sharing but it says the narrative</text>
  <text start="711.99" dur="3.48">suggesting the hunter Biden and his</text>
  <text start="713.519" dur="4.201">partner played only a passive role at</text>
  <text start="715.47" dur="3.989">the Chinese firm is simply false they</text>
  <text start="717.72" dur="3.39">show a document that shows on her Biden</text>

  <text start="728.82" dur="4.259">on the company&amp;#39;s investment committee</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="4.919">these are not merely advisory roles so</text>
  <text start="733.079" dur="5.101">the mainstream media&amp;#39;s twist is this now</text>
  <text start="735.269" dur="5.281">oh well you know they didn&amp;#39;t get a 1.5</text>
  <text start="738.18" dur="3.779">billion dollars from China they just got</text>
  <text start="740.55" dur="4.289">a few hundred thousand dollars no</text>
  <text start="741.959" dur="5.13">worries well that&amp;#39;s not true because</text>
  <text start="744.839" dur="3.391">even though they were only paid I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="747.089" dur="3.721">know a few hundred thousand or a few</text>

  <text start="750.81" dur="6.6">of an investment fund worth 1.5 billion</text>

  <text start="757.41" dur="4.739">this is hunter Biden and they don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="760.11" dur="3.839">about the other third partner which is</text>
  <text start="762.149" dur="3.781">so interesting nobody wants to mention</text>

  <text start="791.88" dur="4.799">about that too Biden defenders say</text>
  <text start="794.819" dur="3.81">Hunter did not receive a stake in BH r</text>

  <text start="878.939" dur="4.77">in China anyway I mean for them I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="882.149" dur="2.61">even know that they really realize that</text>
  <text start="883.709" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re doing something wrong because</text>
  <text start="884.759" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s so prevalent and common in China</text>
  <text start="886.739" dur="4.89">for corruption and and the communist</text>
  <text start="889.169" dur="3.87">leaders to take bribes so for them I</text>
  <text start="891.629" dur="3.841">think they&amp;#39;re just looking at this is a</text>
  <text start="893.039" dur="3.811">the way they do business but now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="3.509">turning around and saying this is not</text>
  <text start="896.85" dur="3.389">how you do business and we will not</text>
  <text start="898.979" dur="2.82">allow this to happen because if we allow</text>
  <text start="900.239" dur="2.79">trying to keep doing this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="901.799" dur="2.94">eventually going to do this with the</text>
  <text start="903.029" dur="3.03">rest of the world which they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="904.739" dur="3.75">started to do in many different</text>

  <text start="908.489" dur="5.1">incredible influence on other major</text>
  <text start="910.529" dur="6.8">nations as well so just thought I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="913.589" dur="6.42">bring that up interestingly enough</text>
  <text start="917.329" dur="4.99">tucker carlson on a show the other night</text>

  <text start="1872.39" dur="3.42">called to live a righteous life which</text>
  <text start="1873.68" dur="4.29">means we have to work hard every day to</text>
  <text start="1875.81" dur="4.77">be righteous to do unto others as we</text>
