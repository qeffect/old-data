  <text start="1012.17" dur="6">maybe billions and Q&amp;#39;s alluded to the</text>
  <text start="1015.14" dur="4.59">fact that although these organizations</text>
  <text start="1018.17" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m not going to say that they don&amp;#39;t do</text>

  <text start="1021.65" dur="4.53">very very misleading thing to say but</text>
  <text start="1024.589" dur="3.591">because there are so many good people</text>
  <text start="1026.18" dur="5.07">who work for these organizations who</text>
  <text start="1028.18" dur="6.13">genuinely are trying to help others and</text>
  <text start="1031.25" dur="5.04">they do there&amp;#39;s examples of you know</text>

  <text start="1051.71" dur="5.52">our society what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1053.96" dur="6.18">is the the corporate structure attached</text>
  <text start="1057.23" dur="5.1">to that that organization that</text>

  <text start="1062.33" dur="4.469">corporate structure has been corrupted</text>
  <text start="1064.22" dur="6.45">over the years and has been basically</text>
  <text start="1066.799" dur="6.571">co-opted and is used by very bad people</text>
  <text start="1070.67" dur="6.15">to do things like funnel and launder</text>
  <text start="1073.37" dur="6.63">money you know a fun amount of money</text>
  <text start="1076.82" dur="7.099">globally avoiding certain tax law and</text>
  <text start="1080" dur="6.87">certain global restriction on just</text>
  <text start="1083.919" dur="4.241">banking laws and all of that and then at</text>
  <text start="1086.87" dur="3.09">the same time how it was used to</text>
  <text start="1088.16" dur="5.55">actually launder certain money that may</text>
  <text start="1089.96" dur="5.64">have been used in for instance the money</text>
  <text start="1093.71" dur="4.26">might be being used for child</text>
  <text start="1095.6" dur="4.92">trafficking I mean if it&amp;#39;s black money</text>
  <text start="1097.97" dur="4.829">that&amp;#39;s being laundered meaning dark</text>
  <text start="1100.52" dur="5.55">money meaning nobody knows about it</text>
  <text start="1102.799" dur="4.351">then you have a serious problem and QS</text>
  <text start="1106.07" dur="3.57">brought this to our attention before</text>

  <text start="1546.36" dur="4.89">story don&amp;#39;t forget there were three more</text>
  <text start="1548.91" dur="4.14">troops arrested recently and it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1551.25" dur="4.11">keep Pendleton as part of the original</text>

  <text start="1580.289" dur="4.35">so you know there&amp;#39;s a lot more to this</text>
  <text start="1582.869" dur="4.351">than I think meets the eye and I&amp;#39;d love</text>
  <text start="1584.639" dur="6.03">to hear your take down in the comments</text>
  <text start="1587.22" dur="8.339">so one more thing before we go a pretty</text>
  <text start="1590.669" dur="6.45">pretty disturbing trend here the new</text>
  <text start="1595.559" dur="5.7">thing they&amp;#39;re trying to say is that</text>
  <text start="1597.119" dur="6.3">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s Christian nationalism so</text>
  <text start="1601.259" dur="4.11">now they&amp;#39;re trying to first it was white</text>
  <text start="1603.419" dur="3.75">nationalism now it&amp;#39;s Christian</text>
  <text start="1605.369" dur="3.601">nationalism so now we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1607.169" dur="4.1">actually coming after Christians and</text>
  <text start="1608.97" dur="5.639">this is a supposed Christian group of</text>
  <text start="1611.269" dur="6.49">some multi-denominational you know</text>
  <text start="1614.609" dur="6.121">globalist I&amp;#39;m sure leaning group liberal</text>
  <text start="1617.759" dur="5.191">group saying that we have to combat the</text>
  <text start="1620.73" dur="4.889">rise of Christian nationalism well this</text>
  <text start="1622.95" dur="4.829">is an attack on on my religion our</text>
  <text start="1625.619" dur="4.16">religion I would say more broadly and</text>
  <text start="1627.779" dur="5.701">and I think that these people are just</text>
  <text start="1629.779" dur="5.71">willful ignorant willfully ignorant when</text>
  <text start="1633.48" dur="4.139">it comes to this and they just want the</text>
  <text start="1635.489" dur="3.78">attention and they want to you know</text>
  <text start="1637.619" dur="3.87">virtue signal that they are fighting</text>
  <text start="1639.269" dur="3.691">against white nationalism but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1641.489" dur="3.06">gonna now identify as Christian</text>
  <text start="1642.96" dur="3.569">nationalism because they&amp;#39;re better</text>
  <text start="1644.549" dur="4.83">Christians than than others and I think</text>
  <text start="1646.529" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s really pretty much the opposite</text>
  <text start="1649.379" dur="4.92">of what Christianity teaches us so you</text>
  <text start="1651.899" dur="3.66">know take it with a grain of salt just</text>
