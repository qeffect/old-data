  <text start="301.259" dur="3.87">here is is talking about how extremely</text>
  <text start="304.259" dur="4.53">guarded and highly classified</text>

  <text start="337.8" dur="4.679">over the subpoenaed documents they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="4.02">gonna expose things like what was</text>
  <text start="342.479" dur="4.351">happening at the department justice in</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="6.269">the FBI during all of this Clinton or</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="4.47">all of this Trump and spine we&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="350.099" dur="3.211">know they&amp;#39;re putting moles into the</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="5.39">Trump campaign they&amp;#39;re doing all of</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="8.039">these seedy actions spying on him</text>
  <text start="356.69" dur="7.689">wiretapping his his his tower Trump</text>
  <text start="361.349" dur="5.25">Tower this is all very unacceptable but</text>
  <text start="364.379" dur="4.171">it was also being used allegedly to</text>
  <text start="366.599" dur="5.461">support the Hillary Clinton campaign so</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="6.149">it supports to support the Clinton the</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="4.079">adversarial campaign because they wanted</text>
  <text start="374.699" dur="4.321">the deep state to stay in power and they</text>
  <text start="376.139" dur="4.83">didn&amp;#39;t want anybody else to be in</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="5.609">control so that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s referring</text>
  <text start="380.969" dur="6.151">to but then could this also be a double</text>
  <text start="384.629" dur="4.081">entendre here meaning the JFK files have</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="4.65">been given a green light to be released</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="5.22">now if you look at what the news reports</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="5.189">about the JFK disclosure they basically</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="5.12">say Trump delays it and the deadlines</text>
  <text start="396.959" dur="4.64">2021 now and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s backing from his promises and you</text>
  <text start="401.599" dur="3.991">know you can see all these articles and</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s another thing I have a feeling I</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="4.979">kind of went off on how bad Google is as</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="4.169">a search engine and how DuckDuckGo is</text>
  <text start="410.569" dur="4.59">much better so we&amp;#39;ll see if that had</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="5.22">something to do with my video just being</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="4.651">garbled with a weird static noises that</text>
  <text start="417.949" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;ve never had on any of my other videos</text>
  <text start="419.81" dur="4.43">I&amp;#39;m just throwing ideas out there</text>
  <text start="421.699" dur="4.951">because I have no idea how that happened</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="4.75">and we&amp;#39;ll see if this video turns out</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="6.62">that way I hope not because obviously</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="7.019">then I will have to redo it again but</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="5.47">this is just incredible you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.009" dur="4.41">you come on here and it scares me</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="3.269">or worries me I guess would be more</text>
  <text start="440.419" dur="3.3">appropriate to say that you go in the</text>
  <text start="442.009" dur="3.21">news tab here on Google and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="443.719" dur="3.901">saying for me I can go to DuckDuckGo I</text>
  <text start="445.219" dur="3.69">know better but the public the millions</text>
  <text start="447.62" dur="3.06">and millions and millions of people out</text>
  <text start="448.909" dur="3.391">there they just type into Google and</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="3.84">trust Google and then Google gives you</text>

  <text start="468.409" dur="7.341">the the true story when they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="472.729" dur="7.081">completely blanking out an entire</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="6.43">opposing dissenting side to each of</text>
  <text start="479.81" dur="5.729">these stories by basically putting out</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="5.639">this disinformation propaganda from CNN</text>

  <text start="569.75" dur="3.9">agencies to review each of those</text>

  <text start="587.15" dur="5.28">what they miss in his little speech here</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="5.28">we it basically says that the archivist</text>
  <text start="592.43" dur="5.03">has recommended that rude actions remain</text>
  <text start="594.44" dur="6.96">in place until 2021 for further review</text>
  <text start="597.46" dur="7.03">what he&amp;#39;s saying is okay well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="601.4" dur="6.03">fine but during that time in those three</text>
  <text start="604.49" dur="5.93">years documents will be released as they</text>
  <text start="607.43" dur="6.06">are it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s found out that their</text>
  <text start="610.42" dur="5.23">classifications are basically</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="5.67">unnecessary and they don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="4.26">held anymore I think that to my personal</text>
  <text start="619.16" dur="3.54">opinions that they&amp;#39;re waiting for</text>
  <text start="619.91" dur="6.11">certain people to pass away especially</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="9.09">certain very very important high-ranking</text>
  <text start="626.02" dur="9.45">top people like maybe the Bush&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.79" dur="6.18">possibly one of the older Bush Senior</text>
  <text start="635.47" dur="4.33">but that&amp;#39;s just my humble opinion I</text>
  <text start="637.97" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t know if that that&amp;#39;s speculative at</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="3.21">this point but that&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="641.72" dur="2.64">you have to read what people say you</text>
  <text start="643.01" dur="3.9">have to listen to the words they</text>
  <text start="644.36" dur="4.89">actually say because that&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="646.91" dur="3.96">most important thing so I think we all</text>
  <text start="649.25" dur="2.85">get it there&amp;#39;s a double entendre here</text>
  <text start="650.87" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s a double meaning the JFK</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="3.81">disclosure may have been authorized and</text>
  <text start="654.08" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s how Trump can do it it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="655.91" dur="3.27">like it&amp;#39;s impossible for him to release</text>
  <text start="657.35" dur="4.44">those and documents given his own words</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="6.36">and his own statement that he put out</text>
  <text start="661.79" dur="5.1">there and then also this whole</text>
  <text start="665.54" dur="3.63">investigation is going to blow</text>
  <text start="666.89" dur="3.75">with rod Rosenstein having to recuse</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="3.42">himself now we&amp;#39;re gonna go into what</text>
  <text start="670.64" dur="5.13">happens once rod Rosenstein ends up</text>
  <text start="672.59" dur="5.13">recusing himself so Q says rod resisting</text>
  <text start="675.77" dur="3.51">problems what what was rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="677.72" dur="3.21">Senate confirmation vote</text>
  <text start="679.28" dur="3.93">well roses things about confirmation it</text>
  <text start="680.93" dur="5.07">was like ninety four to six and the six</text>
  <text start="683.21" dur="9.21">dissent are the six nays were people</text>
  <text start="686" dur="11.61">like Cory Booker and five other you know</text>
  <text start="692.42" dur="7.74">liberal elitist people Kamala Harris and</text>
  <text start="697.61" dur="3.99">so on these people are really the out</text>
  <text start="700.16" dur="2.82">there and I think what the reason they</text>
  <text start="701.6" dur="4.25">didn&amp;#39;t want rod Rosenstein confirms</text>
  <text start="702.98" dur="5.46">because they knew how he was going to be</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="6.64">basically compromised in a later date I</text>
  <text start="708.44" dur="5.76">believe but then it says rate reports to</text>
  <text start="712.49" dur="2.76">rod Rosen seen that&amp;#39;s an important fact</text>
  <text start="714.2" dur="3">who do you trust</text>
  <text start="715.25" dur="3.63">well obviously we don&amp;#39;t trust rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="717.2" dur="3.9">see and obviously if rays reporting to</text>
  <text start="718.88" dur="3.39">him we would like to have that change so</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="4.83">that there&amp;#39;s somebody he can report to</text>
  <text start="722.27" dur="6.95">who&amp;#39;s actually a trustworthy Attorney</text>
  <text start="725.93" dur="7.14">General or oversee overseer of the</text>
  <text start="729.22" dur="6.13">Mueller investigation then it says rod</text>
  <text start="733.07" dur="3.78">Rhodes have seen recuse fired who has</text>
  <text start="735.35" dur="4.74">direct oversight of Mueller</text>
  <text start="736.85" dur="5.49">so the mule investigation</text>
  <text start="740.09" dur="4.62">if rod Rosen seems fired will either</text>
  <text start="742.34" dur="4.71">have to have sessions on recuse himself</text>
  <text start="744.71" dur="6.87">to oversee it or the number three would</text>
  <text start="747.05" dur="6.09">become the overseer of the Mueller</text>
  <text start="751.58" dur="4.83">investigation until the spot was</text>
  <text start="753.14" dur="6.9">refilled at the assistant or the Deputy</text>
  <text start="756.41" dur="5.04">Attorney General position but who is</text>
  <text start="760.04" dur="3.72">Rachel Brandt this is a great question</text>
  <text start="761.45" dur="4.11">why was Rachel Brand dismissed well</text>
  <text start="763.76" dur="3.36">Rachel Brand obviously somebody she was</text>
  <text start="765.56" dur="3.03">the number three at this state departed</text>
  <text start="767.12" dur="4.14">the Department of Justice and she</text>
  <text start="768.59" dur="4.68">stepped down back in February based on</text>
  <text start="771.26" dur="5.61">she just said she was taking too much</text>
  <text start="773.27" dur="6.51">heat from all of this stuff that was</text>
  <text start="776.87" dur="4.86">happening around her regarding Trump</text>
  <text start="779.78" dur="4.29">giving a hard time to the Department of</text>
  <text start="781.73" dur="3.51">Justice and that the situation was just</text>
  <text start="784.07" dur="2.85">too much for her to handle I think she</text>
  <text start="785.24" dur="3.15">works for like Walmart now but was</text>
  <text start="786.92" dur="4.83">pointed important in this article is</text>
  <text start="788.39" dur="4.77">actually it shows a quote from Jeff</text>
  <text start="791.75" dur="4.19">Sessions right here where he basically</text>
  <text start="793.16" dur="4.28">says the Department of</text>
  <text start="795.94" dur="3.45">Justice thanks her for a strong</text>
  <text start="797.44" dur="3.18">leadership that leadership has been</text>
  <text start="799.39" dur="3.06">especially strong with regard to</text>
  <text start="800.62" dur="3.87">fighting human trafficking and I want to</text>
  <text start="802.45" dur="4.53">thank you for taking up this important</text>
  <text start="804.49" dur="3.81">cause of making it your own so she was</text>
  <text start="806.98" dur="3.42">obviously working on human trafficking</text>
  <text start="808.3" dur="4.2">at the department or at the Department</text>
  <text start="810.4" dur="3.33">of Justice and there&amp;#39;s one of two ways</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="4.65">to interpret this statement from</text>
  <text start="813.73" dur="5.97">sessions one that she&amp;#39;s literally</text>
  <text start="817.15" dur="4.23">thanking her and that she was working to</text>
  <text start="819.7" dur="3.9">expose it and then the heat got too much</text>
  <text start="821.38" dur="4.2">for her and she had to leave or the more</text>
  <text start="823.6" dur="5.64">likely one in my opinion is that this is</text>
  <text start="825.58" dur="6.12">sessions giving her a basically a veiled</text>
  <text start="829.24" dur="4.11">statement of I know about your your work</text>
  <text start="831.7" dur="2.79">on human trafficking and we need to get</text>
  <text start="833.35" dur="3.45">you out of here because she was</text>
  <text start="834.49" dur="5.07">compromised and working for the evil</text>
  <text start="836.8" dur="5.22">globalist cabal so that&amp;#39;s my opinion I</text>
  <text start="839.56" dur="5.64">think that you know it&amp;#39;s obvious that</text>
  <text start="842.02" dur="5.31">you go back to the queue post where it</text>
  <text start="845.2" dur="4.56">actually says it I mean here is the</text>
  <text start="847.33" dur="4.95">queue post here and this is from May 4th</text>
  <text start="849.76" dur="4.1">that outlines exactly Rachel brands is</text>
  <text start="852.28" dur="3.78">Rachel Brand associate attorney general</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="4.33">number three official behind Deputy</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="4.83">Attorney Rosenstein fire force so she</text>
  <text start="858.19" dur="5.31">was not she didn&amp;#39;t resign of her own</text>
  <text start="860.89" dur="4.17">accord she was obviously forced out and</text>
  <text start="863.5" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s this dicover is that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.06" dur="3.81">resigning because of the heat I think</text>
  <text start="867.22" dur="4.2">the heat got too hot for her she is too</text>
  <text start="868.87" dur="4.2">much embedded with the globalist and she</text>
  <text start="871.42" dur="3.09">had to get out of there but that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="873.07" dur="4.26">humble opinion so you guys let me know</text>
  <text start="874.51" dur="5.94">what you think right and it says think</text>
  <text start="877.33" dur="5.25">timing now why is timing important to</text>
  <text start="880.45" dur="4.17">all this well this is really incredible</text>
  <text start="882.58" dur="4.95">I thought it great and Anton pointed</text>
  <text start="884.62" dur="6.06">this out if we look at this the post</text>
  <text start="887.53" dur="4.8">from May 13th right where Q says the</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="3.84">Democrats are slow walking POTUS federal</text>
  <text start="892.33" dur="4.74">judge nominations watch what happens -</text>
  <text start="894.52" dur="4.77">30 so that was - 30 days seven days</text>
  <text start="897.07" dur="4.23">later Q post this post where he acted</text>
  <text start="899.29" dur="4.17">where he purposefully it would seem</text>
  <text start="901.3" dur="4.5">exposes his password that goes with his</text>
  <text start="903.46" dur="4.38">trip code as an identifying marker on</text>
  <text start="905.8" dur="4.08">the a Chambord that he posts on like his</text>
  <text start="907.84" dur="6.63">login information and the password is</text>
  <text start="909.88" dur="7.5">now comes the pain - - - 23 now - - and</text>
  <text start="914.47" dur="6.75">Morse code can it means T so that could</text>
  <text start="917.38" dur="6.9">be in t minus 23 so we have - 30 days</text>
  <text start="921.22" dur="5.7">here and then - 23 days being told to us</text>
  <text start="924.28" dur="4.559">seven days later and then tomorrow is</text>
  <text start="926.92" dur="2.16">the 23rd so things could be happening</text>
  <text start="928.839" dur="2.191">then</text>
  <text start="929.08" dur="3.63">- but I think that the numbers here are</text>
  <text start="931.03" dur="3.3">really important to understand that in</text>
  <text start="932.71" dur="3.99">23 days something bigs gonna happen and</text>
  <text start="934.33" dur="5.76">what happens in 23 days is June 11th</text>
  <text start="936.7" dur="5.19">which is the North Korea summit it may</text>
  <text start="940.09" dur="5.91">or may not happen Trump said today even</text>
  <text start="941.89" dur="6.54">you know that there&amp;#39;s obviously some</text>
  <text start="946" dur="4.47">some issues going on where it may not</text>
  <text start="948.43" dur="4.8">actually come together and it may be</text>
  <text start="950.47" dur="4.41">delayed but let&amp;#39;s assume it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="953.23" dur="5.01">happen that day and I thought what a</text>
  <text start="954.88" dur="5.16">great way to announce when rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="958.24" dur="3.21">seeds gonna be fired so if rod Rosa</text>
  <text start="960.04" dur="3.3">Singh&amp;#39;s fired the day before the North</text>
  <text start="961.45" dur="6.57">Korea summit it gives the media almost</text>
  <text start="963.34" dur="7.11">no time or option to spin the story</text>
  <text start="968.02" dur="4.83">because they&amp;#39;ll be forced to cover the</text>
  <text start="970.45" dur="4.29">historic meeting between President Trump</text>
  <text start="972.85" dur="4.23">and the leader of North Korea which</text>
  <text start="974.74" dur="4.56">would give it would be a great way to</text>
  <text start="977.08" dur="4.8">get that story to keep that story from</text>
  <text start="979.3" dur="5.28">being used in the mainstream media as a</text>
  <text start="981.88" dur="4.47">weaponized because the what that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="984.58" dur="4.59">the mainstream media does they weaponize</text>
  <text start="986.35" dur="4.53">information and use it against people</text>
  <text start="989.17" dur="3.27">like Trump and Patriots who love our</text>
  <text start="990.88" dur="3.24">country we&amp;#39;re trying to fight for it</text>
  <text start="992.44" dur="3.48">they weaponize the information and use</text>
  <text start="994.12" dur="4.05">it as disinformation in propaganda and</text>
  <text start="995.92" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s all they are the Mockingbird</text>
  <text start="998.17" dur="4.86">press that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what they are so</text>
  <text start="1000.9" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s what that is I thought that was</text>
  <text start="1003.03" dur="3.57">interesting for the timing thing and it</text>
  <text start="1004.65" dur="3.12">says the succession question is a bit</text>
  <text start="1006.6" dur="6.41">complicated that we read through all</text>
  <text start="1007.77" dur="9.12">this but it&amp;#39;s saying that because um</text>
  <text start="1013.01" dur="6.82">Rachel Brand basically stepped down her</text>
  <text start="1016.89" dur="6.06">replacement this guy Jesse Pinoccio was</text>
  <text start="1019.83" dur="4.619">the acting associate attorney general he</text>

  <text start="1024.449" dur="5.521">charge of oversight but this also says</text>
  <text start="1026.16" dur="7.95">here that Trump can elect to nominate</text>

  <text start="1549.42" dur="5.25">power in this very important law and</text>
  <text start="1552.27" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s really important that we conduct</text>
