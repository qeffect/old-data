  <text start="54" dur="6.09">one number one number two well the I</text>
  <text start="57.66" dur="4.68">think what he&amp;#39;s referring to is the</text>
  <text start="60.09" dur="4.56">number one Robert Mueller the number one</text>
  <text start="62.34" dur="4.709">Robert or James Comey and the number two</text>
  <text start="64.65" dur="5.46">Andrew McCabe ok nikomia mccabe were</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="4.531">already fired and Mueller is actually</text>
  <text start="70.11" dur="5.34">running this whole Russia hoax</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="7.74">investigation so obviously their points</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="6.87">the fact that Q is very aware of where</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="6.81">where the corruption is right now plus</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="6.42">29 and 16 what I was able to put with</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="5.22">that is that there&amp;#39;s 29 other people in</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="4.68">the FBI they&amp;#39;ve actually been following</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="5.659">them monitoring them they have all their</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="7.68">information it people like stroke and</text>
  <text start="97.009" dur="8.831">others the the woman he was texting lisa</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="8.729">page and you know there&amp;#39;s 29 more and i</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="6.389">think of either of those 29 or outside</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="5.311">of those 29 16 of our i stepped down and</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="5.161">resigned as we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of FBI</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="5.49">agents resigned like i&amp;#39;ll show you right</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="5.13">now one happened recently so right here</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="5.129">you have just one example i think of</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="6.42">what q is referring to as the 29 or the</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="6.131">16 that have left the FBI voluntarily</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="5.95">now Comey actually writes to him</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="5.19">here and he says special agent Josh</text>
  <text start="134.89" dur="3.63">Campbell we missed the FBI but his voice</text>
  <text start="137.08" dur="4.32">was an important one then it goes into a</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="4.83">story about why he left I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="141.4" dur="4.68">about partisan attacks and how the</text>
  <text start="143.35" dur="8.34">bureau has been split but it&amp;#39;s all just</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="7.68">fake phony and false if you ask me and</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;ll just that&amp;#39;s my opinion but you</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="3.39">know you guys let me know what you think</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s interesting to look at what James</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="5.79">commis latest tweet has been which was</text>
  <text start="160.27" dur="5.64">directed at the president it says mr.</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="4.89">president the American people will hear</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="3.54">my story very soon and they can judge</text>
  <text start="167.83" dur="5.28">for themselves who is honorable and who</text>
  <text start="169.45" dur="6.63">is not well from what I can put together</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="5.7">I don&amp;#39;t think mr. Comey is an honorable</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="7.47">man and I don&amp;#39;t think that he was doing</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="7.5">anything besides committing basically</text>
  <text start="183.55" dur="5.55">crimes against our country of which he</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="5.1">was basically pardoned or let bled off</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="5.01">for with basically a slap on the wrist</text>
  <text start="191.41" dur="5.34">at this point and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into</text>
  <text start="194.11" dur="4.23">that with Q but very interesting now</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="4.709">he&amp;#39;s pointing at the president with his</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="4.89">tweets so that&amp;#39;s certainly something to</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="3.481">be looked at now the Department of</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="3.81">Justice again I think it&amp;#39;s the number</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="3.81">one the number two the number one the</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.919">number one the number two as in</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="7.35">referring to who were the number one so</text>
  <text start="211.959" dur="6.631">well the last two number ones were Eric</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="4.229">Holder and Loretta Lynch obviously we</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="3.989">know they&amp;#39;re they were bad actors not</text>
  <text start="220.329" dur="5.461">doing well and the two people acting</text>
  <text start="222.579" dur="8.371">before sessions you know Sally aides who</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="7.34">stepped in when Trump took over and and</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="7.319">at the end of the bomb administration</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="9.31">and Dana buente who also was replaced by</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="7.621">Jeff Sessions and you can see exactly</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="5.19">what that whole process looked like but</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="3.12">I think he&amp;#39;s more referring to these two</text>
  <text start="247.63" dur="4.02">plus Sally Yates</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="4.89">that would be my guess I&amp;#39;m not sure Dana</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="3.179">Bronte is the same level because he was</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="3.3">an intermittent</text>
  <text start="254.829" dur="3.811">he was acting but he&amp;#39;s like the third he</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="3.75">stepped in after Sally Yates stepped</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="3.57">down and then Jeff Sessions took up so I</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="3.42">think he&amp;#39;s referring to Eric Holder</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="4.2">Loretta Lynch and Sally Yates</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="3.69">okay and there&amp;#39;s 18 more in the</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="3.87">Department of Justice that need that</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="4.05">that are working against this country</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="3.81">against the Trump administration against</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="4.95">you and I the American people and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="5.49">unacceptable call your Congressman write</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="5.639">a letter blast them with emails and</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="5.16">memes and tweet them whatever you have</text>
  <text start="282.699" dur="3.811">to do we need to get these other 18 out</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="4.26">and you get all these other people out</text>
  <text start="286.51" dur="5.79">now the Department of State same exact</text>
  <text start="289" dur="9.18">thing okay who were the last well here</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="8.85">you have Andrew McCabe who was I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="4.95">this is still the FBI well let me pull</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="3.78">that up okay so I pulled it up and</text>
