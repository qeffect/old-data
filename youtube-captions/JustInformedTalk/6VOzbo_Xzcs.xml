  <text start="93.88" dur="3.96">click the big red subscribe button it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.71" dur="6.96">more important now than ever because you</text>
  <text start="97.84" dur="6.63">can see the Orwellian draconian systemic</text>
  <text start="102.67" dur="4.05">change is happening at Google and</text>
  <text start="104.47" dur="6.509">YouTube which are meant to suppress now</text>
  <text start="106.72" dur="6.3">in a wild turn of events apparently they</text>
  <text start="110.979" dur="3.241">originally wrote me an email saying that</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="2.31">we&amp;#39;re gonna take away the verified</text>
  <text start="114.22" dur="2.88">status of this channel</text>
  <text start="115.33" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve radically reversed that decision</text>
  <text start="117.1" dur="5.879">and decided to leave this channel is</text>
  <text start="119.8" dur="7.62">verified but they&amp;#39;ve still done other</text>
  <text start="122.979" dur="7.29">things that seem to be useful in trying</text>
  <text start="127.42" dur="6.33">to suppress channels ability to grow and</text>
  <text start="130.269" dur="5.311">a channels ability to prosper and to</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="3.66">reach as many people as as possible the</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="3.57">suppression is still happening here on</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="3.72">YouTube that&amp;#39;s for sure</text>
  <text start="139.15" dur="3.72">I always start though by saying check</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="4.38">out the Q boards here we are at Q post</text>
  <text start="142.87" dur="4.17">three five seven zero nothing new yet</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re waiting on the H Han Board to come</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="4.41">back and when that does we will have a</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="3.66">lot more so you guys are gonna have to</text>
  <text start="151.45" dur="4.02">stick around and wait for that but we</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="4.83">still have a lot happening in real time</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="4.53">including the White House and President</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="5.1">Trump giving us all types of signals</text>
  <text start="160" dur="4.68">that Q is still on and going the plan is</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="3.87">still up and running and we need to</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="3.48">continue to trust it plus we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="166.75" dur="3.9">talk about breaking news stories and a</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="4.859">bunch of other stuff including the Biden</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="3.75">chronicles now with that I always</text>
  <text start="173.019" dur="3.181">encourage everyone to come back here</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="3.36">landing page watch these last videos</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="4.68">share them on social media because like</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="5.88">I said YouTube is in the business of</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="5.609">suppression they write the the CEO Susan</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="5.969">Wojcicki literally writes blogs about</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="6.391">how she plans to suppress content that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.609" dur="5.13">not authoritarian our authoritative as</text>
  <text start="192.88" dur="5.07">or as I like to call authoritarian in</text>
  <text start="194.739" dur="5.041">its nature meaning if it&amp;#39;s not the fake</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="4.2">news you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to see</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="4.079">it they&amp;#39;re gonna continue to set their</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="3.03">algorithms to suppress content that</text>
  <text start="203.859" dur="4.831">comes from channels like this and others</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="5.01">so you guys should definitely share</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="3.93">these videos on your social media and</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="4.17">get the word out that way that helps out</text>
  <text start="212.62" dur="2.729">the channel big-time watch these videos</text>
  <text start="214.36" dur="2.519">and if you&amp;#39;re scratching a girl was</text>
  <text start="215.349" dur="2.64">killed on the great awakening watch this</text>
  <text start="216.879" dur="1.751">video it&amp;#39;ll give you all that</text>
  <text start="217.989" dur="2.831">information</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="6.45">plus a whole lot more so with that let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.82" dur="5.76">get into the first story this is a story</text>
  <text start="225.08" dur="3.81">that I missed unfortunately I was on the</text>
  <text start="226.58" dur="4.95">road I&amp;#39;ve been at the Q rally in</text>
  <text start="228.89" dur="5.19">Washington DC at the Washington Monument</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="4.05">and then I was in Rio Rancho New Mexico</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="3.54">for the Trump rally and now I&amp;#39;m finally</text>
  <text start="235.58" dur="4.5">back here catching up on the news this</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="4.17">was a huge story that I didn&amp;#39;t see while</text>
  <text start="240.08" dur="3.54">I was on the road but now looking at it</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="4.98">it tells us everything we need to know</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="5.19">mark zuckerberg at Congress the last few</text>
  <text start="246.77" dur="5.31">days why well perhaps it has something</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="5.33">to do with this their new pivot in</text>
  <text start="252.08" dur="5.219">strategy Wyatt what are they pivoting to</text>
  <text start="254.14" dur="6.46">well now they&amp;#39;re claiming that they</text>
  <text start="257.299" dur="5.221">deserve Facebook as a platform or as a</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="3.84">platform is not a platform it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="4.11">publisher and that they deserve First</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="4.23">Amendment protection especially from</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="4.71">this lawsuit Laurel Umar&amp;#39;s bringing</text>
  <text start="268.67" dur="5.82">against them for defamation and for</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="5.31">basically other things as outlined in</text>
  <text start="274.49" dur="3.81">the lawsuit itself but if you read the</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="3.93">actual lawsuit what I think is an</text>
  <text start="278.3" dur="5.46">important statement to consider here is</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="5.31">where they do admit their publishers so</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="4.53">it says third so the extent miss Liu</text>
  <text start="285.89" dur="4.2">MERS claims targets Facebook&amp;#39;s decision</text>
  <text start="288.29" dur="3.6">to deactivate her accounts that is also</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="4.26">deficient under well-established law and</text>
  <text start="291.89" dur="5.34">either Facebook nor any other publisher</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="4.47">can be liable for failing to publish</text>
  <text start="297.23" dur="2.82">someone else&amp;#39;s message the First</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="4.5">Amendment provides absolute protection</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="6.39">for such decisions now I have to ask the</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="4.98">question will this even hold water in a</text>
  <text start="306.44" dur="3.42">court of law can Facebook really pivot</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="4.44">and just say hey we&amp;#39;re actually a</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="4.53">publisher when at no point in their</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="3.63">previous existence have they done any</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="4.89">sort of real publishing I mean other</text>
  <text start="316.37" dur="4.8">people use their platform to publish</text>
  <text start="319.28" dur="4.5">their own personal content but because</text>
  <text start="321.17" dur="6">they&amp;#39;ve continued to slowly in a very</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="5.28">draconian Orwellian way change the the</text>
  <text start="327.17" dur="3.81">User Agreement change the terms and</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="3.84">conditions because they&amp;#39;ve done that</text>
  <text start="330.98" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;ve made it so that the content that</text>
  <text start="332.9" dur="3.65">you post on their platform basically</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="4.26">they own and they own everything</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="3.91">therefore they can call themselves a</text>
  <text start="338.81" dur="3.99">publisher now of course that comes with</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="3.93">the liabilities but so they lose the</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="3.9">section 230 liabilities but they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="344.39" dur="4.17">trillion dollar company who doesn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="346.7" dur="4.98">who has their own digital currency and</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="3.59">and and they look at you like slaves it</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="3.26">was</text>
  <text start="352.15" dur="4.829">concepted in and and made by the</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="4.77">Department of Advanced Research Projects</text>
  <text start="356.979" dur="4.44">Agency DARPA then handed to Mark</text>
  <text start="359.71" dur="3.959">Zuckerberg so that the public would</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="5.611">accept submitting themselves to the</text>
  <text start="363.669" dur="6.801">security nanny state so this to me is</text>
  <text start="367.03" dur="8.04">just another exercise in in an Orwellian</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="7.78">attempt to undermine freedom in society</text>
  <text start="375.07" dur="4.2">and also they they don&amp;#39;t care these you</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t understand I&amp;#39;ve said this a</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="3.84">million times they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="3.69">money they can care about controlling</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="4.2">the narrative they care about having the</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="4.17">ability to make an online platform that</text>
  <text start="387.31" dur="4.62">is social media that is so ubiquitous</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="6.15">across the globe with billions of users</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="5.1">that they can now once they have that</text>
  <text start="395.26" dur="3.39">platform they don&amp;#39;t care if they lose a</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="2.79">hundred million dollars a year or two</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="3.269">hundred million dollars a year or</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="3.87">whatever or a billion dollars a year you</text>
  <text start="401.919" dur="4.5">know why they don&amp;#39;t care because they</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="5.22">control information and that is so much</text>
  <text start="406.419" dur="4.411">more valuable meaning they can silence</text>
  <text start="408.91" dur="4.039">people they can remove your entire</text>
  <text start="410.83" dur="5.22">freedom of speech you are</text>
  <text start="412.949" dur="4.69">constitutionally have no rights on the</text>
  <text start="416.05" dur="4.049">internet when it comes to these big</text>
  <text start="417.639" dur="3.661">companies apparently apparently the Bill</text>
  <text start="420.099" dur="3.121">of Rights doesn&amp;#39;t apply the First</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="4.29">Amendment doesn&amp;#39;t apply none of it</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="3.919">applies no as a matter of fact the First</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="5.13">Amendment actually applies to the</text>
  <text start="427.139" dur="7.21">monolithic oligarchy of a corporation</text>
  <text start="430.72" dur="6.06">like Facebook which is in bed with all</text>
  <text start="434.349" dur="5.79">the other big tech companies to make</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="5.19">that oligarchy but they are actually the</text>
  <text start="440.139" dur="4.381">ones who get the First Amendment</text>
  <text start="441.97" dur="5.61">protection isn&amp;#39;t that great so they can</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="5.369">crush the single little man and they are</text>
  <text start="447.58" dur="4.47">protected by the Constitution in the</text>
  <text start="449.889" dur="6.271">First Amendment this is like straight</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="6.299">out of 1984 so all I know is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.16" dur="4.65">very dangerous what&amp;#39;s happening here and</text>
  <text start="458.349" dur="3.661">if nobody acts then we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="3">some problems which this would explain</text>
  <text start="462.01" dur="3.45">why President Trump had the meeting with</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="4.169">Mark Zuckerberg because if they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="465.46" dur="4.679">take this turn then we may have to break</text>
  <text start="467.979" dur="4.261">up Facebook and break up Google and</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="4.321">break up YouTube and break up all of</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="4.049">these big tech oligarchies which are</text>
  <text start="474.46" dur="3.989">monopolies they&amp;#39;re just multiple</text>
  <text start="476.289" dur="5.94">monopolies that are you know big</text>
  <text start="478.449" dur="7.171">racketeering exercises that are you know</text>
  <text start="482.229" dur="4.121">globally being executed so these people</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="3.79">are criminal</text>
  <text start="486.35" dur="4.59">speaking of criminals there are arrests</text>
  <text start="489.41" dur="3.96">happening every day so don&amp;#39;t forget that</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="4.38">Ohio child sex trafficking sting has</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="3.63">nabbed over a hundred people including a</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="3.03">church leader an ER doctor and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="497" dur="6.45">gonna get in details of the story but</text>
  <text start="498.35" dur="7.17">this is just another example of what we</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t see happening every day but there</text>
  <text start="505.52" dur="2.16">is stuff happening behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="507.17" dur="3.78">here</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s another fascinating story Kevin</text>
  <text start="510.95" dur="3.93">Spacey the same man who was just</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="5.37">recently accused of sexual misconduct</text>
  <text start="514.88" dur="6.36">and abuse who was also under trial for</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="5.88">that and was able to get off of the hook</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="5.1">for that apparently he&amp;#39;s one of his</text>
  <text start="524.45" dur="3.09">accusers has just mysteriously died and</text>
  <text start="526.34" dur="3.33">now there&amp;#39;s other stories talking about</text>
  <text start="527.54" dur="4.59">other people involved with Kevin Spacey</text>
  <text start="529.67" dur="4.17">mysteriously died so this is just the</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="3.48">story I wanted to cover briefly and to</text>
  <text start="533.84" dur="6.14">say that there are connections between</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="6.93">Kevin Spacey&amp;#39;s father and much bigger</text>
  <text start="539.98" dur="4.57">fish if you know what I mean so if</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="4.02">anybody wants to dig a little deeper on</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="4.14">that it&amp;#39;s an interesting rabbit hole to</text>
  <text start="546.56" dur="5.88">go down to look at Kevin Spacey and his</text>
  <text start="548.69" dur="7.47">father and their network of criminal</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="5.64">ties let&amp;#39;s just say so that is that now</text>
  <text start="556.16" dur="4.05">here&amp;#39;s a story that went completely</text>
  <text start="558.08" dur="4.17">ignored by the mainstream media of</text>
  <text start="560.21" dur="3.66">course why would they cover a story that</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="3.93">would expose their complicity and</text>
  <text start="563.87" dur="4.5">covering up one of the biggest scandals</text>
  <text start="566.18" dur="5.46">in American history where you have a</text>

  <text start="1370.27" dur="4.29">sleep CEO Biden will fail again so</text>
  <text start="1372.75" dur="3.64">president Trump&amp;#39;s calling it out for</text>
  <text start="1374.56" dur="3.9">what it is but like I said before Q</text>
  <text start="1376.39" dur="4.65">would say in my opinion this is</text>
  <text start="1378.46" dur="4.35">projection right they are accusing</text>
  <text start="1381.04" dur="3.84">president Trump of what they themselves</text>
  <text start="1382.81" dur="4.56">are guilty of which is insane because</text>
  <text start="1384.88" dur="4.14">that literal the premise to this whole</text>
  <text start="1387.37" dur="3.81">thing the whole whistleblower thing</text>
  <text start="1389.02" dur="6.24">which it has to blow up in their face at</text>
  <text start="1391.18" dur="6.99">this point as it obviously is is that he</text>
  <text start="1395.26" dur="4.68">this person indirectly through hearsay</text>
  <text start="1398.17" dur="3.96">heard from somebody else that president</text>
  <text start="1399.94" dur="5.82">from said asked the president Ukraine to</text>
  <text start="1402.13" dur="7.08">investigate the hunter Biden and this</text>
  <text start="1405.76" dur="5.52">whole firing of the prosecutor thing so</text>
  <text start="1409.21" dur="4.14">the scandal is that President Trump</text>
  <text start="1411.28" dur="4.43">wants to investigate the corruption</text>
  <text start="1413.35" dur="4.05">which we there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="1415.71" dur="4.78">circumstantial evidence to suggest</text>
  <text start="1417.4" dur="4.95">what&amp;#39;s happening I mean that&amp;#39;s the world</text>
  <text start="1420.49" dur="3.99">that we live in Gregg Jarrett came out</text>

  <text start="2021.019" dur="8.11">or to have excuse me have our actions</text>
  <text start="2024.499" dur="7.331">back our words so if we say yes or if we</text>
