  <text start="110.67" dur="3.449">incredible information I really have not</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="3.72">heard this anywhere else up to this</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="4.651">point I knew that they had continued to</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="6.75">work at the FBI Peter stroke and Lisa</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="6.57">Paige and Bill pre step but I never</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="3.899">would have imagined that they had been</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="3.27">turned into cooperating witnesses or it</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="4.201">just never occurred to me it seems so</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="4.35">obvious now but that&amp;#39;s what Q is telling</text>
  <text start="131.28" dur="3.24">us and</text>
  <text start="132.96" dur="4.68">incredible so they got rid of Jim</text>
  <text start="134.52" dur="5.28">Rebecca Jim Baker Andrew Andy McCabe Jim</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="5.7">Comey got rid all those guys because</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="6.9">they were obviously deep state hardcore</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="5.13">and they&amp;#39;re the ones who were part of</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="4.08">the Cabal basically the lower levels</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="5.97">running the smaller organizations in</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="5.61">order to basically subvert our democracy</text>
  <text start="154.44" dur="4.02">and subvert our nation&amp;#39;s top law</text>
  <text start="156.39" dur="5.88">enforcement agency from within it was a</text>
  <text start="158.46" dur="5.34">team allegedly so but what cues telling</text>
  <text start="162.27" dur="4.23">us is that an if Peter stroke you</text>
  <text start="163.8" dur="5.13">imagine the level at the investigation</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="4.41">he was in where he was pretty much in</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="4.2">charge of the investigation to a degree</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="4.47">into the Hillary Clinton email servers</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="4.04">and into general Flynn when he went in</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="5.61">interviewed him and ended up</text>
  <text start="177.17" dur="6.37">manufacturing a false 302 I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="180.99" dur="4.5">form where you know if you don&amp;#39;t if you</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="5.73">lie the FBI you can be charged for lying</text>
  <text start="185.49" dur="5.79">the FBI this is all alleged but this is</text>
  <text start="189.27" dur="5.76">what the story has been up to this point</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="6.93">now Peter stroke if he and Lisa Paige</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="4.77">turn state that is incredible because</text>
  <text start="198.21" dur="3.15">you can only imagine the kind of</text>
  <text start="199.8" dur="3">information they have now again if you</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="2.97">guys are interested I just want to bring</text>
  <text start="202.8" dur="3.3">something really quickly if you want to</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="3.57">go back and see what these last few</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="4.11">posts are about and even going back</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="4.68">further just go ahead and come here to</text>
  <text start="210.21" dur="4.32">this page and watch the last video or</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="4.35">the last couple videos I think all of</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="3.9">these videos have a lot in them I mean</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="3.54">you can go basically through the whole</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="4.17">list and catch up however far back you</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="4.62">want to go and catch up to a rat but</text>
  <text start="222.6" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s totally up to you guys and I try</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="3.15">to bring this information fresh every</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.32">day this is the new stuff that we got</text>
  <text start="228.24" dur="4.01">right here so jumping back to the cue</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="3.51">board</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="4.57">Lisa page and Peter stroke and have a</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="4.5">wealth of information now just examining</text>
  <text start="236.82" dur="4.11">their texts right here&amp;#39;s a Fox News</text>
  <text start="238.89" dur="7.29">article were kind of just broadly</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="6.93">explains what happened in it broadly</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="3.75">explains what the Peter stroke and lisa</text>
  <text start="247.86" dur="3.9">page tax controversy is about now this</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="3.42">text controversy does not include</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="3.54">certain things see they want to continue</text>
  <text start="253.35" dur="3.18">to talk about the text messages but</text>
  <text start="255.3" dur="2.91">something we have to remember when we</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="2.91">mentioned this in previous video so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.21" dur="3.3">definitely good to go back and watch</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="5.46">those but I&amp;#39;m gonna reiterate this that</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s other ways that they transferred</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="3.27">information</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="3.96">meaning there was this thing they used</text>
  <text start="268.17" dur="4.11">as a dead drop a gmail account it would</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="4.02">appear and this dead drop gmail account</text>
  <text start="272.28" dur="4.38">could&amp;#39;ve been used by anybody even up to</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="6.78">the highest level to Hussein Barack</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="5.34">Hussein so you guys out there be the</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="3.33">judge for yourself this is just the</text>
  <text start="282" dur="4.19">alleged information at the moment but it</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="5.64">would appear that allegedly there is a</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="5.56">dead drop gmail account where now</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="4.77">imagine that how would that work well</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="4.77">instead of emailing nothing was actually</text>
  <text start="294.51" dur="3.93">emailed so what you do is you create a</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="5.01">gmail account you share that password</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="4.26">and login information with others you</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="3.51">know anybody you want to share messages</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="4.65">with and you go into the account you can</text>
  <text start="305.04" dur="5.39">write an email everybody who uses Gmail</text>
  <text start="307.35" dur="6.69">knows it saves that as a draft and then</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="5.14">once you go in then other people can</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="2.73">come in and read that draft and leave</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="2.73">their own drafts and then they can</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="4.95">communicate through drafts and it</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="4.92">basically stores on the cloud and they</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="3.48">were stupid that&amp;#39;s how stupid they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.22" dur="5.73">they didn&amp;#39;t realize the NSA can just go</text>
  <text start="325.2" dur="6.2">beep and pull it up in two seconds hope</text>
  <text start="328.95" dur="6.33">you guys like my computer sound effects</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="6.64">but that&amp;#39;s what they can do and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="4.92">what they did do obviously because these</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="3.51">people they&amp;#39;re criminals plotting</text>
  <text start="340.2" dur="3.63">against the president the united states</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="4.59">there are patriots in our government</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="4.23">many many more patriots than scumbags</text>
  <text start="346.14" dur="4.26">and it would seem that the Patriots in</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="3.99">our government identified this very</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="2.58">quickly and went oh we should probably</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="2.82">take care of that</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="5.04">we should probably not have the FBI</text>
  <text start="354.87" dur="6.42">being ran by a bunch of criminals that</text>
  <text start="358.02" dur="5.4">probably is a good idea for the overall</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="4.17">integrity of the justice system at large</text>
  <text start="363.42" dur="4.44">that needs to serve the entire country</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="4.17">not just the political elites in</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="7.26">Washington who are being controlled by a</text>
  <text start="369.63" dur="7.92">globalist cabal ok so enough ranting but</text>
  <text start="375.12" dur="4.62">the Peter stroke and Lisa page they have</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="5.07">all these text messages and you know you</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="5.01">read through them and according to the</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="4.11">the text messages stroke was hesitant to</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="3.93">join Mueller&amp;#39;s investigation because of</text>
  <text start="386.73" dur="3.9">his gut sense that there was no their</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="4.25">big there there yeah there was no there</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="2.3">there</text>
  <text start="395.63" dur="14.64">Texters talked about how the last thing</text>
  <text start="402.89" dur="10.77">you need is now I&amp;#39;m sorry let me read</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="6.36">that in context says page page warn</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="4.14">stroke via text about the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.63" dur="3.06">investigation into Clinton&amp;#39;s use of</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="3.72">private email server during its her</text>
  <text start="419.69" dur="4.14">tenure as Secretary of State saying in</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="4.29">February 2016 that she might be our next</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="4.02">president the last thing you need is</text>
  <text start="425.81" dur="4.05">going in there loaded for bear page</text>
  <text start="427.85" dur="4.71">continued you think she&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="6.21">remember or care that it was more DOJ</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="5.07">than FBI they&amp;#39;re all colluding that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="4.41">the point that the whole point here and</text>
  <text start="437.63" dur="5.22">then talking about McCabe right and it</text>
  <text start="440.48" dur="5.34">says a controversial figure in McCabe</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="4.92">was referenced in one of the texts here</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="3.57">where it says quote I want to believe</text>
  <text start="447.77" dur="4.05">the path you threw out for consideration</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="4.47">in Andy&amp;#39;s office that there&amp;#39;s no way he</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="6.84">gets elected but I&amp;#39;m afraid we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="6.15">take that risk so it why our FBI agents</text>
  <text start="458.66" dur="2.76">talking about not being able take risks</text>
  <text start="460.01" dur="3.33">and then they go on and say it&amp;#39;s like an</text>
  <text start="461.42" dur="3.3">insurance policy in the unlikely event</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="5.24">you die before you&amp;#39;re 40</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="8.16">why are unelected bureaucrats at the FBI</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="6.4">discussing the fact that they can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="5.88">the risk that a president is</text>
  <text start="474.98" dur="7.2">democratically elected how treasonous</text>
  <text start="478.76" dur="7.29">how criminal I mean how much more</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="5.85">criminal can you get it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s at very</text>
  <text start="486.05" dur="4.53">least the most unpatriotic thing I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="8.61">ever heard of at at worst criminal</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="8.28">offense okay so you know this is what</text>
  <text start="496.64" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re dealing with here and QS talking</text>
  <text start="498.86" dur="2.7">about how these people are the</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="3.9">cooperating witnesses now so and they</text>
  <text start="501.56" dur="3.93">even make mention in once text talking</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="3.48">about a secret society but here the</text>
  <text start="505.49" dur="5.16">later the newer text that just came out</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="5.97">and it&amp;#39;s talking about how the text</text>
  <text start="510.65" dur="4.53">reveal a frustration and a scramble</text>
  <text start="513.41" dur="3.629">after call me firing because they were</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="5.18">dying down there now apparently call me</text>
  <text start="517.039" dur="3.321">was like their their little</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="5.491">Oh Lord or whatever at the FBI who they</text>
  <text start="524.6" dur="4.489">wanted to follow into a new generation</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="6.419">is you go down and read some of these up</text>
  <text start="529.089" dur="8.531">texts and it&amp;#39;s stroke saying I&amp;#39;m dying</text>
  <text start="533.329" dur="8.07">down here now this is now more than ever</text>
  <text start="537.62" dur="5.49">this is an important critical time and</text>
  <text start="541.399" dur="4.68">we need to open the case we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="543.11" dur="4.32">waiting on now while Andy is acting so</text>
  <text start="546.079" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re talking about how they need to</text>
  <text start="547.43" dur="6.05">get things going while Andy could be</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="4.26">Andrew McCabe is still the FBI director</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="3.58">now they don&amp;#39;t know what case are</text>
  <text start="555.44" dur="4.709">referring to obviously talking about the</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="5.07">case into whoever you know at this point</text>
  <text start="560.149" dur="3.87">Michael Cohen to go rate him I mean but</text>
  <text start="562.13" dur="6.079">at this point let me know that happened</text>
  <text start="564.019" dur="7.291">after I believe but still any anything</text>
  <text start="568.209" dur="6.641">before that while he was still in office</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="8.459">is definitely under suspicion at this</text>
  <text start="574.85" dur="6.27">point it says now they redacted this is</text>
  <text start="579.769" dur="2.641">the redacted version and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="581.12" dur="4.26">these things where they say we need to</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="6.539">lock in blank in a formal chargeable way</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="5.28">soon is that Trump did they redact that</text>
  <text start="588.949" dur="5.63">because it&amp;#39;s Trump or is it because it</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="6.299">says Flynn or because it says who knows</text>
  <text start="594.579" dur="4.091">but it&amp;#39;s redacted right now can you</text>
  <text start="596.959" dur="3.63">imagine if they&amp;#39;re saying we need to</text>
  <text start="598.67" dur="4.56">lock in Trump and a formal chargeable</text>
  <text start="600.589" dur="4.051">way soon before you know even the</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="4.02">evidence is in we need to find evidence</text>
  <text start="604.64" dur="3.509">if we can&amp;#39;t find it we&amp;#39;ll make it up now</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="4.98">here&amp;#39;s the one they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
