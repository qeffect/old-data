  <text start="0.4" dur="4.47">on this episode of just inform talked</text>
  <text start="2.68" dur="4.5">the bombshell testimony that has been</text>
  <text start="4.87" dur="5.04">given by tom Fitton on Capitol Hill I</text>
  <text start="7.18" dur="6.439">have all the highlights and here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="9.91" dur="3.709">little taste of what is to come</text>
  <text start="17.47" dur="13.5">there is a potential conflict of</text>
  <text start="20.019" dur="12.361">interest between the charitable hey guys</text>
  <text start="30.97" dur="2.76">so before we get started with this video</text>
  <text start="32.38" dur="3.36">I want to take a quick second a look at</text>
  <text start="33.73" dur="3.96">this article from the hacker news.com</text>
  <text start="35.74" dur="3.27">and it talks about Google Plus have them</text>
  <text start="37.69" dur="3.78">shut down early because of another</text>
  <text start="39.01" dur="5.4">massive data breach which exposed the</text>
  <text start="41.47" dur="4.89">information of 50 2.5 million users</text>
  <text start="44.41" dur="4.17">which begs the question is your</text>
  <text start="46.36" dur="2.79">information private and safe on the</text>
  <text start="48.58" dur="3.09">Internet</text>
  <text start="49.15" dur="3.72">well for the most part usually not and</text>
  <text start="51.67" dur="2.97">most companies are using that</text>
  <text start="52.87" dur="4.65">information to track your every move and</text>
  <text start="54.64" dur="5.28">everything you do say by whatever well</text>
  <text start="57.52" dur="4.47">there is a solution for this and this</text>
  <text start="59.92" dur="3.6">problem is solved by something called a</text>
  <text start="61.99" dur="4.11">virtual private network and in this</text>
  <text start="63.52" dur="4.2">company a virtual shield has an</text>
  <text start="66.1" dur="2.91">incredible product that I want to share</text>
  <text start="67.72" dur="3.33">with you today I&amp;#39;m teaming up with them</text>
  <text start="69.01" dur="5.73">to bring you this great opportunity to</text>
  <text start="71.05" dur="5.79">get your own privacy back on the</text>
  <text start="74.74" dur="4.62">Internet and let me show you how this</text>
  <text start="76.84" dur="4.92">product works so quite simply Pope</text>
  <text start="79.36" dur="4.049">instead of telling you what a VPN is and</text>
  <text start="81.76" dur="4.02">you know telling you how it works I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="83.409" dur="4.711">gonna show you so look this is my actual</text>
  <text start="85.78" dur="4.41">IP address now a lot of this is blurred</text>
  <text start="88.12" dur="4.74">out for my own safety and security but</text>
  <text start="90.19" dur="4.35">um if you just go to Google and you put</text>
  <text start="92.86" dur="3">your public IP address it&amp;#39;ll pull it</text>
  <text start="94.54" dur="3.03">right up now let me show you what</text>
  <text start="95.86" dur="5.28">happens when I turn on my virtual</text>
  <text start="97.57" dur="5.76">private network voila there you go see</text>
  <text start="101.14" dur="5.31">now I have a totally new public IP</text>
  <text start="103.33" dur="4.98">address which actually disallows the big</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="4.14">tech companies from being able to track</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="4.14">your every movement so I&amp;#39;m actually</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="4.08">asking everyone to go check out virtual</text>
  <text start="112.45" dur="4.38">shield comm because in my opinion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="114.67" dur="4.77">one of the easiest VPNs in the world to</text>
  <text start="116.83" dur="4.17">use I just basically downloaded it and</text>
  <text start="119.44" dur="3.3">it runs in the background you don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="121" dur="3.75">have to do anything it&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="122.74" dur="3.69">fastest VPNs a lot of them have a huge</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="3">lag and that&amp;#39;s really unfortunate</text>
  <text start="126.43" dur="3.179">because you have to go through a server</text>
  <text start="127.75" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s somewhere else and then that</text>
  <text start="129.609" dur="4.291">takes time and they have this no log</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="3.089">policy</text>
  <text start="133.9" dur="3.419">which protects its users from any data</text>
  <text start="135.819" dur="3.48">breaches meaning they don&amp;#39;t keep any</text>
  <text start="137.319" dur="4.28">logs on where you go or what you do so</text>
  <text start="139.299" dur="4.951">it&amp;#39;s a great way to basically try to</text>
  <text start="141.599" dur="5.17">keep your privacy while you&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="4.079">internet so if you guys want to go check</text>

  <text start="155.22" dur="4.96">allow you the customer the ability to</text>
  <text start="158.349" dur="4.11">block off computer microphone and camera</text>
  <text start="160.18" dur="4.229">access from any unwanted spies or</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="3.84">hackers now that&amp;#39;s a game-changer for me</text>
  <text start="164.409" dur="3.841">because you know I&amp;#39;m putting tape on all</text>
  <text start="166.299" dur="3.66">the the cameras on my computer but they</text>

  <text start="211.659" dur="2.72">come under scrutiny for allegations of</text>
  <text start="213.669" dur="2.94">pay-to-play</text>

  <text start="230.31" dur="4.72">activities this subcommittee will also</text>
  <text start="233.409" dur="3.3">hear testimony from whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="235.03" dur="4.23">alleging the abuse of the charitable</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="5.011">organizations status by the Clinton</text>
  <text start="239.26" dur="4.53">Foundation and just recently the Clinton</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="4.47">Foundation was back in the news due to a</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="6.539">sharp decrease in donations for fiscal</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="7.019">year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 the</text>
  <text start="250.329" dur="6.241">donations to the foundation were 63</text>
  <text start="253.209" dur="6.21">million in 2016 and only twenty six</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="5.7">point six million in 2017 this</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="4.771">represents a 58% decrease in the span of</text>
  <text start="262.27" dur="4.29">one fiscal year and corresponds with</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="2.94">obviously secretary Clinton&amp;#39;s loss in</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="2.79">the two</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="4.26">presidential election now several</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="5.15">reports suggest that the decrease in</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="6.05">donations could reflect a pay-to-play</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="6.49">activity in the years prior to the</text>
  <text start="277.44" dur="6.34">decline in donations the numerous</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="4.79">pay-to-play reports and allegations has</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="4.92">led Congress to call for a special</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="6.22">prosecutor to investigate the Clinton</text>
  <text start="288.7" dur="6.15">Foundation in response former attorney</text>
  <text start="292" dur="5.52">general sessions appointed US Attorney</text>
  <text start="294.85" dur="4.77">John Huber to empower to investigate the</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="6.6">alleged wrongdoings by the Clinton</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="7.59">Foundation mr. Huber was joined DOJ has</text>
  <text start="304.12" dur="5.82">been unwilling to make him available I</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="4.56">find this not only frustrating for me</text>
  <text start="309.94" dur="4.56">but frustrating for the American people</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="5.49">if indeed a special prosecutor was not</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="6.12">appointed mr. Huber was supposed to take</text>
  <text start="317.26" dur="5.85">that role then why indeed has have we</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="6.96">not heard from him publicly in almost</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="8.61">nine months and so sadly we will look at</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="7.32">his loss of testimony today is perhaps</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="6.84">an indictment on his inability to</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="6.33">provide transparent oversight testimony</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="5.99">before this committee now the IRS was</text>
  <text start="341.23" dur="7.65">also scheduled to attend for this 501c3</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="8.38">registration oversight and the potential</text>
  <text start="348.88" dur="6.45">claims of the whistleblowers and sadly</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="5.96">mr. Horton was unable to attend due to a</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="6.06">death in his family this is certainly</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="4.42">recognized as a legitimate can see the</text>
  <text start="361.39" dur="3.54">excuse and my thoughts and prayers go</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="3.96">out to him and his family in this tough</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="5.31">time but we do have with us today Tom</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="5.16">Fenton a president of Judicial Watch who</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="4.26">will be testifying here today about the</text>
  <text start="372.43" dur="4.59">body of work that he is conducting as it</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="4.94">relates to the use of Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="5.16">is a vehicle for pay-to-play</text>

  <text start="1024" dur="4.709">McCabe told us the IG that the</text>

  <text start="1042.6" dur="4.44">know since then supposedly there&amp;#39;s been</text>

  <text start="1050.25" dur="3.36">Department well I would agree that that</text>
  <text start="1051.87" dur="3.36">was a very dramatic conversation a</text>
  <text start="1053.61" dur="4.05">McCabe said as you as you mentioned</text>
  <text start="1055.23" dur="5.58">there that had never had a conversation</text>
  <text start="1057.66" dur="4.86">like this as in his career at the FBI do</text>
  <text start="1060.81" dur="5.16">you believe that this demonstrates that</text>
  <text start="1062.52" dur="5.7">the Justice Department was actively</text>
  <text start="1065.97" dur="5.22">trying to protect Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="1068.22" dur="5.36">from an FBI investigation yeah it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1071.19" dur="4.38">one of I think a few pieces of evidence</text>
  <text start="1073.58" dur="3.37">demonstrating that the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1075.57" dur="3.45">Foundation was being protected by the</text>
  <text start="1076.95" dur="4.26">Justice Department especially during</text>
  <text start="1079.02" dur="3.87">that election year these pay-to-play</text>
  <text start="1081.21" dur="4.08">allegations for instance that we</text>
  <text start="1082.89" dur="3.78">uncovered these emails they came out in</text>
  <text start="1085.29" dur="2.76">August of 2016</text>
  <text start="1086.67" dur="3.24">not that we timed them to come out in</text>
  <text start="1088.05" dur="4.08">August 2016 that was a result of the</text>
  <text start="1089.91" dur="4.29">Justice Department taking you know eight</text>
  <text start="1092.13" dur="3.42">nine months it released them to us once</text>
  <text start="1094.2" dur="2.88">in or the State Department taking eight</text>
  <text start="1095.55" dur="3.51">nine months to really send to us after</text>
  <text start="1097.08" dur="4.8">they received them from Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1099.06" dur="5.58">and Miss Abidine but so this is a very</text>
  <text start="1101.88" dur="5.1">tricky time period and so I can imagine</text>
  <text start="1104.64" dur="4.47">it was pressure on the FBI just so what</text>
  <text start="1106.98" dur="3.36">what in your opinion would be the reason</text>
  <text start="1109.11" dur="3.81">that they were trying to protect the</text>
  <text start="1110.34" dur="4.02">Clinton Foundation well the Justice</text>
  <text start="1112.92" dur="3.6">Department at the time was working with</text>
  <text start="1114.36" dur="4.68">the Clinton campaign to target President</text>
  <text start="1116.52" dur="5.43">Trump they were targeting President</text>
  <text start="1119.04" dur="4.41">Trump one of the key folks involved in</text>
  <text start="1121.95" dur="3.74">that was Peter struck who&amp;#39;s too had a</text>
  <text start="1123.45" dur="6.54">demonstrated bias as an FBI official</text>
  <text start="1125.69" dur="7.81">against mr. Trump and in for and for</text>
  <text start="1129.99" dur="5.61">mrs. Clinton you know irony the irony of</text>
  <text start="1133.5" dur="5.16">the McCain situation is that the cave is</text>
  <text start="1135.6" dur="5.1">accused of leaking and pushback to the</text>

  <text start="1141.6" dur="5.22">in London which actually happened to be</text>
  <text start="1144.51" dur="3.9">acting and act and accurate but was not</text>
  <text start="1146.82" dur="3.479">something he was supposed to be telling</text>
  <text start="1148.41" dur="4.23">the newspapers that&amp;#39;s why he allegedly</text>
  <text start="1150.299" dur="4.38">lied about leaking to it well would you</text>
  <text start="1152.64" dur="4.47">say okay you know the there were some of</text>
  <text start="1154.679" dur="5.49">the FBI who wanted to do this would you</text>
  <text start="1157.11" dur="6.21">say it&amp;#39;s somewhat at least calls us some</text>
  <text start="1160.169" dur="5.191">red flags for the Justice Department it</text>
  <text start="1163.32" dur="3.84">sounds what you&amp;#39;re alleging is that they</text>
  <text start="1165.36" dur="2.939">were actively involved in trying to</text>
  <text start="1167.16" dur="4.17">influence the election</text>
  <text start="1168.299" dur="5.341">oh it sure does I think this is an area</text>
  <text start="1171.33" dur="4.17">that needs to be explored I wish it had</text>
  <text start="1173.64" dur="3.75">been explored by this Congress it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1175.5" dur="5.13">sufficiently I know there&amp;#39;s pushback</text>

  <text start="1185.1" dur="4.05">you have bureaucracies like a DOJ</text>
  <text start="1186.86" dur="3.61">putting their thumbs on the scales it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1189.15" dur="3.69">something that both parties ought to be</text>
  <text start="1190.47" dur="3.72">concerned about because you know if one</text>
  <text start="1192.84" dur="3.3">day the shoe will be on the other foot</text>
  <text start="1194.19" dur="4.14">politically speaking and we just want to</text>

  <text start="1369.85" dur="3.78">points of view mr. Hackney I understand</text>
  <text start="1371.92" dur="2.97">that Attorney General in the president</text>
  <text start="1373.63" dur="2.55">states had a big press conference when</text>
  <text start="1374.89" dur="2.4">it became public and said we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1376.18" dur="2.67">get to the bottom of this they talked</text>
  <text start="1377.29" dur="2.82">about possible criminal liability and</text>
  <text start="1378.85" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;re saying it didn&amp;#39;t even exist in</text>
  <text start="1380.11" dur="5.43">the very division that you were head of</text>
  <text start="1381.76" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;m not saying it didn&amp;#39;t exist I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1385.54" dur="3.66">saying that they were not looking at Tea</text>
  <text start="1387.31" dur="2.85">Party organizations but I&amp;#39;m also saying</text>
  <text start="1389.2" dur="2.91">that they were looking at many different</text>
  <text start="1390.16" dur="3.6">other organizations as you&amp;#39;ll see from</text>
  <text start="1392.11" dur="2.97">various reports that came out later that</text>
  <text start="1393.76" dur="4.71">is not true that is not what the</text>
  <text start="1395.08" dur="5.55">Inspector General said and and frankly</text>
  <text start="1398.47" dur="3.42">if it was just you know we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="1400.63" dur="2.4">everyone the same I don&amp;#39;t think Lois</text>
  <text start="1401.89" dur="2.43">Lerner would have taken the fifth when</text>
  <text start="1403.03" dur="3.18">she said right were you were setting</text>
  <text start="1404.32" dur="4.59">here today but I got to get to mr.</text>
  <text start="1406.21" dur="6.69">Fenton&amp;#39;s in my last two minutes and 30</text>
  <text start="1408.91" dur="5.88">seconds here two billion since 2001</text>
  <text start="1412.9" dur="4.92">right mr. fitton that&amp;#39;s what the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1414.79" dur="4.8">Foundation took in is that right numbers</text>
  <text start="1417.82" dur="2.91">like that I&amp;#39;ve seen 48 million in</text>
  <text start="1419.59" dur="3">speeches I think you said in your</text>
  <text start="1420.73" dur="3.69">opening statements that we did the math</text>
  <text start="1422.59" dur="3.27">you said like 200 so that&amp;#39;s like quarter</text>
  <text start="1424.42" dur="3.87">million dollars for every single speech</text>
  <text start="1425.86" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;s pretty good I mean I&amp;#39;ve heard him</text>
  <text start="1428.29" dur="5.52">speak but that is that is amazing and</text>
  <text start="1430.93" dur="5.01">then you said in 2008 when Secretary</text>
  <text start="1433.81" dur="4.5">Clinton became secretary there was an</text>
  <text start="1435.94" dur="3.6">agreement that that I think in your</text>
  <text start="1438.31" dur="3.27">testimony you said there&amp;#39;s certain</text>
  <text start="1439.54" dur="3.18">things she had to do for the duration of</text>
  <text start="1441.58" dur="2.49">her appointment she would not be</text>
  <text start="1442.72" dur="2.67">involved in all this money the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1444.07" dur="2.76">Foundation was taken in and all the</text>
  <text start="1445.39" dur="2.91">speeches that her husband was doing</text>
  <text start="1446.83" dur="3.18">right she wouldn&amp;#39;t be signing offered</text>
  <text start="1448.3" dur="6.42">making decisions about that is that</text>
  <text start="1450.01" dur="6.39">right yeah and the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="1454.72" dur="3.18">would disclose his donors so there was</text>
  <text start="1456.4" dur="3.8">an agreement that she had she worked out</text>
  <text start="1457.9" dur="5.91">when she was Senate confirmed right okay</text>
  <text start="1460.2" dur="5.53">did they follow the agreement no not in</text>
  <text start="1463.81" dur="3.6">my view at least so they had to get</text>
  <text start="1465.73" dur="2.79">permission for her to be Secretary of</text>
  <text start="1467.41" dur="2.4">State continue to do all the things they</text>
  <text start="1468.52" dur="5.28">did they got permission and he got the</text>
  <text start="1469.81" dur="5.58">okay and then it didn&amp;#39;t follow no they</text>
  <text start="1473.8" dur="3.96">immediately began the foundation</text>
  <text start="1475.39" dur="4.37">immediately contacted Miss Abidine who</text>
  <text start="1477.76" dur="4.76">work closely with mrs. Clinton</text>
  <text start="1479.76" dur="4.68">to start getting things done for</text>
  <text start="1482.52" dur="4.29">foundation supporters as I&amp;#39;ve described</text>
  <text start="1484.44" dur="4.41">and it&amp;#39;s not what I described the email</text>
  <text start="1486.81" dur="3.39">so the secretary she kept her part of</text>
  <text start="1488.85" dur="2.82">the deal but she just had her lawyer her</text>
  <text start="1490.2" dur="3.33">chief of staff sign off on everything is</text>
  <text start="1491.67" dur="3.63">that sort of how it worked yeah but Dean</text>
  <text start="1493.53" dur="3.87">did the heavy lifting there yeah you</text>
  <text start="1495.3" dur="3.75">think there&amp;#39;s a double standard right</text>
  <text start="1497.4" dur="4.98">now in America mr. Fenton</text>
  <text start="1499.05" dur="7.77">oh yeah mrs. Clinton is being protected</text>
  <text start="1502.38" dur="7.17">by and was protected and frankly still</text>
  <text start="1506.82" dur="5.28">is being protected from the consequences</text>
  <text start="1509.55" dur="4.41">of her behavior at the State Department</text>
  <text start="1512.1" dur="4.92">and subsequently my colleague from</text>
  <text start="1513.96" dur="4.62">Virginia talked about some things that</text>
  <text start="1517.02" dur="4.98">have happened recently with mr. Cohen</text>
  <text start="1518.58" dur="6.21">but I think it&amp;#39;s interesting I know I</text>
  <text start="1522" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t remember anyone associated doing</text>
  <text start="1524.79" dur="4.16">the Clinton vest I don&amp;#39;t know anyone</text>
  <text start="1526.05" dur="2.9">associated with the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1529.1" dur="3.01">investigation well first of all it</text>
  <text start="1530.88" dur="2.91">didn&amp;#39;t even call an investigation</text>
  <text start="1532.11" dur="5.25">remember what they were told to call it</text>
  <text start="1533.79" dur="5.34">matter yeah it&amp;#39;s gonna matter right it</text>
  <text start="1537.36" dur="4.02">was obviously the vestigation but was</text>
  <text start="1539.13" dur="3.93">told told to be called a matter</text>
  <text start="1541.38" dur="2.97">I don&amp;#39;t remember Cheryl Mills getting</text>
  <text start="1543.06" dur="2.16">her door kicked in at 5:00 in the</text>
  <text start="1544.35" dur="3.03">morning and having everything</text>
  <text start="1545.22" dur="4.26">confiscated I remember that at all in</text>
  <text start="1547.38" dur="3.84">fact she worked out a deal ahead of time</text>
  <text start="1549.48" dur="3.66">got immunity before she even turned over</text>
  <text start="1551.22" dur="4.17">any of her records or communication is</text>
  <text start="1553.14" dur="4.17">that right yeah I&amp;#39;d like to you know I</text>
  <text start="1555.39" dur="3.3">would just love the committees or</text>
  <text start="1557.31" dur="3.51">someone to investigate we&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="1558.69" dur="4.59">separately a traditional watch but to</text>
  <text start="1560.82" dur="4.83">find out whether or not as reports</text>
  <text start="1563.28" dur="5.07">suggests the foundation investigation</text>
  <text start="1565.65" dur="4.32">the FBI was invented conducted in 2016</text>
  <text start="1568.35" dur="3.87">was actively suppressed by the Justice</text>
  <text start="1569.97" dur="4.83">Department and curtailed you know public</text>
  <text start="1572.22" dur="4.47">reports are that FBI agents were only</text>
  <text start="1574.8" dur="3.3">able to read newspaper articles as part</text>
  <text start="1576.69" dur="3.54">of their investigation they were denied</text>
  <text start="1578.1" dur="4.2">subpoenas and other basic tools</text>
  <text start="1580.23" dur="3.56">available to them yeah when you compare</text>
  <text start="1582.3" dur="5.34">and contrast the Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="1583.79" dur="5.56">investigation into President Trump and</text>
  <text start="1587.64" dur="4.83">his associates that&amp;#39;s what a real</text>
  <text start="1589.35" dur="5.82">investigation looks like abuses aside we</text>
  <text start="1592.47" dur="4.17">haven&amp;#39;t had anything comparable even</text>
  <text start="1595.17" dur="2.94">during the Clinton email issue yeah</text>
  <text start="1596.64" dur="2.97">certainly this is tied to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1598.11" dur="2.94">email issue mr. chairman I&amp;#39;m a little</text>
  <text start="1599.61" dur="3.18">over time but like if I could wrote real</text>
  <text start="1601.05" dur="3.36">quick I didn&amp;#39;t expect to spend as much</text>
  <text start="1602.79" dur="5.46">time with mr. Hackney denying that there</text>
  <text start="1604.41" dur="6.72">was targeting at the IRS but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1608.25" dur="5.16">you&amp;#39;re I think exactly right I am I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1611.13" dur="6.51">never seen this happen mr. fitton we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1630.3" dur="3.27">and then fired I never seen that happen</text>
  <text start="1631.71" dur="3.48">but what&amp;#39;s interesting those are the</text>
  <text start="1633.57" dur="3.42">same people who ran the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1635.19" dur="3.54">investigation then started and launched</text>
  <text start="1636.99" dur="3.21">the Russian investigation never seen</text>
  <text start="1638.73" dur="4.14">that happen to any other federal agency</text>

  <text start="1959.99" dur="5.04">good seeing mr. Fenton&amp;#39;s now is it true</text>
  <text start="1963.26" dur="3">that the most recent filings for the</text>
  <text start="1965.03" dur="3.45">Clinton Foundation have shown a</text>
  <text start="1966.26" dur="4.83">significant drop-off in donations now</text>
  <text start="1968.48" dur="4.91">that they have no political power often</text>
  <text start="1971.09" dur="5.19">seeing the filings themselves but</text>
  <text start="1973.39" dur="6.16">reports have been a 62% drop off</text>
  <text start="1976.28" dur="5.52">donations so Sidney Blumenthal and own</text>
  <text start="1979.55" dur="6.06">political operative was retained by that</text>
  <text start="1981.8" dur="5.85">Clinton Foundation correct yes I recall</text>
  <text start="1985.61" dur="4.05">he was getting paid at $10,000 a month</text>
  <text start="1987.65" dur="3.63">by the Clinton Foundation so now while</text>
  <text start="1989.66" dur="3.6">he was getting a rather large paycheck</text>
  <text start="1991.28" dur="4.56">from the Clinton Foundation he was also</text>
  <text start="1993.26" dur="5.12">in Libya serving as then secretary</text>
  <text start="1995.84" dur="4.8">Clinton&amp;#39;s unofficial adviser correct</text>
  <text start="1998.38" dur="5.23">according in the New York Times and</text>

  <text start="2003.61" dur="6.48">in part by judicial watch his efforts he</text>
  <text start="2005.53" dur="6.39">sent mrs. Clinton 25 memos on Libya he</text>
  <text start="2010.09" dur="3.54">was also pushing his own financial</text>
  <text start="2011.92" dur="6.45">interest by trying to get contracts</text>
  <text start="2013.63" dur="6.03">correct yes that a quarter he worked for</text>
  <text start="2018.37" dur="2.76">the Clinton Foundation and he had</text>
  <text start="2019.66" dur="4.23">business concerns in Libya it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2021.13" dur="5.01">reported is there an ethical concern</text>
  <text start="2023.89" dur="4.29">with a known political operative working</text>
  <text start="2026.14" dur="5.66">for a supposed nonprofit that is pushing</text>
  <text start="2028.18" dur="3.62">for a war that he can profit from</text>
  <text start="2032.72" dur="4.75">well maybe I think the public interest</text>
  <text start="2035.64" dur="3.18">in here is that mrs. Clinton promised</text>
  <text start="2037.47" dur="3.48">she&amp;#39;d stay at a Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="2038.82" dur="4.23">business and she immediately and</text>

  <text start="2174.28" dur="3.51">noted about the Clinton Foundation</text>

  <text start="2210.4" dur="4.35">with someone giving their money to an</text>

  <text start="2241.78" dur="5.49">Fenton&amp;#39;s well I think it&amp;#39;s controversial</text>
  <text start="2245.32" dur="3.51">I think by what also would be</text>
  <text start="2247.27" dur="3.99">controversial is that the source</text>
  <text start="2248.83" dur="3.78">operation and mr. Soros is foundations I</text>
  <text start="2251.26" dur="3">think is going to spend about a billion</text>
  <text start="2252.61" dur="2.7">dollars this year as you point out</text>
  <text start="2254.26" dur="3.45">mostly of his own money</text>
  <text start="2255.31" dur="4.68">he&amp;#39;s subsidized in part by US tax</text>

  <text start="2267.01" dur="5.16">last comment mr. chairman you know we</text>
  <text start="2270.43" dur="3.48">start looking at nonprofits I actually</text>
  <text start="2272.17" dur="3.96">was part of a non-profit and you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2287.18" dur="4.83">Hackney I now noticed that the Clinton</text>
