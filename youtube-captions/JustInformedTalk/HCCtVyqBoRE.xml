  <text start="111.57" dur="5.759">as of today and with that we were gonna</text>
  <text start="114.719" dur="3.811">go forward and and really what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.329" dur="3.72">gonna do here is we&amp;#39;re gonna look at the</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="4.89">story of what happened in the Strait of</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="4.621">Hormuz with the tankers that were</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="4.14">attacked allegedly by the Iranians and</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="4.14">now we&amp;#39;re gonna get a little back a</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="4.02">little bit of a back story I think for</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="2.94">some of you guys who are new here but</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="2.22">more importantly this is just</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="5.01">information that we have</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="5.43">reiterate what happens is even though</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re not getting new cue posts we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="4.65">getting news every single day that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="4.5">showing us more proofs of cue if you</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="3.3">will and how is that happening well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="3.36">happening through future proving past</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="3.12">and I actually think that the</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="3.63">information that&amp;#39;s been dropped on these</text>
  <text start="150.3" dur="4.74">boards is having a huge effect on the</text>
  <text start="152.46" dur="4.38">the events of today especially when you</text>
  <text start="155.04" dur="4.53">look at what&amp;#39;s happening with Iran and</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="6.42">why they are so scared and why they</text>
  <text start="159.57" dur="5.88">would want to start a conflict globally</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="3.69">with the United States and in the way</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="2.88">that they are it&amp;#39;s it is there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="166.95" dur="5.03">reason why they&amp;#39;re emboldened and</text>
  <text start="168.33" dur="6.65">there&amp;#39;s a reason why we are in such a</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="5.47">we&amp;#39;re in such a battle with their</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="5.29">governments the governments of these</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="5.01">other countries with regard to Iran and</text>
  <text start="180.27" dur="3.93">North Korea and their subsequent</text>
  <text start="182.46" dur="4.29">affiliation with countries like Russia</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="4.59">and China and how this is more of a</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="3.59">global chess game than people really</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="4.53">understand and we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="5.74">why it could be what are the</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="6.27">possibilities behind the exact reason</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="5.22">for this conflict coming up here in the</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="4.38">Strait of Hormuz where they&amp;#39;re targeting</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="4.53">apparently allegedly oil tankers with</text>
  <text start="203.97" dur="3.42">mines that we&amp;#39;re stuck to the sides of</text>
  <text start="205.83" dur="4.55">the hulls in an attempt to either</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="4.71">disable them and/or to I guess stop them</text>
  <text start="210.38" dur="4.75">didn&amp;#39;t look like they were trying to</text>
  <text start="212.1" dur="5.58">sink them obviously but they obviously</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="4.62">disabled these these tankers and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="4.83">gonna talk about that plus what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="5.16">on with or what&amp;#39;s going on with Facebook</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="3.9">and social media and and just we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="233.22" dur="3.32">caught up and make sure you share them</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="3.93">on social media because the suggestion</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="3.94">algorithm here on YouTube with its</text>
  <text start="238.77" dur="4.71">computer machine learning whatever they</text>
  <text start="240.48" dur="5.04">call it the people who run YouTube are</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="4.17">being very straightforward saying that</text>

  <text start="247.65" dur="5.49">that they deem on the border or</text>

  <text start="255.33" dur="7.32">Service but is considered basically the</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="4.341">wrong thing or you know political</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="3.93">dissent that they don&amp;#39;t want on their</text>
  <text start="264.86" dur="2.84">platform they&amp;#39;re going to target</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="2.92">political innovate</text>

  <text start="326.23" dur="5.07">democratic way and we want it to be an</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="3.38">open speech platform as it was promised</text>
  <text start="331.3" dur="4.35">as it was guaranteed through a</text>

  <text start="343.57" dur="5.19">companies sign into an agreement which</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="4.47">stated that they are not publishers that</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="2.85">they are platforms and that they cannot</text>
  <text start="350.29" dur="4.05">act as publishers but they have</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="5.07">obviously shown a bias against</text>

  <text start="541.36" dur="4.22">Christian conservatives and in my</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="4.29">particular case evangelical conservative</text>

  <text start="548.05" dur="5.37">this you know D monetization and not</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="4.32">getting our video suggested and we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="4.11">the border whatever that means and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="3.42">controversial so the this was an</text>
  <text start="557.53" dur="2.37">important point I had to make at the</text>
  <text start="558.67" dur="3">beginning this episode so let&amp;#39;s just get</text>
  <text start="559.9" dur="4.62">right into the actual story itself</text>
  <text start="561.67" dur="5.25">here&amp;#39;s the story the USS video shows a</text>
  <text start="564.52" dur="4.56">rim moving mine from stricken tanker of</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="4.2">course we we don&amp;#39;t know what to believe</text>
  <text start="569.08" dur="4.77">here yet the official story coming out</text>
  <text start="571.12" dur="4.83">of the US military is saying that</text>
  <text start="573.85" dur="4.05">basically what happened was Iran planted</text>
  <text start="575.95" dur="4.53">these mines on the side of these tankers</text>
  <text start="577.9" dur="4.44">to disable them as some sort of show of</text>
  <text start="580.48" dur="5.31">force and that they have video</text>
  <text start="582.34" dur="7.83">apparently of what they claim to be an</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="6.78">Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the</text>
  <text start="590.17" dur="4.62">process of as you can see here what they</text>
  <text start="592.57" dur="4.86">say it is removing a mine from the side</text>
  <text start="594.79" dur="4.34">that an unexploded ordnance that had not</text>
  <text start="597.43" dur="5.85">that they put up but it had not</text>
  <text start="599.13" dur="7.09">succeeded in detonating that they went</text>
  <text start="603.28" dur="4.65">and removed that so you know take it</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="3.45">with a grain of salt this is that the</text>
  <text start="607.93" dur="3.9">latest breaking information but what we</text>
  <text start="609.67" dur="5.04">can do is go back to where we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="611.83" dur="5.88">told about the connections between Iran</text>
  <text start="614.71" dur="7.17">the Obama administration and and why the</text>
  <text start="617.71" dur="5.55">whole Iran deal actually happened and if</text>
  <text start="621.88" dur="3.03">you watch the mainstream news they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="623.26" dur="4.47">gonna tell you that the Iran deal was</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="5.55">about you know keeping nukes out of Iran</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="6.21">and and data that&amp;#39;s all good and good</text>
  <text start="630.46" dur="5.73">and well but I think in my humble</text>
  <text start="633.94" dur="3.84">opinion here that there is a much</text>
  <text start="636.19" dur="3.77">there&amp;#39;s a lot more of this story than</text>
  <text start="637.78" dur="5.31">the media will cover and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="639.96" dur="4.81">they&amp;#39;re trying to shut down the you know</text>
  <text start="643.09" dur="3.63">other sources of information because</text>
  <text start="644.77" dur="3.59">they don&amp;#39;t want this information getting</text>
  <text start="646.72" dur="4.86">out here because it could actually give</text>
  <text start="648.36" dur="5.53">more of a motive it could explain the</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="4.44">motive behind why all this is happening</text>
  <text start="653.89" dur="3.66">as it is happening now now I did a video</text>
  <text start="656.02" dur="3.81">recently that you all should go check</text>
  <text start="657.55" dur="3.51">out which is here called and this was a</text>
  <text start="659.83" dur="3.69">few days ago I think this is actually</text>
  <text start="661.06" dur="5.67">before this attack on these tankers</text>
  <text start="663.52" dur="4.9">please you know coincidentally but it</text>
  <text start="666.73" dur="3.94">basically explained</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="5.219">in in detail the allegations made</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="5.58">against Obama and Clinton and others who</text>
  <text start="673.639" dur="6.721">were framed and in this includes EU</text>
  <text start="676.25" dur="6.69">officials who were framed and into the</text>
  <text start="680.36" dur="4.77">Iran deal and into the concessions that</text>
  <text start="682.94" dur="4.35">they were making globally because they</text>
  <text start="685.13" dur="4.35">had so much dirt on these individuals</text>
  <text start="687.29" dur="3.87">for example with the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="689.48" dur="3.51">and the hundreds of millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="691.16" dur="3.869">that were taken in from foreign</text>
  <text start="692.99" dur="4.32">governments and then the the obvious</text>
  <text start="695.029" dur="4.381">pay-for-play that was happening in in in</text>
  <text start="697.31" dur="3.93">favor in return for that money</text>
  <text start="699.41" dur="6.09">especially when you look at the uranium</text>
  <text start="701.24" dur="5.64">one scandal and other scandals that they</text>
  <text start="705.5" dur="3.48">had them over a barrel they were saying</text>
  <text start="706.88" dur="4.019">we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna show all of the</text>
  <text start="708.98" dur="4.109">corruption we&amp;#39;re gonna expose you we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="5.041">gonna blackmail you and extort you into</text>
  <text start="713.089" dur="4.471">signing this agreement where you you</text>
  <text start="715.94" dur="3.449">don&amp;#39;t give us your money you can keep</text>
  <text start="717.56" dur="3.87">all the money that we gave you we want</text>
  <text start="719.389" dur="4.711">you to give us the real money the big</text>
  <text start="721.43" dur="5.099">boy money the the USA Treasury money we</text>
  <text start="724.1" dur="4.41">want pallets of cash on planes and</text>
  <text start="726.529" dur="4.771">billions of dollars in sanctions relief</text>
  <text start="728.51" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s what happened and I explained it</text>
  <text start="731.3" dur="5.61">in this video and with regard to a</text>
  <text start="732.8" dur="6.45">theory posted by the famous Twitter</text>
  <text start="736.91" dur="3.15">account or infamous depending on who</text>
  <text start="739.25" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="740.06" dur="6.779">at draw and strike who writes for The</text>
  <text start="742.97" dur="5.729">Epoch Times not sure his first name</text>
  <text start="746.839" dur="5.791">Cates is his last name the the writer</text>
  <text start="748.699" dur="5.311">for The Epoch Times so that was his</text>
  <text start="752.63" dur="3.03">theory was basically putting the other</text>
  <text start="754.01" dur="3.509">stuff that we had already figured out</text>
  <text start="755.66" dur="3.179">here on the cube boards a long time ago</text>
  <text start="757.519" dur="3.57">and that was the whole video as I point</text>
  <text start="758.839" dur="3.721">out that we knew about that a long time</text>
  <text start="761.089" dur="3.391">ago when he was exposing this</text>
  <text start="762.56" dur="4.38">information to us and we go further into</text>
  <text start="764.48" dur="5.669">that here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s one Q post and I</text>
  <text start="766.94" dur="5.519">think is completely / relevant to to</text>
  <text start="770.149" dur="3.961">today&amp;#39;s discussion with regard to Iran</text>
  <text start="772.459" dur="3.57">and what&amp;#39;s going on where talks about</text>
  <text start="774.11" dur="5.099">Hassan rouhani the president of Iran I</text>
  <text start="776.029" dur="5.281">think he&amp;#39;s the mullah or or excuse me</text>
  <text start="779.209" dur="3.87">that he is the president of Iran and it</text>
  <text start="781.31" dur="4.769">says who paid Hussein to attend Harvard</text>
  <text start="783.079" dur="4.981">Law School prince who is a prince</text>
  <text start="786.079" dur="4.021">alwaleed bin slaw so these two things</text>
  <text start="788.06" dur="3.48">are really important is anybody in the</text>
  <text start="790.1" dur="4.109">mainstream media and I&amp;#39;m asking a</text>
  <text start="791.54" dur="7.26">genuine clash question here well well</text>
  <text start="794.209" dur="7.911">anybody at NBC CBS Fox CNN wherever will</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="6.22">any of you out there dig into the fact</text>
  <text start="802.12" dur="6.84">there is a direct connection between</text>
  <text start="805.02" dur="6.1">Barack Obama&amp;#39;s tenure at Harvard and</text>
  <text start="808.96" dur="4.25">some sort of financial backing that was</text>
  <text start="811.12" dur="4.59">coming from Prince Alwaleed bin Talal</text>
  <text start="813.21" dur="4.3">that&amp;#39;d be a great place to start if</text>
  <text start="815.71" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re any mainstream news organization</text>
  <text start="817.51" dur="3.81">because we&amp;#39;ve done the research here on</text>
  <text start="819.4" dur="3.99">the channel and what it looks like is</text>
  <text start="821.32" dur="4.14">that through these these different</text>
  <text start="823.39" dur="3.75">grants and scholarships that were put</text>
  <text start="825.46" dur="3.96">together by the the Prince over there in</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="6.06">Saudi Arabia that somehow they were able</text>
  <text start="829.42" dur="7.07">to finance Barack Obama&amp;#39;s attending</text>
  <text start="833.2" dur="6.06">Harvard Law School so it says why would</text>
  <text start="836.49" dur="5.11">Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Saudi royal</text>
  <text start="839.26" dur="6.45">pay Hussein to attend Harvard Law School</text>
  <text start="841.6" dur="6.06">I wonder I wonder why right and this is</text>
  <text start="845.71" dur="4.26">a really good question and I think this</text>
  <text start="847.66" dur="4.05">comes down to what you have with MBS and</text>
  <text start="849.97" dur="3.69">then Prince Alwaleed and the two</text>
  <text start="851.71" dur="4.2">factions inside of the Saudi royal</text>
  <text start="853.66" dur="4.23">family I think first of all Q&amp;#39;s told us</text>
  <text start="855.91" dur="3.36">the Saudi royal families is one of the</text>
  <text start="857.89" dur="2.7">most powerful families in the world it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.27" dur="3.84">up there with the raw childs and the</text>
  <text start="860.59" dur="4.53">Soros and you have the Saudis who</text>
  <text start="863.11" dur="4.53">apparently according to Q have about</text>
  <text start="865.12" dur="5.52">four trillion plus dollars in wealth now</text>
  <text start="867.64" dur="5.4">that should boggle anyone&amp;#39;s mind to</text>
  <text start="870.64" dur="4.32">think of a single royal family that has</text>
  <text start="873.04" dur="5.19">four trillion dollars plus worth of</text>
  <text start="874.96" dur="6">assets and wealth and if you take that</text>
  <text start="878.23" dur="5.43">into consideration right what I believe</text>
  <text start="880.96" dur="3.99">the whole prince purge thing was and and</text>
  <text start="883.66" dur="2.91">this is getting we&amp;#39;re gonna keep jumping</text>
  <text start="884.95" dur="3.75">all over the place okay so if you guys</text>
  <text start="886.57" dur="5.1">will remember what happened in Las Vegas</text>
  <text start="888.7" dur="5.33">there was the the horrific massacre that</text>
  <text start="891.67" dur="6.03">happened in Las Vegas back in early</text>
  <text start="894.03" dur="8.86">November of 2017 or October excuse me I</text>
  <text start="897.7" dur="6.3">believe of 2017 and what&amp;#39;s been alleged</text>
  <text start="902.89" dur="3.63">and I&amp;#39;ve talked about this in previous</text>
  <text start="904" dur="5.31">videos is that President Trump was there</text>
  <text start="906.52" dur="5.19">in Las Vegas that day that night for a</text>
  <text start="909.31" dur="4.02">clandestine meeting presumably with</text>
  <text start="911.71" dur="3.63">somebody like Prince Alwaleed bin Talal</text>
  <text start="913.33" dur="4.02">or one of the factions of the Saudi</text>
  <text start="915.34" dur="5.85">royal family and that the whole thing</text>
  <text start="917.35" dur="4.25">went south quick and that what happened</text>
  <text start="921.19" dur="2.76">that night</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="4.75">allegedly you know theoretically</text>
  <text start="923.95" dur="3.9">possibly according to what we&amp;#39;ve we put</text>
  <text start="926.35" dur="3.48">out put together from the cue boards and</text>
  <text start="927.85" dur="3.75">everything is that President Trump was</text>
  <text start="929.83" dur="3.6">there clandestinely meeting with the</text>
  <text start="931.6" dur="4.729">Saudis to negotiate some sort of</text>
  <text start="933.43" dur="6.51">agreement to</text>
  <text start="936.329" dur="5.44">you know fix the problems of the past</text>
  <text start="939.94" dur="5.16">so why the Iranians and the Saudis</text>
  <text start="941.769" dur="5.701">factions of the Saudis were blackmailing</text>
  <text start="945.1" dur="4.2">and extorting our political officials so</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="3.84">president Trump being that he has not</text>
  <text start="949.3" dur="3.659">been blackmailed er extorted by these</text>
  <text start="951.31" dur="4.589">individuals went to try to negotiate a</text>
  <text start="952.959" dur="5.25">deal with them to either I guess</text>
  <text start="955.899" dur="3.781">you know try to fix whatever he can</text>
  <text start="958.209" dur="3.75">because it&amp;#39;s like how do you really fix</text>
  <text start="959.68" dur="3.54">this situation if it&amp;#39;s in fact true that</text>
  <text start="961.959" dur="3.271">they were extorting and blackmailing</text>
  <text start="963.22" dur="6.239">them with information that showed their</text>
  <text start="965.23" dur="6.15">their guilt he tries to fix it we have</text>
  <text start="969.459" dur="4.081">this horrible tragedy and then they were</text>
  <text start="971.38" dur="4.879">gonna try to pin that on his back but</text>
  <text start="973.54" dur="4.62">thankfully he got away from there</text>
  <text start="976.259" dur="6.161">clandestinely without anybody knowing</text>
  <text start="978.16" dur="5.76">and when that happened that was when</text>
  <text start="982.42" dur="3.63">right after you saw the purge of the</text>
  <text start="983.92" dur="3.45">Saudi princes where we basically went to</text>
  <text start="986.05" dur="4.26">Saudi Arabia and said look you need to</text>
  <text start="987.37" dur="4.86">arrest these people you need to to fix</text>
  <text start="990.31" dur="3.63">this corruption because you have princes</text>
  <text start="992.23" dur="3.38">who are buying enormous amounts of</text>
  <text start="993.94" dur="5.67">influence in our country and</text>
  <text start="995.61" dur="6.969">orchestrating these horrific you know</text>
  <text start="999.61" dur="4.74">attacks allegedly so that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="1002.579" dur="3.421">theory it&amp;#39;s a theoretical thought about</text>
  <text start="1004.35" dur="2.76">what could have happened there so if he</text>
  <text start="1006" dur="4.889">put that together with what we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1007.11" dur="5.43">it also says was Hussein a prominent</text>
  <text start="1010.889" dur="3.361">political figure a personal influence at</text>
  <text start="1012.54" dur="3.96">the time know who was Valerie Jarrett so</text>
  <text start="1014.25" dur="4.5">Valerie Jarrett is Barack Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1016.5" dur="6.17">right-hand person whatever you wanna</text>
  <text start="1018.75" dur="6.51">call it and she was born in Iran and</text>
  <text start="1022.67" dur="4.899">she&amp;#39;s the one who hired Michelle</text>
  <text start="1025.26" dur="6.84">Robinson who later became Michelle Obama</text>
  <text start="1027.569" dur="6.661">right and this is really where it gets</text>
  <text start="1032.1" dur="4.65">weird it just shows how they were all in</text>
  <text start="1034.23" dur="5.52">this same circle and so many people have</text>
  <text start="1036.75" dur="5.03">alleged that if you look at Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="1039.75" dur="6.12">from just a purely political standpoint</text>
  <text start="1041.78" dur="6.759">he was in fact in favor of collectivism</text>
  <text start="1045.87" dur="4.59">in fact in favor of socialistic policies</text>
  <text start="1048.539" dur="4.081">he&amp;#39;s in favor I mean the the the whole</text>
  <text start="1050.46" dur="3.599">Obamacare thing was just an enormous</text>
  <text start="1052.62" dur="4.25">step in the wrong direction for our</text>
  <text start="1054.059" dur="5.761">country trying to to to collectivise</text>
  <text start="1056.87" dur="5.97">Medicare and collectivise health care</text>
  <text start="1059.82" dur="7.589">and then to also socialized our</text>
  <text start="1062.84" dur="4.87">basically our entire government and this</text>
  <text start="1067.409" dur="2.161">was</text>
  <text start="1067.71" dur="3.15">a huge problem that I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1069.57" dur="3.93">people in our government recognize but</text>
  <text start="1070.86" dur="4.02">nobody was really actively standing up</text>
  <text start="1073.5" dur="3.779">to these people because they controlled</text>
  <text start="1074.88" dur="4.74">all the levers and now they control all</text>
  <text start="1077.279" dur="3.661">the levers but as it says here you know</text>
  <text start="1079.62" dur="3.39">they were working with different people</text>
  <text start="1080.94" dur="3.989">the former mayors and current mayor of</text>
  <text start="1083.01" dur="4.98">Chicago Rahm Emanuel and Richard Daley</text>
  <text start="1084.929" dur="6.6">and this is how it all happens Chicago</text>
  <text start="1087.99" dur="6.179">the the everything that you could</text>
  <text start="1091.529" dur="5.76">imagine with the corruption and chaos in</text>
  <text start="1094.169" dur="5.551">Chicago it would breed a candidate like</text>
  <text start="1097.289" dur="4.02">Barack Obama I mean if you think about</text>
  <text start="1099.72" dur="3.54">it look at I mean just look at the</text>
  <text start="1101.309" dur="6.061">murder rate in Chicago right now the</text>

  <text start="1947.74" dur="2.76">go we do a segment at the end of each</text>
  <text start="1948.97" dur="3.75">one of these episodes called God&amp;#39;s grace</text>
  <text start="1950.5" dur="4.8">is greater we talk about God&amp;#39;s grace now</text>
  <text start="1952.72" dur="5.61">it is truly greater for today&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1955.3" dur="4.23">grace is greater segment I want to share</text>
  <text start="1958.33" dur="4.41">this piece of scripture with you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1959.53" dur="6.06">out of Philippians chapter 2 verses 5</text>
  <text start="1962.74" dur="5.61">through 11 and it talks about Christian</text>
  <text start="1965.59" dur="3.93">humility or Christ&amp;#39;s humility and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1968.35" dur="3.21">talked about this before on the show</text>
  <text start="1969.52" dur="4.05">like humility what does it mean it means</text>
  <text start="1971.56" dur="3.39">being humble it means being humble</text>
  <text start="1973.57" dur="3.87">before God showing reverence to God</text>
  <text start="1974.95" dur="3.72">understanding that only God knows</text>
  <text start="1977.44" dur="3.18">everything and that you&amp;#39;re not in</text>
  <text start="1978.67" dur="4.11">control of certain things that&amp;#39;s what a</text>
  <text start="1980.62" dur="4.02">big part of you know Christ humility is</text>
  <text start="1982.78" dur="4.71">but I think this verse actually explains</text>
  <text start="1984.64" dur="4.71">it even better than I could obviously so</text>
  <text start="1987.49" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;m going to share it with you but it</text>
  <text start="1989.35" dur="4.17">talks about Christ&amp;#39;s humility and</text>
  <text start="1990.79" dur="4.62">exaltation so it says again Philippians</text>
  <text start="1993.52" dur="4.47">chapter 2 verse 5 through 11 it says</text>
  <text start="1995.41" dur="4.77">make your own attitude that of Christ</text>
  <text start="1997.99" dur="3.3">Jesus who existing in the form of God</text>
  <text start="2000.18" dur="2.58">did not consider</text>
  <text start="2001.29" dur="3">quality with God is something to be used</text>
  <text start="2002.76" dur="4.47">for his own advantage</text>
  <text start="2004.29" dur="5.1">instead he emptied himself by assuming</text>
  <text start="2007.23" dur="4.74">the form of a slave taking on the</text>
  <text start="2009.39" dur="5.1">likeness of men and when he had come as</text>
  <text start="2011.97" dur="4.56">a man in his external form he humbled</text>
  <text start="2014.49" dur="4.4">himself by becoming obedient to the</text>
  <text start="2016.53" dur="5.52">point of death even to death on a cross</text>
  <text start="2018.89" dur="5.11">for this reason God also highly exalted</text>
  <text start="2022.05" dur="4.65">him and gave him the name that is now</text>
  <text start="2024" dur="5.22">above every other name so that at the</text>
  <text start="2026.7" dur="5.1">name of Jesus every knee should bow of</text>
  <text start="2029.22" dur="4.86">those who are in heaven and on earth and</text>
  <text start="2031.8" dur="4.86">under the earth and every tongue should</text>
  <text start="2034.08" dur="7.77">confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the</text>
  <text start="2036.66" dur="7.2">glory of God and father and I know</text>
  <text start="2041.85" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty simple and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2043.86" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s saying something that I think a</text>
  <text start="2045.75" dur="3.21">lesson that we learned through Christ</text>
  <text start="2047.55" dur="2.97">and I think that&amp;#39;s the message I want to</text>
  <text start="2048.96" dur="5.79">share is that the lesson we learned</text>
  <text start="2050.52" dur="6.87">through Christ is that when he came to</text>
  <text start="2054.75" dur="4.919">earth and assumed the form of man he</text>
  <text start="2057.39" dur="4.83">knew that that he had that the power of</text>
  <text start="2059.669" dur="5.431">God but he humbled himself before God he</text>
  <text start="2062.22" dur="5.16">was obedient in the world of man as he</text>
  <text start="2065.1" dur="4.53">lived because he wanted to live by</text>
  <text start="2067.38" dur="4.049">example and he wanted to show us the</text>
  <text start="2069.63" dur="4.83">example for how to live a righteous life</text>
  <text start="2071.429" dur="4.321">and he did that and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2074.46" dur="4.85">lesson I think we should take about</text>
  <text start="2075.75" dur="6.36">humility and being humble before God and</text>
  <text start="2079.31" dur="5.65">so my prayer everyday is God give me the</text>
  <text start="2082.11" dur="5.49">strength and courage and wisdom to have</text>
  <text start="2084.96" dur="4.41">to be your most humble servant and I</text>
  <text start="2087.6" dur="2.91">want you guys to say that prayer I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2089.37" dur="2.49">want you guys to share that prayer with</text>
  <text start="2090.51" dur="4.38">your family and loved ones because that</text>
  <text start="2091.86" dur="4.68">is a very important part of being a</text>
  <text start="2094.89" dur="3.66">Christian in my opinion so I hope that</text>
  <text start="2096.54" dur="3">that message gets to you and yours but</text>
