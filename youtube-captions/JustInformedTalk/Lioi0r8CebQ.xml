  <text start="50.46" dur="5.009">Donald Trump did was he took this 700</text>
  <text start="53.1" dur="6.029">billion and 716 billion both going to</text>
  <text start="55.469" dur="7.351">the military for various projects and he</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="5.85">can re he can he can redress that money</text>
  <text start="62.82" dur="4.02">and put it wherever he wants to be quite</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="4.201">frank because it&amp;#39;s a he can claim</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="5.13">national security or national defense as</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="5.22">he puts here to build a wall because</text>

  <text start="74.4" dur="3.509">combatants pouring into our country and</text>
  <text start="76.409" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s genius</text>
  <text start="77.909" dur="5.25">I love it I didn&amp;#39;t see it at first but</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="5.341">now I finally caught it a fantastic job</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="3.811">I by Trump getting this bill out there</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="3.21">now of course there are parts of the</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="5.7">Omnibus that we don&amp;#39;t agree with that we</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="6.87">don&amp;#39;t like ie you know 500 million to</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="6.269">Planned Parenthood so on and so forth</text>
  <text start="95.4" dur="7.13">just a bunch of pork for everyone</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="6.241">involved but omnibus is more of a</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="4.659">flexible it&amp;#39;s not a set budget it can be</text>
  <text start="105.18" dur="4.439">changed he can actually defund certain</text>
  <text start="107.189" dur="4.441">things he can actually move money from</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="4.201">agencies that don&amp;#39;t use funds so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="3.66">really incredible and that was part of</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="3.149">the omnibus that I picked up on in the</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="4.02">last couple videos where he can take</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="4.08">money from programs that don&amp;#39;t use it</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="4.47">and put it toward other things so for</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="4.291">instance these these military projects</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="6.27">he can actually divert some of that</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="6.84">funding to creating a border wall which</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="3.66">you know if one point troop for trillion</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="3.72">dollars he could I</text>
  <text start="133.71" dur="4.92">like somebody keep I&amp;#39;ve seen a few posts</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="3.93">in the comments where they say 1.4</text>
  <text start="138.63" dur="2.46">trillion they could build a wall around</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="4.35">the whole country and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="7.05">pretty true now red castle green castle</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="4.86">clock activated stage 5 5 is that all</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="3.69">border wall</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="5.94">quite possibly right now I&amp;#39;m still going</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="4.53">to go ahead and say there&amp;#39;s in my</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="3.87">opinion possibly a double meaning</text>
  <text start="156.36" dur="4.98">beneath it but you have what you have</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="5.31">here ladies and gentlemen you have the</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="4.17">border wall gonna get built and I think</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s important to Trump but he needs</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="3.3">to wake up and realize that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="4.38">lot of other stuff going on here</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="5.07">and we all need to keep on him to make</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="7.65">sure that he continues to do the right</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="6.75">thing every time and it was a part of</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="3.18">the storm that was coming</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="4.92">but speaking of storms let&amp;#39;s go ahead</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="8.19">and talk about a distraction if you will</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="7.56">now Trump was not very happy about</text>
  <text start="190.74" dur="5.04">what&amp;#39;s happening in the news and he made</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.49">a tweet about it saying so much fake</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="6.99">news never been more volume is volume</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="6.24">mineus and more at or more accurate but</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="4.62">through it all our country is doing</text>
  <text start="204.84" dur="4.65">great so there you have it</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="3.57">what is the storm well the storm is this</text>
  <text start="209.49" dur="3.84">stormy Daniels and I&amp;#39;m gonna get into a</text>
  <text start="210.96" dur="3.9">few things about her I watched the whole</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="3.93">interview I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s worth going</text>
  <text start="214.86" dur="4.65">through and showing you clips because to</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="5.34">me it was just a complete fluff piece</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="7.08">with no substance and basically making</text>
  <text start="222.6" dur="6.96">their case to the broken non-disclosure</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="4.68">agreement she did to make the case for a</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="5.73">defamation suit that they can bring in a</text>
  <text start="231.27" dur="9.53">state court to basically draw Trump into</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="9.63">a state court to have to fight for his</text>
  <text start="240.8" dur="5.32">defamation suit to fight for his</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="3.39">violation of the non-disclosure</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="3.84">agreement with stormy Daniels and then</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="3.33">on the other hand have debt the story</text>
  <text start="249.96" dur="4.26">Daniel&amp;#39;s be able to say that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.64" dur="4.71">defaming her where she points out that</text>
  <text start="254.22" dur="4.62">Michael Cohen is defaming her but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="4.41">talk about the interview okay so the</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="6">interview was went a lot like this</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="6.69">stormy Daniels describes a moment about</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="4.59">12 years ago or so where Trump was that</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="4.97">all tournament and they were but she</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="6.78">allegedly had an extramarital affair</text>
  <text start="272.42" dur="5.8">with Donald Trump that night and she is</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="5.94">breaking the non-disclosure agreement</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="6.72">that she signed which to me makes her</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="4.32">criminal but she&amp;#39;s breaking that</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="5.37">nondisclosure agreement she&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="6.32">here she to tell us about this basically</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="6.18">nothing burger there&amp;#39;s no there there</text>
  <text start="292.79" dur="6.58">even if even if this isn&amp;#39;t just an</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="5.61">alleged accusation it is true I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="4.65">see what importance it has to anything</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="6.03">that we are dealing with today as a</text>
  <text start="304.02" dur="6.06">country or as a nation as a whole when</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="3.6">it comes to having 60 minutes do a whole</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="3.15">sit-down interview where they act like</text>
  <text start="311.73" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re interviewing you know</text>
  <text start="313.23" dur="4.23">Vladimir Putin and ask him about the the</text>
  <text start="315.66" dur="4.67">nuclear tensions between our countries</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="6.45">no no it&amp;#39;s stormy Daniels the</text>
  <text start="320.33" dur="4.78">self-proclaimed porn star whatever that</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="4.77">means</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="7.67">that who thinks that she is somehow able</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="6.72">to get on national television and</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="6.13">basically commit crime of breaking a</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="8.73">nondisclosure agreement and then further</text>
  <text start="338.91" dur="11">go on to basically contradict herself</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="8.31">she&amp;#39;s got about as much trust ability or</text>
  <text start="349.91" dur="4.33">validity to what she says is you know a</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="3.45">homeless person walking up to me on the</text>
  <text start="354.24" dur="4.2">street and tell me they have schematics</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="4.11">for a time machine okay that&amp;#39;s about as</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="3.42">much as I trust what she says</text>
  <text start="360" dur="5.79">considering a few facts that&amp;#39;ll lay out</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="6.33">here very quickly so she signs a</text>
  <text start="365.79" dur="4.85">nondisclosure agreement and she accepts</text>
  <text start="368.19" dur="5.01">one hundred and thirty thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="370.64" dur="4.75">from Michael Cohen Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="3.99">attorney who is his friend as well who</text>
  <text start="375.39" dur="4.77">Cohen did of his own accord to keep her</text>
  <text start="377.19" dur="4.62">silent from spreading lies about Trump</text>
  <text start="380.16" dur="4.05">in a very critical time in the campaign</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="5.91">when Trump couldn&amp;#39;t afford to have</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="6.12">somebody like that speaking these</text>
  <text start="387.72" dur="6.45">mistruths about him or they may be</text>
  <text start="390.33" dur="6.57">truths but regardless we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="394.17" dur="4.13">truth about it yet now we take into</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="4.35">account the fact that she signed</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="5.23">multiple statements</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="4.38">okay she signed multiple statements</text>
  <text start="403.53" dur="3.84">saying that she never had an</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="4.67">extramarital affair with Trump and she</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="6.63">never had intercourse with Trump but</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="5.47">then she goes back and says oh well I</text>
  <text start="414" dur="7.32">was just scared and people told me I had</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="9.12">to sign that what okay what now</text>
  <text start="421.32" dur="5.79">apparently this this breaking off her</text>
  <text start="424.89" dur="3.9">non-disclosure agreement she&amp;#39;s come</text>
  <text start="427.11" dur="3.42">under fire now for Michael Cohen who is</text>
  <text start="428.79" dur="4.59">threatening to sue her or is actually</text>
  <text start="430.53" dur="5.19">enacting the suit as we speak for around</text>
  <text start="433.38" dur="4.38">20 million dollars which was I think</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="3.48">stipulated in that if she broke it now</text>
  <text start="437.76" dur="3.81">she doesn&amp;#39;t have 20 million dollars my</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="4.44">biggest fear is that you&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="441.57" dur="5.67">one of these globalist Luciferian elite</text>
  <text start="443.64" dur="5.61">pedophile whoever&amp;#39;s to come in and say</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="4.11">oh well you know don&amp;#39;t worry you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.25" dur="4.59">doing a really great brave thing and you</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="4.38">know Trump&amp;#39;s evil and here&amp;#39;s 20 million</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="6.69">dollars and don&amp;#39;t worry about it you</text>
  <text start="455.73" dur="6.33">just tell your story girl okay now if</text>
  <text start="460.53" dur="4.71">that happens there&amp;#39;s nothing anybody can</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="5.13">do about it but it just shows the lines</text>
  <text start="465.24" dur="4.59">that these people are willing to cross</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="4.83">when it comes to what is fair and what</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="7.32">is good and what is honorable and decent</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="7.86">they have no moral compass people like</text>
  <text start="477.15" dur="5.13">stormy and her lawyer thinking they can</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="5.4">say whatever they want but we all know</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="5.22">the truth that they are all just seeking</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="6.12">to defame our president and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="5.91">seeking to make themselves famous in the</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="4.14">process now if they have other</text>
  <text start="493.41" dur="4.53">motivations I&amp;#39;m sure they exist as well</text>
  <text start="495.54" dur="4.83">if you watch this interview going</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="4.05">through it you have several parts of the</text>
  <text start="500.37" dur="5.19">interview that are just maddening to</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="5.4">watch as a logical normal person but she</text>
  <text start="505.56" dur="4.08">actually makes this crazy insinuation</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="3.69">that I think really needs to be like she</text>
  <text start="509.64" dur="5.31">needs to back up when she makes these</text>
  <text start="511.08" dur="6.839">kind of talking points with regard to</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="4.41">her being threatened okay she tells us</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="3.571">this story about how she was in I think</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="4.559">Las Vegas with her kid about to go to a</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="4.29">exercise class and she was getting her</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="4.021">kid out of the car and a guy walks up</text>
  <text start="525.78" dur="5.04">and says that she needs to drop the</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="5.43">whole Trump thing right and then</text>
  <text start="530.82" dur="4.17">furthermore it goes the guy says it</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="5.55">would be a shame if something happens</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="5.37">your kid as in threatening I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="2.82">condone that I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.36" dur="5.76">deplorable nobody should ever do that</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="6.3">but first of all what evidence does she</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="3.81">have that that person had anything to do</text>
  <text start="548.04" dur="4.919">with Trump or Michael Cohen or anyone</text>
  <text start="549.93" dur="6.57">involved in this you know she&amp;#39;s a public</text>
  <text start="552.959" dur="4.921">figure a self-proclaimed porn star that</text>
  <text start="556.5" dur="3.42">could have been any nutjob who read a</text>
  <text start="557.88" dur="6.51">story about her and Trump could have</text>
  <text start="559.92" dur="6.419">been any wack job out there okay and for</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="3.36">her to make that insinuation just shows</text>
  <text start="566.339" dur="2.87">the kind of character that we&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="3.839">with so somebody who doesn&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="569.209" dur="4.391">wildly making accusations without at</text>
  <text start="571.589" dur="5.161">least you know having some basis in fact</text>
  <text start="573.6" dur="6.39">for putting them out there now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="576.75" dur="6.089">just one part of why I really disagree</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="5.67">with this person I think she is the</text>
  <text start="582.839" dur="5.011">epitome of a distraction she&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="585.66" dur="4.35">epitome of a lost soul who we need to</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="4.29">pray for she is the epitome of somebody</text>
  <text start="590.01" dur="5.16">who does not deserve the time of day to</text>
  <text start="592.14" dur="6.12">listen to her speak because when you</text>
  <text start="595.17" dur="6.83">consistently contradict yourself over</text>
  <text start="598.26" dur="6.66">and over again your credibility goes</text>
  <text start="602" dur="4.69">down and it can go down to the point</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="3.15">where nobody believes you anymore you</text>
  <text start="606.69" dur="3.63">ever heard of the story of the boy who</text>
  <text start="608.07" dur="3.05">cried wolf well he cried wolf so many</text>
  <text start="610.32" dur="3.09">times</text>
  <text start="611.12" dur="4.54">it eventually nobody believed him and</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="4.739">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s gonna happen in my humble</text>
