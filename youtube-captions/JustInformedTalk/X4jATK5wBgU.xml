  <text start="132.69" dur="4.53">nine five</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="5.58">- 955 and apparently it&amp;#39;s in response to</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="3.81">this story that came out today about</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="3.81">former acting Attorney General Matthew</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="4.44">Whitaker leaving the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="4.74">now the story basically kind of goes on</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="4.53">to say it&amp;#39;s not known where he&amp;#39;s heading</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="4.739">after this but he&amp;#39;s decided to step down</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.08">and this is exactly what Q told us would</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="4.321">have him if you think about the context</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="5.519">of the scare Moochie model like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="4.319">been told many times by q about anthony</text>
  <text start="159.599" dur="3.181">scary Moochie who came in as the White</text>
  <text start="161.129" dur="4.591">House communications director for I</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="5.519">believe like 10 days if not only just to</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="5.72">shake it up and - that has subsequently</text>
  <text start="168.299" dur="5.52">led to the dismissal of Reince Priebus</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="4.69">Reince Priebus however you say his name</text>
  <text start="173.819" dur="5.041">and others from that White House which</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="5.07">was actually a part of a plan Q says you</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="4.89">have a short memory in on he did remain</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="3.81">on and in a senior role as stated by the</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="3.39">DOJ and it points to this political</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="3.809">article which Q already gave us which</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="4.29">actually does it is something that we</text>
  <text start="188.819" dur="6.51">confirmed because he was he stayed on</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="6.42">after William Barr took control as a</text>
  <text start="195.329" dur="6.931">senior official but now he&amp;#39;s stepping</text>
  <text start="197.85" dur="6.93">down and Q is saying duration stated and</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="4.77">it says why are key positions always</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="4.38">interchanging logical thinking by</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="4.859">oneself clarifies easy to answer</text>
  <text start="209.16" dur="4.47">questions q and I like what q points to</text>
  <text start="211.889" dur="4.5">later is one of the anton says it&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="4.829">to hit a moving target and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="216.389" dur="3.331">point the point is is that moving these</text>
  <text start="218.459" dur="2.881">people around in these different</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="5.449">positions makes them hard to pin down</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="7.259">which makes them hard to be basically</text>
  <text start="225.169" dur="4.72">twisted by the system and to get dirt on</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="3.811">them or to blackmail in order to put</text>
  <text start="229.889" dur="4.291">them in positions or whatever right you</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="5.759">move around it&amp;#39;s hard to hit a moving</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="4.649">target that does the point so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.169" dur="3.511">what that is</text>
  <text start="238.829" dur="4.291">now the next one here talks about an</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="3.57">Anton basically responding to that</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="4.979">saying remain then go but we really</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="3.78">liked him Q and Q says departure from</text>
  <text start="248.099" dur="2.79">the DOJ</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="4.829">doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s not on the team and</text>
  <text start="250.889" dur="5.731">still in the game or by our analogy an</text>
  <text start="253.859" dur="5.16">actor in the movie so this is all a</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="4.679">stage the stage is being set everything</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="4.441">is in place for a reason you guys know a</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="4.381">lot of the disinformation that we see on</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="3.959">here is meant to throw off that the</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="5.069">people who are enemies of our country</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="5.31">so don&amp;#39;t forget that and this is</text>
  <text start="270.749" dur="3.871">basically an analogy that I think&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.729" dur="5.131">appropriate because he&amp;#39;s gonna obviously</text>
  <text start="274.62" dur="7.729">stay active in some capacity if Q saying</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="6.54">this which means that there is not a</text>
  <text start="282.349" dur="4.15">there&amp;#39;s nothing strange about this</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="4.259">action happening and the next one is an</text>
  <text start="286.499" dur="4.591">ant on saying acting temporary role</text>
  <text start="288.659" dur="5.19">cause destruction then move on hard to</text>
  <text start="291.09" dur="4.65">hit a moving target and on and that was</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="5.94">a response I think to this one down here</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="6.66">and are basically that and it&amp;#39;s in Hugh</text>
  <text start="299.789" dur="4.951">says scare Moochie model temp higher by</text>
  <text start="302.4" dur="6.979">design shadow to sessions by design</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="7.59">public will become aware doc dump cue so</text>
  <text start="309.379" dur="5.38">first of all don&amp;#39;t forget that Matthew</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="5.609">Whitaker was the acting chief of staff</text>
  <text start="314.759" dur="5.16">for Jeff Sessions before he was actually</text>
  <text start="317.939" dur="4.98">terminated from his position by the</text>
  <text start="319.919" dur="8.661">president so one could safely conclude</text>
  <text start="322.919" dur="9.24">that when sessions was removed and</text>
  <text start="328.58" dur="5.399">Matthew Whitaker was installed that all</text>
  <text start="332.159" dur="4.35">of that information that was basically</text>
  <text start="333.979" dur="5.41">untouchable by Jeff Sessions through his</text>
  <text start="336.509" dur="6">own recusal became immediately available</text>
  <text start="339.389" dur="6.18">to Matthew Whitaker who set the stage</text>
  <text start="342.509" dur="5.28">for William Barr the new attack acting a</text>
  <text start="345.569" dur="5.041">turn of the new Attorney General to</text>
  <text start="347.789" dur="4.771">actually step in and get ready for the</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="4.559">d-class doc dump that&amp;#39;s going to prove</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="5.219">beyond a reasonable doubt I believe that</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="4.86">there was incredible corruption in both</text>
  <text start="357.779" dur="5.721">the Hussein administration Department of</text>
  <text start="360.029" dur="8.221">Justice and FBI and other organizations</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="6.819">prior to the 2016 presidential election</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="4.529">now the next one says Q sometimes I</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="5.84">think it is hard for y&amp;#39;all to emphasize</text>
  <text start="372.779" dur="5.88">with us or empathize with us the all on</text>
  <text start="376.159" dur="4.421">operation are operating from a position</text>
  <text start="378.659" dur="4.26">of knowledge we are in the dark we are</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="5.399">desperate for truth and justice and cues</text>
  <text start="382.919" dur="5.31">does define back-channel and what is a</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="4.951">back-channel and the official definition</text>
  <text start="388.229" dur="5.34">is a secondary or covert route for this</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="4.859">passage of information also it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.569" dur="4.051">referred to as this back-channel as a</text>
  <text start="395.789" dur="4.44">practice of using networked computers to</text>
  <text start="397.62" dur="3.68">maintain a real-time online conversation</text>
  <text start="400.229" dur="2.961">alongside the Prime</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="3.75">group activity or live spoken remarks</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="3.9">the term was coined in the field of</text>
  <text start="405.05" dur="5.01">linguistics to describe listeners</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="5.789">behaviors during verbal communication so</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="4.47">I think it&amp;#39;s taken in the first sentence</text>
  <text start="412.879" dur="4.081">here that it&amp;#39;s a secondary it&amp;#39;s a covert</text>
  <text start="414.53" dur="4.859">route for the passage of information as</text>
  <text start="416.96" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve said before this cue board is a way</text>
  <text start="419.389" dur="4.02">to disseminate information now some of</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="6.03">it may be might be disinformation which</text>
  <text start="423.409" dur="5.07">is why you have to be very careful but</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="5.4">at the same time that disinformation</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="7.051">serves a purpose to keep our keep the</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="4.589">enemies of our republic guessing as to</text>
  <text start="435.53" dur="3.78">what will happen next and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="437.389" dur="4.68">specifically referring to those who have</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="5.699">committed crimes of corruption crimes of</text>
  <text start="442.069" dur="5.731">sedition crimes of treason and crimes</text>
  <text start="445.009" dur="6">against children those kind of things I</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="5.609">think that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re really fighting</text>
  <text start="451.009" dur="4.56">about back against in the back-channel</text>
  <text start="453.409" dur="5.04">is what Q is it&amp;#39;s a military</text>
  <text start="455.569" dur="5.1">intelligence back-channel basically that</text>
  <text start="458.449" dur="5.731">comes straight funneled out of the White</text>
  <text start="460.669" dur="5.191">House it seems it says here in the next</text>
  <text start="464.18" dur="3.419">one Hussain gave the order to start the</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="4.859">spy campaign it was logged officially</text>

  <text start="480.229" dur="5.49">has authorization to obtain the more you</text>
  <text start="482.63" dur="5.67">know Q so this is interesting what Q is</text>
  <text start="485.719" dur="6.331">insinuating here is that President Obama</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="6.269">met with the FISA Court judge prior to</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="5.13">getting those bycel warrants signed off</text>
  <text start="494.569" dur="5.07">on or rubber-stamped as it seems where</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="6.329">they didn&amp;#39;t even have to go and present</text>
  <text start="499.639" dur="6.06">evidence besides presenting the actual</text>
  <text start="503.509" dur="5.13">document the FISA warrant itself the</text>
  <text start="505.699" dur="5.43">FISA application itself they didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="508.639" dur="4.351">have to have an in-person meeting with</text>
  <text start="511.129" dur="4.53">the judge who apparently signed off on</text>
  <text start="512.99" dur="5.19">this warrant to go spy on Carter page</text>
  <text start="515.659" dur="5.641">which in turn has led us to understand</text>
  <text start="518.18" dur="4.409">now that that was the the way that they</text>
  <text start="521.3" dur="3.3">knew they were going to get President</text>
  <text start="522.589" dur="4.141">Trump by getting this low-level guy and</text>
  <text start="524.6" dur="8.7">then using their ability to skip to</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="8.219">other people the two hop rule where if I</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="1.88">talked to somebody and then they talked</text>
  <text start="534.949" dur="2.181">to</text>
  <text start="535.18" dur="3.63">somebody basically the intelligence</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="3.66">community can look at all of the people</text>
  <text start="538.81" dur="4.32">that were talked to and all of their</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="4.35">friends and all their their networks of</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="4.64">people that they talk to so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="545.14" dur="4.5">very disturbing that that was employed</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="3.46">and that&amp;#39;s why a lot of people on</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="4.77">Capitol Hill right now are talking about</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="6.12">reforming the FISA courts because this</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="3.48">was a total and blatant abuse if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="2.79">true</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="4.35">by the Huseyin administration and</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="4.53">politically motivated to help the</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="3.93">Clinton campaign and it still failed but</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="3">now we&amp;#39;re seeing the aftermath with</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="3.75">these insurance policies and these</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="5.85">endless investigations into president</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="6.09">Trump&amp;#39;s personal professional life</text>
  <text start="573.52" dur="5.04">before becoming president now and having</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="4.68">nothing to do anymore with Russia so the</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="4.77">next one here is the video you saw at</text>
  <text start="580.69" dur="3.899">the beginning here this is the the full</text>
  <text start="583.33" dur="2.67">video I&amp;#39;ll leave a link to it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.589" dur="3.631">basically a press conference but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586" dur="4.14">what the takeaway is that President</text>
  <text start="588.22" dur="4.41">Trump basically lays out that he can do</text>
  <text start="590.14" dur="4.11">this better than the Dems he can</text>
  <text start="592.63" dur="4.05">investigate them and put them on the</text>
