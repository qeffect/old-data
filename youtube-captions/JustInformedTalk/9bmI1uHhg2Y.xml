  <text start="237.579" dur="3.12">briefly let&amp;#39;s get into it a little</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="4.229">deeper here on a previous episode</text>
  <text start="240.699" dur="4.62">federal prosecutors are in the final</text>
  <text start="243.099" dur="4.741">stages of deciding on whether to indict</text>
  <text start="245.319" dur="4.5">Andrew a cave we talked about this story</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="5.97">briefly yesterday but now it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="249.819" dur="6.361">out that we&amp;#39;re getting reports from New</text>
  <text start="253.81" dur="3.929">York Times saying that their prosecutors</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="4.47">that have left the DOJ out of</text>
  <text start="257.739" dur="5.011">frustration because nobody knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="5.1">going to happen are they going to indict</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="5.52">Andrew McCabe for lying and leaking</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="3.93">and trying to enact a coup against the</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="3.66">sitting president are they just gonna</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="4.02">let him get off with you know scot-free</text>
  <text start="271.93" dur="5.49">with no charges just like they have</text>
  <text start="273.7" dur="5.79">everyone else up to this point well</text>
  <text start="277.42" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re gonna wait and see what actually</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="4.14">happens but if you ask me I do think</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s very possible that McCabe does come</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="4.77">under indictment I think that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="6.18">why he went we talked about this I think</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="5.69">in a previous episode where he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="8.01">before this came down he went and joined</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="7.72">the CNN fake news squad as one of their</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="4.65">contributors making probably about two</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="5.609">to three thousand dollars per appearance</text>
  <text start="304.21" dur="5.1">to get on national TV and lie to you we</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="3.841">the American people about his</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="4.41">involvement are in all of these crimes</text>
  <text start="311.26" dur="4.02">and this criminal coup treasonous coup</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="3.6">that was put together against the</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="5.61">president United States in order to try</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="6.41">to unseat him after his due or after he</text>
  <text start="320.89" dur="6.96">was duly elected to that position so</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="6.73">it&amp;#39;s a panic move it cues told us about</text>
  <text start="327.85" dur="6.69">this in the past obviously cues explain</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="6.6">that what they&amp;#39;ll end up trying to do is</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="4.29">go get these news jobs call themselves</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="3.39">journalists or you know political</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="4.2">contributors whatever you want to call</text>
  <text start="340.45" dur="4.29">it and then they can say oh look I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="343.03" dur="4.02">being politically persecuted by this</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="5.31">indictment from president Trump&amp;#39;s DOJ</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="5.34">when the reality is you&amp;#39;re not being</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="4.71">persecuted you&amp;#39;re being indicted for a</text>
  <text start="352.39" dur="5.01">criminal act that you allegedly</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="4.74">committed according to an investigation</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="4.89">and a grand jury that was in panel to</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="4.59">look at evidence I mean the way they try</text>
  <text start="362.29" dur="3.66">to frame it though it takes advantage of</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="3.329">the fact that a lot of people are busy a</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="3.029">lot of people work a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="4.5">have time to pay attention these things</text>
  <text start="368.979" dur="5.821">and when they do they they blindly trust</text>
  <text start="371.919" dur="4.651">fake news liars like the people at CNN</text>
  <text start="374.8" dur="4.29">and New York Times and Washington Post</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="3.75">they take advantage of that that</text>
  <text start="379.09" dur="3.21">nobody&amp;#39;s gonna look a little bit deeper</text>
  <text start="380.32" dur="4.53">and say oh it&amp;#39;s obviously political</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="4.5">because you know president Trump&amp;#39;s hates</text>
  <text start="384.85" dur="3.69">Mackay because he was calling him out</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="5.01">for being a Russian agent because CNN</text>
  <text start="388.54" dur="5.82">told me so an MSNBC confirmed it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="5.28">two sources saying the same thing they</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="4.68">must be right and accurate well now</text>
  <text start="397.09" dur="4.53">actually they&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="399.04" dur="5.16">implicit in the fact that they covered</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="5.94">up that there was no Russia collusion</text>
  <text start="404.2" dur="5.49">and they are involved in trying to set</text>
  <text start="407.56" dur="7.38">up the president even further on a daily</text>
  <text start="409.69" dur="7.86">basis for his everything impeachment</text>
  <text start="414.94" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s a racist he&amp;#39;s needs to be removed</text>
  <text start="417.55" dur="4.23">for the 25th amendment because he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="419.47" dur="5.16">mentally fit you name it they&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="421.78" dur="4.95">after him every six ways from Sunday as</text>
  <text start="424.63" dur="5.52">Chuckie Schumer would say crying Chuckie</text>
  <text start="426.73" dur="5.28">Schumer but nothing has happened and</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re still waiting on these things to</text>
  <text start="432.01" dur="4.98">come through but I really am thinking</text>
  <text start="435.16" dur="3">that this one&amp;#39;s gonna come but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="3.66">lot of other things coming down the</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="5.07">pipeline too and we&amp;#39;ll end up talking</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="5.07">about those speaking of the New York</text>
  <text start="443.23" dur="6.56">Times their newsroom literally has</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="7.35">bedbugs so chew on that for a minute</text>
  <text start="449.79" dur="5.65">anyway here&amp;#39;s Sarah a car Sarah Carter</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="5.34">putting out a great article saying the</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="4.68">2000 or in 2018 election Google&amp;#39;s bias</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="4.38">may have shifted seventy eight point two</text>

  <text start="462.79" dur="5.1">this is going further into the research</text>
  <text start="465.37" dur="4.89">being conducted here by dr. Robert</text>

  <text start="490.21" dur="7.53">to vote for Democrats or Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="6.45">namely to the tune of between two to ten</text>

  <text start="504.13" dur="4.44">candidate Hillary Clinton by these big</text>
  <text start="506.56" dur="5.19">tech companies and the worst part about</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="5.52">it is it was all done subliminally by</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="5.58">fixing the algorithms by suppressing</text>
  <text start="514.09" dur="6.81">certain content amplifying others and by</text>

  <text start="528.46" dur="5.21">they&amp;#39;re subtly being manipulated in</text>

  <text start="547.019" dur="4.44">Epstein has contended and in this new</text>

  <text start="556.339" dur="4.24">election bias in Google search results</text>
  <text start="558.509" dur="5.55">may have shifted upwards of 78 million</text>

  <text start="564.059" dur="5.07">party thing about that for one second</text>
  <text start="566.189" dur="5.041">now we already know in the 2016 election</text>
  <text start="569.129" dur="4.77">it was according to dr. Epstein studies</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="5.07">and research it was between 2 to 10</text>
  <text start="573.899" dur="5.761">million probably even up to 16 million</text>
  <text start="576.3" dur="5.25">according to other individuals now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="3.959">being told that in the 2018 election</text>

  <text start="583.619" dur="4.741">scale they put their whole fist on the</text>
  <text start="585.509" dur="6.75">scale and pushed it all the way to 78</text>
  <text start="588.36" dur="6.829">million people that were voting that</text>
  <text start="592.259" dur="8.94">they swayed their votes now this is</text>
  <text start="595.189" dur="8.171">terrifying first of all why does Google</text>
  <text start="601.199" dur="4.411">exert this much power in our in our</text>
  <text start="603.36" dur="4.409">campaign era in our elections and then</text>
  <text start="605.61" dur="4.11">why does the fake news media always</text>
