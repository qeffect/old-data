  <text start="114.63" dur="4.349">that closed-door testimony was taking</text>

  <text start="126.36" dur="3.989">some sound bites from mark Meadows and</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="3.16">Jim Jordan and I think are really</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="3.131">interesting so I&amp;#39;m going to play those</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="3.34">for you right now they</text>
  <text start="133.48" dur="5.069">go right into the heart of what this</text>
  <text start="134.86" dur="5.78">story is talking about mr. Baker could</text>
  <text start="138.549" dur="5.16">you answer some questions for reporters</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="6.76">miss mr. Baker are you the subject of an</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="7.53">FBI leak investigation mr. Baker did you</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="5.64">handle the dossier did you warn Deputy</text>
  <text start="151.239" dur="3.991">Attorney General Rosenstein that there</text>
  <text start="153.04" dur="4.29">was exculpatory information before he</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="4.47">signed the Feisal final surveillance</text>
  <text start="157.33" dur="4.82">warrant mr. Baker will you take our</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="2.45">questions</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="4.17">we know Bruce or was giving information</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="4.049">to the FBI we know Christopher steel was</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="3.32">giving information to FBI we also learn</text>
  <text start="170.459" dur="4.851">today that there was another source</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="5.019">giving information directly to the FBI</text>
  <text start="175.31" dur="4.48">and that dealt with the Russian</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="4.351">investigation so we felt that was</text>
  <text start="179.79" dur="3.479">important there&amp;#39;s some other good</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="2.82">information we got on some other issues</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="2.55">that begin</text>
  <text start="184.41" dur="4.47">we hope this transcript will get out</text>
  <text start="185.819" dur="5.431">soon so I mean the kind of information</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="4.62">that the American people need to know</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="5.459">and they need to know it as soon as</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="6.269">possible so this was in my mind maybe</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="6.451">the most informative I don&amp;#39;t agree the</text>
  <text start="199.769" dur="6.511">most informative and the best deposition</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="5.549">we&amp;#39;ve had yet as far as learning new</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="7.17">things of confirming confirming some</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="9.201">some concerns and suspicions we had said</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="4.46">is is probably the most informative</text>
  <text start="261.8" dur="3.16">so there you go</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="3.63">you heard mark Meadows and Jim Jordan</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="3.75">joining the fact that what they heard</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="3.27">today the American people need to know</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="4.04">and I&amp;#39;m sure what has to deal with</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="4.77">directly is the fact that James Baker is</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="4.9">alluding to the fact that he&amp;#39;s he</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="5.43">informed rod Rosenstein and others at</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="5.63">the FBI that the evidence being used to</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.73">obtain the FISA warrant was in fact</text>
  <text start="283.28" dur="6.4">unverified and that they knew that going</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="5.61">into the process of trying to obtain</text>
  <text start="289.68" dur="4.44">that warrant and who knows what else</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="4.86">that James Baker knows as far as who was</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="5.549">involved in who knew exactly what was</text>
  <text start="296.73" dur="4.77">going on when the FBI and the DOJ were</text>
  <text start="299.669" dur="3.661">advised under the trump administration</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="4.8">or excuse me under the Obama</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="5.52">administration to spy on the Trump</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="4.47">campaign so that I don&amp;#39;t of itself is</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="3.54">breaking and that&amp;#39;s bombshell but um</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="4.37">that&amp;#39;s what he wants us to I think to</text>

  <text start="352.26" dur="3.77">pretty</text>
  <text start="353.419" dur="5.071">incredible stuff as cute pointed out and</text>
  <text start="356.03" dur="3.93">I pointed out in the last video so as</text>
  <text start="358.49" dur="4.169">was mentioned in the last video here</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="3.989">Jeff Sessions has been subpoenaed to</text>
  <text start="362.659" dur="4.47">appear before the committee on the</text>

  <text start="388.009" dur="6.15">think that&amp;#39;s what Q is is pointing us to</text>
  <text start="390.319" dur="5.491">and then it&amp;#39;s saying also that as the</text>
  <text start="394.159" dur="3.391">FBI wraps up this whole Justice</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="3.389">Kavanaugh investigation that he should</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="3.66">be confirmed this weekend meaning they</text>
  <text start="399.199" dur="5.4">should hold the vote either Friday or</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="5.81">Saturday you know we&amp;#39;ll see about that</text>
  <text start="404.599" dur="4.68">who knows hopefully there&amp;#39;s not some</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="4.84">another lunatic that comes out of the</text>
  <text start="409.279" dur="5.67">woodwork making uncorroborated baseless</text>
  <text start="411.86" dur="5.19">accusations against judge Kavanaugh but</text>
  <text start="414.949" dur="4.951">presumably this weekend should be the</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.019">time by which judge Kavanagh will be put</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="3.15">to vote I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="421.069" dur="3.27">confirmed or not q made a bold</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="4.709">prediction saying that the confirmation</text>
  <text start="424.339" dur="5.221">will go 5347 so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and</text>
  <text start="427.759" dur="4.171">see if that is true or if that was a</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="3.99">reference to something else but then</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="4.109">also it says rod resisting and Rob</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="6.44">Rosenstein is actually set to testify in</text>

  <text start="445.219" dur="3.391">gonna be basically I think asking him a</text>
  <text start="446.93" dur="7.949">lot of questions about what he knew when</text>
  <text start="448.61" dur="8.519">he knew it and how the whole process for</text>
  <text start="454.879" dur="3.78">obtaining that faisal went and basically</text>
  <text start="457.129" dur="3.21">the program asks me a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="458.659" dur="5.07">about James Baker&amp;#39;s testimony to see</text>
  <text start="460.339" dur="5.281">what he says and this is ladies and</text>
  <text start="463.729" dur="3.9">gentlemen the Red October and we are</text>
  <text start="465.62" dur="3.569">following the pattern it&amp;#39;s becoming</text>
  <text start="467.629" dur="4.47">quite obvious if you follow this</text>
  <text start="469.189" dur="4.081">information on a daily basis as I do and</text>
  <text start="472.099" dur="4.111">some of you I know a lot of you out</text>

  <text start="480.889" dur="5.161">it was Q saying panic and DC James Baker</text>
  <text start="483.44" dur="3.63">testifying against Comey so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="486.05" dur="3.62">part of it too James</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="4.14">maker didn&amp;#39;t just roll over on</text>
  <text start="489.67" dur="4.77">Rosenstein and Makeba</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="5.16">I know that commis been certainly</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="5.08">exposed for what he is</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="5.16">and it&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s what Q says though Q</text>
  <text start="499.52" dur="2.85">says it&amp;#39;s it takes time to reach the</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="2.88">public domain</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="3.81">why were the McCabe memos released to</text>
  <text start="504.41" dur="5.01">the New York Times rod Rosenstein where</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="5.01">wire insurance threat what did they</text>
  <text start="509.42" dur="4.35">think was about to drop think</text>
  <text start="511.19" dur="5.789">declassified did they delay or did the</text>
  <text start="513.77" dur="5.25">delay and smear tactics used by</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="6.231">Democrats regarding justice Kavanagh</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="6.48">help Republicans regard our regarding</text>
  <text start="523.21" dur="4.99">subluxated Arden confirmation and</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="4.92">November 6 election did select Democrats</text>
  <text start="528.2" dur="5.39">expose themselves regarding leaks</text>
  <text start="530.42" dur="6.63">release of confidential personal info</text>
  <text start="533.59" dur="6.43">cdef and then it says if you know your</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="4.85">opponent&amp;#39;s moves read october q okay so</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="5.1">what this is all talking about is pretty</text>
  <text start="541.9" dur="5.32">simple if you look at it for what it is</text>
  <text start="545.12" dur="5.28">right so it says takes time to reach the</text>
  <text start="547.22" dur="5.1">public so we knew back what almost a</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="3.99">month ago that james baker was gonna be</text>
  <text start="552.32" dur="5.91">testifying against Comey or he had</text>
  <text start="554.39" dur="5.97">already done that and now this was</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="3.69">interesting so when q put this up now</text>
  <text start="560.36" dur="3.15">this board is seen by the world so you</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="5.73">guys don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t forget that that what</text>
  <text start="563.51" dur="5.34">we do here it&amp;#39;s pretty big and and if</text>
  <text start="567.65" dur="3.84">you don&amp;#39;t think that the players</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="4.59">involved are watching this board i think</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="4.38">that you may be quite mistaken because</text>
  <text start="573.44" dur="4.47">they are watching it and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="4.29">so useful for q as well because when</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="4.14">this information got put up Cuba saying</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="3.68">panic in DC James Baker testifying</text>
  <text start="582.05" dur="4.62">against coming well what did they do</text>
  <text start="583.84" dur="4.6">they freaked out so they used the McCain</text>
  <text start="586.67" dur="5.46">memos to release that rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="5.79">story to basically make it to force</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="4.08">president Trump&amp;#39;s hand to obviously fire</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="4.17">rod Rosenstein so that they could have a</text>
  <text start="596.21" dur="4.17">reason to impeach him before the whole</text>
  <text start="598.4" dur="5.04">declassification comes out and that was</text>
  <text start="600.38" dur="5.07">their form of insurance and it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="4.14">it was basically the threat that they</text>
  <text start="605.45" dur="4.26">perceived that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m reading it and</text>
  <text start="607.58" dur="2.94">it says what did they think was about to</text>
  <text start="609.71" dur="1.77">drop well they thought the</text>
  <text start="610.52" dur="3.75">declassification</text>
  <text start="611.48" dur="6.09">Declassified FISA documents were going</text>
  <text start="614.27" dur="5.04">to drop which would expose what James</text>
  <text start="617.57" dur="3.03">Baker is probably testifying to behind</text>

  <text start="723.55" dur="5.56">it made them expose themselves and I</text>
  <text start="726.86" dur="4.38">think what Q saying with the CDE</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="3.99">F is that they knew what the next move</text>
  <text start="731.24" dur="3.75">was gonna be and it basically it</text>

  <text start="871.31" dur="3.06">is not what we think and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="872.54" dur="4.98">wait and see exactly if it is or is not</text>
  <text start="874.37" dur="5.91">what it seems to be on its face value so</text>
  <text start="877.52" dur="5.16">the next one is Q responding here to two</text>
