  <text start="82.74" dur="5.97">post where from which we left off here</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="5.939">and basically this is a fox news article</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="3.96">that was put out that talks about a DHS</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="3.691">department homeland security official</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.409">who is saying that the border security</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="5.669">bill does not contain amnesty</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="5.371">quote-unquote poison pills now if you</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="5.341">guys know and I&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="6.87">President Trump just recently was able</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="7.199">to sign a bill that was put forth by</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="6.21">Congress which basically allocated a</text>
  <text start="112.979" dur="5.971">little over 1 billion dollars in money</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="5.67">for the border wall so construction now</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="4.47">this is the contested part of the deal</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="4.199">and in conjunction with signing that</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="3.69">bill the appropriation that was written</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="4.95">by Congress President Trump actually</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="5.91">also declared a national emergency and</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="3.451">has started diverting resources toward</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="3.21">the southern</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="4.23">in order to start building the wall now</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="5.19">the first critique that was put out by</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="7.32">the media as we so lovingly call them</text>
  <text start="141.42" dur="6.39">the mainstream media or lamestream media</text>
  <text start="145.35" dur="4.65">whatever you want to say basically what</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="3.45">it did was they started pointing out all</text>
  <text start="150" dur="3.48">of these flaws and they started pointing</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="4.74">to appropriations inside the bill that</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="7.14">talked about unaccompanied alien minors</text>
  <text start="156" dur="6.27">and how its de facto amnesty right so</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="3.63">this is a lot of people out there saying</text>
  <text start="162.27" dur="4.38">this and this article actually seeks to</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="6">basically debunk that amnesty claim</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="5.55">right because here was the part that I</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="4.44">think they were trying to point to where</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="6.09">it talked about how it would work it</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="5.76">said that no funds may be used to detain</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="4.05">or deport any sponsor or potential</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="4.35">sponsor of an unaccompanied alien child</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="4.62">it adds that even any member of a</text>
  <text start="184.8" dur="5.55">household or a potential sponsor is now</text>
  <text start="186.96" dur="5.55">immune from deportation but the DHS</text>
  <text start="190.35" dur="4.47">official told Fox News that terms like</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="3.57">potential sponsor have precise meanings</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="4.11">in Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="4.92">regulations and meanings that severely</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="4.86">limit the number of people the budget</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.17">keeps safe from deportation so if you</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="2.85">guys have been seeing reports about</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="2.91">President Trump signing this bill and</text>
  <text start="206.64" dur="3.59">you&amp;#39;re upset because there are these</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="6.48">quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="6.88">amnesty poison pills that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="4.05">just a complete mischaracterization of</text>
  <text start="217.11" dur="3.54">the truth and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into this</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="4.65">further in the later q posts where q</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="4.83">breaks down step-by-step how president</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="3.93">Trump&amp;#39;s signing that bill and in</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="3.68">conjunction with the nation√≠s the</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="4.68">declaration of a national emergency</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="6.88">there are certain ways that President</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="6.78">Trump has worded the the language inside</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="5.52">of both of those that counteracts</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="5.28">whatever types of writings were put in</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="4.23">by Congress to undermine the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="4.44">ability to move forward with building</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="4.65">the wall if that makes sense so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="3.21">leave that one all these have a bunch of</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="2.49">articles that we&amp;#39;re gonna go over in</text>

  <text start="1397.7" dur="4.8">basically the emergency that was</text>

  <text start="1418.19" dur="2.94">through it it&amp;#39;s very interesting it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1419.63" dur="3.36">just basically it says here it&amp;#39;s a fact</text>
  <text start="1421.13" dur="3.75">sheet that goes over that now the next</text>
  <text start="1422.99" dur="3.54">one here is even more interesting which</text>
  <text start="1424.88" dur="3.03">is a statement from the president now</text>
  <text start="1426.53" dur="3.09">the beauty of this is we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="1427.91" dur="3.99">over the later post where Q clarifies</text>
  <text start="1429.62" dur="4.29">all this is that this statement actually</text>
  <text start="1431.9" dur="5.4">goes through point by point so what</text>
  <text start="1433.91" dur="5.67">happened was when the bill was was put</text>
  <text start="1437.3" dur="4.08">put through Congress and then put on the</text>
  <text start="1439.58" dur="3.69">president that president&amp;#39;s desk which</text>
  <text start="1441.38" dur="3.96">established the one point something</text>
  <text start="1443.27" dur="3.63">billion dollars worth of funding for the</text>
  <text start="1445.34" dur="3.66">wall they wrote in all these little</text>
  <text start="1446.9" dur="4.35">caveats that basically would allow</text>
  <text start="1449" dur="3.69">Congress to curtail the amount of money</text>
  <text start="1451.25" dur="3.78">that was spent and to basically shut</text>
  <text start="1452.69" dur="4.8">down certain portions of that spending</text>
  <text start="1455.03" dur="3.78">well this point by point seems to go</text>
  <text start="1457.49" dur="3.6">through and point out how the president</text>
  <text start="1458.81" dur="4.59">has certain executive privileges and</text>
  <text start="1461.09" dur="3.419">powers that would allow him to go around</text>
  <text start="1463.4" dur="4.439">those</text>
  <text start="1464.509" dur="6.03">those right ends in the bill in order to</text>
  <text start="1467.839" dur="5.22">supersede whatever Congress says they</text>
  <text start="1470.539" dur="4.38">can do as far as removing funding right</text>
  <text start="1473.059" dur="3.27">for the wall so that&amp;#39;s kind of what this</text>
  <text start="1474.919" dur="2.521">goes through point by point again I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1683" dur="4.32">perfectly in a perfect statement right</text>
  <text start="1685.16" dur="4.29">it says Trump&amp;#39;s statement is brilliant</text>
  <text start="1687.32" dur="4.17">deep state loaded the bill with multiple</text>

  <text start="1693.05" dur="3.57">points out section by section where they</text>
  <text start="1694.73" dur="3.51">tried to block him and he&amp;#39;s countering</text>
  <text start="1696.62" dur="3.51">that by citing presidential and</text>
  <text start="1698.24" dur="3.99">constitutional authority shall we play a</text>
  <text start="1700.13" dur="5.13">game and it&amp;#39;s got all the hashtags down</text>

  <text start="1705.26" dur="3.96">exactly what President Trump did and is</text>
  <text start="1707.72" dur="3.18">doing that&amp;#39;s what that statement was</text>
  <text start="1709.22" dur="3.6">about you guys can go read through it if</text>
  <text start="1710.9" dur="4.62">you want but it basically it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1712.82" dur="5.04">rebuttal to what they did with that bill</text>
  <text start="1715.52" dur="4.38">as far as writing in little caveats that</text>
  <text start="1717.86" dur="4.5">allowed them to divert funding and</text>
  <text start="1719.9" dur="4.62">president Trump&amp;#39;s using his presidential</text>
  <text start="1722.36" dur="4.53">and her executive and constitutional</text>

  <text start="2312.99" dur="6.45">I mean Q + excuse me q + possibly who</text>
  <text start="2317.91" dur="4.95">knows who knows who Q + is it could be</text>
  <text start="2319.44" dur="5.28">anybody right I don&amp;#39;t know anyway so</text>
  <text start="2322.86" dur="5.58">this is basically laying out that</text>
  <text start="2324.72" dur="5.42">there&amp;#39;s a 0 Delta between Trump tweets</text>
  <text start="2328.44" dur="6.21">and the Q posts right</text>
  <text start="2330.14" dur="5.92">another blatant Q proof yes what is this</text>
  <text start="2334.65" dur="3.96">talking about it says you know another</text>
  <text start="2336.06" dur="5.82">blatant Q proof double zero Delta Trump</text>
  <text start="2338.61" dur="3.84">team is with us today friends isn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="2341.88" dur="2.58">incredible</text>
  <text start="2342.45" dur="3.69">I mean I&amp;#39;m I feel blessed to be in this</text>
  <text start="2344.46" dur="3.96">position to be able to bring this</text>
  <text start="2346.14" dur="3.69">information to you and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2348.42" dur="3.48">incredible so first of all it goes like</text>
  <text start="2349.83" dur="4.38">this it shows president Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter</text>
  <text start="2351.9" dur="4.8">account where he tweets it shows this</text>
  <text start="2354.21" dur="5.61">post right here and it shows the timing</text>
  <text start="2356.7" dur="7.71">of them both and there are 2 0 Delta</text>
  <text start="2359.82" dur="6.66">guys Q + so you know the Delta is</text>
  <text start="2364.41" dur="4.29">basically referring the fact that first</text>
  <text start="2366.48" dur="5.76">of all like look you can see here this</text>
  <text start="2368.7" dur="6.87">is a 29 just look at the last ones 2907</text>
  <text start="2372.24" dur="5.94">and this one is a 28 basically a 0 Delta</text>
  <text start="2375.57" dur="7.02">within a minute and of course right here</text>
  <text start="2378.18" dur="8.91">you have 129 and the 0 Delta of the 28</text>
  <text start="2382.59" dur="6.57">so you know double zeros means under a</text>
  <text start="2387.09" dur="3.96">minute right that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="2389.16" dur="3.9">basing these off of we can&amp;#39;t get down to</text>
  <text start="2391.05" dur="5.13">the second yet because as Q&amp;#39;s explained</text>
  <text start="2393.06" dur="5.49">in the past if there are two phones in</text>
  <text start="2396.18" dur="4.53">the same room that our military with</text>
  <text start="2398.55" dur="5.39">military encryption one might take an</text>
  <text start="2400.71" dur="5.4">extra a couple seconds or take few less</text>
  <text start="2403.94" dur="4.09">seconds than the other but you can</text>
  <text start="2406.11" dur="4.14">basically if you tweet and post at the</text>
  <text start="2408.03" dur="4.44">same time then you can get a 0 Delta for</text>
  <text start="2410.25" dur="3.45">these q posts that coincide perfectly</text>
  <text start="2412.47" dur="4.97">with President Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter account</text>
  <text start="2413.7" dur="6.27">so that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s referring to and</text>
  <text start="2417.44" dur="4.54">the next one here is quite interesting</text>
  <text start="2419.97" dur="3.96">as well again Q is telling us that we</text>
  <text start="2421.98" dur="3.63">are the news because what we just talked</text>
  <text start="2423.93" dur="3.45">about with lining up these maps right</text>
  <text start="2425.61" dur="3.66">and looking at the electoral college and</text>
  <text start="2427.38" dur="4.2">how it ended up turning out for Hillary</text>
  <text start="2429.27" dur="4.41">and where the states are where people</text>
  <text start="2431.58" dur="4.53">have been given driver&amp;#39;s license which</text>
  <text start="2433.68" dur="6.24">would make it easier for them to vote so</text>
  <text start="2436.11" dur="6.39">this you know look where are the news</text>
  <text start="2439.92" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re giving information that is really</text>
  <text start="2442.5" dur="5.07">important and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2445.41" dur="3.96">what makes a big big ax stiffer insis I</text>
  <text start="2447.57" dur="3.15">think between our movement and what</text>
  <text start="2449.37" dur="3.06">people want to cast this as in the</text>
  <text start="2450.72" dur="3.33">mainstream media we&amp;#39;re basically just</text>
  <text start="2452.43" dur="2.88">here discussing things and asking</text>
  <text start="2454.05" dur="4.14">questions that people don&amp;#39;t want to ask</text>
  <text start="2455.31" dur="4.77">so anyway another 0 Delta showing it</text>
  <text start="2458.19" dur="4.89">some some more comprehensive graphic to</text>
