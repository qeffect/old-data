  <text start="8.91" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s a word that was only supposed to be</text>
  <text start="11.099" dur="4.71">used in special occasions high crimes</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="3.99">and misdemeanors in this case there was</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="3.871">no crime whatsoever not even a little</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="4.29">tiny crime so there&amp;#39;s no crime</text>
  <text start="19.68" dur="4.109">whatsoever and they know it and they go</text>
  <text start="21.93" dur="5.06">into those rooms and they close those</text>

  <text start="263.05" dur="3.66">Washington Post reporting today is</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="4.109">Melania</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="5.31">sending coded messages or are we just</text>
  <text start="269.199" dur="3.241">talking to ourselves well let me ask you</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="2.85">this</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="4.89">was there something interesting about a</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="4.74">tweet recently by the first lady and the</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="5.399">answer is yes and it relates directly to</text>
  <text start="279.61" dur="5.94">Q even though this story again is trying</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="5.071">to paint Melania as some kind of victim</text>
  <text start="285.55" dur="4.679">who&amp;#39;s calling out for help when in</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.86">reality I think it&amp;#39;s quite the opposite</text>
  <text start="290.229" dur="4.981">they&amp;#39;re just attacking her now because</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="5.039">Baron Trump just got attacked and she</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="4.47">lashed out rightfully so against the</text>
  <text start="297.699" dur="4.411">woman who attacked her son who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="4.919">non-political who&amp;#39;s president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.11" dur="4.86">son for no other reason than his name</text>
  <text start="304.599" dur="4.771">which is really disgusting if you think</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="3.87">about it but I&amp;#39;ll let you guys decide</text>
  <text start="309.37" dur="3.78">for yourself let&amp;#39;s look at the evidence</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="3.78">so I I highlighted this on my Twitter</text>
  <text start="313.15" dur="4.799">awhile ago but this happened back</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="5.31">December 1st of this year where I guess</text>
  <text start="317.949" dur="4.831">Melania Trump put out this video right</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="4.35">of Christmas at the White House and you</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="5.1">just happen to have this screenshot</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="10.979">which is really cool which has a actual</text>
  <text start="327.88" dur="9.21">17 number Domino so 11 and 6 make of</text>
  <text start="335.259" dur="3.09">that what you will but the fact that one</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="4.29">of the ornaments on the tree that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.349" dur="6.301">featured in this video is a Domino with</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="5.73">the number 17 and die marks on it tells</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="4.35">you that there is something being told</text>
  <text start="347.11" dur="4.17">to us maybe a wink and a nod and then</text>
  <text start="349" dur="5.909">subsequently after this her son was</text>
  <text start="351.28" dur="6.359">attacked by a deranged supposed Yale</text>
  <text start="354.909" dur="6.301">scholar on Capitol Hill while during</text>
  <text start="357.639" dur="7.051">their testimony saying that the the son</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="5.85">of President Trump&amp;#39;s name is barren but</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="5.009">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that he can appoint</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="6.12">him into a barren to becoming a barren</text>
  <text start="369.699" dur="5.97">some ridiculously disgusting attack on</text>
  <text start="373.18" dur="4.62">you know a minor who has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="375.669" dur="3.87">with this right the kid just is probably</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="4.41">trying to do what every kids trying to</text>
  <text start="379.539" dur="4.5">do enjoy their life and be successful so</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;m not you know getting into this whole</text>
  <text start="384.039" dur="4.651">mode of let&amp;#39;s it let&amp;#39;s go into this</text>
  <text start="385.78" dur="5.58">further because when Melania Trump came</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="5.009">forward and said basically you know you</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="4.529">can&amp;#39;t say this about my son she was</text>
  <text start="393.699" dur="4.65">attacked Samara Lee by the fake news</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="3.901">media and I think it&amp;#39;s disgusting and</text>
  <text start="398.349" dur="4.531">and the fact that we have to talk about</text>
  <text start="399.79" dur="5.25">here is just beyond me but there we</text>
  <text start="402.88" dur="2.79">there we are right is she sending coded</text>
  <text start="405.04" dur="2.64">messages</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="5.97">I don&amp;#39;t know Washington Post are you</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="7.14">sending fake news on a daily basis maybe</text>
  <text start="411.64" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s the same answer so now just to let</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="2.55">everybody know here&amp;#39;s some some</text>
  <text start="416.26" dur="3.17">interesting stories we&amp;#39;re going to talk</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="5.64">about just let everybody know that</text>
  <text start="419.43" dur="5.25">everything that&amp;#39;s happening is not for</text>
  <text start="423.01" dur="4.2">nothing we are in the midst of</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="6.64">indictments coming they were promised by</text>
  <text start="427.21" dur="7.11">the end of 2019 and here we are with six</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="4.77">individuals I believe on multiple</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="4.29">individuals I should say including</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="4.97">George Nader with direct connections to</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="5.13">Hillary Clinton in her campaign being</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="5.98">accused and charged with indictments in</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="5.07">a multi-million dollar campaign</text>
  <text start="447.04" dur="4.86">contribution illegal campaign</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="4.62">contribution case right now if you watch</text>
  <text start="451.9" dur="3.51">the fake news as we discussed yesterday</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="4.53">the Washington Post ran with this story</text>
  <text start="455.41" dur="4.53">except instead of putting a picture of</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="4.5">George Nader with I don&amp;#39;t know Bill</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="4.8">Clinton outside of Punta Cana in the</text>

  <text start="465.58" dur="4.8">Island they used they used a picture of</text>
  <text start="468.04" dur="4.41">President Trump with Jorge nadir that</text>
  <text start="470.38" dur="4.02">was completely out of context to the</text>
  <text start="472.45" dur="3.84">story itself because the story is about</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="3.99">people being charged with funneling</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="4.59">money illegally into the Clinton</text>
  <text start="478.39" dur="4.11">campaign not Trump&amp;#39;s campaign right and</text>
  <text start="480.88" dur="4.4">this is Jorge nadir the guy who already</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="4.95">had been indicted on charges of child</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="3.94">pornography and other things so you have</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="2.28">to ask yourself this very important</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="2.76">question</text>
  <text start="489.73" dur="4.74">did George Nader just turn state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.98" dur="5.97">witness as soon as he got into this and</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="5.88">I&amp;#39;m sure the answer is 100% yes you know</text>
  <text start="497.95" dur="4.5">hypothetically speaking because he</text>
  <text start="500.35" dur="5.04">understood that the only way he was</text>
  <text start="502.45" dur="4.77">going to get some kind of deal was to</text>
  <text start="505.39" dur="4.23">turn over on these people who are now</text>
  <text start="507.22" dur="3.78">being brought into court the names of</text>

  <text start="539.08" dur="6.24">excessive contribution long story short</text>
  <text start="541.84" dur="6.33">these guys were all involved in funding</text>
  <text start="545.32" dur="6.42">the Clinton campaign illegally right</text>
