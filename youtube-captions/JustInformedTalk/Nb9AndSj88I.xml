  <text start="154.26" dur="5.57">with what&amp;#39;s going on in the news but</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="7.35">before we do that I want to start with</text>
  <text start="159.83" dur="6.04">basically that the story that we talked</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="4.83">about at the beginning here first of all</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="6.93">here it is so this is state-run Chinese</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="6.06">media Xinhua News which is reporting</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="6.12">that one of their reporters was covering</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="8.22">I guess president Trump leaving DC to go</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="7.32">to the UK and witnessed Secret Service</text>
  <text start="183.69" dur="6.09">agents actually opened fire on a man who</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="6.18">was trying to enter a secure area now</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="4.08">this is still unsubstantiated and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="5.25">not really being picked up by any</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="6.06">mainstream US media outlets and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="3.93">basically been ghosted on the internet</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="4.56">so I don&amp;#39;t know if this is a fake news</text>
  <text start="201.6" dur="5.82">story or if this is a real story but</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="6.06">only time will tell with that as of</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="6.12">right now they have these pictures and</text>
  <text start="210.54" dur="5.49">it according to the story that was put</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="3.99">up by Jim fought says a man was taken</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="2.91">down near the White House on Sunday</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="3.21">night after us so he could Service</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="5.37">agents open fire according to Xinhua</text>
  <text start="220.74" dur="5.88">reporter on site the man was entering a</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="4.17">lockdown area north of the White House</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="4.35">shortly after US President Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="4.41">departed from the South Lawn for a</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="4.62">foreign trip Secret Service agents gave</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="4.26">verbal warnings before opening fire the</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="2.97">condition condition of the man is</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="4.56">unclear and they have this picture which</text>
  <text start="238.56" dur="6.24">I&amp;#39;m guessing was snapped by the jinhua</text>
  <text start="241.71" dur="5.07">reporter on the scene so this is pretty</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="3.87">interesting I&amp;#39;m not sure what&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="246.78" dur="3.09">come of this story here&amp;#39;s another photo</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="3.45">that was taken it says this was a</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.38">snapshot taken from my video shows</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="6.21">Secret Service agents outside the White</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="6.03">House in DC on June 2nd 2019 a man was</text>
  <text start="258.33" dur="4.08">taken down near the White House on</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="3.66">Sunday after US Secret Service agents</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="3.64">opened fire according to his general</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="4.42">reporter on site so</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="3.209">then you kind of go and you search for</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="2.91">this and I&amp;#39;m trying to find other</text>
  <text start="269.259" dur="3.87">stories gonna corroborate it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="271.27" dur="3.299">know if it&amp;#39;s just so new and just</text>
  <text start="273.129" dur="3.061">happened that nobody&amp;#39;s picked it up yet</text>
  <text start="274.569" dur="3.211">or if it&amp;#39;s not what it seems because</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="3.78">here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m getting out of The</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="5.31">Associated Press this was put up by The</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="4.53">Washington Post and it says this is</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.229">reporting around the same time here it</text>
  <text start="284.5" dur="5.909">says a person was arrested near White</text>
  <text start="287.319" dur="5.541">House after stopping car and leaving so</text>
  <text start="290.409" dur="4.561">what this story says which seems to be</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="4.51">directly conflicting the story that was</text>
  <text start="294.97" dur="4.199">put up by Xinhua News it says that the</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="3.75">White House and much of 17th Street were</text>
  <text start="299.169" dur="3.301">on lockdown for a time Sunday night as</text>
  <text start="301.12" dur="2.82">authorities arrest a person whose</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="3.629">vehicle stopped in front of a White</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="4.02">House gate in a statement the Secret</text>
  <text start="306.099" dur="3.961">Service says an individual driving a</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="4.56">passenger car stopped at 17th Street and</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="4.53">Pennsylvania Avenue about 8:30 p.m. and</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="3.81">stepped out of the vehicle when the</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="3.66">individual ignored commands to return to</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="4.26">the vehicle officers arrested the person</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="4.949">the Secret Service says the car was</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="4.919">later declared safe president Donald</text>
  <text start="323.199" dur="4.65">Trump was not in the United States at</text>
  <text start="325.509" dur="5.641">the time of the arrest having left for a</text>
  <text start="327.849" dur="5.611">trip to Europe so what I think this</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="5.699">could be is it&amp;#39;s very possible that what</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="5.82">the the Xinhua reporter saw was the the</text>
  <text start="336.849" dur="4.021">Secret Service agents firing and they</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="4.08">could have been firing Leslie will let</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="4.56">less lethal ammunition I&amp;#39;m not sure that</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="3.33">that I mean unless it was a Taser I</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t know how that would sound like a</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="3.42">gun but it might look like it from afar</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="3.809">if you&amp;#39;re watching you know somebody</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="3.39">pull out a weapon and fire they could</text>
  <text start="352.389" dur="3.39">have been firing it they could have</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="4.469">deployed a Taser since we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="355.779" dur="4.561">those details yet I&amp;#39;m just reporting the</text>
  <text start="357.969" dur="3.991">story as it&amp;#39;s breaking here and I think</text>
  <text start="360.34" dur="3.299">we&amp;#39;re going to be learning more as the</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="4.799">Secret Service puts out more statements</text>
  <text start="363.639" dur="5.131">about the event itself but as you guys</text>
  <text start="366.759" dur="5.071">can see here we have conflicting reports</text>
  <text start="368.77" dur="5.929">and it&amp;#39;s hard to tell which one is which</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="5.57">ones giving us the full story</text>
  <text start="374.699" dur="5.53">assuming that Chinese state-run media</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="5.47">wouldn&amp;#39;t you necessarily be my first</text>
  <text start="380.229" dur="6.211">choice to go to find the the breaking</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="5.49">news but what you know what reason would</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="3.93">they have to lie I don&amp;#39;t know that in</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="4.95">this particular case I&amp;#39;m in many other</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="5.219">cases I can tell you there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="6">reasons why they would lie but in this</text>
  <text start="395.589" dur="4.42">particular case yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna leave</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="2.71">this to you guys</text>
  <text start="400.009" dur="3.451">we&amp;#39;re gonna keep updating on the story</text>
  <text start="402.02" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;ll probably be updating it on Twitter</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="3.989">as it comes if more information comes in</text>
  <text start="405.74" dur="4.109">but I thought I would share this with</text>
  <text start="407.449" dur="4.5">you first because it goes hand in hand</text>
  <text start="409.849" dur="6.3">with obviously the clip you saw at the</text>
  <text start="411.949" dur="7.231">beginning of this video which shows the</text>
  <text start="416.149" dur="5.79">daughter of no name making some pretty</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="3.93">severe comments about harming the</text>
  <text start="421.939" dur="3.75">president and then when you put that</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="4.35">into context of you know obviously she</text>
  <text start="425.689" dur="3.331">says right after that she goes oh well</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="3.599">you know you know I&amp;#39;m joking right now</text>
  <text start="429.02" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s all a ha ha ha I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="431.059" dur="4.32">actually mean that but you could see the</text>
  <text start="433.52" dur="4.319">hate the vitriol in her in her</text>
  <text start="435.379" dur="4.65">expression in her demeanor as she spoke</text>
  <text start="437.839" dur="4.95">those words and I think that this is a</text>
  <text start="440.029" dur="5.31">woman who obviously you know feels</text>
  <text start="442.789" dur="5.4">betrayed by whoever I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="445.339" dur="5.491">speculate as to who whether it&amp;#39;s Trump</text>
  <text start="448.189" dur="4.861">or you know herself or her family I</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="4.109">don&amp;#39;t know but I will tell you this when</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="5.19">you hear those those women on that show</text>
  <text start="454.939" dur="4.94">talk the view it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s nails on a</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="4.829">chalkboard for me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="459.879" dur="5.32">unwatchable unbearable because you just</text>
  <text start="463.069" dur="3.6">see right through it so quickly a few</text>
  <text start="465.199" dur="3.51">other things I thought would be</text>
  <text start="466.669" dur="3.54">interesting to cover here so one of the</text>
  <text start="468.709" dur="2.85">Anton&amp;#39;s put together this graphic which</text>
  <text start="470.209" dur="5.07">I thought was perfect because it kind of</text>
  <text start="471.559" dur="5.28">sums up the gist of what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="475.279" dur="4.14">Director of National Intelligence dan</text>
  <text start="476.839" dur="4.531">coates now we already know that Dan</text>

  <text start="481.37" dur="5.149">obviously providing cover for these</text>
  <text start="484.099" dur="5.46">criminals like Brennan and clapper and</text>
  <text start="486.519" dur="4.661">Comey and covering for the Obama</text>

  <text start="493.399" dur="5.3">president and their their coup attempt</text>
  <text start="496.099" dur="5.641">really he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s probably one of the</text>
  <text start="498.699" dur="6.37">kingpins of it all the most unassuming</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="7.859">looking one you know but it goes back to</text>
  <text start="505.069" dur="7.02">this tweet that came out from the office</text>
  <text start="509.599" dur="5.1">of the defense or Department of National</text>

  <text start="521.93" dur="5.79">telling him hey we have some issues here</text>
  <text start="525.17" dur="4.56">and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a lot going on</text>
  <text start="527.72" dur="3.479">behind the scenes right now as you all</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="2.609">can tell but this was a graphic that I</text>
  <text start="531.199" dur="2.701">thought put it all together pretty good</text>
  <text start="532.339" dur="2.911">about you know what</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="4.47">know about coats and everything up to</text>

  <text start="554.96" dur="5.13">of Congress and laid out the fact that</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="5.73">the Obama administration was abusing the</text>

  <text start="571.15" dur="4.75">provides guidelines for unmasking</text>
  <text start="573.65" dur="5.22">meaning when they use these surveillance</text>

  <text start="578.87" dur="6.36">keep Americans identities private now</text>
  <text start="582.34" dur="4.39">what that means is you know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="3.78">tracking a terrorist and they call</text>
  <text start="586.73" dur="4.23">somebody in the United States instead of</text>

  <text start="594.16" dur="4.81">then they&amp;#39;d have to take that and if</text>

  <text start="608.09" dur="4.08">can further investigate this</text>
  <text start="609.71" dur="4.8">whereas what Obama was doing and this is</text>
  <text start="612.17" dur="6">what Admiral Rogers brought to President</text>

  <text start="626.57" dur="6.15">been violating section 702 and abusing</text>

  <text start="637.82" dur="4.44">now to learn more about the hammer I</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="5.85">encourage everyone to go over to the the</text>
  <text start="642.26" dur="5.94">American report dot org read the work of</text>
  <text start="645.89" dur="5.46">Mary Fanning and Alan Jones and you will</text>
  <text start="648.2" dur="5.55">soon come to see that there was a super</text>
  <text start="651.35" dur="4.32">surveillance tool called the hammer this</text>
  <text start="653.75" dur="4.95">was uncovered in WikiLeaks the vault</text>
  <text start="655.67" dur="6">seven dump and it was h AMR was the</text>

  <text start="661.67" dur="5.16">common nomenclature for it was just the</text>
  <text start="663.92" dur="3.66">hammer and the whistleblower patriot</text>
  <text start="666.83" dur="4.259">Dennis mom</text>
  <text start="667.58" dur="5.939">came forward and exposed the fact that</text>
  <text start="671.089" dur="5.521">the Obama administration was abusing the</text>
  <text start="673.519" dur="6.091">super surveillance tool to spy on and</text>
  <text start="676.61" dur="5.789">get leverage against and blackmail his</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="5.219">political opponents and allegedly</text>
  <text start="682.399" dur="5.88">according to the whistleblower Dennis</text>
  <text start="684.829" dur="5.311">Montgomery who put together this secret</text>
  <text start="688.279" dur="5.131">surveillance system under the direction</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="4.29">of John Brennan for the Obama</text>
  <text start="693.41" dur="5.04">administration</text>
  <text start="694.43" dur="5.67">he claims that not only did he have 47</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="4.079">hard drives worth of evidence which he</text>
  <text start="700.1" dur="6.78">hand-delivered to the FBI Miami field</text>
  <text start="702.529" dur="7.441">office back in 2015 but he also claims</text>
  <text start="706.88" dur="5.579">that this evidence was basically swept</text>
  <text start="709.97" dur="4.619">under the rug and it was never brought</text>
  <text start="712.459" dur="5.13">to public brought to the public before</text>
  <text start="714.589" dur="5.971">the 2016 elections so the FBI under</text>
  <text start="717.589" dur="4.861">James commis direction was actively</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="4.29">seeking to cover up evidence which would</text>
  <text start="722.45" dur="4.92">show that the Obama administration was</text>
  <text start="724.85" dur="6.72">illegally abusing the surveillance tools</text>
  <text start="727.37" dur="7.83">which they had allegedly stolen from the</text>
  <text start="731.57" dur="6.12">NSA and this goes all the way back into</text>
  <text start="735.2" dur="5.879">Edward Snowden how is he involved well</text>
  <text start="737.69" dur="8.1">Edward Snowden released what we saw when</text>
  <text start="741.079" dur="6.75">he stole that information from the NSA</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="3.03">and then we had the WikiLeaks dropping</text>
  <text start="747.829" dur="3.57">vault seven where they actually</text>
  <text start="748.82" dur="6">uncovered this hammer program which</text>
  <text start="751.399" dur="5.13">actually existed so these individuals</text>
  <text start="754.82" dur="4.769">are guilty of one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="756.529" dur="5.701">cover-up Severin Coates definitely had</text>
  <text start="759.589" dur="5.341">to have been in on it and he has to be</text>
  <text start="762.23" dur="5.9">in on the cover-up and right now there</text>
  <text start="764.93" dur="6.21">is a military operation being run it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="768.13" dur="6.61">going on as we speak and I think it has</text>
  <text start="771.14" dur="6.72">a lot to do with the Q Anan phenomena</text>
  <text start="774.74" dur="5.31">but regardless what we&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="777.86" dur="3.87">through investigative work on this</text>
  <text start="780.05" dur="4.17">channel and other channels and through</text>
  <text start="781.73" dur="3.419">the Q research and all that we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="785.149" dur="4.861">investigation being conducted internally</text>
  <text start="787.459" dur="4.74">and the military has gotten involved</text>
  <text start="790.01" dur="4.199">there have been multiple declarations of</text>
  <text start="792.199" dur="4.5">emergencies which give the president</text>
  <text start="794.209" dur="5.82">special powers to activate the u.s.</text>
  <text start="796.699" dur="4.461">military and I think right now we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="800.029" dur="6.921">the middle of</text>
  <text start="801.16" dur="7.8">to uncover this incredible abuse of</text>

  <text start="808.96" dur="3.78">to understand and I&amp;#39;d like to clear this</text>

  <text start="833.29" dur="5.19">agencies in our country but then also</text>
  <text start="835.81" dur="5.46">bolstered by corrupt politicians and big</text>
  <text start="838.48" dur="6.78">text censors who just are all in the</text>
  <text start="841.27" dur="5.82">same cabal of evil well I think what</text>
  <text start="845.26" dur="6.24">folks have to understand and in truth</text>
  <text start="847.09" dur="6.78">and not most truth is we have to take</text>
  <text start="851.5" dur="4.14">this in stages this as I believe the top</text>
  <text start="853.87" dur="5.31">layer this is the the first stage in</text>
  <text start="855.64" dur="5.91">exposing this we have to at least free</text>
  <text start="859.18" dur="4.11">up the president from this constant</text>
  <text start="861.55" dur="4.35">barrage that he&amp;#39;s getting on a daily</text>
  <text start="863.29" dur="4.71">basis where you have you have the fake</text>
  <text start="865.9" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s media with their lies you have</text>

  <text start="870.28" dur="4.68">news media to spread more disinformation</text>
  <text start="872.14" dur="6.2">then you have the big text censors who</text>
  <text start="874.96" dur="7.83">basically choke out and suppress any</text>

  <text start="903.88" dur="3.42">what the country would look like ladies</text>
  <text start="905.5" dur="5.34">and gentlemen I posit to you this</text>

  <text start="910.84" dur="3.81">look like today if the press if</text>
  <text start="913" dur="3.63">President Trump had never been accused</text>
  <text start="914.65" dur="3.66">of this fake Russia collusion hoax which</text>
  <text start="916.63" dur="3.57">we know was fake and we know was made by</text>
  <text start="918.31" dur="4.71">Hillary Clinton as an oppo research try</text>
  <text start="920.2" dur="4.41">to they used it to try to win the 2016</text>
  <text start="923.02" dur="4.17">election and then it turned into the</text>
  <text start="924.61" dur="4.11">insurance policy when they lost imagine</text>
  <text start="927.19" dur="4.13">if that had never happened imagine if</text>
  <text start="928.72" dur="5.7">the media was objective and fair-minded</text>
  <text start="931.32" dur="5.5">imagine if the politicians were</text>
  <text start="934.42" dur="4.25">speaker truth-tellers and not just</text>
  <text start="936.82" dur="4.83">bought and paid for</text>
  <text start="938.67" dur="4.36">cronies who literally you know when you</text>
  <text start="941.65" dur="3.66">look at this situation some of these</text>
  <text start="943.03" dur="4.47">congressmen have none of them have term</text>
  <text start="945.31" dur="4.56">limits so they&amp;#39;ve been there for decades</text>
  <text start="947.5" dur="5.4">and they&amp;#39;ve been bought and paid for by</text>
  <text start="949.87" dur="5.46">every NGO and special interest group in</text>
  <text start="952.9" dur="5.63">the country so they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="955.33" dur="5.85">incapable of running government</text>
  <text start="958.53" dur="4.99">objectively and fairly because they have</text>
  <text start="961.18" dur="4.46">so many either they&amp;#39;ve either either</text>
  <text start="963.52" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;ve been blackmailed or they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="965.64" dur="5.2">corrupted or they&amp;#39;re just you know</text>
  <text start="968.35" dur="5.25">completely complicit or they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="970.84" dur="6.96">occasional Cortes just naive and just</text>
  <text start="973.6" dur="6.15">out there in la-la land but whatever the</text>
  <text start="977.8" dur="3.6">case is our government is is so</text>
  <text start="979.75" dur="4.38">ineffective in that regard</text>
  <text start="981.4" dur="5.1">that this is the only way we can do it</text>
  <text start="984.13" dur="4.53">you have to have an alternative to the</text>
  <text start="986.5" dur="4.23">media which is not to say that that</text>
  <text start="988.66" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re using alternative facts no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s not even like that we&amp;#39;re taking a</text>
  <text start="992.83" dur="4.59">logical approach to the facts that exist</text>
  <text start="994.69" dur="4.89">and we&amp;#39;re piecing it together in a way</text>
  <text start="997.42" dur="3.81">that that people go WOW actually that</text>
  <text start="999.58" dur="3.68">makes sense it&amp;#39;s like I was watching</text>
  <text start="1001.23" dur="4.59">this interview with Chris Wallace and</text>
  <text start="1003.26" dur="4.42">representative Doug Collins and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1005.82" dur="4.53">that it&amp;#39;s the biggest joke you ever saw</text>
  <text start="1007.68" dur="3.56">in your life I mean in this interview</text>
  <text start="1010.35" dur="3.6">right</text>
  <text start="1011.24" dur="4.99">you actually have Chris Wallace here</text>
  <text start="1013.95" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;s positing these he&amp;#39;s giving these</text>
  <text start="1016.23" dur="4.59">questions to Doug Collins and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1018.3" dur="4.11">almost as if he&amp;#39;s either completely</text>
  <text start="1020.82" dur="3.78">ignorant of how our judicial system</text>
  <text start="1022.41" dur="5.039">works and how this whole investigation</text>
  <text start="1024.6" dur="4.41">has gone from day one or it&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1027.449" dur="3.39">trying to do some sort of devils</text>
  <text start="1029.01" dur="6.09">advocate thing but it just completely</text>
  <text start="1030.839" dur="6.331">fails to really work because for every</text>
  <text start="1035.1" dur="4.979">question that he asks in this interview</text>
  <text start="1037.17" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s an you know an obvious logical</text>
  <text start="1040.079" dur="4.921">response based on fact and the rule of</text>
  <text start="1042.18" dur="3.99">law in the Constitution so and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1045" dur="2.97">leave a link to it because it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1046.17" dur="3.78">stuff that we already don&amp;#39;t covered here</text>
  <text start="1047.97" dur="3.6">on the channel ad nauseam but some of</text>
  <text start="1049.95" dur="3.96">the questions that Mike will our Chris</text>
  <text start="1051.57" dur="5.88">Wallace asks are just like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1053.91" dur="5.88">completely asinine that they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="1057.45" dur="3.84">he&amp;#39;s basically and you know I hate to</text>
  <text start="1059.79" dur="3.12">use the term that they use but they use</text>
  <text start="1061.29" dur="3.54">it against us you know he&amp;#39;s carrying</text>
  <text start="1062.91" dur="4.38">water for the leftists who want to</text>
  <text start="1064.83" dur="3.21">impeach Trump and saying don&amp;#39;t you see</text>
  <text start="1067.29" dur="4.35">that</text>
  <text start="1068.04" dur="5.94">Muller was just saying that you know he</text>
  <text start="1071.64" dur="3.63">if he had had the evidence to prove that</text>
  <text start="1073.98" dur="2.52">he was that president Truong was</text>
  <text start="1075.27" dur="3.21">innocent he would have brought it</text>
  <text start="1076.5" dur="4.65">forward but he didn&amp;#39;t and that he</text>
  <text start="1078.48" dur="5.76">couldn&amp;#39;t you know prosecute President</text>
  <text start="1081.15" dur="5.64">Trump because you know the policies that</text>
  <text start="1084.24" dur="5.22">were in place at the DOJ about in dining</text>
  <text start="1086.79" dur="4.62">a sitting president two things there</text>
  <text start="1089.46" dur="3.96">Democrat left his talking points which</text>

  <text start="1095.79" dur="5.73">not true first of all you take the</text>
  <text start="1099.21" dur="5.52">statement that robert muller said he was</text>
  <text start="1101.52" dur="5.82">basically inciting the democrats to</text>
  <text start="1104.73" dur="5.1">impeach president Trump because his</text>

  <text start="1112.23" dur="6.3">able to find evidence to exonerate him</text>
  <text start="1114.69" dur="6.93">of his presumed guilt therefore because</text>
  <text start="1118.53" dur="6.63">of DOJ policies we were not able to</text>
  <text start="1121.62" dur="5.91">actually file an indictment how does</text>
  <text start="1125.16" dur="4.14">that make sense in any world that these</text>
