  <text start="813.279" dur="5.1">President Trump or the individuals who</text>
  <text start="816.429" dur="3.33">are calling president from a racist are</text>
  <text start="818.379" dur="4.02">ignoring the fact that he has a history</text>

  <text start="822.399" dur="5.85">as they had endorsed him and he endorsed</text>
  <text start="824.979" dur="5.37">them yet now today it&amp;#39;s the narrative is</text>

  <text start="855.219" dur="4.05">I don&amp;#39;t think that anything President</text>

  <text start="859.269" dur="4.89">with this if you guys haven&amp;#39;t seen it</text>
  <text start="861.549" dur="5.43">yet I&amp;#39;ve done a whole podcast on the new</text>
  <text start="864.159" dur="5.01">channel about it the new podcast channel</text>
  <text start="866.979" dur="4.71">about this particular incident where a</text>
  <text start="869.169" dur="4.98">president Trump basically just got on</text>
  <text start="871.689" dur="4.47">Twitter and gave a speech and said what</text>
  <text start="874.149" dur="4.37">was on his mind and pointed out the fact</text>
  <text start="876.159" dur="4.91">that these people are engaged in</text>
  <text start="878.519" dur="4.84">anti-american rhetoric and they</text>
  <text start="881.069" dur="5.08">presumably seem to hate our country and</text>
  <text start="883.359" dur="6.57">seem to have favourable opinions toward</text>
  <text start="886.149" dur="7.23">organizations like al Qaeda and it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="889.929" dur="5.82">me I didn&amp;#39;t find anything racist about</text>
  <text start="893.379" dur="4.05">that I thought it was that&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="895.749" dur="3.36">about people being anti-american has</text>
  <text start="897.429" dur="4.291">nothing to do with your race the fact</text>
  <text start="899.109" dur="5.28">that they brought up race is really the</text>
  <text start="901.72" dur="4.139">problem they are the racists this is</text>
  <text start="904.389" dur="4.14">something I&amp;#39;ve been saying for so long</text>
  <text start="905.859" dur="4.111">yet it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to resonate with</text>
  <text start="908.529" dur="3.81">anybody in the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="909.97" dur="3.719">don&amp;#39;t seem to understand that when they</text>
  <text start="912.339" dur="3.15">write all these hit pieces about</text>
  <text start="913.689" dur="3.39">President tromping home a racist and</text>
  <text start="915.489" dur="3.48">call people who support president Trump</text>
  <text start="917.079" dur="3.33">white nationalists and they make it</text>
  <text start="918.969" dur="6.15">about race they&amp;#39;re the ones who are in</text>
  <text start="920.409" dur="6.3">fact racists like I really see on this</text>
  <text start="925.119" dur="5.91">side of the movement people who are</text>
  <text start="926.709" dur="6.031">using races as a you know as a way to</text>
  <text start="931.029" dur="4.081">attack people</text>
  <text start="932.74" dur="4.17">I mean I think that we all here are on</text>
  <text start="935.11" dur="3.81">the this side of the the issue</text>
  <text start="936.91" dur="4.739">especially the people who are here on</text>
  <text start="938.92" dur="5.31">this channel see past race and</text>
  <text start="941.649" dur="3.961">understand that it&amp;#39;s about the content</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="5.22">of your character not your immutable</text>
  <text start="945.61" dur="6.99">characteristics but you know because I</text>
  <text start="949.45" dur="4.77">think there&amp;#39;s a lower IQ quotient the</text>
  <text start="952.6" dur="3.929">intelligence quotient on the the right</text>
  <text start="954.22" dur="7.2">or the left I should say and that they</text>
  <text start="956.529" dur="7.231">are involved in you know different in my</text>
  <text start="961.42" dur="4.919">opinion anti-american practices for</text>
  <text start="963.76" dur="5.76">different reasons some may just be</text>
  <text start="966.339" dur="5.25">corrupt some may be you know have some</text>
  <text start="969.52" dur="4.77">sort of dirt on them some may you know</text>
  <text start="971.589" dur="4.321">just be ignorant it is what it is the</text>
  <text start="974.29" dur="4.109">point is that they engage in this on a</text>
  <text start="975.91" dur="5.58">regular basis and then they project onto</text>
  <text start="978.399" dur="5.611">us their actions their you know racist</text>
  <text start="981.49" dur="6.8">tendencies and it&amp;#39;s pretty disturbing so</text>
  <text start="984.01" dur="8.639">yeah that was the whole thing you know</text>
  <text start="988.29" dur="6.43">think for yourself see the truth was</text>
  <text start="992.649" dur="5.971">this started as a new false racist</text>
  <text start="994.72" dur="5.73">narrative yeah probably I mean they only</text>
  <text start="998.62" dur="3.39">have so many ways they can spin what</text>
  <text start="1000.45" dur="3.96">President Trump does when he comes out</text>
  <text start="1002.01" dur="4.35">and speaks like what most people are</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="3.09">thinking right most people are thinking</text>
  <text start="1006.36" dur="3.54">yes</text>
  <text start="1007.5" dur="4.17">it is really weird and sad where you</text>
  <text start="1009.9" dur="3.3">have a member of Congress openly talking</text>
  <text start="1011.67" dur="4.02">about how much they hate this country</text>
  <text start="1013.2" dur="4.29">and have disdain for it and how they</text>
  <text start="1015.69" dur="2.82">love and their chest perks up when they</text>
  <text start="1017.49" dur="3.12">talk about al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1018.51" dur="3.48">and how they think that&amp;#39;s cool and their</text>
  <text start="1020.61" dur="4.829">their chest the shoulders slouched down</text>
  <text start="1021.99" dur="4.74">when they talk about America I mean to</text>
  <text start="1025.439" dur="2.76">me it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re just pointing out</text>
  <text start="1026.73" dur="3.12">this person obviously doesn&amp;#39;t like our</text>
  <text start="1028.199" dur="3.601">country and they are serving in the</text>
  <text start="1029.85" dur="4.41">Congress and they absolutely hate it and</text>
  <text start="1031.8" dur="8.07">they want to see it in my opinion</text>
  <text start="1034.26" dur="10.34">basically dismantled and I just there</text>
  <text start="1039.87" dur="4.73">you go so yeah</text>
  <text start="1044.97" dur="3.39">here it is I mean you have NBC News who</text>
  <text start="1047.13" dur="3.27">comes out and what they do is they just</text>
  <text start="1048.36" dur="3.12">they they forward this narrative and</text>
  <text start="1050.4" dur="3.54">they say the agenda of white</text>
  <text start="1051.48" dur="5.58">nationalists aoc other congressmen</text>
  <text start="1053.94" dur="5.34">respond to Trump&amp;#39;s tax and they portray</text>
  <text start="1057.06" dur="3.84">these women as the victims of a racist</text>
  <text start="1059.28" dur="4.68">attacked by President Trump when the</text>
  <text start="1060.9" dur="5.52">reality is we&amp;#39;re discussing these</text>
  <text start="1063.96" dur="4.35">individuals and their policy views and</text>
  <text start="1066.42" dur="3.8">their views about this country it has</text>
  <text start="1068.31" dur="4.53">nothing to do with the race as I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1070.22" dur="5.41">10,000 times now but the media will not</text>
  <text start="1072.84" dur="5.22">let it go and so that was interesting</text>
  <text start="1075.63" dur="3.81">now in other news let&amp;#39;s look at this do</text>
  <text start="1078.06" dur="2.76">you guys remember cute told us that</text>
  <text start="1079.44" dur="3.66">there was something coming with Planned</text>
  <text start="1080.82" dur="4.77">Parenthood a few days ago talking about</text>
  <text start="1083.1" dur="3.96">how Planned Parenthood was next and here</text>
  <text start="1085.59" dur="5.07">we have this story that just broke today</text>
  <text start="1087.06" dur="5.04">about the latest firing of a Planned</text>
  <text start="1090.66" dur="2.97">Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1092.1" dur="4.35">so I guess this person who&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1093.63" dur="6.62">president Leanna when was ousted by the</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="6.69">organization or aborted if you will I</text>
  <text start="1100.25" dur="8.02">know that&amp;#39;s pretty dark humor but it</text>
  <text start="1103.14" dur="8.91">seems to apply to this right she was</text>
  <text start="1108.27" dur="6.24">basically fired from her job as the</text>
  <text start="1112.05" dur="3.78">president of Planned Parenthood and Q</text>
  <text start="1114.51" dur="3.53">told us that there was going to be big</text>
  <text start="1115.83" dur="4.8">news about Planned Parenthood coming and</text>
  <text start="1118.04" dur="5.77">yeah so a few days after Q says that</text>
  <text start="1120.63" dur="5.91">they announced that lianna when has been</text>
  <text start="1123.81" dur="4.32">fired why do you think she has been</text>
  <text start="1126.54" dur="4.62">fired well if you read the story talks</text>
  <text start="1128.13" dur="6.24">about how they were actually negotiating</text>
  <text start="1131.16" dur="6.3">behind closed doors about her leaving</text>
  <text start="1134.37" dur="4.95">the organization but the company went</text>
  <text start="1137.46" dur="5.25">behind her back and had a secret meeting</text>
  <text start="1139.32" dur="5.91">and let go of her because of</text>
  <text start="1142.71" dur="5.49">philosophical differences about how to</text>
  <text start="1145.23" dur="4.8">fight back against abortion opponents so</text>
  <text start="1148.2" dur="4.23">I have a feeling that she&amp;#39;s been let go</text>
  <text start="1150.03" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;ve basically president</text>
  <text start="1152.43" dur="3.42">Trump&amp;#39;s gone all in he&amp;#39;s just got a</text>
  <text start="1154.05" dur="5.52">court ruling saying I believe it was a</text>
  <text start="1155.85" dur="5.67">court ruling that said that defunding</text>
  <text start="1159.57" dur="4.35">Planned Parenthood is constitutional</text>
  <text start="1161.52" dur="3.39">because of the president has that right</text>
  <text start="1163.92" dur="4.05">to do that</text>
  <text start="1164.91" dur="4.89">so obviously the people running this</text>
  <text start="1167.97" dur="4.14">organization are realizing that</text>
  <text start="1169.8" dur="3.99">President Trump and the will of the</text>
  <text start="1172.11" dur="3.72">American people are shutting down their</text>
  <text start="1173.79" dur="3.8">little racket that they are running</text>
  <text start="1175.83" dur="3.44">inside of our government where you</text>
  <text start="1177.59" dur="4.5">politicians that would lobby for money</text>
  <text start="1179.27" dur="4.409">to go to Planned Parenthood and then</text>
  <text start="1182.09" dur="3.66">Planned Parenthood takes a portion of</text>
  <text start="1183.679" dur="4.711">that money millions of dollars and puts</text>
  <text start="1185.75" dur="5.25">it back into Congress and it just can it</text>
  <text start="1188.39" dur="4.47">creates this self feeding cycle where it</text>
  <text start="1191" dur="3.99">never ends and Planned Parenthood just</text>
  <text start="1192.86" dur="4.53">gets bigger and the bureaucracy around</text>
  <text start="1194.99" dur="4.14">it just gets more bloated and yeah</text>
  <text start="1197.39" dur="3.899">that&amp;#39;s what President Trump put a stop</text>
  <text start="1199.13" dur="3.69">to obviously we&amp;#39;re seeing this happening</text>
  <text start="1201.289" dur="2.971">not to mention the fact that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1202.82" dur="4.29">investigations that have been going on</text>
  <text start="1204.26" dur="5.61">since 2017 I believe into the way that</text>
  <text start="1207.11" dur="5.22">Planned Parenthood was selling parts of</text>
  <text start="1209.87" dur="4.439">fetuses aborted fetuses this is really</text>
  <text start="1212.33" dur="4.89">disturbing and sick topic but it</text>
  <text start="1214.309" dur="4.771">certainly warrants a another look now</text>
  <text start="1217.22" dur="4.38">the next story here I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1219.08" dur="3.93">is back to Illinois on Omar and this is</text>
  <text start="1221.6" dur="4.11">coming out from the gateway pundit you</text>

  <text start="1295.37" dur="2.88">Voters and what I thought was</text>
  <text start="1296.75" dur="4.2">fascinating is they use a picture here</text>

  <text start="1418.52" dur="4.62">take this to the bank about them they</text>
