  <text start="198.22" dur="4.44">president Trump&amp;#39;s administration and</text>
  <text start="200.02" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s become quite a distraction and a</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="4.92">great talking point for the leftist the</text>

  <text start="236.17" dur="6.33">investigate that that guilty people</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="6.23">don&amp;#39;t call investigations into their own</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="6.63">crimes okay but the media is is just</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re so used to playing these mental</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="4.53">gymnastics that they literally are just</text>

  <text start="253.66" dur="4.44">the truth I guess there you go and Q</text>
  <text start="256.63" dur="2.52">gives us this link to this fox news</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="3.48">article talking about the labor</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="4.14">secretary Acosta announcing he will step</text>
  <text start="261.58" dur="5.53">down and made criticism over Epstein</text>
  <text start="263.29" dur="5.83">plea deal so as you guys saw</text>
  <text start="267.11" dur="5.25">President Trump did have a press</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="5.82">conference with Alexander Acosta this</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="4.35">this afternoon morning whatever where</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="3.9">Alexander basically announced that he</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="4.609">was going to be resigning because of the</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="5.46">distraction that has come with the</text>
  <text start="281.319" dur="4.451">criticism of his deal with Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="2.64">Epstein which yes it was a terrible deal</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="4.139">but I&amp;#39;ve said this before and I&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="4.409">it again basically and in the stories</text>
  <text start="289.909" dur="3.781">have come out basically showing this</text>
  <text start="291.349" dur="4.021">there were people higher up than</text>
  <text start="293.69" dur="3.689">Alexander Acosta who were telling him to</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="4.889">leave it alone now originally I think I</text>
  <text start="297.379" dur="4.741">thought it was the the AG under Obama</text>
  <text start="300.259" dur="5.791">one of his first ones but is actually</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="6.479">the one of the later AG&amp;#39;s for Bush who</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="4.29">made the deal was Alberto Gonzalez but</text>
  <text start="308.599" dur="3.961">either way the point is the same</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="4.799">gonzales went to him or somebody higher</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="4.68">up then Acosta and said look this guy</text>
  <text start="315.139" dur="4.441">Epstein&amp;#39;s intelligence and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="3.239">give them a good deal because it&amp;#39;s a way</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="2.399">above your pay grade</text>
  <text start="320.479" dur="4.171">there are there stories out there to</text>
  <text start="321.979" dur="3.961">talk about this and I&amp;#39;ve said that from</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="3.06">the beginning and President Trump</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="4.259">brought him on probably just thinking</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="4.29">exactly what Q is saying here I mean how</text>
  <text start="330.199" dur="3.78">do you feel your administration if the</text>
  <text start="332" dur="5.039">majority of the people in politics are</text>
  <text start="333.979" dur="5.401">corrupt so that&amp;#39;s really the question</text>
  <text start="337.039" dur="3.99">and so sometimes you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="3.21">work with some of these people and they</text>
  <text start="341.029" dur="4.04">may not be the most corrupt individuals</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="4.62">but obviously if you&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="345.069" dur="4.331">ignoring the the integrity of your</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="4.679">office and letting higher-ups tell you</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="4.949">that just because somebody&amp;#39;s involved in</text>
  <text start="351.889" dur="4.441">intelligence that they are untouchable</text>
  <text start="354.349" dur="4.16">and shouldn&amp;#39;t be prosecuted obviously</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s a dereliction of your duty so</text>
  <text start="358.509" dur="4.421">look this is what we have this is the</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="4.11">end result so you guys see it for what</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="3.84">it is now I just thought I&amp;#39;d bring it up</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="2.94">now the next one here is fascinating it</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="3.48">talks about the New York Society for the</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="3.929">Prevention of Cruelty to Children and</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s in the metaphorical kill box here</text>
  <text start="372.169" dur="4.921">which is just bold and brackets and you</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="3.75">know doing a little digging on this is</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="4.199">some very suspicious stuff that some of</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="3.599">the Anton&amp;#39;s are pointing out first of</text>
  <text start="381.289" dur="4.41">all here is the actual website for this</text>
  <text start="382.969" dur="4.591">place it&amp;#39;s the New York Society for the</text>
  <text start="385.699" dur="3.84">Prevention of Cruelty to Children and I</text>
  <text start="387.56" dur="3.63">think one of the most ironic things is</text>
  <text start="389.539" dur="4.651">that most a lot of these organizations</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="5.759">you know will have their stated goal be</text>
  <text start="394.19" dur="5.63">exactly what the the higher-ups may or</text>
  <text start="396.949" dur="4.191">may not be into and that is</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="2.7">something that is disturbing and sick</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="3.06">you go through this website they talk</text>
  <text start="402.52" dur="5.7">about all this stuff one of the interns</text>
  <text start="404.2" dur="7.02">pointed this little doozy out though if</text>
  <text start="408.22" dur="5.78">I may it is this the fact that they were</text>
  <text start="411.22" dur="6.18">holding one of their main events back in</text>
  <text start="414" dur="6.16">September of 2019 called under the stars</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="4.41">at the standard hotel man we all know</text>
  <text start="420.16" dur="4.11">the history of the standard hotel cues</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="4.53">mentioned the one out in Los Angeles is</text>
  <text start="424.27" dur="4.79">being connected to Adam Schiff and</text>
  <text start="426.34" dur="6.81">Rachel Chandler and some other pretty</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="6.25">disturbing things as far as disturbing</text>
  <text start="433.15" dur="5.79">disturbing accusations and allegations</text>
  <text start="435.31" dur="5.67">of sexual misconduct and trafficking and</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="3.51">abuse that would be going on and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.98" dur="2.64">interesting about the standard hotel as</text>
  <text start="442.45" dur="4.2">well</text>
  <text start="443.62" dur="5.16">their symbol is this upside down you</text>
  <text start="446.65" dur="3.72">know sign that says the standard but</text>
  <text start="448.78" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s upside down and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="5.52">Anton&amp;#39;s broke that down to say that you</text>
  <text start="453.58" dur="4.65">know it is just like a satanic in nature</text>
  <text start="455.89" dur="4.65">hotel because they believe in that you</text>
  <text start="458.23" dur="3.48">know I think it&amp;#39;s like as above so below</text>
  <text start="460.54" dur="4.2">type thing</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="4.77">where it talks about you know the you</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="5.34">know basically it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s satanic</text>
  <text start="466.48" dur="5.82">worship at its best and you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="4.26">a reason why they would have this symbol</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="4.05">upside down it&amp;#39;s not by accidents by</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="4.55">design and these people are into some</text>
  <text start="476.35" dur="5.13">really sick and disturbing stuff so</text>
  <text start="478.89" dur="6.19">that&amp;#39;s something that I wanted to point</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="5.73">out as well as this story so if you guys</text>
  <text start="485.08" dur="5.22">remember this Chris Cornell committed</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="4.37">suicide very sadly right after chester</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="3.69">bennington</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.38">or actually before or after i&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="5.19">sure if it was before I think was he</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="3.84">Chris Cornell committed suicide before</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="3.63">Chester bangtan&amp;#39;s so who was Chris</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="5.19">Cornell who was Chester Bennington Chris</text>
  <text start="502.81" dur="5.61">Cornell was a famous music musician the</text>
  <text start="505.99" dur="4.23">- I think bands that he was a very</text>
  <text start="508.42" dur="4.47">famous for were Audioslave and</text>
  <text start="510.22" dur="5.1">Soundgarden I believe 90s music kind of</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="8.76">and then chester bennington was the lead</text>
  <text start="515.32" dur="9.12">singer I believe for the the yeah of</text>
  <text start="521.65" dur="4.62">course Linkin Park and there&amp;#39;s been so</text>
  <text start="524.44" dur="3.87">many rumors about his death which was</text>
  <text start="526.27" dur="6.09">very untimely a suicide that happened</text>
  <text start="528.31" dur="5.49">and people have basically you know tied</text>
  <text start="532.36" dur="4.17">these two</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="4.14">incidences together and there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="2.79">lot of speculation now if you look at</text>
  <text start="537.94" dur="3.18">this picture this is a good picture to</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="3.66">kind of illustrate something and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="4.26">show you guys by getting you a</text>
  <text start="542.98" dur="5.31">side-by-side here I can probably just do</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="4.74">it real quick and we&amp;#39;ll show you what</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="4.26">the side-by-side is a lot of people were</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="4.44">basically saying is it possible that</text>
  <text start="552.55" dur="6.72">Chester Bennington was somehow related</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="6.78">to jet or to John Podesta so this is</text>
  <text start="559.27" dur="3.66">just a whole nother rabbit hole to dive</text>
  <text start="561.34" dur="4.11">down we&amp;#39;re not really going to do that</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="3.9">here but what&amp;#39;s interesting that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="4.35">brought up by the graphic that they</text>
  <text start="566.83" dur="6.87">Anton shared was that when Chris Cornell</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="6.66">was found dead with a read exercise band</text>
  <text start="573.7" dur="5.61">apparently having killed himself then a</text>
  <text start="576.46" dur="5.85">year later the Anton&amp;#39;s were pointing out</text>
  <text start="579.31" dur="6.09">that Vicky Cornell his his wife now</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="4.74">widow was appointed to the children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.4" dur="5.28">Council of New York Society for the</text>
  <text start="587.05" dur="4.86">Prevention of Cruelty to Children and if</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="3.54">Q is telling us to look at this</text>
  <text start="591.91" dur="4.23">organization then possibly we need to</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="3.69">start investigating this again go back</text>
  <text start="596.14" dur="4.05">and look at Chester Bennington and Chris</text>
  <text start="597.91" dur="4.47">Cornell Cornell and look at Vicky</text>
  <text start="600.19" dur="4.59">Cornell and try to understand how this</text>
  <text start="602.38" dur="4.47">progression happened so that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="604.78" dur="3.57">say as far as what the stories are and</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="3.03">how the Anton&amp;#39;s have been tying it</text>
  <text start="608.35" dur="3.69">together which I appreciate because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="4.53">pretty pretty interesting to look at</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="4.53">that a little bit deeper so I thought</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;d share that the next one here is a</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="4.32">very important one Q saying wheels up</text>
  <text start="618.79" dur="6.54">flight logs classified one through 99</text>
  <text start="620.89" dur="7.98">under investigation by FBI and DOJ q so</text>
  <text start="625.33" dur="6.51">look what we know is that president from</text>
  <text start="628.87" dur="7.14">today as you saw earlier told the press</text>
  <text start="631.84" dur="6.62">explicitly investigate the flight logs</text>
  <text start="636.01" dur="7.2">of Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s private plane and</text>
  <text start="638.46" dur="6.97">find out who went to his private island</text>
  <text start="643.21" dur="5.76">Epstein Island little st. James in the</text>
  <text start="645.43" dur="6.12">Virgin Islands that&amp;#39;s pretty simple now</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="3.9">if you look at it a lot of the travel</text>
  <text start="651.55" dur="3.48">and trips that that seem to be</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="4.86">highlighted are things like you pointed</text>
  <text start="655.03" dur="5.19">out tests where they go to Punta Cana</text>
  <text start="657.73" dur="4.98">which is in the Dominican Republic which</text>
  <text start="660.22" dur="4.11">is kind of like near the st. James you</text>
  <text start="662.71" dur="4.33">could probably catch a boat or something</text>
  <text start="664.33" dur="3.55">to the island if you wanted to so</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="1.979">that&amp;#39;s something I thought was</text>
  <text start="667.88" dur="3">interesting and that&amp;#39;s how they would</text>
  <text start="669.019" dur="5.281">probably travel you know between islands</text>
  <text start="670.88" dur="6.209">and but you have to figure out who was</text>
  <text start="674.3" dur="4.44">actually involved here&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="677.089" dur="3.3">somebody put together over on the board</text>
  <text start="678.74" dur="3.81">which I thought was kind of fascinating</text>
  <text start="680.389" dur="3.661">it&amp;#39;s basically I&amp;#39;ve got I haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="682.55" dur="3.87">able to verify every name on this list</text>
  <text start="684.05" dur="4.92">but it&amp;#39;s a running list of people from</text>
  <text start="686.42" dur="4.32">the epstein flight logs now you see</text>
  <text start="688.97" dur="4.14">people like Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="690.74" dur="5.459">Naomi Campbell Kevin Spacey Alan</text>
  <text start="693.11" dur="5.399">Dershowitz Sophie Biddle Larry and Lisa</text>
  <text start="696.199" dur="6.051">summers mark Lloyd at Tuttle Prince</text>
  <text start="698.509" dur="7.291">Andrew princess Sarah Ferguson and kids</text>
  <text start="702.25" dur="5.829">Chris Tucker and it goes on the list</text>
  <text start="705.8" dur="5.099">goes on and on two more of the</text>
  <text start="708.079" dur="4.471">interesting ones KITT Torah Q told us</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="4.141">about before where Geraldine lay born in</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="5.039">KITT laybourn obviously jail dean</text>
  <text start="715.04" dur="4.109">laybourne was the one who was an exec</text>
  <text start="717.589" dur="3.99">over at Nickelodeon and all these</text>
  <text start="719.149" dur="5.61">different kids TV networks and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="721.579" dur="7.37">involved in the kinder care which is a</text>
  <text start="724.759" dur="4.19">basically it seems like a national</text>
  <text start="729.37" dur="7.649">company that does daycare and for kids</text>
  <text start="733.67" dur="6.12">and Zagat yeah I know that Zagat is the</text>
  <text start="737.019" dur="6.401">like is it got meal guide restaurant</text>
  <text start="739.79" dur="4.109">guide very famous travel person steven</text>
  <text start="743.42" dur="2.279">pinker</text>
  <text start="743.899" dur="3.151">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of names out here I</text>
  <text start="745.699" dur="2.7">think Michael Wolfe is this the same</text>
  <text start="747.05" dur="3.69">Michael Wolfe that wrote the hit piece</text>
  <text start="748.399" dur="4.861">on President Trump that might be</text>
  <text start="750.74" dur="3.99">interesting but you can go through the</text>
  <text start="753.26" dur="3.6">list if you want obviously I&amp;#39;ll leave a</text>
  <text start="754.73" dur="4.65">link to it a lot of these names I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="756.86" dur="5.81">know to be quite honest but a lot of</text>
  <text start="759.38" dur="5.61">them are very familiar so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="762.67" dur="4.029">we have a lot of information that we</text>
  <text start="764.99" dur="3.39">need to go to but here&amp;#39;s a good starting</text>
  <text start="766.699" dur="3.811">point so any mainstream media</text>
  <text start="768.38" dur="4.649">journalists out there who don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="770.51" dur="5.79">be complete liars and peddlers of you</text>
  <text start="773.029" dur="4.591">know propaganda possibly maybe start</text>
  <text start="776.3" dur="3.33">investigating the people who are</text>
  <text start="777.62" dur="4.23">traveling on jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s plane to</text>
  <text start="779.63" dur="4.019">this island possibly start investigating</text>
  <text start="781.85" dur="3.81">what was happening on the island let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="783.649" dur="3.3">start there that should be an easy one</text>
  <text start="785.66" dur="3.989">right there seems to be enough evidence</text>
  <text start="786.949" dur="6.57">to at least start the investigatory work</text>
  <text start="789.649" dur="6.3">right I mean please but anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="793.519" dur="4.021">why we&amp;#39;re here I guess because we are</text>
  <text start="795.949" dur="3.561">the ones that are uncovering this every</text>
  <text start="797.54" dur="3.72">day</text>
  <text start="799.51" dur="3.43">obviously this is</text>
  <text start="801.26" dur="4.41">classify 1 through 99 this is something</text>
  <text start="802.94" dur="6.36">Q says a lot I think it in company it</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="7.13">encompasses an enormous amount of crimes</text>
  <text start="809.3" dur="6.48">that we can&amp;#39;t be told about you know</text>
  <text start="812.8" dur="6.33">explicitly at least on the boards here</text>
  <text start="815.78" dur="7.19">because of obviously that would be a</text>
  <text start="819.13" dur="6.73">violation of policy with regard to</text>
  <text start="822.97" dur="5.17">speaking on ongoing investigations if</text>
  <text start="825.86" dur="4.41">they start listening listing the actual</text>
  <text start="828.14" dur="5.25">crimes out for us who committed what</text>
  <text start="830.27" dur="5.37">when then that would hinder the judicial</text>
  <text start="833.39" dur="4.5">process of trying to get an indictment</text>
  <text start="835.64" dur="4.68">and get a conviction of these</text>
  <text start="837.89" dur="5.16">individuals like we like I said you know</text>
  <text start="840.32" dur="4.14">ongoing investigation so you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="843.05" dur="3.51">comment you&amp;#39;re not supposed to comment</text>
  <text start="844.46" dur="5.52">on an ongoing investigation because it</text>
  <text start="846.56" dur="5.4">could undermine the case itself so this</text>
  <text start="849.98" dur="4.68">is what Q is telling us that we need to</text>
  <text start="851.96" dur="4.23">continue to focus on is this the fact</text>
  <text start="854.66" dur="2.91">that there are all these crimes that</text>
  <text start="856.19" dur="4.05">can&amp;#39;t be mentioned here but are</text>
  <text start="857.57" dur="4.89">happening now I&amp;#39;ve seen some disturbing</text>
  <text start="860.24" dur="4.02">stuff we talked about some disturbing</text>
  <text start="862.46" dur="3.69">things over the last few days with</text>
  <text start="864.26" dur="5.43">regard to everything from Planned</text>
  <text start="866.15" dur="6.57">Parenthood to different examples of</text>
  <text start="869.69" dur="4.65">abuse of in human trafficking and things</text>
  <text start="872.72" dur="4.89">that we&amp;#39;ve uncovered with Epstein and</text>
  <text start="874.34" dur="5.43">nexium but this is what we have to</text>
  <text start="877.61" dur="4.98">confront this is the evil that we are</text>
  <text start="879.77" dur="5.43">standing up to and against and the</text>
  <text start="882.59" dur="4.98">mainstream media has decided to get in</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="4.74">bed with that evil to not talk about it</text>
  <text start="887.57" dur="4.56">to cover it up as best they can because</text>
  <text start="889.94" dur="4.26">believe it or not a lot of them that</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="6.15">they lot of them are involved in this</text>
  <text start="894.2" dur="6.06">evil as well and as unbelievable as that</text>
  <text start="898.28" dur="5.57">may seem that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re up against</text>
  <text start="900.26" dur="6.77">here truly truly despicable and</text>
  <text start="903.85" dur="7.87">disgusting evil that we are up against</text>
  <text start="907.03" dur="6.79">yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s bad the next post here</text>
  <text start="911.72" dur="4.59">obviously saying Muller hearing delayed</text>
  <text start="913.82" dur="4.44">what are the odds of that so I guess it</text>
  <text start="916.31" dur="5.4">was announced today that molars hearing</text>
  <text start="918.26" dur="4.29">is going to be delayed from July 17th to</text>
  <text start="921.71" dur="3.18">a later date</text>
  <text start="922.55" dur="4.35">well what&amp;#39;s fascinating about that is I</text>
  <text start="924.89" dur="5.22">think that was as everything to do with</text>
  <text start="926.9" dur="6.57">what Q pointed out here the I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="930.11" dur="4.83">assume that the leftist extreme leftist</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="3.72">who were calling Mullins</text>
  <text start="934.94" dur="4.71">p-ting him to come testify so they could</text>
  <text start="937.19" dur="6.03">basically have their little show trial</text>
  <text start="939.65" dur="5.16">in the house committee what I think that</text>
  <text start="943.22" dur="5.34">they underestimated was the fact that</text>
  <text start="944.81" dur="5.04">cue it was gonna come back and Q came</text>
  <text start="948.56" dur="3.63">back and basically laid out and said</text>
  <text start="949.85" dur="6.33">yeah we&amp;#39;re very glad that you scheduled</text>
  <text start="952.19" dur="6.96">his testimony for July 17th the same day</text>
  <text start="956.18" dur="5.28">that the b-2 stealth bomber made its</text>
  <text start="959.15" dur="3.78">first flight it&amp;#39;s very possible that</text>
  <text start="961.46" dur="3.69">Muller is gonna say things that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="962.93" dur="4.86">not gonna like and then with that they</text>
  <text start="965.15" dur="4.08">went oh holy moly we made a big mistake</text>
  <text start="967.79" dur="2.82">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to push this back and</text>
  <text start="969.23" dur="3.78">delay it and then maybe hopefully just</text>
  <text start="970.61" dur="6">cancel it altogether that might be it</text>
  <text start="973.01" dur="5.85">not to mention the fact that the if if Q</text>
  <text start="976.61" dur="3.99">is projecting a date right this is</text>
  <text start="978.86" dur="3.74">another beauty of what we do here on the</text>
  <text start="980.6" dur="4.32">boards with Q and all this information</text>
  <text start="982.6" dur="5.8">so Q put the data out there like July</text>
  <text start="984.92" dur="5.58">17th and gives it a meaning by</text>
  <text start="988.4" dur="4.32">associating it with the first slide of</text>
  <text start="990.5" dur="3.99">the b2 which was a stealth bomber which</text>
  <text start="992.72" dur="4.02">then connects to robert muller and</text>
  <text start="994.49" dur="4.53">attorney general bill Barr who would be</text>
  <text start="996.74" dur="5.49">b2 bill Barr</text>
  <text start="999.02" dur="5.49">so making those associations he shows</text>
  <text start="1002.23" dur="4.17">basically that that date has some</text>
  <text start="1004.51" dur="3.66">significance and that it&amp;#39;s gonna have an</text>
  <text start="1006.4" dur="4.08">important impact in a positive way</text>
  <text start="1008.17" dur="5.37">toward what we&amp;#39;re doing here so what do</text>
  <text start="1010.48" dur="5.1">they do in response like you know as</text>
  <text start="1013.54" dur="5.4">predictable as it gets they shift and</text>
  <text start="1015.58" dur="5.28">move the hearing right so I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1018.94" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s moves and</text>
  <text start="1020.86" dur="3.599">countermoves as q would say so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1022.96" dur="3.749">something I thought was fascinating</text>
  <text start="1024.459" dur="5.63">now the next one here is this Twitter</text>
  <text start="1026.709" dur="5.791">post which was from CBS talking about</text>
  <text start="1030.089" dur="4.36">this the post are what I showed you</text>
  <text start="1032.5" dur="4.14">earlier which was President Trump</text>
  <text start="1034.449" dur="3.87">calling out the media and telling them</text>
  <text start="1036.64" dur="4.41">that they need to investigate who was</text>
  <text start="1038.319" dur="5.821">going to this island right that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1041.05" dur="4.35">what is very important and President</text>
  <text start="1044.14" dur="3.42">Trump says that Jeffrey Epstein was</text>
  <text start="1045.4" dur="4.29">somebody that he didn&amp;#39;t respect but more</text>
  <text start="1047.56" dur="4.32">importantly if the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1049.69" dur="3.99">wanted to maybe do its job for once in</text>
  <text start="1051.88" dur="4.23">their lives and not just report</text>
  <text start="1053.68" dur="5.73">propaganda and fake news and the leftist</text>
  <text start="1056.11" dur="5.52">talking point deserve maybe maybe they</text>
  <text start="1059.41" dur="4.14">would actually go and investigate this</text>
  <text start="1061.63" dur="4.71">and try to figure out who went to this</text>
  <text start="1063.55" dur="5.24">island and who was participating in that</text>
  <text start="1066.34" dur="4.04">those activities and maybe even do</text>
  <text start="1068.79" dur="3.12">research into the island itself and</text>
  <text start="1070.38" dur="2.91">maybe looking to the fact that there</text>
  <text start="1071.91" dur="3.09">could have been underground tunnels</text>
  <text start="1073.29" dur="3.6">where it&amp;#39;s been alleged that there was</text>
  <text start="1075" dur="5.37">possibly some sort of satanic cult</text>
  <text start="1076.89" dur="5.97">ritual ISM happening beneath the the</text>
  <text start="1080.37" dur="4.92">surface and that the the topside was</text>
  <text start="1082.86" dur="4.86">basically just an underage sex resort</text>
  <text start="1085.29" dur="4.68">for celebrities and politicians and</text>
  <text start="1087.72" dur="5.28">other people of power which was actually</text>
  <text start="1089.97" dur="4.47">being used against those individuals in</text>
  <text start="1093" dur="4.5">the form of blackmail</text>
  <text start="1094.44" dur="4.86">allegedly so look maybe that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="1097.5" dur="3.09">place to start your stories right</text>
  <text start="1099.3" dur="3.6">because the mainstream media doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1100.59" dur="4.47">seem to want to do the job that they</text>
  <text start="1102.9" dur="4.71">have been tasked with which is reporting</text>
  <text start="1105.06" dur="5.4">news they want to propagandize the story</text>
  <text start="1107.61" dur="5.85">they want to draw the narrative and they</text>
  <text start="1110.46" dur="5.34">want to spin the story as they see fit</text>
  <text start="1113.46" dur="5.04">so you know that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re up against</text>
  <text start="1115.8" dur="4.47">on a daily basis q quotes POTUS</text>
  <text start="1118.5" dur="3.21">President United States Trump saying</text>
  <text start="1120.27" dur="6.57">find out the people that went to the</text>
  <text start="1121.71" dur="6.75">island and Q says anton&amp;#39;s no Q yes we</text>
  <text start="1126.84" dur="4.37">know who went to the island it was a</text>
  <text start="1128.46" dur="5.1">joke watching yesterday</text>
  <text start="1131.21" dur="4.42">basically it was alan dershowitz saying</text>
  <text start="1133.56" dur="3.81">that you know Oh Bill Clinton and I</text>
  <text start="1135.63" dur="3.12">never we never went to the island we</text>
  <text start="1137.37" dur="2.04">never did any of that stuff and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1138.75" dur="3.51">just sitting there</text>
  <text start="1139.41" dur="8.52">it&amp;#39;s almost transparent that the level</text>
  <text start="1142.26" dur="7.62">of you know complicity and corruption</text>
  <text start="1147.93" dur="4.56">that these people are involved in and</text>

  <text start="1650.299" dur="2.911">of each one is episode it&amp;#39;s called God&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1653.21" dur="4.469">God&amp;#39;s grace now it is truly greater for</text>
  <text start="1655.37" dur="4.049">today I&amp;#39;m going to read a piece a piece</text>
  <text start="1657.679" dur="4.801">of scripture out of the book of first</text>
  <text start="1659.419" dur="5.851">Timothy chapter 6 and it&amp;#39;s verse 7</text>
  <text start="1662.48" dur="5.06">through 10 and I want to share these</text>
  <text start="1665.27" dur="6.24">words with you because it talks about</text>
  <text start="1667.54" dur="5.769">understanding our own motivation in life</text>
  <text start="1671.51" dur="3.84">and how we should look at things like</text>
  <text start="1673.309" dur="5.011">money and things that are that are</text>
  <text start="1675.35" dur="4.86">foolish for us to get involved with or</text>
  <text start="1678.32" dur="4.25">to put above God and I really think this</text>
  <text start="1680.21" dur="5.25">is an important verse for us all to hear</text>
  <text start="1682.57" dur="4.9">but it says for we brought nothing into</text>
  <text start="1685.46" dur="4.41">the world and we can take nothing out</text>
  <text start="1687.47" dur="4.56">but if we had if we have food and</text>
  <text start="1689.87" dur="4.23">clothing we will be content with these</text>
  <text start="1692.03" dur="5.19">but those who want to be rich fall into</text>
  <text start="1694.1" dur="5.79">temptation a trap and many foolish and</text>
  <text start="1697.22" dur="5.459">harmful desires which plunge people into</text>
  <text start="1699.89" dur="4.95">ruin to stand destruction for the love</text>
  <text start="1702.679" dur="4.231">of money is a root of all kinds of evil</text>
  <text start="1704.84" dur="3.48">and by craving it some have wandered</text>
  <text start="1706.91" dur="4.6">away from the faith and pierced</text>
  <text start="1708.32" dur="7.9">themselves with many pains</text>
  <text start="1711.51" dur="5.94">so I only bring this up because when we</text>
  <text start="1716.22" dur="4.74">talk about these people like the</text>
  <text start="1717.45" dur="5.82">Epstein&amp;#39;s and nexium one of the common</text>
  <text start="1720.96" dur="4.47">threads between it all is their their</text>
  <text start="1723.27" dur="5.76">wealth these people are millionaires</text>

  <text start="1729.03" dur="6.81">corrupt them and they&amp;#39;ve taken money as</text>
  <text start="1732.12" dur="7.41">as their God you know it says here money</text>
  <text start="1735.84" dur="5.52">is the root of all evil but it really</text>
  <text start="1739.53" dur="5.18">what it&amp;#39;s really saying is it&amp;#39;s the root</text>
  <text start="1741.36" dur="5.97">of all kinds of evils and by craving it</text>
  <text start="1744.71" dur="5.14">some have wandered away from the faith</text>
  <text start="1747.33" dur="5.37">and pierced themselves with many pains</text>
  <text start="1749.85" dur="4.32">now that&amp;#39;s not to say that money in and</text>
  <text start="1752.7" dur="3.39">of itself is evil we can do great things</text>
