  <text start="8.549" dur="4.441">been stories written about a certain</text>
  <text start="10.02" dur="5.279">individual and now and they say he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="12.99" dur="5.07">whistleblower and he&amp;#39;s the whistleblower</text>

  <text start="30.03" dur="4.92">you guys got to release the information</text>
  <text start="31.77" dur="4.68">I think that the House Republicans and</text>

  <text start="36.45" dur="4.02">incredible I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s ever</text>

  <text start="45.989" dur="5.281">negative votes on the whole impeachment</text>
  <text start="48.39" dur="6.45">scam were the Democrats I think Nancy</text>
  <text start="51.27" dur="5.37">Pelosi has lost their mind and I think</text>
  <text start="54.84" dur="4.26">frankly that she should go back home to</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="5.04">San Francisco if you look at what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="76.29" dur="6.54">the Pacific Ocean I think Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="6.42">her district has probably gone down more</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="5.73">than any district proportionately in the</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="5.16">United States and what she&amp;#39;s done and</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="4.11">what she&amp;#39;s done for that district and</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="4.619">then on top of it</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="5.879">you got fires eating away at California</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="4.291">every year because management is so bad</text>
  <text start="98.549" dur="3.541">the government doesn&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;s like a</text>

  <text start="260.23" dur="6.42">far as we know this is the new cue</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="5.68">posting now I guess it&amp;#39;s the same cue</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="5.76">I&amp;#39;m still waiting to hear back from some</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="6.21">people maybe to see if this is all you</text>
  <text start="272.41" dur="5.16">know actually cue because there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="275.59" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s some issues with a coon website</text>
  <text start="277.57" dur="5.909">eight code is up Q&amp;#39;s been posting but</text>
  <text start="281.47" dur="4.949">there are definitely some bugs that are</text>
  <text start="283.479" dur="5.011">being worked out and it seems that the</text>
  <text start="286.419" dur="6.211">websites kind of intermittently working</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="6.239">and all I can I can see from you know my</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="5.009">perspective on what I&amp;#39;m trying to do as</text>
  <text start="294.729" dur="4.651">far as following all this is that you</text>
  <text start="297.639" dur="4.611">can&amp;#39;t really make posts right now it</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="5.22">seems like the boat boards are frozen</text>
  <text start="302.25" dur="4.66">that might just be that they shut them</text>
  <text start="304.6" dur="5.189">off but anyway at some point Q is able</text>
  <text start="306.91" dur="4.02">to get on there and post and a lot of</text>
  <text start="309.789" dur="3.211">people are kind of in a holding pattern</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="5.13">waiting for confirmations on what this</text>
  <text start="313" dur="4.89">who this new Q poster is I&amp;#39;m going to go</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="3.24">ahead and say at least this information</text>
  <text start="317.89" dur="3.74">then we&amp;#39;re gonna cover here today is not</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="6.179">really that controversial as much it is</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="5.71">enlightening and you know we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="3.781">kind of cautiously move forward but I</text>
  <text start="327.34" dur="5.76">can tell you right now it seems as</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="6.99">though this is Q who is posting so with</text>
  <text start="333.1" dur="6.87">that in mind putting that out front as a</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="6.12">caveat for that let&amp;#39;s just kind of get</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="5.67">right into it first of all Q&amp;#39;s last post</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="5.43">was on August 1st 2019 q post three five</text>
  <text start="345.64" dur="5.39">seven zero we&amp;#39;ve been in a holding</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="8.55">pattern since and now 93 days later</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="10.12">exactly Q comes back and post this bas</text>
  <text start="356.35" dur="8.16">test too and I&amp;#39;m assuming that these are</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="5.94">tests being conducted by Q as far as</text>
  <text start="364.51" dur="8.37">testing the security of the new eight</text>
  <text start="367.09" dur="10.44">Coon net platform for you know posting</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="5.61">these drops so what we have right now is</text>
  <text start="377.53" dur="3.87">a</text>
  <text start="378.49" dur="5.609">you basically security tests you know</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="5.51">checking with the board you know</text>
  <text start="384.099" dur="7.85">securing the comms here is just</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="8.53">different security and presumably</text>
  <text start="391.949" dur="6.041">routing configurations I&amp;#39;m not sure a</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="5.52">lot of this is kind of not really meant</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="5.1">for Anton&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s meant for other people</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="4.53">who are running the boards but that</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="5.46">being said obviously the testing the</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="8.489">comms and Q comes back start signing Q</text>

  <text start="416.68" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re just going to kind of take these</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="3.399">with a grain of salt I&amp;#39;m going to talk</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="3.21">about them then we&amp;#39;re going to talk</text>

  <text start="712.07" dur="6.96">you put it all together you have that</text>
  <text start="716.12" dur="4.74">240 day gap and then that seems to be</text>
  <text start="719.03" dur="3.9">some sort of way how they communicate</text>
  <text start="720.86" dur="4.53">you know a lot of the stuff here guys I</text>
  <text start="722.93" dur="5.28">know is kind of putting things together</text>
  <text start="725.39" dur="5.61">that that may not seem a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="728.21" dur="4.38">able to be tied together directly with a</text>
  <text start="731" dur="3.39">hundred percent certainty but I can tell</text>
  <text start="732.59" dur="5.46">you that that&amp;#39;s a way that these people</text>
  <text start="734.39" dur="5.54">work the most part are the the biggest</text>
  <text start="738.05" dur="4.71">way that they communicate is with these</text>
  <text start="739.93" dur="4.9">you know hidden messages and then it all</text>
  <text start="742.76" dur="4.17">has to do with time and dates and this</text>
  <text start="744.83" dur="4.26">and that so I don&amp;#39;t know what this is</text>
  <text start="746.93" dur="4.35">necessarily all building up to I know</text>
  <text start="749.09" dur="3.42">this is an interesting thread that kind</text>
  <text start="751.28" dur="2.85">of breaks that down from the same</text>
  <text start="752.51" dur="4.05">account that Q just posted here today</text>
  <text start="754.13" dur="3.84">who&amp;#39;s been doing good work on this and</text>
  <text start="756.56" dur="3.54">you know trying to expose you get the</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="3.75">information out there but that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="760.1" dur="4.89">much where we start and then the next</text>
  <text start="761.72" dur="4.92">thing is this say win la account who</text>
  <text start="764.99" dur="3.69">actually points this out saying the mod</text>
  <text start="766.64" dur="5.52">the veteran mob prosecutor John Durham</text>
  <text start="768.68" dur="5.7">was not appointed by a G bar Durham</text>
  <text start="772.16" dur="6.33">served as interim US Attorney since</text>
  <text start="774.38" dur="4.65">October 28th 2017 after sessions</text>
  <text start="778.49" dur="3.45">appointed</text>
  <text start="779.03" dur="5.64">him coincidentally the same day Q began</text>
  <text start="781.94" dur="5.79">posting president Trump nominee Durham</text>
  <text start="784.67" dur="4.14">as US attorney on November 1st 2017 and</text>
  <text start="787.73" dur="3.87">they use an expletive</text>
  <text start="788.81" dur="7.07">and they say that it&amp;#39;s happening well</text>
  <text start="791.6" dur="7.98">yeah if you think about it John Durham</text>
  <text start="795.88" dur="5.41">obviously the facts are twasn&amp;#39;t Attorney</text>
  <text start="799.58" dur="4.59">General bar who brought John Durham up</text>
  <text start="801.29" dur="6.68">it was Jeff Sessions who appointed him</text>
  <text start="804.17" dur="7.29">on the same day that Q started posting</text>
  <text start="807.97" dur="5.38">so there are no coincidences this is all</text>
  <text start="811.46" dur="3.36">connected this is all as we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="813.35" dur="2.73">about before these been ongoing</text>
  <text start="814.82" dur="3.36">investigations that have been going on</text>
  <text start="816.08" dur="3.99">for years now right they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="818.18" dur="3.72">building up their cases they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="820.07" dur="3.27">getting the evidence and a lot of this</text>
  <text start="821.9" dur="5.16">has to do with the theories I think that</text>
  <text start="823.34" dur="6.99">go around and say it I mean what would</text>
  <text start="827.06" dur="7.65">prevent Barack Obama upon leaving office</text>
  <text start="830.33" dur="8.79">in 2000 and what January of 2017 what</text>
  <text start="834.71" dur="6.36">would prevent him from issuing pardons</text>
  <text start="839.12" dur="4.71">on his way out apparently this was</text>
  <text start="841.07" dur="4.71">something that all presidents did so we</text>
  <text start="843.83" dur="3.84">had to get them for crimes that they</text>
  <text start="845.78" dur="4.05">committed after the fact</text>
  <text start="847.67" dur="3.75">now you can&amp;#39;t pardon certain things and</text>
  <text start="849.83" dur="4.44">that was pointed out presidential</text>
  <text start="851.42" dur="3.99">pardons only applied to certain things I</text>
  <text start="854.27" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t think they were applied to like</text>
  <text start="855.41" dur="4.74">treason or anything like that so there</text>
  <text start="857.63" dur="5.43">is that cab that caveat as well but</text>
  <text start="860.15" dur="4.47">consider this that if they did pardon</text>
  <text start="863.06" dur="4.08">themselves for all the financial crimes</text>
  <text start="864.62" dur="5.72">the the embezzling the extortion</text>
  <text start="867.14" dur="6.3">blackmail you know international</text>
  <text start="870.34" dur="5.5">trafficking all that stuff then we would</text>
  <text start="873.44" dur="4.14">have to have a way to establish cases</text>
  <text start="875.84" dur="3.99">against these people based off of crimes</text>
  <text start="877.58" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;ve committed after being parted</text>
  <text start="879.83" dur="4.86">right not to mention putting in other</text>
  <text start="882.77" dur="4.14">cases that would go toward things like</text>
  <text start="884.69" dur="4.82">treason which wouldn&amp;#39;t be applicable for</text>
  <text start="886.91" dur="5.22">the presidential pardon I believe so</text>
  <text start="889.51" dur="4.9">this is how you have to understand this</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="5.43">I think and this is what q I think wants</text>
  <text start="894.41" dur="4.35">us to kind of start to kind of grasp one</text>
  <text start="897.56" dur="3.18">of the only posts where you hear</text>
  <text start="898.76" dur="4.23">anything about John Durham is this one</text>
  <text start="900.74" dur="6.3">post but it&amp;#39;s a very telling post guys</text>

  <text start="953.29" dur="5.13">Admiral who is in control the head of</text>
  <text start="955.3" dur="5.76">the NSA who we&amp;#39;ve shown you here on this</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="4.59">channel before went to Congress and said</text>
  <text start="961.06" dur="5.49">there were basically people who are</text>
  <text start="963.01" dur="9.75">abusing the FISA a surveillance system</text>
  <text start="966.55" dur="9.33">and this was obviously against the</text>
  <text start="972.76" dur="5.79">intent of that program he said that</text>
  <text start="975.88" dur="4.08">basically verbatim in Congress a part of</text>
  <text start="978.55" dur="3.51">his testimony saying that people were</text>
  <text start="979.96" dur="3.69">abusing it and that the queries that</text>
  <text start="982.06" dur="3.03">were being made into these super</text>
  <text start="983.65" dur="3.33">surveillance systems that the stuff of</text>
  <text start="985.09" dur="5.06">the NSA the databases that they have the</text>
  <text start="986.98" dur="5.31">metadata bases that they were obviously</text>
  <text start="990.15" dur="3.67">politically motivated and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="992.29" dur="6.12">basically the insinuation that he makes</text>
  <text start="993.82" dur="6.87">right so he goes to president Trump in</text>
  <text start="998.41" dur="5.4">Trump Tower doesn&amp;#39;t hey they&amp;#39;re spying</text>
  <text start="1000.69" dur="5.55">on you this whole intelligence community</text>
  <text start="1003.81" dur="4.08">is trying to set you up they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1006.24" dur="4.41">to frame you as a Russian agent and</text>
  <text start="1007.89" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re trying to enact a coup against</text>
  <text start="1010.65" dur="4.74">the the will of the the Democratic will</text>
  <text start="1012.96" dur="3.84">of the American people so President</text>
  <text start="1015.39" dur="2.58">Trump what does he do it gets up any</text>
  <text start="1016.8" dur="3.75">leaves Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="1017.97" dur="4.5">the next day moves his entire base of</text>
  <text start="1020.55" dur="4.67">operations I thinked up to like bed mr.</text>
  <text start="1022.47" dur="5.13">New Jersey where his golf course is and</text>
  <text start="1025.22" dur="4.359">that was the beginning of all this when</text>
  <text start="1027.6" dur="6.71">President Trump I think made that the</text>
  <text start="1029.579" dur="7.26">complete realization that he was being</text>
  <text start="1034.31" dur="8.14">spied on and that he was being set up</text>
  <text start="1036.839" dur="8.121">and that did that meeting happened</text>
  <text start="1042.45" dur="4.35">the Attorney General as well at the time</text>
  <text start="1044.96" dur="4.63">that&amp;#39;s the question you have to ask</text>
  <text start="1046.8" dur="4.17">yourself I&amp;#39;m just putting it out there</text>
  <text start="1049.59" dur="4.83">because I think it&amp;#39;s an important a</text>
  <text start="1050.97" dur="6.15">little fact to kind of go into given</text>
  <text start="1054.42" dur="4.95">what Q is given us and then finally</text>
  <text start="1057.12" dur="7.14">there&amp;#39;s this phrase big for a rig for</text>
  <text start="1059.37" dur="6.39">red queue so I heard from a few people</text>
  <text start="1064.26" dur="4.29">on some of the boards you and they were</text>
  <text start="1065.76" dur="3.99">saying they&amp;#39;re in the Navy and they know</text>
  <text start="1068.55" dur="4.32">what rig for red means it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1069.75" dur="6.56">submarining term or a term for people</text>
  <text start="1072.87" dur="6.63">who go on submarines I guess or you know</text>
  <text start="1076.31" dur="6.1">basically work on submarines and rig for</text>
  <text start="1079.5" dur="5.46">red is this it means to ensure all</text>
  <text start="1082.41" dur="5.79">interior lighting is red and of low</text>
  <text start="1084.96" dur="6.69">intensity so as to preserve night vision</text>
  <text start="1088.2" dur="8.19">and so think about that when you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="1091.65" dur="6.78">submarine and they want your eyes not to</text>
  <text start="1096.39" dur="4.62">adjust to a bright light to keep your</text>
  <text start="1098.43" dur="3.99">eyes adjusted to a dark light why would</text>
  <text start="1101.01" dur="3.51">they want to do that well this article</text>
  <text start="1102.42" dur="3.87">kind of explains it and we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="1104.52" dur="4.35">this why they use red lights inside</text>
  <text start="1106.29" dur="3.75">submarines right and it says and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1108.87" dur="3.09">gonna jump right in here at the second</text>
  <text start="1110.04" dur="3.36">paragraph it says the idea that red</text>
  <text start="1111.96" dur="3.27">light diminishes the ability to see in</text>
  <text start="1113.4" dur="3.42">the dark is a myth in fact the presence</text>
  <text start="1115.23" dur="4.23">of red light helps the adjustment of</text>
  <text start="1116.82" dur="4.44">vision not only submarines but airport</text>
  <text start="1119.46" dur="4.02">control towers planetarium and some</text>
  <text start="1121.26" dur="4.35">movie theaters also use red light so</text>
  <text start="1123.48" dur="4.47">that is easier for the viewers eyes to</text>
  <text start="1125.61" dur="5.46">adjust from light to dark the submarine</text>
  <text start="1127.95" dur="5.73">crew needs to acclimate the eyes before</text>
  <text start="1131.07" dur="4.68">going topside for the night watch this</text>
  <text start="1133.68" dur="4.83">vision adjustment is the primary reason</text>
  <text start="1135.75" dur="4.86">for using red light so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1138.51" dur="5.22">saying there is you know when the</text>
  <text start="1140.61" dur="7.44">soldiers or naval officers who ever go</text>
  <text start="1143.73" dur="6.96">up to the the top to do a Night Watch</text>
  <text start="1148.05" dur="4.83">you know in the pitch-black dark they</text>
  <text start="1150.69" dur="3.9">have to be able to see so if they go up</text>
  <text start="1152.88" dur="4.17">and then the periscope up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1154.59" dur="3.51">looking out they don&amp;#39;t want to be in a</text>
  <text start="1157.05" dur="2.58">submarine where there&amp;#39;s a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1158.1" dur="3.33">bright lights because then it&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="1159.63" dur="3.81">the dark that much darker when they look</text>
  <text start="1161.43" dur="5.67">outside it actually helps their eyes</text>
  <text start="1163.44" dur="5.16">adjust to the nighttime then it also</text>
  <text start="1167.1" dur="3.6">says one of the other reasons is to</text>
  <text start="1168.6" dur="4.08">prevent light from being emitted from</text>
  <text start="1170.7" dur="4.6">the raised periscope although blackout</text>
  <text start="1172.68" dur="5.02">blind covers the blackout blind</text>
  <text start="1175.3" dur="4.2">the periscope yet there&amp;#39;s still a risk</text>
  <text start="1177.7" dur="3.87">of light being emitted from the other</text>
  <text start="1179.5" dur="4.53">end of the periscope this light can be</text>
  <text start="1181.57" dur="5.07">seen for miles and getting detected for</text>
  <text start="1184.03" dur="4.71">a submarine could serve as havoc so</text>
  <text start="1186.64" dur="3.54">there are two reasons obviously like</text>
  <text start="1188.74" dur="3.21">first it said to make sure that your</text>
  <text start="1190.18" dur="5.31">eyes are adjusted to be able to see out</text>
  <text start="1191.95" dur="5.67">at night but then it says also use the</text>
  <text start="1195.49" dur="4.98">red light to make sure that nobody can</text>
  <text start="1197.62" dur="4.89">see what you&amp;#39;re doing right now what</text>
  <text start="1200.47" dur="4.14">does this remind you of why would you</text>

  <text start="1891.95" dur="4.29">thing I guess is the most important part</text>
  <text start="1894.23" dur="3.3">of the whole episode it&amp;#39;s a segment we</text>
  <text start="1896.24" dur="3.15">do at the end of every episode called</text>
  <text start="1897.53" dur="3.6">God&amp;#39;s grace is greater when we talk</text>
  <text start="1899.39" dur="3.75">about God&amp;#39;s grace and how it is truly</text>
  <text start="1901.13" dur="4.23">greater today I want to talk about this</text>
  <text start="1903.14" dur="5.49">verse out of the book of first</text>
  <text start="1905.36" dur="5.94">Corinthians and this is a very important</text>
  <text start="1908.63" dur="3.84">verse to me it talks about how I think</text>
  <text start="1911.3" dur="3.99">we should all kind of look at ourselves</text>
  <text start="1912.47" dur="5.58">in this this day and age it talks about</text>
  <text start="1915.29" dur="6.21">being a faithful manager when watch is</text>
  <text start="1918.05" dur="8.13">chapter 4 first Corinthians verse 1</text>
  <text start="1921.5" dur="6.92">through 5 it says a person a person</text>
  <text start="1926.18" dur="4.92">should consider us in this way as</text>
  <text start="1928.42" dur="5.41">servants of Christ and managers of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1931.1" dur="4.8">mysteries in this regard it is expected</text>
  <text start="1933.83" dur="4.65">of managers that each one be found</text>
  <text start="1935.9" dur="5.49">faithful it is of little importance that</text>
  <text start="1938.48" dur="5.22">I should be evaluated by you or by a</text>
  <text start="1941.39" dur="4.92">human court in fact I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1943.7" dur="5.4">evaluate myself for I am not conscious</text>
  <text start="1946.31" dur="5.61">of anything against myself but I am not</text>
  <text start="1949.1" dur="5.52">justified by this the one who evaluates</text>
  <text start="1951.92" dur="5.13">me is the Lord therefore don&amp;#39;t judge</text>
  <text start="1954.62" dur="4.95">anything prematurely before the Lord</text>
  <text start="1957.05" dur="4.95">comes who will both bring to light what</text>
  <text start="1959.57" dur="4.83">is hidden in darkness and reveal the</text>
  <text start="1962" dur="6.44">intentions of the hearts and then praise</text>
  <text start="1964.4" dur="6.979">will come to each one from God</text>
  <text start="1968.44" dur="5.64">I just want to say that this is an</text>
  <text start="1971.379" dur="4.951">important message and the message is is</text>
  <text start="1974.08" dur="5.459">that we all have to act as faithful</text>
  <text start="1976.33" dur="6.51">managers we all have to act as righteous</text>
  <text start="1979.539" dur="8.161">men and women living a good life for God</text>
  <text start="1982.84" dur="7.829">an honest life a faithful life and even</text>
  <text start="1987.7" dur="5.069">though it seems difficult times and</text>
  <text start="1990.669" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s so much judgment and people want</text>
  <text start="1992.769" dur="4.74">to bring us into this the human court</text>
  <text start="1995.169" dur="4.411">and people want to you know deride us</text>
  <text start="1997.509" dur="3.811">for being Christians and having these</text>
  <text start="1999.58" dur="4.86">principles of faith and righteousness</text>
  <text start="2001.32" dur="6.089">and living by Christ&amp;#39;s doctrine in the</text>
  <text start="2004.44" dur="5.579">gospel they want to try to deride us and</text>
  <text start="2007.409" dur="7.051">put us down but we only live for the</text>
  <text start="2010.019" dur="5.671">judgment from above and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2014.46" dur="3.419">message I want to leave with you guys</text>
  <text start="2015.69" dur="4.289">that God is going to come to the world</text>
  <text start="2017.879" dur="3.75">and when he does he&amp;#39;s going to bring to</text>
  <text start="2019.979" dur="4.05">light what is hidden in darkness and</text>
  <text start="2021.629" dur="8.341">he&amp;#39;s going to reveal the intentions</text>
  <text start="2024.029" dur="7.32">inside of man&amp;#39;s hearts and this is the</text>
  <text start="2029.97" dur="2.459">message that&amp;#39;s so important I think we</text>
  <text start="2031.349" dur="3.721">need to share this with our friends</text>
  <text start="2032.429" dur="4.88">family and loved ones because that is</text>
  <text start="2035.07" dur="7.89">the way to understanding how we</text>
  <text start="2037.309" dur="8.381">faithfully manage our own existence so</text>
  <text start="2042.96" dur="3.929">that we may honor God and help others so</text>
  <text start="2045.69" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re - go ahead and leave</text>
