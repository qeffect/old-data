  <text start="233.43" dur="5.79">headline says study immigration to read</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="6.27">ish redistribute 26 congressional seats</text>
  <text start="239.22" dur="4.59">to blue states for 2022 election and</text>
  <text start="242.099" dur="5.461">what this code article goes on to detail</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="6.75">is the fact that by flooding these</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="6.449">coastal cities with illegal aliens what</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="5.729">happens is they start reapportioning the</text>
  <text start="254.009" dur="4.26">number of seats that each state has as</text>
  <text start="256.289" dur="4.2">far as representation goes in the House</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="5.041">of Representatives and this is a system</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="4.771">that we&amp;#39;ve been engaged in for since the</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="3.69">inception pretty much with the House of</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="4.08">Representatives being based on popular</text>
  <text start="267" dur="4.38">in numbers but this article puts into</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="4.41">perspective the fact that house that</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="6.12">states like California New York and</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="7.71">other major liberal bastions will become</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="6.18">the majority in the house and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="3.36">get more and more representation now you</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="3.18">can read through this article or</text>
  <text start="284.82" dur="4.02">yourself here but it gives a few</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="4.35">examples I think it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="3.9">to take into account it says here red</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="4.2">states such as Alabama Arkansas Georgia</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="4.14">Idaho Indiana Iowa Kentucky Louisiana</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="3.63">Mississippi Missouri North Carolina</text>
  <text start="296.88" dur="5.85">Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee Utah</text>
  <text start="299.04" dur="6.27">and West Virginia will all get one less</text>
  <text start="302.73" dur="4.05">congressional seat in 2020 smaller blue</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="2.81">states such as Minnesota and Rhode</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.53">Island would each receive one less</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="4.87">congressional seat those seats are a cut</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="3.66">from mostly red states will be</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="3.63">redistributed to California the most</text>
  <text start="314.97" dur="4.17">immigration inundated state in the</text>
  <text start="316.62" dur="5.07">country California by 2020 is set to</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="4.38">gain 11 congressional seats solely to</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="4.17">the fact that non-citizens rather than</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="4.71">just American citizens are counted in</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="3.87">congressional apportionment so think</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="5.31">about what it&amp;#39;s saying here it&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="329.73" dur="6.57">us that they&amp;#39;re counting illegal aliens</text>
  <text start="333.54" dur="4.98">in the way that they&amp;#39;re apportioning</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="4.02">congressional seats now why is this</text>
  <text start="338.52" dur="4.01">important well remember what President</text>
  <text start="340.32" dur="6.45">Trump said that he was going to do in</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="7.3">stopping or in forcing the census to</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="5.25">have the question of citizenship on it</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="3.99">now what did why was that important</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="3.57">because we had to figure out exactly how</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="3.93">many legal immigrants are here because</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="4.29">they should not be counted when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="3.66">your apportioning representation in the</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="4.05">United States if you&amp;#39;re here illegally</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="5.13">you are not a legal citizen therefore</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="4.29">you are not afforded any of the</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="4.379">constitutional rights that are</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="5.25">guaranteed I mean it is insanity to me</text>
  <text start="370.919" dur="4.231">that that people say that you know these</text>
  <text start="373.47" dur="3.87">illegal immigrants will they need</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="4.44">representation too well no they need to</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="5.34">be deported if you&amp;#39;re here illegally</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s the whole idea you&amp;#39;re not allowed</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="3.03">to be here you&amp;#39;re not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="3.99">here you entered this country by</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="5.04">breaking the law or you entered this</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="6.06">country legally and overstayed your visa</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="5.28">or whatever so this is really an issue</text>
  <text start="394.35" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s going to come up more and more as</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="3.15">we move into the future and I think</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="3.45">President Trump cue everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="3.66">highlighting this because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="5.34">continue to be a part of the Democrats</text>
  <text start="402.84" dur="6.57">strategy to destroy our country from</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="5.399">within right how by taking away all</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="5.25">representation in in the federal</text>
  <text start="411.449" dur="5.671">government from the the smaller demo or</text>
  <text start="414.66" dur="7.11">conservative states and replacing them</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="8.13">with these huge mega coastal cities that</text>
  <text start="421.77" dur="6.119">are flooded with you know crime and and</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="5.61">violence and drugs and there&amp;#39;s all types</text>
  <text start="427.889" dur="5.611">of ways that President Trump has</text>
  <text start="430.86" dur="4.86">actually worked to undo this but at this</text>
  <text start="433.5" dur="4.56">point looks like a lot of these big</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="4.89">Democrat States and a lot of swing</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="4.1">states are gonna experience a big change</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="3.3">in the way that they&amp;#39;re represented</text>
  <text start="442.16" dur="5.289">congressionally and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="443.91" dur="6.479">a very important issue for the future of</text>
  <text start="447.449" dur="6.09">America I think right it goes on to cite</text>
  <text start="450.389" dur="5.551">that President Trump got a huge amount</text>
  <text start="453.539" dur="4.5">of support among Native Americans native</text>
  <text start="455.94" dur="5.58">born Americans but the Democrats always</text>
  <text start="458.039" dur="4.41">have all of the new immigrants coming</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="3.869">into this country</text>
  <text start="462.449" dur="5.011">tend to vote Democrat why because the</text>
  <text start="465.389" dur="4.02">Democrats want to destroy our</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="3.72">sovereignty they want to open our</text>
  <text start="469.409" dur="3.211">borders they want to do everything that</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="2.85">if you were an illegal immigrant coming</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="3.24">in this country for the most part</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="3.69">because there are a lot of immigrants</text>
  <text start="475.86" dur="4.71">here who are here legally who wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="7.1">want this but for the most part they are</text>
  <text start="480.57" dur="8.19">in support of those initiatives right</text>
  <text start="484.82" dur="6.25">those policies so this is just another</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="3.54">you know interesting story I think you</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="3.12">can read the full thing I&amp;#39;ll leave a</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="4.56">link to it obviously but it says the</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="4.77">u.s. is on track to import about 15</text>
  <text start="496.86" dur="3.72">million new born voters in the next two</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="3.179">decades should current legal immigration</text>
  <text start="500.58" dur="3.72">levels continue those 15 new</text>
  <text start="502.139" dur="3.571">foreign-born voters include about 8</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="3.42">million who will arrive in the country</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="3.63">through chain migration whereby newly</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="3.84">naturalized citizens can be bring an</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="4.259">unlimited number of foreign relatives to</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="3.87">the country and it goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="513.599" dur="5.07">the University of Maryland did research</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="4.71">or did a study that found that in recent</text>
  <text start="518.669" dur="3.391">years more immigrants to the US</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="3.54">inevitably means more Democrat voters</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="4.38">and thus increasing electoral victories</text>
  <text start="523.68" dur="4.68">for the Democrat Party so look you guys</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="4.44">can dive into the the details of this</text>
  <text start="528.36" dur="4.26">the long story short is Democrats are</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="3.13">flooding coastal cities with illegal</text>
  <text start="532.62" dur="3.16">immigrants so that they can get</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="4.58">our congressional seats so they can have</text>
  <text start="535.78" dur="4.98">more power that&amp;#39;s I guess the ultimate</text>
  <text start="538.59" dur="3.49">long and short of it and then the next</text>
  <text start="540.76" dur="4.13">article here talks about red state</text>
  <text start="542.08" dur="5.46">Democratic governors who are basically</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="5.38">Democrat governors elected in very red</text>
  <text start="547.54" dur="5.64">states who are actually pushing now for</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="4.98">more immigration more refugees to be</text>
  <text start="553.18" dur="4.56">brought and relocated into they&amp;#39;re red</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="4.08">states now why is this important I think</text>
  <text start="557.74" dur="4.41">the article kind of sums it up right</text>
  <text start="559.33" dur="6.18">here where it talks about four months</text>
  <text start="562.15" dur="5.49">organizations with ties to billionaire</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="4.02">George Soros have carried out a pressure</text>
  <text start="567.64" dur="2.64">campaign on Republican governors because</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="2.61">it says up here</text>
  <text start="570.28" dur="3.99">I didn&amp;#39;t read this part but that these</text>
  <text start="572.14" dur="3.87">governors have called for more refugees</text>
  <text start="574.27" dur="6.3">and these are Republican governors of</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="7.98">Iowa Tennessee Arizona North Dakota and</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="4.86">Utah but it says organizations with ties</text>
  <text start="583.99" dur="2.97">to billionaire George Soros have carried</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="3.9">out a pressure campaign on Republican</text>
  <text start="586.96" dur="4.35">governors who have readily caved to ask</text>
  <text start="589.33" dur="4.11">that refugees continue being resettled</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="5.04">likewise in states like Iowa and North</text>
  <text start="593.44" dur="5.43">Dakota the big business lobby and donors</text>
  <text start="596.35" dur="4.74">have continuously claimed they need more</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="3.93">refugees to fill jobs refugee</text>
  <text start="601.09" dur="3.93">contractors have best have a vested</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="3.6">interest in making sure as many refugees</text>
  <text start="605.02" dur="3.03">are resettled across the United States</text>
  <text start="606.4" dur="4.53">as possible because their annual</text>
  <text start="608.05" dur="4.65">federally funded budgets are contingent</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="4.5">on the number of refugees they resettle</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="4.79">those refugee contractors include and</text>
  <text start="615.43" dur="4.59">then it gives this list of all these</text>
  <text start="617.49" dur="3.91">charitable organizations NGOs whatever</text>
  <text start="620.02" dur="5.03">you want to call them who are involved</text>
  <text start="621.4" dur="8.01">in pushing for this refugee relocation</text>
  <text start="625.05" dur="6.58">policy now think about it this way the</text>
  <text start="629.41" dur="4.41">way I kind of take this is cues giving</text>
  <text start="631.63" dur="4.59">us an insight into how the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="4.53">trying to undermine the democratic</text>
  <text start="636.22" dur="4.65">system here in America by bringing in</text>
  <text start="638.35" dur="6.09">refugees and illegal immigrants to try</text>
  <text start="640.87" dur="7.68">to reapportioned these districts and to</text>
  <text start="644.44" dur="6.18">also undermine the conservative areas of</text>
  <text start="648.55" dur="4.26">our country I mean they they have to be</text>
  <text start="650.62" dur="3.81">game planning after what happened with</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="3.06">trump on how they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="3.48">take back power and they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="655.87" dur="3.96">that since day one but queue puts it</text>
  <text start="657.91" dur="3.75">better than I can say important to read</text>
  <text start="659.83" dur="3.84">and understand why do Democrats want to</text>
  <text start="661.66" dur="3.93">flood the u.s. with illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="4.02">this is not another four year election</text>
  <text start="665.59" dur="4.26">our democracy is at stake how</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="4.29">and control do not mistake this</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="2.88">back-channel tool as a means to be</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="2.58">complacent</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="5.79">fight fight fight your votes but your</text>
  <text start="674.56" dur="5.79">voice in your vote matters q so another</text>
  <text start="678.52" dur="3.93">great point by q there said it way</text>
  <text start="680.35" dur="4.29">better than I could this is happening</text>
  <text start="682.45" dur="4.23">all across our country now wherever</text>
  <text start="684.64" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re at here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="686.68" dur="3.72">even abroad maybe but more specifically</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="4.26">in this instance in the United States</text>
  <text start="690.4" dur="4.8">you need to go and call your your</text>
  <text start="693.22" dur="3.81">representative in Congress need to write</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="3.81">them you need to tell them what you</text>
  <text start="697.03" dur="3.75">think why you don&amp;#39;t support bringing</text>
  <text start="699.01" dur="3.75">illegal immigrants in and why they</text>
  <text start="700.78" dur="3.84">shouldn&amp;#39;t support on your behalf because</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="4.29">remember this is a representative</text>
  <text start="704.62" dur="4.11">democracy this is a representative</text>
  <text start="707.05" dur="3.66">system where they are representing the</text>
  <text start="708.73" dur="5.07">interests of you we the American people</text>
  <text start="710.71" dur="4.68">so we have to hold them accountable this</text>
  <text start="713.8" dur="3.93">is not just going to happen through cube</text>
  <text start="715.39" dur="4.23">posting on the 8chan boards I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="717.73" dur="4.02">a part of the Great Awakening yes we are</text>
  <text start="719.62" dur="4.95">the news now yes we&amp;#39;re circumventing the</text>
  <text start="721.75" dur="4.71">fake news media but we can do so much</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="3">more and I just I think use a hundred</text>
  <text start="726.46" dur="4.83">percent right we have to continue to</text>
  <text start="727.57" dur="5.64">make our voice and vote matter and that</text>
  <text start="731.29" dur="4.35">is an important part of this whole</text>
  <text start="733.21" dur="4.5">movement so the next thing here I want</text>
  <text start="735.64" dur="7.05">to show you is this clip and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="737.71" dur="7.71">to watch it this is Jeff van drew I</text>
  <text start="742.69" dur="5.19">think the yeah Jeff ban drew the guy who</text>
  <text start="745.42" dur="4.32">just switched from the Democrat Party to</text>
  <text start="747.88" dur="3.66">the Republican Party because he said he</text>
  <text start="749.74" dur="3.33">was basically being shipped down by the</text>
  <text start="751.54" dur="3.03">Democrats for not supporting the</text>
  <text start="753.07" dur="4.32">impeachment of President Trump and</text>
  <text start="754.57" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s exactly what it is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="757.39" dur="4.89">a mafia like mentality on the left and</text>
  <text start="760.45" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s how they run everything Nancy</text>
  <text start="762.28" dur="7.64">Pelosi runs it like a Mafia family so</text>
  <text start="766.33" dur="6.3">think about that and watch this video</text>
  <text start="769.92" dur="5.169">well the final point in the final sign</text>
  <text start="772.63" dur="4.53">so there has been all along you know</text>
  <text start="775.089" dur="3.601">where the party is moving further and</text>
  <text start="777.16" dur="3.72">further to the left where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="778.69" dur="4.86">discussions of it being a socialist</text>
  <text start="780.88" dur="4.98">party and I am a proud capitalist I</text>
  <text start="783.55" dur="5.13">believe in hard work I believe that we</text>
  <text start="785.86" dur="4.32">can give people opportunity but that</text>
  <text start="788.68" dur="4.62">they also when they get that opportunity</text>
  <text start="790.18" dur="4.95">have to work hard to achieve success you</text>
  <text start="793.3" dur="3.36">can&amp;#39;t give them success and many other</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="2.31">things that I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll talk as we go</text>
  <text start="796.66" dur="3.15">along here</text>
  <text start="797.44" dur="3.69">but the final sign for me I mean was</text>
  <text start="799.81" dur="4.98">oddly enough</text>
  <text start="801.13" dur="5.31">actually in my home county when one of</text>
  <text start="804.79" dur="3.87">the county chairman and I have eight</text>
  <text start="806.44" dur="3.54">counties one of the County chairmen came</text>
  <text start="808.66" dur="3.51">to me and said I have to speak with you</text>
  <text start="809.98" dur="4.44">and I said sure and sat down he said I</text>
  <text start="812.17" dur="4.41">just want to let you know that you have</text>
  <text start="814.42" dur="4.11">to vote for impeachment I said what do</text>
  <text start="816.58" dur="4.29">you mean he said you&amp;#39;ve got a vote for</text>
  <text start="818.53" dur="5.46">impeachment if you don&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="820.87" dur="4.74">going to be able to run in my County</text>
  <text start="823.99" dur="3.75">well first of all it&amp;#39;s not his County</text>
  <text start="825.61" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s our County and you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="827.74" dur="3.33">be able to move forward you&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="829.21" dur="3.9">to get the line which is a big deal in</text>
  <text start="831.07" dur="5.94">New Jersey and and you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="833.11" dur="5.55">be successful and I first of all I still</text>
  <text start="837.01" dur="3.42">could have run and I could still could</text>
  <text start="838.66" dur="3.51">have gotten the line and I could afford</text>
  <text start="840.43" dur="3.8">it out I fought a lot of things in my</text>
  <text start="842.17" dur="5.19">life and I fought hard to be where I am</text>
  <text start="844.23" dur="4.99">but it made me think for all the years</text>
  <text start="847.36" dur="5.13">that I&amp;#39;ve worked so hard and tried to</text>
  <text start="849.22" dur="6.18">give so much not only to the party but</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="4.95">to everybody the things that we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="855.4" dur="4.29">and I we go into them but many many</text>
  <text start="857.44" dur="4.89">infrastructure projects and helping</text>
  <text start="859.69" dur="4.65">people and all the services that we try</text>
  <text start="862.33" dur="5.28">to give people in our offices and it all</text>
  <text start="864.34" dur="5.97">boils down to one vote that I may have</text>
  <text start="867.61" dur="4.77">my own individual opinion on one vote</text>
  <text start="870.31" dur="4.35">and that&amp;#39;s not going to be allowed I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="872.38" dur="4.56">going to be punished for that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.66" dur="5.01">when I knew I had been thinking about it</text>
  <text start="876.94" dur="4.2">for a while and I said and you know I</text>
  <text start="879.67" dur="3.54">was speaking of my chief of staff about</text>
  <text start="881.14" dur="5.04">this and and I said to her I said you</text>
  <text start="883.21" dur="6.21">know there&amp;#39;s always been in my career</text>
  <text start="886.18" dur="5.37">and over time something that happens</text>
  <text start="889.42" dur="4.41">that lets you know that it is time to</text>
  <text start="891.55" dur="3.72">make a change and this was it you know</text>
  <text start="893.83" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s really interesting I can make a</text>
  <text start="895.27" dur="3.99">change so you so what you just saw there</text>
  <text start="897.4" dur="3.63">was a little excerpt from that video I</text>
  <text start="899.26" dur="3.66">think it&amp;#39;s kind of an important part of</text>
  <text start="901.03" dur="4.83">the video the interview with Maria</text>
  <text start="902.92" dur="5.64">Bartiromo and the representative drew</text>
  <text start="905.86" dur="3.9">there but I want to touch on what Q says</text>
  <text start="908.56" dur="2.94">and then we&amp;#39;ll move to the next one</text>
  <text start="909.76" dur="2.73">excuses watch and listen carefully and</text>
  <text start="911.5" dur="2.01">of course I&amp;#39;ll leave a link in the</text>
  <text start="912.49" dur="3.27">description if you guys want to watch</text>
  <text start="913.51" dur="4.02">the full video but Q says watch and</text>
  <text start="915.76" dur="4.26">listen carefully Democrats threaten and</text>
  <text start="917.53" dur="5.16">cull independently elected officials to</text>
  <text start="920.02" dur="4.74">fall in line follow orders or face being</text>
  <text start="922.69" dur="4.23">ousted who controls a Democratic Party</text>
  <text start="924.76" dur="4.74">who really controls the Democrat Party</text>
  <text start="926.92" dur="4.56">threat if a major political party can be</text>
  <text start="929.5" dur="4.2">controlled does that represent a clear</text>
  <text start="931.48" dur="3">and present danger to the United States</text>
  <text start="933.7" dur="3.15">of America</text>
  <text start="934.48" dur="6.12">George Soros in the metaphor kill box</text>
  <text start="936.85" dur="6.359">here Q so think about that who really</text>
  <text start="940.6" dur="4.919">controls Democrat Party it&amp;#39;s individuals</text>
  <text start="943.209" dur="5.21">like George Soros and globalists who are</text>
  <text start="945.519" dur="5.91">making these uh you know mafia like</text>
  <text start="948.419" dur="6.28">syndicates within this political party</text>
  <text start="951.429" dur="6.21">in order to control who says what who</text>
  <text start="954.699" dur="5.07">votes for what win and then you have to</text>
  <text start="957.639" dur="4.89">understand it&amp;#39;s all about getting the</text>
  <text start="959.769" dur="4.771">votes in DC all these major globalist</text>
  <text start="962.529" dur="4.59">want to do is fought our country with</text>
  <text start="964.54" dur="5.31">illegals to destroy it from within to</text>
  <text start="967.119" dur="5.34">get rid of our sovereignty to make us</text>
  <text start="969.85" dur="6.389">collapse into a bigger global governing</text>
  <text start="972.459" dur="5.4">system which can then go over the top of</text>
  <text start="976.239" dur="4.82">the constitution of the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="977.859" dur="5.85">in in force and more authoritarian</text>
  <text start="981.059" dur="6.03">system of control and Taxation that</text>
  <text start="983.709" dur="6.78">would be basically the death of America</text>
  <text start="987.089" dur="5.02">so the fact that that Q&amp;#39;s pointing to</text>
  <text start="990.489" dur="3">this is really important especially when</text>
  <text start="992.109" dur="3.121">you put in context of what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="993.489" dur="3.33">with the the way they flood our country</text>
  <text start="995.23" dur="3.329">with these illegal immigrants so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="996.819" dur="3.21">all a part of the same game that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="998.559" dur="3.661">playing now they did this in Europe</text>
  <text start="1000.029" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re doing it in Europe the implosion</text>
  <text start="1002.22" dur="5.699">of Libya was a part of flooding Europe</text>
  <text start="1005.519" dur="5.34">with a bunch of immigrants migrants</text>
  <text start="1007.919" dur="5.34">illegal migrants from Africa who could</text>
  <text start="1010.859" dur="4.59">destabilize these governments and then</text>
  <text start="1013.259" dur="4.77">make them collapse into a bigger a</text>
  <text start="1015.449" dur="4.05">sovereign right so you want to get rid</text>
  <text start="1018.029" dur="2.91">of the independent nation state you want</text>
  <text start="1019.499" dur="2.721">to replace it with a global sovereign</text>
  <text start="1020.939" dur="3.661">that&amp;#39;s a commanding control</text>
  <text start="1022.22" dur="4.089">authoritarian probably communist</text>
  <text start="1024.6" dur="5.219">socialist regime which would have</text>
  <text start="1026.309" dur="6.571">unlimited power and authority to tax and</text>
  <text start="1029.819" dur="4.38">regulate it would be really grim let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1032.88" dur="3.75">put it that way if this were allowed to</text>
  <text start="1034.199" dur="4.71">happen so I think that&amp;#39;s what Q&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1036.63" dur="5.159">of touching on there now let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="1038.909" dur="4.77">the next one here it&amp;#39;s a first starting</text>
  <text start="1041.789" dur="4.05">with this Fox News article which is</text>
  <text start="1043.679" dur="4.71">talking about Trump not backing down in</text>
  <text start="1045.839" dur="4.71">an effort to count citizens amidst the</text>
  <text start="1048.389" dur="4.89">census fight now this is back from July</text>
  <text start="1050.549" dur="6.331">of 2019 where President Trump was</text>
  <text start="1053.279" dur="6.931">basically in this fight with everyone on</text>
  <text start="1056.88" dur="4.919">the Democrat left to block the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1060.21" dur="3.3">were trying to block the citizenship</text>
  <text start="1061.799" dur="3.951">question from the census because of</text>
  <text start="1063.51" dur="3.36">everything Hugh just outlined out</text>
  <text start="1065.75" dur="2.919">previously</text>
  <text start="1066.87" dur="2.08">so here&amp;#39;s President Trump speaking in</text>
  <text start="1068.669" dur="2.411">the</text>
  <text start="1068.95" dur="5.28">guard announcing an executive order that</text>
  <text start="1071.08" dur="6.3">he signed which basically made it so</text>
  <text start="1074.23" dur="4.32">that they would use other methods of</text>
  <text start="1077.38" dur="4.14">collecting the information of</text>
  <text start="1078.55" dur="5.73">citizenship to bolster the census so</text>
  <text start="1081.52" dur="5.91">that the apportionment of congressional</text>
  <text start="1084.28" dur="5.64">representation was not affected by a you</text>
  <text start="1087.43" dur="5.37">know miss reporting of population size</text>
  <text start="1089.92" dur="4.98">meaning if the census doesn&amp;#39;t ask who</text>
  <text start="1092.8" dur="4.62">you know who they&amp;#39;re sent giving the</text>
  <text start="1094.9" dur="3.87">census to if they&amp;#39;re a US citizen then</text>
  <text start="1097.42" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;re affording representation to</text>
  <text start="1098.77" dur="4.11">people who are not here legally because</text>
  <text start="1101.38" dur="4.17">there are going to be people who fill</text>
  <text start="1102.88" dur="5.73">out that form who are not here legally</text>
  <text start="1105.55" dur="4.89">right so and it could be to the tune of</text>
  <text start="1108.61" dur="4.17">millions and in certain states it can</text>
  <text start="1110.44" dur="3.45">change the entire demographic as Q</text>
  <text start="1112.78" dur="3.15">outlined before</text>
