  <text start="196.3" dur="2.999">they&amp;#39;re always talking out there is that</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="2.969">they&amp;#39;re working really hard behind the</text>
  <text start="199.299" dur="3.271">scenes to try to get this website back</text>
  <text start="200.829" dur="4.231">up they&amp;#39;ve set a lot of aggressive</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="4.139">timelines that have been hard to hit you</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="3.66">got to imagine when CloudFlare took</text>
  <text start="206.709" dur="4.681">their protection away from this website</text>
  <text start="208.72" dur="4.56">it makes them incredibly vulnerable and</text>
  <text start="211.39" dur="3.33">it makes a whole new set of problems</text>
  <text start="213.28" dur="3.54">that they have to create solutions for</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="5.519">but that my friends is where innovation</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="6.18">comes and that&amp;#39;s where opportunity rests</text>
  <text start="220.239" dur="6.901">so remember everything they&amp;#39;re forcing</text>
  <text start="223" dur="6.54">us to do by attacking us is making us</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="4.86">better and creating an innovation and</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="4.08">creating opportunity so that&amp;#39;s the way I</text>
  <text start="232" dur="3.48">look at it but that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="3.42">here with this I always remind everybody</text>

  <text start="244.12" dur="4.41">regular basis you guys know you guys see</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="4.351">it there&amp;#39;s countless examples out there</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="4.26">they even write blogs and brag about how</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re suppressing content with which</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="3.99">they disagree in some Orwellian</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="4.5">nightmare that we seem to be living out</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="4.829">in real time here but you guys have to</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="3.15">break that system and how do you do it</text>
  <text start="261.609" dur="3.18">you hit the share button there&amp;#39;s a share</text>
  <text start="262.84" dur="3.48">button in this video go back watch these</text>

  <text start="272.14" dur="5.07">get around their suppression of content</text>
  <text start="275.14" dur="4.2">now with that being said let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="277.21" dur="4.47">the first story Pelosi orders in Petri</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="6.3">and probe saying nobody&amp;#39;s above the law</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="6.39">well this is so fascinating so she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.64" dur="3.66">refused to call for a vote which is what</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="3.42">you would need to actually go to</text>
  <text start="289.3" dur="4.95">impeachment all she&amp;#39;s done is used her</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="4.59">bully pulpit as the Speaker of the House</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="4.14">to get up in front of the house and even</text>
  <text start="296.08" dur="5.1">announced that they are probing the</text>
  <text start="298.39" dur="4.65">impeachment so the story basically goes</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="3.75">on to show and House Speaker Nancy</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="4.47">Pelosi is launching a formal impeachment</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="5.07">query against President Trump on Tuesday</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="4.59">and this isn&amp;#39;t incredible</text>
  <text start="310" dur="4.19">I mean her own words coming out today</text>
  <text start="312.1" dur="4.23">she says oh well I haven&amp;#39;t even read the</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="3.82">transcript yet so the transcript was</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="3.21">actually released this morning what</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re actually launching this all</text>
  <text start="319.54" dur="5.52">about - believe it or not is the probe</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="4.74">focuses on whether Trump abused his</text>
  <text start="325.06" dur="3.57">presidential powers and sought help from</text>
  <text start="327.28" dur="3.99">a foreign government to undermine</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="3.63">democratic foe Joe Biden and help his</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="3.27">own reelection</text>
  <text start="332.26" dur="3.93">Pelosi said such actions would mark a</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="5.76">betrayal of his oath of office and</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="5.67">declared no one is above the law so what</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="3.33">they are talking about is a phone call</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="4.32">that has been brought forward by a</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="4.14">supposed whistleblower which we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="2.79">basically found out as somebody who</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="3.36">didn&amp;#39;t even hear directly the</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="3.63">conversation heard it secondhand and is</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="4.38">a partisan hack according to the</text>
  <text start="352.6" dur="6.69">president&amp;#39;s words not not mine not the</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="6.27">hack part but partisan and this is</text>
  <text start="359.29" dur="4.62">interesting though because as you can</text>
  <text start="361.78" dur="4.139">see here the Democrats are terrified of</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="3.93">what they&amp;#39;re terrified of what this</text>
  <text start="365.919" dur="3.331">transcript releases and what it talks</text>
  <text start="367.84" dur="3.87">about it talks about CrowdStrike and</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that and but before</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="3.57">we do look at this you have Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="373.54" dur="3.33">coming out as soon as President Trump</text>
  <text start="375.28" dur="4.139">has called out this money-laundering</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="5.01">scheme pay-for-play influence whatever</text>
  <text start="379.419" dur="4.801">you want to call it allegation coming</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="5.73">out of Ukraine you have Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="384.22" dur="5.97">calling for Trump impeachment hmm well</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s interesting to see right and of</text>
  <text start="390.19" dur="3.15">course market watch is is already</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="3.15">putting this out there traffic saying</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="3.96">Trump&amp;#39;s prepare to go to war against the</text>
  <text start="395.2" dur="3.99">US intelligence agencies so why would</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="3.44">President Trump have to go to war</text>
  <text start="399.19" dur="3.8">against the US intelligence agency</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="4.649">because these people are the ones who</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="3.959">were involved in this criminal coup and</text>
  <text start="405.389" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re enacting it every single day</text>
  <text start="406.949" dur="5.611">behind the scenes against him you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.639" dur="4.56">believe me just look at this the</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="5.28">impeachment inquiry casts a spotlight on</text>
  <text start="415.199" dur="3.9">his new choice as the DNI so president</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="3.54">Trump&amp;#39;s got an Acting Director of</text>
  <text start="419.099" dur="5.16">National Intelligence in Joseph McGuire</text>
  <text start="421.38" dur="5.969">who is now actively being fought by the</text>
  <text start="424.259" dur="4.981">deep state they&amp;#39;re trying to attack him</text>
  <text start="427.349" dur="2.311">to remove him yeah why would they do</text>
  <text start="429.24" dur="1.95">that</text>
  <text start="429.66" dur="2.97">because as soon as he takes over power</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="3.81">this whistleblowers coming out and</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="5.599">leaking private phone calls between the</text>
  <text start="435" dur="6.509">president and his other foreign leaders</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="5.081">this is crazy right so you can see how</text>
  <text start="441.509" dur="4.861">this all basically connects back</text>
  <text start="443.31" dur="5.099">together for us to understand that it is</text>
  <text start="446.37" dur="3.72">a deep state move why are they doing it</text>
  <text start="448.409" dur="4.051">because impeachments all they have left</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="3.06">because once the truth comes out about</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="4.26">CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="453.15" dur="6.54">that&amp;#39;s when this gets really ugly so</text>

  <text start="459.69" dur="5.46">the United until United States document</text>

  <text start="495.84" dur="3.66">following I did talk to Angela Merkel</text>
  <text start="497.699" dur="3.571">now they&amp;#39;re talking about Germany and</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="3.24">the European Union and how they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="3.66">doing anything to help Ukraine I should</text>

  <text start="506.55" dur="3.239">him that they aren&amp;#39;t doing enough are</text>
  <text start="507.99" dur="3.81">quite as much as they need to be doing</text>
  <text start="509.789" dur="3.42">on the issues with the sanctions they</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="3.15">are not enforcing the sanctions they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.209" dur="4.111">not working as much as they should work</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="5.94">for Ukraine they&amp;#39;re not working or they</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="5.849">excuse me it turns out that even though</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="3.96">largely the European Union should be our</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="3.301">biggest partner but technically the</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="3.33">United States is a much bigger partner</text>
  <text start="526.47" dur="4.17">than the European Union and I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="4.8">grateful to you for that because the</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="3.72">United States is doing quite a lot for</text>
