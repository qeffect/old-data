  <text start="1380.17" dur="3.51">suicide of top FBI agent who</text>
  <text start="1382.18" dur="3.84">investigated Clinton Foundation so this</text>
  <text start="1383.68" dur="3.69">is actually a story about an FBI agent</text>
  <text start="1386.02" dur="4.38">who was especially he was a senior</text>
  <text start="1387.37" dur="4.62">advisor like a special advisory agent at</text>
  <text start="1390.4" dur="4.35">the FBI and the Financial Crimes</text>
  <text start="1391.99" dur="5.13">Division who went out a few days ago I</text>
  <text start="1394.75" dur="5.22">guess or a couple days ago I guess with</text>
  <text start="1397.12" dur="5.13">friends from the FBI after he had had a</text>
  <text start="1399.97" dur="4.11">long career at the FBI he left Wall</text>

  <text start="1405.97" dur="3.21">of his friends were really shocked so he</text>
  <text start="1407.65" dur="3.69">went from Wall Street and making a lot</text>
  <text start="1409.18" dur="5.12">of money to the FBI and making none and</text>
  <text start="1411.34" dur="6.18">then he went investigated the Clintons</text>
  <text start="1414.3" dur="5.2">the Clinton Foundation and now he&amp;#39;s at a</text>
  <text start="1417.52" dur="4.92">nightclub and just pulls out his pistol</text>
  <text start="1419.5" dur="6.09">and ends his life on a crowded dance</text>

  <text start="1425.59" dur="4.65">but I can tell you right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1428.56" dur="3.33">some suspicious stuff about this story</text>
  <text start="1430.24" dur="3.57">especially when you think of the fact</text>
  <text start="1431.89" dur="4.74">that this guy left a very lucrative job</text>
  <text start="1433.81" dur="5.91">on Wall Street in 2010 to become an FBI</text>
  <text start="1436.63" dur="4.8">agent and then went went on to go</text>
  <text start="1439.72" dur="3.57">investigate the Clinton Foundation and</text>
  <text start="1441.43" dur="5.06">obviously found nothing or else there</text>
  <text start="1443.29" dur="6.75">would have been some kind of you know</text>
  <text start="1446.49" dur="5.23">findings or whatever that we still</text>
