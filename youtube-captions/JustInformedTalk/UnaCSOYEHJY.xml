  <text start="131.16" dur="4.96">think what&amp;#39;s missing do you think this</text>
  <text start="134.05" dur="5.64">was going to be litigated in this</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="5.58">setting case that implicates some of the</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="3.57">most senior elected officials treason is</text>
  <text start="141.7" dur="5.7">being handled by the appropriate office</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="7.22">think National Security q so that makes</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="6.45">sense at face value</text>
  <text start="150.48" dur="5.17">it&amp;#39;s tough we have to trust here and</text>
  <text start="153.85" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s where this gets tough because we</text>
  <text start="155.65" dur="4.86">have to trust that behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="157.3" dur="5.31">even though how this deal with a wand</text>
  <text start="160.51" dur="3.84">seemed to come out here&amp;#39;s an article out</text>
  <text start="162.61" dur="5.57">of the Orlando Sentinel that was a</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="7.109">forwarded of a Washington Post article</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="5.17">that talked about how the X Congress</text>
  <text start="171.459" dur="4.051">congressional IT staffer reaches a plea</text>
  <text start="173.35" dur="4.43">deal that debunks conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="3.509">promoted by Trump conservative media oh</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="3.429">really</text>
  <text start="179.019" dur="4.261">so we already debunked it I guess that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.209" dur="5.491">that what the outcome of this case would</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="6.87">say the outcome is is basically laid out</text>
  <text start="186.7" dur="4.95">here a wand was released from electronic</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="3.15">monitoring because he was wearing an</text>
  <text start="191.65" dur="5">electronic bracelet on his ankle I</text>
  <text start="193.3" dur="8.88">believe and he&amp;#39;s free pending his</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="7.89">sentencing on August 21st now I know I</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="5.04">think a part of the stipulation of his</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="5.71">in that intermediate time is that he</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="6.09">will be not allowed to go outside of 150</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="4.65">miles of his residence as one of the</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="3.209">restrictions before the hearing actually</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="3.3">takes her sentencing actually takes</text>
  <text start="216.519" dur="3.571">place but I mean this is a guy who was</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="5.4">caught at an airport trying to get on a</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="6.57">plane to go to Pakistan presumably to</text>
  <text start="223.6" dur="4.949">avoid the criminal charges that he saw</text>
  <text start="226.66" dur="5.34">coming down the pipeline at him</text>
  <text start="228.549" dur="5.16">that being said they&amp;#39;ve decided to</text>
  <text start="232" dur="3.48">remove his electronic monitoring but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="4.711">sure he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to travel there</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="5.37">easily at this point given the the you</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="5.189">know recognition that he&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="4.35">afforded and surveillance I&amp;#39;m sure as</text>
  <text start="243.609" dur="3.301">part of the deal prosecutors agreed to</text>

  <text start="264.53" dur="5.97">to him really just a slap on the wrist</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="7.47">and are very small criminal finding for</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="5.16">the scope and and level of the case that</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="6.63">was being brought against him to have it</text>
  <text start="275.66" dur="6.66">ultimately end with this you know basic</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="5.03">you know signing a document incorrectly</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="4.95">it what it you know mounts to really</text>
  <text start="285.1" dur="4.6">what&amp;#39;s interesting though he was gonna</text>
  <text start="287.27" dur="5.01">tell us there&amp;#39;s far more going on then</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="3.96">we can even see right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="2.76">gonna have to trust in that but you</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="5.16">already have Debbie wasserman-schultz</text>

  <text start="298.82" dur="5.07">saying we rely on our justice system to</text>
  <text start="301.76" dur="5.13">reproduce or to produce a fair result</text>
  <text start="303.89" dur="4.83">after a considered objective review that</text>
  <text start="306.89" dur="3.42">role is even more important at a time</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="3.84">when Donald Trump his allies spread</text>
  <text start="310.31" dur="4.14">dangerous distortions with the intent of</text>

  <text start="325.61" dur="6.27">getting a convicted of things that have</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="5.13">been alleged because treason is real I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="3.18">not we don&amp;#39;t have the evidence to</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="3.72">suggest yet that any of these</text>
  <text start="335.06" dur="5.19">individuals are necessarily involved in</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="4.89">a larger conspiracy plot or</text>
  <text start="340.25" dur="3.9">conspiratorial plot but we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="6.24">enough you know circumstantial evidence</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="5.73">to make an investigation to make it so</text>
  <text start="348.29" dur="4.07">this investigation that&amp;#39;s been going on</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="5.46">for quite some time from the IG</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="4.84">Inspector General&amp;#39;s Office necessary and</text>
  <text start="355.34" dur="3.39">then furthermore will there be</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="2.67">indictments are there already sealed</text>
  <text start="358.73" dur="2.64">indictments a lot of the speculation</text>
  <text start="359.87" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;ve been reading through the boards</text>
  <text start="361.37" dur="4.29">talking about what this could all refer</text>
  <text start="363.17" dur="3.51">to but thinking national security but</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="2.7">let&amp;#39;s read the next one because it all</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="3.72">ties in the next one is talking about</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="4.59">president Trump&amp;#39;s tweet President Trump</text>
  <text start="370.4" dur="4.26">tweeted back on June 7th our Justice</text>
  <text start="372.95" dur="3.33">Department must not let Ilana and Debbie</text>
  <text start="374.66" dur="4.29">wasserman-schultz off the hook the</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="4.77">Democrat IT scandal is a key to much of</text>
  <text start="378.95" dur="3.96">the corruption we see today they want to</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="2.58">make a plea deal to hide what is on</text>
  <text start="382.91" dur="3.66">their server</text>
  <text start="383.63" dur="5.94">well where is server really bad so</text>
  <text start="386.57" dur="4.56">logical thinking cue says why was the</text>
  <text start="389.57" dur="4.53">case against Taiwan filed on her bank</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="4.8">fraud the result today is regarding bank</text>
  <text start="394.1" dur="5.72">fraud see last can</text>
  <text start="395.93" dur="7.47">the swamp is being drained q alright so</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="6.879">the I think what it is is huge trying to</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="6.6">point out that this case brought against</text>
  <text start="406.699" dur="4.891">a wand was basically a holder and I</text>
  <text start="410" dur="3.509">think what Q is suggesting is that</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="4.049">there&amp;#39;s been sealed indictments for a</text>
  <text start="413.509" dur="4.291">lot of these individuals for quite some</text>
  <text start="415.639" dur="5.431">time and because the case is kit you can</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="4.649">unseal certain indictments you know</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="3.48">withouten sealing so many other</text>
  <text start="422.449" dur="3.301">indictments in investigations that and</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="2.67">then there&amp;#39;s going to be more</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="2.58">indictments that are being created</text>
  <text start="427.22" dur="4.08">through the investigation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="6.03">continually ongoing so this was maybe a</text>
  <text start="431.3" dur="5.79">way to stall this was a way to hang to</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="4.95">get him hung up in in the litigation and</text>
  <text start="437.09" dur="4.949">we&amp;#39;ve got him on one charge which means</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="6.15">we can you know basically at least hold</text>
  <text start="442.039" dur="7.35">him till August it would seem and not</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="6.42">only that there is something to be said</text>
  <text start="449.389" dur="4.951">for what&amp;#39;s being implicated by Q here in</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="4.05">saying that the result today is</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="4.56">regarding bank fraud he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="455.93" dur="4.769">basically it&amp;#39;s not about the server it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.9" dur="4.59">not about that the collusion it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="460.699" dur="5.431">about the DNC not about the the alleged</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="4.14">spy networks it&amp;#39;s not about any of that</text>
  <text start="466.13" dur="3.15">so how about the Muslim Brotherhood it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.63" dur="3.42">not about their infiltration it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="3.87">about this bank fraud and this was just</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="5.07">a holder kind of to keep him in the</text>
  <text start="473.15" dur="4.59">country and to keep him in play as a</text>
  <text start="476.12" dur="3.12">person now another thing that people</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="3.66">have pointed out that I thought was</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="4.98">interesting was a lot of people should</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="5.43">be scared especially those like the</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="4.35">Wasserman Schultz&amp;#39;s of the world that he</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="3.3">only got a bank fraud charge when he had</text>
  <text start="488.57" dur="3.99">so many other charges being levied</text>
  <text start="490.13" dur="4.08">against him in that case could that</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="4.169">suggest that he&amp;#39;s turned to be a</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="4.98">prosecutors witness in upcoming trials</text>
  <text start="496.729" dur="3.901">when more indictments are unsealed that</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="2.82">is certainly a question that is yet to</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="3.48">be answered but we will have to wait and</text>
  <text start="502.01" dur="6.24">see what the outcome of that of that is</text>
  <text start="504.11" dur="5.97">so q saying see last connect this one</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="3.63">yes we&amp;#39;re connecting the dots here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="5.329">thinking national security there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.88" dur="8.37">implications it could be anything from</text>
  <text start="515.409" dur="6.611">you know waiting for a US attorney John</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="3.87">Huber and inspector general Michael</text>

  <text start="528.87" dur="5.97">you know guys treasons a real crime and</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="4.62">it is it exists so I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="534.84" dur="4.59">we have any proof of these individuals</text>
  <text start="536.19" dur="4.56">being involved in that yet but you know</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="3.72">the evidence is starting to point us in</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="6.15">a certain direction now an Anton put</text>

  <text start="563.46" dur="4.65">this out by but I can add that I have</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="4.17">suspected for some time that the state</text>
  <text start="568.11" dur="4.08">charges were just a delay tactic until</text>
  <text start="570.39" dur="3.84">the main indictments are unsealed it is</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="4.82">also possible or even likely given the</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="5.22">way they treated a wand that he will be</text>
  <text start="577.01" dur="5.65">prosecution witness so they would have</text>
  <text start="579.45" dur="4.98">never let him wander otherwise lots more</text>
  <text start="582.66" dur="5.22">winning in store I&amp;#39;m enjoying the movie</text>
  <text start="584.43" dur="5.79">and that&amp;#39;s the Anton Q says matters of</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="5.37">national security and gives us a article</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="4.98">here and or a link to a page and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="3.54">signed Q there and we&amp;#39;ll read the page</text>
  <text start="595.2" dur="3.57">really quick this is a synopsis of</text>
  <text start="596.79" dur="3.87">classified information Procedures Act</text>
  <text start="598.77" dur="3.66">also known as CIPA and the purpose of</text>
  <text start="600.66" dur="4.53">CIPA is there&amp;#39;s the classified</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="4.65">information Procedures Act is to defend</text>
  <text start="605.19" dur="6.23">information that&amp;#39;s confidential that</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="7.47">could be harmful to national security in</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="5.2">criminal trial proceedings or civil</text>
  <text start="614.55" dur="3.539">trial proceedings when information is</text>
  <text start="616.62" dur="5.3">found through discovery or other means</text>
  <text start="618.089" dur="6.991">during a trial that could have an impact</text>
  <text start="621.92" dur="5.53">negatively on national security it can</text>
  <text start="625.08" dur="3.93">be deemed classified and there are</text>
  <text start="627.45" dur="4.77">procedures where you can actually have a</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="6.84">trial define terms of what has</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="5.64">classified information and you can then</text>
  <text start="635.85" dur="4.35">have that information be stored and kept</text>
  <text start="637.86" dur="4.8">secret and outside of the court&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.2" dur="4.889">findings because it has been it has been</text>
  <text start="642.66" dur="5.549">deemed to be classified and an imminent</text>
  <text start="645.089" dur="4.62">threat to national security so how it</text>
  <text start="648.209" dur="4.231">defines that information which is so</text>
  <text start="649.709" dur="7.441">interesting to me is right here in what</text>
  <text start="652.44" dur="9.7">would this be to 2054</text>
  <text start="657.15" dur="8.68">section one subsection a subsection one</text>
  <text start="662.14" dur="5.76">saying any information or material that</text>
  <text start="665.83" dur="3.81">has been determined by the United States</text>
  <text start="667.9" dur="5.22">government pursuant to an executive</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="5.28">order statute or regulation to require</text>
  <text start="673.12" dur="3.03">protection against unauthorized</text>
  <text start="674.92" dur="3.75">disclosure for reasons of national</text>
  <text start="676.15" dur="4.59">security so if everything that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="5.13">being basically following here which is</text>
  <text start="680.74" dur="4.68">the narrative that there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="683.8" dur="3.24">investigations going on at the</text>
  <text start="685.42" dur="3.54">Department of Justice Jeff Sessions has</text>
  <text start="687.04" dur="3.84">been running other investigations that</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t have anything to do with the rush</text>
  <text start="690.88" dur="3.959">of collusion because he recused himself</text>
  <text start="692.41" dur="6.15">to basically take himself out of the</text>
  <text start="694.839" dur="5.611">public you know get him out of the</text>
  <text start="698.56" dur="3.84">public&amp;#39;s eye so we can actually work and</text>
  <text start="700.45" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s been working on these other cases</text>
  <text start="702.4" dur="4.17">things like going over what happened in</text>
  <text start="704.77" dur="3.42">the Clinton investigation going over</text>
  <text start="706.57" dur="3.98">what happened with this awan DNC server</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="4.38">scandal doing all of this an</text>
  <text start="710.55" dur="4.99">investigation that&amp;#39;s been going on since</text>
  <text start="712.57" dur="5.58">November where when Inspector Horowitz</text>
  <text start="715.54" dur="4.23">started his investigation and John Huber</text>
  <text start="718.15" dur="4.8">I think was already being consulted on</text>
  <text start="719.77" dur="6.33">that so they have an over eight month</text>
  <text start="722.95" dur="4.74">investigation going or ten nine ten</text>
  <text start="726.1" dur="5.43">month investigation at this point</text>
  <text start="727.69" dur="4.92">and they&amp;#39;re actually you know uncovering</text>
  <text start="731.53" dur="2.01">a lot of things and if that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="2.61">narrative that we&amp;#39;re going to follow</text>
  <text start="733.54" dur="5.58">then it would make sense that inside of</text>
  <text start="735.22" dur="5.91">this trial CIPA had to have been enacted</text>
  <text start="739.12" dur="4.2">classified information had to have been</text>
  <text start="741.13" dur="3.63">found through discovery or other through</text>
  <text start="743.32" dur="4.32">other means whether it was through</text>
  <text start="744.76" dur="4.28">discovery or if it was through a wand</text>
  <text start="747.64" dur="3.3">himself</text>
  <text start="749.04" dur="4.06">negotiating a plea deal to become a</text>
  <text start="750.94" dur="4.82">prosecuting witness whatever the</text>
  <text start="753.1" dur="5.82">situation is people should be you know</text>
  <text start="755.76" dur="5.86">proverbially you know wetting their</text>
  <text start="758.92" dur="4.8">pants at this point because if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="761.62" dur="3.96">involved with this and you see one</text>
  <text start="763.72" dur="4.17">getting just a little slap on the wrist</text>
  <text start="765.58" dur="3.45">and in this information through that was</text>
  <text start="767.89" dur="3.87">found either through discovery or</text>
  <text start="769.03" dur="4.71">through his volunteer testimony has been</text>
  <text start="771.76" dur="3.48">deemed classified information and it is</text>
  <text start="773.74" dur="2.969">pertaining to national security then</text>
  <text start="775.24" dur="2.94">there is definitely something going on</text>
  <text start="776.709" dur="3.241">beneath the surface that needs to be</text>
  <text start="778.18" dur="4.8">looked at now another thing that people</text>
  <text start="779.95" dur="5.009">wanted to point to is that and I kind of</text>
  <text start="782.98" dur="3.84">skipped over this but when it says to</text>
  <text start="784.959" dur="3.341">think logically and logically thinking</text>
  <text start="786.82" dur="2.65">that were</text>
  <text start="788.3" dur="4.35">kind of skipping over something that</text>
  <text start="789.47" dur="4.47">would be important okay what on the</text>
  <text start="792.65" dur="3.96">Anton&amp;#39;s pointed out that during this</text>
  <text start="793.94" dur="6.75">trial if they are finding information is</text>
  <text start="796.61" dur="7.2">Q is said here that has some of the most</text>
  <text start="800.69" dur="5.94">senior elected officials involved in</text>
  <text start="803.81" dur="5.58">treason then it is very possible that</text>
  <text start="806.63" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s either gonna be handled in a court</text>
  <text start="809.39" dur="4.95">where treason would be handled which is</text>
  <text start="810.71" dur="6.03">some sort of military court as a crime</text>
  <text start="814.34" dur="5.91">against our country and or it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="816.74" dur="5.46">put together as a RICO case meaning the</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="4.53">discovery and information found or if</text>
  <text start="822.2" dur="6.75">the testimony given by a Juan actually</text>
  <text start="824.78" dur="5.28">led to having a stronger case for Rico</text>
  <text start="828.95" dur="5.25">now for those of you don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="6.09">Rico is Rico is the Racketeer Influenced</text>
  <text start="834.2" dur="4.05">and Corrupt Organizations Act now what</text>
  <text start="836.15" dur="4.77">this was was put together to take down</text>
  <text start="838.25" dur="4.08">basically criminal enterprises where</text>
  <text start="840.92" dur="3.68">there&amp;#39;s more than one individual working</text>
  <text start="842.33" dur="6.3">in a criminal organization in order to</text>
  <text start="844.6" dur="6.76">effectively enact crimes like</text>
  <text start="848.63" dur="4.86">racketeering and so on and so forth a</text>
  <text start="851.36" dur="7.16">bribery extortion whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="853.49" dur="8.73">put it out there but this was all set up</text>
  <text start="858.52" dur="5.65">in order to get you know mob families to</text>
  <text start="862.22" dur="4.35">get criminal organizations like I said</text>
  <text start="864.17" dur="5.43">that that are working in tandem now can</text>
  <text start="866.57" dur="4.68">this be applied through the findings of</text>
  <text start="869.6" dur="4.11">just through discovery of the trial that</text>
  <text start="871.25" dur="3.36">would been deemed classifying and threat</text>
  <text start="873.71" dur="3.69">to national security</text>
  <text start="874.61" dur="4.26">could this you know have strengthened</text>
  <text start="877.4" dur="7.62">the case for the government to make a</text>
  <text start="878.87" dur="8.45">RICO Act case against an enterprise that</text>
  <text start="885.02" dur="4.71">consists of several senior members of</text>
  <text start="887.32" dur="4.93">government that would be certainly</text>
  <text start="889.73" dur="5.46">something to be noted and it would seem</text>
  <text start="892.25" dur="5.25">at this point that there is evidence to</text>
  <text start="895.19" dur="3.69">point to this being the case possibly</text>
  <text start="897.5" dur="3.87">but we don&amp;#39;t have all that information</text>
  <text start="898.88" dur="5.07">yet and we don&amp;#39;t have a lot more to go</text>
  <text start="901.37" dur="4.35">on at this point as qyz says we have a</text>
  <text start="903.95" dur="3.21">lot more than we know and at this point</text>
  <text start="905.72" dur="2.85">to be able to put together and draw the</text>
  <text start="907.16" dur="3.6">connection between the dots that we can</text>
  <text start="908.57" dur="4.23">now it&amp;#39;s actually a lot more than the</text>
  <text start="910.76" dur="4.38">mainstream media has so we&amp;#39;re definitely</text>
  <text start="912.8" dur="4.38">ahead of them in the truth behind what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="915.14" dur="5.31">going on here and the reality is is that</text>
  <text start="917.18" dur="5.01">there is so much more to this case as</text>
  <text start="920.45" dur="3.78">far as people involved</text>
  <text start="922.19" dur="5.28">that were committed and it&amp;#39;s all gonna</text>
  <text start="924.23" dur="5.46">have to get laid out in a series of</text>
  <text start="927.47" dur="4.26">indictments it&amp;#39;s all going to have to be</text>
  <text start="929.69" dur="3.6">you know it&amp;#39;s all gonna have to come</text>
  <text start="931.73" dur="2.94">together in a certain way you know</text>
  <text start="933.29" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s interesting is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="934.67" dur="5.91">certainly something to be said for the</text>
  <text start="936.65" dur="8.97">fact that we have four hundred and</text>
  <text start="940.58" dur="7.74">seventy investigators working with John</text>
  <text start="945.62" dur="5.97">Huber and Inspector General Michael</text>
  <text start="948.32" dur="5.55">Horowitz in investigating a number of</text>
  <text start="951.59" dur="4.92">different issues that all connect back</text>
  <text start="953.87" dur="4.56">to the DNC through either the Hillary</text>
  <text start="956.51" dur="5.31">Clinton campaign the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="958.43" dur="5.22">or the the email scandal with the FBI</text>
  <text start="961.82" dur="4.41">and higher justice there&amp;#39;s always this</text>
  <text start="963.65" dur="4.77">this theme that connects back to the DNC</text>
  <text start="966.23" dur="4.85">and that&amp;#39;s why I want and that server is</text>
  <text start="968.42" dur="8.19">so important and as Q told us in the</text>
  <text start="971.08" dur="6.7">post previously we have the server so</text>
  <text start="976.61" dur="3.24">they have it they have the information</text>
  <text start="977.78" dur="3.24">but imagine that what&amp;#39;s been found on</text>
  <text start="979.85" dur="4.65">that server has been deemed classified</text>
  <text start="981.02" dur="5.76">and that would be why Q gave us this</text>
  <text start="984.5" dur="4.14">little snippet and if you want to read</text>
  <text start="986.78" dur="3.69">through this it&amp;#39;s fairly interesting I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="988.64" dur="3.42">sure you can find it just by googling</text>
  <text start="990.47" dur="3.15">this right here if you want to pause it</text>
  <text start="992.06" dur="3.63">you can write that down and google it</text>
  <text start="993.62" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;ll pull it up in no time</text>
  <text start="995.69" dur="4.98">but that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at and then</text>
  <text start="997.82" dur="5.52">here&amp;#39;s Q another great post saying add</text>
  <text start="1000.67" dur="4.26">another add another to the list and it</text>
