  <text start="133.89" dur="4.95">nation is all about it&amp;#39;s about a legal</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="5.46">framework codified in a document the</text>

  <text start="215.59" dur="6.3">remember your oath united we stand q and</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="3.84">all I can say is that we need to show</text>
  <text start="221.89" dur="3.719">our support to the men and women who are</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="4.41">serving bravely in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="225.609" dur="3.72">agencies who are working to expose this</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="4.799">evil especially those who are connected</text>
  <text start="229.329" dur="4.651">with Q I think it&amp;#39;s easy for us to</text>
  <text start="232.359" dur="3.571">overlook the fact that what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="5.94">dealing with here is not just your</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="6.139">everyday coincidence that this person</text>
  <text start="239.92" dur="5.76">this online persona this collective is</text>
  <text start="242.069" dur="5.081">so attuned to what&amp;#39;s going on so adept</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="4.679">at understanding this information</text>
  <text start="247.15" dur="4.739">sharing and disseminating it and you</text>
  <text start="250.359" dur="3.63">know I think we need to recognize that</text>
  <text start="251.889" dur="3.901">first and foremost and say thank you and</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="4.68">say a prayer for the men and women who</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="4.65">are serving bravely to do this job so</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="3.631">with that being said let&amp;#39;s watch this</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="7.009">other video and it&amp;#39;s General Michael</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="8.429">Flynn and basically he&amp;#39;s giving this a</text>
  <text start="267.449" dur="4.631">speech at a dinner and we covered this</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="3.601">in the last video which I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="3.869">mention by the way if you guys wanna</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="3.899">watch the latest video watch it right</text>
  <text start="275.949" dur="3.84">here you can get more insight on</text>
  <text start="278.229" dur="4.47">everything that we talked about we</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="4.62">talked about this actual post from this</text>
  <text start="282.699" dur="3.9">dinner I guess where Michael Flint posed</text>
  <text start="284.409" dur="4.741">with these two individuals who according</text>
  <text start="286.599" dur="4.981">to you guys in the comments I think one</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="4.59">of the the people in this picture is</text>
  <text start="291.58" dur="4.86">actually responsible for the Twitter</text>
  <text start="293.74" dur="3.929">account educating liberals but I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="3.18">sure about that you guys all have to</text>
  <text start="297.669" dur="3.421">fact-check me down in the comments but</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="3.24">if you guys want to watch this video I</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="4.579">encourage you to go back here watch this</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="6.15">video of course as soon as I posted it</text>
  <text start="305.669" dur="6.521">within five minutes YouTube had D</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="5.07">monetized it but that&amp;#39;s okay because the</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="4.02">information is still up there my only</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="3.99">big concern with that is not about the</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.59">the money I mean obviously I try to</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="4.77">support myself and my family doing this</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="3.72">is my career but and when they do that</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s an economic sanction that I think</text>
  <text start="324.52" dur="8.34">is completely unprovoked unwarranted and</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="8">it becomes a form of discrimination that</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="6.239">aside what I do think it does is it</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="6.19">disallows videos to gain the traction</text>
  <text start="339.099" dur="6.511">that they should get so meaning when</text>
  <text start="342.55" dur="3.75">they mark it with this D monetization my</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="4.619">basic</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="5.459">premise is not that it&amp;#39;s necessarily not</text>
  <text start="350.229" dur="3.421">the main point being that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.759" dur="5.16">something that&amp;#39;s monetarily affecting</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="5.549">the ability for me to uh you know work</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="4.861">freely in the open a free market but</text>
  <text start="359.199" dur="6.21">more overly when these videos get put</text>
  <text start="361.78" dur="5.99">into their suggested categories with the</text>
  <text start="365.409" dur="5.82">algorithms and how it you know kind of</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="5.799">diverts that traffic I think that it</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="5.4">assigns a lower priority to videos that</text>
  <text start="373.569" dur="4.921">don&amp;#39;t have full monetization simply if</text>
  <text start="376.629" dur="4.981">not just for the simple fact that</text>
  <text start="378.49" dur="5.639">YouTube is a business that is trying to</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="5.51">make money and if a video is not fully</text>
  <text start="384.129" dur="5.401">able to monetize the content then what</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="5.13">incentive would they have to push that</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="6.84">video to their subscriber or to their</text>
  <text start="392.25" dur="6.25">you know audience I mean and to me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.37" dur="5.009">quite it would seem that it would be</text>
  <text start="398.5" dur="5.37">quite limited their incentive or</text>
  <text start="401.379" dur="3.931">motivation to do that and I follow up</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="3.96">with these people but they never seem to</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="4.259">want to give me a straight answer so the</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="4.649">best thing we can do is just watch this</text>
  <text start="409.569" dur="5.16">video share it and share it try to make</text>
  <text start="412.479" dur="3.18">it as big as you can because this is the</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="3.12">kind of information that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.659" dur="4.41">terrified of and that&amp;#39;s why we have to</text>
  <text start="417.849" dur="4.5">put it up there because as I said to</text>
  <text start="420.069" dur="3.84">them I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t violate any of</text>
  <text start="422.349" dur="3.391">your policies I haven&amp;#39;t violated any of</text>
  <text start="423.909" dur="4.591">your guidelines I don&amp;#39;t understand why</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="6.39">you&amp;#39;re unfairly targeting us videos at</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="6.659">you know in my library constantly and</text>
  <text start="432.13" dur="4.469">but still no reasonable answer from them</text>
  <text start="435.159" dur="3.81">but we&amp;#39;re going to talk about them at</text>
  <text start="436.599" dur="3.991">the end here so that was a little bit of</text>
  <text start="438.969" dur="2.73">a rant beside to what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="440.59" dur="3">about here and what we&amp;#39;re about to watch</text>
  <text start="441.699" dur="6.09">was which is this general Flint video</text>
  <text start="443.59" dur="6.509">but again go watch this video watch</text>
  <text start="447.789" dur="3.93">these other videos share them definitely</text>
  <text start="450.099" dur="3.72">is a great way to get that information</text>
  <text start="451.719" dur="3.781">now let&amp;#39;s watch General Flint give this</text>
  <text start="453.819" dur="4.53">incredible speech we&amp;#39;re gonna watch the</text>
  <text start="455.5" dur="5.069">whole thing from here forward until he</text>
  <text start="458.349" dur="6.421">finishes speaking because it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="460.569" dur="8.4">and I believe in my you know in what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="6.42">doing here I believe that what cue is</text>
  <text start="468.969" dur="4.741">doing is is what&amp;#39;s best for our country</text>
  <text start="471.19" dur="5.13">right now is exposing this evil and I do</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="5.879">believe that general Flint has a good</text>
  <text start="476.32" dur="3.73">idea of what Q is so you guys can go</text>
  <text start="479.589" dur="4.631">ahead and</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="5.79">this gonna be a lot of people that will</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="3.449">especially in the back row that it will</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="4.229">pay attention to whatever the heck I say</text>
  <text start="487.669" dur="3.96">and want to make sure that they that</text>
  <text start="490.069" dur="3.69">they get the words that I say right</text>

  <text start="895.56" dur="7.92">that are monumental Wow</text>
  <text start="899.07" dur="8.1">that is so incredible I am so humbled</text>
  <text start="903.48" dur="6.83">and truly grateful that we have people</text>
  <text start="907.17" dur="6.86">like general Flint out there promoting</text>
  <text start="910.31" dur="7.45">not only that the judeo-christian values</text>
  <text start="914.03" dur="7.36">that our societies built on but also</text>
  <text start="917.76" dur="5.79">promoting an incredible spirit an</text>

  <text start="923.55" dur="6.27">resilience in a spirit of never giving</text>
  <text start="926.79" dur="6.93">up and what it means to be an American</text>
  <text start="929.82" dur="7.05">you love God in my opinion or whatever</text>
  <text start="933.72" dur="5.1">you do I mean it&amp;#39;s freedom really but in</text>
  <text start="936.87" dur="4.86">my opinion you have to look to God and</text>
  <text start="938.82" dur="6.06">then you have this incredible gift of</text>
  <text start="941.73" dur="8.39">freedom and it&amp;#39;s all in short by the</text>
  <text start="944.88" dur="5.24">Constitution it&amp;#39;s all backed by these</text>
  <text start="950.18" dur="7.18">cornerstones of our nation&amp;#39;s makeup but</text>
  <text start="955.38" dur="5.04">then there are men and women out there</text>
  <text start="957.36" dur="4.92">who are serving us every single day and</text>
  <text start="960.42" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re sacrificing even if they aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="962.28" dur="6.33">actually giving their lives they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="964.05" dur="8.67">sacrificing that their you know their</text>
  <text start="968.61" dur="6.18">time their families their whole lives to</text>
  <text start="972.72" dur="5.91">to basically ensure that we have an</text>
  <text start="974.79" dur="6.48">opportunity to be successful to beef</text>
  <text start="978.63" dur="4.59">to enjoy the the constitutionally</text>
  <text start="981.27" dur="5.48">guaranteed rights and like general Flynn</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="6.53">was saying in quoting Ronald Reagan yes</text>
  <text start="986.75" dur="6.13">that freedom that we take for granted is</text>
  <text start="989.75" dur="6.22">always just one generation away and if</text>
  <text start="992.88" dur="7.41">we let our generation deteriorate into</text>
  <text start="995.97" dur="8.64">this lower-level form of you know</text>
  <text start="1000.29" dur="7.23">complete just nihilism defeatism and and</text>
  <text start="1004.61" dur="6.93">just complete social decay that that is</text>
  <text start="1007.52" dur="6.57">basically machined by these corporations</text>
  <text start="1011.54" dur="4.89">that take advantage of individuals they</text>
  <text start="1014.09" dur="4.8">take advantage of you in every way</text>
  <text start="1016.43" dur="3.81">possible it&amp;#39;s like the one of the best</text>
  <text start="1018.89" dur="3.51">things that I think&amp;#39;s come out recently</text>
  <text start="1020.24" dur="4.949">is when we talk about Google which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1022.4" dur="5.58">going to talk about right now it says</text>
  <text start="1025.189" dur="6.601">you know if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="1027.98" dur="6.359">service and it&amp;#39;s free remember you are</text>
  <text start="1031.79" dur="3.99">the product meaning you you are the one</text>
  <text start="1034.339" dur="4.531">who is being bought and sold your</text>
  <text start="1035.78" dur="5.309">information is what Google&amp;#39;s run off of</text>
  <text start="1038.87" dur="4.589">and in that we&amp;#39;re gonna go ahead and</text>
  <text start="1041.089" dur="4.141">look at this very interesting is a few</text>
  <text start="1043.459" dur="4.201">things to point out here first of all</text>
  <text start="1045.23" dur="4.83">this is an article out of the intercept</text>
  <text start="1047.66" dur="4.47">that came out a few days ago talking</text>
  <text start="1050.06" dur="4.53">about a senior Google scientist who has</text>
  <text start="1052.13" dur="5.34">resigned over the forfeiture of our</text>
  <text start="1054.59" dur="6.24">values quote unquote in his words in</text>
  <text start="1057.47" dur="5.49">China now what is he talking about well</text>
  <text start="1060.83" dur="4.8">the article basically goes into the fact</text>
  <text start="1062.96" dur="6.21">that this guy right here you see his</text>
  <text start="1065.63" dur="5.67">face his name&amp;#39;s Jack Paulson and he was</text>
  <text start="1069.17" dur="4.92">a engineer machine intelligence</text>
  <text start="1071.3" dur="5.58">department worker over at Google and</text>
  <text start="1074.09" dur="6.78">they were working on basically creating</text>
  <text start="1076.88" dur="9.87">this search our air search BOTS</text>
  <text start="1080.87" dur="8.01">basically for the Chinese Google so what</text>
  <text start="1086.75" dur="4.56">it was basically according to the</text>
  <text start="1088.88" dur="4.71">article here was it was a search system</text>
  <text start="1091.31" dur="4.8">codenamed dragonfly which was designed</text>
  <text start="1093.59" dur="4.11">to remove content that China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1096.11" dur="4.35">authoritarian government views as</text>
  <text start="1097.7" dur="4.5">sensitive such as the information about</text>
  <text start="1100.46" dur="3.48">political dissidents free speech</text>
  <text start="1102.2" dur="7.2">democracy human rights and peaceful</text>
  <text start="1103.94" dur="7.27">protest now I would like to present to</text>
  <text start="1109.4" dur="8.909">you tonight here</text>
  <text start="1111.21" dur="7.099">a case about why this is the most</text>
  <text start="1118.73" dur="6.37">pressing issue as far as a problem goes</text>
  <text start="1121.89" dur="6.09">that we have ever faced as a society in</text>
  <text start="1125.1" dur="5.61">the modern digital age and I&amp;#39;ll explain</text>
  <text start="1127.98" dur="5.73">it by simply saying look at what China</text>
  <text start="1130.71" dur="4.8">does to their Internet what look at the</text>
  <text start="1133.71" dur="4.439">way China lives look at how the</text>
  <text start="1135.51" dur="7.409">authoritarian communist party there</text>
  <text start="1138.149" dur="8.4">seems to be quite wealthy and they have</text>
  <text start="1142.919" dur="5.37">a very small burgeoning middle class but</text>
  <text start="1146.549" dur="5.541">the reality is is that you if you look</text>
  <text start="1148.289" dur="9.51">at China demographically it is</text>
  <text start="1152.09" dur="8.91">incredibly opposite to what you would</text>
  <text start="1157.799" dur="6.421">want here in the United States that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1161" dur="5.86">the simple way to put it and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1164.22" dur="5.16">going to get into derision or a</text>
  <text start="1166.86" dur="5.15">breakdown of China because I do a lot of</text>
  <text start="1169.38" dur="4.74">research for China in my spare time and</text>
  <text start="1172.01" dur="3.94">that is going to be another Channel</text>
  <text start="1174.12" dur="5.929">hopefully somewhere down the line but</text>
  <text start="1175.95" dur="6.599">this is for me to say that you have an</text>
  <text start="1180.049" dur="4.87">engineer working in Google who is</text>
  <text start="1182.549" dur="9.831">realizing that what he is a part of is</text>
  <text start="1184.919" dur="10.201">the literal embodiment of Orwell&amp;#39;s 1984</text>
  <text start="1192.38" dur="6.73">where you have an authoritarian</text>
  <text start="1195.12" dur="8.13">dictatorial regime coming in and</text>
  <text start="1199.11" dur="7.41">actually literally becoming the thought</text>
  <text start="1203.25" dur="7.38">police becoming the arbiters of free</text>
  <text start="1206.52" dur="7.08">speech and thought now that is the</text>
  <text start="1210.63" dur="4.919">antithesis of Western society in my</text>
  <text start="1213.6" dur="6.299">opinion that is truly the antithesis of</text>
  <text start="1215.549" dur="7.73">the US Constitution and our principles</text>
  <text start="1219.899" dur="7.291">as a nation now when you examine this</text>
  <text start="1223.279" dur="7.451">you can see quite clearly that people of</text>
  <text start="1227.19" dur="8.459">conscious will actually look at this and</text>
  <text start="1230.73" dur="7.5">say this is not on the level this is not</text>
  <text start="1235.649" dur="5.611">what we should be aiming for society as</text>
  <text start="1238.23" dur="6.21">a whole not just for China but for</text>
  <text start="1241.26" dur="3.57">ourselves we cannot condone I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1244.44" dur="4.979">where your</text>
  <text start="1244.83" dur="7.29">business lies I mean it&amp;#39;s one thing to</text>
  <text start="1249.419" dur="5.49">have you know open and free markets but</text>
  <text start="1252.12" dur="5.52">you have to have the regulatory capacity</text>
  <text start="1254.909" dur="6.36">to say we&amp;#39;re not gonna let Chinese</text>
  <text start="1257.64" dur="6.33">companies sell us lead toys for our kids</text>
  <text start="1261.269" dur="3.921">and then let them steal billions if not</text>
  <text start="1263.97" dur="3.99">trillions of dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="1265.19" dur="7.75">intellectual property while at the same</text>
  <text start="1267.96" dur="8.67">time looking at it as oh well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1272.94" dur="6.599">gonna go ahead and just ignore the fact</text>
  <text start="1276.63" dur="4.59">that as a US company that got its start</text>
  <text start="1279.539" dur="5.64">here in the US and as we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="1281.22" dur="6.059">before with Google Google originated out</text>
  <text start="1285.179" dur="3.96">of a lot of very deep research by the</text>
  <text start="1287.279" dur="4.02">government now for them to turn around</text>
  <text start="1289.139" dur="3.991">and say that they&amp;#39;re bigger than the</text>
  <text start="1291.299" dur="3.87">government now therefore they can choose</text>
  <text start="1293.13" dur="6.35">they can pick winners and losers on the</text>
  <text start="1295.169" dur="9.661">global scale meaning they can side with</text>
  <text start="1299.48" dur="8.169">China that to me is the the whole</text>
  <text start="1304.83" dur="4.979">problem with it all so we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="1307.649" dur="3.601">to go ahead and just take a minute and I</text>
  <text start="1309.809" dur="3.96">want to share this video with you</text>
  <text start="1311.25" dur="6.809">because it shows exactly what they think</text>
  <text start="1313.769" dur="6.15">about for in my opinion myself and a lot</text>
  <text start="1318.059" dur="3.901">of people we have how many people have</text>
  <text start="1319.919" dur="4.321">hundred thousand people subscribed you</text>
  <text start="1321.96" dur="4.86">have millions of views so all of you</text>
  <text start="1324.24" dur="8.46">guys out there this is what they think</text>
  <text start="1326.82" dur="8.099">about you most people here are pretty</text>
  <text start="1332.7" dur="4.53">upset and pretty sad because of the</text>
  <text start="1334.919" dur="4.14">election it did feel like a ton of</text>
  <text start="1337.23" dur="3.75">bricks dropped on my chest from</text>
  <text start="1339.059" dur="3.901">specifically who I know many of us find</text>
  <text start="1340.98" dur="4.23">very offensive and I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to</text>
  <text start="1342.96" dur="4.349">talk to a lot of fellow Googlers and</text>
  <text start="1345.21" dur="5.16">people have said different words similar</text>
  <text start="1347.309" dur="4.98">concept how painful this is I find a lot</text>
  <text start="1350.37" dur="4.019">of so many things with Trump said very</text>
  <text start="1352.289" dur="4.11">offensive there is a lot of fear within</text>
  <text start="1354.389" dur="3.75">Google I&amp;#39;m seeing Googlers who are full</text>
  <text start="1356.399" dur="3.811">of fear there are people who are very</text>
  <text start="1358.139" dur="4.851">afraid they&amp;#39;re full of fear about the</text>
  <text start="1360.21" dur="6.3">future I certainly find the selection</text>
  <text start="1362.99" dur="7.649">deeply offensive and I know many of you</text>
  <text start="1366.51" dur="7.279">do too a very stressful time and it</text>
  <text start="1370.639" dur="6.891">conflicts with many of our values</text>
  <text start="1373.789" dur="7.311">immigrants or minorities women</text>
  <text start="1377.53" dur="6.33">Black&amp;#39;s you know people were afraid</text>
  <text start="1381.1" dur="4.14">based on religion the LGBTQ community I</text>
  <text start="1383.86" dur="6.36">would just advise us all to become</text>
  <text start="1385.24" dur="9">that&amp;#39;s what they think of you and to me</text>
  <text start="1390.22" dur="6.15">you know we have to understand that that</text>
  <text start="1394.24" dur="4.71">is not representative of our whole</text>
  <text start="1396.37" dur="5.88">country and it seems incredibly biased</text>
  <text start="1398.95" dur="5.94">and skewed and to the tune of an</text>
  <text start="1402.25" dur="4.92">incredible proportion because if you</text>
  <text start="1404.89" dur="6.48">think about the proportion of control of</text>
  <text start="1407.17" dur="6.23">the exhibit or exert over each or</text>
  <text start="1411.37" dur="4.59">basically all information that&amp;#39;s digital</text>

  <text start="1415.96" dur="7.35">representative of basically half of the</text>

  <text start="1423.31" dur="7.32">agree with and seem to have an</text>
  <text start="1426.88" dur="5.22">incomplete biased against that to me is</text>
  <text start="1430.63" dur="7.62">really disturbing especially when it</text>
  <text start="1432.1" dur="10.13">comes to their it&amp;#39;s seemingly using</text>
  <text start="1438.25" dur="9.93">their platform to disallow others with</text>
  <text start="1442.23" dur="9.43">basically dissenting opinions from being</text>
