  <text start="11.19" dur="5.52">based on quality and so we&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="13.799" dur="5.341">that same notion and approach to YouTube</text>
  <text start="16.71" dur="6.39">so that we can rank higher quality stuff</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="5.67">better and really prevent borderline</text>
  <text start="23.1" dur="3.419">content content which doesn&amp;#39;t exactly</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="3.69">violate policies which need to be</text>
  <text start="26.519" dur="5.371">removed thing we are trying to do is to</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="5.67">bring more authoritative sources and</text>
  <text start="31.89" dur="4.079">fact checks on videos which may be</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="3.36">controversial it&amp;#39;s a case where we got</text>
  <text start="35.969" dur="3.081">it wrong but that&amp;#39;s what we are trying</text>
  <text start="37.53" dur="5.4">to do and we are working hard to improve</text>

  <text start="62.73" dur="4.38">work hard to get right and you know and</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="4.35">and every few years we feel the need to</text>
  <text start="67.11" dur="4.68">evolve them because we see changes in</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="4.411">how the platform is getting used just</text>

  <text start="73.71" dur="5.94">to our eight speech policy at YouTube we</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="4.949">are very focused on removing harmful</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="4.649">content and reducing the spread of what</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="3.93">we think of us bought in content just</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="3.93">last quarter we removed over nine</text>
  <text start="85.799" dur="4.71">million videos and and so it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="5.39">ongoing process but this more we need to</text>

  <text start="159.93" dur="4.56">yeah just to basically sum it up for</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="3.27">people it&amp;#39;s digital book burning for</text>
  <text start="164.49" dur="3.3">being erased from the internet for</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="4.38">supporting the President Trump or for</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="5.58">having a dissident view to fake news and</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="4.86">big tech yeah thank you for exploited</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="4.8">because that was what I wanted to start</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="6.259">with explaining to the audience what</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="5.61">stop bit burning is and what it means</text>
  <text start="181.519" dur="4.141">the reason I&amp;#39;m having you on here is</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="4.05">because we&amp;#39;ve been having some great</text>
  <text start="185.66" dur="6.01">dialogues with a lot of different</text>
  <text start="187.83" dur="6.689">creators across the spectrum and the one</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="6.02">common thing that we all share is this</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="6.511">experience with big tech where we are</text>
  <text start="197.69" dur="6.43">under attack for a lack of a better term</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="5.25">we are constantly under attack for</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="5.22">trying to get our message out there and</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="5.489">it&amp;#39;s one of those things that makes you</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="4.86">really stop and think and once you start</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="3.961">looking at the facts that&amp;#39;s when it gets</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="3.96">even more disturbing and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="3.96">stopped it burning has been able to do</text>
  <text start="218.16" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s been able to bring together</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="5.31">legal experts with content creators with</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="5.13">you know social media other social media</text>
  <text start="225" dur="5.84">influencers with just other people in</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="5.299">general that are out there who are</text>
  <text start="230.84" dur="5.35">experiencing this kind of tech</text>
  <text start="233.209" dur="3.791">technocratic fascistic censorship on a</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="5.13">regular base</text>
  <text start="237" dur="6.78">and they really have no you know</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="4.53">recourse except to kind of come together</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="4.41">and start fleshing out these ideas of</text>
  <text start="245.85" dur="4.53">you know how do we fight this how do we</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="4.5">address what the problem is and then how</text>
  <text start="250.38" dur="4.95">do we move forward so I want to start by</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="5.46">asking you what you can tell us about</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="5.249">stop it burning what you can tell us</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="5.34">about the movement who&amp;#39;s involved so far</text>
  <text start="260.579" dur="4.291">and you know kind of let&amp;#39;s start there</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="2.49">because this is gonna kind of lay the</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="4.02">groundwork for what we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="265.98" dur="5.79">about here sure thank you Frank</text>
  <text start="268.89" dur="5.1">um so obviously if bit burning itself as</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="5.52">digital censorship stop that burning is</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="5.46">a campaign to bring together a coalition</text>
  <text start="277.29" dur="4.29">of people who for the most part</text>
  <text start="279.45" dur="3.75">themselves have suffered censorship or</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="4.23">you know even if they just care about</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="5.01">free speech come together because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.56">stronger together and individually we</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="5.19">are sort of being slow boiled like a</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="5.549">frog and we&amp;#39;re sort of losing reach</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re losing certainly income being</text>
  <text start="295.919" dur="6.781">demonetized we&amp;#39;re being drained out</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="5.67">flushed out driven out and just erased</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="4.89">from the internet so by coming together</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="5.1">we can actually possibly even back</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="5.4">illegal action back in campaign raise</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="5.1">awareness and and that&amp;#39;s kind of a goal</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="3.239">so far I don&amp;#39;t want to say who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="4.53">involved just yet because they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.229" dur="5.671">told me I can but a number of people are</text>
  <text start="319.29" dur="4.89">very interested the first meeting we had</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="5.91">roughly a month ago I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="324.18" dur="6.09">exact date now but they had about a</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="6.03">dozen or about 1314 people showed up</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="4.92">this time it was around 30 or more so it</text>
  <text start="333.84" dur="3.45">was just a short time and we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="335.19" dur="3.84">tripled the momentum is clearly there I</text>
  <text start="337.29" dur="2.939">mean everyone&amp;#39;s mad about it we have</text>
  <text start="339.03" dur="3.27">President Trump tweeting about</text>
  <text start="340.229" dur="3.601">censorship we have Congress people</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="3.57">asking them questions about it and then</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="4.11">we have Zuckerberg and others lying</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="3.57">about it so you know it&amp;#39;s clearly an</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="3.93">issue whose time has come</text>
  <text start="349.44" dur="5.46">and I feel like there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="4.35">definite power in unity here you know I</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="3.05">know you&amp;#39;ve been censored I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="4.29">censored you were recently demonetized</text>
  <text start="357.95" dur="4.9">you know welcome to the club</text>
  <text start="360.51" dur="4.77">and you know to say that on behalf of</text>
  <text start="362.85" dur="5.91">all of us cuz a while back they got most</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="5.85">of us with the Vox ad pocalypse so you</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="4.92">know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s it is a big club now</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="4.2">and you know that&amp;#39;s kind of the goal</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="4.049">with bit burning is just to bring us all</text>
  <text start="375.33" dur="4.62">together see what we can do if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.729" dur="4.801">millions of us sorry millions of us</text>
  <text start="379.95" dur="6.52">backing it and we can even possibly do a</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="6.01">class-action antitrust lawsuit</text>
  <text start="386.47" dur="5.22">yeah I think it&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="388.54" dur="6.15">you know everything you you highlighted</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;s is really important about what</text>
  <text start="394.69" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re going up against and I know that</text>
  <text start="396.73" dur="4.23">the the meaning the group itself grew</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="3.66">exponentially I mean like you said we</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="5.28">start off with like like the first call</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="4.65">like you said 1215 people and now what</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="3.78">we have 30 plus or something like that</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="4.22">and ladies and gentlemen me just say</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="5.28">even then we&amp;#39;re not naming names here</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="5.59">the people involved on the backend</text>
  <text start="415.3" dur="5.7">are some of the biggest youtubers out</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="4.77">there social media people out there from</text>
  <text start="421" dur="4.29">all the different social media platforms</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="4.41">and I can I can tell you that because</text>
  <text start="425.29" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;ve been in these calls and I know</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="6">who&amp;#39;s there so that in and of itself is</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="4.86">really important to remember and then</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="5.85">like you said about figuring out this</text>
  <text start="434.92" dur="5.58">whole class action idea or even just</text>
  <text start="438.67" dur="3.36">what we&amp;#39;ve gotten from these phone calls</text>
  <text start="440.5" dur="4.92">which I think&amp;#39;s really important is</text>
  <text start="442.03" dur="6.42">understanding legally what kind of</text>
  <text start="445.42" dur="5.28">recourse there is for us just in general</text>
  <text start="448.45" dur="4.41">whether it is in class action or whether</text>
  <text start="450.7" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s just in a form in the form of</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="4.559">understanding you know how they are</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="4.47">manipulating the system how the the big</text>
  <text start="457.419" dur="5.191">tech companies are breaking the law when</text>
  <text start="459.37" dur="5.97">they do these these practices which</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="5.4">undermine and undercut our ability to</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="5.579">grow undercut our ability to earn a</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="6.36">living and then also you know go to help</text>
  <text start="470.919" dur="5.731">the fake news you know media complex as</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="6.17">a whole and then how it&amp;#39;s all this kind</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="8.31">of cycle that we&amp;#39;re in right now and I</text>
  <text start="480.54" dur="5.22">really think that we&amp;#39;re in the middle of</text>
  <text start="484.96" dur="4.29">something that&amp;#39;s gonna be really</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="5.94">important in the midst of a collection</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="5.88">of individuals are gonna come together</text>
  <text start="491.7" dur="5.68">you know to really solve this problem by</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="4.44">examining it and then taking it on</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="6.39">headfirst what are your thoughts on</text>
  <text start="499.57" dur="5.61">where this goes from here well Craig</text>
  <text start="503.77" dur="3.899">you&amp;#39;ve always been a champion of free</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="4.65">speech and I like that about you I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="507.669" dur="4.68">hoping that by bringing all these guys</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="4.2">together and and sort of at least</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="4.111">raising awareness and bringing this to</text>
  <text start="514.03" dur="3.9">the national level of being censored</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="4.709">right before obviously this is just</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="5.46">another form of totalitarianism from the</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="4.651">left and it&amp;#39;s a form of you know trying</text>
  <text start="523.39" dur="3.99">to impeach president Trump and interfere</text>
  <text start="525.82" dur="4.019">in the 2020 election because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.38" dur="5.49">trying to stop the competition for the</text>
  <text start="529.839" dur="4.5">for the dying fake news and and you know</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;re winning you know some leaps and</text>
  <text start="534.339" dur="3.511">bounds were growing without shrinking</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re having mass layoffs but the</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="4.68">problem is the way the law is set up</text>
  <text start="539.95" dur="4.22">it&amp;#39;s really rigged in their favor it</text>
  <text start="542.53" dur="5.64">really protects them on a lot of levels</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="6.789">but there is kind of a no and that would</text>
  <text start="548.17" dur="4.59">be that you know from the free speech</text>
  <text start="550.959" dur="3.811">angle it&amp;#39;s hard to attack but from the</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="3.69">business angle it&amp;#39;s a lot more open and</text>
  <text start="554.77" dur="3.6">what they&amp;#39;re doing is clearly also a</text>
  <text start="556.45" dur="3.63">business attack on our you know as you</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="4.32">said it&amp;#39;s attack on our businesses it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.08" dur="3.93">an attack on our livelihoods so from a</text>
  <text start="562.69" dur="5.1">business angle they&amp;#39;re trying to drown</text>
  <text start="564.01" dur="6.27">us out that&amp;#39;s also illegal so this is a</text>
  <text start="567.79" dur="4.5">big attack angle for us through a class</text>
  <text start="570.28" dur="4.77">action antitrust which you know I</text>
  <text start="572.29" dur="4.35">commissioned with Todd McMurtry who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.05" dur="4.65">one of the super lawyers behind</text>
  <text start="576.64" dur="4.56">defending some of the salmon are some of</text>
  <text start="579.7" dur="4.139">their Covington students and Bigelow</text>
  <text start="581.2" dur="4.259">salmon against the big news media you</text>
  <text start="583.839" dur="4.471">know the fake news Giants that came</text>
  <text start="585.459" dur="4.621">against him and smeared the kids and it</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="3.6">was a big debacle and he was one of the</text>
  <text start="590.08" dur="4.62">champion lawyers that stood up to to</text>
  <text start="591.91" dur="5.79">sort of stand against Goliath in that</text>
  <text start="594.7" dur="5.43">situation so he&amp;#39;s the first guy I and I</text>
  <text start="597.7" dur="4.17">went to to talk to about this idea and I</text>
  <text start="600.13" dur="3.84">commissioned through him some research</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="4.02">and you know is very expensive but you</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="4.619">know he and his team were able to pull</text>
  <text start="605.89" dur="4.8">together kind of a couple different</text>
  <text start="608.589" dur="4.591">approaches the best of which he</text>
  <text start="610.69" dur="6.57">identified as you know a class-action</text>
  <text start="613.18" dur="6.72">antitrust so you know with that in mind</text>
  <text start="617.26" dur="4.38">I set forth to to just go out and</text>
  <text start="619.9" dur="4.5">communicate with as many of us as I</text>
  <text start="621.64" dur="4.08">could who had been through it clearly</text>
  <text start="624.4" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re angry about it they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="4.29">know what to do yet and I&amp;#39;ve had a very</text>
  <text start="628.15" dur="3.99">good reception from people they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="4.05">interested in hearing more they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="4.11">really know you know what to do yet and</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s always a possibility that</text>
  <text start="636.25" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ll have some sort of fundraising in</text>
  <text start="638.02" dur="4.11">the future to actually go for the legal</text>
  <text start="640.09" dur="3.87">campaign we&amp;#39;re not there yet we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="4.95">raising awareness but I mean like you</text>
  <text start="643.96" dur="5.52">said it&amp;#39;s growing exponentially and the</text>
  <text start="647.08" dur="3.99">great thing is too that you know what</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;ve done with Todd and bringing him</text>
  <text start="651.07" dur="5.49">in it helps but it but then you also</text>
  <text start="653.23" dur="5.67">have all these other you know very large</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="3.93">influencers and some of them have been</text>
  <text start="658.9" dur="4.05">fighting their own legal battles for</text>
  <text start="660.49" dur="5.88">quite some time and without getting</text>
  <text start="662.95" dur="5.04">specific on names I will say that when</text>
  <text start="666.37" dur="3.51">you look at the Communications Decency</text>
  <text start="667.99" dur="4.95">Act in the conversation that we always</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="6.24">have about publisher versus you know a</text>
  <text start="672.94" dur="4.41">platform and then the the way that this</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="3.93">has always looked at like you said in a</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="5.04">free speech sense I think the key point</text>
  <text start="680.05" dur="3.57">that we&amp;#39;re starting to realize as we</text>
  <text start="682.39" dur="3.75">come together and have more of these</text>
  <text start="683.62" dur="4.53">conversations is that it is the business</text>
  <text start="686.14" dur="4.5">side and that the business side may be</text>
  <text start="688.15" dur="4.17">where they are the most vulnerable it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.64" dur="3.72">where they think that they&amp;#39;re the the</text>
  <text start="692.32" dur="4.89">least vulnerable it really is where they</text>
  <text start="694.36" dur="4.29">are the most vulnerable because like</text>
  <text start="697.21" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ve talked about I&amp;#39;m not gonna get</text>
  <text start="698.65" dur="4.23">into the details of you know the CDA in</text>
  <text start="700.9" dur="3.3">different sections because that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="702.88" dur="4.26">getting a little too deep in the</text>
  <text start="704.2" dur="5.79">legalese of it but there&amp;#39;s an argument</text>
  <text start="707.14" dur="5.55">to be made that we&amp;#39;re all kind of coming</text>
  <text start="709.99" dur="5.49">together and seeing that when YouTube</text>
  <text start="712.69" dur="6.66">for example takes a video such as yours</text>
  <text start="715.48" dur="6.6">Truly&amp;#39;s and you know takes away all of</text>
  <text start="719.35" dur="6.87">my suggested videos that&amp;#39;s fine right</text>
  <text start="722.08" dur="6.99">but then if I&amp;#39;m doing an editorial on</text>
  <text start="726.22" dur="5.1">the news right and you&amp;#39;re replacing all</text>
  <text start="729.07" dur="5.04">of my content out of your suggested</text>
  <text start="731.32" dur="5.49">video with somebody who basically you</text>
  <text start="734.11" dur="4.77">could say is a competitor of mine such</text>
  <text start="736.81" dur="6.24">as Fox News and you&amp;#39;re showing that</text>
  <text start="738.88" dur="6.03">favor to them then and at the same time</text>
  <text start="743.05" dur="4.59">denying me the access to things like</text>
  <text start="744.91" dur="4.8">monetization and like you said suggests</text>
  <text start="747.64" dur="3.96">the videos there&amp;#39;s an argument to be</text>
  <text start="749.71" dur="3.66">made that they&amp;#39;re engaging in what would</text>
  <text start="751.6" dur="5.58">be called tortious interference against</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="5.58">my individual right to have a contract</text>
  <text start="757.18" dur="5.37">with a third party being that advertiser</text>
  <text start="758.95" dur="4.95">and the audience right so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="3.3">option as well</text>
  <text start="763.9" dur="4.68">yeah and diving deeper into all these</text>
  <text start="765.85" dur="3.63">different avenues I think is the most</text>
  <text start="768.58" dur="3.3">important</text>
  <text start="769.48" dur="4.02">part of understanding you know where</text>
  <text start="771.88" dur="4.05">this can go</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="3.899">as far as you know we&amp;#39;re fighting for</text>
  <text start="775.93" dur="3.99">free speech but we&amp;#39;re also fighting for</text>
  <text start="777.399" dur="5.37">the right to compete in a fair market</text>
  <text start="779.92" dur="5.789">you know to not have the system gamed</text>
  <text start="782.769" dur="5.31">against us and the decks rigged by the</text>
  <text start="785.709" dur="6.261">time we get to the table and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="788.079" dur="6.661">we see now for instance today if</text>
  <text start="791.97" dur="4.69">somebody tried to start a channel doing</text>
  <text start="794.74" dur="3.99">kind of similar content to what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="796.66" dur="4.229">doing I don&amp;#39;t think they would stand a</text>
  <text start="798.73" dur="4.08">chance and you know what and that is</text>
  <text start="800.889" dur="3.871">what we have to fix I think is that</text>
  <text start="802.81" dur="3.719">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re slowly like you said</text>
  <text start="804.76" dur="4.11">where the the frog in boiling water</text>
  <text start="806.529" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re turning up the heat and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="808.87" dur="3.99">slowly trying to basically get rid of us</text>
  <text start="811.089" dur="7.11">so they can replace us with the</text>
  <text start="812.86" dur="8.669">corporate approved you know next or fake</text>
  <text start="818.199" dur="5.101">dues or whatever it is right and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="821.529" dur="4.141">that&amp;#39;s what I think the big problems but</text>
  <text start="823.3" dur="4.589">what do you think yeah I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="825.67" dur="4.32">clearly setting the the rules against us</text>
  <text start="827.889" dur="5.731">they&amp;#39;re creating an unfair and rigged</text>
  <text start="829.99" dur="4.98">marketplace and it has to stop I mean I</text>
  <text start="833.62" dur="3.42">think the energy is there people are</text>
  <text start="834.97" dur="3.599">ready for it we just needed a way we</text>
  <text start="837.04" dur="3.39">none of us could have stood against</text>
  <text start="838.569" dur="4.231">Google and YouTube or any of these big</text>
  <text start="840.43" dur="4.08">giants alone but you know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="842.8" dur="3.69">stop all of us they certainly can&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="844.51" dur="3.78">all of us together and that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="846.49" dur="3.959">the goal now I think people see a way</text>
  <text start="848.29" dur="3.69">forward they see a path now they see</text>
  <text start="850.449" dur="3.051">something that we can actually do that</text>
  <text start="851.98" dur="4.799">that could make a difference and</text>
  <text start="853.5" dur="6.22">possibly even set a precedent or change</text>
  <text start="856.779" dur="4.951">the game and certainly we could we could</text>
  <text start="859.72" dur="5.07">bring attention to this issue and it</text>
  <text start="861.73" dur="5.969">burning is a new word for us to do just</text>
  <text start="864.79" dur="5.07">that it&amp;#39;s a new word to define and grant</text>
  <text start="867.699" dur="4.83">Wayne explain bit burning in the sense</text>
  <text start="869.86" dur="4.44">of I mean obviously it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s modern</text>
  <text start="872.529" dur="2.521">book burning is that that what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="874.3" dur="2.82">getting out there</text>
  <text start="875.05" dur="4.409">it is yeah bits are just you know</text>
  <text start="877.12" dur="4.709">digital information like a byte you know</text>
  <text start="879.459" dur="4.531">and bit burning is what&amp;#39;s happening when</text>
  <text start="881.829" dur="4.44">they instead of burning a book for</text>
  <text start="883.99" dur="3.659">example they burn our digital videos off</text>
  <text start="886.269" dur="3.421">the internet where we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="887.649" dur="4.5">spread the news so it&amp;#39;s just book</text>
  <text start="889.69" dur="3.959">burning in a new era and it&amp;#39;s clearly</text>
  <text start="892.149" dur="3.391">the same thing is what happens when</text>
  <text start="893.649" dur="3.75">totalitarians don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.54" dur="3.899">leaving or thinking or saying or writing</text>
  <text start="897.399" dur="4.081">and they want to get rid of what you</text>
  <text start="899.439" dur="3.721">think because you have wrong thing</text>
  <text start="901.48" dur="4.5">whether it make you</text>
  <text start="903.16" dur="5.28">whether it be your pro-life views or you</text>
  <text start="905.98" dur="4.529">know your backwater hick you know</text>
  <text start="908.44" dur="3.329">religion as they would see it you know</text>
  <text start="910.509" dur="3">just spreading the Word of God or</text>
  <text start="911.769" dur="3.63">anything like that they just want to</text>
  <text start="913.509" dur="3.151">burn you off the internet because they</text>
  <text start="915.399" dur="3.541">don&amp;#39;t want to have to compete with your</text>
  <text start="916.66" dur="5.969">message so if you&amp;#39;re not good enough</text>
  <text start="918.94" dur="6.18">then that&amp;#39;s their view so it basically</text>
  <text start="922.629" dur="5.13">sets the tone for what big tech wants it</text>
  <text start="925.12" dur="4.92">to be and there there are no other</text>
  <text start="927.759" dur="4.801">opinions alone yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="930.04" dur="4.77">competing for like you said they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="932.56" dur="5.73">want to compete against us in the open</text>
  <text start="934.81" dur="5.61">market and because they know in the open</text>
  <text start="938.29" dur="5.669">market we win right when everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="940.42" dur="6.3">set to even we win and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="943.959" dur="5.851">biggest you know problem I see with it</text>
  <text start="946.72" dur="5.159">is that you know it&amp;#39;s the same things</text>
  <text start="949.81" dur="3.839">that we cover here on the channel that I</text>
  <text start="951.879" dur="4.411">talked about over on just talk all the</text>
  <text start="953.649" dur="4.891">time you know is that you have people</text>
  <text start="956.29" dur="5.64">who are in positions of power who use</text>
  <text start="958.54" dur="5.099">their power in order to silence others</text>
  <text start="961.93" dur="3.719">to silence dissent to silence</text>
  <text start="963.639" dur="5.851">conversation debate you name it just</text>
  <text start="965.649" dur="6.18">that simply asking questions and we have</text>
  <text start="969.49" dur="3.899">to continue to be loud about this we</text>
  <text start="971.829" dur="4.171">have to organize we have to come</text>
  <text start="973.389" dur="5.101">together and and really show them that</text>
  <text start="976" dur="4.5">they can&amp;#39;t do this to us they can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="978.49" dur="4.38">shut us down throw us in the memory hole</text>
  <text start="980.5" dur="4.38">never to be heard again and I think</text>
  <text start="982.87" dur="5.069">that&amp;#39;s why I really am drawn to the</text>
  <text start="984.88" dur="5.009">movement that you founded and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="987.939" dur="4.71">talking about this thing for a long time</text>
  <text start="989.889" dur="6.05">and the more people get involved the</text>
  <text start="992.649" dur="5.731">more it seems that if anything</text>
  <text start="995.939" dur="6.13">regardless of what happens legally or</text>
  <text start="998.38" dur="7.019">not if we get enough people involved in</text>
  <text start="1002.069" dur="5.94">this idea of changing the system and the</text>
  <text start="1005.399" dur="5.091">way it is that&amp;#39;s how we change society</text>
  <text start="1008.009" dur="5.401">that&amp;#39;s how we get rid of these these</text>
  <text start="1010.49" dur="5.26">unaccountable unelected fascists in</text>
  <text start="1013.41" dur="4.109">Silicon Valley who are telling me and</text>
  <text start="1015.75" dur="4.41">you know what to say what we can do and</text>
  <text start="1017.519" dur="5.221">then if we don&amp;#39;t tow the line they take</text>
  <text start="1020.16" dur="4.409">away your social media accounts they</text>
  <text start="1022.74" dur="4.02">take away your bank account and then</text>
  <text start="1024.569" dur="4.561">they take away your your right to you</text>
  <text start="1026.76" dur="4.71">know call an uber I mean it what point</text>
  <text start="1029.13" dur="4.169">does it stop till you&amp;#39;re just sitting in</text>
  <text start="1031.47" dur="3.479">a field in the middle of nowhere you</text>
  <text start="1033.299" dur="3.63">know with a fire like a caveman</text>
  <text start="1034.949" dur="4.05">you know stoking it going on</text>
  <text start="1036.929" dur="5.041">what happened I was I was so good yeah I</text>

  <text start="1041.97" dur="4.319">can I can visualize exactly what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1044.73" dur="2.819">saying here because that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="1046.289" dur="4.171">they would like to see us happen they</text>
  <text start="1047.549" dur="4.681">want us criminalize for thinking but</text>
  <text start="1050.46" dur="3.63">they can&amp;#39;t so they have to do everything</text>
  <text start="1052.23" dur="3.75">that they can to punish us and you know</text>
  <text start="1054.09" dur="3.929">what I don&amp;#39;t want to say any names but</text>
  <text start="1055.98" dur="3.569">at that meeting that and the last one if</text>
  <text start="1058.019" dur="3.36">we totaled that up it&amp;#39;s around five</text>
  <text start="1059.549" dur="3.87">million people that we could reach so</text>
  <text start="1061.379" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re already there we&amp;#39;re already too</text>
  <text start="1063.419" dur="3.781">big to stop it&amp;#39;s just a matter now of</text>
  <text start="1065.369" dur="3.81">sort of getting the awareness up and</text>
  <text start="1067.2" dur="4.319">getting people to know kind of what bit</text>
  <text start="1069.179" dur="3.901">burning really is about and in</text>
  <text start="1071.519" dur="3.87">campaigning on that and letting people</text>
  <text start="1073.08" dur="5.13">know and then we&amp;#39;re gonna win first they</text>
  <text start="1075.389" dur="6.841">try to silence you and then they attack</text>
  <text start="1078.21" dur="6.61">you and then UN I mean and at the end of</text>
  <text start="1082.23" dur="4.6">the day you know</text>
  <text start="1084.82" dur="4.23">every time they take a little bit a</text>
  <text start="1086.83" dur="4.8">little piece away it is death by a</text>
  <text start="1089.05" dur="4.8">thousand cuts and the the sooner that</text>
  <text start="1091.63" dur="4.16">people get that the sooner people under</text>
  <text start="1093.85" dur="5.58">the sooner that people understand that</text>
  <text start="1095.79" dur="6.04">what they&amp;#39;re doing is organized and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1099.43" dur="4.83">methodical and it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s been well</text>
  <text start="1101.83" dur="4.68">planned in advance I mean the Google</text>

  <text start="1111.85" dur="7.23">has psychological research papers that</text>
  <text start="1115.06" dur="6.39">that go in-depth in understanding how if</text>
  <text start="1119.08" dur="4.41">you just keep taking away and you keep</text>
  <text start="1121.45" dur="3.51">suppressing content you keep doing it</text>
  <text start="1123.49" dur="3.66">that people will eventually fall in line</text>
  <text start="1124.96" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s like a whole outline on how</text>
  <text start="1127.15" dur="6.44">to to psychologically break down people</text>
  <text start="1130.12" dur="5.61">in order to you know exploit them and</text>

  <text start="1210.4" dur="5.49">that are kind of big media things but at</text>
  <text start="1213.55" dur="3.6">the end of the day there&amp;#39;s also two</text>
  <text start="1215.89" dur="2.58">other options there&amp;#39;s one for</text>
  <text start="1217.15" dur="3.149">influencers who</text>
  <text start="1218.47" dur="4.319">our folks like social media guys</text>

  <text start="1222.789" dur="4.111">be that are interested in and maybe</text>
  <text start="1224.74" dur="4.65">contributing or even just being part of</text>
  <text start="1226.9" dur="5.61">the conversation as you said they can</text>
  <text start="1229.39" dur="4.71">join as influencers and that&amp;#39;s a short</text>
  <text start="1232.51" dur="3.779">form they fill out and then they get</text>
  <text start="1234.1" dur="4.89">plugged into our emails and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1236.289" dur="4.38">contact them and reach out and then</text>
  <text start="1238.99" dur="3.689">there&amp;#39;s a third option as a sponsor just</text>
  <text start="1240.669" dur="4.62">someone who wants to maybe contribute to</text>
  <text start="1242.679" dur="4.61">the expenses that are you know already</text>
  <text start="1245.289" dur="4.471">in the five figures as far as legal</text>
  <text start="1247.289" dur="5.77">research that that got us to this point</text>
  <text start="1249.76" dur="4.649">and then soon hopefully if things go</text>
  <text start="1253.059" dur="5.761">well and I think they&amp;#39;re going very well</text>
