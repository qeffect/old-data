  <text start="2148.29" dur="5.79">most important thing and what is that</text>
  <text start="2150.38" dur="6.43">well obviously it&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s grace why is</text>
  <text start="2154.08" dur="3.9">God&amp;#39;s grace greater well it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="2156.81" dur="6.6">all the things we go through on a</text>
  <text start="2157.98" dur="10.62">regular basis can distort our ability to</text>
  <text start="2163.41" dur="6.75">know God&amp;#39;s love and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="2168.6" dur="4.71">strong and it doesn&amp;#39;t affect them that</text>
  <text start="2170.16" dur="7.59">way but a lot of people are not weak but</text>
  <text start="2173.31" dur="5.97">they just they take so much flak and</text>
  <text start="2177.75" dur="2.7">they feel like they&amp;#39;re getting so much</text>
  <text start="2179.28" dur="4.29">poured on them and they feel like</text>
  <text start="2180.45" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re getting so overwhelmed that it</text>
  <text start="2183.57" dur="4.62">becomes difficult for them to manage how</text>
  <text start="2186.12" dur="3.6">to follow all these things and my best</text>
  <text start="2188.19" dur="4.5">advice to everyone out there who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2189.72" dur="6.18">having trouble with its cue this person</text>
  <text start="2192.69" dur="5.16">or is cue fake or is cue real or is this</text>
  <text start="2195.9" dur="4.05">person telling the truth or is that</text>
  <text start="2197.85" dur="4.95">person telling the truth don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="2199.95" dur="4.47">about all that first all first of all</text>
  <text start="2202.8" dur="3.66">you have your critical thinking ability</text>
  <text start="2204.42" dur="3.63">and just use your own critical thought</text>
  <text start="2206.46" dur="3.75">if you think somebody sounds right then</text>
  <text start="2208.05" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re probably right if you think</text>
  <text start="2210.21" dur="4.7">they&amp;#39;re wrong they&amp;#39;re probably wrong and</text>
  <text start="2211.74" dur="5.37">do the research to find out whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2214.91" dur="4.54">that they&amp;#39;re right or that they&amp;#39;re wrong</text>
  <text start="2217.11" dur="5.37">and that&amp;#39;s as simple as that goes but</text>
  <text start="2219.45" dur="5.52">then the more important thing which is</text>
  <text start="2222.48" dur="4.95">the second thing is that you have to</text>
  <text start="2224.97" dur="3.87">reach out to God and you have to call to</text>
  <text start="2227.43" dur="2.91">God and you have to pray to God and you</text>
  <text start="2228.84" dur="3.36">have to open your heart to God and you</text>
  <text start="2230.34" dur="5.27">have to just throw yourself on the</text>
  <text start="2232.2" dur="6.21">ground I mean that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve done and</text>
  <text start="2235.61" dur="6.31">it works you know you just you toss</text>
  <text start="2238.41" dur="7.13">yourself to God&amp;#39;s mercy and you let him</text>
  <text start="2241.92" dur="6.78">take over your life because what I mean</text>
  <text start="2245.54" dur="6.1">we can only do so much as individuals</text>
  <text start="2248.7" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re basically powerless and and</text>
  <text start="2251.64" dur="5.16">somebody who I really who&amp;#39;s really close</text>
  <text start="2254.67" dur="4.08">to me who I really respect told me that</text>
  <text start="2256.8" dur="4.32">and it makes so much sense we throw</text>
  <text start="2258.75" dur="3.99">ourselves to the mercy of God because by</text>
  <text start="2261.12" dur="4.29">ourselves we can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="2262.74" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re powerless without God&amp;#39;s grace and</text>
  <text start="2265.41" dur="4.56">without God&amp;#39;s wisdom and strength and</text>
  <text start="2267.93" dur="4.2">courage and all of those things that we</text>
  <text start="2269.97" dur="3.99">get from God through prayer and through</text>
  <text start="2272.13" dur="3.95">opening our heart and through devotion</text>
  <text start="2273.96" dur="4.41">and through abiding in God</text>
  <text start="2276.08" dur="6.34">we&amp;#39;re powerless without those things</text>
  <text start="2278.37" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re an army of one</text>
  <text start="2282.42" dur="3.9">against an army of a million and then</text>
  <text start="2284.43" dur="3.48">when you have God on your side it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2286.32" dur="6.33">you&amp;#39;re an army of million against an</text>
  <text start="2287.91" dur="7.1">army of one if that makes sense so just</text>
  <text start="2292.65" dur="5.58">I want everyone out there to remember</text>
  <text start="2295.01" dur="4.45">that when God gives you an obstacle when</text>
  <text start="2298.23" dur="6.15">he gives you a struggle when he gives</text>
  <text start="2299.46" dur="6.96">you a obstacle to overcome when he gives</text>
  <text start="2304.38" dur="4.82">you a hardship I mean a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2306.42" dur="6.81">will say to me and I get this a lot it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2309.2" dur="7">Craig God doesn&amp;#39;t give us obstacles the</text>
  <text start="2313.23" dur="5.28">devil does that and my response to that</text>
  <text start="2316.2" dur="3.78">is yes the devil does put obstacles in</text>
  <text start="2318.51" dur="3.81">our way the devil does give us try</text>
  <text start="2319.98" dur="4.17">trials and tribulations and yes the</text>
  <text start="2322.32" dur="3.63">devil is responsible for a lot of evil</text>
  <text start="2324.15" dur="4.38">things that end up hitting us and making</text>
  <text start="2325.95" dur="5.58">us have to readjust and evolve and adapt</text>
  <text start="2328.53" dur="6.18">and strengthen our faith and everything</text>
  <text start="2331.53" dur="5.1">else but I would argue that God also</text>
  <text start="2334.71" dur="5.61">gives us hardships and he gives us these</text>
  <text start="2336.63" dur="6.03">obstacles because there is a purpose to</text>
  <text start="2340.32" dur="4.47">what he has in store for each and every</text>
  <text start="2342.66" dur="3.48">one of us when we go through these</text>
  <text start="2344.79" dur="2.88">obstacles when we go through these</text>
  <text start="2346.14" dur="3.6">hardships when we go through this pain</text>
  <text start="2347.67" dur="7.02">and it seems like it&amp;#39;s never gonna end</text>
  <text start="2349.74" dur="8.52">or it seems like it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2354.69" dur="6.66">overcome the obstacle or we can&amp;#39;t defeat</text>
  <text start="2358.26" dur="5.58">whatever evil is in front of us that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2361.35" dur="6.56">when it is most important to remember</text>
  <text start="2363.84" dur="7.35">that God is gonna be that that</text>
  <text start="2367.91" dur="5.74">mitigating factor it&amp;#39;s gonna be the the</text>
  <text start="2371.19" dur="5.16">ace in the hole that we all have to know</text>
  <text start="2373.65" dur="5.37">that with his strength with his guidance</text>
  <text start="2376.35" dur="4.5">with his courage with his wisdom that</text>
  <text start="2379.02" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re able to overcome it and then meet</text>
  <text start="2380.85" dur="2.91">we&amp;#39;re gonna learn something from it</text>
  <text start="2382.2" dur="3.9">maybe that&amp;#39;s why it was a part of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2383.76" dur="4.47">plan in the first place right so maybe</text>
  <text start="2386.1" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s why God would give you some sort</text>
  <text start="2388.23" dur="4.43">of hardship maybe it&amp;#39;s not to hurt you</text>
  <text start="2390.39" dur="5.52">people think of God in this way that</text>
  <text start="2392.66" dur="7.24">it&amp;#39;s all a it&amp;#39;s all gonna be you know</text>
  <text start="2395.91" dur="7.29">roses and-and-and and fruit gardens or</text>
  <text start="2399.9" dur="4.92">whatever but and it can be that for the</text>
  <text start="2403.2" dur="3.33">most part that there&amp;#39;s nothing to say</text>
  <text start="2404.82" dur="4.05">that your life can&amp;#39;t be great because</text>
  <text start="2406.53" dur="5.82">you love God you&amp;#39;re a person of faith</text>
  <text start="2408.87" dur="5.7">and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re motivated by God every</text>
  <text start="2412.35" dur="4.14">day and he&amp;#39;s blessed you and you you</text>
  <text start="2414.57" dur="3.84">accept his blessings and it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="2416.49" dur="3.99">wonderful thing but there&amp;#39;s always gonna</text>
  <text start="2418.41" dur="4.85">be little things even here and there</text>
  <text start="2420.48" dur="5.4">that are gonna make you go man</text>
  <text start="2423.26" dur="4.54">it feels so hard while I&amp;#39;m going through</text>
  <text start="2425.88" dur="4.23">it right now and then you look back</text>
  <text start="2427.8" dur="4.86">maybe a week or two weeks or a month or</text>
  <text start="2430.11" dur="5.01">a year and you look back and go wow if I</text>
  <text start="2432.66" dur="5.43">had miss if I hadn&amp;#39;t gone through that</text>
  <text start="2435.12" dur="5.91">if I hadn&amp;#39;t experienced that hardship if</text>
  <text start="2438.09" dur="5.94">I hadn&amp;#39;t gone through that tribulation</text>
  <text start="2441.03" dur="4.77">or that obstacle I would never be</text>
  <text start="2444.03" dur="4.91">prepared for these things that are that</text>
  <text start="2445.8" dur="5.25">are here at my my doorstep now and</text>
  <text start="2448.94" dur="4.54">because of those things I went through I</text>
  <text start="2451.05" dur="4.62">feel incredibly prepared to handle those</text>
  <text start="2453.48" dur="6.93">new obstacles that are in my in front of</text>
  <text start="2455.67" dur="7.08">me and to handle them successfully so</text>
  <text start="2460.41" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s my two cents on and I hope you</text>
  <text start="2462.75" dur="4.83">guys appreciate that and I want to tell</text>
  <text start="2465.63" dur="3.9">you all remember God absolutely loves</text>
  <text start="2467.58" dur="4.49">you and we&amp;#39;re gonna read a little bit</text>
  <text start="2469.53" dur="5.16">from the Bible just a small portion that</text>
  <text start="2472.07" dur="5.71">refers to what we just talked about so</text>
  <text start="2474.69" dur="8.25">we&amp;#39;re gonna read Psalm 35 verse 18</text>
  <text start="2477.78" dur="7.08">through verses 18 or 18 through 22 and I</text>
  <text start="2482.94" dur="3.93">think this really talks about you know</text>
  <text start="2484.86" dur="4.53">how the adversities come to the</text>
  <text start="2486.87" dur="5.04">righteous and it says the Lord is near</text>
  <text start="2489.39" dur="5.79">the brokenhearted he saves those crushed</text>
  <text start="2491.91" dur="5.1">in spirit many adverse adversities come</text>
  <text start="2495.18" dur="4.26">to the one who is righteous but the Lord</text>
  <text start="2497.01" dur="4.62">delivers him from them all he protects</text>
  <text start="2499.44" dur="4.2">all his bones not one of them is broken</text>
  <text start="2501.63" dur="4.17">evil brings death to the sinner and</text>
  <text start="2503.64" dur="4.83">those who hate the righteous will be</text>
  <text start="2505.8" dur="4.68">punished the Lord redeems the life of</text>
  <text start="2508.47" dur="6.3">his servants and all who take refuge in</text>
  <text start="2510.48" dur="7.86">him will not be punished so the way I</text>
  <text start="2514.77" dur="5.25">interpret that is if we worship God if</text>
  <text start="2518.34" dur="3.81">we put our faith in God we take refuge</text>
  <text start="2520.02" dur="3.06">in him the things we go through our</text>
  <text start="2522.15" dur="3.959">punished</text>
  <text start="2523.08" dur="4.83">no quite the opposite</text>
  <text start="2526.109" dur="4.531">and they&amp;#39;re not even in in some cases</text>
  <text start="2527.91" dur="4.59">sent by evil or the devil</text>
  <text start="2530.64" dur="3.78">there are hardship that God has in our</text>
  <text start="2532.5" dur="4.16">plan because it&amp;#39;s going to prepare us</text>
  <text start="2534.42" dur="5.01">for something it&amp;#39;s like going to a</text>
  <text start="2536.66" dur="4">fitness camp for a sport I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="2539.43" dur="2.52">say which sport because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2540.66" dur="3.39">what you guys are into you know whether</text>
  <text start="2541.95" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s football basketball baseball tennis</text>
  <text start="2544.05" dur="8.01">golf whatever you go to a camp to learn</text>
  <text start="2548.25" dur="6.75">how to get better in those those areas</text>
  <text start="2552.06" dur="5.69">and you work hard and you sweat and you</text>
  <text start="2555" dur="5.73">get scuffed up and you get beat up and</text>
  <text start="2557.75" dur="6.97">then you come out of that with a better</text>
  <text start="2560.73" dur="5.67">ability to do that task which you set</text>
  <text start="2564.72" dur="4.53">out to get better at in the first place</text>
  <text start="2566.4" dur="4.89">what&amp;#39;s the same thing with God even but</text>
  <text start="2569.25" dur="5.58">on a greater scale and for our souls and</text>
  <text start="2571.29" dur="5.04">our in our whole lives is that when we</text>
  <text start="2574.83" dur="3.75">get put through these things they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2576.33" dur="6.529">obviously from God they&amp;#39;re a gift</text>
  <text start="2578.58" dur="4.279">they&amp;#39;re not to be looked on as a</text>
  <text start="2582.98" dur="5.59">obstacle and in in most cases adversity</text>
  <text start="2586.8" dur="3.69">is the gift that God gives us to make us</text>
  <text start="2588.57" dur="3.57">stronger so that&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="2590.49" dur="3.42">and I hope if you don&amp;#39;t take anything</text>
  <text start="2592.14" dur="3.87">else away from it this episode you just</text>
  <text start="2593.91" dur="4.32">understand that even if you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2596.01" dur="4.47">through a hardship right now that the</text>
  <text start="2598.23" dur="3.93">Sun will come out tomorrow and it will</text>
  <text start="2600.48" dur="3">be a bright and beautiful day and I hope</text>
  <text start="2602.16" dur="2.79">that you take advantage of it to the</text>
  <text start="2603.48" dur="3.9">fullest and put your faith in God and</text>
  <text start="2604.95" dur="4.74">remember that now why does God loves you</text>
  <text start="2607.38" dur="5.28">but he believes in you and he will</text>
  <text start="2609.69" dur="6.899">protect you and that if you take refuge</text>
