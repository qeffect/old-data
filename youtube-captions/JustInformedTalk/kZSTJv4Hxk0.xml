  <text start="567.61" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re going up against stuff like this</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="3.24">Nancy Pelosi who deserves to be removed</text>

  <text start="572.11" dur="7.73">Trump McConnell or both I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="7.17">nothing here that that&amp;#39;s even remotely</text>
  <text start="579.84" dur="5.86">truthful from her side would be nothing</text>
  <text start="582.97" dur="4.59">in good faith at least saying Trump has</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="3.96">betrayed the Constitution and his oath</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="4.14">of office and Mitch McConnell defends</text>

  <text start="603.84" dur="3.16">everything&amp;#39;s happening the</text>
  <text start="605.41" dur="3.78">investigations are ongoing so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="607" dur="3.72">worried about where all this goes but I</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="3.96">am worried about stuff like this where</text>
  <text start="610.72" dur="5.1">you have in Rome you know statues of</text>
  <text start="613.15" dur="5.07">what people have said is Moloch I guess</text>
  <text start="615.82" dur="4.08">being put up and I hope this is a real</text>
  <text start="618.22" dur="3">story this might be you know I found</text>
  <text start="619.9" dur="4.77">this on another website it was hard to</text>
  <text start="621.22" dur="6.39">kind of secondly verify but assuming</text>
  <text start="624.67" dur="4.08">this is real and I put that caveat on it</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="4.34">you know take it with a grain of salt</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="4.88">this is the kind of stuff that truly</text>
  <text start="631.95" dur="3.6">disturbing especially in today&amp;#39;s society</text>
  <text start="633.63" dur="3.72">because you know if you look at what the</text>
  <text start="635.55" dur="3.59">Morlock stands for and represents then</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="4.65">you kind of understand what these people</text>
  <text start="639.14" dur="5.02">worship and they worship the owl owl is</text>
  <text start="642" dur="3.99">a predator bird it comes out at night</text>
  <text start="644.16" dur="5.28">it actually preys on other predator</text>
  <text start="645.99" dur="4.74">birds it&amp;#39;s just really bad so that and</text>
  <text start="649.44" dur="4.2">then not to mention you know the whole</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="6.84">history of you know human sacrifice to</text>
  <text start="653.64" dur="6.18">this deity so you know that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="3.48">what we always want to keep an eye on to</text>
  <text start="659.82" dur="3.15">make sure that our societies and</text>
  <text start="661.05" dur="3.84">continued to slip downwards and then</text>
  <text start="662.97" dur="4.08">here&amp;#39;s another story I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="664.89" dur="7.35">touch on briefly apparently they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.05" dur="7.11">coming forward and saying that the US</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="5.91">company sold Chinese equipment to the</text>
  <text start="674.16" dur="5.91">military and they actually changed the</text>
  <text start="678.15" dur="5.67">labels of the equipment itself to say</text>
  <text start="680.07" dur="5.22">made in the United States but this US</text>
  <text start="683.82" dur="3.3">attorney comes forth and shows that the</text>
  <text start="685.29" dur="2.58">packaging on the outside is labeled made</text>
  <text start="687.12" dur="4.2">in China</text>
  <text start="687.87" dur="5.34">so somebody either really dropped the</text>
  <text start="691.32" dur="3.51">ball there or this is just another</text>
  <text start="693.21" dur="5.97">example of what President Trump has been</text>
  <text start="694.83" dur="5.58">fighting against from day one I mean you</text>
  <text start="699.18" dur="3.54">think this is bad these are like</text>
  <text start="700.41" dur="4.26">security cameras with Chinese Communist</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="4.32">Party chips in them that are being used</text>
  <text start="704.67" dur="4.83">in top secret and classified facilities</text>
  <text start="707.04" dur="5.31">yeah that&amp;#39;s bad well what&amp;#39;s even worse</text>
  <text start="709.5" dur="6.3">is when you&amp;#39;re using cheap you know</text>
  <text start="712.35" dur="7.02">second-rate steel to make your war</text>
  <text start="715.8" dur="5.04">machines your choppers and jets and then</text>
  <text start="719.37" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re just dropping out of the sky I</text>
  <text start="720.84" dur="5.64">mean and and also with the chips and</text>
  <text start="723.84" dur="4.17">technology that was used there so you</text>
  <text start="726.48" dur="3.84">know President who&amp;#39;s been trying to get</text>
  <text start="728.01" dur="4.17">rid of this and trying to help people to</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="3.24">understand this is a true threat so I</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="3.87">think it was worth highlighting here</text>
  <text start="733.56" dur="3.84">quickly now there&amp;#39;s another one from</text>
  <text start="736.05" dur="2.61">more than three days three nights&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="737.4" dur="2.88">we&amp;#39;re just kind of going through these</text>
  <text start="738.66" dur="3.6">news stories and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into</text>
  <text start="740.28" dur="5.07">the big one I thought this was great</text>
  <text start="742.26" dur="4.83">because this lays out how the whole</text>
  <text start="745.35" dur="3.42">thing for the Trump foundation right</text>
  <text start="747.09" dur="3.51">president Trump&amp;#39;s been really</text>
  <text start="748.77" dur="4.65">transparent with the Trump foundation</text>
  <text start="750.6" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s been a very forthright and honest</text>
  <text start="753.42" dur="3.06">and saying that look this charity</text>
  <text start="755.4" dur="2.58">doesn&amp;#39;t make any money we give</text>
  <text start="756.48" dur="3.29">everything away we give him more than a</text>
  <text start="757.98" dur="4.86">hundred percent of what we make away and</text>
  <text start="759.77" dur="3.94">we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t use our charity in an</text>
  <text start="762.84" dur="2.68">illegal manner</text>
  <text start="763.71" dur="3.16">well back in 2012</text>
  <text start="765.52" dur="2.4">kind of giving us a timeline I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="766.87" dur="3.57">read this this is how the Trump</text>
  <text start="767.92" dur="4.59">Foundation paid out 104 percent of funds</text>
  <text start="770.44" dur="3.93">because they knew the New York Attorney</text>
  <text start="772.51" dur="4.32">General would investigate it and the</text>
  <text start="774.37" dur="5.46">Trump DOJ in the SDN NY Southern</text>
  <text start="776.83" dur="5.1">District New York Court needed positive</text>
  <text start="779.83" dur="4.8">optics to investigate the evil Clinton</text>
  <text start="781.93" dur="4.65">Foundation so I don&amp;#39;t know that you know</text>
  <text start="784.63" dur="3.39">going back 2012 it&amp;#39;s a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="786.58" dur="2.58">stretch but I guess you could understand</text>
  <text start="788.02" dur="3.27">the Trump&amp;#39;s been running a clean</text>
  <text start="789.16" dur="4.02">organization since then right he makes</text>
  <text start="791.29" dur="4.5">sure his foundation gives 104 percent of</text>
  <text start="793.18" dur="3.9">his funds away and then in 2017 you have</text>
  <text start="795.79" dur="2.85">the dams falling for the trap and</text>
  <text start="797.08" dur="4.35">investigating the Trump foundation right</text>
  <text start="798.64" dur="4.29">so this is baiting the man to do it then</text>
  <text start="801.43" dur="3.27">it says the Dems didn&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="802.93" dur="3.81">Trump cleaned up the Southern District</text>
  <text start="804.7" dur="3.63">of New York FBI and the DOJ so they</text>
  <text start="806.74" dur="3.78">didn&amp;#39;t have a corrupt case against him</text>
  <text start="808.33" dur="3.99">then the New York Attorney General uses</text>
  <text start="810.52" dur="3.72">a legal investigation and gets caught up</text>
  <text start="812.32" dur="5.04">and sting up which I believe that was</text>
  <text start="814.24" dur="8.31">the one before who left his name was</text>
  <text start="817.36" dur="6.75">Schneiderman I think and then you have</text>
  <text start="822.55" dur="3.3">WikiLeaks coming out with new evidence</text>
  <text start="824.11" dur="4.5">about the Clinton Foundation that</text>
  <text start="825.85" dur="4.86">happened in 2019 and I guess then it</text>
  <text start="828.61" dur="5.79">talks about the Dems investigated Trump</text>
  <text start="830.71" dur="5.88">so Clinton is now 100% fair game that</text>
  <text start="834.4" dur="5.01">seems like an interesting theory if you</text>
  <text start="836.59" dur="5.46">just throw them out there to say paving</text>
  <text start="839.41" dur="4.64">the way for what&amp;#39;s to come now of course</text>
  <text start="842.05" dur="4.92">here&amp;#39;s another story Eric Holder is</text>
  <text start="844.05" dur="6.51">considering a jump into the 2020</text>
  <text start="846.97" dur="6.03">presidential primary well I wonder why</text>
  <text start="850.56" dur="5.47">you know think about it these people</text>
  <text start="853" dur="5.58">cues told us in the past the people who</text>
  <text start="856.03" dur="4.41">are basically going to be implicated in</text>
  <text start="858.58" dur="3.72">a lot of these investigations that are</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="3">ongoing right now and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="862.3" dur="4.46">be coming out with the declassification</text>
  <text start="863.44" dur="5.76">FISA as those reports are made public</text>
  <text start="866.76" dur="4.54">you&amp;#39;re gonna see people like Eric Holder</text>
  <text start="869.2" dur="4.98">and others jumping into politics all of</text>
  <text start="871.3" dur="5.01">a sudden why because then it can be</text>
  <text start="874.18" dur="3.66">portrayed as oh look president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.31" dur="3.9">just attacking his political enemies</text>
  <text start="877.84" dur="6.21">just like they did curiously enough it</text>
  <text start="880.21" dur="6.69">seems with the Biden thing in in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ve tried to spin that from day one</text>
  <text start="886.9" dur="5.1">that President Trump is is is illegally</text>
  <text start="889.99" dur="3.18">doing this quid pro quo to investigate</text>
  <text start="892" dur="4.77">his political enemies because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.17" dur="5.61">scared of Joe Biden but I mean look Joe</text>
  <text start="896.77" dur="2.52">Biden there&amp;#39;s no possible way he would</text>
  <text start="898.78" dur="2.94">stay in</text>
  <text start="899.29" dur="4.2">general election given what we know</text>
  <text start="901.72" dur="3.66">about him and his and it would just be</text>
  <text start="903.49" dur="5.55">such an easy race that there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="905.38" dur="5.1">president Trump&amp;#39;s worried about that but</text>
  <text start="909.04" dur="3.96">this is what&amp;#39;s gonna happen more and</text>
  <text start="910.48" dur="4.109">more obviously the more people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="913" dur="3.089">brought to light the more people are</text>
  <text start="914.589" dur="5.341">gonna be jumping into politics all of a</text>
  <text start="916.089" dur="7.74">sudden you know go figure Peter struck</text>
  <text start="919.93" dur="5.76">obviously this is the craziest story of</text>
  <text start="923.829" dur="2.82">all so what they&amp;#39;re figuring out what</text>
  <text start="925.69" dur="3.99">these 302s</text>
  <text start="926.649" dur="5.161">is that basically he was excused from</text>
  <text start="929.68" dur="3.719">the investigation for his bias right</text>
  <text start="931.81" dur="3.449">because I guess they found out his text</text>
  <text start="933.399" dur="3.721">messages or found out that other people</text>
  <text start="935.259" dur="5.491">found out his text messages whatever and</text>
  <text start="937.12" dur="5.79">his actions with others including Lisa</text>
  <text start="940.75" dur="4.709">page and decided to ask him to step away</text>
  <text start="942.91" dur="4.56">from this investigation and of course</text>
  <text start="945.459" dur="4.231">he&amp;#39;s the one now that we figure out her</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="3.63">is actually writing these 302s that we</text>
  <text start="949.69" dur="3.6">thought were originally attributed to</text>
  <text start="951.1" dur="4.109">another agent and now the time lines are</text>
  <text start="953.29" dur="4.38">starting to look like on the last day</text>
  <text start="955.209" dur="4.021">the date actually that he was excused</text>
  <text start="957.67" dur="5.659">from this mall investigation for his</text>
  <text start="959.23" dur="7.799">bias right he&amp;#39;s writing the 302 on Flynn</text>
  <text start="963.329" dur="6.221">right so this in and of itself is a</text>
  <text start="967.029" dur="4.321">complete sham against Flynn obviously</text>
  <text start="969.55" dur="3.899">Sidney Paula&amp;#39;s attorney is doing great</text>
  <text start="971.35" dur="4.349">job uncovering exposing all of this</text>
  <text start="973.449" dur="4.26">follow their work if you want to get</text>
  <text start="975.699" dur="3.811">more in depth about that story you can</text>
  <text start="977.709" dur="4.62">go look at places like the American</text>
  <text start="979.51" dur="4.379">report org Mary Fanning Island Jones</text>
  <text start="982.329" dur="3.75">doing a great job exposing all that with</text>
  <text start="983.889" dur="4.531">the hammer Brennan and the set up of</text>
  <text start="986.079" dur="5.07">Flynn and yeah you should probably go</text>
  <text start="988.42" dur="4.229">read that if you haven&amp;#39;t already and of</text>
  <text start="991.149" dur="3.451">course it&amp;#39;s saying how did the alleged</text>
  <text start="992.649" dur="3.93">Ukraine whistleblower end up in the mall</text>
  <text start="994.6" dur="3.479">report well he was actually cited in the</text>
  <text start="996.579" dur="4.38">Mullen report and this article goes on</text>
  <text start="998.079" dur="4.351">to explain that the actual whistleblower</text>
  <text start="1000.959" dur="5.221">who was cited in the world report we</text>
  <text start="1002.43" dur="4.349">know him as Eric CIA ramela or char</text>
  <text start="1006.18" dur="4.62">ramela</text>
  <text start="1006.779" dur="6.331">this guy who is now this big controversy</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="4.32">o&amp;#39;donald junior named him in an article</text>
  <text start="1013.11" dur="3.27">and no we don&amp;#39;t want to name him even</text>
  <text start="1015.12" dur="3.659">though everybody knows his name it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1016.38" dur="4.559">just a big joke right</text>
  <text start="1018.779" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re talking about the fact that he</text>
  <text start="1020.939" dur="3.091">was cited in the mall and report and</text>
  <text start="1022.529" dur="2.88">then they cited in the mall report this</text>
  <text start="1024.03" dur="4.049">New York Times article which was</text>
  <text start="1025.409" dur="5.52">basically citing the information that he</text>
  <text start="1028.079" dur="4.171">verified so think of it this way usually</text>
  <text start="1030.929" dur="2.88">you have to like independently verify</text>
  <text start="1032.25" dur="3.329">things so you take like</text>
  <text start="1033.809" dur="4.29">the account of the person who is working</text>
  <text start="1035.579" dur="4.41">in this case this charmelo guy then you</text>
  <text start="1038.099" dur="3.69">take an independent report from an</text>
  <text start="1039.989" dur="3.09">anonymous source that man in the New</text>
  <text start="1041.789" dur="3.54">York Times right and say oh well these</text>
  <text start="1043.079" dur="4.62">match up so obviously there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1045.329" dur="3.871">there well what they&amp;#39;re not accounting</text>
  <text start="1047.699" dur="4.92">for is the fact that charmella is the</text>
  <text start="1049.2" dur="4.919">one who allegedly may have leaked it to</text>
  <text start="1052.619" dur="3.24">the New York Times and then he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1054.119" dur="4.62">basically just verifying his own story</text>
  <text start="1055.859" dur="4.89">that he leaked and this is a part of the</text>
  <text start="1058.739" dur="3.66">way they were sabotaging or subterfuge</text>
  <text start="1060.749" dur="3.15">inside of president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1062.399" dur="4.01">administration they left these people</text>
  <text start="1063.899" dur="5.46">behind and snuck them in there because</text>
  <text start="1066.409" dur="4.541">this was all part of a plan and you</text>
  <text start="1069.359" dur="3.091">could even say it&amp;#39;s possible that trumps</text>
  <text start="1070.95" dur="3.99">playing for president Trump&amp;#39;s playing</text>
  <text start="1072.45" dur="3.959">for DHS in that he&amp;#39;s allowed these</text>
  <text start="1074.94" dur="3.449">people to remain so that they could</text>
  <text start="1076.409" dur="5.34">entrap the Arab down trap them I should</text>
  <text start="1078.389" dur="5.16">say but in to ensnare them in their own</text>
  <text start="1081.749" dur="5.461">scheme to overthrow President Trump</text>
  <text start="1083.549" dur="5.19">right possibly so this is a good reason</text>
  <text start="1087.21" dur="3.599">I&amp;#39;ll leave a link to everything in the</text>
  <text start="1088.739" dur="3.51">description you should go read it again</text>
  <text start="1090.809" dur="3.45">we need to remind ourselves about the</text>
  <text start="1092.249" dur="5.22">u.s. laws here but there is a code</text>
  <text start="1094.259" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s a statute in the US code two</text>

  <text start="1157.619" dur="2.85">Anton&amp;#39;s point out something very</text>
  <text start="1158.849" dur="3.3">interesting about this letter from</text>

  <text start="1169.679" dur="4.23">interesting so first of all what are the</text>
  <text start="1172.169" dur="4.23">interns picked up right off the bat here</text>
  <text start="1173.909" dur="3.84">by the third paragraph of this basically</text>
  <text start="1176.399" dur="3.39">what this dis letter says I&amp;#39;ll say in</text>
  <text start="1177.749" dur="3.66">summary it says that everything</text>
  <text start="1179.789" dur="4.23">president Trump&amp;#39;s doing is undermining</text>
  <text start="1181.409" dur="4.23">the whistleblower Act and it&amp;#39;s putting</text>

  <text start="1188.73" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s basically the gist of this right</text>
  <text start="1190.919" dur="4.35">and then but what&amp;#39;s interesting is in</text>
  <text start="1192.72" dur="5.49">the third paragraph this lawyer cites</text>
  <text start="1195.269" dur="6.36">John F Kennedy Abraham Lincoln and</text>
  <text start="1198.21" dur="4.469">Ronald Reagan and these are what three</text>

  <text start="1206.94" dur="6.479">attempt against their life Ronald Reagan</text>
  <text start="1209.97" dur="4.829">survived I just when they Anton point</text>
  <text start="1213.419" dur="3.39">that I was like wow that&amp;#39;s interesting I</text>
  <text start="1214.799" dur="2.911">mean the quote I mean obviously people</text>
  <text start="1216.809" dur="2.641">would say these are three great</text>
  <text start="1217.71" dur="2.549">presidents and I could agree with that I</text>
  <text start="1219.45" dur="3.15">just thought it was an interesting</text>
  <text start="1220.259" dur="5.071">coincidence there&amp;#39;s three presidents who</text>
  <text start="1222.6" dur="4.86">happen to have all had assassination</text>
  <text start="1225.33" dur="5.13">attempts against them and not only is it</text>
  <text start="1227.46" dur="4.98">is it referencing them directly but then</text>
  <text start="1230.46" dur="5.01">you kind of read in this and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1232.44" dur="5.67">calling President Trump you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1235.47" dur="4.89">basically it sounds like an ex Corey</text>
  <text start="1238.11" dur="4.71">ation from some intelligence community</text>
  <text start="1240.36" dur="4.439">officer and when you actually look up</text>
  <text start="1242.82" dur="3.51">who Bokashi is then you go while that</text>
  <text start="1244.799" dur="3.95">makes sense because he is a former</text>
  <text start="1246.33" dur="6.589">intelligence officer who worked in the</text>
  <text start="1248.749" dur="8.41">CIA for the inspector general there so I</text>
  <text start="1252.919" dur="5.89">mean look deep state gets as deep state</text>
  <text start="1257.159" dur="3.09">as it gets and they can you know talk</text>
  <text start="1258.809" dur="2.911">their rhetoric but then you look at one</text>
  <text start="1260.249" dur="3.39">of the other lawyers for this</text>
  <text start="1261.72" dur="4.409">whistleblower this Marc Syed guy and</text>

  <text start="1271.2" dur="4.74">that have been brought up online I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1273.299" dur="4.11">gonna say anything about character try</text>
  <text start="1275.94" dur="4.349">to impugn it because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1277.409" dur="4.89">anything and I always leave room for</text>
  <text start="1280.289" dur="2.821">reasonable doubt here but let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1282.299" dur="2.941">look at the facts</text>
  <text start="1283.11" dur="7.86">Marc dice points out on Twitter if you</text>
  <text start="1285.24" dur="7.679">go to Marc Syed Esquires YouTube page</text>
  <text start="1290.97" dur="4.23">which according to Marc dice was</text>
  <text start="1292.919" dur="5.37">originally linked to his actual website</text>
  <text start="1295.2" dur="4.859">until it was taken down and just to let</text>
  <text start="1298.289" dur="3.99">you know I did verify this independently</text>
  <text start="1300.059" dur="5.61">by visiting the site and I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1302.279" dur="5.94">this is his actual YouTube page or not</text>
  <text start="1305.669" dur="5.75">but I can tell you it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="1308.219" dur="6.27">that it links to all his stuff and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1311.419" dur="5.47">his name and when you look at the liked</text>
  <text start="1314.489" dur="4.471">videos they&amp;#39;re weird not saying anything</text>
  <text start="1316.889" dur="3.78">you know it&amp;#39;s just who is liking these</text>
  <text start="1318.96" dur="3.449">kind of videos because when I first saw</text>
  <text start="1320.669" dur="3.21">this I go oh man you know this guy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1322.409" dur="3.63">probably got kids and the kids were on</text>
  <text start="1323.879" dur="3.54">his YouTube account and they probably</text>
  <text start="1326.039" dur="3.81">wouldn&amp;#39;t like these videos because</text>
  <text start="1327.419" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re big fans of whoever and I was</text>
  <text start="1329.849" dur="2.94">like so no big deal I just kind of</text>
  <text start="1331.349" dur="2.88">looked by it and then I saw reports</text>
  <text start="1332.789" dur="3.63">coming out that says this guy mark say</text>
  <text start="1334.229" dur="3.51">hey that doesn&amp;#39;t have any children so I</text>
  <text start="1336.419" dur="3">was like oh that&amp;#39;s kind of weird that</text>

  <text start="1339.419" dur="3.21">YouTube channel and it would make sense</text>

  <text start="1450.029" dur="6.061">destinations for this Disney Cruise Line</text>
  <text start="1452" dur="6.34">so apparently this and I looked all this</text>
  <text start="1456.09" dur="4.53">up too when it came out but if you go to</text>
  <text start="1458.34" dur="3.689">the Disney website where this was you</text>
  <text start="1460.62" dur="3.51">could find it and it I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1462.029" dur="3.811">they&amp;#39;ve changed it now but there is an</text>

  <text start="1473.7" dur="3.9">bunker now when you guys actually look</text>
  <text start="1476.52" dur="2.94">at the video that was done by luke</text>
  <text start="1477.6" dur="3.449">rudkowski where he goes on the island</text>
  <text start="1479.46" dur="3.54">and opens up the doors and looks inside</text>
  <text start="1481.049" dur="4.191">there you can actually see that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1509.64" dur="4.8">story for another day I thought that was</text>
  <text start="1512.61" dur="4.23">very fascinating now the connection</text>
  <text start="1514.44" dur="4.68">between Epstein and Disney also goes to</text>
