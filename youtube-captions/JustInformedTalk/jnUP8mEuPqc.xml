  <text start="32.13" dur="3.9">progression of diplomats and</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="4.141">intelligence officers and White House</text>
  <text start="36.03" dur="3.48">people trooping up to Capitol Hill right</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="2.67">now and saying these are people who are</text>

  <text start="51.179" dur="5.34">as far as the allegations of you know</text>
  <text start="54.12" dur="4.079">CIA hacking to sack computers nothing</text>
  <text start="56.519" dur="3.47">could be further the truth and we</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="4.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t do that I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="59.989" dur="7.27">that&amp;#39;s just beyond the the you know the</text>
  <text start="63.149" dur="6.33">scope of potentially illegal and</text>
  <text start="67.259" dur="4.53">unconstitutional breaches by the CIA</text>
  <text start="69.479" dur="5.011">well they&amp;#39;re appropriate authorities</text>
  <text start="71.789" dur="6.661">right now both inside of CIA as well as</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="6.54">outside of CIA are looking at what CI</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="5.369">officers and as well as sissie a staff</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="4.44">members did and I defer to them to</text>
  <text start="83.819" dur="4.41">determine whether or not there was any</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="4.38">violation of law or principle you know</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="3.541">when the facts come out on this I think</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="4.17">a lot of people who are claiming that</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="3.84">there has been this tremendous sort of</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="9.33">spying and monitoring and hacking will</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="9.39">be proved wrong was they going to be</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="4.14">interviewed by mr. doar</text>
  <text start="105" dur="4.89">as part of this non investigation I</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="3.689">member William bar you know when he was</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="3.539">testify in front of Congress he said he</text>
  <text start="111.179" dur="4.11">he didn&amp;#39;t understand the predication of</text>
  <text start="113.429" dur="3.09">the counterintelligence investigation</text>
  <text start="115.289" dur="3.72">that was launched into Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.519" dur="4.621">interference in 2016 election I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="4.801">understand the predication of this</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="5.31">worldwide effort to try to uncover Derk</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="5.91">either real or imagined either real or</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="5.31">imagined either real or imagined that</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="4.83">would discredit that investigation in</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="4.89">2016 and into Russian interference you</text>
  <text start="134.55" dur="4.89">know on one hand the Obama stration is</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="4.199">crucified for not doing enough and now</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re looking for what we might have</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="4.11">done in order to try to understand</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="4.26">better and to prevent the Russian</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="3.841">interference and I do agree it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="3.3">just that Trump doesn&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="148.8" dur="3.75">Russian interference I think he is</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.86">hoping that he&amp;#39;s going to get it because</text>
  <text start="152.55" dur="5.13">I knows that Russia interfered on his</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="4.5">behalf and I think as he sees his</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="4.05">political fortunes dwindling I think he</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="3.569">really is hoping that his pal Vladimir</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="3.81">is going to come through once again and</text>
  <text start="163.379" dur="3.36">help him get elected in 2020 if he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="174.88" dur="5.25">getting more evidence that&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="177.46" dur="6.03">showing that the whistleblower the real</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="6.24">whistleblower Dennis Montgomery may have</text>
  <text start="183.49" dur="4.77">been right all along about the abuse of</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="4.95">the super surveillance system known as</text>
  <text start="188.26" dur="4.02">the hammer did the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="191.32" dur="3.15">weaponize it</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="4.86">to go after their political adversaries</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="5.04">including President Trump we&amp;#39;re taking a</text>

  <text start="271.889" dur="4.321">the Espionage Act President Obama</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="5.82">himself is guilty of it because he</text>

  <text start="305.97" dur="8.25">for the CIA and they a mask it as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="311.85" dur="3.99">sure you&amp;#39;ll remember this the contracts</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="5.34">with the CIA which I had plenty of</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="6.51">copies said that they were decoding al</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="5.88">Jazeera television said that there was</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="6.18">broadcast embedded remember that that</text>
  <text start="325.44" dur="6.9">was a front by the CIA and this guy</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="6.24">worked for Brennan and clapper those are</text>
  <text start="332.34" dur="5.1">the two guys running he started out in</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="3.59">2004 with another partner and Reno</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="3.9">Nevada</text>

  <text start="343.91" dur="5.41">top security clearance all kinds of</text>
  <text start="347.16" dur="4.71">letters emails but it really turns out</text>
  <text start="349.32" dur="6.21">they were doing is they were hacking</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="6.479">into all of America he says you know you</text>
  <text start="355.53" dur="5.31">guys are right I did hack into all your</text>
  <text start="358.349" dur="5.461">stuff I gave it to your ex-wives and all</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="5.88">the lawyers and he said there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="6.84">more he said what I really did as a</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="6.39">government subcontractor was I hacked</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="7.019">into all of America for Brennan and</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="7.17">clapper day I said wow it&amp;#39;s pretty heavy</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="4.861">stuff can you prove it I said to him</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="4.23">when the Snowden thing came down he</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="3.389">starts laughing then he goes huh Snowden</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="3.96">is a punk he doesn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="385.919" dur="5.781">information like I got so he starts</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="6.779">showing me what he has he&amp;#39;s got nine</text>
  <text start="391.7" dur="5.979">hundred million phone calls</text>
  <text start="395.249" dur="6.24">quarter I mean you you call me along</text>
  <text start="397.679" dur="5.76">with date with time of day okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.489" dur="3.87">one thing he did it for the government</text>
  <text start="403.439" dur="3">this is on a government computer paid</text>
  <text start="405.359" dur="3.3">for by the government</text>
  <text start="406.439" dur="4.83">CIA at Fort Washington Maryland which is</text>
  <text start="408.659" dur="7.65">105 three overview Road in Fort</text>
  <text start="411.269" dur="7.77">Washington Maryland then he&amp;#39;s got bank</text>
  <text start="416.309" dur="5.04">accounts with the passwords and the</text>
  <text start="419.039" dur="5.22">usernames that the government got just</text>
  <text start="421.349" dur="4.83">randomly all over the country it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="424.259" dur="3.26">hundred and fifty three thousand in this</text>
  <text start="426.179" dur="4.05">County alone</text>
  <text start="427.519" dur="5.77">what are fifty three thousand people</text>
  <text start="430.229" dur="6.66">were hacked in by Brennan and gladly</text>
  <text start="433.289" dur="5.25">so those are the two common factors now</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="4.2">if you go back to string you spend the</text>
  <text start="438.539" dur="5.37">string back with Claude Brennan Brennan</text>
  <text start="441.089" dur="8.04">was CIA at her Bush 43 it was like</text>
  <text start="443.909" dur="7.71">executive director so they must have</text>
  <text start="449.129" dur="5.49">figured something with Skokie the</text>
  <text start="451.619" dur="5.9">firebreath brain goes to work as the CEO</text>
  <text start="454.619" dur="6.21">of analysis in Washington DC</text>
  <text start="457.519" dur="7.12">they&amp;#39;re basically ex CIA guys that do</text>
  <text start="460.829" dur="8.45">contracting for the government private</text>
  <text start="464.639" dur="4.64">private version of their old job so</text>
  <text start="469.889" dur="6.451">he goes to Obama then senator and says</text>
  <text start="473.599" dur="6.13">you should hire us in that analysis</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="5.49">group roughly President Obama does have</text>
  <text start="479.729" dur="4.111">tons of money millions dollar if you may</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="4.019">not recall this job but there was a</text>
  <text start="483.84" dur="5.789">little bit of a flap about the birth</text>
  <text start="485.849" dur="6.81">certificate back then there was then</text>
  <text start="489.629" dur="4.861">there was an accusation that someone had</text>
  <text start="492.659" dur="5.841">gotten the birth certificates though</text>
  <text start="494.49" dur="5.94">Hillary Clinton Mitt Romney and Obama</text>
  <text start="498.5" dur="4.36">there was a young man working for</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="6.959">Brennan at the CIA that came over to</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="8.13">analysis group and he was kind of the</text>
  <text start="507.389" dur="5.161">dirty computer kid I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ll tell you what I know factual and</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="5.159">what I believed to be true we believe</text>
  <text start="515.55" dur="3.65">that they got in and actually altered</text>
  <text start="517.709" dur="4.591">his birth certificate</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="5.019">Brennan did an analysis group and they</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="3">had to disguise it by doing something or</text>
  <text start="524.219" dur="4.021">looking like they did something to</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="3.89">Clinton and Romney so it wasn&amp;#39;t specific</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="3.99">Duke Obama</text>
  <text start="529.19" dur="6.37">so then what he gets</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="5.34">I mean that Obama gets elected Brennan</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="5.339">then wants to be CIA that was his</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="5.43">question life if you would call he got</text>
  <text start="540.899" dur="6.241">turned down because of the waterboarding</text>
  <text start="543" dur="5.85">so as an alternative Obama moves and</text>
  <text start="547.14" dur="5.509">Brennan three-door mm white house</text>
  <text start="548.85" dur="8.4">Turner&amp;#39;s office so then time goes by and</text>
  <text start="552.649" dur="7.991">then Brennan&amp;#39;s now see a about 3-4</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="6.57">months ago this guy showed me 900</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="5.04">million phone calls and I see myself in</text>
  <text start="563.82" dur="3.93">there I see people I know I mean I see</text>
  <text start="565.68" dur="4.589">Donald Trump in there in a zillion times</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="4.68">and let me tell you how they did it so</text>
  <text start="570.269" dur="4.88">you got Hearst and the whole story this</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="6.029">magar rate was such a brand computer guy</text>
  <text start="575.149" dur="5.861">he figured out they built and started</text>
  <text start="578.459" dur="5.401">all four they built a supercomputer</text>
  <text start="581.01" dur="4.379">and you know that long far away from CIA</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="5.52">headquarters with a burger contractor</text>
  <text start="585.389" dur="7.291">and it room so twice as big as this room</text>
  <text start="589.38" dur="5.1">fully mastered computers that figured</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="5.61">out how to break combinations of</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="6.95">passwords and so the idea was it was</text>
  <text start="598.29" dur="6.18">very well attended let&amp;#39;s go find</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="5.349">al-qaeda&amp;#39;s websites let&amp;#39;s see if we can</text>
  <text start="604.47" dur="3.59">crack the passwords in America that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.779" dur="6.81">all great</text>
  <text start="608.06" dur="7.839">so then after Snowden comes out Obama</text>
  <text start="613.589" dur="4.5">comes out him I think August 9th this</text>
  <text start="615.899" dur="4.711">year he said Snowden has been charged</text>
  <text start="618.089" dur="6.12">with three felonies if he had followed</text>
  <text start="620.61" dur="7.08">the whistleblower protocol and come to</text>
  <text start="624.209" dur="7.021">us he wouldn&amp;#39;t be in trouble so I had</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="6.509">Montgomery he filed 18 whistleblower</text>
  <text start="631.23" dur="5.01">complaints with the Inspector General of</text>
  <text start="634.199" dur="6.33">the Air Force Specter in general the CIA</text>
  <text start="636.24" dur="5.7">inspected gentle United States Holder so</text>
  <text start="640.529" dur="6.091">he&amp;#39;s got rejected</text>
  <text start="641.94" dur="6.509">18 times he&amp;#39;s pleased I&amp;#39;m gonna have all</text>
  <text start="646.62" dur="4.469">of us award complaints and rejections</text>
  <text start="648.449" dur="4.021">here so he did the right thing he said</text>
  <text start="651.089" dur="5.221">hey I&amp;#39;m an American I&amp;#39;m not leaving the</text>
  <text start="652.47" dur="6.479">country I worked the CIA I&amp;#39;m gonna fully</text>
  <text start="656.31" dur="4.019">government authorized and I got all this</text>
  <text start="658.949" dur="3.811">financial information this is a</text>
  <text start="660.329" dur="4.281">violation of Fourth Amendment and this</text>
  <text start="662.76" dur="8.009">needs to be told</text>
  <text start="664.61" dur="8.74">they rejected Hillary Clinton was</text>
  <text start="670.769" dur="6.271">operating a server people call it a</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="6.81">rogue server that she had over 2,000</text>

  <text start="683.73" dur="9.15">it that server did not have an ATO which</text>
  <text start="689.339" dur="6.271">we it means authority to operate in</text>
  <text start="692.88" dur="4.649">other words it was a rogue server the</text>
