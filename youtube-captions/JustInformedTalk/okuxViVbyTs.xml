  <text start="366.129" dur="4.62">known about since who knows you know</text>
  <text start="369.219" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s gone back quite a ways one of the</text>
  <text start="370.749" dur="4.98">more recent examples of where we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="5.28">shown evidence of this is James O&amp;#39;Keefe</text>
  <text start="375.729" dur="4.11">in Project Veritas and they&amp;#39;re exposing</text>
  <text start="377.949" dur="5.58">of Planned Parenthood officials who are</text>
  <text start="379.839" dur="6.93">invade engaged in basically discussing</text>
  <text start="383.529" dur="6.63">how and and at what price points it</text>
  <text start="386.769" dur="6.24">makes sense for aborted fetuses to be</text>
  <text start="390.159" dur="6.72">sold and then also discussing things</text>
  <text start="393.009" dur="6.21">about like how if they keep it alive it</text>
  <text start="396.879" dur="3.84">actually is worth more this was all</text>
  <text start="399.219" dur="3.75">disturbing stuff that we uncovered a</text>
  <text start="400.719" dur="4.38">while ago but with that we have to</text>
  <text start="402.969" dur="2.831">remember that Q is kind of waking us up</text>
  <text start="405.099" dur="2.56">this is</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="3.269">one of the harsher red pills and you</text>
  <text start="407.659" dur="4.051">know if we&amp;#39;re gonna cover the stuff with</text>
  <text start="409.069" dur="3.871">Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein Island we</text>
  <text start="411.71" dur="3.239">have to be able to cover this stuff as</text>
  <text start="412.94" dur="4.439">well the next cue post basically is a</text>
  <text start="414.949" dur="5.46">link and it&amp;#39;s a direct link to this</text>
  <text start="417.379" dur="5.701">Twitter post where it says unchallenged</text>
  <text start="420.409" dur="4.741">allegations of a DNC computer hack</text>

  <text start="426.65" dur="4.71">Mullen report but analysis of the files</text>
  <text start="428.659" dur="4.47">themselves shows otherwise commentary by</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="3.839">Adrienne Norman DC and this is a report</text>
  <text start="433.129" dur="3.901">from The Epoch Times that when you click</text>

  <text start="437.03" dur="3.33">story now what does this story cover</text>
  <text start="438.56" dur="3.87">well it covers something that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="4.26">known for quite some time actually and</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="5.13">that is that there is no actual evidence</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="4.71">provided by Muller that proves beyond a</text>
  <text start="447.56" dur="4.53">reasonable doubt that the Russians were</text>
  <text start="449.33" dur="5.7">somehow involved in hacking the DNC in</text>
  <text start="452.09" dur="5.609">order to legally obtain the emails that</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="6.479">were then leaked to WikiLeaks so and</text>
  <text start="457.699" dur="5.97">this goes back to what was found through</text>
  <text start="461.509" dur="4.111">the Muller investigation with regard to</text>
  <text start="463.669" dur="4.141">the 12 Russians who were indicted who</text>
  <text start="465.62" dur="4.079">apparently are in Russia so we&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="467.81" dur="3.659">ever see a court in the United States</text>
  <text start="469.699" dur="4.5">but they were indicted by robert muller</text>
  <text start="471.469" dur="3.901">nonetheless so what it goes on to talk</text>
  <text start="474.199" dur="4.261">about in this article is something that</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ve known for quite some time but it</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="4.949">kind of puts it in the guise of how the</text>
  <text start="480.68" dur="5.94">Muller report just basically ignored it</text>
  <text start="483.409" dur="5.16">and what that is is right here it says</text>

  <text start="737.69" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s just a fact so you know these are</text>
  <text start="741.35" dur="4.65">some things that cues pointing back to</text>

  <text start="757.25" dur="4.26">and I have to say this and I think the</text>
  <text start="759.8" dur="3.81">president would agree what we really</text>
  <text start="761.51" dur="4.37">need is Congress to step up and take</text>

  <text start="786.95" dur="3.54">destroy our country it won&amp;#39;t make our</text>
  <text start="788.84" dur="4.56">country great it will destroy our</text>
  <text start="790.49" dur="4.86">country and especially considering the</text>
  <text start="793.4" dur="4.41">majority of people right now the the</text>
  <text start="795.35" dur="3.75">million people a year now estimated who</text>
  <text start="797.81" dur="3.42">are trying to cross our border illegally</text>
  <text start="799.1" dur="4.799">are crossing our border illegally</text>
  <text start="801.23" dur="7.859">and being detained I guess these people</text>
  <text start="803.899" dur="7.86">are literally not coming here you know</text>
  <text start="809.089" dur="4.141">with a million bucks and in you know a</text>
  <text start="811.759" dur="3.75">trust fund or something they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="813.23" dur="5.159">here with nothing and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="815.509" dur="5.25">a burden on the state and at some point</text>
  <text start="818.389" dur="4.14">the state will collapse if we put that</text>
  <text start="820.759" dur="2.88">kind of pressure on it and I think</text>
  <text start="822.529" dur="2.37">that&amp;#39;s why we have to remember how</text>
  <text start="823.639" dur="3.271">important this is for the upcoming</text>
  <text start="824.899" dur="5.011">election and it is worth noting though</text>
  <text start="826.91" dur="6.15">that humanitarian aid is very important</text>
  <text start="829.91" dur="4.56">but there are there are also borders and</text>
  <text start="833.06" dur="4.339">I think that&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="834.47" dur="5.94">right so here we are the next one is</text>
  <text start="837.399" dur="5.38">this one which Q&amp;#39;s saying Planned</text>

  <text start="842.779" dur="2.851">something we have to look forward to we</text>
  <text start="844.04" dur="6.06">all know what Q&amp;#39;s pointed out before</text>
  <text start="845.63" dur="7.769">that the incredible you know unethical</text>
  <text start="850.1" dur="6.679">nature of how political campaign money</text>
  <text start="853.399" dur="6.63">gets basically put in this you know</text>
  <text start="856.779" dur="6.071">circular system self-feeding system</text>
  <text start="860.029" dur="4.68">where you have the politicians they get</text>

  <text start="870.86" dur="4.56">gives more money to politicians and it</text>
  <text start="872.99" dur="4.289">just repeats itself and it&amp;#39;s how you</text>
  <text start="875.42" dur="4.32">know you get these you know insular</text>

  <text start="882.35" dur="3.719">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re trying to break up</text>
  <text start="884.12" dur="4.399">here because you know these</text>
  <text start="886.069" dur="5.431">organizations are basically subsidizing</text>

  <text start="891.5" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s really something that nobody seems</text>
  <text start="893.06" dur="4.86">to care about but this article from</text>

  <text start="1172.39" dur="2.76">this is really because digitally that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1174.52" dur="2.7">what it is</text>
  <text start="1175.15" dur="4.47">this is what cue is trying to show us</text>
  <text start="1177.22" dur="3.99">and they won&amp;#39;t even see if they</text>
  <text start="1179.62" dur="2.88">acknowledge cue I think that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="1181.21" dur="3.57">biggest fear as well because if they</text>
  <text start="1182.5" dur="4.95">give cue the legitimacy of acknowledging</text>
  <text start="1184.78" dur="4.98">what cue is then that in and of itself</text>
  <text start="1187.45" dur="4.26">will legitimize all the stuff that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1189.76" dur="4.17">been doing here for so long and because</text>
  <text start="1191.71" dur="4.83">we kind of snuck this in behind them</text>
  <text start="1193.93" dur="3.18">without them really realizing until it</text>
  <text start="1196.54" dur="2.79">was too late</text>
  <text start="1197.11" dur="3.87">now they&amp;#39;re basically stuck between a</text>
  <text start="1199.33" dur="2.88">rock and a hard place</text>
  <text start="1200.98" dur="3.15">and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re going to continue</text>
  <text start="1202.21" dur="4.62">to intensify the attacks they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1204.13" dur="5.4">to continue to call us all of these</text>
  <text start="1206.83" dur="5.52">these pejoratives and names that will</text>
  <text start="1209.53" dur="5.04">only seek to discredit our movement but</text>
  <text start="1212.35" dur="4.829">we will persevere against that and I</text>
  <text start="1214.57" dur="5.01">think that&amp;#39;s what Q is trying to give us</text>
  <text start="1217.179" dur="3.931">an idea of what we&amp;#39;re doing and I</text>
  <text start="1219.58" dur="4.17">believe that this is really something</text>
  <text start="1221.11" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve seen over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="1223.75" dur="4.26">as Q says here you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s psych</text>
  <text start="1226" dur="3.51">101 if you see and hear the same thing</text>
  <text start="1228.01" dur="2.94">over and over again you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1229.51" dur="2.82">eventually believe it and that&amp;#39;s what a</text>
  <text start="1230.95" dur="2.729">lot of people do because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1232.33" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t have the time to do this research</text>
  <text start="1233.679" dur="4.5">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t have the access to</text>
  <text start="1235.66" dur="4.08">get to watch these videos and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1238.179" dur="2.611">you guys got to share this content and</text>
  <text start="1239.74" dur="2.55">you got to go out and do your own</text>
  <text start="1240.79" dur="3.509">research and you got to share your own</text>
  <text start="1242.29" dur="3.75">articles and links and do your own stuff</text>
  <text start="1244.299" dur="3.211">on your social media because this is a</text>
  <text start="1246.04" dur="4.17">movement that we&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="1247.51" dur="5.01">day by day piece by piece just by</text>
  <text start="1250.21" dur="3.93">telling you know our truth and for me</text>
  <text start="1252.52" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s about spreading that the great</text>
  <text start="1254.14" dur="4.89">glory of God as I can and and then</text>
  <text start="1256.72" dur="5.339">telling the truth as I know it so look</text>
  <text start="1259.03" dur="5.399">that&amp;#39;s what we do every day here the</text>
  <text start="1262.059" dur="5.011">next one here is this one&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="1264.429" dur="5.301">the last post we got stealth bomber data</text>
  <text start="1267.07" dur="9.15">first flight date of Muller&amp;#39;s testimony</text>
  <text start="1269.73" dur="10.8">ABCDE 1 2 3 4 5 b 2 q so few ways that</text>
  <text start="1276.22" dur="6.87">Anton&amp;#39;s are reading this first of all if</text>
  <text start="1280.53" dur="5.38">Robert Muller does something crazy at</text>
  <text start="1283.09" dur="6.089">this this testimony in front of Congress</text>
  <text start="1285.91" dur="5.13">then we&amp;#39;re gonna have to really this is</text>
  <text start="1289.179" dur="3.99">gonna be a really intense time because a</text>
  <text start="1291.04" dur="5.57">lot of Anton&amp;#39;s have said for a long time</text>
  <text start="1293.169" dur="6.38">that Robert Muller could possibly be</text>
  <text start="1296.61" dur="6.09">some sort of stealth bomber you know</text>
  <text start="1299.549" dur="6.241">meaning that that he was just basically</text>
  <text start="1302.7" dur="5.83">playing a fool the whole way to let them</text>
  <text start="1305.79" dur="4.18">incriminate themselves and to then turn</text>
  <text start="1308.53" dur="4.17">around and say well now we have evidence</text>
  <text start="1309.97" dur="5.67">that you guys did all this I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1312.7" dur="7.56">if that&amp;#39;s the case but I will say this</text>
  <text start="1315.64" dur="7.83">let&amp;#39;s take this next one and we&amp;#39;ll run</text>
  <text start="1320.26" dur="7.56">with that for a second so what the next</text>
  <text start="1323.47" dur="6.89">one is showing here is that on July 17th</text>
  <text start="1327.82" dur="5.41">1989 that was the first flight of the</text>
  <text start="1330.36" dur="4.13">b-2 stealth bomber that was</text>
  <text start="1333.23" dur="6.75">launched by the United States Air Force</text>
  <text start="1334.49" dur="7.439">so this is interesting let&amp;#39;s just think</text>
  <text start="1339.98" dur="5.04">about this what day is Robert Miller</text>
  <text start="1341.929" dur="6.87">scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill</text>
  <text start="1345.02" dur="8.25">before Congress July 17th so the same</text>
  <text start="1348.799" dur="7.561">day wouldn&amp;#39;t it be pretty fantastic if</text>
  <text start="1353.27" dur="5.399">Robert Mahler all along was actually</text>
  <text start="1356.36" dur="4.71">working for the good guys</text>
  <text start="1358.669" dur="4.411">and or at some point had been flipped</text>
  <text start="1361.07" dur="3.3">and or this has all been part of the</text>
  <text start="1363.08" dur="2.91">plan from the beginning I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1364.37" dur="3.54">throwing it out there I&amp;#39;m not sure if</text>
  <text start="1365.99" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s what this is saying we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="1367.91" dur="6.72">wait and see and then this the ABCDE one</text>
  <text start="1372.35" dur="3.9">two three or five and then it says b2 a</text>
  <text start="1374.63" dur="5.34">lot of people are basically saying that</text>
  <text start="1376.25" dur="8.76">the b2 is a stealth bomber but also b2</text>
  <text start="1379.97" dur="7.079">is Bill Barr the Attorney General hmm so</text>
  <text start="1385.01" dur="6.24">bill bar and robert muller may join</text>
  <text start="1387.049" dur="6.301">forces somehow or bill bar is gonna do</text>
  <text start="1391.25" dur="4.13">some kind of testimony i don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1393.35" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to wait and see but</text>
  <text start="1395.38" dur="4.75">this is very interesting it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1397.82" dur="5.01">to look forward to we only have one week</text>
  <text start="1400.13" dur="5.58">basically from today so we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>

  <text start="1405.71" dur="6.24">very interesting as well so that&amp;#39;s</text>
