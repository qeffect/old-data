  <text start="232.2" dur="4.74">forget we will never forgive and then it</text>
  <text start="234.27" dur="4.59">gives this White House proclamation and</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="5.43">the proclamation basically goes through</text>
  <text start="238.86" dur="5.28">the fact that you actually have this day</text>
  <text start="242.37" dur="3.42">that we&amp;#39;ve named September 11th is</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="3.36">Patriot day and why do we do that we did</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="3">that in remembrance of the 3,000</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="4.32">precious lives that were lost but then</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="5.31">also in a remembrance of what it means</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="6.12">to be American what it means to be a</text>
  <text start="254.1" dur="5.91">single country under God what we have is</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="4.77">really a lot of division and separation</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="5.64">and that all disappeared after that day</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="3.929">in September 11th and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="4.259">that you know</text>
  <text start="266.639" dur="5.071">that&amp;#39;s well I&amp;#39;m not going to get into</text>
  <text start="269.909" dur="3.961">the weeds when it comes to talking about</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="3.81">my personal pains on different theories</text>
  <text start="273.87" dur="3.599">that we talk about here on the channel</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="3.81">sometimes about World Trade Center the</text>
  <text start="277.469" dur="3.54">building seven and you know what</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="3.959">actually happened that day and all that</text>
  <text start="281.009" dur="7.68">what I will say is this that this is a</text>
  <text start="283.289" dur="7.35">great Proclamation and it reminds us of</text>
  <text start="288.689" dur="3.57">the sacrifice that was made the courage</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="5.451">grit and selflessness that was shown</text>
  <text start="292.259" dur="6.541">that day it reminds us of the people who</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="4.509">courageously braved fire smoke and</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="3.899">debris descending deep into piles of</text>
  <text start="300.599" dur="4.741">rubble and ash and twisted iron to</text>
  <text start="302.699" dur="4.5">search for survivors what we did we came</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="6.389">together as Americans we came together</text>
  <text start="307.199" dur="8.161">as individuals who under the same flag</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="5.791">could say that we could look past every</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="4.08">difference imaginable that day to help</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="5.869">one another as human beings and as we</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="6.629">get further into this new age of</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="4.511">increased division increased hostility</text>
  <text start="326.069" dur="4.621">we have to remember what it means to be</text>
  <text start="327.9" dur="6">Americans it&amp;#39;s one nation under God</text>
  <text start="330.69" dur="5.52">indivisible with liberty and justice for</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="4.41">all and that&amp;#39;s what we live by that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="3.72">what we have to live by as a country or</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="3.359">else we won&amp;#39;t have a country anymore so</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="4.049">that&amp;#39;s why days like today are very</text>
  <text start="341.669" dur="5.521">important because we&amp;#39;re not remembering</text>
  <text start="343.979" dur="4.8">the the horrible nature of the attacks</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="3.899">that occurred that day what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.779" dur="5.341">remembering is what brought us together</text>
  <text start="351.089" dur="7.5">as Americans what how we reacted even</text>
  <text start="354.12" dur="6.21">though the majority 99.999% of everyone</text>
  <text start="358.589" dur="3.901">in this country had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="3.839">that attack and whatever your theories</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="4.349">are on who is responsible you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="4.981">heard a lot and I pretty open to most</text>
  <text start="366.839" dur="5.121">ideas at this point because I believe in</text>
  <text start="369.15" dur="6.87">freedom of speech freedom of thought but</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="6.1">regardless of that you saw our country</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="3.75">come together and everybody coalesced</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="5.909">everybody came together around the same</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="7.859">idea that we are one country under one</text>
  <text start="383.969" dur="6.181">God and we are gonna work for each other</text>
  <text start="387.629" dur="4.85">look past the small differences to</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="4.46">become better and that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="4.151">principle that we need to remember</text>
  <text start="394.61" dur="5.55">during this day in this time of</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="6.14">reflection as we see it here now</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="4.56">want to stick around for this too we</text>
  <text start="402.77" dur="7.32">have is there I have a question is there</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="8.52">a possible connection did President</text>
  <text start="410.09" dur="6.45">Trump actually give us a another hint</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="5.4">that Q is real and another proof of Q on</text>
  <text start="416.54" dur="4.35">his Twitter well let&amp;#39;s take a look at it</text>
  <text start="418.64" dur="4.59">first we have to look at this today</text>
  <text start="420.89" dur="5.37">early this morning for 19 we had</text>
  <text start="423.23" dur="6.03">President Trump actually post this tweet</text>
  <text start="426.26" dur="5.34">saying new stroke page text revealed</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="5.37">media leaked strategy at Fox News so</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="7.58">terrible and nothing is being done at</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="7.47">DOJ or FBI but the world is watching and</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="4.84">they get it completely so first of all</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="5.28">let&amp;#39;s just go over some of the obvious</text>
  <text start="444.02" dur="5.82">stuff I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we were just given</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="4.92">this exact article by Q not more than a</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="4.44">couple days ago when Q gave us right</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="6.15">here I&amp;#39;m gonna scroll down and show you</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="6.51">the Sarah a Cardinal Carter article and</text>
  <text start="458.45" dur="6.69">what did this Sarah a Cardinal card</text>
  <text start="460.79" dur="6.09">article outlined exactly what we were</text>
  <text start="465.14" dur="5.76">talking about here let me pull up the</text>
  <text start="466.88" dur="6.27">right one here we go look at this well</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="4.98">lo and behold you have Senator Mark</text>
  <text start="473.15" dur="4.83">Warner here out of Sarah Carter comm and</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="5.85">that was the document that we pulled up</text>
  <text start="477.98" dur="5.61">right here where it explains that Peter</text>
  <text start="481.73" dur="5.79">struck and Lisa Paige were discussing</text>
  <text start="483.59" dur="5.82">their media leak strategy so yesterday Q</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="4.35">posts all this then</text>
  <text start="489.41" dur="5.34">today President Trump follows up on his</text>
  <text start="491.87" dur="5.22">main Twitter not only telling us about</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="3.54">that exact story and the fact that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.09" dur="3.09">so terrible and that there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="498.29" dur="6.21">being done about it by the DOJ or the</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="9.12">FBI but uses a phrase that Q uses quite</text>
  <text start="504.5" dur="10.64">often saying the world is watching</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="11.19">so look then we can see it right here</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="8.62">this was from September 7th here the</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="6.03">world is watching that&amp;#39;s just the most</text>
  <text start="523.76" dur="7.5">recent one we have 24 examples of that</text>
  <text start="526.52" dur="7.47">right and Q and this is an aunt on</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="4.829">asking to actually declassify the</text>
  <text start="533.99" dur="3.93">document the FISA documents now I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="3.12">speculated yesterday that it was</text>
  <text start="537.92" dur="3">possible that that document comes out</text>
  <text start="539.209" dur="3.421">but I think one of the things that you</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="5.669">know I wasn&amp;#39;t really thinking about when</text>
  <text start="542.63" dur="7.32">I made that basically hyper guess was</text>
  <text start="546.589" dur="4.771">that you told us basically when this</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="2.759">information comes out it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="4.26">implicate people and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="552.709" dur="4.621">impossible for them to ignore so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="5.07">wondering what&amp;#39;s gonna happen when it</text>
  <text start="557.33" dur="4.89">comes to you know revealing the truth</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="3">because like somebody pointed out and I</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="4.32">thought that was very interesting the</text>
  <text start="563.69" dur="6.149">the parts of the FISA the Carter page</text>
  <text start="566.54" dur="6.75">FISA that were used to surveil the</text>
  <text start="569.839" dur="7.231">president have already proven that there</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="5.82">was an illegal basically a manoeuvring</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="3.959">of information to get the search or the</text>
  <text start="579.11" dur="3.72">surveillance warrants to umbrella</text>
  <text start="581.029" dur="3.331">surveillance to have umbrella</text>

  <text start="584.36" dur="8.19">his goings on his campaign through Trump</text>
  <text start="587.029" dur="7.081">Tower and others other places but when</text>
  <text start="592.55" dur="4.68">the redactions come out that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="594.11" dur="4.56">tell us who did this so that&amp;#39;s the big</text>
  <text start="597.23" dur="3.57">difference right now we already know</text>
  <text start="598.67" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s why the media won&amp;#39;t cover it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="600.8" dur="4.529">it&amp;#39;s literally the most I feel like</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re screaming at a brick wall here</text>
  <text start="605.329" dur="4.32">because you know for me I do this every</text>

  <text start="609.649" dur="7.291">I&amp;#39;m trying to hammer the message home</text>

  <text start="1713.149" dur="5.191">they have zeal for God but not according</text>
  <text start="1715.46" dur="5.309">to knowledge because they disregarded</text>
  <text start="1718.34" dur="3.799">the righteousness from God and attempted</text>

  <text start="1734" dur="5.519">the one who does these things will live</text>
  <text start="1736.669" dur="7.591">by them but the righteousness that comes</text>
  <text start="1739.519" dur="6.961">from faith speaks like this do not say</text>
  <text start="1744.26" dur="5.22">in your heart who will go up to heaven</text>
  <text start="1746.48" dur="5.669">that is to bring Christ down or who will</text>

  <text start="1752.149" dur="5.671">abyss that is to bring Christ up from</text>
  <text start="1754.97" dur="5.04">the dead on the contrary what does it</text>
  <text start="1757.82" dur="4.89">say the message is near you in your</text>
  <text start="1760.01" dur="5.37">mouth and in your heart this is the</text>
  <text start="1762.71" dur="4.65">message of faith that we proclaim if you</text>
  <text start="1765.38" dur="4.44">confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord</text>
  <text start="1767.36" dur="6.539">and believe in your head or in your</text>
  <text start="1769.82" dur="7.17">heart that God raised him from the dead</text>
  <text start="1773.899" dur="5.311">you will be saved with the heart one</text>
  <text start="1776.99" dur="4.049">believes resulting in righteousness and</text>
  <text start="1779.21" dur="4.949">with the mouth one confesses resulting</text>
  <text start="1781.039" dur="5.49">in salvation now the scripture says no</text>
  <text start="1784.159" dur="4.591">one who believes on him will be put to</text>
  <text start="1786.529" dur="6.15">shame for there is no distinction</text>
  <text start="1788.75" dur="7.08">between Jew and Greek the same lord of</text>
  <text start="1792.679" dur="4.831">all as rich to all who call on him for</text>
  <text start="1795.83" dur="3.74">everyone who calls on the name of the</text>
  <text start="1797.51" dur="7.409">Lord will be saved</text>
  <text start="1799.57" dur="8.38">and what that says to me is what is</text>
  <text start="1804.919" dur="4.86">important what is important to us what</text>
  <text start="1807.95" dur="4.319">should we take account of when we think</text>
  <text start="1809.779" dur="6.351">about these things should it be that our</text>
  <text start="1812.269" dur="7.921">righteousness is the most important</text>
  <text start="1816.13" dur="6.039">facet to our being well yes in the sense</text>
  <text start="1820.19" dur="4.469">that we have to have that righteousness</text>
  <text start="1822.169" dur="5.341">through this faith and how do we how do</text>
  <text start="1824.659" dur="5.671">we find that faith it says through your</text>
  <text start="1827.51" dur="5.46">mouth right so by proclaiming our faith</text>
  <text start="1830.33" dur="5.579">in our Lord and Savior and proclaiming</text>
  <text start="1832.97" dur="4.98">that that gift that God has basically</text>
  <text start="1835.909" dur="4.051">blessed us with with the sacrifice of</text>
  <text start="1837.95" dur="7.8">Christ on the cross for our sins but</text>
  <text start="1839.96" dur="7.98">then also also it says your heart you</text>
  <text start="1845.75" dur="4.59">have to know in your heart that God</text>
  <text start="1847.94" dur="3.42">raised him from the dead and that you</text>
  <text start="1850.34" dur="2.91">will be saved</text>
  <text start="1851.36" dur="4.47">so through your mouth and through your</text>
  <text start="1853.25" dur="4.799">heart is how you you substantiate this</text>
  <text start="1855.83" dur="4.05">incredible faith that gives you the</text>
  <text start="1858.049" dur="3.061">power to go forward so when you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1859.88" dur="3.24">feeling good when you&amp;#39;re not feeling</text>
  <text start="1861.11" dur="3.9">strong when you know that you need God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1863.12" dur="2.51">strength and courage and wisdom to come</text>
  <text start="1865.01" dur="2.69">into your</text>
  <text start="1865.63" dur="4.32">you have to look to him you have to</text>
  <text start="1867.7" dur="4.2">first believe in your heart or you have</text>
  <text start="1869.95" dur="5.28">to first proclaim through your mouth I</text>
  <text start="1871.9" dur="6.27">believe and then you have to truly</text>
  <text start="1875.23" dur="5.34">believe in your heart that that</text>
  <text start="1878.17" dur="4.59">sacrifice was made for your eternal</text>
  <text start="1880.57" dur="4.35">salvation and once you do those two</text>
  <text start="1882.76" dur="4.59">things or with repenting and living a</text>
  <text start="1884.92" dur="5.43">humble life of servitude to our Lord and</text>
  <text start="1887.35" dur="5.52">Savior that is what will save all of us</text>
  <text start="1890.35" dur="3.99">and that&amp;#39;s the message we need to share</text>
  <text start="1892.87" dur="4.02">with one another every day and</text>
  <text start="1894.34" dur="4.2">everything that we do so I pray for each</text>
