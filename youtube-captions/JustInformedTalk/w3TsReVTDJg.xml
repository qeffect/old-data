  <text start="193.7" dur="4.23">who&amp;#39;s new I always have to reiterate</text>
  <text start="195.079" dur="5.13">there is an algorithmic suppression that</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="3.809">is happening with Google and YouTube and</text>
  <text start="200.209" dur="3.661">all these other big tech companies where</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="4.801">they are secretly and subliminally</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="4.83">censoring what you can see and what the</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="6.059">American public and the public globally</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="6.42">can&amp;#39;t get in access to so it&amp;#39;s incumbent</text>
  <text start="212.599" dur="4.59">upon all of us to share this on our</text>
  <text start="215.12" dur="3.63">social media that&amp;#39;s how we circumvent</text>
  <text start="217.189" dur="2.761">them that&amp;#39;s how we go around their</text>
  <text start="218.75" dur="3.599">censorship so I always encourage</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="3.719">everyone watch these videos share them</text>
  <text start="222.349" dur="3.78">on your social media get the word out</text>
  <text start="223.669" dur="3.391">that way that is really important and if</text>
  <text start="226.129" dur="2.131">you sure got your head going what is</text>

  <text start="230.78" dur="4.98">Awakening and share that on your social</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="4.379">media as well so today first thing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.76" dur="3.39">going to talk about is Robert Maxwell</text>
  <text start="237.109" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m Jeffrey Epstein Robert Maxwell is</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="5.13">the father of just Lee Maxwell Jeffery</text>
  <text start="241.159" dur="6.031">Epstein&amp;#39;s partner in crimes it says here</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="4.47">what&amp;#39;s fascinating though is this the</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="3.57">suspicious nature of both Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="4.29">Epstein&amp;#39;s death and this Robert</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="4.08">Maxwell&amp;#39;s death now this article I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="3.99">agree with everything in it obviously I</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="5.31">think it takes a pretty different look</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="5.34">at these issues but what I do see that</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="3.66">that seems to be important is the</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="4.38">connection to Israeli intelligence</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="6.21">between Robert Maxwell and Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="7.83">Epstein and how everything seems to look</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="9.05">like from a completely I&amp;#39;m trying to be</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="7.95">as objective as a kid outside viewpoint</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="5.68">truly looks like there were some very</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="4.53">major honeypot operations being run by</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="5.07">foreign intelligence services against</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="5.01">corporate leaders politicians</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="6.089">celebrities you name it and that these</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="7.589">people Epstein and Maxwell and and by</text>
  <text start="295.909" dur="6.661">proud you know obviously his Maxwell&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.659" dur="5.1">daughter Gia Slade these people were</text>
  <text start="302.57" dur="5.88">running these blackmail and extortion</text>
  <text start="304.759" dur="5.581">operations on US soil in a lot of cases</text>
  <text start="308.45" dur="5.4">and they were doing it</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="6.18">presumably to garner more power and</text>
  <text start="313.85" dur="4.89">control over our government here in this</text>
  <text start="316.52" dur="4.77">country now whether this was a</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="4.77">combination of Mossad and other</text>
  <text start="321.29" dur="4.38">intelligence services it&amp;#39;s still hard to</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="4.08">tell that kind of thing at this point</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="3.6">but I can tell you right now when you</text>
  <text start="327.59" dur="3.96">read through this article it seems as</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="5.72">though whoever wrote this article first</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="7.53">of all Tyler Durden was not very happy</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="7.81">actually Jennifer Matsui with the fact</text>
  <text start="339.08" dur="7.08">that President Trump knows Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="5.43">Epstein but there is no evidence to show</text>
  <text start="346.16" dur="6.87">anything other than the fact that there</text>
  <text start="348.23" dur="6.27">is evidence to prove that Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="353.03" dur="3.99">was piling around with Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="3.84">at one point in the early 90s when they</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="2.76">happen to know each other and they were</text>
  <text start="358.34" dur="4.26">in the same circles and living in the</text>
  <text start="359.78" dur="4.94">same cities but that seems quite normal</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="3.81">considering if you are a multi</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="4.24">multi-millionaire and you&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="366.41" dur="4.62">Palm Beach or New York City you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="4.2">be at some of the same social functions</text>
  <text start="371.03" dur="5.58">and events as other Multi multi</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="5.73">millionaires right so the real</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="3.87">difference obviously is that all the</text>
  <text start="378.89" dur="4.43">evidence suggests that Bill Clinton was</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="5.58">participating in the debauchery and the</text>
  <text start="383.32" dur="8.26">alleged underage sex rings that were</text>
  <text start="386.06" dur="10.17">being put forth by AB steam and that</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="6.33">aside this is really very important that</text>
  <text start="396.23" dur="3.68">we continue to keep in the back of our</text>
  <text start="397.91" dur="6.41">head that this is all related back to</text>
  <text start="399.91" dur="8.08">intelligence agencies and clandestine</text>
  <text start="404.32" dur="5.23">organizations that were trying to set up</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="3.12">these individuals these high-ranking</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="4.59">individuals and it&amp;#39;s been going on for a</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="5.01">long time so you can make of this what</text>
  <text start="414.14" dur="3.69">you may like I said I don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="5.09">everything that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s in this article</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="5.67">but I do think it&amp;#39;s got a good outline</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="7.78">here&amp;#39;s another one I thought would be</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="6.78">important to share so yesterday there</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="2.7">was this tweet from the White House</text>
  <text start="430.28" dur="2.82">saying each year the White House is</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="3">decorated for Christmas by a team of</text>
  <text start="433.1" dur="3.54">talented volunteers learn more about</text>
  <text start="434.69" dur="3.87">volunteering decorate serving as greeter</text>
  <text start="436.64" dur="4.38">or performing music during the holiday</text>

  <text start="734.49" dur="4.95">Russian operative well that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="752.779" dur="6.221">agencies could you possibly be working</text>

  <text start="771.959" dur="6.75">have been a possibility I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="773.73" dur="6.69">and don&amp;#39;t forget back in 2015 that clip</text>
  <text start="778.709" dur="3.931">you saw at the beginning this video that</text>
  <text start="780.42" dur="5.25">was President Trump back in 2015 singing</text>

  <text start="790.62" dur="4.44">everything that we&amp;#39;re dealing with here</text>
  <text start="791.76" dur="6.21">today so here is another story I wanted</text>
  <text start="795.06" dur="3.96">to talk about quickly one of the Anton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.97" dur="3.9">picked this up and I thought this was</text>
  <text start="799.02" dur="5.28">really interesting so apparently there</text>
  <text start="801.87" dur="6.17">is an in-n-out burger in Los Angeles</text>
  <text start="804.3" dur="6.06">California where just Lane Maxwell was</text>

  <text start="810.36" dur="6.45">it came out showing her at the in and</text>
  <text start="814.98" dur="4.32">out burger here and and what was very</text>
  <text start="816.81" dur="4.71">important about this story is they talk</text>
  <text start="819.3" dur="4.349">about the book she was reading she was</text>
  <text start="821.52" dur="4.23">reading this book the book of honor the</text>
  <text start="823.649" dur="4.651">secret lives and deaths of CIA</text>
  <text start="825.75" dur="5.279">operatives so I think she&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="828.3" dur="4.86">insinuate that her and Epstein are both</text>
  <text start="831.029" dur="5.461">CIA operatives who were working</text>
  <text start="833.16" dur="5.58">clandestinely not only for I think our</text>

  <text start="838.74" dur="3.36">foreign intelligence services</text>
  <text start="840.15" dur="3.93">I noted at the beginning of this video</text>
  <text start="842.1" dur="3.87">with that in mind though what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="844.08" dur="5.49">fascinating is what the Anton picked up</text>
  <text start="845.97" dur="5.34">on in this post right which you guys I</text>
  <text start="849.57" dur="3.06">can&amp;#39;t even make this stuff up so first</text>

  <text start="969.78" dur="3.91">you can explain this is very simple it</text>
  <text start="972.6" dur="4.989">is</text>
  <text start="973.69" dur="5.43">a cult of corruption where the first</text>
  <text start="977.589" dur="4.05">thing they do is they get you in with</text>

  <text start="1291.71" dur="5.46">global insurance company and you can</text>
  <text start="1294.32" dur="4.26">watch these videos but there is more to</text>
  <text start="1297.17" dur="3.06">this than I think most even will</text>
  <text start="1298.58" dur="4.979">understand so we got to keep an eye on</text>
  <text start="1300.23" dur="4.829">this now let&amp;#39;s talk about the New Mexico</text>
  <text start="1303.559" dur="3.541">ranch as oral ranch</text>
  <text start="1305.059" dur="4.291">Epstein&amp;#39;s New Mexico ranch linked to the</text>
  <text start="1307.1" dur="4.079">investigation this is back in July when</text>
  <text start="1309.35" dur="4.26">we were first getting these reports</text>
  <text start="1311.179" dur="6.511">about this ranch out in New Mexico that</text>
  <text start="1313.61" dur="6.51">was owned by Jeffrey Epstein now how did</text>
  <text start="1317.69" dur="4.17">he get this he bought it from the former</text>
  <text start="1320.12" dur="4.26">governor of New Mexico a man named Bruce</text>
  <text start="1321.86" dur="5.97">King who is Bruce King well Bruce King</text>
  <text start="1324.38" dur="7.5">seems to be in my opinion the person who</text>
  <text start="1327.83" dur="7.11">was set up and had this piece of land</text>
  <text start="1331.88" dur="6.84">taken I&amp;#39;m not sure that&amp;#39;s speculative</text>
  <text start="1334.94" dur="5.58">let&amp;#39;s be clear but it seems that there</text>
  <text start="1338.72" dur="3.959">was no reason for this Bruce King guy to</text>
  <text start="1340.52" dur="4.86">sell this ranch to Jeffrey Epstein other</text>
  <text start="1342.679" dur="5.13">than the fact that Jeffrey Epstein may</text>
  <text start="1345.38" dur="4.62">have had some sort of I don&amp;#39;t know dirt</text>
  <text start="1347.809" dur="4.231">on him possibly that forced him to sell</text>
  <text start="1350" dur="4.98">because as we&amp;#39;ll see in this report</text>
  <text start="1352.04" dur="5.4">which was put together by this nation in</text>
  <text start="1354.98" dur="4.26">state calm really in-depth stuff you go</text>
  <text start="1357.44" dur="2.7">and read about this ranch and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1359.24" dur="3.8">gonna go through all this because</text>
  <text start="1360.14" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s a lot of information here but</text>
  <text start="1363.04" dur="4.21">first of all how do we know that this</text>
  <text start="1365.15" dur="5.1">ranch belongs to Jeffrey Epstein well</text>
  <text start="1367.25" dur="5.34">through a lot of the research and the</text>
  <text start="1370.25" dur="4.35">government statements it&amp;#39;s easy to put</text>
  <text start="1372.59" dur="3.959">together that Jeffrey Epstein on this</text>
  <text start="1374.6" dur="4.709">he called cypress Inc which was listed</text>
  <text start="1376.549" dur="5.431">as the owner of this property this eight</text>
  <text start="1379.309" dur="5.281">thousand acre ranch that he bought from</text>
  <text start="1381.98" dur="7.14">obviously governor Bruce King in 1993</text>
  <text start="1384.59" dur="6.75">and remember 1993 is the year that right</text>
  <text start="1389.12" dur="4.32">after Bill Clinton was elected and</text>
  <text start="1391.34" dur="5.91">Epstein started garnering a lot of power</text>
  <text start="1393.44" dur="5.52">and becoming a more powerful man and I</text>
  <text start="1397.25" dur="4.83">think that was around the time that he</text>
  <text start="1398.96" dur="7.62">was tapped to become this what they call</text>
  <text start="1402.08" dur="7.31">in the media pimp quote/unquote for the</text>
  <text start="1406.58" dur="5.25">elite with underage girls and the rest</text>
  <text start="1409.39" dur="5.8">what&amp;#39;s very fascinating though is that</text>
  <text start="1411.83" dur="6.329">the ranch he bought is still is still</text>
  <text start="1415.19" dur="5.46">surrounded on all sides by Hollywood</text>
  <text start="1418.159" dur="6.15">elites and the family of this Bruce King</text>
  <text start="1420.65" dur="5.97">so we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about that to going</text>
  <text start="1424.309" dur="5.37">forward in this report here&amp;#39;s an idea of</text>
  <text start="1426.62" dur="4.74">how the parcels are parceled out so this</text>
  <text start="1429.679" dur="4.051">is Jeffery Epstein&amp;#39;s plot here now</text>
  <text start="1431.36" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s some really suspicious the weird</text>
  <text start="1433.73" dur="3.66">things about it first of all in the</text>
  <text start="1435.74" dur="4.26">smack-dab in the middle of Jeffery</text>
  <text start="1437.39" dur="4.07">Epstein&amp;#39;s 8,000 acres is a plot of land</text>
  <text start="1440" dur="4.95">that belongs to the state of New Mexico</text>
  <text start="1441.46" dur="7.12">ok well that&amp;#39;s fascinating all around</text>
  <text start="1444.95" dur="6.87">him on the other side is property that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1448.58" dur="5.67">owned by the family of Bruce King his</text>
  <text start="1451.82" dur="4.2">kids and his brothers and sisters I</text>
  <text start="1454.25" dur="5.52">believe they owned all the surrounding</text>
  <text start="1456.02" dur="8.22">land to the south and east and west then</text>
  <text start="1459.77" dur="7.74">to the north west it seems you have this</text>
  <text start="1464.24" dur="6.78">Alexander LLC company now what is this</text>
  <text start="1467.51" dur="5.399">Alexander LLC company well let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="1471.02" dur="3.96">about that there was a piece of property</text>
  <text start="1472.909" dur="4.171">that&amp;#39;s very famous multiple Hollywood</text>
  <text start="1474.98" dur="4.47">films have been shot out there in the</text>
  <text start="1477.08" dur="4.74">desert in New Mexico just south of Santa</text>
  <text start="1479.45" dur="4.26">Fe in Stanley New Mexico and this on</text>
  <text start="1481.82" dur="5.099">this property which was a major</text>
  <text start="1483.71" dur="8.339">Hollywood film ranch filming ranch and</text>
  <text start="1486.919" dur="9.091">it&amp;#39;s currently owned by Tom Ford the</text>
  <text start="1492.049" dur="6.87">designer / whatever rich guy from</text>
  <text start="1496.01" dur="6.21">Hollywood who bought all this land I</text>
  <text start="1498.919" dur="4.831">think way back and now owns it so you</text>
  <text start="1502.22" dur="3.81">have Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s property</text>
  <text start="1503.75" dur="3.68">surrounded by a Hollywood filming ranch</text>
  <text start="1506.03" dur="3.77">where they film movies</text>
  <text start="1507.43" dur="4.95">and the rest of bill Kings family and a</text>
  <text start="1509.8" dur="5.31">bunch of Mexican state of New Mexico</text>
  <text start="1512.38" dur="4.92">property including this New Mexico solar</text>
  <text start="1515.11" dur="4.59">station LLC property which we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1517.3" dur="4.92">to talk about to what&amp;#39;s also fascinating</text>
  <text start="1519.7" dur="4.5">is they Anton&amp;#39;s pointed out a few things</text>
  <text start="1522.22" dur="4.17">first of all this this property does</text>
  <text start="1524.2" dur="4.29">contain a hanger and airstrip for planes</text>
  <text start="1526.39" dur="5.43">to presumably be able to take off and</text>
  <text start="1528.49" dur="5.55">land to this remote location at their</text>
  <text start="1531.82" dur="3.9">will but what&amp;#39;s very fascinating is they</text>
  <text start="1534.04" dur="3.42">anton picked up that there were a couple</text>
  <text start="1535.72" dur="3.48">of other planes just parked out in</text>
  <text start="1537.46" dur="4.53">fields in the middle of nowhere which</text>
  <text start="1539.2" dur="4.53">seemed to be some sort of I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1541.99" dur="5.31">escape plan</text>
  <text start="1543.73" dur="5.46">I thought that was interesting you go</text>
  <text start="1547.3" dur="5.88">through it here&amp;#39;s a point of interest</text>
  <text start="1549.19" dur="6.78">this was talking about the antenna</text>
  <text start="1553.18" dur="6.45">arrays on Epstein&amp;#39;s land there are these</text>
  <text start="1555.97" dur="6.84">massive arrays of what seemed to be</text>
  <text start="1559.63" dur="4.44">ground-based antenna and we&amp;#39;re not sure</text>
  <text start="1562.81" dur="2.82">what they&amp;#39;re being used for but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1564.07" dur="3.14">quite suspicious that they&amp;#39;re just stuck</text>
  <text start="1565.63" dur="5.82">out there in the middle of nowhere and</text>
  <text start="1567.21" dur="6.19">they could serve a much more nefarious</text>
  <text start="1571.45" dur="3.78">purpose but it&amp;#39;s hard to tell just by</text>
  <text start="1573.4" dur="3.42">looking at a picture here&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="1575.23" dur="2.94">antón points out there are two planes</text>
  <text start="1576.82" dur="1.77">just sitting out in the middle of</text>
  <text start="1578.17" dur="2.88">nowhere</text>
  <text start="1578.59" dur="5.19">on Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s property that</text>
  <text start="1581.05" dur="5.31">seemed to be hidden on all sides and put</text>
  <text start="1583.78" dur="4.59">in very remote places where it would</text>
  <text start="1586.36" dur="3.81">seem you could drive a car out and get</text>
  <text start="1588.37" dur="4.82">in one of these planes and just take off</text>
  <text start="1590.17" dur="5.94">if you had to bug out really quick</text>
  <text start="1593.19" dur="6.07">here&amp;#39;s a closer picture of the planes on</text>
  <text start="1596.11" dur="4.44">the property the planes are two and a</text>
  <text start="1599.26" dur="3.51">half miles a little over two and a half</text>
  <text start="1600.55" dur="4.17">miles from the actual airstrip and</text>
  <text start="1602.77" dur="5.37">hanger so what they ask is are these</text>
  <text start="1604.72" dur="6.6">planes for some sort of emergency escape</text>
  <text start="1608.14" dur="4.44">plan they talk about a fixture on the</text>
  <text start="1611.32" dur="3.3">property that has to be probably</text>
  <text start="1612.58" dur="4.38">serviced but that&amp;#39;s not really too much</text>
  <text start="1614.62" dur="4.02">there they talk about the dwelling</text>
  <text start="1616.96" dur="4.23">itself they they comment on the fact</text>
  <text start="1618.64" dur="4.26">that the ranch here that&amp;#39;s outside of</text>
  <text start="1621.19" dur="3.45">the actual mansion and property this</text>
  <text start="1622.9" dur="3.99">would be the actual Zorro ranch it seems</text>
  <text start="1624.64" dur="5.49">doesn&amp;#39;t even have any animals which is</text>
  <text start="1626.89" dur="4.92">really strange I guess I mean yeah it is</text>
  <text start="1630.13" dur="3.45">and then they talk about how there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1631.81" dur="4.59">lot of oil and fracking now I can tell</text>
  <text start="1633.58" dur="5.7">you right now it a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="1636.4" dur="4.35">heat out here out west where I am you</text>
  <text start="1639.28" dur="3.99">know Colorado New Mexico</text>
  <text start="1640.75" dur="5.25">a lot of people especially even on their</text>
  <text start="1643.27" dur="5.61">private property have oil and gas rigs</text>
  <text start="1646" dur="6.63">they have they&amp;#39;ll have holding tanks or</text>
  <text start="1648.88" dur="5.36">rocker pumps or and you name it you know</text>
  <text start="1652.63" dur="6.3">they basically will have everything</text>
  <text start="1654.24" dur="6.13">chemical dispensed units but it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1658.93" dur="3.36">a difference because you can own the</text>
  <text start="1660.37" dur="3.6">land without owning mineral rights and</text>
  <text start="1662.29" dur="4.53">that means that they can come on and</text>
  <text start="1663.97" dur="4.68">they can use the the little parcels of</text>
  <text start="1666.82" dur="4.83">land they have to extract the minerals</text>
  <text start="1668.65" dur="6.96">from underneath it&amp;#39;s complicated but it</text>
  <text start="1671.65" dur="6.93">is possible that this is just an outside</text>
  <text start="1675.61" dur="6.24">company that has a service set up or as</text>
  <text start="1678.58" dur="6.54">they pointed out in this in this post</text>
  <text start="1681.85" dur="4.86">that it could be a source of income for</text>
  <text start="1685.12" dur="2.88">them I mean if they own the land and the</text>
  <text start="1686.71" dur="2.94">mineral rights and they have the well</text>
  <text start="1688" dur="4.2">set up I mean that would be a steady</text>
  <text start="1689.65" dur="4.35">stream of income here&amp;#39;s a picture of the</text>
  <text start="1692.2" dur="3.78">actual ranch itself and they comment on</text>
  <text start="1694" dur="3.84">this garden here which is like a</text>
  <text start="1695.98" dur="4.23">labyrinth and how it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1697.84" dur="3.93">been flattened out and doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1700.21" dur="3.15">exist and people have compared it to the</text>
  <text start="1701.77" dur="3.27">tennis court and Epstein Island and</text>
  <text start="1703.36" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re asking what could be beneath it</text>
  <text start="1705.04" dur="6.27">yeah I&amp;#39;m going to ask the same question</text>
  <text start="1707.65" dur="6.45">I guess and there&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1711.31" dur="4.23">more here to kind of go over talks about</text>
  <text start="1714.1" dur="2.94">the King family and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1715.54" dur="3.36">connected to all these different</text>
  <text start="1717.04" dur="4.74">organizations if you look at the wife of</text>
  <text start="1718.9" dur="4.98">this the Bruce King the former AG of New</text>
  <text start="1721.78" dur="5.34">Mexico she&amp;#39;s got all types of</text>
  <text start="1723.88" dur="5.55">connections to everything I mean you</text>
  <text start="1727.12" dur="5.34">look at her resume it reads like a who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1729.43" dur="6.6">who of you know high government ranking</text>
  <text start="1732.46" dur="6.5">officials but talks about her work as a</text>
  <text start="1736.03" dur="7.2">the director of engineering at the</text>

  <text start="1755.65" dur="6.75">fascinating is that this Gary King has a</text>
