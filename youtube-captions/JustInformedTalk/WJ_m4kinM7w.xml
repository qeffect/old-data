  <text start="266.43" dur="2.76">disclosed</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="4.68">because so much ties back to foreign</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="5.37">heads of state much will be revealed we</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="4.44">want transparency but not at a cost we</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="3.99">can&amp;#39;t recover from it I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="4.589">this before with other people we have to</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="6.209">remember that the national security</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="5.131">aspect that comes into play here is we</text>
  <text start="284.759" dur="3.061">have to live in the world with these</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="3.66">other countries especially the ones that</text>
  <text start="287.82" dur="4.17">were buying influence that were paying</text>

  <text start="302.729" dur="3.571">that the information is not going to get</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="3.871">out there but I think some things may</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="4.47">never actually be able to come out at</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="5.31">least for now given the fact that we</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="4.86">have to maintain the order of the world</text>
  <text start="313.38" dur="3.629">it&amp;#39;s not the new world order it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="3.289">order of the world that we&amp;#39;re in now</text>

  <text start="365.31" dur="4.74">what did he represent back daddy</text>
  <text start="367.699" dur="5.041">represented the existential threat</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="5.88">needed to have a global</text>

  <text start="385.56" dur="4.41">people that we talk about all the time</text>
  <text start="386.699" dur="5.641">Soros outs the Rothschilds and then</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re puppets inside of different</text>
  <text start="392.34" dur="3.54">governments around the world especially</text>
  <text start="393.78" dur="6.18">in the EU and other places these</text>
  <text start="395.88" dur="6.36">individuals allowed this to happen</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="5.16">the reason why under the Obama</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="5.67">administration all Isis did was grow and</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="4.44">expand you look at what they did their</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="3.12">territorial expansion you look at all</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="4.109">the equipment that the United States</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="5.25">left for them they&amp;#39;re the the Humvees</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="4.5">and the tanks and the guns and then the</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="4.319">gums guns that were leaving Syria or</text>
  <text start="418.169" dur="4.081">Libya that just magically disappeared on</text>
  <text start="420.599" dur="3.871">enroute to Syria where we were</text>
  <text start="422.25" dur="4.62">supposedly arming arming the moderate</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="5.34">rebels which most of which turned out to</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="6.45">be connected to very extreme Islamic</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="6.12">terrorist groups so this in and of</text>
  <text start="433.32" dur="5.73">itself is the first step in in</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="4.38">combatting this global cabal and like we</text>
  <text start="439.05" dur="2.989">talked about in the last episode if you</text>
  <text start="440.31" dur="4.079">guys haven&amp;#39;t watch this episode about</text>
  <text start="442.039" dur="4.06">Israel and how they close down all of</text>
  <text start="444.389" dur="3.391">their embassies worldwide and how that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.099" dur="4.5">connected to Baghdad II and all this in</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="4.199">Trump and what&amp;#39;s going on you got to go</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="2.91">watch that show that any social media</text>
  <text start="451.979" dur="4.741">get the word out that way because this</text>
  <text start="453.509" dur="5.19">is a part of the the broader plan here</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="3.599">and I have to spend a second on this</text>
  <text start="458.699" dur="3.69">just to kind of highlight the fact that</text>
  <text start="460.319" dur="4.831">you know Isis is already naming their</text>
  <text start="462.389" dur="4.441">their replacements I believe the last</text>
  <text start="465.15" dur="3.9">replace the next replacement from</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="4.17">Baghdad he was taken out immediately</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="4.35">after almost the day after when they</text>
  <text start="471" dur="4.11">named that the second in command they</text>
  <text start="473.4" dur="6.21">were taken out by the military and now</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re appointing this guy named the</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="5.429">professor Abdullah kadosh as the new</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="5.639">head of Isis well what&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="485.039" dur="5.701">about all of these leaders of Isis</text>
  <text start="488.039" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t forget by the way that the</text>
  <text start="490.74" dur="3.83">original name for the Mossad or the</text>
  <text start="492.509" dur="4.801">Israeli intelligence was the Israeli</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="5.26">secret intelligence source or service</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="5.37">according to many people just throwing</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="4.95">that in there as an aside to understand</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="4.859">how and like I said this is not about</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="3.54">going after you know Israel or going</text>
  <text start="507.539" dur="2.91">after the United States</text>
  <text start="508.32" dur="4.38">we all have there there&amp;#39;s a deep state</text>
  <text start="510.449" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s a cabal there&amp;#39;s globalist that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.7" dur="2.639">the people we&amp;#39;re talking we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="513.899" dur="3.991">talking about an entire country an</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="4.731">entire you know an entire swath of</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="5.009">people we&amp;#39;re talking about very specific</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="5.59">factions within these organizations</text>
  <text start="522.899" dur="5.581">countries etc what I think&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="525.66" dur="5.1">though when you read these stories about</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="4.17">these these people they all have some</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="2.4">very interesting commonality and I</text>
  <text start="532.65" dur="3.479">wanted to point</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="6.359">car - the new leader of Isis is a former</text>
  <text start="536.129" dur="5.491">officer in Saddam Hussein&amp;#39;s army hmm and</text>
  <text start="539.519" dur="5.701">he grew very close to Baghdad II when</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="5.13">they were both jailed in Basra by United</text>
  <text start="545.22" dur="4.95">States forces for their links to</text>
  <text start="546.75" dur="5.699">al-qaeda in 2003 it was in that Iraqi</text>
  <text start="550.17" dur="4.14">prison that Baghdad he became a jihadist</text>
  <text start="552.449" dur="3.57">demagogue converting hundreds of</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="4.829">prisoners to sick visions so-called</text>
  <text start="556.019" dur="5.19">caliphate now of course we know that</text>
  <text start="559.139" dur="3.99">imprisoning them and some of the things</text>
  <text start="561.209" dur="3.841">that happen probably did rattle</text>
  <text start="563.129" dur="3.45">radicalize a lot of these people but you</text>
  <text start="565.05" dur="3.12">got to ask yourself how are all these</text>
  <text start="566.579" dur="3.12">people who we are but who we had</text>
  <text start="568.17" dur="3.479">previously arrested and we&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="569.699" dur="4.26">for these crimes</text>
  <text start="571.649" dur="7.651">you know allegedly involved with things</text>
