  <text start="124.88" dur="4.42">now I want to jump right into this and</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="3.96">just talk about what each of your</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="3.99">individual roles were surrounding the</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="2.43">command structure in the events that</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="5.88">took place</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="7.41">on September 11 2012 in Benghazi my job</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="4.17">was the noncommissioned officer in</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="4.44">charge of the early warnings and</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="6.57">indications for or the watched war at</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="7.86">CENTCOM my responsibilities in the</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="6.6">Africa Mayo Sea were combat reports</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="7.41">within the combat operations floor there</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="6.15">and my job was to keep track of all of</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="4.44">the assets that where they were at any</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="5.06">given time so that a general officer</text>
  <text start="165.33" dur="5.55">would have that information</text>
  <text start="167.72" dur="5.73">sure overall I was a intelligence</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="5.22">analyst for the the member of the</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="6.82">Intelligence Surveillance reconnaissance</text>
  <text start="176.1" dur="7.83">division specifically working the watch</text>
  <text start="180.27" dur="6.57">desk for the AOC at that time so we were</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="6.03">farmed out essentially to the combat ops</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="4.11">floor as the highest rd representatives</text>
  <text start="189.96" dur="1.98">worked in a place called the</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="3.84">Intelligence Surveillance reconnaissance</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="6.53">so it was essentially a compartment on a</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="7.89">compartmented area on the office floor</text>
  <text start="198.47" dur="7.45">okay so obviously each of you individual</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="5.25">Minh had a very unique perspective for</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="5.16">the events that took place that day and</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="6.21">obviously you all were there when this</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="5.28">all happened the timeline itself is is</text>
  <text start="214.14" dur="4.59">very important to understanding what</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="4.08">happened that day and with that in mind</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="3.51">I want to I want to go into this next</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="4.56">question so for each of you individually</text>
  <text start="222.24" dur="4.89">can kind of walk us through when did you</text>
  <text start="225" dur="4.05">all figure out that you know ambassador</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="4.02">Stevens had went and activated his</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="4.8">personal distress button and it was</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="4.44">calling for you know help you know in</text>
  <text start="233.85" dur="3.72">indicating that the embassy was being</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="3.93">overrun by attackers could could could</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="5.34">you go ahead and start there sergeant</text>
  <text start="239.52" dur="5.61">hotel yes um the first thing I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="4.58">do is just back it up for one minute so</text>
  <text start="245.13" dur="4.71">everybody understands what my role was</text>
  <text start="247.49" dur="3.37">when I was dealing with the watch before</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="4.08">at CENTCOM</text>
  <text start="250.86" dur="5.189">we were also tasked to support Africa at</text>
  <text start="253.92" dur="4.8">that time AFRICOM didn&amp;#39;t have a formal</text>
  <text start="256.049" dur="4.44">command structure set up so we were</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="4.14">doing all their intelligence works we</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="5.9">were also doing intelligence for NATO</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="5.299">for five months prior to the attacks</text>
  <text start="266.389" dur="4.471">and as far as your question goes when</text>
  <text start="268.159" dur="5.28">you lead up to the date of the attack we</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="4.489">knew in less than 30 minutes that there</text>
  <text start="273.439" dur="6.391">was an attack happening at the annex and</text>
  <text start="275.349" dur="7.57">in Benghazi Libya is the actual embassy</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="5.73">itself in Tripoli so we started to try</text>
  <text start="282.919" dur="5.671">to formulate what was happening and</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="5.069">ascertain that evening at CENTCOM we</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="4.729">were wouldn&amp;#39;t involved with a training</text>
  <text start="290.629" dur="5.34">exercise called internal look 12:00 and</text>
  <text start="293.319" dur="5.051">we were told to not deal with that</text>
  <text start="295.969" dur="4.651">because the training exercise what we</text>
  <text start="298.37" dur="3.87">had to focus on we were told the State</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="4.169">Department had things that were going on</text>
  <text start="302.24" dur="6.419">simultaneously when that attack occurred</text>
  <text start="304.789" dur="7.68">in Benghazi Libya our embassy in Cairo</text>
  <text start="308.659" dur="5.611">Egypt was also overrun by about 2,500</text>
  <text start="312.469" dur="4.41">local nationals according to reports we</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="3.929">read and we were not allowed to engage</text>
  <text start="316.879" dur="3.15">with that we were told the State</text>
  <text start="318.199" dur="3.541">Department was giving the Morsi</text>
  <text start="320.029" dur="5.551">government the opportunity to regain</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="5.429">control in Cairo Egypt and in Benghazi</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="4.619">we were told that the State Department</text>
  <text start="327.169" dur="4.381">had things in hand throughout the night</text>
  <text start="330.199" dur="4.051">we were not allowed to stop this</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="4.889">training exercise whatsoever and we had</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="3.539">all the intelligence information we had</text>
  <text start="336.439" dur="3.961">the human intelligence the signals</text>
  <text start="337.789" dur="5.28">intelligence mazen we also had further</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="4.829">intelligence from our NATO allies and in</text>
  <text start="343.069" dur="3.78">addition to that we also had what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.229" dur="3.84">called the geek system global command</text>
  <text start="346.849" dur="4.32">control system which deals with we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="349.069" dur="4.741">you know friendly and enemy assets are</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="4.891">and we&amp;#39;re neutrals are so we had all of</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="4.56">that available we had assets available</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="4.979">descent and we were not allowed to do</text>
  <text start="358.37" dur="4.289">that from CENTCOM and for the rest of</text>
  <text start="361.039" dur="3.331">the stuff I&amp;#39;ll let Nick know go ahead</text>
  <text start="362.659" dur="8.03">and speak and then Josh talked about</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="9.96">their perspectives hello this is Nick</text>
  <text start="370.689" dur="7.271">hello and so whenever this was all</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="7.5">happening as sergeant kotel said we were</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="6.569">very new we had merged AFRICOM and you</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="6.299">come together into the 6o third Air and</text>
  <text start="384.529" dur="6.81">Space Operations Center and at the time</text>
  <text start="388.129" dur="4.65">of the attacks there my job as I said</text>
  <text start="391.339" dur="4.56">before was to know where all the assets</text>
  <text start="392.779" dur="6.451">where we had we had assets from from you</text>
  <text start="395.899" dur="6.721">come and AFRICOM that at our disposal</text>
  <text start="399.23" dur="4.98">and one of the issues that I had with</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="3.9">everything that happened was that we had</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="5.16">a rescue team that was available a pair</text>
  <text start="406.52" dur="6.03">rescue team that is an Air Force special</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="5.88">forces unit and their job is exactly for</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="5.75">these situations to fly in parachute in</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="6.3">and then set up a perimeter and/or</text>
  <text start="418.3" dur="4.84">rescue the people there all right so we</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="4.44">had them at our disposal and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.14" dur="6.09">ready to go 24 hours a day seven days a</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="4.83">week and if there&amp;#39;s any sort of issue we</text>
  <text start="429.23" dur="5.52">would know if we would have known about</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="5.76">that right away and everything was good</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="3.99">to go so there&amp;#39;s no reason that they</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="5.43">could not have been used he also had</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="5.91">assets we had fire jets in Aviano we had</text>
  <text start="442.01" dur="4.62">fighter jets in Lakenheath and in</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="4.83">according to the timeline as you I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="6.3">sure know and your listeners know there</text>
  <text start="449.48" dur="7.08">was plenty of time to get those jets up</text>
  <text start="452.93" dur="6.99">in the air and over there and also we</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="5.1">had tankers everywhere they were always</text>
  <text start="459.92" dur="3.81">flying missions and we could have just</text>
  <text start="461.66" dur="5.16">died verted them for those people as</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="7.38">well and then on top of those assets we</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="9.06">also had we also had access to our pas</text>
  <text start="471.11" dur="7.92">or drones is the term most people might</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="5.19">know and we had them littered over</text>
  <text start="479.03" dur="4.89">Africa and especially northern Africa</text>
  <text start="481.07" dur="5.94">and especially around that area we had</text>
  <text start="483.92" dur="5.19">drones that were armed and unarmed and</text>
  <text start="487.01" dur="4.23">so if anybody tried to make the excuse</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="4.62">that there was nobody there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="5.07">that could have been done from our</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="8.22">remotely piloted aircraft that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="8.01">true and on top of that you know we had</text>
  <text start="501.95" dur="6.24">other assets as well typically there</text>
  <text start="504.32" dur="7.23">would be a Navy asset sitting out there</text>
  <text start="508.19" dur="6.81">in the Med and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="5.16">story too so I mean interestingly enough</text>
  <text start="515" dur="4.02">when you read through the official</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="4.74">timeline that&amp;#39;s provided by the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="4.23">there is kind of this it feels like</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re saying there was only two marine</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="4.35">fast teams that were in Spain who were</text>
  <text start="525.77" dur="4.29">able to respond who were activated for</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="5.16">this but it sounds like to me from what</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re saying there was a whole lot</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="4.38">a whole lot of other assets that could</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="5.76">have been deployed immediately I mean</text>
  <text start="537.14" dur="5.51">that seems to be the what I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="539.84" dur="6.02">from this that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="542.65" dur="6.07">hmm hey Josh excuse me one second Josh</text>
  <text start="545.86" dur="5.32">yeah hey why don&amp;#39;t you explain what you</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="4.35">were seeing from your perspective while</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="7.85">the attacks were going on like in the</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="8.46">initial attack base okay so um initially</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="4.99">well how it works up in our in the watch</text>
  <text start="561.53" dur="4.38">desk area we got two representatives</text>
  <text start="564.02" dur="4.62">from the is our D one is generally</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="7.26">tracking all the flights that are going</text>
  <text start="568.64" dur="6.57">on at the time will be going on through</text>
  <text start="573.17" dur="3.9">our subordinate units not all over the</text>
  <text start="575.21" dur="4.71">place throughout Yukon AFRICOM and the</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="4.44">other one is basically keeping up on all</text>
  <text start="579.92" dur="3.78">of the what they call Merc traffic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="4.2">essentially a whole lot of chat rooms of</text>
  <text start="583.7" dur="3.78">current intelligence information coming</text>
  <text start="585.71" dur="6.32">through on both of our areas of</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="7.35">operation or areas of responsibility and</text>
  <text start="592.03" dur="4.03">we hadn&amp;#39;t been briefed myself and my</text>
  <text start="594.83" dur="3.75">counterpart nah don&amp;#39;t know if it was a</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="4.56">day off type of thing or just you know</text>
  <text start="598.58" dur="3.21">hadn&amp;#39;t gotten an email for it but anyway</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="4.77">we were caught off guard when the</text>
  <text start="601.79" dur="6.9">initial what initially started happening</text>
  <text start="605.39" dur="6.12">and got a call from one of the entities</text>
  <text start="608.69" dur="4.47">that we normally work with like we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="611.51" dur="5.52">constant communication usually with</text>
  <text start="613.16" dur="6.84">various intelligence outfits from around</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="4.8">the you know around you come and AFRICOM</text>
  <text start="620" dur="3.78">doing you know conference calls on a</text>
  <text start="621.83" dur="4.53">daily basis and sharing information well</text>
  <text start="623.78" dur="4.92">I&amp;#39;d received a phone call asking if we</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="4.32">were seeing what was going on and the</text>
  <text start="628.7" dur="3.66">exact time</text>
  <text start="630.68" dur="4.98">escapes me I tried to get over with my</text>
  <text start="632.36" dur="5.25">counterpart but he&amp;#39;s still in so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="3.77">think he really wants to get into or</text>
  <text start="637.61" dur="5.4">just doesn&amp;#39;t remember but in any event</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="5.71">we hadn&amp;#39;t been seen what was going on so</text>
  <text start="643.01" dur="4.71">at that time I tried to get a timeline</text>
  <text start="645.14" dur="7.65">of all the you know the events up to</text>
  <text start="647.72" dur="7.5">that point of what was going on to relay</text>
  <text start="652.79" dur="4.55">to the chief of combat operations who is</text>
  <text start="655.22" dur="4.2">technically who are responsible too</text>
  <text start="657.34" dur="5.56">especially on a night shift now normally</text>
  <text start="659.42" dur="5.58">our is Rd folks are you know typical 8 2</text>
  <text start="662.9" dur="3.84">4 8 4:30 so they&amp;#39;re not around at night</text>
  <text start="665" dur="4.47">the night shifts only up the watch</text>
  <text start="666.74" dur="4.89">desk so we really relay all the</text>
  <text start="669.47" dur="3.51">information to the chief of combat ops</text>
  <text start="671.63" dur="4.44">to make a decision whether they call</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="6.03">somebody in take some sort of action in</text>
  <text start="676.07" dur="7.019">addition to relaying the information to</text>
  <text start="679.01" dur="7.05">our other entities that we worked with</text>
  <text start="683.089" dur="5.31">around the area intelligence wise you</text>
  <text start="686.06" dur="4.71">know US Air Force&amp;#39;s Europe so on and so</text>
  <text start="688.399" dur="3.421">forth on addition to our elinoz that are</text>
  <text start="690.77" dur="2.819">out on the floor that could have made</text>
  <text start="691.82" dur="4.47">any moves or spoke to whatever</text>
  <text start="693.589" dur="4.201">higher-ups they needed to so gathering</text>
  <text start="696.29" dur="2.94">all the information my counterpart was</text>
  <text start="697.79" dur="4.95">still tracking all the flights that were</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="6.95">going on and got a good timeline of</text>
  <text start="702.74" dur="6.51">events that had taken place and</text>
  <text start="706.18" dur="5.349">basically gave the information to be</text>
  <text start="709.25" dur="5.25">chief of combat ops and essentially</text>
  <text start="711.529" dur="5.401">we&amp;#39;re told that we couldn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="714.5" dur="5.279">from there so that not to call anybody</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="6.57">in now I don&amp;#39;t know if that was an</text>
  <text start="719.779" dur="5.941">experience as this you know acting CCO</text>
  <text start="723.5" dur="4.529">at the time because sometimes you got</text>
  <text start="725.72" dur="3.03">arguments he&amp;#39;s in but regardless likely</text>
  <text start="728.029" dur="2.791">should have known</text>
  <text start="728.75" dur="3.57">you know the protocol when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.82" dur="4.32">dealing with you know American lives on</text>
  <text start="732.32" dur="6.15">the line like that excuse me but in any</text>
  <text start="735.14" dur="5.04">event we were basically you know sitting</text>
  <text start="738.47" dur="3.3">on her hands not able to really do</text>
  <text start="740.18" dur="5.219">anything but still gave the information</text>
  <text start="741.77" dur="5.97">to our the elinoz as appropriate got the</text>
  <text start="745.399" dur="4.231">information out there now I know that at</text>
  <text start="747.74" dur="4.26">least the safety folks had called a</text>
  <text start="749.63" dur="5.1">couple of bird Colonels in and I was on</text>
  <text start="752" dur="5.43">you know conference calls with them and</text>
  <text start="754.73" dur="4.32">various other agencies to you know</text>
  <text start="757.43" dur="4.469">explain the information that I had in</text>
  <text start="759.05" dur="4.26">addition to getting further information</text>
  <text start="761.899" dur="5.071">from the folks that had called us up now</text>
  <text start="763.31" dur="5.16">the exact agency they called it escapes</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="3.45">me now I thought it was 6-week but I</text>
  <text start="768.47" dur="3.54">could be wrong on that we dealt with a</text>
  <text start="770.42" dur="3.99">whole slew of them and it was kind of a</text>
  <text start="772.01" dur="3.84">busy time at the moment so in the</text>
  <text start="774.41" dur="3.27">meantime were just kind of sitting on</text>
  <text start="775.85" dur="6.32">her hand still monitoring the entire</text>
  <text start="777.68" dur="8.25">situation and then in the morning when</text>
  <text start="782.17" dur="5.26">the basically chief of ISR comes in with</text>
  <text start="785.93" dur="3.09">his entourage we give him a brief over</text>
  <text start="787.43" dur="4.8">the previous 12 hours of what happened</text>
  <text start="789.02" dur="4.74">flights wise and he issues intelligence</text>
  <text start="792.23" dur="4.89">wise anything going on so we had the</text>
  <text start="793.76" dur="6.39">whole the Holy Spirit give him on the</text>
  <text start="797.12" dur="3.529">entire event as it was going on as I had</text>
  <text start="800.15" dur="3.71">record</text>
  <text start="800.649" dur="4.951">and my counterpart had his from you know</text>
  <text start="803.86" dur="4.199">his end of things that evening as well</text>
  <text start="805.6" dur="3.929">and our chief of ISR was none too happy</text>
  <text start="808.059" dur="4.2">in the morning when he came in and</text>
  <text start="809.529" dur="4.68">realized that nobody had called anybody</text>
  <text start="812.259" dur="6.99">in I mean at the direction of the chief</text>
  <text start="814.209" dur="7.081">of combat ops at the time and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="819.249" dur="4.26">necessarily upset with us but at the</text>
  <text start="821.29" dur="3.959">situation that a decision was made to</text>
  <text start="823.509" dur="3.841">call them and so kind of wondered</text>
  <text start="825.249" dur="3.661">whether we should have just jumped over</text>
  <text start="827.35" dur="3.239">the directive not to call anybody</text>
  <text start="828.91" dur="3.989">because ultimately when we work for the</text>
  <text start="830.589" dur="3.72">is our D that&amp;#39;s our boss but at night</text>
  <text start="832.899" dur="3.571">when were on the ops floor in that</text>
  <text start="834.309" dur="4.741">position it&amp;#39;s the chief of combat ops</text>
  <text start="836.47" dur="5.279">because our chief of ISR in the morning</text>
  <text start="839.05" dur="5.819">when we were briefing him or when I was</text>
  <text start="841.749" dur="4.741">briefing him specifically mentioned that</text>
  <text start="844.869" dur="4.32">we could have surged assets because as</text>
  <text start="846.49" dur="5.73">Nick said between AFRICOM and you come</text>
  <text start="849.189" dur="5.01">just RPAs alone I mean we have flights</text>
  <text start="852.22" dur="4.679">going on all the time</text>
  <text start="854.199" dur="5.01">night day around the clock we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="856.899" dur="4.68">flights that are either you know ongoing</text>
  <text start="859.209" dur="4.98">going to be going on stuff that you can</text>
  <text start="861.579" dur="5.041">bring back and take off again I mean</text>
  <text start="864.189" dur="5.281">there&amp;#39;s a multitude of you know assets</text>
  <text start="866.62" dur="5.339">around and not just the stuff that we</text>
  <text start="869.47" dur="4.979">briefed directly to the floor in the</text>
  <text start="871.959" dur="4.98">morning as well but you know you know</text>
  <text start="874.449" dur="4.23">looking at bed downs from the ice arc</text>
  <text start="876.939" dur="5.041">itself that we usually get on a daily</text>
  <text start="878.679" dur="7.35">basis just it would show all of the</text>
  <text start="881.98" dur="5.579">assets now whether it was stuff that you</text>
  <text start="886.029" dur="4.021">know directly AFRICOM and you come</text>
  <text start="887.559" dur="4.44">controlled or you know even Special</text>
  <text start="890.05" dur="3.57">Operations type stuff that you know some</text>
  <text start="891.999" dur="3.9">stuff we wouldn&amp;#39;t even you know be shown</text>
  <text start="893.62" dur="4.05">to the floor in a daily basis in</text>
  <text start="895.899" dur="4.5">addition to the tasking orders and the</text>
  <text start="897.67" dur="4.8">airspace control it paints a pretty good</text>
  <text start="900.399" dur="4.23">picture of exactly where it was that we</text>
  <text start="902.47" dur="5.969">could have searched assets from or</text>
  <text start="904.629" dur="6.3">taking them off from easy enough Wow so</text>
  <text start="908.439" dur="4.411">everybody seems to have known this was</text>
  <text start="910.929" dur="4.801">happening it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like much</text>
  <text start="912.85" dur="5.219">action was taking place so you know what</text>
  <text start="915.73" dur="3.99">do you guys think what do you think do</text>
  <text start="918.069" dur="4.62">you think it&amp;#39;s because the information</text>
  <text start="919.72" dur="7.469">wasn&amp;#39;t being moved along that you&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="922.689" dur="6.45">know chief combat ops you know commander</text>
  <text start="927.189" dur="3.931">didn&amp;#39;t make that decision or do you</text>
  <text start="929.139" dur="3.911">think it&amp;#39;s just it was it was from the</text>
  <text start="931.12" dur="4.81">top down</text>
  <text start="933.05" dur="5.85">let me let me explain this to you one</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="5.88">thing that Josh may not know about but</text>
  <text start="938.9" dur="4.83">we have a the commander about any</text>
  <text start="941.81" dur="4.53">operational group work or talk a</text>
  <text start="943.73" dur="5.78">Tactical Operations Center has a book</text>
  <text start="946.34" dur="6.54">and as a manual to go by when there is a</text>
  <text start="949.51" dur="5.35">serious incident or you know a sitrep a</text>
  <text start="952.88" dur="4.65">situational report that involves</text>
  <text start="954.86" dur="5.42">casualties loss of life or direct</text>
  <text start="957.53" dur="5.43">attacks they trigger what&amp;#39;s known as a</text>
  <text start="960.28" dur="3.67">commander&amp;#39;s critical intent requirement</text>
  <text start="962.96" dur="3.42">or CCIR</text>
  <text start="963.95" dur="4.35">when that is triggered everybody is</text>
  <text start="966.38" dur="4.74">called in because it&amp;#39;s that big of an</text>
  <text start="968.3" dur="4.56">event so we go by a checklist just like</text>
  <text start="971.12" dur="4.5">ambassador Stevens and me and the</text>
  <text start="972.86" dur="5.34">embassy goes by Department of State</text>
  <text start="975.62" dur="4.74">checklist so when there&amp;#39;s a significant</text>
  <text start="978.2" dur="3.45">amount of threats key personnel like the</text>
  <text start="980.36" dur="3.42">ambassador and everybody should have</text>
  <text start="981.65" dur="4.89">been pulled and additional security</text>
  <text start="983.78" dur="5.4">should have been provided so everybody</text>
  <text start="986.54" dur="4.41">that was involved at the command level</text>
  <text start="989.18" dur="4.17">would have had to call in their higher</text>
  <text start="990.95" dur="4.2">bosses automatically the fact that josh</text>
  <text start="993.35" dur="4.26">is telling you that that commander chose</text>
  <text start="995.15" dur="4.44">not to is not a good answer that that</text>
  <text start="997.61" dur="4.44">he&amp;#39;s disobeying a lawful order by</text>
  <text start="999.59" dur="4.35">failing to do that and in Josh&amp;#39;s level</text>
  <text start="1002.05" dur="3.54">he wasn&amp;#39;t able to affect that because he</text>
  <text start="1003.94" dur="4.26">posted it to the commander that was on</text>
  <text start="1005.59" dur="4.5">duty at that time so I hope that kind of</text>
  <text start="1008.2" dur="6.06">clears up a little bit of the confusion</text>
  <text start="1010.09" dur="6.54">yeah absolutely I mean so by making that</text>
  <text start="1014.26" dur="4.23">decision what do you think the</text>
  <text start="1016.63" dur="3.39">motivation was just did they not</text>
  <text start="1018.49" dur="3.36">understand the severity of what was</text>
  <text start="1020.02" dur="5.58">happening or do you think there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1021.85" dur="5.85">an intentional effort to you know to not</text>
  <text start="1025.6" dur="3.63">follow a lawful order and to not pass</text>
  <text start="1027.7" dur="4.55">that information along to the people who</text>
  <text start="1029.23" dur="3.02">could actually affect change</text>
  <text start="1032.949" dur="7.771">honestly I&amp;#39;m quite good no no you go</text>
  <text start="1038.12" dur="4.86">right ahead you give your perspective I</text>
  <text start="1040.72" dur="4.359">honestly don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ve thought about</text>
  <text start="1042.98" dur="4.67">that you know multiple times and try to</text>
  <text start="1045.079" dur="5.461">look at it from different angles like</text>
  <text start="1047.65" dur="7.33">not a know if it was his inexperience</text>
  <text start="1050.54" dur="6.93">out or he didn&amp;#39;t know or you know what</text>
  <text start="1054.98" dur="4.14">what to do in that situation because a</text>
  <text start="1057.47" dur="4.05">lot of times the nightshift guys is seen</text>
  <text start="1059.12" dur="4.55">I mean they had their stuff together but</text>
  <text start="1061.52" dur="4.23">it was kind of like nothing major really</text>
  <text start="1063.67" dur="3.37">happened that often so maybe they</text>
  <text start="1065.75" dur="2.82">weren&amp;#39;t put into position where they had</text>
  <text start="1067.04" dur="2.88">to know you know once something was</text>
  <text start="1068.57" dur="2.85">triggered but to go down a checklist</text>
  <text start="1069.92" dur="3.87">even though it&amp;#39;s kind of an important</text>
  <text start="1071.42" dur="4.23">thing maybe it was just an oversight</text>
  <text start="1073.79" dur="3.06">I got tried to look at it and give him</text>
  <text start="1075.65" dur="3.62">the benefit of the doubt from a lot of</text>
  <text start="1076.85" dur="5.58">different angles or whether it was just</text>
  <text start="1079.27" dur="5.38">something that we weren&amp;#39;t apprised of as</text>
  <text start="1082.43" dur="5.31">far as calling people in but it kind of</text>
  <text start="1084.65" dur="5.25">contradicts what our chief of ISR had</text>
  <text start="1087.74" dur="3.99">mentioned from you know the leader of</text>
  <text start="1089.9" dur="4.83">our particular division that we were</text>
  <text start="1091.73" dur="5.01">farmed out from when he came in and was</text>
  <text start="1094.73" dur="3.45">you know upset about that that one</text>
  <text start="1096.74" dur="4.92">decision was made not to call and</text>
  <text start="1098.18" dur="5.91">basically our direct you know higher-ups</text>
  <text start="1101.66" dur="4.14">that we worked for because we were</text>
  <text start="1104.09" dur="3.24">farmed out to the combat ops floor and</text>
  <text start="1105.8" dur="5.46">that decision was made so I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="1107.33" dur="6.09">I it&amp;#39;s hard to I don&amp;#39;t know stomach I</text>
  <text start="1111.26" dur="5.9">guess that there was a decision directly</text>
  <text start="1113.42" dur="5.97">made to just sit there not do anything</text>
  <text start="1117.16" dur="3.61">but I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m trying to look at</text>
  <text start="1119.39" dur="3.15">it from a bunch of different angles I</text>
  <text start="1120.77" dur="3.68">can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t really see how the</text>
  <text start="1122.54" dur="4.05">decisions just to do nothing</text>
  <text start="1124.45" dur="4.42">you know maybe didn&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="1126.59" dur="5.22">severity even though the outline that we</text>
  <text start="1128.87" dur="6.15">gave him in the timeline I mean directly</text>
  <text start="1131.81" dur="5.37">depicted the exact you know to the time</text>
  <text start="1135.02" dur="4.65">of events that was going on so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1137.18" dur="5.13">really sure we didn&amp;#39;t really understand</text>
  <text start="1139.67" dur="6.12">that you know there&amp;#39;s a serious deal</text>
  <text start="1142.31" dur="5.85">going on at that moment but or just</text>
  <text start="1145.79" dur="4.35">didn&amp;#39;t know the assets we had available</text>
  <text start="1148.16" dur="4.59">which is seems kind of wild to me</text>
  <text start="1150.14" dur="4.02">because we were the weapons system the</text>
  <text start="1152.75" dur="5.43">Operations Center for the you know for</text>
  <text start="1154.16" dur="5.97">the area so yeah I&amp;#39;m still not sure what</text>
  <text start="1158.18" dur="4.41">what the mindset was there where where</text>
  <text start="1160.13" dur="5.279">that decision came from honestly</text>
  <text start="1162.59" dur="4.829">but keep in mind Craig they get to</text>
  <text start="1165.409" dur="4.531">understand that that was one small</text>
  <text start="1167.419" dur="4.89">element one little command where</text>
  <text start="1169.94" dur="4.53">multiple commands were aware of this I</text>
  <text start="1172.309" dur="4.71">mean the Marines had shipped right off</text>
  <text start="1174.47" dur="5.01">the coast in that area with assets to</text>
  <text start="1177.019" dur="4.98">move and they also didn&amp;#39;t react either</text>
  <text start="1179.48" dur="4.019">according to them at some time we were</text>
  <text start="1181.999" dur="4.38">still continuing this training exercise</text>
  <text start="1183.499" dur="5.55">and a lot of other assets weren&amp;#39;t being</text>
  <text start="1186.379" dur="4.711">utilized we even got requests from NATO</text>
  <text start="1189.049" dur="3.901">allies that were on the ground to assist</text>
  <text start="1191.09" dur="4.5">we were told the State Department turn</text>
  <text start="1192.95" dur="4.979">those down so this is not you know where</text>
  <text start="1195.59" dur="4.89">Joshin and Nick we&amp;#39;re sitting is one</text>
  <text start="1197.929" dur="5.22">small little command post it wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1200.48" dur="4.199">main one but the rest of the world all</text>
  <text start="1203.149" dur="3.301">through the military channels was</text>
  <text start="1204.679" dur="3.48">receiving this imagery was receiving</text>
  <text start="1206.45" dur="4.079">this information about the attacks and</text>
  <text start="1208.159" dur="6.75">had a lot of opportunity to move forward</text>
  <text start="1210.529" dur="5.88">and execute so yeah what that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1214.909" dur="3.331">perfect clarification I guess we&amp;#39;ll kind</text>
  <text start="1216.409" dur="4.49">of pivot back to the facts surrounding</text>
  <text start="1218.24" dur="5.279">Benghazi i I have this quote from a</text>
  <text start="1220.899" dur="4.691">senior US defense official unnamed</text>
  <text start="1223.519" dur="4.65">obviously they always provide these</text>
  <text start="1225.59" dur="4.62">anonymously usually but they said quote</text>

  <text start="1238.129" dur="4.17">the response to Benghazi let me ask you</text>
  <text start="1240.529" dur="3.65">do you agree with that characterization</text>
  <text start="1242.299" dur="4.38">or do you think that&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="1244.179" dur="4.74">misstatement mischaracterization of the</text>
  <text start="1246.679" dur="4.051">way we were able to respond to that</text>
  <text start="1248.919" dur="3.911">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1250.73" dur="4.11">I don&amp;#39;t know who said that but they must</text>
  <text start="1252.83" dur="3.99">not know much about the military we</text>
  <text start="1254.84" dur="3.839">could have had forces there on target in</text>
  <text start="1256.82" dur="3.479">30 minutes or less and those armed</text>
  <text start="1258.679" dur="4.2">drones could have taken out the mortars</text>
  <text start="1260.299" dur="5.041">while they were firing within the first</text>
  <text start="1262.879" dur="4.68">few minutes we had the ability to put</text>
  <text start="1265.34" dur="4.35">people on the ground within 30 minutes</text>
  <text start="1267.559" dur="4.531">or less there is no question about that</text>
  <text start="1269.69" dur="4.29">where are their documents about that</text>
  <text start="1272.09" dur="3.839">there are facts about that without</text>
  <text start="1273.98" dur="4.559">getting into classified material I can</text>
  <text start="1275.929" dur="3.931">tell you you know posting fatica ly that</text>
  <text start="1278.539" dur="3.451">we could have had vast motor jets</text>
  <text start="1279.86" dur="4.799">helicopters folks on the ground we could</text>
  <text start="1281.99" dur="5.759">have had predators and Reapers nailing</text>
  <text start="1284.659" dur="4.89">those those mortar positions so there is</text>
  <text start="1287.749" dur="3.93">absolutely plus there was a ton of other</text>
  <text start="1289.549" dur="3.72">security that was on the ground in the</text>
  <text start="1291.679" dur="3.75">vicinity of that annex that could have</text>
  <text start="1293.269" dur="3.181">also responded and we had offers from</text>
  <text start="1295.429" dur="2.251">NATO allies</text>
  <text start="1296.45" dur="4.59">had troops on the ground that were right</text>
  <text start="1297.68" dur="5.7">there offering their assistance so you</text>
  <text start="1301.04" dur="4.17">know I don&amp;#39;t know who the fire pole guy</text>
  <text start="1303.38" dur="5.55">is but that&amp;#39;s the wrong answer</text>
  <text start="1305.21" dur="6.12">I I think that&amp;#39;s a very interesting take</text>
  <text start="1308.93" dur="6.81">on it and I tend to agree with you now</text>
  <text start="1311.33" dur="8.01">so could we talk about though did we</text>
  <text start="1315.74" dur="6.45">were we aware of the threat of the</text>
  <text start="1319.34" dur="4.98">attack did we have the previous</text>
  <text start="1322.19" dur="3.81">knowledge I mean we know that ambassador</text>
  <text start="1324.32" dur="3.93">Stevens made a request for a higher</text>
  <text start="1326" dur="4.23">security detail can you speak to that</text>
  <text start="1328.25" dur="3.39">like did we know about this terrorist</text>
  <text start="1330.23" dur="4.26">organization the group that was there</text>
  <text start="1331.64" dur="4.98">did we know about possibly them planning</text>
  <text start="1334.49" dur="6.21">an attack I mean is any of that stuff we</text>
  <text start="1336.62" dur="5.85">can talk about yes and for five months</text>
  <text start="1340.7" dur="3.9">like I said my guys on the watch board</text>
  <text start="1342.47" dur="6.03">were doing intelligence for AFRICOM and</text>
  <text start="1344.6" dur="6.45">for NATO and we did see many many many</text>
  <text start="1348.5" dur="4.47">reports for that five-month period both</text>
  <text start="1351.05" dur="4.38">from human intelligence and from signals</text>
  <text start="1352.97" dur="3.87">intelligence that came in that warned of</text>
  <text start="1355.43" dur="3.42">threats some of them were extremely</text>
  <text start="1356.84" dur="3.87">credible and that goes back to the</text>
  <text start="1358.85" dur="3.87">Department of State checklist for the</text>
  <text start="1360.71" dur="4.2">Ambassador from the regional Security</text>
  <text start="1362.72" dur="4.71">office or the RSO from the embassy gets</text>
  <text start="1364.91" dur="3.99">that checklist and says we have a</text>
  <text start="1367.43" dur="3.57">significant threat against the</text>
  <text start="1368.9" dur="4.71">Ambassador is he personnel that are US</text>
  <text start="1371" dur="5.58">personnel there to be removed from that</text>
  <text start="1373.61" dur="4.92">area or that country and insecurity is</text>
  <text start="1376.58" dur="4.08">supposed to be increased in this case</text>
  <text start="1378.53" dur="4.17">security was decreased a week before the</text>
  <text start="1380.66" dur="3.87">attacks while requests were being</text>
  <text start="1382.7" dur="3.87">ferreted to go ahead and get more</text>
  <text start="1384.53" dur="4.35">security in the Ambassador and key</text>
  <text start="1386.57" dur="5.04">personnel were still on the ground with</text>
  <text start="1388.88" dur="4.65">less security these these threats were</text>
  <text start="1391.61" dur="3.87">very significant I mean they they take</text>
  <text start="1393.53" dur="4.38">the box that said they should have been</text>
  <text start="1395.48" dur="5.58">removed two months prior to the attacks</text>
  <text start="1397.91" dur="5.22">let alone a week before and that was all</text>
  <text start="1401.06" dur="2.64">being pushed and pulled forward to</text>
  <text start="1403.13" dur="3.63">everybody</text>
  <text start="1403.7" dur="4.56">AFRICOM to NATO to the Department of</text>
  <text start="1406.76" dur="3.18">State and Amba see folks all of those</text>
  <text start="1408.26" dur="4.26">people were communicating back and forth</text>
  <text start="1409.94" dur="4.62">with us on all this intelligence data I</text>
  <text start="1412.52" dur="4.85">was going to say anything that Nick or</text>
  <text start="1414.56" dur="2.81">Josh could add to that</text>
  <text start="1417.42" dur="5.4">um from our well at least from my</text>
  <text start="1420.51" dur="3.99">perspective we&amp;#39;ll pretty much had that</text>
  <text start="1422.82" dur="3.3">all covered because I know at least from</text>
  <text start="1424.5" dur="5.25">our end sitting the watch test that</text>
  <text start="1426.12" dur="5.67">night it caught us off guard and I know</text>
  <text start="1429.75" dur="4.17">I don&amp;#39;t know like downstairs is more of</text>
  <text start="1431.79" dur="4.17">our longer-term analysis where they</text>
  <text start="1433.92" dur="5.36">might have gotten if there was any war</text>
  <text start="1435.96" dur="5.73">Nords to come down warning orders or</text>
  <text start="1439.28" dur="4.06">intelligence coming into that you know</text>
  <text start="1441.69" dur="4.26">based on our schedule that we may have</text>
  <text start="1443.34" dur="4.98">you know not seen usually we get briefed</text>
  <text start="1445.95" dur="3.45">about or at least an email or passed on</text>
  <text start="1448.32" dur="3.81">to change over we hadn&amp;#39;t received</text>
  <text start="1449.4" dur="5.37">anything so Will&amp;#39;s definitely got the</text>
  <text start="1452.13" dur="4.47">most most accurate on that because we</text>
  <text start="1454.77" dur="3.24">hadn&amp;#39;t heard anything and either most of</text>
  <text start="1456.6" dur="3.72">the folks that we were calling at least</text>
  <text start="1458.01" dur="4.23">in the you common what we had for you</text>
  <text start="1460.32" dur="4.62">know AFRICOM for the folks that we dealt</text>
  <text start="1462.24" dur="5.22">with on a daily basis didn&amp;#39;t really seem</text>
  <text start="1464.94" dur="4.5">to be in the know of what was what was</text>
  <text start="1467.46" dur="4.73">going on so we&amp;#39;re kind of scrambling to</text>
  <text start="1469.44" dur="6.12">get that all that information together</text>
  <text start="1472.19" dur="5.14">so from from my perspective it caught</text>
  <text start="1475.56" dur="3.33">myself and my counterpart off-guard now</text>
  <text start="1477.33" dur="4.29">I can&amp;#39;t speak to the folks downstairs</text>
  <text start="1478.89" dur="5.97">but or not there was like a snafu or a</text>
  <text start="1481.62" dur="7.05">pall job somewhere that we just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1484.86" dur="5.85">have the info but it was it was out</text>
  <text start="1488.67" dur="3.81">there but to us I was it was a bit of a</text>
  <text start="1490.71" dur="5.97">surprise</text>
  <text start="1492.48" dur="6.99">I&amp;#39;ve got to say I got what you know that</text>
  <text start="1496.68" dur="6.36">I heard after the fact from people who</text>
  <text start="1499.47" dur="6.96">worked downstairs as Josh described they</text>
  <text start="1503.04" dur="6.42">were very off-put by everything that</text>
  <text start="1506.43" dur="5.58">happened and they corroborated what</text>
  <text start="1509.46" dur="4.53">sergeant Kotel said but their secondhand</text>
  <text start="1512.01" dur="4.62">knowledge so we&amp;#39;re gonna stick to what I</text>
  <text start="1513.99" dur="6.24">know and I have nothing else to</text>
  <text start="1516.63" dur="5.34">contribute other than that yes I can</text>
  <text start="1520.23" dur="3.15">hand all just stuff here because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1521.97" dur="2.61">trying to get the firsthand stuff and</text>
  <text start="1523.38" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s what we haven&amp;#39;t you guys on you</text>
  <text start="1524.58" dur="5.19">guys are given really really great you</text>
  <text start="1527.16" dur="5.01">know in-depth perspectives on what this</text>
  <text start="1529.77" dur="5.13">it all means what do you guys say to</text>
  <text start="1532.17" dur="5.01">this hold push now I was having this</text>
  <text start="1534.9" dur="5.16">conversation earlier with somebody about</text>
  <text start="1537.18" dur="5.64">the fact that it seems Benghazi is</text>
  <text start="1540.06" dur="4.5">coming back into the picture now where</text>
  <text start="1542.82" dur="5.16">you have people like Susan Rice going</text>
  <text start="1544.56" dur="4.68">out and you know saying that that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1547.98" dur="3.3">all political</text>
  <text start="1549.24" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s all about politicize politicizing</text>
  <text start="1551.28" dur="5.37">it and that you know there really is no</text>
  <text start="1554.1" dur="4.44">there there what do you guys have to say</text>
  <text start="1556.65" dur="3.33">to that and I just want to get your</text>
  <text start="1558.54" dur="3.54">opinion cuz you guys were involved</text>
  <text start="1559.98" dur="5.31">directly and I want to hear your take on</text>
  <text start="1562.08" dur="4.86">what you know is coming out lately but</text>
  <text start="1565.29" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;d like to speak on that but I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="1566.94" dur="4.95">to back up a little bit so you know the</text>
  <text start="1568.92" dur="5.25">timeline of what Nick Josh and myself</text>
  <text start="1571.89" dur="4.83">did separately before we ever knew each</text>
  <text start="1574.17" dur="6.9">other you know back in 2014</text>
  <text start="1576.72" dur="8.1">I provided a road map to the Benghazi</text>
  <text start="1581.07" dur="5.76">committee led by trey Gowdy to get the</text>
  <text start="1584.82" dur="4.83">facts and the evidence that they needed</text>
  <text start="1586.83" dur="7.17">to put a case up about what happened at</text>
  <text start="1589.65" dur="6.15">Benghazi and I was flat-out denied to</text>
  <text start="1594" dur="3.69">provide the information I even went to</text>
  <text start="1595.8" dur="4.41">the Democratic side and I got laughed at</text>
  <text start="1597.69" dur="5.52">I went to other congressmen and Senators</text>
  <text start="1600.21" dur="4.71">I went to FBI Department of Defense IG I</text>
  <text start="1603.21" dur="4.8">went to a lot of different places and</text>
  <text start="1604.92" dur="4.71">nobody cared about the information the</text>
  <text start="1608.01" dur="3.3">only thing I got back was that in one</text>
  <text start="1609.63" dur="3.66">Hillary Clinton elected office and</text>
  <text start="1611.31" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s not acceptable because they</text>
  <text start="1613.29" dur="4.68">didn&amp;#39;t use any facts or evidence to</text>
  <text start="1615.93" dur="4.71">support who should have been held</text>
  <text start="1617.97" dur="4.86">accountable and why that gauzy even</text>
  <text start="1620.64" dur="3.69">happened in the first place whether the</text>
  <text start="1622.83" dur="3.39">attacks took place or not there was</text>
  <text start="1624.33" dur="4.17">nobody there to rescue them we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1626.22" dur="4.92">of our people behind and another point</text>
  <text start="1628.5" dur="4.35">that I have to make is after that you</text>
  <text start="1631.14" dur="5.669">have a lot of what I would call the</text>
  <text start="1632.85" dur="5.61">story time or fairy tales and there are</text>
  <text start="1636.809" dur="3.48">people that came out with all kinds of</text>
  <text start="1638.46" dur="4.32">outlandish accusations and</text>
  <text start="1640.289" dur="5.671">uncorroborated unsubstantiated stories</text>
  <text start="1642.78" dur="5.07">and you know that didn&amp;#39;t help the whole</text>
  <text start="1645.96" dur="4.11">Benghazi situation for the Fallen</text>
  <text start="1647.85" dur="4.23">families you know the gold star family</text>
  <text start="1650.07" dur="4.26">members that are left and it didn&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="1652.08" dur="5.219">any closer to anybody and they held no</text>
  <text start="1654.33" dur="4.89">one accountable and for example there is</text>
  <text start="1657.299" dur="3.601">no rain involved with this Iran had</text>
  <text start="1659.22" dur="3.87">nothing to do with the stack not as far</text>
  <text start="1660.9" dur="4.08">as I know or anyone else knows Iran had</text>
  <text start="1663.09" dur="3.92">nothing to do with it and that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="1664.98" dur="5.1">the stories being proffered out there</text>
  <text start="1667.01" dur="6.1">back then so if we come to today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="1670.08" dur="6.3">and to go back to your question you</text>
  <text start="1673.11" dur="6.059">asked what is the relevancy of Benghazi</text>
  <text start="1676.38" dur="4.919">now and the relevancy is that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1679.169" dur="4.351">pushing this narrative now for seven to</text>
  <text start="1681.299" dur="5.25">eight months on different media venues</text>
  <text start="1683.52" dur="5.72">all of a sudden Judicial Watch comes out</text>
  <text start="1686.549" dur="5.401">with hidden emails and hidden</text>
  <text start="1689.24" dur="5.29">information that brings to the forefront</text>
  <text start="1691.95" dur="5.07">more knowledge about what really</text>
  <text start="1694.53" dur="4.86">happened at Benghazi and you have a lot</text>
  <text start="1697.02" dur="4.05">of retired senior officers that were in</text>
  <text start="1699.39" dur="4.32">the military talking flag officers</text>
  <text start="1701.07" dur="4.53">generals and admirals that were very</text>
  <text start="1703.71" dur="5.16">intent on getting the information out</text>
  <text start="1705.6" dur="4.92">and getting this this resolved for the</text>
  <text start="1708.87" dur="3.15">aftermath because you know during the</text>
  <text start="1710.52" dur="3.3">evening those that could do something</text>
  <text start="1712.02" dur="3.57">made their attempts and they were</text>
  <text start="1713.82" dur="3.96">basically shut down if they weren&amp;#39;t shut</text>
  <text start="1715.59" dur="4.68">down they were threatened or they were</text>
  <text start="1717.78" dur="4.29">told they would lose rank and then later</text>
  <text start="1720.27" dur="4.17">on when we tried to do the right thing</text>
  <text start="1722.07" dur="5.219">and bring it to the forefront in 2014</text>
  <text start="1724.44" dur="5.91">and 15 and even 16 the information was</text>
  <text start="1727.289" dur="4.62">blown off and now it&amp;#39;s 2019 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1730.35" dur="4.29">coming back to that because a lot of</text>
  <text start="1731.909" dur="4.861">people can&amp;#39;t stomach what&amp;#39;s happened I</text>
  <text start="1734.64" dur="3.84">mean we don&amp;#39;t leave our people behind it</text>
  <text start="1736.77" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t happen that way and in this</text>
  <text start="1738.48" dur="5.01">instance it did so I kind of hope that</text>
  <text start="1741.36" dur="3.54">that sort of answers some of your</text>
  <text start="1743.49" dur="3.87">question if I missed something let me</text>
  <text start="1744.9" dur="4.2">know please no I think that answers it</text>
  <text start="1747.36" dur="3.39">very well I mean what we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1749.1" dur="3.42">trying to get down to the truth and then</text>
  <text start="1750.75" dur="3.45">like you said accountability those are</text>
  <text start="1752.52" dur="3.029">two important things because I was</text>
  <text start="1754.2" dur="2.51">having this discussion again earlier</text>
  <text start="1755.549" dur="5.061">with with</text>
  <text start="1756.71" dur="6.27">maybe somebody else but you know we want</text>
  <text start="1760.61" dur="4.949">this to never happen again that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1762.98" dur="4.079">a big thing we don&amp;#39;t want this failure</text>
  <text start="1765.559" dur="3.691">in the command structure whatever</text>
  <text start="1767.059" dur="4.891">happened whoever didn&amp;#39;t make the right</text>
  <text start="1769.25" dur="5.22">call and allowed this to happen it seems</text>
  <text start="1771.95" dur="5.04">like we had every asset capability in</text>
  <text start="1774.47" dur="4.829">the world to stop it yet it was still</text>
  <text start="1776.99" dur="4.26">allowed to happen and that&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1779.299" dur="4.11">for me you know why this is important to</text>
  <text start="1781.25" dur="3.779">bring back again here and then you know</text>
  <text start="1783.409" dur="3.39">as to what we were just talking about</text>

  <text start="1792.2" dur="3.42">like trying to come forward this is it</text>
  <text start="1794" dur="3.99">with this information when you when you</text>
  <text start="1795.62" dur="4.59">go to Congress and you go to the FBI and</text>
  <text start="1797.99" dur="3.809">they just say we haven&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1800.21" dur="4.73">to do it we don&amp;#39;t anything do with it</text>
  <text start="1801.799" dur="7.711">how does that feel what is that like I</text>
  <text start="1804.94" dur="6.969">have something to say about that I right</text>
  <text start="1809.51" dur="5.43">after President Trump was elected I knew</text>
  <text start="1811.909" dur="4.861">that at that point it was probably a</text>
  <text start="1814.94" dur="5.43">safe time to come forward with the</text>
  <text start="1816.77" dur="6.629">information so I chose to go to Suzanne</text>
  <text start="1820.37" dur="5.25">Brooks or Susan Brooks on the north side</text>
  <text start="1823.399" dur="5.491">of Indianapolis that&amp;#39;s were you know I</text>
  <text start="1825.62" dur="5.52">was sane at the time and I went up there</text>
  <text start="1828.89" dur="5.009">to her office and I tried to set up a</text>
  <text start="1831.14" dur="4.98">meeting and they shoot me out of there</text>
  <text start="1833.899" dur="5.551">and they said oh they&amp;#39;ll go right to her</text>
  <text start="1836.12" dur="6.48">or whatever and then I called and then I</text>
  <text start="1839.45" dur="4.469">emailed and I left information I said I</text>
  <text start="1842.6" dur="3.12">said I have more information about</text>
  <text start="1843.919" dur="5.521">Benghazi I&amp;#39;d like to tell you about it</text>
  <text start="1845.72" dur="6.63">please contact me and some time went by</text>
  <text start="1849.44" dur="6.39">is about two weeks later is this is 2017</text>
  <text start="1852.35" dur="6.87">May time around around the same time</text>
  <text start="1855.83" dur="6.709">when Comey had been fired for trying to</text>
  <text start="1859.22" dur="5.819">start a coup against our president and</text>
  <text start="1862.539" dur="4.77">so I got a call back from a chief of</text>
  <text start="1865.039" dur="4.831">staff for chief of staff told me</text>
  <text start="1867.309" dur="4.691">initially she said she announced she</text>
  <text start="1869.87" dur="4.409">told me who she was and then she said</text>
  <text start="1872" dur="5.19">you understand you trying to contact us</text>
  <text start="1874.279" dur="5.13">about Benghazi and I said yeah and I cry</text>
  <text start="1877.19" dur="3.869">buried that I said I&amp;#39;d like to tell you</text>
  <text start="1879.409" dur="3.39">more information I&amp;#39;d like to set up a</text>
  <text start="1881.059" dur="4.171">time to talk to you and I&amp;#39;d like to talk</text>
  <text start="1882.799" dur="5.1">to you about these things and then she</text>
  <text start="1885.23" dur="5.31">said to me that investigation is over</text>
  <text start="1887.899" dur="4.621">and I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="1890.54" dur="5.07">for you to Benghazi report and she</text>
  <text start="1892.52" dur="4.56">recited the URL to the tea she knew</text>
  <text start="1895.61" dur="3.81">either she had it right in front of her</text>
  <text start="1897.08" dur="4.32">written down or she knew it by heart and</text>
  <text start="1899.42" dur="5.73">she was prepared for that time to talk</text>
  <text start="1901.4" dur="6.09">to me and she said exactly what it was</text>
  <text start="1905.15" dur="4.53">and then I a was sitting at a computer</text>
  <text start="1907.49" dur="8.28">at the time I typed it in and it came up</text>
  <text start="1909.68" dur="7.98">and she said um you know you know</text>
  <text start="1915.77" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s a report right there and</text>
  <text start="1917.66" dur="3.9">everything and I was thinking to myself</text>
  <text start="1919.04" dur="4.92">this this is kind of odd why is she not</text>
  <text start="1921.56" dur="3.83">asking me how I know what I know and</text>
  <text start="1923.96" dur="4.11">what do I know</text>
  <text start="1925.39" dur="4.06">and that would be two very important</text>
  <text start="1928.07" dur="3.54">questions where I could tell her where I</text>
  <text start="1929.45" dur="3.63">worked what I did and how I know it and</text>
  <text start="1931.61" dur="5.52">then I would even have to say all the</text>
  <text start="1933.08" dur="7.08">details over the phone and then you know</text>
  <text start="1937.13" dur="5.4">I sounded concerned and I and she said</text>
  <text start="1940.16" dur="6.87">you know anything in there you know you</text>
  <text start="1942.53" dur="7.83">can you know you all the informations in</text>
  <text start="1947.03" dur="6.21">there and and I try to express to her</text>
  <text start="1950.36" dur="5.25">that I knew more information and I know</text>
  <text start="1953.24" dur="4.35">that it&amp;#39;s not in there because obviously</text>
  <text start="1955.61" dur="4.5">somebody would be held accountable if</text>
  <text start="1957.59" dur="4.8">they had the information right and then</text>
  <text start="1960.11" dur="5.88">I didn&amp;#39;t say that to her but as I was</text>
  <text start="1962.39" dur="5.88">thinking and then she you know I</text>
  <text start="1965.99" dur="4.38">expressed my concerns that that she</text>
  <text start="1968.27" dur="4.41">didn&amp;#39;t have all the information and then</text>
  <text start="1970.37" dur="5.64">she said well you know why don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1972.68" dur="4.59">call the FBI then and then you know I</text>
  <text start="1976.01" dur="2.88">was taken aback by that</text>
  <text start="1977.27" dur="3.75">I thought wow that&amp;#39;s really interesting</text>
  <text start="1978.89" dur="4.89">that somebody that was on the Benghazi</text>
  <text start="1981.02" dur="4.23">committee is not wanting the information</text>
  <text start="1983.78" dur="6.12">that I&amp;#39;m trying to provide them and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1985.25" dur="7.8">very good information and from there you</text>
  <text start="1989.9" dur="6.12">know I decided I am to the call shortly</text>
  <text start="1993.05" dur="4.71">thereafter and then I was like thought</text>
  <text start="1996.02" dur="2.93">about it for a few nights and I thought</text>
  <text start="1997.76" dur="3.72">what</text>
  <text start="1998.95" dur="4.51">why would this happen</text>
  <text start="2001.48" dur="3.72">why she tell me to call the FBI and I</text>
  <text start="2003.46" dur="3.42">thought it was she was trying to call my</text>
  <text start="2005.2" dur="4.56">bluff but she&amp;#39;s trying to know that</text>
  <text start="2006.88" dur="4.98">she&amp;#39;s trying to bluff me and tell me</text>
  <text start="2009.76" dur="3.48">that you know what are you going to do</text>
  <text start="2011.86" dur="3.78">about it you know go ahead and call the</text>
  <text start="2013.24" dur="4.08">FBI and then I did I called the FBI</text>
  <text start="2015.64" dur="3.63">eventually came around to it I got the</text>
  <text start="2017.32" dur="3.21">courage and I called the FBI it was</text>
  <text start="2019.27" dur="3.99">probably a week and asked two weeks</text>
  <text start="2020.53" dur="3.97">later I called the FBI and I told them I</text>
  <text start="2023.26" dur="4.029">said hey</text>
  <text start="2024.5" dur="4.53">more information about Benghazi and they</text>
  <text start="2027.289" dur="3.451">said alright and they took my name phone</text>
  <text start="2029.03" dur="3.36">number all my information that they</text>
  <text start="2030.74" dur="3.9">could look up in Office of Personnel</text>
  <text start="2032.39" dur="4.47">Management they have access to to know</text>
  <text start="2034.64" dur="3.899">where I worked where you know at the</text>
  <text start="2036.86" dur="4.799">time I work there and what I would</text>
  <text start="2038.539" dur="4.531">likely know about it and I gave him all</text>
  <text start="2041.659" dur="3.541">my information told him that I wanted to</text>
  <text start="2043.07" dur="5.279">meet them in person to talk to them</text>
  <text start="2045.2" dur="4.5">about it and they told me they said we</text>
  <text start="2048.349" dur="4.731">don&amp;#39;t do appointments you just got to</text>
  <text start="2049.7" dur="5.37">walk in to the FBI field office what</text>
  <text start="2053.08" dur="4.51">something was off about this and at that</text>
  <text start="2055.07" dur="5.039">time that&amp;#39;s after Comey had just been</text>
  <text start="2057.59" dur="5.13">fired for starting a coup the FBI</text>
  <text start="2060.109" dur="6.091">director you know against the president</text>
  <text start="2062.72" dur="7.639">so I was thinking to myself okay okay so</text>
  <text start="2066.2" dur="4.159">now the FBI is corrupt too so how</text>
  <text start="2070.88" dur="3.09">where we going with this you got the the</text>
  <text start="2072.2" dur="4.89">Congress you got the FBI are both</text>
  <text start="2073.97" dur="4.56">corrupt who&amp;#39;ll even talk to now so I</text>
  <text start="2077.09" dur="4.05">didn&amp;#39;t even I did not even communicate</text>
  <text start="2078.53" dur="3.84">back with them but consider this all he</text>
  <text start="2081.14" dur="3.18">had to do is look my information up and</text>
  <text start="2082.37" dur="3.18">then contact me and set up a meeting and</text>
  <text start="2084.32" dur="2.73">I would have come in there and given him</text>
  <text start="2085.55" dur="2.93">everything and they would have known and</text>
  <text start="2087.05" dur="4.32">they could have held people accountable</text>
  <text start="2088.48" dur="5.44">why did that happen why they still this</text>
  <text start="2091.37" dur="3.24">is two years later they still not even</text>
  <text start="2093.92" dur="4.26">called me</text>
  <text start="2094.61" dur="5.1">I just want Josh to have an opportunity</text>
  <text start="2098.18" dur="4.53">to answer that previous question you</text>
  <text start="2099.71" dur="4.71">asked that Nick answered um just for a</text>
  <text start="2102.71" dur="6.03">moment and then I&amp;#39;ll give you my wrap-up</text>
  <text start="2104.42" dur="5.73">speech Josh oh yeah</text>
  <text start="2108.74" dur="3.18">you know as far as coming forward with</text>
  <text start="2110.15" dur="3.27">any information what not I guess I never</text>
  <text start="2111.92" dur="3.66">really thought about it at the time I</text>
  <text start="2113.42" dur="4.79">more went in a different direction on I</text>
  <text start="2115.58" dur="5.52">sort of uh I basically suppress it all</text>
  <text start="2118.21" dur="4.24">um you know at the time you talked about</text>
  <text start="2121.1" dur="3.35">it with the people who went through it</text>
  <text start="2122.45" dur="4.11">and dealt with it</text>
  <text start="2124.45" dur="3.49">but there&amp;#39;s always another mission</text>
  <text start="2126.56" dur="2.61">there&amp;#39;s always you know the next day I</text>
  <text start="2127.94" dur="3.39">gotta get you know have your head</text>
  <text start="2129.17" dur="4.05">screwed on straight so a lot of it was</text>
  <text start="2131.33" dur="4.56">pushing all that stuff down I guess I</text>
  <text start="2133.22" dur="4.02">never really inquired or knew you know</text>
  <text start="2135.89" dur="3.03">really any avenues to get the</text>
  <text start="2137.24" dur="3.09">information out beyond talking about it</text>
  <text start="2138.92" dur="3.57">with your constituents and stuff like</text>
  <text start="2140.33" dur="5.25">that so just kind of something you carry</text>
  <text start="2142.49" dur="6.33">around for you know as long as you do</text>
  <text start="2145.58" dur="4.98">without any real outlet to you know to</text>

  <text start="2158.69" dur="4.2">there now with these gentlemen has been</text>
  <text start="2160.82" dur="4.5">you know pretty therapeutic because I</text>
  <text start="2162.89" dur="3.63">mean even though you know happened so</text>
  <text start="2165.32" dur="3.24">long ago it&amp;#39;s just something that you</text>

  <text start="2168.56" dur="3.9">carry around for a long time and just</text>
  <text start="2170.33" dur="4.14">sort of you can push it down as much as</text>
  <text start="2172.46" dur="4.29">you want but then you know eventually it</text>
  <text start="2174.47" dur="4.71">gets resurrected and I mean I&amp;#39;ve had my</text>

  <text start="2230.15" dur="6.81">for you coming forward oh my god it was</text>
  <text start="2234.46" dur="5.38">frustrating you know you see people that</text>
  <text start="2236.96" dur="5.04">are in positions of trust positions of</text>
  <text start="2239.84" dur="5.55">authority that take no action and do</text>
  <text start="2242" dur="6.45">nothing it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s very disheartening</text>
  <text start="2245.39" dur="7.02">and it irritates me doesn&amp;#39;t make me</text>
  <text start="2248.45" dur="5.64">angry though it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like it makes me</text>
  <text start="2252.41" dur="3.09">kind of sad because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="2254.09" dur="3.75">people to your left and right just</text>
  <text start="2255.5" dur="4.83">normal everyday people people in the</text>
  <text start="2257.84" dur="5.37">military to your left and right you get</text>
  <text start="2260.33" dur="4.83">this sense of well I&amp;#39;m not a congressman</text>
  <text start="2263.21" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m not an FBI guy I&amp;#39;m not this I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2265.16" dur="6.48">that what happens if you know they come</text>
  <text start="2268.4" dur="4.92">after me in that way and you feel bad</text>
  <text start="2271.64" dur="4.5">for them because it&amp;#39;s like they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2273.32" dur="5.4">have a prayer if people can get away</text>
  <text start="2276.14" dur="5.22">with allowing people Americans to die</text>

  <text start="2283.88" dur="5.22">shut up and not do the right duties I</text>
  <text start="2286.09" dur="5.53">mean what chance does a normal person</text>
  <text start="2289.1" dur="4.86">have and that&amp;#39;s the fear and you really</text>
  <text start="2291.62" dur="3.39">have to go back on that and say no it&amp;#39;s</text>
