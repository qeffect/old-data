  <text start="65.82" dur="6.78">distance shot of an airplane okay what</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="4.291">airplane is that somewhere is it coming</text>
  <text start="72.6" dur="6.42">from well a lot of people have put</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="6.45">together that this airplane is a JetBlue</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="5">flight based on the tail wing here and</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="6.149">you can actually kind of see the JetBlue</text>
  <text start="84.02" dur="6.01">logo now why is that important well it</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="5.131">ties into what we see in the next</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="5.25">picture what is this</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="6.6">well this picture for those of you who</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="9.71">don&amp;#39;t know it is a place in California</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="8.82">known as Apple&amp;#39;s spaceship campus okay</text>
  <text start="104.99" dur="5.5">now it&amp;#39;s in Cupertino California as we</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="4.019">all know whoever has or owns Apple</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="4.62">products is probably seeing that they</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="4.561">preload the weather in Cupertino first</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="3.689">and foremost and they brag about how</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="5.839">they have their little spaceship</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="5.82">headquarters there quite often but</text>
  <text start="122.659" dur="5.561">that&amp;#39;s that photo</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="6.781">now the next photos that we get from</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="5.67">Hugh are this you have the back of a</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="4.38">trailer semi-truck trailer</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="4.38">people are debating whether it&amp;#39;s a 48</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="5.7">foot or 53 foot whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.27" dur="5.45">refrigerated or not these pallets seem</text>
  <text start="141.48" dur="6.51">to be a part of a company called CH AP</text>
  <text start="143.72" dur="6.37">and we&amp;#39;re still not sure exactly what is</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="4.469">wrapped up in these pallets although if</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="5.58">you look at the picture of what pallets</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="4.5">of iPhones look like it may be similar</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="4.08">to that but other people have speculated</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="5.551">that their pallets of cash and we get</text>
  <text start="159.75" dur="5.13">into the theories behind that why would</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="5.94">pallets of cash be being shipped to</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="4.859">Apple headquarters which is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="2.4">going to get into really quickly here</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="2.28">next because I want to go through these</text>
  <text start="170.85" dur="3.51">photos first then we&amp;#39;re going to talk</text>
  <text start="172.019" dur="5.581">about the significance of these photos</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="7.32">one by one now this next one is the</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="7.32">Apple headquarters now those of you</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="7.05">don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m gonna pull up really</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="5.88">quickly this let me see if I can find</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="3.69">the right one this is the picture that</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.53">Q&amp;#39;s posted now it&amp;#39;s not the exact same</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="4.38">picture obviously you can actually tell</text>
  <text start="195.33" dur="4.35">because there&amp;#39;s different cars down here</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="5.279">beneath but it&amp;#39;s the same picture taken</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="4.32">from almost the exact same place it</text>
  <text start="202.079" dur="3.181">would seem which is kind of creepy</text>
  <text start="204" dur="1.799">because you have to wonder where was</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="2.789">this taken</text>
  <text start="205.799" dur="5.461">picture taken from this is an article</text>
  <text start="208.049" dur="6">that is on Wizard and it is talking</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="6">about how Apple&amp;#39;s new security center is</text>
  <text start="214.049" dur="5.16">located in China and it will comply with</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="6.75">the new cyber security law and this is</text>
  <text start="219.209" dur="9.09">from July of 2017 credit to Keyshawn</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="7.89">brown for publishing this article but it</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="7.291">talks about this okay this is the the</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="6.839">center of security for Apple in China</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="5.28">and why is that important well obviously</text>
  <text start="238.739" dur="3.541">Q&amp;#39;s giving us this picture for a reason</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="3.75">now you can see that the cars are</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="7.11">different in the two photos but it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="7.5">same exact place and Apple as you all</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="4.68">know just popped up in the news recently</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="3.989">and I&amp;#39;ll show you an article hold on so</text>
  <text start="254.07" dur="4.05">anybody who&amp;#39;s on the outside looking in</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.741">can tell exactly what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="5.07">with Apple they&amp;#39;ve gone to China and</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="3.84">China they&amp;#39;ve sold out to the Chinese</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="2.79">and they&amp;#39;ve actually turned the keys</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="5.28">over</text>
  <text start="265.98" dur="6.28">to the iCloud storage and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="5.02">because that&amp;#39;s the requirement the China</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="5.97">makes of you when you go to China to do</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="4.74">business I mean you can&amp;#39;t have secret</text>
  <text start="278.23" dur="3.54">information from the Communist Party</text>
  <text start="279.73" dur="4.62">they control everything if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="5.34">believe me check out a guy like Chris</text>
  <text start="284.35" dur="4.289">Chappell and China uncensored a big</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="4.559">shout out to him go check out his</text>
  <text start="288.639" dur="6.75">channel watch his his content it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="291.669" dur="7.141">it&amp;#39;s smart it&amp;#39;s incredible gold looks</text>
  <text start="295.389" dur="4.861">listen to him though and just that&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="4.05">give you if you&amp;#39;re not aware of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="8.61">going on in China it&amp;#39;s a funny and fun</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="9.029">way to get involved in just what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="5.82">on in China but this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.889" dur="5.131">doing that they&amp;#39;re not just waging this</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="4.41">war to control the South China Sea it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="4.86">also this war to control global</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="6.75">economies I mean imagine if you&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="5.789">in the imagine this we are the number</text>
  <text start="325.84" dur="4.59">one economy in the world by almost a</text>
  <text start="327.669" dur="7.051">factor of two and the second largest</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="6.299">economy in the world is China for those</text>
  <text start="334.72" dur="6.18">of you who like racing I&amp;#39;ll give you a</text>
  <text start="336.729" dur="7.621">racing analogy if I&amp;#39;m in first place and</text>
  <text start="340.9" dur="5.97">I look at my rearview mirror and one car</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="9.75">lengths back there is a person trying to</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="9.21">pass me a competitor what am I gonna do</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="5.18">am I gonna throttle back and let him go</text>
  <text start="356.08" dur="5.58">around or am I going to continue to</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="5.02">drive as fast as I can in order to win</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="4.29">the race well it&amp;#39;s the same principle</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="3.81">when you break down what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="4.82">America and China they realized they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.11" dur="4.89">falling behind they realized that</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="3.94">they&amp;#39;ve fallen into a place now with</text>
  <text start="373" dur="3.389">Trump where they weren&amp;#39;t before with</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="6.72">like Obama and other administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.389" dur="6.741">before them because our whole listen our</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="4.25">whole doctrine for the last eight</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="4.87">sixteen years maybe was appeasement</text>
  <text start="385.68" dur="5.35">maybe bush was a little bit harder but</text>
  <text start="388" dur="4.919">he appease the deep state so it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="4.379">matter and if you look at the connection</text>
  <text start="392.919" dur="4.771">between and I&amp;#39;m getting on a little rant</text>
  <text start="395.409" dur="3.751">here excuse me but if you look at the</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="5.01">connection between the</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="9.45">family and what happened in in Texas</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="7.65">when our great former President JFK lost</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="3.45">life there are some suspicious things</text>
  <text start="410.35" dur="3.78">but that&amp;#39;s for another episode</text>
  <text start="412.06" dur="4.77">altogether so I&amp;#39;m not going to go there</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="4.62">today what I will say is that what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="4.08">getting into is very complicated so</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="6.51">first off you have these flights now</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="7.17">these flights have been analyzed by many</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="5.28">different Anton&amp;#39;s at this point and</text>
  <text start="428.08" dur="4.52">there&amp;#39;s kind of a conclusive sense that</text>
  <text start="430.54" dur="4.86">this airplane was flying out of Oakland</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="4.99">and what flights would be flying out of</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="5.72">Oakland on JetBlue possibly something to</text>
  <text start="437.59" dur="6.3">China to Shanghai or somewhere else and</text>
  <text start="441.12" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re pointing the fact that this is</text>
  <text start="443.89" dur="5.4">the picture story I&amp;#39;m putting together</text>
  <text start="445.6" dur="5.79">on my own here without you guys getting</text>
  <text start="449.29" dur="4.71">into the details of facts yet because I</text>
  <text start="451.39" dur="4.23">have a lot to present here forward but</text>
  <text start="454" dur="3.63">this is the theory I&amp;#39;ve come to just to</text>
  <text start="455.62" dur="3.72">keep you guys kind of involved and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="5.4">gonna see exactly what turns into but</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="10.07">the theory is this executives or people</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="8.73">working for Apple got on a plane and she</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.72">was telling us they&amp;#39;re from the Apple</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="6.75">headquarters they went to China to</text>
  <text start="474.13" dur="5.94">deliver this pallet this pallet these</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="3.3">pallets I think there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s three pallets one&amp;#39;s got a tarp</text>
  <text start="481.81" dur="4.8">over it maybe more you can&amp;#39;t see exactly</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="6.84">how deep the truck is there could be a</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="8.67">few more behind there but these pallets</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="5.64">contain the actual it&amp;#39;s either that they</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="6.6">contain cash or they contain the actual</text>
  <text start="497.14" dur="8.04">keys the keys to the cloud storage for</text>
  <text start="501.88" dur="6.11">the United States and that there&amp;#39;s in my</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="5.22">opinion what this is Cube telling us I</text>
  <text start="507.99" dur="4.96">mean how would they get a picture of the</text>
  <text start="510.4" dur="6.3">pallets if let&amp;#39;s hypothetically say that</text>
  <text start="512.95" dur="7.83">I&amp;#39;m right for a second which only the</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="6.029">Lord would know not me but let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="520.78" dur="5.19">hypothetically right and that this is</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="5.911">these are pallets containing disk drives</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="4.47">that have the keys to all that iCloud</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="6.4">storage</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="6.94">information right not just for here but</text>
  <text start="535.04" dur="3.9">for the the or not not just for China</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="2.91">but for the United States and all the</text>
  <text start="538.94" dur="4.26">other countries that have iPhones which</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="7.89">is pretty much global if that is the</text>
  <text start="543.2" dur="8.96">case then one would suspect that maybe Q</text>
  <text start="548.18" dur="6.72">has intervened and taken those back I</text>
  <text start="552.16" dur="5.38">mean there&amp;#39;s so much going on behind the</text>
  <text start="554.9" dur="4.71">scenes that this is mere speculation but</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="4.77">could you imagine in the sense that to</text>
  <text start="559.61" dur="6.39">get this picture of that maybe they took</text>
  <text start="562.31" dur="6.18">back the truck and thwarted their plan</text>
  <text start="566" dur="5.04">to take it to the iPhone top-security</text>
  <text start="568.49" dur="4.92">are the Apple top-security China Center</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="6.15">because Apple has just gone rogue and</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="5.64">decided to relocate into China and this</text>
  <text start="577.19" dur="4.32">story&amp;#39;s been broken for quite some time</text>
  <text start="579.05" dur="4.11">if you go back you know Eve Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="5.46">here just saying and he was talking</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="7.38">about this way before but how Tim Cook</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="6.75">has gotten together with China and then</text>
  <text start="590.54" dur="5.7">they basically are gonna store their</text>
  <text start="593.72" dur="8">iCloud keys in China is this the actual</text>
  <text start="596.24" dur="5.48">iCloud Keys being transported to China</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="6.34">in order to spy on us as Americans and</text>
  <text start="606.14" dur="4.74">to gain favor with the Chinese by the</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="4.02">the corporation Apple because think</text>
  <text start="610.88" dur="3.69">about it what was the biggest</text>
  <text start="612.38" dur="3.54">corporation of the last decade I mean</text>
  <text start="614.57" dur="4.17">most people would agree it was Apple</text>
  <text start="615.92" dur="6.84">they were they were monolithic in their</text>
  <text start="618.74" dur="5.82">control and and and monopoly of the</text>
  <text start="622.76" dur="4.11">market besides maybe a company like</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="6.09">Google who obviously was working with</text>
  <text start="626.87" dur="7.17">them but not owning or sharing ownership</text>
  <text start="630.65" dur="5.1">of the company this is all theoretical</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="3.989">people I really want to hear your</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="3.6">thoughts so go down in the comment</text>
  <text start="638.029" dur="3.781">section and leave your thoughts on</text>

  <text start="1396.66" dur="6.14">to mention the blessings I think people</text>
  <text start="1399.63" dur="6.87">are so quick to throw away the fact that</text>
  <text start="1402.8" dur="4.81">that a life is is is terrible right now</text>
  <text start="1406.5" dur="3.6">and that they&amp;#39;re going through I know</text>
  <text start="1407.61" dur="5.4">people okay I&amp;#39;m not going to talk about</text>
  <text start="1410.1" dur="8.28">anybody in particular but I know some</text>
  <text start="1413.01" dur="7.92">people who have a very low self-image</text>
  <text start="1418.38" dur="4.11">and then it causes them to act out</text>
  <text start="1420.93" dur="4.29">aggressively and it caused them to have</text>
  <text start="1422.49" dur="6.83">all types of problems especially when it</text>
  <text start="1425.22" dur="8.94">comes to evolving in a social sense and</text>
  <text start="1429.32" dur="8.73">the problem lies in majority I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1434.16" dur="6.45">think with this particular person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1438.05" dur="3.82">ability or inability to talk to people</text>
  <text start="1440.61" dur="5.52">or</text>
  <text start="1441.87" dur="7.92">even any kind of mental problem I think</text>
  <text start="1446.13" dur="5.55">what these people and in this person in</text>
  <text start="1449.79" dur="4.71">particular I think what they have a</text>
  <text start="1451.68" dur="6.54">problem with is they have a problem with</text>
  <text start="1454.5" dur="6.84">a lack of God in their life and it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1458.22" dur="5.19">easy to say that you know you know the</text>
  <text start="1461.34" dur="2.58">old saying goes it&amp;#39;s easier said than</text>
  <text start="1463.41" dur="3.09">done</text>
  <text start="1463.92" dur="5.19">right so it&amp;#39;s easier for me to sit here</text>
  <text start="1466.5" dur="4.2">and say oh well you know the reason that</text>
  <text start="1469.11" dur="6.42">you&amp;#39;re unhappy the reason that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1470.7" dur="9.33">had this problem with low self-worth and</text>
  <text start="1475.53" dur="7.02">these problems with anger the the reason</text>
  <text start="1480.03" dur="4.29">is you don&amp;#39;t have God in your heart or</text>
  <text start="1482.55" dur="4.05">maybe you have God in your heart but you</text>
  <text start="1484.32" dur="4.38">just don&amp;#39;t embrace that every day you</text>
  <text start="1486.6" dur="3.98">only let it come out in small bits and</text>
  <text start="1488.7" dur="8.33">pieces here and there</text>
  <text start="1490.58" dur="9.43">but that is the easy thing for me to do</text>
  <text start="1497.03" dur="6.55">there&amp;#39;s but there is something to be</text>
  <text start="1500.01" dur="8.43">said for the truth and the truth is that</text>
  <text start="1503.58" dur="6.69">God is the way he will heal your heart</text>
  <text start="1508.44" dur="4.2">he will bring you happiness and he will</text>
  <text start="1510.27" dur="5.72">give you blessings and all he asked in</text>
  <text start="1512.64" dur="6.53">return is your eternal faith in Him and</text>
  <text start="1515.99" dur="5.74">then you get eternal life in heaven</text>
  <text start="1519.17" dur="6.01">because Jesus died on the cross for our</text>
  <text start="1521.73" dur="7.55">sins so what I want to read today is</text>
