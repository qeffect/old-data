  <text start="244.989" dur="3.901">really big stories like what we talked</text>
  <text start="247.269" dur="5.071">about the beginning with just Lane</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="5.01">Maxwell and this whole plot to extract</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="3.03">her from the United States I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="3.899">if it worked or not but somebody</text>

  <text start="257.799" dur="2.041">out that you guys are going to want to</text>
  <text start="258.85" dur="2.609">hear about firsthand</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="3.81">but here&amp;#39;s the first piece this is great</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="3.721">coming from the New York Times saying</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="3.36">that Trump allies are targeting</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="3.81">journalists over coverage deemed hostile</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="3.72">to the White House and in the article</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="5.64">they basically go on to say that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.73" dur="6.12">having dossiers compiled on them which</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="5.85">go and find negative things they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="276.85" dur="7.11">written in social media posts okay well</text>
  <text start="280.48" dur="5.61">then I mean like what we can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="5.49">even literally call these people out for</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="4.92">the things they&amp;#39;ve said now that you got</text>
  <text start="289.45" dur="3.24">to understand New York Times this fit is</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="4.5">not just failing as president Trump has</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="5.31">always said but they are actually the</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="4.26">enemy of the people I mean it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="298" dur="4.08">surprise that rush limbaugh has come out</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="5.24">and said that basically the New York</text>
  <text start="302.08" dur="6.15">Times what they&amp;#39;re doing is satanic or</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="5.53">can be called satanic as he puts it but</text>
  <text start="308.23" dur="5.79">the reality is what he goes on to</text>
  <text start="310.54" dur="5.07">outline is this whole 16:19 project if</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="4.2">you guys don&amp;#39;t know what this is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s a rewriting of history that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="4.02">spearheaded by the New York Times where</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re gonna go back and say that the</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="6.27">from the first day that a slave African</text>
  <text start="325.45" dur="5.61">slaves stepped foot on this country it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="4.92">basically been built on their suffering</text>
  <text start="331.06" dur="5.13">and that everything that we have today</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="6">this great country you know freedom the</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="6.18">Constitution whatever you you know</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="6">prosperity it&amp;#39;s all because of slavery</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="6.69">and we should somehow look at our</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="6.239">country with a disdain for our history</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="4.56">rather than what we&amp;#39;ve done historically</text>
  <text start="351.669" dur="5.091">which is look at our history and learn</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="5.46">from it and then you know adapt I mean</text>
  <text start="356.76" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost as if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="5.58">overlooking the fact that we had an</text>
  <text start="361" dur="6">entire civil war to end slavery we were</text>
  <text start="364.66" dur="5.58">willing to fight our our country find</text>
  <text start="367" dur="5.669">ourselves in order to get rid of slavery</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="4.44">to purge that inhumane practice and</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="3.901">nothing&amp;#39;s perfect yes it took time but</text>
  <text start="374.68" dur="5.43">of course we look back on these things</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="6.51">and we work to become better we look</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="5.07">forward we don&amp;#39;t spend our lives as the</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="3.899">New York Times would want you to do it</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="3.84">living in this constant state of</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="5.011">victimhood where everything that</text>
  <text start="389.02" dur="4.47">happened in the past is is</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="3.99">addictive of your future is gonna make</text>
  <text start="393.49" dur="6.93">you act in a certain way and is gonna</text>
  <text start="395.98" dur="7.41">have these predetermined outcomes which</text>
  <text start="400.42" dur="4.62">are you can read through this article</text>
  <text start="403.39" dur="4.74">for yourself you can see the quotes from</text>
  <text start="405.04" dur="4.86">Rush Limbaugh he&amp;#39;s dead on correct when</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="5.57">he says that they are trying to rewrite</text>
  <text start="409.9" dur="6.81">history and that this project is obscene</text>
  <text start="413.7" dur="5.17">reading through the article further this</text>
  <text start="416.71" dur="4.59">is Russia&amp;#39;s actual quote here it says</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve seen desperation Limbaugh said I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="3.84">seen panic throughout my life personally</text>
  <text start="423.28" dur="3.51">or professionally personally I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="425.14" dur="3.63">it I know what it looks like I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="426.79" dur="3.84">seen this degree of panic and some will</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="3.93">say this is not panic this is satanic</text>
  <text start="430.63" dur="4.5">however you want to characterize this</text>
  <text start="432.7" dur="4.74">this is an act of pure desperation and</text>
  <text start="435.13" dur="5.25">as the writer points out aptly and in</text>
  <text start="437.44" dur="4.56">this piece that was Limbaugh steak but I</text>
  <text start="440.38" dur="4.05">like their take as well saying The Times</text>
  <text start="442" dur="3.66">New York Times and Democrats gambit to</text>
  <text start="444.43" dur="3.18">win over the American people by</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="4.2">convincing them that the country is a</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="7.32">giant lie may be a move inspired by</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="9.11">desperation complete panic and yeah so</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="6.87">the reality is we see right through it</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="4.56">you can understand very quickly why the</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="4.47">New York Times would write this kind of</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="5.26">article and start this kind of or excuse</text>
  <text start="466.27" dur="5.37">me start this kind of project it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="468.79" dur="6.48">about creating a new class of victims</text>
  <text start="471.64" dur="8.4">which they can exploit to control them</text>
  <text start="475.27" dur="6.84">and to gain and keep power so you know</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="3.99">it is what it is it&amp;#39;s not like we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="4.05">see right through it</text>
  <text start="484.03" dur="5.01">here&amp;#39;s an interesting article Vanity</text>
  <text start="486.16" dur="5.15">Fair interviewed Epstein&amp;#39;s accusers but</text>
  <text start="489.04" dur="6.06">never published a report after Epstein</text>
  <text start="491.31" dur="6.22">visited offices so I Vanity Fair</text>
  <text start="495.1" dur="5.4">interviewed the women back in 2006 and</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="4.11">the story was actually updated here that</text>
  <text start="500.5" dur="2.43">I mean you can&amp;#39;t and this is like</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="2.37">straight out of The Godfather you know</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="3.87">when the guy wakes up and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="504.01" dur="5.37">horse head in his bed this is that kind</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="6.68">of level of intimidation it seems</text>
  <text start="509.38" dur="7.59">because with the editor at Vanity Fair</text>
  <text start="513.48" dur="7.24">only a couple days I guess after Epstein</text>
  <text start="516.97" dur="5.13">they did this report and the Epstein was</text>
  <text start="520.72" dur="4.46">visiting their office found a severed</text>
  <text start="522.1" dur="5.51">cat head in his yard which is disturbing</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="3.69">and it&amp;#39;s obviously a sign to intimidate</text>
  <text start="527.61" dur="3.24">and that&amp;#39;s the kind of messages that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="4.11">kind of people that that that are behind</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="3.72">all this don&amp;#39;t forget that another</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="5.19">interesting story here</text>

  <text start="544.17" dur="5.31">not believe it was a homicide but it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1797.47" dur="3.12">of each one these episodes called God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1798.97" dur="3.65">grace is greater where we talk about</text>
  <text start="1800.59" dur="3.96">God&amp;#39;s grace and how it is truly greater</text>
  <text start="1802.62" dur="3.22">but today we&amp;#39;re going to talk about this</text>
  <text start="1804.55" dur="4.59">piece of scripture out of the book of</text>
  <text start="1805.84" dur="5.94">James it&amp;#39;s chapter 4 verse 7 through 10</text>
  <text start="1809.14" dur="5.52">it says God resists the proud but gives</text>
  <text start="1811.78" dur="5.52">grace to the humble therefore submit to</text>
  <text start="1814.66" dur="5.31">God but resist the devil and he will</text>
  <text start="1817.3" dur="4.89">flee from you draw near to God and He</text>
  <text start="1819.97" dur="4.62">will draw near to you cleanse your hands</text>
  <text start="1822.19" dur="4.86">sinners and purify your hearts double</text>
  <text start="1824.59" dur="5.16">minded people be miserable and mourn and</text>
  <text start="1827.05" dur="5.31">weep your laughter much must change to</text>
  <text start="1829.75" dur="4.56">mourning and your joy to sorrow humble</text>
  <text start="1832.36" dur="6.45">yourselves before the Lord and He will</text>
  <text start="1834.31" dur="6.51">exalt you now we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="1838.81" dur="5.37">first year before and I always share it</text>
  <text start="1840.82" dur="5.25">because it&amp;#39;s an important message we</text>
  <text start="1844.18" dur="3.58">have to remind ourselves that God</text>
  <text start="1846.07" dur="5.26">resists</text>
  <text start="1847.76" dur="5.009">the prideful but he gives abundant grace</text>
  <text start="1851.33" dur="6.15">to people who will humble themselves</text>
  <text start="1852.769" dur="7.081">before his his almighty power and as it</text>
  <text start="1857.48" dur="6.15">says there those who are living in sin</text>
  <text start="1859.85" dur="7.62">should turn their joy into sorrow</text>
  <text start="1863.63" dur="6.72">because they are not gonna receive God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1867.47" dur="4.26">grace and but they don&amp;#39;t even realize</text>
  <text start="1870.35" dur="3.3">that and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re up against</text>
  <text start="1871.73" dur="5.91">there are people out there who live</text>
  <text start="1873.65" dur="6">their lives based on themselves and we</text>
  <text start="1877.64" dur="5.399">are living our lives based on God and</text>
  <text start="1879.65" dur="7.2">sharing God&amp;#39;s Word and being righteous</text>
  <text start="1883.039" dur="5.821">and humble and that to me is what we</text>
  <text start="1886.85" dur="4.02">need to practice in our everyday lives</text>
  <text start="1888.86" dur="3.6">so that we can be better to our family</text>
  <text start="1890.87" dur="4.14">we can be better to our friends and</text>
  <text start="1892.46" dur="5.969">co-workers and people that we meet we</text>
