  <text start="3.259" dur="5.291">basically they&amp;#39;ve gotten the fcc&amp;#39;s heads</text>
  <text start="5.97" dur="4.41">been and around with the fact that</text>
  <text start="8.55" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re going to create you know three</text>
  <text start="10.38" dur="4.74">million jobs have a five hundred billion</text>
  <text start="12.63" dur="4.5">dollar impact to the GDP and spur two</text>
  <text start="15.12" dur="4.02">hundred seventy five billion dollars in</text>
  <text start="17.13" dur="4.88">investment they&amp;#39;re going to create all</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="5.549">this new technology you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="22.01" dur="4.089">doctors operating on people over great</text>
  <text start="24.689" dur="3.871">distances with robots</text>
  <text start="26.099" dur="5.971">you&amp;#39;re going to have self-driving cars</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="7.28">that can you know anticipate accidents</text>
  <text start="32.07" dur="7.62">and not crash as much you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="35.84" dur="6.039">people at NASCAR being able to take</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="4.139">their phone and popping it into a little</text>
  <text start="41.879" dur="4.2">headset and being sitting in the</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="5.101">driver&amp;#39;s seat or the passenger seat of</text>
  <text start="46.079" dur="4.951">their favorite NASCAR driver you know</text>
  <text start="48.93" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re creating all this stuff all</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="4.56">these things that all of a sudden 5g is</text>
  <text start="53.85" dur="6.09">the only thing that can answer these</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="6.149">problems which is not true hi guys and</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="4.469">welcome to another episode of just</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.821">informed talk so today we&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="5.371">something a little bit different so it</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="4.08">has come to my attention that a lot of</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="5.07">you guys out there want to know more</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="5.339">about 5g and I&amp;#39;m one of those people who</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="5.4">is always looking to learn more about</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="5.43">any kind of subjects so when I saw a few</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="3.27">stories pop up recently out of Politico</text>
  <text start="82.409" dur="3.361">which talked about how there was a</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="4.709">divide in the Trump administration with</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="4.349">regard to nationalizing 5g I thought</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="6.121">it&amp;#39;d be a great opportunity to have an</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="5.731">actual expert on 5g on the show so this</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="3.75">is an interview I did with my friend</text>
  <text start="95.85" dur="6.18">Alex Phillips and we talked about all</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="7.17">the different nuances coming with this</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="4.619">new 5g network and we talked about the</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="4.08">dangers so you guys are going to want to</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="7.981">stick around to watch that and I hope</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="6.93">you enjoy hi and welcome I am here with</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="4.529">a good friend of mine</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="5.04">Alex Phillips he is gonna talk to us</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="4.201">today about a little thing that we all</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="4.2">are worried about and we all should be</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="5.7">worried about if we&amp;#39;re not yet and it is</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="5.31">5g but it might not be 5g for the same</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="2.91">reasons you may be thinking we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="3.28">actually going to be talking about the</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="4.31">different</text>
  <text start="134.11" dur="3.91">complexities going into what the</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="3.96">implementation of a nationalized 5g</text>
  <text start="138.02" dur="4.62">would look like 5g network would look</text>
  <text start="140.24" dur="5.13">like and so let me just introduce Alex</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="5.7">Phillips here he is the president of the</text>
  <text start="145.37" dur="5.52">American priority foundation which is</text>
  <text start="148.34" dur="4.47">also the host of it he&amp;#39;s also the host</text>
  <text start="150.89" dur="3.54">of the American priority conference he</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="4.02">is the past president of the Wireless</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="3.78">ISP Association and he said why he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="156.83" dur="5.1">owner of a wireless and fiber of</text>
  <text start="158.21" dur="6.03">broadband is he so what we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="161.93" dur="4.4">about today is a 5g and I just want to</text>
  <text start="164.24" dur="5.37">say thank you for coming out and welcome</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="6.37">hey Craig thanks for calling uh talking</text>
  <text start="169.61" dur="4.65">about this thing is that the the 5g has</text>
  <text start="172.7" dur="4.05">been that something I&amp;#39;ve been kind of</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="4.47">involved with for several years when I</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="4.82">was in the board of directors of whispah</text>
  <text start="178.73" dur="4.92">Wireless ISP Association but moreover</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="4.66">recently just trying to follow what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.65" dur="5.4">going on with regulations and how</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re affecting the public this</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="6.51">political story that came out of last</text>
  <text start="192.38" dur="4.19">week about the nationalized 5g proposal</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="3.679">coming out of the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="196.57" dur="5.62">really concerned me mostly because</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="4.931">coming out of CPAC listening to</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="5.16">President Trump talk about how he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="5.01">going to do anything socialist in our</text>
  <text start="207.35" dur="3.66">country you know the United States will</text>
  <text start="209.18" dur="4.11">never be a socialist country and then</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="5.96">had see this proposal which has smacks</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="6">of socialism really really concerned me</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="4.72">right and that&amp;#39;s why I wanted to have</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="5.58">you on because I think this deserves a</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="6.09">more in-depth discussion so we have five</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="5.369">G that is this new Internet technology</text>
  <text start="227.78" dur="5.73">so are this new wireless service</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="4.981">internet connection technology why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="4.949">you explain to the tar audience</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="4.89">kind of what 5g does where it kind of</text>
  <text start="238.459" dur="5.101">came from and because you know the</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="5.55">technical details on that well so 5g</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="4.739">itself is sort of like a marketing term</text>
  <text start="245.66" dur="6.48">so you would have we&amp;#39;ve had the 2g to 3G</text>
  <text start="248.299" dur="5.611">and today we&amp;#39;re all using 4G and so</text>
  <text start="252.14" dur="4.83">obviously five comes next</text>
  <text start="253.91" dur="5.069">and I think the running joke is if I was</text>
  <text start="256.97" dur="5.4">a OC I would say why don&amp;#39;t we go</text>
  <text start="258.979" dur="6.391">straight to 10g but 5g is definitely a</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="3.84">marketing term it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="4.71">defined</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="6.54">by the standards for a wireless</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="4.83">networking system that could support you</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="4.65">know speeds up to 20 gigabits per second</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="4.92">however if you look at the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.4" dur="3.75">being implemented various carriers are</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="4.8">going to be implementing it in various</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="7.049">different ways there&amp;#39;s the plan for it</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="6.33">all being interoperable however if a you</text>
  <text start="288.199" dur="3.81">know carrier implements it one way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="3.6">definitely not going to be compatible</text>
  <text start="292.009" dur="6.63">with another carriers implementation and</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="5.55">so if you look at the various 5g</text>
  <text start="298.639" dur="5.581">implementations that are being planned</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="6.179">nationwide you look at Verizon in</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="4.5">particular who has been gobbling up all</text>
  <text start="306.289" dur="5.421">this millimeter-wave technology which is</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="6.81">our spectrum which is a very small</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="7.989">microwave they&amp;#39;re going to be using it</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="6.449">in more urban areas to create very small</text>
  <text start="319.699" dur="3.69">cells that means that when you look at</text>
  <text start="321.979" dur="4.681">your window you&amp;#39;ll probably be able to</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="6.631">see a transmitter on a streetlight or</text>
  <text start="326.66" dur="6.21">under the eve of a building so that your</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="5.07">little puck device that you have or your</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="4.41">phone in that case some cases I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="335.09" dur="5.069">able to pick up that signal a millimeter</text>
  <text start="337.28" dur="7.34">wave is very small and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="340.159" dur="8.73">affected by things like rain and</text>
  <text start="344.62" dur="7.24">buildings and trees and skin so it has</text>
  <text start="348.889" dur="5.701">to be very close to the user the</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="5.76">frequencies that most cellular phone</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="5.52">companies are using today have somewhere</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="5.94">in the neighborhood of two to five mile</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="6.33">range and so you see cell sites you know</text>
  <text start="363.56" dur="4.859">about two to five miles from every user</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="4.229">and if you get in between one of those</text>
  <text start="368.419" dur="4.161">sometimes you drop your call they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.669" dur="4.861">going to be implementing 5g on that</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="4.75">spectrum as well and then other</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="5.609">companies like t-mobile are going to be</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="6.059">in developing 5g technologies using the</text>
  <text start="381.139" dur="6.03">old television spectrum that they were</text>
  <text start="383.389" dur="5.611">able to purchase last year sub one</text>
  <text start="387.169" dur="4.74">gigahertz I mean it&amp;#39;s very low frequency</text>
  <text start="389" dur="7.139">and it&amp;#39;s going to have anywhere from</text>
  <text start="391.909" dur="5.961">five to ten mile radius of coverage how</text>
  <text start="396.139" dur="5.001">does that affect that</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="5.79">public so if you live in DC or an NFL</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="6.09">city and you get an implementation of</text>
  <text start="403.66" dur="5.85">the millimeter wave 5g you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="4.8">wireless internet services that are</text>
  <text start="409.51" dur="4.14">going to be ridiculously fast much</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="3.75">faster than you have today I think today</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="4.43">you know on a good day people are</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="5.7">somewhere around 20 gigabit 20 megabits</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="5.98">they&amp;#39;re gonna see a rise somewhere in</text>
  <text start="421.48" dur="4.17">the neighborhood of one one gigabit but</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="5.43">you&amp;#39;re gonna have to very close to the</text>
  <text start="425.65" dur="6.18">tower or the transmitter people that</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="4.35">live in the rural areas urbanized areas</text>
  <text start="431.83" dur="4.65">that are going to be leveraging the</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="5.7">existing spectrum so your your Verizon</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="5.64">has something in the 800 megahertz they</text>
  <text start="439.54" dur="5.91">house I have 700 megahertz which is sub</text>
  <text start="442.12" dur="5.91">1 gigahertz has pretty good range but</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="4.77">your companies like Sprint that are</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="3.51">gonna be in the 1.9 gigabit gigahertz</text>
  <text start="450.22" dur="3.33">range you know you&amp;#39;re still gonna be</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="5.24">looking at about 2 mile range you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.55" dur="6.78">gonna see about a 20% increase in speed</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="6.37">however your coverage and this is a</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="5.04">technical thing as you get faster you</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="3.6">have to have better connectivity and so</text>
  <text start="465.37" dur="3.69">people that are on the fringe of those</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="7.53">cell coverage areas are they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="469.06" dur="8.84">gonna lose and fall back to 4G so the</text>
  <text start="474.28" dur="5.82">higher frequencies the millimeter wave</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.12">shorter distance significantly shorter</text>
  <text start="480.1" dur="4.56">distance but have the tremendous</text>
  <text start="482.02" dur="5.61">possibility for speed the current</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="5.04">spectrum today will be about 15 to 20</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="4.65">percent faster but have a little bit</text>
  <text start="489.7" dur="3.84">less coverage and then companies that</text>
  <text start="492.28" dur="3.27">are like t-mobile that are going to be</text>
  <text start="493.54" dur="5.49">using this the television spectrum to</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="6.69">build out will be seeing more coverage</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="6.63">areas and pretty decent speeds in 5g</text>
  <text start="502.24" dur="5.91">because the lower frequencies has left</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="4.11">capability they have less capacity but</text>
  <text start="508.15" dur="4.29">they still have significantly better</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="5.67">capacity than what people see today in</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="4.35">the rural areas that are in some cases</text>
  <text start="515.44" dur="3.8">not even getting enough 4G to do</text>
  <text start="516.79" dur="4.89">anything so you&amp;#39;re saying in the more</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="3.63">urban areas you&amp;#39;re going to have kind of</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="3.87">a double-edged sword where it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="3.76">there&amp;#39;s going to be some positives but</text>
  <text start="525.55" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s definitely gonna be some</text>
  <text start="526.63" dur="5.13">negatives for certain people in certain</text>
  <text start="528.22" dur="8.04">areas I guess my question would</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="6.6">after that you know when you nationalize</text>
  <text start="536.26" dur="3.509">the network because we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="3.39">this this is the context what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.769" dur="3.481">talking about it if you if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="3.63">looking at it you know you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="543.25" dur="3.57">that it&amp;#39;s going to become more I guess</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="3.36">ubiquitous like you&amp;#39;re gonna go outside</text>
  <text start="546.82" dur="3.569">on a light pole you&amp;#39;ll see a little 5g</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="4.5">kind of like you have in your house you</text>
  <text start="550.389" dur="4.651">know you have a modem that that puts</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="3.27">Wireless in your house so in order to</text>
  <text start="555.04" dur="4.979">increase these speeds and to work on</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="5.43">these different I guess frequency</text>
  <text start="560.019" dur="4.38">spectrums they are gonna have to put in</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="4.32">more of these smaller units right so</text>
  <text start="564.399" dur="4.711">it&amp;#39;s going to become something you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="566.26" dur="5.009">gonna see more and more but what is you</text>
  <text start="569.11" dur="4.229">know nationalizing 5g what does that</text>
  <text start="571.269" dur="4.081">mean for people out in the rural areas</text>
  <text start="573.339" dur="4.021">what does that mean for a small rural</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="3.539">Internet Service Providers what what</text>
  <text start="577.36" dur="3.3">does that mean for a person like</text>
  <text start="578.889" dur="4.741">yourself you know when you&amp;#39;re going up</text>
  <text start="580.66" dur="5.429">against this kind of large machine well</text>
  <text start="583.63" dur="4.829">an analyzed broadband network like that</text>
  <text start="586.089" dur="4.201">a wireless network is obviously you know</text>
  <text start="588.459" dur="3.18">has all the earmarks of a socialist</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="4.95">system so it&amp;#39;ll be a lot of government</text>
  <text start="591.639" dur="6.091">regulations so to start with I would</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="5.52">predict seeing very inefficient</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="4.859">deployment of this network and but now</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="4.59">let me just say there&amp;#39;s not always bad</text>
  <text start="602.589" dur="5.81">with these these types of ideas so if</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="5.64">you were to have a conversation with</text>
  <text start="608.399" dur="4.291">some small to medium-sized businesses</text>
  <text start="610.99" dur="4.529">who&amp;#39;ve been wanting to get into the</text>

  <text start="664.82" dur="6.459">provider and so they&amp;#39;re kind of doing</text>
  <text start="668.01" dur="5.97">the same type of thing where mist if</text>
  <text start="671.279" dur="4.981">today I wanted to become you know Alex</text>
  <text start="673.98" dur="5.609">Phillips cellular phone company I could</text>
  <text start="676.26" dur="4.769">call up a company that I know and say</text>

  <text start="681.029" dur="4.111">certain number of phone sales per year</text>
  <text start="682.74" dur="3.99">and all of a sudden now I am a cellular</text>

  <text start="691.14" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s you know the good and the bad</text>
  <text start="692.43" dur="4.92">but with a nationalized Network then</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="5.67">what they&amp;#39;re talking about is building</text>
  <text start="697.35" dur="6.56">it specifically for that will be owned</text>
  <text start="700.83" dur="6.96">by the government and contracted to a</text>

  <text start="707.79" dur="5.34">cellular Department of cellular services</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="4.38">in any branch of government today and so</text>
  <text start="713.13" dur="3.6">for them to go out and build a cellular</text>
  <text start="714.48" dur="4.62">phone network would be ridiculous so</text>
  <text start="716.73" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;ll be it&amp;#39;ll be outsourced oh the only</text>
  <text start="719.1" dur="4.32">thing that we have very similar to that</text>
  <text start="720.63" dur="7.14">today is firstnet firstnet was a</text>
  <text start="723.42" dur="6.57">national LTE first responder network and</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="4.8">the way it was designed is there was 700</text>

  <text start="732.57" dur="6.329">megahertz band allocated to firstnet and</text>
  <text start="735.06" dur="6.12">this is all spawned from 911 you know</text>
  <text start="738.899" dur="3.661">every so many things spawns from 911</text>
  <text start="741.18" dur="4.98">where they didn&amp;#39;t have interoperability</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="5.43">and so the concept of every first</text>
  <text start="746.16" dur="5.489">responder in the nation having a</text>
  <text start="747.99" dur="6.62">ruggedized LTE cell phone smartphone in</text>
  <text start="751.649" dur="6.271">some case most cases should give them</text>
  <text start="754.61" dur="7.39">interoperability so that if a disaster</text>
  <text start="757.92" dur="6.84">occurs in New York City and first</text>
  <text start="762" dur="5.329">responders from New Jersey or you know</text>
  <text start="764.76" dur="4.59">Pennsylvania or any neighboring</text>
  <text start="767.329" dur="4.061">territories around that need to come in</text>
  <text start="769.35" dur="4.29">and help yeah if they&amp;#39;re all part of the</text>
  <text start="771.39" dur="3.93">same type of network on firstnet then</text>
  <text start="773.64" dur="3.99">they have automatic interoperability and</text>
  <text start="775.32" dur="4.38">it gives them some control over a</text>
  <text start="777.63" dur="4.23">prioritization of who has access to the</text>
  <text start="779.7" dur="4.71">network and all kinds of you know</text>
  <text start="781.86" dur="4.68">wonderful things they can do sharing</text>
  <text start="784.41" dur="5.52">data and you know things you do on your</text>
  <text start="786.54" dur="6.36">cell phone today but AT&amp;amp;T right now is</text>
  <text start="789.93" dur="5.04">the contractor primarily in the United</text>
  <text start="792.9" dur="4.2">States not everywhere because some</text>
  <text start="794.97" dur="2.99">states have not adopted the first met</text>
  <text start="797.1" dur="2.56">program</text>
  <text start="797.96" dur="5.1">the closest thing to a nation</text>
  <text start="799.66" dur="5.77">nationalized 4G network right now but it</text>
  <text start="803.06" dur="4.35">was specifically designed for first</text>
  <text start="805.43" dur="4.71">responders but it does have a secondary</text>
  <text start="807.41" dur="7.41">use where if if I for example wanted to</text>
  <text start="810.14" dur="7.5">contract with firstnet to buy off or</text>
  <text start="814.82" dur="3.27">rent or lease excess capacity on their</text>
  <text start="817.64" dur="3.66">network</text>
  <text start="818.09" dur="4.92">I can sell phones on that network when</text>
  <text start="821.3" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s a disaster though all my phones</text>
  <text start="823.01" dur="5.58">go offline and only first responders</text>
  <text start="825.17" dur="5.7">will have priority so yeah that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="828.59" dur="4.08">one of the things but I just you know</text>
  <text start="830.87" dur="4.26">Politico did a follow up story the next</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="4.68">day they got information from the White</text>
  <text start="835.13" dur="5.16">House that basically stated that you</text>
  <text start="837.35" dur="5.97">know that the Trump 2020 campaign was</text>

  <text start="843.32" dur="5.01">of their campaign donors Peter Thiel and</text>
  <text start="846.14" dur="3.63">so that that&amp;#39;s actually a good point for</text>
  <text start="848.33" dur="2.82">me to jump in on because that is</text>
  <text start="849.77" dur="4.35">something I want to talk to you let me</text>
  <text start="851.15" dur="3.81">read to you this tweet from President</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="3.6">Trump and I just want to get your</text>
  <text start="854.96" dur="5.16">reaction on it because and and later we</text>
  <text start="857.72" dur="5.19">are going to discuss kind of the you</text>
  <text start="860.12" dur="4.29">know in brief you know what kind of</text>
  <text start="862.91" dur="2.37">health effect dangers that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="864.41" dur="2.76">because I know a lot of people out there</text>
  <text start="865.28" dur="3.51">want to talk about that and they want to</text>
  <text start="867.17" dur="2.79">hear about it but I just want to read</text>
  <text start="868.79" dur="5.01">this tweet to you from President Trump</text>
  <text start="869.96" dur="5.64">he says quote I want 5g and even 6g</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="3.78">technology in the United States as soon</text>
  <text start="875.6" dur="4.53">as possible it is far more powerful</text>
  <text start="877.58" dur="4.38">faster and smarter than the current</text>
  <text start="880.13" dur="4.14">standard American companies must step up</text>
  <text start="881.96" dur="4.02">their efforts or get left behind there</text>
  <text start="884.27" dur="4.38">is no reason that we should be lagging</text>
  <text start="885.98" dur="4.74">behind on something that is so obviously</text>
  <text start="888.65" dur="4.56">the future I want the United States to</text>
  <text start="890.72" dur="5.01">win through competition not by blocking</text>
  <text start="893.21" dur="4.26">out currently more advanced technologies</text>
  <text start="895.73" dur="3.24">we must always be the leader in</text>
  <text start="897.47" dur="2.94">everything we do especially when it</text>
  <text start="898.97" dur="3.96">comes to the very exciting world</text>
  <text start="900.41" dur="3.63">technology now I know that that goes to</text>
  <text start="902.93" dur="2.61">your point that you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="904.04" dur="3.09">really advocating against five do you</text>
  <text start="905.54" dur="3.68">you&amp;#39;re advocating against nationalizing</text>
  <text start="907.13" dur="5.94">it and turning it into a socialistic</text>
  <text start="909.22" dur="5.71">type of program so but can you can you</text>
  <text start="913.07" dur="6.15">just give a comment on that in general</text>
  <text start="914.93" dur="6.2">well so um so my position I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="919.22" dur="4.08">excuse me I don&amp;#39;t wanna interrupt but</text>
  <text start="921.13" dur="3.37">but then that goes into Peter Thiel and</text>
  <text start="923.3" dur="3.12">what we were talking about and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="924.5" dur="3.99">kind of where I&amp;#39;m going with that so I</text>
  <text start="926.42" dur="4.82">have a multi-faceted perception and</text>
  <text start="928.49" dur="7.129">opinion about the 5g</text>
  <text start="931.24" dur="6.139">so President Trump is eager to make</text>
  <text start="935.619" dur="4.26">business in the United States grow</text>
  <text start="937.379" dur="5.74">innovation he would like to see more</text>
  <text start="939.879" dur="4.32">economic growth and so the numbers that</text>
  <text start="943.119" dur="2.52">have been presented to the</text>
  <text start="944.199" dur="4.62">administration and to the Federal</text>
  <text start="945.639" dur="5.521">Communications Commission by the by</text>
  <text start="948.819" dur="4.14">another Wireless Association that</text>
  <text start="951.16" dur="6.269">represents the site or phone industry is</text>
  <text start="952.959" dur="7.951">that they&amp;#39;re predicting 275 billion</text>
  <text start="957.429" dur="6.621">dollars in investment from 5g the</text>
  <text start="960.91" dur="7.95">creation of three million new jobs and</text>
  <text start="964.05" dur="8.199">five hundred billion dollar impact to</text>
  <text start="968.86" dur="6.38">the GDP well those are amazing numbers</text>
  <text start="972.249" dur="4.861">you know three million new jobs</text>
  <text start="975.24" dur="5.289">definitely falls in line with president</text>
  <text start="977.11" dur="6.779">Trump&amp;#39;s agenda economic growth obviously</text>
  <text start="980.529" dur="9.81">and investing in America again all those</text>
  <text start="983.889" dur="8.61">fall in line and so companies like Peter</text>
  <text start="990.339" dur="3.99">teals company this is called rubato</text>
  <text start="992.499" dur="5.55">networks you know see this is an</text>
  <text start="994.329" dur="6.841">opportunity to be able to build networks</text>
  <text start="998.049" dur="7.941">in areas that maybe the big carriers</text>
  <text start="1001.17" dur="7.379">won&amp;#39;t do as a subcontractor but by</text>
  <text start="1005.99" dur="5.379">standardizing the type of 5g that&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1008.549" dur="4.77">build that nationwide and I think that</text>
  <text start="1011.369" dur="6.121">they thought that presenting this to the</text>
  <text start="1013.319" dur="5.341">administration in the same way that you</text>
  <text start="1017.49" dur="2.009">know the administration wants to see</text>
  <text start="1018.66" dur="3.239">bridges built</text>
  <text start="1019.499" dur="4.65">and rose improved you know they would</text>
  <text start="1021.899" dur="3.571">become you know those cut that company</text>
  <text start="1024.149" dur="4.56">that would come in and do something on</text>
  <text start="1025.47" dur="6.119">behalf of the government to ensure that</text>
  <text start="1028.709" dur="5.791">whatever happens happens for everybody</text>
  <text start="1031.589" dur="5.46">in the country and spurs on this</text>
  <text start="1034.5" dur="4.529">economic growth but you know I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1037.049" dur="3.931">you know I&amp;#39;ve had my experiences in the</text>
  <text start="1039.029" dur="3.75">past with you know wholesale type</text>
  <text start="1040.98" dur="3.78">services like that and you know the good</text>
  <text start="1042.779" dur="3.361">and the bad the good is that you know</text>
  <text start="1044.76" dur="4.409">you&amp;#39;re not investing a tremendously</text>
  <text start="1046.14" dur="7.23">large amount of money and but the bad is</text>
  <text start="1049.169" dur="8.071">is that you&amp;#39;re necessarily comes to your</text>
  <text start="1053.37" dur="6.63">relationship with the network and so yes</text>
  <text start="1057.24" dur="5.399">for small businesses III would HIGHLY</text>
  <text start="1060" dur="4.7">not recommend supporting a nationalized</text>
  <text start="1062.639" dur="4.251">5g Network because of that</text>
  <text start="1064.7" dur="3.93">one reason that it&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1066.89" dur="4.65">going to be good for business in the</text>
  <text start="1068.63" dur="4.65">long term I think it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a good it</text>
  <text start="1071.54" dur="3.03">sounds good on paper and it sounds good</text>
  <text start="1073.28" dur="4.68">when it&amp;#39;s being presented but I think in</text>
  <text start="1074.57" dur="4.74">the long run competition in the industry</text>
  <text start="1077.96" dur="4.02">is what really is gonna make it and</text>
  <text start="1079.31" dur="4.08">drive it okay so to that point first off</text>
  <text start="1081.98" dur="3.06">for reference for everyone out there is</text>
  <text start="1083.39" dur="3.93">watching doesn&amp;#39;t know Peter teal is</text>
  <text start="1085.04" dur="5.19">actually one of the initial investors in</text>
  <text start="1087.32" dur="6.81">Facebook very wealthy and PayPal and</text>
  <text start="1090.23" dur="5.52">PayPal correct and this this is a donor</text>
  <text start="1094.13" dur="3.39">to the Trump campaign so obviously he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1095.75" dur="3.39">been able to bend the ear of people near</text>
  <text start="1097.52" dur="3.42">President Trump or if not Trump himself</text>
  <text start="1099.14" dur="4.23">so it is something to take into</text>
  <text start="1100.94" dur="4.29">consideration but more overly to the</text>
  <text start="1103.37" dur="3.93">point that you were just making so when</text>
  <text start="1105.23" dur="6">you see a company like AT&amp;amp;T going out</text>
  <text start="1107.3" dur="6.18">and picking up all these 700 megahertz</text>
  <text start="1111.23" dur="3.99">spectrum licenses do you feel that</text>
  <text start="1113.48" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s just them trying to re-establish</text>
  <text start="1115.22" dur="5.01">a monopoly well yeah I mean AT&amp;amp;T has</text>
  <text start="1118.37" dur="4.91">been you know if you go back far enough</text>
  <text start="1120.23" dur="5.58">in time into the 80s you know AT&amp;amp;T was</text>
  <text start="1123.28" dur="5.02">Ma Bell they were them enough they were</text>
  <text start="1125.81" dur="3.78">the monopoly in telecommunications now</text>
  <text start="1128.3" dur="3.24">they were in the days when you had to</text>
  <text start="1129.59" dur="4.56">pay you know a tremendously large amount</text>
  <text start="1131.54" dur="5.16">of money for a phone call plus long</text>
  <text start="1134.15" dur="5.55">distance could literally brand bankrupt</text>
  <text start="1136.7" dur="5.31">you and in an 80s they got broke up and</text>
  <text start="1139.7" dur="4.62">you know we have there the various you</text>
  <text start="1142.01" dur="5.07">know we have AT&amp;amp;T long distance you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1144.32" dur="6.27">got AT&amp;amp;T which is in some cases still a</text>
  <text start="1147.08" dur="6.24">phone company and then your bells that</text>
  <text start="1150.59" dur="5.4">broke up into your Verizon&amp;#39;s your GTEs</text>
  <text start="1153.32" dur="5.91">that kind of stuff and so you know all</text>
  <text start="1155.99" dur="5.7">this stuff got addressed but you know</text>
  <text start="1159.23" dur="7.62">they still want to become the dominant</text>
  <text start="1161.69" dur="7.95">player and so Wireless is obviously you</text>
  <text start="1166.85" dur="6.03">know a big thing I mean everybody&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="1169.64" dur="6.78">a cell phone my first cell phone was a</text>
  <text start="1172.88" dur="5.73">bagging phone and it was tremendously</text>
  <text start="1176.42" dur="3.21">expensive to use although I thought it</text>
  <text start="1178.61" dur="4.38">was the coolest thing in the world</text>
  <text start="1179.63" dur="5.19">because I could go out on an island in</text>
  <text start="1182.99" dur="4.41">the middle of the James River and make a</text>
  <text start="1184.82" dur="5.12">phone call you know that was really cool</text>
  <text start="1187.4" dur="5.37">I was like the brick cell phone almost</text>
  <text start="1189.94" dur="4.57">well before the bricks this was like</text>
  <text start="1192.77" dur="3.71">this is like that yeah this is like one</text>
  <text start="1194.51" dur="4.16">of those days</text>
  <text start="1196.48" dur="6.12">you know man-purse with my phone pulled</text>
  <text start="1198.67" dur="5.58">out of it you know but um you know since</text>
  <text start="1202.6" dur="3.18">I mean it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s two sides of it</text>
  <text start="1204.25" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re looking at this</text>
  <text start="1205.78" dur="2.97">nationalization saying you know that</text>
  <text start="1207.55" dur="3.75">could lead to some really negative</text>
  <text start="1208.75" dur="4.47">effects on smaller businesses and the</text>
  <text start="1211.3" dur="2.94">competition in the industry itself and</text>
  <text start="1213.22" dur="2.37">then we&amp;#39;re looking at the other side</text>
  <text start="1214.24" dur="3.15">where we have these big companies who</text>
  <text start="1215.59" dur="4.94">are trying to re-establish these</text>
  <text start="1217.39" dur="5.52">strongholds and strangleholds on the UH</text>
  <text start="1220.53" dur="5.17">basically to limit the competition that</text>
  <text start="1222.91" dur="6.23">they have to go up against so with that</text>
  <text start="1225.7" dur="3.44">being said do you think that</text>
  <text start="1229.51" dur="4.049">there is room for like what is the</text>
  <text start="1231.73" dur="5.52">balancing point between those two and</text>
  <text start="1233.559" dur="6.181">you in your view well I mean I I think</text>
  <text start="1237.25" dur="4.679">that you know the the large carriers are</text>
  <text start="1239.74" dur="3.899">definitely well suited to build out</text>
  <text start="1241.929" dur="3.391">mobile networks better than anything</text>
  <text start="1243.639" dur="5.661">anybody else they would be better than</text>
  <text start="1245.32" dur="6.44">any government controlled</text>
  <text start="1249.3" dur="3.9">entity I think that you know in in the</text>
  <text start="1251.76" dur="3.78">end that you know these companies</text>
  <text start="1253.2" dur="4.44">companies that want to push this company</text>
  <text start="1255.54" dur="4.71">Avada networks I think they have you</text>
  <text start="1257.64" dur="5">know an ulterior motive in my opinion of</text>
  <text start="1260.25" dur="4.47">wanting to be the nationwide provider</text>
  <text start="1262.64" dur="4.27">given the nature of what we know about</text>
  <text start="1264.72" dur="3.51">mobile networks today and we could talk</text>
  <text start="1266.91" dur="3.3">a little bit about that more detail but</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="3.84">you know the idea that you know</text>
  <text start="1270.21" dur="3.54">commercial business is the way to go is</text>
  <text start="1272.07" dur="5.01">definitely I think in the long run the</text>
  <text start="1273.75" dur="6.45">best option and this war between US and</text>
  <text start="1277.08" dur="5.19">China regarding you know 5g technology</text>
  <text start="1280.2" dur="7.26">well you know yes the United States is</text>
  <text start="1282.27" dur="6.45">way behind these Innis and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1287.46" dur="3.81">and I hate to say this way because I</text>
  <text start="1288.72" dur="4.71">want to leave in the in democracy I</text>
  <text start="1291.27" dur="5.46">believe in the Republic but when you</text>
  <text start="1293.43" dur="6.27">have a government entity like in China</text>
  <text start="1296.73" dur="5.16">or in Korea making most of the decisions</text>
  <text start="1299.7" dur="4.14">and there isn&amp;#39;t really a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="1301.89" dur="3.9">public input and various agencies</text>
  <text start="1303.84" dur="5.28">involved or corporations making</text>
  <text start="1305.79" dur="6.69">decisions then you can focus on one</text>
  <text start="1309.12" dur="4.71">target a lot easier so in that respect</text>
  <text start="1312.48" dur="6.41">they&amp;#39;re a little bit ahead of the game</text>
  <text start="1313.83" dur="7.26">but you know the United States is a</text>
  <text start="1318.89" dur="4.36">juggernaut in that respect and</text>
  <text start="1321.09" dur="4.44">commercial businesses and commercial</text>
  <text start="1323.25" dur="4.92">ventures in our country that will</text>
  <text start="1325.53" dur="5.46">develop innovation I think in the end</text>
  <text start="1328.17" dur="4.86">will rise way above it and will zoom</text>
  <text start="1330.99" dur="3.42">past it so yeah we&amp;#39;re a little bit on a</text>
  <text start="1333.03" dur="4.14">slow start right now but we pioneered</text>
  <text start="1334.41" dur="3.63">you know a lot of technologies and a lot</text>
  <text start="1337.17" dur="3.78">of these countries wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1338.04" dur="6.12">anything and it wasn&amp;#39;t for leadership at</text>
  <text start="1340.95" dur="5.61">the FCC from the United States so yeah</text>
  <text start="1344.16" dur="6.27">that&amp;#39;s sort of it behind so speaking of</text>
  <text start="1346.56" dur="6.12">the FCC do you think it&amp;#39;s fair that they</text>
  <text start="1350.43" dur="5.09">have been basically accused of picking</text>
  <text start="1352.68" dur="6.3">winners and losers in this in these</text>
  <text start="1355.52" dur="5.32">areas didn&amp;#39;t could you just elaborate on</text>
  <text start="1358.98" dur="4.11">that a little bit oh I I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1360.84" dur="3.93">very fair assessment to accuse the FCC</text>
  <text start="1363.09" dur="3.57">of picking winners losers and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1364.77" dur="3.54">couple of different reasons for that you</text>
  <text start="1366.66" dur="3.9">know there&amp;#39;s the fact that you know</text>
  <text start="1368.31" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re a regulatory agency that needs</text>
  <text start="1370.56" dur="6.51">to regulate companies and so this is a</text>
  <text start="1373.26" dur="6.81">very highly sophisticated fast-paced you</text>
  <text start="1377.07" dur="6.93">know fast-moving industry and so is in</text>
  <text start="1380.07" dur="5.94">their best interest from a managerial</text>
  <text start="1384" dur="6.33">perspective or regulatory perspective to</text>
  <text start="1386.01" dur="7.68">regulate less companies um however their</text>
  <text start="1390.33" dur="5.37">mandate is to do something that&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="1393.69" dur="3.41">best interest of the public and so I</text>
  <text start="1395.7" dur="4.43">think that you know they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1397.1" dur="5.71">hoodwinked a little bit right now by 5g</text>
  <text start="1400.13" dur="4.57">and I&amp;#39;ve made I make comments on Twitter</text>
  <text start="1402.81" dur="6.36">about this and I filed public comments</text>
  <text start="1404.7" dur="6.32">the FCC about this that during this</text>
  <text start="1409.17" dur="5.76">process</text>
  <text start="1411.02" dur="6.73">5g kind of became this you know thing</text>
  <text start="1414.93" dur="6.48">that did everything that cured all ills</text>
  <text start="1417.75" dur="6.169">so to speak and I&amp;#39;ve been to this before</text>
  <text start="1421.41" dur="5.519">you know this is not the first time that</text>
  <text start="1423.919" dur="5.14">sensationalism took over this CIA</text>
  <text start="1426.929" dur="4.591">technology and made everybody believe</text>
  <text start="1429.059" dur="6.301">that it was going to be the solution for</text>
  <text start="1431.52" dur="6.87">all things you know early 2000 there was</text>
  <text start="1435.36" dur="5.52">this thing called WiMAX and I remember</text>
  <text start="1438.39" dur="4.289">going to my very first WiMAX seminar and</text>
  <text start="1440.88" dur="4.5">listening to what they had to say and</text>
  <text start="1442.679" dur="5.191">scratching my head and saying I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1445.38" dur="3.72">get it you guys are talking a good game</text>
  <text start="1447.87" dur="3.059">but I don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="1449.1" dur="9.319">and next thing I know for the next five</text>
  <text start="1450.929" dur="10.411">years my max is going to solve problems</text>
  <text start="1458.419" dur="5.89">it&amp;#39;s going to enable business growth</text>
  <text start="1461.34" dur="5.969">it&amp;#39;s going to create jobs and it&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1464.309" dur="5.521">is my max why max was just like - yeah</text>
  <text start="1467.309" dur="7.891">why not use the technology it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1469.83" dur="8.13">there&amp;#39;s Wi-Fi there&amp;#39;s LTE and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1475.2" dur="5.4">WiMAX and then there are various other</text>
  <text start="1477.96" dur="4.25">variants of wireless type technologies</text>
  <text start="1480.6" dur="4.699">that do different things</text>
  <text start="1482.21" dur="6.579">SCADA for example a very low speed</text>
  <text start="1485.299" dur="5.981">wireless technology but WiMAX was just a</text>
  <text start="1488.789" dur="6.031">buzz term of a wireless technology that</text>
  <text start="1491.28" dur="4.74">is now completely debunked so to speak</text>
  <text start="1494.82" dur="6.3">because it wasn&amp;#39;t that great</text>
  <text start="1496.02" dur="6.99">Oh LTE is a wireless technology that has</text>
  <text start="1501.12" dur="4.65">been pretty great and it&amp;#39;s been great</text>
  <text start="1503.01" dur="5.039">but it&amp;#39;s been specific to license</text>
  <text start="1505.77" dur="4.56">technology Morais and spectrum so</text>
  <text start="1508.049" dur="4.981">companies that own their own spectrum</text>
  <text start="1510.33" dur="5.729">gray we&amp;#39;re on LTE and it runs really</text>
  <text start="1513.03" dur="5.16">great Wi-Fi has been designed to run on</text>
  <text start="1516.059" dur="5.761">unlicensed spectrum and it runs really</text>
  <text start="1518.19" dur="5.63">great but if you put LTE on an</text>
  <text start="1521.82" dur="4.62">unlicensed spectrum it runs really bad</text>
  <text start="1523.82" dur="4.9">and you have to modify it to be able to</text>
  <text start="1526.44" dur="6.03">do the things that Wi-Fi does to be able</text>
  <text start="1528.72" dur="6.27">to deal with cold coexistence so so the</text>
  <text start="1532.47" dur="6.18">when 5 G&amp;#39;s started hitting the pavement</text>
  <text start="1534.99" dur="6.48">and making all these claims basically</text>
  <text start="1538.65" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve gotten the FCC&amp;#39;s heads been and</text>
  <text start="1541.47" dur="4.68">around with the fact that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1543.24" dur="5.34">to create you know 3 million jobs have a</text>
  <text start="1546.15" dur="5.519">500 billion dollar impact to the GDP and</text>
  <text start="1548.58" dur="5.28">spur 275 billion dollars in investment</text>
  <text start="1551.669" dur="3.721">they&amp;#39;re going to create</text>
  <text start="1553.86" dur="4.98">all this new technology you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1555.39" dur="5.22">have doctors operating on people over</text>
  <text start="1558.84" dur="4.11">great distances with robots</text>
  <text start="1560.61" dur="5.85">you&amp;#39;re going to have self-driving cars</text>
  <text start="1562.95" dur="7.31">that can you know anticipate accidents</text>
  <text start="1566.46" dur="7.65">and not crash as much you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="1570.26" dur="5.95">people at NASCAR being able to take</text>
  <text start="1574.11" dur="4.14">their phone and popping it into a little</text>
  <text start="1576.21" dur="4.14">headset and being sitting in the</text>
  <text start="1578.25" dur="5.07">driver&amp;#39;s seat or the passenger seat of</text>
  <text start="1580.35" dur="5.1">their favorite NASCAR driver you know</text>
  <text start="1583.32" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re creating all this stuff all</text>
  <text start="1585.45" dur="4.5">these things that all of a sudden 5g is</text>
  <text start="1588.24" dur="3.54">the only thing that can answer these</text>
  <text start="1589.95" dur="3.71">problems which is not true it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1591.78" dur="5.46">completely not true as a matter of fact</text>
  <text start="1593.66" dur="6.31">there&amp;#39;s a lot of Wi-Fi is the technology</text>
  <text start="1597.24" dur="5.3">there&amp;#39;s something called Wi-Fi six that</text>
  <text start="1599.97" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s very good and fast but you know</text>
  <text start="1602.54" dur="3.94">most of the people representing Wi-Fi</text>
  <text start="1605.01" dur="4.35">our small businesses and most of the</text>
  <text start="1606.48" dur="5.31">people representing LTE are really big</text>
  <text start="1609.36" dur="4.02">businesses I mean you know it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1611.79" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s just a big difference and so the</text>
  <text start="1613.38" dur="3.69">people that are getting that attention</text>
  <text start="1615.15" dur="3.99">are the people that can that have that</text>
  <text start="1617.07" dur="4.56">you know they&amp;#39;ve spent five million</text>
  <text start="1619.14" dur="4.32">dollars a quarter in lobbying and you</text>
  <text start="1621.63" dur="4.44">know 50 billion dollar 50 million</text>
  <text start="1623.46" dur="5.67">dollars a year in advertising for a</text>
  <text start="1626.07" dur="4.77">technology it gets over behind it so</text>
  <text start="1629.13" dur="4.41">like you know we were talking about this</text>
  <text start="1630.84" dur="4.53">before I think that I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1633.54" dur="3.09">very interesting and it just points to</text>
  <text start="1635.37" dur="2.939">the fact there&amp;#39;s other technologies that</text>
  <text start="1636.63" dur="4.919">out there that can do similar things and</text>
  <text start="1638.309" dur="5.011">this 5g won&amp;#39;t be the savior of all or</text>
  <text start="1641.549" dur="4.561">the end-all be-all you know as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1643.32" dur="5.91">trying to sell it now we talked</text>
  <text start="1646.11" dur="5.22">previously about the fiber optic cable</text>
  <text start="1649.23" dur="4.5">way and getting internet to rural</text>
  <text start="1651.33" dur="5.07">communities and the initiatives that</text>
  <text start="1653.73" dur="4.74">were brought forward and that were put</text>
  <text start="1656.4" dur="3.12">into action and how you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1658.47" dur="5.089">that is kind of fallen to the wayside</text>
  <text start="1659.52" dur="6.33">now with the expansion of the 4G 5g so</text>
  <text start="1663.559" dur="4.061">what do you think do you think that that</text>
  <text start="1665.85" dur="4.23">5g and all this is going to eventually</text>
  <text start="1667.62" dur="4.41">be overtaken by another technology this</text>
  <text start="1670.08" dur="5.01">we just a kind of a pointless endeavor</text>
  <text start="1672.03" dur="7.649">or what what is your overall thought on</text>
  <text start="1675.09" dur="6.089">that well so um during the Obama</text>
  <text start="1679.679" dur="3.661">administration there was this thing</text>
  <text start="1681.179" dur="3.901">called a stimulus program and the idea</text>
  <text start="1683.34" dur="4.38">there was to get broadband out in rural</text>
  <text start="1685.08" dur="5.819">areas and</text>
  <text start="1687.72" dur="7.77">they they spent quite a bit of money</text>
  <text start="1690.899" dur="7.071">doing that and many many people realized</text>
  <text start="1695.49" dur="5.309">because I know companies like mine and</text>
  <text start="1697.97" dur="5.35">organizations like whisper we basically</text>
  <text start="1700.799" dur="4.171">said that you know Wireless was a better</text>
  <text start="1703.32" dur="3.51">technology when it comes to rural</text>
  <text start="1704.97" dur="3.87">deployment because you can basically put</text>
  <text start="1706.83" dur="4.29">in an Access Point and cover 15 mile</text>
  <text start="1708.84" dur="4.289">radius but with fiber you&amp;#39;ve got to run</text>
  <text start="1711.12" dur="5.189">you know very expensive fiber that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1713.129" dur="5.191">that costs anywhere from two thousand to</text>
  <text start="1716.309" dur="4.71">ten thousand dollars of past home and</text>
  <text start="1718.32" dur="4.199">with wireless it&amp;#39;s you know somewhere</text>
  <text start="1721.019" dur="5.88">the neighborhood of one hundred two</text>
  <text start="1722.519" dur="7.14">hundred dollars of past home um but the</text>
  <text start="1726.899" dur="4.441">phone companies and I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this</text>
  <text start="1729.659" dur="5.64">you know a lot of people the phone</text>
  <text start="1731.34" dur="8.88">companies think almost to the degree of</text>
  <text start="1735.299" dur="9.26">this tectonic plate timeframes they they</text>
  <text start="1740.22" dur="7.38">plan things in 10 20 50 year time</text>
  <text start="1744.559" dur="3.37">timeframes and so they plan for the long</text>
  <text start="1747.6" dur="4.049">game</text>
  <text start="1747.929" dur="5.071">so the ARA the stimulus program during</text>
  <text start="1751.649" dur="3.421">the about ministration really got all</text>
  <text start="1753" dur="4.529">these carriers fiber into the places</text>
  <text start="1755.07" dur="4.949">that they want but now they want</text>
  <text start="1757.529" dur="5.28">Wireless because Wireless is the way to</text>
  <text start="1760.019" dur="5.941">go and so 5g is the the now the</text>
  <text start="1762.809" dur="6.33">technology to get the last mile in most</text>
  <text start="1765.96" dur="7.29">places if you look at DC and Richmond</text>
  <text start="1769.139" dur="8.01">and you know Dallas Texas you know like</text>
  <text start="1773.25" dur="6.5">I said big cities fiber is a really good</text>
  <text start="1777.149" dur="7.74">solution because you&amp;#39;re passing you know</text>
  <text start="1779.75" dur="8.139">20 you know 250 homes or units living</text>
  <text start="1784.889" dur="4.471">units per block and so your cost for</text>
  <text start="1787.889" dur="3.191">deployment is so much cheaper and once</text>
  <text start="1789.36" dur="3.46">it&amp;#39;s in it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1791.08" dur="3.9">but when you&amp;#39;re in a rural area and</text>
  <text start="1792.82" dur="4.28">you&amp;#39;re passing a home every you know</text>
  <text start="1794.98" dur="5.69">five miles</text>
  <text start="1797.1" dur="5.55">it gets really expensive so the this</text>
  <text start="1800.67" dur="5.76">wireless technology is really definitely</text>
  <text start="1802.65" dur="6.27">hitting off and with 5g they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1806.43" dur="5.76">implement lots of things that they</text>
  <text start="1808.92" dur="6.99">realize that 4G was failing in like for</text>
  <text start="1812.19" dur="5.85">example Verizon tried to do fixed</text>
  <text start="1815.91" dur="4.08">wireless over there 4G and what they</text>
  <text start="1818.04" dur="4.14">realized is that when they installed</text>
  <text start="1819.99" dur="4.59">somebody with one of their little bucket</text>
  <text start="1822.18" dur="5.4">antenna systems looking a five-gallon</text>
  <text start="1824.58" dur="5.04">bucket it was generally a person that</text>
  <text start="1827.58" dur="5.37">was in a rural area that was just about</text>
  <text start="1829.62" dur="5.94">as far away as the limitations of that</text>
  <text start="1832.95" dur="5.31">particular of transmitter is gonna work</text>
  <text start="1835.56" dur="5.73">and are gonna be the heaviest user and</text>
  <text start="1838.26" dur="4.71">so when when you know you get a college</text>
  <text start="1841.29" dur="3.45">student for example or a high school</text>
  <text start="1842.97" dur="4.02">student for example that&amp;#39;s living you</text>
  <text start="1844.74" dur="4.17">know five miles from the tower and they</text>
  <text start="1846.99" dur="5.61">are the heaviest user on that network</text>
  <text start="1848.91" dur="5.49">everybody everybody feels it because it</text>
  <text start="1852.6" dur="3.63">causes the network to not be able to</text>
  <text start="1854.4" dur="4.14">operate quite as well because it has to</text>
  <text start="1856.23" dur="4.53">accommodate for the almost for the</text>
  <text start="1858.54" dur="5.31">weakest link in the entire chain of that</text>
  <text start="1860.76" dur="4.68">network there&amp;#39;s a true proportion there</text>
  <text start="1863.85" dur="4.26">like you could be in a rural community</text>
  <text start="1865.44" dur="5.37">and have somebody using that at the end</text>
  <text start="1868.11" dur="5.25">of it who&amp;#39;s using the most and they</text>
  <text start="1870.81" dur="4.2">actually affect the others well yeah you</text>
  <text start="1873.36" dur="3.93">see even in cable networks and when they</text>
  <text start="1875.01" dur="3.81">started offering when Comcast and other</text>
  <text start="1877.29" dur="3">companies start offering a hundred two</text>
  <text start="1878.82" dur="4.59">hundred three hundred megabits service</text>
  <text start="1880.29" dur="4.62">you know it was usually that one kid in</text>
  <text start="1883.41" dur="3">the neighborhood that brought down</text>
  <text start="1884.91" dur="3.48">entire network</text>
  <text start="1886.41" dur="4.26">so you know it&amp;#39;s incredible that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1888.39" dur="3.69">encouraged it&amp;#39;s also it&amp;#39;s even worse</text>
  <text start="1890.67" dur="5.13">because it has to do with a combination</text>
  <text start="1892.08" dur="5.37">of usage link rates you know and link</text>
  <text start="1895.8" dur="3.6">rates are then attributed to how much</text>
  <text start="1897.45" dur="5.55">signal the person has so if the person</text>
  <text start="1899.4" dur="6.72">is the weakest signal and they have the</text>
  <text start="1903" dur="5.52">most demand it has a negative impact on</text>
  <text start="1906.12" dur="6.39">everybody on that particular sector now</text>
  <text start="1908.52" dur="6.09">LTE has some tools to address that to a</text>
  <text start="1912.51" dur="3.66">certain degree but given the volume of</text>
  <text start="1914.61" dur="3.33">users and the people coming in and out</text>
  <text start="1916.17" dur="3.48">of networks it just turned out to be</text>
  <text start="1917.94" dur="3.3">really bad in fact I get a lot of</text>
  <text start="1919.65" dur="5.31">business for people that have rice and</text>
  <text start="1921.24" dur="5.25">home service now a home fusion they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1924.96" dur="2.82">call me up and they&amp;#39;ll say I just need</text>
  <text start="1926.49" dur="3.6">something better because it was really</text>
  <text start="1927.78" dur="3.06">great when I got it and now it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1930.09" dur="2.159">terrible</text>
  <text start="1930.84" dur="3.65">and that&amp;#39;s just generally how it worked</text>
  <text start="1932.249" dur="5.451">so that&amp;#39;s why they dropped that product</text>
  <text start="1934.49" dur="6.759">but 5g they&amp;#39;re gonna try to address that</text>
  <text start="1937.7" dur="5.109">a little bit by the fact that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1941.249" dur="4.56">got a lot more spectrum to work with so</text>
  <text start="1942.809" dur="5.22">they can segment you know users a little</text>
  <text start="1945.809" dur="6.031">bit better and that&amp;#39;s just you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1948.029" dur="5.61">just physics and math and and technology</text>
  <text start="1951.84" dur="3.87">in general so we know I have we have the</text>
  <text start="1953.639" dur="3.51">same issue in my industry with wireless</text>
  <text start="1955.71" dur="3.87">network so we have minimum signal</text>
  <text start="1957.149" dur="5.88">requirements so that if somebody is you</text>
  <text start="1959.58" dur="4.799">know has a certain weak signal because a</text>
  <text start="1963.029" dur="4.26">tree is growing up in the path and</text>
  <text start="1964.379" dur="5.731">they&amp;#39;re a heavy user we go see them move</text>
  <text start="1967.289" dur="4.321">their antenna cut their tree or you know</text>
  <text start="1970.11" dur="3.21">tell them they have to get service</text>
  <text start="1971.61" dur="4.11">elsewhere or try to put them into a</text>
  <text start="1973.32" dur="4.199">different sector we do everything we</text>
  <text start="1975.72" dur="3.48">possibly can but it&amp;#39;s just a lot of</text>
  <text start="1977.519" dur="3.571">different things with wireless that you</text>
  <text start="1979.2" dur="5.52">know the cellular industry has to deal</text>
  <text start="1981.09" dur="5.669">with that the fiber doesn&amp;#39;t right and</text>
  <text start="1984.72" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s your business is that you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1986.759" dur="5.341">the president of the wireless internet</text>
  <text start="1988.71" dur="4.829">service provider association and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1992.1" dur="3.569">been working in this industry for how</text>
  <text start="1993.539" dur="4.321">long Oh quite some time I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1995.669" dur="5.58">put a date on it but I&amp;#39;m in the internet</text>
  <text start="1997.86" dur="5.789">business since 95 so I&amp;#39;ve seen it from</text>
  <text start="2001.249" dur="5.4">the infancy you know when when they were</text>
  <text start="2003.649" dur="4.74">all dial-up and yeah we&amp;#39;re here yeah and</text>
  <text start="2006.649" dur="3.89">it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s been a very interesting</text>
  <text start="2008.389" dur="4.89">ride I&amp;#39;ve seen just about everything</text>
  <text start="2010.539" dur="5.411">that&amp;#39;s pretty incredible so now let me</text>
  <text start="2013.279" dur="5.28">let me I&amp;#39;ve kind of saved this topic for</text>
  <text start="2015.95" dur="6.15">near the end here because I know that</text>
  <text start="2018.559" dur="5.1">that we we&amp;#39;re both not medical doctors</text>
  <text start="2022.1" dur="5.49">so it&amp;#39;s hard for us to really give</text>
  <text start="2023.659" dur="6.791">medical opinions but there is this this</text>
  <text start="2027.59" dur="4.6">overwhelming</text>
  <text start="2030.45" dur="2.7">sentiment among a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="2032.19" dur="3.48">there and probably a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2033.15" dur="6.18">watching this show and it&amp;#39;s almost this</text>
  <text start="2035.67" dur="5.28">this fear of 5g it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a fear of what</text>
  <text start="2039.33" dur="5.49">it could do what it could be what the</text>
  <text start="2040.95" dur="5.34">health effects are now I know that you</text>
  <text start="2044.82" dur="3.87">have a good idea about a lot of this</text>
  <text start="2046.29" dur="3.81">stuff and just in the technology in</text>
  <text start="2048.69" dur="3.03">itself how that works</text>
  <text start="2050.1" dur="4.44">so why don&amp;#39;t you talk us through a</text>
  <text start="2051.72" dur="6.03">little bit about what you see that the</text>
  <text start="2054.54" dur="6">possible dangers of 5g could be and how</text>
  <text start="2057.75" dur="7.32">those are being mitigated right now well</text>
  <text start="2060.54" dur="7.05">the the existence of the 5g in their</text>
  <text start="2065.07" dur="5.34">current spectrum I don&amp;#39;t think that you</text>
  <text start="2067.59" dur="4.62">know once you see 5g implemented in the</text>
  <text start="2070.41" dur="3">the frequencies that they have today I</text>
  <text start="2072.21" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re gonna see a whole lot</text>
  <text start="2073.41" dur="3.18">of difference and again let me just</text>
  <text start="2075.33" dur="3.51">preface this that I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2076.59" dur="6.12">necessarily an expert at the effects of</text>
  <text start="2078.84" dur="6.27">radiation but they do classify this as</text>
  <text start="2082.71" dur="6.38">non ionizing radiation and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2085.11" dur="3.98">supposedly not dangerous however</text>
  <text start="2089.5" dur="4.8">at every cell site there&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="2091.42" dur="5.16">warning and every set any every tower</text>
  <text start="2094.3" dur="5.13">climber has to wear a little device on</text>
  <text start="2096.58" dur="5.93">their body that tells them the radiation</text>
  <text start="2099.43" dur="6.06">exposure and so</text>
  <text start="2102.51" dur="4.96">nah-nah-nah-nah ionizing radiation can</text>
  <text start="2105.49" dur="4.47">have immediate effects but not</text>
  <text start="2107.47" dur="4.83">necessarily long-term effects like like</text>
  <text start="2109.96" dur="4.8">like nuclear radiation uranium that kind</text>
  <text start="2112.3" dur="5.16">of stuff or you your body is poisoned</text>
  <text start="2114.76" dur="4.23">but it can have a damaging effect and</text>
  <text start="2117.46" dur="4.41">and I think that you know that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2118.99" dur="4.74">concern the FCC does have like we talked</text>
  <text start="2121.87" dur="4.29">about like the microwave it could yeah</text>
  <text start="2123.73" dur="4.62">that might will meter wave ones are the</text>
  <text start="2126.16" dur="6.87">ones that I&amp;#39;m really concerned about the</text>
  <text start="2128.35" dur="9.39">most because in the in that case you</text>
  <text start="2133.03" dur="8.22">know a tree a wall and skin and rain all</text>
  <text start="2137.74" dur="5.25">have a devastating effect to that</text>
  <text start="2141.25" dur="4.8">particular type of frequency you know</text>
  <text start="2142.99" dur="7.08">what called attenuate sit and that makes</text>
  <text start="2146.05" dur="6.09">it low and so to offset that they have</text>
  <text start="2150.07" dur="4.35">to increase the power at the transmitter</text>
  <text start="2152.14" dur="6.09">site so the transmitters will be you</text>
  <text start="2154.42" dur="7.02">know at the top of a let&amp;#39;s say a 40 or</text>
  <text start="2158.23" dur="5.21">80 foot light pole so they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="2161.44" dur="3.22">to be right next to your head</text>
  <text start="2163.44" dur="3.08">[Music]</text>
  <text start="2164.66" dur="4.74">and in probably in many cases they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2166.52" dur="4.289">be next to your window either but the</text>
  <text start="2169.4" dur="3.719">part that concerns me the most is the</text>
  <text start="2170.809" dur="4.951">part the user has to have so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2173.119" dur="4.261">phone now in 5g they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="2175.76" dur="3.599">two different types of 5g they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2177.38" dur="5.4">have something called a puck which is</text>
  <text start="2179.359" dur="5.671">you know a box that you stick in your</text>
  <text start="2182.78" dur="4.259">window and it&amp;#39;ll pick up the signal and</text>
  <text start="2185.03" dur="4.17">it will turn it into Wi-Fi that your</text>
  <text start="2187.039" dur="4.381">whole house will use so in that</text>
  <text start="2189.2" dur="3.99">particular case it&amp;#39;ll have probably</text>
  <text start="2191.42" dur="3.54">what&amp;#39;s called a phased array antenna</text>
  <text start="2193.19" dur="5.639">built into it so even though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2194.96" dur="5.159">omnidirectional it will only direct use</text>
  <text start="2198.829" dur="3.72">the antennas pointing in the direction</text>
  <text start="2200.119" dur="4.771">to give it the best signal that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2202.549" dur="5.57">pretty standard technology in Wi-Fi</text>
  <text start="2204.89" dur="6.54">today it&amp;#39;s called a phased array antenna</text>
  <text start="2208.119" dur="6.401">but it&amp;#39;s these the phones to handhelds</text>
  <text start="2211.43" dur="7.59">that I can turn to I read a report or a</text>
  <text start="2214.52" dur="9.809">filing at the FCC of Motorola&amp;#39;s plans to</text>
  <text start="2219.02" dur="7.11">build a 5g for their um for handheld and</text>
  <text start="2224.329" dur="3.391">I think it&amp;#39;s might even have been for</text>
  <text start="2226.13" dur="3.929">this particular phone that I have this</text>
  <text start="2227.72" dur="5.28">is the Moto 3 and so it&amp;#39;s got a little</text>
  <text start="2230.059" dur="5.22">mod I can pull off it this is my battery</text>
  <text start="2233" dur="4.43">mod which I love and I can put up by G</text>
  <text start="2235.279" dur="7.53">mod on there when it comes available so</text>
  <text start="2237.43" dur="7.24">their concern is this okay so yeah</text>
  <text start="2242.809" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s great if the antenna that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2244.67" dur="4.02">broadcasting to is over there but if the</text>
  <text start="2246.859" dur="6.331">antenna is right there well you can see</text>
  <text start="2248.69" dur="7.32">it&amp;#39;s going right and this man oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="2253.19" dur="6">that that is true yeah so the ability</text>
  <text start="2256.01" dur="5.25">for it to receive the signal far away is</text>
  <text start="2259.19" dur="4.2">great but now it has to be able to</text>
  <text start="2261.26" dur="3.9">communicate back to that antenna with</text>
  <text start="2263.39" dur="3.689">this signal going through my head and so</text>
  <text start="2265.16" dur="4.59">they have a proximity sensor built into</text>
  <text start="2267.079" dur="5.79">the technology so that it will not</text>
  <text start="2269.75" dur="4.89">broadcast use the antenna whatever that</text>
  <text start="2272.869" dur="4.021">antenna is to broadcast through my head</text>
  <text start="2274.64" dur="5.04">and I&amp;#39;m doing this because that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2276.89" dur="5.37">good um you know it would be my</text>
  <text start="2279.68" dur="5.97">assumption yeah I think so too and the</text>
  <text start="2282.26" dur="5.039">concern that I have because again these</text>
  <text start="2285.65" dur="3.99">are</text>
  <text start="2287.299" dur="4.081">yeah they call them smartphones but they</text>
  <text start="2289.64" dur="5.429">also have another name they are I</text>
  <text start="2291.38" dur="5.939">computer on a network every computer on</text>
  <text start="2295.069" dur="4.44">a network at some point in time will</text>
  <text start="2297.319" dur="4.08">become compromised one for one reason or</text>
  <text start="2299.509" dur="5.73">another either it&amp;#39;ll be hacked from the</text>
  <text start="2301.399" dur="7.97">outside because of an exploit or in most</text>
  <text start="2305.239" dur="6.33">cases because the customer or the user</text>
  <text start="2309.369" dur="5.29">downloaded something on there that</text>
  <text start="2311.569" dur="5.1">basically invited all the bad people to</text>
  <text start="2314.659" dur="7.26">come in and feel like downloading the</text>
  <text start="2316.669" dur="8.43">Facebook app it&amp;#39;s really some of the</text>
  <text start="2321.919" dur="6.961">most innocent things can be compromised</text>
  <text start="2325.099" dur="5.73">and so um like the Internet of Things</text>
  <text start="2328.88" dur="3.51">all right people are a hot on this thing</text>
  <text start="2330.829" dur="3.66">called the Internet of Things and what</text>
  <text start="2332.39" dur="4.559">that means is that you buy a you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2334.489" dur="5.25">getting a device that has Wi-Fi</text>
  <text start="2336.949" dur="8.13">capabilities at your house Ridge Raiders</text>
  <text start="2339.739" dur="8.28">toys everything they are what we would</text>
  <text start="2345.079" dur="5.551">consider as people as users a low</text>
  <text start="2348.019" dur="4.8">priority target because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2350.63" dur="4.349">putting our financial data on them we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2352.819" dur="5.04">not putting our personal information in</text>
  <text start="2354.979" dur="6.03">them it&amp;#39;s the same principle as as them</text>
  <text start="2357.859" dur="4.35">using printers that were early printers</text>
  <text start="2361.009" dur="2.7">that were hooked up to the internet to</text>
  <text start="2362.209" dur="3.84">get into your Wi-Fi to get into your</text>
  <text start="2363.709" dur="4.53">systems now this on the other hand is</text>
  <text start="2366.049" dur="4.831">very very crucial it&amp;#39;s got private</text>
  <text start="2368.239" dur="5.28">information and it&amp;#39;s got its all this</text>
  <text start="2370.88" dur="3.989">stuff so the interface itself if I leave</text>
  <text start="2373.519" dur="4.41">it somewhere and they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="2374.869" dur="5.75">password they can&amp;#39;t get into it okay but</text>
  <text start="2377.929" dur="6.451">now I&amp;#39;m at home on my Wi-Fi network and</text>
  <text start="2380.619" dur="5.05">you know my refrigerator which has no</text>
  <text start="2384.38" dur="4.339">personal information at all it just</text>
  <text start="2385.669" dur="4.53">tells me when it&amp;#39;s time to get milk also</text>
  <text start="2388.719" dur="6.76">stop laughing</text>
  <text start="2390.199" dur="8.16">this also has access to the friendly</text>
  <text start="2395.479" dur="6.93">side of my phone known as the wireless</text>
  <text start="2398.359" dur="6.09">LAN okay so now the refrigerator gets</text>
  <text start="2402.409" dur="5.28">hacked the refrigerator hacks my phone</text>
  <text start="2404.449" dur="6.48">phone now is broadcasting millimeter</text>

  <text start="2410.929" dur="7.17">why I feel sick oh my gosh and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2415.549" dur="3.601">speculative but it shows that the</text>
  <text start="2418.099" dur="3.87">inherent</text>
  <text start="2419.15" dur="5.189">you know dare dangers that could present</text>
  <text start="2421.969" dur="5.13">themselves in the future so I think</text>
  <text start="2424.339" dur="6.361">that&amp;#39;s definitely a good point to talk</text>
  <text start="2427.099" dur="5.281">about and yeah so you know like like we</text>
  <text start="2430.7" dur="3.18">both said we&amp;#39;re not really we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2432.38" dur="3.81">medical doctors we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="2433.88" dur="5.339">ability to tell you for sure what it is</text>
  <text start="2436.19" dur="5.27">or isn&amp;#39;t but speculatively speaking</text>
  <text start="2439.219" dur="4.921">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff that could happen</text>
  <text start="2441.46" dur="4.539">is there anything else is time time is</text>
  <text start="2444.14" dur="3.929">gonna tell I think we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="2445.999" dur="4.74">just I know when it comes to this kind</text>
  <text start="2448.069" dur="4.53">of stuff you got to trust the FCC to do</text>
  <text start="2450.739" dur="3.901">the right thing when it comes to safety</text>
  <text start="2452.599" dur="4.321">because that is their number one thing</text>
  <text start="2454.64" dur="4.77">anything that broadcasts a wireless</text>
  <text start="2456.92" dur="4.77">signal has to have a FCC ID and that</text>
  <text start="2459.41" dur="5.129">means it&amp;#39;s been tested by not</text>
  <text start="2461.69" dur="6.809">necessarily FCC but a an independent FCC</text>
  <text start="2464.539" dur="5.97">authorized laboratory so if I make a pen</text>
  <text start="2468.499" dur="5.131">that has electronics in it that gives</text>
  <text start="2470.509" dur="4.651">off a radio signal even if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2473.63" dur="2.909">incidentally you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2475.16" dur="4.74">necessarily primary but it&amp;#39;s incidental</text>
  <text start="2476.539" dur="4.98">I take it to a lab and I got play laughs</text>
  <text start="2479.9" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;ve been Washington Northern Virginia</text>
  <text start="2481.519" dur="4.53">but all over the country and I pay them</text>
  <text start="2483.41" dur="4.98">hey put this phone and you just pin in</text>
  <text start="2486.049" dur="4.29">your lab and then turn it on and you</text>
  <text start="2488.39" dur="5.189">tell me if it&amp;#39;s safe so that I can then</text>
  <text start="2490.339" dur="5.64">you know apply for my FCC ID that says</text>
  <text start="2493.579" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s safe and sell this pin and make a</text>
  <text start="2495.979" dur="4.56">million dollars but then and right to</text>
  <text start="2498.469" dur="3.33">that point it&amp;#39;s like you know I think</text>
  <text start="2500.539" dur="2.58">that the products are going to save a</text>
  <text start="2501.799" dur="3.99">lot of people who are concerned about</text>
  <text start="2503.119" dur="5.49">this ultimately I believe have this this</text>
  <text start="2505.789" dur="5.58">feeling that it&amp;#39;s going to be you know</text>
  <text start="2508.609" dur="4.17">covertly weaponized and you know that</text>
  <text start="2511.369" dur="2.581">that&amp;#39;s all yet to be determined</text>
  <text start="2512.779" dur="3.57">I don&amp;#39;t think either of us can make a</text>
  <text start="2513.95" dur="3.779">speculative guess as to whether that</text>
  <text start="2516.349" dur="4.14">would happen or not but I think we could</text>
  <text start="2517.729" dur="6.03">definitely say that the the it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="2520.489" dur="4.83">realm of possibilities and but as far as</text>
  <text start="2523.759" dur="3.78">in general it should be a safe</text>
  <text start="2525.319" dur="4.831">technology if it can get through the the</text>
  <text start="2527.539" dur="4.29">clearances and there there&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="2530.15" dur="5.73">going to be protocols put in place to</text>
  <text start="2531.829" dur="6.331">protect the the end-user ultimately so I</text>
  <text start="2535.88" dur="4.05">guess we&amp;#39;ll just get will kind of wrap</text>
  <text start="2538.16" dur="4.139">this up a little bit I appreciate you</text>
  <text start="2539.93" dur="4.98">coming in I have one more question for</text>
  <text start="2542.299" dur="4.98">you well why don&amp;#39;t you tell us what some</text>
  <text start="2544.91" dur="4.109">of the solutions for this are like</text>
  <text start="2547.279" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s one of the solutions to the</text>
  <text start="2549.019" dur="3.861">nationalization of 5g how do we fix this</text>
  <text start="2551.779" dur="4.101">what do you what is in order</text>
  <text start="2552.88" dur="7.02">like the Wireless ISP Association what</text>
  <text start="2555.88" dur="6.75">do they think you know give me a your</text>
  <text start="2559.9" dur="5.7">concluding your thoughts and conclusion</text>
  <text start="2562.63" dur="5.43">well one of the last things I worked on</text>
  <text start="2565.6" dur="4.77">at whisper was this thing called the CB</text>
  <text start="2568.06" dur="5.28">RS and it&amp;#39;s a call a citizen&amp;#39;s broadband</text>
  <text start="2570.37" dur="7.86">radio service and it was basically a</text>
  <text start="2573.34" dur="7.89">concept that was set up by the FCC</text>
  <text start="2578.23" dur="4.95">probably a good five six years ago and</text>
  <text start="2581.23" dur="3.6">the idea was to take some spectrum that</text>
  <text start="2583.18" dur="3.54">wasn&amp;#39;t being used very effectively in</text>
  <text start="2584.83" dur="4.83">the United States in this case satellite</text>
  <text start="2586.72" dur="5.22">both commercial and military satellite</text>
  <text start="2589.66" dur="5.34">spectrum in the 3.5 gigahertz bands</text>
  <text start="2591.94" dur="5.85">about 150 megahertz and create a system</text>
  <text start="2595" dur="4.95">that allowed small and medium sized and</text>
  <text start="2597.79" dur="4.86">even large providers to be able to lease</text>
  <text start="2599.95" dur="5.01">the spectrum in a cost-effective way</text>
  <text start="2602.65" dur="5.55">also you know give them an opportunity</text>
  <text start="2604.96" dur="6.24">for unlicensed typing used for low-cost</text>
  <text start="2608.2" dur="4.77">entrance into the market oh and so you</text>
  <text start="2611.2" dur="8.7">know this spectrum was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="2612.97" dur="9.18">used for either urbanized LTE type 5g or</text>
  <text start="2619.9" dur="5.58">it could be used for rural a higher</text>
  <text start="2622.15" dur="5.85">power wireless broadband and that could</text>
  <text start="2625.48" dur="4.53">also be LTE but it could also be Wi-Fi</text>
  <text start="2628" dur="3.78">or it could be some yet to be determined</text>
  <text start="2630.01" dur="4.83">technology was not really technology</text>
  <text start="2631.78" dur="4.47">specific and so things were going along</text>
  <text start="2634.84" dur="4.08">and they were developing this thing</text>
  <text start="2636.25" dur="4.5">called spectrum access system whisper</text>
  <text start="2638.92" dur="4.59">was very involved I was the president at</text>
  <text start="2640.75" dur="4.83">the time and we had people from our</text>
  <text start="2643.51" dur="3.84">organization working with this</text>
  <text start="2645.58" dur="3.99">third-party group called the wireless</text>
  <text start="2647.35" dur="4.29">innovation alliance or well excuse me</text>
  <text start="2649.57" dur="5.97">wireless innovation forum which is a</text>
  <text start="2651.64" dur="7.5">group of people very smart you know PhD</text>
  <text start="2655.54" dur="6.66">engineer types from Verizon from the the</text>
  <text start="2659.14" dur="7.26">technology companies at Qualcomm they</text>
  <text start="2662.2" dur="6">made chips AT&amp;amp;T Google you know</text>
  <text start="2666.4" dur="3.39">everybody that had a stake in this and</text>
  <text start="2668.2" dur="4.23">so we were all working toward the same</text>
  <text start="2669.79" dur="6.27">effort and then at some point in time</text>
  <text start="2672.43" dur="7.14">the CTIA which is the wireless industry</text>
  <text start="2676.06" dur="6.87">for the cellular market um told people</text>
  <text start="2679.57" dur="6.93">at the FCC that hey we need to make this</text>
  <text start="2682.93" dur="6.36">thing different and you know</text>
  <text start="2686.5" dur="5.31">without getting into hole detail Michael</text>
  <text start="2689.29" dur="4.26">Riley the Commissioner changed the rules</text>
  <text start="2691.81" dur="3.17">based on a proposal that came from</text>
  <text start="2693.55" dur="4.68">t-mobile</text>
  <text start="2694.98" dur="5.95">nessa phone company I like to call the</text>
  <text start="2698.23" dur="4.74">Stooges for AT&amp;amp;T because they run the</text>
  <text start="2700.93" dur="5.79">same type of mobile technology and so</text>
  <text start="2702.97" dur="5.46">AT&amp;amp;T wants to own them but anyhow they</text>
  <text start="2706.72" dur="3.93">made this change and what it did is it</text>
  <text start="2708.43" dur="5.04">effectively changed the nature of the</text>
  <text start="2710.65" dur="5.04">citizens broadband radio service that</text>
  <text start="2713.47" dur="4.139">was going to be open and available to</text>
  <text start="2715.69" dur="3.54">any small business all the way up to any</text>
  <text start="2717.609" dur="4.921">large business and made it more</text>
  <text start="2719.23" dur="6.24">exclusive to large businesses mostly by</text>
  <text start="2722.53" dur="4.68">changing the size of how large of an</text>
  <text start="2725.47" dur="4.92">area was the minimum size you could</text>
  <text start="2727.21" dur="6.24">purchase and the term of the licenses</text>
  <text start="2730.39" dur="7.07">converted it from being an operational</text>
  <text start="2733.45" dur="6.63">expense to a capital expense and</text>
  <text start="2737.46" dur="5.29">historically cellular phone companies</text>
  <text start="2740.08" dur="5.34">can lay down anywhere from 10 to 50</text>
  <text start="2742.75" dur="5.7">billion dollars for this spectrum and</text>
  <text start="2745.42" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s a lot of money but moreover they</text>
  <text start="2748.45" dur="5.52">could take that spectrum and put it on</text>
  <text start="2749.95" dur="7.38">their books as an asset and as an asset</text>
  <text start="2753.97" dur="6.45">that was now becoming scarce it became</text>
  <text start="2757.33" dur="5.37">an appreciated asset and value so 10</text>
  <text start="2760.42" dur="6.12">million became 20 million 50 million</text>
  <text start="2762.7" dur="6.12">became or 10 billion became 20 billion</text>
  <text start="2766.54" dur="4.799">and fifty billion became a hundred</text>
  <text start="2768.82" dur="4.56">billion in value which means you can go</text>
  <text start="2771.339" dur="3.481">to the more you can go to the market not</text>
  <text start="2773.38" dur="4.07">just the bank but what they call the</text>
  <text start="2774.82" dur="5.49">market and leverage that to get money</text>
  <text start="2777.45" dur="4.419">relatively low cost money to continue</text>
  <text start="2780.31" dur="5.1">invest in your company so it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2781.869" dur="6.601">printing money in a way and so the FCC&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2785.41" dur="5.52">plan was to create this spectrum</text>
  <text start="2788.47" dur="4.71">deployment model that allowed for</text>
  <text start="2790.93" dur="4.8">companies to effectively use the</text>
  <text start="2793.18" dur="4.32">spectrum because the carriers were</text>
  <text start="2795.73" dur="4.619">buying the spectrum and just sitting on</text>
  <text start="2797.5" dur="3.99">it to appreciate its value so until they</text>
  <text start="2800.349" dur="4.561">could get enough money out of the</text>
  <text start="2801.49" dur="5.31">markets to build it and this new</text>
  <text start="2804.91" dur="4.32">spectrum was supposed to be available to</text>
  <text start="2806.8" dur="6">small businesses that would actually use</text>
  <text start="2809.23" dur="6.03">it to build out in rural areas or add</text>
  <text start="2812.8" dur="6.13">more capacity in urbanized areas for LTE</text>
  <text start="2815.26" dur="5.38">so when they made this change</text>
  <text start="2818.93" dur="3.78">you know various organizations got</text>
  <text start="2820.64" dur="4.08">involved in trying to fight this whisper</text>
  <text start="2822.71" dur="4.68">being one of them and they took up this</text>
  <text start="2824.72" dur="5.67">whole argument of the small business is</text>
  <text start="2827.39" dur="4.95">basically finding solutions in rural</text>
  <text start="2830.39" dur="4.83">areas where large businesses not and</text>
  <text start="2832.34" dur="5.73">that way you know that meant that the</text>
  <text start="2835.22" dur="5.07">FCC should change their mind but they</text>
  <text start="2838.07" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t realize that the large businesses</text>
  <text start="2840.29" dur="4.56">like Verizon AT&amp;amp;T were telling the FCC</text>
  <text start="2842.36" dur="4.29">no no will will build out in the rural</text>
  <text start="2844.85" dur="3.24">areas well we won&amp;#39;t be like we were in</text>
  <text start="2846.65" dur="2.94">the past we&amp;#39;re gonna do the right thing</text>
  <text start="2848.09" dur="4.77">this time if you give us what we want</text>
  <text start="2849.59" dur="4.65">and so they gave them what they want and</text>
  <text start="2852.86" dur="5.24">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see an erosion</text>
  <text start="2854.24" dur="6.24">in the promise where companies like</text>
  <text start="2858.1" dur="5.29">Verizon that we&amp;#39;re working with rural</text>
  <text start="2860.48" dur="4.41">phone companies for roaming agreements</text>
  <text start="2863.39" dur="2.55">are starting to pull back and saying hey</text>
  <text start="2864.89" dur="2.22">we&amp;#39;d really want to work with you guys</text>
  <text start="2865.94" dur="5.76">anymore we&amp;#39;re gonna build our own thing</text>
  <text start="2867.11" dur="6.63">and so what kind of lost that battle and</text>
  <text start="2871.7" dur="4.44">now the next battle is with some other</text>
  <text start="2873.74" dur="4.11">spectrum very close to that it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="2876.14" dur="5.13">this it&amp;#39;s called the three point seven</text>
  <text start="2877.85" dur="6.8">to four point two gigahertz band um and</text>
  <text start="2881.27" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s used by the old</text>
  <text start="2884.65" dur="4.3">satellite companies that you know you</text>
  <text start="2887.18" dur="4.01">had the big giant satellite dish in your</text>
  <text start="2888.95" dur="4.56">backyard called the c-band satellite</text>
  <text start="2891.19" dur="7.09">which some people still use for picking</text>
  <text start="2893.51" dur="6.99">up you know free satellite transmissions</text>
  <text start="2898.28" dur="4.47">that are available to pick up that are</text>
  <text start="2900.5" dur="3.69">unencrypted so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re using a</text>
  <text start="2902.75" dur="3.36">lot of the spectrum and so the phone</text>
  <text start="2904.19" dur="2.91">companies the cellular phone companies</text>
  <text start="2906.11" dur="3.81">they want to have access to that</text>
  <text start="2907.1" dur="5.79">spectrum too so the idea is to move all</text>
  <text start="2909.92" dur="5.31">the c-band guys down so they got they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2912.89" dur="4.77">got 500 megahertz of spectrum move them</text>
  <text start="2915.23" dur="4.68">all down to this 200 megahertz or 300</text>
  <text start="2917.66" dur="4.41">megahertz and then have the rest of it</text>
  <text start="2919.91" dur="3.66">auctioned off to the to the cellular</text>
  <text start="2922.07" dur="4.29">phone companies so they can make a lot</text>
  <text start="2923.57" dur="5.49">of money at the FCC and and build more</text>
  <text start="2926.36" dur="4.47">5g so we&amp;#39;re fine with that but whispah</text>
  <text start="2929.06" dur="3.15">says this band that&amp;#39;s down here that</text>
  <text start="2930.83" dur="4.68">satellite companies are going to be</text>
  <text start="2932.21" dur="6.27">allocated to that band can be shared by</text>
  <text start="2935.51" dur="5.01">fixed broadband providers in rural areas</text>
  <text start="2938.48" dur="4.61">without interfering with them and so</text>
  <text start="2940.52" dur="5.76">they put together a proposal to the FCC</text>
  <text start="2943.09" dur="6.85">to say let us let us have access to that</text>
  <text start="2946.28" dur="6">spectrum so that we can have more</text>
  <text start="2949.94" dur="6.21">broadband in rural areas</text>
  <text start="2952.28" dur="4.74">and still allow the c-band operators to</text>
  <text start="2956.15" dur="3.96">continue to do what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2957.02" dur="5.22">because the technology is different so</text>
  <text start="2960.11" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re pointing satellite guys are</text>
  <text start="2962.24" dur="4.38">pointing up they&amp;#39;re transmitting on this</text>
  <text start="2964.37" dur="4.05">frequency up they&amp;#39;re not listening to it</text>
  <text start="2966.62" dur="6.38">and they&amp;#39;re also transmitting it in a</text>
  <text start="2968.42" dur="7.23">circular antenna type wave whereas the</text>
  <text start="2973" dur="4.96">fixed wireless providers are looking</text>
  <text start="2975.65" dur="5.4">this way and they&amp;#39;re using either</text>
  <text start="2977.96" dur="4.41">vertical or horizontal waves and so</text>
  <text start="2981.05" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not compatible they</text>
  <text start="2982.37" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t interfere with each other and they</text>
  <text start="2984.02" dur="6.69">can coexist even to the point where if</text>
  <text start="2986.93" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;m near a specific uplink satellite</text>
  <text start="2990.71" dur="3.45">operator that&amp;#39;s using a specific</text>
  <text start="2992.51" dur="3.81">frequency I can just not use that</text>
  <text start="2994.16" dur="5.7">particular frequency altogether and</text>
  <text start="2996.32" dur="6.24">that&amp;#39;s all done today because some type</text>
  <text start="2999.86" dur="4.89">of coordination system it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3002.56" dur="5.16">very simple to use and it&amp;#39;s not and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3004.75" dur="5.13">proven effective and so we made that</text>
  <text start="3007.72" dur="3.42">proposal but you know the FCC has been</text>
  <text start="3009.88" dur="3.3">kind of hedging their bets a little bit</text>
  <text start="3011.14" dur="5.49">about on this because this exciter phone</text>
  <text start="3013.18" dur="5.22">companies want to own it all and you</text>
  <text start="3016.63" dur="3.93">know the FCC just needs to realize that</text>
  <text start="3018.4" dur="4.41">you know the oligarchies that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3020.56" dur="5.64">supporting right now the AT&amp;amp;T Verizon</text>
  <text start="3022.81" dur="5.07">Sprint um don&amp;#39;t have the best interest</text>
  <text start="3026.2" dur="4.14">of the public in mind and these small</text>
  <text start="3027.88" dur="4.08">companies that our daughter all across</text>
  <text start="3030.34" dur="5.58">the nation there&amp;#39;s like probably a good</text>
  <text start="3031.96" dur="7.02">three maybe four thousand small Wireless</text>
  <text start="3035.92" dur="5.85">ISPs you know these people live in the</text>
  <text start="3038.98" dur="4.5">communities they serve they know their</text>
  <text start="3041.77" dur="5.52">customers I can you know I can tell you</text>
  <text start="3043.48" dur="7.29">you know right now most of my customers</text>
  <text start="3047.29" dur="4.92">I know them in a way that AT&amp;amp;T Verizon</text>
  <text start="3050.77" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t know their customers I can tell</text>
  <text start="3052.21" dur="3.24">you you know when I was at their house</text>
  <text start="3053.74" dur="3.51">last I know what their house looks like</text>
  <text start="3055.45" dur="3.57">I know you know what their sons are</text>
  <text start="3057.25" dur="4.32">doing I know you know I know things</text>
  <text start="3059.02" dur="4.38">plus I can tailor my products and</text>
  <text start="3061.57" dur="4.05">services or a small business like mine</text>
  <text start="3063.4" dur="4.98">and tailor products and services to meet</text>
  <text start="3065.62" dur="6.03">the needs of the community serve whereas</text>
  <text start="3068.38" dur="5.28">your Verizon AT&amp;amp;T is you know one size</text>
  <text start="3071.65" dur="5.88">fits all and if you don&amp;#39;t fit then</text>
  <text start="3073.66" dur="6.09">bounced and so I really I really think</text>
  <text start="3077.53" dur="5.4">that the public needs to understand that</text>
  <text start="3079.75" dur="5.07">you know these types of issues that are</text>
  <text start="3082.93" dur="2.72">happening at the FCC where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3084.82" dur="3.62">choosing</text>
  <text start="3085.65" dur="6.689">big companies to be the providers that</text>
  <text start="3088.44" dur="8.31">provide customers broadband results in</text>
  <text start="3092.339" dur="7.23">these after-effects and up till now you</text>
  <text start="3096.75" dur="5.49">know even up till you know since the the</text>
  <text start="3099.569" dur="5.28">net neutrality that got disbanded this</text>
  <text start="3102.24" dur="4.71">this last year the reason why that came</text>
  <text start="3104.849" dur="5.401">is because of the fact that you know you</text>
  <text start="3106.95" dur="5.79">only had one provider in most area areas</text>
  <text start="3110.25" dur="3.96">you had urate you that cable you had DSL</text>
  <text start="3112.74" dur="2.25">and if she&amp;#39;s the phone company of the</text>
  <text start="3114.21" dur="3.21">cable company</text>
  <text start="3114.99" dur="5.549">some people had the luxury of both cable</text>
  <text start="3117.42" dur="6.869">and phone but because companies like</text>
  <text start="3120.539" dur="5.55">Verizon um an AT&amp;amp;T sort of kind of let</text>
  <text start="3124.289" dur="4.8">their cable or let their telephone</text>
  <text start="3126.089" dur="5.071">networks get you know in disarray</text>
  <text start="3129.089" dur="4.95">because of cost-cutting measures and</text>
  <text start="3131.16" dur="4.619">dumping more money into wireless you</text>
  <text start="3134.039" dur="3.871">know you DSL became such an ineffective</text>
  <text start="3135.779" dur="5.731">product in most cases that cable was the</text>
  <text start="3137.91" dur="6.179">only option fiber is not that widely</text>
  <text start="3141.51" dur="6.68">built in in most of the United States so</text>
  <text start="3144.089" dur="8.341">cable is the dominant player Wireless</text>
  <text start="3148.19" dur="6.46">easily overtook DSL I mean we we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3152.43" dur="4.169">have DSL same as I can know a competitor</text>
  <text start="3154.65" dur="3.24">you know we get people to cob DSL all</text>
  <text start="3156.599" dur="4.47">the time the names like well I got a</text>
  <text start="3157.89" dur="6.719">smart TV I&amp;#39;ve got my kids Xbox my</text>
  <text start="3161.069" dur="5.191">daughters you know iPad and you know my</text>
  <text start="3164.609" dur="3.031">husband&amp;#39;s got a workshop he&amp;#39;s gotta be</text>
  <text start="3166.26" dur="3.24">able to watch his YouTube video so he</text>
  <text start="3167.64" dur="4.29">knows how to fix the truck you know</text>
  <text start="3169.5" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re completely overloading these DSL</text>
  <text start="3171.93" dur="3.33">networks and so cable was really only</text>
  <text start="3173.67" dur="4.23">option for them and cable is not</text>
  <text start="3175.26" dur="5.039">available in most places because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3177.9" dur="5.61">costly built it&amp;#39;s a wireless can now</text>
  <text start="3180.299" dur="5.671">deliver up to 25 in some cases even more</text>
  <text start="3183.51" dur="7.289">megabits per second so it&amp;#39;s adequate</text>
  <text start="3185.97" dur="7.02">for all these applications and and so</text>
  <text start="3190.799" dur="4.081">having access to the spectrum and having</text>
  <text start="3192.99" dur="3.18">small businesses have access to it</text>
  <text start="3194.88" dur="4.26">in these rural areas where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3196.17" dur="4.949">filling niche services for people is</text>
  <text start="3199.14" dur="4.62">very important and I think that the FCC</text>
  <text start="3201.119" dur="6.93">needs to really you know hedge their</text>
  <text start="3203.76" dur="6.809">bets so to speak on this 5g deployment</text>
  <text start="3208.049" dur="5.79">scenario that they keep focusing on and</text>
  <text start="3210.569" dur="5.131">realize that 5g is can mean a lot of</text>
  <text start="3213.839" dur="4.2">things and it should mean you know some</text>
  <text start="3215.7" dur="3.69">fixed wireless and some small businesses</text>
  <text start="3218.039" dur="4.29">being part of the eco</text>
  <text start="3219.39" dur="4.62">system I think the mantra that I pushed</text>
  <text start="3222.329" dur="5.311">last year when I was pushing this issue</text>
  <text start="3224.01" dur="5.19">at CB RS was competition diversity and I</text>
  <text start="3227.64" dur="5.159">did all agree that&amp;#39;s exactly what I want</text>
  <text start="3229.2" dur="5.79">to say so you know in in this conclusion</text>
  <text start="3232.799" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s like to put it all kind of out for</text>
  <text start="3234.99" dur="3.599">layman&amp;#39;s terms because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="3236.549" dur="4.351">watching this aren&amp;#39;t you know ISP</text>
  <text start="3238.589" dur="4.23">experts like you and and but it</text>
  <text start="3240.9" dur="4.5">basically is like you were about to</text>
  <text start="3242.819" dur="5.431">point out that it&amp;#39;s destroying</text>
  <text start="3245.4" dur="4.169">competition diversity right and that is</text>
  <text start="3248.25" dur="3.599">a big problem because when you remove</text>
  <text start="3249.569" dur="5.581">competition you know what comes in and</text>
  <text start="3251.849" dur="4.531">takes its place you know and and which</text>
  <text start="3255.15" dur="4.77">is basically nothing no innovation</text>
  <text start="3256.38" dur="6.479">there&amp;#39;s no drive for a you know a market</text>
  <text start="3259.92" dur="4.83">to grow and and other than the way the</text>
  <text start="3262.859" dur="4.5">the one or two or few companies that</text>
  <text start="3264.75" dur="5.91">control it want it to and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="3267.359" dur="5.341">about fighting for the right to provide</text>
  <text start="3270.66" dur="4.73">quality service to people in rural</text>
  <text start="3272.7" dur="6.3">America who depend and need you know</text>
  <text start="3275.39" dur="5.35">they need access to Internet just as</text>
  <text start="3279" dur="4.74">much as somebody in New York City needs</text>
  <text start="3280.74" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s somebody out in you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3283.74" dur="4.109">know Amarillo Texas in ruel Amarillo</text>
  <text start="3286.2" dur="4.109">Texas would want that same kind of</text>
  <text start="3287.849" dur="4.41">access right so and and that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="3290.309" dur="5.371">think your overall argument is is kind</text>
  <text start="3292.259" dur="5.401">of driving to is that the FCC has to</text>
  <text start="3295.68" dur="5.609">step in with regulation to help small</text>
  <text start="3297.66" dur="5.939">business remain competitive is that in</text>
  <text start="3301.289" dur="4.681">regulation but it&amp;#39;s more policy so</text>
  <text start="3303.599" dur="4.651">regulation right for excuse me it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="3305.97" dur="4.649">protect the consumer from companies</text>
  <text start="3308.25" dur="5.49">taking advantage of them but policy in</text>
  <text start="3310.619" dur="6.121">this case can can enable competition in</text>
  <text start="3313.74" dur="5.19">a way that doesn&amp;#39;t require it to be as</text>
  <text start="3316.74" dur="5.19">regulated as some people are saying so</text>
  <text start="3318.93" dur="6.679">if you have if you have if you&amp;#39;re a user</text>
  <text start="3321.93" dur="6.45">of Internet and your internet company</text>
  <text start="3325.609" dur="4.781">does a bad job for whatever reason</text>
  <text start="3328.38" dur="3.33">either because they&amp;#39;ve made they&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="3330.39" dur="3.899">it a policy that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="3331.71" dur="4.889">allow you to have fast access to YouTube</text>
  <text start="3334.289" dur="4.681">or they made it a policy that they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="3336.599" dur="4.321">rather you to use their video sir online</text>
  <text start="3338.97" dur="4.44">video services whether versus somebody</text>
  <text start="3340.92" dur="4.109">else&amp;#39;s um then you go to somebody else</text>
  <text start="3343.41" dur="3.179">but if you don&amp;#39;t have any choice that</text>
  <text start="3345.029" dur="4.201">Comcast is your only option</text>
  <text start="3346.589" dur="6.581">if Verizon FiOS is your only option if</text>
  <text start="3349.23" dur="6.4">any of these spectrum companies</text>
  <text start="3353.17" dur="6.689">Cox cable you know if they&amp;#39;re your only</text>
  <text start="3355.63" dur="5.939">option then what is your option then for</text>
  <text start="3359.859" dur="3.42">recourse so if you have bad service you</text>
  <text start="3361.569" dur="5.101">got to go to the government complain and</text>
  <text start="3363.279" dur="7.921">that&amp;#39;s because they they purposely over</text>
  <text start="3366.67" dur="6.06">the years supported these companies and</text>
  <text start="3371.2" dur="4.23">making sure that there was only one or</text>
  <text start="3372.73" dur="5.129">two companies in an area and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3375.43" dur="5.97">think it&amp;#39;s a conspiracy per se it was</text>
  <text start="3377.859" dur="8.01">just the ecosystem you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3381.4" dur="6.179">easier to give away a billion dollars to</text>
  <text start="3385.869" dur="4.291">a few companies than it is to give a</text>
  <text start="3387.579" dur="6.091">billion dollars away to a thousand</text>
  <text start="3390.16" dur="5.28">companies it&amp;#39;s easier to regulate five</text>
  <text start="3393.67" dur="5.849">or six companies than it is to regulate</text>
  <text start="3395.44" dur="6.179">thousands of companies and I think the</text>
  <text start="3399.519" dur="3.871">FCC just really needs to take a look at</text>
  <text start="3401.619" dur="4.23">this and realize that it&amp;#39;s not their job</text>
  <text start="3403.39" dur="5.699">to pick winners and losers because of</text>
  <text start="3405.849" dur="5.22">inefficiencies at their at their</text>
  <text start="3409.089" dur="4.131">division or inefficiencies with their</text>
  <text start="3411.069" dur="5.25">government they need to realize that</text>
  <text start="3413.22" dur="6.73">small businesses need to be part of the</text>
  <text start="3416.319" dur="6.931">solution because in any area you know a</text>
  <text start="3419.95" dur="5.46">big business is going to fail to meet</text>
  <text start="3423.25" dur="4.259">the needs of some of the clients that</text>
  <text start="3425.41" dur="5.369">they service and those clients need to</text>
  <text start="3427.509" dur="4.471">have an option otherwise it&amp;#39;s back to</text>
  <text start="3430.779" dur="3.121">having you&amp;#39;re gonna have to have</text>
  <text start="3431.98" dur="2.819">government regulations and government I</text>
  <text start="3433.9" dur="3.719">mean the government sort of hearing</text>
  <text start="3434.799" dur="4.5">these things all they do is screw it up</text>
  <text start="3437.619" dur="3.871">yeah and we know that we know what</text>
  <text start="3439.299" dur="4.8">happens when big government gets bigger</text>
  <text start="3441.49" dur="5.7">and they get more involved in it just</text>
  <text start="3444.099" dur="6.301">always ends up becoming a incredible</text>
  <text start="3447.19" dur="6.21">mess so I want to thank you first of all</text>
  <text start="3450.4" dur="5.189">for coming on the show today I hope we</text>
  <text start="3453.4" dur="5.01">we hit a lot of the points that were</text>
  <text start="3455.589" dur="6.24">really important in diving into this</text>
  <text start="3458.41" dur="5.849">issue and again I just want to give you</text>
  <text start="3461.829" dur="3.631">a minute real quick if you want to let</text>

  <text start="3494.349" dur="2.82">a lot of what we learned at the last</text>
  <text start="3495.969" dur="3.6">conference because that was our first</text>
  <text start="3497.169" dur="3.6">conference things that worked well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3499.569" dur="2.16">going to do again things that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3500.769" dur="2.49">work so well we&amp;#39;re gonna do something</text>
  <text start="3501.729" dur="4.89">different but we&amp;#39;re really going to try</text>
  <text start="3503.259" dur="6.09">to focus on the main core and that is to</text>
  <text start="3506.619" dur="5.73">promote the First Amendment and a</text>
  <text start="3509.349" dur="4.86">citizen journalism but we&amp;#39;re also going</text>
  <text start="3512.349" dur="3.42">to do the other things that we promised</text>
  <text start="3514.209" dur="3.72">and that is to bring fellowship so</text>
  <text start="3515.769" dur="5.31">people that come across the country and</text>
  <text start="3517.929" dur="5.64">meet new people or meet friends that</text>
  <text start="3521.079" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve only known online and do stuff</text>
  <text start="3523.569" dur="5.341">together and have fun and and really</text>
  <text start="3525.699" dur="5.25">share ideas that&amp;#39;s the big key I think</text>
  <text start="3528.91" dur="3.359">to anything that like that what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3530.949" dur="3.24">doing is that people need to be able to</text>
  <text start="3532.269" dur="3.54">share ideas but they also need to get</text>
  <text start="3534.189" dur="4.32">out of off the computers they need to</text>
  <text start="3535.809" dur="4.8">show up and an event and talk to people</text>
  <text start="3538.509" dur="5.01">and have real interactions with folks</text>
  <text start="3540.609" dur="4.62">and share ideas and and learn from each</text>
  <text start="3543.519" dur="2.76">other so we&amp;#39;re going to be doing a lot</text>
  <text start="3545.229" dur="2.88">of that we&amp;#39;re going to try to have a</text>
  <text start="3546.279" dur="4.98">golf tournament which is going to be a</text>
