  <text start="155.019" dur="3.3">know listening the president Trump</text>
  <text start="156.849" dur="3.72">speech he was highlighting all the most</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="4.14">important things I mean he highlighted</text>
  <text start="160.569" dur="3.901">what&amp;#39;s happening with China he</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="3.93">highlighted the deep state corruption in</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="6.299">the fake news media he did everything</text>
  <text start="166.389" dur="6.21">and I know he heard me first of all I</text>
  <text start="170.769" dur="3">know because you he kept looking like</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="3.54">every time I would yell something he</text>
  <text start="173.769" dur="4.5">kind of look over at me probably because</text>
  <text start="176.139" dur="3.72">I was yelling it and sometimes it kind</text>
  <text start="178.269" dur="3.81">of interrupted the stream I wasn&amp;#39;t his</text>
  <text start="179.859" dur="3.901">uh did you hear that that&amp;#39;s very loud</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="2.851">thunder that just hit but I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="3.479">trying to interrupt his speech I was</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="4.649">just trying to you know get the get the</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="4.98">message out there and like I said I was</text>
  <text start="189.579" dur="3.931">so close to President Trump that when</text>
  <text start="192.219" dur="2.401">you&amp;#39;re that close it&amp;#39;s kind of like one</text>
  <text start="193.51" dur="3.089">of those things where you&amp;#39;re like you</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="5.1">just you want to kind of be engaged in</text>
  <text start="196.599" dur="6.181">the the speech itself and I mean I can</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="5.939">tell you right now I&amp;#39;m gonna remember</text>
  <text start="202.78" dur="8.609">this for the rest of my life and like I</text>
  <text start="205.659" dur="8.58">said yeah he gave the cue sign a few</text>
  <text start="211.389" dur="4.081">times and I didn&amp;#39;t say that cue items</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="3.03">weren&amp;#39;t allowed because there were</text>
  <text start="215.47" dur="4.409">people accused shirts and stuff but they</text>
  <text start="217.269" dur="3.9">were taking away signs from people and</text>
  <text start="219.879" dur="3.841">stuff like that</text>
  <text start="221.169" dur="5.331">he gave a bunch of air cues that was</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="6.03">definitely something and the reality is</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.81">when I I waited til the moment when it</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="3.15">was the most quiet and I screamed</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="3.12">queueing on where we go when we go all</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="5.449">and I know he heard me because he kind</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="6.509">of paused and looked over but I mean</text>
  <text start="238.349" dur="6.01">just overall what a day it&amp;#39;s been a long</text>
  <text start="240.939" dur="5.3">day um it started about let&amp;#39;s see I</text>
  <text start="244.359" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t know what time it is</text>
  <text start="246.239" dur="8.801">9:15 here so it started for me around a</text>
  <text start="250.419" dur="6.57">little after 12:30 so I&amp;#39;ve been here for</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="4.77">eight hours but it was worth every</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="6.751">second State stood in the line got in</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="5.34">got I was there with some friends and we</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="4.47">were just we were proud American</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="4.65">today and I did make a bunch of</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="2.94">recordings I&amp;#39;m gonna try to put</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="2.69">something together you might not see</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="4.079">that for another couple days because</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="5.26">obviously you guys know I&amp;#39;m on the road</text>
  <text start="275.229" dur="3.871">right now and it&amp;#39;s hard to do a lot of</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="4.74">editing when you&amp;#39;re traveling just</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="4.83">because of the time constraint but what</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="3.66">do you guys think you guys have any</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="7.59">thoughts you can throw them down I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="8.01">watching the live chat somebody said did</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="4.17">you record all of what you did I you</text>
  <text start="294.16" dur="3.81">know I didn&amp;#39;t get myself screaming the</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.44">cue stuff but it was it was definitely</text>
  <text start="297.97" dur="3.96">an interesting it&amp;#39;s hard to do that</text>
  <text start="300.13" dur="3.93">because you gotta remember you&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="5.489">to record yourself and be engaged in the</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="7.44">speech itself and so I didn&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
