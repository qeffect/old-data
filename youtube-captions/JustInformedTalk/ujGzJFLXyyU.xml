  <text start="0.26" dur="6.789">hey guys this is very much not like any</text>
  <text start="4.17" dur="4.469">of the videos I usually do but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="7.049" dur="4.021">finally happened</text>
  <text start="8.639" dur="4.83">YouTube has come after my channel and a</text>
  <text start="11.07" dur="3.989">lot of other channels like it and the</text>
  <text start="13.469" dur="3.15">proofs in the pudding and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="3.3">show you guys a few things and I want to</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="4.101">just basically talk to you guys for a</text>
  <text start="18.359" dur="5.18">second about what&amp;#39;s going on and kind of</text>
  <text start="20.72" dur="5.17">show you what what&amp;#39;s happening and then</text>
  <text start="23.539" dur="4.961">I&amp;#39;m gonna let you guys decide for</text>
  <text start="25.89" dur="5.059">yourselves what to make of this but the</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="5.28">point of this video is to tell you that</text>
  <text start="30.949" dur="7.421">YouTube has finally decided to become a</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="6.779">discriminatory publisher who well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="4.05">put it this way it&amp;#39;s discrimination if</text>
  <text start="40.559" dur="3.481">they act like their objective and if</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="3.209">they&amp;#39;re a publisher then they&amp;#39;re subject</text>
  <text start="44.04" dur="5.16">to a whole bunch of different laws that</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="5.311">would apply here but they want to have</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="5.519">it both ways they want to be able to</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="5.189">decide that content such as my content</text>
  <text start="54.719" dur="4.381">that I produce here on this channel and</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="4.77">others on YouTube their platform can be</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="5.07">basically thrown into the memory hole</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="6.451">and can be denied equal access to the</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="6.629">same algorithms that promote a myriad of</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="5.79">different other videos and content that</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="5.971">has Pradesh and produced on this</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="5.79">platform so to me this story is</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="6.33">indicative of what&amp;#39;s going on so this is</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="5.7">kind of just a genuine plea for for help</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="4.32">from anyone out there who knows what</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="4.41">what can be done but it&amp;#39;s finally</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="4.62">happening and I&amp;#39;m going to show you some</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="6.259">of these numbers so you guys can see</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="5.88">here just on my analytics you know</text>
  <text start="95.299" dur="4.091">without getting into too much detail you</text>
  <text start="97.92" dur="3.72">know you can see some videos are</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="4.409">monetized and yes that does end up</text>
  <text start="101.64" dur="4.74">happening that&amp;#39;s their new strategy so</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="4.471">that they can&amp;#39;t be accused of complete</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="4.14">discrimination they&amp;#39;ll go through and</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ll ramana Ty&amp;#39;s videos but it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="6.02">after they&amp;#39;ve every one of these videos</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="6.659">mind you was when I first published</text>
  <text start="116.54" dur="4.66">deemed not suitable for advertisers and</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="3.83">demonetized I had to put in a manual</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="4.89">review for each one of these videos and</text>
  <text start="123.049" dur="6.041">only after these videos complete their</text>
  <text start="126.09" dur="4.77">usual initial cycle of views do they end</text>
  <text start="129.09" dur="2.8">up getting Ramana ties meaning I lose</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="4.51">out on</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="5.49">a whole lot of advertising revenue</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="4.86">pretty much on every single video I</text>
  <text start="137.38" dur="5.07">published because of the discriminatory</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="3.9">and biased algorithms that exist at</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="4.41">YouTube but that&amp;#39;s not the worst part</text>
  <text start="144.13" dur="4.92">what&amp;#39;s getting even worse now is look at</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="5.31">this I put this video up yesterday</text>
  <text start="149.05" dur="6.2">afternoon at 6 o&amp;#39;clock and today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s 12 o&amp;#39;clock the next day and I have</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="5.02">16,000 views now my average videos</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="4.14">usually get around eighty to a hundred</text>
  <text start="160.27" dur="4.28">thousand views but that depends</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="6.149">sometimes less sometimes it&amp;#39;s more and</text>
  <text start="164.55" dur="5.8">let me just say I&amp;#39;m tired of this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="168.459" dur="4.771">sick of the way YouTube treats me and</text>
  <text start="170.35" dur="5.19">others like myself who cover this kind</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="4.62">of content on a regular basis we are the</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="5.4">ones being discriminated against fully</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="5.43">by this algorithm by these machine</text>
  <text start="180.94" dur="3.72">learning algorithms and then not to</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="2.55">mention the fact that you have articles</text>
  <text start="184.66" dur="6.84">like this coming out which talk about</text>
  <text start="185.83" dur="7.68">the YouTube has been pushed into not</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="4.4">recommending conspiracy videos whatever</text>
  <text start="193.51" dur="5.49">a conspiracy video means whatever that</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="6.7">category fits for them but obviously</text>
  <text start="199" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s about queueing on and they&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="202.6" dur="5.16">this official this is their official new</text>
  <text start="204.76" dur="5.819">policy that they&amp;#39;re not going to put</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="6.09">videos that they deemed to be conspiracy</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="5.97">theory videos into the up next sidebar</text>
  <text start="213.85" dur="4.05">on YouTube now your if you say to</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="3.75">yourself you know why does that matter</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="4.2">well it matters because it can take a</text>
  <text start="220.299" dur="6.181">person like myself who has a channel</text>
  <text start="222.1" dur="6.419">right with a hundred and fifty or one</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="4.47">hundred and seventy five thousand</text>
  <text start="228.519" dur="7.381">subscribers and it can instantly destroy</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="7.65">my ability to get traffic because you</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="5.13">know there&amp;#39;s 175 thousand people who are</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="4.139">gonna don&amp;#39;t get notices for this content</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="3.989">you know YouTube&amp;#39;s game that algorithm</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="4.051">already we&amp;#39;re how many I don&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.019" dur="3.84">tell you how many people hundreds and</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="4.08">hundreds of people tell me on a regular</text>
  <text start="248.859" dur="4.011">basis that they don&amp;#39;t get notified when</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="5.28">my videos get posted they don&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="6.25">notifications at all when I publish</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="5.19">content and now they&amp;#39;re gaming the other</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="4.65">algorithms for the suggested videos and</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="3.5">the up next videos so there is no way</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="4.61">for this video to</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="5.4">traffic for for simply having an opinion</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="4.08">that they disagree with it YouTube so</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="4.32">they are publishers now and I want to</text>
  <text start="272.46" dur="3.84">make this very clear because just</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="4.5">because they monetize the video doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="4.5">mean see this is how their gaming the</text>
  <text start="279.06" dur="3.63">system against YouTube creators on a</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="3.69">regular basis and I had to share this</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="4.289">because it&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re gonna destroy this channel if</text>
  <text start="286.979" dur="5.761">they keep up these unfair discriminatory</text>
  <text start="289.29" dur="5.49">practices and you know to me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="5.489">like I just want to share this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.78" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s become quite obvious even the last</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="4.41">few videos that I&amp;#39;ve posted and the way</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="4.71">that YouTube is handling the situation I</text>
  <text start="302.639" dur="5.521">think is unfair I think it is</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="6.21">discriminatory toward creators based off</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="4.74">of these bias that are manufactured out</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="4.11">of this fake news media that</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="5.31">continuously generates these outrage</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="6.48">pieces and then people get dragnet</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="6.06">picked up by this censorship like myself</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="5.07">and others who don&amp;#39;t violate policies at</text>
  <text start="324.27" dur="5.25">YouTube although and don&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="4.59">wrong except have an opinion that they</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="4.31">disagree with and want to ask questions</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="4.59">about things they don&amp;#39;t want you to have</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="7.03">asked and now you&amp;#39;re starting to see it</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="6.839">the proofs in the pudding you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m not saying first of all it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="343.139" dur="3.541">like I&amp;#39;m not coming from some crazy</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="4.65">place of like oh this video should have</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="5.04">more views I mean literally I have honor</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="7.43">and 75,000 subscribers and this views</text>

  <text start="364.86" dur="6.65">gotten to a point where it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="368.19" dur="6.39">incredibly obvious that the fix is in</text>
  <text start="371.51" dur="4.33">against myself and others that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="3.18">know what else to do besides reach out</text>
