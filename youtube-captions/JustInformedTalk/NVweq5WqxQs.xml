  <text start="55.53" dur="8.16">saying he&amp;#39;s given us two posts to two</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="7.95">different intelligence documents and the</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="5.539">first says it says right here why are</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="8.52">the above public declassified documents</text>
  <text start="69.229" dur="6.611">highly protected well and then he goes</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="3.36">on here to say scroll through both Docs</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="4.11">and we&amp;#39;re gonna do that because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="6.93">taken some time I&amp;#39;ve read through both</text>
  <text start="79.95" dur="7.23">the documents pretty closely and I found</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="4.89">a few interesting things that I think</text>
  <text start="87.18" dur="7.25">should be brought to our attention so</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="7.71">we&amp;#39;ll start here with the intelligence</text>
  <text start="94.43" dur="6.21">Senate document here from the Select</text>
  <text start="96.84" dur="7.58">Committee on Intelligence now this is a</text>
  <text start="100.64" dur="7.36">basically it&amp;#39;s like a transcribed</text>
  <text start="104.42" dur="6.159">hearing from the CIA&amp;#39;s use of</text>
  <text start="108" dur="6.119">journalists and clergy in intelligence</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="5.43">operations and this was from 1996 and</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="5.311">it&amp;#39;s on from the Select Committee on</text>
  <text start="116.009" dur="5.4">Intelligence and you know you can read</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="4.289">through this for yourself you guys see</text>
  <text start="121.409" dur="6.99">the link I saw the way you guys can</text>
  <text start="123.719" dur="6.861">definitely pop that in but there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="5.351">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of information here</text>
  <text start="130.58" dur="5.63">but what it&amp;#39;s ultimately</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="5.79">painting a picture of is the fact that</text>
  <text start="136.21" dur="7.82">there are several assets intelligence</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="8.52">assets that are being used by the CIA</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="7.03">who are actually active members of the</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="6.42">clergy and of the media which I think we</text>
  <text start="151.06" dur="5.25">all knew but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost an</text>
  <text start="154.48" dur="5.07">investigation into that and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.31" dur="8.15">asking a lot of poignant questions about</text>
  <text start="159.55" dur="8.04">what the intelligence agencies knew and</text>
  <text start="164.46" dur="6.73">you know made there be representatives</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="9.119">of the CIA in the media and then it goes</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="10.26">into a lot of different people who are</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="6.571">raising issues who are giving input but</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="3.78">I encourage every one of you to go read</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="5.22">it it&amp;#39;s a little too much to go through</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="5.79">all here on the video because if I did</text>
  <text start="188.5" dur="4.44">that it would take pretty much an hour</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="4.14">to go through and I don&amp;#39;t think we have</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="4.53">that or I don&amp;#39;t really have that kind of</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="5.22">time to get into that kind of detail on</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="5.13">this particular subject because it is</text>
  <text start="200.38" dur="5.79">open source it&amp;#39;s out there for everyone</text>
  <text start="202.6" dur="5.16">to go check out this is not a state held</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="4.02">secret this isn&amp;#39;t like classified</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="6.75">documents these are just unredacted</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="6.299">release versions of the actual</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="3.93">transcription of the hearing which are</text>
  <text start="216.489" dur="3.181">publicly available for each and every</text>
  <text start="218.44" dur="4.46">one of you and I encourage each and</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="7.379">every one of you to go ahead and type in</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="7.42">you know type in this URL and you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="227.049" dur="7.201">the intelligence senate.gov sites</text>

  <text start="234.25" dur="5.97">to that document now here&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="3.899">great instance then we will go a little</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="3.36">bit more into this one because this</text>
  <text start="241.299" dur="7.021">one&amp;#39;s a little more fascinating to me</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="7.65">and it&amp;#39;s a little bit easier to get some</text>
  <text start="248.32" dur="4.43">draw some actual points out of but this</text>
  <text start="251.23" dur="3.81">was released under the John F Kennedy</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="7.44">assassination records collection Act of</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="9.439">1992 and it&amp;#39;s a document that is</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="7.28">basically it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a whole set of</text>
  <text start="264.479" dur="6.351">correspondences between Admiral</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="7.05">who&amp;#39;s the director of I wanna say he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="4.86">at Naval Intelligence or something to</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="5.54">that degree or central intelligence</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="7.44">director the CIA director and then</text>

  <text start="283.13" dur="7.62">member and they&amp;#39;re actually talking</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="10.71">about clergymen and it all starts with</text>
  <text start="290.75" dur="9.5">this letter from Admiral Turner where he</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="9.15">guess he had been a had an inquiry on</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="6.31">you know about you know US journalists</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="5.1">that are employed by the Central</text>
  <text start="306.56" dur="7.38">Intelligence Agency and he he basically</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="5.28">says my predecessors of de Scott de</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="3.18">established a policy of not disclosing</text>
  <text start="315.68" dur="3.93">the names of persons who have cooperated</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="4.59">with us I&amp;#39;m enclosing a copy of the</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="4.23">agency statement on the subject so</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="6.09">here&amp;#39;s the agency statement on this</text>
  <text start="323.84" dur="7.26">topic of clergymen and media members who</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="5.52">are working for with the CIA and it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="331.1" dur="4.17">reads over the years the CIA has had</text>
  <text start="333.32" dur="3.78">relationships with individuals in many</text>
  <text start="335.27" dur="3.93">walks of American life these</text>
  <text start="337.1" dur="4.86">relationships many of voluntary and</text>
  <text start="339.2" dur="4.74">unpaid nature have reflected the desire</text>
  <text start="341.96" dur="3.69">of Americans to help their country such</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="3.93">relationships have been conducted by the</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="3.51">agency with the clear intent of</text>
  <text start="347.87" dur="3.87">furthering its foreign intelligence</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="4.68">mission and have not been aimed at</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="4.8">influencing or improperly acting on any</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="4.23">American institution genuine concern has</text>
  <text start="356.54" dur="4.83">recently been expressed about CIA</text>
  <text start="358.07" dur="5.49">relations with newsmen and churchmen the</text>
  <text start="361.37" dur="4.92">agency does not believe there has been</text>
  <text start="363.56" dur="5.25">any impropriety on its part in the</text>
  <text start="366.29" dur="4.47">limited use made of persons connected in</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="4.71">some way with American media Church and</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="4.98">missionary organizations nonetheless CIA</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="3.27">recognizes the special status afforded</text>
  <text start="375.74" dur="3.78">these institutions under our</text>
  <text start="376.79" dur="4.83">Constitution and in order to avoid any</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="8.54">appearance of improper use by the agency</text>
  <text start="381.62" dur="9.99">the DCI has decided on a revised policy</text>
  <text start="388.06" dur="5.62">to govern agency relations with these</text>
  <text start="391.61" dur="5.28">groups effective immediately</text>
  <text start="393.68" dur="5.16">CIA will not enter into any paid or</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="3.71">contractual relationships with</text>
  <text start="398.84" dur="2.93">relationship with any</text>
  <text start="400.6" dur="3.78">full-time or part-time news</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="5.37">correspondent accredited by any US news</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="5.91">service newspaper periodical radio or</text>
  <text start="407.14" dur="5.31">television network or station another</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="3.9">one as soon as feasible the agency will</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="3.09">bring existing relationships with</text>
  <text start="414.19" dur="4.1">individuals in these groups into</text>
  <text start="415.54" dur="5.87">conformity with this new policy further</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="5.2">since the CIA has no secret paid or</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="4.3">contractual relationship with any</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="3.84">American clergyman or missionary this</text>
  <text start="425.71" dur="4.89">practice will be continued as a matter</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="5.07">of policy CIA recognizes that members of</text>
  <text start="430.6" dur="3.57">these groups may wish to provide</text>
  <text start="432.4" dur="6.75">information to the CIA on matters of</text>
  <text start="434.17" dur="7.47">foreign intelligence of interest to the</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="3.63">United States government the CIA will</text>
  <text start="441.64" dur="3.69">continue to welcome information</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="4.74">volunteered by such individuals it is</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="4.56">agency policy not to divulge the names</text>
  <text start="447.52" dur="4.83">of cooperating Americans in this regard</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="3.96">CIA will not make public now or in the</text>
  <text start="452.35" dur="4.2">future the names of any cooperating</text>
  <text start="453.85" dur="5.4">journalists or churchmen so I think that</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="5.25">last sent that last paragraph even in</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="3.78">their own statement here which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="2.07">know if you can see when this was</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="3.9">drafted</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="6.6">yeah 1976 was when they drafted this and</text>
  <text start="466.93" dur="6.12">sent this to Congress as an explanation</text>
  <text start="470.47" dur="6.05">for the accusation that there were</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="7.47">clergymen a medium and working with the</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="5.83">CIA and but it says right here that even</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="3.57">if they&amp;#39;re like well even if we have</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="3.66">these sources and they still do exist is</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="4.29">it kinda lays out up here or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.01" dur="5.16">volunteers who they don&amp;#39;t actively</text>
  <text start="488.38" dur="4.08">recruit that they&amp;#39;ll never tell us who</text>
  <text start="491.17" dur="4.62">they are anyway and that&amp;#39;s back from</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="6.45">1976 so and then we have this letter</text>
  <text start="495.79" dur="8.18">that&amp;#39;s written and it goes through a few</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="8.57">different letters but you see here that</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="9.34">there&amp;#39;s some there&amp;#39;s some Corrections</text>
  <text start="507.48" dur="9.55">there&amp;#39;s some there&amp;#39;s some drafts that I</text>
  <text start="513.31" dur="8.19">guess were marked off because they</text>
  <text start="517.03" dur="6.27">didn&amp;#39;t work see here you have the the</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="3.6">records I think this is a picture of the</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="6.8">the envelope that this would have been</text>
  <text start="525.1" dur="7.29">sent in it&amp;#39;s kind of like a</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="3.229">correspondence envelope where you know</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="3.369">you put the knee</text>
  <text start="533.329" dur="6.69">of who&amp;#39;s sending it it&amp;#39;s like this is</text>
  <text start="535.759" dur="6.36">what email was back in the 70s so and</text>
  <text start="540.019" dur="5.01">then they would give it all these marks</text>
  <text start="542.119" dur="7.2">that would um you know depict who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.029" dur="7.831">getting a copy and who&amp;#39;s gonna be asked</text>
  <text start="549.319" dur="7.351">to respond and all that stuff and then</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="7.56">you have a letter from I want to say</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="7.139">yeah this is from Walter foundry who was</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="6.99">a member of Congress to Admiral Turner</text>
  <text start="563.809" dur="7.68">and he&amp;#39;s basically just continuing to</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="6.839">say they&amp;#39;re looking for objective news</text>
  <text start="571.489" dur="6.95">reporting and they think that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.249" dur="6.96">people who are actively working to</text>
  <text start="578.439" dur="5.59">hinder these assassination the JFK</text>
  <text start="581.209" dur="5.31">assassination investigation basically</text>
  <text start="584.029" dur="5.22">and I think the implication through a</text>
  <text start="586.519" dur="5.04">lot of this is that there are people who</text>
  <text start="589.249" dur="3.99">were working actively to suppress</text>
  <text start="591.559" dur="5.101">information regarding JFK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="593.239" dur="5.58">assassination in both the media and the</text>
  <text start="596.66" dur="5.329">clergy who are working on behalf of the</text>
  <text start="598.819" dur="6.33">CIA and that&amp;#39;s pretty much what you get</text>
  <text start="601.989" dur="4.66">the gist of when you&amp;#39;re reading these in</text>
  <text start="605.149" dur="8.49">the important they include all the</text>
  <text start="606.649" dur="8.61">personal notes here and just going for</text>
  <text start="613.639" dur="7.29">this is all kind of documenting that</text>
  <text start="615.259" dur="7.23">it&amp;#39;s all kind of real and you you you</text>
  <text start="620.929" dur="2.91">know you have this correspondence where</text>
  <text start="622.489" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re basically going back and forth</text>
  <text start="623.839" dur="4.771">and Admiral Turner just keeps saying</text>
  <text start="625.129" dur="5.851">well you&amp;#39;re you you don&amp;#39;t you know the</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="3.839">Central Intelligence Agency or it says</text>
  <text start="630.98" dur="3.299">there are no US journalists employed by</text>
  <text start="632.449" dur="3.901">the Central Intelligence Agency i I</text>
  <text start="634.279" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t personally believe that but I</text>
  <text start="636.35" dur="5.699">don&amp;#39;t have any proof otherwise outright</text>
  <text start="639.889" dur="7.081">proof at this point but I can tell you</text>
  <text start="642.049" dur="6.45">right now that it&amp;#39;s very suspicious that</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="5.399">this investigation has been going on</text>
  <text start="648.499" dur="5.67">since the 70s and but could you imagine</text>
  <text start="652.369" dur="5.16">that you know if that&amp;#39;s their stance</text>
  <text start="654.169" dur="8.25">then and where we&amp;#39;re at now how bad if</text>
  <text start="657.529" dur="7.53">things cotton right so now we have</text>
  <text start="662.419" dur="4.321">another one this is a I think this is</text>
  <text start="665.059" dur="5.821">like a news ticker from</text>
  <text start="666.74" dur="6">the CIA where they get their info but</text>
  <text start="670.88" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a little part that&amp;#39;s like kind</text>
  <text start="672.74" dur="3.24">of highlighted here but in and I&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="674.6" dur="3.54">read it to you so that you guys can make</text>

  <text start="892.74" dur="6.95">continuation of the headline probably</text>
  <text start="896.88" dur="5.34">but it says newsmen supplied data to CIA</text>
  <text start="899.69" dur="3.91">and even they&amp;#39;re crossing things I was</text>
  <text start="902.22" dur="3.63">almost like somebody took this and</text>

  <text start="912.63" dur="3.63">that are kind of like underlined and you</text>
  <text start="915.15" dur="2.73">know you talk about the Watergate</text>

  <text start="917.88" dur="4.11">here is kind of blocked out where it</text>
  <text start="920.01" dur="4.14">says O&amp;#39;Leary was mentioned in a category</text>

  <text start="967.26" dur="3.45">another block - now underlined part</text>
  <text start="969.06" dur="4.14">which says in this group sources dick</text>
  <text start="970.71" dur="3.63">indicated the CIA includes Star News</text>
  <text start="973.2" dur="3.72">reporter Jesse</text>
  <text start="974.34" dur="5.01">Jeremiah O&amp;#39;Leary whose name apparently</text>

  <text start="986.07" dur="5.13">these people are all kind of involved in</text>
  <text start="988.65" dur="4.62">and this has been going on since the 70s</text>
  <text start="991.2" dur="4.77">I think is the implication here from</text>
  <text start="993.27" dur="8.72">from cue to tie it all back to what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="995.97" dur="9.96">saying now we go through this and</text>
  <text start="1001.99" dur="6.22">there&amp;#39;s more here about distributing</text>
  <text start="1005.93" dur="4.05">this information and this is the same</text>
  <text start="1008.21" dur="4.1">sis like I said the email sheet where it</text>
  <text start="1009.98" dur="5.51">shows we go who got it win and where</text>
  <text start="1012.31" dur="5.65">then what classification material was</text>
  <text start="1015.49" dur="4.89">when at the end here there is something</text>
  <text start="1017.96" dur="11.45">very fascinating that I want to cover</text>
  <text start="1020.38" dur="11.98">and it is this okay so I think this is a</text>
  <text start="1029.41" dur="5.13">letter draft I&amp;#39;m not sure if it was</text>
