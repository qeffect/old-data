  <text start="148.73" dur="4.95">this guys I want you to know that I have</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="4.89">a theory about what this is all tied</text>
  <text start="153.68" dur="4.56">into and how it&amp;#39;s going to connect and</text>
  <text start="155.24" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s pretty crazy plus stick around for</text>
  <text start="158.24" dur="3.66">at the end of this episode where we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="177.47" dur="5.64">this is the video you saw with this</text>
  <text start="181.31" dur="3.48">article this is the spin of the media&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.11" dur="3.27">putting on what happened but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="4.05">interesting is that if you go to Donald</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="6.84">Trump&amp;#39;s actual Twitter feed he tweeted</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="6.48">this out representative trey gowdy I</text>
  <text start="193.22" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t think so I think what the</text>
  <text start="195.32" dur="3.72">president is doing is expressing</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="3.72">frustration the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="3.75">Sessions should have shared these</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="4.59">reasons for risk use &amp;#39;el before he took</text>
  <text start="202.79" dur="4.35">the job not afterward if I were the</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="5.19">president and I picked someone to be the</text>
  <text start="207.14" dur="6.27">country&amp;#39;s chief law enforcement officer</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="4.59">and they told me later oh by the way I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="3.51">not going to be able to participate in</text>
  <text start="215.06" dur="4.2">the most important case in the office I</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="4.65">would be frustrated too and that&amp;#39;s how I</text>
  <text start="219.26" dur="6.51">read that senator sessions why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="221.57" dur="6.54">you tell me before I picked you there</text>
  <text start="225.77" dur="4.68">are lots of really good lawyers in the</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="6.66">country and he could have picked</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="7.02">somebody else and I wish he did so what</text>
  <text start="234.77" dur="3.87">is this all telling us right in order to</text>
  <text start="237.47" dur="3.75">understand that we have to put it in</text>
  <text start="238.64" dur="4.43">context to some of the past queue posts</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="4.23">that are talking about trey Gowdy so</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="3.64">remember what we just covered here</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="4.259">because it&amp;#39;s going to be important as we</text>
  <text start="246.71" dur="4.74">go look at the old older queue posts</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="4.051">that are going to tell us exactly what</text>
  <text start="251.45" dur="5.07">Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s position is so first we</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="5.31">have this one right and this is from May</text>
  <text start="256.52" dur="5.85">16th so this is a more recent post and</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s saying no such agency verse clowns</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="4.9">in America today now what is being</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="5.469">revealed what will lead to Peter stroke</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="4.56">faces of lawmakers stepping out focus</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="6.571">when did Admiral Rogers step down</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="10.08">reconcile Nunez Gowdy DOJ FBI next half</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="6.899">cue okay this one in and of itself is</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="4.65">basically saying you know you have the</text>
  <text start="283.259" dur="5.22">the NSA versus CIA and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="4.199">the CIA the ones who have infiltrated</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="4.081">the government have been working as bad</text>
  <text start="290.759" dur="4.44">actors for the most part under Brennan</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="8.57">and others in order to infiltrate into</text>
  <text start="295.199" dur="9.571">subvert our Republic by taking over and</text>
  <text start="301.13" dur="6.939">running it as unelected officials in</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="6.06">their capacity but that aside this is</text>
  <text start="308.069" dur="6.66">telling us that when did Admiral Rogers</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="6.6">stepped down and it&amp;#39;s asking us to look</text>
  <text start="314.729" dur="6.72">at the faces of lawmakers stepping out</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="6">and it mentions gaudi&amp;#39;s name and then</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s telling us and this is from May 16</text>
  <text start="323.43" dur="4.38">so this is about 15 days ago and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.949" dur="4.111">saying the next half so we&amp;#39;re entering</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="4.47">the next phase the next half of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="3.87">happening here and obviously we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="4.08">to be looking at the DOJ and the FBI in</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="4.2">particular but it is important to note</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="6.54">that trey Gowdy is coming out to defend</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="6.93">the DOJ and the FBI and you may ask for</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="3.84">a lot of people&amp;#39;s initial reaction is to</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="3.87">be negative and to say that trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="4.5">is a deep state and that he&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="4.2">flipped and that he&amp;#39;s gone down this</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="6.78">whole path but then when he put it in</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="6.93">context with another post here but you</text>
  <text start="358.02" dur="3.239">can also just oppose it against this one</text>
  <text start="360.06" dur="4.139">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about this one too</text>
  <text start="361.259" dur="5.791">really quickly it&amp;#39;s saying not seeking</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="4.77">re-election right and it actually notes</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="6.81">that trey Gowdy is here as a Republican</text>
  <text start="368.969" dur="7.681">who&amp;#39;s not seeking re-election and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="5.63">important to note here is it also notes</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="6.509">here that Goodlatte and Gowdy are</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="6.1">important okay and it&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="383.159" dur="4.98">that the chairman of the House Committee</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="7.919">on the judiciary and the House Oversight</text>
  <text start="388.139" dur="7.441">and Government Reform Committee these</text>
  <text start="393.509" dur="3.541">two individuals are going to play a big</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="4.81">role I think I want in the future but</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="6.04">Gowdy has actually gone out and become a</text>
  <text start="400.39" dur="7.43">part of that new role and I think that</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="8.49">are all working with and around cue and</text>
  <text start="407.82" dur="5.86">let&amp;#39;s just say there is a symbiosis to</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="4.74">everything that&amp;#39;s going on here and that</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="4.79">we&amp;#39;ve been told by cue in the past about</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="5.24">what all of this is gonna end up meaning</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="7.57">okay and what is it gonna mean well</text>
  <text start="421.56" dur="7.78">here&amp;#39;s a hint as to what Q is inferring</text>
  <text start="426.04" dur="6.48">from January 14th of 2018 he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="429.34" dur="5.52">us to trust sessions he&amp;#39;s saying Trey</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="5.4">Gowdy&amp;#39;s departure from the House Ethics</text>
  <text start="434.86" dur="5.49">Committee he&amp;#39;s talking about how trey is</text>
  <text start="437.92" dur="4.47">not going to testify how he&amp;#39;s not needed</text>
  <text start="440.35" dur="5.13">to testify how we have to think</text>
  <text start="442.39" dur="6.75">logically and how we there&amp;#39;s no need to</text>
  <text start="445.48" dur="7.62">step down if needed to testify right so</text>
  <text start="449.14" dur="7.86">he&amp;#39;s not stepped stepping down because</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="5.97">of the fact that he stepped down he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457" dur="6.63">not being like put into a position to be</text>
  <text start="459.07" dur="6.06">forced to testify don&amp;#39;t chase miss info</text>
  <text start="463.63" dur="4.68">so it&amp;#39;s saying there could be missing</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="5.64">foe regarding the the circumstance of</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="5.76">trey Gowdy and it says this is the most</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="6.57">important part here what role might trey</text>
  <text start="474.07" dur="5.46">gowdy be walking into now my speculation</text>
  <text start="477.34" dur="3.96">on this is because there&amp;#39;s no the only</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="3.8">prerequisite to becoming I believe a</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="4.65">Supreme Court justice really is</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="5.32">attaining a presidential nomination and</text>
  <text start="485.95" dur="4.77">if Trump is aware that there are several</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="4.29">members of the Supreme Court who are</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="5.31">going to be leaving and he wants to put</text>
  <text start="492.94" dur="4.59">a member into the Supreme Court would it</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="3.51">not make sense that somebody like trey</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="4.59">Gowdy me might might have made that</text>
  <text start="499.54" dur="5.91">shortlist and further I would even</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="4.83">suggest that it may be possible that not</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="4.02">only is trey Gowdy on that short list</text>
  <text start="506.95" dur="5.16">but trey Gowdy has been informed through</text>
  <text start="509.47" dur="5.07">back-channel sources that he is on that</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="5.1">short list and Trump is actually okay</text>
  <text start="514.54" dur="4.86">with him going out and supporting the</text>
  <text start="517.21" dur="5.24">FBI in supporting the DOJ and not</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="6.21">jumping on to Trump&amp;#39;s necessary</text>
  <text start="522.45" dur="6.79">bandwagon because it&amp;#39;s actually better</text>
  <text start="525.61" dur="5.46">for him to look more nonpartisan than it</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="3.18">is for him to look very partisan at this</text>
  <text start="531.07" dur="2.91">point because if you&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="532.42" dur="3.63">somebody nominated as a Supreme</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="4.32">justice obviously you wouldn&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="5.82">out there in a very partisan tone</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="6.24">yelling and preaching to the other party</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="5.1">the the the opposition party and saying</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="3.78">you know all these negative things</text>
  <text start="546.97" dur="3.989">because that&amp;#39;s going to end up coming</text>
  <text start="548.32" dur="5.819">back to bite them at a let&amp;#39;s say a</text>
  <text start="550.959" dur="5.011">hearing to confirm him as a Supreme</text>
  <text start="554.139" dur="3.81">Court justice upon a nomination from</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="3.479">President United States and the one</text>
  <text start="557.949" dur="2.811">thing that trey gowdy is going for Milo</text>
  <text start="559.449" dur="3.811">a lot of people want to knock at all</text>
  <text start="560.76" dur="4.06">they want to say yeah it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="4.019">trey gowdy could never become a Supreme</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="4.41">Court justice so on and so forth the one</text>
  <text start="567.279" dur="4.831">thing he has going for him is that he</text>
  <text start="569.23" dur="4.979">has the people a lot of people like him</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="4.529">and I think he seems like a pretty nice</text>
  <text start="574.209" dur="5.971">guy pretty trustworthy guy he seems like</text>
  <text start="576.639" dur="4.981">the information and research that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="4.32">been involved in up to this point has</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="4.469">been very important the oversight he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.5" dur="4.38">tried to provide through the House</text>
  <text start="586.089" dur="5.461">Ethics Committee and the subpoenas that</text>
  <text start="588.88" dur="4.199">he&amp;#39;s helped issue to the department&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.55" dur="4.95">like the DOJ and the FBI and other</text>
  <text start="593.079" dur="5.161">organizations all of that work he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="3.87">he even saw you could see the</text>
  <text start="598.24" dur="4.19">frustration on his face but you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="600.37" dur="5.37">this like little air of contentment</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="5.62">lately in my opinion having seen him</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="4.829">from before maybe a year ago to now</text>
  <text start="608.05" dur="7.89">you&amp;#39;ve seen this kind of different tinge</text>
  <text start="610.569" dur="7.531">to his way of judiciously explaining and</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="4.709">exploring things that are happening and</text>
  <text start="618.1" dur="4.53">I think that&amp;#39;s all related to the fact</text>
  <text start="620.649" dur="3.75">that he knows he may be up for that</text>
  <text start="622.63" dur="4.829">position and he understands the gravity</text>
  <text start="624.399" dur="5.19">of what that position would entail and</text>
  <text start="627.459" dur="3.961">he understands that if he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="629.589" dur="4.081">groom himself for that position when it</text>
  <text start="631.42" dur="5.64">becomes available he needs to start</text>
  <text start="633.67" dur="6.12">doing it now rather than later and if</text>
  <text start="637.06" dur="4.649">you look at the reports online this all</text>
  <text start="639.79" dur="4.2">backs up this theory because if you</text>
  <text start="641.709" dur="4.651">think about how Q works and how Trump</text>

  <text start="654.49" dur="5.909">or open for light I don&amp;#39;t wanna use that</text>
  <text start="656.74" dur="8.039">word illuminated but Q has shed a light</text>
  <text start="660.399" dur="5.581">on to what has been sitting right</text>
  <text start="664.779" dur="2.771">beneath the surface that we just</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="2.95">couldn&amp;#39;t see him he kind of shook the</text>
  <text start="667.55" dur="3.45">the surface and broke the surface</text>
  <text start="668.93" dur="3.599">tension of the water and showed us just</text>
  <text start="671" dur="4.399">a little bit of what&amp;#39;s beneath the</text>
  <text start="672.529" dur="5.581">surface and in doing so he&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="675.399" dur="4.151">conscripted so many people to join the</text>
  <text start="678.11" dur="3.419">effort and start doing their own</text>
  <text start="679.55" dur="4.8">research that it&amp;#39;s become viral just to</text>
  <text start="681.529" dur="4.951">explore what&amp;#39;s going on and you can see</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="4.35">the disinformation is is just rampant</text>
  <text start="686.48" dur="3.9">and only thati of the propaganda and you</text>
  <text start="688.7" dur="4.05">have the trolls and the shills who want</text>
  <text start="690.38" dur="6.78">to attack and you see here you have trey</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="7.86">gowdy right after he basically he</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="5.46">decided not to take it says wednesday</text>
  <text start="700.61" dur="4.08">morning this is on february 1st was the</text>
  <text start="702.62" dur="4.56">Wednesday following that or before that</text>

  <text start="712.49" dur="3.45">talking about how he was nominated for a</text>
  <text start="713.87" dur="4.44">judge position that he turned now and</text>
  <text start="715.94" dur="3.69">you wonder why why would he turn down</text>
  <text start="718.31" dur="2.94">the judge position and why would he</text>
  <text start="719.63" dur="3.329">decide not to run for a second term is</text>
  <text start="721.25" dur="5.25">it because he actually believes there is</text>

  <text start="732.86" dur="6.78">you think down in the comments but</text>
  <text start="734.63" dur="7.22">that&amp;#39;s basically the gist of what I have</text>
  <text start="739.64" dur="5.699">put together to this point based on</text>
  <text start="741.85" dur="5.5">doing some research and taking what I</text>
  <text start="745.339" dur="3.961">know about cues posts and putting that</text>
  <text start="747.35" dur="4.83">all together and trying to give you guys</text>
  <text start="749.3" dur="4.56">a well-thought-out interpretation of the</text>
  <text start="752.18" dur="6.36">information that has been made available</text>
  <text start="753.86" dur="6.81">to this point now we&amp;#39;ll jump right into</text>
  <text start="758.54" dur="5.13">the next thing because I think it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="760.67" dur="4.409">important thing to note so there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="763.67" dur="4.38">a lot of speculation on when is cue</text>
  <text start="765.079" dur="6.361">coming back when is cue coming back well</text>
  <text start="768.05" dur="5.57">if we look at some other things that the</text>
  <text start="771.44" dur="4.5">Dan ons have pointed out on the boards</text>
  <text start="773.62" dur="4.75">recently the one thing that stands out</text>
  <text start="775.94" dur="3.99">and I don&amp;#39;t know if this makes a whole</text>
  <text start="778.37" dur="6.089">lot of sense to every single person out</text>
  <text start="779.93" dur="7.71">there but a post from a long time ago</text>
  <text start="784.459" dur="5.271">said 10 days darkness and it wasn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="787.64" dur="4.98">one post it was actually two posts</text>
  <text start="789.73" dur="7.859">another one said 10 days darkness and</text>
  <text start="792.62" dur="8.55">these are both from November 5th of 2017</text>
  <text start="797.589" dur="8.951">now how does that relate to what</text>
  <text start="801.17" dur="8.069">we are going over here today well it has</text>
  <text start="806.54" dur="7.459">actually been found to correlate with a</text>
  <text start="809.239" dur="9.69">span of time from which cue took a long</text>
  <text start="813.999" dur="9.49">absent or absence from posting on the H</text>
  <text start="818.929" dur="9.24">hamboards why is that relevant well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="823.489" dur="8.551">relevant because in the sense that there</text>
  <text start="828.169" dur="7.65">was a period before in late December</text>
  <text start="832.04" dur="8.009">when cue actually stopped posting and he</text>
  <text start="835.819" dur="6.721">ended up not posting for almost exactly</text>
  <text start="840.049" dur="7.171">10 days and we&amp;#39;re gonna look at that and</text>
  <text start="842.54" dur="8.909">here it is it was on a Christmas Day cue</text>
  <text start="847.22" dur="7.469">posted 10 10 9 and what a lot of people</text>
  <text start="851.449" dur="7.08">have interpreted that to mean is 10 - 10</text>
  <text start="854.689" dur="6.96">or 9 days and it was between 9 and 10</text>
  <text start="858.529" dur="5.25">days exactly that cue decided to post</text>
  <text start="861.649" dur="4.711">again so it was like he was living it</text>
  <text start="863.779" dur="5.25">leaving us a marker say he was coming</text>
  <text start="866.36" dur="5.879">back and he did at January 3rd from</text>
  <text start="869.029" dur="6.571">December 25th which is nine and a half</text>
  <text start="872.239" dur="5.551">almost 10 days and that&amp;#39;s what people</text>
  <text start="875.6" dur="4.919">are using is the speculative base for</text>
  <text start="877.79" dur="5.129">when they suspect that cue will return</text>
  <text start="880.519" dur="3.141">to the boards here as we have not heard</text>
  <text start="882.919" dur="4.86">from him since</text>
  <text start="883.66" dur="8.5">May 22nd now May 22nd would mean that</text>
  <text start="887.779" dur="9.66">June 1st would be the 10-day marker so</text>
  <text start="892.16" dur="8.039">sometime between now and the next 24</text>
  <text start="897.439" dur="4.26">hours we&amp;#39;re expecting to hear from cue</text>
  <text start="900.199" dur="4.35">so you guys let me know what you think</text>
  <text start="901.699" dur="5.61">about that down in the comments I think</text>
  <text start="904.549" dur="4.801">that&amp;#39;s a very interesting theory I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="907.309" dur="3.99">know how much I can really give you</text>
  <text start="909.35" dur="3.599">otherwise to try to verify it or to give</text>
  <text start="911.299" dur="4.65">you more information about it</text>
  <text start="912.949" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s interesting to note that it&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="915.949" dur="9.651">in a lot of tens so 7 and 10 and just</text>
  <text start="920.449" dur="7.23">talking about the 2 and 8 is 10 and just</text>
  <text start="925.6" dur="5.019">different things that we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="927.679" dur="4.671">that are noticeable when you examine</text>
  <text start="930.619" dur="4.221">exactly what</text>
  <text start="932.35" dur="6.72">happened on these days and how we have</text>
  <text start="934.84" dur="6.75">the 10 10 9 and operational window 5 6</text>
  <text start="939.07" dur="6.06">it was operation going on and there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="941.59" dur="5.04">much going on right now at the White</text>
  <text start="945.13" dur="5.22">House and in the world I mean obviously</text>
  <text start="946.63" dur="5.13">you have things going on like it Kim</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="3.9">Kardashian at the White House today</text>
  <text start="951.76" dur="3.84">which I didn&amp;#39;t see any video from I</text>
  <text start="954.25" dur="3.54">think the media is trying to really put</text>
  <text start="955.6" dur="4.26">a blackout on that because it could</text>
  <text start="957.79" dur="5.19">actually make Trump look favorable to</text>
  <text start="959.86" dur="5.97">people outside of the realm of those who</text>
  <text start="962.98" dur="10.44">have critical thinking ability and some</text>
  <text start="965.83" dur="8.88">ration rational logic but that aside it</text>
  <text start="973.42" dur="2.97">seems like there&amp;#39;s a lot of progress</text>
  <text start="974.71" dur="3.24">being made and it seems like Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="976.39" dur="3.09">taking some time to focus on other</text>
  <text start="977.95" dur="4.17">issues and I think it&amp;#39;s really good to</text>
  <text start="979.48" dur="6.15">note that the meeting with Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="982.12" dur="5.16">seems to still be on and that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="985.63" dur="3.69">lot of progress being made in those</text>
  <text start="987.28" dur="3.51">negotiations and I think there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="989.32" dur="3.6">of progress being made behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="990.79" dur="3.69">with Iran especially since the media</text>
  <text start="992.92" dur="3.12">seems to report there&amp;#39;s no progress</text>
  <text start="994.48" dur="2.97">being made that would lead me to believe</text>
  <text start="996.04" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s a lot going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="997.45" dur="3.9">that we&amp;#39;re not aware of as was the case</text>
  <text start="999.82" dur="3.63">with North Korea and I think everyone</text>
  <text start="1001.35" dur="4.05">will be pleasantly surprised if they</text>
  <text start="1003.45" dur="5.22">just stick around and wait to see what</text>
  <text start="1005.4" dur="5.67">happens with Iran but that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>

  <text start="1022.83" dur="5.879">you guys could even imagine and the</text>
  <text start="1026.49" dur="4.38">whole reality of it is is that even the</text>
