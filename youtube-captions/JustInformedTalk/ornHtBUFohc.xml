  <text start="893.16" dur="3.929">was not the Russian government and I</text>
  <text start="895.29" dur="4.019">think we all can guess who it was a lot</text>
  <text start="897.089" dur="4.92">of people have speculated it was rich</text>
  <text start="899.309" dur="5.22">who was a staffer at the DNC</text>

  <text start="911.459" dur="5.31">who are running now would but it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="926.97" dur="2.68">fact that</text>
  <text start="927.58" dur="3.48">knew it was possible he was the one who</text>
  <text start="929.65" dur="3.66">gave the information in WikiLeaks but</text>
  <text start="931.06" dur="4.26">with that being a possibility just</text>
  <text start="933.31" dur="3.6">keeping going keeping going further it</text>
  <text start="935.32" dur="5.49">says it gives the one in the kill box</text>
  <text start="936.91" dur="5.46">and says how does one provide content to</text>
  <text start="940.81" dur="3.66">WikiLeaks computer-to-computer</text>

  <text start="953.11" dur="4.59">hmm I wonder that who that&amp;#39;s referencing</text>
  <text start="955.6" dur="3.9">does CrowdStrike possess government</text>

  <text start="979.21" dur="3.42">saying here I mean most of you probably</text>
  <text start="980.8" dur="3.51">get it really clearly but just to kind</text>
  <text start="982.63" dur="4.23">of clarify what Q is saying here is that</text>
  <text start="984.31" dur="3.36">we have direct evidence and were going</text>
  <text start="986.86" dur="2.4">to talk about that a little bit later</text>
  <text start="987.67" dur="4.05">that seems to point to the fact that</text>
  <text start="989.26" dur="5.43">sets rich took the information on a jump</text>
  <text start="991.72" dur="5.16">drive then gave it by hand to WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="994.69" dur="4.5">who then was you know releasing that</text>
  <text start="996.88" dur="3.51">information which exposed the DNC but</text>
  <text start="999.19" dur="5.34">that CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="1000.39" dur="6.48">you know is it was taken as the the you</text>

  <text start="1021.51" dur="3.09">capability similar to that we have</text>
  <text start="1022.89" dur="3.54">something that would probably supersede</text>

  <text start="1041.55" dur="4.05">you can go through to the poisonous tree</text>

  <text start="1695.43" dur="4.11">message in a nutshell you know I think</text>
  <text start="1697.56" dur="3.78">one of the things that we really let the</text>
  <text start="1699.54" dur="4.26">media and these big tech corporations</text>
  <text start="1701.34" dur="6.54">and the politicians and everyone else</text>
  <text start="1703.8" dur="6.84">you know win at in some regard some of</text>
  <text start="1707.88" dur="5.01">the time is in dividing us in making us</text>
  <text start="1710.64" dur="5.22">think that it&amp;#39;s us versus them you know</text>
  <text start="1712.89" dur="5.31">sometimes I have to really take you know</text>
  <text start="1715.86" dur="4.68">stock of everything and rethink how I</text>
  <text start="1718.2" dur="4.86">approach everything because I have to</text>
  <text start="1720.54" dur="4.98">remind myself that I&amp;#39;m here as a servant</text>
  <text start="1723.06" dur="5.73">of God I&amp;#39;m here doing my best to honor</text>
  <text start="1725.52" dur="5.01">God and live a christ-like life and in</text>
  <text start="1728.79" dur="4.98">doing that you have to try to reach out</text>
  <text start="1730.53" dur="5.19">and show others that you know what</text>
  <text start="1733.77" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re doing is not necessarily to hurt</text>
  <text start="1735.72" dur="6.12">them but rather to help us all and I</text>
  <text start="1738.63" dur="4.92">think that that is is a big trap that</text>
  <text start="1741.84" dur="3.84">allowed us fall into I know I do so</text>
  <text start="1743.55" dur="4.77">hopefully those words kind of maybe</text>
  <text start="1745.68" dur="5.1">influenced your or spiritually</text>
  <text start="1748.32" dur="4.35">reinvigorate you to go out and reach</text>
  <text start="1750.78" dur="5.37">across to the other side and try to help</text>
  <text start="1752.67" dur="5.34">those who are you know not doing so well</text>
  <text start="1756.15" dur="3.84">who are believing these lines who are</text>
  <text start="1758.01" dur="4.2">bolstering and pushing these lines you</text>
  <text start="1759.99" dur="4.17">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a tough thing for me and</text>
  <text start="1762.21" dur="4.14">as a as a Christian who is imperfect who</text>
  <text start="1764.16" dur="4.62">understands that I understand that you</text>
  <text start="1766.35" dur="6.06">know life&amp;#39;s about growing and learning</text>
  <text start="1768.78" dur="5.01">so and becoming stronger and wiser and I</text>
  <text start="1772.41" dur="3.42">pray for that every single day and I</text>
