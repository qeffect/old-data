  <text start="171.18" dur="5.699">this on this channel today a little bit</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="6.12">but we&amp;#39;re gonna mainly focus on what</text>
  <text start="176.879" dur="6.631">happened to this individual and how this</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="5.13">is all connected to you know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="4.399">going on in the Middle East overall so</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="5.4">this is a part of a statement from</text>
  <text start="187.909" dur="4.631">President Trump himself is released by</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="3.269">the White House whitehouse.gov and I</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="3.599">want to share this last part here</text>
  <text start="193.859" dur="3.901">because I think it&amp;#39;s people have to</text>
  <text start="196.139" dur="3.271">understand what this meant what</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="3.87">President Trump was saying when he said</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="3.81">this it says last night was a great</text>
  <text start="201.63" dur="2.07">night for the United States and for the</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="4.049">world</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="5.73">a brutal killer one who has caused so</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="4.141">much hardship and death was violently</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="5.459">eliminated he will never again harm</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="6.57">another innocent man woman or child he</text>
  <text start="214.889" dur="5.85">died like a dog he died like a coward</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="4.909">the world is now a much safer place god</text>
  <text start="220.739" dur="5.491">bless the United States of America so</text>
  <text start="222.889" dur="4.96">there&amp;#39;s a lot to pick apart in the</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="2.909">speech that President Trump gave and</text>
  <text start="227.849" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about some things but</text>
  <text start="229.139" dur="4.44">not everything so I encourage you guys</text>
  <text start="232.139" dur="2.91">to go out in the comments and start you</text>
  <text start="233.579" dur="4.5">know the conversation down there as well</text>
  <text start="235.049" dur="4.83">but this is an important reference the</text>
  <text start="238.079" dur="4.171">reference to dog is a few different</text>
  <text start="239.879" dur="6.901">meanings first of all remember the fact</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="6.329">that in Middle East Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="246.78" dur="4.019">culture I guess dogs are considered</text>
  <text start="248.579" dur="6.211">unclean and so on so there&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="5.461">that is just being that one of the</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="3.629">bigger insults that you can give to</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="3.87">somebody so saying that you know may</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="4.291">resonate more with people in the Middle</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="5.3">East and therefore that&amp;#39;s what President</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="5.92">Trump is trying to do he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="5.34">as basically say this guy died a coward</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="4.06">therefore why would you want to you know</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="5.22">make him a martyr because he&amp;#39;s just he</text>
  <text start="272.69" dur="5.25">ran into a tunnel then literally blew</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="5.19">himself up and his three children and</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.67">died in the most shameful way that a</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="6.51">coward would ever do you know it just</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="6.81">obviously that fat but remember remember</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="6.12">every dog has his day do you remember no</text>
  <text start="290.42" dur="4.74">name this is really all connected back I</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="4.68">think to no name and then we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="295.16" dur="5.1">talk about the Benghazi there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s kind of not a new theory it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="300.26" dur="2.91">old theory that we&amp;#39;re gonna look at</text>
  <text start="302" dur="3.24">again because it ties everything</text>
  <text start="303.17" dur="3.66">together and it kind of helps us</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="3.6">understand what possibly could be</text>
  <text start="306.83" dur="5.82">happening and in order to ask the right</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="4.68">questions I think but let&amp;#39;s just look at</text>
  <text start="312.65" dur="3.57">this for what it is</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="4.71">remember when Q reminded us of the</text>
  <text start="316.22" dur="6">connection direct connection between</text>
  <text start="318.23" dur="5.91">John McCain and Abu Bakr al-baghdadi and</text>
  <text start="322.22" dur="4.38">their little meetings that they kept</text>
  <text start="324.14" dur="5.22">having I think they were in Syria when</text>
  <text start="326.6" dur="5.04">John McCain was helping formulate the</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="5.43">strategy to arm the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="331.64" dur="6.69">right that was the whole plot you know</text>
  <text start="334.79" dur="5.19">ploy so this is where we&amp;#39;re gonna begin</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="4.8">because this is really an important</text>
  <text start="339.98" dur="6.48">thing to understand that Q is pointed</text>
  <text start="343.13" dur="5.31">out and you know we got to remember that</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="6.45">they were having these face-to-face</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="9.42">sit-down meetings and and don&amp;#39;t forget</text>
  <text start="352.91" dur="8.16">this that we actually held in detention</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="6.42">Abu Bakr al Baghdadi at one point in</text>
  <text start="361.07" dur="6.48">Camp Bucca in a prison camp a military</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="5.82">prison camp in 2009 until the Obama</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="4.77">White House agreed to let him go well</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="4.92">isn&amp;#39;t that convenient we decide to let</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="6.36">go the guy who ends up becoming the head</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="7.8">of the supposed Caliphate which is Isis</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="5.88">and that in and of itself is something</text>
  <text start="382.82" dur="6.12">that we should really keep in mind and</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="6.54">remember this may have been some sort of</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="4.56">coordinated effort to destabilize that</text>
  <text start="391.1" dur="6.62">region to open up the trafficking lanes</text>
  <text start="393.5" dur="7.07">to provide a way to divert</text>
  <text start="397.72" dur="5.79">pipelines from different areas across</text>
  <text start="400.57" dur="5.27">the Middle East into Europe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.51" dur="4.71">really a lot of you know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="4.78">very broad geopolitical implications</text>
  <text start="408.22" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s also regional implications so</text>
  <text start="410.62" dur="5.04">you have to remember that there is a lot</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="5.28">more to this than most people will ever</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="6.48">really understand but don&amp;#39;t forget that</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="5.16">we held this guy just like we had all</text>
  <text start="422.14" dur="3.68">these contacts with Osama bin Laden</text>
  <text start="424.21" dur="5.58">before he ended up doing what he did</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="5.92">sometimes it makes it&amp;#39;s very strange</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="4.17">when you start looking at how our</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="3.9">connect our connections are really close</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="3.06">what these people will end up being you</text>
  <text start="435.64" dur="4.92">know our public enemy number one</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="4.83">a lot at the time now there are some</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="2.79">theories out there that we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="3">about which I think are really important</text>
  <text start="443.35" dur="3.54">but first we should probably go back and</text>
  <text start="444.85" dur="3.99">read what cue has to say about all this</text>
  <text start="446.89" dur="3.84">about Isis and everything we&amp;#39;ve had a</text>

  <text start="598.87" dur="6.45">cute so when you take all this and you</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="5.01">start adding it together then it starts</text>
  <text start="605.32" dur="6.84">to paint a really grim picture</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="4.98">especially when you look at certain</text>
  <text start="612.16" dur="2.31">information that&amp;#39;s been brought forward</text>
  <text start="613.48" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re going to talk about these two</text>
  <text start="614.47" dur="5.58">theories and then we&amp;#39;re gonna kind of</text>
  <text start="616.54" dur="5.1">get into other stuff but remember I did</text>
  <text start="620.05" dur="4.05">this video the other day we talked to</text>
  <text start="621.64" dur="5.07">some of these whistleblowers coming</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="6.06">forward about Benghazi three incredible</text>
  <text start="626.71" dur="6.18">Americans we had sergeant first class</text>

  <text start="632.89" dur="5.22">sergeant first class</text>
  <text start="633.85" dur="7.65">I should say William hotel and a couple</text>
  <text start="638.11" dur="5.82">of AOC specialists Makhno and Josh</text>
  <text start="641.5" dur="3.69">Salomon and they kind they came forward</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="4.56">to talk about what happened in Benghazi</text>
  <text start="645.19" dur="5.88">that day and this is a theory about what</text>
  <text start="648.49" dur="4.44">happened and how it all came to being</text>
  <text start="651.07" dur="5.19">and what happened with Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="652.93" dur="5.25">and how the servers are all connected to</text>
  <text start="656.26" dur="3.99">this and how it all ties really back to</text>
  <text start="658.18" dur="3.45">the Clinton Foundation this was a theory</text>
  <text start="660.25" dur="3.12">that was posted</text>
  <text start="661.63" dur="4.8">I believe on the boards a while ago I</text>
  <text start="663.37" dur="4.92">think it was an FBI one of the FBI in on</text>
  <text start="666.43" dur="4.459">posts or something similar in that vein</text>
  <text start="668.29" dur="6.84">that came back it came out back in</text>
  <text start="670.889" dur="6.581">around the time of the election so what</text>
  <text start="675.13" dur="4.74">does this say well I want to read these</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="3.929">two kind of portions to you and I want</text>
  <text start="679.87" dur="5.79">you guys to really just take these with</text>
  <text start="681.399" dur="6.24">a grain of salt but you know listen to</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="4.65">this as a theory it says ultimately</text>
  <text start="687.639" dur="4.56">Hillary sold weapons and coordinates of</text>
  <text start="690.31" dur="4.079">the Chinook chopper carrying the 12</text>

  <text start="709.779" dur="4.321">what this person is saying theoretically</text>
  <text start="712.269" dur="4.74">happen or they&amp;#39;re alleging to have</text>
  <text start="714.1" dur="4.5">happened it says she used Stephens to</text>

  <text start="726.399" dur="5.31">she had Stephens in the Pentagon getting</text>
  <text start="728.56" dur="5.55">a server to take with him to Benghazi</text>
  <text start="731.709" dur="3.48">there was a backup server that was the</text>
  <text start="734.11" dur="3.479">one in her closet</text>
  <text start="735.189" dur="5.371">she then allowed the bin Laden&amp;#39;s to aim</text>

  <text start="740.56" dur="5.04">compound Stevens had no idea what he</text>
  <text start="743.139" dur="5.341">brokered have had no idea that server</text>
  <text start="745.6" dur="5.729">contained top-secret nuclear files the</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="4.859">plan was going great until seals and CIA</text>
  <text start="751.329" dur="3.99">guys from the other compound went over</text>
  <text start="753.339" dur="3.661">to assist she did not know they were</text>
  <text start="755.319" dur="4.531">going to assist and were ordered to</text>
  <text start="757" dur="5.069">stand down the plan was to kill Stevens</text>
  <text start="759.85" dur="3.929">and his guys and in the process allow</text>
  <text start="762.069" dur="4.651">bin Laden family to have nuclear secrets</text>
  <text start="763.779" dur="4.951">to one day avenge their son the plan</text>
  <text start="766.72" dur="4.08">went south when those guys from the</text>
  <text start="768.73" dur="4.74">other compound refused to stand down</text>
  <text start="770.8" dur="4.709">they get to the compound in time to</text>
  <text start="773.47" dur="5.07">rescue a few guys in what else they</text>
  <text start="775.509" dur="4.651">ended up with the server once word got</text>
  <text start="778.54" dur="3.779">back to the White House that Stevens</text>
  <text start="780.16" dur="4.2">guys were rescued Hillary ordered a</text>
  <text start="782.319" dur="4.051">complete stand down to the rescue</text>
  <text start="784.36" dur="4.079">mission and then told the commander of</text>

  <text start="819.519" dur="3.57">immediately break standard protocol and</text>

  <text start="823.089" dur="4.47">server in case they are overwritten by</text>
  <text start="825.069" dur="4.26">this time Hillary has already fabricated</text>
  <text start="827.559" dur="3.69">the story that a pastor in California</text>
  <text start="829.329" dur="5.88">made a YouTube video that caused a mob</text>

  <text start="860.199" dur="4.14">did she know that it was at that time</text>
  <text start="862" dur="5.069">our own Intel community began to hack</text>

  <text start="873.67" dur="4.919">time they knew Trump was going to win</text>
  <text start="876.129" dur="4.291">here is even more crazy information list</text>
  <text start="878.589" dur="4.261">of senators who know about it there was</text>
  <text start="880.42" dur="4.649">a total of 1.7 trillion given and grants</text>

  <text start="895.42" dur="5.039">have hundreds of these entities alone</text>
  <text start="897.42" dur="4.959">the money was granted by Obama to</text>
  <text start="900.459" dur="4.68">Mideast nations then given back to our</text>

  <text start="913.089" dur="4.831">lead to all who are guilty and it gets</text>
  <text start="915.79" dur="3.75">even crazier Chris Stevens had a few</text>
  <text start="917.92" dur="4.649">more gifts that he did not know anything</text>
  <text start="919.54" dur="6.57">about these gifts were 7 Davy Crockett</text>
  <text start="922.569" dur="5.281">m38 a nuclear mortars Obama had the</text>

  <text start="927.85" dur="3.419">the Syrians the</text>
  <text start="928.72" dur="5.01">group in Benghazi ultimately in</text>
  <text start="931.269" dur="4.86">September one of these weapons where it</text>
  <text start="933.73" dur="5.31">was used and killed nearly 20 Russians</text>
  <text start="936.129" dur="4.56">Russia troops in Syria</text>
  <text start="939.04" dur="3.899">that&amp;#39;s right american nukes killing</text>
  <text start="940.689" dur="4.231">Russian troops remember Putin ordered 40</text>
  <text start="942.939" dur="4.561">million Russian citizens to perform a</text>
  <text start="944.92" dur="5.43">nuclear evacuation that was his response</text>
  <text start="947.5" dur="5.879">to send a message to Hillary what he was</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="5.13">preparing for if she got in now we know</text>
  <text start="953.379" dur="4.351">that the remaining six Davy Crockett&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="955.48" dur="8.45">are in the hands of Iran and we also</text>
  <text start="957.73" dur="6.2">know that Obama or having lifted the</text>
  <text start="964.05" dur="6.43">nuclear restrictions on Iran we also</text>
  <text start="967.24" dur="6.599">know that Obama gave Iran 150 billion</text>
  <text start="970.48" dur="5.789">dollars so again distressing this is</text>
  <text start="973.839" dur="5.521">somebody else&amp;#39;s alleged theory of what</text>
  <text start="976.269" dur="5.791">happened but it&amp;#39;s an interesting thought</text>
  <text start="979.36" dur="5.43">wouldn&amp;#39;t you say and I&amp;#39;m presenting it</text>
  <text start="982.06" dur="6.12">here to you and the hopes that we can</text>
  <text start="984.79" dur="5.69">endeavor to maybe dig a little deeper</text>
  <text start="988.18" dur="7.44">into what is being said here and maybe</text>
  <text start="990.48" dur="7.089">put some things together that could make</text>
  <text start="995.62" dur="4.079">this make a lot more sense but I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="997.569" dur="6.21">leave it for us all to continue to dig</text>
  <text start="999.699" dur="5.971">on as we move forward but with that a</text>
  <text start="1003.779" dur="5.221">few other stories I guess we&amp;#39;ll touch on</text>
  <text start="1005.67" dur="5.339">before we wrap it up there&amp;#39;s this big</text>
  <text start="1009" dur="4.079">story now you know they&amp;#39;re coming out</text>

  <text start="1108.95" dur="3.66">gonna be able to touch on every single</text>
  <text start="1110.3" dur="4.08">thing but some things I want to</text>
  <text start="1112.61" dur="4.17">highlight first off they talked about</text>
  <text start="1114.38" dur="4.32">the use of blackberries and that is</text>
  <text start="1116.78" dur="6.21">really important because blackberries</text>
  <text start="1118.7" dur="6.39">are one of the few devices which it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1122.99" dur="5.55">talked about in this article are used by</text>
  <text start="1125.09" dur="5.67">intelligence officials for the fact that</text>
  <text start="1128.54" dur="4.68">they can be encrypted in a way where</text>
  <text start="1130.76" dur="5.01">they cannot be hacked and that is one of</text>
  <text start="1133.22" dur="4.02">the reasons why we hear everybody talk</text>
  <text start="1135.77" dur="3.36">about Hillary&amp;#39;s blackberries and</text>
  <text start="1137.24" dur="3.99">smashing them with a hammer and it talks</text>
  <text start="1139.13" dur="4.17">about here in the article why you know</text>
  <text start="1141.23" dur="4.26">or ask the question I guess why Hillary</text>
  <text start="1143.3" dur="3.45">was going on eBay and buying use</text>
  <text start="1145.49" dur="2.49">blackberries so they couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1146.75" dur="3.18">connected to the government and</text>
  <text start="1147.98" dur="5.01">everything that we talked about with</text>

  <text start="1152.99" dur="4.41">the server and and the illegal</text>

  <text start="1157.4" dur="8.64">treasonous communications if true that</text>
  <text start="1161.38" dur="7.48">that is why they felt they had to just</text>
  <text start="1166.04" dur="5.31">go all out and because at that point</text>
  <text start="1168.86" dur="4.95">they really have nothing to lose this is</text>
  <text start="1171.35" dur="5.94">why some there are some important parts</text>
  <text start="1173.81" dur="4.77">to take away from this story first of</text>
  <text start="1177.29" dur="3.21">all talking about how Brennan&amp;#39;s</text>
