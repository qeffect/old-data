  <text start="28.89" dur="8.97">very important story to cover now it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="11.061">thought that&amp;#39;s been developed through a</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="9.33">lot of conversation research and heavy</text>
  <text start="44.03" dur="5.74">in-depth analysis and I can tell you</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="4.38">right now that given all the</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="6.24">circumstances this seems like the</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="6.329">logical outcome my thought and along</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="4.59">with other people that I know very well</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="4.261">and also a lot of you in the comments</text>

  <text start="70.92" dur="4.14">country and then but to have the</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="3.51">dialogue in the conversation I think</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="3.599">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re all altom utley always</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="5.01">looking for and I think it&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="78.659" dur="6">important thing to having a rational</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="6.69">logical well-rounded and balanced</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="7.71">conversation about the legitimacy or the</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="6.27">D legitimacy of the Intel that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="4.651">out in these q posts and we have to vet</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="4.71">it and we have to research it and we</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="6">have to come together to consider all</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="6.739">the possibilities now let&amp;#39;s just go</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="6.389">ahead and look over here this is a</text>
  <text start="106.189" dur="9.121">former Q post that we&amp;#39;ve already gone</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="5.901">over but I want to just implicate some</text>
  <text start="115.64" dur="6.519">implicit ideals that may be behind this</text>
  <text start="119.509" dur="4.75">so if you look at this it says narrative</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="5.371">shift nation alert firing rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="5.881">blocking Muir firing rod mode Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="4.92">is set up firing Muir firing rod</text>

  <text start="132.45" dur="3.27">Senate confirmation vote</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="6.63">Arad Rosenstein as I said before it was</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="6.24">around 94 to 6 and why did rod</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="3.18">Rosenstein Bey grind and block the FISA</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="6.15">medal from congressional review for</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="6.15">their advancement real time the 7th</text>

  <text start="164.52" dur="7.29">Capitol it says top secret clearance is</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="5.99">mandatory for admission and how is that</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="6.33">possible we see you Hugh now obviously</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="4.27">there&amp;#39;s a lot of implications that can</text>
  <text start="178.14" dur="3.51">be drawn from this but I think one of</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="5.01">the things that stood out to me as a</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="5.34">thought is looking at what is happening</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="5.73">today there&amp;#39;s a lot of resignations and</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="4.53">cue in his former post if we just scroll</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="4.56">up a little bit</text>
  <text start="191.52" dur="6.21">talked about how we really need to pay</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="5.13">attention and look at what&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="4.47">happening now if you want to read</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="4.71">something very fascinating I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="5.16">gonna pull up this former cue post it</text>
  <text start="205.02" dur="4.08">says read slowly and carefully well</text>
  <text start="207.36" dur="3.87">become critically important in coming</text>
  <text start="209.1" dur="4.62">weeks continue to track those who are</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="3.93">resigning across all platforms where</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.07">there was once darkness that will now be</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="5.79">light that&amp;#39;s a fascinating thought</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="7.7">especially when you combine it with the</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="9.87">fact that there is an immense amount of</text>
  <text start="226.49" dur="7.78">people who are speculating at this point</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="6.05">that trey Gowdy will not be seeking</text>
  <text start="234.27" dur="5.34">re-election that trey Gowdy will be</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="5.89">trying to move back toward justice</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="6.81">department and what trey gowdy is</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="6.57">actually trying to change his path as</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="4.5">far as a career goes and get more</text>
  <text start="249.33" dur="4.04">involved back with the Justice</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="5.22">Department as he was a former prosecutor</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="6.1">now it brings us all the way back to</text>
  <text start="256.14" dur="4.68">this where the firing of rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="3.449">seemed seems imminent</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="4.23">according to cue if you follow the post</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="4.321">close enough and with that thought in</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="4.35">mind I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="4.95">how it would not be received well to</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="7.56">think that having trey gowdy replace</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="8.28">Andrew McCabe as the deputy excuse me</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="5.91">rod Rosenstein as the deputy to Deputy</text>
  <text start="280.47" dur="6.599">Attorney General will be an amazing</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="5.609">thing because the fact is for whatever</text>
  <text start="287.069" dur="4.051">reason or the other</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="5.25">Jeff Sessions has decided to recuse</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="4.29">himself from the Russia investigation</text>
  <text start="293.729" dur="4.5">quote-unquote now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="6.45">amazingly it&amp;#39;s amazing how broad the</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="8.461">Russia investigation is and how many</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="10.589">things that withdraws the ability for</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="8.31">Jeff Sessions to overview so my thought</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="5.94">is basically this we have to one of two</text>
  <text start="315" dur="6.18">options we&amp;#39;re gonna have to go out and</text>
  <text start="318.389" dur="5.43">find somebody to be this gatekeeper and</text>
  <text start="321.18" dur="7.19">by gatekeeper I mean that it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="323.819" dur="8.611">pointed out that rod Rosenstein is the</text>
  <text start="328.37" dur="15.43">only person who can challenge the</text>
  <text start="332.43" dur="14.91">president&amp;#39;s mandate to fire Robert</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="5.429">Mueller and I do believe that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="4.379">something to be considered if you look</text>
  <text start="349.229" dur="6.021">at the facts that the Mueller</text>
  <text start="351.719" dur="3.531">investigation has been obviously</text>
  <text start="356.36" dur="5.38">corrupted it&amp;#39;s been tainted it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="358.56" dur="5.099">infiltrated it&amp;#39;s been subverted however</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="3.78">you want to put it and I think that</text>
  <text start="363.659" dur="2.971">that&amp;#39;s very well documented if you</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="4.53">actually take the time to do the</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5.58">research so taking that into account and</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="5.459">then combining that with the fact that</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="5.67">rod Rosenstein can actually step in to</text>
  <text start="375.509" dur="6">block the firing of Mueller if Trump so</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="6.089">decides to I think it&amp;#39;s very fair to</text>
  <text start="381.509" dur="3.78">come to the conclusion that the</text>
  <text start="383.969" dur="2.971">president is gonna look at other options</text>
  <text start="385.289" dur="5.25">now what are those other options</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="5.46">obviously option two is firing rod</text>
  <text start="390.539" dur="5.19">Rosenstein and replacing him with</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="5.67">somebody who will execute the duty of</text>
  <text start="395.729" dur="4.74">the offices faithfully and without</text>
  <text start="398.07" dur="3.32">biased as we have seen rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="400.469" dur="4.821">and all</text>
  <text start="401.39" dur="7.86">his cronies are explicitly guilty of</text>
  <text start="405.29" dur="6.18">doing so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and just examine</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="4.86">that for a second I would love to hear</text>
  <text start="411.47" dur="5.19">what you guys have to think or what you</text>
  <text start="414.11" dur="5.25">guys have to say I should say about this</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="6.53">in the comments section please please</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="7.71">contribute it&amp;#39;s a big deal for me and</text>
  <text start="423.19" dur="6.16">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of Trump hysteria</text>
  <text start="427.07" dur="5.46">out there and I just want to cut to a</text>
  <text start="429.35" dur="7.8">quick Infowars article talking about</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="6.57">these awful people in San Diego who have</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="5.46">literally have Trump derangement</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="7.47">syndrome and this is their idea of</text>
  <text start="442.61" dur="6.48">freedom of speech and it&amp;#39;s fine they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="446.57" dur="7.23">all entitled to it but it&amp;#39;s childish I</text>
  <text start="449.09" dur="6.03">think that it&amp;#39;s a useless it&amp;#39;s futile it</text>
  <text start="453.8" dur="3.96">doesn&amp;#39;t solve any issues it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="6.66">create a dialogue it doesn&amp;#39;t forward a</text>
  <text start="457.76" dur="6.09">new narrative or a new thought all it</text>
  <text start="461.78" dur="4.32">does is promote hate it promotes</text>
  <text start="463.85" dur="8.4">violence and they&amp;#39;ll eventually run out</text>
  <text start="466.1" dur="8.37">of shoes and that that is just awful in</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="5.76">and of itself because that&amp;#39;s when as we</text>
  <text start="474.47" dur="6.93">know they usually start picking up other</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="5.76">arms and using other tactics and today I</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="6.36">just want to cover real quickly the</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="6.39">Train story so train carrying Republican</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="6.3">lawmakers hits a truck in Virginia and</text>
  <text start="490.16" dur="7.2">there is one person dead now that in and</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="5.22">of itself is is pretty awful and we pray</text>
  <text start="497.36" dur="5.06">for all of those involved we pray for</text>
  <text start="499.28" dur="6.3">the family of those who have passed but</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="5.08">let&amp;#39;s be honest this needs a further</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="5.75">investigation right after the State of</text>
  <text start="507.5" dur="6.27">the Union you have a dump truck</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="7.53">literally pulling itself in front of a</text>
  <text start="513.77" dur="8.61">train that&amp;#39;s carrying all the GOP top</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="7.24">congressional members to a retreat and</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re traveling through Virginia at</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="7.1">the time I believe and on their way to</text>
  <text start="527.78" dur="8.57">West Virginia this is this is scary</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="5.09">I don&amp;#39;t know the full details of this</text>
  <text start="536.35" dur="6.9">and as they come out we&amp;#39;ll cover that</text>
  <text start="538.29" dur="8.25">but I think as a collective it it is</text>
  <text start="543.25" dur="6.89">very much worthwhile to ask the question</text>
  <text start="546.54" dur="7.47">are there people involved in this who</text>
  <text start="550.14" dur="7.78">were purposefully seeking to harm</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="7.3">members of our congressional body and</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="7.89">maybe even send a message to those in</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="7.11">the Congress that they are they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="5.46">untouchable and I think that&amp;#39;s scary in</text>
  <text start="568.42" dur="4.65">and of itself so we need to focus on</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="5.16">this we need to fight it we need to</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="6.42">fight it by exposing it and we need to</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="8.22">stay on the straight and narrow when it</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="8.1">comes to following these crazy events</text>
  <text start="584.65" dur="5.31">that I mean as Alex Jones has stated</text>
  <text start="587.59" dur="5.73">recently can only be best described as</text>
  <text start="589.96" dur="6.57">living in the twilight zone where you</text>
  <text start="593.32" dur="5.4">have sitting congressional members who</text>
  <text start="596.53" dur="7.61">are offended by things like police and</text>
  <text start="598.72" dur="10.74">military and you the United States and</text>
  <text start="604.14" dur="7.9">patriotism and Church and God it is</text>
  <text start="609.46" dur="4.2">really something to be seen so I just</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="3.9">want to say thank you so much for</text>
  <text start="613.66" dur="5.88">watching we&amp;#39;ll have to do more research</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="7.29">into this this is a very scary and and</text>
  <text start="619.54" dur="6.6">deeply troubling story we need to watch</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="3.45">it further and see how this all turns</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="3.69">out</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="5.97">obviously we pray for the families of</text>
  <text start="629.83" dur="5.58">those involved and we pray for safe and</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="4.98">healthy recoveries but let&amp;#39;s just go</text>
  <text start="635.41" dur="6.18">ahead and say that there is a lot more</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="7.14">to this story than maybe at first meet</text>
  <text start="641.59" dur="5.37">the eye so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and just do</text>
  <text start="644.77" dur="5.58">our due diligence do our research we</text>
  <text start="646.96" dur="5.4">will eventually uncover this scandal if</text>
  <text start="650.35" dur="4.23">there is one there and if not then we</text>
  <text start="652.36" dur="4.29">will uncover that as well I just want to</text>
  <text start="654.58" dur="4.65">say thank you for watching my name is</text>
  <text start="656.65" dur="4.47">Craig this is just inform talk and I</text>
