  <text start="76.71" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re gonna get right into the latest Q</text>
  <text start="78.689" dur="5.881">posts so first we have Diane Feinstein</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="5.1">this is a previous post from September</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="5.46">27th that Q is reminding yourself here</text>
  <text start="87.21" dur="4.799">and it&amp;#39;s just a picture of a car</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.799">traveling a Mercedes traveling down a</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="4.921">highway that&amp;#39;s basically got these</text>
  <text start="94.829" dur="6.08">Chinese flags here so we know it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="6.18">China and it says Feinstein Q so Q is</text>
  <text start="100.909" dur="3.581">suggesting that Diane Feinstein is</text>
  <text start="103.11" dur="3.93">inside this car which would make a lot</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="4.29">of sense given her close relation her</text>
  <text start="107.04" dur="3.899">and her husband&amp;#39;s close relations with</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="4.53">China her husband&amp;#39;s a very successful</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.741">businessman who has had many many deals</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="4.89">in China made millions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="115.68" dur="5.579">that market and in Asian markets</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="6.54">surrounding that country where China has</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="6.81">a huge influence and what Q wants us to</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="6.239">look at is this number 297 right which</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="4.401">is the Q post here where was this</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="4.521">picture taken</text>
  <text start="132.47" dur="4.5">hanging of flags traditional occurs in</text>
  <text start="135.5" dur="3.66">this part of the country for what</text>
  <text start="136.97" dur="4.74">holiday and then it gives us bloomberg</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="4.53">article which basically this Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="141.71" dur="4.23">article talks about the new evidence of</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="4.59">hacked super micro hardware found in</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="5.55">u.s. telecom now basically this whole</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="5.25">story is that there is a microchip and</text>
  <text start="151.49" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re talking when we say microchip we</text>
  <text start="153.53" dur="4.68">mean Micro it&amp;#39;s about the size of the</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="4.95">tip of a pencil if you can imagine that</text>
  <text start="158.21" dur="5.28">in your in your mind and it was put on</text>
  <text start="161" dur="5.94">too many motherboards that were used in</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="6.9">all different facets of our government</text>
  <text start="166.94" dur="5.04">so in our private sector and what they</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="5.4">basically did is they forwarded</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="7.14">information from computers to secret</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="4.86">anonymously placed computer servers that</text>
  <text start="179.12" dur="5.22">would then forward that information back</text>
  <text start="180.65" dur="6.39">to China so it was a hardware hack now</text>
  <text start="184.34" dur="5.63">most people associate hacks with</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="6.12">software because software is the most</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="5.2">vulnerable to a hack attack if you will</text>
  <text start="193.16" dur="4.1">and that means that if you download a</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="4.71">program then it may have some malicious</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="4.78">malware in it that can target your</text>
  <text start="199.88" dur="4.59">computer or you know if you go to the</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="4.59">wrong website that&amp;#39;s not secured you can</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="4.019">pick up a virus through the cookies or</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="3.09">if you know any there&amp;#39;s a myriad of</text>
  <text start="208.489" dur="4.651">different ways to pick up a software</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="5.25">virus but a hardware virus is something</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="6.36">completely different hardware virus is</text>
  <text start="214.97" dur="6.15">when there&amp;#39;s a hardware that is built</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="4.5">into a system that makes your computer</text>
  <text start="221.12" dur="5.28">and your components vulnerable to a hack</text>
  <text start="224" dur="4.89">anytime they are activated or turned on</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="5.48">and that&amp;#39;s what China has apparently</text>
  <text start="228.89" dur="6.36">pulled off against our country now</text>
  <text start="231.88" dur="6.46">there&amp;#39;s been various reporting on this</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="4.62">about how it happened and what actually</text>
  <text start="238.34" dur="4.19">happened but to give you guys a better</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="6.21">idea I&amp;#39;m gonna play a clip out of a guy</text>
  <text start="242.53" dur="5.26">who I really respect admire his name&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.08" dur="3.54">Chris Chappell he runs a channel called</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="4.38">China uncensored and I&amp;#39;m gonna leave a</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="4.86">link to the video and obviously a link</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="3.33">to the channel in the description at the</text>
  <text start="254.48" dur="3.27">end of this video and I want you to</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="5.82">watch his explanation of what this</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="4.979">microchip scam was and when you guys are</text>
  <text start="261.32" dur="3.12">done with that I really want you guys to</text>
  <text start="262.729" dur="3.961">go over to his channel</text>

  <text start="278.17" dur="5.14">sphere of reporting that go into the</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="4.83">truth of what&amp;#39;s going on in China so</text>

  <text start="286.01" dur="4.71">have happened there&amp;#39;s a company called</text>
  <text start="287.86" dur="6.94">elemental they make cubes that shoot</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="6.54">other cubes with lasers I guess actually</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="4.62">they specialize in video processing and</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="4.56">storage their technology has been used</text>
  <text start="299.42" dur="4.5">for everything from helping stream the</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="4.62">Olympic Games to communication with the</text>
  <text start="303.92" dur="5.24">international space station to even</text>
  <text start="306.44" dur="3.87">handling drone footage for the CIA in</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="3.97">2015</text>
  <text start="310.31" dur="5.88">elemental was bought by Amazon Wow</text>
  <text start="313.13" dur="5.07">Amazon really does everything elemental</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="4.35">is an American company and their main</text>
  <text start="318.2" dur="5.58">product is assembled by another American</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="5.13">company Super Micro Computer Inc they</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="4.38">sell more server motherboards than</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="5.01">almost anyone else one US intelligence</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="5.07">official told Bloomberg think of Super</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="7.05">Micro as the Microsoft of the hardware</text>
  <text start="333.23" dur="6.75">world so like micro hard no forget that</text>
  <text start="337.73" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s a terrible name anyways it turns</text>
  <text start="339.98" dur="4.32">out Super micros core product their</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="5.07">motherboards are mostly made by</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="6">contractors in China so it seems to have</text>
  <text start="347.54" dur="4.77">happened is this agents for the People&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="4.32">Liberation Army strolled into these</text>
  <text start="352.31" dur="4.41">contractors factories and offered some</text>
  <text start="354.62" dur="4.44">bribes to change the motherboard design</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="4.89">ever so slightly just add this one</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="5.25">teensy weensy little extra microchip</text>
  <text start="361.61" dur="4.26">okay of course if that didn&amp;#39;t work they</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="3.33">threatened factory managers with</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="4.29">inspections that could shut down their</text>
  <text start="367.64" dur="4.74">plans and while one tiny microchip</text>
  <text start="370.16" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t sound like it can do a lot it</text>
  <text start="372.38" dur="4.44">doesn&amp;#39;t have to according to Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="3.12">they were capable of doing two very</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="3.03">important things</text>
  <text start="377.81" dur="3.84">telling the device to communicate with</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="3.36">one of several anonymous computers</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="3.69">elsewhere on the internet they were</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.8">loaded with more complex code and</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="5.52">preparing the devices operating system</text>
  <text start="388.01" dur="4.5">to accept this new code and this would</text>
  <text start="390.86" dur="4.559">give the Chinese military complete</text>
  <text start="392.51" dur="5.31">access in a very hard to detect way for</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="5.491">example they could make a secure machine</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="5.94">not ask for a password that way hackers</text>
  <text start="400.91" dur="4.26">from China could just waltz right in now</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="3.6">for a long time many Americans believe</text>
  <text start="405.17" dur="2.79">that China would never do something like</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="2.19">this</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="3.81">because it would jeopardize China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="5.16">place as the workshop of the world and</text>
  <text start="411.77" dur="4.97">so everyone was happy being naive taking</text>
  <text start="414.71" dur="4.56">advantage of China&amp;#39;s low low prices</text>
  <text start="416.74" dur="4.81">meanwhile trying to continue to play a</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="4.92">major role building global computer</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="4.31">infrastructure and so companies became</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="5.49">dependent on China</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="6.37">oopsey the fact that China has been a</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="5.85">major state sponsor of cyber espionage</text>
  <text start="432.23" dur="5.28">is nothing new back in 2015 there was</text>
  <text start="435.53" dur="4.02">even an agreement between Xi Jinping and</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="5.01">President Obama that China would stop</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="5.16">stealing US intellectual property that</text>
  <text start="442.52" dur="4.59">was the same year the Chinese microchips</text>
  <text start="444.71" dur="4.44">were first discovered one official told</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="3.93">Bloomberg that the White House may have</text>
  <text start="449.15" dur="3.75">suspected at the time that China was</text>
  <text start="451.04" dur="3.72">willing to offer this concession because</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="4.02">it was already developing far more</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="4.8">advanced and surreptitious forms of</text>
  <text start="456.92" dur="5.28">hacking founded on its near monopoly of</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="4.26">the technology supply chain not that the</text>
  <text start="462.2" dur="3.75">US government could do much about it</text>
  <text start="463.82" dur="4.32">because it was the big American</text>
  <text start="465.95" dur="4.47">companies there were actually to blame</text>
  <text start="468.14" dur="4.77">for exposing themselves to the China</text>
  <text start="470.42" dur="4.62">supply chain and they refused to listen</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="3.84">to the government&amp;#39;s warnings so it</text>
  <text start="475.04" dur="4.17">shouldn&amp;#39;t surprise you that both Apple</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="5.94">and Amazon have denied the Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="479.21" dur="5.73">report except the company&amp;#39;s denials are</text>
  <text start="482.69" dur="4.74">countered by six current and former</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="4.68">senior national security officials in</text>
  <text start="487.43" dur="3.78">fact not only did the companies know</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="4.05">about it according to those officials</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="4.53">but Apple had reported their discovery</text>
  <text start="493.67" dur="3">of it to the FBI in the first place and</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="3.36">Amazon</text>
  <text start="496.67" dur="5.13">went even further by cooperating in a</text>
  <text start="499.1" dur="4.68">government investigation about it but of</text>
  <text start="501.8" dur="4.5">course neither company said this to the</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="5.22">public if it happened at all because as</text>
  <text start="506.3" dur="3.72">I said they totally deny it so I hope</text>
  <text start="509" dur="3.69">that clears that up</text>
  <text start="510.02" dur="4.709">to a degree and then it gives a quote</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="4.56">out of this article that cute gave us</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="4.801">from this Bloomberg piece it says quote</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="5">Western intelligence contacts that the</text>
  <text start="519.53" dur="6.03">device was made at a super micro</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="6.76">subcontractor Factory in gang jao are</text>

  <text start="534.28" dur="5.77">dubbed the Silicon Valley of hardware</text>
  <text start="537.02" dur="5.13">what state does Feinstein represent and</text>
  <text start="540.05" dur="8.34">then it gives us Washington Post article</text>
  <text start="542.15" dur="8.49">which talks about the fact that senator</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="4.62">Feinstein had a Chinese spy working for</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="6.45">her for a very long time I think almost</text>
  <text start="553.01" dur="5.76">two decades if I&amp;#39;m correct and this is a</text>
  <text start="557.09" dur="3.39">story now first of all you guys probably</text>
  <text start="558.77" dur="4.47">wondering why aren&amp;#39;t I seeing an article</text>
  <text start="560.48" dur="5.46">well it&amp;#39;s because I understand I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="4.71">big fan of boycotting or any of that but</text>
  <text start="565.94" dur="4.5">I understand that I vote with my dollars</text>
  <text start="567.95" dur="4.14">and I refuse to give one red cent to the</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="4.94">Washington Post because I refuse to pay</text>
  <text start="572.09" dur="6.12">for fake news and I refuse to support</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="4.69">people like Jeff Bezos especially when</text>
  <text start="578.21" dur="3.24">it comes to buying off Amazon reading</text>
  <text start="580.07" dur="4.11">The Washington Post all that stuff I</text>
  <text start="581.45" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t do it so that&amp;#39;s my choice that</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;ve made but basically this article</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="4.77">just outlines the fact that senator</text>
  <text start="587.84" dur="4.89">Feinstein had a Chinese spy basically</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="4.34">working for her for a very long time but</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="4.38">it also goes into much more than that</text>

  <text start="1273.3" dur="5.4">Google is just one another part of the</text>
  <text start="1276.45" dur="4.68">bigger problem here as he&amp;#39;s telling all</text>
  <text start="1278.7" dur="4.62">of his employees how great their work is</text>
  <text start="1281.13" dur="4.799">for the Chinese Communist government so</text>
  <text start="1283.32" dur="5.34">they can continue to restrict human</text>
  <text start="1285.929" dur="4.861">rights and to target political</text>
  <text start="1288.66" dur="4.71">dissidents for censorship and even worse</text>
  <text start="1290.79" dur="4.47">in some cases so remember this face</text>
  <text start="1293.37" dur="3.78">right here this is the face of Google</text>
  <text start="1295.26" dur="4.32">and you know how they said don&amp;#39;t be evil</text>
  <text start="1297.15" dur="3.96">was their original motto well I think</text>
  <text start="1299.58" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s kind of changed now and you guys</text>
  <text start="1301.11" dur="3.09">can guess what their new motto is or</text>
  <text start="1303.45" dur="4.92">should be</text>
  <text start="1304.2" dur="8.79">so then Q says with a kookiness like I</text>
  <text start="1308.37" dur="6.66">said this YouTube video of Mike Pence</text>
  <text start="1312.99" dur="3.75">and then it says worth 43 minutes of</text>
  <text start="1315.03" dur="3.93">your time all inside roads to China are</text>
  <text start="1316.74" dur="5.61">being closed America is no longer for</text>
  <text start="1318.96" dur="4.92">sale q so to break this down quickly</text>
  <text start="1322.35" dur="3.569">since we&amp;#39;ve taken a lot of time going</text>
  <text start="1323.88" dur="4.17">through it I want to just share the</text>
  <text start="1325.919" dur="3.101">basic gist of it so the picture was</text>
  <text start="1328.05" dur="4.6">taken in</text>
  <text start="1329.02" dur="5.7">quang or guangzhou which is a province</text>
  <text start="1332.65" dur="6.57">which has contains other provinces</text>
  <text start="1334.72" dur="6.99">including Shenzhen and up excuse me I</text>
  <text start="1339.22" dur="4.589">think it was Guan Guangdong is the</text>
  <text start="1341.71" dur="4.469">province and that has Guangzhou and it</text>
  <text start="1343.809" dur="4.5">has Shanshan and these these Chinese</text>
  <text start="1346.179" dur="3.841">provinces are basically like the Chinese</text>
  <text start="1348.309" dur="3.75">Silicon Valley it&amp;#39;s where all hardware</text>
  <text start="1350.02" dur="4.74">is basically manufactured their own</text>
  <text start="1352.059" dur="5.131">they&amp;#39;ve basically gone full-out against</text>
  <text start="1354.76" dur="4.919">that it says what Flags traditionally</text>
  <text start="1357.19" dur="4.44">are hanging as a part of the country for</text>
  <text start="1359.679" dur="4.141">what holiday well it&amp;#39;s obviously I</text>
  <text start="1361.63" dur="3.63">believe it is the National Day of the</text>
  <text start="1363.82" dur="3.81">People&amp;#39;s Republic of China of course</text>

  <text start="1373.09" dur="2.52">October</text>
  <text start="1373.809" dur="4.411">maybe there&amp;#39;s another double meaning</text>
  <text start="1375.61" dur="4.62">there that Diane Feinstein was spending</text>
  <text start="1378.22" dur="4.49">a holiday over there in the People&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1401.74" dur="5.43">ruthless in taking out the dissidents</text>
  <text start="1404.62" dur="5.28">and those who disagreed with the party</text>
  <text start="1407.17" dur="4.74">so and that&amp;#39;s what you know don&amp;#39;t forget</text>
  <text start="1409.9" dur="4.2">guys that&amp;#39;s what this guy wants to bring</text>

  <text start="1424.929" dur="5.791">talks about how in the the bloomberg</text>
  <text start="1427.51" dur="6.57">article that the devices were made in</text>
  <text start="1430.72" dur="6.45">gang in Guangzhou and basically in</text>
  <text start="1434.08" dur="5.4">Shenzhen which is Silicon Valley and of</text>
  <text start="1437.17" dur="4.2">course the Silicon Valley that Feinstein</text>
  <text start="1439.48" dur="3.75">represents over in California obviously</text>
  <text start="1441.37" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re all working in cahoots and</text>
  <text start="1443.23" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re so they&amp;#39;re going so</text>
  <text start="1446.26" dur="3.81">hard against us right now and we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="1448.66" dur="4.05">about that in a minute but Google in</text>
  <text start="1450.07" dur="3.96">China and you have the direct</text>
  <text start="1452.71" dur="5.099">connections between Feinstein and</text>
  <text start="1454.03" dur="5.49">Feinstein in China and yeah so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1457.809" dur="4.201">gonna leave that one for for what it is</text>
  <text start="1459.52" dur="3.09">for now but then it says here in the</text>
  <text start="1462.01" dur="3.24">next one</text>
  <text start="1462.61" dur="4.29">this MarketWatch article which talks</text>
  <text start="1465.25" dur="4.23">about how president Trump&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1466.9" dur="5.85">increasing the ethanol basically</text>
  <text start="1469.48" dur="5.28">concentration in gasoline and Q says</text>
  <text start="1472.75" dur="3.63">increased ethanol corn concentration in</text>
  <text start="1474.76" dur="3.27">gasoline effort to combat Chinese</text>
  <text start="1476.38" dur="3.87">attempts to harm our farmers</text>
  <text start="1478.03" dur="4.29">announcement tonight q now that</text>
  <text start="1480.25" dur="5.82">announcement was made tonight at the</text>
  <text start="1482.32" dur="6.21">rally that Q held and our cute excuse me</text>
  <text start="1486.07" dur="4.109">president Trump held and what they</text>
  <text start="1488.53" dur="4.08">talked about was pretty simple they just</text>
  <text start="1490.179" dur="6.441">talked about the fact that ethanol will</text>
  <text start="1492.61" dur="6.059">be they&amp;#39;ll put more ethanol into the</text>
  <text start="1496.62" dur="3.88">gasoline now there&amp;#39;s a lot of ups and</text>
  <text start="1498.669" dur="4.861">downs to it you know some people have</text>
  <text start="1500.5" dur="5.4">older cars definitely is negative</text>
  <text start="1503.53" dur="4.98">because they&amp;#39;re made to handle ethanol</text>
  <text start="1505.9" dur="4.74">in their systems newer cars shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1508.51" dur="3.659">have a problem big problem is they</text>
  <text start="1510.64" dur="3.72">usually restrict the amount of ethanol</text>
  <text start="1512.169" dur="3.571">that is per that is allowed to be put</text>
  <text start="1514.36" dur="4.05">into gasoline in the summer months</text>
  <text start="1515.74" dur="5.04">because it actually creates a larger</text>
  <text start="1518.41" dur="4.05">amount of smog but another bright side</text>
  <text start="1520.78" dur="3.96">to it is that it will actually make gas</text>
  <text start="1522.46" dur="5.219">cheaper because ethanol is much cheaper</text>
  <text start="1524.74" dur="5.01">and if you add five percent more ethanol</text>
  <text start="1527.679" dur="4.441">into the gasoline than the gasoline will</text>
  <text start="1529.75" dur="4.11">become cheaper so it&amp;#39;s definitely a part</text>
  <text start="1532.12" dur="3.299">of a sacrifice that we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="1533.86" dur="3.15">make and that&amp;#39;s what I think that we</text>
  <text start="1535.419" dur="4.351">don&amp;#39;t do anymore in this country we</text>
  <text start="1537.01" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t make sacrifices for for our</text>
  <text start="1539.77" dur="5.67">country for our patriotic duty because</text>
  <text start="1542.65" dur="4.409">we all are so entitled but remember that</text>
  <text start="1545.44" dur="3.84">people made have made a lot of</text>
  <text start="1547.059" dur="3.631">sacrifices for our country and if we</text>
  <text start="1549.28" dur="4.83">have to have a little bit more ethanol</text>
  <text start="1550.69" dur="5.16">in our fuel and for the meantime to get</text>
  <text start="1554.11" dur="3.54">through this trade war with China I</text>
  <text start="1555.85" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t see that as a negative thing but</text>
  <text start="1557.65" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m sure you guys will leave your</text>
  <text start="1558.94" dur="3.21">comments if you guys disagree or have</text>
  <text start="1560.65" dur="5.13">anything else you would like to add and</text>
  <text start="1562.15" dur="6">yes q predicted Trump did announce it so</text>
  <text start="1565.78" dur="4.05">there you go</text>
  <text start="1568.15" dur="3.54">the next one is actually talking about</text>
  <text start="1569.83" dur="3.27">license plates and an on post this</text>
  <text start="1571.69" dur="3.989">picture of all the different license</text>
  <text start="1573.1" dur="5.97">plates in the different regions of China</text>
  <text start="1575.679" dur="5.49">and of course you have this the license</text>
  <text start="1579.07" dur="4.5">plate on this Mercedes that is</text>
  <text start="1581.169" dur="5.64">reportedly here supposedly has Dianne</text>
  <text start="1583.57" dur="5.489">Feinstein in it in China and the Anton</text>
  <text start="1586.809" dur="4.62">says it&amp;#39;s a long dong</text>
  <text start="1589.059" dur="5.121">so Guangdong is this one right here and</text>
  <text start="1591.429" dur="6.621">it basically matches up with that plate</text>
  <text start="1594.18" dur="7.74">it says the queue says basically</text>
  <text start="1598.05" dur="5.58">Guangdong Wong Jiao and Shenzhen Dior</text>
  <text start="1601.92" dur="3.15">they all equal one another and it says</text>
  <text start="1603.63" dur="2.94">do you believe in coincidences well if</text>
  <text start="1605.07" dur="3.54">you don&amp;#39;t believe that well then you</text>
  <text start="1606.57" dur="4.38">have to understand how this the map of</text>
  <text start="1608.61" dur="5.61">China works see Shenzhen is really the</text>
  <text start="1610.95" dur="7.05">the the Silicon Valley of China it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1614.22" dur="8.25">where it&amp;#39;s like the major major hardware</text>
  <text start="1618" dur="6.6">manufacturing city but Guang Zhao is</text>
  <text start="1622.47" dur="5.01">actually right there next to it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1624.6" dur="8.07">another very huge techie city it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1627.48" dur="7.62">very tech forward and they&amp;#39;re probably a</text>
  <text start="1632.67" dur="5.58">part of that Silicon Valley but then the</text>
  <text start="1635.1" dur="6.12">larger province that they all reside in</text>
  <text start="1638.25" dur="5.46">is here Guangdong so what Q is saying is</text>
  <text start="1641.22" dur="4.92">when Anton says its Guangdong it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1643.71" dur="5.03">actually Guangzhou and Shenzhen as a</text>
  <text start="1646.14" dur="5.97">part of there they&amp;#39;re like kind of</text>
  <text start="1648.74" dur="5.77">provinces within a region if you will so</text>
  <text start="1652.11" dur="5.22">this is so the license plate would be</text>
  <text start="1654.51" dur="6.66">for Guangdong but I would apply for</text>
  <text start="1657.33" dur="6">Guangzhou and Shenzhen so that is what Q</text>
  <text start="1661.17" dur="4.02">is trying to say Q saying that they all</text>
  <text start="1663.33" dur="4.23">equal one another do you believe in</text>
  <text start="1665.19" dur="4.89">coincidences q so what the whole</text>
  <text start="1667.56" dur="4.65">insinuation is that Dianne Feinstein was</text>
  <text start="1670.08" dur="3.54">in Guangdong which is Guangzhou which is</text>
  <text start="1672.21" dur="3.63">Shenzhen probably traveling between</text>
  <text start="1673.62" dur="5.76">regions setting up deals with the</text>
  <text start="1675.84" dur="5.37">Chinese allegedly and not to the benefit</text>
  <text start="1679.38" dur="5.87">of the American people so there you go</text>
  <text start="1681.21" dur="6.15">and now finally the next one here is</text>
  <text start="1685.25" dur="4.72">interesting it seems to be a statement</text>
  <text start="1687.36" dur="3.87">from the president prop possibly or that</text>
  <text start="1689.97" dur="3.56">was approved by the president for</text>
  <text start="1691.23" dur="6.09">release but it says a statement released</text>
  <text start="1693.53" dur="6.22">October 9th 2018 it says P authority 1</text>
  <text start="1697.32" dur="6.72">now I read that as like presidential</text>
  <text start="1699.75" dur="6.51">authority 1 like Air Force one you know</text>
  <text start="1704.04" dur="4.32">like I don&amp;#39;t know but this seems like</text>
  <text start="1706.26" dur="4.8">what it would be and if that is the case</text>
  <text start="1708.36" dur="6.15">then what this is is a general statement</text>
  <text start="1711.06" dur="5.3">from Q but from the president that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1714.51" dur="5.25">explaining why things are taking time</text>
  <text start="1716.36" dur="4.9">while also giving us insight into what</text>
  <text start="1719.76" dur="3.33">is actually going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1721.26" dur="3.63">so this is very important I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1723.09" dur="3.54">read through it and then we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1724.89" dur="5.13">cover it really quick</text>
  <text start="1726.63" dur="4.95">so it says we understand that there is</text>
  <text start="1730.02" dur="3.2">extreme fatigue and frustration</text>
  <text start="1731.58" dur="4.02">regarding the wheels of justice slow</text>
  <text start="1733.22" dur="4.39">exclude emotion and personal desire</text>

  <text start="2116.85" dur="7.11">based on the rule of law right so what</text>
  <text start="2122.64" dur="3.44">it&amp;#39;s saying is think when you think</text>
  <text start="2123.96" dur="3.36">about federal judge rulings in</text>

  <text start="2156.99" dur="5.34">little cronies in there and there was no</text>
  <text start="2158.94" dur="5.1">majority then one way or the other then</text>
  <text start="2162.33" dur="4.53">you could almost guarantee that the case</text>
  <text start="2164.04" dur="4.53">would get thrown out right and it talked</text>
  <text start="2166.86" dur="4.32">about you know that what we talked about</text>
  <text start="2168.57" dur="4.62">with Lindsey Graham in that little Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="2171.18" dur="5.46">session where he talks about you know</text>
  <text start="2173.19" dur="7.23">9/11 and then they talk about how people</text>
  <text start="2176.64" dur="7.05">who help others commit acts of you know</text>
  <text start="2180.42" dur="5.31">terror against our country are just as</text>
  <text start="2183.69" dur="5.07">culpable as the terrorists that commit</text>
  <text start="2185.73" dur="4.89">that acts and they would be technically</text>
  <text start="2188.76" dur="4.59">considered enemy combatants who could</text>
  <text start="2190.62" dur="6.54">possibly be tried under military law as</text>
  <text start="2193.35" dur="5.13">opposed to normal criminal law so this</text>
  <text start="2197.16" dur="2.58">is something that&amp;#39;s really a big deal</text>
  <text start="2198.48" dur="4.68">and then it goes into all these</text>
  <text start="2199.74" dur="4.86">different ways that Muller was put in or</text>
  <text start="2203.16" dur="6.39">all these different reasons why Muller</text>
  <text start="2204.6" dur="7.02">was put in basically Muller was designed</text>
  <text start="2209.55" dur="4.32">and it says taken evidence needed to</text>
  <text start="2211.62" dur="3.93">expose deep seat so Muller could take</text>
  <text start="2213.87" dur="3.15">that evidence that would expose the deep</text>
  <text start="2215.55" dur="3.21">state and say it&amp;#39;s a part of his ongoing</text>
  <text start="2217.02" dur="3.72">investigation therefore it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2218.76" dur="3.96">released right that&amp;#39;s what it is the</text>
  <text start="2220.74" dur="5.03">ongoing investigation ploy that they use</text>
  <text start="2222.72" dur="5.52">all the time then it was to limit</text>
  <text start="2225.77" dur="4.42">president Trump&amp;#39;s ability to maneuver</text>
  <text start="2228.24" dur="3.45">and designed to stall for time until the</text>
  <text start="2230.19" dur="4.47">midterm elections it&amp;#39;s all pretty simple</text>
  <text start="2231.69" dur="4.5">and it was designed as a safe card so</text>

  <text start="2714.5" dur="5.07">grace and how it is truly greater and</text>
  <text start="2716.51" dur="4.32">for that we want to go to a piece of</text>
  <text start="2719.57" dur="3.33">scripture that I want to share with you</text>
  <text start="2720.83" dur="3.96">guys and I&amp;#39;ll keep this pretty short</text>
  <text start="2722.9" dur="3.81">because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an incredible piece of</text>
  <text start="2724.79" dur="7.44">scripture and it kind of speaks for</text>
  <text start="2726.71" dur="9.77">itself but it talks about you know what</text>
  <text start="2732.23" dur="7.41">is God&amp;#39;s covenant to us and how will God</text>
  <text start="2736.48" dur="5.92">work with us in the future to help us</text>
  <text start="2739.64" dur="4.89">and it just requires our faith in the</text>
  <text start="2742.4" dur="5.7">Lord and understanding these simple</text>
  <text start="2744.53" dur="8.58">words as shared in Isaiah chapter 59</text>
  <text start="2748.1" dur="8.22">verses 20 and 21 but it says this is the</text>
  <text start="2753.11" dur="4.41">Lord&amp;#39;s declaration as for me this is my</text>
  <text start="2756.32" dur="4.11">covenant with them</text>
  <text start="2757.52" dur="4.98">says the Lord my spirit who is on you</text>
  <text start="2760.43" dur="4.38">and my words that I have put in your</text>
  <text start="2762.5" dur="4.68">mouth will not depart from your mouth or</text>
  <text start="2764.81" dur="4.14">from the mouth of your children or from</text>
  <text start="2767.18" dur="6.11">the mouth of your children&amp;#39;s children</text>
  <text start="2768.95" dur="8.04">from now on and forever says the Lord</text>
  <text start="2773.29" dur="5.68">and that&amp;#39;s a beautiful but it&amp;#39;s a simple</text>
  <text start="2776.99" dur="4.11">but but amazing piece of scripture</text>
  <text start="2778.97" dur="5.13">because it&amp;#39;s a promise it&amp;#39;s a covenant</text>
  <text start="2781.1" dur="5.07">coming from God saying if we speak the</text>
  <text start="2784.1" dur="4.53">word of the Lord and we live by the Lord</text>
  <text start="2786.17" dur="4.92">and we put him first and put him on high</text>
  <text start="2788.63" dur="6.36">and make our lives about honoring him</text>
  <text start="2791.09" dur="5.279">through speaking of his glory that that</text>
  <text start="2794.99" dur="3">will continue into the next</text>
  <text start="2796.369" dur="4.111">generation so our children and our</text>
  <text start="2797.99" dur="4.95">children&amp;#39;s children will have that same</text>
  <text start="2800.48" dur="4.98">gift and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so important</text>
  <text start="2802.94" dur="4.74">that we as Christians stand up for our</text>
  <text start="2805.46" dur="5.389">faith we stand up for what we believe in</text>
  <text start="2807.68" dur="6.54">and we stand up for God and we represent</text>
  <text start="2810.849" dur="7.601">the great glory that is God&amp;#39;s grace in</text>
