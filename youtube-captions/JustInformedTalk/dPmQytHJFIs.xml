  <text start="82.59" dur="3.18">what&amp;#39;s been going on in the news we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="3.35">going to be talking about this crazy</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="5.34">story about a woman who was arrested</text>

  <text start="100.14" dur="3.839">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about that story a</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="5.43">little bit later but first before we get</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="7.471">into that I want to jump right into this</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="6.18">breakdown of the operations that led up</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="3.599">to where we are at today so first of all</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="3.51">here was a graphic that was produced by</text>
  <text start="115.049" dur="3.93">one of the anions which actually is a</text>
  <text start="116.79" dur="4.59">flowchart that perfectly illustrates</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="5.161">what happened who was involved in how</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="4.769">this whole thing came to be and came to</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="4.47">pass and I hope this whole thing I mean</text>
  <text start="126.149" dur="5.251">the Russia collusion hoax narrative</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s been given to us by the media and</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="2.49">and this is how it was all manufactured</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="2.01">and put</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="4.53">these are the individuals involved I</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="4.85">will tweet this graphic out after the</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="4.71">video and also share the link to this</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="4.62">actual piece of or this picture so you</text>
  <text start="143.13" dur="5.72">guys can look at it for yourself but</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="6.55">what this explains is how that the HRC</text>
  <text start="148.85" dur="4.06">coordinated with the DNC through W</text>
  <text start="151.56" dur="4.55">Washington Schultz and her campaign</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="5.07">manager Robby Mook in Mook in order to</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="4.06">coordinate with the White House and</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="4.979">other intelligence agencies including</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="4.17">the DOJ and the FBI to put this whole</text>
  <text start="162.959" dur="3.361">thing together these are the players</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.83">that were involved in the White House</text>
  <text start="166.32" dur="6.3">you had Barack Hussein you had Valerie</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="5.52">Jarrett s Denis McDonough Joe Biden Rahm</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="4.38">Emanuel John Kerry Samantha Power&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="4.98">Karen Karen Mills all helping and</text>
  <text start="177" dur="4.86">knowledgeable of this insurance plan</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="3.39">that was happening you have in the CIA</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="3.03">you have John Brennan that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="4.14">classified the NSA was the one who</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="3.69">helped expose that connection also you</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="3.69">have Department National Intelligence</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="6.6">James clapper who&amp;#39;s connected directly</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="6.15">to funneling the information about the</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="4.05">Steele dossier to the DOJ where you have</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="3.84">Loretta Lynch Sally Yates Bruce or David</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="4.02">Lawrence Peter struck David laughs Minh</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="5.22">john carlin Mary McCord and Rachel</text>
  <text start="203.25" dur="6.299">Brandt all being involved and of course</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="5.31">this is how it all moved and then you</text>
  <text start="209.549" dur="3.241">can get into the whole of the tarmac</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="3.84">meeting and how that connects back to</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="4.65">the part of Justice and also you have</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="4.799">the FBI with James Comey McCabe rebecky</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="4.38">michael Steinbach bill pre-snap Peter</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="4.231">struck Lisa Paige Jim Baker Michael</text>
  <text start="221.82" dur="4.71">Courtin josh campbell Sally Mora Tasha</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="6.87">our and Kevin Kline Smith and John</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="6.9">pre-snap all working to push this to</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="4.47">push to get the dossier used in order to</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="3.21">obtain FISA warrants in order to go and</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="3.57">spy on the President of the United</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="3.599">States so this is a great flow chart</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="1.62">that puts it all together where did it</text>
  <text start="240.239" dur="2.641">come from</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="3.989">we Christopher Steele working with</text>
  <text start="242.88" dur="4.71">fusion GPS which was funneled through</text>
  <text start="244.799" dur="6.121">Perkins Coie which was lobbied by the</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="4.709">DNC or retained by the DNC and it was</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="3.51">pushed down to the Washington free</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="4.261">beacon and no name McCain was one of the</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="6.989">integral players in pushing that into</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="6.419">the media which it already existed by</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="4.531">that time in the presidential daily</text>
  <text start="262.979" dur="3.871">briefings and at the FBI and DOJ top</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="3.42">brass be</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="4.38">it was being back channeled in through</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="4.05">people like Nellie or and Bruce or and</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="4.5">their connections to of course the CIA</text>
  <text start="273.42" dur="4.17">in John Brennan so this actually wraps</text>
  <text start="275.73" dur="6.03">it all up in a nice little neat bow and</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="7.38">it and it all starts with this UK you</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="6.54">know five eyes intelligence collection</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="4.98">and all that stuff so are in the UK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="4.86">involvement through steel infusion GPS</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="4.77">so this is an interesting graphic I</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="3.63">really wanted to share that first now</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="4.62">here&amp;#39;s another interesting piece of news</text>
  <text start="296.79" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s been coming out the last few days</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="3.96">talking about how mother&amp;#39;s mala dragged</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="4.08">out the investigation for more than a</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="4.8">year after finishing it so after</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="3.9">finishing his findings basically what</text>
  <text start="308.1" dur="5.37">the story goes into is the fact that</text>
  <text start="309.51" dur="5.76">this report was done a long time ago but</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="4.95">it was kept alive to go after other</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="5.16">people involved targeted individuals you</text>
  <text start="318.42" dur="3.48">look at what happened to Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="3.12">you look at what happened to Roger stone</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="6.03">you look at what happened others</text>
  <text start="323.55" dur="5.88">involved George papadopolis they left it</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="4.23">open so that he&amp;#39;d go after all of these</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="4.5">people and what they did in doing that</text>
  <text start="332.16" dur="3.87">was charged them with crimes such as</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="3.39">like obstruction of justice now Manta</text>
  <text start="336.03" dur="3.36">Ford&amp;#39;s case he was being charged for</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="3.93">crimes he committed a while ago way</text>
  <text start="339.39" dur="3.87">before all this but if you look at the</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="3.57">way that what happened to George</text>
  <text start="343.26" dur="4.92">papadopolis what happened to general</text>
  <text start="344.82" dur="6.27">Flynn all this stuff was was processed</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="4.08">carbs their obstruction but it&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="3.57">thing nobody ever talks about I was like</text>
  <text start="352.26" dur="5.34">oh well it&amp;#39;s instruction or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="6.54">obstruction of a crime that you were</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="4.92">trying to manufacture right that they</text>
  <text start="361.2" dur="4.77">were trying to frame somebody with it</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="5.52">never existed like this rush occlusion</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="5.01">thing right that&amp;#39;s the whole point</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="3.3">and in that being the whole point the</text>
  <text start="370.98" dur="3.3">point</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="5.82">really was to just go after anyone</text>
  <text start="374.28" dur="4.17">involved here around this so I&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="4.77">this analogy before I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="378.45" dur="6.39">pretty pretty spot-on analogy it&amp;#39;s as if</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="7.14">President Trump is a cop and he&amp;#39;s racing</text>
  <text start="384.84" dur="6.03">to a bank that is being robbed and he</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="3.93">kicks in the door and stops the robbery</text>
  <text start="390.87" dur="3.9">from happening right and that the</text>
  <text start="393" dur="4.02">robbery is basically metaphorically</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="4.649">speaking it&amp;#39;s the attempted coup of our</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="3.57">government and he stops that and then</text>
  <text start="399.419" dur="3.351">robber Muller show</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="5.22">whose let&amp;#39;s say robber molars like his</text>
  <text start="402.77" dur="4.93">some you know one of the IGP aeronaut</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="4.17">the IG people the Internal Affairs</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="4.47">people comes by and says well good job</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="5.16">stopping that bank robbery but we got</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="5.07">you for illegally switching lanes</text>
  <text start="415.14" dur="4.91">without using a blinker we got you for</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="6.12">running two red lights we got you for</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="5.77">passing on the your passing on the wrong</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="4.56">side we got you for double parking when</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="4.62">you got to the bank we got you and</text>
  <text start="427.92" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;re like what what do you have you</text>
  <text start="430.44" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t have anything you basically are</text>
  <text start="432.33" dur="5.84">telling me that you have caught the</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="5.88">president in trying to obstruct justice</text>
  <text start="438.17" dur="4.63">but the Justice that was being</text>
  <text start="440.43" dur="4.53">obstructed was an illegal hoax that was</text>
  <text start="442.8" dur="3.24">perpetrated to frame the President to</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="4.56">remove him from power</text>
  <text start="446.04" dur="6.63">I fail to see how there&amp;#39;s obstruction in</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="4.65">any of that but hey you know you guys</text>
  <text start="452.67" dur="3.51">can do without as you may know this is a</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="5.07">story that keeps getting crazier and</text>
  <text start="456.18" dur="4.5">crazier Joe Biden right so Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="2.85">comes out and they&amp;#39;re having all these</text>

  <text start="463.38" dur="4.92">touching women and children and very</text>
  <text start="465.21" dur="5.64">inappropriate and in looking seemingly</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="5.25">disgusting ways and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="470.85" dur="6.81">get ahead of this story this guy to me I</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="6.42">got no sympathy and you know you I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="4.46">seen the videos they&amp;#39;re to me they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="4.35">disgusting to me it&amp;#39;s quite obvious and</text>
  <text start="482.12" dur="3.34">I&amp;#39;ll leave it there I want you know you</text>
  <text start="484.32" dur="3.75">guys can let me know what you think down</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="5.67">in the comments but I love the The</text>
  <text start="488.07" dur="6.18">Drudge had liked the cover it keeps</text>
  <text start="491.13" dur="5.55">changing but earlier had like like a</text>
  <text start="494.25" dur="4.08">mosaic of all the different times</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="4.46">creepy Joe touch people and</text>
  <text start="498.33" dur="4.77">appropriately and this is crazy because</text>
  <text start="501.14" dur="3.73">now they&amp;#39;re just saying it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="4.56">affectionate you know maybe he&amp;#39;s just an</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="4.26">affectionate guy maybe he&amp;#39;s just no no</text>
  <text start="507.66" dur="3.99">we all know the stories about how he</text>
  <text start="509.13" dur="4.59">would swim nude in front of female</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="4.35">Secret Service agents he was doing it</text>
  <text start="513.72" dur="4.79">because of some weird perversion but</text>

  <text start="518.51" dur="11.29">yeah you guys can make of that as you</text>
  <text start="521.91" dur="9.03">may but so here&amp;#39;s a great one I thought</text>
  <text start="529.8" dur="4.35">was worth mentioning</text>
  <text start="530.94" dur="6.839">you have the DNC chair Tom Perez</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="6.03">is saying that all the cowards who</text>
  <text start="537.779" dur="4.201">support Trump will be judged harshly so</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="4.92">this is the kind of racketeering that</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="7.35">goes on in the Democrat Party as you</text>
  <text start="545.1" dur="6.09">guys know this is really the the it just</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="4.34">basically embodies everything that they</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="4.5">kind of stand for is this kind of</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="3.49">statement and you would never hear this</text>
  <text start="555.69" dur="2.85">from the right that&amp;#39;s the weird things</text>
  <text start="557.16" dur="3.06">you never hear this on the conservative</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="3.51">side you never hear them say all the</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="5.88">cowards are support Clinton will be</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="5.94">judged harshly I mean now of course you</text>
  <text start="566.1" dur="3.69">might hear a few people say that but not</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="3.24">the head of the RNC I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.79" dur="3.33">going to see Donna McDaniel making those</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="3.57">kind of comments anytime soon but of</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="3.63">course it&amp;#39;s the tactics they use this is</text>
