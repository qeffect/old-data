  <text start="146.46" dur="4.48">we can get around the mainstream</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="4.11">narrative and we&amp;#39;re gonna report the</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="3.9">news that they won&amp;#39;t touch and that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="170.53" dur="4.89">just won&amp;#39;t suggest a lot of this content</text>
  <text start="172.78" dur="4.47">you can go look right now at what is</text>
  <text start="175.42" dur="3.66">suggested next after this video and</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="3.06">maybe if you guys could go in the</text>
  <text start="179.08" dur="3.63">comments and now I want to hear how many</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="4.59">of you actually are being suggested my</text>
  <text start="182.71" dur="4.89">videos next as opposed to pretty much</text>
  <text start="184.9" dur="5.61">probably either Fox News or CNN most</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="5.07">likely CNN and our embassy BC so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="3.75">something I like to hear from you guys</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="3.03">but also if you&amp;#39;re scratching go what is</text>

  <text start="199.72" dur="4.23">and that&amp;#39;s pretty much where we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="3.509">start so here this is something I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="4.47">going to share with you guys this was a</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="5.521">story that was sent to me it&amp;#39;s a theory</text>
  <text start="208.42" dur="4.23">I guess that was said to me by one of</text>
  <text start="210.73" dur="3.42">the the viewers out there and it was</text>
  <text start="212.65" dur="3.3">shared with me I&amp;#39;m not sure if they put</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="4.5">it together if it was something that</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="4.86">they got off the boards but whatever it</text>
  <text start="218.65" dur="4.53">is it&amp;#39;s an interesting theory about what</text>
  <text start="220.81" dur="7.32">possibly happened with President Trump</text>
  <text start="223.18" dur="7.5">mentioning New Hampshire with regard to</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="5.34">President Mike Pence&amp;#39;s or vice president</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="5.01">Mike Pence&amp;#39;s plane having to turn back</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="4.35">on the day that we reported on this</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="5.64">before and what why did we report about</text>
  <text start="237.82" dur="6.57">report about well one of the stories</text>
  <text start="241.33" dur="5.67">that was being put out there by Hal</text>
  <text start="244.39" dur="4.71">Turner&amp;#39;s radio show was that he had</text>
  <text start="247" dur="4.2">sources that were indicating that it was</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="4.71">possible that the US had actually had</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="5.46">one of their subs sunk off the coast of</text>
  <text start="253.81" dur="5">Alaska by the Russians and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="5.91">explained that story we saw in the news</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="6.13">not more than a few days ago here where</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="3.84">it talks about fire killing 14 Russian</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="3.89">sailors aboard a deep-sea submersible</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="7.219">that was able to make it back</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="7.89">it&amp;#39;s you know wherever I guess it&amp;#39;s doc</text>
  <text start="273.629" dur="5.491">and apparently 14 people lost their</text>
  <text start="276.72" dur="4.62">lives now according to other reports it</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="4.5">said that of those 14 sailors who lost</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="4.53">their lives the Russian sailors there</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="4.65">were seven captains and that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="285.87" dur="4.65">that to remember as we go forward in</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="6.32">this story but you guys remember this is</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="8.369">a nuclear-powered sub s 12 loss shark</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="6.25">and apparently it caught fire 14 sailors</text>
  <text start="298.889" dur="5.671">died and there were reports that it had</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="7.59">engaged one of our vessels and sunk it</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="6.449">but that is still unverified the the</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="3.959">story was the theory yes</text>
  <text start="311.009" dur="4.771">the speculation at the pole at that</text>
  <text start="312.389" dur="6.93">point was that the Americans had or the</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="6.06">u.s. had cost had caught the Russian sub</text>
  <text start="319.319" dur="5.94">inside of us territorial waters and</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="4.949">engaging in some sort of activity and I</text>
  <text start="325.259" dur="3.331">think what we&amp;#39;re gonna uncover is that</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="4.5">they were trying to get access to our</text>
  <text start="328.59" dur="6.18">deep sea fiber-optic communications</text>
  <text start="331.289" dur="4.921">cables and that&amp;#39;s what this theory story</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="5.13">speculation you whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="6.329">call it is going to talk about now again</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="3.84">this is unverified but this is a theory</text>
  <text start="342.539" dur="3.211">that I want to share because it really</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="3.57">makes sense so and I want to read the</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="3.87">whole thing it&amp;#39;s a few pages but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="4.169">worth it trust me it says New Hampshire</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="3.599">story may be unfolding based on hint</text>
  <text start="351.479" dur="3.99">from Trump and recent departure speech</text>
  <text start="353.219" dur="3.801">prior to boarding marine one so you guys</text>
  <text start="355.469" dur="4.32">saw that the beginning of the video</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="4.57">Trump commented that there was a problem</text>
  <text start="359.789" dur="4.35">in New Hampshire which required pens to</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="4.62">be recalled based on a reporter question</text>
  <text start="364.139" dur="4.321">Trump also commented that we would know</text>
  <text start="366.21" dur="3.78">in two weeks what happened there happens</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="3.03">to be a critical installation in New</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="3.149">Hampshire which many do not know about</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="4.019">although the information is publicly</text>
  <text start="373.139" dur="4.56">available in a hidden tucked away blurb</text>
  <text start="375.509" dur="4.051">at the end of the page what is there</text>
  <text start="377.699" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s only a signal military</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="4.71">installation in New Hampshire a joint</text>
  <text start="381.719" dur="4.711">beige base which is mainly relegated to</text>
  <text start="384.27" dur="4.619">a reserve wing tasked with tankers and</text>
  <text start="386.43" dur="5.609">other duties what is astonishing is that</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="5.851">the entire DSN system for the DoD is ran</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="4.771">out of this facility says the server</text>

  <text start="398.699" dur="5.25">our overseas bases diplomats etc all</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="3.78">routed through this point you cannot</text>
  <text start="403.949" dur="6.09">call base to base without being on a</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="5.549">base email or otherwise these also hold</text>
  <text start="410.039" dur="3.211">much of the encrypted military and</text>

  <text start="431.639" dur="4.741">collect information from our military</text>
  <text start="433.56" dur="5.19">intelligence why all for all countries</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="4.17">have a deep state including Russia what</text>
  <text start="438.75" dur="5.009">if there wasn&amp;#39;t a fire what if their</text>

  <text start="443.759" dur="5.371">initiated by the Russian military by</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="4.65">Putin&amp;#39;s orders what if in fact the deep</text>

  <text start="451.11" dur="4.739">quote-unquote off the books</text>
  <text start="452.94" dur="4.83">in order to access and tap into American</text>
  <text start="455.849" dur="4.921">military intelligence communications why</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="4.47">deep state global cabal has no access to</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="3.329">the military intelligence being</text>
  <text start="462.24" dur="5.31">collected by signals intelligence none</text>
  <text start="464.099" dur="5.1">nada zero they&amp;#39;re outsiders and have no</text>
  <text start="467.55" dur="4.26">manner to figure out what is going on</text>
  <text start="469.199" dur="4.5">internally to permit them to plan and</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="3.75">adapt to Trump&amp;#39;s playbook now this I</text>
  <text start="473.699" dur="6.181">think has possibly something to do with</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="6.84">the timing of Jeffrey Epstein as well so</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="4.71">consider that it says first time ever</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="4.769">Trump has made them outsiders in their</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="3.87">own game the only way into signal</text>

  <text start="494.19" dur="4.469">down ie Epstein and the rest of them</text>
  <text start="496.849" dur="4.271">desperation of balance as the walls</text>
  <text start="498.659" dur="4.26">close in why do I say this first of all</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="4.74">there would never be that many officers</text>
  <text start="502.919" dur="4.861">of that high rank in that tiny vessel to</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="4.26">begin with the a vessel like the LA</text>
  <text start="507.78" dur="4.41">shark would carry 15 to 20 members at an</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="4.14">absolute maximum each would be a</text>
  <text start="512.19" dur="3.899">specialist in their own right highly</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="3.63">trained and cross trained to handle</text>
  <text start="516.089" dur="4.021">specific duties on the deep-sea</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="4.11">submersible at those depths only the</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="3.84">best of the best would be present to</text>
  <text start="522" dur="4.5">handle situations that arise mistakes at</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="3.78">that depth and no one survives one would</text>
  <text start="526.5" dur="3.48">never place that many high-ranking</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="5.34">officers into such a tiny vessel from a</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="5.01">risk loss or a loss risk scenario let</text>
  <text start="533.07" dur="2.88">alone send them that deep into the ocean</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="2.94">without being high</text>
  <text start="535.95" dur="6.42">trained experts like a normal crew would</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="5.18">be 14 of 21 suppose it died supposedly</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="2.49">died</text>
  <text start="543.11" dur="4.18">statistically each one of the author</text>
  <text start="544.86" dur="3.84">each one of the officers being highly</text>

  <text start="548.7" dur="3.84">deep submersible for all the positions</text>
  <text start="550.83" dur="3.96">is not possible in other words each</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="4.26">officer would have been or would have</text>

  <text start="838.649" dur="4.051">you guys go that&amp;#39;s a theory that&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="841.2" dur="3.48">there and I had to share it with you</text>
  <text start="842.7" dur="3.629">guys because that person that put this</text>
  <text start="844.68" dur="4.5">together whoever it was obviously</text>
  <text start="846.329" dur="5.281">thought this through and there is</text>
  <text start="849.18" dur="4.11">something to this more than what&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="851.61" dur="3.69">reported as far as the official story</text>
  <text start="853.29" dur="4.83">goes so it&amp;#39;s very possible to look at</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="5.37">this and say we we have something more</text>
  <text start="858.12" dur="4.44">here and I think it&amp;#39;s a possible story</text>
  <text start="860.67" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;m not sure this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="862.56" dur="4.14">happened I know other sources are saying</text>
  <text start="864.42" dur="4.53">that the the submersible was actually</text>
  <text start="866.7" dur="5.129">engaging another submersible but if it</text>
  <text start="868.95" dur="4.71">was a smaller one you know not sure how</text>
  <text start="871.829" dur="4.2">that would have worked so this sounds</text>
  <text start="873.66" dur="4.08">like a more plausible story but again</text>
  <text start="876.029" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s just a theory so you guys got to</text>
  <text start="877.74" dur="4.95">take it with a grain of salt and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="879.839" dur="4.921">where we&amp;#39;re gonna go ahead and leave</text>
  <text start="882.69" dur="3.42">that story if you guys want to get more</text>
  <text start="884.76" dur="4.26">information about this go back here</text>

  <text start="1268.86" dur="7.62">crazier and crazier as you look at the</text>
  <text start="1272.07" dur="6.12">facts as they&amp;#39;re coming up so I thought</text>
  <text start="1276.48" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;d get ahead of that story but this is</text>
  <text start="1278.19" dur="8.43">another story I wanted to talk to as</text>
  <text start="1280.14" dur="8.73">well we have this billionaire coal coal</text>
  <text start="1286.62" dur="7.38">magnate I guess he owned a lot of coal</text>
  <text start="1288.87" dur="7.35">mines dies in the Bahamas after leaving</text>
  <text start="1294" dur="4.65">in a private helicopter I believe from a</text>
  <text start="1296.22" dur="4.41">resort or a private island where the</text>
  <text start="1298.65" dur="3.63">helicopter crashed shortly after takeoff</text>
  <text start="1300.63" dur="4.74">which is really a tragedy it was him and</text>
  <text start="1302.28" dur="5.61">his daughters and pilots that were in a</text>
  <text start="1305.37" dur="4.35">daughter and and Friends her friends and</text>
  <text start="1307.89" dur="6.15">they just graduated from LSU it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1309.72" dur="6.48">a tragic tragic story this is a story</text>
  <text start="1314.04" dur="4.95">though that that seems to have a lot</text>
  <text start="1316.2" dur="4.71">more to it than I even seems that we can</text>
  <text start="1318.99" dur="3.87">really tell at this point this guy</text>
  <text start="1320.91" dur="4.71">apparently was a big-time donor to Trump</text>
  <text start="1322.86" dur="6.81">according to other reports he Chris</text>
  <text start="1325.62" dur="5.7">Klein is his name he donated a million</text>
  <text start="1329.67" dur="4.74">dollars to president Trump&amp;#39;s campaign</text>
  <text start="1331.32" dur="5.13">but that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not even what</text>
  <text start="1334.41" dur="2.86">strange I mean obviously his death that</text>
  <text start="1336.45" dur="4.27">could happen</text>
  <text start="1337.27" dur="7.05">just before or as Jeffrey Epstein is</text>
  <text start="1340.72" dur="5.04">being uncovered the the criminality of</text>
  <text start="1344.32" dur="4.52">Jeffrey Epstein is being uncovered</text>
  <text start="1345.76" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;s something that we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="1348.84" dur="5.32">there is not much information about the</text>
  <text start="1351.91" dur="4.08">the crash itself but here is one</text>
  <text start="1354.16" dur="4.35">investigative reporter who&amp;#39;s put out</text>
  <text start="1355.99" dur="4.86">this report and this is the daughters</text>
  <text start="1358.51" dur="5.16">that are the daughter I guess who passed</text>
  <text start="1360.85" dur="4.95">away with her father and her friends and</text>
  <text start="1363.67" dur="4.95">the pilots in the plane saying that</text>
  <text start="1365.8" dur="5.34">friends say Cameron Kline 22 suffered a</text>
  <text start="1368.62" dur="5.13">medical emergency at her father Chris</text>
  <text start="1371.14" dur="5.28">Klein&amp;#39;s birthday bash on his Bahamian</text>
  <text start="1373.75" dur="4.8">island prompting Klein to put his</text>
  <text start="1376.42" dur="4.71">daughter three and three of her friends</text>
  <text start="1378.55" dur="4.92">and two pilots on his helicopter to rush</text>
  <text start="1381.13" dur="6.33">to a hospital the chopper crashed two</text>
  <text start="1383.47" dur="6.96">miles out killing all seven I mean so</text>
  <text start="1387.46" dur="5.91">this is a really incredible tragedy but</text>
  <text start="1390.43" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s so much more to the story it</text>
  <text start="1393.37" dur="5.13">seems now what&amp;#39;s nobody has really gone</text>
  <text start="1395.56" dur="6.32">into what this medical emergency was why</text>
  <text start="1398.5" dur="6.21">there was a rush to get off the island</text>
  <text start="1401.88" dur="5.05">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to keep digging on this</text>
  <text start="1404.71" dur="4.14">and just keep our you know eyes open on</text>
  <text start="1406.93" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s going on there here&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1408.85" dur="4.02">story that that I want to share and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1411.46" dur="3.93">gonna do it really quickly a mystery of</text>
  <text start="1412.87" dur="4.83">the NSA leak lingers a stolen document</text>
  <text start="1415.39" dur="4.2">case winds up so this is about something</text>
  <text start="1417.7" dur="3.6">that happened that was very similar to</text>
  <text start="1419.59" dur="4.65">what happened with Edward Snowden we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1421.3" dur="5.31">in 2016 it was uncovered that one of the</text>
  <text start="1424.24" dur="4.2">individuals was working at the NSA was</text>
  <text start="1426.61" dur="4.29">involved in just keeping hordes and</text>
  <text start="1428.44" dur="4.71">hordes of information at his home that</text>
  <text start="1430.9" dur="3.78">was classified in top-secret and who</text>
  <text start="1433.15" dur="4.41">knows who that information was given to</text>
  <text start="1434.68" dur="5.67">the investigation was basically going</text>
  <text start="1437.56" dur="4.47">into this group of hackers who called</text>
  <text start="1440.35" dur="3.3">themselves the shadow brokers who were</text>
  <text start="1442.03" dur="3.84">trying to sell these tools that seemed</text>
  <text start="1443.65" dur="4.31">to have come from this man and when you</text>
  <text start="1445.87" dur="6.75">read through this story you know look</text>
  <text start="1447.96" dur="7.54">the guy&amp;#39;s name here is uh Harold Martin</text>
  <text start="1452.62" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s the suspect he&amp;#39;s in court it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1455.5" dur="4.59">been a few years now he&amp;#39;s about to face</text>
  <text start="1457.75" dur="4.98">I think the verdict in the trial or the</text>
  <text start="1460.09" dur="5.88">trial itself but either way what&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1462.73" dur="5.46">uncovered here is is that oh yeah this</text>
  <text start="1465.97" dur="4.86">is the sentencing hearing on July 17th</text>
  <text start="1468.19" dur="4.739">and because he&amp;#39;s already been convicted</text>
  <text start="1470.83" dur="3.839">but this is talking about all this</text>
  <text start="1472.929" dur="4.951">information over 50 terabytes of</text>
  <text start="1474.669" dur="4.801">information from 1996 to 2016 which</text>
  <text start="1477.88" dur="3.539">include personal details of government</text>
  <text start="1479.47" dur="3.48">employees and top-secret email chains</text>
  <text start="1481.419" dur="3.12">handwritten notes describe the NSA&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1482.95" dur="3.599">classified computer infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="1484.539" dur="3.87">descriptions of classified technical</text>
  <text start="1486.549" dur="3.36">operations now we don&amp;#39;t know who he gave</text>
  <text start="1488.409" dur="3">this information to but it&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="1489.909" dur="3.961">little bit of a media blackout on this</text>
  <text start="1491.409" dur="4.531">and one of the more suspicious things</text>
  <text start="1493.87" dur="3.72">when you start reaching down through</text>
  <text start="1495.94" dur="4.41">this story is that they were</text>
  <text start="1497.59" dur="6.089">investigating him on Twitter requesting</text>
  <text start="1500.35" dur="5.4">meetings with people and possibly these</text>
  <text start="1503.679" dur="3.571">shadow brokers now who are the shadow</text>
  <text start="1505.75" dur="3.33">brokers I think that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1507.25" dur="3.72">gonna see a lot of this because it just</text>
  <text start="1509.08" dur="4.41">so happens that this contractor worked</text>
  <text start="1510.97" dur="4.5">out of Booz Allen Hamilton the same one</text>
  <text start="1513.49" dur="3.21">that Edward Snowden did and what I was</text>
  <text start="1515.47" dur="5.01">starting to put together when I look at</text>
  <text start="1516.7" dur="8.819">this story is that this Martin guy was</text>
  <text start="1520.48" dur="7.289">involved in was his name yeah Harold</text>
  <text start="1525.519" dur="4.861">Martin this Harold Martin was involved</text>
  <text start="1527.769" dur="4.471">in the same kind of ploy that Snowden</text>
  <text start="1530.38" dur="5.49">was employed was was involved with where</text>
  <text start="1532.24" dur="5.669">he infiltrated the the NSA after being</text>
  <text start="1535.87" dur="3.87">trained by the CIA to infiltrate them</text>
  <text start="1537.909" dur="3.841">steal their hacking tools and all the</text>
  <text start="1539.74" dur="3.96">information he could give it to the CIA</text>
  <text start="1541.75" dur="3.36">so that they could cripple the NSA so</text>
  <text start="1543.7" dur="3.709">that he could do things like siphoned</text>
  <text start="1545.11" dur="4.83">billions of dollars of cash into the</text>
  <text start="1547.409" dur="4.841">worst deal ever created by any</text>
  <text start="1549.94" dur="3.719">government with the Iran deal so that</text>
  <text start="1552.25" dur="3">they could have that money then funneled</text>
  <text start="1553.659" dur="5.01">into their own slush funds without it</text>
  <text start="1555.25" dur="5.85">being traced by the NSA so this guy I</text>
  <text start="1558.669" dur="4.531">think was one of the other people</text>
  <text start="1561.1" dur="3.63">involved in that because you&amp;#39;d think if</text>
  <text start="1563.2" dur="3.27">they were doing an operation like that</text>
  <text start="1564.73" dur="3.569">they wouldn&amp;#39;t just send one guy in it</text>
  <text start="1566.47" dur="3.72">wouldn&amp;#39;t just be sending one Snowden in</text>
  <text start="1568.299" dur="4.321">there they price send multiple assets</text>
  <text start="1570.19" dur="4.199">because they it&amp;#39;s like a fail-safe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1572.62" dur="4.35">game of numbers right that&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="1574.389" dur="5.101">operational you have to have a plan B so</text>
  <text start="1576.97" dur="4.439">I think that this guy Harold Martin has</text>
  <text start="1579.49" dur="3.45">everything to do with what happened with</text>
  <text start="1581.409" dur="4.081">Edward Snowden and they were both doing</text>
  <text start="1582.94" dur="5.55">kind of the same exact thing and of</text>
  <text start="1585.49" dur="5.61">course you know this is a story that was</text>
  <text start="1588.49" dur="4.049">broke all the way back in 2016 but now</text>
  <text start="1591.1" dur="3.539">we&amp;#39;re finally getting to the sentencing</text>
  <text start="1592.539" dur="3.661">and it&amp;#39;s funny how the story&amp;#39;s been kind</text>
  <text start="1594.639" dur="3.601">of quiet but now it&amp;#39;s coming back up so</text>
  <text start="1596.2" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s pretty much we&amp;#39;re gonna leave it</text>
