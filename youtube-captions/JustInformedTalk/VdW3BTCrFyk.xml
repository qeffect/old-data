  <text start="6.41" dur="4.84">we also have a tremendous relationship</text>
  <text start="9.15" dur="4.739">when the military and Japan is ordering</text>
  <text start="11.25" dur="5.609">a great deal of military equipment we</text>
  <text start="13.889" dur="4.831">make the best equipment in the world the</text>
  <text start="16.859" dur="4.851">best jets the best missiles the best</text>
  <text start="18.72" dur="5.28">rockets the best everything so Japan is</text>
  <text start="21.71" dur="3.79">doing very large orders and we</text>
  <text start="24" dur="3.18">appreciate that and we think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="4.14">probably appropriate right now with</text>
  <text start="27.18" dur="4.169">everything that&amp;#39;s going on world is</text>
  <text start="29.64" dur="3.3">changing on this episode of just</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="3.031">informed talk we&amp;#39;re gonna look at</text>
  <text start="32.94" dur="3.69">highlights from president Trump&amp;#39;s trip</text>
  <text start="34.38" dur="4.32">to Japan where he basically told us the</text>
  <text start="36.63" dur="5.04">whole plan on what&amp;#39;s coming with China</text>
  <text start="38.7" dur="5.82">and Japan in his press conferences and</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="4.709">speeches but first ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="44.52" dur="5.07">without further ado I would like to</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="7.34">present to you Tucker Carlson debating</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="6.33">Bill Nye the quote/unquote Science Guy</text>
  <text start="53.719" dur="4.031">well Bill Nye the Science Guy is now</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="4.049">aspiring to a new title bill nye the</text>
  <text start="57.75" dur="3.96">psychoanalyst guy during a facebook live</text>
  <text start="59.969" dur="2.971">event with senator bernie sanders today</text>
  <text start="61.71" dur="3.36">the mechanical engineer and TV</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="3.57">personality said skeptics of global</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="4.92">warming suffer from the psychological</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="5.039">delusion of cognitive dissonance the</text>
  <text start="69.99" dur="3.48">slight bump up from last year when his</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="3.901">he was open to the idea of imprisoning</text>
  <text start="73.47" dur="4.41">skeptics global warming as war criminals</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="4.59">is that the choice Bellevue or Nuremberg</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="2.84">Bill Nye joins us now bill it&amp;#39;s great to</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="3.42">see you</text>
  <text start="80.72" dur="4.24">that wasn&amp;#39;t so much science to me Bill</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="3.87">Nye the Science Guy that sounds like</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="4.14">something very different so cognitive</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="4.26">distance is not a delusion it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="89.1" dur="3.93">feature it&amp;#39;s human nature so we in the</text>
  <text start="91.59" dur="4.11">science community are looking for an</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="5.58">explanation why climate change deniers</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.529">or extreme skeptics do not accept the</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="3.06">overwhelming scientific evidence for</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="3.42">climate change in the most reasonable</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.05">explanation is you have a worldview and</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="3.661">then you have evidence and the evidence</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.62">disagrees with your worldview so you</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="4.949">deny the evidence and then with that you</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="3.18">deny the authorities that are providing</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="5.161">the evidence now if you have a better</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="5.91">hypothesis for why climate deniers deny</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="3.989">the overwhelming scientific evidence</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="3.93">bring it on it&amp;#39;s not a delusion let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.409" dur="3.331">just like the Fox and the grapes well</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="4.109">it&amp;#39;s you can&amp;#39;t reach the brain so he</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="4.499">says the Gretchen look it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="3.031">people do come to every debate with</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="3.481">preconceptions for in your</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="5.01">about that of course but the essence of</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="6.66">science is extreme extreme skepticism we</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="5.88">always ought to be is my hypothesis I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="4.49">a member of those skeptic organizations</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="6.06">mr. Karlson and this is this is just</text>
  <text start="143.87" dur="5.53">climate in denial is denial the evidence</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="3.63">is overwhelming don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="4.2">love you as a person more than life</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="4.56">itself but the evidence for over for</text>
  <text start="153.6" dur="3.3">climate change is overwhelming so we are</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="2.819">looking for an explanation that</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="3.36">weight-wise you guys and that means so</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="3.091">much struck right here oh wait so down</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="2.34">before the name-calling begins and</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="3.06">before you try to end a conversation</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="4.05">let&amp;#39;s start it by asking what exactly</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="3.72">you mean now I think most people are</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="2.97">open Phidias the climate is changing it</text>
  <text start="168.33" dur="3.72">has always changed by the way as you</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="6.24">know it&amp;#39;s the range mr. Karlson it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.05" dur="6.84">still real the core question from what I</text>
  <text start="175.86" dur="5.01">can tell is why the change is it part of</text>
  <text start="178.89" dur="4.349">the endless cycle of climate change or</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="4.83">as human activity causing it that seems</text>
  <text start="183.239" dur="4.921">to be the debate to me and it seems an</text>
  <text start="185.7" dur="4.44">open question not a census question so</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="3.96">what a degree human activity is positing</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="3.569">that it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not an open questions</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="5.28">to settle question human activity is</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="5.971">causing climate change rate to a degree</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="5.339">that it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s a very serious</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="4.8">problem in the next what steps up sup we</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="5.341">know you said it&amp;#39;s a settled point and</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="5.069">I&amp;#39;m not just little point ok then if</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;ll if you&amp;#39;ll listen it for me I&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="209.549" dur="4.771">grateful to what degree is climate</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="3.269">change caused by human activities a</text>
  <text start="214.32" dur="3.449">hundred percent of climate change is</text>
  <text start="215.549" dur="4.591">caused by human activity is it 74.3%</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="4.051">it&amp;#39;s settled science please tell us to</text>
  <text start="220.14" dur="4.05">what degree you know so that&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="221.82" dur="5.04">awesome so the word degree is a word</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="5.13">that you chose but the speed that</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="3.78">climate change is happening is caused by</text>
  <text start="229.32" dur="4.68">humans instead of happening on</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="6.18">timescales of right millions of years or</text>
  <text start="234" dur="4.709">let&amp;#39;s say fifteen thousand years it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.82" dur="4.229">happening on the timescale of decades</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="5.671">and now years now you know</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="5.341">I offered we live but hold on hold on</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="4.139">but you know what I mean to what extent</text>
  <text start="246.39" dur="3.569">is human activity responsible for</text>
  <text start="248.519" dur="3.901">speeding that up I mean please try to</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="6.181">precise if that&amp;#39;s the number your humans</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="5.249">are causing catastrophic ly fast ok so</text>
  <text start="256.14" dur="3.69">at what rate would it have changed about</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="3.271">human activity and you learned that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="2.37">asking these questions but they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="5.31">basic questions ok</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="6.45">Tyl basically the cycles of climate</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="6.09">change the last ice age we had was tens</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="5.58">of thousands of years ago so bear in</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="3.45">mind that in ancient dinosaur days there</text>
  <text start="274.23" dur="3.12">was more carbon dioxide the world was</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="4.14">warmer than it is now there was an</text>
  <text start="277.35" dur="5.25">inland sea and what is now Wyoming and I</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="4.29">understand you have a Congress remember</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="3.51">a member of Congress from Colorado used</text>
  <text start="284.22" dur="4.35">to be underwater and you go to dinosaur</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="5.49">eggs on my way to see it okay but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="5.43">millions of years ago the problem is</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="5.94">that it was tensive it&amp;#39;s us that was the</text>
  <text start="294" dur="5.28">Ice Age the rate the rate is the problem</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="4.56">now here&amp;#39;s the thing half the people in</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="5.16">the world live on sea coasts as we get</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="4.32">the ocean a little bit warmer the oceans</text>
  <text start="304.44" dur="4.32">going to expand and people literally</text>
  <text start="306.42" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;re changing it&amp;#39;s all iced but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="5.55">not as you&amp;#39;re describing what the spirit</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="3.33">of this container and I&amp;#39;m as a real</text>
  <text start="314.31" dur="2.34">simple question</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="3.63">hold on I&amp;#39;m asking you a simple question</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="4.59">about the rate of climate change so</text>
  <text start="318.84" dur="4.17">there is said that it would be happening</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="3.18">but that rate has accelerated because of</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="4.11">human activity and I&amp;#39;m at the were</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="4.56">accelerated is an understatement it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="3.96">happening extraordinarily simple</text>
  <text start="328.98" dur="3.36">question and because the science is</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="3.48">settled I hope you can answer it in</text>
  <text start="332.34" dur="4.29">simple terms which is without human</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="5.58">activity how long would it have taken</text>
  <text start="336.63" dur="6.15">for us to reach this level of warmth in</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="4.71">our climate it&amp;#39;s not clear that it would</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="4.77">have happened in other words humans have</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="5.28">changed the climate so drastically that</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="4.11">we had avoided another Ice Age there</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="4.8">would have been another Ice Age and</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="6.48">gonna happen because if you and me so</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="5.55">the sooner we can do we know that when</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="5.13">would it have happened when when the</text>
  <text start="360.48" dur="4.71">next Ice Age have happened yeah is that</text>
  <text start="363.27" dur="3.39">good question that&amp;#39;s human activity what</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="3.33">would the what would the process look</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="3.42">here&amp;#39;s the point that I hope our viewers</text>
  <text start="368.52" dur="3.39">can understand I&amp;#39;m not in any way</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="3.51">denying that the climate is changing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="371.91" dur="4.26">utterly open to the possibility that the</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="5.37">change is caused by man&amp;#39;s activity I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="5.16">merely calling into question your claim</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="4.32">that all of this is settled that the</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="3.66">first that we know precisely what is</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="3.06">happening and why and that anyone who</text>
  <text start="384.99" dur="3.03">asked pointed questions about it is a</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="3">denier and ought to be imprisoned or</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="3.75">shouted up the standard that was your</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="3.87">word that&amp;#39;s you guys it&amp;#39;s not my style</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="2.98">my claim and I&amp;#39;m really would you like</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="3.46">me to eject men read your</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="3.57">that people who disagree with you ought</text>
  <text start="396.67" dur="4.91">to potentially go to jail you said that</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="5.79">okay and I&amp;#39;m just saying is every what</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="5.11">recession we can talk about that shortly</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="4.08">but is it appropriate to do the guys</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="2.85">from Enron was the appropriate to jail</text>
  <text start="408.19" dur="3.84">the people the cigarette industry who</text>
  <text start="409.54" dur="3.99">promised it wasn&amp;#39;t addictive at cetera</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;re look my only point is</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="3.54">shouldn&amp;#39;t we be encouraging people to</text>
  <text start="414.94" dur="3.33">ask honest questions which I am doing</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="3">and you don&amp;#39;t seem to have the answers</text>
  <text start="418.27" dur="5.34">to those okay I got a disagree with you</text>
  <text start="420.07" dur="5.64">I claim I do at the end okay okay so let</text>
  <text start="423.61" dur="3.78">me ask you this why aren&amp;#39;t you concerned</text>
  <text start="425.71" dur="3.84">about it don&amp;#39;t you have four children</text>
  <text start="427.39" dur="4.59">why don&amp;#39;t you consign it because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="4.44">why I&amp;#39;m having you on if you look you</text>
  <text start="431.98" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t reach correct conclusions in</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="3.72">science or politics or any other field</text>
  <text start="435.91" dur="3.6">unless you can ask honest answers</text>
  <text start="437.71" dur="3.24">without being shouted dad looks like</text>
  <text start="439.51" dur="5.7">people like you but I know what you mean</text>
  <text start="440.95" dur="7.95">so I mean I do mean I have it I want to</text>
  <text start="445.21" dur="5.97">know what what happened without my</text>
  <text start="448.9" dur="3.42">machine it&amp;#39;s a simple question the</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="4.01">climate is always changing you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="452.32" dur="6.93">conceded that you&amp;#39;re saying that human</text>
  <text start="455.19" dur="6.34">speed increases the speed of that change</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="4.77">and my point is what would the climate</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="5.88">look like right now without human</text>
  <text start="464.02" dur="5.43">activity at one point get 150 the</text>
  <text start="467.41" dur="4.53">Britain would not not have change during</text>
  <text start="469.45" dur="4.62">that are going yes Britain would not be</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="4.83">very well suited to growing grapes as it</text>
  <text start="474.07" dur="6.26">is today French winemakers would not be</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="6.6">buying land to the north as they are now</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="6.19">people who plan to run ski resorts would</text>
  <text start="483.37" dur="5.76">still be able to do it in Europe and so</text>
  <text start="486.52" dur="4.47">the climate you and the parasite you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="5.01">using the language of politics look</text>
  <text start="490.99" dur="5.13">you&amp;#39;re not as you know you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="494.14" dur="5.339">popularizer is is the wing and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="5.6">both economics I&amp;#39;m just saying you asked</text>
  <text start="499.479" dur="4.591">what a bit exacting you presented people</text>
  <text start="501.72" dur="3.94">did you ever send people from having an</text>
  <text start="504.07" dur="3.15">honest conversation you&amp;#39;re doing a grave</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="5.46">disservice to science don&amp;#39;t you think</text>
  <text start="507.22" dur="5.069">that so you asked you asked how long it</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="2.7">would be before</text>
  <text start="512.289" dur="3.12">what would the climate would be like if</text>
  <text start="513.82" dur="4.62">humans weren&amp;#39;t involved right now is</text>
  <text start="515.409" dur="5.041">that right yeah yes that&amp;#39;s exactly right</text>
  <text start="518.44" dur="3.24">now probably you might have changes I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="2.7">just saying you don&amp;#39;t actually know</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="4.8">because it&amp;#39;s unstoppable</text>
  <text start="523.15" dur="5.4">this okay it takes you quite a bit less</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="2.31">than six seconds so the climate would be</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="5.01">like</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="6.96">was in 1750 and the economics would be</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="4.82">that you could not grow wine worthy</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="5.46">grapes in Britain as you can today</text>
  <text start="538.38" dur="5.77">because the climate is changing the use</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="5.97">of pesticides in the Midwest would not</text>

  <text start="655.1" dur="4.13">a violation exactly well first of all</text>
  <text start="656.99" dur="6.289">let me say that I think that Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="659.23" dur="7.829">or Chairman Kim as some people say is</text>
  <text start="663.279" dur="6.49">looking to create a nation that has</text>
  <text start="667.059" dur="5.051">great strengths economically I think</text>
  <text start="669.769" dur="4.88">he&amp;#39;s very much I talk to him a lot about</text>
  <text start="672.11" dur="5.279">it and he&amp;#39;s very much into the fact that</text>
  <text start="674.649" dur="5.591">he believes like I do that North Korea</text>
  <text start="677.389" dur="5.55">has tremendous economic potential like</text>
  <text start="680.24" dur="4.349">perhaps few other developing nations</text>
  <text start="682.939" dur="4.471">anywhere in the world and I think that</text>
  <text start="684.589" dur="4.44">he is looking to develop that way he</text>
  <text start="687.41" dur="2.34">knows that with nuclear that&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="689.029" dur="3.12">going to happen</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="4.62">only bad can happen he understands that</text>
  <text start="692.149" dur="7.321">he is a very smart man he gets it well</text>
  <text start="694.37" dur="7.98">so I think that he is he is going to try</text>
  <text start="699.47" dur="5.039">at some point I&amp;#39;m in no rush at all the</text>
  <text start="702.35" dur="4.919">sanctions remain we have our hostages</text>

  <text start="707.269" dur="4.32">remains continuing to get the remains a</text>
  <text start="709.759" dur="3.81">lot of good things are happening and</text>
  <text start="711.589" dur="4.321">very importantly there&amp;#39;s been no nuclear</text>
  <text start="713.569" dur="4.5">testing for two years I looked at a</text>
  <text start="715.91" dur="3.96">chart the other day during the past</text>
  <text start="718.069" dur="4.62">administration there were many numbers</text>
  <text start="719.87" dur="4.709">that were very high like 10 and 12 and</text>
  <text start="722.689" dur="4.291">18 having to do with missile launches</text>

  <text start="865.52" dur="11.52">with the present we discussed economic</text>
  <text start="871.81" dur="8.1">issues and the global economy was</text>
  <text start="877.04" dur="6.78">something that that we also addressed</text>
  <text start="879.91" dur="6.22">there are a variety of challenges in the</text>
  <text start="883.82" dur="7.5">global economy we just we discussed in</text>
  <text start="886.13" dur="8.67">the today&amp;#39;s talk that very importantly I</text>
  <text start="891.32" dur="5.25">have nothing to do with TPP okay nothing</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="3.72">to do I&amp;#39;m not bound by anything that</text>
  <text start="896.57" dur="4.59">anybody else signs with respect to the</text>

  <text start="903.41" dur="5.489">manufacturers we are not involved in TPP</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="4.47">so what other countries agreed to is not</text>
  <text start="908.899" dur="4.44">binding at all in the United States as</text>
  <text start="910.76" dur="4.8">far as China is concerned they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="913.339" dur="4.681">make a deal I think they probably wish</text>
  <text start="915.56" dur="4.5">they made the deal that they had on the</text>
  <text start="918.02" dur="5.31">table before they tried to renegotiate</text>
  <text start="920.06" dur="4.71">it they would like to make a deal we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="923.33" dur="3.33">not ready to make a deal and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.77" dur="4.71">taking in tens of billions of dollars of</text>
  <text start="926.66" dur="5.61">tariffs and that number could go up very</text>
  <text start="929.48" dur="6.06">very substantially very easily but I</text>
  <text start="932.27" dur="5.7">think sometime in the future China and</text>
  <text start="935.54" dur="4.83">the United States will absolutely have a</text>
  <text start="937.97" dur="6.15">great trade deal and we look forward to</text>

  <text start="948.709" dur="4.081">I&amp;#39;m gonna follow Vivian&amp;#39;s lead and ask</text>
  <text start="950.66" dur="4.02">two questions if I can first is a</text>
  <text start="952.79" dur="3.81">follow-up on trade can you lay out</text>
  <text start="954.68" dur="4.37">specifically mr. president what Japan</text>
  <text start="956.6" dur="4.92">needs to do to avoid Auto tariffs and</text>
  <text start="959.05" dur="6.01">before you come back to the g20 in</text>
  <text start="961.52" dur="5.46">another month or so do you expect talks</text>
  <text start="965.06" dur="6.6">with China to get back on track this</text>
  <text start="966.98" dur="7.609">year at all first of all getting to the</text>
  <text start="971.66" dur="5.31">g20 I think that we are very much</text>
  <text start="974.589" dur="4.69">discussing different things with Japan</text>
  <text start="976.97" dur="3.78">we have an unbelievably large imbalance</text>
  <text start="979.279" dur="4.141">as you know trade imbalance which has</text>
  <text start="980.75" dur="5.72">been there for many many years Japan</text>
  <text start="983.42" dur="5.55">having the big advantage they are</text>
  <text start="986.47" dur="5.14">brilliant businesspeople brilliant</text>
  <text start="988.97" dur="5.04">negotiators and put us in a very tough</text>
  <text start="991.61" dur="5.58">spot but I think we will have a deal</text>
  <text start="994.01" dur="5.82">with Japan likewise I think we will have</text>
  <text start="997.19" dur="4.74">a deal with China sometime into the</text>
  <text start="999.83" dur="4.62">future many companies are leaving China</text>
  <text start="1001.93" dur="5.04">right now because of the tariffs China</text>
  <text start="1004.45" dur="4.62">is subsidizing a lot of industry because</text>
  <text start="1006.97" dur="4.47">you know foolishly some people said that</text>
  <text start="1009.07" dur="4.74">the American taxpayer is paying the</text>
  <text start="1011.44" dur="4.59">tariffs of China no no no it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="1013.81" dur="4.71">way they&amp;#39;re paying a small percentage</text>
  <text start="1016.03" dur="5.4">but our country is taking in billions</text>
  <text start="1018.52" dur="4.83">and billions of dollars or farmers out</text>
  <text start="1021.43" dur="3.39">of all of that money the tens of</text>
  <text start="1023.35" dur="3.239">billions of dollars were giving a</text>
  <text start="1024.82" dur="5.16">relatively small percentage to our</text>
  <text start="1026.589" dur="5.911">farmers who have really been a focal</text>
  <text start="1029.98" dur="4.47">point of what&amp;#39;s gone on with trade as</text>
  <text start="1032.5" dur="4.23">you know they&amp;#39;ve earmarked and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1034.45" dur="4.65">gone after the farmer thinking that it</text>
  <text start="1036.73" dur="3.96">hurt the farmer I&amp;#39;m going to negotiate a</text>
  <text start="1039.1" dur="3">bad deal for the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="1040.69" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;ll tell you the American farmer these</text>
  <text start="1042.1" dur="3.93">are patriots these are great Patriots</text>
  <text start="1043.78" dur="4.29">they don&amp;#39;t want subsidy we&amp;#39;ve had</text>

  <text start="1048.07" dur="7.62">to 35 40 farmers at one time numerous</text>

  <text start="1128.32" dur="3.12">think that there&amp;#39;s a very good chance</text>

  <text start="1162.46" dur="5.61">probably is based on his record I think</text>
  <text start="1165.22" dur="6.54">I agree with him on that but at the same</text>
  <text start="1168.07" dur="6.569">time my people think it could have been</text>
  <text start="1171.76" dur="4.62">a violation as you know I view it</text>
  <text start="1174.639" dur="4.65">differently I view it as a man perhaps</text>

  <text start="1224.38" dur="4.409">believe that Iran would like to make a</text>
