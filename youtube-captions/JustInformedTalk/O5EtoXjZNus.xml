  <text start="85.11" dur="4.92">question but before we get into that</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re just gonna look at a few things so</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="3.69">this is a tweet put out by President</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="4.409">Trump saying that that underline</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="5.39">something that&amp;#39;s very common and it goes</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="6.091">along with remarks President Trump made</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="6.009">to the UN today at the Security Council</text>

  <text start="108.509" dur="3.15">conference where President Trump</text>
  <text start="110.189" dur="3.661">addresses this and then we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="3.811">watch clips from the congressional</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.35">hearings with the representatives from</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="4.74">Google who have picked a great time you</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="4.29">know they&amp;#39;re really good at timing their</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="4.29">little hearings on Capitol Hill you know</text>
  <text start="122.49" dur="5.22">right around the time of the Supreme</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="5.599">Court confirmation hearings and the</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="4.35">final hearings on that they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="130.099" dur="3.461">different session that nobody even</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="3.84">probably watched or</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="4.41">was going on but you&amp;#39;re gonna see it</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="3.48">here on this channel but what this talks</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="3.84">about is something that is very common</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="5.13">practice for the Chinese to do so what</text>
  <text start="141.81" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;ll do is this basically you have a</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="3.75">newspaper and they&amp;#39;ll buy an</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="3.75">advertisement space inside of that</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="5.25">newspaper in this instance it&amp;#39;s the the</text>
  <text start="150.33" dur="5.43">Des Moines Register and they&amp;#39;ll buy that</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="4.32">advertising space and then they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="4.53">create an advertisement that looks like</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="4.769">an op-ed or an editorial piece and then</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ll advertise that editorial but</text>
  <text start="162.599" dur="6.631">it&amp;#39;s really basically a paid-for piece</text>
  <text start="165.66" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s been put in by Chinese by the</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="4.74">Chinese government&amp;#39;s Chinese propaganda</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="5.189">that&amp;#39;s being advertised and ran in our</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="4.62">papers but then is being passed off</text>
  <text start="176.069" dur="4.92">basically as some sort of op-ed that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="4.649">part of the paper itself which is very</text>
  <text start="180.989" dur="3.961">deceptive practice and this is not the</text>
  <text start="183.239" dur="3.951">first time this has been going on for</text>
  <text start="184.95" dur="4.77">quite some time actually if you guys</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="4.24">don&amp;#39;t know I encourage you to come over</text>

  <text start="193.89" dur="4.26">covering this for a long time and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="3.84">done multiple reports on this but this</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="1.98">practice has been going on for quite</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="3.12">some time</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="4.079">and it&amp;#39;s finally coming up to the to the</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="3.66">point where the president&amp;#39;s addressing</text>

  <text start="206.34" dur="4.679">gonna hear where he accuses China of</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="4.8">actually trying to meddle or interfere</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="4.53">in the 2018 midterm elections that are</text>

  <text start="219.51" dur="4.8">what we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about here for now</text>
  <text start="222.269" dur="4.291">and then obviously you can see here the</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="5.009">AP is reporting the Trump turns or Trump</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.47">- well said basically China is meddling</text>

  <text start="246.12" dur="2.72">election coming up</text>

  <text start="274.229" dur="7.201">are winning on trade we are winning at</text>
  <text start="277.289" dur="11.16">every level we don&amp;#39;t want them to meddle</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="10.139">or interfere so you see President Trump</text>
  <text start="288.449" dur="5.49">calling China out right there at the UN</text>
  <text start="291.569" dur="4.951">Security Council in front of everyone</text>
  <text start="293.939" dur="5.431">saying they are trying to interfere in</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="5.94">the 2020 18 midterm elections and that</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="5.099">in and of itself is a huge claim but</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="3.57">what&amp;#39;s it backed up by well it&amp;#39;s backed</text>
  <text start="304.469" dur="3.061">up by the evidence that we looked at and</text>
  <text start="306.03" dur="3.75">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter earlier President</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="5.639">Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter where the Chinese are</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="5.4">pulling these these fake ads stories</text>
  <text start="313.169" dur="6.451">that they&amp;#39;re putting into our local</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="6.209">papers and basically misleading</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="4.5">individuals into believing that this</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="4.62">paper produced this article would in</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="4.289">reality it was crafted and and</text>
  <text start="326.009" dur="5.431">particularly its function was meant as</text>
  <text start="328.409" dur="5.16">propaganda produced by the Chinese</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="4.17">government themselves and this is not</text>
  <text start="333.569" dur="4.5">just happening in a one-off situation</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="5.609">this is happening in papers all across</text>
  <text start="338.069" dur="4.831">the country from New York to LA it is a</text>
  <text start="341.219" dur="3.57">very standard practice and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="4.049">something that&amp;#39;s been under or been</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="3.72">underreported and overlooked for so long</text>
  <text start="346.949" dur="3.481">then I think it&amp;#39;s an incredible</text>
  <text start="348.509" dur="4.141">important point to bring up and to</text>
  <text start="350.43" dur="4.889">discuss here as we are doing here on</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="3.96">this video now that being said the next</text>

  <text start="410.52" dur="7.59">questions but but let me just explain</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="5.58">chong&amp;#39;er now we put on two hundred and</text>
  <text start="418.11" dur="4.41">fifty billion dollars and they&amp;#39;re paying</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="7.03">25% on that they&amp;#39;re paying billions and</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="7.83">billions ever happened to China and I</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="4.68">like China and I like President Xi a lot</text>

  <text start="431.67" dur="4.59">be a friend of mine anymore but I think</text>
  <text start="433.32" dur="4.92">he probably respects from what I hear if</text>
  <text start="436.26" dur="5.58">you look at mr. pillsbury the leading</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="4.89">authority when China he was on a good</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="3.84">show I won&amp;#39;t mention the name of the</text>
  <text start="443.13" dur="6">show recently and he was saying that</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="6.71">China has total respect for Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="449.13" dur="7.35">and for Donald Trump&amp;#39;s very very large</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="6.64">brain he said Donald Trump they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="456.48" dur="3.66">know what to do never happen one thing</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="4.14">they are trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="460.14" dur="6.42">to convince people to go against Donald</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="6.15">Trump because a normal regular political</text>
  <text start="466.56" dur="5.52">person that has no concept of what the</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="5.01">hell he&amp;#39;s doing would let China continue</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="3.96">to take 500 billion dollars a year out</text>
  <text start="474.33" dur="4.02">of our country and rebuild their country</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="4.05">I mean they were building 29 massive</text>
  <text start="478.35" dur="4.74">bridges like the George Washington</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="5.55">Bridge they&amp;#39;re building things that we</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t build anymore but we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="485.64" dur="4.41">to build them again and our economy now</text>
  <text start="488.16" dur="4.41">is hotter than it&amp;#39;s ever been I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="4.68">know if you saw the the confidence</text>
  <text start="492.57" dur="5.22">levels this morning that just came out</text>
  <text start="494.73" dur="4.8">fantastic and all fairness to the Fed</text>
  <text start="497.79" dur="6.06">raising raising rates because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="6">never done and there you see it again</text>
  <text start="503.85" dur="4.23">with President Trump pointing out the</text>
  <text start="505.53" dur="4.85">fact that look at what we&amp;#39;ve done in our</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="4.92">in our setup with China and this this</text>
  <text start="510.38" dur="5.11">lopsided trade deficit where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513" dur="5.31">losing billions hundreds of billions of</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="4.53">dollars to them it cannot go on because</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re siphoning the money out of our</text>
  <text start="520.02" dur="4.02">country and they&amp;#39;re rebuilding their own</text>
  <text start="521.97" dur="3.81">country when he points to when President</text>
  <text start="524.04" dur="2.13">Trump points to infrastructure projects</text>
  <text start="525.78" dur="2.28">like</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="3.599">these massive bridges that are be made</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="3.329">and these huge infrastructure</text>
  <text start="529.769" dur="4.681">initiatives that are being taken over in</text>
  <text start="531.389" dur="4.89">China they&amp;#39;re really there&amp;#39;s a stark</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="3.54">contrast between that and what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="536.279" dur="3.601">on here in our country where you know</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="3.899">we&amp;#39;re cutting funding and we can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="539.88" dur="4.59">you know get the streets in order in</text>
  <text start="541.889" dur="5.521">some of these cities in towns and we</text>
  <text start="544.47" dur="5.429">really have to focus on what does it</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="5.52">mean to expand America what does it mean</text>
  <text start="549.899" dur="4.591">to make America great again and in my</text>
  <text start="552.93" dur="3.959">opinion what it&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s gonna take</text>
  <text start="554.49" dur="3.45">is a more robust spending plan</text>
  <text start="556.889" dur="3.121">especially when it comes to</text>
  <text start="557.94" dur="4.85">infrastructure but it&amp;#39;s also going to</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="6.329">take the American people recognizing the</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="6.84">the true threat that the authoritarian</text>
  <text start="566.339" dur="6.331">regime in China presents to our nation</text>
  <text start="569.63" dur="4.84">existentially basically as a whole</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="4.2">because if you think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.47" dur="6.929">doing with big tech that is where we</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="8.07">have to make a focused effort to combat</text>
  <text start="581.399" dur="6.651">this type of authoritarian regime from</text>
  <text start="584.94" dur="5.73">coming in and trying to subvert these</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="4.96">institutions which have grown and</text>
  <text start="590.67" dur="5.37">developed inside of our country they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="593.01" dur="5.31">used American taxpayer dollars for who</text>
  <text start="596.04" dur="5.15">knows how long and they&amp;#39;ve been probably</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="4.709">secretly funded to a huge degree from</text>
  <text start="601.19" dur="4.78">intelligence agencies and other</text>
  <text start="603.029" dur="4.951">organizations so to me when you look at</text>

  <text start="607.98" dur="4.349">and they&amp;#39;re on Capitol Hill today</text>
  <text start="609.93" dur="4.86">testifying all you have to do is listen</text>
  <text start="612.329" dur="4.231">to some of these cross-examinations I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="614.79" dur="4.799">going to play two in particular today</text>
  <text start="616.56" dur="6.2">I&amp;#39;m going to play one where a senator</text>
  <text start="619.589" dur="5.61">from Colorado senator Cory Gardner</text>
  <text start="622.76" dur="4.84">actually does a great little line of</text>
  <text start="625.199" dur="5.7">questioning with the folks from the big</text>
  <text start="627.6" dur="5.19">tech and of course Ted Cruz who does the</text>
  <text start="630.899" dur="6.06">the the best job I think of</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="5.909">cross-examining the testifying witnesses</text>
  <text start="636.959" dur="3.511">there on behalf of who are there on</text>
  <text start="638.699" dur="3.211">behalf of the big tech corporations you</text>
  <text start="640.47" dur="6.239">know the lawyers who show up to</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="8.82">basically swiftly try to talk their way</text>
  <text start="646.709" dur="5.19">out of any type of actual culpability so</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s just what I&amp;#39;m going to cover</text>
  <text start="651.899" dur="4.351">today but it all stems out of this so we</text>
  <text start="654.24" dur="5.8">have to remember we have this right here</text>
  <text start="656.25" dur="5.589">this is a X Google employee who has call</text>
  <text start="660.04" dur="3.81">actually wrote a letter to Congress</text>
  <text start="661.839" dur="4.471">talking about the fact that he was</text>
  <text start="663.85" dur="5.909">working on a project at Google called</text>
  <text start="666.31" dur="5.82">project dragonfly and what was project</text>
  <text start="669.759" dur="6.33">dragonfly while it was Google&amp;#39;s secret</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="12.75">project to develop a censored Search</text>
  <text start="676.089" dur="10.5">Search product search engine for China</text>
  <text start="684.88" dur="4.59">now what did that entail well that</text>
  <text start="686.589" dur="4.261">entailed giving China access to people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.47" dur="3.479">information now what does that mean</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="4.26">think about this you know how here in</text>
  <text start="692.949" dur="5.161">the United States we have privacy we</text>
  <text start="695.11" dur="6.029">have the expectation of privacy to where</text>
  <text start="698.11" dur="5.55">a company like Google can&amp;#39;t just take</text>
  <text start="701.139" dur="6">our information and give it to so-and-so</text>
  <text start="703.66" dur="5.13">but they can now with certain ways that</text>
  <text start="707.139" dur="3.541">the laws have been written and the way</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="5.099">that they&amp;#39;ve been exempted from any type</text>
  <text start="710.68" dur="4.889">of culpability in handling that data and</text>
  <text start="713.889" dur="3.031">they&amp;#39;ve exhibited it that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="715.569" dur="4.621">really care about whose data they give</text>
  <text start="716.92" dur="7.349">it to or who who they give your data to</text>
  <text start="720.19" dur="5.31">although there are some policies that</text>
  <text start="724.269" dur="4.081">are written in that would prevent them</text>
  <text start="725.5" dur="3.839">from doing anything too extreme plus you</text>
  <text start="728.35" dur="2.669">have the protections of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="729.339" dur="5.49">and the protections of the Bill of</text>
  <text start="731.019" dur="7.25">Rights so in China they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="734.829" dur="5.88">and the fear really is that China is</text>
  <text start="738.269" dur="4.901">lobbying Google to make a search engine</text>
  <text start="740.709" dur="4.411">that is one of the most powerful search</text>
  <text start="743.17" dur="5.3">engines you can imagine they could also</text>
  <text start="745.12" dur="5.519">take basically uncover they identify</text>
  <text start="748.47" dur="5.29">identities of people who are political</text>
  <text start="750.639" dur="5.551">dissidents even people who are being</text>
  <text start="753.76" dur="4.28">religiously persecutors in that country</text>
  <text start="756.19" dur="5.28">can be targeted through this search</text>
  <text start="758.04" dur="5.59">engines ability to go back and expose</text>
  <text start="761.47" dur="4.77">personal identifying information and</text>
  <text start="763.63" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s exactly what the testimony on</text>
  <text start="766.24" dur="4.37">Capitol Hill is going over and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="768.13" dur="5.91">what this guy Jack Powell San Paulson</text>
  <text start="770.61" dur="5.5">actually resigned in protest stuff from</text>
  <text start="774.04" dur="3.39">Google and we covered this before here</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="3.899">on the channel but the story is</text>
  <text start="777.43" dur="4.29">continuing to evolve as he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="780.009" dur="3.361">written a letter to Congress and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="2.969">had they&amp;#39;ve called these hearings now</text>
  <text start="783.37" dur="2.699">where they&amp;#39;re actually talking about</text>
  <text start="784.689" dur="4.02">data privacy but they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="786.069" dur="7.321">in a way that actually makes us really</text>
  <text start="788.709" dur="8.911">really look in hard detail at what Guu</text>
  <text start="793.39" dur="6.93">is considering doing by moving over into</text>
  <text start="797.62" dur="5.57">China so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and take a</text>
  <text start="800.32" dur="5.37">second and we&amp;#39;re gonna watch these</text>
  <text start="803.19" dur="4.72">basically Google we&amp;#39;re gonna watch</text>
  <text start="805.69" dur="4.17">Google dodge a bunch of questions about</text>
  <text start="807.91" dur="4.41">China but they&amp;#39;re good questions and</text>
  <text start="809.86" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re very much meant to be the</text>
  <text start="812.32" dur="7.32">beginning of the conversation I believe</text>
  <text start="814.57" dur="8.75">and we&amp;#39;ll see when we hear from Cory</text>
  <text start="819.64" dur="6.09">Gardner and Ted Cruz about exactly what</text>
  <text start="823.32" dur="4.54">their line of questioning goes into</text>
  <text start="825.73" dur="4.59">which is just it&amp;#39;s very on point in it</text>
  <text start="827.86" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s asking very pointed questions like</text>
  <text start="830.32" dur="4.29">why is it okay that the majority of</text>
  <text start="832.48" dur="6.78">people at Google would rather work for</text>
  <text start="834.61" dur="7.44">China or would would rather work not</text>
  <text start="839.26" dur="5.76">work with the United States then to work</text>
  <text start="842.05" dur="4.65">with China in their authoritarian regime</text>
  <text start="845.02" dur="2.85">you know that kind of stuff and when I</text>
  <text start="846.7" dur="2.64">say the United States I mean the United</text>
  <text start="847.87" dur="3.81">States military we&amp;#39;re talking more</text>
  <text start="849.34" dur="4.71">specifically about project maven which a</text>
  <text start="851.68" dur="4.64">lot of people inside of Google protested</text>
  <text start="854.05" dur="5.07">and then they actually ended up denying</text>
  <text start="856.32" dur="4.95">to help the US military which is just</text>
  <text start="859.12" dur="5.55">unfathomable to me even though they are</text>
  <text start="861.27" dur="4.69">doing air quotes private company but we</text>
  <text start="864.67" dur="3.24">all know where they got their start we</text>
  <text start="865.96" dur="3.84">all know Google is connected directly to</text>
  <text start="867.91" dur="3.87">DARPA and we all know that the United</text>
  <text start="869.8" dur="4.77">States government put millions if not</text>
  <text start="871.78" dur="4.35">billions of dollars into this company so</text>
  <text start="874.57" dur="5.4">it would only be fair to say that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="876.13" dur="6.39">all stakeholders in the Google as it is</text>
  <text start="879.97" dur="4.35">today because it came from our our</text>
  <text start="882.52" dur="6.24">country it came from our proverbial</text>
  <text start="884.32" dur="6.45">loins here in America we created this it</text>
  <text start="888.76" dur="5.64">was our of freedom</text>
  <text start="890.77" dur="6.09">it was our a great country and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="894.4" dur="4.71">incredible institutions that allowed the</text>
  <text start="896.86" dur="4.08">individuals who started it to do it and</text>
  <text start="899.11" dur="2.97">not to mention they probably had a lot</text>
  <text start="900.94" dur="3.03">of help along the way</text>
  <text start="902.08" dur="4.85">and I think we all know what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.97" dur="5.79">referring to but let&amp;#39;s watch these two</text>
  <text start="906.93" dur="4.54">cross-examinations were basically just</text>
  <text start="909.76" dur="4.71">really great stuff happening so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="911.47" dur="4.05">let&amp;#39;s listen Thank You Jeremy third and</text>

  <text start="1810.45" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re stepping outside of my core domain</text>
  <text start="1811.89" dur="5.52">here but my understanding is that one of</text>
  <text start="1814.44" dur="5.22">the Paramount design decisions for our</text>
  <text start="1817.41" dur="4.02">engineering teams in our many products</text>

  <text start="1821.43" dur="3.81">right we&amp;#39;re having a problem with with</text>
  <text start="1823.38" dur="3.72">answering the question I asked if Google</text>
  <text start="1825.24" dur="3.51">assesses this question if you if you</text>
  <text start="1827.1" dur="2.64">studied I can tell you millions of</text>
  <text start="1828.75" dur="4.17">Americans like you can&amp;#39;t tell you</text>
  <text start="1829.74" dur="5.1">millions of Texans believe that big tech</text>

  <text start="1837.24" dur="3.96">silencing the voices of conservatives</text>
  <text start="1839.04" dur="4.65">one of the frustrating things about this</text>
  <text start="1841.2" dur="5.49">issue is there&amp;#39;s almost no transparency</text>
  <text start="1843.69" dur="4.74">there are almost no public data to</text>
  <text start="1846.69" dur="4.2">assess if that&amp;#39;s accurate or not so my</text>
  <text start="1848.43" dur="5.1">question is is Google analyzing the</text>
  <text start="1850.89" dur="4.26">question is Google actually looking not</text>
  <text start="1853.53" dur="3.45">your own personal experience of</text>

  <text start="1880.38" dur="4.289">I consistently see a commitment okay</text>
  <text start="1882.72" dur="5.93">I&amp;#39;ll try just one more time are you</text>
  <text start="1884.669" dur="6.63">aware of any efforts of Google to assess</text>
  <text start="1888.65" dur="4.029">whether search results have a political</text>

  <text start="1892.679" dur="3.541">don&amp;#39;t have a bias are you aware of</text>
  <text start="1893.88" dur="6.12">efforts to actually empirically assess</text>
  <text start="1896.22" dur="5.579">and determine it as chief privacy</text>
  <text start="1900" dur="5.45">officer of Google I am not aware of such</text>
  <text start="1901.799" dur="6.991">efforts thank you so there you have it</text>
  <text start="1905.45" dur="6.64">Ted Cruz calling it like it is I&amp;#39;d love</text>
  <text start="1908.79" dur="5.61">to see him up there grilling them but it</text>

  <text start="1926.97" dur="3.81">with in the history of our entire</text>
  <text start="1928.29" dur="4.29">existence so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to figure</text>
  <text start="1930.78" dur="4.92">out new and clever and intelligent ways</text>
  <text start="1932.58" dur="6.06">to deal with this and to entice these</text>
  <text start="1935.7" dur="5.58">companies to come back and and basically</text>
  <text start="1938.64" dur="4.919">show them that what they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1941.28" dur="3.779">involved with with China is is way worse</text>

  <text start="1945.059" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;re very willing it seems to just</text>
