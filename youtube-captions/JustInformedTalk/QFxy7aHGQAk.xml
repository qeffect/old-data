  <text start="8.2" dur="4.38">screaming ranting and raving and on the</text>
  <text start="11.11" dur="4.38">southern border where we are right now</text>
  <text start="12.58" dur="5.55">building a tremendous wall then I wanted</text>

  <text start="192.56" dur="4.41">president Trump&amp;#39;s incredible press</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="3.81">conference today where he called out the</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="4.32">media he called out the Democrats he</text>
  <text start="199.1" dur="4.53">called out all this corruption and this</text>
  <text start="201.29" dur="5.01">coup and this treason and I couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="4.32">more thankful and so with that if you</text>
  <text start="206.3" dur="3.42">guys also are going what&amp;#39;s queueing on</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="3.539">what&amp;#39;s this guy going on about like</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="3.09">watch this video was cute on the Great</text>
  <text start="211.489" dur="3.211">Awakening it&amp;#39;ll give you all the</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="6.06">information you need plus a whole lot</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="7.259">more so think about this Bernie Sanders</text>
  <text start="218.87" dur="4.86">has just undergone undergone emergency</text>
  <text start="221.959" dur="3.361">heart surgery of course we&amp;#39;re thoughts</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="5.67">and prayers with him and his family</text>
  <text start="225.32" dur="6.54">through this because obviously that is</text>
  <text start="229.4" dur="4.98">our duty as Christians to you know pray</text>
  <text start="231.86" dur="4.099">for others especially those who may not</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="4.77">agree with her like all that much right</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="4.75">but with that in mind this clears the</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="3.51">field now what do you mean clears the</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="4.111">field well a lot of people been talking</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="3.78">about how you know this whole whistle</text>
  <text start="244.82" dur="3.09">blower thing could have been set up by</text>
  <text start="246.44" dur="3.6">President Trump and it could have all</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="4.44">been pushed by him which makes sense you</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="5.1">know in a lot of different ways but I</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="4.62">think we all let&amp;#39;s put it this way I</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="4.68">have sources that I talk to about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.97" dur="4.56">going on and they give me little tidbits</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="3.72">here and there and I can tell you right</text>
  <text start="261.53" dur="3.509">now that we should probably start</text>
  <text start="263.54" dur="3.99">looking at this from the perspective of</text>
  <text start="265.039" dur="4.591">the whistleblower is not even as</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="2.68">important as who gave that whistleblower</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="3.49">then for me</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="5.549">how did that whistleblower contact</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="5.16">members of Congress before filing their</text>
  <text start="275.759" dur="4.771">whistleblower complaint and how this</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="4.02">whole thing is orchestrated in order to</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="3.57">undermine a duly elected president and</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="4.11">remove him from power just as we saw</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="4.349">with the Russia hoax the collusion</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="3.59">delusion as president Trump would say we</text>
  <text start="288.449" dur="4.411">now are seeing this with the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="290" dur="8.289">issue but as we&amp;#39;ll see you President</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="6.48">Trump explained later there is he they</text>
  <text start="298.289" dur="3.481">never thought he would release the</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="4.74">transcript right now Bernie Sanders</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="4.619">heart attack heart condition heart</text>
  <text start="304.08" dur="4.86">surgery he is gonna probably be out of</text>
  <text start="306.389" dur="5.431">the race so somebody pointed out to me</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="6.03">well isn&amp;#39;t that interesting how if you</text>
  <text start="311.82" dur="6.2">look at it it when Bernie Sanders gets</text>
  <text start="314.97" dur="5.729">removed from the race he is the</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="7.84">basically the person who is considered</text>
  <text start="320.699" dur="6.78">to be the most radical and Joe Biden out</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="4.649">of the way who is considered probably</text>
  <text start="327.479" dur="6.03">the most moderate you have to ask what</text>
  <text start="330.509" dur="4.861">what was this all orchestrated right was</text>
  <text start="333.509" dur="3.751">this all orchestrated to get people out</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="4.769">of the way so that they could have a new</text>
  <text start="337.26" dur="5.55">narrative for the 2020 election now what</text>
  <text start="340.139" dur="6.59">is that new narrative right here Clinton</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="6.389">Warren I can&amp;#39;t make this stuff up as</text>
  <text start="346.729" dur="6.641">disturbing as this picture is I</text>
  <text start="349.199" dur="6">apologize in advance you are in the</text>
  <text start="353.37" dur="4.859">middle of something I think that was</text>
  <text start="355.199" dur="5.071">pre-planned and orchestrated not only</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="4.141">the president Trump throw a wrench in it</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="4.32">by declassifying his own conversation</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="4.169">with the Ukrainians but it throws a</text>
  <text start="364.59" dur="5.13">wrench in their whole plan the whole</text>
  <text start="366.539" dur="4.321">plan it seems may have been and you guys</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="2.31">are going to want to dig on this I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="3.239">keep digging on it I&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="372.03" dur="4.56">investigating and researching but may</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="5.221">have been to clear the field of the</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="6.24">radical extreme left socialist Bernie</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="5.849">Sanders and the moderate front-runner</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="3.63">Joe Biden now you can call Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="385.169" dur="2.821">moderate he&amp;#39;s not really a moderate but</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="2.88">in the Democrat Party he&amp;#39;s about as</text>
  <text start="387.99" dur="5.669">close to a moderate as it gets these</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="5.819">days right so this is what we are now</text>
  <text start="393.659" dur="4.62">going to see next they&amp;#39;ve cleared the</text>
  <text start="395.159" dur="6.47">way for a Hillary Clinton Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="398.279" dur="5.241">Warren ticket I mean</text>
  <text start="401.629" dur="3.87">you can&amp;#39;t make this stuff up if it is</text>
  <text start="403.52" dur="4.679">true and I&amp;#39;m just reporting it to you as</text>
  <text start="405.499" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;m being given an info about it but</text>
  <text start="408.199" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s the story I think definitely we</text>
  <text start="410.509" dur="3.72">should be leading with on this not to</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="3.391">mention you know the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="414.229" dur="3.09">continuing to try to find ways to set up</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="3.179">President Trump now this one&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="417.319" dur="3.75">interesting so this story is coming out</text>
  <text start="419.419" dur="4.47">reported from Politico talking about a</text>
  <text start="421.069" dur="4.44">Trump Hotel mystery giant reservations</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="5.01">followed by empty rooms so what they</text>
  <text start="425.509" dur="4.65">talk about here is that basically</text>
  <text start="428.899" dur="3.3">foreign governments who would go to</text>
  <text start="430.159" dur="3.72">Trump hotels and buy up a bunch of rooms</text>
  <text start="432.199" dur="4.83">they wouldn&amp;#39;t use to try to ingratiate</text>
  <text start="433.879" dur="5.611">themselves to President Trump this is</text>
  <text start="437.029" dur="6.81">just another fake news joke I mean</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="6.12">honestly it&amp;#39;s a public hotel I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.839" dur="4.681">a private hotel but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="4.229">hotel that can be publicly booked and if</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="5.31">you have a bunch of people that booked</text>
  <text start="449.839" dur="5.491">it they&amp;#39;re just idiots I think I mean my</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="2.939">opinion I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="4.169">ingratiating themselves to anyway they</text>
  <text start="456.769" dur="4.17">may have thought they were but again</text>
  <text start="459.499" dur="3.06">this is just another fake news story I</text>
  <text start="460.939" dur="4.23">believe to try to frame President Trump</text>
  <text start="462.559" dur="6.81">in a way that makes him look bad because</text>
  <text start="465.169" dur="8.49">the real question is this Thomas Massie</text>
  <text start="469.369" dur="8.07">here this is a Republican congressman</text>
  <text start="473.659" dur="5.16">out of Kentucky he says should senators</text>
  <text start="477.439" dur="3.54">running for president recuse themselves</text>
  <text start="478.819" dur="4.47">from an impeachment trial and this is a</text>
  <text start="480.979" dur="5.31">great question because they have</text>
  <text start="483.289" dur="6.75">everything to gain by putting President</text>
  <text start="486.289" dur="5.761">Trump under impeachment politically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.039" dur="3.6">everything for them if they can impeach</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="3.449">President Trump it increases their odds</text>
  <text start="493.639" dur="6.51">of winning the presidency exponentially</text>
  <text start="495.499" dur="6.09">correct so therefore they should recuse</text>
  <text start="500.149" dur="6.031">themselves from any proceedings that</text>
  <text start="501.589" dur="6.211">involve impeachment I think I think the</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="3.629">whole impeachment thing is a joke it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="4.32">their last-ditch effort why are they</text>
  <text start="509.809" dur="4.08">coming out with it now well I</text>
  <text start="512.12" dur="3.719">I&amp;#39;ll give you a hint it may have</text>
  <text start="513.889" dur="6.231">something to do with some major breaks</text>
  <text start="515.839" dur="6.33">from the epstein case some major big</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="4.719">disturbing information that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="522.169" dur="5.251">talk about being basically floated by</text>
  <text start="524.839" dur="5.671">Russia and their intelligence operations</text>
  <text start="527.42" dur="6.33">with an American whistleblower who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="4.71">basically took asylum in Russia a former</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="4.11">Palm Beach County Sheriff who</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="4.679">to have hard drives and evidence of the</text>

  <text start="539.899" dur="4.651">by Jeffrey Epstein the high level people</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="5.519">who are involved and and documented on</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="4.44">videotape with underage girls we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.069" dur="4.02">gonna get into that a little bit later</text>
  <text start="548.99" dur="5.19">in this episode but that&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="551.089" dur="4.35">something you have to consider when you</text>
  <text start="554.18" dur="3.3">look at this impeachment trial and you</text>
  <text start="555.439" dur="4.351">ask yourself really where where if we</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="4.44">come to where the the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="3.21">is just turning a complete blind eye you</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t hear anything about Epstein</text>
  <text start="563" dur="4.23">anymore but you do hear about a phone</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="4.05">call where we have the full transcript</text>
  <text start="567.23" dur="3.899">released that you can read for yourself</text>
  <text start="569.54" dur="4.049">the transcript that says President Trump</text>
  <text start="571.129" dur="3.931">did nothing wrong yet here we are where</text>

  <text start="1811.09" dur="4.77">know about you but me as an imperfect</text>
  <text start="1813.37" dur="4.59">sinner who has to constantly remind</text>
  <text start="1815.86" dur="4.98">myself to be humble before God and to</text>
  <text start="1817.96" dur="4.65">let God know that I&amp;#39;m sorry if I make</text>
  <text start="1820.84" dur="3.63">mistakes or if I do something wrong I</text>
  <text start="1822.61" dur="3.15">have to remind myself about this very</text>
  <text start="1824.47" dur="2.73">passage right here just</text>

  <text start="1827.2" dur="4.62">on a regular basis but it talks about</text>
  <text start="1829.51" dur="4.47">not just hearing the word but doing it</text>
  <text start="1831.82" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;m gonna read the students first or out</text>
  <text start="1833.98" dur="7.98">of the book of chapter 1 James verse 19</text>
  <text start="1837.91" dur="7.05">through just a 25 okay so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1841.96" dur="5.46">read this my dearly beloved brothers</text>
  <text start="1844.96" dur="4.89">understand this everyone must be quick</text>
  <text start="1847.42" dur="4.56">to hear slow to speak and slow to anger</text>
  <text start="1849.85" dur="3.45">for man&amp;#39;s anger does not accomplish</text>
  <text start="1851.98" dur="3.66">God&amp;#39;s righteousness</text>
  <text start="1853.3" dur="5.34">therefore ridding ourselves of all moral</text>
  <text start="1855.64" dur="5.52">filth and evil excess humbly receive the</text>
  <text start="1858.64" dur="6">implanted word which is able to save you</text>
  <text start="1861.16" dur="6.57">but be doers of the word and not hearers</text>
  <text start="1864.64" dur="5.76">only deceiving yourselves because if</text>
  <text start="1867.73" dur="5.73">anyone is a hearer of the word and not a</text>
  <text start="1870.4" dur="5.28">doer he is like a man looking at his own</text>
  <text start="1873.46" dur="4.83">face in a mirror for he looks at himself</text>
  <text start="1875.68" dur="5.82">goes away and right away forgets what</text>
  <text start="1878.29" dur="6">kind of man he was but the one who looks</text>
  <text start="1881.5" dur="6">intently into the perfect law of freedom</text>
  <text start="1884.29" dur="6.12">and persevere zin it and is not a</text>
  <text start="1887.5" dur="6.24">forgetful hearer but a doer who acts</text>
  <text start="1890.41" dur="4.86">this person will be blessed in what he</text>
  <text start="1893.74" dur="4.89">does</text>
  <text start="1895.27" dur="6.75">now that&amp;#39;s an important message for all</text>
  <text start="1898.63" dur="5.19">of us right I mean I know I need to hear</text>
  <text start="1902.02" dur="3.9">it I&amp;#39;m hope that it helps you guys I</text>
  <text start="1903.82" dur="4.59">hope that you understand that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1905.92" dur="4.71">called to not just hear the word we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1908.41" dur="5.19">called to act on the word we&amp;#39;re called</text>
  <text start="1910.63" dur="4.92">to be there for those two that are in</text>
  <text start="1913.6" dur="4.59">need to be understanding to be God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1915.55" dur="4.29">children and and I just love this one</text>
  <text start="1918.19" dur="3.69">verse here where it says but the one who</text>
  <text start="1919.84" dur="4.589">looks intently into the perfect law of</text>
  <text start="1921.88" dur="5.07">freedom and persevere zin it and is not</text>
  <text start="1924.429" dur="4.671">a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts</text>
  <text start="1926.95" dur="4.89">this person we blessed him what he does</text>
  <text start="1929.1" dur="6.1">so what is that saying the perfect law</text>
  <text start="1931.84" dur="7.23">of freedom it&amp;#39;s the one who can look in</text>
  <text start="1935.2" dur="6.15">the mirror and see himself as a sinner</text>
  <text start="1939.07" dur="4.08">and recognize that he needs to or he or</text>
  <text start="1941.35" dur="4.17">she needs to become better for God and</text>
  <text start="1943.15" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s a constant struggle every single</text>
  <text start="1945.52" dur="3.95">day none of us are perfect we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1947.74" dur="4.41">make mistakes but we have to not only</text>
  <text start="1949.47" dur="4.48">forgive others but we have to be able to</text>
  <text start="1952.15" dur="4.77">forgive ourselves and move forward</text>
  <text start="1953.95" dur="5.88">toward God so don&amp;#39;t forget that remember</text>
  <text start="1956.92" dur="4.71">that that&amp;#39;s one of the tricks the devil</text>
  <text start="1959.83" dur="3.9">has up his sleeve is to make you think</text>
  <text start="1961.63" dur="4.74">that you&amp;#39;re unforgivable and that</text>
  <text start="1963.73" dur="7.14">anything that you&amp;#39;ve done is not good</text>
  <text start="1966.37" dur="9.6">enough remember that if we persevere in</text>
  <text start="1970.87" dur="7.32">God we will be blessed and that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="1975.97" dur="4.32">share blessings with others so that&amp;#39;s</text>
