  <text start="775.39" dur="6.48">some compelling there&amp;#39;s a compelling</text>

  <text start="815.47" dur="5.19">as well they&amp;#39;ve already removed the I</text>

  <text start="854.11" dur="4.25">cleaned of all of this what they call</text>
  <text start="856.15" dur="5.55">hate speech and all of this you know a</text>
  <text start="858.36" dur="5.05">controversial conspiracy talk that</text>
  <text start="861.7" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re getting rid of and</text>
  <text start="863.41" dur="4.83">you know what they&amp;#39;re using the excuse</text>
  <text start="864.61" dur="5.55">of now is that there was encouragement</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="3.96">of violence towards police officers and</text>
  <text start="870.16" dur="3.42">public officials in Oregon this is one</text>
  <text start="872.2" dur="3.18">of their official statements and what</text>
  <text start="873.58" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re talking about obviously is a</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="4.98">story that we covered here on the</text>
  <text start="878.17" dur="5.07">channel about I don&amp;#39;t know a few</text>
  <text start="880.36" dur="5.07">episodes ago talking about the fact that</text>
  <text start="883.24" dur="6.42">you had</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="6.7">state senators in in Oregon who were</text>
  <text start="889.66" dur="5.7">purposefully leaving the state fleeing</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="5.4">the state to avoid signing a disastrous</text>
  <text start="895.36" dur="4.6">cap-and-trade bill that would have</text>
  <text start="897.53" dur="5.25">basically put a lot of businesses out of</text>
  <text start="899.96" dur="5.1">business and it would have used science</text>
  <text start="902.78" dur="5.04">very controversial science about climate</text>
  <text start="905.06" dur="5.97">change and put it into the law and they</text>
  <text start="907.82" dur="4.92">decided that they were going to abstain</text>
  <text start="911.03" dur="4.2">from the vote but what they did is they</text>
  <text start="912.74" dur="4.08">decided to not allow the Senate to have</text>
  <text start="915.23" dur="3.78">a quorum because obviously they are the</text>
  <text start="916.82" dur="5.16">minority so in a in an act of</text>
  <text start="919.01" dur="5.43">filibustering these state senators left</text>
  <text start="921.98" dur="4.98">the state and refused to show up to the</text>
  <text start="924.44" dur="4.59">vote by not showing up to the vote they</text>
  <text start="926.96" dur="5.49">could there wasn&amp;#39;t a quorum</text>
  <text start="929.03" dur="5.19">a quorum is having is a political term</text>
  <text start="932.45" dur="4.05">that means you have enough people there</text>
  <text start="934.22" dur="4.23">to have a valid vote you can&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="936.5" dur="4.95">valid vote if as X amount of people</text>
  <text start="938.45" dur="6.12">don&amp;#39;t show up to that vote of your</text>
  <text start="941.45" dur="5.16">voting body so they didn&amp;#39;t have quorum</text>
  <text start="944.57" dur="5.19">they left the state that the left</text>
  <text start="946.61" dur="5.76">extreme leftist Democrats and their</text>
  <text start="949.76" dur="4.56">governor in the governorship of Oregon</text>
  <text start="952.37" dur="4.74">decided to use the state police and</text>
  <text start="954.32" dur="5.76">issue warrants for apparently the rest</text>
  <text start="957.11" dur="5.61">of the state senators which is this is</text>
  <text start="960.08" dur="5.73">the most Orwellian type of thought</text>
  <text start="962.72" dur="5.7">policing and and you know just a</text>
  <text start="965.81" dur="4.92">dystopian future of authoritarianism and</text>
  <text start="968.42" dur="3.72">fascism you ever imagine they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="970.73" dur="3.54">to track them down with the police to</text>
  <text start="972.14" dur="4.2">bring them in like political prisoners</text>
  <text start="974.27" dur="4.35">and force them to vote instead of</text>
  <text start="976.34" dur="4.08">respecting their constitutional rights</text>
  <text start="978.62" dur="4.74">and their ability to filibuster against</text>
  <text start="980.42" dur="6.39">that kind of uncommon there in their</text>
  <text start="983.36" dur="6.03">view wrong bill and in the few of their</text>
  <text start="986.81" dur="4.47">constituents so this is what we&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="989.39" dur="4.74">down to and now Reddit saying that</text>
  <text start="991.28" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ve decided to quarantine the Trump</text>
  <text start="994.13" dur="4.62">or the Donald Reddit because the</text>
  <text start="997.01" dur="3.83">encouragement of violence towards police</text>
  <text start="998.75" dur="4.35">officers well what happened a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1000.84" dur="4.21">militiamen showed up in Oregon and</text>
  <text start="1003.1" dur="5.19">basically said you&amp;#39;re not going to go</text>
  <text start="1005.05" dur="5.46">track down these senators because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1008.29" dur="4.35">a form of authoritarian fascism and we</text>
  <text start="1010.51" dur="3.06">will use force to stop you I mean I</text>
  <text start="1012.64" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t know if they actually said that</text>
  <text start="1013.57" dur="4.65">but I&amp;#39;m suing that was what the intimate</text>
  <text start="1016.51" dur="4.35">that that&amp;#39;s what they were</text>
  <text start="1018.22" dur="4.559">you know intending was to say that that</text>
  <text start="1020.86" dur="3.089">we will stand up for constitutionally</text>
  <text start="1022.779" dur="3.001">protected rights and will protect</text>
  <text start="1023.949" dur="4.801">citizens who are being politically</text>
  <text start="1025.78" dur="5.279">targeted by the state I mean that this</text>
  <text start="1028.75" dur="4.74">is not like you went to a 7-eleven and</text>
  <text start="1031.059" dur="4.591">stole some candy or you went to a bank</text>
  <text start="1033.49" dur="5.219">and robbed it this is like you are</text>
  <text start="1035.65" dur="5.34">literally being you you&amp;#39;re being forced</text>
  <text start="1038.709" dur="4.771">to participate in the political process</text>
  <text start="1040.99" dur="4.14">at the end of a gun that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="1043.48" dur="3.3">were trying to do an organ and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1045.13" dur="4.82">what they stopped the militiamen and</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="5.879">along with the the very you know I think</text>
  <text start="1049.95" dur="4.54">admirable state senators who decided to</text>
  <text start="1052.659" dur="3.451">leave the state instead of you know</text>
  <text start="1054.49" dur="4.5">participating in something they believed</text>
  <text start="1056.11" dur="5.16">to be completely wrong so this is where</text>
  <text start="1058.99" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ve come to where now that&amp;#39;s it is</text>
  <text start="1061.27" dur="5.13">looked at as encouraging violence toward</text>
  <text start="1063.22" dur="5.55">police well then when the police start</text>
  <text start="1066.4" dur="4.92">violating your your civil rights and</text>
  <text start="1068.77" dur="4.019">your rights in this country is there a</text>

  <text start="1072.789" dur="2.88">allowed to stand up for yourself</text>
  <text start="1073.87" dur="4.71">obviously especially if you&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="1075.669" dur="4.5">right that&amp;#39;s what this is talking about</text>
  <text start="1078.58" dur="3.36">and I&amp;#39;m sure there was a bunch of</text>
