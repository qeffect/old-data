  <text start="580.43" dur="3.69">findings the presiding FISA Court judge</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="3.63">seems to have come down on the side of</text>

  <text start="608.87" dur="4.26">defense of the indefensible so what it</text>
  <text start="611.27" dur="3.03">sounds like to me is if you take these</text>
  <text start="613.13" dur="3.6">stories and you put them next to each</text>
  <text start="614.3" dur="4.77">other you kind of see a pattern where</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="3.81">they tried to get rid of it they tried</text>
  <text start="619.07" dur="3.09">to sweep it under the rug they tried to</text>
  <text start="620.54" dur="3.11">say we&amp;#39;re not going to talk about this</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re just going to make it go away oh</text>
  <text start="623.65" dur="6.88">and guess what happened we the people</text>
  <text start="627.32" dur="5.82">have kept it going we have said we</text>
  <text start="630.53" dur="4.38">demand justice and now look who is you</text>
  <text start="633.14" dur="3.24">know turning around now it seems like</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re starting to say well we need to</text>
  <text start="636.38" dur="3.96">investigate this well hopefully they</text>
  <text start="639.02" dur="3.87">haven&amp;#39;t destroyed all the evidence that</text>
  <text start="640.34" dur="5.34">would prove exactly what they&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="642.89" dur="6.15">to you know prove here which is that the</text>
  <text start="645.68" dur="5.82">FBI personnel misled and as it is</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="5.96">suggested up here in a corrupt manner</text>
  <text start="651.5" dur="6.51">the FISA Court against President Trump</text>
  <text start="655" dur="4.33">so I just have to throw that out there I</text>
  <text start="658.01" dur="3.06">thought this was interesting when you</text>
  <text start="659.33" dur="3.42">see these storylines kind of converge</text>
  <text start="661.07" dur="3.15">and and you know leave your thoughts</text>
  <text start="662.75" dur="3.84">down the comment someone here you guys</text>
  <text start="664.22" dur="3.52">have to think about all this US embassy</text>
  <text start="666.59" dur="2.83">compound in Baghdad</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="4.26">targeted by a mob protesting airstrikes</text>
  <text start="669.42" dur="4.53">City and plan so this is the story</text>
  <text start="672" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s developing I guess there was a</text>
  <text start="673.95" dur="5.25">mob of people and I ran back to militia</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="4.77">group who forced their way into the</text>
  <text start="679.2" dur="6.3">Green Zone earlier this earlier today</text>
  <text start="681.33" dur="6.45">and actually went to attacking the u.s.</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="3.48">embassy you know hitting it tearing it</text>
  <text start="687.78" dur="3.48">down lighting it on fire</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="4.77">another Benghazi in the making now I</text>
  <text start="691.26" dur="4.38">actually know some people who are you</text>
  <text start="693.75" dur="3.39">know coming out as whistleblowers about</text>
  <text start="695.64" dur="4.11">getting Benghazi good friends of mine</text>
  <text start="697.14" dur="4.17">good sources for information about</text>
  <text start="699.75" dur="3.69">everything that&amp;#39;s going on here and I</text>
  <text start="701.31" dur="4.17">conferred with them today you know</text>
  <text start="703.44" dur="6.03">specifically one person in particular</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="5.55">but about what was happening you know</text>
  <text start="709.47" dur="3.12">with this whole thing and they just kind</text>
  <text start="711.03" dur="3.36">of agreed that President Trump was</text>
  <text start="712.59" dur="3.33">taking all the right steps here now is</text>
  <text start="714.39" dur="3.18">this another way that they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="715.92" dur="4.41">to draw us in the war I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="717.57" dur="4.95">happening here is very simple I think if</text>
  <text start="720.33" dur="3.75">you look at it kind of from an outside</text>
  <text start="722.52" dur="2.57">perspective in and given what we know</text>
  <text start="724.08" dur="3.57">about what happened with Benghazi</text>
  <text start="725.09" dur="4.81">there&amp;#39;s a massive difference in how this</text>
  <text start="727.65" dur="4.95">this attack on this embassy is being</text>
  <text start="729.9" dur="4.92">handled but it seems that this is also a</text>
  <text start="732.6" dur="5.55">provocation against President Trump why</text>
  <text start="734.82" dur="6.66">because there are certain powers that be</text>
  <text start="738.15" dur="5.43">right now who have the ability to set</text>
  <text start="741.48" dur="4.11">off instances not just here in this</text>
  <text start="743.58" dur="4.65">country but around the world obviously</text>
  <text start="745.59" dur="5.4">and it&amp;#39;s all a part of a timed effort</text>
  <text start="748.23" dur="4.77">when you see what we&amp;#39;re uncovering here</text>
  <text start="750.99" dur="5.42">on this end right the corruption the</text>
  <text start="753" dur="5.79">criminality all the ways that our own</text>
  <text start="756.41" dur="4.27">the people we trust the most inside of</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="4.41">our own government had betrayed our</text>
  <text start="760.68" dur="4.92">trust and faith and that we are going to</text>
  <text start="763.2" dur="4.74">basically end up exposing them that it</text>
  <text start="765.6" dur="4.17">would only make sense that globally</text>
  <text start="767.94" dur="5.07">speaking they would want to continue to</text>
  <text start="769.77" dur="5.37">stir up tension to provoke a conflict in</text>
  <text start="773.01" dur="3.93">order to draw the narrative away from</text>
  <text start="775.14" dur="4.14">the criminal actions that were taken by</text>
  <text start="776.94" dur="3.39">many here in this country and we the</text>

  <text start="780.33" dur="5.52">digging and we&amp;#39;re not gonna stop looking</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="5.43">at it as we remain 100% aware and</text>
  <text start="785.85" dur="5.1">cognizant of the situation here in Iraq</text>
  <text start="787.65" dur="4.83">and understanding that what&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="790.95" dur="3.87">here is you have people that broke in</text>
  <text start="792.48" dur="5.55">they went to the embassy they started</text>
  <text start="794.82" dur="6.239">burning stuff and launching this massive</text>
  <text start="798.03" dur="4.679">protest which left unchecked would</text>
  <text start="801.059" dur="3.63">turn into another Benghazi where you</text>
  <text start="802.709" dur="3.72">have them eventually breaching the walls</text>
  <text start="804.689" dur="3.9">and then you know fighting with the</text>
  <text start="806.429" dur="4.92">soldiers there but President Trump in an</text>
  <text start="808.589" dur="5.73">incredible show of force sent in Marine</text>
  <text start="811.349" dur="4.98">reinforcements a lot of different units</text>
  <text start="814.319" dur="4.71">who are there right now actually</text>
  <text start="816.329" dur="5.94">bolstering up the defenses for the</text>
  <text start="819.029" dur="6.03">embassy itself because you have to</text>
  <text start="822.269" dur="5.28">remember that these kind of provocations</text>
  <text start="825.059" dur="5.1">these actions are all part of a broader</text>
  <text start="827.549" dur="5.46">effort to try to bait the United States</text>

  <text start="857.399" dur="4.92">United States into a broader war it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="860.399" dur="3.33">just it seems to me obvious when you</text>
  <text start="862.319" dur="2.67">look at all the indicators but if you</text>
  <text start="863.729" dur="3.33">guys have any different takes please</text>

  <text start="880.829" dur="6.69">Turley says it says that um he finds it</text>
  <text start="885.119" dur="4.02">highly ironic that after rushing through</text>
  <text start="887.519" dur="3.87">the impeachment inquiry and vote because</text>
  <text start="889.139" dur="4.2">but because Trump poses such a threat to</text>
