  <text start="72.299" dur="3.93">bridge Community Center do let&amp;#39;s just go</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="3.24">through this really quickly the bridge</text>
  <text start="76.229" dur="3.451">Community Center was started by</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="4.26">geography faculty from Stanislaus State</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="4.92">and anthropology faculty from Modesto</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="4.35">Junior College in 1989 to get students</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="2.879">involved in helping solve community</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="3.9">problems and provide community service</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="5.401">while they learn about other cultures as</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="6.15">well several courses in geography use it</text>
  <text start="92.88" dur="4.83">for cultural immersion programs so this</text>
  <text start="96" dur="3.93">is actually you can study abroad they</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="6.03">send people all over the world very</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="5.91">suspicious in in I mean on the outward</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="4.019">appearance would not lend it to that but</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="4.559">when we get into some of these weird</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="5.341">details you guys may be questioning it</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="5.161">too by the end of this episode but it</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="6">says here they&amp;#39;ve worked with cambodian</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="6.3">lao all types of people and then they</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="6.119">bridge the gap and they provide people</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="8.459">who can translate that&amp;#39;s one of their</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="8.011">big things is they supply 32,000 clients</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.631">in Southeast Asia with cultural training</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="6.18">workshop</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="7.429">and they have 2,500 students doing who</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="4.579">have done community service learning</text>
  <text start="141.379" dur="5.291">through the bridge and its clients so</text>
  <text start="143.989" dur="6.191">seems like a way to move people in and</text>
  <text start="146.67" dur="4.83">out and it deserves a lot more research</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="3.839">but we&amp;#39;re gonna get into a few few</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="4.68">interesting things first of all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.019" dur="5.311">listed here at the Southeast Asia</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="4.65">Resource Action Center and it gives its</text>
  <text start="159.33" dur="5.939">details and I think it&amp;#39;s you know these</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="8.07">are resources that are meant to help</text>
  <text start="165.269" dur="6.121">people here in the country who are from</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="5.16">Southeast Asia basically a lot of what</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="8.28">they go through is that people who move</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="7.11">here have trouble with things like you</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="3.33">know translating and understanding it</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="4.77">now here&amp;#39;s an interesting article I</text>
  <text start="183" dur="5.19">found and it&amp;#39;s from the Modesto Bee a</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="4.95">local newspaper and if you see right</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="6.299">here the the contact name and the site</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="5.37">coordinator for this Center is Marge</text>
  <text start="194.489" dur="4.62">Leopold and there&amp;#39;s some really</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="4.5">interesting things that you you can put</text>
  <text start="199.109" dur="4.201">together on your own but I&amp;#39;m gonna take</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="5.22">you through what I found so this this</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="4.079">article goes into it first it talks</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="5.43">about there&amp;#39;s a huge gap between the</text>
  <text start="207.389" dur="6.301">Asian minorities in California and their</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="5.609">Latino and Asian minorities and their</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="6.03">doctors and how there&amp;#39;s not a lot of</text>
  <text start="217.019" dur="5.97">doctors who can speak the languages that</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="5.489">are necessary to provide care and if you</text>
  <text start="222.989" dur="5.161">see reference in this article Marge</text>
  <text start="225.209" dur="5.461">Leopold she&amp;#39;s mentioned so obviously</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.1">she&amp;#39;s the site coordinator for this the</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="5.49">bridge the Southeast Asian community</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="4.859">organization in Modesto but she talks</text>
  <text start="236.16" dur="4.139">here about how most South Asian people</text>
  <text start="238.109" dur="3.63">Southeast Asian people in the country</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="4.261">don&amp;#39;t have doctors who speak their</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="4.951">language or understand the culture she</text>
  <text start="244.56" dur="4.019">goes on to say because of the language</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="4.019">barrier mom Cambodian patients with</text>
  <text start="248.579" dur="3.24">English speaking patients physicians how</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="3.18">to limit understanding of their</text>
  <text start="251.819" dur="3.871">prescription medication some of the</text>
  <text start="253.889" dur="5.88">Cambodians and the survivors the Khmer</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="6.99">Rouge genocide in the 1970s some of the</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="4.541">the Cambodians there are survivors of</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.42">the comuneros</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="4.77">then it says a lot of Southeast Asian</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="3.03">she goes on and say a lot of Southeast</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="2.91">Asians are put on antidepressants</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="4.8">because of the trauma they have</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="6.45">experience she said after they have been</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="5.76">on antidepressants or psychotic s-- they</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="4.05">have had side effects they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.69" dur="4.11">understand because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="4.35">comprehend what the doctor told them and</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s kind of like the what the article</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="4.29">goes into and that they are trying to</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="6.18">recruit doctors and trying to get people</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="5.94">in here so do with that as you may it</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="3.36">just keeps getting weirder and weirder</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="3.36">you know the more you look up what what</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re doing here</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="10.14">so this takes me to here which is just</text>
  <text start="305.95" dur="9.9">to kind of go over what is laid out here</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="7.44">you have her listed as the contact for</text>
  <text start="315.85" dur="4.74">the bridge here just to continue to</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="4.8">double verify here I&amp;#39;ve said several</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="5.49">documents that list her as the person</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="5.16">who is in charge basically and it says</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="3.27">that they provide services and family</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="4.05">support programs for children and</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="6.54">families including those of those at</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="5.45">risk of abuse and neglect so that seems</text>
  <text start="335.89" dur="4.17">to be a trend with a lot of these</text>
  <text start="337.47" dur="5.23">organizations that are somehow getting</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="5.609">involved in all this certainly deserves</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="4.89">more research now this is something that</text>
  <text start="345.669" dur="3.031">was very strange that you know I did a</text>
  <text start="347.59" dur="4.829">little research on the internet and this</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="6.26">is a from the the Merced Sun star which</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="7.671">i think is merceditas county or whatever</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="10.75">in California right there near Modesto</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="8.53">now and it says this is an article</text>
  <text start="365.71" dur="6.329">talking about details emerge in West</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="6.23">Modesto cops shooting and it says Rita</text>

  <text start="415.69" dur="3.45">interviewing the neighbors it looks like</text>
  <text start="417.22" dur="4.47">and it says she and a few of her</text>
  <text start="419.14" dur="4.71">neighbors said they heard about four to</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="4.08">five shots like beard CL Everett and</text>
  <text start="423.85" dur="4.23">marginally people let their instincts</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="4.53">take over when they heard the shots we</text>
  <text start="428.08" dur="4.62">hit the floor said Everett who heard</text>
  <text start="430.3" dur="5.13">about five shots from inside her house</text>

  <text start="463.12" dur="5.88">thing you know do with that as you may</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="6.01">nothing is set in stone or connected</text>
  <text start="469" dur="4.65">really besides the point that you know</text>
