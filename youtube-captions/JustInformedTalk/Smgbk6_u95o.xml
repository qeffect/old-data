  <text start="294.22" dur="5.94">asked Congress for a steel barrier</text>

  <text start="489.02" dur="8.7">first we will prioritize the defense of</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="8.9">the American people above all else our</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="8.17">review calls for 20 new ground-based</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="7.96">interceptors at Fort Greely Alaska and</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="5.06">new radars and sensors to immediately</text>

  <text start="514.16" dur="5.34">great nation we are committed to</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="4.92">establishing a missile defense program</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="6.18">that can shield every city in the United</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="7.67">States and we will never negotiate away</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="8.82">our right to do this</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="7.06">second we will focus on developing new</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="5.85">technology not just investing more money</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="7.41">into existing systems the world is</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="7.35">changing and we&amp;#39;re going to change much</text>
  <text start="544.13" dur="7.32">faster than the rest of the world this</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="8.49">past Tuesday the Iranian regime tested a</text>
  <text start="551.45" dur="7.08">space launch vehicle which failed that</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="5.85">will provide Iran with critical</text>
  <text start="558.53" dur="6.81">information if it didn&amp;#39;t fail that they</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="7.64">could use to pursue intercontinental</text>
  <text start="565.34" dur="8.25">ballistic missile capability and a</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="5.44">capability actually of reaching the</text>

  <text start="575.12" dur="7.29">that happen the United States cannot</text>
  <text start="578.12" dur="8.31">simply build more of the same or make</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="7.61">only incremental improvements what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="8.28">done to Iran since I become president is</text>
  <text start="590.02" dur="9.64">rather miraculous I ended the horrible</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="8.52">week Iran nuclear deal and I will tell</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="8.25">you Iran is a much different country</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="8.67">today than it was two years ago it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="607.91" dur="7.05">the same and it won&amp;#39;t be the same and I</text>
  <text start="611.9" dur="6.09">do believe they want to talk it is not</text>
  <text start="614.96" dur="6.29">enough to merely keep pace with our</text>
  <text start="617.99" dur="7.35">adversaries we must outpace them at</text>
  <text start="621.25" dur="6.25">every single turn we must pursue the</text>
  <text start="625.34" dur="3.99">advanced technology and research to</text>

  <text start="636.44" dur="5.72">the American people from all types of</text>
  <text start="640.15" dur="4.7">missile attacks</text>
  <text start="642.16" dur="4.86">in the past the United States lacked a</text>
  <text start="644.85" dur="5.92">comprehensive strategy for missile</text>
  <text start="647.02" dur="7.28">defense that extended beyond ballistic</text>
  <text start="650.77" dur="8.64">missiles under our plan that will change</text>
  <text start="654.3" dur="7.39">the US will now adjust its posture to</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="6.72">also defend against any missile strikes</text>
  <text start="661.69" dur="8.4">including cruise and hypersonic missiles</text>
  <text start="666.13" dur="9.54">and we are by the way very advanced also</text>
  <text start="670.09" dur="7.68">on hypersonic technology and missiles we</text>
  <text start="675.67" dur="6.48">will always be at the forefront of</text>

  <text start="698.38" dur="7.5">new technology it&amp;#39;s ultimately going to</text>
  <text start="702.16" dur="8.07">be a very very big part of our defense</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="10.85">and obviously of our offense the system</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="12.56">will be monitored and we will terminate</text>
  <text start="716.73" dur="9.63">any missile launches from hostile powers</text>
  <text start="722.79" dur="6.37">or even from powers that make a mistake</text>
  <text start="726.36" dur="7.03">it won&amp;#39;t happen regardless of the</text>
  <text start="729.16" dur="7.59">missile type or geographic origins of</text>
  <text start="733.39" dur="7.35">the attack we will ensure that enemy</text>
  <text start="736.75" dur="7.86">missiles find no sanctuary on earth or</text>
  <text start="740.74" dur="8.6">in the skies above this is the direction</text>
  <text start="744.61" dur="9.6">that I&amp;#39;m heading we have some very bad</text>
  <text start="749.34" dur="8.71">players out there and we&amp;#39;re a good</text>
  <text start="754.21" dur="9.86">player but we can be far worse than</text>
  <text start="758.05" dur="6.02">anybody if need be I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="764.21" dur="7.08">known and I&amp;#39;ve watched and I&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="768.56" dur="6.42">stronger you are the less you will need</text>
  <text start="771.29" dur="6.69">whatever that strength may be v we will</text>
  <text start="774.98" dur="5.19">remove bureaucratic obstacles to</text>
  <text start="777.98" dur="5.57">dramatically speed up the acquisition</text>
  <text start="780.17" dur="8.19">and deployment of the new technology and</text>
  <text start="783.55" dur="11.11">vi we will insist on fair burden sharing</text>
  <text start="788.36" dur="8.49">with our allies I made it clear we are</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="6.179">protecting many many wealthy wealthy</text>
  <text start="796.85" dur="7.53">wealthy countries one country they said</text>
  <text start="800.839" dur="4.951">has an unsustainable cashflow in other</text>
  <text start="804.38" dur="4.709">words they make so much money they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="805.79" dur="6.75">know what to do with it I said send it</text>
  <text start="809.089" dur="6.571">our way we&amp;#39;re protecting you send it our</text>
  <text start="812.54" dur="6.739">way we protect all of these wealthy</text>
  <text start="815.66" dur="6.45">countries which I&amp;#39;m very honored to do</text>
  <text start="819.279" dur="4.75">but many of them are so wealthy they can</text>
  <text start="822.11" dur="5.97">easily pay us the cost of this</text>
  <text start="824.029" dur="6.06">protection so you&amp;#39;ll see big change is</text>
  <text start="828.08" dur="5.61">taking place and we&amp;#39;ve had great talks</text>
  <text start="830.089" dur="7.321">with countries friendly talks one of</text>
  <text start="833.69" dur="6.87">them said mr. president yes we will work</text>

  <text start="843.529" dur="3.481">long time</text>
  <text start="844.37" dur="7.53">I said now we&amp;#39;re asking and that allows</text>
  <text start="847.01" dur="8.01">us to spend much more money within these</text>
  <text start="851.9" dur="6.45">incredible budgets where are just money</text>

  <text start="867.74" dur="3.99">probably liked other presidents more</text>
  <text start="869.66" dur="6.74">than me but that&amp;#39;s okay I don&amp;#39;t blame</text>
  <text start="871.73" dur="7.799">them I would too there was a recent poll</text>
  <text start="876.4" dur="5.26">in Europe the original poll when I first</text>
  <text start="879.529" dur="4.981">ran I was one of the most popular people</text>
  <text start="881.66" dur="6.15">in the world and now they said he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="884.51" dur="5.4">popular in Europe I shouldn&amp;#39;t be because</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="5.14">I&amp;#39;m asking them to step</text>
  <text start="889.91" dur="8.11">you have countries paying less than 1%</text>
  <text start="892.95" dur="6.99">in NATO last year I raised 44 billion</text>
  <text start="898.02" dur="4.47">dollars more by saying I&amp;#39;m sorry you</text>
  <text start="899.94" dur="5.01">have to step up the year before that my</text>
  <text start="902.49" dur="4.56">first year so it&amp;#39;s just getting started</text>
  <text start="904.95" dur="5.07">I raised twenty four billion dollars</text>
  <text start="907.05" dur="5.31">with one meeting and until that it was</text>
  <text start="910.02" dur="4.5">just going down it was going down for 15</text>
  <text start="912.36" dur="5.04">years was just going down the numbers</text>
  <text start="914.52" dur="4.59">going into NATO and this year we&amp;#39;ll also</text>
  <text start="917.4" dur="5.55">have a good year they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="919.11" dur="7.32">step up very unfair when Germany pays 1%</text>
  <text start="922.95" dur="8.7">and we&amp;#39;re paying 4.3 percent of them</text>
  <text start="926.43" dur="9.99">much larger in GDP we cannot be the</text>
  <text start="931.65" dur="6.06">fools for others we cannot be we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="936.42" dur="5.03">want to be called that</text>
  <text start="937.71" dur="5.4">and I will tell you for many years</text>
  <text start="941.45" dur="4.09">behind your backs</text>
  <text start="943.11" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s what they were saying so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="945.54" dur="4.95">a big difference we&amp;#39;re gonna be with</text>
  <text start="947.64" dur="6.02">NATO 100% but as I told the countries</text>
  <text start="950.49" dur="5.64">you have to step up you have to pay</text>
  <text start="953.66" dur="5.679">minimum numbers actually the numbers</text>
  <text start="956.13" dur="6.24">should be much higher they said a 2% go</text>
  <text start="959.339" dur="5.191">very few pay then but they should be</text>
  <text start="962.37" dur="4.73">much higher than that if you look at our</text>
  <text start="964.53" dur="6.24">if you look at what we pay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="967.1" dur="6.37">massively higher than that so we have</text>
  <text start="970.77" dur="4.68">very good relationships but countries</text>
  <text start="973.47" dur="5.55">are now stepping up and they can well</text>
  <text start="975.45" dur="5.79">afford in furtherance of this goal or</text>
  <text start="979.02" dur="5.46">plan directs the Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="6.33">to prioritize the sale of American</text>
  <text start="984.48" dur="6.63">missile defense and technology to our</text>
  <text start="987.57" dur="7.8">allies and to our partners we want them</text>
  <text start="991.11" dur="6.66">to be able to defend and they&amp;#39;re willing</text>
  <text start="995.37" dur="4.17">to pay for the finest missiles in the</text>
  <text start="997.77" dur="4.77">world they&amp;#39;ve already done that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="999.54" dur="5.33">stepping up like nobody has ever seen</text>
  <text start="1002.54" dur="5.45">before actually</text>
  <text start="1004.87" dur="5.58">we will also leverage our network of</text>
  <text start="1007.99" dur="5.85">partnerships to share early warning and</text>
  <text start="1010.45" dur="6.81">tracking information and detect missile</text>
  <text start="1013.84" dur="6.03">launches as early as possible today</text>
  <text start="1017.26" dur="6.15">marks the beginning of a new era in our</text>
  <text start="1019.87" dur="6.09">missile defense program for too long we</text>
  <text start="1023.41" dur="5.85">have been held back by self-imposed</text>
  <text start="1025.96" dur="8.58">limits while foreign competitors grow</text>
  <text start="1029.26" dur="6.14">and they advance more than we have over</text>
  <text start="1034.54" dur="4.14">the years</text>
  <text start="1035.4" dur="8.89">part of the reason is we spend so much</text>
  <text start="1038.68" dur="6.42">money on so many other places now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1044.29" dur="3.06">changing</text>
  <text start="1045.1" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;re helping and we&amp;#39;re able to spend</text>
  <text start="1047.35" dur="8.37">money on technology and new defense and</text>
  <text start="1051.64" dur="5.01">far beyond defense systems so those days</text>
  <text start="1055.72" dur="3.57">are history</text>
  <text start="1056.65" dur="6.18">our strategy is grounded in one</text>
  <text start="1059.29" dur="6.38">overriding objective to detect and</text>
  <text start="1062.83" dur="6.24">destroy every type of missile attack</text>
  <text start="1065.67" dur="7.78">against any American target whether</text>
  <text start="1069.07" dur="8.28">before or after launch when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1073.45" dur="4.62">defending America we will not take any</text>
  <text start="1077.35" dur="5.64">chances</text>
  <text start="1078.07" dur="9.57">we will only take action there is no</text>
  <text start="1082.99" dur="8.58">substitute for American military might</text>
  <text start="1087.64" dur="6.69">but when I took office you know it</text>
  <text start="1091.57" dur="5.19">better than anybody in the world our</text>
  <text start="1094.33" dur="6.78">military was very tired</text>
  <text start="1096.76" dur="6">it was very depleted I won&amp;#39;t even tell</text>
  <text start="1101.11" dur="5.16">you the things that some of our great</text>
  <text start="1102.76" dur="6.42">generals were telling me and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1106.27" dur="5.7">being rebuilt at a rapid rate and very</text>
  <text start="1109.18" dur="6.5">shortly will be more powerful than ever</text>
  <text start="1111.97" dur="7.32">before and that&amp;#39;s the way it has to be</text>
  <text start="1115.68" dur="6.07">and as I said the more powerful it is</text>
  <text start="1119.29" dur="5.46">the less likely it is that we&amp;#39;ll ever</text>
  <text start="1121.75" dur="6.99">have to use it but it will soon be more</text>
  <text start="1124.75" dur="7.77">powerful than ever before today we</text>
  <text start="1128.74" dur="7.02">reaffirm that a strong America remains</text>
