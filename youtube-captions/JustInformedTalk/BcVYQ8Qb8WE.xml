  <text start="179.629" dur="3.57">to come here and share this on social</text>
  <text start="180.769" dur="3.9">media because obviously what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="183.199" dur="3.061">with YouTube is that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="184.669" dur="3">suggesting this content and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="3.33">doing everything they can to take</text>
  <text start="187.669" dur="3.8">content that&amp;#39;s like this and many other</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="4.079">people who do this kind of stuff and</text>
  <text start="191.469" dur="5.2">replace them with what they call</text>

  <text start="772.25" dur="3.899">is that blackmail and leverage was one</text>
  <text start="774.769" dur="4.44">of the key things that were going after</text>
  <text start="776.149" dur="5.011">so there&amp;#39;s testimony you can go watch of</text>
  <text start="779.209" dur="4.231">dianne feinstein on capitol hill</text>
  <text start="781.16" dur="4.229">I think questioning who was it I think</text>
  <text start="783.44" dur="6.199">it was Brandon about the fact that the</text>
  <text start="785.389" dur="7.5">CIA was literally spying on US Congress</text>

  <text start="794.93" dur="6.98">House and senators were being spied on</text>
  <text start="797.93" dur="6.44">by our own intelligence community</text>
  <text start="801.91" dur="6.24">now that should worry every single</text>
  <text start="804.37" dur="5.73">person in this country so this is an</text>
  <text start="808.15" dur="4.68">important issue and I&amp;#39;m trying to draw a</text>
  <text start="810.1" dur="5.27">light to keep pushing a light onto it</text>
  <text start="812.83" dur="5.07">because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s such an important</text>
  <text start="815.37" dur="4.6">issue that the mainstream media won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="817.9" dur="4.23">touch with a ten-foot pole and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="3.99">why we have to come here and we have to</text>
  <text start="822.13" dur="3.84">report this to you guys and and help</text>
  <text start="823.96" dur="5.67">spread this information so that you guys</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="5.49">can can research it further I mean the</text>
  <text start="829.63" dur="4.08">fact of the matter is the only way that</text>
  <text start="831.46" dur="3.96">we really really can defeat what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="833.71" dur="4.17">on the corruption and criminality that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.42" dur="4.02">taken over a lot of parts of our</text>
  <text start="837.88" dur="4.02">government in certain areas and with</text>
  <text start="839.44" dur="5.67">corporations and with the Silicon Valley</text>
  <text start="841.9" dur="5.88">big tech stuff is to put a light onto it</text>
  <text start="845.11" dur="4.86">and to show hey this is happening and we</text>
  <text start="847.78" dur="5.79">have to say something do something about</text>
  <text start="849.97" dur="5.4">it and that&amp;#39;s really where this goes and</text>
  <text start="853.57" dur="2.91">again they have great reporting over</text>
  <text start="855.37" dur="2.79">here at the American port this is</text>
  <text start="856.48" dur="3.48">another story that they just updated</text>
  <text start="858.16" dur="4.26">today which was just talking about these</text>
  <text start="859.96" dur="4.62">Woodward and Bernstein and how you know</text>
  <text start="862.42" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re basically assets of the FBI it</text>
  <text start="864.58" dur="3.99">said here you had one of the the</text>
  <text start="866.62" dur="4.92">unclassified US State Department emails</text>
  <text start="868.57" dur="6.2">where Sidney Blumenthal is writing the</text>
  <text start="871.54" dur="5.58">Hillary Clinton right talking about</text>
  <text start="874.77" dur="4.57">Woodward saying that since the deep</text>
  <text start="877.12" dur="4.2">throat he has been an FBI asset he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="879.34" dur="4.74">career dependent so you have an FBI</text>
  <text start="881.32" dur="5.01">asset who gets on TV and and and</text>
  <text start="884.08" dur="4.02">promotes the impeachment of the</text>
  <text start="886.33" dur="4.29">president the removal of the President</text>
  <text start="888.1" dur="4.32">of the United States you have so you</text>
  <text start="890.62" dur="4.05">think there was some coordination there</text>
  <text start="892.42" dur="4.62">maybe with some of the former directors</text>
  <text start="894.67" dur="4.23">of the FBI who are saying look we need</text>
  <text start="897.04" dur="3.72">to push this impeachment thing we need</text>
  <text start="898.9" dur="3.45">to get president Trump removed because</text>
  <text start="900.76" dur="3.6">he&amp;#39;s going to blow the lid on all the</text>
  <text start="902.35" dur="4.71">things that we did that were illegal and</text>
  <text start="904.36" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at that&amp;#39;s truly a rat</text>
  <text start="907.06" dur="4.08">so that&amp;#39;s just one other example and</text>
  <text start="909.13" dur="3.66">they just updated their reporting here</text>
  <text start="911.14" dur="3.95">this was an older report they had but it</text>
  <text start="912.79" dur="4.77">just updates it to kind of show that</text>
  <text start="915.09" dur="4.12">this could have all been planned through</text>
  <text start="917.56" dur="6.63">Peter struck and Lisa page talking about</text>
  <text start="919.21" dur="9.59">how how there was they have their tasks</text>
  <text start="924.19" dur="4.61">as we have our task ahead of us</text>
  <text start="929.93" dur="2.97">because they were talking about buying</text>
  <text start="931.25" dur="3.09">the the I think the movie all the</text>
  <text start="932.9" dur="3.21">President&amp;#39;s Men because they wanted to</text>
  <text start="934.34" dur="3.08">brush up on Watergate well I wonder why</text>
  <text start="936.11" dur="3.78">they would want to brush up in Watergate</text>
  <text start="937.42" dur="4.87">because it&amp;#39;s been alleged that this was</text>
  <text start="939.89" dur="4.44">all this whole thing was to do another</text>
  <text start="942.29" dur="3.81">Watergate on Trump to get him removed</text>
  <text start="944.33" dur="3.81">from office to either have him resign or</text>
  <text start="946.1" dur="4.86">be impeached because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="948.14" dur="5.01">unseat a duly elected president because</text>
  <text start="950.96" dur="3.84">of no good reason other than they&amp;#39;d lost</text>
  <text start="953.15" dur="3.93">power and they don&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t want to lose</text>
  <text start="954.8" dur="4.94">power they didn&amp;#39;t want to be exposed in</text>
  <text start="957.08" dur="4.68">the crimes that they had committed so</text>
  <text start="959.74" dur="3.25">that&amp;#39;s that I&amp;#39;ll leave links to all</text>
