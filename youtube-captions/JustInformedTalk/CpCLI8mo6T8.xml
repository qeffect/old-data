  <text start="232.97" dur="4.38">my family right now it&amp;#39;s a good little</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="3.571">break but you know when you do the news</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="7.83">it never stops right and we are the news</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="9.36">now so it&amp;#39;s a 24/7 job with that though</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="4.8">I want to say let&amp;#39;s see reading through</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="3.98">the comments there&amp;#39;s so many comments</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="2.39">here Wow</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="3.78">everybody&amp;#39;s around here</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="3.25">everybody sing Merry Christmas basically</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="3.12">and what up</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="5.37">I hope the chats not frozen somebody</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="4.5">said that might be the case but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="3.39">kind of get right into the first thing</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="4.98">then since there&amp;#39;s not many questions in</text>
  <text start="271.29" dur="7.71">the chat a lot of merry Christmas&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="274.35" dur="7.41">all that okay so somebody had a question</text>
  <text start="279" dur="5.25">17 years in prison for burning an LGBT</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="5">flag yeah I saw that story</text>
  <text start="284.25" dur="5.82">interestingly enough though I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="286.76" dur="6.07">dope into that story it did seem a</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="4.25">little extreme to say the least</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="4.74">especially since a lot of these</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="4.78">anti-american you know fascists who call</text>
  <text start="297.57" dur="3.42">themselves anti-fascist roam the streets</text>
  <text start="299.1" dur="3.45">burn the American flag every day and</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="5.34">nobody seems to say anything or get</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="5.28">arrested for that but yeah I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="3.63">about that I think there might been a</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="4.649">lot more to that story than just burning</text>
  <text start="309.96" dur="4.11">up the flag obviously I think he stole</text>
  <text start="312.479" dur="4.381">it and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="8.58">history there so I wouldn&amp;#39;t get too hung</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="7.05">up on that all right so let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="322.65" dur="3.269">the first story I just want to talk</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="3.78">about it before we do that we&amp;#39;re over</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="3.841">here on the q board yet we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="5.039">anything new we&amp;#39;re still at Q post three</text>
  <text start="329.76" dur="7.08">seven three nine and that&amp;#39;s definitely a</text>
  <text start="332.729" dur="8.521">point at which you know we&amp;#39;ve been for a</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="5.699">little bit now so with that let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="3.45">into the first thing I want to talk</text>
  <text start="342.539" dur="4.44">about here so apparently the former NSA</text>
  <text start="344.7" dur="3.81">director Michael Rogers is cooperating</text>
  <text start="346.979" dur="5.551">with the dirham investigation into the</text>
  <text start="348.51" dur="7.29">Trump Russia probe now to me that seems</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="5.24">like a really big deal right don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="4.41">think I mean think about it this way if</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="4.78">everything Q&amp;#39;s told us I mean just</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="4.889">before this can&amp;#39;t kind of came out he</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="5.07">was basically saying to us hey you guys</text>
  <text start="365.099" dur="4.681">got to understand Admiral Rogers role in</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="3.74">all of this right and or anything was</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="3.75">like right as it was coming up but</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="3.7">understanding Admiral Rogers rules is</text>
  <text start="373.53" dur="3.569">really important to understand that</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="7.109">Admiral Rogers was the one who spotted</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="7.35">the section 702 abuse by the utter of</text>
  <text start="382.169" dur="7.8">the FISA Court right and then went and</text>
  <text start="384.449" dur="7.59">actually attempted to you know blow the</text>
  <text start="389.969" dur="2.351">whistle basically go he went to Congress</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="2.141">he</text>
  <text start="392.32" dur="3.75">and he said I shut down the program I</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="3.51">kicked out the independent contractors</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="4.14">and what&amp;#39;s really important to remember</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="4.14">is that this was Obama and and the</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="4.83">intelligence community bringing in these</text>
  <text start="401.83" dur="5.25">outside contractors to basically cover</text>
  <text start="405.04" dur="3.66">their own butts for going after Trump</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="4.32">and this is them setting them up for the</text>
  <text start="408.7" dur="4.62">queue or for the COO and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="411.4" dur="4.74">definitely something I think we should</text>
  <text start="413.32" dur="4.47">all be paying close attention to again</text>
  <text start="416.14" dur="3.57">it says here that the former national</text>
  <text start="417.79" dur="3.93">security director and retired Admiral</text>
  <text start="419.71" dur="3.51">Michael Rogers has met multiple times</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="3.99">with us attorney John Durham as part of</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="3.96">an ongoing probe into the origins of the</text>
  <text start="425.71" dur="4.26">counterintelligence investigation into</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="4.44">the 2016 Trump campaign now don&amp;#39;t forget</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="3.81">that I&amp;#39;m Anna Rodgers testified in front</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="5.58">of Congress like I said before instead I</text>
  <text start="433.78" dur="5.28">found this abuse I said it does not pass</text>
  <text start="437.2" dur="4.5">the smell test that this is really</text>
  <text start="439.06" dur="7.44">illegal what&amp;#39;s going on here yet here we</text>
  <text start="441.7" dur="6.36">are of course and this is a big deal so</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="3.33">this is a big story I thought I&amp;#39;d start</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="4.95">there just to kind of get everybody</text>
  <text start="449.83" dur="5.25">going obviously I&amp;#39;d like to hear your</text>
  <text start="453.01" dur="4.53">thoughts in the chat but here we go we</text>
  <text start="455.08" dur="4.08">have our first super chest like I said</text>
  <text start="457.54" dur="2.91">if you guys want me to answer your</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="3.3">question I can&amp;#39;t answer every question</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="4.5">but if you do super chat I promise I</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="4.95">will answer it plus they don&amp;#39;t monetize</text>
  <text start="464.95" dur="4.14">this channel and also your support in</text>
  <text start="467.41" dur="2.82">the Super chats and everywhere else</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="3.45">where I know you guys help me out on</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="4.62">patreon and all the rest that helps big</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="3.81">time as well so the first Super chat</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="5.22">here is from Fitz</text>
  <text start="476.35" dur="5.22">gonzo it says and Thank You Fitz says</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s your thoughts on space force</text>
  <text start="481.57" dur="6.24">doesn&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s already there but</text>
  <text start="483.43" dur="6.03">from our Trump is disclosing well I</text>
  <text start="487.81" dur="3.09">would say space force has been around</text>
  <text start="489.46" dur="3.36">for quite some time I mean you&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="4.26">the Air Force Space Command I think for</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="5.16">however long since we&amp;#39;ve been in space</text>
  <text start="495.16" dur="4.59">and probably before that is there secret</text>
  <text start="497.98" dur="3.12">space program that&amp;#39;s a good question</text>
  <text start="499.75" dur="4.17">usually a lot of people like to ask</text>
  <text start="501.1" dur="5.19">further question and beyond that is you</text>
  <text start="503.92" dur="5.67">know what kind of technology have they</text>
  <text start="506.29" dur="5.19">been in possession of and for how long</text>
  <text start="509.59" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s another big question I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="511.48" dur="6.18">had as far as looking at you know the</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="5.07">the details behind like certain</text>
  <text start="517.66" dur="3.48">top-secret projects you know is really</text>
  <text start="519.52" dur="3.24">good at uncovering a lot of stuff and</text>
  <text start="521.14" dur="2.27">talking about it as a Jordan see there I</text>
  <text start="522.76" dur="2.39">actually</text>
  <text start="523.41" dur="3.66">I happen to know him pretty well he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="525.15" dur="3.78">very nice guy and he he goes really</text>
  <text start="527.07" dur="4.95">in-depth on a lot of that stuff but I</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="5.67">usually put it to this standard of logic</text>
  <text start="532.02" dur="4.05">that every every everything we have and</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="2.67">everything that we think that they have</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="4.53">they probably have something 10 times</text>
  <text start="537.27" dur="7.38">beyond that and the space force is just</text>
  <text start="540.6" dur="6.21">I think our country&amp;#39;s way of as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.65" dur="4.65">been made very clear I think I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="546.81" dur="3.78">NSA talks and other talks from top</text>
  <text start="549.3" dur="5.49">intelligence</text>
  <text start="550.59" dur="7.59">you know officials saying that you know</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="5.91">declaring space a warfighting domain is</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="4.26">an important step when you know think</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="5.13">about this way what was lodestar was</text>
  <text start="562.44" dur="6.69">Lone Star at North Korea run EMP</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="5.19">satellite that was maybe allowed to</text>
  <text start="569.13" dur="3.33">happen by certain individuals inside of</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="4.02">our government that&amp;#39;s a really good</text>
  <text start="572.46" dur="6.45">question I think to ask starting there</text>
  <text start="575.04" dur="5.58">but um yeah that kind of stuff is is</text>
  <text start="578.91" dur="4.14">always interesting I think space force</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="5.49">is just solidifying that we are in space</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="5.51">there is active comm you know combat</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="5.52">activities happening up there and that I</text>
  <text start="588.56" dur="7.39">think it just gives us another way to</text>
  <text start="591.63" dur="9.69">really stand strong in the in opposition</text>
  <text start="595.95" dur="7.2">to other countries China Russia etc who</text>
  <text start="601.32" dur="5.82">are using spaces of warfighting domain</text>
  <text start="603.15" dur="6.06">already and we probably have as well and</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="3.6">I think that we&amp;#39;ve probably gone and</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="4.38">done a lot more in space than people</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="5.64">will ever know at this moment although I</text>

  <text start="616.38" dur="2.88">moon I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the moon</text>
  <text start="617.79" dur="3.89">but I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people with</text>
  <text start="619.26" dur="6.09">some interesting thoughts on that too</text>
  <text start="621.68" dur="6.21">okay so that&amp;#39;s good let&amp;#39;s give him the</text>
  <text start="625.35" dur="7.62">next story here since we&amp;#39;re off that</text>
  <text start="627.89" dur="10.09">topic here&amp;#39;s the next story Army Cadets</text>
  <text start="632.97" dur="6.27">and Navy Midshipmen basically the army</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="3.06">went in and conducted an investigation</text>
  <text start="639.24" dur="4.83">because the fake news came out and said</text>
  <text start="641.04" dur="5.37">that the brave men and women of our</text>
  <text start="644.07" dur="4.92">armed forces who were at this football</text>
  <text start="646.41" dur="3.5">game Army Navy were somehow associated</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="3.1">with a white</text>
  <text start="649.91" dur="5.19">power because they use the okay sign</text>
  <text start="652.09" dur="4.75">because somehow I guess in some crazy</text>
  <text start="655.1" dur="3.66">people&amp;#39;s world that means white power</text>
  <text start="656.84" dur="3.84">but in a lot of people&amp;#39;s world that just</text>
  <text start="658.76" dur="3.42">means okay and in this particular</text>
  <text start="660.68" dur="3.96">instance it was something called the</text>
  <text start="662.18" dur="5.43">circle game which it&amp;#39;s was made popular</text>
  <text start="664.64" dur="5.94">probably in the early 2000s or late 90s</text>
  <text start="667.61" dur="4.38">by a few i think it was malcolm in the</text>
  <text start="670.58" dur="3">middle&amp;#39; was one of the shows where they</text>
  <text start="671.99" dur="3.54">started with it but anyway you get</text>
  <text start="673.58" dur="3.51">somebody to look at a circle and it can</text>
  <text start="675.53" dur="3.36">be anywhere maybe sometimes it&amp;#39;s gotta</text>
  <text start="677.09" dur="3.57">be below your waist whatever if they</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="4.44">look at it then it&amp;#39;s like a punch buggy</text>
  <text start="680.66" dur="4.35">you know you see a bug Volkswagen bug</text>
  <text start="683.33" dur="3.9">you say punch buggy punch your brother</text>
  <text start="685.01" dur="5.1">sister whatever it&amp;#39;s the same concept</text>
  <text start="687.23" dur="7.5">you get a look at it I got you you know</text>
  <text start="690.11" dur="6.93">now you look like a fool so I really do</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="5.25">think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a complete joke but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.04" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s indicative of where we&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="699.98" dur="8.36">as a society with the news being so fake</text>
  <text start="702.38" dur="8.4">and misleading and just a complete waste</text>
  <text start="708.34" dur="3.97">of everyone&amp;#39;s time really I mean nobody</text>
  <text start="710.78" dur="3.6">nobody needs to watch this stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="712.31" dur="5.07">all about indoctrination narrative</text>
  <text start="714.38" dur="4.92">control and controlling the masses and</text>
  <text start="717.38" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot of okay sick books in</text>
  <text start="719.3" dur="3.57">the and it&amp;#39;s so funny because yeah</text>
  <text start="721.25" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s one of the emojis right means</text>
  <text start="722.87" dur="5.88">okay it&amp;#39;s a circle game I&amp;#39;ve never used</text>
  <text start="726.68" dur="3.66">it to mean white power I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="728.75" dur="3.45">anybody who would use it to mean that</text>
  <text start="730.34" dur="4.23">and I think it&amp;#39;s disgusting that they</text>
  <text start="732.2" dur="5.13">tried to put that on our good men and</text>
  <text start="734.57" dur="4.56">women in in the armed forces who are</text>
  <text start="737.33" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re just trying to enjoy themselves</text>
  <text start="739.13" dur="5.43">so this is something I thought was</text>
  <text start="741.89" dur="8.25">really interesting just to cover that</text>
  <text start="744.56" dur="6.84">briefly so let&amp;#39;s look at the chat let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.14" dur="4.17">see how everybody&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="751.4" dur="4.86">like I said hun of okay symbols you know</text>
  <text start="754.31" dur="4.11">people are making kind of jokes about it</text>
  <text start="756.26" dur="4.17">all again if you have any questions you</text>
  <text start="758.42" dur="4.5">can super chat or just put them in the</text>
  <text start="760.43" dur="3.84">chat if they&amp;#39;re just in the chat and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="762.92" dur="3.48">sure we&amp;#39;ll be able to get to each and</text>
  <text start="764.27" dur="3.81">every one of them but I&amp;#39;ll definitely</text>
  <text start="766.4" dur="3.9">get to all the super chats if you guys</text>
  <text start="768.08" dur="5.58">can do that I&amp;#39;d help out the channel</text>
  <text start="770.3" dur="7.11">immensely so with that in mind let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="773.66" dur="5.76">here to the next basically this is funny</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="4.44">because the AP comes out with this story</text>
  <text start="779.42" dur="3.1">saying that the Russian President</text>
  <text start="781.85" dur="2.44">Vladimir Putin</text>
  <text start="782.52" dur="4.11">says that president Trump&amp;#39;s impeachment</text>
  <text start="784.29" dur="3.84">is a far-fetched or is far-fetched it</text>
  <text start="786.63" dur="4.38">predicts the US Senate will reject it</text>
  <text start="788.13" dur="5.52">well no kidding right that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="791.01" dur="5.1">this reminds me of how fake the news is</text>
  <text start="793.65" dur="5.52">in the sense that you know remember when</text>
  <text start="796.11" dur="5.73">they told us basically that you know a</text>
  <text start="799.17" dur="4.8">large or Papadopoulos heard that Hillary</text>
  <text start="801.84" dur="3.63">Clinton had emails and you&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="803.97" dur="3.45">thinking to yourself well that was like</text>
  <text start="805.47" dur="3.21">being reported on Fox News that there</text>
  <text start="807.42" dur="3.21">were emails that were hacked by the</text>
  <text start="808.68" dur="4.11">Russians or certain hackers that were</text>
  <text start="810.63" dur="5.01">about to be put out right but then they</text>
  <text start="812.79" dur="5.42">went and said oh whoa you know Joseph</text>
  <text start="815.64" dur="5.25">Smith&amp;#39;s under or Alexander Downer told</text>
  <text start="818.21" dur="4.66">George papadopolis and that was what</text>
  <text start="820.89" dur="3.93">sparked the whole investigation no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="822.87" dur="4.38">just another attempt at them to take</text>
  <text start="824.82" dur="4.8">what we all know is common sense fact</text>
  <text start="827.25" dur="3.78">right that the Senate is going to reject</text>
  <text start="829.62" dur="2.94">this because it&amp;#39;s an impeachment for</text>
  <text start="831.03" dur="4.71">nothing other than the fact that they</text>
  <text start="832.56" dur="5.46">hate our president and they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="835.74" dur="4.01">to spin it as oh well Vladimir Putin</text>
  <text start="838.02" dur="5.13">agrees with President Trump therefore</text>
  <text start="839.75" dur="5.89">he&amp;#39;s evil it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense it</text>
  <text start="843.15" dur="3.9">doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t pass the shoe on the</text>
  <text start="845.64" dur="3.24">other foot test or whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="847.05" dur="3.18">call it and it&amp;#39;s just another example to</text>
  <text start="848.88" dur="2.82">fake news and that&amp;#39;s why I wanted to</text>
  <text start="850.23" dur="3.9">highlight it because President Trump was</text>
  <text start="851.7" dur="4.53">pointing right at it which I thought was</text>
  <text start="854.13" dur="4.44">fairly hilarious saying a total of</text>
  <text start="856.23" dur="5.04">witch-hunt so it&amp;#39;s just more examples of</text>
  <text start="858.57" dur="6.96">their witch-hunt because the fact that</text>
  <text start="861.27" dur="8.49">um President Trump agrees with this is</text>
  <text start="865.53" dur="7.02">is again I heard that excuse me that lot</text>
  <text start="869.76" dur="4.92">of Putin agrees is some major crime I</text>
  <text start="872.55" dur="6.66">guess because they agree with what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.68" dur="6.12">factually logical to put forth now that</text>
  <text start="879.21" dur="3.24">are super chat thank you for the super</text>

  <text start="1471.39" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m saying what I&amp;#39;m saying is most</text>
  <text start="1473.55" dur="3.9">police forces in the country have high</text>
  <text start="1475.23" dur="3.78">number of vacancies and as the job gets</text>

  <text start="1481.02" dur="4.08">in the jurisdiction are not supporting</text>
  <text start="1482.94" dur="3.63">them they either can stop being police</text>
  <text start="1485.1" dur="4.53">or they can move to a jurisdiction</text>
  <text start="1486.57" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s more hospitable and I think that</text>
  <text start="1489.63" dur="3.87">you know we could find ourselves in the</text>
  <text start="1492.12" dur="3.03">position that if we don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1493.5" dur="3.84">communities that aren&amp;#39;t supporting the</text>
  <text start="1495.15" dur="6.21">police may not get the the police</text>
  <text start="1497.34" dur="5.94">protection they need charged the so</text>
  <text start="1501.36" dur="5.52">there you heard I mean obviously that</text>
  <text start="1503.28" dur="4.89">was a general bar talking about exactly</text>
  <text start="1506.88" dur="4.47">what we&amp;#39;re talking about here right now</text>
  <text start="1508.17" dur="5.79">right talking about George Soros and the</text>

  <text start="1519.48" dur="3.48">people it&amp;#39;s all part of a consolidated</text>
  <text start="1521.52" dur="2.85">effort to undermine our criminal justice</text>
  <text start="1522.96" dur="4.56">system and what he&amp;#39;s saying there</text>
  <text start="1524.37" dur="5.4">ultimately is it&amp;#39;s not saying that you</text>
  <text start="1527.52" dur="5.19">know treating the police bad is gonna</text>
  <text start="1529.77" dur="4.56">you know drive the police out as much as</text>
  <text start="1532.71" dur="3">it is just saying I mean though it is</text>
  <text start="1534.33" dur="4.05">basically saying that but it&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1535.71" dur="4.65">that like he said there there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1538.38" dur="3.9">active effort to undermine the</text>
  <text start="1540.36" dur="3.39">relationship between the citizenry and</text>
  <text start="1542.28" dur="3.81">police and that is that is what we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1582.7" dur="3.569">this before too</text>
  <text start="1583.899" dur="6.21">I think what the premise is this is that</text>
  <text start="1586.269" dur="5.64">if the impeachment fails in his first</text>
  <text start="1590.109" dur="4.081">term Sophie&amp;#39;s impeached and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1596.889" dur="5.61">a constitutional statute that clarifies</text>
  <text start="1599.379" dur="5.071">this but a lot of people are saying that</text>
  <text start="1602.499" dur="4.56">that actually invalidates his first term</text>
  <text start="1604.45" dur="5.729">in the sense that it makes him eligible</text>
  <text start="1607.059" dur="4.95">for a second term on top of the other</text>
  <text start="1610.179" dur="3.42">term be he&amp;#39;s going to get so yes he</text>
  <text start="1612.009" dur="2.67">could possibly have eight years I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1613.599" dur="4.231">gonna have to get into fact-checking</text>
