  <text start="174.03" dur="5.429">anyway this is a real breaking story</text>
  <text start="177.329" dur="6.151">coming out of creative destruction media</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="7.831">which is still in the cycle of being</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="6.179">verified I believe so this is a former</text>
  <text start="187.29" dur="4.68">Republican Arkansas State Senator</text>

  <text start="191.97" dur="4.17">it was found murdered home Marie this</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="4.23">too because it&amp;#39;s really quick this week</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="4.319">in Pocahontas Arkansas believed she was</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="4.559">closing in on a child trafficking ring</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="4.65">working from within the Arkansas state</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="5.101">government a verified source close to</text>
  <text start="205.109" dur="4.861">Colin Smith told CD media that she was</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="3.84">about to go public with incriminating</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="4.139">information on sitting judges in</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="4.41">Arkansas who were involved in taking</text>

  <text start="219.66" dur="4.68">selling them to wealthy individuals the</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="4.051">source also disclosed that Colin Smith</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="3.959">believed the perpetrators were using</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="4.05">illegal aliens to facilitate the crimes</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="4.08">which included murdering the mothers of</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="5.31">the stolen children and another</text>
  <text start="232.379" dur="5.64">anonymous twist our ominous twist to the</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="4.199">story former Oklahoma State Senator John</text>
  <text start="238.019" dur="3.87">Jonathan Nichols was found murdered in</text>
  <text start="239.849" dur="3.39">his home in Norman Oklahoma yesterday</text>
  <text start="241.889" dur="4.261">our source believes the two murders are</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="4.47">connected and they just go on to say</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="3.929">they have more reporting to do and yes</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="6.39">they do I want to make it very clear</text>
  <text start="250.079" dur="6.301">this is a first report that is coming</text>
  <text start="254.099" dur="5.25">out of a news organization who claims to</text>
  <text start="256.38" dur="8.46">have a verified source close to Colin</text>
  <text start="259.349" dur="7.941">Smith the deceased state senator so this</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="5.12">is really really kind of first</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="4.8">and this is kind of like the first</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="5.07">report of the first report so you have</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="6">to remember that this information still</text>
  <text start="275.03" dur="5.13">has to be verified but with that in mind</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="3.87">you can kind of read through this and</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="3.93">and maybe you can start to attribute</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="5.16">some kind of motive to what happened</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="4.44">here I mean it really is incredible to</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="3.21">think of like our report in the last</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="4.2">video if you guys didn&amp;#39;t watch it go</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="3.69">watch it this video right here the last</text>
  <text start="292.73" dur="3.39">one I put up talking about the strange</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="4.29">deaths because what we talked about was</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="4.65">the fact that you had two state senators</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="4.68">you had a Oklahoma State Senator and a</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="5.76">Arkansas state senator who were shot to</text>
  <text start="302.99" dur="5.52">death inside of their homes that</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="4.53">happened within two days of one another</text>
  <text start="308.51" dur="4.41">one day I guess hours of one another if</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="4.77">you will and of course the same thing</text>
  <text start="312.92" dur="6.09">happened in New York where - NYPD</text>
  <text start="315.83" dur="4.71">veterans committed suicide within hours</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="5.4">of one another one happened to be a</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="7.73">chief in the department and the other</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="7.68">happened to be a veteran detective so</text>
  <text start="328.27" dur="5.2">this was interesting and when you put</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="3.03">all of it together you think ok well</text>
  <text start="333.47" dur="3.44">what&amp;#39;s going on here and then you have</text>
  <text start="335.12" dur="5.19">this report coming out talking about</text>
  <text start="336.91" dur="6.4">what is the possible motive for somebody</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="5.7">to have taken this wonderful young</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="5.01">woman&amp;#39;s life it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s tragedy thoughts</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="5.85">and prayers with her and her family and</text>
  <text start="348.32" dur="5.79">everyone else who&amp;#39;s left us now and you</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="3.78">know look I only report on this because</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s the news and it has to get out</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="4.77">there and it&amp;#39;s the it&amp;#39;s just the reports</text>
  <text start="358.91" dur="2.9">that are coming in we&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="4.14">discussion here we&amp;#39;re asking questions</text>
  <text start="361.81" dur="4.96">so I thought I&amp;#39;d bring this story to you</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="4.11">and of course if we go back to what Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="3.6">been telling us the one thing you have</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="5.28">to remember here is everything we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="6.03">heard about Epstein Island this is a big</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="6.02">part of what Q is dropped Q dropped the</text>
  <text start="376.4" dur="8.4">fact that there were some pretty bad</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="6.73">occult things going on at this this</text>
  <text start="384.8" dur="3.66">island so the island is little st. James</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s in the Caribbean it was owned by</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="5.46">this billionaire Jeffrey Epstein and a</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="4.41">lot of people have alleged that the</text>
  <text start="393.92" dur="4.08">island itself was used by Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="3.33">Epstein as some sort of honey trap which</text>
  <text start="398" dur="3.03">if you don&amp;#39;t know what that is you can</text>
  <text start="399.2" dur="5.44">google it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.03" dur="9.61">probably don&amp;#39;t google it but it&amp;#39;s it was</text>
  <text start="404.64" dur="8.51">basically an operation to get blackmail</text>
  <text start="410.64" dur="4.47">information or get blackmail evidence on</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="5.7">high-ranking individuals including</text>
  <text start="415.11" dur="6.96">politicians celebrities you name it and</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="4.96">this picture here the what really stands</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="3.39">out to me first of all is if you guys</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="4.08">have heard in the news lately there were</text>
  <text start="425.46" dur="5.58">these mysterious deaths in the Dominican</text>
  <text start="427.89" dur="6.78">Republic of these tourists who just</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="5.61">happened to in one case a woman took a</text>
  <text start="434.67" dur="4.59">drank from a minibar and died install</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="6.45">most instantaneously and in another case</text>
  <text start="439.26" dur="6.15">there was a couple who died of basically</text>
  <text start="443.1" dur="6.21">you know it was some sort of heart</text>
  <text start="445.41" dur="5.91">failure from ex-fix iation threw water</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="5.34">on the lungs and they died at the same</text>
  <text start="451.32" dur="5.07">time which is like statistically almost</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="3.96">impossible for two people laying in a</text>
  <text start="456.39" dur="3.09">bed to die from drowning at the exact</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="5.34">same time</text>
  <text start="459.48" dur="6.12">Oryx fixie ation or whatever and what I</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="4.35">thought was interesting though is that</text>
  <text start="465.6" dur="5.28">the one instance I believe the the one</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="5.13">woman who died almost immediately it was</text>
  <text start="470.88" dur="4.11">in Punta Cana which is in the Dominican</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="3.9">Republic which just so happens to be</text>
  <text start="474.99" dur="4.679">right where this picture is taken with</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="3.75">Clinton and people have made the</text>
  <text start="479.669" dur="3.691">allegation that one of the people in</text>
  <text start="481.08" dur="5.21">this photo was the individual who has</text>
  <text start="483.36" dur="7.4">just picked up and arrested for a child</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="7.3">some sort of child exploitation and</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="4.54">Jorge nadir but this is not I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="493.59" dur="4.56">think George a nadir but this is Bill</text>
  <text start="495.3" dur="5.46">Clinton and they are in I believe Punta</text>
  <text start="498.15" dur="4.26">Cana in the Dominican Republic but</text>
  <text start="500.76" dur="2.85">that&amp;#39;s not really why I&amp;#39;m showing you</text>
  <text start="502.41" dur="4.56">this I&amp;#39;m showing you this because of</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="5.76">this post here so there&amp;#39;s a story behind</text>
  <text start="506.97" dur="5.61">all of this apparent like the post here</text>
  <text start="509.37" dur="5.19">that Q is pointing us to is a picture</text>
  <text start="512.58" dur="5.67">that was shared on I believe it was Ray</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="8.31">Chandler&amp;#39;s instant or was an Instagram</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="6.89">or snapchat or probably Instagram but it</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="5.969">was a picture of security cameras in</text>
  <text start="525.14" dur="4.39">some sort of facility and a lot of</text>
  <text start="528.839" dur="2.371">Anton&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="531.21" dur="5.16">here just you</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="5.13">because if you guys won&amp;#39;t really want to</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="4.77">find it I&amp;#39;m sure you can but it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="4.38">picture of somebody standing behind a</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="3.57">security station where they have</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="4.91">multiple monitors set up that have</text>
  <text start="544.71" dur="5.58">multiple different live presumably</text>
  <text start="547.4" dur="4.95">security camera feeds and you can tell</text>
  <text start="550.29" dur="4.92">that wherever this is there&amp;#39;s about six</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="5.59">camera feeds you can see and of those</text>
  <text start="555.21" dur="4.95">six you can see that it&amp;#39;s dark you can</text>
  <text start="557.94" dur="4.26">see that it&amp;#39;s obviously somewhere that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="5.34">probably either underground or doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="4.59">have any windows and you can see a lot</text>
  <text start="565.5" dur="3.23">of the Anton&amp;#39;s have broken down that</text>
  <text start="566.79" dur="4.59">picture even further to show that</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="4.63">there&amp;#39;s just really really weird stuff</text>
  <text start="571.38" dur="6.3">going on like possibly a bunch of kids</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="6.87">sitting around in a dark dark room just</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="4.5">really sick stuff and that&amp;#39;s why I think</text>

  <text start="1221.769" dur="2.97">would go all the way up to twenty five</text>
  <text start="1222.85" dur="4.49">percent and when they heard that they</text>
  <text start="1224.739" dur="4.711">could be facing a twenty five percent</text>
  <text start="1227.34" dur="3.64">tariff and they look at what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1229.45" dur="3.689">with China and how we&amp;#39;re not afraid to</text>
  <text start="1230.98" dur="4.259">use those tariffs I&amp;#39;m sure they went</text>
  <text start="1233.139" dur="4.98">like oh man that would destroy our</text>

  <text start="1437.2" dur="5.04">greater when we talk about God&amp;#39;s grace</text>
  <text start="1439.12" dur="5.309">and how it is truly greater for today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1442.24" dur="4.049">episode I want to bring you a really</text>
  <text start="1444.429" dur="4.181">short verse but I think it says a lot</text>
  <text start="1446.289" dur="5.331">and</text>
  <text start="1448.61" dur="4.93">this is from Proverbs it&amp;#39;s chapter 11</text>
  <text start="1451.62" dur="4.65">verse 2 and I just want to share it</text>
  <text start="1453.54" dur="6.47">it says when pride comes disgrace</text>
  <text start="1456.27" dur="8.13">follows but with humility comes wisdom</text>
  <text start="1460.01" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s simple that&amp;#39;s it but it</text>
  <text start="1464.4" dur="5.64">means so much to me</text>
  <text start="1466.4" dur="8.49">when pride comes disgrace follows so</text>
  <text start="1470.04" dur="8.46">it&amp;#39;s a sin to be prideful and for me</text>
  <text start="1474.89" dur="6.22">that&amp;#39;s why my prayer everyday I ask God</text>
  <text start="1478.5" dur="5.34">this one thing every day and it says it</text>
  <text start="1481.11" dur="6">right here I ask God for humility</text>
  <text start="1483.84" dur="6.45">because it says but with humility comes</text>
  <text start="1487.11" dur="3.72">wisdom and why do I ask God for me for</text>
  <text start="1490.29" dur="2.25">humility</text>
  <text start="1490.83" dur="5.55">what is humility some of you might not</text>
  <text start="1492.54" dur="5.79">even know and I know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="1496.38" dur="5.04">those things but humility is is</text>
  <text start="1498.33" dur="4.98">basically being humble it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1501.42" dur="4.56">acknowledging that you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1503.31" dur="6.09">everything so having the humility to</text>
  <text start="1505.98" dur="6.09">accept the things that you you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1509.4" dur="4.86">know but humility before God is even</text>
  <text start="1512.07" dur="5.52">more important because what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1514.26" dur="5.7">saying is God I don&amp;#39;t have all power I</text>
