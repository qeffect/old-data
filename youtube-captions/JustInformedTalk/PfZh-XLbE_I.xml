  <text start="169.09" dur="7.14">multiple live streams from the event at</text>

  <text start="182.95" dur="7.74">just to give you a quick rundown of that</text>
  <text start="185.62" dur="6.63">the networks were so over worked I guess</text>

  <text start="236.53" dur="4.739">social media and get the word out that</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="6.919">way as well so today this is the newest</text>
  <text start="241.269" dur="6.301">latest biggest story this is a massive</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="5.831">7.1 earthquake that&amp;#39;s rocked Southern</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="5.91">California and this apparently is near</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="5.939">Los Angeles and it&amp;#39;s been felt I believe</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="5.729">by people in that area and this is not</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="6.571">just a isolated incident there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="5.611">an incredible string of earthquakes that</text>
  <text start="263.05" dur="2.76">have been happening in rapid succession</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="3.99">over the</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="5.01">past few days I believe and here&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="5.64">idea of it this is a map that kind of</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="6.36">shows you how many have happened in the</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="5.43">last 10 days and how you know how</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="4.68">frequent they continue to come so I</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="5.67">believe here&amp;#39;s the main one this was the</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="5.88">7.1 now this is near I don&amp;#39;t know this</text>
  <text start="285.55" dur="4.05">map has all the exact these are the the</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="5.97">more local cities but I believe this is</text>
  <text start="289.6" dur="7.01">more near Bakersfield and then it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="4.8">on the other side from where LA is and</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="4.21">Ridgecrest is really one of the big</text>
  <text start="298.51" dur="4.89">places that&amp;#39;s getting affected very</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="4.23">strongly by this and you can see here</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="5.6">you know you&amp;#39;re having these swarms of</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="6.119">earthquakes so this is a pretty big</text>
  <text start="309" dur="4.389">piece of news that we&amp;#39;re going to keep</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="3.931">an eye on because as we all know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.389" dur="4.441">a few things that you have to take into</text>
  <text start="315.1" dur="5.19">account when you think about California</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="3.839">and earthquakes and the first thing that</text>
  <text start="320.29" dur="5.129">comes to mind obviously is the San</text>
  <text start="321.669" dur="5.581">Andreas Fault and how scientists have</text>
  <text start="325.419" dur="6.301">been predicting for quite some time that</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="7.53">they are expecting a much bigger seismic</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="5.73">event than these smaller ones even</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="5.34">though esata 7.1 is a quite a large one</text>
  <text start="337.45" dur="5.19">and I&amp;#39;ve read comments about this</text>
  <text start="340.12" dur="4.56">earthquake from people who live near the</text>
  <text start="342.64" dur="4.44">area there who say that they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="3.87">they like I saw one person right they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="4.2">lived there for 50 years</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="4.89">and I&amp;#39;ve never felt that kind of</text>
  <text start="351.28" dur="4.32">earthquake happened now of course that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.44" dur="4.38">a little anecdotal but it does give you</text>
  <text start="355.6" dur="3.93">an idea of the scale of this and how</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="3.63">people are really taking this seriously</text>
  <text start="359.53" dur="4.47">so if you&amp;#39;re in one of these affected</text>
  <text start="361.45" dur="5.82">areas my best advice to you is just</text>
  <text start="364" dur="6">follow the the warnings and advisories</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="6.6">from the local authorities and really do</text>
  <text start="370" dur="5.729">your best to move to somewhere where</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="4.919">there&amp;#39;s not earthquakes if you&amp;#39;re at all</text>
  <text start="375.729" dur="4.981">able to do that but if you&amp;#39;re not then I</text>
  <text start="378.789" dur="5.451">don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know much about</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="6.9">earthquakes so I build a strong house</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="6.399">yeah that&amp;#39;s probably terrible advice but</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="4.44">I hope you uh I hope you really are safe</text>
  <text start="390.639" dur="3.661">I&amp;#39;m praying for each and every one of</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="4.83">you out there who are affected by this</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="3.9">because it is a serious issue and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="2.51">gonna keep an eye on the story who knows</text>
  <text start="398.2" dur="5.21">what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot to be said for the</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="3.96">effect these earthquakes are going to</text>
  <text start="404.7" dur="5.82">end up having if they continue at this</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="5.79">rate and pace this is gonna be building</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="4.11">into some much a much larger movement</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="5.19">which would be very devastating for the</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="6.09">people of California so one thing I</text>
  <text start="418.35" dur="4.08">remember is you know we look at the cue</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="4.5">boards and we remember what what</text>
  <text start="422.43" dur="5.31">everyone keeps telling us cue gives us</text>
  <text start="425.22" dur="4.65">all these pictures and when we talk</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="4.44">about California we have to remember</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="5.94">that there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot going on</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="6.09">there from the mysterious fires that</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="4.14">just ravaged that state recently and</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="5.07">burned down entire neighborhoods</text>
  <text start="439.95" dur="6.66">basically cleared out you know and huge</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="4.98">blocks of cities and then all the way up</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="5.31">to what Q&amp;#39;s told us about the Long Beach</text>
  <text start="448.32" dur="5.67">port and how it&amp;#39;s being used for</text>
  <text start="451.92" dur="3.6">nefarious reasons there was a story that</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="4.29">came out recently that I reported on</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="5.64">here in the channel or President Trump</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="7.56">through his homeland security had issued</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="7.17">a ruling that the Chinese had to sell</text>
  <text start="465.84" dur="5.97">their interest in the Port of Long Beach</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="5.13">now this is not a coincidence we talk</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="3.3">about things here on the q board that</text>
  <text start="473.46" dur="3.33">could be happening but we do know this</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="3.15">happens every day there&amp;#39;s drug</text>
  <text start="476.79" dur="3.24">trafficking and human trafficking</text>
  <text start="478.26" dur="5.46">especially sex trafficking as far as</text>
  <text start="480.03" dur="8.87">humans go and that&amp;#39;s really what this is</text>
  <text start="483.72" dur="9.57">all about I think is shutting down those</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="6.49">illegal black-market avenues and you</text>
  <text start="493.29" dur="4.65">told us back then first and 10 on the 40</text>
  <text start="495.39" dur="4.83">gave us this picture of the Long Beach</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="4.77">port and of course gave us this tweet</text>
  <text start="500.22" dur="4.92">from Sarah a Carter who says latest</text>
  <text start="502.71" dur="5.64">Muller&amp;#39;s report ends witch hunt but what</text>
  <text start="505.14" dur="5.7">about what&amp;#39;s about to unfold is the real</text>
  <text start="508.35" dur="5.1">story what will unfold is the</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="3.87">investigation historians will consider</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="4.2">one of the greatest political witch</text>
  <text start="514.71" dur="5.01">hunts in US history and of course this</text>
  <text start="517.65" dur="5.87">is writing about what bar is gonna end</text>
  <text start="519.72" dur="6.36">up unfolding through Muller&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="523.52" dur="4.33">about the fights abuse about how they</text>

  <text start="530.85" dur="3.789">from office this is</text>
  <text start="532.029" dur="4.531">not a game and these Democrats realize</text>
  <text start="534.639" dur="4.041">that they&amp;#39;re playing for everything they</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="5.85">have it&amp;#39;s their lives are on the line</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="6.37">both well let&amp;#39;s put it this way they</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="4.739">their political lives at minimum are</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="4.26">certainly on the line and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.149" dur="6.511">speculate on the other but I will say</text>
  <text start="549.31" dur="6.029">this that it is incredibly telling that</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ve had this information and we know</text>
  <text start="555.339" dur="4.17">to look at California and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="557.23" dur="5.099">necessarily connecting those two instant</text>
  <text start="559.509" dur="4.291">incidents but because this incident did</text>
  <text start="562.329" dur="3.031">happen in California I would like to</text>
  <text start="563.8" dur="4.289">write that&amp;#39;s why I chose to reiterate</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="8.849">this story because I&amp;#39;ve been told by my</text>
  <text start="568.089" dur="10.411">sources who I have you know been given</text>
  <text start="574.209" dur="7.591">little pieces here and there that la is</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="6.75">the touchdown la is gonna basically show</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="4.979">us and when we look back after this is</text>
  <text start="585.25" dur="3.66">all said and done it was gonna it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.779" dur="3.781">gonna be one of the main hubs for the</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="5.34">things that we&amp;#39;ve been fighting here</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="7.009">every day on this through this movement</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="6.449">with President Trump for our country and</text>
  <text start="597.569" dur="5.591">obviously in in my case and probably</text>
  <text start="600.699" dur="6.06">your case if you&amp;#39;re here most</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="5.099">importantly for God against evil so that</text>
  <text start="606.759" dur="4.471">this is really an important story</text>
  <text start="608.259" dur="4.83">obviously so another story I want to</text>

  <text start="618.04" dur="3.39">beginning of this video the little clip</text>
  <text start="619.569" dur="4.171">of President Trump II was saying that</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="4.92">something happened in New Hampshire and</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s why BP Mike Pence had to cancel</text>
  <text start="626.35" dur="4.77">his flight and turn around and come back</text>
  <text start="627.879" dur="4.83">to the White House on Tuesday and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="3.329">not sure what&amp;#39;s gonna come out with</text>
  <text start="632.709" dur="4.651">President Trump says the truth will come</text>
  <text start="634.449" dur="6.271">out in two weeks about this now I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="4.829">as somebody who&amp;#39;s been examining these</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="3.69">things for quite some time I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="642.189" dur="4.65">quite convinced with that answer but you</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="4.619">know to each their own when I guess at</text>
  <text start="646.839" dur="3.661">this point what this might connect back</text>
  <text start="649.029" dur="3.571">to is a story I want you guys if you</text>
  <text start="650.5" dur="4.74">want go watch this story here we had</text>
  <text start="652.6" dur="5.25">speculative reports a few days ago about</text>
  <text start="655.24" dur="4.89">a u.s. submarine that may have been sunk</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="4.829">off the coast of Alaska this coincided</text>
  <text start="660.13" dur="4.14">with a story of a Russian submarine that</text>
  <text start="662.679" dur="5.551">was heavily damaged and</text>
  <text start="664.27" dur="6.45">14 members of the crew were killed this</text>
  <text start="668.23" dur="7.89">was made public but there were</text>
  <text start="670.72" dur="6.99">speculative stories that were happening</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="5.58">from different people behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="677.71" dur="5.4">who were saying publicly including as I</text>
  <text start="681.7" dur="3.63">mentioned in my last video Hal Turner</text>
  <text start="683.11" dur="5.42">that there was the possibility that a</text>
  <text start="685.33" dur="6.18">u.s. submarine had been sunk in a</text>
  <text start="688.53" dur="6.07">skirmish that happened in US waters</text>
  <text start="691.51" dur="5.34">where a u.s. sub found the Russian sub</text>
  <text start="694.6" dur="5.82">inside of our territorial waters and</text>
  <text start="696.85" dur="9.3">when they engaged them they may have in</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="8.49">fact suffered a tragic loss but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="706.15" dur="7.32">know that that&amp;#39;s still in the air the</text>
  <text start="708.91" dur="5.94">Pentagon sources for the Hal Turner who</text>
  <text start="713.47" dur="3.15">was reporting this have neither</text>
  <text start="714.85" dur="2.97">confirmed nor denied it but you should</text>
  <text start="716.62" dur="2.43">watch this video if you want to get more</text>
  <text start="717.82" dur="3.54">information on that because that&amp;#39;ll help</text>
  <text start="719.05" dur="7.08">you kind of catch up to where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="721.36" dur="7.25">and why this story matters and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="726.13" dur="4.44">know what happened in New Hampshire but</text>
  <text start="728.61" dur="4.27">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see what that</text>
  <text start="730.57" dur="4.59">sounds like here&amp;#39;s another story so you</text>
  <text start="732.88" dur="4.47">know we&amp;#39;ve talked about Puerto Rico a</text>
  <text start="735.16" dur="5.55">little bit here president Trump has had</text>
  <text start="737.35" dur="4.02">a lot to say about Puerto Rico Puerto</text>
  <text start="740.71" dur="2.97">Rico</text>
  <text start="741.37" dur="5.01">of course suffered an incredible tragedy</text>
  <text start="743.68" dur="6.18">with the hurricane but then it was just</text>
  <text start="746.38" dur="6.33">complete circus afterwards where they</text>
  <text start="749.86" dur="4.85">were trying to figure out how to rebuild</text>
  <text start="752.71" dur="4.83">they were trying to figure out how to</text>
  <text start="754.71" dur="5.04">provide aid they were trying to figure</text>
  <text start="757.54" dur="4.8">out how to help people and the</text>
  <text start="759.75" dur="5.29">government of Puerto Rico did not seem</text>
  <text start="762.34" dur="4.56">to be very or the local government in</text>
  <text start="765.04" dur="4.53">Puerto Rico did not seem to be very</text>
  <text start="766.9" dur="4.71">helpful toward the president which</text>
  <text start="769.57" dur="4.79">caused a lot of issues and we ended up</text>
  <text start="771.61" dur="5.55">giving them I think we gave them more</text>
  <text start="774.36" dur="4.93">more money and aid than we have like</text>
  <text start="777.16" dur="5.52">pretty much for any other recent</text>
  <text start="779.29" dur="5.73">disaster so we&amp;#39;re talking abili ins</text>
  <text start="782.68" dur="4.74">billions of dollars which they&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="785.02" dur="4.53">to basically rebuild parts of their</text>
  <text start="787.42" dur="4.2">power infrastructure but it there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="789.55" dur="4.53">lot of waste fraud and abuse that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="791.62" dur="4.659">being alleged to be happening down there</text>
  <text start="794.08" dur="4.66">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of tampering and</text>
  <text start="796.279" dur="8.31">distorting the actual numbers as far as</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="10.079">the needs and the also you know people</text>
  <text start="804.589" dur="7.05">have made common people have pointed out</text>
  <text start="808.819" dur="4.591">that the numbers from the earthquake or</text>
  <text start="811.639" dur="3.69">excuse me the hurricane as far as</text>
  <text start="813.41" dur="5.52">casualties go may have been inflated now</text>
  <text start="815.329" dur="5.94">why do I say that well because you</text>
  <text start="818.93" dur="3.75">really can&amp;#39;t do what they were trying to</text>
  <text start="821.269" dur="4.11">do I believe they were trying to count</text>
  <text start="822.68" dur="5.009">that people who just happened to pass</text>
  <text start="825.379" dur="4.591">away after the hurricane were a casualty</text>
  <text start="827.689" dur="3.661">of the hurricane now in some cases yes</text>
  <text start="829.97" dur="3.179">they could have been severely affected</text>
  <text start="831.35" dur="4.289">in lost their lives due to that</text>
  <text start="833.149" dur="5.221">hurricane specifically but in a lot of</text>
  <text start="835.639" dur="4.531">other cases you can&amp;#39;t just start saying</text>
  <text start="838.37" dur="3.36">that every single person who dies after</text>
  <text start="840.17" dur="3.3">a hurricane is a casualty of the</text>
  <text start="841.73" dur="4.289">hurricane trying to get more federal</text>
  <text start="843.47" dur="3.989">money that&amp;#39;s what the argument was being</text>
  <text start="846.019" dur="2.49">that&amp;#39;s the argument that was being made</text>
  <text start="847.459" dur="2.85">so I thought that was something</text>
  <text start="848.509" dur="5.52">interesting to point out and the FBI</text>
  <text start="850.309" dur="6.5">here as I&amp;#39;m pointing out is executing a</text>
  <text start="854.029" dur="6.12">search warrant against a primary bank in</text>
  <text start="856.809" dur="7.26">Puerto Rico wouldn&amp;#39;t you know this South</text>
  <text start="860.149" dur="5.94">Bay so the FBI says that they have</text>
  <text start="864.069" dur="4.421">executes a search warrant at the offices</text>
  <text start="866.089" dur="4.261">of South Bank International issued based</text>
  <text start="868.49" dur="4.589">on probable cause for the following</text>
  <text start="870.35" dur="4.83">federal law violations conspiracy to</text>
  <text start="873.079" dur="3.891">defraud the United States Department of</text>
  <text start="875.18" dur="4.019">Treasury wire fraud money laundering</text>
  <text start="876.97" dur="4.75">violations domestic and international</text>
  <text start="879.199" dur="6.75">failure to file suspicious activity</text>
  <text start="881.72" dur="6.69">reports so these could be related to</text>
  <text start="885.949" dur="4.08">something to the way that they receive</text>
  <text start="888.41" dur="3.96">funds from the government if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="890.029" dur="3.66">defrauding the United States Department</text>
  <text start="892.37" dur="3.949">of Treasury that means that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="893.689" dur="5.07">obviously falsifying information and</text>
  <text start="896.319" dur="4.33">misleading them into providing you with</text>
  <text start="898.759" dur="4.02">more funding that&amp;#39;s what this whole</text>
  <text start="900.649" dur="4.25">story is about and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="902.779" dur="4.23">and see what happens there</text>
  <text start="904.899" dur="4.24">here&amp;#39;s another story I thought was</text>
  <text start="907.009" dur="3.781">interesting that Nate Kane one of the</text>
  <text start="909.139" dur="4.32">Patriots who obviously is a</text>
  <text start="910.79" dur="6.239">whistleblower who we keep a good bright</text>

  <text start="1085.28" dur="5.79">hey John Podesta how about you tell us</text>
  <text start="1088.55" dur="4.82">about the time you wrote in in WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="1091.07" dur="5.55">about wet works at the vineyard and</text>
  <text start="1093.37" dur="6.34">shortly after only four days after you</text>
  <text start="1096.62" dur="7.29">wrote this we find that justice Chief</text>

  <text start="1103.91" dur="5.31">the Chipola Creek Ranch in Shafter Texas</text>
  <text start="1107.179" dur="3.931">could you tell us about this because</text>
  <text start="1109.22" dur="4.2">this graphic is very interesting it puts</text>
  <text start="1111.11" dur="5.819">a lot together here so what you see here</text>
  <text start="1113.42" dur="5.52">is the story itself Justice Scalia died</text>
  <text start="1116.929" dur="3.961">in his sleep at age 79 on the night of</text>
  <text start="1118.94" dur="4.92">February 12th or the morning of February</text>

  <text start="1128.99" dur="5.04">pronounced dead of apparent natural</text>
  <text start="1131.12" dur="4.53">causes now as I believe very</text>
  <text start="1134.03" dur="4.08">controversial at the time they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1135.65" dur="4.02">have an autopsy I wonder why they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1138.11" dur="4.05">have an autopsy that sounds very strange</text>
  <text start="1139.67" dur="3.75">and they very much put a rush on the</text>
  <text start="1142.16" dur="3.54">funeral and I&amp;#39;m not sure if he was</text>
  <text start="1143.42" dur="5.7">cremated but I believe that was a part</text>
  <text start="1145.7" dur="6.83">of the story as well so anyway let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1149.12" dur="8.82">look at an email that John Podesta</text>
  <text start="1152.53" dur="8.38">received on tooth on February 9 2016 so</text>
  <text start="1157.94" dur="6.8">four days before Antonin Scalia was</text>
  <text start="1160.91" dur="7.05">found dead it says here I am all in</text>
  <text start="1164.74" dur="6.03">sounds like it will be a bad night we</text>
  <text start="1167.96" dur="6.3">all need to buckle up and double down</text>
  <text start="1170.77" dur="10.15">then John Podesta replies to this by</text>
  <text start="1174.26" dur="10.62">saying p.m. and then of course it says</text>
  <text start="1180.92" dur="4.65">here didn&amp;#39;t or no excuse me not p.m.</text>
  <text start="1184.88" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1236.21" dur="8.61">a you know retreat so what&amp;#39;s easily able</text>
  <text start="1241.61" dur="5.64">to be put together oh and it says here I</text>
  <text start="1244.82" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t see this part wet work is</text>
  <text start="1247.25" dur="4.89">actually a euphemism for murder or</text>
  <text start="1249.05" dur="4.68">assassination of course so what you</text>
  <text start="1252.14" dur="4.41">could put together from this is that</text>

  <text start="1256.55" dur="5.31">found dead at a vineyard with a pool</text>
  <text start="1258.97" dur="4.99">John Podesta wrote an email well</text>
  <text start="1261.86" dur="4.08">received an email from somebody saying</text>
  <text start="1263.96" dur="6.12">that they were all in on something very</text>
  <text start="1265.94" dur="7.38">nefarious and warning him to buckle down</text>
  <text start="1270.08" dur="4.92">to which he responds that he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1273.32" dur="4.92">think that they were going to do wet</text>
  <text start="1275" dur="7.41">works and pool parties at the vineyard</text>
  <text start="1278.24" dur="7.23">so that&amp;#39;s one example of John Podesta</text>

  <text start="1285.47" dur="4.83">with the fish the 14 in the fish there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1288.08" dur="5.22">a really convoluted way of understanding</text>
  <text start="1290.3" dur="5.16">what that means it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very very sick</text>
  <text start="1293.3" dur="4.23">and twisted if you if you actually</text>
  <text start="1295.46" dur="5.16">started doing research on it but here&amp;#39;s</text>
