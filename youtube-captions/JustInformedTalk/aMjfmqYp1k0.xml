  <text start="916.91" dur="5.369">on but here&amp;#39;s a military.com article</text>
  <text start="919.61" dur="4.469">that talks about Guantanamo Bay</text>
  <text start="922.279" dur="3.691">it says when it comes to Guantanamo Bay</text>
  <text start="924.079" dur="3.69">Trump is truly the Builder and sheep and</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="2.91">it talks about how the Trump</text>
  <text start="927.769" dur="2.641">administration is more than two hundred</text>
  <text start="928.88" dur="3.27">million dollars new construction teed up</text>
  <text start="930.41" dur="5.19">for Guantanamo this year next</text>
  <text start="932.15" dur="6.41">so that&amp;#39;s gonna be a big deal and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="935.6" dur="5.94">gonna actually be a part of an expansion</text>
  <text start="938.56" dur="4.12">so I wonder why they would be expanding</text>
  <text start="941.54" dur="2.85">Gitmo</text>
  <text start="942.68" dur="4.14">maybe because certain people will be</text>
  <text start="944.39" dur="4.44">spending some time there and then the</text>
  <text start="946.82" dur="3.36">next one is the Guardian article now</text>
  <text start="948.83" dur="3.24">this Guardian article Asha talks about</text>
  <text start="950.18" dur="4.26">the US private prison program being</text>
  <text start="952.07" dur="3.42">rebooted rebooted by the Trump</text>
  <text start="954.44" dur="3.24">administration so this was something</text>
  <text start="955.49" dur="4.62">that was cut by the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="957.68" dur="4.14">and you know there are people on both</text>
  <text start="960.11" dur="2.78">sides of this issue but to me it comes</text>
  <text start="961.82" dur="4.08">down to this</text>
  <text start="962.89" dur="6.76">private prisons I know they seem bad but</text>
  <text start="965.9" dur="6.18">the reality is it&amp;#39;s a way to cut costs</text>
  <text start="969.65" dur="4.26">and that&amp;#39;s really what it comes down to</text>
  <text start="972.08" dur="3.24">now we can regulate them and we can go</text>
  <text start="973.91" dur="4.71">in and say there&amp;#39;s a certain standard</text>
  <text start="975.32" dur="4.74">that has to be maintained but for the</text>
  <text start="978.62" dur="4.02">government to foot the bill on all of it</text>
  <text start="980.06" dur="4.71">and not to bring in private the private</text>
  <text start="982.64" dur="5.79">sector and to kick them out like they</text>
  <text start="984.77" dur="5.97">did with basically the Obama</text>
  <text start="988.43" dur="3.84">administration before that to me is what</text>
  <text start="990.74" dur="2.49">they wanted more criminals on the</text>
  <text start="992.27" dur="2.43">streets why would they want more</text>
  <text start="993.23" dur="2.94">criminals on the streets well so they</text>
  <text start="994.7" dur="2.97">could have an interview for go March and</text>
  <text start="996.17" dur="4.35">hit people over the head by clocks I</text>
  <text start="997.67" dur="4.62">guess so that&amp;#39;s basically my my take on</text>
  <text start="1000.52" dur="3.6">that and I talked about Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="1002.29" dur="3.81">was a part of that so then the next one</text>
  <text start="1004.12" dur="3.78">here is the last basically on his</text>
  <text start="1006.1" dur="4.29">article we&amp;#39;ve read probably about a</text>
  <text start="1007.9" dur="5.76">dozen times or more on this channel here</text>
  <text start="1010.39" dur="5.639">Turley and John Turley talking about I</text>
  <text start="1013.66" dur="3.96">think this job sorry not sure if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1016.029" dur="4.531">the first name I think it is sessions</text>
  <text start="1017.62" dur="4.65">appointing you top federal prosecute a</text>
  <text start="1020.56" dur="3.72">much better for Trump than second</text>
  <text start="1022.27" dur="4.319">special counsel and with this yet John</text>
  <text start="1024.28" dur="4.11">chart this article basic says I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="1026.589" dur="3.271">it a thousand times I didn&amp;#39;t even go</text>
  <text start="1028.39" dur="1.919">through it I&amp;#39;m not going to go through</text>
  <text start="1029.86" dur="2.849">it again</text>
  <text start="1030.309" dur="5.061">but I will say this what this article</text>
  <text start="1032.709" dur="5.13">basically is out is the fact that for</text>
  <text start="1035.37" dur="4.54">another second special counsel to come</text>
  <text start="1037.839" dur="4.441">into play in this would be really really</text>
  <text start="1039.91" dur="6.33">problematic for everyone because it</text>
  <text start="1042.28" dur="5.97">would just take so long and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1046.24" dur="3.75">basically this implication that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1048.25" dur="4.02">been secret investigations being</text>
  <text start="1049.99" dur="5.61">launched behind the scenes by Jeff</text>
  <text start="1052.27" dur="6.44">Sessions since like November I would say</text>
  <text start="1055.6" dur="5.34">what 2017 that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1058.71" dur="4.48">basically that&amp;#39;s what it kind of alludes</text>
  <text start="1060.94" dur="5.16">to that these investigations were put</text>
  <text start="1063.19" dur="5.67">together between Jeff Sessions and</text>
  <text start="1066.1" dur="4.08">John Huber and Michael Horowitz and that</text>
  <text start="1068.86" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ve all had kind of this</text>
  <text start="1070.18" dur="5.04">behind-the-scenes looking into things</text>
  <text start="1072.37" dur="4.77">like the Hillary Clinton and what</text>
  <text start="1075.22" dur="4.23">happened with her and there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="1077.14" dur="5.61">here that the reality is is that we all</text>
  <text start="1079.45" dur="6.47">know that there&amp;#39;s a lot there and it</text>
  <text start="1082.75" dur="5.7">deserves investigating but what we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1085.92" dur="3.82">always take into account is the national</text>
  <text start="1088.45" dur="4.5">security implications of this and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1089.74" dur="5.31">says a million times I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1092.95" dur="4.89">terrible and disgusting and awful what</text>
  <text start="1095.05" dur="4.71">Hillary and the rest did with the</text>
  <text start="1097.84" dur="4.35">special access information that was on</text>
  <text start="1099.76" dur="4.169">their servers this in private email</text>

  <text start="2672.56" dur="1.84">going to talk about here at the end of</text>
  <text start="2673.7" dur="3.49">this episode</text>
  <text start="2674.4" dur="4.919">that the most important things got thank</text>
  <text start="2677.19" dur="5.79">God&amp;#39;s grace and why is God&amp;#39;s grace</text>
  <text start="2679.319" dur="5.701">greater and I think I found a really</text>
  <text start="2682.98" dur="4.77">important a really appropriate verse</text>
  <text start="2685.02" dur="8.4">from Isaiah the Book of Isaiah chapter</text>
  <text start="2687.75" dur="7.5">29 and this verse talks about people who</text>
  <text start="2693.42" dur="3.6">try to hide things from the Lord and</text>
  <text start="2695.25" dur="4.039">that&amp;#39;s what all these people have done</text>
  <text start="2697.02" dur="4.92">and people who act in an evil way and</text>
  <text start="2699.289" dur="5.56">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened here these people</text>
  <text start="2701.94" dur="7.52">in these top positions of power that</text>
  <text start="2704.849" dur="8.97">we&amp;#39;re exposing every day are literally</text>
  <text start="2709.46" dur="7.3">corrupt they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;ve committed</text>
  <text start="2713.819" dur="4.111">acts of criminality that that you know</text>
  <text start="2716.76" dur="5.21">have not been proven beyond a reasonable</text>
  <text start="2717.93" dur="7.05">doubt yet but there&amp;#39;s alleged crimes of</text>
  <text start="2721.97" dur="5.559">all types of different things and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2724.98" dur="5.52">gone through dozens of them we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="2727.529" dur="6.151">through maybe even hundreds at this</text>
  <text start="2730.5" dur="4.559">point and examples of why things should</text>
  <text start="2733.68" dur="4.02">be investigated that don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="2735.059" dur="4.351">investigated examples of why previous</text>
  <text start="2737.7" dur="4.859">investigations were shut down and</text>
  <text start="2739.41" dur="4.74">basically put a gag orders on to so that</text>
  <text start="2742.559" dur="5.701">the information we get out so on and so</text>
  <text start="2744.15" dur="5.82">forth but to me it all comes back to God</text>
  <text start="2748.26" dur="3.69">we have to draw ourselves back to God</text>
  <text start="2749.97" dur="5.04">and get closer because that&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="2751.95" dur="5.129">important thing so in doing so we have</text>
  <text start="2755.01" dur="4.589">to remember that that God gives us these</text>
  <text start="2757.079" dur="4.26">great words to live by and to understand</text>
  <text start="2759.599" dur="4.68">the evil that&amp;#39;s out there so that we can</text>
  <text start="2761.339" dur="4.891">basically be better able to deal with it</text>
  <text start="2764.279" dur="4.83">and this is out of Isaiah it&amp;#39;s chapter</text>
  <text start="2766.23" dur="7.02">29 verses 15 and 16 and I just want to</text>
  <text start="2769.109" dur="6.69">share them with you and says woe to</text>
  <text start="2773.25" dur="4.71">those who go to great lengths to hide</text>
  <text start="2775.799" dur="3.871">their plans from the Lord they do their</text>
  <text start="2777.96" dur="4.8">works in darkness and say who sees us</text>
  <text start="2779.67" dur="5.369">who knows us you have turned things</text>
  <text start="2782.76" dur="5.13">around as if the potter were the same as</text>
  <text start="2785.039" dur="5.851">the clay how come what is made say about</text>
  <text start="2787.89" dur="5.79">its maker he didn&amp;#39;t make me how can what</text>
  <text start="2790.89" dur="5.25">is formed say about the one who formed</text>
  <text start="2793.68" dur="5.97">it he doesn&amp;#39;t understand what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="2796.14" dur="5.49">and that is so true that&amp;#39;s what these</text>
  <text start="2799.65" dur="2.939">people do that&amp;#39;s what he was talking</text>
  <text start="2801.63" dur="3.179">about when Q talks with this</text>
  <text start="2802.589" dur="4.2">psychological projection these</text>
  <text start="2804.809" dur="3.401">narcissists and what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="2806.789" dur="4.901">it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="2808.21" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re evil it comes in this form of</text>
  <text start="2811.69" dur="6.09">just complete aloof arrogant arrogance</text>
  <text start="2814.45" dur="5.25">they believe that they&amp;#39;re above God or</text>
  <text start="2817.78" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t have that strong faith to</text>
  <text start="2819.7" dur="3.57">where they fear God which believe it or</text>
  <text start="2821.8" dur="3.39">not one of the most important things we</text>
  <text start="2823.27" dur="4.23">can do is fear God because the Bible</text>
  <text start="2825.19" dur="4.74">actually tells us that that is important</text>
  <text start="2827.5" dur="4.829">the Lord wants us to fear Him and and</text>
  <text start="2829.93" dur="5.27">that is what keeps us obedient that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2832.329" dur="5.881">what keeps us safe that was that I mean</text>
  <text start="2835.2" dur="4.99">it&amp;#39;s not like a the kind of fear that</text>
  <text start="2838.21" dur="3.45">they you know a dictator would have it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2840.19" dur="3.69">the kind of fear it&amp;#39;s like reverence</text>
  <text start="2841.66" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s like respect it&amp;#39;s like you know you</text>
  <text start="2843.88" dur="5.13">you want to be a good person because you</text>
  <text start="2846.73" dur="5.01">realize that that&amp;#39;s the the the right</text>
  <text start="2849.01" dur="5.52">thing to do you know and you fear being</text>
  <text start="2851.74" dur="3.69">a bad person because that is the wrong</text>
  <text start="2854.53" dur="4.14">thing to do</text>
  <text start="2855.43" dur="6.179">and that&amp;#39;s exactly what this verse says</text>
  <text start="2858.67" dur="6.689">it makes these great analogies examples</text>
  <text start="2861.609" dur="6.99">it says or metaphors it says how could</text>
  <text start="2865.359" dur="7.921">the clay tell the the maker of the the</text>
