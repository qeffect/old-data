  <text start="356.25" dur="5.49">a pretty well versed in this stuff so my</text>
  <text start="359.73" dur="4.41">firm belief based on what I&amp;#39;ve been able</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="4.89">to put together so far is that you have</text>
  <text start="364.14" dur="3.72">a set of circumstances and what are</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="3.48">those set what is that set of</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="6.03">circumstances well it lends itself to</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="5.67">this there&amp;#39;s a set of conclusions that a</text>

  <text start="375.78" dur="6.33">let&amp;#39;s go ahead and take the first step</text>
  <text start="377.64" dur="5.88">down that road the first step down that</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="4.17">road in the set of conclusions is that</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="4.77">there is a deep state acting against</text>
  <text start="386.28" dur="6.12">Donald Trump he was spied on he was</text>

  <text start="392.4" dur="6.36">fought against as coming in a new</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="7.089">administration then further it&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="5.649">about something that&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="401.529" dur="4.52">important here when we talk about when</text>
  <text start="404.409" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re done with him</text>
  <text start="406.049" dur="7.57">he&amp;#39;ll claim Kenyan citizens because our</text>
  <text start="410.859" dur="5.07">steel industry was sold to the highest</text>
  <text start="413.619" dur="4.77">bidder and with Snowden so how did</text>
  <text start="415.929" dur="8.43">Snowden tie in all this okay so it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="418.389" dur="7.47">din is a black hat he may have been</text>
  <text start="424.359" dur="3.24">deceived he may have been told he was</text>
  <text start="425.859" dur="5.19">doing some altruistic thing he was</text>
  <text start="427.599" dur="5.46">exposing the government or whatever but</text>
  <text start="431.049" dur="3.81">what happened in reality was we have</text>
  <text start="433.059" dur="5">whistleblower laws in this country that</text>
  <text start="434.859" dur="5.37">are meant to protect people who expose</text>
  <text start="438.059" dur="5.2">crime or corruption within our</text>
  <text start="440.229" dur="5.79">government so why would somebody who is</text>
  <text start="443.259" dur="5.13">doing that out of that altruistic sense</text>
  <text start="446.019" dur="4.98">of patriotism as most people want to</text>
  <text start="448.389" dur="4.62">claim in the boards here</text>

  <text start="453.009" dur="4.53">escape to foreign countries well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.259" dur="5.25">because he was not doing it for those</text>
  <text start="457.539" dur="5.58">purposes he was doing it because he was</text>
  <text start="460.509" dur="4.53">advised by the administration I think</text>
  <text start="463.119" dur="5.12">they&amp;#39;ve all been culturally</text>
  <text start="465.039" dur="5.64">indoctrinated on a Marxist socialist</text>
  <text start="468.239" dur="4">viewpoint and they thought they were</text>
  <text start="470.679" dur="4.89">doing this great service for the</text>

  <text start="475.569" dur="6.15">America by sending Snowden over as an</text>
  <text start="479.229" dur="4.65">operative to expose all of our deep</text>
  <text start="481.719" dur="4.32">state intelligence programs thereby</text>
  <text start="483.879" dur="4.981">crippling our intelligence agencies</text>
