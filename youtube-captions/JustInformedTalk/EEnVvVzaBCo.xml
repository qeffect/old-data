  <text start="112.17" dur="4.17">friends of those who are affected in all</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="4.92">of these cases I&amp;#39;d like to put that up</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="5.819">front but right now they are still</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="4.409">investigating so apparently the former</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="3.801">Arkansas state senator reportedly was</text>
  <text start="123.869" dur="4.801">found shot dead inside her home Tuesday</text>
  <text start="125.96" dur="5.919">prompting police to launch a homicide</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="4.98">investigation so her body was discovered</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="4.351">Tuesday night at her home in Polk</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="4.229">Cantus about 130 miles northeast of</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="5.009">Little Rock her former press secretary</text>

  <text start="141.239" dur="5.61">being investigated as murder and that</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="4.61">neighbors reported hearing gunshots a</text>
  <text start="146.849" dur="7.73">day or two before the body was found and</text>
  <text start="149.51" dur="7.3">this is really sad really sad story and</text>
  <text start="154.579" dur="4.931">you know I saw this story when it broke</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="4.649">yesterday and I even think I maybe</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="4.949">mentioned it yesterday in the video or</text>
  <text start="161.459" dur="6.03">in another video maybe not but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="4.711">happened since has been really in just</text>
  <text start="167.489" dur="3.36">one of those stories that as you read</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="3.899">through you go wow this is crazy</text>
  <text start="170.849" dur="7.681">because a lot of people are just popping</text>
  <text start="173.069" dur="8.131">up either being murdered or being or</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="5.22">having committed suicide and that goes</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="4.259">into the next one here which yesterday</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="4.829">was reported that a New York Police</text>
  <text start="185.459" dur="4.89">Department Chief had killed himself just</text>
  <text start="188.579" dur="4.41">days before retirement so apparently</text>
  <text start="190.349" dur="4.021">deputy chief Stephen silks was</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="4.83">pronounced dead from a self-inflicted</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="5.16">gunshot wound Wednesday evening it says</text>
  <text start="197.819" dur="4.741">he was off-duty and located near burn</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="4.38">street in 69th in Queens and then it</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="2.91">says the officer was found sitting in a</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="3">car suffering from a gunshot wound to</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="4.109">the head he was taken Elmhurst Hospital</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="4.979">by an NYPD car it was listed in critical</text>
  <text start="209.579" dur="5.671">condition where he was later pronounced</text>
  <text start="211.889" dur="5.641">deceased obviously this is a picture</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="4.889">from not too long ago back in April</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="5.549">where this deputy chief Stephen silks</text>
  <text start="220.139" dur="4.621">was being actually honored for his 39</text>
  <text start="223.079" dur="3.84">years of dedicated service to the people</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="5.849">of New York and here&amp;#39;s a picture of him</text>
  <text start="226.919" dur="5.011">receiving the honor and unfortunately as</text>
  <text start="230.609" dur="3.181">I say thoughts and prayers with the</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="5.699">family and friends of these individuals</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="5.46">but he has apparently been found with as</text>
  <text start="237.629" dur="4.7">it&amp;#39;s said there what appears to be a</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="6.54">self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head</text>
  <text start="242.329" dur="4.84">that is another example of what happened</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="4.02">yesterday so you have two happening</text>
  <text start="247.169" dur="4.44">close to one another and the first thing</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="6.269">I thought of was obviously back in May</text>
  <text start="251.609" dur="7.321">of 2018 Q posted these posts about the</text>
  <text start="256.079" dur="7.111">NYPD detectives who may or may not have</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="6.84">actually seen things they should not</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="4.29">have seen let&amp;#39;s put it that way and with</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="4.35">that in mind what I thought was</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="4.32">fascinating about these posts is this is</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="4.29">where we were pointed in the direction</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="6.33">of officer Familia now officer Familia</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="5.79">was a police officer in New York who was</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="5.88">shot in the line of duty I believe in</text>
  <text start="280.2" dur="6.8">was and passed away and Q had alluded to</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="6.29">the fact basically that these two NYPD</text>
  <text start="287" dur="7.09">detectives who had lost their lives</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="5.29">along with officer familia were and I</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t know if it was two plus one or</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="5.46">just the two but they viewed the</text>
  <text start="299.7" dur="2.76">insurance filed now what was the</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="4.38">insurance file what&amp;#39;s that a reference</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="5.37">to Hue says find the two NYPD detectives</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="6.18">187 which would be like that were killed</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="5.61">or died in mid 2017 as as did they view</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="4.44">the insurance file threat surreal it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="5.04">not a game q so the insurance file is</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="5.07">directly referencing what was on Anthony</text>
  <text start="318.48" dur="5.46">Weiner&amp;#39;s laptop according to multiple</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="6.33">reports and allegations that are out</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="5.19">there the actual computer itself the</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="3.63">laptop computer that was seized by the</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="6.18">NYPD as a part of their investigation</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="8.85">into Anthony Weiner sexting of underage</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="6.24">girls this happened right around that</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="3.66">same time when reports were coming out</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="4.68">saying that police had stumbled upon</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="4.98">during their normal course of searching</text>
  <text start="346.23" dur="5.4">the laptop a file that was marked</text>
  <text start="348.57" dur="6.36">insurance now it was on that file has</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="5.67">been the subject of much much debate</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="4.8">there are those who believe there were</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="4.65">videos on there of Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="359.73" dur="4.38">whom abdomen caged in things that could</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="4.07">have been used for possible blackmail /</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="5.22">what you would call I guess insurance</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="6.91">political insurance everything from that</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="6.03">to classified information special access</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="5.22">program information you name it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="4.5">been speculated that there was stuff on</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="4.7">this insurance file or just blackmail</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="5.9">blackmailing materials for other</text>
  <text start="382.85" dur="6.04">high-ranking political figures and</text>
  <text start="385.76" dur="5.23">apparently figures inside it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="388.89" dur="4.05">alleged I&amp;#39;m saying that it could have</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="3.81">been blackmailing and from information</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="4.23">on hiring political officials</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="4.38">high-ranking officials inside of the</text>
  <text start="397.17" dur="4.03">police department itself and or</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="6.01">high-ranking officials inside</text>
  <text start="401.2" dur="6.03">government so there&amp;#39;s really an</text>
  <text start="405.19" dur="5.28">incredible amount of mystery behind what</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="5.75">was in that insurance file but Q alluded</text>
  <text start="410.47" dur="5.73">to the fact that is possible that</text>
  <text start="412.98" dur="5.77">multiple NYPD officers loft lost their</text>
  <text start="416.2" dur="6.27">lives because they saw what was on that</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="8.72">file and you guys know how it goes in</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="7.05">this world it seems that when the</text>
  <text start="427.47" dur="3.31">clandestine intelligence E&amp;#39;s have</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="3.3">information out there that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="6.21">want people to see especially if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="8.19">incredibly harmful to the individuals</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="6.63">who are involved they may go to any</text>
  <text start="441.01" dur="5.04">lengths to cover this information up so</text>
  <text start="443.62" dur="5.6">I think that was a pretty fascinating</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="5.61">little side note to all of this and</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="5.56">we&amp;#39;re just asking the questions here</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="4.68">this is a tragic story again today we</text>
  <text start="454.78" dur="4.29">have reports coming out that a former</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="4.95">Oklahoma State Senator was found dead in</text>

  <text start="469.57" dur="3.3">apparent gunshot wound inside his home</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="3.33">police confirmed in a press release</text>
  <text start="472.87" dur="6.84">Thursday they discovered the body of the</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="6.87">53 year-old inside his West Norman home</text>
  <text start="479.71" dur="3.54">after receiving a call Wednesday night</text>
  <text start="481.45" dur="3.99">of an individual with a gunshot wound</text>
  <text start="483.25" dur="4.29">police say the case remains under</text>
  <text start="485.44" dur="3.6">investigation and that they are working</text>
  <text start="487.54" dur="3.03">with the medical examiner&amp;#39;s office to</text>
  <text start="489.04" dur="3.48">determine the exact cause and manner of</text>
  <text start="490.57" dur="5.25">his death Nicholas is a former</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="6.45">Republican state senator from Norman who</text>

  <text start="498.97" dur="6.47">staff positions with the State House</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="8.25">Senate and the University of Oklahoma so</text>
  <text start="505.44" dur="5.65">here&amp;#39;s just another example and of</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="4.71">course another story that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="5.28">updated today is there&amp;#39;s a second New</text>

  <text start="516.37" dur="6.12">NYPD detective has killed himself hours</text>
  <text start="518.95" dur="5.1">after the chief does the same thing so</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="4.08">this is a story now of course it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="5.55">breaking saying a frantic search for a</text>
  <text start="526.57" dur="6.03">missing NYPD detective ended with a grim</text>

  <text start="558.7" dur="5.13">released on Thursday morning</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="4.23">Calabrese was 58 was a sign that</text>
  <text start="563.83" dur="3.99">Brooklyn South a homicide squad after</text>
  <text start="565.84" dur="3.6">co-workers became concerned after he</text>

  <text start="569.44" dur="3.99">left his friends family and co-workers</text>
  <text start="570.7" dur="5.67">shocked that Hartman is in shock as this</text>
  <text start="573.43" dur="4.71">suicide comes just hours after the NYPD</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="5.19">chief Stephen silks shot and killed</text>
  <text start="578.14" dur="8.4">himself just days before his scheduled</text>
  <text start="581.56" dur="8.37">retirement so this is getting a pretty</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="5.1">pretty strange when you start putting</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="3.54">all these stories together one next to</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="4.05">the other and asking a question of you</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="5.97">know what&amp;#39;s actually going on here who</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="5.79">is uh or how did all of this seem to</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="4.41">happen within days of each other and is</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="4.26">any or any of these stories connected</text>
  <text start="603.85" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s really the question that I have</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="4.71">and I would encourage us all to go dig</text>
  <text start="608.14" dur="4.05">and look further into it but I can tell</text>
  <text start="610.45" dur="5.31">you right now that you have an Arkansas</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="6.65">state senator you have a Oklahoma State</text>
  <text start="615.76" dur="8.94">Senator and you have two high-ranking</text>
  <text start="618.84" dur="8.32">NYPD officials who have been either</text>
  <text start="624.7" dur="7.44">killed or have committed suicide in the</text>
  <text start="627.16" dur="6.18">last 48 hours and you know it&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="2.79">of those things when you start putting</text>
  <text start="633.34" dur="5.91">it all together it just looks kind of</text>

  <text start="992.96" dur="2.91">call them</text>
  <text start="993.79" dur="3.91">investigators anymore because we have</text>
  <text start="995.87" dur="4.41">been able to establish that if these</text>
