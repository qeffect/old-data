  <text start="532.1" dur="2.969">from the Hudson Institute this lease</text>
  <text start="533.42" dur="3.06">myth it&amp;#39;s an interesting read if you</text>
  <text start="535.069" dur="3.33">want to read it but it said the</text>
  <text start="536.48" dur="2.909">negotiations were about something else</text>
  <text start="538.399" dur="3.031">entirely</text>
  <text start="539.389" dur="4.5">they were about what Obama has described</text>
  <text start="541.43" dur="3.839">as a new geopolitical equilibrium which</text>
  <text start="543.889" dur="2.971">would stabilize the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="545.269" dur="3.601">allow the administration to further</text>

  <text start="548.87" dur="3.69">Obama described it publicly</text>
  <text start="550.31" dur="3.839">this new security architecture was going</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="2.88">to balance Iran against traditional</text>
  <text start="554.149" dur="4.231">American allies like Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="555.44" dur="4.889">however it soon became apparent that the</text>
  <text start="558.38" dur="4.59">White House wasn&amp;#39;t really balancing at</text>
  <text start="560.329" dur="4.831">all but had rather chosen one team over</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="4.38">the others Iran Obama made his</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="6.03">preference for Iran and its allies clear</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="5.669">in Lebanon Syria and most obviously in</text>
  <text start="571.19" dur="3.93">Iraq where the White House ordered</text>
  <text start="573.019" dur="3.93">airstrikes on Isis positions that</text>

  <text start="582.709" dur="3.99">just one example of the way Obama</text>
  <text start="584.569" dur="5.341">basically paved the way for the Iranians</text>
