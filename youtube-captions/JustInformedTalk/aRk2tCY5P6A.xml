  <text start="181.12" dur="6.6">stories including breaking news that we</text>
  <text start="185.5" dur="4.56">all basically knew from the get-go that</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="5.55">there were cameras all over Epstein</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="5.73">Island and it&amp;#39;s very possible that very</text>
  <text start="193.27" dur="4.59">high profile individuals were blackmail</text>
  <text start="195.79" dur="4.38">or were videotaped and then possibly</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="4.17">blackmailed or extorted based off of the</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="6.47">information that was on those videotapes</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="6.929">very very disgusting sick things and but</text>
  <text start="206.64" dur="4.21">before we get into everything else I</text>

  <text start="210.85" dur="3.63">here to the landing page and watch these</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="4.47">videos and why do I do that very simple</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="4.59">there is an algorithmic suppression it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="4.08">built into the AI that is the algorithm</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="4.68">where they take certain words and</text>
  <text start="220.84" dur="5.04">phrases and things that are said just</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="4.17">you can&amp;#39;t make this stuff up in order to</text>
  <text start="225.88" dur="4.29">suppress content so it doesn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="227.92" dur="4.65">suggested so it doesn&amp;#39;t go viral so that</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="4.17">it limits the amount of people who are</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="4.32">able to see it and when you get your</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="5.04">content categorized as this channel has</text>
  <text start="236.89" dur="4.47">been by YouTube in that section of</text>
  <text start="239.38" dur="4.65">whatever they want to call it on the</text>
  <text start="241.36" dur="5.129">border whatever then you get this</text>
  <text start="244.03" dur="4.56">hard-core suppression and we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="3.601">breaking through it but I need you guys</text>

  <text start="447.249" dur="4.32">big waves you know first they</text>
  <text start="448.769" dur="4.81">demonetized the majority of my content</text>
  <text start="451.569" dur="4.59">then they started you could see them</text>
  <text start="453.579" dur="4.38">manipulate the algorithms behind the</text>
  <text start="456.159" dur="5.88">scenes so that your content was like</text>

  <text start="812.44" dur="5.25">you but um I just had to point that out</text>
  <text start="815.32" dur="4.29">now here&amp;#39;s another story I thought we</text>
  <text start="817.69" dur="3.99">should cover going into other news you</text>
  <text start="819.61" dur="5.58">know things are happening continually</text>
  <text start="821.68" dur="5.73">this looks like the NYPD was involved in</text>
  <text start="825.19" dur="6.27">apprehending this Broadway producer</text>
  <text start="827.41" dur="8.07">another big Hollywood big you know media</text>
  <text start="831.46" dur="5.97">person with child porn so this is just</text>
  <text start="835.48" dur="3.75">another example of how we are continuing</text>
  <text start="837.43" dur="4.69">to see justice brought on a regular</text>
  <text start="839.23" dur="5.86">basis now getting into Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="842.12" dur="4.74">many stories have been coming out over</text>
  <text start="845.09" dur="4.07">and over and over more and more some are</text>
  <text start="846.86" dur="4.14">important some are just you know CBS</text>
  <text start="849.16" dur="5.71">shrieking heard from Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="851" dur="7.83">cell the morning he died well presume</text>
  <text start="854.87" dur="5.96">was presuming he did die I&amp;#39;d presume</text>
  <text start="858.83" dur="4.38">that there was probably shrieking</text>
  <text start="860.83" dur="3.73">there&amp;#39;s two scenarios a lot of people</text>
  <text start="863.21" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s two camps that I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="864.56" dur="4.41">basically come out of this there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="866.48" dur="5.16">camp that says it was an actual hit that</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="5.1">was pulled off by very corrupt evil</text>
  <text start="871.64" dur="3.69">people who wanted to shut down Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="874.07" dur="3.12">Epstein to keep him from leaking</text>
  <text start="875.33" dur="6.03">information which is very plausible</text>
  <text start="877.19" dur="5.7">Mellie camp says it was he was taken out</text>
  <text start="881.36" dur="3.75">of his cell and put in either witness</text>
  <text start="882.89" dur="4.89">protection or flown down to Guantanamo</text>
  <text start="885.11" dur="4.95">Bay or abducted by aliens I&amp;#39;ve seen that</text>
  <text start="887.78" dur="3.84">one too so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="890.06" dur="4.17">what actually happened there but the</text>
  <text start="891.62" dur="5.97">fact is that this is just another a</text>
  <text start="894.23" dur="5.22">fluff piece from the news and I think</text>
  <text start="897.59" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re trying to cover up for who</text>
  <text start="899.45" dur="3.66">really did this they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="901.58" dur="4.53">that the guards who are on duty were</text>
  <text start="903.11" dur="4.89">sleeping now let me ask you this I mean</text>
  <text start="906.11" dur="3.81">like what do they think this is some</text>
  <text start="908" dur="4.26">sort of 1980s</text>
  <text start="909.92" dur="5.1">you know cop comedy or something buddy</text>
  <text start="912.26" dur="4.8">count comedy where all the two guards</text>
  <text start="915.02" dur="3.96">were just you know you know sleep it all</text>
  <text start="917.06" dur="4.08">the job it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="918.98" dur="4.65">Correctional Facility you want me to</text>
  <text start="921.14" dur="5.49">believe that two guards not just one two</text>
  <text start="923.63" dur="5.7">guards were asleep and had no idea what</text>
  <text start="926.63" dur="4.01">was going on for three hours it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="929.33" dur="4.14">insanity</text>
  <text start="930.64" dur="5.14">but the New York Times is always good at</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="7.29">giving you implausible stories with</text>
  <text start="935.78" dur="8.67">which to you know really tease your</text>
  <text start="940.76" dur="5.55">noggin right tease your brain here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="944.45" dur="3.87">another one this is a new story it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.31" dur="6.18">coming out so I&amp;#39;m really starting to</text>
  <text start="948.32" dur="6.03">think that they planted this post on a</text>
  <text start="952.49" dur="4.65">chain in order to come after it just</text>
  <text start="954.35" dur="4.65">like they did a chain or on this post on</text>
  <text start="957.14" dur="3.48">4chan so that they could come after it</text>
  <text start="959" dur="4.2">just like they did a chain after the</text>
  <text start="960.62" dur="6.27">shootings and the manifesto you even had</text>
  <text start="963.2" dur="7.38">fake news media reporting that 8chan was</text>
  <text start="966.89" dur="6.3">getting more manifestos from other</text>
  <text start="970.58" dur="4.29">criminals when they weren&amp;#39;t even up the</text>
  <text start="973.19" dur="3.54">website wasn&amp;#39;t even up and running</text>
  <text start="974.87" dur="5.58">so what I&amp;#39;m thinking is when I read this</text>
  <text start="976.73" dur="7.62">story quite simply put it&amp;#39;s fairly</text>
  <text start="980.45" dur="6.12">obvious to me that Jeffrey Epstein died</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="5.67">and somebody knew and then put this post</text>
  <text start="986.57" dur="5.76">up there for presumably to take down</text>
  <text start="990.02" dur="4.41">4chan because 4chan is is just another</text>
  <text start="992.33" dur="3.69">iteration of H and H hands a little bit</text>
  <text start="994.43" dur="2.85">different in its structure but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="996.02" dur="3.39">basically the same thing</text>
  <text start="997.28" dur="4.89">so the attempts to shut down free speech</text>
  <text start="999.41" dur="5.4">will continue and they will be with more</text>
  <text start="1002.17" dur="7.23">and more attacks like this where they</text>
  <text start="1004.81" dur="7.64">try to frame innocent companies for</text>
  <text start="1009.4" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s going on here with these psychos</text>
  <text start="1012.45" dur="4.36">here&amp;#39;s another story that I thought was</text>
  <text start="1014.65" dur="4.47">interesting this is trending on new york</text>
  <text start="1016.81" dur="4.47">post calm but apparently there&amp;#39;s a photo</text>

  <text start="1040.57" dur="5.82">this is to me it&amp;#39;s just another strong</text>
  <text start="1044.2" dur="4.41">indicator that the people that Epstein</text>

  <text start="1163.82" dur="6.66">it says on the weekends in 1990s Maxwell</text>
  <text start="1168.259" dur="3.75">would have her roller blades FedEx to</text>
  <text start="1170.48" dur="3.48">Epstein&amp;#39;s island in the Caribbean and</text>
  <text start="1172.009" dur="3.42">said she got her helicopters license so</text>
  <text start="1173.96" dur="4.309">she could transport anyone she liked</text>
  <text start="1175.429" dur="3.99">without pilots knowing who they were</text>
  <text start="1178.269" dur="4.36">Maxwell</text>
  <text start="1179.419" dur="5.49">also said the island had been completely</text>
  <text start="1182.629" dur="5.55">wired for video the friend thought that</text>
  <text start="1184.909" dur="4.62">she had an Epstein were videotaping or</text>
  <text start="1188.179" dur="2.73">that she and Epstein were videotaping</text>
  <text start="1189.529" dur="4.59">everyone on the island and as an</text>
  <text start="1190.909" dur="5.49">insurance policy as blackmail and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1194.119" dur="4.44">also heard from one of the victims the</text>
  <text start="1196.399" dur="6.921">alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein in</text>
  <text start="1198.559" dur="4.761">court documents where she actually says</text>
  <text start="1203.739" dur="5.88">they told me that there were cameras</text>
  <text start="1206.299" dur="6.931">everywhere even in the bathrooms so</text>
  <text start="1209.619" dur="7.78">remember this whole island was wired up</text>
  <text start="1213.23" dur="6.899">for surveillance and it was what we call</text>
  <text start="1217.399" dur="5.941">or what they call I guess a honeypot it</text>
  <text start="1220.129" dur="6.98">was where people came to have sex with</text>
  <text start="1223.34" dur="7.319">or to do debaucherous things drug sex</text>
  <text start="1227.109" dur="5.44">you name it and they were being filmed</text>
  <text start="1230.659" dur="4.5">the whole time probably unbeknownst to</text>
  <text start="1232.549" dur="5.94">them and then that was later stored and</text>
  <text start="1235.159" dur="6.24">cataloged and then held as it says here</text>
  <text start="1238.489" dur="3.911">as an insurance policy now I think this</text>
  <text start="1241.399" dur="3.311">relates to</text>
  <text start="1242.4" dur="5.91">directly back to what we know happened</text>
  <text start="1244.71" dur="6.18">Jeff or Anthony Weiner was arrested his</text>
  <text start="1248.31" dur="6.17">laptop was seized there was a file on it</text>
  <text start="1250.89" dur="7.11">at the NYPD open and examined labeled</text>
  <text start="1254.48" dur="6.79">insurance now we know that that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1258" dur="7.19">alleged and we know that the individuals</text>
  <text start="1261.27" dur="7.41">who work at this organization have</text>
  <text start="1265.19" dur="6.58">continued to see these tragedies happen</text>
  <text start="1268.68" dur="6.48">for instance here is a the latest story</text>
  <text start="1271.77" dur="5.73">I should say right here an NYPD cop</text>
  <text start="1275.16" dur="4.56">friend of officer who recently committed</text>
  <text start="1277.5" dur="3.87">suicide shoots himself to death so this</text>
  <text start="1279.72" dur="3.47">gentleman right here Johnny Rios God</text>
  <text start="1281.37" dur="4.68">rest his soul</text>
  <text start="1283.19" dur="6.61">decided to commit suicide again again</text>
  <text start="1286.05" dur="5.91">just another set of strange suicides</text>
  <text start="1289.8" dur="4.38">coming from the NYPD that we have to</text>
  <text start="1291.96" dur="4.23">continue to watch and like I was showing</text>
  <text start="1294.18" dur="3.36">you here the judge overseeing Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1296.19" dur="3.75">Epstein case this was reported back in</text>
  <text start="1297.54" dur="4.88">March you&amp;#39;ll remember mysteriously died</text>
  <text start="1299.94" dur="5.79">as well hmm</text>
  <text start="1302.42" dur="6.88">now of course I&amp;#39;d made a note to say</text>
  <text start="1305.73" dur="5.13">that he was 96 years old and that is not</text>
  <text start="1309.3" dur="3.87">the most strange thing for anyone to</text>
  <text start="1310.86" dur="5.61">pass away at that age but that in mind</text>
  <text start="1313.17" dur="5.94">you have to remember that this was a</text>
  <text start="1316.47" dur="5.13">very strange coincidence all happening</text>
  <text start="1319.11" dur="5.01">before all this these latest stories of</text>
  <text start="1321.6" dur="4.38">broken about Epstein the island the</text>
  <text start="1324.12" dur="4.71">arrests the indictments and obviously</text>
  <text start="1325.98" dur="4.62">now the suicide so there&amp;#39;s just a lot</text>
  <text start="1328.83" dur="5.58">more there I think we should continue to</text>
  <text start="1330.6" dur="5.37">dig deeper on here was somebody who</text>
  <text start="1334.41" dur="4.31">wanted to kind of dig deeper into this</text>
  <text start="1335.97" dur="5.76">so in these you know talk about rich</text>
  <text start="1338.72" dur="5.62">high-level ranking people being named in</text>
  <text start="1341.73" dur="3.84">these documents that were released the</text>
  <text start="1344.34" dur="4.35">court documents that were released from</text>
  <text start="1345.57" dur="6.05">the Epstein case there was a document</text>
  <text start="1348.69" dur="5.82">that named Bill Richardson directly and</text>
  <text start="1351.62" dur="4.27">this article is just a steam it thread</text>
  <text start="1354.51" dur="2.55">that&amp;#39;s to asking you know shouldn&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="1355.89" dur="4.04">be looking at these people more closely</text>
  <text start="1357.06" dur="5.34">here&amp;#39;s the article itself it says</text>
  <text start="1359.93" dur="5.08">because that&amp;#39;s how it went and this is I</text>
  <text start="1362.4" dur="4.56">think one of the victims giving their</text>
  <text start="1365.01" dur="4.05">testimony saying because that&amp;#39;s how it</text>
  <text start="1366.96" dur="2.58">went they instructed me to go to George</text>

  <text start="1374.79" dur="3.81">know his name a guy who that</text>
  <text start="1376.44" dur="3.54">owns a hotel a really large hotel chain</text>

  <text start="1382.92" dur="2.19">foreign president i can&amp;#39;t remember his</text>
  <text start="1384.69" dur="2.58">name</text>
  <text start="1385.11" dur="4.38">he was Spanish there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="1387.27" dur="3.93">them I just it&amp;#39;s hard for me to remember</text>
  <text start="1389.49" dur="3.27">all of them you know I was told to do</text>
  <text start="1391.2" dur="4.35">something by these people constantly</text>
  <text start="1392.76" dur="4.53">told to my whole life revolved around</text>
  <text start="1395.55" dur="3.66">just pleasing these men and keeping just</text>
  <text start="1397.29" dur="4.41">Lane and Jeffrey happy their whole</text>
  <text start="1399.21" dur="5.04">entire lives revolve around sex they</text>
  <text start="1401.7" dur="5.52">call massages sex they call modeling sex</text>
  <text start="1404.25" dur="4.34">and they call and that it says when it</text>
  <text start="1407.22" dur="4.5">happened</text>
  <text start="1408.59" dur="6.16">when just Lane Maxwell used the words go</text>
  <text start="1411.72" dur="6.54">give a massage to Bill Richardson where</text>
  <text start="1414.75" dur="5.55">were you and there was a an objection by</text>
  <text start="1418.26" dur="4.86">the attorney here and it says I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1420.3" dur="5.19">tell you where we were I know where I</text>
  <text start="1423.12" dur="5.46">was sent to I don&amp;#39;t know where we were</text>
  <text start="1425.49" dur="6.93">when she told me to do that and where</text>
  <text start="1428.58" dur="7.98">she sent you or were where were you sent</text>
  <text start="1432.42" dur="6.66">to and she answers New Mexico by just</text>
  <text start="1436.56" dur="5.31">Layne Maxwell and that&amp;#39;s where it ends</text>
  <text start="1439.08" dur="6.12">but the the real thing to remember here</text>
  <text start="1441.87" dur="5.85">is that New Mexico is where Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1445.2" dur="6.44">Epstein had his Zorro ranch which</text>
  <text start="1447.72" dur="8.58">mysteriously apparently won a Oklahoma</text>
  <text start="1451.64" dur="7.99">Powerball lottery you know just randomly</text>
  <text start="1456.3" dur="5.82">a billionaire wins a lottery I think</text>
  <text start="1459.63" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s not something to really look at</text>
  <text start="1462.12" dur="5.31">any further right but also this ranch</text>
  <text start="1465.3" dur="5.31">used to belong to the former governor of</text>
  <text start="1467.43" dur="8.4">New Mexico who bought who sold this</text>
  <text start="1470.61" dur="6.66">ranch to Jeffrey Epstein so there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1475.83" dur="2.61">a whole lot more to this and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1477.27" dur="3.69">leave this if you want to read through</text>
  <text start="1478.44" dur="4.17">it and read more about Bill Richardson</text>
  <text start="1480.96" dur="3.75">in his connections because there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1482.61" dur="4.2">to dig into there so I just thought I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1484.71" dur="3.84">share that with you guys I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="1486.81" dur="3.66">about this for a chain owner Jim Watkins</text>

  <text start="1601.64" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s hilarious to watch this video and</text>
  <text start="1603.26" dur="5.79">then President Trump just destroyed him</text>

  <text start="1629.66" dur="3.96">has any because of the red flag law</text>
