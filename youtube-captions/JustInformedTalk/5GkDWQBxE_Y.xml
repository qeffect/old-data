  <text start="61.469" dur="4.02">Q says about this letter which we are</text>
  <text start="63.899" dur="4.29">already covered in detail it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="5.641">letter from Anthony Kennedy to President</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="5.191">Trump saying that he has decided to</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="4.94">basically step down from the Supreme</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="6">Court which will make another opening</text>
  <text start="76.07" dur="7.15">force him to be replaced with presumably</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="5.82">a more conservative justice and and to</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="4.23">date Anthony Kennedy has been known as</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="4.68">basically kind of a swing vote he makes</text>
  <text start="87.45" dur="4.919">a big difference and here&amp;#39;s what Q says</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="4.68">his choice remember Kennedy was the</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="6.36">swing vote no more locked and loaded</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="6">Ruth Bader Ginsburg next Q that&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="5.701">important I apologize for skipping over</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="5.82">it but Ruth Bader Ginsburg she&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="3.81">under a lot of scrutiny on this Q board</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="4.529">with a lot of the post he&amp;#39;s been putting</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="4.26">up there about what kind of ties does</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="4.021">she have in Southeast Asia</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="4.409">what kind of ties does she have to</text>
  <text start="114.93" dur="8.25">communist officials what kind of ties</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="9.931">does she have to this new I guess new</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="5.969">world order of communist infiltration in</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="3.33">our country it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not crazy it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="2.791">far-fetched</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="3.67">there&amp;#39;s nothing conspiratorial about it</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="4.659">you can read Ruth Bader Ginsburg</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="5.1">writings where she I&amp;#39;ve gone over them</text>
  <text start="136.599" dur="6.421">in previous episodes where she endorses</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="6.78">things that are pretty insane to me</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="6.84">lowering the age of consent for children</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="6.87">to be engage in sexual activity and and</text>
  <text start="149.86" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s just one of many policies so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s really really upsetting to hear</text>
  <text start="154.239" dur="4.351">some of her thoughts especially in her</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="3.72">earlier writings now in the thing that</text>
  <text start="158.59" dur="4.679">Jesus Supreme Court justice is even</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="4.739">worse but she&amp;#39;s getting way up there in</text>
  <text start="163.269" dur="3.271">age I don&amp;#39;t know how some of these</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="4.741">people are you know considered to be</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="6.69">cognitively functioning at that age but</text>
  <text start="169.45" dur="5.31">I guess they you know I I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="3.89">not a psychologist I&amp;#39;m not a doctor I</text>
  <text start="174.76" dur="5.82">can&amp;#39;t tell you but I can tell you that</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="6.28">from what I&amp;#39;ve heard of her speaking she</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="6.51">sounds fairly present but at the same</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="5.43">time her rhetoric is completely biased</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="4.14">even though she tries her best to be</text>
  <text start="188.83" dur="6.39">impartial as she has to being a Supreme</text>
  <text start="191.23" dur="5.85">Court justice now this was fascinating</text>
  <text start="195.22" dur="3.45">see though because Kennedy&amp;#39;s out we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.08" dur="3.15">gonna see yous next and then with regard</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="3.629">to this I was reading through the early</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="4.41">comments on this last video that that</text>
  <text start="202.299" dur="3.391">you guys can go watch that I posted and</text>
  <text start="204.64" dur="3.629">they were talking about how it would be</text>
  <text start="205.69" dur="5.25">very suspicious and it would be strange</text>
  <text start="208.269" dur="4.59">if trey gowdy were to become a Supreme</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="4.5">Court justice simply for the fact that</text>
  <text start="212.859" dur="6.121">he was a prosecutor and the Supreme</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="8.85">Court justice is presumably a judge so a</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="8.52">judge position judgeship and so would it</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="4.86">be strange for a prosecutor to fill that</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="4.65">position I&amp;#39;m not sure I don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="6.089">history behind every Supreme Court pick</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="6.919">for the history of our country but it</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="6.631">would presumably to me I assume that</text>
  <text start="239.069" dur="4.721">Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s is eligible it meets all</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="3.239">the requirements whatever they are I</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="3.3">wouldn&amp;#39;t see why it would be that</text>
  <text start="245.109" dur="6.061">shocking or surprising even though he is</text>
  <text start="247.09" dur="6.899">a prosecutor now he who knows the law is</text>
  <text start="251.17" dur="5.069">the point now this is the the latest Q</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="5.131">post and it&amp;#39;s pretty important it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="4.68">basically a cue saying here look no</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="3.51">matter what President Trump does it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="2.971">not good enough and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="2.76">impeach him for and that&amp;#39;s what their</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="2.45">whole agenda is that&amp;#39;s what the whole</text>

  <text start="568.33" dur="5.82">basically is overthrown the MSM doctrine</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="4.14">and they&amp;#39;re not believing what they are</text>
  <text start="574.15" dur="3.26">saying and it says do you believe we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="577.41" dur="5.26">well I believe we are winning and you</text>
  <text start="581.17" dur="4.32">read this article and yet kind of lays</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="5.13">it out basically how you would suspect</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="4.11">and it says silent majority no more of</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="4.23">course we were the silent majority now</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="4.05">we are not fight fight fight we have to</text>
  <text start="592.03" dur="5.52">fight where we go when we go all what a</text>
  <text start="593.65" dur="6.81">wonderful day queue so that I think is</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="4.62">is profoundly important to talk about</text>
  <text start="600.46" dur="3.48">especially we have people like Tom</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="3.21">Steyer this this guy&amp;#39;s an article that</text>
  <text start="603.94" dur="4.14">came out a couple days ago he&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="605.38" dur="5.97">funneling tens of millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="5.1">into attempts to basically remove</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="4.26">President Trump from office through</text>
  <text start="613.18" dur="4.89">impeachment and this is their goal this</text>
  <text start="615.61" dur="7.26">is their their modus operandi now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.07" dur="6.12">become basically D eath or D legitimize</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="4.11">President Trump and remove him from</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="4.98">office that&amp;#39;s their basic tactic and</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so far it&amp;#39;s having a profound</text>
  <text start="629.17" dur="4.38">effect on the people who are</text>
  <text start="631.78" dur="4.29">unfortunately involved and you have</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="4.44">Peter stroke here with his little bold</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="3.66">patch here on top of the head which I</text>
  <text start="637.99" dur="4.08">thought was interesting because he</text>

  <text start="643.54" dur="4.08">anyone&amp;#39;s bald or not but I just thought</text>
  <text start="645.52" dur="5.31">that was interesting and he there&amp;#39;s him</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="6.75">walking into the hearing which we were</text>
  <text start="650.83" dur="6.78">given basically what I would say what</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="4.59">were insights from by Q into what</text>
  <text start="657.61" dur="3.24">actually happened because if you want to</text>
  <text start="658.96" dur="3.87">get it more information on that in the</text>
  <text start="660.85" dur="3.22">last video I talked about how these</text>
  <text start="662.83" dur="3.22">texts</text>
  <text start="664.07" dur="3.75">or that how this testimony that was</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="4.58">basically being given behind closed</text>
  <text start="667.82" dur="5.25">doors it seems to be quoted to us by cue</text>
  <text start="670.63" dur="4.96">and the questioning in the</text>
  <text start="673.07" dur="4.92">cross-examination or whatever then yeah</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="5.34">I call it interrogation but he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="677.99" dur="5.85">there&amp;#39;s a witness interview or it would</text>
  <text start="680.93" dur="7.85">be it would be testifying as you know a</text>
  <text start="683.84" dur="7.47">witness and he&amp;#39;s saying frankly shocked</text>
  <text start="688.78" dur="5.35">whoever said this Q didn&amp;#39;t give us the</text>
  <text start="691.31" dur="4.77">name of Hussein&amp;#39;s question but it this</text>
  <text start="694.13" dur="3.84">statement is just certainly worth</text>
  <text start="696.08" dur="3.45">reiterating it says mister stroke I</text>
  <text start="697.97" dur="3.66">believe nobody here is buying what</text>
  <text start="699.53" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re selling I believe there was is a</text>
  <text start="701.63" dur="4.74">serious effort on the part of people</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="3.81">more senior than you to remove mr. Trump</text>
  <text start="706.37" dur="3.6">from office out of fear of what this</text>
  <text start="707.99" dur="3.81">administration man cover I believe you</text>
  <text start="709.97" dur="3.69">are being dishonest in your answers and</text>
  <text start="711.8" dur="4.23">frankly shock do you agree to come here</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="4.29">today I believe everyone on this panel -</text>
  <text start="716.03" dur="4.26">those from the other side of the aisle</text>
  <text start="717.95" dur="4.38">knew exactly what your answers would be</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="3.87">and if you think we are going to sit</text>
  <text start="722.33" dur="4.59">here and accept these answers you would</text>
  <text start="724.16" dur="5.76">be a foolish there you would be foolish</text>
  <text start="726.92" dur="6.51">we are also following the facts and once</text>
  <text start="729.92" dur="5.61">we uncover more which we will we will</text>
  <text start="733.43" dur="3.72">act accordingly I&amp;#39;m glad you retained</text>

  <text start="741.34" dur="8.4">excuse me I know my voice is going this</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="9.78">is video number two and just you know</text>
  <text start="749.74" dur="6.16">getting there but that was what the</text>
  <text start="753.71" dur="4.11">sentiment is basically is that we know</text>
  <text start="755.9" dur="3.87">that these people are lying they can go</text>
  <text start="757.82" dur="3.99">in there and say oh well you know my</text>
  <text start="759.77" dur="4.5">text messages don&amp;#39;t reflect any real</text>
  <text start="761.81" dur="4.01">political bias because you know I&amp;#39;m I</text>
  <text start="764.27" dur="6.54">would never let that affect my</text>
  <text start="765.82" dur="8.61">professional capacities but the the</text>
  <text start="770.81" dur="6.39">reality is that the the facts of the the</text>
  <text start="774.43" dur="4.12">sequence of events proved that there was</text>
  <text start="777.2" dur="3.69">a bias and that it was not only</text>
  <text start="778.55" dur="7.08">implemented against presidential but it</text>
  <text start="780.89" dur="6.78">was implemented in a way that was there</text>
  <text start="785.63" dur="3.57">in a way that could implicate so many</text>
  <text start="787.67" dur="5.76">other people in the FBI in the part of</text>
  <text start="789.2" dur="5.79">Justice as being involved and QS giving</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="3.48">us a lot of information in previous</text>
  <text start="794.99" dur="5.55">posts and it you know there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="796.91" dur="5.64">there there that we&amp;#39;re just waiting</text>
  <text start="800.54" dur="5.55">patiently for Congress to do what they</text>
  <text start="802.55" dur="5.31">have to do to get the full paperwork in</text>
  <text start="806.09" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re waiting for inspector general</text>
  <text start="807.86" dur="4.83">Horowitz and John Huber the US Attorney</text>
  <text start="809.72" dur="4.38">to look at filing charges and finishing</text>
  <text start="812.69" dur="3.87">their investigations and bringing</text>
  <text start="814.1" dur="5.42">indictments through grand cherry through</text>
  <text start="816.56" dur="5.4">impaneling grand juries hopefully not in</text>
  <text start="819.52" dur="6.43">the swamp or anywhere near there</text>
  <text start="821.96" dur="6.81">hopefully out and basically anywhere but</text>
  <text start="825.95" dur="5.1">DC or any of the liberal like bastions</text>
  <text start="828.77" dur="5.37">like New York or LA or San Francisco</text>
  <text start="831.05" dur="5.28">like anywhere in the United States</text>
  <text start="834.14" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s not in any of those like anywhere</text>
  <text start="836.33" dur="3.03">in the middle of the United States you</text>
  <text start="837.77" dur="3.78">could just throw a dart basically and</text>
  <text start="839.36" dur="4.26">probably find a good jurisdiction to</text>
  <text start="841.55" dur="5.19">impanel a grand jury to look at evidence</text>
  <text start="843.62" dur="6.36">and partially because most of our people</text>
  <text start="846.74" dur="5.1">in this great country are pretty</text>
  <text start="849.98" dur="3.54">fair-minded and if they see facts</text>
  <text start="851.84" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll make a decision based on</text>
  <text start="853.52" dur="6.24">those facts so I mean with that being</text>
  <text start="855.92" dur="5.88">said it&amp;#39;s kind of like this is where</text>
  <text start="859.76" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re at this is the latest post and</text>
  <text start="861.8" dur="4.41">there is something else that is just</text>
  <text start="864.59" dur="5.01">incredible as to watch the the liberal</text>
  <text start="866.21" dur="5.88">meltdown over Justice Kennedy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="869.6" dur="4.53">retirement they are just in full panic</text>
  <text start="872.09" dur="3.99">mode and what I&amp;#39;ve thought to myself</text>
  <text start="874.13" dur="4.65">about this is that there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="876.08" dur="6.74">that that I think we&amp;#39;re all missing is</text>
  <text start="878.78" dur="8.1">that the timing of Justice Kennedy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="882.82" dur="6.19">stepping down has been well planned by</text>
  <text start="886.88" dur="5.1">the Democrats in my opinion in my</text>
  <text start="889.01" dur="4.92">opinion I don&amp;#39;t know this is just</text>
  <text start="891.98" dur="5.19">speculation at this point but it would</text>
  <text start="893.93" dur="4.5">make perfect sense because just as you</text>
  <text start="897.17" dur="3.18">know if you want to get and it could</text>
  <text start="898.43" dur="4.23">have been construed between President</text>
  <text start="900.35" dur="4.62">Trump and Justice Kennedy together for</text>
  <text start="902.66" dur="4.95">the same effect so I&amp;#39;m not sure who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="904.97" dur="4.92">behind it but I&amp;#39;ll tell you this that</text>
  <text start="907.61" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s gonna definitely push people to go</text>
  <text start="909.89" dur="6.09">out and vote and it&amp;#39;s gonna definitely</text>
  <text start="911.42" dur="6.51">be a point of fear which is people</text>
  <text start="915.98" dur="3.57">understand that you know most of these</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="3.9">politicians they all work off fear they</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="4.38">draw off you know the fear that people</text>
  <text start="921.83" dur="2.66">have and then they use those fears as</text>
  <text start="923.93" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re too</text>
  <text start="924.49" dur="7.98">manages and in doing so with that</text>
  <text start="928.44" dur="6.61">basically as a example or framework</text>
  <text start="932.47" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ll use this to scare their voters</text>
  <text start="935.05" dur="6.15">and to run all types of campaigns so get</text>
  <text start="937.39" dur="6.09">ready November is you know what less</text>
  <text start="941.2" dur="3.9">than six months away now and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="943.48" dur="3.479">going to be the midterm elections and</text>
  <text start="945.1" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re gonna make a huge difference in</text>
  <text start="946.959" dur="5.401">what the second half of president</text>
  <text start="949.24" dur="6.15">Trump&amp;#39;s term in office looks like as far</text>
  <text start="952.36" dur="4.95">as the ability to get more done the</text>
  <text start="955.39" dur="4.11">ability to avoid being impeached and</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="3.51">wasting so much the amount of time that</text>
  <text start="959.5" dur="3.45">an impeachment process would waste</text>
  <text start="960.82" dur="6.51">against the president when they could be</text>
  <text start="962.95" dur="5.82">doing real work as in Congress coming</text>
  <text start="967.33" dur="4.069">together and passing real laws and</text>
  <text start="968.77" dur="7.68">passing real and in reviewing you know</text>
  <text start="971.399" dur="7.031">new pieces of legislation I mean listen</text>
  <text start="976.45" dur="7.77">the amount of time that they was waste</text>
  <text start="978.43" dur="7.95">on that would be unbelievable it would</text>
  <text start="984.22" dur="4.2">be it would be a waste of money it would</text>
  <text start="986.38" dur="3.84">be a waste of time it would probably go</text>
  <text start="988.42" dur="3.419">nowhere and fall flat on its face and</text>
  <text start="990.22" dur="5.97">what would end up happening is it would</text>
  <text start="991.839" dur="5.791">pry I don&amp;#39;t know you know speculatively</text>
  <text start="996.19" dur="2.97">speaking at this point it would be hard</text>
  <text start="997.63" dur="4.23">to tell what the outcome would be my my</text>
  <text start="999.16" dur="6.119">thought would be it would push us as the</text>
  <text start="1001.86" dur="5.64">the Trump base so far past the edge that</text>
  <text start="1005.279" dur="3.991">we would there would be a landslide</text>
  <text start="1007.5" dur="2.79">victory for President Trump in 2020</text>
  <text start="1009.27" dur="4.379">because we would actually come out and</text>
  <text start="1010.29" dur="5.25">vote in full force so you know Walker</text>
  <text start="1013.649" dur="4.621">wait and see how this all plays out but</text>
  <text start="1015.54" dur="4.169">they are really not happy you can see</text>
  <text start="1018.27" dur="3.3">their tweets here where they&amp;#39;re just</text>
