  <text start="606.07" dur="6.48">their families and anyway here we go</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="4.47">this might be a little bit of why</text>
  <text start="612.55" dur="6.06">Jeffrey Epstein was taken out if he was</text>
  <text start="614.95" dur="6.18">taken out if he is not in get mowers you</text>

  <text start="621.13" dur="5.31">protection I don&amp;#39;t know okay all I can</text>
  <text start="624.82" dur="3.75">say is that Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="626.44" dur="4.32">according Sartre achill was considering</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="4.23">cooperating in naming names that&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="4.05">interesting choice of phraseology</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re naming names like we talked</text>
  <text start="634.81" dur="3.779">about on the channel before like he was</text>
  <text start="636.34" dur="4.83">talked about ad nauseam before with</text>
  <text start="638.589" dur="4.5">Rachel Mac or no Rachel Chandler or</text>
  <text start="641.17" dur="5.61">excuse me Allison Mac and then talking</text>
  <text start="643.089" dur="7.011">about Rachel Chandler but naming names</text>
  <text start="646.78" dur="6.66">to reduce his sentence and then very</text>
  <text start="650.1" dur="5.77">quickly thereafter he was found dead hmm</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="7.02">well I wonder right here are the</text>
  <text start="655.87" dur="5.82">Clintons hours after Jeff Rep Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="660.46" dur="3.81">Epstein was found dead they were at this</text>

  <text start="674" dur="3.96">course they were smiling waving it was a</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="4.26">public event but at the same time you</text>
  <text start="677.96" dur="3.51">got to imagine that they were probably</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="4.53">very relieved to know that this</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="5.54">hopefully it was gonna go away and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="684.14" dur="4.8">see if it actually does I doubt it will</text>
  <text start="687.01" dur="2.92">unfortunately for them here&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="3.84">interesting story</text>
  <text start="689.93" dur="4.65">he doesn&amp;#39;t know anything about Epstein</text>
  <text start="692.78" dur="4.08">and his properties one of the properties</text>

  <text start="991.73" dur="3.93">hoax narrative that was put together by</text>
  <text start="993.829" dur="4.411">the deep State against President Trump</text>
  <text start="995.66" dur="4.919">to portray him as having these deep</text>
  <text start="998.24" dur="4.23">connections to Oleg Deripaska when the</text>
  <text start="1000.579" dur="4.081">reality is that it was the Clintons and</text>

  <text start="1006.49" dur="4.5">backdoor dealings with Oleg Deripaska</text>
  <text start="1008.43" dur="5.02">but what&amp;#39;s interesting to note is that</text>
  <text start="1010.99" dur="3.9">in April 2000 18 when the US Department</text>
  <text start="1013.45" dur="4.44">of Treasury put these sanctions out</text>

  <text start="1798.97" dur="3.09">one these episodes called God&amp;#39;s grace is</text>
  <text start="1800.59" dur="3.54">greater when we talk about God&amp;#39;s grace</text>
  <text start="1802.06" dur="4.68">and how it is truly greater and for this</text>
  <text start="1804.13" dur="4.59">one we&amp;#39;re gonna read it really short but</text>
  <text start="1806.74" dur="4.14">but an important piece of scripture it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1808.72" dur="4.56">out of the book of Philippians chapter 3</text>
  <text start="1810.88" dur="5.07">verse 12 it says and this is talking</text>
  <text start="1813.28" dur="5.13">about reaching forward to God&amp;#39;s goals it</text>
  <text start="1815.95" dur="5.58">says not that I have already reached the</text>
  <text start="1818.41" dur="5.07">goal or I&amp;#39;m already fully mature but I</text>
  <text start="1821.53" dur="4.2">make every effort to take hold of it</text>
  <text start="1823.48" dur="6.06">because I also have been taken hold of</text>
  <text start="1825.73" dur="5.13">by Christ Jesus and that&amp;#39;s the way we</text>
  <text start="1829.54" dur="4.89">should live our lives ladies and</text>
  <text start="1830.86" dur="6.21">gentlemen I implore you to see this and</text>
  <text start="1834.43" dur="6">remember that God loves you and remember</text>
  <text start="1837.07" dur="5.31">that we may not have reached the</text>
  <text start="1840.43" dur="4.2">pinnacle of where we&amp;#39;re going to be we</text>
  <text start="1842.38" dur="4.95">may be in a lull or we may be in a high</text>
  <text start="1844.63" dur="5.88">we may be somewhere in between but we</text>
  <text start="1847.33" dur="6.3">have to remember that we if we make the</text>
  <text start="1850.51" dur="5.91">effort to take hold of that incredible</text>
  <text start="1853.63" dur="5.03">gift that God gives us if we do that</text>
  <text start="1856.42" dur="5.49">every single day</text>
  <text start="1858.66" dur="5.29">then we put our lives to God and Jesus</text>
  <text start="1861.91" dur="4.53">comes into our hearts and the Holy</text>
  <text start="1863.95" dur="4.8">Spirit fills us and God is over watching</text>
  <text start="1866.44" dur="4.74">over us and protecting us and that is</text>
  <text start="1868.75" dur="3.99">what life is about in my opinion so</text>
