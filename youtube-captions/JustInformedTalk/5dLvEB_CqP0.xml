  <text start="26.13" dur="3.149">as information is made available to me I</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="4.83">make it available to you now we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="7.921">get right into it where basically I made</text>
  <text start="32.279" dur="7.321">a an error this picture is not related</text>
  <text start="37.2" dur="4.71">to Hawaii whatsoever and I apologized</text>
  <text start="39.6" dur="6.42">for basically putting it in there I</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="5.669">never examine this story that far and it</text>
  <text start="46.02" dur="3.629">was just kind of falling out of my</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="3.781">memory so I finally got it back but you</text>
  <text start="49.649" dur="4.32">guys corrected me pretty instantly and</text>
  <text start="51.36" dur="6.539">it&amp;#39;s referring obviously now in</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="5.881">retrospect to the whip Whidbey missile</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="5.9">launch now what this is is talking about</text>
  <text start="59.85" dur="7.25">a set of weather cameras there are</text>
  <text start="63.799" dur="5.771">webcam setup by skunk bay weather.com</text>
  <text start="67.1" dur="6.42">and these are monitoring an area of</text>
  <text start="69.57" dur="7.77">Washington and in Washington we had this</text>
  <text start="73.52" dur="5.68">anomaly the camera actually picked up</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="4.68">what would appear to be a missile being</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="4.02">launched now this has a lot to do with</text>
  <text start="82.02" dur="4.739">everything that we covered in the last</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="6.719">video so it&amp;#39;s not much in here is wrong</text>
  <text start="86.759" dur="4.5">other than the point of me not getting</text>
  <text start="89.939" dur="3.301">that this was two separate events</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="3.391">besides the fact that there was the</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="3.989">Hawaii event and that this was not a</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="5.009">video from that event it was a video</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="5.521">from this skunk May event so I misspoke</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="4.771">and I apologize for that but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="4.85">making the clarification here so that</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="5.549">you guys get the truth as it is so</text>
  <text start="107.6" dur="4.57">what&amp;#39;s interesting about all this well</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="9.03">first off you have the media trying to</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="8.79">portray this as a airplane they want to</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="4.281">tell you that that&amp;#39;s a chemtrail so that</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="4.979">the picture that you&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="123.29" dur="4.839">basically a chemtrail that&amp;#39;s being hit</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="4.591">by the Sun in a certain way</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="5.011">and that there&amp;#39;s no possible way that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="6.5">missile that&amp;#39;s what this story</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="6.72">goes on to say if you could believe that</text>
  <text start="137.03" dur="5.23">and they&amp;#39;re talking about how it was</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="4.65">picked up by this camera it kind of</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="4.47">shows the vectors of the camera here if</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="4.23">you guys want to see that and they say</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="5.37">that it was picked up by camera for</text>
  <text start="148.74" dur="5.82">which they said is a wider angle view of</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="5.46">this camera to section so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="6.69">looking at it this is the the you know</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="8.12">water inlets of Washington Washington</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="8.31">State and it&amp;#39;s picked up this actual I</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="6.339">believe rocket being fired but that is</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="4.38">my take on it now we can go ahead and</text>
  <text start="172.019" dur="3.901">just examine that in the evidence but</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="5.19">here&amp;#39;s an incredible piece given to us</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="5.64">by an aunt on who&amp;#39;s talking about what</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="4.47">this rocket may have meant and I thought</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="4.5">this was very important says to clarify</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="5.25">one a narrative was push that China can</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="5.36">hack us subs think hack and it&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="188.85" dur="5.58">are post looking back at cue post</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="5.909">highlighting them the sub was hacked by</text>
  <text start="194.43" dur="6.57">black hats those expletive with its</text>
  <text start="197.329" dur="5.591">communication are effing with its</text>
  <text start="201" dur="5.13">communications rendering it with only</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="5.4">one channel of comms calm start this</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="4.41">channel led to the mole in Washington</text>
  <text start="208.32" dur="4.5">who ordered the captain to shoot the</text>
  <text start="210.54" dur="4.949">captain unable to verify or contact</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="5.43">anyone else had to follow the order the</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="5.551">missile was intercepted by f-16s using a</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="6.18">classified weapon system I thought this</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="7.59">was a great interpretation of exactly</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="7.619">what happened because it&amp;#39;s told to us</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="8.4">later here that it was washed and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="7.291">like what does that mean right so a</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="4.17">couple posts later you actually see Q as</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="4.05">in response from Han on an on says who</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="5.19">has the authority to launch a missile q</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="5.099">said unauthorized so and then Q response</text>
  <text start="246.39" dur="4.11">given chain of command process to launch</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="5.941">what does this tell you classified</text>
  <text start="250.5" dur="5.88">remove Washington minutes after and</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s being suggested here is</text>
  <text start="256.38" dur="3.63">that somebody okay so let&amp;#39;s put this</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="2.699">together</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="5.629">China can hack the communications</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="7.381">between the subs and Washington</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="6.071">presumably the Pentagon and if they were</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="6.209">able to do that and convince one of our</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="7.259">own subs that it&amp;#39;s been ordered to</text>
  <text start="275.639" dur="6.33">launch a missile that would be a hacked</text>
  <text start="278.969" dur="4.95">right and if they were also able to</text>
  <text start="281.969" dur="3.841">convince that sub that there were no</text>
  <text start="283.919" dur="3.75">other form of communications available</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.71">to it because it&amp;#39;s a submarine and</text>
  <text start="287.669" dur="5.071">completely out there in the open</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="3.75">vulnerable I mean if they get an order</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="3.449">and they can&amp;#39;t verify it they have to</text>
  <text start="294.27" dur="4.139">assume that we&amp;#39;re in some kind of war</text>
  <text start="296.189" dur="4.98">type situation so they&amp;#39;re probably going</text>
  <text start="298.409" dur="4.021">to launch that missile just</text>
  <text start="301.169" dur="5.041">hypothetically speaking</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="5.699">it says the channel that was used to</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="6.81">order the captain of the sub to shoot</text>
  <text start="308.129" dur="7.201">the missile led back to whoever this</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="2.699">person in Washington or the Pentagon or</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="3.929">wherever</text>
  <text start="315.719" dur="5.79">was giving that order see that order was</text>
  <text start="319.259" dur="3.331">coordinated with an attack on the comms</text>
  <text start="321.509" dur="3.27">of the sub</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="5.189">this is just all conjectures so</text>
  <text start="324.779" dur="5.491">speculation it says the captain was</text>
  <text start="327.779" dur="5.07">unable to verify or contact anyone else</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="4.649">and had to follow that order so imagine</text>
  <text start="332.849" dur="4.171">if you have a commanding officer who</text>
  <text start="334.919" dur="5.041">calls you up say an admiral in the</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="5.549">pentagon and says we need you to strike</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="4.59">this target immediately and then you</text>
  <text start="342.569" dur="4.34">have some sort of secondary verification</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="5.31">system but it&amp;#39;s completely offline and</text>
  <text start="346.909" dur="4.241">maybe the situation&amp;#39;s portrayed to you</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="4.709">that you&amp;#39;re in some kind of imminent</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="4.859">threat danger position as a captain of a</text>
  <text start="354.569" dur="3.541">sub just like he&amp;#39;s a captain of a ship</text>
  <text start="356.009" dur="3.571">or a captain of anything you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="5.1">have to make that decision and you have</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="7.38">the authority in the moment to make a</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="5.609">decision based on what circumstances are</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="3.359">presented to you at the moment that is a</text>
  <text start="368.819" dur="4.65">part of leadership that is a part of</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="5.761">being a person of action and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="373.469" dur="3.87">kind of people we want running our ships</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="4.369">and doing these kind of things</text>
  <text start="377.339" dur="5.85">but that can be used against them and</text>
  <text start="380.449" dur="4.481">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s being explained here then</text>
  <text start="383.189" dur="3.391">it says the f-16s were brought in to</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="3.72">shoot down that missile and this is</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="3.03">after Hawaii so Hawaii was something</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="4.489">totally different</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="3.529">Hawaii was the</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="5.41">message on the cellphone saying that</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="5.31">missile threat was inbound whatever</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="3.69">happened there I mean you have basically</text>
  <text start="401.86" dur="3.899">cue saying that</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="4.74">POTUS went and rerouted I mean what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="405.759" dur="3.361">taken from it is that POTUS went to</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="5.07">Hawaii to collect the information</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="5.609">himself based on off of what happened</text>
  <text start="412.93" dur="7.319">doing an investigation because if this</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="8.52">is actually happening where somehow the</text>
  <text start="420.249" dur="8.13">Chinese in conjunction with deep state</text>
  <text start="423.249" dur="7.5">evil scum have decided to sell our</text>
  <text start="428.379" dur="5.1">country out and do these kind of things</text>
  <text start="430.749" dur="4.2">then it would be it only makes sense</text>
  <text start="433.479" dur="2.52">that the president United States would</text>
  <text start="434.949" dur="3.75">have to go there for himself and say</text>
  <text start="435.999" dur="5.1">look what is going on here what kind of</text>
  <text start="438.699" dur="5.041">madness have we unleashed with you</text>
  <text start="441.099" dur="4.921">people here running the station and</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="5.459">putting out this alert whether the the</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="4.56">missile threat was real or not right and</text>
  <text start="449.199" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;ve already said you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="4.739">rogue subs was that a missing sub was it</text>
  <text start="453.039" dur="4.731">some kind of in Hawaii was there an</text>
  <text start="455.319" dur="5.34">actual threat was the sub destroyed I</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="3.85">don&amp;#39;t know I wish I had those answers I</text>
  <text start="460.659" dur="2.88">wish I could give them to you</text>
  <text start="461.62" dur="3.389">but I can only report to you what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="463.539" dur="3.63">talked about so far and I want to make</text>
  <text start="465.009" dur="4.02">this this clear because I got it kind of</text>
  <text start="467.169" dur="4.92">wrong in the last video and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="469.029" dur="4.681">kind of go over what exactly could have</text>
  <text start="472.089" dur="3.121">happened one of the possibilities are on</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="6.739">what we should be really focusing on</text>
  <text start="475.21" dur="7.079">which is what happened up in Washington</text>
  <text start="480.449" dur="5.171">what does this all have to do with</text>
  <text start="482.289" dur="5.25">anything right so that being said that</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="3.569">was an interesting piece of one to bring</text>
  <text start="487.539" dur="5.821">back to your attention to go ahead and</text>
  <text start="489.189" dur="6.121">just review it one more time now I think</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="4.41">I got a lot of the stuff all my thoughts</text>
  <text start="495.31" dur="4.74">on Facebook and China were pretty pretty</text>
  <text start="497.77" dur="3.629">spot-on I&amp;#39;m not going to go over any of</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="3.03">that again if you guys want to get those</text>
  <text start="501.399" dur="4.311">they&amp;#39;re definitely in this video and</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="5.669">it&amp;#39;s worth a watch even though you know</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="7.3">they D monetize everything right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.749" dur="5.761">fun yeah whatever I don&amp;#39;t care I care</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="2.969">about getting the message out I care</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="4.62">about getting God&amp;#39;s Word out I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="5.37">care about the money for one second it</text>
  <text start="519.13" dur="4.409">that is the the last thing motivating me</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="4.011">the first thing is God the second thing</text>
  <text start="523.539" dur="4.011">is my patriotic duty</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="5.61">country and my love of my family and the</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="6.3">third thing is being able to provide for</text>
  <text start="530.97" dur="5.01">my family so I do put that on the back</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="4.89">burner sometimes and to my own detriment</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="5.16">but that&amp;#39;s fine because I&amp;#39;m here</text>
  <text start="538.74" dur="4.14">literally blessed to be able to bring</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="3.03">you guys this information and if you</text>
  <text start="542.88" dur="3">guys want to catch up on it I encourage</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="4.47">you to watch these videos that they try</text>
  <text start="545.88" dur="6.42">to basically keep you from from watching</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="5.61">in because I&amp;#39;m just convinced that when</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="4.469">they Deamonte I stuff it&amp;#39;s all gets</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="5.7">d-list if it gets because what is the</text>
  <text start="556.769" dur="4.831">incentive for them to put my video first</text>
  <text start="559.95" dur="3.75">if it&amp;#39;s not monetized I mean that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="5.46">whole thing that I don&amp;#39;t get is like</text>
  <text start="563.7" dur="5.49">what would be their their incentive to</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="3.149">even advertise my video at all cuz</text>
  <text start="569.19" dur="3.329">they&amp;#39;re not going to make any money off</text>

  <text start="1265.01" dur="7.41">your hearts and it&amp;#39;s from first Timothy</text>
  <text start="1268.67" dur="5.16">chapter 4 through chapter through the</text>
  <text start="1272.42" dur="3.15">beginning of chapter 5 and it talks</text>
  <text start="1273.83" dur="4.41">about three things it talks about that</text>
  <text start="1275.57" dur="4.92">the demonic influence that&amp;#39;s manifesting</text>
  <text start="1278.24" dur="3.84">itself all around us in this world it</text>
  <text start="1280.49" dur="3.12">talks about what it means to be a good</text>
  <text start="1282.08" dur="3.39">servant of Jesus Christ and then it</text>
  <text start="1283.61" dur="5.01">talks about what are the instructions</text>
  <text start="1285.47" dur="7.11">for those who want to practice ministry</text>
  <text start="1288.62" dur="6.78">and these three you know succinct points</text>
  <text start="1292.58" dur="3.93">I think outline exactly my thoughts and</text>
  <text start="1295.4" dur="4.71">I want to just share them with you</text>
  <text start="1296.51" dur="7.59">because sometimes most all the time</text>
  <text start="1300.11" dur="7.83">God&amp;#39;s words are far more influential and</text>
  <text start="1304.1" dur="6.17">better than mine unless God speaking</text>
  <text start="1307.94" dur="6.06">through me and then it&amp;#39;s our words but</text>
  <text start="1310.27" dur="6.67">now it says chapter four first Timothy</text>
  <text start="1314" dur="5.07">now the spirit explicitly says that in</text>
  <text start="1316.94" dur="4.26">the latter times some will depart from</text>
  <text start="1319.07" dur="3.18">the faith paying attention to deceitful</text>
  <text start="1321.2" dur="3.599">spirits and the teacher</text>
  <text start="1322.25" dur="5.4">of demons through the hypocrisy of liars</text>
  <text start="1324.799" dur="4.651">whose conscience azar seared they forbid</text>
  <text start="1327.65" dur="5.49">marriage and demand abstinence from</text>
  <text start="1329.45" dur="5.88">though from foods that God created to be</text>
  <text start="1333.14" dur="4.47">received with gratitude by those who</text>
  <text start="1335.33" dur="4.32">believe and know the truth for</text>
  <text start="1337.61" dur="4.59">everything created by God is good and</text>
  <text start="1339.65" dur="4.86">nothing should be rejected if it is</text>
  <text start="1342.2" dur="4.859">received with Thanksgiving since it is</text>
  <text start="1344.51" dur="8.1">sanctified by the Word of God and by</text>
  <text start="1347.059" dur="8.221">prayer hmm if you point these things out</text>
  <text start="1352.61" dur="4.949">to the brothers you will be a good</text>
  <text start="1355.28" dur="4.32">servant of Christ Jesus nourished by the</text>
  <text start="1357.559" dur="4.86">words of the faith and of the good</text>
  <text start="1359.6" dur="6.03">teaching that you have followed but have</text>
  <text start="1362.419" dur="6.091">nothing to do with irreverent and silly</text>
  <text start="1365.63" dur="5.22">myths rather train yourself in godliness</text>
  <text start="1368.51" dur="4.68">for the training of the body has a</text>
  <text start="1370.85" dur="4.23">limited benefit but godliness is</text>
  <text start="1373.19" dur="4.5">beneficial in every way since it holds</text>
  <text start="1375.08" dur="5.43">promise for the present life and also</text>
  <text start="1377.69" dur="4.32">for the life to come this saying is</text>
  <text start="1380.51" dur="4.799">trustworthy and deserves full acceptance</text>
  <text start="1382.01" dur="5.85">in fact we labor and strive for this</text>
  <text start="1385.309" dur="4.921">because we have put our hope in living</text>
  <text start="1387.86" dur="7.89">God who is the savior of everyone</text>
  <text start="1390.23" dur="7.829">especially of those who believe command</text>
  <text start="1395.75" dur="6">and teach these things no one should</text>
  <text start="1398.059" dur="6">despise your youth instead you should be</text>
  <text start="1401.75" dur="4.94">an example to the believers in speech</text>
  <text start="1404.059" dur="6.151">and conduct in love and faith in purity</text>
  <text start="1406.69" dur="6.76">until I have come give your attention to</text>
  <text start="1410.21" dur="6.329">public reading exhortation and teaching</text>
  <text start="1413.45" dur="6.77">do not neglect the gift that is in you</text>
  <text start="1416.539" dur="7.02">it was given to you through prophecy</text>
  <text start="1420.22" dur="6.1">with the laying on the hands by the</text>
  <text start="1423.559" dur="5.431">Council of the elders practice these</text>
  <text start="1426.32" dur="5.4">things be committed to them so that your</text>
  <text start="1428.99" dur="5.46">progress may be evident to all be</text>
  <text start="1431.72" dur="6.72">conscious about yourself and your</text>
  <text start="1434.45" dur="8.25">teaching preserve or persevere in these</text>
  <text start="1438.44" dur="7.44">things for by doing this you will save</text>
  <text start="1442.7" dur="5.64">both yourself and your hears do not</text>
  <text start="1445.88" dur="5.549">rebuke an older man but exhort him as a</text>
  <text start="1448.34" dur="5.37">father younger men as brothers older</text>
  <text start="1451.429" dur="3.121">women as mothers and with all propriety</text>
  <text start="1453.71" dur="9.66">younger women</text>
  <text start="1454.55" dur="10.98">as sisters yeah so you know we&amp;#39;ll kind</text>
  <text start="1463.37" dur="3.57">of break it down one by one in three</text>
  <text start="1465.53" dur="4.05">different points first it talks about</text>
  <text start="1466.94" dur="5.16">demonic influence and what stood out to</text>
  <text start="1469.58" dur="5.7">me in that that little piece of verse</text>
  <text start="1472.1" dur="5.22">there is it says in the latter times</text>
  <text start="1475.28" dur="3.93">some will depart from the faith paying</text>
  <text start="1477.32" dur="4.77">attention to deceitful spirits and the</text>
  <text start="1479.21" dur="6.33">teachings of demons and that is so true</text>
  <text start="1482.09" dur="5.85">of the time we are in today here there</text>
  <text start="1485.54" dur="4.32">are people out there who just believe in</text>
  <text start="1487.94" dur="3.9">this evil and they subscribe to it and</text>
  <text start="1489.86" dur="4.86">they can&amp;#39;t get enough of it it&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1491.84" dur="5.43">drives their their lives and it&amp;#39;s sick</text>
  <text start="1494.72" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s sad but then it says to be a</text>
  <text start="1497.27" dur="4.83">good servant of Christ you must train</text>
  <text start="1499.37" dur="5.64">your body to love God but you must train</text>
  <text start="1502.1" dur="4.92">in a way that is beneficial to not just</text>
  <text start="1505.01" dur="4.83">your life here on earth but your</text>
  <text start="1507.02" dur="6.12">afterlife so train your mind to think in</text>
  <text start="1509.84" dur="6.42">a way that&amp;#39;s bigger than our own</text>
  <text start="1513.14" dur="5.1">existence here on earth understanding</text>
  <text start="1516.26" dur="5.01">that when we die it&amp;#39;s not something to</text>
  <text start="1518.24" dur="5.24">be scared of and to be dreaded it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1521.27" dur="7.17">a point of reuniting ourselves with God</text>
  <text start="1523.48" dur="7.27">and to start a whole new journey but</text>
  <text start="1528.44" dur="5.31">then when I took the most from is where</text>
  <text start="1530.75" dur="5.67">gives the instructions for ministry it</text>
  <text start="1533.75" dur="5.31">says if you&amp;#39;re going to command and</text>
  <text start="1536.42" dur="6.51">teach these things no one should despise</text>
  <text start="1539.06" dur="6.66">your youth it says instead you should be</text>
  <text start="1542.93" dur="5.04">an example in your speech in your</text>
  <text start="1545.72" dur="5.28">conduct and your love and your faith in</text>
  <text start="1547.97" dur="6.57">your purity and until Christ returns to</text>
  <text start="1551" dur="9">earth you must present it with you must</text>
  <text start="1554.54" dur="11.22">present it in to the public in readings</text>
  <text start="1560" dur="7.26">and exhortation and teachings and this</text>
  <text start="1565.76" dur="4.92">is the part of the most it says do not</text>
  <text start="1567.26" dur="6.27">neglect the gift that is in you we all</text>
  <text start="1570.68" dur="8.07">have a gift in us some of us have many</text>
  <text start="1573.53" dur="7.35">gifts but for me my gift is to be able</text>
  <text start="1578.75" dur="6.44">to speak to be able to tell you guys</text>
  <text start="1580.88" dur="7.44">about God his love and the truth</text>
  <text start="1585.19" dur="4.72">these things are what would motivate me</text>
  <text start="1588.32" dur="3.3">these are my gifts your gifts may be</text>
  <text start="1589.91" dur="3.45">different you can spread your own</text>
