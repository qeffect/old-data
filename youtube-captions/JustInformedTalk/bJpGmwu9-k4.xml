  <text start="985.5" dur="4.47">Trump sending a message to the deep</text>
  <text start="986.79" dur="4.219">state saying every this is so funny the</text>
  <text start="989.97" dur="2.76">way it happens there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="991.009" dur="3.94">interpretations of this and I want to</text>
  <text start="992.73" dur="4.08">give them both to you because I&amp;#39;m I do</text>
  <text start="994.949" dur="5.041">my best to be fair the one</text>
  <text start="996.81" dur="5.31">interpretation is the let me explain the</text>
  <text start="999.99" dur="3.39">lights went out so the lights went out</text>
  <text start="1002.12" dur="4.199">right when President Trump was talking</text>
  <text start="1003.38" dur="4.55">about what happened with NATO and his</text>
  <text start="1006.319" dur="4.071">commitments to them</text>
  <text start="1007.93" dur="4.5">and how getting them to pay more money</text>
  <text start="1010.39" dur="4.83">was a good thing and so on and so forth</text>
  <text start="1012.43" dur="4.68">but the lights go out on President Trump</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="3.72">and it&amp;#39;s a direct message and you can</text>
  <text start="1017.11" dur="4.35">see he tenses up and puts his you know</text>
  <text start="1018.94" dur="4.77">crosses his arms which is a embody</text>
  <text start="1021.46" dur="5.25">language that&amp;#39;s a sign of basically I</text>
  <text start="1023.71" dur="6.21">would say tension at least and he</text>
  <text start="1026.71" dur="5.37">realizes that he needs to read from the</text>
  <text start="1029.92" dur="6.18">script because the whole front portion</text>
  <text start="1032.08" dur="6.27">of the press conference up to now he is</text>
  <text start="1036.1" dur="4.68">very comfortable very relaxed he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1038.35" dur="5.4">looking up he&amp;#39;s talking to the OP that</text>
  <text start="1040.78" dur="4.38">the press and it&amp;#39;s at the moment that</text>
  <text start="1043.75" dur="4.34">lights go out you can see there&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1045.16" dur="5.82">of a tension and then there&amp;#39;s an urgent</text>
  <text start="1048.09" dur="4.99">motivation behind him to read the script</text>
  <text start="1050.98" dur="5.34">or to read what&amp;#39;s in front of him and</text>
  <text start="1053.08" dur="5.01">that to me could be many things he could</text>
  <text start="1056.32" dur="3.84">have been a signal that he asked them to</text>
  <text start="1058.09" dur="4.5">give him whatever or it could have been</text>
  <text start="1060.16" dur="5.07">a signal that was sent him unbeknownst I</text>
  <text start="1062.59" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t tell you that because I&amp;#39;m not the</text>
  <text start="1065.23" dur="4.29">president and I&amp;#39;m not anybody near the</text>
  <text start="1066.82" dur="5.7">president at this point so I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="1069.52" dur="5.07">this though it&amp;#39;s suspect to me that</text>
  <text start="1072.52" dur="3.87">there is no explanation other than oh</text>
  <text start="1074.59" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s raining and I guess the power went</text>
  <text start="1076.39" dur="3.21">out there did a power surge at the White</text>
  <text start="1077.89" dur="3.84">House but you would think if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1079.6" dur="3.12">anywhere or somebody hit the light</text>
  <text start="1081.73" dur="3.42">switch by accident</text>
  <text start="1082.72" dur="5.16">you know I can&amp;#39;t give you an explanation</text>
  <text start="1085.15" dur="5.87">for that right other than it was really</text>
  <text start="1087.88" dur="3.14">interesting timing</text>
  <text start="1092.81" dur="3.07">[Music]</text>
  <text start="1118.44" dur="5.67">in fact a very good thing we&amp;#39;re nuclear</text>
  <text start="1121.649" dur="4.801">powers great nuclear powers Russia and</text>
  <text start="1124.11" dur="3.899">us have 90 percent of the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1126.45" dur="4.349">weapons so I&amp;#39;ve always felt getting</text>
  <text start="1128.009" dur="5.461">along is a positive thing and not just</text>
  <text start="1130.799" dur="5.13">for that reason I entered the meeting</text>
  <text start="1133.47" dur="4.679">with the firm conviction that diplomacy</text>
  <text start="1135.929" dur="5.97">and engagement is better than hostility</text>
  <text start="1138.149" dur="6.48">and conflict with everybody we have 29</text>
  <text start="1141.899" dur="4.86">members in NATO as an example and I have</text>
  <text start="1144.629" dur="5.25">great relationships or at least very</text>
  <text start="1146.759" dur="5.941">good relationships with everybody the</text>
  <text start="1149.879" dur="4.89">press covered it quite inaccurately they</text>
  <text start="1152.7" dur="4.74">said I insulted people well it&amp;#39;s asking</text>
  <text start="1154.769" dur="5.851">for people to pay up money that they are</text>
  <text start="1157.44" dur="5.609">supposed to pay is insulting maybe I did</text>
  <text start="1160.62" dur="5.46">but I can tell you when I left everybody</text>
  <text start="1163.049" dur="7.521">was thrilled and that&amp;#39;s the way this was</text>
  <text start="1166.08" dur="7.17">to my meeting with President Putin was</text>
  <text start="1170.57" dur="3.969">really interesting in so many different</text>
  <text start="1173.25" dur="3.21">ways because we haven&amp;#39;t had</text>
  <text start="1174.539" dur="6.421">relationships with Russia for a long</text>
  <text start="1176.46" dur="8.16">time and we started let me begin by</text>
  <text start="1180.96" dur="7.049">saying that once again the full faith</text>
  <text start="1184.62" dur="6.57">and support for America&amp;#39;s intelligence</text>
  <text start="1188.009" dur="5.88">agencies I have a full faith in our</text>
  <text start="1191.19" dur="3.9">intelligence agencies whoops they just</text>
  <text start="1193.889" dur="8.611">turned off the light that must be the</text>
  <text start="1195.09" dur="10.559">intelligence agents okay well I mean</text>
  <text start="1202.5" dur="6.539">guys I&amp;#39;m maybe somebody leaned up</text>
  <text start="1205.649" dur="4.351">against a light switch but after reading</text>
  <text start="1209.039" dur="3.75">all this stuff</text>
  <text start="1210" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s literally hard to believe that and</text>
  <text start="1212.789" dur="5.071">you can see the body language I mean</text>
  <text start="1214.5" dur="6.12">look at his arms across he obviously was</text>
  <text start="1217.86" dur="4.35">going low what happened I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1220.62" dur="4.169">what I read I&amp;#39;m not a body language</text>
  <text start="1222.21" dur="6.36">expert by any means but you know just</text>
  <text start="1224.789" dur="6.63">general intuition here and taking that</text>
  <text start="1228.57" dur="4.229">it&amp;#39;s really disconcerting to me to think</text>
  <text start="1231.419" dur="3.061">when he starts talking about the</text>
  <text start="1232.799" dur="4.651">intelligence agencies they make a point</text>
  <text start="1234.48" dur="4.74">to turn the lights off on him but what</text>
  <text start="1237.45" dur="6.209">it could be talking to is something very</text>
  <text start="1239.22" dur="7.169">positive as well so let&amp;#39;s think about</text>
  <text start="1243.659" dur="4.47">what that positive could be well what</text>
  <text start="1246.389" dur="3.821">the positive could be is something that</text>
  <text start="1248.129" dur="4.541">is associated with the</text>

  <text start="1252.67" dur="4.95">giving to us by Q over and over again so</text>
  <text start="1255.22" dur="4.38">when he talks about intelligence it</text>
  <text start="1257.62" dur="4.86">could be a signal that it is from the</text>
  <text start="1259.6" dur="4.83">dark to the light that it is happening</text>
  <text start="1262.48" dur="3.96">and president Trump crosses arms all the</text>
  <text start="1264.43" dur="4.65">time not something to be really looked</text>
  <text start="1266.44" dur="5.31">into too closely but I will say this</text>
  <text start="1269.08" dur="5.55">that in watching this clip and watching</text>
  <text start="1271.75" dur="6.6">his press conference where I&amp;#39;ll explain</text>
  <text start="1274.63" dur="6.98">president Trump&amp;#39;s misspoke he said in</text>
  <text start="1278.35" dur="6.36">response to Putin he said something very</text>
  <text start="1281.61" dur="4.84">important that he misspoke on where he</text>

  <text start="1286.45" dur="35.27">explain further and I&amp;#39;ve said this many</text>
  <text start="1319.03" dur="6.75">times I accept our intelligence</text>

  <text start="1448.92" dur="4.44">president reinstates and that to me is</text>
  <text start="1450.72" dur="4.32">scary because these this media is</text>
  <text start="1453.36" dur="4.08">supposedly representing the American</text>

  <text start="1480.15" dur="7.17">on one of these pages to a handwritten</text>

  <text start="1490.14" dur="6.6">message to basically the entire country</text>
  <text start="1493.77" dur="5.73">that this is something that you need to</text>
  <text start="1496.74" dur="3.9">look at but the media glanced right over</text>

  <text start="2794.07" dur="6.99">gonna talk about today is God God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2796.77" dur="8.04">grace more specifically but a prayer or</text>
  <text start="2801.06" dur="7.5">a prayer of thankfulness that was sent</text>
  <text start="2804.81" dur="5.72">up by the annual after he realized that</text>

  <text start="2810.53" dur="7.42">interpret King Nebuchadnezzar&amp;#39;s dreams</text>
  <text start="2814.2" dur="6.51">now what&amp;#39;s interesting is that Daniels</text>
  <text start="2817.95" dur="5.13">story is very similar to what a lot of</text>
  <text start="2820.71" dur="3.99">Patriots go through I know a lot of you</text>
  <text start="2823.08" dur="3.21">out there probably feel like Daniel at</text>
  <text start="2824.7" dur="4.38">times when you get persecuted for</text>
  <text start="2826.29" dur="5.13">sharing information and talking to your</text>
  <text start="2829.08" dur="4.44">friends just in a truthful truthful</text>
  <text start="2831.42" dur="4.32">manner because a lot of the people out</text>
  <text start="2833.52" dur="4.62">there are so brainwashed that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2835.74" dur="3.99">relate to you and it makes it almost</text>
  <text start="2838.14" dur="4.46">impossible for you to have a</text>
  <text start="2839.73" dur="5.85">conversation and say look</text>
  <text start="2842.6" dur="4.39">why are we not upset at Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="2845.58" dur="3.69">why are we why are we trying to protect</text>
  <text start="2846.99" dur="4.5">her why are we trying to protect a</text>
  <text start="2849.27" dur="5.88">corrupt Democrats why are we trying to</text>
  <text start="2851.49" dur="5.82">protect corrupt neocon Republicans why</text>
  <text start="2855.15" dur="5.31">are we trying to protect those who are</text>
  <text start="2857.31" dur="4.86">trying to undermine our democracy that</text>
  <text start="2860.46" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;ve established through our republic</text>
  <text start="2862.17" dur="5.16">and why are we trying to attack those</text>
  <text start="2864.75" dur="4.7">who are trying to support defend our</text>
  <text start="2867.33" dur="5.34">president and the Constitution</text>
  <text start="2869.45" dur="6.85">simultaneously these things happen all</text>
  <text start="2872.67" dur="6.06">the time and it&amp;#39;s become so rampant in</text>
  <text start="2876.3" dur="7.35">our society that I think it warrants an</text>
  <text start="2878.73" dur="6.96">addressing because at this point they</text>
  <text start="2883.65" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re in all-out war mode and</text>
  <text start="2885.69" dur="5.31">I want to read something to you guys</text>
  <text start="2887.34" dur="7.2">from a friend of mine before we go into</text>
  <text start="2891" dur="6.27">this verse but it&amp;#39;s gonna point to</text>
  <text start="2894.54" dur="3.51">everything so this is a friend of mine</text>
  <text start="2897.27" dur="2.4">writing to me</text>
  <text start="2898.05" dur="3">and before we read this verse I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2899.67" dur="4.59">Daniel I want to mention this because</text>
  <text start="2901.05" dur="5.4">this is somebody who I really trust and</text>
  <text start="2904.26" dur="4.65">respect and I think that they give sage</text>
  <text start="2906.45" dur="4.11">advice and they do their best to tell me</text>
  <text start="2908.91" dur="4.02">what is right and what is wrong but it</text>
  <text start="2910.56" dur="2.97">says in regard to what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="2912.93" dur="4.5">the world</text>
  <text start="2913.53" dur="6.27">I do not know what will if anything</text>
  <text start="2917.43" dur="6.24">happened or get her to jail talking</text>
  <text start="2919.8" dur="6.12">about HRC my personal opinion is it</text>
  <text start="2923.67" dur="4.62">won&amp;#39;t happen and she won&amp;#39;t go to jail</text>
  <text start="2925.92" dur="5.58">and if anything something more dramatic</text>
  <text start="2928.29" dur="6.39">war is coming in my eyes and there is</text>
  <text start="2931.5" dur="6.33">just no way to avoid it I hope it</text>
  <text start="2934.68" dur="5.4">doesn&amp;#39;t but I just don&amp;#39;t see how it</text>
  <text start="2937.83" dur="4.62">won&amp;#39;t given the global climate players</text>
  <text start="2940.08" dur="4.41">involved and what is going on in Europe</text>
  <text start="2942.45" dur="4.02">there is no way Russia allows</text>
  <text start="2944.49" dur="3.96">fundamentalist Muslims to take control</text>
  <text start="2946.47" dur="4.44">of nuclear countries there is no way</text>
  <text start="2948.45" dur="5.4">China allows America and Russia to come</text>
  <text start="2950.91" dur="5.04">together there is no way China allows</text>
  <text start="2953.85" dur="4.77">North Korea to come together with</text>
  <text start="2955.95" dur="4.83">America there is no way the cabal allows</text>
  <text start="2958.62" dur="5.85">America to recover and we&amp;#39;ll continue to</text>
  <text start="2960.78" dur="5.7">try to harm it there is no way the new</text>

  <text start="2966.48" dur="4.5">destabilize the region Africa is in</text>
  <text start="2968.79" dur="3.09">turmoil and the list goes on literally</text>
  <text start="2970.98" dur="3.05">everywhere</text>
  <text start="2971.88" dur="4.13">the Cabal did their work</text>
  <text start="2974.03" dur="5.73">and has broken the once peaceful world</text>
  <text start="2976.01" dur="8.61">and is and it shows every single region</text>
  <text start="2979.76" dur="8.07">of the globe shows in war is coming of</text>
  <text start="2984.62" dur="5.76">that I have no doubt this is my own</text>
  <text start="2987.83" dur="5.13">personal opinion but one that is logical</text>
  <text start="2990.38" dur="4.86">as the world and the events have made it</text>
  <text start="2992.96" dur="5.04">obvious that is why it is essential</text>
  <text start="2995.24" dur="5.91">people come together because the sheer</text>
  <text start="2998" dur="5.79">hatred and racial divisions across every</text>
  <text start="3001.15" dur="5.46">continent is massive to such a high</text>
  <text start="3003.79" dur="5.73">level there is no way it cools until one</text>
  <text start="3006.61" dur="6.12">side destroys the other I have seen more</text>
  <text start="3009.52" dur="6.63">than one more issues than you could even</text>
  <text start="3012.73" dur="5.73">come close to comprehending for a very</text>
  <text start="3016.15" dur="5.07">long time and this is the calm before</text>
  <text start="3018.46" dur="5.67">the storm of war and the initial opening</text>
  <text start="3021.22" dur="4.86">round as sides are taken and lines are</text>
  <text start="3024.13" dur="5.58">drawn in the sand trust your instincts</text>
  <text start="3026.08" dur="5.64">it will tell you what everything you it</text>
  <text start="3029.71" dur="5.01">will tell you what everything you need</text>
  <text start="3031.72" dur="7.97">to know and you have the wisdom of many</text>

  <text start="3040.17" dur="8.2">you what you need to see much they have</text>
  <text start="3045.46" dur="5.52">before I know nobody wants to hear that</text>
  <text start="3048.37" dur="4.83">war is coming but it&amp;#39;s foolish not to</text>
  <text start="3050.98" dur="4.44">logically consider all information and</text>
  <text start="3053.2" dur="5.82">then prepare for outcome and make plans</text>
  <text start="3055.42" dur="5.25">on how to deal with whatever happens so</text>
  <text start="3059.02" dur="3.12">I wanted to share that with you I</text>
  <text start="3060.67" dur="6.96">thought that was an important piece of</text>
  <text start="3062.14" dur="7.71">information to share and that is can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3067.63" dur="3.9">sum it up any better guys and we have to</text>
  <text start="3069.85" dur="3.18">do our best to avoid it we have to do</text>
  <text start="3071.53" dur="3.06">our best to bring each other together we</text>
  <text start="3073.03" dur="4.14">have to do our best to be humble</text>
  <text start="3074.59" dur="4.47">peaceful and nice to one another and</text>
  <text start="3077.17" dur="5.25">accepting of those who have differing</text>
  <text start="3079.06" dur="5.79">opinions but as we all feel like Daniels</text>
  <text start="3082.42" dur="5.52">sometimes in the lion&amp;#39;s den I want to</text>
  <text start="3084.85" dur="6">read a verse from Daniel that will let</text>
  <text start="3087.94" dur="4.8">us all kind of look at it in hopefully</text>
  <text start="3090.85" dur="3.72">another way that they&amp;#39;ll give us hope</text>
  <text start="3092.74" dur="4.56">and perspective on what we are dealing</text>
  <text start="3094.57" dur="5.49">with it says may the name of God and</text>
  <text start="3097.3" dur="5.49">this is Daniel chapter 2 verses 20 and</text>
  <text start="3100.06" dur="5.37">forward it says may the name of God be</text>
  <text start="3102.79" dur="3.69">praised for ever and ever for wisdom and</text>
  <text start="3105.43" dur="3.57">power belong to him</text>
  <text start="3106.48" dur="5.13">he changes the times and seasons he</text>
  <text start="3109" dur="4.8">removes kings and establishes Kings he</text>
  <text start="3111.61" dur="4.68">gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge</text>
  <text start="3113.8" dur="4.92">to those who have understanding he</text>
  <text start="3116.29" dur="5.1">reveals the deep and hidden meanings he</text>
  <text start="3118.72" dur="4.05">knows what is in the darkness and light</text>
  <text start="3121.39" dur="3.93">dwells with him</text>
  <text start="3122.77" dur="5.37">I offer thanks and praise to You God of</text>
  <text start="3125.32" dur="7.41">my father&amp;#39;s because you have given me</text>
  <text start="3128.14" dur="7.29">wisdom and power and that&amp;#39;s Daniel being</text>
  <text start="3132.73" dur="3.96">thankful and I&amp;#39;m thankful every day and</text>
  <text start="3135.43" dur="3.09">I think we should all be thankful</text>
  <text start="3136.69" dur="4.32">because if God gives us that wisdom and</text>
  <text start="3138.52" dur="4.38">power it is up to us to enact it in our</text>
  <text start="3141.01" dur="3.87">lives and to be thankful for it but to</text>
  <text start="3142.9" dur="4.86">embrace it in a way that&amp;#39;s helpful and</text>
  <text start="3144.88" dur="5.01">productive to everyone as a whole</text>
  <text start="3147.76" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s no reason why we should go to</text>
  <text start="3149.89" dur="5.78">war for things that really in this</text>
  <text start="3153.13" dur="5.1">larger scheme of things don&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="3155.67" dur="5.17">because the deep state tells us to is</text>
  <text start="3158.23" dur="4.89">not a good reason because the last time</text>
  <text start="3160.84" dur="4.2">I checked the deep state were the same</text>
  <text start="3163.12" dur="4.11">ones who went out in the intelligence</text>

  <text start="3167.23" dur="4.08">it was okay because to go to war with</text>
  <text start="3169.72" dur="3.3">Iraq because they had weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="3171.31" dur="5.49">destruction which never ended up being</text>
