  <text start="329.889" dur="5.731">the Democrats are trying to obstruct</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="6.239">those processes from happening and this</text>
  <text start="335.62" dur="4.079">is really an amazing thing if you think</text>
  <text start="338.139" dur="3.271">about the Democrats are impeaching</text>
  <text start="339.699" dur="4.261">President Trump for crimes committed by</text>
  <text start="341.41" dur="4.47">Joe Biden I mean is anybody else</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="3.87">watching what&amp;#39;s happening here so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="3.87">just get into the next one the next one</text>
  <text start="347.83" dur="3.809">here is this National Review article now</text>
  <text start="349.75" dur="3.81">this is something very important about</text>
  <text start="351.639" dur="5.011">the impeachment role of the Supreme</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="5.19">Court excu says here just to read this</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="4.29">article it gives you a good idea of how</text>
  <text start="358.75" dur="6.419">the Supreme Court would play a role what</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="5.729">it would do as you know just this Chief</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="3.991">Justice of the Supreme Court Justice</text>
  <text start="366.669" dur="4.47">Roberts would be overseeing any trial</text>
  <text start="369.16" dur="5.12">that took place in the Senate but</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="6.271">President Trump can go directly to the</text>
  <text start="374.28" dur="5.56">US Supreme Court to say that this</text>
  <text start="377.41" dur="5.189">process is tainted it&amp;#39;s biased and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="5.79">unconstitutional and the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="382.599" dur="5.971">can actually effectively knock that down</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="4.62">so I think that&amp;#39;s what the next step for</text>
  <text start="388.57" dur="6.06">president Trump&amp;#39;s gotta be because every</text>
  <text start="390.25" dur="5.669">other example of a you know example of</text>
  <text start="394.63" dur="4.56">impeachment over the history of our</text>
  <text start="395.919" dur="5.551">country is where a president has</text>
  <text start="399.19" dur="4.5">actually violated a law right but</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="5.129">there&amp;#39;s been no laws violated the the</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="4.74">the Democrats continuing to pass</text>
  <text start="406.599" dur="5.961">articles they pass two articles of</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="6">impeachment which really have no exact</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="3.85">clarification as to what laws were</text>
  <text start="414.43" dur="3.359">broken obstruction of Congress is the</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="4.05">most vague thing I&amp;#39;ve ever heard in my</text>
  <text start="417.789" dur="3.931">life it doesn&amp;#39;t actually state any real</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="3.87">crime it&amp;#39;s just you&amp;#39;re obstructing</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="5.43">Congress well what if Congress is</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="4.95">corrupt and trying to impeach and frame</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="3.66">an innocent man then what is that how do</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="3.24">we figure that one out because you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="430.81" dur="3.66">taken away all the civil rights you</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="3.78">basically put them in to a position of</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="4.14">being like a second-class citizen where</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="3.9">he gets no you know presumption of</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="3.54">innocence it&amp;#39;s only a presumption of</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="4.11">guilt and then they&amp;#39;re clapping and</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="2.99">cheering as if this is a good thing for</text>
  <text start="444.31" dur="3.2">our country you</text>
  <text start="445.14" dur="4.73">actual people inside of our government</text>
  <text start="447.51" dur="5.25">you know when they pass the impeachment</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="5.35">articles saying you know clapping and</text>
  <text start="452.76" dur="4.47">you know smiling and and all happy and</text>
  <text start="455.22" dur="3.66">giddy you know what if you think this is</text>
  <text start="457.23" dur="3.78">a good day for our country you&amp;#39;re a sick</text>
  <text start="458.88" dur="3.57">twisted individual and you don&amp;#39;t deserve</text>
  <text start="461.01" dur="3.84">to be in Congress in the first place</text>
  <text start="462.45" dur="6.09">because it&amp;#39;s disgusting to watch the</text>
  <text start="464.85" dur="6.33">kind of anti-american sentiment and just</text>
  <text start="468.54" dur="4.65">complete vile garbage that these</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="4.56">representatives put forth on a regular</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="4.11">basis in pushing this impeachment hoax</text>
  <text start="475.74" dur="2.91">against President Trump first it was</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="3.03">Russia then it&amp;#39;s Ukraine now it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="3.48">impeachment for a phone call that we</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="5.01">know what was said on and there was</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="4.56">nothing said wrong as the circle goes on</text>
  <text start="485.34" dur="3.66">to say it&amp;#39;s basically a Rorschach</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="5.16">Rorschach&amp;#39;s test for the Democrats</text>
  <text start="489" dur="4.95">because they think in their minds that</text>
  <text start="491.85" dur="3.99">they see something that just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="493.95" dur="3.3">exist right and they just keep saying it</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="3.3">enough times that makes it true well</text>
  <text start="497.25" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s not how this works and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="499.14" dur="4.62">how our country&amp;#39;s judicial system works</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="5.37">yet it&amp;#39;s being weaponized and for</text>
  <text start="503.76" dur="3.99">political motives and it&amp;#39;s disgusting so</text>
  <text start="506.43" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how the the</text>
  <text start="507.75" dur="4.68">impeachment role or how the Supreme</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="3.54">Court plays a role on impeachment but as</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="3.75">Q says here in the next one which I</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="3.87">talked about in the last video we did it</text>
  <text start="516.18" dur="3.96">must be done right legally and lawfully</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="3.96">right it must be done according to the</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="3">rule of law it must carry weight it must</text>
  <text start="521.97" dur="3">be proven in the court of law</text>
  <text start="523.14" dur="4.35">there can be no mistakes good things</text>

  <text start="698.549" dur="5.88">able to do to us not just a sitting</text>
  <text start="702.99" dur="2.969">president but then just a regular US</text>
  <text start="704.429" dur="4.681">citizen before that in the Trump</text>
  <text start="705.959" dur="3.81">campaign and run up so Cuse has locked</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="2.1">and loaded</text>
  <text start="709.769" dur="2.851">I believe it</text>
  <text start="711.21" dur="4.68">now the next one here I&amp;#39;m going to play</text>
  <text start="712.62" dur="5.22">these two video clips for you there you</text>
  <text start="715.89" dur="5.49">know basically just something he wants</text>
  <text start="717.84" dur="5.88">us to look at he said I was seven steps</text>
  <text start="721.38" dur="4.74">removed from what was going on the</text>
  <text start="723.72" dur="3.84">director doesn&amp;#39;t get involved in in</text>
  <text start="726.12" dur="4.1">these kinds of things the actual</text>
  <text start="727.56" dur="5.67">investigation do you believe that no I</text>
  <text start="730.22" dur="5.44">think that the one of the problems with</text>
  <text start="733.23" dur="4.56">what happened was precisely that they</text>
  <text start="735.66" dur="5.61">pulled the investigation up to the</text>
  <text start="737.79" dur="5.94">executive floors and it was run and bird</text>
  <text start="741.27" dur="5.49">dogged by a very small group of very</text>
  <text start="743.73" dur="5.37">high-level officials and the idea that</text>
  <text start="746.76" dur="4.52">this was seven layers below him is</text>
  <text start="749.1" dur="4.14">simply not true</text>
  <text start="751.28" dur="4.48">do you believe that Durham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="753.24" dur="4.68">investigation is broader scoped in terms</text>
  <text start="755.76" dur="4.8">of the intelligence agencies that are</text>
  <text start="757.92" dur="4.65">being looked at oh yes you know he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="760.56" dur="4.41">just looking at the FBI he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="762.57" dur="6.29">other agencies and also private and</text>
  <text start="764.97" dur="7.35">departments and also private actors and</text>
  <text start="768.86" dur="6.25">so it&amp;#39;s a much broader investigation and</text>
  <text start="772.32" dur="5.97">also he&amp;#39;s not just looking at the FISA</text>
  <text start="775.11" dur="5.88">aspect of it he is looking at all the</text>
  <text start="778.29" dur="5.49">conduct both before and after the</text>
  <text start="780.99" dur="5.13">election so there you saw the clips of</text>
  <text start="783.78" dur="4.38">attorney general bill Barr basically in</text>
  <text start="786.12" dur="4.5">the sit-down interview that Q told us to</text>
  <text start="788.16" dur="5.75">watch Wednesday last Wednesday this</text>
  <text start="790.62" dur="5.61">Wednesday night at 7 p.m. Eastern where</text>
  <text start="793.91" dur="3.88">attorney general Barr says two things he</text>
  <text start="796.23" dur="3.27">explains the scope of Durham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="4.35">investigation goes well beyond the FBI</text>
  <text start="799.5" dur="4.47">into not just other intelligence</text>
  <text start="802.14" dur="3.63">organizations but then also it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="803.97" dur="4.38">important to hear they&amp;#39;re private</text>
  <text start="805.77" dur="5.9">citizens so what we&amp;#39;re hearing in that</text>
  <text start="808.35" dur="6.06">sense is that everything&amp;#39;s in play right</text>
  <text start="811.67" dur="4.66">all the abuse all the corruption all the</text>
  <text start="814.41" dur="4.5">criminality and every one of the players</text>
  <text start="816.33" dur="4.38">involved are in play in the dirham</text>
  <text start="818.91" dur="5.13">investigation then also we hear in</text>
  <text start="820.71" dur="6.75">another clip that basically there is no</text>
  <text start="824.04" dur="4.92">way that James Comey was removed somehow</text>
  <text start="827.46" dur="3.57">from this investigation he was one of</text>
  <text start="828.96" dur="3.57">the top players and it went straight to</text>
  <text start="831.03" dur="3">him and the executive what is the</text>
  <text start="832.53" dur="3.81">executive well it could just be the</text>
  <text start="834.03" dur="4.14">executive leadership the FBI or I think</text>
  <text start="836.34" dur="3.93">it goes a lot deeper to the executive</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="4.14">leadership of our country the Obama</text>
  <text start="840.27" dur="4.11">administration in its entirety</text>
  <text start="842.31" dur="4.68">the attorney general Lynch</text>
  <text start="844.38" dur="5.43">you know all the players right on the</text>
  <text start="846.99" dur="4.86">obamas team they were in charge</text>
  <text start="849.81" dur="4.53">spearheading this operation they were</text>
  <text start="851.85" dur="4.35">pushing for it they the text is the text</text>
  <text start="854.34" dur="4.62">between Peter struck and Lisa page</text>
  <text start="856.2" dur="5.64">indicate that POTUS wanted to be updated</text>
  <text start="858.96" dur="5.58">on every aspect of their investigations</text>
  <text start="861.84" dur="3.78">so for them to say that you know they</text>
  <text start="864.54" dur="2.94">didn&amp;#39;t know anything about it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.62" dur="3.54">completely absurd and asinine there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="867.48" dur="3.75">just another one of the lies that not</text>
  <text start="869.16" dur="5.42">only do they push but then the fake news</text>
  <text start="871.23" dur="7.44">echo-chamber pushes and that these</text>
  <text start="874.58" dur="5.98">incredible authoritarian fascists in big</text>
  <text start="878.67" dur="3.75">in Silicon Valley think is the right</text>
  <text start="880.56" dur="4.65">incorrect narrative and that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="882.42" dur="5.61">morally abhorrent in a disgusting human</text>
  <text start="885.21" dur="4.92">if you have a differing opinion from</text>
  <text start="888.03" dur="4.53">that you&amp;#39;re basically on the border line</text>
  <text start="890.13" dur="3.93">of just being complete a hateful a</text>
  <text start="892.56" dur="3.54">completely hateful person for what</text>

  <text start="900.87" dur="4.71">apologize for that</text>
  <text start="902.22" dur="5.61">not really and then that&amp;#39;s what Q point</text>
  <text start="905.58" dur="4.83">us to the next one here is an Anton I</text>
  <text start="907.83" dur="6.21">guess put this graphic up where they</text>
  <text start="910.41" dur="6.15">charted the 0 Delta tweets where a Q</text>
  <text start="914.04" dur="7.65">posts and then or excuse me where</text>
  <text start="916.56" dur="8.22">President Trump tweets and Q posts at</text>
  <text start="921.69" dur="4.71">the exact same time right and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="924.78" dur="4.5">always been within a few seconds I think</text>
  <text start="926.4" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;ve had one exact zero Delta or that</text>
  <text start="929.28" dur="4.83">was the goal to get to a zero Delta you</text>
  <text start="931.74" dur="4.14">know when when we&amp;#39;ve seen all of these</text>
  <text start="934.11" dur="5.64">posts they&amp;#39;re just more confirmations of</text>
  <text start="935.88" dur="7.68">Q right well you have president Trump</text>
  <text start="939.75" dur="5.19">and Q posting tweet and a Q post at the</text>

  <text start="946.35" dur="4.86">so the announce is mathematically</text>
  <text start="948.9" dur="5.19">impossible that in Q says what about</text>
