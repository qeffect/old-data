  <text start="370.43" dur="3.78">covert and may be silent may not know</text>
  <text start="372.14" dur="5.03">about it directly but it is certainly</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="5.34">something to be looked at okay now</text>

  <text start="382.88" dur="7.14">pretty self-explanatory though and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="3.12">gonna get into something we&amp;#39;ll watch a</text>
  <text start="390.02" dur="4.619">trump video and we&amp;#39;ll figure a few</text>
  <text start="391.82" dur="5.4">things out now</text>
  <text start="394.639" dur="8.361">in response to his own post your cube</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="9.719">puts eh see a relevant soon queue now</text>
  <text start="403" dur="7.389">I&amp;#39;m pretty sure obviously given what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.939" dur="6.811">in the next queue post that cues refer</text>
  <text start="410.389" dur="6.83">in California now I haven&amp;#39;t exactly</text>
  <text start="413.75" dur="5.819">figured out yet what the e H stands for</text>
  <text start="417.219" dur="4.741">although Q is pointing to it and telling</text>
  <text start="419.569" dur="4.951">us that it will become relevant soon</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="4.389">such as he has done so many times in the</text>
  <text start="424.52" dur="3.66">past where he gives us a crumb and then</text>
  <text start="426.349" dur="3.961">it becomes quite apparent what that</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="5.459">crumb was leading us to when we</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="4.949">eventually see in the news later what is</text>
  <text start="433.639" dur="3.21">going on but I really believe that</text>
  <text start="435.259" dur="3.421">there&amp;#39;s something going on in the border</text>
  <text start="436.849" dur="2.641">that&amp;#39;s much bigger than we could ever</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="2.669">imagine</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="3.179">as Q says here in the next post I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="441.349" dur="3.87">show you the next post says border</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="6.15">states are very key bigger than you can</text>
  <text start="445.219" dur="5.7">imagine the pipeline not Republican</text>
  <text start="448.819" dur="7.261">versus Democrat California is special</text>
  <text start="450.919" dur="7.47">public will learn q okay so obviously</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="4.829">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s some sort of pipeline of</text>
  <text start="458.389" dur="6.09">influence that&amp;#39;s running through that</text>
  <text start="460.909" dur="7.801">state and or a direct pipe line that</text>
  <text start="464.479" dur="7.291">they&amp;#39;re referring to into government or</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="5.19">into the the positions of power where I</text>
  <text start="471.77" dur="4.44">believe I mean if you think about I</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="4.759">think that what is it California is the</text>
  <text start="476.21" dur="4.859">sixth largest economy in the world I</text>
  <text start="478.659" dur="5.62">think in isn&amp;#39;t that true</text>
  <text start="481.069" dur="6.96">so they obviously may be in a whole</text>
  <text start="484.279" dur="6.45">nother realm of influence and subversion</text>
  <text start="488.029" dur="5.31">and you know who knows who&amp;#39;s infiltrated</text>
  <text start="490.729" dur="5.25">those key positions in that state</text>
  <text start="493.339" dur="3.901">government to the point where I mean</text>
  <text start="495.979" dur="2.97">when you have that much money on the</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="4.289">line there&amp;#39;s gonna be some corruption</text>
  <text start="498.949" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s going to be some people who are</text>
  <text start="501.529" dur="5.67">trying to infiltrate especially act bad</text>
  <text start="505.009" dur="4.59">actors from foreign powers foreign</text>
  <text start="507.199" dur="5.311">agencies because they realize that if</text>
  <text start="509.599" dur="4.35">they can control or direct the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="3.36">sixth-largest economy could actually</text>
  <text start="513.949" dur="4.65">dick it direct it to help them and</text>
  <text start="515.87" dur="4.829">benefit their country or their agenda so</text>
  <text start="518.599" dur="4.261">obviously q is pointing us to really</text>
  <text start="520.699" dur="4.711">take a closer examination of California</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="5.55">and what&amp;#39;s really going on there and how</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="7.159">much bigger the whole pipeline issue</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="7.26">you of influence is - what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="532.569" dur="5.83">now next we&amp;#39;re gonna watch this video</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s very important that you guys listen</text>

  <text start="539.69" dur="4.47">explaining justifying what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="542.839" dur="3.54">and what&amp;#39;s gonna be going on especially</text>

  <text start="919.589" dur="4.651">picking up on there in that story is</text>
  <text start="922.74" dur="2.499">that they were referring to the queue</text>
