  <text start="127.59" dur="4.509">speech but I&amp;#39;ve taken the liberty of</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="5.599">putting together some</text>
  <text start="132.099" dur="4.841">basically putting it together for you</text>
  <text start="134.959" dur="3.81">guys in a special way so I hope you</text>
  <text start="136.94" dur="3.36">enjoy that but before we get to that</text>
  <text start="138.769" dur="3.931">video let&amp;#39;s talk about this post real</text>
  <text start="140.3" dur="4.019">quick this is referring to one of the</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="3.96">earlier posts this is when Q was first</text>
  <text start="144.319" dur="4.321">getting started and he warned us and you</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="3.659">know it&amp;#39;s so funny because I pretty sure</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="4.17">it was in this last video or the video</text>
  <text start="150.319" dur="5.161">before that where I talked exactly about</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="4.35">how Q is using disinformation I think it</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="3.78">was in this video when I was referring</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="4.079">to the fact that President Trump went on</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="6.47">his cell phone on his Twitter account</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="6.631">and he tweeted out in anger about the</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="4.63">685 million phone calls that were</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="7.17">deleted at the NSA and in this video</text>
  <text start="170.36" dur="10.53">you&amp;#39;ll hear me clearly say that well Q</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="7.8">told us before that that there is the</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="3.209">you know basically that they kept what</text>
  <text start="182.84" dur="2.429">they needed and they threw out what they</text>
  <text start="184.099" dur="2.491">didn&amp;#39;t need and I said that was a good</text>
  <text start="185.269" dur="3.271">thing because they don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="5.52">keeping my phone calls you know about</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="5.55">you know getting a haircut I know</text>
  <text start="192.11" dur="4.14">whatever like that it&amp;#39;s just unnecessary</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="4.95">to keep them you have 685 million calls</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s like they can&amp;#39;t all be you know</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="4.14">evil people plotting crimes that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="4.65">would be insane if that was actually</text>
  <text start="203.18" dur="6.42">happening every day but regardless of</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.25">that what I said in this video is</text>
  <text start="209.6" dur="4.62">exactly what Q is saying here I said the</text>
  <text start="211.85" dur="3.9">exact word exactly almost the exact</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="4.68">phrase I guess I would say about</text>
  <text start="215.75" dur="5.19">disinformation being necessary right and</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="3.03">why is disinformation I think I might</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="2.879">have said misinformation or</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="6.179">disinformation but why is it necessary</text>
  <text start="223.819" dur="6.39">well I guess this would be different</text>
  <text start="228.109" dur="5.13">because it&amp;#39;s disassociating information</text>
  <text start="230.209" dur="7.741">but in the sense that&amp;#39;s what I meant and</text>
  <text start="233.239" dur="6.78">why I meant this is that it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="4.409">thing I said think sessions think the</text>
  <text start="240.019" dur="5.431">way that President Trump has publicly</text>
  <text start="242.359" dur="5.071">chastised Attorney General Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="4.319">he&amp;#39;s doing it because president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="4.77">putting himself out there to take the</text>
  <text start="249.769" dur="4.141">heat it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s incredible you look at</text>
  <text start="252.2" dur="3.75">somebody who you admire in that sense of</text>
  <text start="253.91" dur="4.199">you know just having that the gall and</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="4.23">the ability to stand up and do what they</text>
  <text start="258.109" dur="4.74">know is right and then have this great</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="4.58">plan to do it in it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s tough</text>
  <text start="262.849" dur="4.401">obviously there&amp;#39;s dangers involved</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s crazy but he stepped up to the</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="3.84">plate and then you know by chastising</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="3.9">Jeff Sessions saying oh well I would</text>
  <text start="271.09" dur="3.87">never hired you if I knew you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="3.48">recuse yourself it&amp;#39;s kind of a wink and</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="3.42">a nod to the people who are actually</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="3.51">paying attention to see that there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="3.39">really a few there there&amp;#39;s just that</text>
  <text start="279.85" dur="4.08">public disassociation because Trump is</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="3.93">quite cognizant of the fact that it</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="6.06">would look very bad if his attorney</text>
  <text start="285.7" dur="6.33">general was his best friend and then</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="4.71">actively having political investigations</text>
  <text start="292.03" dur="4.29">going into his political rivals guys</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="3.06">this is all about optics and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="3.48">not just about optics it&amp;#39;s the truth I</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="3.78">bet president Trump feels that way I bet</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="3.54">that there&amp;#39;s a genuine part of him</text>
  <text start="301.54" dur="3.86">because he you know he says what he</text>
  <text start="303.34" dur="4.17">feels kind of in a very open sense</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="3.37">there&amp;#39;s a probably genuine part of this</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="2.85">I wouldn&amp;#39;t pick this guy if I knew he</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="2.88">was gonna do that I&amp;#39;m glad that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.36" dur="4.53">doing an investigation now but I</text>
  <text start="311.65" dur="4.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t pick them right that&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="314.89" dur="2.7">principle I think that&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="2.82">when you talk about the the</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="3.69">disinformation that&amp;#39;s being necessary</text>
  <text start="319.42" dur="3.78">this is talking about the Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="3.33">this all right the time that the purge</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="3.09">happened in Saudi Arabia of all the</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="3.33">princes basically where they were all</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="3.81">rounded up and they were interrogated</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="6.42">and you had Prince Alwaleed bin Talal</text>
  <text start="330.1" dur="6.27">basically he was put through the wringer</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="4.25">I&amp;#39;ve heard I don&amp;#39;t know if a that&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="6.57">but this would be quite frank he was a</text>
  <text start="338.61" dur="6.04">asked politely the truth and he told it</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="3.99">and right after that you saw crazy stuff</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="5.28">happened like Rothschild selling their</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="5.49">historic it was like what there was like</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="4.5">fifteen thousand hectares or something</text>
  <text start="352.42" dur="6.12">like that of land ten thousand hectares</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="5.73">which isn&amp;#39;t an obscene amount of land in</text>
  <text start="358.54" dur="3.21">Austria and there was there hunting</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="3.99">preserve and there was basically an</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="4.01">insinuation there was they weren&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="4.23">hunting animals if you know what I mean</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="5.77">you guys do with that if you whatever</text>
  <text start="368.38" dur="4.56">you will in your minds but um this is</text>
  <text start="371.53" dur="7.23">what&amp;#39;s being said here and it&amp;#39;s a wise</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="7.59">was this necessary well it&amp;#39;s a part of</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="4.68">the game and it&amp;#39;s not a game as much as</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="4.8">it is it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a chess match you have</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="3.96">to do these things because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.33" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s people at all different levels</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="6.36">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very very strategic game</text>
  <text start="390.31" dur="7.05">that&amp;#39;s being heard to strategic whatever</text>
  <text start="393.76" dur="8.32">you want to call this being done here so</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="6.13">it&amp;#39;s saying you know what questions were</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="3.3">being asked regarding Saturday to be</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="2.91">prior to the release of prior to</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="2.37">Saturday movements well they were</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="3.54">covering a lot about what happened in</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="4.08">911 and that&amp;#39;s exactly--it here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="409.94" dur="4.11">truth right I just saw Tucker on the</text>
  <text start="411.83" dur="4.74">other night he interviewed the parents</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="5.88">of a victim I believe of 911 ones an</text>
  <text start="416.57" dur="5.84">attorney there was an advocate and they</text>
  <text start="419.93" dur="4.74">were basically laying out the case that</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="3.55">previous administration&amp;#39;s block the</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="3.54">ability for these families to actually</text>
  <text start="425.96" dur="5.73">seek retribution from Saudi Arabia for</text>
  <text start="428.21" dur="5.46">their basic support of the people who</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="4.05">came and went and committed the crimes</text>
  <text start="433.67" dur="3.92">here in America that&amp;#39;s not to say that</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re gonna blanketly say the whole</text>
  <text start="437.59" dur="4.51">Saudi regime it was responsible for it</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="2.94">even though a lot of people have said</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="3.12">that it&amp;#39;s just to say that there were</text>
  <text start="443.63" dur="5.07">people inside of that country who were</text>
  <text start="445.22" dur="5.85">basically funding it and then through</text>
  <text start="448.7" dur="5.25">funding it should have some culpability</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="4.65">in my personal opinion that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="453.95" dur="3.51">argument that they were making on Tucker</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="4.02">Carlson the other night and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.46" dur="4.86">exactly the truth I mean this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="3.69">being exposed here and I think that</text>
  <text start="462.32" dur="2.34">that&amp;#39;s what happened when President</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="2.55">Trump went over there you say look we</text>
  <text start="464.66" dur="2.7">have the evidence if you don&amp;#39;t clean</text>
  <text start="465.98" dur="3.39">your own house we&amp;#39;ll clean it for you</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="4.08">cut type deal pretty sure that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="469.37" dur="4.59">was laid on the line for your now</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="4.95">current Prince who&amp;#39;s not how will leave</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="5.16">bent until all tell me that much but um</text>
  <text start="476.39" dur="3.69">you know that&amp;#39;s what happens what</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="2.79">happened over there and that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="3.81">can tweet at them and say you know give</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="3.48">me two million more barrels because of</text>
  <text start="483.89" dur="3.66">me look we gotta turn the screws up on</text>
  <text start="485.39" dur="4.65">people who are abusing our country</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="3.9">killing our citizens I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="490.04" dur="3.12">they all are not</text>
  <text start="491.45" dur="2.79">blanketly saying but I&amp;#39;m saying if they</text>
  <text start="493.16" dur="3.24">are behind that and they were</text>
  <text start="494.24" dur="4.59">responsible for the death of citizens we</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="4.98">need to hold them accountable but just</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="5.1">saying that could have been responsible</text>
  <text start="501.38" dur="5.16">for all these things and then not to</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="4.38">mention the fact that they have changed</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="3.24">in a good way I mean they&amp;#39;ve women</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="3.45">driving now it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve been a lot of</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="3.15">positive changes over there since Trump</text>
  <text start="511.76" dur="3.33">President Trump went over there and</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="5.64">talked to them so you guys put that</text>
  <text start="515.09" dur="5.61">together however you want now q says</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="7.47">think Mir look there or here or there</text>
  <text start="520.7" dur="7.32">truth this behind you you know this</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="4.02">statement to me is still kind of one of</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="2.74">those enigmatic statements it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="3.88">kind of a riddle</text>
