  <text start="163.5" dur="3.78">a quote from the vault seven League I</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="4.11">think right here it&amp;#39;s saying quote</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="4.11">unlike bullets bombs or missiles most</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="4.35">CIA malware is designed to live for days</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="5.1">or even years after it has reached its</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="4.77">target CIA malware it does not explode</text>
  <text start="176.49" dur="4.41">on impact but rather permanently infest</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="4.17">its target in order to infect targets</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="3.87">devices copies of the bowel are must be</text>

  <text start="184.77" dur="4.29">physical possession of the malware to</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="5.67">get the to or to the target to</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="5.22">exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="3.48">wait await further instructions the</text>
  <text start="194.28" dur="3.78">malware must communicate with CIA</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="4.47">command and control systems placed on</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="4.38">internet connected servers but such</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="3.54">servers are typically not approved to</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="4.08">hold classified information</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="5.43">so CIA command and control systems are</text>
  <text start="206.52" dur="6.6">also made unclassified and that&amp;#39;s from</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="7.62">vault 7 and the Anton goes on to say the</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="6.78">links below that you are that direct you</text>

  <text start="244.32" dur="3.69">this document to completion I said I</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="3.539">noticed the enormous amount of</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="4.14">comparisons between packets of data and</text>

  <text start="252.15" dur="5.13">autistic I looked back in the queue map</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="4.5">and on March 5th 2018 Anton posted how</text>

  <text start="356.5" dur="7.32">warlocks Wow this is actually a</text>
  <text start="359.14" dur="6.87">fascinating analysis and q obviously</text>
  <text start="363.82" dur="4.41">pointing to it means or something way</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="5.51">this guy&amp;#39;s really a person is really on</text>
  <text start="368.23" dur="5.55">point and yes these were the the</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="7.12">components that were uncovered through</text>
  <text start="373.78" dur="8.01">the actual WikiLeaks drop of vault 7 and</text>
  <text start="378.64" dur="4.529">it makes sense I mean I mean what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="6.84">basically saying is you heard there is</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="9.061">that Facebook carries this malicious</text>
  <text start="388.63" dur="6.15">malware right and it drops it off and</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="6.6">puts it on your device and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="7.41">basically an idle component piece of</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="5.309">where that actually gives access to the</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="4.949">CIA and other I would presume other</text>
  <text start="404.139" dur="6.361">corporate other entities through this</text>
  <text start="407.139" dur="6.381">backdoor so this is how even after you</text>
  <text start="410.5" dur="6.509">delete the app they can still spy on you</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="5.019">because the the malware was already</text>
  <text start="417.009" dur="3.391">deposited through downloading the</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="3.84">original app or it was embedded</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="7.53">originally with the original operating</text>
  <text start="422.379" dur="7.141">system of the phone itself so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="4.139">learning in real time what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="6.869">which is really crazy the next one here</text>
  <text start="432.069" dur="7.56">is this Danang dick Blumenthal you know</text>
  <text start="436.389" dur="5.701">the hero of Vietnam as president Trump</text>
  <text start="439.629" dur="3.6">likes to say sarcastically but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.09" dur="1.949">tweeting out here saying why is the</text>
  <text start="443.229" dur="3.211">Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="444.039" dur="4.321">reportedly building secret dossiers on</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="4.65">journalists and immigration lawyers</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="4.769">apparent profiling mirrors the behavior</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="3.75">of autocrats I will be demanding answers</text>
  <text start="453.129" dur="3.901">what he&amp;#39;s referring to obviously is a</text>
  <text start="454.84" dur="4.259">story that came out and it talks about</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="3.78">how there there&amp;#39;s a leaked documents</text>
  <text start="459.099" dur="3.091">showing the US government was tracking</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="3.99">journalists and immigration advocates</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="4.65">through a secret database and it even</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="4.38">goes into it here it says now documents</text>
  <text start="466.84" dur="4.68">linked to NBC 7 investigates show their</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="3.959">fears weren&amp;#39;t baseless in fact their own</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="4.41">government had listed their names in a</text>
  <text start="473.139" dur="5.671">secret database of targets where again</text>
  <text start="475.93" dur="4.229">or agents collected information on them</text>
  <text start="478.81" dur="3.03">some had alerts placed on their</text>
  <text start="480.159" dur="3.361">passports keeping at least two photo</text>
  <text start="481.84" dur="4.949">journalists and an attorney from</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="5.519">entering Mexico to work this was</text>
  <text start="486.789" dur="4.651">anonymously provided and it was</text>
  <text start="489.039" dur="6.63">screenshots of a SharePoint application</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="7.379">that was put together that collected all</text>
  <text start="495.669" dur="5.581">this information so I mean what Q saying</text>
  <text start="498.819" dur="4.731">is right here glimpse of something much</text>
  <text start="501.25" dur="4.199">bigger to come actions have consequences</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="5.32">remember it goes both ways</text>
  <text start="505.449" dur="5.161">nobody is safe leaked was plugged Q so</text>
  <text start="508.87" dur="4.049">obviously whoever leaked that was fired</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="4.109">that would be one thing and when Q says</text>
  <text start="512.919" dur="3.901">nobody safe if you take that and put it</text>
  <text start="514.719" dur="3.841">in conjunction with this and the fact</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="3.029">that what that guy was basically saying</text>
  <text start="518.56" dur="4.8">or the analyst saying is that they were</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="5.55">using that same technology against the</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="4.58">deep state now that was Trump President</text>
  <text start="525.399" dur="5.43">Trump gave the authorization for</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="4.3">basically Admiral Rogers and the NSA and</text>
  <text start="530.829" dur="4.441">the Wizards war law</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="6.18">and military intelligence to use the the</text>
  <text start="535.27" dur="6.92">back door at malware whatever you want</text>
  <text start="538.42" dur="5.85">to call it against the deep state and</text>
  <text start="542.19" dur="4.93">these guys are coming out now and it</text>
  <text start="544.27" dur="4.35">says remember it goes both ways so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="5.1">going to wait and see what this builds</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="5.13">into on a much bigger scale but you can</text>
  <text start="552.22" dur="3.809">imagine that if you have a bunch of</text>
  <text start="553.75" dur="4.17">foreign a bunch of foreign people trying</text>
  <text start="556.029" dur="3.721">to cross your border illegally there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="3.419">bunch of your own citizens going to</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="3">interact with these people you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="561.339" dur="3.831">to want to keep track of them I mean I</text>
  <text start="562.75" dur="5.54">think that only makes sense so that&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="6.609">anyway the next one here is a tweet from</text>
  <text start="568.29" dur="7.09">this David Miller which it is saying</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="6.271">it&amp;#39;s happening in reference to a meeting</text>

  <text start="580.899" dur="3.931">know is working on all of those cases</text>
  <text start="583.12" dur="3.93">different investigations with 400</text>
  <text start="584.83" dur="4.23">investigators a lot of those cases seem</text>

  <text start="609.52" dur="5.189">talks about what to expect in different</text>
  <text start="612.13" dur="4.709">time lines and it gave us the exact</text>
  <text start="614.709" dur="4.831">timeline to think of and now here we are</text>
  <text start="616.839" dur="4.591">with the like it says here the bar</text>
