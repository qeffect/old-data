  <text start="11.67" dur="3.93">between peace and war</text>

  <text start="36.66" dur="4.8">between peace and war only between fight</text>
  <text start="39.329" dur="4.731">or surrender if we continue to</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="4.77">accommodate continue to back and retreat</text>
  <text start="44.06" dur="4.93">eventually we have to face the final</text>

  <text start="229.35" dur="3.93">these videos shit on your social media</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="5.06">why I have to go over this every time</text>
  <text start="233.28" dur="4.86">because there&amp;#39;s active suppression of</text>
  <text start="235.7" dur="4.48">content happening on YouTube they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="3.99">admitting it they&amp;#39;re writing the Susan</text>

  <text start="242.13" dur="5.22">how they&amp;#39;re gonna try to curtail and</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="6.3">limit the amount of views that certain</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="6.27">controversial content gets so they are</text>
  <text start="250.65" dur="5.82">acting as not only publishers but</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="6.78">thought police in trying to control what</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="5.489">you are able to see and hear so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="3.6">why you have to share these videos you</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="3.121">got to go back watch them share them on</text>
  <text start="264" dur="2.4">your social media to get the word out</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="2.91">that way and if scratching head go what</text>

  <text start="267.99" dur="2.73">this video right here</text>
  <text start="268.8" dur="4.709">shared on your social media but they are</text>
  <text start="270.72" dur="4.5">actively trying to suppress this content</text>

  <text start="275.22" dur="6.15">kind of reporting so please please share</text>
  <text start="277.979" dur="6.03">this content and that&amp;#39;s how we continue</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="3.96">to defeat them is by sharing the content</text>
  <text start="284.009" dur="3.63">right around them starting here with a</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="5.82">fake news article from the NBC fake news</text>

  <text start="1277.399" dur="5.311">books here hmm interesting we do</text>
  <text start="1280.549" dur="4.951">remember all the times that Q referred</text>
  <text start="1282.71" dur="4.199">to the Hunt for Red October and one of</text>
  <text start="1285.5" dur="4.47">the Anton&amp;#39;s pulled this up from January</text>
  <text start="1286.909" dur="5.281">of 2013 about the Red October campaign</text>
  <text start="1289.97" dur="4.02">which was an advanced cyber espionage</text>
  <text start="1292.19" dur="4.26">Network targeting diplomatic and</text>

  <text start="1296.45" dur="3.66">published back in 2013 and you notice</text>
  <text start="1298.22" dur="4.319">how it disappeared very quickly we never</text>
  <text start="1300.11" dur="5.37">really heard much about it but it was is</text>
  <text start="1302.539" dur="6.421">this copper ski lab had researchers had</text>
  <text start="1305.48" dur="8.669">decided to figure out what this system</text>
  <text start="1308.96" dur="8.61">of espionage was it was a sort of Trojan</text>
  <text start="1314.149" dur="6.211">horse that virus that was put inside of</text>

  <text start="1325.909" dur="4.14">espionage Network</text>
  <text start="1327.559" dur="3.96">now given that cues told us so many</text>
  <text start="1330.049" dur="3.12">times over and over again about the Hunt</text>
  <text start="1331.519" dur="4.351">for Red October I thought this was very</text>
  <text start="1333.169" dur="4.081">suspicious and worth investigating</text>
  <text start="1335.87" dur="3.059">further I&amp;#39;ll leave a link if you want to</text>
  <text start="1337.25" dur="5.279">read more about it but again this can</text>
  <text start="1338.929" dur="5.49">send a lot of the more technical side of</text>
  <text start="1342.529" dur="3.571">how this all worked and if you guys are</text>
  <text start="1344.419" dur="3.811">out there some of the Anton&amp;#39;s or whoever</text>
  <text start="1346.1" dur="4.02">who have a better grip on that please</text>
  <text start="1348.23" dur="5.13">start doing some digging here because I</text>
  <text start="1350.12" dur="6.33">think there&amp;#39;s a lot more to this not to</text>
  <text start="1353.36" dur="5.46">mention the fact that we remember what</text>
  <text start="1356.45" dur="4.5">was Iron Eagle iron Eagle in Red October</text>
  <text start="1358.82" dur="5.489">were always set at the same time Iron</text>
  <text start="1360.95" dur="5.55">Eagle is an anagram of this eager lion</text>
  <text start="1364.309" dur="4.051">which was a joint exercise between the</text>
  <text start="1366.5" dur="6.029">US and Jordanians</text>
  <text start="1368.36" dur="6.36">which interestingly enough lets here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1372.529" dur="6.99">what each line does and this was called</text>
  <text start="1374.72" dur="6.12">as it says here the keystone event do</text>
  <text start="1379.519" dur="4.201">you think this has to do with training</text>
  <text start="1380.84" dur="5.52">special operators to conduct clandestine</text>
  <text start="1383.72" dur="5.189">operations it says ego line helps to</text>
  <text start="1386.36" dur="3.99">clarify how to plan and execute joint</text>
  <text start="1388.909" dur="3.27">operations in unconventional</text>

  <text start="1393.98" dur="4.02">governmental or non-governmental</text>
  <text start="1395.029" dur="6.89">agencies so remember everything we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1398" dur="7.409">seeing with this hurricane and the the I</text>
  <text start="1401.919" dur="5.531">mean everything from top to bottom is a</text>
  <text start="1405.409" dur="5.25">part of a very very well coordinated</text>
  <text start="1407.45" dur="6.24">well planned a well thought-out plan I</text>
  <text start="1410.659" dur="5.01">should say and Q&amp;#39;s been hinting at this</text>
  <text start="1413.69" dur="4.05">and now we&amp;#39;re finally in the end stage</text>
  <text start="1415.669" dur="5.25">of it happening if you guys don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1417.74" dur="4.77">remember one of the the first times we</text>
  <text start="1420.919" dur="3.331">got both those together I think was</text>
  <text start="1422.51" dur="3.899">right here where it said you have so</text>
  <text start="1424.25" dur="4.95">much more you know so much future proofs</text>
  <text start="1426.409" dur="5.281">past news unlocks map plus plus plus</text>
  <text start="1429.2" dur="5.79">plus plus plus Red October Iron Eagle Q</text>
  <text start="1431.69" dur="4.949">so I think this is the first time you</text>
  <text start="1434.99" dur="4.59">told us that the brackets were the kill</text>
  <text start="1436.639" dur="5.961">box now why is this important it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1439.58" dur="6.809">simple it&amp;#39;s important because this</text>
  <text start="1442.6" dur="8.53">information was given to us almost two</text>
  <text start="1446.389" dur="7.17">years ago and when you take that into</text>
  <text start="1451.13" dur="4.95">account and think to yourself okay what</text>
  <text start="1453.559" dur="6.84">were we being told we were being told</text>
  <text start="1456.08" dur="10.469">that these operations were planned and</text>
  <text start="1460.399" dur="7.53">going to happen so we&amp;#39;ve done a lot here</text>
  <text start="1466.549" dur="3.6">I think and covering a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1467.929" dur="3.901">things now finally this remember here</text>
