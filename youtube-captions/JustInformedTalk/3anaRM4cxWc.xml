  <text start="424.389" dur="4.41">to get more control to take more control</text>
  <text start="426.219" dur="4.56">into to destroy our country in my</text>
  <text start="428.799" dur="4.44">opinion because a lot of these people</text>
  <text start="430.779" dur="4.11">are corrupt and complicit a lot of them</text>
  <text start="433.239" dur="3.18">would rather see this country destroyed</text>
  <text start="434.889" dur="3.3">than to ever be found guilty for their</text>
  <text start="436.419" dur="5.64">crimes or to be brought up on charges or</text>
  <text start="438.189" dur="5.76">to you know come clean and confess so</text>
  <text start="442.059" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s the biggest problem we&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="443.949" dur="5.25">into and there there have been sleepers</text>
  <text start="446.739" dur="4.38">since day one and I think what you have</text>
  <text start="449.199" dur="3.601">to remember is that you know the five</text>
  <text start="451.119" dur="3.6">DHS here a lot of this stuff has been</text>
  <text start="452.8" dur="3.75">allowed to happen and it&amp;#39;s all been a</text>
  <text start="454.719" dur="4.23">part of the plan to let people in so</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="4.409">that you know you ever heard the saying</text>
  <text start="458.949" dur="3.45">you know keep your friends close and</text>
  <text start="460.959" dur="3.96">your enemies closer</text>
  <text start="462.399" dur="4.2">well that would play perfectly into the</text>
  <text start="464.919" dur="3.42">thought process I think for President</text>
  <text start="466.599" dur="4.02">Trump because the closer they are to</text>
  <text start="468.339" dur="6.63">Trump President Trump I should say the</text>
  <text start="470.619" dur="5.94">easier they are to be monitored and the</text>
  <text start="474.969" dur="4.02">shorter the leash you can hold on these</text>
  <text start="476.559" dur="4.92">people because a lot of them obviously</text>
  <text start="478.989" dur="4.83">are going to turn and going to go after</text>
  <text start="481.479" dur="5.04">President Trump and that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="483.819" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re up against right now so with that</text>
  <text start="486.519" dur="3.54">in mind that kind of explains that one</text>
  <text start="488.259" dur="4.02">the next one here says these people are</text>
  <text start="490.059" dur="3.78">stupid it gives this congress document</text>
  <text start="492.279" dur="3.63">now we&amp;#39;ve talked about this here in the</text>
  <text start="493.839" dur="3.9">channel before but this was the treaty</text>
  <text start="495.909" dur="4.79">with Ukraine on mutual legal assistance</text>
  <text start="497.739" dur="6.96">in criminal matters this is back from</text>
  <text start="500.699" dur="7.06">1999 with Bill Clinton being the one</text>
  <text start="504.699" dur="5.76">overseeing the the treaty here gives us</text>
  <text start="507.759" dur="5.64">letter of transmittal that he signs here</text>
  <text start="510.459" dur="4.44">with his name and I wonder if I want to</text>
  <text start="513.399" dur="3.66">remind the American people what Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.899" dur="3.691">trying to remind us what president</text>
  <text start="517.059" dur="4.11">Trump&amp;#39;s doing is a party</text>
  <text start="518.59" dur="3.93">is literally called for in this treaty</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="1.981">that was signed between our two</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="3.6">countries</text>
  <text start="523.15" dur="5.91">so it isn&amp;#39;t it amazing how the tools</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="5.04">that they probably drafted and created</text>
  <text start="529.06" dur="4.32">in order to legally protect themselves</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="4.5">right this mutual legal assistance was</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="3.899">so that both sides could monitor what</text>
  <text start="535.66" dur="3.66">was happening so that they could keep</text>
  <text start="537.279" dur="4.681">track of and protect the corrupt</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="4.47">dealings in Ukraine right the mutual</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="4.05">legal assistance was so that you know</text>
  <text start="543.79" dur="5.37">the corrupt DOJ who was working with</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="5.25">Obama or Clinton or whoever or Bush or</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="4.74">whatever could call up Ukraine and say</text>
  <text start="551.26" dur="4.92">hey you know like Biden did get rid of</text>
  <text start="553.9" dur="4.2">this prosecutor we&amp;#39;re cooperating our</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="3.96">mutual legal assistance means get rid of</text>

  <text start="710.23" dur="3.42">made against the Clinton Foundation they</text>
  <text start="712.06" dur="3.57">gave her these three talking points</text>
  <text start="713.65" dur="3.84">which are kind of hilarious say she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.63" dur="3.93">very proud of Clinton Foundation&amp;#39;s work</text>
  <text start="717.49" dur="4.41">she thinks people donates to it because</text>
  <text start="719.56" dur="4.17">they want to support good works and if</text>
  <text start="721.9" dur="4.23">anyone did ever give money in hopes of</text>
  <text start="723.73" dur="5.13">influencing something state did they are</text>
  <text start="726.13" dur="5.67">foolish because she she never did that</text>

  <text start="745.33" dur="4.23">formulate behind the scenes how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="747.46" dur="3.3">gonna present this publicly and then the</text>
  <text start="749.56" dur="3.81">next slide is very interesting it says</text>
  <text start="750.76" dur="4.92">at least this will at least this way she</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="4.47">will have taken off the table any notion</text>
  <text start="755.68" dur="3.69">that it was quid pro quo even if some</text>
  <text start="757.84" dur="3.93">donors donors may have had bad</text>
  <text start="759.37" dur="5.88">intentions so here they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="761.77" dur="5.52">admitting that they knew that the donors</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="4.11">had bad intentions and and we know it</text>
  <text start="767.29" dur="3.45">goes so much deeper than that this is</text>
  <text start="769.36" dur="3.99">just their cover story and their way to</text>
  <text start="770.74" dur="4.59">play it off as oh well you know even if</text>
  <text start="773.35" dur="3.59">they were paying for play it&amp;#39;s not like</text>

  <text start="1743.57" dur="4.53">more of the technical anton&amp;#39;s to look at</text>
  <text start="1746.029" dur="4.02">and figure out but with that the final</text>
  <text start="1748.1" dur="3.9">one here basically gives this link to</text>
  <text start="1750.049" dur="3.811">this BBC article which interestingly</text>

  <text start="1772.1" dur="7.89">article from 2018 mind you it says think</text>
