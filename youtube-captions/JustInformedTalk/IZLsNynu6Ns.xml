  <text start="265.169" dur="3.421">couple this with stuff that</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="3.51">being floating on the anton boards you</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="3.03">start to realize that this mate might be</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="4.95">a lot more than anybody could ever</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="6.39">imagine now what it I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="4.23">Nexus is kind of unverified but it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="278.01" dur="3.69">conversation that took place on the</text>
  <text start="279.51" dur="5.16">8chan boards that one of the Anton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.7" dur="5.19">noticed and picked up and cut out its</text>
  <text start="284.67" dur="4.82">highlighting the fact that somebody who</text>
  <text start="286.89" dur="5.79">says claims to be an anonymous</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="6.85">individual who works at Google or in</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="5.15">that sphere somehow who is privy to some</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="5.31">information that you and I may not be</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="6.31">has said that basically there were</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="4.41">things going on behind the scenes that</text>
  <text start="304.14" dur="4.23">we couldn&amp;#39;t even understand or fathom</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="5.58">but that these big tech sensors were</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="5.37">trying to make a large move to silence</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="5.76">dissidents and to do something a</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="6.18">nefarious and obviously you see the</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="5.67">repercussions this is the cover of</text>

  <text start="334.8" dur="4.89">any means but I can tell you right now</text>
  <text start="336.63" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s pretty fair and balanced and this</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="4.23">to be the headline here right after we</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="5.43">have this conversation as told to us</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="5.16">through the anton&amp;#39;s who picked it up I</text>
  <text start="346.95" dur="3.66">thought this was very interesting so I</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="2.67">want to kind of share this conversation</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="2.91">with you right now I thought it was</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="3.54">pretty interesting so the Anton starts</text>
  <text start="353.52" dur="2.97">by saying I worked at Google what</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="3.21">happened today was incredible and</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="3.93">unprecedented well done Q well done and</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="4.41">one of the Anton&amp;#39;s responds what</text>
  <text start="360.42" dur="5.01">happened and the person responds Google</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="4.65">was attempting a massive move an archive</text>

  <text start="376.92" dur="4.26">let&amp;#39;s just let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s pause there and</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="5.49">read and take that statement as a</text>
  <text start="381.18" dur="5.91">speculative theory what does that mean</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="5.49">for these big tech companies it means</text>
  <text start="387.09" dur="6.09">that when they have made this push</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="5.72">allegedly behind the scenes to cover up</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="5.43">a large swath of incriminating evidence</text>
  <text start="395.6" dur="4.93">because they understand look they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="3.57">gonna you know what they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="400.53" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to cover up the fact</text>
  <text start="402.18" dur="3.39">that they&amp;#39;ve been censoring us they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="407.13" dur="3.78">gonna try to cover up the fact that</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;ve been weaponizing their</text>
  <text start="410.91" dur="4.71">algorithms and their quote/unquote</text>
  <text start="412.47" dur="5.01">machine learning to target conservative</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="4.08">opinions they are gonna cover up the</text>
  <text start="417.48" dur="4.89">fact that in the lead-up to an election</text>
  <text start="419.7" dur="5.34">that as you know they learn their lesson</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="4.17">back in 2016 and then in 2018 they</text>
  <text start="425.04" dur="4.11">learned how to weaponize social media</text>
  <text start="426.54" dur="5.31">you know what I think we let them do it</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="5.19">we set the trap president Trump is a</text>
  <text start="431.85" dur="5.25">genius what did President Trump do</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="6">President Trump allowed them to exert</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="4.92">their influence in the 2018 elections so</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="5.19">that they could start to build cases</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="6.6">against social media to show very</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="5.13">without without a doubt that they&amp;#39;ve put</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="3.81">their hands on the scale and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="450.66" dur="6.27">taken a political stance they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="6.66">violating the section 230 of the</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="4.62">Communications Decency Act and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="4.68">engaged in tortious interference against</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="4.8">creators and people that in the sense</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="4.2">that we&amp;#39;re in a contract a social</text>
  <text start="466.35" dur="4.26">contradict business contract if you will</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="4.68">as creators on their platform where</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ve agreed not to infringe upon our</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="3.78">rights in such a way and our civil</text>
  <text start="474.36" dur="5.13">rights but they have decided to go</text>
  <text start="476.43" dur="5.73">outside of their legal abilities and to</text>
  <text start="479.49" dur="4.2">do that so what President Trump did was</text>
  <text start="482.16" dur="3.42">and then not to mention the fact that</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s an in-kind donation if a</text>
  <text start="485.58" dur="5.01">multinational corporation in that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="6.029">that&amp;#39;s base in America who is basically</text>
  <text start="490.59" dur="5.73">held within the standard of what you</text>
  <text start="493.919" dur="4.921">know financial contribution laws exist</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="5.22">for campaigns and donations they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="5.94">obviously violated it if they&amp;#39;re using a</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="5.879">multi-billion dollar platform against</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="5.43">certain political opinions they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="507.419" dur="3.991">obviously got themselves in big trouble</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="3.93">and they tried to delete all the</text>
  <text start="511.41" dur="4.89">evidence yesterday and I believe</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="4.529">possibly allegedly and we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="516.3" dur="4.53">Sunday yes so a couple days ago but they</text>
  <text start="518.669" dur="4.49">tried to do that and the internet got</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="2.329">shut down</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="6.4">come on anyway they go on in this</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="5.11">conversation to talk about how where it</text>
  <text start="530.01" dur="4.69">went down how it went down</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="3.84">all the different servers that were in</text>
  <text start="534.7" dur="3.66">existence that Google&amp;#39;s running it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.71" dur="4.56">estimated they&amp;#39;re running millions of</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="4.64">servers to keep the Internet of their</text>
  <text start="541.27" dur="3.75">internet going I guess they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543" dur="5.47">incredible search engine that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="545.02" dur="5.43">put together but this is really one of</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="5.34">those stories that you have to take in</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="6.42">the context of kind of realizing where</text>
  <text start="553.81" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re at and how we&amp;#39;re so under attack</text>
  <text start="556.87" dur="6.14">at this point by all sides of it that</text>
  <text start="560.86" dur="4.44">when you see these kind of little</text>
  <text start="563.01" dur="3.7">stories it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s something to hold</text>
  <text start="565.3" dur="2.88">onto to say look you know there is</text>
  <text start="566.71" dur="3.9">something happening behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="568.18" dur="4.32">still because we&amp;#39;ve had proofs we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="570.61" dur="4.94">everything all the evidence that we need</text>
  <text start="572.5" dur="6.75">to know that the good guys are working</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="6.4">24/7 365 right now to try to put this</text>
  <text start="579.25" dur="4.2">back in order while at the same time</text>

  <text start="926.74" dur="5.039">I can&amp;#39;t stand about Alex these days is</text>
  <text start="928.54" dur="6.01">that he&amp;#39;s got this kind of way about him</text>
  <text start="931.779" dur="4.481">where he seems to offer you in all</text>
  <text start="934.55" dur="3.51">but then right as you go to grab the</text>

  <text start="1161.5" dur="2.549">me and I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t have anything to</text>
  <text start="1163.299" dur="2.37">say about him</text>
  <text start="1164.049" dur="3.301">well isn&amp;#39;t that very convenient that</text>
  <text start="1165.669" dur="3.21">he&amp;#39;s being sued by him wouldn&amp;#39;t that be</text>
  <text start="1167.35" dur="3">a great way to kind of disassociate</text>
  <text start="1168.879" dur="3.811">yourself from somebody if you knew that</text>
  <text start="1170.35" dur="5.039">your cover had been blown just throwing</text>
  <text start="1172.69" dur="4.349">it out there as a hypothetical and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1175.389" dur="3.301">not making any accusations here I want</text>
  <text start="1177.039" dur="3.331">to make that very clear I&amp;#39;m merely</text>
  <text start="1178.69" dur="5.52">looking at this information and saying</text>
  <text start="1180.37" dur="5.58">well what do we see here and like to get</text>
  <text start="1184.21" dur="4.679">back to two other things that that</text>
  <text start="1185.95" dur="5.099">talked about it you know the one that</text>
  <text start="1188.889" dur="3.931">was most recent I think was here where</text>
  <text start="1191.049" dur="4.38">it talked about in September again of</text>
  <text start="1192.82" dur="4.92">2018 it was talking about Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="1195.429" dur="5.461">that was the template that was designed</text>
  <text start="1197.74" dur="4.71">to attack censor q-not so</text>
  <text start="1200.89" dur="3.75">everything that&amp;#39;s been happening to him</text>
  <text start="1202.45" dur="4.35">has been setting precedents and by</text>
  <text start="1204.64" dur="4.11">setting precedents you&amp;#39;re able to go</text>
  <text start="1206.8" dur="3.81">after other be individuals and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1208.75" dur="3.71">assuming that they would have eventually</text>
  <text start="1210.61" dur="5.12">worked their way down the line to Q</text>
  <text start="1212.46" dur="5.56">individuals and I&amp;#39;m sure actually now</text>
  <text start="1215.73" dur="5.32">that this whole internet kill switch</text>
  <text start="1218.02" dur="5.79">could have been because they were going</text>
  <text start="1221.05" dur="4.86">to start to go after Q reporters and</text>
  <text start="1223.81" dur="4.98">they literally turned off the internet</text>
  <text start="1225.91" dur="4.35">on them to show them that you know</text>
  <text start="1228.79" dur="4.56">something might be going on but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1230.26" dur="4.89">purely speculative and that&amp;#39;s the funny</text>
  <text start="1233.35" dur="4.83">part too is that when you look at how</text>
  <text start="1235.15" dur="4.71">upset Alex Jones gets about you know the</text>
  <text start="1238.18" dur="4.17">movement and the one thing I thought was</text>
  <text start="1239.86" dur="5.37">very interesting is he sits here the</text>
  <text start="1242.35" dur="4.5">first 45 minutes or so of the interview</text>
  <text start="1245.23" dur="3.99">is him with a lawyer and the lawyer</text>
  <text start="1246.85" dur="5.01">doesn&amp;#39;t want to say anything and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1249.22" dur="6">almost like he was worried or this is</text>
  <text start="1251.86" dur="5.4">some sort of person who is I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1255.22" dur="4.47">to say a handler I just want to say like</text>
  <text start="1257.26" dur="3.93">he doesn&amp;#39;t want to say anything wrong</text>
  <text start="1259.69" dur="4.8">and he wants somebody to be able to</text>
  <text start="1261.19" dur="5.97">pivot to in case a point is made that he</text>
  <text start="1264.49" dur="5.49">can&amp;#39;t rebut quick enough</text>
  <text start="1267.16" dur="4.53">which is fine that&amp;#39;s a perfectly fine</text>
  <text start="1269.98" dur="4.41">way to have a conversation I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1271.69" dur="4.71">making any accusations of course but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1274.39" dur="5.07">just making speculative theory here and</text>
  <text start="1276.4" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m saying that what it is to me is they</text>
  <text start="1279.46" dur="4.17">kept agreeing throughout this interview</text>
  <text start="1280.84" dur="4.8">about how you know it&amp;#39;s positive what</text>
  <text start="1283.63" dur="3.84">the Q movement is doing but then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1285.64" dur="3.93">just this air of Alex Jones where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1287.47" dur="4.74">like I&amp;#39;m a millionaire I&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="1289.57" dur="4.47">this for 25 30 years nobody else</text>
  <text start="1292.21" dur="4.35">deserves to do this kind of work</text>
  <text start="1294.04" dur="5.61">I&amp;#39;ve he says this whole rant about how</text>
  <text start="1296.56" dur="5.07">his family is has done pretty bad stuff</text>
  <text start="1299.65" dur="3.45">which is like all right well could you</text>
  <text start="1301.63" dur="2.7">give us a little more context on that</text>
  <text start="1303.1" dur="3.6">besides just saying your family&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1304.33" dur="6.72">bunch of killers like that&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="1306.7" dur="5.91">weird to be ranting that way because</text>
  <text start="1311.05" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;ve had family that serves in the in</text>
  <text start="1312.61" dur="5.04">the armed services</text>
  <text start="1314.86" dur="5.76">you know who put their lives on the line</text>
  <text start="1317.65" dur="4.74">in World War two and none of them or</text>
  <text start="1320.62" dur="3.27">after in Korea and I should say I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1322.39" dur="5.13">want to be incorrect first time you</text>
  <text start="1323.89" dur="6.36">don&amp;#39;t you know people upset but look I</text>
  <text start="1327.52" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t characterize them that way</text>
  <text start="1330.25" dur="4.2">so it&amp;#39;s a scary way to say things and</text>
  <text start="1332.41" dur="2.46">then he makes this kind of threat and</text>
  <text start="1334.45" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1334.87" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;re just watching it seems like a</text>
  <text start="1337.42" dur="5.43">very insecure man who is making a very</text>
  <text start="1339.82" dur="7.53">insecure plea to his audience to say</text>
  <text start="1342.85" dur="6.09">look you know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know all</text>
  <text start="1347.35" dur="3.48">right I don&amp;#39;t know she&amp;#39;s like I just</text>
  <text start="1348.94" dur="4.26">want dis he wants to like disassociate</text>
  <text start="1350.83" dur="4.62">himself with Q but then associated</text>
  <text start="1353.2" dur="5.61">himself with the Q audience that that</text>
  <text start="1355.45" dur="4.56">makes sense so I don&amp;#39;t know what this is</text>
  <text start="1358.81" dur="2.88">you guys let me know what you think</text>
  <text start="1360.01" dur="4.83">because I have feelings both ways I</text>
  <text start="1361.69" dur="5.01">think anything&amp;#39;s really possible yes Q</text>
  <text start="1364.84" dur="3.09">does do disinformation yeah it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1366.7" dur="3.15">possible it could have just thrown us</text>
  <text start="1367.93" dur="3.42">off the trail he made a lot of claims in</text>
  <text start="1369.85" dur="3.3">this interview he claims that he&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="1371.35" dur="3.3">Alex Jones does he&amp;#39;s still having</text>
  <text start="1373.15" dur="3.45">conversations with President Trump he</text>
  <text start="1374.65" dur="3.84">claims that he&amp;#39;s in think tanks in</text>
  <text start="1376.6" dur="4.02">Washington he makes some more absurd</text>
  <text start="1378.49" dur="6.48">claims which is like why isn&amp;#39;t Q out</text>
  <text start="1380.62" dur="6.48">yelling it you know sundar pichai well</text>
  <text start="1384.97" dur="4.14">guess what Q is probably Q plus is at</text>
  <text start="1387.1" dur="4.65">least probably president Trump and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1389.11" dur="4.83">browbeating sundar every day and the</text>
  <text start="1391.75" dur="4.65">rest of them and Jack Dorsey and all of</text>
  <text start="1393.94" dur="5.97">those people so it just doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1396.4" dur="5.76">sense to me and then you know what is</text>
  <text start="1399.91" dur="4.65">who is Alex Jones really I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1402.16" dur="4.2">just a guy who is doing what we all are</text>
  <text start="1404.56" dur="4.34">doing right we&amp;#39;re all talking about the</text>
  <text start="1406.36" dur="5.06">truth we&amp;#39;re doing logical you know</text>
  <text start="1408.9" dur="5.2">fact-finding we&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="1411.42" dur="4">comprehensive research so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1414.1" dur="3.24">understand why he&amp;#39;s so threatened other</text>
  <text start="1415.42" dur="4.26">than he&amp;#39;s built this Empire and he wants</text>
  <text start="1417.34" dur="4.47">to be the media who&amp;#39;s been trying to</text>
  <text start="1419.68" dur="6.21">destroy him it&amp;#39;s kind of sad he wants to</text>
  <text start="1421.81" dur="6.3">be CNN he wants to be Fox News and he</text>
  <text start="1425.89" dur="3.9">realizes that he&amp;#39;s losing some market</text>
  <text start="1428.11" dur="3.33">share I guess and he&amp;#39;s really upset by</text>
  <text start="1429.79" dur="4.65">that but then he says you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1431.44" dur="3.93">because he&amp;#39;s a Mossad I don&amp;#39;t know it</text>
  <text start="1434.44" dur="2.4">could be anything</text>
  <text start="1435.37" dur="2.67">is what I&amp;#39;m saying all right and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1436.84" dur="3.03">just gonna leave it to you guys in the</text>
  <text start="1438.04" dur="3.45">comments because I know this one will be</text>
  <text start="1439.87" dur="3.66">divisive because people are going to be</text>
  <text start="1441.49" dur="4.35">either really Pro Alec so they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1443.53" dur="3.54">be really Pro Q or or hopefully there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1445.84" dur="4.02">be a lot of people who are in the middle</text>
  <text start="1447.07" dur="4.17">who can see that you know some people</text>
  <text start="1449.86" dur="3.54">make mistakes let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="1451.24" dur="3.75">hypothetically that Alex would admit</text>
  <text start="1453.4" dur="4.14">that he made a mistake in hiring jerome</text>
  <text start="1454.99" dur="6.09">corsi in that jerome corsi really has no</text>
  <text start="1457.54" dur="6.69">affiliation to him what he does could it</text>
  <text start="1461.08" dur="4.74">be that we could you know those who are</text>
  <text start="1464.23" dur="3.63">on the other side of this issue could we</text>
  <text start="1465.82" dur="2.68">open up that door and say yeah let him</text>
  <text start="1467.86" dur="3.37">back in</text>
  <text start="1468.5" dur="4.62">to me I&amp;#39;m a Christian I know that</text>
  <text start="1471.23" dur="3.62">Redemption is real I know that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1473.12" dur="4.2">chance for us all to become better</text>
  <text start="1474.85" dur="3.73">through through Christ our Lord and</text>
  <text start="1477.32" dur="2.58">that&amp;#39;s one of the things that&amp;#39;s reason</text>
  <text start="1478.58" dur="3.57">why I don&amp;#39;t watch a show really anymore</text>
  <text start="1479.9" dur="5.42">to be quite honest with everyone is</text>
  <text start="1482.15" dur="7.35">mostly because I don&amp;#39;t like the way he</text>
  <text start="1485.32" dur="6.19">casually you know disrespects God here</text>
  <text start="1489.5" dur="4.86">and there and that he the way that he</text>
  <text start="1491.51" dur="5.21">doesn&amp;#39;t really pay homage to Christ and</text>
  <text start="1494.36" dur="4.77">in the way that I think that you know</text>
  <text start="1496.72" dur="4.09">individuals should I mean it&amp;#39;s just my</text>
  <text start="1499.13" dur="3.84">humble opinion I&amp;#39;m not perfect this is</text>
  <text start="1500.81" dur="3.9">just the way I do it I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="1502.97" dur="3.36">anybody else needs to do it any</text>
  <text start="1504.71" dur="2.28">differently I&amp;#39;m just saying it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1506.33" dur="3.93">work for me</text>
  <text start="1506.99" dur="4.85">and that&amp;#39;s pretty much where I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1510.26" dur="3.87">leave it I hope this episode was</text>
  <text start="1511.84" dur="3.76">informative I hope it gave you a new</text>
  <text start="1514.13" dur="4.05">perspective and I don&amp;#39;t want this to be</text>
