  <text start="295.75" dur="5.04">into the latest news stories first of</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="6.18">all this is the big story I guess there</text>
  <text start="300.79" dur="5.4">is a protest in Portland where you have</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="5.34">people coming from what they call the</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="7.02">proud boys or just Patriot organization</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="6.45">here to confront as the media would put</text>
  <text start="313.21" dur="4.83">it the anti feh which have basically</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="5.75">taken over the city of Portland mind you</text>
  <text start="318.04" dur="6.99">and the mayor has been you know</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="5.17">supporting them and and keeping the</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="5.52">police from trying from arresting them</text>
  <text start="326.95" dur="7.71">for their violent actions and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="6.33">active form of insurrection in to me it</text>
  <text start="334.66" dur="4.56">reminds me of it like an insurgency</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="4.62">where you have an entire city that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.22" dur="4.65">basically a no-go zone for people who</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="4.65">are you know I&amp;#39;m not saying everyone and</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="3.72">the proud boys is perfect because there</text>
  <text start="346.15" dur="3.81">are always gonna be crazy people on</text>
  <text start="347.59" dur="6.81">every organization but it would seem</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="9.14">that Portland has become over time some</text>
  <text start="354.4" dur="8.16">sort of insurgent haven for these</text>
  <text start="359.1" dur="4.47">anti-american anti-fascists that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="3.84">they call themselves</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="4.18">fascists it&amp;#39;s funny that they call</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="2.97">themselves anti-fascist but then they</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="4.86">are fascists in the way that they act</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="4.41">and there&amp;#39;s they seem to think that</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="4.67">they&amp;#39;re fighting against some sort of</text>
  <text start="373.78" dur="8.19">injustice that they are quote unquote</text>
  <text start="377.28" dur="7.96">you know punching Nazis right or or</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="5.43">fighting Nazism or white supremacy but</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="5.7">this is all because they&amp;#39;re continuously</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="6.12">an I should say continually ginned up by</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="5.4">the media with this rhetoric of not</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="6.3">white supremacy this in Nazi</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="5.52">that and all these different narratives</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="3.87">that are being force-fed on them so</text>
  <text start="401.86" dur="4.44">these Patriots went to Marge and say</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="3.9">look we just have I mean if you even</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="3.75">look at this like just from an objective</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="5.22">standpoint the people who came together</text>
  <text start="410.05" dur="6.2">for the the March that was put together</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="7.41">by like Joe Biggs and the other guy</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="5.56">there you have to think of it this way</text>
  <text start="420.22" dur="4.08">they came to him and said look let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="4.1">let&amp;#39;s be honest let&amp;#39;s be you know</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="4.26">forthright with how we are gonna</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="4.3">approach this we&amp;#39;re gonna let</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="3.45">turn-the-other-cheek we&amp;#39;re gonna just</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="3.72">march to show that we can March and we</text>
  <text start="432.01" dur="3.36">can be here that we are American</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="4.38">citizens and we have the same rights as</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="7.08">you do to form and assemble and march</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="6.6">through the streets and the way aunt Eva</text>
  <text start="442.45" dur="6.62">responded is is indicative of their</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="8.94">entire culture that is this culture of</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="8.83">intimidation this culture of subversion</text>
  <text start="453.85" dur="6.24">and and a push toward violence so</text>
  <text start="457.9" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve started attacking these people</text>
  <text start="460.09" dur="4.44">and of course there was violence on both</text>
  <text start="462.22" dur="3.72">sides I&amp;#39;m not trying to polarize this to</text>
  <text start="464.53" dur="2.27">say that there&amp;#39;s one side that&amp;#39;s better</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="3.09">than the other</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="4">obviously in my opinion there is one</text>
  <text start="469.03" dur="5.85">side that&amp;#39;s more rational and logical</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="6.6">and seeking justice than the other but</text>
  <text start="474.88" dur="3.99">that is not what I&amp;#39;m here to say when</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;m here say is that if you just try to</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="6.93">look at this objectively we&amp;#39;re standing</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="6.3">and saying that we can people who have</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="5.4">an opposing opinion can have the same</text>
  <text start="488.95" dur="3.75">freedoms that you do you can&amp;#39;t call us a</text>
  <text start="491.2" dur="5.25">Nazi and hit us over the head with bike</text>
  <text start="492.7" dur="6.36">locks and baseball bats and attack us</text>
  <text start="496.45" dur="5.1">and chase us Jack down because you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="499.06" dur="5.13">psychotic person who thinks that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="5.07">what we are all about when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="4.47">obviously not true I mean here in</text>
  <text start="506.62" dur="4.53">president Trump&amp;#39;s own words he says</text>
  <text start="508.66" dur="6.72">major consideration is being given to</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="6.93">naming antifa a quote organization of</text>
  <text start="515.38" dur="4.829">terror unquote portland is being watched</text>
  <text start="518.08" dur="5.85">very closely hopefully the mayor will be</text>
  <text start="520.209" dur="7.281">able to properly do his job this is not</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="5.82">about you know politics this is about</text>
  <text start="527.49" dur="5.68">actual criminal</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="4.89">criminal gangs roaming the streets and</text>
  <text start="533.17" dur="3.39">what I thought was really interesting is</text>
  <text start="534.64" dur="5.129">somebody pointed out the fact that you</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="5.13">can&amp;#39;t categorize them as terror because</text>
  <text start="539.769" dur="6.181">a lot of people argue well there is no</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="6.57">actual you know chain of command it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.95" dur="4.11">just a an idea that people are taking on</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="5.61">to go out and commit violence with well</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="6.42">that is is a scary simple slippery slope</text>
  <text start="553.87" dur="4.19">in my opinion but you could apply the</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="4.34">same principle that was applied to a</text>
  <text start="558.06" dur="6.91">organisation like al-qaeda where</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="7.66">al-qaeda terrorists were just different</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="7.369">cells of individuals autonomous that</text>
  <text start="568.48" dur="8.97">united under a single defining mission</text>
  <text start="572.339" dur="8.471">or jihad against America so the to me</text>
  <text start="577.45" dur="5.79">think of it this way I see the slippery</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="5.219">slope as what if they try to use this</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="4.71">argument against q and on saying oh well</text>
  <text start="586.029" dur="3.81">there were these shooters that did this</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="4.77">or there was some psychopath who did</text>
  <text start="589.839" dur="9.091">that but the simple logical truth is</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="9.619">that antifa is an organized movement</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="6.659">that has been weaponized to attack</text>
  <text start="602.339" dur="6.821">law-abiding American citizens for their</text>
  <text start="605.589" dur="7.921">First Amendment rights and that is in</text>
  <text start="609.16" dur="7.41">and of itself a crime that has to be</text>
  <text start="613.51" dur="4.86">brought to justice as far as the many</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="4.35">people who have had their personal</text>
  <text start="618.37" dur="4.589">individual rights violated and queued on</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="3.99">has never promoted anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="622.959" dur="2.69">violent if anything like I&amp;#39;ve said here</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="6.179">on this channel</text>
  <text start="625.649" dur="7.81">me personally I&amp;#39;m 100% in favor of</text>
  <text start="631.089" dur="4.62">bringing us together and getting our</text>
  <text start="633.459" dur="4.651">country to be made great again how about</text>
  <text start="635.709" dur="4.56">that for a novel idea let&amp;#39;s try to make</text>

  <text start="1323.66" dur="7.71">more broad geopolitical perspective and</text>
  <text start="1327.41" dur="8.08">say you know why did</text>
  <text start="1331.37" dur="7.06">pootin order the movement into Ukraine</text>

  <text start="1338.43" dur="5.01">that it was the dawn bass region but you</text>
  <text start="1341.7" dur="3.33">have to think of these things in context</text>
  <text start="1343.44" dur="3.69">and understand that these were</text>
  <text start="1345.03" dur="5.76">secessions that were bought and paid for</text>

  <text start="1361.89" dur="4.95">and this is a very fascinating thing so</text>
  <text start="1364.95" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;ll leave some links you guys check it</text>
  <text start="1366.84" dur="5.82">out but never forget that the exact same</text>

  <text start="1372.66" dur="6.48">force ran Obama&amp;#39;s deep State Hillary and</text>
  <text start="1375.72" dur="7.2">Muller investigations so these same</text>
