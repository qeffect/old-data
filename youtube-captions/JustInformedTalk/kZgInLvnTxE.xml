  <text start="139.95" dur="4.47">starting with this story obviously today</text>
  <text start="141.659" dur="5.22">June 10 2009 teen or yesterday I guess</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="5.459">depending on where you are a pilot was</text>
  <text start="146.879" dur="4.92">in a fatal helicopter crash who was</text>
  <text start="149.879" dur="4.801">apparently conducting executive travel</text>
  <text start="151.799" dur="5.011">inside of New York City now there is an</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="4.559">incredible amount of coincidences</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="4.14">surrounding this incident that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="3.33">gonna look at that a lot of the Anton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="3.42">have been digging on that seemed to</text>
  <text start="162.569" dur="4.471">point to the fact that there was a lot</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="4.229">more going on in this building and the</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="5.58">building itself one of its primary</text>
  <text start="168.599" dur="6.48">tenants was listed by queue back in 2017</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="3.989">as somebody that we should be digging on</text>
  <text start="175.079" dur="4.02">and once you start putting these pieces</text>
  <text start="176.609" dur="5.25">together I&amp;#39;m gonna say this right now on</text>
  <text start="179.099" dur="4.621">the front at the front end of this video</text>
  <text start="181.859" dur="4.171">I want to say this looks like it</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="5.31">possibly could have been some sort of</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="4.679">cover for right now obviously thoughts</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="5.429">and prayers the family of the deceased</text>
  <text start="190.709" dur="5.491">pilot but without getting too</text>
  <text start="194.459" dur="3.721">conspiratorial here because we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="196.2" dur="6.749">to try to stay in a and sort of a</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="7.32">fact-based fact-finding mode I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="202.949" dur="4.831">just preface this by saying that it is</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="3.659">possible to remote control a helicopter</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="5.579">just throwing it out there</text>
  <text start="209.159" dur="8.01">so that is what it is but it&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="213.359" dur="6.871">here that a pilot in the the helicopter</text>
  <text start="217.169" dur="4.831">crash fatally was wounded and lost his</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="4.589">life but what&amp;#39;s interesting about this</text>
  <text start="222" dur="4.47">is there was bad weather and apparently</text>
  <text start="224.819" dur="3.48">they were saying that you know he got</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="4.169">lost and then ended up crashing into</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="4.891">this building well when I mapped all of</text>
  <text start="230.639" dur="5.581">this out nothing made sense so the way</text>
  <text start="233.19" dur="6.509">this story goes is this way I guess that</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="7.56">from somewhere the pilot had picked up</text>
  <text start="239.699" dur="6.271">his client who is an Italian businessman</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="4.23">and if we all know anything about Italy</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s very closely tied to China now</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="7.319">especially some of the more let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="6.959">corrupt factions and when you actually</text>
  <text start="255.329" dur="5.19">plug all this in right it doesn&amp;#39;t make a</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="4.77">whole lot of sense okay so apparently</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="5.221">the pilot dropped off his client here at</text>
  <text start="263.159" dur="7.441">the 30 West 30th Street heliport</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="8.429">which is in midtown Manhattan and then</text>
  <text start="270.6" dur="6.42">the official story is that the pilot was</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="5.701">going to travel from here at the West</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="5.869">38th Street heliport back to Linden New</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.22">Jersey where presumably there is a</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="4.481">facility where the the helicopter should</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="5.25">be able to land one of their their</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="6.389">operating base I believe so that was the</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="5.52">official story and then somehow after 11</text>
  <text start="293.759" dur="5.461">minutes after takeoff from this location</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="5.279">here with West 30th Street it ended up</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="4.41">crashing on top of this building the</text>
  <text start="301.139" dur="4.741">axe&amp;#39; equitable building in midtown</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="5.55">Manhattan in Hell&amp;#39;s Kitchen here which</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="6.33">is only a few blocks from Trump Tower so</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="5.73">this is a very interesting to consider</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="5.4">so what happened the helicopter I guess</text>
  <text start="314.91" dur="4.97">crashed onto the roof in a crash landing</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="4.679">after radioing it needed help and</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="5.23">subsequently emergency responder</text>
  <text start="322.289" dur="4.591">emergency personnel responded and the</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="3.209">situation was brought under control now</text>
  <text start="326.88" dur="5.129">I know a lot of people in New York</text>
  <text start="328.319" dur="5.97">obviously whenever they hear this kind</text>
  <text start="332.009" dur="3.84">of thing happened it really brings like</text>
  <text start="334.289" dur="3.841">bad memories so it was obviously a</text>
  <text start="335.849" dur="4.35">tragic and disturbing thing for a lot of</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="3.48">people to see today but my contention is</text>
  <text start="340.199" dur="3.931">could there have been more to the story</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="5.04">than we first are reading especially</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="4.86">getting as far as reports from the</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="3.9">mainstream media now why do I say that</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="3.57">well one of the Anton&amp;#39;s who was doing</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="3.929">this incredible dig found some very</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="3.81">fascinating information I think we</text>
  <text start="354.479" dur="5.22">should all be looking at so it talks</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="5.579">about Q post 238 now what is Q post 238</text>
  <text start="359.699" dur="3.81">q boss 238 is something that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="361.949" dur="3.541">covered here on the channel in one of</text>
  <text start="363.509" dur="5.431">the original posts back from November of</text>
  <text start="365.49" dur="4.019">2017 where it says happy our Sidley</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="5.969">Austin</text>
  <text start="369.509" dur="8.34">happy hunting q hmm well what is Sidley</text>
  <text start="374.909" dur="4.98">Austin who is Sidley Austin this is a</text>
  <text start="377.849" dur="4.82">question I think we should all look at</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="5.58">so first of all Sidley Austin is a</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="5.141">general practice law firm that is based</text>
  <text start="385.469" dur="5.221">in the United States and this is a law</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="5.76">firm that was founded through the</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="5.36">merging of two very historic law firms</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="4.34">one Sidley &amp;amp; Austin which was found in</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="4.2">1866 and</text>
  <text start="397.91" dur="4.59">new york-based law firm brown and wood</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="5">which was founded back in 1914 and now</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="6.12">they are headquartered in Chicago</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="6.46">downtown Chicago one South Dearborn so</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="4.47">this is really something that you should</text>
  <text start="411.71" dur="2.34">look at and then one of the other things</text>
  <text start="413.09" dur="3.12">that I thought was interesting when I</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="4.19">was reading into their backstory is that</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="4.38">they actually had offices one of the</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="6.81">brown and wood which was one of the</text>
  <text start="420.59" dur="7.2">firms that merged into Sidley Austin was</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="5.35">actually headquartered in the World</text>
  <text start="427.79" dur="4.05">Trade Center prior to 9/11 so this was</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="3">really something I thought was</text>
  <text start="431.84" dur="2.7">fascinating and interesting and if</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re saying what does this have to do</text>
  <text start="434.54" dur="6">with the helicopter crash and the access</text>
  <text start="438.05" dur="4.77">building well here you go so the actual</text>
  <text start="440.54" dur="4.38">except equitable center which is in</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="4.14">downtown New York in Manhattan in</text>
  <text start="444.92" dur="4.32">midtown Manhattan this is the skyscraper</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="4.77">word the crash occurred was actually the</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="5.64">headquarters to none other than you</text>
  <text start="451.73" dur="7.56">guessed it Sidley Austin limited like</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="6.48">limited liability partnership and so</text>
  <text start="459.29" dur="3.63">this is where their offices are</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="3.33">headquartered I can&amp;#39;t tell you exactly</text>
  <text start="462.92" dur="3.57">what floor that they are on but I can</text>
  <text start="464.69" dur="4.05">tell you that when a helicopter hits a</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="4.62">building you&amp;#39;re going to have a complete</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="5.55">evacuation that might be the perfect</text>
  <text start="471.11" dur="6.95">time for information to be extracted</text>
  <text start="474.29" dur="7.98">from offices that may otherwise be</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="5.35">usually inhabited if that makes sense</text>
  <text start="482.27" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m trying to look at this</text>
  <text start="483.41" dur="4.68">more of what it could have been the</text>
  <text start="485.96" dur="4.74">question really here is we have this</text>
  <text start="488.09" dur="6.66">helicopter crash it&amp;#39;s true tragedy</text>
  <text start="490.7" dur="6.09">obviously for the the loss of life there</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="4.41">but we&amp;#39;re also looking at the</text>
  <text start="496.79" dur="3.72">possibility of you know what this could</text>
  <text start="499.16" dur="3.12">more broadly mean and that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="500.51" dur="4.04">Anton was pointing out here and what</text>
  <text start="502.28" dur="4.44">they also go on to point out was that</text>
  <text start="504.55" dur="5.02">Sidley Austin was the one that we were</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="4.41">told by q was a something we should</text>
  <text start="509.57" dur="4.08">start digging on apparently a lot of</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="4.83">Anton&amp;#39;s did dig on this so they&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="513.65" dur="4.319">LLP that was representing VTB which was</text>
  <text start="515.96" dur="3.45">a Russian bank that contributed three</text>
  <text start="517.969" dur="4.081">hundred and eighty five thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="519.41" dur="4.14">to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Sidley</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="4.56">Austin is registered as a representative</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="5.01">of foreign agents representing VTB and</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="4.29">if you want proof of that is actually</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="4.41">included documentation of it</text>
  <text start="530.9" dur="8.3">they actually have documented evidence</text>
  <text start="532.97" dur="9.75">showing that this VTB Bank is being</text>
  <text start="539.2" dur="6.01">represented by Sidley Austin as far as</text>

  <text start="549.89" dur="3.9">American soil that was something that</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="3.93">was interesting to note and then I</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="5.79">picked that up really quickly and then</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="8.16">it went on to say that the whole reason</text>
  <text start="559.58" dur="6.29">that they were giving these donations to</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="4.29">Hillary Clinton was to lobby about</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="6.04">sanctions and that&amp;#39;s covered here in</text>
  <text start="568.43" dur="5.13">this Sidley Austin document that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="571.91" dur="3.39">shown here as part of the fair</text>
  <text start="573.56" dur="3.78">registration we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="575.3" dur="3.3">admission the initial matter is the</text>

  <text start="689.84" dur="6.63">there trying to effectively push their</text>
  <text start="693.49" dur="5.23">influence now why does this matter well</text>
  <text start="696.47" dur="5.73">this matters because it all ties back to</text>
  <text start="698.72" dur="6.54">the fact that we had this cue post here</text>
  <text start="702.2" dur="5.07">which was given to us back in November</text>
  <text start="705.26" dur="4.08">of 2017 where it says Sidley Austin</text>
  <text start="707.27" dur="4.11">happy hunting now the next very next</text>
  <text start="709.34" dur="4.02">post after that which I think is very</text>
  <text start="711.38" dur="4.68">important is where it says the Asia</text>
  <text start="713.36" dur="6.81">Foundation CIA and it gives this long</text>
  <text start="716.06" dur="5.13">code stringer as is happy hunting q okay</text>
  <text start="720.17" dur="3.3">so what does this have to do with</text>
  <text start="721.19" dur="3.84">anything well if you look at what the an</text>
  <text start="723.47" dur="3.57">on state as far as digging on the</text>
  <text start="725.03" dur="4.08">answers for this one there&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="727.04" dur="4.11">lot of really fascinating information in</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="3.78">here but what it says is that in its</text>
  <text start="731.15" dur="3.3">early history the Asia Foundation was</text>
  <text start="732.89" dur="4.05">under the State Department was focused</text>
  <text start="734.45" dur="5.58">on anti-communist efforts in China now</text>
  <text start="736.94" dur="4.74">it seems to be a CIA organization with</text>
  <text start="740.03" dur="6.06">focus on all Asian countries including</text>
  <text start="741.68" dur="6.84">India Pakistan and Afghanistan so what</text>
  <text start="746.09" dur="8.7">this is basically saying is that the</text>
  <text start="748.52" dur="9.03">Asia Foundation is a front for the what</text>
  <text start="754.79" dur="4.26">you would say is is an operation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="757.55" dur="5.04">being conducted by the clandestine</text>
  <text start="759.05" dur="5.46">intelligence services in order to keep</text>
  <text start="762.59" dur="4.68">an eye on Asia and what&amp;#39;s going on over</text>
  <text start="764.51" dur="4.23">there so why is that important and how</text>
  <text start="767.27" dur="3.39">does that all connect well if you think</text>
  <text start="768.74" dur="4.65">about where we&amp;#39;re at we have this report</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="4.65">coming out and this is one that just</text>
  <text start="773.39" dur="3.84">came out from the New York Post which is</text>
  <text start="775.31" dur="6.48">talking about how Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s brother</text>
  <text start="777.23" dur="6.66">was an informant for the CIA hmm now you</text>
  <text start="781.79" dur="2.7">all remember his brother here Kim</text>
  <text start="783.89" dur="4.44">jong-nam</text>
  <text start="784.49" dur="6.72">who was the brother of Kim jong-un and</text>
  <text start="788.33" dur="5.82">reportedly being backed by the Chinese</text>
  <text start="791.21" dur="5.25">Communist Party as a replacement for Kim</text>
  <text start="794.15" dur="4.14">Jong hoon now this is where it gets</text>
  <text start="796.46" dur="3.95">really crazy so I know I&amp;#39;m kind</text>
  <text start="798.29" dur="4.56">taking you guys all around on a full</text>
  <text start="800.41" dur="3.58">tangent here but this is really</text>
  <text start="802.85" dur="2.609">information that once you start</text>
  <text start="803.99" dur="2.76">connecting these dots and you do this</text>
  <text start="805.459" dur="2.221">work long enough you kind of can see</text>
  <text start="806.75" dur="3.93">right through it</text>
  <text start="807.68" dur="8.37">so we have a helicopter crash at a law</text>
  <text start="810.68" dur="8.76">firm in New York City that connects back</text>
  <text start="816.05" dur="7.529">to an original Q post from back in 2017</text>
  <text start="819.44" dur="9.629">where would it be too far of a stretch</text>
  <text start="823.579" dur="9.891">to say that any type of incident like</text>
  <text start="829.069" dur="7.231">this would give incredible time and</text>
  <text start="833.47" dur="5.109">ability for people who may be working</text>
  <text start="836.3" dur="5.459">clandestinely to access certain offices</text>
  <text start="838.579" dur="6.481">to access certain files to basically</text>
  <text start="841.759" dur="6.27">raid a entire office without anybody</text>
  <text start="845.06" dur="8.219">being around because of information that</text>
  <text start="848.029" dur="8.31">may be connecting certain let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="853.279" dur="4.74">clown organizations to operations in</text>
  <text start="856.339" dur="4.471">Asia which included supporting the</text>
  <text start="858.019" dur="5.971">Chinese Communist Party and helping Kim</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="4.649">jong-nam try to overthrow kim jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="863.99" dur="5.459">which is part of the reason why he was</text>
  <text start="865.459" dur="6.801">probably you know launching missiles</text>
  <text start="869.449" dur="5.101">over japan and and acting very very</text>
  <text start="872.26" dur="4.87">aggressively because he knew that the</text>
  <text start="874.55" dur="5.07">plan was to overthrow him and I mean</text>
  <text start="877.13" dur="4.949">they made movies about this don&amp;#39;t forget</text>
  <text start="879.62" dur="8.36">there was a whole Hollywood movie with</text>
  <text start="882.079" dur="11.07">there was some famous people the actors</text>
  <text start="887.98" dur="7.27">Seth Rogen and others who it was the</text>
  <text start="893.149" dur="8.101">whole premise of the movie was them</text>
  <text start="895.25" dur="8.43">actually operating a you know a secret</text>
  <text start="901.25" dur="4.26">mission to go and assassinate Kim Jung</text>
  <text start="903.68" dur="4.05">hoon that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s literally what</text>
  <text start="905.51" dur="5.129">the movie is about and it was a comedy</text>
  <text start="907.73" dur="5.159">and everyone laughed and then somebody</text>
  <text start="910.639" dur="4.921">hacked Sony and it was just you guys</text>
  <text start="912.889" dur="4.56">remember how bad that was but let me</text>
  <text start="915.56" dur="4.56">just tell you this right now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="917.449" dur="5.161">seeing is an incredible set of</text>
  <text start="920.12" dur="4.35">coincidences that I think if we kind of</text>
  <text start="922.61" dur="4.5">start tying them all together we look at</text>
  <text start="924.47" dur="5.88">the Asia Foundation one of their main</text>
  <text start="927.11" dur="4.74">offices is in New York City and they are</text>
  <text start="930.35" dur="5.54">certainly</text>
  <text start="931.85" dur="6.92">what you would call a multinational</text>
  <text start="935.89" dur="5.47">Foundation which is that they have</text>
  <text start="938.77" dur="4.72">offices in 18 different countries now</text>
  <text start="941.36" dur="5.88">the first thing I saw I thought when I</text>
  <text start="943.49" dur="5.64">saw this was hmm this looks like a front</text>
  <text start="947.24" dur="4.02">for an intelligence operation this looks</text>
  <text start="949.13" dur="5.07">like some kind of shell company for an</text>
  <text start="951.26" dur="4.32">intelligence operation and you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="954.2" dur="4.32">have to go ahead and make that decision</text>
  <text start="955.58" dur="4.92">for yourself because that&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="958.52" dur="4.35">the the level of information that we</text>
  <text start="960.5" dur="3.33">have right now on this dig I just</text>
  <text start="962.87" dur="2.34">thought I&amp;#39;d bring that to you and</text>
  <text start="963.83" dur="3.9">hopefully maybe this can get some of</text>
  <text start="965.21" dur="5.76">your you know kick the cans around in</text>
  <text start="967.73" dur="5.16">your head there and maybe get you to</text>
  <text start="970.97" dur="4.2">start looking at this information a</text>
  <text start="972.89" dur="4.74">little more critically especially when</text>
  <text start="975.17" dur="5.28">it comes to this helicopter crash that</text>
  <text start="977.63" dur="5.52">happened in New York City and what more</text>
  <text start="980.45" dur="4.98">might have been happening with that so</text>
  <text start="983.15" dur="4.65">obviously with that I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="985.43" dur="3.83">another story here first of all do you</text>
  <text start="987.8" dur="4.08">recognize anyone in this photo</text>
  <text start="989.26" dur="6.52">well the Genesee County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office</text>

  <text start="1025.72" dur="5.13">child exploitation that this is what</text>
  <text start="1028.959" dur="3.421">we&amp;#39;re doing and one of the things that</text>
  <text start="1030.85" dur="2.79">people were pointing out about this is</text>
  <text start="1032.38" dur="4.699">you have right here</text>
  <text start="1033.64" dur="7.14">Carl Spradlin who is Carl spradlin well</text>

  <text start="1049.3" dur="5.01">thankful to get these predators off the</text>
  <text start="1050.98" dur="5.7">streets and the reality is right now as</text>
  <text start="1054.31" dur="4.5">far as the story is reporting it says</text>
  <text start="1056.68" dur="3.87">the Genesee human oppression strike team</text>

  <text start="1063.82" dur="3.99">targeting children in Genesee count</text>
  <text start="1065.5" dur="5.4">for sexual purposes and this story just</text>
  <text start="1067.81" dur="5.04">gets even more disturbing and sick when</text>
  <text start="1070.9" dur="3.48">you look at the fact that there among</text>
  <text start="1072.85" dur="3.66">these individuals there&amp;#39;s a mother who</text>
  <text start="1074.38" dur="4.23">has been charged with human trafficking</text>

  <text start="1383.89" dur="3.39">God&amp;#39;s grace is greater when we talk</text>
  <text start="1385.84" dur="3.51">about God&amp;#39;s grace now it is truly</text>
  <text start="1387.28" dur="4.02">greater so so tonight I have a very</text>
  <text start="1389.35" dur="5.57">special verse I want to share with you</text>
  <text start="1391.3" dur="6.21">and it&amp;#39;s out of book of Galatians and</text>
  <text start="1394.92" dur="4.99">this first I think it really says a lot</text>
  <text start="1397.51" dur="4.11">about the way I try to live my life and</text>
  <text start="1399.91" dur="4.14">I hope that it helps you understand the</text>
  <text start="1401.62" dur="4.92">way that we&amp;#39;re called by Christ to live</text>
  <text start="1404.05" dur="4.8">our lives and it&amp;#39;s Galatians chapter 6</text>
  <text start="1406.54" dur="4.38">verse 6 through 10 and I want to share</text>
  <text start="1408.85" dur="4.29">this with you it says the one who has</text>
  <text start="1410.92" dur="5.07">taught the message must share his goods</text>
  <text start="1413.14" dur="5.58">with the teacher don&amp;#39;t be deceived God</text>
  <text start="1415.99" dur="5.76">is not mocked for whatever is whatever</text>
  <text start="1418.72" dur="5.31">meant whatever a man shows he will also</text>
  <text start="1421.75" dur="4.38">reap because the one who sews to his</text>
  <text start="1424.03" dur="5.19">flesh will reap corruption from the</text>
  <text start="1426.13" dur="5.79">flesh but the one who sews to the Spirit</text>
  <text start="1429.22" dur="6.24">will reap eternal life from the spirit</text>
  <text start="1431.92" dur="6.84">so we must not get tired of doing good</text>
  <text start="1435.46" dur="6.03">for we will reap at the proper time if</text>
  <text start="1438.76" dur="5.64">we don&amp;#39;t give up therefore as we have</text>
  <text start="1441.49" dur="4.92">opportunity we must work for the good of</text>
  <text start="1444.4" dur="4.29">all especially for those who belong to</text>
  <text start="1446.41" dur="6.18">the household of faith</text>
  <text start="1448.69" dur="6.26">and that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1452.59" dur="8.13">called to do we&amp;#39;re all called to</text>
  <text start="1454.95" dur="9.54">continue to understand that sewing good</text>
  <text start="1460.72" dur="7.17">into the world is how we become</text>
  <text start="1464.49" dur="5.2">eternally saved through Christ that is a</text>
  <text start="1467.89" dur="5.1">part of our eternal salvation but if you</text>
  <text start="1469.69" dur="4.53">sow to the flesh as it says here and you</text>
  <text start="1472.99" dur="2.91">know for those of you out there who</text>
  <text start="1474.22" dur="4.47">might not know I mean sowing is like</text>
  <text start="1475.9" dur="4.23">planting seeds you know your your and</text>
  <text start="1478.69" dur="3.33">then you would reap those seeds you</text>
  <text start="1480.13" dur="4.59">would read the benefits of what you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1482.02" dur="8.39">sown that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what the saying is so</text>
  <text start="1484.72" dur="9.21">I think to me this just reminds me that</text>
  <text start="1490.41" dur="6.19">whatever we put into the world that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1493.93" dur="5.31">what we&amp;#39;re getting back and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1496.6" dur="7.56">really an important idea when it comes</text>
  <text start="1499.24" dur="7.5">to how we understand our impact on the</text>
  <text start="1504.16" dur="6.78">world but then more overlie I love this</text>
  <text start="1506.74" dur="6.3">one line here where it says whatever our</text>
  <text start="1510.94" dur="3.96">man shows he will also reap because the</text>
  <text start="1513.04" dur="3.69">one who sews to his flesh will reap</text>
  <text start="1514.9" dur="4.17">corruption from the flesh but the one</text>
  <text start="1516.73" dur="4.92">who sews to the Spirit will reap eternal</text>
  <text start="1519.07" dur="5.85">life from the Spirit and that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="1521.65" dur="6.27">is if we sow to the spirit and our</text>
  <text start="1524.92" dur="5.19">connection to God then we will reap the</text>
  <text start="1527.92" dur="3.96">eternal salvation that&amp;#39;s been bought and</text>
  <text start="1530.11" dur="4.28">paid for with the blood of Jesus Christ</text>
  <text start="1531.88" dur="5.13">who died on the cross for our sins so</text>
  <text start="1534.39" dur="4.3">that&amp;#39;s my message to you I hope you can</text>
  <text start="1537.01" dur="3.86">pass that message to your family your</text>
  <text start="1538.69" dur="4.86">friends your loved ones your kids your</text>
  <text start="1540.87" dur="5.05">whoever just get the message out there</text>
  <text start="1543.55" dur="6">and and that&amp;#39;s how we change the world</text>
  <text start="1545.92" dur="5.76">we don&amp;#39;t change it by getting a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1549.55" dur="5.1">money or you know getting really famous</text>
  <text start="1551.68" dur="5.9">or doing all of these things that are of</text>
  <text start="1554.65" dur="5.16">the world of the flesh here we do it by</text>
  <text start="1557.58" dur="4.3">changing the hearts and minds of those</text>
  <text start="1559.81" dur="5.16">who have not yet really seen that</text>
  <text start="1561.88" dur="5.3">they&amp;#39;re saved or maybe no they are saved</text>
  <text start="1564.97" dur="4.32">but don&amp;#39;t fully embrace it and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1567.18" dur="5.08">understand that even though they might</text>
  <text start="1569.29" dur="4.26">not receive the the the benefits of</text>
  <text start="1572.26" dur="4.32">putting good into the world immediately</text>
  <text start="1573.55" dur="4.53">they might not reap those those rewards</text>
  <text start="1576.58" dur="3.81">so quickly</text>
  <text start="1578.08" dur="5.04">that if we keep sewing and keep faithful</text>
  <text start="1580.39" dur="5.46">in God eventually God will give you the</text>
  <text start="1583.12" dur="5.07">fruits of your labor and much much more</text>
  <text start="1585.85" dur="3.63">that we can&amp;#39;t even imagine so that&amp;#39;s</text>
