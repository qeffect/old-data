  <text start="75.99" dur="6.83">who have resigned and never been</text>
  <text start="77.58" dur="5.24">implicated Department of Justice was a</text>
  <text start="83.689" dur="5.411">holder Lynch and then rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="6.47">that was something I missed at the</text>
  <text start="89.1" dur="4.76">beginning I corrected it at the end but</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="7.84">that&amp;#39;s that is kind of what it was and</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="7.411">then we have and then 18 who are looking</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="6.57">who were corrupted in on it and then the</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="7.08">State Department obviously it was John</text>
  <text start="108.54" dur="5.16">Kerry and Hillary Clinton plus 41 so my</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="4.38">point out something interesting I that</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="4.949">might be referring to the 41 who are</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="4.64">involved with them and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="5.07">talk about something pretty incredible</text>
  <text start="121.13" dur="4.33">and it&amp;#39;s going to be referring to the</text>
  <text start="123.719" dur="4.08">senior executive service but we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="4.529">into that later I think it all is kind</text>
  <text start="127.799" dur="3.901">of possibly connected to what who the</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="3.541">Left behinds are from the Obama</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="3.85">administration&amp;#39;s stay behind swear</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="3.97">leaking and doing all type of stuff but</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="3.75">somebody also said that 41 could refer</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="7.4">to Bush</text>
  <text start="139.3" dur="10.05">I think HW Bush the 41st president so</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="7.21">anything&amp;#39;s possible they&amp;#39;re moving on it</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="6.33">also pointed out that you know slant is</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="5.7">a bias but one of the things that I</text>
  <text start="155.68" dur="6.63">missed here that people wanted me to</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="6.63">cover was you guys can read through this</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="3.48">you know you go watch the last video if</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="3.48">you want to kind of breakdown at what</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="4.59">all this means but then they said oh I</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="6.48">missed this election theft last hope</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="5.16">congressional focus impeach well I</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="3.33">thought that was kind of</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="3.65">self-explanatory but maybe it does</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="5.13">deserve a little bit more explanation</text>
  <text start="179.19" dur="6.25">the election theft it&amp;#39;s kind of twofold</text>
  <text start="182.86" dur="4.95">what that means there there is the fact</text>
  <text start="185.44" dur="5.97">that Trump is found out now in his</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="8.01">position that the Democrats are open to</text>
  <text start="191.41" dur="6.36">doing basically by doing anything by any</text>
  <text start="195.82" dur="4.01">means necessary to win these elections</text>
  <text start="197.77" dur="5.67">which includes doing some pretty</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="5.92">nefarious things and he sees it and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="4.019">trying to get it out there such as</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="3.989">what&amp;#39;s happened in Pennsylvania with</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="4.081">this very close election they were</text>
  <text start="209.739" dur="4.47">pointing to machines maybe having some</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="4.05">problems that&amp;#39;s all alleged but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="3.411">definitely something that works</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="4.68">it would war an investigation further</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="5.2">with Lam taking office and then with Roy</text>
  <text start="220.27" dur="6.12">Moore down in Alabama losing Jeff</text>
  <text start="222.82" dur="5.25">Sessions seat and so on and so forth you</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="5.7">can go through a lot a long list of</text>
  <text start="228.07" dur="7.35">examples how I mean in the Roy Moore one</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="4.92">and I&amp;#39;m just this is speculative but it</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="4.23">seems like there were people who were</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="5.16">bused in from out of town or out of the</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="4.89">district or whatever and and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="5.22">of state basically as a Senate position</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="4.86">I believe so I mean and they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="247.39" dur="3.78">in here and they were you saw people</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="3.66">bragging I said there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a clip</text>
  <text start="251.17" dur="4.8">you guys can probably find it if you</text>
  <text start="253.06" dur="5.88">search it where guys bragging about how</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="6.04">he was in he&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m not even from</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="6.37">here voted for whoever you know the</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="6.78">the opponent dug something or the other</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="4.71">not that it matters but that&amp;#39;s what he</text>
  <text start="268.79" dur="3.15">was talking about the election theft I</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="4.41">think and then and then with his</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="5.67">upcoming prospects of re-election in</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="4.59">2020 I mean what it is this is the last</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="2.88">hope he&amp;#39;s bringing in a new</text>
  <text start="279.02" dur="4.98">administration so Trump administration</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="6.45">version 2.0 I would say it&amp;#39;s my own</text>
  <text start="284" dur="4.56">add-on but it&amp;#39;s all these new changes</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="3.42">he&amp;#39;s getting all the globalist out all</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="3.78">of his saboteurs all the people who are</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="5.94">trying to undermine his administration</text>
  <text start="292.34" dur="6.39">and now he&amp;#39;s bringing in more people who</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="4.17">will actually fight for the Trump</text>
  <text start="298.73" dur="4.59">administration who he wanted probably</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="5.25">from the beginning which is ultimately a</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="4.71">good thing but he&amp;#39;s saying and then</text>
  <text start="305.72" dur="4.83">somebody also appointed to the last hope</text>
  <text start="308.03" dur="4.32">for the the Democrats to be this stormy</text>
  <text start="310.55" dur="6.05">Daniels nonsense</text>
  <text start="312.35" dur="9">she doesn&amp;#39;t even deserve a moment of my</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="7.81">thinking in this because it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="321.35" dur="4.8">trust somebody who&amp;#39;s a serial well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="5.79">not gonna call it names alright I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="326.15" dur="6.35">gonna say I have not seen any verifiable</text>
  <text start="330.2" dur="5.07">evidence to substantiate her claims and</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="4.99">nor has the public especially since a</text>
  <text start="335.27" dur="5.97">lot of it&amp;#39;s under a nondisclosure</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="5.61">agreement or NDA which is obviously</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="3.33">she&amp;#39;s pushing the limits of violating by</text>
  <text start="343.1" dur="3.12">doing all these things there&amp;#39;s a 60</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="3.54">minutes coming interview coming up with</text>
  <text start="346.22" dur="4.32">her and we will have to see what she</text>
  <text start="348.11" dur="5.64">actually exposes if it&amp;#39;s new or if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="8.01">just more rhetoric and you know the fact</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="6.39">that her lawyers on MSNBC making saying</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="3.9">that she&amp;#39;s been threatened he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.14" dur="3.72">say who&amp;#39;s threatened her they said she</text>
  <text start="362.45" dur="3.51">been threatened with physical harm</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="5.79">he doesn&amp;#39;t say who&amp;#39;s threatened her with</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="5.4">physical harm so I mean I feel bad for</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="3.48">that woman obviously I don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="4.14">physical harm to ever come upon anyone</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="6.71">really unless they are you know found</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="8.58">guilty and it&amp;#39;s warranted but you know</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="6.67">honestly you have this whole situation</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="4.02">coming to a head with her and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="3.81">gonna happen on 60 minutes when the</text>
  <text start="388.1" dur="6.3">interview airs tomorrow night I believe</text>
  <text start="390.32" dur="4.71">so you guys tune into that or don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="395.03" dur="5.1">not really into the whole boycotting all</text>
  <text start="398.09" dur="3.6">this stuff because I do believe in</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="3.84">boycotting certain things but it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="4.35">you have to watch them because if</text>
  <text start="403.97" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re gonna be the line press then we</text>
  <text start="406.04" dur="3.99">have to monitor them and point out what</text>
  <text start="408.05" dur="3.48">lies there they&amp;#39;re putting out there or</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="3.3">else the people who are just brainwashed</text>
  <text start="411.53" dur="4.29">and watch all the time we&amp;#39;ll just take</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="4.44">them at face value and believe that and</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="3.42">go on with their merry lives and then</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="4.2">they go into the voting booths and then</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="6.39">we know what how that turns out with the</text>
  <text start="421.97" dur="6.9">past administrations so it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="5.25">for us to focus to understand the the</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="4.11">dynamics here and to understand that</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="3.84">transferring in this new administration</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="4.29">and even if stormy is or is not this</text>
  <text start="434.72" dur="4.08">last hope the impeach movement is</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="3.84">actually going to be based off of a lot</text>
  <text start="438.8" dur="4.11">of different things I think one of them</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="3.54">may be this Mueller thing whether</text>
  <text start="442.91" dur="3.06">Mueller is a good actor or a bad actor</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="3.51">is still yet to be determined there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="445.97" dur="4.71">still not enough evidence there so</text>
  <text start="448.16" dur="6.33">ultimately all we have to go on is what</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="5.76">can we extrapolate from the information</text>
  <text start="454.49" dur="5.52">that we have now and what that is is</text>
  <text start="456.44" dur="4.86">really just a simple premise that they</text>
  <text start="460.01" dur="2.97">are going to do anything they can to</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="4.53">defame Trump and to get them out of</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="4.92">office and there&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re even going to</text>
  <text start="465.83" dur="4.38">talk about this article here out of the</text>
  <text start="467.9" dur="6.83">true pundit from from the 23rd of</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="8.13">January and just today dr. Jerome Corsi</text>
  <text start="474.73" dur="5.92">retweeted that thank you doctor</text>
  <text start="478.34" dur="4.05">but you know as I say you always take</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="3.75">everyone&amp;#39;s opinion with a grain of salt</text>
  <text start="482.39" dur="4.44">because even even a person like from</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="8.34">Corsi may not be right all the time and</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="8.34">he also is definitely picking and</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="4.32">choosing his battles as he goes and and</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="3.63">helping to share information so I mean</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s what we all need to do so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="4.32">think we need to get on top of each</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="4.65">other in this whole decoding or</text>
  <text start="503.12" dur="3.69">deciphering of cue and on we need</text>
  <text start="504.83" dur="3.45">actually help one another which is the</text>
  <text start="506.81" dur="2.97">most important thing and to share the</text>
  <text start="508.28" dur="3.21">information together and share and</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="4.32">highlight other people who are sharing</text>
  <text start="511.49" dur="5.16">that information even if they&amp;#39;re wrong</text>
  <text start="514.1" dur="4.2">right you know the more people hear it</text>
  <text start="516.65" dur="5.97">the more that will flood it&amp;#39;s the flesh</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="6.54">itself out so yeah that that&amp;#39;s where I</text>
  <text start="522.62" dur="3.99">think that I mean the peach movement you</text>
  <text start="524.84" dur="4.02">know you got Maxine Waters talking about</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="4.39">what she wants to do</text>

  <text start="567.78" dur="3.18">think that that&amp;#39;s been happening I think</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.05">and I want to make a correction to my</text>
  <text start="570.96" dur="5.07">last video where I may have stumbled and</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="5.82">said that McMaster is fired McMasters</text>
  <text start="576.03" dur="6.18">not fired yet and clarifying that he is</text>

  <text start="1730.06" dur="3.96">hopefully Trump has cleaned it out and</text>
  <text start="1732.28" dur="3.45">brought new people in but I think this</text>
  <text start="1734.02" dur="3.81">all goes back to what we know about</text>
  <text start="1735.73" dur="5.1">Trump okay so there&amp;#39;s about 600 key</text>
  <text start="1737.83" dur="4.92">positions that he has to nominate he has</text>
  <text start="1740.83" dur="4.65">1,200 nominations he has to make about</text>
  <text start="1742.75" dur="5.58">600 of those are important nominations</text>
  <text start="1745.48" dur="5.46">he&amp;#39;s got about 350 7 nominations through</text>
  <text start="1748.33" dur="8.7">but as of March 13th according this</text>
  <text start="1750.94" dur="8.25">article here on the epic Times it says</text>
  <text start="1757.03" dur="5.97">143 of the president&amp;#39;s nominees were</text>
  <text start="1759.19" dur="6.99">still awaiting confirmation so I mean</text>
  <text start="1763" dur="6.03">could there be 143 I mean and does that</text>
  <text start="1766.18" dur="4.73">number correlate here to the actual</text>
  <text start="1769.03" dur="9.09">number of people that is being suggested</text>
  <text start="1770.91" dur="16.33">our criminals 29 1841 so that comes out</text>
  <text start="1778.12" dur="13.49">to 80 plus 1898 plus 16 is not 143 but</text>
  <text start="1787.24" dur="6.69">it&amp;#39;s close and what that tells you is</text>
  <text start="1791.61" dur="3.73">okay so if there&amp;#39;s a hundred forty three</text>
  <text start="1793.93" dur="2.88">people that he&amp;#39;s nominated and that</text>
  <text start="1795.34" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re dragging their feet on getting</text>
  <text start="1796.81" dur="4.68">through don&amp;#39;t worry a year into his</text>
  <text start="1798.16" dur="9.36">nomination at this point I think Obama</text>
  <text start="1801.49" dur="9.32">had 250 more some some in that range and</text>
  <text start="1807.52" dur="6.45">so did Clinton and so on and so forth</text>
  <text start="1810.81" dur="5.77">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s obviously it&amp;#39;s been referred</text>
  <text start="1813.97" dur="4.74">to as being an obstructionist policy so</text>
  <text start="1816.58" dur="4.86">that certainly is something that needs</text>
  <text start="1818.71" dur="4.05">to be looked into further and I think I</text>
