  <text start="205.68" dur="6.75">big deal given all the information we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="212.43" dur="3.51">more than a few weeks ago q was warning</text>

  <text start="217.53" dur="5.46">going on but this is a big event and it</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="4.14">has everything to do I think with what</text>
  <text start="222.99" dur="4.71">George papadopolis has told us about</text>

  <text start="258.66" dur="3.27">talk about that and a bunch of other</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="3.54">stuff but like I always say before we do</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="3.45">that come back here watch these videos</text>

  <text start="267" dur="2.94">this every time because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.229" dur="4.501">obviously an algorithmic</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="5.16">suppression it&amp;#39;s been documented by</text>
  <text start="272.73" dur="4.86">project Veritas Google whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="4.59">and I&amp;#39;ve been documenting it for a long</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="4.53">time now because it&amp;#39;s very obvious when</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="4.7">your content is suppressed by algorithms</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="5.55">and machine learning and it&amp;#39;s put into</text>
  <text start="284.39" dur="5.44">categories that make it less viewable or</text>
  <text start="287.67" dur="6">less easily accessed let&amp;#39;s put it that</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="5.34">way and this is one of their tactics to</text>
  <text start="293.67" dur="3.42">suppress the information so how do we</text>
  <text start="295.17" dur="4.29">beat it it&amp;#39;s simple you hit the share</text>

  <text start="309.12" dur="4.86">so let&amp;#39;s get into the first big story</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="4.8">Planned Parenthood is foregoing their</text>
  <text start="313.98" dur="4.56">funding from federal programs to the</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="4.08">tune of around sixty million dollars</text>
  <text start="318.54" dur="3.96">this is a story that just came out they</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="4.14">will before going there 60 million</text>
  <text start="322.5" dur="4.29">dollar annually scheduled federal</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="6.06">funding for their federal family</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="8.07">planning program so because there&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="5.94">anti-abortion rules now let&amp;#39;s put this</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="4.5">into perspective with what Q has told us</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="4.53">the Democrat Party con from November</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="3.93">2018 when you can&amp;#39;t raise money</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="3.959">organically through party individual</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="3.78">donations voter base you steal it from</text>
  <text start="345.419" dur="3.691">the American taxpayer and give it back</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="4.71">to yourself in the form of campaign</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.29">contributions example one Planned</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="2.639">Parenthood and then it gives us link to</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="3.03">the Government Accountability Office</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="3.781">where you can actually look up the</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="3.989">numbers and the numbers match up</text>
  <text start="358.2" dur="7.08">perfectly to the sixty million dollars</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="6.711">that was being pushed by Liberal</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="4.68">Democrats who were in support of</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="4.18">abortion we&amp;#39;re pushing for funding to</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="4.53">Planned Parenthood that was then</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="5.58">funneled back to themselves it says 1.5</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="4.38">billion dollars provided in taxpayer</text>
  <text start="376.89" dur="4.05">funding over three year period case one</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="4.77">Planned Parenthood spent thirty million</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="5.07">dollars disclose real estate close or</text>
  <text start="383.64" dur="4.529">real estimates close to sixty five</text>
  <text start="386.01" dur="3.6">million in taxpayer subsidies to</text>
  <text start="388.169" dur="4.111">influence the outcome of the 2018</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="4.32">midterm elections conclusion should it</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="2.97">be legal for a taxpayer Democrat</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="3.72">Republican independent funded</text>
  <text start="395.25" dur="4.59">organization to donate massive massive</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="3.63">amounts of money to the Democrat Party</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="3.449">in an effort to sway an election</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="5.849">Democrat insider term</text>
  <text start="403.289" dur="5.37">terminate Washington I think this is</text>
  <text start="407.129" dur="4.56">reread drops regarding Soros and</text>
  <text start="408.659" dur="5.671">taxpayer funding you your hard-earned</text>
  <text start="411.689" dur="5.521">tax dollars at work vote vote vote queue</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="5.94">so remember queue warn us right before</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="4.829">the election about how this exact amount</text>
  <text start="420.27" dur="4.709">of money was being funneled back into</text>
  <text start="422.039" dur="6.99">Planned Parenthood like I said you go in</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="6.93">Congress you Planned Parenthood gives</text>
  <text start="429.029" dur="5.431">what real estimates over sixty million</text>
  <text start="431.909" dur="6.72">dollars in campaign donations to</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="6.449">Congress to lobby for money to the tune</text>
  <text start="438.629" dur="4.71">of 1.5 billion that is provided in</text>
  <text start="440.909" dur="4.05">taxpayer funding and then they just take</text>
  <text start="443.339" dur="4.021">that sixty million dollars and keep</text>
  <text start="444.959" dur="4.35">reinvesting it in the campaign funds of</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="4.44">the politicians who are funneling the</text>
  <text start="449.309" dur="5.241">money into their organization do you see</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="6.419">that the the conflict of interest there</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="7.69">so this is really an important case to</text>
  <text start="458.219" dur="6.48">remember when you look at this for me I</text>
  <text start="462.24" dur="4.829">wanted to point it out because I thought</text>
  <text start="464.699" dur="4.02">it was important to remember what Q has</text>
  <text start="467.069" dur="4.171">told us in the past about all of this</text>
  <text start="468.719" dur="4.021">and how it all relates back to things</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="4.799">we&amp;#39;re seeing today I mean this was over</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="5.549">what you know back in November of 18 so</text>
  <text start="476.039" dur="5.641">this was a while ago almost a year ago</text>
  <text start="478.289" dur="7.71">and right before the midterm elections</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="6.959">so look we see it for what it is and I</text>
  <text start="485.999" dur="4.35">just thought I&amp;#39;d start there this is an</text>
  <text start="488.639" dur="3.78">interesting story coming out federal</text>

  <text start="496.649" dur="6.031">cabal well the the headline I thought</text>
  <text start="499.709" dur="5.1">was a little bit dramatic but it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="577.44" dur="6.12">about the FBI&amp;#39;s operations but that they</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="8.43">might do so makes them a matter of</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="7.89">potential public interest so what you</text>
  <text start="588.12" dur="5.94">have to remember in this is these</text>
  <text start="591.45" dur="4.2">documents all have to go back to the FBI</text>
  <text start="594.06" dur="3.63">and then I&amp;#39;m sure they go back into the</text>
  <text start="595.65" dur="4.59">clandestine intelligence services most</text>
  <text start="597.69" dur="6.03">likely to the clowns in action now why</text>
  <text start="600.24" dur="7.23">do I say that because these intelligence</text>
  <text start="603.72" dur="5.22">sources were working with each other</text>
  <text start="607.47" dur="3.63">there our intelligence agencies were</text>
  <text start="608.94" dur="4.59">working with one another and the FBI</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="4.98">they had infiltrated everything they had</text>
  <text start="613.53" dur="5.46">their hands and everything Comey was</text>
  <text start="616.08" dur="5.94">controlled Comey was working Lynch was</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="5.04">controlled every pretty much everyone</text>
  <text start="622.02" dur="4.92">was controlled who had a position of</text>
  <text start="624.03" dur="5.43">authority in either the FBI or the DOJ</text>
  <text start="626.94" dur="4.71">and they were being controlled allegedly</text>
  <text start="629.46" dur="3.57">apparently by the clowns in action they</text>
  <text start="631.65" dur="4.92">were pulling a lot of strings behind the</text>
  <text start="633.03" dur="5.46">scenes and Obama&amp;#39;s working mind you this</text>
  <text start="636.57" dur="3.81">has been extensively covered by the</text>
  <text start="638.49" dur="4.8">American report the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="640.38" dur="5.07">is working with John Brennan to use the</text>
  <text start="643.29" dur="4.11">secret super-secret surveillance system</text>
  <text start="645.45" dur="4.29">the hammer to illegally spy on the</text>
  <text start="647.4" dur="5.13">American people this was proof that was</text>
  <text start="649.74" dur="5.63">brought forward allegedly by Dennis</text>

  <text start="662.13" dur="3.48">evidence proving that Obama was</text>

  <text start="670.74" dur="4.92">specifically his political adversaries</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="5.7">and anybody who stood in his way so you</text>
  <text start="675.66" dur="5.67">gotta understand here this is what Ray&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.24" dur="5.82">protecting this is why Comey started the</text>
  <text start="681.33" dur="6.75">whole Russia hoax because the same day</text>
  <text start="684.06" dur="6.51">that general McInerney went on to Dave</text>
  <text start="688.08" dur="5.16">chanda&amp;#39;s program operation freedom his</text>
  <text start="690.57" dur="5.01">radio network program and basically</text>
  <text start="693.24" dur="4.2">confirmed the fact that Obama was</text>
  <text start="695.58" dur="3.33">abusing these super surveillance systems</text>
  <text start="697.44" dur="4.14">and then Comey</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="5.76">was triggered that was his he was</text>
  <text start="701.58" dur="4.59">activated Comey goes and pushes for this</text>
  <text start="704.67" dur="4.56">special counsel by leaking these</text>
  <text start="706.17" dur="5.58">documents and getting a Rosenstein to</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="4.95">sign off on it so the whole thing was</text>
  <text start="711.75" dur="3.6">orchestrated as a hit job against</text>
  <text start="714.18" dur="3.87">President Trump because he was</text>
  <text start="715.35" dur="4.32">threatening to expose everything there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="718.05" dur="4.099">a reason why President Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="719.67" dur="4.65">my wires were tapped at Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="722.149" dur="4.151">Trump wasn&amp;#39;t a president Trump wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="724.32" dur="5.49">just saying that to say it he was</text>
  <text start="726.3" dur="6.229">explaining in detail how his without</text>
  <text start="729.81" dur="6.14">getting into detail I should say how his</text>
  <text start="732.529" dur="5.291">can&amp;#39;t his candidacy and then into his</text>
  <text start="735.95" dur="7.509">nomination and then election as</text>
  <text start="737.82" dur="7.86">president was being surveilled spied on</text>
  <text start="743.459" dur="4.351">illegally the whole time so they</text>
  <text start="745.68" dur="4.32">panicked they knew that if that came out</text>
  <text start="747.81" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re all going to jail so what do</text>
  <text start="750" dur="3.42">they do they start triggering these</text>
  <text start="751.68" dur="3.029">investigations the Russia hoax they push</text>
  <text start="753.42" dur="2.58">they activate all their fake news</text>
  <text start="754.709" dur="3.241">journalists to go out and write all</text>
  <text start="756" dur="3.779">these fake news stories and to continue</text>
  <text start="757.95" dur="2.61">to push this scenario and you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.779" dur="2.521">funny</text>
  <text start="760.56" dur="3.3">President Trump tweeted us out today the</text>
  <text start="762.3" dur="3.599">Democrats have three hours now</text>
  <text start="763.86" dur="4.76">right the the Democrat and leftist</text>
  <text start="765.899" dur="5.521">activists that call themselves news</text>
  <text start="768.62" dur="4.99">journalists they have three three hours</text>
  <text start="771.42" dur="4.229">first they said that President Trump was</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="4.229">a Russian that didn&amp;#39;t work so then they</text>
  <text start="775.649" dur="4.461">called him a racist that didn&amp;#39;t work now</text>
  <text start="777.839" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;re like calling for a recession</text>
  <text start="780.11" dur="3.58">okay great</text>
  <text start="781.92" dur="3.69">so like I&amp;#39;ve said a million times here</text>
  <text start="783.69" dur="5.519">before these people would rather destroy</text>
  <text start="785.61" dur="5.719">this country than to come become or be</text>
  <text start="789.209" dur="6.991">held accountable for their actions</text>
  <text start="791.329" dur="6.521">misdeeds and crimes so this is really an</text>
  <text start="796.2" dur="4.23">important thing to remember I think as</text>
  <text start="797.85" dur="4.65">we go forward but now let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="800.43" dur="4.11">some more epstein news</text>
  <text start="802.5" dur="4.92">look Epstein here</text>
  <text start="804.54" dur="6.27">in a trust apparently two days before</text>
  <text start="807.42" dur="6.6">his suicide oh yeah how convenient</text>
  <text start="810.81" dur="7.05">where he put all 570 million dollars of</text>
  <text start="814.02" dur="5.76">his money into a protected trust which</text>
  <text start="817.86" dur="3.99">could not now apparently it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="819.78" dur="3.57">very hard for the victims of Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="821.85" dur="6.81">Epstein to come forward and try to sue</text>
  <text start="823.35" dur="6.93">for that as far as civilly but look you</text>
  <text start="828.66" dur="4.35">think these people they protect their</text>
  <text start="830.28" dur="4.32">money okay and now that do you think</text>
  <text start="833.01" dur="4.05">that the minute he signed that contract</text>
  <text start="834.6" dur="4.74">or that that will that put all his money</text>
  <text start="837.06" dur="4.14">into a trust that he didn&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="839.34" dur="3.99">immediately that he signed his own death</text>
  <text start="841.2" dur="3.69">warrant probably now I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="843.33" dur="3.63">people out there speculating is he dead</text>
  <text start="844.89" dur="4.53">is he live was it real was it fake I</text>
  <text start="846.96" dur="4.71">can&amp;#39;t tell you that all I can tell you</text>
  <text start="849.42" dur="3.93">is that he is no longer publicly</text>
  <text start="851.67" dur="4.85">available for comment let&amp;#39;s put it that</text>
  <text start="853.35" dur="5.64">way and who knows what kind of</text>
  <text start="856.52" dur="5.85">operations may have been taking place to</text>
  <text start="858.99" dur="5.31">extradite him to a certain place where</text>
  <text start="862.37" dur="4.06">well I&amp;#39;m not gonna say anything else</text>
  <text start="864.3" dur="3.96">than that but I&amp;#39;ll say this look there</text>
  <text start="866.43" dur="3.36">is a hundred different possibilities I</text>
  <text start="868.26" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t know what happened I&amp;#39;m merely</text>
  <text start="869.79" dur="3.3">giving you speculation at this point I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="871.44" dur="4.08">you know it&amp;#39;s for you guys to kind of</text>
  <text start="873.09" dur="5.88">decide and make you don&amp;#39;t mind up here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="875.52" dur="6.15">another one so you guys have seen this</text>
  <text start="878.97" dur="4.68">video where there&amp;#39;s this lady these</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="3.96">young girls coming out of Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="883.65" dur="4.2">Epstein&amp;#39;s New York apartment and you see</text>
  <text start="885.63" dur="5.34">Prince Andrew&amp;#39;s little squirrelly face</text>
  <text start="887.85" dur="6.48">pop out and like do the most weird pedo</text>
  <text start="890.97" dur="6.3">wave I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in my life and this</text>
  <text start="894.33" dur="6.36">girl has been identified I guess she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="897.27" dur="5.07">not really a girl she was then 29 her</text>
  <text start="900.69" dur="2.9">name&amp;#39;s Katherine Keating they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="902.34" dur="4.11">that she&amp;#39;s the daughter of a</text>
  <text start="903.59" dur="4.78">philanthropist who or she&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="906.45" dur="3.93">philanthropist daughter of a former</text>
  <text start="908.37" dur="5.37">Australian Prime Minister yeah go figure</text>
  <text start="910.38" dur="5.67">right nothing really more to that</text>
  <text start="913.74" dur="3.47">besides just pointing that out that was</text>
  <text start="916.05" dur="4.71">weird</text>
  <text start="917.21" dur="5.56">Jeffrey Epstein apparently was sent by</text>
  <text start="920.76" dur="3.81">his buddy John Luke these three</text>
  <text start="922.77" dur="4.11">twelve-year-old French girls as a</text>
  <text start="924.57" dur="4.53">birthday gift it&amp;#39;s a sick what this man</text>
  <text start="926.88" dur="3.51">was doing but I think what we have to</text>
  <text start="929.1" dur="3.81">remember here is that the media is</text>
  <text start="930.39" dur="4.5">continuing to to go all-in against you</text>
  <text start="932.91" dur="5.04">know just Epstein himself but they need</text>
  <text start="934.89" dur="3.43">to continue to widen the investigation</text>
  <text start="937.95" dur="2.59">to say</text>
  <text start="938.32" dur="4.2">who if Jeffrey Epstein was doing stuff</text>
  <text start="940.54" dur="4.02">like this what were what was Bill</text>
  <text start="942.52" dur="5.64">Clinton doing with them right it was a</text>
  <text start="944.56" dur="6.24">Kevin Spacey doing with him or you know</text>
  <text start="948.16" dur="3.96">Bill Maher or any of these people who</text>
  <text start="950.8" dur="3.83">were hanging out with him behind the</text>
  <text start="952.12" dur="5.15">scenes right what were they doing and</text>
  <text start="954.63" dur="5.08">that&amp;#39;s what you have to ask yourself</text>
  <text start="957.27" dur="6.13">again this guy&amp;#39;s just into the sickest</text>
  <text start="959.71" dur="5.82">and most disgusting things in in this is</text>
  <text start="963.4" dur="4.5">a form of like enslavement entrapment</text>
  <text start="965.53" dur="4.95">whatever you want to call where he</text>
  <text start="967.9" dur="5.01">forced to coerced a young girl into</text>
  <text start="970.48" dur="5.04">marrying one of his recruiters so that</text>
  <text start="972.91" dur="4.8">they could keep her in the country and</text>
  <text start="975.52" dur="4.62">that he could abuse her legally just a</text>
  <text start="977.71" dur="4.65">beauty while she legally was in the</text>
  <text start="980.14" dur="4.68">country so disgusting</text>
  <text start="982.36" dur="5.91">and again this modeling agency that</text>
  <text start="984.82" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;ve talked about here was a French</text>
  <text start="988.27" dur="5.01">model modeling agency run by Jean Luc</text>
  <text start="990.28" dur="4.86">Bruno and that was accused they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="993.28" dur="3.42">saying that they provide over a thousand</text>
  <text start="995.14" dur="3.57">underage girls but here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="996.7" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re not focusing on you know</text>
  <text start="998.71" dur="5.73">Richardson and Epstein and and and all</text>
  <text start="1001.8" dur="4.98">these people well there are thousands of</text>
  <text start="1004.44" dur="4.41">underage girls so there must be at least</text>
  <text start="1006.78" dur="4.47">hundreds if not thousands of people that</text>
  <text start="1008.85" dur="4.95">were clients of Jeffrey Epstein who were</text>
  <text start="1011.25" dur="4.95">rich and powerful so let&amp;#39;s start digging</text>
  <text start="1013.8" dur="4.62">on that possibly because we all know</text>
  <text start="1016.2" dur="4.77">things like the tunnels at the Playboy</text>
  <text start="1018.42" dur="4.53">Mansion were apparently real there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1020.97" dur="4.2">articles from all the way back in 2015</text>
  <text start="1022.95" dur="3.87">where they went and they dug through the</text>
  <text start="1025.17" dur="4.05">basement at Playboy Mansion and found</text>
  <text start="1026.82" dur="5.46">these incredible schematics that show</text>
  <text start="1029.22" dur="7.38">that there were tunnels right and that</text>
  <text start="1032.28" dur="6.419">the tunnels connected to we&amp;#39;ll look at</text>
  <text start="1036.6" dur="5.16">it right now look the tunnels connected</text>
  <text start="1038.699" dur="7.49">to Jack Nicholson Warren Beatty Kirk</text>

  <text start="1054.78" dur="5.37">gonna talk about that no we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="1057.15" dur="4.2">go back and dig there because who were</text>
  <text start="1060.15" dur="3.72">the celebrities that were at the Playboy</text>
  <text start="1061.35" dur="4.11">Mansion this was a form of control it</text>
  <text start="1063.87" dur="3">didn&amp;#39;t start with Jeffrey Epstein it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1065.46" dur="3.27">not like Jeffrey Epstein invented the</text>

  <text start="1071.97" dur="4.589">people this way for a long time and I</text>
  <text start="1074.76" dur="4.34">think the that we start looking back</text>
  <text start="1076.559" dur="5.49">words and makes a lot more sense</text>
  <text start="1079.1" dur="4.48">there&amp;#39;s the schematic itself I&amp;#39;ll leave</text>
  <text start="1082.049" dur="3.571">a link to if you want to see you can see</text>
  <text start="1083.58" dur="4.62">how they would connect the houses there</text>

  <text start="1400.749" dur="3.87">it this way it&amp;#39;s a parliamentary system</text>

  <text start="1420.249" dur="4.89">systems and it&amp;#39;s like it honestly I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1423.309" dur="3.151">very thankful for a two-party system</text>
  <text start="1425.139" dur="3.39">when I look at countries like Italy and</text>

  <text start="1432.759" dur="4.89">said apparently what they did was they</text>
  <text start="1435.73" dur="4.259">were in a coalition with this Prime</text>
  <text start="1437.649" dur="4.291">Minister Giuseppe Conte and then they</text>
  <text start="1439.989" dur="4.56">basically called for a vote of</text>
  <text start="1441.94" dur="4.859">no-confidence and have called for a snap</text>
  <text start="1444.549" dur="4.021">election and what that means is that</text>

  <text start="1448.57" dur="4.89">lead leader of the party or the</text>

  <text start="1456.46" dur="3.689">have to form a new coalition and have to</text>

  <text start="1460.149" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s just complicated but take my word</text>
  <text start="1462.549" dur="7.74">for it what we can see now from salvini</text>
  <text start="1466.629" dur="5.341">is a very trumpet or a trumpian populist</text>
  <text start="1470.289" dur="2.491">type of movement in Italy where they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1737.02" dur="3.84">scripture out of the book</text>
  <text start="1738.16" dur="3.9">of Malachi and it talks about the</text>
  <text start="1740.86" dur="3.15">righteous and the wicked and I think</text>
  <text start="1742.06" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s very appropriate given what we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1758.74" dur="4.92">words against me are harsh says the Lord</text>
  <text start="1760.99" dur="5.97">yet you ask what have we spoken against</text>
  <text start="1763.66" dur="5.79">you you have said it is useless to serve</text>
  <text start="1766.96" dur="4.26">God what have we gained by keeping his</text>
  <text start="1769.45" dur="4.59">requirements and walking mournfully</text>
  <text start="1771.22" dur="4.53">before the Lord of Hosts so now we</text>
  <text start="1774.04" dur="4.05">consider the arrogant to be the</text>
  <text start="1775.75" dur="4.86">fortunate not only do those who commit</text>
  <text start="1778.09" dur="6.06">wickedness prosper they even test God</text>
  <text start="1780.61" dur="5.52">and escape at that time those who feared</text>
  <text start="1784.15" dur="4.11">the Lord spoke to one another the Lord</text>
  <text start="1786.13" dur="3.96">took notice and listened so a book of</text>
  <text start="1788.26" dur="3.93">remembrance was written before him for</text>
  <text start="1790.09" dur="4.8">those who feared Yahweh and had high</text>
  <text start="1792.19" dur="6.18">regard for his name they will be son</text>
  <text start="1794.89" dur="5.61">they will be mine says the Lord of hosts</text>
  <text start="1798.37" dur="6.81">a special possession on the day I am</text>
  <text start="1800.5" dur="6.78">preparing I will have compassion on them</text>
  <text start="1805.18" dur="4.74">as a man has compassion on his son who</text>
  <text start="1807.28" dur="4.08">serves him so you will again see the</text>
  <text start="1809.92" dur="4.08">difference between the righteous and the</text>
  <text start="1811.36" dur="6.18">wicked between one who serves God and</text>
  <text start="1814" dur="6.06">one who does not serve him for indeed</text>
  <text start="1817.54" dur="4.41">the day is coming burning like a furnace</text>
  <text start="1820.06" dur="3.78">when all the arrogant and everyone who</text>
  <text start="1821.95" dur="4.92">commits wickedness will become stubble</text>
  <text start="1823.84" dur="5.4">this coming day will consume them says</text>
  <text start="1826.87" dur="5.1">the Lord of Hosts not leaving them root</text>
  <text start="1829.24" dur="5.07">or branches but for you who fear my name</text>
  <text start="1831.97" dur="4.08">the Sun of righteousness will rise with</text>
  <text start="1834.31" dur="3.6">healing in its wings and you will go out</text>
  <text start="1836.05" dur="4.35">and playfully jump like calves from</text>
  <text start="1837.91" dur="5.07">install you will trample the wicked for</text>
  <text start="1840.4" dur="4.59">they will be ashes under the soles of</text>
  <text start="1842.98" dur="7.08">your feet on the day I&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="1844.99" dur="6.84">says the Lord of hosts and I hope that</text>
  <text start="1850.06" dur="4.89">story kind of speaks for itself but I</text>
  <text start="1851.83" dur="6.42">think it calls us to remember that evil</text>
  <text start="1854.95" dur="6.9">may prosper they may you know as it says</text>
  <text start="1858.25" dur="6.15">here they will not only do those who</text>
  <text start="1861.85" dur="4.59">commit wickedness prosper they even seem</text>
  <text start="1864.4" dur="4.58">to test God and escape</text>
  <text start="1866.44" dur="4.89">but don&amp;#39;t forget they&amp;#39;re not escaping</text>
  <text start="1868.98" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re not escaping anything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1871.33" dur="6.6">escaping something that doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="1873.51" dur="7.66">their eternal salvation will not be if</text>
  <text start="1877.93" dur="4.71">they do these things the wicked will be</text>
  <text start="1881.17" dur="3.99">trampled they will be turned into ash</text>
  <text start="1882.64" dur="5.28">God has made that very clear to us so we</text>
  <text start="1885.16" dur="5.94">have to live a righteous life we have to</text>
  <text start="1887.92" dur="5.79">put God above all else fearing the Lord</text>
  <text start="1891.1" dur="4.74">means we have reverence for God we</text>
  <text start="1893.71" dur="4.74">submit to God we humble ourselves before</text>
  <text start="1895.84" dur="4.35">God and we remember that Jesus did die</text>
  <text start="1898.45" dur="3.42">on the cross for our sins and that the</text>
  <text start="1900.19" dur="3.57">Holy Spirit is living inside of our</text>
  <text start="1901.87" dur="3.69">hearts and helping us every day if we</text>
