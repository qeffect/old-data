  <text start="299.4" dur="5.52">dirty or whatever they are but let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="4.19">here it says McLean Virginia so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.92" dur="3.68">an article here talking about a</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="6.85">Georgetown condo that Brzezinski bought</text>
  <text start="308.6" dur="7.18">and you can see here that it says she is</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="5.25">from McLean Virginia and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="3.99">definitely something to be looked at and</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="3.84">I you know doing a little further</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="4.73">research into it I found the Sevigny who</text>
  <text start="321.93" dur="6.09">had a article posted about him back in</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="4.99">2006 and it was titled forever the</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="4.65">negotiator Brzezinski and a stalemate</text>
  <text start="329.49" dur="4.74">over a sidewalk and obviously this this</text>
  <text start="332.67" dur="7.74">just gets into the fact that there is an</text>
  <text start="334.23" dur="9.93">easement in Virginia this McLean area</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="6.87">city near and a state of this brezinski</text>

  <text start="347.28" dur="4.89">make sure that there was no sidewalk</text>
  <text start="348.57" dur="7.05">built along this road so it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="352.17" dur="6.09">to be looked at more closely and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="355.62" dur="5.49">get to that soon but let&amp;#39;s just keep</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="4.38">going for now because we have a lot more</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="4.35">cover if you guys want to leave comments</text>
  <text start="362.64" dur="3.99">and kind of tie some of this together</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="3.3">I mean it&amp;#39;s some of its kind of</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5.73">self-explanatory the media cleanse and</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="6.81">the end is near but and these people are</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="4.71">really stupid you know but if you want</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="3.15">to read more into it please by all means</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="3.65">let&amp;#39;s keep the dialogue going because</text>
  <text start="378.72" dur="5.58">that&amp;#39;s what makes it our area insights</text>
  <text start="380.72" dur="7.12">pretty much what we need to have so now</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="6.6">first is a picture of you can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="5.31">make it out hear it but it&amp;#39;s the Kim</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="4.53">jong-il Bill Clinton and this guy right</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="3.72">here is John Podesta and I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="4.35">about the rest of these people up here</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="3.76">alright but then it says find the link</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="2.95">look around</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="3.21">what does it signify well the link I</text>
  <text start="402.73" dur="3.51">think is that they&amp;#39;re both sitting on</text>
  <text start="403.84" dur="4.74">flowers and that&amp;#39;s what Q comes into</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="5.04">here next he says finally look around</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s reposting that and then it</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="6.75">says what are they sitting on perfectly</text>
  <text start="414.25" dur="6.18">lined up why learn q okay</text>
  <text start="418.03" dur="4.5">so that&amp;#39;s definitely something we need</text>
  <text start="420.43" dur="3.9">to look at further and then this Anton</text>
  <text start="422.53" dur="4.14">who posted this it actually said I</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="4.41">wonder why Barack Hussein Obama is</text>
  <text start="426.67" dur="3.47">depicted sitting in a bush and I still</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="4.59">haven&amp;#39;t gotten what he meant by that</text>
  <text start="430.14" dur="7.9">that&amp;#39;d be a chose is depicted sitting in</text>
  <text start="433.33" dur="6.54">a bush but you know I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.04" dur="2.64">hiding somewhere in the picture but we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="439.87" dur="3.39">have to look at that a little bit</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="5.04">further and then that goes into the next</text>
  <text start="443.26" dur="4.62">one here and that kind of points to the</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="3.54">flowers and we&amp;#39;ll get into what the</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="4.68">meaning of the flowers is right now</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="6.09">moving up into the next post we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="452.56" dur="4.68">to look here so an aunt on post to QE</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="4.71">says Chris Wallace looks clean as far as</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="5.4">those descriptors used by cue are</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="4.41">concerned looking into Matthews now and</text>
  <text start="462.64" dur="4.2">then cue actually points to him and says</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="4.2">check out this this Wikipedia article</text>
  <text start="466.84" dur="4.02">and you&amp;#39;re not looking close enough and</text>
  <text start="468.67" dur="5.76">the Wikipedia article talks about Mike</text>
  <text start="470.86" dur="5.28">Wallace and Mike Wallace is he was a</text>
  <text start="474.43" dur="4.68">correspondent he had a bunch of shows on</text>
  <text start="476.14" dur="4.7">CBS he was very popular but in his later</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="4.08">life you know he was known for inner</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="7.63">interviewing like the iranian President</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="6.57">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and you know I think</text>
  <text start="488.47" dur="3.12">that this is like a Mockingbird</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="4.88">connection here I think you know we all</text>
  <text start="491.59" dur="5.31">have seen this guy in on 60 minutes and</text>
  <text start="494.64" dur="4">you know it was something if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="3.69">something there there&amp;#39;s something there</text>
  <text start="498.64" dur="3.63">certainly and I definitely think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.59" dur="3.78">Mockingbird related and I think it kind</text>
  <text start="502.27" dur="4.2">of goes to the fact that accuse pointing</text>
  <text start="504.37" dur="4.59">to the fact that all these people are</text>
  <text start="506.47" dur="5.43">related and like he says I think later</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="5.759">he says born into that but we&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="4.74">going for now they&amp;#39;re definitely</text>
  <text start="514.719" dur="3.781">connected and they&amp;#39;re born into it and</text>
  <text start="516.64" dur="2.43">then they&amp;#39;re put in places of power for</text>
  <text start="518.5" dur="4.44">a reason</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="6.45">now flowers and gardens this is the next</text>
  <text start="522.94" dur="4.35">cue post and it says learn the hidden</text>
  <text start="525.52" dur="3.92">symbolism and ink you see this link to</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="2.15">up</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="5.04">encyclopedia comm which actually goes</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="4.35">into what slave gardens are it says to</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="4.86">supplement basic provisions mean you</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="4.29">guys can go read this for yourself just</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.08">go to encyclopedia comm type in slave</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="5.28">gardens and you&amp;#39;ll have this whole setup</text>
  <text start="543.74" dur="6.24">but the basic gist of it is is that back</text>
  <text start="546.77" dur="6.99">in the day when slaves were around you</text>
  <text start="549.98" dur="5.7">know prop prevalently that they would</text>
  <text start="553.76" dur="4.05">have gardens and those gardens they</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="4.56">would keep and it would actually because</text>
  <text start="557.81" dur="4.11">slaves didn&amp;#39;t have a great diet they</text>
  <text start="560.24" dur="3.57">would actually they would grow the</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="4.59">garden and give like an offering to</text>
  <text start="563.81" dur="5.4">their masters right the their slave</text>
  <text start="566.51" dur="4.56">owning masters whoever and then but then</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="3.75">they would eat you know carrots or</text>
  <text start="571.07" dur="4.95">potatoes or whatever and that would that</text>
  <text start="572.96" dur="4.86">would you know give them the actual</text>
  <text start="576.02" dur="3.03">sustenance they need to actually stay</text>
  <text start="577.82" dur="3.15">alive and stay healthy because they</text>
  <text start="579.05" dur="4.26">weren&amp;#39;t being given you know what the</text>
  <text start="580.97" dur="4.05">Masters were eating obviously and they</text>
  <text start="583.31" dur="4.32">needed certain vegetables and vitamins</text>
  <text start="585.02" dur="4.89">to stay healthy and alive and even that</text>
  <text start="587.63" dur="4.26">the slave owners knew that so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.91" dur="4.31">Alec I think this is totally an allegory</text>
  <text start="591.89" dur="5.97">for what the relationship is between</text>
