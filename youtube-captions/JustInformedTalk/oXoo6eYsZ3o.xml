  <text start="213.02" dur="7.41">board owner board operator whatever that</text>
  <text start="216.459" dur="7.421">they took away the top part of the the</text>
  <text start="220.43" dur="6.99">thread now each thread there&amp;#39;s the short</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="4.65">way to explain this is each thing that</text>
  <text start="227.42" dur="3.09">they call bread</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s a word they use is actually a</text>

  <text start="241.64" dur="5.67">750 posts right and then they create a</text>
  <text start="245.299" dur="3.561">new thread well when they create a new</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="5.66">thread because it&amp;#39;s an ongoing</text>
  <text start="248.86" dur="7.03">never-ending thread of research there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="4.81">there are certain posts that are copy</text>
  <text start="255.89" dur="5.189">and pasted basically into each new</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="5.43">thread and what Q is saying is the board</text>
  <text start="261.079" dur="4.831">owner decided to take that out and</text>
  <text start="263.21" dur="6.329">cusing why you should leave that that is</text>
  <text start="265.91" dur="5.67">how we you know as it says here it&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="4.471">we create the hive mind of cataloging</text>

  <text start="296.6" dur="4.86">says CAPTCHA can easily be pipe pipe can</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="4.5">be easily bypassed by those who would</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="5.31">seek to cause disruption having active</text>
  <text start="303.77" dur="4.8">serves no purpose Q CAPTCHA is this</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="5.61">thing you guys know what a CAPTCHA is if</text>

  <text start="318.289" dur="5.641">you click no well CAPTCHA is that but</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="5.069">for the thread forms on a chain where if</text>
  <text start="323.93" dur="5.01">you want to make a post you have to type</text>
  <text start="325.789" dur="5.581">out this you know blurb of letters and</text>

  <text start="331.37" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;re a human and not a robot because</text>
  <text start="333.5" dur="2.45">they have a lot of bots that can post</text>
  <text start="334.88" dur="4.12">but</text>
  <text start="335.95" dur="5.58">so so the the board owner is asking like</text>

  <text start="346.78" dur="3.51">cube board you&amp;#39;ll see the people who are</text>
  <text start="348.88" dur="3.32">trying to disrupt they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>

  <text start="352.2" dur="5.62">it&amp;#39;s called sliding and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="8.28">tactic of the shields and the trolls to</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="7.95">try to denigrate our effort to find the</text>
  <text start="363.43" dur="4.86">answers to the the things that we were</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="3.27">investigating so that&amp;#39;s the long short</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="2.4">of it</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="2.82">the anti on response the board owner</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="4.2">responds done thank you for the</text>
  <text start="371.86" dur="5.01">direction he responds thank you for your</text>
  <text start="374.89" dur="4.14">continued service board owner is greatly</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="4.59">appreciated q okay so there you go that</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="3.18">was a simple exchange no need to dig any</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="3.96">deeper on that</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="6.36">now this one is fascinating so as you</text>
  <text start="385.42" dur="5.46">can see here this is a picture I had to</text>
  <text start="388.57" dur="3.48">do a little research but I found a lot</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="3.24">of the anions were pointing out that</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="4.83">this is basically first of all what does</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="4.32">this look like to you I&amp;#39;ll give you a</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="3">second well obviously it looks like</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="6.63">Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="8.28">Peto island temple and there have been a</text>
  <text start="405.07" dur="4.8">lot of there&amp;#39;s been a lot of speculation</text>
  <text start="408.16" dur="2.88">about what&amp;#39;s going on in that temple</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="2.67">we&amp;#39;re going to look at a store that cute</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="3.06">points out to us a little later where</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re trying to actually get ahead of</text>
  <text start="414.1" dur="5.9">the story and cue points it out but this</text>
  <text start="416.92" dur="7.47">is a actually a as far as I can tell a</text>
  <text start="420" dur="6.88">bathhouse in Syria of all places and it</text>
  <text start="424.39" dur="4.89">looks exactly like Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="4.32">temple on his Island the same thing with</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="3.09">the Keystone here as cues pointed out</text>
  <text start="431.2" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re going to talk about in a second</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="5.46">the dome the same lines and cue is</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="6.15">saying symbolism will be their downfall</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="6.72">well yeah I would say so I mean you have</text>
  <text start="442.27" dur="5.76">to consider the fact that these people</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="6.03">were so arrogant and and stupid</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="6.9">basically that they decided to make a</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="6.3">giant temple on an island in the</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="3.98">Caribbean that can easily be seen from</text>
  <text start="456.88" dur="4.44">any satellite picture any boat coming by</text>
  <text start="458.91" dur="4.41">heck you even have now drones being</text>
  <text start="461.32" dur="4.38">flown over as cue showed us before and</text>
  <text start="463.32" dur="4.36">obviously if you think about that then</text>
  <text start="465.7" dur="3.54">you understand this is telling us</text>
  <text start="467.68" dur="4.169">something much more deeper</text>
  <text start="469.24" dur="4.799">is afoot and also if you look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.849" dur="4.44">happening in Syria I mean it&amp;#39;s a war</text>
  <text start="474.039" dur="4.53">zone and that&amp;#39;s the prime place where</text>
  <text start="476.289" dur="3.961">you&amp;#39;d be trafficking children out of I</text>
  <text start="478.569" dur="3.78">mean these people love war zones because</text>
  <text start="480.25" dur="4.169">that&amp;#39;s where they can go get you know</text>
  <text start="482.349" dur="2.91">disaffected children and smuggle them</text>
  <text start="484.419" dur="3.301">out of a country</text>
  <text start="485.259" dur="4.321">well basically nobody noticing and then</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="3.75">they send in places like Epstein Island</text>
  <text start="489.58" dur="2.91">where unspeakable things allegedly</text>
  <text start="491.47" dur="3.18">happen</text>
  <text start="492.49" dur="5.16">beneath in the tunnels beneath the</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="4.109">surface and the tunnels and we we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="3.239">talked about that before</text>
  <text start="498.759" dur="3.511">ad nauseam here on this channel so if</text>
  <text start="500.889" dur="3.481">you want to just go back and watch some</text>
  <text start="502.27" dur="3.51">of the older videos about it I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="504.37" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;ll find enough information to make</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="5.34">it to have it makes sense speaking of</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="5.7">that though this is the next one cooky</text>

  <text start="758.92" dur="4.859">were connected but there&amp;#39;s still has no</text>
  <text start="761.13" dur="4.84">real allegations against Trump I mean</text>
  <text start="763.779" dur="4.62">this all happened in Epstein sphere and</text>
  <text start="765.97" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s to be noted that President Trump</text>
  <text start="768.399" dur="5.101">did kick Epstein out of his club after</text>
  <text start="770.89" dur="5.97">he found out that he was harassing one</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="5.22">of the members children yeah you put</text>
  <text start="776.86" dur="3.719">that you know do with that as you may</text>
  <text start="778.72" dur="4.71">then it talks about this story about</text>
  <text start="780.579" dur="5.82">Elon Musk being at some dinner years ago</text>
  <text start="783.43" dur="4.649">where he introduced Jeffrey Epstein to</text>

  <text start="790.18" dur="5.279">of wraps up and saying and then it makes</text>
  <text start="792.7" dur="4.5">these accusations about you know people</text>
  <text start="795.459" dur="3.391">who are gonna end up being connected to</text>
  <text start="797.2" dur="3.54">Jeffrey Epstein and it talks about</text>
  <text start="798.85" dur="6.33">people like Bill Gates and Larry Summers</text>
  <text start="800.74" dur="7.289">and Steve Bannon hmm also of course Alan</text>
  <text start="805.18" dur="4.67">Dershowitz and it also references here</text>
  <text start="808.029" dur="5.341">in the article the connections where</text>
  <text start="809.85" dur="5.83">Jeffrey Alan Dershowitz who&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="813.37" dur="5.45">come out really strong in calling this</text>
  <text start="815.68" dur="5.76">Virginia Roberts girl a liar she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="818.82" dur="5.769">basically saying that he was one of the</text>
  <text start="821.44" dur="5.43">men who I guess you would say</text>
  <text start="824.589" dur="6.211">statutorily raped her when she was 17</text>
  <text start="826.87" dur="6.029">and or at least I believe that so a</text>
  <text start="830.8" dur="6.029">phrase that I&amp;#39;m not sure the legalese on</text>
  <text start="832.899" dur="6.06">it but it is saying here that he just</text>
  <text start="836.829" dur="5.041">reiterates when he&amp;#39;s called about this</text>
  <text start="838.959" dur="4.471">article that Lynn Forrester de</text>
  <text start="841.87" dur="4.469">Rothschild so one of the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="843.43" dur="6.33">heiresses basically begged Alan</text>
  <text start="846.339" dur="6.87">Dershowitz to meet Jeffrey Epstein at</text>
  <text start="849.76" dur="6.329">and then was invited to Les Wexner 59th</text>
  <text start="853.209" dur="6.24">birthday party so I you know this story</text>
  <text start="856.089" dur="6.981">just gets worse and worse and as far as</text>
  <text start="859.449" dur="6">I can tell it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious that</text>
  <text start="863.07" dur="4.42">there&amp;#39;s so much more to the story even</text>
  <text start="865.449" dur="4.131">goes on talk about Wall Street</text>
  <text start="867.49" dur="4.97">speculation is contained</text>
  <text start="869.58" dur="5.22">to build as many people who knew Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="872.46" dur="7.37">Epstein are starting to wonder about who</text>
  <text start="874.8" dur="7.2">else may be involved in this you know</text>
  <text start="879.83" dur="4.24">situation with underage girls on his</text>
  <text start="882" dur="3.69">Island it also talks about how nobody</text>
  <text start="884.07" dur="4.32">really knows how he made his wealth and</text>
  <text start="885.69" dur="4.89">there&amp;#39;s no real definitive source and</text>
  <text start="888.39" dur="3.63">some of the other sources on Wall Street</text>
  <text start="890.58" dur="2.76">other hedge fund managers are saying</text>
  <text start="892.02" dur="3.9">that basically he was just a financial</text>
  <text start="893.34" dur="4.05">advisor for wealthy people and that</text>
  <text start="895.92" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense how he made all the</text>
  <text start="897.39" dur="5.22">money that they say he made and of</text>
  <text start="900.3" dur="4.29">course it keeps going here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="902.61" dur="5.51">the interest here&amp;#39;s an interesting part</text>
  <text start="904.59" dur="7.83">of the story that where it talks about</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="5.89">multiple different theories so this is</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="3.39">what I thought was interesting first off</text>
  <text start="914.01" dur="4.11">they do mention this article the theory</text>
  <text start="915.81" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s circulating among prominent</text>
  <text start="918.12" dur="3.69">Republicans that Epstein was a Mossad</text>
  <text start="920.04" dur="4.05">agent well that&amp;#39;s pretty interesting</text>
  <text start="921.81" dur="4.47">that made it to Vanity Fair</text>
  <text start="924.09" dur="5.22">then of course he of George HR George W</text>
  <text start="926.28" dur="5.49">Bush the theory that says that George W</text>
  <text start="929.31" dur="4.05">Bush basically directed Alexander Acosta</text>
  <text start="931.77" dur="4.11">not to prosecute apps team to protect</text>
  <text start="933.36" dur="5.81">Prince Andrew on behalf of the British</text>
  <text start="935.88" dur="5.73">government so that&amp;#39;s bad right</text>
  <text start="939.17" dur="4.42">it just keeps getting worse and worse no</text>
  <text start="941.61" dur="3.69">matter how this cookie ends up crumbling</text>
  <text start="943.59" dur="3.24">I mean it&amp;#39;s not gonna be good for anyone</text>
  <text start="945.3" dur="5.25">involved and I think that&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="946.83" dur="5.19">story here and of course it goes on in</text>

  <text start="1163.52" dur="3.33">know they may profit off wars and how</text>
  <text start="1165.2" dur="4.17">like things like the Paris climate</text>
  <text start="1166.85" dur="3.93">Accord basically just set up to siphon</text>
  <text start="1169.37" dur="3.63">money out and eventually have a global</text>
  <text start="1170.78" dur="4.95">carbon tax that they could all become</text>
  <text start="1173" dur="4.89">richer from and get more power from and</text>
  <text start="1175.73" dur="4.08">then it talks about what is the keystone</text>
  <text start="1177.89" dur="4.08">and right after that says does Satan</text>
  <text start="1179.81" dur="4.35">exist does the thought of Satan exist</text>
  <text start="1181.97" dur="4.98">who worships Satan what is a cult</text>
  <text start="1184.16" dur="6.39">epstein Island what is a temple what</text>
  <text start="1186.95" dur="5.28">occurs in a temple warship this is</text>
  <text start="1190.55" dur="3.42">something we&amp;#39;ve been told from q from</text>
  <text start="1192.23" dur="4.83">the beginning the top layer of epstein</text>
  <text start="1193.97" dur="4.41">island was allegedly a some sort of sex</text>
  <text start="1197.06" dur="3.9">resort where underage women were</text>
  <text start="1198.38" dur="4.92">involved with some very disgusting</text>
  <text start="1200.96" dur="4.91">illegal things but then below that you</text>
  <text start="1203.3" dur="6.38">had some really demonic satanic evil</text>
  <text start="1205.87" dur="7.27">allegedly with these occult ritualistic</text>
  <text start="1209.68" dur="6.91">abuse of children and even worse in some</text>
  <text start="1213.14" dur="6">cases allegedly so we have to keep</text>
  <text start="1216.59" dur="4.35">digging on this and they better I hope</text>
  <text start="1219.14" dur="4.17">we really do get to the bottom of this</text>
  <text start="1220.94" dur="4.17">because this is just like it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="1223.31" dur="4.02">to that point where just like we have to</text>
  <text start="1225.11" dur="4.53">continue to fight to get the truth out</text>
  <text start="1227.33" dur="4.41">on this then it&amp;#39;s of course saying</text>
  <text start="1229.64" dur="3.81">explore further on that and then the</text>
  <text start="1231.74" dur="3.18">next one here is key responding to his</text>
  <text start="1233.45" dur="4.29">own post saying note the date on the</text>
  <text start="1234.92" dur="5.46">post November 2017 note events happening</text>
  <text start="1237.74" dur="3.51">today reconcile news unlocks cue so</text>
  <text start="1240.38" dur="2.67">think about this way</text>
  <text start="1241.25" dur="4.2">two years ago Q was telling us about</text>
  <text start="1243.05" dur="4.32">Epstein Island and and the worship of</text>
  <text start="1245.45" dur="4.83">Satan and and all that other stuff and</text>
  <text start="1247.37" dur="6.99">now here we are two years later and we</text>
  <text start="1250.28" dur="6.99">have proof coming out about Epstein</text>
  <text start="1254.36" dur="5.22">about his Island the indictments are</text>
  <text start="1257.27" dur="5.01">here he&amp;#39;s been arrested the trial is</text>
  <text start="1259.58" dur="5.31">coming and we&amp;#39;re going to continue to</text>
  <text start="1262.28" dur="5.61">see people exposed I believe as we go</text>
  <text start="1264.89" dur="4.71">further forward so the next one here is</text>
  <text start="1267.89" dur="2.65">this ABC News article which basically</text>
  <text start="1269.6" dur="3.28">says</text>
  <text start="1270.54" dur="4.32">that a former IT contractor for Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="1272.88" dur="4.049">Epstein says he quit over concerns about</text>
  <text start="1274.86" dur="5.85">revealing pictures and topless young</text>
  <text start="1276.929" dur="5.011">women so another disgusting example of</text>
  <text start="1280.71" dur="4.14">the kind of things that Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="1281.94" dur="5.55">was into even his IT guy had to quit</text>
  <text start="1284.85" dur="5.069">because he basically said that there</text>
  <text start="1287.49" dur="4.5">were pictures of naked women everywhere</text>
  <text start="1289.919" dur="4.231">and they were just scatter all over his</text>
  <text start="1291.99" dur="6.45">office and that basically he his</text>
  <text start="1294.15" dur="7.47">full-time job was pursuing women and in</text>
  <text start="1298.44" dur="13.8">some cases allegedly but proven through</text>
  <text start="1301.62" dur="15.27">court also underage women so look this</text>
  <text start="1312.24" dur="5.76">is what the the person who was running</text>
  <text start="1316.89" dur="2.76">his IT says</text>
  <text start="1318" dur="3.36">saying Epstein wanted a phone or</text>
  <text start="1319.65" dur="4.2">internet access nearly everywhere on the</text>
  <text start="1321.36" dur="5.55">72 acre island Scully said including in</text>
  <text start="1323.85" dur="5.819">a secured excluded Co the financier</text>
  <text start="1326.91" dur="5.009">referred to as the grotto given his work</text>
  <text start="1329.669" dur="4.831">high-volume financial trading Scully</text>
  <text start="1331.919" dur="4.741">said Epstein never wanted a call to drop</text>
  <text start="1334.5" dur="6.84">because of weak digital coverage on the</text>
  <text start="1336.66" dur="6.12">island hmm then they go on to talk about</text>
  <text start="1341.34" dur="2.91">the island and this is where it gets</text>
  <text start="1342.78" dur="3.75">interesting cuz this is an ABC News</text>
  <text start="1344.25" dur="4.77">article and Q&amp;#39;s gonna tell us about this</text>
  <text start="1346.53" dur="4.86">here in a second but it talks about the</text>
  <text start="1349.02" dur="3.77">island being a Danish style layout</text>
  <text start="1351.39" dur="6.51">whatever that means</text>
  <text start="1352.79" dur="7.65">like from Denmark I guess but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1357.9" dur="5.01">even know what Danish style looks like</text>
  <text start="1360.44" dur="4.03">with individual bedroom suites in</text>
  <text start="1362.91" dur="6.81">individual buildings around a courtyard</text>
  <text start="1364.47" dur="6.87">and so on and so forth and now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1369.72" dur="4.29">the interesting part that he wants us to</text>
  <text start="1371.34" dur="4.92">look at it says a colorful building that</text>
  <text start="1374.01" dur="4.35">some news reports have called the temple</text>
  <text start="1376.26" dur="5.34">was actually a gym when Epstein worked</text>
  <text start="1378.36" dur="4.98">out when he was or where I&amp;#39;ve seen or</text>
  <text start="1381.6" dur="3.78">yeah it should say where Epstein worked</text>
  <text start="1383.34" dur="4.68">out when he was on the island Scully</text>
  <text start="1385.38" dur="4.53">said nothing our noting in an interview</text>
  <text start="1388.02" dur="3.779">with ABC News that the gym had a</text>
  <text start="1389.91" dur="4.41">memorable feature a massive framed photo</text>
  <text start="1391.799" dur="4.891">of a topless woman says they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1394.32" dur="4.44">have been more than 15 or 16 years old</text>
  <text start="1396.69" dur="5.85">with regard to the pictures of the wound</text>
  <text start="1398.76" dur="4.98">so this is interesting and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1402.54" dur="1.86">part that we&amp;#39;re supposed to look at and</text>
  <text start="1403.74" dur="2.88">take away it says</text>
  <text start="1404.4" dur="4.14">primary purpose of articles so this is</text>
  <text start="1406.62" dur="3.63">cute telling us why the fake news media</text>
  <text start="1408.54" dur="4.01">wrote and published its article because</text>
  <text start="1410.25" dur="6.36">they wanted to get that one little</text>
  <text start="1412.55" dur="7.36">paragraph and one little sentence I</text>
  <text start="1416.61" dur="5.52">should say in on the record so that it</text>
  <text start="1419.91" dur="5.24">would push people off the trail of the</text>
  <text start="1422.13" dur="5.19">epstein island temple which we have</text>
  <text start="1425.15" dur="4.71">investigated here as being some sort of</text>
  <text start="1427.32" dur="5.07">under entrance to an underground complex</text>
  <text start="1429.86" dur="3.94">so this how do you shape a story facts</text>

  <text start="1438.66" dur="8.519">basically continue to deceive you and</text>
  <text start="1443.03" dur="7.54">last few here this is a funny poster</text>
