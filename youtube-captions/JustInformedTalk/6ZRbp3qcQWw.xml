  <text start="98.46" dur="5.88">here and it&amp;#39;s Q basically posting this</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="6.96">screenshot of well a picture of a screen</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="5.7">basically a screenshot and it shows</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="4.559">exactly what the left is doing right now</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="4.32">I mean if you guys have seen television</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="3.991">lately you&amp;#39;ve seen these these wild mobs</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="3.149">of people I mean that&amp;#39;s the best way I</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="3.06">could describe really I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="4.32">else to describe it because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="4.65">taken over the Capitol building they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="121.829" dur="5.011">taken over basically huge swaths of</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="4.59">downtown DC and they&amp;#39;re all protesting</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="4.8">the same thing they&amp;#39;re protesting the</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="4.65">recent confirmation of judge our justice</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="3.27">I should say Brett Kavanaugh</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="3.69">now the vote went a little different</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="5.64">than Qi predicted as you can see here as</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="5.69">opposed to it being 5347 as q had</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="7.049">originally predicted it ended up being</text>
  <text start="142.58" dur="7.989">52 48 and of course the two senators who</text>
  <text start="147.599" dur="6.931">didn&amp;#39;t vote are obviously Lisa Murkowski</text>
  <text start="150.569" dur="6.451">and Steve Daines now Lisa Murkowski we</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="4.83">know was basically if you saw this</text>
  <text start="157.02" dur="3.81">picture that Q showed us a while ago and</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="2.61">actually in the last video I talked</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="3.659">about this but we can look at this</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="5.45">picture really quick it&amp;#39;s quite telling</text>
  <text start="164.489" dur="5.461">right it&amp;#39;s this picture right here and</text>
  <text start="167.42" dur="4.45">when you look at this picture and cute</text>
  <text start="169.95" dur="3">what Q said with it it said a picture&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="3.06">worth a thousand words</text>
  <text start="172.95" dur="4.59">see evil in the face of Feinstein</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="4.17">question and then it&amp;#39;s a seat fear and</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="3.75">emotion in the face of Murkowski</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="4.56">question another question a phone was</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="4.32">present she was probably I mean it seems</text>
  <text start="183.66" dur="3.17">that Q is insinuating is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="4.379">possible that she was basically</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="4.75">intimidated out of voting either way so</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="5.181">she had to abstain from the vote</text>
  <text start="191.58" dur="7.98">altogether and and that&amp;#39;s to please her</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="6.159">Democrat you know bosses it looks like</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="4.08">these are party bosses political bosses</text>
  <text start="201.329" dur="4.801">like the old political machines of you</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="5.189">know Tammany Hall in old New York so</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="4.829">this is really what the big big problem</text>
  <text start="208.829" dur="4.801">is in our government this picture says</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="5.821">it all it says it all the way that that</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="5.13">Diane is basically it being insinuated</text>
  <text start="216.78" dur="3.39">to have intimidated Lisa that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="3.63">definitely an issue that we have to</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="4.98">address but those are the two who didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="4.98">and Steve Daines just wasn&amp;#39;t even there</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="4.26">abs and his incredibly convenient</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="6.33">excuses that his daughter was having a</text>
  <text start="229.41" dur="5.82">wedding now to me kind of 50/50 on that</text>
  <text start="233.7" dur="3.18">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s your daughter&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="3.9">wedding obviously you don&amp;#39;t want to miss</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="4.979">that but at the same time you know</text>
  <text start="239.13" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re a senator and you&amp;#39;re representing</text>
  <text start="241.859" dur="4.38">an entire states you know state worth of</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="3.359">people and this is one of the most</text>
  <text start="246.239" dur="4.56">important votes so we could have used</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="5.011">you Steve you know - you could have</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="3.66">flown and done it all in one day but</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="3.75">nope nope nope</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="5.011">can&amp;#39;t do that so I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m kind</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="4.23">of 50/50 on that we&amp;#39;ll have to look into</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="3.93">that further and then you know of course</text>
  <text start="260.7" dur="5.01">Lisa Murkowski just complete cowardice</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="3.59">so it could have actually been 52 to 48</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="3.5">really</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="4.44">ultimately that is what it was and I</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="4.889">think that you know that that&amp;#39;s where it</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="7.049">ended up landing so um you know going</text>
  <text start="274.099" dur="7.081">back to where we were this is basically</text>
  <text start="278.479" dur="4.351">says it all the picture says it all here</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="3.87">it says welcome to the Democrat Party</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="4.32">the party of threats violence</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="5.429">intimidation name-calling racism fascism</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="5.669">division hashtag walk away hashtag vote</text>
  <text start="290.479" dur="4.801">Republican queue and there you go I mean</text>
  <text start="292.819" dur="5.22">really what it comes down to is it you</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="5.16">know I can tell you from what I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="298.039" dur="4.41">in the news and what&amp;#39;s been reported and</text>
  <text start="300.44" dur="4.229">the way that these protests have gone</text>
  <text start="302.449" dur="4.44">the way that they&amp;#39;re you know harassing</text>
  <text start="304.669" dur="4.321">senator is the way that they&amp;#39;re chasing</text>
  <text start="306.889" dur="6.21">people down like in a mob like sense</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="6.179">it&amp;#39;s very very unsettling and it does</text>
  <text start="313.099" dur="5.461">lend itself for one to think yes</text>
  <text start="315.169" dur="5.31">possibly you could make the commute the</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="3.69">argument that the Democrat Party has</text>
  <text start="320.479" dur="4.5">become the party of threats and violence</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="4.889">and intimidation and name-calling racism</text>
  <text start="324.979" dur="5.881">and fascism and and division in</text>
  <text start="327.139" dur="5.37">particular see because the way they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="2.85">been conducting themselves I mean all</text>
  <text start="332.509" dur="3.15">you have to do is look at this one</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="4.829">picture this one screenshot that Q gives</text>
  <text start="335.659" dur="6.471">us where you see these nasty signs right</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="8.06">that are obviously meant to be used as</text>
  <text start="342.13" dur="4.469">intimidation and and just complete</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="7.06">name-calling and it&amp;#39;s just literally</text>
  <text start="350.509" dur="5.431">what it is you see them do this and I</text>
  <text start="354.199" dur="3.111">think that a lot of it is you know a lot</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="4.89">of these people have been basically</text>
  <text start="357.31" dur="5.56">misled they&amp;#39;ve been they&amp;#39;ve bought</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="4.589">whatever was given to them through this</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="5.19">mainstream media factory of corporate</text>
  <text start="365.419" dur="5.55">news corporate fake news and they take</text>
  <text start="368.06" dur="4.38">that exactly at face value and it yeah</text>
  <text start="370.969" dur="3.061">it scares the heck out of them so they</text>
  <text start="372.44" dur="3.599">go out there and they feel like they</text>
  <text start="374.03" dur="3.419">have to fight for something like and not</text>
  <text start="376.039" dur="3.271">just fight in the sense of like</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="4.62">politically fight like they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="4.44">ready for anything and everything and</text>
  <text start="382.069" dur="3.451">that&amp;#39;s what you see with groups like in</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="4.289">Tifa and other groups where they</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="4.049">actually believe that they&amp;#39;re under some</text>
  <text start="388.039" dur="5.19">sort of attack because they believe what</text>
  <text start="389.569" dur="6.181">the news is told them and you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="393.229" dur="3.901">not saying that 100% of news is fake but</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="4.13">like President Trump says I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="6.53">like it&amp;#39;s got to be like 8515 at the</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="6.57">point 85 fake and then 15 real because</text>
  <text start="403.66" dur="5.01">they just get on there and they make up</text>
  <text start="406.45" dur="4.11">these these wild accusations they run</text>
  <text start="408.67" dur="5.67">with these unverified headlines and</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;ll do it to the point of knowing</text>
  <text start="414.34" dur="5.4">that they need to cause this division in</text>
  <text start="417.34" dur="4.68">our country to basically stir up an</text>
  <text start="419.74" dur="4.95">entire base of individuals and a lot of</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="4.47">this I hate to say is being paid for you</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="3.21">know by people like George Soros and</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="2.49">others and that&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="3.33">just throwing that out there</text>
  <text start="428.98" dur="5.13">I mean this is verified organizations</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="4.77">are being funded through the Soros</text>
  <text start="434.11" dur="4.71">Foundation open society foundation and</text>
  <text start="436" dur="4.47">other things to actually pay for these</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="3.12">people to go out and do it so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="4.95">getting paid to go out there and just be</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="5.88">completely wild and it&amp;#39;s just really</text>
  <text start="445.42" dur="5.16">crazy the walkaway movement is important</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="4.5">I think and that just is a movement if</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="4.95">you guys don&amp;#39;t know it was started a</text>
  <text start="452.32" dur="5.79">while ago and it&amp;#39;s basically telling</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="4.2">individuals you know hey people who</text>
  <text start="458.11" dur="3.39">thought they were you know signed up for</text>
  <text start="459.73" dur="4.26">this Democrat Party of realized the</text>
  <text start="461.5" dur="6.51">party has evolved in this far far left</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="6.51">you know not even near the center you</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="3.9">know a radical wing it would seem and</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="2.82">and those are the people who are taking</text>
  <text start="471.91" dur="3.09">over that that party and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="473.32" dur="3.42">disturbing right and they want to say</text>
  <text start="475" dur="3.09">that about the the right but I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t believe that that&amp;#39;s true for one</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="6.21">second I think that we&amp;#39;re much more calm</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="5.37">rational you know logically motivated so</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s talking about now the</text>
  <text start="485.86" dur="4.71">next one is this tweet from breaking on</text>
  <text start="488.92" dur="4.02">one talking about Christine Blasi for</text>
  <text start="490.57" dur="4.29">and how she has no plans to pursue her</text>
  <text start="492.94" dur="4.2">sexual misconduct allegations against</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="6.33">Brett Kavanaugh according to her</text>
  <text start="497.14" dur="6.27">attorneys now there you go I mean first</text>
  <text start="501.19" dur="3.72">of all we all know none of this would</text>
  <text start="503.41" dur="3.57">ever stand up in court there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="504.91" dur="3.72">evidence there&amp;#39;s no verifiable proof she</text>
  <text start="506.98" dur="2.91">doesn&amp;#39;t remember when it happened or</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="2.97">where it happened to me she may have</text>
  <text start="509.89" dur="4.35">narrowed it down to like the summer of</text>
  <text start="511.6" dur="4.2">1982 but let&amp;#39;s just be honest that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="4.29">telling a date that&amp;#39;s not saying it</text>
  <text start="515.8" dur="4.679">happened Wednesday August 16th at 8 p.m.</text>
  <text start="518.53" dur="3.27">here which is something you might need</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="4.261">if you&amp;#39;re gonna actually have a criminal</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="4.08">investigation into it right and you</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="2.94">can&amp;#39;t just be like oh it happened</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="4.1">somewhere in this time and and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="527.68" dur="4.1">know where but in this area you know</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s only like thousands and</text>
  <text start="531.78" dur="4.41">thousands of homes and residences there</text>
  <text start="533.82" dur="4.38">so that kind of stuff is what really</text>
  <text start="536.19" dur="4.26">would prevent her from going forward and</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="3.84">then just once again it kind of lends</text>

  <text start="548.46" dur="7.35">fund me and now she&amp;#39;s gone well I wonder</text>
  <text start="552.63" dur="4.83">what that was all about right it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="4.23">ridiculous and then it says political</text>
  <text start="557.46" dur="4.86">hit by Democrats regain power by any</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="3.75">means necessary new narrative coming cue</text>
  <text start="562.32" dur="3.87">so of course they&amp;#39;re gonna have a new</text>
  <text start="563.79" dur="4.41">narrative it&amp;#39;s gonna be a new allegation</text>
  <text start="566.19" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;m sure something very much Outland</text>
  <text start="568.2" dur="3.66">more outlandish than what we&amp;#39;ve even</text>
  <text start="569.82" dur="3.9">seen yet and they&amp;#39;ll probably you know</text>
  <text start="571.86" dur="3.12">do whatever they can to make that work</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="4.35">and then when that doesn&amp;#39;t stick they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="4.92">just go to the next thing but it is very</text>
  <text start="578.07" dur="3.3">much starting to look like it was a</text>
  <text start="579.9" dur="3.99">political hit by the Democrats that was</text>
  <text start="581.37" dur="4.77">put put out a while ago now the next one</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="3.72">here and basically we&amp;#39;ll see what the</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="3.99">new narratives it&amp;#39;s coming and narrative</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="4.17">is that&amp;#39;s coming and they will just want</text>
  <text start="590.13" dur="4.05">they just want power by any means they</text>
  <text start="591.78" dur="5.04">really do not care about whose lives</text>
  <text start="594.18" dur="4.65">they destroy and what they do what kind</text>
  <text start="596.82" dur="4.23">of damage they do in the interim they</text>
  <text start="598.83" dur="4.14">really just are so power-hungry it would</text>
  <text start="601.05" dur="3.36">seem that they do not care about those</text>

  <text start="830.91" dur="3.57">the odds of that q so the odds of that</text>
  <text start="832.44" dur="3.3">are almost zero especially given the</text>
  <text start="834.48" dur="3.35">people who are making the accusations</text>
  <text start="835.74" dur="5.16">against justice Cavanaugh aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="837.83" dur="6.22">bringing forth evidence that would lend</text>
  <text start="840.9" dur="5.19">itself to believe their their claims</text>
  <text start="844.05" dur="3.3">right they&amp;#39;re just making these wild</text>
  <text start="846.09" dur="4.14">accusations that are uncorroborated</text>
  <text start="847.35" dur="6.09">unverified which somehow now pass for</text>
  <text start="850.23" dur="4.38">being a verifiable and you know if you</text>

  <text start="857.97" dur="3.45">what Cuse told us what happened and now</text>
  <text start="859.62" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re gonna expect this to happen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="861.42" dur="4.77">gonna expect that maybe a platform a big</text>
  <text start="864.54" dur="3.87">part of the platform for the Democrats</text>
  <text start="866.19" dur="3.69">is telling the voters oh if you put me</text>
  <text start="868.41" dur="4.32">in office we&amp;#39;re gonna impeach justice</text>
  <text start="869.88" dur="5.22">Cavanaugh and you&amp;#39;re like for what for</text>
  <text start="872.73" dur="5.22">what all these accusations have not been</text>
  <text start="875.1" dur="6.21">corroborated and they&amp;#39;re not valid in my</text>
  <text start="877.95" dur="5.22">opinion so what you know what are you</text>
  <text start="881.31" dur="3.9">gonna impeach him for because he&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="883.17" dur="5.1">know but not a Democrat I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="885.21" dur="4.98">know what to say besides that this is</text>
  <text start="888.27" dur="3.33">going to be very incredible to watch and</text>
  <text start="890.19" dur="4.49">says herd the Sheep yes unfortunately</text>
  <text start="891.6" dur="6.54">that&amp;#39;s how they see the Democrats see</text>
  <text start="894.68" dur="6.16">their constituency mostly is is sheep to</text>
  <text start="898.14" dur="5.91">be you know herded and it&amp;#39;s really sad</text>
  <text start="900.84" dur="4.44">but there&amp;#39;s no way I would ever believe</text>
  <text start="904.05" dur="3.14">in a second that they could get</text>
  <text start="905.28" dur="4.11">two-thirds of the Senate to impeach</text>
  <text start="907.19" dur="4.6">Cavanaugh so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="909.39" dur="5.34">how that goes and that&amp;#39;s basically what</text>
  <text start="911.79" dur="4.73">Q&amp;#39;s telling us right now the next one</text>
  <text start="914.73" dur="4.41">here is very interesting so this is a</text>
  <text start="916.52" dur="4.87">first Q gives us a link to this c-span</text>
  <text start="919.14" dur="3.96">video which is actually Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="921.39" dur="4.41">talking about how they have this thing</text>
  <text start="923.1" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s called a wrap up smear okay that</text>
  <text start="925.8" dur="4.71">sounds great right a wrap up smear and</text>
  <text start="928.02" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re gonna listen to her explain that</text>
  <text start="930.51" dur="4.95">filling breath you demonize and then you</text>
  <text start="933" dur="4.47">it we called the wrap-up smear if anyone</text>
  <text start="935.46" dur="5.43">talk politics called the wrap-up smear</text>
  <text start="937.47" dur="6.15">you smear somebody with falsehoods and</text>
  <text start="940.89" dur="5.49">all the rest and then you merchandize it</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="5.19">and then you write it and they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="946.38" dur="4.95">see it&amp;#39;s reported in the press that this</text>
  <text start="948.81" dur="5.19">this this and this so they have that</text>
  <text start="951.33" dur="4.8">validation that the Press reported the</text>
  <text start="954" dur="4.35">smear and then it&amp;#39;s called the wrap-up</text>
  <text start="956.13" dur="4.62">smear now I&amp;#39;m going to merchandise the</text>
  <text start="958.35" dur="5.55">presses report on the smear that we made</text>
  <text start="960.75" dur="9">that&amp;#39;s miss atactic and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="963.9" dur="9.36">self-evident ok so there you go</text>
  <text start="969.75" dur="5.7">and Q says look wrap up smear deployed</text>
  <text start="973.26" dur="5.85">verse justice Kavanagh it&amp;#39;s a question</text>
  <text start="975.45" dur="8.04">the more you know archive q so first of</text>
  <text start="979.11" dur="5.97">all it&amp;#39;s so funny because Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="983.49" dur="4.05">knowledge is she described kind of what</text>
  <text start="985.08" dur="6.03">happened to or what will happen I guess</text>
  <text start="987.54" dur="5.13">to justice Kavanagh but this is exactly</text>
  <text start="991.11" dur="2.88">what seemed to have happened against</text>
  <text start="992.67" dur="3.15">President Trump to where they started</text>
  <text start="993.99" dur="3.81">smearing him and then they put these</text>
  <text start="995.82" dur="3.21">news stories they planted their own news</text>
  <text start="997.8" dur="3.57">stories into the media and then they</text>
  <text start="999.03" dur="4.2">could use the stories as validation of</text>
  <text start="1001.37" dur="4.5">what they&amp;#39;re saying so it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text>
  <text start="1003.23" dur="6.3">this self-fulfilling prophecy like she</text>
  <text start="1005.87" dur="6.06">says where oh he&amp;#39;s a bad person and then</text>
  <text start="1009.53" dur="4.59">over here here&amp;#39;s a secret memo</text>
  <text start="1011.93" dur="4.17">confidential memo that I made up about</text>
  <text start="1014.12" dur="3.54">him give that to the New York Times and</text>
  <text start="1016.1" dur="3.48">they write an article and then I can go</text>
  <text start="1017.66" dur="4.2">oh yes see the New York Times even wrote</text>
  <text start="1019.58" dur="4.35">an article about that see so I&amp;#39;m right</text>
  <text start="1021.86" dur="4.14">and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="1023.93" dur="3.48">presumably to justice Cavanaugh if they</text>
  <text start="1026" dur="3.69">haven&amp;#39;t already started it and that by</text>
  <text start="1027.41" dur="4.44">now and then you&amp;#39;re gonna have to look</text>
  <text start="1029.69" dur="3.63">forward to President Trump they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1031.85" dur="3.75">keep going with the rapid manner they</text>
  <text start="1033.32" dur="4.2">have going on him and it&amp;#39;s just a tactic</text>
  <text start="1035.6" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s being described as being widely</text>
  <text start="1037.52" dur="4.98">used and then it says here and then a</text>
  <text start="1040.1" dur="5.099">repost search-and-destroy so it talks</text>
  <text start="1042.5" dur="4.62">about how the the tactics that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1045.199" dur="4.341">used and and this is really what</text>
  <text start="1047.12" dur="4.65">Cavanaugh said or in during his</text>
  <text start="1049.54" dur="3.4">testimony where he was trying to defend</text>
  <text start="1051.77" dur="2.73">himself this has been a</text>
  <text start="1052.94" dur="3.66">search-and-destroy missus mission</text>
  <text start="1054.5" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s no advise and consent</text>
  <text start="1056.6" dur="4.2">it was Search and Destroy because they</text>
  <text start="1058.61" dur="5.09">were not looking to advise and consent</text>
  <text start="1060.8" dur="6.109">they were looking to take a man&amp;#39;s career</text>
  <text start="1063.7" dur="5.25">lifetime of work and then basically</text>
  <text start="1066.909" dur="3.48">discount that because they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1068.95" dur="3.06">his politics they don&amp;#39;t like where he</text>
  <text start="1070.389" dur="3.301">stands and they would by any means</text>

  <text start="1124.96" dur="5.16">obviously is is appalling and disgusting</text>

  <text start="1166.779" dur="5.041">very not actually that sarcastic um not</text>
  <text start="1168.789" dur="4.441">at all but this is what it&amp;#39;s saying and</text>
  <text start="1171.82" dur="3.209">then there&amp;#39;s a quick history lesson</text>
  <text start="1173.23" dur="5.309">attached to it talking about the 13th</text>
  <text start="1175.029" dur="6.78">amendment abolished slavery guess what</text>

  <text start="1195.94" dur="3.72">support 0% Democrat</text>
  <text start="1197.29" dur="3.66">sport so we have to remember that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1199.66" dur="4.35">not just that the Democrat Party</text>
  <text start="1200.95" dur="4.98">historically or today I should say are</text>
  <text start="1204.01" dur="3.63">not representing the true will of the</text>
  <text start="1205.93" dur="4.11">American people in my opinion but</text>
  <text start="1207.64" dur="4.71">historically they&amp;#39;ve always been for all</text>
  <text start="1210.04" dur="3.81">these things that now they try to throw</text>
  <text start="1212.35" dur="4.11">against Republicans but the reality is</text>
  <text start="1213.85" dur="4.83">the Democrats have never changed they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1216.46" dur="5.94">just shifted tactics with the same out</text>
  <text start="1218.68" dur="5.73">same desired outcomes and that to me is</text>
  <text start="1222.4" dur="5.16">an important takeaway from all of this</text>
  <text start="1224.41" dur="4.71">so Hugh says unplug from the fake news</text>
  <text start="1227.56" dur="3.18">the false reality that you&amp;#39;re presented</text>
  <text start="1229.12" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s the propaganda arm of the</text>

  <text start="1240.07" dur="4.59">words are so you know Q is has repeated</text>
  <text start="1243.28" dur="3.63">these kind of messages but they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="1244.66" dur="3.87">true first you&amp;#39;ve got to unplug from</text>
  <text start="1246.91" dur="3.3">that fake news false reality most of you</text>
  <text start="1248.53" dur="3.63">guys watching this video probably have</text>
  <text start="1250.21" dur="4.08">already to some degree or another have</text>
  <text start="1252.16" dur="4.2">done that then you have to understand</text>
  <text start="1254.29" dur="4.53">that they&amp;#39;re being they&amp;#39;re a prophet</text>
  <text start="1256.36" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re propagandists for the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1258.82" dur="4.92">who want to control they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1261.4" dur="4.08">give freedom they want to control and</text>
  <text start="1263.74" dur="3.93">they want to use the government to</text>
  <text start="1265.48" dur="3.6">control people&amp;#39;s lives and it&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1267.67" dur="3.09">think for yourself research for yourself</text>
  <text start="1269.08" dur="3.18">trust yourself that&amp;#39;s all important</text>
  <text start="1270.76" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s what I tell you guys don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="1272.26" dur="3.21">me go out into the research I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1273.79" dur="2.64">giving you kind of an outline and you</text>
  <text start="1275.47" dur="3.3">guys can go out and do your own research</text>
  <text start="1276.43" dur="4.95">and find your own truth</text>
  <text start="1278.77" dur="4.47">you know because you don&amp;#39;t have to just</text>
  <text start="1281.38" dur="3.39">accept what I say or just as much as you</text>
  <text start="1283.24" dur="5.31">don&amp;#39;t have to accept with the the</text>

  <text start="1288.55" dur="4.56">a pawn in their sick game that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1290.59" dur="5.85">the takeaway there and now this final</text>
  <text start="1293.11" dur="4.86">post is from Q today and it gives this</text>
  <text start="1296.44" dur="3.99">picture of the American flag it says</text>
  <text start="1297.97" dur="4.53">AMERICA AMERICA God shed His grace on</text>
  <text start="1300.43" dur="5.1">thee and Crown thy good with Brotherhood</text>
  <text start="1302.5" dur="5.19">from sea to shining sea I can say those</text>
  <text start="1305.53" dur="5.01">words and they really make me feel great</text>
  <text start="1307.69" dur="5.49">and then we get this great quote from</text>
