  <text start="9.61" dur="4.529">18 years ago on this very day our</text>
  <text start="12.73" dur="3.45">country was attacked by a group of</text>
  <text start="14.139" dur="4.741">cowards who sought the destruction of</text>
  <text start="16.18" dur="5.429">our very way of living today we stand</text>
  <text start="18.88" dur="6.11">united still against the enemies of our</text>
  <text start="21.609" dur="6.99">republic both foreign and domestic and</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="5.23">that&amp;#39;s what q is all about for too long</text>
  <text start="28.599" dur="3.811">our country has continued to breathe a</text>
  <text start="30.22" dur="4.5">feckless and corrupt political class</text>
  <text start="32.41" dur="4.88">whose lack of genuine talent is only</text>
  <text start="34.72" dur="5.19">surpassed by their incredible disloyalty</text>
  <text start="37.29" dur="4.87">corruption and incompetence these</text>
  <text start="39.91" dur="5.7">talentless crooks are currently being</text>
  <text start="42.16" dur="7.08">ousted by our movement where we go on we</text>
  <text start="45.61" dur="5.61">go all where we go one we go all is not</text>
  <text start="49.24" dur="5.1">just something that Q said on a post</text>
  <text start="51.22" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s a way to remind us that we are a</text>
  <text start="54.34" dur="6.03">part of a bigger movement we the people</text>
  <text start="58.39" dur="4.59">are forging a new path for those who are</text>
  <text start="60.37" dur="4.76">sick and tired of being lied to and led</text>
  <text start="62.98" dur="4.679">astray like lambs to the slaughter</text>
  <text start="65.13" dur="4.869">where we go one is a movement for those</text>
  <text start="67.659" dur="4.38">who want to know the truth about our</text>
  <text start="69.999" dur="8.22">country so we can have a fighting chance</text>
  <text start="72.039" dur="8.341">to save it now I like many others have</text>
  <text start="78.219" dur="6.451">been a big supporter of President Trump</text>
  <text start="80.38" dur="6.9">since day one back in 2015 presidents</text>
  <text start="84.67" dur="4.86">from first started running for office I</text>
  <text start="87.28" dur="4.379">was writing a blog and nobody was paying</text>
  <text start="89.53" dur="4.019">attention but I was there at the</text>
  <text start="91.659" dur="4.95">beginning because I saw a need for</text>
  <text start="93.549" dur="5.731">change in our country for too long</text>
  <text start="96.609" dur="4.981">politicians and corporate leaders and</text>
  <text start="99.28" dur="4.289">others in our society have been allowed</text>
  <text start="101.59" dur="5.849">to get away with some of the most evil</text>
  <text start="103.569" dur="5.991">satanic and demonic activities one could</text>
  <text start="107.439" dur="5.49">ever imagine and it&amp;#39;s all being done</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="5.079">behind closed doors and they think that</text>
  <text start="112.929" dur="3.51">we the people will never wake up to</text>
  <text start="114.639" dur="3.72">everything that&amp;#39;s happening what Q is</text>
  <text start="116.439" dur="4.14">done has given us an opportunity to wake</text>
  <text start="118.359" dur="4.771">up to that yeah and now that we are</text>
  <text start="120.579" dur="4.53">awake it is incumbent upon every single</text>
  <text start="123.13" dur="3.93">person to continue to put this</text>
  <text start="125.109" dur="5.04">information out there as far and as wide</text>
  <text start="127.06" dur="7.44">as we can we have to continue to expose</text>
  <text start="130.149" dur="6.151">this evil because that is what our job</text>
  <text start="134.5" dur="7.25">is in this movement</text>
  <text start="136.3" dur="9.39">in 2016 we&amp;#39;ve defeated this cabal in</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="9.43">2016 we rejected their full song of</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="7.23">globalism sorry from Mike we rejected</text>
  <text start="151.18" dur="3.77">their fall songs globalism and we</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="8.46">elected a champion of the people in</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="9.55">president Trump but today it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="161.38" dur="4.62">coming under attack once again our</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="3.9">movement began with the simple phrase</text>
  <text start="166" dur="4.95">make America great again a phrase that</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="4.59">embodied the overwhelmingly daunting</text>
  <text start="170.95" dur="4.02">task of reestablishing a country that</text>
  <text start="172.99" dur="4.23">has been responsible for so many great</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="4.32">ideas ideals and achievements our</text>
  <text start="177.22" dur="4.44">founding fathers built a system of</text>
  <text start="179.29" dur="5.16">government governance by the people and</text>
  <text start="181.66" dur="5.49">for the people they fought bled and died</text>
  <text start="184.45" dur="5.4">to ensure that future generations would</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="6.83">enjoy the same freedoms which were</text>
  <text start="189.85" dur="4.13">inherently promised to us by our Creator</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="6.22">but in case you are not aware our</text>
  <text start="198.46" dur="5.82">country has been lulled into a state of</text>
  <text start="200.59" dur="4.89">unmitigated complacency the incredible</text>
  <text start="204.28" dur="2.88">advancement of technology in the</text>
  <text start="205.48" dur="3.57">Internet has created a new domain in</text>
  <text start="207.16" dur="4.41">which an unbelievable amount of power</text>
  <text start="209.05" dur="4.91">and control has fallen into the hands of</text>
  <text start="211.57" dur="5.19">a very small group of extremely</text>
  <text start="213.96" dur="7.27">diabolical and dishonest political and</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="5.84">corporate entities as of this speech</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="3.87">here today</text>
  <text start="222.6" dur="4.75">there remained countless examples of how</text>
  <text start="225.1" dur="4.11">these monolithic corporations have</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="4.14">started using their immense power</text>
  <text start="229.21" dur="5.07">coupled with their vast legal immunities</text>
  <text start="231.49" dur="5.07">to begin the wholesale removal of we the</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="6.12">American people&amp;#39;s constitutionally</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="9.15">guaranteed right to free speech without</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="7.17">unreasonable discrimination just as the</text>
  <text start="245.71" dur="3.54">civil rights movement sought to remedy a</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="3.72">broken broken system which</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="5.01">institutionalized racism and bigotry</text>
  <text start="251.29" dur="5.009">so too are we desperately in need of a</text>
  <text start="254.26" dur="4.59">movement champion by a leader who will</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="5.821">recognize the injustice of our modern</text>
  <text start="258.85" dur="4.65">big tech tyranny and that&amp;#39;s a big part</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="5.549">of what we&amp;#39;re fighting against here in</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="5.669">the queue movement our society is</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="2.281">composed of a multitude of different</text>
  <text start="269.169" dur="3.091">thoughts and</text>
  <text start="269.95" dur="4.38">these ideas are these thoughts and ideas</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="4.17">are of paramount importance when one</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="3.9">examines the innate foundational base of</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="4.65">our free and open society which is a</text>
  <text start="278.23" dur="4.47">beacon of hope around the world and if</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="3.87">you look at any other country like the</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="3.87">Communist Chinese they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="284.95" dur="3">freedoms that we have we have to stand</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="4.62">up and fight for our First Amendment</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="7.26">right to continue to speak the truth as</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="5.55">we know it that is inherently promised</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="4.2">to us through the Constitution in the</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="4.05">Bill of Rights but unfortunately there</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="3.75">are those among us who do not believe</text>
  <text start="300.79" dur="4.02">that our basic freedoms matter there are</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="3.36">those among us who prefer oppression</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="4.32">over expression and there are those</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="5.01">among us who prefer silence over debate</text>
  <text start="309.13" dur="5.25">but most importantly there are those</text>
  <text start="311.53" dur="8.94">among us who prefer servitude over</text>
  <text start="314.38" dur="7.71">freedom over the span of history our</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="3.69">nation has endured wars famines</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="5.52">epidemics natural disasters and a Great</text>
  <text start="324.16" dur="5.49">Depression just to name a few things but</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="4.11">we have persevered and overcome these</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="5.01">great challenges by coming together and</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="5.43">reinforcing the idea that America is an</text>
  <text start="334.66" dur="7.26">exceptional nation with an exceptional</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="6.63">people today our new adversity presents</text>
  <text start="341.92" dur="4.2">itself in the form of authoritarian</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="6.69">censorship among many other things this</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="6">is the primary issue I think after</text>
  <text start="350.47" dur="3.54">decades of empty promises and</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="4.11">disingenuous platitudes the elites of</text>
  <text start="354.01" dur="5.19">Silicon Valley finally revealed their</text>
  <text start="356.23" dur="4.71">true intent by initiating the most</text>
  <text start="359.2" dur="3.36">draconian and Orwellian push towards</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="4.85">centralized control of thought this</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="5.82">country has ever seen in modern times</text>
  <text start="365.79" dur="4.45">Facebook Twitter YouTube and Google have</text>
  <text start="368.38" dur="3.84">used their unassuming corporate facades</text>
  <text start="370.24" dur="3.81">to not only become the largest and most</text>
  <text start="372.22" dur="3.45">powerful corporations in the world but</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="3.75">they have also managed to make</text>
  <text start="375.67" dur="5.46">themselves ubiquitous as the only game</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="5.31">worth playing our nation&amp;#39;s political</text>
  <text start="381.13" dur="4.08">discourse as well as nearly all other</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="4.47">discourse has now crossed into the</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="4.32">digital age newspapers radios and TVs</text>
  <text start="387.58" dur="4.47">are now fading into the realm of</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="4.14">antiquity only to be rapidly replaced by</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="3.72">the ever-growing use and dependence on</text>
  <text start="393.67" dur="3.12">the Internet via a computer smartphone</text>
  <text start="395.77" dur="3.36">and tablet</text>
  <text start="396.79" dur="4.35">with this migration big tech companies</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="3.72">have gained veritable monopolies over</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="6.6">digital information in the span of only</text>
  <text start="402.85" dur="6.87">a couple of decades this transition and</text>
  <text start="407.74" dur="3.96">subsequent result has profoundly changed</text>
  <text start="409.72" dur="5.1">landscape for free speech in this</text>
  <text start="411.7" dur="5.73">country and I believe that cue the</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="12.57">movement is about free speech more than</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="12.84">it is about any other thing this to me</text>
  <text start="427.39" dur="4.23">is an egregious violation of our civil</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="3.09">rights people are being banned from</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="4.35">these supposed open speech platforms</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="5.13">simply because someone somewhere is</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="8.01">offended by what someone else has to say</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="6.9">and it and it&amp;#39;s getting worse if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.98" dur="2.7">going to uphold the tenets and</text>
  <text start="445.39" dur="2.82">principles outlined in the US</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="4.05">Constitution of the Bill of Rights we</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="4.77">must address this issue now before these</text>
  <text start="450.73" dur="5.01">big tech oligarchs start to intervene in</text>
  <text start="452.98" dur="5.43">our political system more by using their</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="4.5">absurdly massive reach and control to</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="4.5">affect their own desired outcome and</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="13.05">subvert the will of the American people</text>
  <text start="462.91" dur="13.01">a minute so with that I want to remind</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="6.18">everyone the words of President Trump</text>
  <text start="475.92" dur="5.08">quote our movement is about replacing a</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="3.45">failed and corrupt political</text>
  <text start="481" dur="4.71">establishment with a new government</text>
  <text start="482.92" dur="4.44">controlled by we the American people the</text>
  <text start="485.71" dur="3.54">Washington establishment and the</text>
  <text start="487.36" dur="5.54">financial and media corporations that</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="9.3">funded exist only for one reason to</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="7.75">protect and enrich themselves these</text>
  <text start="498.55" dur="4.71">institutions must abide by the</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="7.71">Constitution and they must be held</text>
  <text start="503.26" dur="7.62">accountable finally what I want to leave</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="5.369">you with is as you guys know if you guys</text>
  <text start="510.88" dur="5.07">watch my channel if not I&amp;#39;m a Christian</text>
  <text start="513.729" dur="4.801">evangelist and the most important thing</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="6.39">I think I bring to the movement and to</text>
  <text start="518.53" dur="7.5">the world at large is the message of God</text>
  <text start="522.34" dur="6.99">you are all children of God you&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="526.03" dur="4.2">loved by God and Jesus died on the cross</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="3.18">for each and every</text>
  <text start="530.23" dur="5.88">one of your sins so that you may spend</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="5.79">eternity in heaven so don&amp;#39;t let the</text>
  <text start="536.11" dur="4.38">media lie to you and deceive you and</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="4.11">make you think you are less than we are</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="4.02">all children of God and we are all</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="4.62">entitled to that great salvation that is</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="4.59">awaiting us and if you if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="547.03" dur="3.51">little bit further away from your faith</text>
  <text start="549.1" dur="2.85">and it&amp;#39;s been a while or you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="4.08">strong and you haven&amp;#39;t been there in a</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="4.77">while look the way I say it is just say</text>
  <text start="554.62" dur="4.2">a prayer just say a prayer to open your</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="4.23">heart and reach out to God and remember</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="4.74">that as dark as all the stuff is that we</text>
  <text start="560.95" dur="5.07">end up covering here I want to focus on</text>
  <text start="563.56" dur="4.5">reminding us that we are children of God</text>
  <text start="566.02" dur="3.54">so I want to read this this scripture to</text>
  <text start="568.06" dur="2.88">you and then bola and then I&amp;#39;ll go ahead</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="3.54">and turn it over to the next speaker</text>
  <text start="570.94" dur="4.05">I don&amp;#39;t want to read this verse it&amp;#39;s out</text>
