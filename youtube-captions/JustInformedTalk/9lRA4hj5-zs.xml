  <text start="202.85" dur="4.98">scheduled for September fifth so with</text>

  <text start="207.83" dur="4.68">stories breaking every single day it</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="3.84">just gets crazier and crazier but before</text>
  <text start="212.51" dur="3.09">we get into all of that we&amp;#39;re gonna look</text>
  <text start="213.71" dur="5.04">at breaking news stories plus the big</text>
  <text start="215.6" dur="6.12">story which is this overstock CEO out of</text>
  <text start="218.75" dur="5.55">nowhere jumps on live TV announces his</text>
  <text start="221.72" dur="5.19">resignation and says by the way I was</text>
  <text start="224.3" dur="4.26">working for the FBI to try to set up</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="2.88">President Trump with the rush of</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="3.9">collusion hoax and a bunch of other</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="4.62">Republicans too but there are some very</text>
  <text start="232.46" dur="3.48">fishy things about his story so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.41" dur="3.6">gonna take a look at what the anton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="4.29">have been picking up on and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="4.17">actually going or may be going on there</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="3.66">before we do that I always encourage</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="3.42">everyone to come back here to the</text>
  <text start="243.89" dur="2.97">landing page watch his ice videos share</text>
  <text start="245.6" dur="4.08">them on social media and why do I say</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="5.1">that you guys already know if you&amp;#39;re new</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="5.01">to this I have to explain there is an</text>
  <text start="251.96" dur="4.98">algorithmic suppression that is built-in</text>
  <text start="254.69" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s a bias that is written into the</text>
  <text start="256.94" dur="5.109">algorithms that Google uses to aggregate</text>
  <text start="259.79" dur="4.599">content so</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="3.87">basically what has happened is content</text>
  <text start="264.389" dur="4.5">like mine and a bunch of other people</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="4.771">who are competing with the mainstream</text>
  <text start="268.889" dur="4.471">media news is narrative the</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="5.219">quote-unquote authoritative which I like</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="4.98">to call authoritarian source for</text>
  <text start="275.909" dur="4.771">information that Google and YouTube have</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="4.979">decided to back they decide to give them</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="4.799">a higher ranking than us in everything</text>
  <text start="283.319" dur="3.961">so no matter what we do our content will</text>
  <text start="285.479" dur="4.53">never come up for certain types of</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="5.099">searches and we have to fight that by</text>
  <text start="290.009" dur="3.81">sharing this content manually what does</text>
  <text start="292.379" dur="3.421">that mean there&amp;#39;s a share button at the</text>
  <text start="293.819" dur="3.72">bottom of this video go click it share</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="3.959">it on any other social media you got and</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s how we get around it so that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="299.759" dur="3.571">whole spiel if you don&amp;#39;t know what cute</text>

  <text start="309.81" dur="3.69">gonna pick up on a story that we covered</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="3.72">previously here on the channel but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.5" dur="4.02">gonna pick up on what has happened it</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="5.549">looks like there&amp;#39;s been a little bit of</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="5.79">a backlash from Gillette going or</text>

  <text start="323.31" dur="6.03">and now they are going broke reporting a</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="5.19">12 billion dollar loss and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="4.77">eight billion dollars alone in the</text>

  <text start="345.479" dur="6.12">are the arbiters of truth and morality</text>
  <text start="346.889" dur="6.691">in society okay because it&amp;#39;s not your a</text>

  <text start="361.5" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s come out and you can see now</text>
  <text start="362.849" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve come back with these ads that</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="5.46">are more targeted toward men and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.469" dur="5.73">trying to actually get that audience</text>

  <text start="373.199" dur="3.96">you know who knows we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="3.479">happens there I just thought I&amp;#39;d bring</text>
  <text start="377.159" dur="3.301">that up as a interesting aside to</text>
  <text start="379.289" dur="3.481">everything that we&amp;#39;re gonna be covering</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="4.049">here today because it is a follow-up to</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="3.989">a previous story poured here on the</text>
  <text start="384.509" dur="4.53">channel here&amp;#39;s another story the feds</text>
  <text start="386.759" dur="3.601">have subpoenaed 20 officers at the</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="3.421">Manhattan prison with Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="4.47">died this is coming on the heels of</text>
  <text start="392.46" dur="3.12">reports that the officers inside the</text>

  <text start="395.58" dur="4.26">morning Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s former</text>

  <text start="417.21" dur="3.739">at the Manhattan Correctional Facility</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="6.339">trial in New York now this to me is an</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="3.899">interesting story because we are trying</text>
  <text start="427.949" dur="4.56">to get down to the bottom of what has</text>
  <text start="429.509" dur="4.791">happened here but who knows how much</text>
  <text start="432.509" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ll ever be able to become public</text>
  <text start="434.3" dur="3.82">hopefully we&amp;#39;ll be able to get the whole</text>
  <text start="436.199" dur="4.111">story and figure out how Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="3.87">in one of the world and I mean you would</text>
  <text start="440.31" dur="4.829">say one of the world&amp;#39;s most secure</text>
  <text start="441.99" dur="5.1">holding facilities was allowed to kill</text>
  <text start="445.139" dur="3.87">himself after he had already made one</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="4.949">attempt on his own life allegedly and</text>
  <text start="449.009" dur="5.16">that there was no surveillance there was</text>
  <text start="452.039" dur="4.261">no cameras nobody saw anything in the</text>
  <text start="454.169" dur="5.671">guards were eating doughnuts and fallen</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="4.95">asleep in the break room I mean and then</text>
  <text start="459.84" dur="3.569">all the other suspicious stuff that</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="5.25">happened with the strange arrivals the</text>
  <text start="463.409" dur="5.85">moving of cells the words they heard</text>
  <text start="466.5" dur="6.469">screams coming from his cell about how</text>
  <text start="469.259" dur="6.15">he needs to breathe so you know to me</text>
  <text start="472.969" dur="4.181">this story continues to get worse and</text>
  <text start="475.409" dur="3.6">worse not to mention the fact that a lot</text>
  <text start="477.15" dur="4.019">of people believe it was a extraction</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="5.94">operation where he was removed and put</text>
  <text start="481.169" dur="6.75">into possibly witness protection maybe</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="5.671">use abducted by aliens who knows but but</text>
  <text start="487.919" dur="5.46">what we do know is that the official</text>
  <text start="490.62" dur="5.19">story is that he is dead so you know hey</text>
  <text start="493.379" dur="5.19">take it with a grain of salt it is what</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="5.34">it is on the outside right now and it</text>
  <text start="498.569" dur="4.44">seems like there the DOJ is taking it</text>
  <text start="501.15" dur="5.87">seriously as far as trying to find out</text>
  <text start="503.009" dur="4.011">what happened at that Detention Facility</text>
  <text start="507.199" dur="4.571">here&amp;#39;s another very interesting story so</text>
  <text start="509.969" dur="3.421">if you guys remember Rick Gates was a</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="5.36">very popular name from the Muller</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="6.18">investigation early on and apparently</text>
  <text start="517.13" dur="5.789">Obama&amp;#39;s White House Counsel this man</text>
  <text start="519.57" dur="7.32">named Greg Craig is on trial for</text>
  <text start="522.919" dur="6.311">multiple counts of basically working for</text>
  <text start="526.89" dur="2.59">Ukraine without registering as a foreign</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="3.07">aid</text>
  <text start="529.48" dur="5.67">and then spreading information that</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="4.23">would help him it&amp;#39;s a very long and</text>
  <text start="535.15" dur="4.92">convoluted story but what was very</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="4.11">interesting about this in the trial</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="3.86">today</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="7.65">Rick Gates came and testified against</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="6.43">Greg Craig and says that Tony Podesta</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="4.41">was one of the ones helping behind the</text>
  <text start="550.36" dur="4.71">scenes to orchestrate everything with</text>
  <text start="552.7" dur="4.68">these Ukraine deals so we all know about</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="4.53">Ukraine being a major point of</text>
  <text start="557.38" dur="4.47">contention for the deep state and</text>
  <text start="559.6" dur="3.78">Obama&amp;#39;s administration that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="3.38">ways they got rich you know they sold us</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="5.37">out to the Ukrainians and the Chinese</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="7.21">allegedly and we can only say that as an</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="5.76">alleged offense because all we have is a</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="2.85">set of circumstance circumstantial</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="5.1">evidence to go on</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="6.66">meaning you have lots of kickbacks lots</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="5.4">of people connected to Biden and others</text>
  <text start="581.95" dur="5.49">in the administration getting millions</text>
  <text start="585.01" dur="5.13">of dollars including Muller Clinton and</text>
  <text start="587.44" dur="4.53">the rest they were getting millions and</text>
  <text start="590.14" dur="7.49">millions of dollars from Ukrainians and</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="8.22">Chinese supposedly you know independent</text>
  <text start="597.63" dur="3.93">non-governmental actors but we are</text>
  <text start="600.19" dur="4.26">starting to figure out that the people</text>

  <text start="612.64" dur="3.96">that for you guys to read through it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.53" dur="3.57">obviously an interesting article and</text>

  <text start="618.1" dur="5.34">that it&amp;#39;s come up today so here we go a</text>
  <text start="621.37" dur="3.69">couple other interesting things some</text>
  <text start="623.44" dur="4.08">names on the flight log so I guess a</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="4.86">Naomi Campbell came out with this video</text>
  <text start="627.52" dur="6.72">where she basically is saying just</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="6.75">because I knew Jeffrey Epstein doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="5.04">mean I&amp;#39;m guilty of all the things he is</text>
  <text start="636.67" dur="4.02">which fair enough I&amp;#39;ll give her that but</text>
  <text start="639.28" dur="4.11">what I won&amp;#39;t give her is the fact that</text>
  <text start="640.69" dur="4.53">she&amp;#39;s trying to distance herself so far</text>
  <text start="643.39" dur="3.69">away that she&amp;#39;s making it seem as though</text>
  <text start="645.22" dur="4.71">they had almost no relationship</text>
  <text start="647.08" dur="5.25">whatsoever and it&amp;#39;s just really</text>
  <text start="649.93" dur="5.82">fascinating to see how you know somebody</text>
  <text start="652.33" dur="6.27">who made multiple flights as you can see</text>
  <text start="655.75" dur="4.62">here on it would seem on jeffrey</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="4.049">Epstein&amp;#39;s private plane is coming out</text>
  <text start="660.37" dur="4.05">with this kind of message saying the</text>
  <text start="662.649" dur="2.91">in conclusion here is that if the</text>
  <text start="664.42" dur="2.88">negative action of your neighbor</text>
  <text start="665.559" dur="3.661">colleague or even an associate can</text>

  <text start="669.22" dur="3.029">association</text>
  <text start="670.029" dur="4.831">then we indeed live in very worrying</text>
  <text start="672.249" dur="4.231">times this affects us all it&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="674.86" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s unfair and it must be stopped well</text>
  <text start="676.48" dur="4.709">yeah fine I will grant Naomi Campbell</text>
  <text start="679.66" dur="3.359">that we are not going to do this guilt</text>
  <text start="681.189" dur="3.541">by association thing that the left and</text>
  <text start="683.019" dur="3.57">the fake news media like to do to</text>
  <text start="684.73" dur="2.339">President Trump and his supporters all</text>
  <text start="686.589" dur="4.11">the time</text>
  <text start="687.069" dur="7.351">but what we will say is that you have to</text>
  <text start="690.699" dur="5.58">understand that we all know what Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="694.42" dur="4.44">Epstein was involved in you were one of</text>
  <text start="696.279" dur="4.92">the world&amp;#39;s most famous models spending</text>
  <text start="698.86" dur="6.06">copious amounts of time with him and the</text>
  <text start="701.199" dur="5.091">whole entire premise of his arrest was</text>
  <text start="704.92" dur="3.329">based on the fact that he was</text>
  <text start="706.29" dur="4.2">trafficking women through modeling</text>
  <text start="708.249" dur="4.26">agencies so you&amp;#39;d understand why a</text>
  <text start="710.49" dur="3.61">supermodel like Naomi Campbell who</text>
  <text start="712.509" dur="4.44">spends an exorbitant amount of time with</text>
  <text start="714.1" dur="6.149">Jeffrey Epstein would draw a lot of red</text>
  <text start="716.949" dur="5.43">flags for a lot of people so you know</text>
  <text start="720.249" dur="3.69">just thought I&amp;#39;d point that out another</text>
  <text start="722.379" dur="7.231">interesting one if people have been</text>
  <text start="723.939" dur="8.13">saying did Chief Justice John Chief</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="5.279">Justice John Roberts ride-on Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="732.069" dur="5.851">Epstein is plain what it looks like is</text>
  <text start="734.889" dur="5.37">on these rosters John Roberts is listed</text>
  <text start="737.92" dur="4.74">now is that the same John Roberts could</text>
  <text start="740.259" dur="5.37">there be more than one John Roberts that</text>
  <text start="742.66" dur="5.159">is up for I guess an investigation or</text>
  <text start="745.629" dur="5.43">whatever but what&amp;#39;s fascinating is if</text>
  <text start="747.819" dur="6.841">you look at the way that this is put</text>
  <text start="751.059" dur="8.52">down they compare it to the fact that in</text>
  <text start="754.66" dur="7.469">2001 2010 2011 and that back in that</text>
  <text start="759.579" dur="5.37">time period you can see he was making</text>
  <text start="762.129" dur="5.96">more and more liberal rulings and</text>
  <text start="764.949" dur="6.3">joining the dissent against his</text>
  <text start="768.089" dur="6.16">quote/unquote conservative side of the</text>
  <text start="771.249" dur="5.4">court so you know all I have to say is</text>
  <text start="774.249" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s interesting to continue to see the</text>
  <text start="776.649" dur="5.071">connections that Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s webb</text>
  <text start="778.779" dur="5.4">is weaving and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to wait</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="5.01">and see how all the shapes up but you</text>
  <text start="784.179" dur="5.1">can tell at this point that Epstein was</text>
  <text start="786.73" dur="5.25">the keystone everything queue told us</text>
  <text start="789.279" dur="5.73">about this was very correct in that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="791.98" dur="4.51">connected to more and more and more and</text>
  <text start="795.009" dur="5.231">it&amp;#39;s continuing to</text>
  <text start="796.49" dur="7.95">expand and as it is expanding we have</text>
  <text start="800.24" dur="7.17">this new set of revelations with regard</text>
  <text start="804.44" dur="5.37">to the Russia Gate hoax that was</text>
  <text start="807.41" dur="4.35">perpetrated against the president States</text>
  <text start="809.81" dur="4.98">and why do I say that well there&amp;#39;s a new</text>

  <text start="825.17" dur="5.07">interview that he was tasked to spy on</text>
  <text start="826.91" dur="7.41">Hillary Clinton which immediately for me</text>
  <text start="830.24" dur="5.34">throws up a thousand red flags but with</text>
  <text start="834.32" dur="3.75">that being said we&amp;#39;re gonna take a</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="5.37">deeper look at this story it&amp;#39;s important</text>

  <text start="1369.24" dur="6.37">then he says he was approached in 2015</text>
  <text start="1372.43" dur="8.55">to start a relationship well let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="1375.61" dur="7.68">it this way he was being pursued you</text>
  <text start="1380.98" dur="5.88">could call it according to him by a</text>

  <text start="1395.77" dur="7.95">2015 he was approached by her and they</text>
  <text start="1399.67" dur="8.13">guess hit it off and she wanted access</text>
  <text start="1403.72" dur="5.46">to Republicans big Republicans and she</text>
  <text start="1407.8" dur="3.51">started getting access to these big</text>
  <text start="1409.18" dur="4.8">Republicans and I guess he went to the</text>
  <text start="1411.31" dur="4.92">FBI or his because he had already worked</text>
  <text start="1413.98" dur="4.08">with the FBI he had some sort of contact</text>
  <text start="1416.23" dur="3.99">there for his clearance he had a</text>
  <text start="1418.06" dur="3.66">security clearance so he reported to</text>
  <text start="1420.22" dur="4.35">them that he was having this</text>
  <text start="1421.72" dur="5.52">relationship with this Russian woman who</text>
  <text start="1424.57" dur="5.22">wanted him to go to Russia to talk to</text>
  <text start="1427.24" dur="6.21">Vladimir Putin and all this stuff so his</text>
  <text start="1429.79" dur="6.15">story basically says that the FBI came</text>
  <text start="1433.45" dur="5.25">to him and said to keep the relationship</text>
  <text start="1435.94" dur="7.2">going and to play it out to see where it</text>
  <text start="1438.7" dur="5.85">goes so I mean I&amp;#39;m sorry from getting</text>
  <text start="1443.14" dur="3.6">the kids wrong because this guy&amp;#39;s story</text>
  <text start="1444.55" dur="4.23">is just all over the place so if I sound</text>
  <text start="1446.74" dur="3.57">all over the place it&amp;#39;s because you</text>
  <text start="1448.78" dur="5.13">could watch the videos for yourself of</text>
  <text start="1450.31" dur="4.749">them but it&amp;#39;s definitely a hard story to</text>
  <text start="1453.91" dur="5.739">follow but</text>
  <text start="1455.059" dur="6.87">says that the FBI was hoping to be able</text>
  <text start="1459.649" dur="5.91">to target Hillary Clinton and Donald</text>
  <text start="1461.929" dur="6.84">Trump and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio which</text>
  <text start="1465.559" dur="6.181">doesn&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense but he</text>
  <text start="1468.769" dur="4.951">says that the FBI came to him and told</text>
  <text start="1471.74" dur="6.179">him to break off the relationship and</text>
  <text start="1473.72" dur="6.179">win it I don&amp;#39;t even look okay I&amp;#39;m before</text>
  <text start="1477.919" dur="3.931">I butcher this guy&amp;#39;s story any worse</text>
  <text start="1479.899" dur="3.931">than I already have let me just tell you</text>
  <text start="1481.85" dur="4.77">that the this to sum it all up</text>
  <text start="1483.83" dur="5.76">he says the FBI came to him to get after</text>
  <text start="1486.62" dur="5.34">President Trump and Marco Rubio Ted Cruz</text>
  <text start="1489.59" dur="4.949">and Hillary Clinton but what he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1491.96" dur="4.14">seem to explain is or what he seems to</text>
  <text start="1494.539" dur="3.21">tell in his story which is what the the</text>
  <text start="1496.1" dur="4.59">really fishy part is that the anton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1497.749" dur="5.91">are kind of picking apart is he says all</text>
  <text start="1500.69" dur="4.859">this stuff that he wanted to they wanted</text>
  <text start="1503.659" dur="4.581">him to go after after Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1505.549" dur="5.7">and then they asked him to stop and then</text>
  <text start="1508.24" dur="5.049">he said he described this lady they were</text>
  <text start="1511.249" dur="4.05">letting this lady this Russian lady</text>
  <text start="1513.289" dur="5.37">infiltrated all these big Democrat</text>
  <text start="1515.299" dur="5.911">Republican circles so that they could</text>
  <text start="1518.659" dur="5.01">later use that as the predicate for the</text>
  <text start="1521.21" dur="4.169">Russia collusion hoax investigation so</text>
  <text start="1523.669" dur="5.58">what they were doing was they were</text>
  <text start="1525.379" dur="6.42">knowingly allowing this Russian agent to</text>
  <text start="1529.249" dur="4.62">infiltrate Republican circles so that</text>
  <text start="1531.799" dur="4.801">later if President Trump were elected</text>
  <text start="1533.869" dur="3.961">they could then go and say look he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1536.6" dur="3.179">Russian agent and start this whole</text>
  <text start="1537.83" dur="3.99">Russia collusion hoax thing that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1539.779" dur="3.78">best way I could sum it up you can watch</text>
  <text start="1541.82" dur="3.929">he says he&amp;#39;s gonna put out a blog post</text>
  <text start="1543.559" dur="4.47">about it here one of the Anton&amp;#39;s had an</text>
  <text start="1545.749" dur="4.321">interesting take on it saying so his</text>
  <text start="1548.029" dur="4.081">story is completely fishy and he acts</text>
  <text start="1550.07" dur="4.979">like he&amp;#39;s kind of crazy he&amp;#39;s telling a</text>
  <text start="1552.11" dur="4.5">fantastic story the kind of the kind</text>
  <text start="1555.049" dur="4.021">that folks on the right are inclined to</text>
  <text start="1556.61" dur="4.769">love to hear to really eat it up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1559.07" dur="4.589">more likely he&amp;#39;s a tool and op and up</text>
  <text start="1561.379" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s intended to make all the claims</text>
  <text start="1563.659" dur="2.791">against deep state look ludicrous in the</text>
  <text start="1565.369" dur="3.15">mind of the public eye</text>
  <text start="1566.45" dur="3.87">this Bern thing will blow up and will be</text>
  <text start="1568.519" dur="3.35">exposed to be a big con from a guy</text>
  <text start="1570.32" dur="2.849">that&amp;#39;s basically crazy and after</text>
  <text start="1571.869" dur="3.25">self-aggrandizement</text>
  <text start="1573.169" dur="3.99">and purposefully working and purposely</text>
  <text start="1575.119" dur="4.26">working on behalf of the cual as a tool</text>
  <text start="1577.159" dur="4.59">then the MSM will pour it on about how</text>
  <text start="1579.379" dur="3.99">all these wild lurid tales of the</text>
  <text start="1581.749" dur="2.88">malfeasance of the deep state and their</text>
  <text start="1583.369" dur="3.721">fellow conspirators are utterly</text>
  <text start="1584.629" dur="3.931">ridiculous the product of crazy people</text>
  <text start="1587.09" dur="4.23">like Patrick Byrne</text>
  <text start="1588.56" dur="5.16">this is how they roll now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="1591.32" dur="4.53">this is the truth because it could all</text>
  <text start="1593.72" dur="3.96">come out that he&amp;#39;s telling the full</text>
  <text start="1595.85" dur="3.48">truth about what happened and in all</text>
  <text start="1597.68" dur="4.02">likelihood it wasn&amp;#39;t surprise me one bit</text>
  <text start="1599.33" dur="5.4">the names that he&amp;#39;s continuing to name</text>
  <text start="1601.7" dur="5.82">are people like Peter struck and Andrew</text>
  <text start="1604.73" dur="3.99">McCabe and bill priest and all of the</text>
  <text start="1607.52" dur="3.24">people we&amp;#39;ve seen in the queue and on</text>
  <text start="1608.72" dur="4.92">post but a few of things that strike me</text>
  <text start="1610.76" dur="4.65">as fishy first of all when he comes out</text>
  <text start="1613.64" dur="4.5">and says that they were trying to set up</text>
  <text start="1615.41" dur="5.46">Hillary Clinton what did occur to me</text>
  <text start="1618.14" dur="4.2">though is he says over and over again</text>
  <text start="1620.87" dur="3.9">that the men in black or these are</text>
  <text start="1622.34" dur="4.05">supposedly the agents who were tasked</text>
  <text start="1624.77" dur="3.9">with coming to him and making that</text>
  <text start="1626.39" dur="4.95">connection between him and Peter struck</text>
  <text start="1628.67" dur="6.68">and and subsequently Pete James Comey</text>
  <text start="1631.34" dur="4.01">and the rest that they were very very</text>
  <text start="1635.86" dur="5.11">against what was happening they were</text>
  <text start="1638.21" dur="4.41">giving the orders in according to him</text>
  <text start="1640.97" dur="2.79">and they were not very happy about it</text>
  <text start="1642.62" dur="3.11">and saying that he didn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1643.76" dur="4.53">cooperate and that they had never had</text>
  <text start="1645.73" dur="4.9">orders like this before where he was</text>
  <text start="1648.29" dur="4.98">being told to start a romantic</text>
  <text start="1650.63" dur="6.21">relationship in order to set up people</text>
  <text start="1653.27" dur="5.85">right so that one seemed kind of fishy</text>
  <text start="1656.84" dur="4.17">but maybe they you know maybe the top</text>
  <text start="1659.12" dur="5.49">brass knew they had to tell the the</text>
  <text start="1661.01" dur="5.52">lower henchmen the right things so that</text>
  <text start="1664.61" dur="3.54">it didn&amp;#39;t seem too obvious that they</text>
  <text start="1666.53" dur="3.69">were trying to set up President Trump</text>
  <text start="1668.15" dur="5.85">and not Hillary Clinton and to</text>
  <text start="1670.22" dur="5.16">effectively help Hillary Clinton and so</text>
  <text start="1674" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see what that</text>
  <text start="1675.38" dur="4.83">ends up being also the fact that he&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="1678.23" dur="4.5">all these major news networks like the</text>
  <text start="1680.21" dur="4.71">same on this day coming out and saying</text>
  <text start="1682.73" dur="5.25">all this stuff what was fascinating he</text>
  <text start="1684.92" dur="4.92">was on Chris Cuomo show on CNN and I</text>
  <text start="1687.98" dur="4.17">highly doubt that CNN would ever have</text>
  <text start="1689.84" dur="5.04">anybody on its airwaves who was all</text>
  <text start="1692.15" dur="4.77">about exposing the deep state so and you</text>
  <text start="1694.88" dur="3.96">could tell he had this weird tint you</text>
  <text start="1696.92" dur="4.95">know a new tinge to his story when he</text>
  <text start="1698.84" dur="4.59">was on Cuomo talking more about the way</text>
  <text start="1701.87" dur="3.66">that they were going after Hillary as</text>
  <text start="1703.43" dur="4.5">well and he makes it very clear that</text>
  <text start="1705.53" dur="3.66">he&amp;#39;s a Democrat liberal or he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1707.93" dur="3">you know I don&amp;#39;t think he said he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1709.19" dur="5">Democrat but he said he&amp;#39;s a he said he</text>
  <text start="1710.93" dur="5.91">calls himself like a hippie liberal so</text>
  <text start="1714.19" dur="6.18">this guy&amp;#39;s story needs to be vetted out</text>
  <text start="1716.84" dur="5.39">there&amp;#39;s a lot more to it and</text>
  <text start="1720.37" dur="3">I just can&amp;#39;t wait to see what happens I</text>
  <text start="1722.23" dur="3.18">mean I hope you guys have your popcorn</text>

  <text start="1732.82" dur="4.98">Patrick Byrne the CEO resigns from</text>
  <text start="1735.31" dur="5.82">overstock.com and as soon as he resigns</text>
  <text start="1737.8" dur="5.31">there is a huge surge in stock value now</text>
  <text start="1741.13" dur="3.93">that five or six percent there is a</text>
  <text start="1743.11" dur="4.83">pretty big bump especially for somebody</text>
  <text start="1745.06" dur="5.55">like the CEO who probably has very very</text>
