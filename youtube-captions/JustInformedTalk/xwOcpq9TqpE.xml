  <text start="130.039" dur="5.981">including one particular threat by very</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.65">good Twitter account talking about the</text>
  <text start="136.02" dur="5.82">different theories that could be</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="5.25">associated with Hurricane Dorian but</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="3.03">before we get into all that I always</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="3.36">encourage I want to come back here watch</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="5.04">these videos and share them on social</text>
  <text start="146.76" dur="5.01">media and why do I do that simple you</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="3.63">guys already know they are suppressing</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="4.73">this content and now they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="5.97">more aggressive and it seems like</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="5.17">YouTube doesn&amp;#39;t care in the run-up to</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="3.72">the 2020 election they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="3.45">get rid of all of us they&amp;#39;re gonna ban</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="4.59">everyone who has a voice that is</text>
  <text start="165.12" dur="5.43">dissenting to their agenda and that is</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="5.55">where we are at because as cues told us</text>
  <text start="170.55" dur="5.49">this is not a game these people have</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="5.76">everything on the line and they&amp;#39;re evil</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="4.35">so and and if you don&amp;#39;t believe me look</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="3.54">at the articles that are coming out</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="4.8">Google this is going to be the target of</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="5.789">a antitrust probe by a bunch of</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="6.12">different over 30 US state attorneys</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="5.851">general have come forward and are trying</text>
  <text start="191.31" dur="5.16">to lobby for a antitrust probe into</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="4.41">Google now why would you say why do they</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="5.64">need that well it&amp;#39;s simple Google is</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="7.32">acting as the the monopolies acted back</text>
  <text start="202.11" dur="6.81">in the early 19th century I mean literal</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="8.31">or the early 20th century they are</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="8.099">acting as the only game in town and</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="7.01">they&amp;#39;re crushing competition and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.019" dur="6.69">not allowing any one to come up in</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="4.689">competition to them and that is</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="5.401">dangerous for our society Google has</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="4.681">lost its original slogan of don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="229.11" dur="3.36">evil which you really have to have</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.2">suspicions about any company who has to</text>
  <text start="232.47" dur="4.049">make their mantra their motto don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="3.39">evil but then you really need to be</text>
  <text start="236.519" dur="4.53">suspicious when they decide to change</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="6">that and get rid of it so they are</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="6.321">acting not in good faith they&amp;#39;re acting</text>
  <text start="244.32" dur="5.04">in bad faith as bad faith actors in</text>
  <text start="247.37" dur="3.25">violating all types of different</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="3.18">agreements that they&amp;#39;ve made with the</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="3.99">government including section 230 of the</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="4.05">Communications Decency Act not to</text>

  <text start="256.59" dur="6.06">civil rights of people who use their</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="6.269">platforms and their repeated violations</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="4.69">of state local and federal laws in</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="4.361">several different</text>
  <text start="267.34" dur="5.25">instances as exhibited by project Vera</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="4.82">tosses that investigations which have</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="4.889">uncovered several instances of Google</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="5.349">actively working to violate things like</text>
  <text start="277.479" dur="5.151">I don&amp;#39;t know campaign finance laws with</text>
  <text start="280.449" dur="4.711">regard to how they game their search</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="5.28">algorithms in order to favor their</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="4.65">political candidate of their choice</text>
  <text start="287.91" dur="4.539">illegally because that&amp;#39;s an in-kind</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="5.37">donation in case nobody knows if you</text>
  <text start="292.449" dur="5.881">game your entire algorithm to favor one</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="5.34">person and to to disfavor another you</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="3.69">are giving an in-kind donation to that</text>
  <text start="300.52" dur="4.649">political candidate and that&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="5.61">of many many examples of how Google has</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="4.56">been a bad faith player from day one and</text>
  <text start="307.63" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re in cahoots with the Communist</text>
  <text start="309.729" dur="5.25">Chinese they could care less about our</text>
  <text start="312.01" dur="5.129">country they are trying to get to China</text>
  <text start="314.979" dur="4.5">away from us because they see that as</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="5.191">the biggest new emerging market where</text>
  <text start="319.479" dur="5.91">they can use these draconian Orwellian</text>
  <text start="322.33" dur="6.57">tactics at the behest of the Chinese</text>
  <text start="325.389" dur="5.4">Communist Party so that&amp;#39;s one story of</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="3.45">course you have Facebook they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="330.789" dur="3.75">about getting rid of the like button</text>
  <text start="332.35" dur="4.26">well now why would you want to get rid</text>
  <text start="334.539" dur="5.581">of the like button I wonder why you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="5.1">want to do that hmm perhaps they want to</text>
  <text start="340.12" dur="3.57">get rid of the like button or the</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="5.28">ability for people to see how many likes</text>
  <text start="343.69" dur="6">are on a video because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="5.01">you to know the actual number of likes</text>
  <text start="349.69" dur="4.199">so they can tell you what to like and</text>
  <text start="352" dur="4.11">they can tell you what&amp;#39;s popular and</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="4.231">they can tell you this was liked by a</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="6">lot of people just look at Twitter&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="6.12">trending page it&amp;#39;s a joke right all the</text>
  <text start="362.11" dur="3.84">stuff that&amp;#39;s trending is just handpicked</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="3.179">by the company and they go oh yeah</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="1.71">that&amp;#39;s definitely we should put that up</text>

  <text start="367.66" dur="4.08">oh it&amp;#39;s an anti-trump oh yeah put that</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="3.481">at number two on trending that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="4.5">literally how they work not to mention</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="7.019">the fact that YouTube is gonna go even</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="6.17">further into this banning of content</text>
  <text start="380.349" dur="4.111">that they don&amp;#39;t agree with and this</text>
  <text start="382.41" dur="4.78">completely arbitrary</text>

  <text start="410.05" dur="3.839">everyone else they&amp;#39;re all just gonna</text>
  <text start="412.09" dur="4.139">have to be taken off the platform</text>
  <text start="413.889" dur="4.321">summarily without any reason or</text>
  <text start="416.229" dur="3.961">explanation violating not only their</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="4.89">civil rights but as I&amp;#39;ve said violating</text>
  <text start="420.19" dur="4.49">federal law in local and state law in in</text>
  <text start="423.1" dur="5.25">the way that this is all an in-kind</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="6.13">political donation they want to silence</text>
  <text start="428.35" dur="5.129">people when did YouTube and Google and I</text>
  <text start="430.81" dur="4.77">hate to get so so you know into this but</text>
  <text start="433.479" dur="3.961">when did YouTube and Google become the</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="4.02">arbiter of truth morality and free</text>
  <text start="437.44" dur="4.92">speech and society when did they become</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="6.21">the supreme court of administering the</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="6.809">First Amendment when did they become the</text>
  <text start="445.81" dur="7.1">thought police because that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="449.169" dur="7.141">they&amp;#39;re acting and this is the Orwellian</text>
  <text start="452.91" dur="5.86">dystopic nightmare that we&amp;#39;re all headed</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="4.05">to and that brings me back here</text>
  <text start="458.77" dur="3.84">watch these videos share them get them</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="6.51">on your social media and that&amp;#39;s why you</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="7.14">should do that because ultimately they</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="4.97">are trying to silence any dissenting</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="5.039">opinion they&amp;#39;re trying to make their</text>

  <text start="478.84" dur="5.37">not when we know for a fact that they</text>
  <text start="481.45" dur="4.969">are liars and they are pushers and</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="4.95">proprietors of fake news and they are</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="5.47">completely complicit in the cover-up of</text>
  <text start="489.16" dur="6.27">the attempted coup of our president of</text>

  <text start="497.47" dur="4.47">thinking yourself okay this is just the</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="3.15">next evolution in this battle and if</text>
  <text start="501.94" dur="2.37">you&amp;#39;re scratching Google was killed on</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="3.45">the great awakening watch this video</text>
  <text start="504.31" dur="3.69">right here now we&amp;#39;re gonna get into a</text>
  <text start="506.47" dur="5.55">few stories but then when I get into the</text>
  <text start="508" dur="6.659">big story so first of all Ted Cruz has</text>
  <text start="512.02" dur="5.84">accepted a challenge to debate Alyssa</text>
  <text start="514.659" dur="7.32">Milano and this will be very interesting</text>
  <text start="517.86" dur="8.5">to just watch the debate go from a</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="7.201">fact-based argument into emotions and</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="5.49">how her life would have been so horrible</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="4.95">had she not been able to abort two</text>
  <text start="531.85" dur="7.66">children back in the 80s or whatever</text>
  <text start="534.13" dur="7.51">to me it&amp;#39;s almost like you can have this</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="4.8">debate I mean I&amp;#39;m all for debates I want</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="4.199">to have a conversation a dialogue but if</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="3.029">you look at the rhetoric rhetoric that</text>

  <text start="547.339" dur="3.961">you very quickly see that she&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="4.1">about gaslighting she&amp;#39;s not about</text>
  <text start="551.3" dur="4.05">fact-based arguments and she&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="3.64">misrepresenting and taking things out of</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="4.109">context so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="557.24" dur="5.76">how this debate goes but I&amp;#39;m sure I will</text>
  <text start="559.459" dur="5.341">watch it if it does happen Newt Gingrich</text>
  <text start="563" dur="3.779">just came out and said it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="5.31">that Obama and Loretta Lynch didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="566.779" dur="4.981">the FBI was spying on Trump well of</text>
