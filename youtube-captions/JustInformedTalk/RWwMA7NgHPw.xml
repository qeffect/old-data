  <text start="143.82" dur="3.66">channel today but primarily what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="145.74" dur="3.48">gonna do is focus on the main stories so</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="2.91">I always encourage everyone to come here</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="2.52">hit the subscribe button if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="150.39" dur="3.03">make sure you thoughtful notifications</text>
  <text start="151.74" dur="3.6">so you can notify when these videos get</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="4.47">posted and we always take a look over</text>
  <text start="155.34" dur="3.93">here at the keyboard still nothing three</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="3.63">five seven zeroes will be left off</text>
  <text start="159.27" dur="5.7">August first it&amp;#39;s been a little over a</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="6.12">month now and 8chan is coming back it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="4.56">just a matter of time and we&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="167.64" dur="3.93">for that to happen and then we may have</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="4.53">more q posts but in the meantime as</text>
  <text start="171.57" dur="4.44">always there is much more to cover as</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="3.75">far as breaking stories and the rest so</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that but first I</text>
  <text start="177.81" dur="3.18">always encourage everyone come back here</text>
  <text start="179.55" dur="3.24">watch these last videos share them on</text>
  <text start="180.99" dur="4.11">social media because we know there is an</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="5.16">algorithmic suppression at hand</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="4.38">YouTube Google Facebook Twitter and the</text>
  <text start="187.95" dur="3.84">rest are doing everything they can to</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="4.11">suppress the content that is created and</text>
  <text start="191.79" dur="4.47">pushed on channels like this and others</text>
  <text start="193.59" dur="5.52">because in their view it is going</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="5.16">against their control of the narrative</text>
  <text start="199.11" dur="3.75">so you have to come here watch these</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="3.66">videos share them on social media you</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="3.42">can get caught up and it&amp;#39;s a great way</text>
  <text start="205.08" dur="4.83">to kind of catch up to where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="5.76">Plus here also is the explanation if you</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="3.78">if you scratch it going what skewing on</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="3">you to watch this video gives you a lot</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="2.7">of information you should go check it</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="3.42">out what is cute on the Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="216.39" dur="3.45">so I recommend you do that share these</text>
  <text start="218.46" dur="3.6">on your social media and get the word</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="4.8">out that way so before we get started I</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="5.58">want to talk briefly about the rally</text>
  <text start="224.64" dur="4.71">that I attended in Washington DC I want</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="3.51">to just give you a few highlights about</text>
  <text start="229.35" dur="3.06">what happened there I met a lot of great</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="3.059">people we had a lot of great</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="3.9">conversations a lot of Patriots came</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="3.781">together to talk about queueing on the</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="4.23">Great Awakening what I thought was</text>
  <text start="237.99" dur="5.61">fascinating is a few things that happen</text>
  <text start="240.54" dur="6.59">apparently so the rally was an all-day</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="5.91">event there was one very very incredible</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="4.6">moment that I&amp;#39;m trying to find footage</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="4.83">of but it&amp;#39;s hard because I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="251.73" dur="4.47">anybody was expecting it so the Park</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="4.59">Service&amp;#39;s had a helicopter that arrived</text>
  <text start="256.2" dur="5.279">right near the Washington Monument where</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="4.11">we were set up we were set up about if I</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="5.761">had to guess it&amp;#39;s a hundred yards from</text>
  <text start="263.04" dur="6.36">the Washington Monument and wait a stage</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="4.89">we had a pretty you know decent crowd</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="5.01">and apparently that morning before I had</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="3.659">arrived because the speaking event was</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="2.7">supposed to start in the afternoon and</text>
  <text start="275.789" dur="5.071">they were just setting up in the morning</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="7.2">we had the people there at the event say</text>
  <text start="280.86" dur="5.179">that a helicopter came in and and I</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="4.02">can&amp;#39;t make this up since you know</text>
  <text start="286.039" dur="4.121">multiple people said this happened and</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="3.45">they witnessed it so I&amp;#39;m going off of</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="3.45">these eyewitness accounts I wasn&amp;#39;t there</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.53">but it sounds pretty interesting</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="4.92">that the Parkes helicopter service came</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="6.539">over and their helicopter actually went</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="8.22">in a circle and then made a dip over and</text>
  <text start="302.849" dur="4.801">it was the form of a queue that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="3.389">they&amp;#39;re telling me</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;m thinking okay just another wink and</text>
  <text start="310.139" dur="5.701">a nod we had a great day a lot of</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="6.06">speakers we had a great time we met some</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="4.29">interesting people we had a lot of fun</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="5.52">in DC and we got to come together and</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="4.529">celebrate this movement and to honor the</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="6.29">memory of those who had lost their lives</text>
  <text start="324.659" dur="7.23">in 9/11 so it was definitely a big event</text>

  <text start="446.78" dur="5.639">see you briefly sir and we had a good</text>
  <text start="450.139" dur="4.801">time so this was funny though they put a</text>
  <text start="452.419" dur="5.22">banner up over the the Houston debate</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="3.21">for the Democrats which said socialism</text>

  <text start="463.46" dur="2.61">we&amp;#39;re going through everything that</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re doing I&amp;#39;m telling it was a part of</text>
  <text start="466.07" dur="4.59">a bigger plan and it&amp;#39;s really coming</text>
  <text start="468.44" dur="4.08">together we just have to keep pushing it</text>
  <text start="470.66" dur="5.1">and we have to keep doing our part which</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="6.3">is exposing evil telling the truth as we</text>
  <text start="475.76" dur="4.83">know it and in in my case trying to</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="3.81">spread God&amp;#39;s Word as far and as wide as</text>
  <text start="480.59" dur="4.139">I can so this is an incredible movement</text>
  <text start="482.63" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m truly blessed to be a part of it now</text>
  <text start="484.729" dur="3.541">the US Attorney has recommended</text>
  <text start="486.5" dur="4.83">proceeding with charges against mchavez</text>
  <text start="488.27" dur="4.95">DOJ rejects the last-ditch appeal so</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="3.93">this is a big story that broke last</text>
  <text start="493.22" dur="3.9">night basically where this US attorney</text>
  <text start="495.26" dur="3.54">jesse was recommending that they move</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="3.9">forward with charges against Andrew</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="5.19">McCabe now Andrew McCabe&amp;#39;s lawyers shot</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="4.89">back today saying that no there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="503.99" dur="6.17">indication that any indictments have</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="9.119">been forwarded in the Andrew McCabe case</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="8.319">so there is a bit of a there&amp;#39;s a bit of</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="7.111">a disconnect between this statement from</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="6.061">Jesse Liu and what is actually happening</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="5.16">in reality but like we saw in the last Q</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="4.86">post we have to remember that even if we</text>
  <text start="527.3" dur="4.409">let go of little smaller charges such as</text>
  <text start="529.4" dur="3.39">lying or perjury which is a hard one to</text>
  <text start="531.709" dur="3.901">prove</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="5.28">that we have a much bigger case I mean</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="5.19">we do have the the goods on this whole</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="5.13">Russia collusion hoax how Comey McCabe</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="6.75">and and the rest were involved in</text>
  <text start="543.2" dur="6.27">setting up the spy gate hoax which was</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="4.64">used to try to attempt a coup on the</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="4.92">president so when Q says you know</text>
  <text start="552.19" dur="3.01">they&amp;#39;re not going to prosecute Comey or</text>
  <text start="554.39" dur="3.05">they come and say they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="555.2" dur="5.04">prosecute McCabe on these small</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="5.86">basically processed crimes you have to</text>
  <text start="560.24" dur="5.73">remember there&amp;#39;s a much bigger slam-dunk</text>
  <text start="563.3" dur="4.05">coming in my humble opinion but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="3.36">throwing it out there and letting you</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="4.29">guys kind of chew on that to see what</text>
  <text start="569.33" dur="5.1">you think of course this story goes on</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="4.35">talk about how he made misleading</text>

  <text start="915.63" dur="4.04">censorship is continuing to get worse</text>
  <text start="917.79" dur="4.32">and worse now this happened very</text>
  <text start="919.67" dur="5.8">interestingly there was a letter that</text>
  <text start="922.11" dur="8.44">was put together by US senators and sent</text>
  <text start="925.47" dur="9.16">to of course Facebook saying that it was</text>
  <text start="930.55" dur="6.74">long for them to disallow pro-abortion</text>

  <text start="937.29" dur="5.56">and you can&amp;#39;t make this up right here it</text>
  <text start="940.69" dur="4.05">is so what they did is following them</text>
  <text start="942.85" dur="4.65">the letter that was sent by US senators</text>
  <text start="944.74" dur="4.26">to Facebook they actually sent another</text>

  <text start="1195.419" dur="5.191">his prison cell apparently so</text>
  <text start="1197.58" dur="6.03">this changes the whole story - they</text>
  <text start="1200.61" dur="5.37">basically have come out and said that he</text>
  <text start="1203.61" dur="4.5">was not died in his actual jail cell he</text>
  <text start="1205.98" dur="4.32">was moved to another room where he ended</text>
  <text start="1208.11" dur="6.32">up dying and there&amp;#39;s been a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="1210.3" dur="7.2">of other theories out there that he was</text>
  <text start="1214.43" dur="5.83">basically all I know is this from what I</text>
  <text start="1217.5" dur="5.54">hear from people who I trust sources I</text>
  <text start="1220.26" dur="6.06">know is that he did not commit suicide</text>
  <text start="1223.04" dur="5.92">allegedly he was actually murdered now</text>
  <text start="1226.32" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a speculative statement</text>
  <text start="1228.96" dur="5.1">and I&amp;#39;m only saying it in regard to this</text>
  <text start="1231.18" dur="5.52">particular story with with the idea that</text>
  <text start="1234.06" dur="4.68">you know wherever it happened we know it</text>
  <text start="1236.7" dur="3.69">was not intentional he was told us it</text>
  <text start="1238.74" dur="3.96">probably wasn&amp;#39;t intentional when he said</text>
  <text start="1240.39" dur="4.38">that why would a man who is facing that</text>
  <text start="1242.7" dur="3.69">kind of who was about to hear back on</text>
  <text start="1244.77" dur="4.65">his appeal why would he commit suicide</text>
  <text start="1246.39" dur="4.89">before that appeal came back so another</text>
  <text start="1249.42" dur="4.11">you know that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="1251.28" dur="3.81">right so here we go Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1253.53" dur="3.87">mocking the u.s. from abroad and</text>
  <text start="1255.09" dur="3.66">taunting the House Republicans saying</text>
  <text start="1257.4" dur="3.63">that she found her emails here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1258.75" dur="6.48">actual tweet so she was at this place in</text>
  <text start="1261.03" dur="6.27">Venice and she literally there was a</text>
  <text start="1265.23" dur="4.05">replica of the resolute desk which is</text>
  <text start="1267.3" dur="5.57">the desk the president sits at in in the</text>
  <text start="1269.28" dur="6.03">White House in the whole office and she</text>
  <text start="1272.87" dur="6.58">can&amp;#39;t believe this but she sits down</text>
  <text start="1275.31" dur="6.3">with all of her emails and says someone</text>
  <text start="1279.45" dur="5.64">alert the House GOP I found my emails at</text>
  <text start="1281.61" dur="5.13">Venice BNL so when I first read this</text>
  <text start="1285.09" dur="3.24">obviously the first thing you think is</text>
  <text start="1286.74" dur="3.6">everything that Q is told us about the</text>
  <text start="1288.33" dur="4.35">way these people use Twitter as a forum</text>
  <text start="1290.34" dur="4.35">- as a way to send these these veiled</text>
  <text start="1292.68" dur="5.58">threats and coded messages out to their</text>
  <text start="1294.69" dur="4.68">their their co-conspirators and/or the</text>
  <text start="1298.26" dur="3.6">people who are there standing in</text>
  <text start="1299.37" dur="4.68">opposition toward and I believe in this</text>
  <text start="1301.86" dur="4.14">particular case there is definitely a</text>
  <text start="1304.05" dur="5.46">bigger message behind this there&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="1306" dur="5.73">mean to me what I think we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1309.51" dur="3.21">about here sits Italy so we know about</text>
  <text start="1311.73" dur="3.87">the Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="1312.72" dur="5.52">we know about the involvement on epstein</text>
  <text start="1315.6" dur="5.7">Island with the occult we know that</text>
  <text start="1318.24" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s obviously something to be said</text>
  <text start="1321.3" dur="5.81">for all the occultism and all the</text>
  <text start="1323.25" dur="8.16">satanic influences that they have</text>
  <text start="1327.11" dur="5.95">pushing them in my humble opinion but</text>
  <text start="1331.41" dur="3.72">with that being said when she gets up</text>
  <text start="1333.06" dur="4.35">there on president Trump&amp;#39;s desk a</text>
  <text start="1335.13" dur="5.67">replica of it and talks about her emails</text>
  <text start="1337.41" dur="7.08">from Italy now I know it&amp;#39;s Venice but</text>
  <text start="1340.8" dur="5.85">she&amp;#39;s in Italy right it could definitely</text>
  <text start="1344.49" dur="4.53">be suggested that there is something</text>
  <text start="1346.65" dur="4.26">going on with her and the Catholic</text>
  <text start="1349.02" dur="3.93">Church and trying to go against the</text>
  <text start="1350.91" dur="3.42">president and the House GOP this is a</text>
  <text start="1352.95" dur="4.53">tactic that they used interestingly</text>
  <text start="1354.33" dur="5.88">enough previously the Clintons were very</text>
  <text start="1357.48" dur="4.14">much known when Bill Clinton came under</text>
  <text start="1360.21" dur="5.04">investigation for the Monica Lewinsky</text>
  <text start="1361.62" dur="6.24">scandal the Democrats pushed by Hillary</text>
  <text start="1365.25" dur="4.83">Clinton and Bill and they&amp;#39;re their</text>
  <text start="1367.86" dur="4.71">minions created a scorched earth policy</text>
  <text start="1370.08" dur="4.86">where they went after every single GOP</text>
  <text start="1372.57" dur="4.74">Republican trying to show them to be</text>
  <text start="1374.94" dur="4.65">cheaters philanderers if they&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="1377.31" dur="4.86">even you know they did anything</text>
  <text start="1379.59" dur="4.62">basically as far as sexual immorality</text>
  <text start="1382.17" dur="5.64">goes that was the whole push they were</text>
  <text start="1384.21" dur="5.73">trying to legitimize President Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1387.81" dur="4.23">actions and minimize them in saying that</text>
  <text start="1389.94" dur="3.81">well look if you know you&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="1392.04" dur="3.45">mad at President Clinton for doing this</text>
  <text start="1393.75" dur="3.96">in the Oval Office you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="1395.49" dur="3.51">get mad at these GOP senators for what</text>
  <text start="1397.71" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;ve done or they cheated on their</text>
  <text start="1399" dur="1.71">wife and had to have a divorce or</text>
  <text start="1400.32" dur="2.67">whatever</text>
  <text start="1400.71" dur="4.47">now I&amp;#39;m not excusing any of that</text>
  <text start="1402.99" dur="3.63">behavior I think it&amp;#39;s disgusting and and</text>
  <text start="1405.18" dur="4.7">if people are gonna be exposed are gonna</text>
  <text start="1406.62" dur="5.58">be explores exposed but it was a form of</text>
  <text start="1409.88" dur="4.12">all-out warfare that they were</text>
  <text start="1412.2" dur="4.53">conducting it was a like I said a</text>
  <text start="1414" dur="4.02">scorched earth policy they said if they</text>
  <text start="1416.73" dur="3.18">were gonna go down they were gonna bring</text>
  <text start="1418.02" dur="3.9">everyone down with them and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1419.91" dur="3.9">exactly to this day I think what Hillary</text>
  <text start="1421.92" dur="3.87">Clinton is still trying to do and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1423.81" dur="5.04">trying to intimated I think that she</text>
  <text start="1425.79" dur="5.73">knows more about other people than they</text>
  <text start="1428.85" dur="4.56">could imagine and good for her because</text>
  <text start="1431.52" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;ve talked about different theories</text>
  <text start="1433.41" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s actually one different theory</text>
  <text start="1434.76" dur="5.19">out there about how you know on that day</text>
  <text start="1438.21" dur="4.2">after President front was elected that</text>
  <text start="1439.95" dur="5.16">she was actually picked up and shown</text>
  <text start="1442.41" dur="6.42">evidence and basically was arrested and</text>
  <text start="1445.11" dur="5.16">then released and even to this day she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1448.83" dur="4.5">still been under surveillance and</text>
  <text start="1450.27" dur="4.61">monitoring so it&amp;#39;s kind of a hard one to</text>
  <text start="1453.33" dur="3.66">believe considering she&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="1454.88" dur="5.83">jet-setting around the world every day</text>
  <text start="1456.99" dur="5.91">doing all these criminal excuse me not</text>
  <text start="1460.71" dur="6.44">criminal these</text>
  <text start="1462.9" dur="6.6">interesting in the in engagements and</text>
  <text start="1467.15" dur="4.39">obviously this is a message I think this</text>
  <text start="1469.5" dur="5.07">is a message is pointed directly at you</text>
  <text start="1471.54" dur="4.71">know who president Trump but here we go</text>
  <text start="1474.57" dur="2.97">first of all this was the one about</text>
  <text start="1476.25" dur="3">Jeffrey Epstein was talking about does</text>
  <text start="1477.54" dur="3.33">the person who fights hard for bail that</text>
  <text start="1479.25" dur="3.27">appeals the original decision attempt to</text>
  <text start="1480.87" dur="4.26">overturn time suicide prior to the</text>
  <text start="1482.52" dur="5.13">ruling of the appeal logical thinking</text>
  <text start="1485.13" dur="4.56">queue so we talked about suicide now</text>
  <text start="1487.65" dur="4.62">this story came out retired NYPD</text>
  <text start="1489.69" dur="4.71">sergeant forty-nine shoots himself dead</text>
  <text start="1492.27" dur="4.35">making him the 11th active or former</text>
  <text start="1494.4" dur="4.98">officer to take their own life this year</text>
  <text start="1496.62" dur="5.49">and it begs the question what Q has</text>
  <text start="1499.38" dur="4.83">asked us before about the NYPD first off</text>
  <text start="1502.11" dur="3.75">this was from Nate 15th where Q says did</text>
  <text start="1504.21" dur="4.8">you catch it the speech what NYPD</text>
  <text start="1505.86" dur="6.54">officer NB NYPD detectives for 187 in</text>
  <text start="1509.01" dur="5.669">mid 2017 officer familiar one</text>
  <text start="1512.4" dur="4.77">godspeed patriot we will never forget q</text>
  <text start="1514.679" dur="4.951">so we had this where President Trump</text>
  <text start="1517.17" dur="4.59">went and did a speech with the NYPD and</text>
  <text start="1519.63" dur="5.82">he spoke directly to officer familias</text>
  <text start="1521.76" dur="5.94">family and we talked about did these</text>
  <text start="1525.45" dur="4.59">individuals see the insurance file and</text>
  <text start="1527.7" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s the question q ass here in the</text>
  <text start="1530.04" dur="3.84">previous post where an Anton says the</text>
  <text start="1532.2" dur="3.54">stuff about the NYPD isn&amp;#39;t just coming</text>
  <text start="1533.88" dur="3.45">out I&amp;#39;d heard about that during the</text>
  <text start="1535.74" dur="3.48">campaign but maybe the public wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1537.33" dur="4.14">ready for it yet no one wanted to</text>
  <text start="1539.22" dur="4.74">believe it then so it says fine the two</text>
  <text start="1541.47" dur="4.92">NYPD detectives wanted seven mid-2017</text>
  <text start="1543.96" dur="6.48">did they view the insurance file threats</text>
  <text start="1546.39" dur="5.94">are real this is not a game q so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1550.44" dur="4.17">talked to sources who tell me basically</text>
  <text start="1552.33" dur="5.28">this that there is a high probability</text>
  <text start="1554.61" dur="4.23">that that a lot of the NYPD officers no</text>
  <text start="1557.61" dur="3.15">I&amp;#39;m not say I&amp;#39;m just saying this is a</text>
  <text start="1558.84" dur="3.9">speculative statement but that the the</text>
  <text start="1560.76" dur="4.23">NYPD officers who we&amp;#39;re seeing lose</text>
  <text start="1562.74" dur="4.08">their lives may have some connection to</text>
  <text start="1564.99" dur="3.15">what was found on that insurance file</text>
  <text start="1566.82" dur="2.94">and if you&amp;#39;re scheduled what is that</text>
  <text start="1568.14" dur="4.289">insurance file we&amp;#39;re talking about a</text>
  <text start="1569.76" dur="5.1">file that allegedly existed on the</text>
  <text start="1572.429" dur="5.581">seized laptop of Anthony Weiner that</text>
  <text start="1574.86" dur="5.43">several New York PD detectives and a few</text>

  <text start="1580.29" dur="6.6">law enforcement federal law enforcement</text>
  <text start="1583.08" dur="9.21">were able to actually see now this file</text>
  <text start="1586.89" dur="9.12">alleged marked insurance was full of</text>
  <text start="1592.29" dur="10.16">damning evidence political blackmail</text>
  <text start="1596.01" dur="9.419">allegedly videos of sexually you know of</text>
  <text start="1602.45" dur="6.189">compromising sexual activities among</text>
  <text start="1605.429" dur="5.431">high-ranking individuals so the theory</text>
  <text start="1608.639" dur="5.241">is that everyone associated involved</text>
  <text start="1610.86" dur="5.73">with this video and watching it has</text>
  <text start="1613.88" dur="7.45">mysteriously been losing their lives</text>
  <text start="1616.59" dur="7.26">since 2017 so that&amp;#39;s the theory I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1621.33" dur="5.13">giving it to you guys to chew on not to</text>
  <text start="1623.85" dur="4.38">mention just after that the head of</text>
  <text start="1626.46" dur="3.78">mental health services at University of</text>
  <text start="1628.23" dur="3.75">Pennsylvania has died by suicide which I</text>
  <text start="1630.24" dur="4.11">just thought was an interesting story as</text>
  <text start="1631.98" dur="5.13">it first of all these the head of mental</text>
  <text start="1634.35" dur="4.829">health services did a major university</text>
  <text start="1637.11" dur="4.049">and then he goes and commits suicide so</text>
  <text start="1639.179" dur="4.291">obviously there may be more to that</text>
  <text start="1641.159" dur="6.36">story but also what we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="1643.47" dur="5.85">with Q about how mind control and</text>
  <text start="1647.519" dur="4.38">MKULTRA and the rest I mean we have</text>
  <text start="1649.32" dur="5.43">evidence about that that came out in the</text>
  <text start="1651.899" dur="5.721">70s about project MKULTRA and QS told us</text>
  <text start="1654.75" dur="6.48">how now the intelligence agencies use</text>
