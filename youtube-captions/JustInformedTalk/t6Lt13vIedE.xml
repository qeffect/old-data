  <text start="210.739" dur="5.37">Facebook is now going to be the arbiters</text>
  <text start="213.59" dur="6.92">of truth and morality in society and it</text>
  <text start="216.109" dur="7.651">is disgusting to watch these corrupt</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="4.869">authoritarian fascists sit there and lie</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.5">through their teeth on Capitol Hill</text>

  <text start="240.53" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re what they deemed to be offensive</text>
  <text start="241.94" dur="4.2">and non offensive this is really a big</text>
  <text start="244.46" dur="3.72">problem for our society at large and</text>
  <text start="246.14" dur="3.96">watching Mark Zuckerberg testify today</text>

  <text start="250.1" dur="5.1">of him discussing his new cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="4.619">Libre which I mean the more I watched</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="3.9">you know Mark Zuckerberg the more I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="4.351">pretty convinced that he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="259.1" dur="5.28">basically some kind of cardboard stamp</text>
  <text start="261.59" dur="6.24">cutout Bond villain that was created by</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="6.69">these created by the the government that</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="5.88">is now trying to harness him back in and</text>
  <text start="271.07" dur="4.26">he&amp;#39;s like some evil guy you know he only</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="4.05">needs is one of those twirly mustaches</text>

  <text start="277.76" dur="5.43">sure he would be great in one of those</text>
  <text start="279.86" dur="5.64">roles but this is really it&amp;#39;s not a joke</text>
  <text start="283.19" dur="4.229">right you have facebook removing it</text>
  <text start="285.5" dur="4.35">whole pages you know millions and</text>
  <text start="287.419" dur="4.321">millions of people from having the</text>
  <text start="289.85" dur="3.27">ability to to participate in the</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="5.4">national dialogue and they&amp;#39;re doing all</text>
  <text start="293.12" dur="6">this systematically bit by bit as we go</text>
  <text start="297.14" dur="3.75">into the 2020 election that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="3.18">have to keep calling this out for what</text>
  <text start="300.89" dur="3.54">it is and that&amp;#39;s why i start with this</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="4.41">story because it&amp;#39;s relevant to what was</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="4.17">happening on Capitol Hill today with the</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="5.39">testimony of Mark Zuckerberg and the way</text>
  <text start="308.6" dur="6.569">that you know there used to be a</text>
  <text start="312.1" dur="4.93">standard for free speech and there was</text>
  <text start="315.169" dur="4.411">an established standard that was set in</text>
  <text start="317.03" dur="4.41">the Supreme Court and now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="3.99">seeing is these big are these big tech</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="5.91">companies who have decided that now they</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="6.36">control so much of the you know dialogue</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="4.65">that is in our political discourse in</text>
  <text start="329.93" dur="4.77">America and but they have no</text>
  <text start="332" dur="4.4">accountability to the rule of law and if</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="3.93">you notice something one of the most</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="5.14">telling things is when you hear Mark</text>
  <text start="338.63" dur="4.89">Zuckerberg use phrases like freedom of</text>
  <text start="341.54" dur="3.9">expression instead of freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s a big difference between freedom</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="4.44">of expression and freedom of speech and</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="5.43">in the United States you are entitled to</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="4.68">freedom of speech it&amp;#39;s not freedom of</text>
  <text start="352.58" dur="4.53">expression as is outlined in the</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="4.83">European Constitution and all that the</text>

  <text start="361.79" dur="5.67">100% different and Facebook is</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="5.94">continually continually along with other</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="5.459">big tech companies violating our freedom</text>

  <text start="381.56" dur="4.889">protections in the Constitution and the</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="5.25">Bill of Rights and it&amp;#39;s fundamentally</text>
  <text start="386.449" dur="4.02">got to change and we have to keep on top</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="4.7">of this which is why I bring it up now</text>

  <text start="440.9" dur="4.65">they weaponize that information in order</text>
  <text start="443.419" dur="4.231">to control the public and control the</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="4.459">masses and to predict the future and to</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="7.5">enrich themselves but never mind that</text>
  <text start="450.009" dur="7.66">let&amp;#39;s see February 4 2004 well guess</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="6.96">what what day was Facebook founded Oh</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="7.831">February 4 2004 hmm what a coincidence</text>

  <text start="467.87" dur="4.889">that is being pushed by that the</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="6.089">intelligence community and you know look</text>
  <text start="472.759" dur="4.921">at this point we all know what Facebook</text>
  <text start="476.419" dur="3.481">is and everybody has submitted</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="4.769">themselves to it basically voluntarily</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="6.359">but we have to have it work within the</text>
  <text start="482.449" dur="6.661">realm of law right constitutional rights</text>
  <text start="486.259" dur="4.68">matter and and when people like Mark</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="3.72">Zuckerberg who think that they&amp;#39;re above</text>
  <text start="490.939" dur="4.561">the law and that they are the arbiters</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="4.41">of truth and morality take that into</text>
  <text start="495.5" dur="3.689">their own hands and start you know</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="3.959">coming against the American people and</text>
  <text start="499.189" dur="5.371">trying to meddle in our elections right</text>
  <text start="501.199" dur="5.731">this has got to be addressed and I only</text>
  <text start="504.56" dur="3.689">say this because this is going to play a</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="3.029">huge part in the 2020</text>
  <text start="508.249" dur="3.991">nobody&amp;#39;s really talking about it yet but</text>
  <text start="509.959" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s gonna become very pronounced very</text>
  <text start="512.24" dur="4.199">so let&amp;#39;s get into this Donald Trump here</text>

  <text start="545" dur="4.92">them all and this kind of harkens back</text>
  <text start="547.43" dur="4.969">to something that I think that that we</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="5.25">all have to remember right you know how</text>
  <text start="552.399" dur="4.87">Senator Lindsey Graham and John McCain</text>

  <text start="851.18" dur="3.75">that are revealing that the Obama</text>

  <text start="869.99" dur="5.22">very interesting guests on here in the</text>
  <text start="872.69" dur="5.01">next day or two and I&amp;#39;m hoping to</text>
  <text start="875.21" dur="4.41">integrate them a little bit into the</text>
  <text start="877.7" dur="3.36">show to kind of give you an idea of the</text>
  <text start="879.62" dur="2.969">kind of information that the people are</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="4.2">coming forward to me with that I want to</text>
  <text start="882.589" dur="4.801">share with you but these are people I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="885.26" dur="4.47">been working with for a while and they</text>
  <text start="887.39" dur="5.61">are some of the the primary figures in</text>
  <text start="889.73" dur="5.28">this Benghazi situation they were the</text>
  <text start="893" dur="4.589">the soldiers the the the men who were</text>
  <text start="895.01" dur="4.68">there on the ground when this happened</text>
  <text start="897.589" dur="3.75">who saw that there was in action that</text>
  <text start="899.69" dur="3.84">there was basically a stand down order</text>
  <text start="901.339" dur="3.721">and that everything was known they knew</text>
  <text start="903.53" dur="2.67">about the terrorists they knew about the</text>
  <text start="905.06" dur="2.88">weapons smuggling</text>
  <text start="906.2" dur="3.06">and the cachet I should say they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="907.94" dur="3">know about this phony but they knew we</text>
  <text start="909.26" dur="3.6">were doing it and they knew what was</text>
  <text start="910.94" dur="3.27">happening and these are the people I</text>
  <text start="912.86" dur="5.34">want to just give you an idea of what</text>
  <text start="914.21" dur="6.03">they are about and here you go so tell</text>
  <text start="918.2" dur="5.43">me a little bit about you know September</text>
  <text start="920.24" dur="26.85">11th 2012 where were you what did you</text>
  <text start="923.63" dur="26.85">see that day you know what happened what</text>
  <text start="947.09" dur="7.08">everything it was some time after it</text>
  <text start="950.48" dur="12.51">started we on the floor we had the feed</text>
  <text start="954.17" dur="11.22">the predator feed and that ladies and</text>
  <text start="962.99" dur="4.23">gentlemen is just a preview of what&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="965.39" dur="3.99">come tomorrow where we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="967.22" dur="4.77">these full interviews with people who</text>
  <text start="969.38" dur="6.03">were there that day who knew that there</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="4.8">was something not right and these are</text>
  <text start="975.41" dur="3.06">people in the command structure I should</text>
  <text start="976.79" dur="4.11">be clear they weren&amp;#39;t on the ground in</text>
  <text start="978.47" dur="4.8">Benghazi but they were in the command</text>
  <text start="980.9" dur="5.16">structure they were working in the</text>
  <text start="983.27" dur="5.37">operation centers where these missions</text>
  <text start="986.06" dur="5.4">were being coordinated from and there</text>
  <text start="988.64" dur="5.1">was a lack of an effort to stop what</text>
  <text start="991.46" dur="3.87">happened that day it seems according to</text>
  <text start="993.74" dur="3.81">these individuals who are coming forward</text>
  <text start="995.33" dur="3.93">and I think that&amp;#39;s what Judicial Watch</text>
  <text start="997.55" dur="4.44">is picking up on they&amp;#39;re picking up on</text>
  <text start="999.26" dur="4.65">the fact that there was an intent by the</text>
  <text start="1001.99" dur="4.11">Obama administration to basically turn a</text>
  <text start="1003.91" dur="4.14">blind eye to what was happening there</text>
  <text start="1006.1" dur="5.19">that day and does that connect even</text>
  <text start="1008.05" dur="6">further to how weapons were basically</text>
  <text start="1011.29" dur="5.76">finding their way into the hands of Isis</text>
  <text start="1014.05" dur="5.4">terrorists that were supposedly going to</text>
  <text start="1017.05" dur="4.89">be going to the quote-unquote Syrian</text>
  <text start="1019.45" dur="4.59">rebels who we were backing in this</text>
  <text start="1021.94" dur="4.38">conflict that made no sense from the</text>
  <text start="1024.04" dur="5.28">beginning which only makes sense now</text>
  <text start="1026.32" dur="6.54">seeing how President Trump has worked so</text>
  <text start="1029.32" dur="4.97">hard to get us out of it so that I think</text>
  <text start="1032.86" dur="4.349">is an important point and you guys</text>
  <text start="1034.29" dur="4.12">definitely should stick around and keep</text>
  <text start="1037.209" dur="2.701">checking on the channel because we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1050.23" dur="5.699">like like a retirement for you know they</text>
  <text start="1053.169" dur="4.591">never expected that President Trump was</text>
  <text start="1055.929" dur="4.141">going to release the transcript of the</text>
  <text start="1057.76" dur="4.98">phone call they understood that</text>
  <text start="1060.07" dur="4.32">everything that they were gonna do was</text>
  <text start="1062.74" dur="4.17">gonna lead them to have another Russia</text>
  <text start="1064.39" dur="5.55">collusion for two years they could use</text>
  <text start="1066.91" dur="4.139">to not only try to undo the 2016</text>
