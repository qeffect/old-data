  <text start="137.219" dur="3.6">post yet we&amp;#39;re waiting and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re coming but with that I like to</text>
  <text start="140.819" dur="3.93">remind everybody come back here watch</text>
  <text start="142.829" dur="3.961">these last few videos why because there</text>
  <text start="144.749" dur="4.561">is a Content suppression algorithm in</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="4.83">full force going on with these big tech</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="4.11">companies and they are trying to</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="4.5">suppress this information they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="4.679">to block your ability to get access to</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="4.679">it and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep it away</text>
  <text start="158.099" dur="5.01">from people who really need to hear this</text>
  <text start="160.799" dur="6.961">which in my opinion is one of the</text>
  <text start="163.109" dur="6.931">biggest violations of our individual</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="5.58">rights but then also of more broadly</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="5.159">their pledge to be an open speech</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="3.39">platform when they become a publisher</text>
  <text start="175.199" dur="3.391">they start going into different</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="3.929">territory and then it gets an FEC laws</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="4.17">and I just really think that these</text>
  <text start="180.659" dur="4.41">people think they are more powerful than</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="3.78">the US government itself which is really</text>
  <text start="185.069" dur="3.03">disturbing but that&amp;#39;s why I asked you</text>

  <text start="276.55" dur="4.41">I want to start by talking about</text>
  <text start="278.11" dur="5.1">YouTube&amp;#39;s new terms of service they have</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="4.86">kicked into effect apparently today or</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="6.39">yesterday depending where you are and I</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="5.85">got a message on my inside my studio app</text>
  <text start="289.6" dur="4.44">which is on the back end that you guys</text>
  <text start="291.67" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t see in YouTube and it told me</text>
  <text start="294.04" dur="5.28">basically that they&amp;#39;re going to take a</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="4.41">bigger stance against hate and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="4.65">gonna start censoring more I mean that</text>
  <text start="301.06" dur="4.59">was the general gist of it right and a</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="3.96">lot of people coming on YouTube saying</text>
  <text start="305.65" dur="3.66">you know and even I&amp;#39;ve been one of the</text>
  <text start="307.93" dur="3.24">people saying like they&amp;#39;ve lost their</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="3.42">way but if you look at it traditionally</text>
  <text start="311.17" dur="2.49">YouTube was something totally different</text>
  <text start="312.73" dur="2.73">than it is today</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="4.32">and if you take into account everything</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="4.65">that we&amp;#39;ve learned up till this point we</text>
  <text start="317.98" dur="5.01">know what YouTube has planned all along</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.32">right I did a whole thread here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="3.51">gonna encourage you guys to go check out</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="3.96">my Twitter to find this I did a thread</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="4.32">basically re explaining what we already</text>
  <text start="328.39" dur="4.5">know the the google internal Doc&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="4.34">released about the good sensor and how</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re pushing for more of a</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="4.63">european-style interpretation of free</text>
  <text start="337.66" dur="3.39">speech and and they&amp;#39;re pushing more for</text>
  <text start="339.79" dur="3.87">free expression which is an</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="5.52">anti-american concept in its in its</text>
  <text start="343.66" dur="5.94">foundation because it&amp;#39;s based on the</text>
  <text start="346.57" dur="5.34">premise that in order to provide an open</text>
  <text start="349.6" dur="5.81">and and safe space for everyone to have</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="6.21">the ability to talk you are actually</text>
  <text start="355.41" dur="8.22">obligated to silence and censor people</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="8.55">who present opinions which are you know</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="6.57">divisive or controversial and that</text>
  <text start="366.67" dur="6.33">ultimately is the first steps into</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="4.63">totalitarianism and authoritarianism and</text>
  <text start="373" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s what these big tech companies are</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="4.47">pushing for that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re in bed</text>
  <text start="377.17" dur="4.23">with the left because the left want to</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="4.83">be authoritarians just as much as the</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="4.86">big tech sensor elites want to as well</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="4.65">so you have to take into consideration</text>
  <text start="386.26" dur="4.35">that they&amp;#39;ve told us what was going to</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="4.89">happen they talked about how you know</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="6">the tech firms are in this impossible</text>
  <text start="393.67" dur="6.41">position right and then they talk about</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="6.26">how you know they load us into this</text>
  <text start="400.08" dur="4.41">of giving them all of their our business</text>
  <text start="402.87" dur="2.91">because they said you know we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="404.49" dur="4.109">about free speech we&amp;#39;re all about</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="5.699">unbiased and accurate free access to</text>
  <text start="408.599" dur="5.97">information and we really just want more</text>
  <text start="411.479" dur="6.06">honesty and transparent dialogue but in</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="5.521">the reality of the way they practice</text>
  <text start="417.539" dur="6.451">their businesses or the way they</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="5.91">actually execute their mandates within</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="7.049">their businesses I should say they have</text>
  <text start="426" dur="8.129">decided to as it points out here shift</text>
  <text start="431.039" dur="4.951">towards censorship right and this is a</text>
  <text start="434.129" dur="4.26">from the document the good censor you</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="5.429">guys can read this and they&amp;#39;ve finally</text>
  <text start="438.389" dur="6.96">decided that they want to push for more</text>
  <text start="441.419" dur="6.661">of a politicized editorial and publisher</text>
  <text start="445.349" dur="5.431">type role as opposed to a free speech</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="4.86">platform because they unilaterally</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="5.249">decided that they are the the arbiters</text>
  <text start="452.94" dur="5.939">of morality and goodness the same people</text>
  <text start="456.029" dur="4.26">who you know support ideals and</text>
  <text start="458.879" dur="3.6">principles which are completely</text>
  <text start="460.289" dur="4.38">antithetical to most of America I would</text>
  <text start="462.479" dur="4.711">say you know or at least the 63 million</text>
  <text start="464.669" dur="4.201">people who voted for President Trump or</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="3.36">the millions and millions of Christians</text>
  <text start="468.87" dur="5.299">who live in this country because they</text>
  <text start="470.55" dur="7.47">openly promote things like teenagers who</text>
  <text start="474.169" dur="5.761">glorify Satanism or uh you know other</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="4.829">individual influencers who promote</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="5.019">socialism now it&amp;#39;s fine for them to be</text>
  <text start="482.849" dur="4.29">endorsing those things on their own I</text>
  <text start="484.949" dur="4.981">guess as individuals because that is a</text>
  <text start="487.139" dur="7.74">part of what free speech really is but I</text>
  <text start="489.93" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t want to see it on a being</text>
  <text start="494.879" dur="4.611">implemented I guess I should say on a</text>
  <text start="496.44" dur="5.789">broad level by these major institutions</text>
  <text start="499.49" dur="6.099">corporations which actually have a</text>
  <text start="502.229" dur="5.91">monopoly on things like digital</text>
  <text start="505.589" dur="4.92">information such as Google on YouTube</text>
  <text start="508.139" dur="5.94">and Facebook which is like this the</text>
  <text start="510.509" dur="7.32">social media mecca or Twitter which is</text>
  <text start="514.079" dur="5.88">like in one of the freest forms of</text>
  <text start="517.829" dur="3.63">expression really when you can get on</text>
  <text start="519.959" dur="3.12">and have a conversation with anyone in</text>
  <text start="521.459" dur="4.141">the world about anything and give your</text>
  <text start="523.079" dur="4.921">thoughts no matter what these companies</text>
  <text start="525.6" dur="4.32">have decide unilaterally that they are</text>
  <text start="528" dur="5.05">better than us that they know better</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="5.26">than us that they and what&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="3.3">more fascinating and you guys should go</text>

  <text start="586.99" dur="6.06">narrative and it&amp;#39;s all a form of command</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="6">and control and these people are sick</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="5.909">authoritarians and to me ultimately</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re not asking for this to be a</text>
  <text start="598.959" dur="5.451">left-right paradigm shift you know a</text>
  <text start="601.39" dur="6.9">thing as much as we&amp;#39;re just asking for</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="5.619">equality and freedom of speech and not</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="4.32">to embrace a european-style</text>
  <text start="610.029" dur="4.741">which believes in principles which are</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="3.63">antithetical to our constitutional</text>

  <text start="616.24" dur="5.969">which we are given through the First</text>

  <text start="654.04" dur="4.88">here and then we&amp;#39;ll watch FYI we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="663.579" dur="3.221">here&amp;#39;s a big story that came out from</text>
  <text start="665.529" dur="3.25">the Gateway pundit today</text>
  <text start="666.8" dur="4.14">talking about this op-ed written by Eric</text>
  <text start="668.779" dur="4.231">Holder you know who Eric Holder is the</text>
  <text start="670.94" dur="4.89">former attorney general under Obama</text>
  <text start="673.01" dur="4.71">right who was a part of a lot of these</text>
  <text start="675.83" dur="3.42">things like fast and furious and a lot</text>
  <text start="677.72" dur="4.88">of these things that happen around the</text>
  <text start="679.25" dur="6.6">Clinton era as far as malfeasance and</text>
  <text start="682.6" dur="5.77">corruption and criminal treason in my</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="4.56">opinion with people selling us out to</text>
  <text start="688.37" dur="5.82">foreign entities foreign nationals and</text>
  <text start="690.41" dur="5.97">the like so with that this story here</text>
  <text start="694.19" dur="4.079">goes into this op-ed written by of</text>
  <text start="696.38" dur="4.079">course as we talked to said just before</text>
  <text start="698.269" dur="4.5">Attorney General the former attorney</text>
  <text start="700.459" dur="5.851">General Eric Holder and basically the</text>
  <text start="702.769" dur="6.32">the some of this story is he is casting</text>
  <text start="706.31" dur="4.86">dispersion upon John Durham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="709.089" dur="3.731">investigation which is happening right</text>
  <text start="711.17" dur="4.229">now and you&amp;#39;re gonna watch these clips</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;m going to show you of in attorney</text>
  <text start="715.399" dur="5.101">general Barr explaining that John</text>
  <text start="717.56" dur="5.1">Durham&amp;#39;s investigation is a further</text>
  <text start="720.5" dur="4.44">investigation into the things uncovered</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="4.98">through the IG report and reminding us</text>
  <text start="724.94" dur="5.67">in this interview that the IG really has</text>
  <text start="727.64" dur="4.77">no prosecutorial power it was merely an</text>
  <text start="730.61" dur="3.12">observational thing where he had to just</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="3.96">interview people working within the</text>
  <text start="733.73" dur="5.549">agencies right but ultimately this says</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="5.159">that you know John Durham is is</text>
  <text start="739.279" dur="5.581">conducting a witch-hunt and then it</text>
  <text start="741.529" dur="5.401">basically sums up with general attorney</text>
  <text start="744.86" dur="4.74">general william bars unfit to lead the</text>
  <text start="746.93" dur="4.5">Justice Department so ultimately it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="749.6" dur="3.87">the same thing as the op-ed that was put</text>
  <text start="751.43" dur="4.05">out by James Comey which we covered in</text>
  <text start="753.47" dur="3.27">the last video if you guys remember this</text>
  <text start="755.48" dur="2.84">video right here where we talk about</text>
  <text start="756.74" dur="4.62">corny coms</text>
  <text start="758.32" dur="5.8">yeah interesting to really watch closely</text>
  <text start="761.36" dur="4.229">because we talked about this exact same</text>
  <text start="764.12" dur="3.39">thing through the the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="765.589" dur="4.651">op-ed put up by James Comey where he</text>
  <text start="767.51" dur="4.59">says basically you know I didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="770.24" dur="3.659">anything wrong and this I G report</text>
  <text start="772.1" dur="3.63">completely vindicates me when it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="773.899" dur="4.861">completely couldn&amp;#39;t be further from the</text>
  <text start="775.73" dur="4.5">truth there right so that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="778.76" dur="4.98">not to mention if you go back this is</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="5.969">like 2017 October of 2017 Jim shooter</text>
  <text start="783.74" dur="4.11">reporting CNN once again Trump&amp;#39;s claim</text>
  <text start="786.199" dur="3.421">the dossier is discredited has been</text>
  <text start="787.85" dur="4.2">discredited in fact USM tell us</text>
  <text start="789.62" dur="5.73">corroborated portions so you had CNN</text>
  <text start="792.05" dur="6">lying to us at the time 2017 probably</text>
  <text start="795.35" dur="4.4">still today telling us that all the</text>
  <text start="798.05" dur="4.4">information in the steal report was come</text>
  <text start="799.75" dur="4.56">corroborated or partial or corroborated</text>
  <text start="802.45" dur="4.65">and poor in part by the intelligence</text>
  <text start="804.31" dur="4.05">community when in fact as you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="2.75">with what I&amp;#39;m going to show you the clip</text>
  <text start="808.36" dur="3.84">from attorney general bar</text>
  <text start="809.85" dur="3.58">they were corroborating the fact that</text>
  <text start="812.2" dur="2.97">the people they were talking to were</text>
  <text start="813.43" dur="3.81">truthful in saying that the steel</text>
  <text start="815.17" dur="4.77">dossier was fake so I want you guys to</text>
  <text start="817.24" dur="5.01">go ahead and just watch the clip I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="819.94" dur="4.05">about to show you this is a few clips of</text>
  <text start="822.25" dur="4.08">a Attorney General William bar</text>
  <text start="823.99" dur="4.08">explaining what actually happened with</text>
  <text start="826.33" dur="3.06">this dossier and it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="828.07" dur="1.77">you guys are gonna want to check this</text>
  <text start="829.39" dur="3.03">out</text>
  <text start="829.84" dur="4.8">but you know so far is it still do you</text>
  <text start="832.42" dur="4.2">still stand by your statement that the</text>
  <text start="834.64" dur="4.47">campaign was spied upon</text>
  <text start="836.62" dur="4.65">looks clearly spied upon I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="839.11" dur="4.32">what electronic surveillance is I think</text>
  <text start="841.27" dur="3.87">wiring people up to go in and talk to</text>
  <text start="843.43" dur="4.41">people and make recordings of their</text>
  <text start="845.14" dur="4.65">conversations is spying I think going</text>
  <text start="847.84" dur="3.99">through people&amp;#39;s emails which they did</text>
  <text start="849.79" dur="3.57">as a result of the FISA warrant they</text>
  <text start="851.83" dur="4.11">went through everything you know from</text>
  <text start="853.36" dur="3.99">from pages life he wasn&amp;#39;t in the</text>
  <text start="855.94" dur="3.99">campaign at the point where nobody in</text>
  <text start="857.35" dur="4.5">the survey yes but his emails were go</text>
  <text start="859.93" dur="4.89">back I mean the main reason they were</text>
  <text start="861.85" dur="5.4">going for the FISA warrant initially was</text>
  <text start="864.82" dur="5.519">to go back historically and seize all</text>
  <text start="867.25" dur="7.83">his emails and texts and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="870.339" dur="6.571">from back months and even years so they</text>
  <text start="875.08" dur="3.63">were covering the period that he was in</text>
  <text start="876.91" dur="3.33">the campaign and that&amp;#39;s exactly the</text>
  <text start="878.71" dur="4.53">reason they went for the FISA to get</text>
  <text start="880.24" dur="5.31">that stuff but also a few weeks ago I</text>
  <text start="883.24" dur="4.08">told him that he should spend just as</text>
  <text start="885.55" dur="5.13">much attention on the post-election</text>
  <text start="887.32" dur="5.79">period and I did that because of some of</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="4.47">the stuff that Horowitz is uncovered</text>
  <text start="893.11" dur="4.02">which to me is an explicit that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.15" dur="4.08">applicable well what I said is their</text>
  <text start="897.13" dur="4.56">case collapsed after the election and</text>
  <text start="899.23" dur="4.38">they never told the court and they kept</text>
  <text start="901.69" dur="4.59">on getting renewals on these</text>
  <text start="903.61" dur="4.95">applications they those documents</text>
  <text start="906.28" dur="4.94">falsified in order to get these renewals</text>
  <text start="908.56" dur="4.759">there was all kinds of</text>
  <text start="911.22" dur="6.75">withholding of information from the</text>
  <text start="913.319" dur="6.57">court and the question really is what</text>
  <text start="917.97" dur="4.08">was the agenda after the election that</text>
  <text start="919.889" dur="4.051">kept them pressing ahead after their</text>
  <text start="922.05" dur="6.839">case collapsed this is the President of</text>
  <text start="923.94" dur="8.069">the United States but in one area I do</text>
  <text start="928.889" dur="5.521">disagree with the IG and that was</text>
  <text start="932.009" dur="6.5">whether there was sufficient predication</text>
  <text start="934.41" dur="6.539">to open a full-blown counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="938.509" dur="5.411">investigation specifically using the</text>
  <text start="940.949" dur="5.481">techniques that they did to collect</text>
  <text start="943.92" dur="6.359">intelligence about the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="946.43" dur="6.37">well well as a policy matter why why not</text>
  <text start="950.279" dur="3.901">open an investigation on a thin pretext</text>
  <text start="952.8" dur="3.18">I guess on the one hand you could say</text>
  <text start="954.18" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s a presidential campaign it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="955.98" dur="3.33">sensitive you need better at evidence on</text>
  <text start="957.72" dur="3.239">the other hand you could say it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="959.31" dur="4.019">presidential campaign we have to be very</text>
  <text start="960.959" dur="4.98">careful there could be a threat to our</text>
  <text start="963.329" dur="4.95">political process well I think I think</text>
  <text start="965.939" dur="6.09">probably from a civil liberties</text>
  <text start="968.279" dur="6.781">standpoint the greatest danger to our</text>
  <text start="972.029" dur="5.31">free system is that the incumbent</text>
  <text start="975.06" dur="4.29">government used the apparatus of the</text>
  <text start="977.339" dur="4.31">state principally the law enforcement</text>
  <text start="979.35" dur="5.37">agencies and the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="981.649" dur="5.411">both to spy on political opponents but</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="5.13">also to use them in a way that could</text>
  <text start="987.06" dur="4.5">affect the outcome of the election as</text>
  <text start="989.85" dur="4.2">far as I&amp;#39;m aware this is the first time</text>
  <text start="991.56" dur="5.61">in history that this has been done to a</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="5.519">presidential campaign the use of these</text>
  <text start="997.17" dur="4.83">counterintelligence techniques against a</text>
  <text start="999.569" dur="3.781">presidential campaign and we have to</text>
  <text start="1002" dur="4.23">remember and in today&amp;#39;s world</text>
  <text start="1003.35" dur="5.58">presidential campaigns are frequently in</text>
  <text start="1006.23" dur="5.4">contact with foreign persons and indeed</text>
  <text start="1008.93" dur="6.329">in most campaigns there are signs of</text>
  <text start="1011.63" dur="6.149">illegal foreign money coming in and we</text>
  <text start="1015.259" dur="5.7">don&amp;#39;t automatically assume that the</text>
  <text start="1017.779" dur="4.8">campaigns are nefarious and traitors and</text>
  <text start="1020.959" dur="4.441">acting and league with foreign powers</text>
  <text start="1022.579" dur="5.701">there has to be some basis before we use</text>
  <text start="1025.4" dur="6.929">these very potent powers in our core</text>
  <text start="1028.28" dur="7.139">First Amendment activity and here I felt</text>
  <text start="1032.329" dur="4.98">this was very flimsy basically I think</text>
  <text start="1035.419" dur="5.701">the Department has a rule of reason</text>
  <text start="1037.309" dur="5.231">which is at the end of the day is what</text>
  <text start="1041.12" dur="5.049">you&amp;#39;re relying on</text>
  <text start="1042.54" dur="7.71">sufficiently powerful to justify the</text>
  <text start="1046.169" dur="6.661">techniques you&amp;#39;re using and the question</text>
  <text start="1050.25" dur="4.65">there is how strong is the evidence how</text>
  <text start="1052.83" dur="5.04">sensitive is the activity you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="1054.9" dur="5.22">at and what are the alternatives and I</text>
  <text start="1057.87" dur="5.85">think when you step back here and say</text>
  <text start="1060.12" dur="7.799">what was this all based on it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1063.72" dur="6.66">sufficient so in May 2016</text>
  <text start="1067.919" dur="4.711">apparently a 28 year old violent</text>

  <text start="1077.37" dur="6.03">described by the foreign official who</text>
  <text start="1080.52" dur="4.62">heard him as who couldn&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="1083.4" dur="4.29">exactly what was said but it was</text>
  <text start="1085.14" dur="6.3">characterized as a suggestion of a</text>
  <text start="1087.69" dur="6.39">suggestion he suggested that there had</text>
  <text start="1091.44" dur="4.77">been a suggestion from the Russians that</text>
  <text start="1094.08" dur="3.9">they had some adverse information to</text>
  <text start="1096.21" dur="4.23">Hillary which they might dump in the</text>
  <text start="1097.98" dur="4.59">campaign well what was going on in May</text>
  <text start="1100.44" dur="3.72">you may recall that we were in the thick</text>
  <text start="1102.57" dur="5.19">of the investigation of Hillary</text>
  <text start="1104.16" dur="6.389">Clinton&amp;#39;s secret server and the media</text>
  <text start="1107.76" dur="4.71">was full of stories and the blogosphere</text>
  <text start="1110.549" dur="4.5">was full of stories and political</text>
  <text start="1112.47" dur="5.25">circles in Washington were full of</text>

  <text start="1117.72" dur="6.66">Russians had in 2014 two years before</text>
  <text start="1121.23" dur="5.04">hacked into her secret server and were</text>
  <text start="1124.38" dur="4.56">therefore in a position to drop this</text>

  <text start="1128.94" dur="8.85">day before this comment was made in a</text>
  <text start="1133.14" dur="6.06">bar Fox News was reporting that their</text>
  <text start="1137.79" dur="4.17">sources told them there was a debate</text>

  <text start="1875.61" dur="5.91">patience we have faith we know God is</text>
  <text start="1879.45" dur="4.35">there and we put our faith in God and as</text>
  <text start="1881.52" dur="4.98">it says there the Lord&amp;#39;s coming is near</text>
  <text start="1883.8" dur="5.55">you don&amp;#39;t know the day the time the hour</text>

  <text start="1889.35" dur="5.88">happen nothing in this life is promised</text>
  <text start="1891.84" dur="5.46">except that we have been given this a</text>
  <text start="1895.23" dur="3.6">great gift of eternal salvation through</text>
  <text start="1897.3" dur="3.92">our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so</text>
  <text start="1898.83" dur="6.12">temper yourself with patience and</text>

  <text start="1930.77" dur="5.4">time it may never happen on our time but</text>
  <text start="1933.59" dur="5.16">if we put our faith in God we can trust</text>
  <text start="1936.17" dur="5.19">that God wins and that good will prevail</text>
  <text start="1938.75" dur="4.23">over evil and that no matter what we</text>
  <text start="1941.36" dur="4.26">will not have worked in vain because we</text>
  <text start="1942.98" dur="5.16">put our lives to something bigger than</text>
  <text start="1945.62" dur="4.68">ourselves and that&amp;#39;s really ultimately</text>
