  <text start="245.25" dur="4.35">what did you learn from today while I</text>
  <text start="247.77" dur="3.6">read through the indictment Brian there</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="4.02">are a couple of key takeaways number one</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="4.199">as Charlie said he&amp;#39;s absolutely correct</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s clear as day now there are two</text>
  <text start="255.569" dur="3.811">parallel tracks and the sad part is</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="3.24">these tracks are starting there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="3.33">cross contamination going on here</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="4.41">here&amp;#39;s track number one that has</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="5.22">bipartisan agreement we all agree the</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="4.11">Russians are not our friends they tried</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="3.75">to tamper with the election the</text>
  <text start="269.7" dur="4.08">indictment is very detailed and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.68" dur="4.62">very substantive it details a</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="5.88">spearfishing operation by Russian GRU</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="5.49">members to try to steal data from some</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="3.69">Democrats and infiltrate some potential</text>
  <text start="281.79" dur="3.36">Republicans and the lobbyists and</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="3.6">members of the press that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re all in agreement the Russians are</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="4.95">not our friends the problem is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="4.35">no collusion Brian we&amp;#39;ve been told for</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="3.72">what almost two years now</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="4.47">that somehow Trump colluded with the</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="3.93">Russians or his team members to Alton</text>
  <text start="297.9" dur="3.96">alter the results of the election and</text>
  <text start="299.55" dur="4.8">there is still absolutely zero evidence</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="4.05">of that whatsoever and it is bogging</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="3.78">down our political process so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="3.36">big call among some leadership some of</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="2.73">the leadership on the Democratic side</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="3.209">for the president in light of this</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="4.63">information to not meet with a lot of</text>
  <text start="312.479" dur="4.991">your boot would that be a good move dead</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="3.87">and now why should he not mean with him</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="4.229">you know I don&amp;#39;t understand I never get</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="4.47">I can&amp;#39;t figure out Democrats for the</text>
  <text start="321.699" dur="4.201">life you know they debate themselves all</text>
  <text start="323.83" dur="4.11">the time on issues they had absolutely</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="4.169">no problem this is not what about ISM</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="4.319">it&amp;#39;s about principles right when Barack</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="4.201">Obama met with uh went with Cuban</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="4.291">representatives down in Cuba they had no</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="3.81">issue with that but now we know Donald</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="4.769">Trump has information he can confront</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="3.899">Putin with about documented Soviet</text>
  <text start="341.319" dur="2.22">military</text>
  <text start="341.979" dur="3.09">excuse me Russian military members</text>
  <text start="343.539" dur="3.63">excuse me that will talk about a</text>
  <text start="345.069" dur="4.141">Freudian slip right trying to infiltrate</text>
  <text start="347.169" dur="4.021">our election process and they want him</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="3.54">to call off the meeting that&amp;#39;s absurd</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous this is actually the</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="3.87">perfect opportunity to hit Putin on it</text>
  <text start="354.97" dur="3.74">do you believe damn Bungie know that</text>
  <text start="356.62" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to get in this midterm</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="5.2">of course I mean these are this is our</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="4.05">main geopolitical foe I mean this is a</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="3.45">nuclear powered nation that&amp;#39;s figured</text>
  <text start="365.71" dur="3.959">out along to gun a time ago that if they</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="3.989">can so domestic chaos they can drip the</text>
  <text start="369.669" dur="3.451">United States apart from within and</text>
  <text start="371.349" dur="3.481">that&amp;#39;s the problem Brian I have with</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="3.81">these parallel tracks there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="4.17">credible investigation and this garbage</text>
  <text start="376.93" dur="4.049">Trump Russian collusion investigation</text>
  <text start="379" dur="4.02">which it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a house of sand</text>
  <text start="380.979" dur="3.961">there&amp;#39;s nothing there the Democrats need</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="3.72">to just let this thing go and focus on</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="3.33">the real enemy which is the Russian part</text>
