  <text start="272.3" dur="4.53">about houses talking about before us and</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s talking about the election what</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="5.49">they did during the election was a</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="4.56">disgrace he&amp;#39;s probably never happened in</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="3.06">our country before and that&amp;#39;s just a tip</text>
  <text start="284" dur="3.77">of the iceberg what&amp;#39;s gonna happen when</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="6.45">we go further and there was total bias</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="7.87">total bias what you&amp;#39;ve seen so far James</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="7.649">Comey be locked up I would never want to</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="5.91">get involved in that certainly they just</text>
  <text start="299.479" dur="6.841">seem like very criminal acts to me what</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="7.53">he did was criminal what he did was it</text>
  <text start="306.32" dur="5.34">was so bad in terms of our Constitution</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="5.43">in terms of well-being of our country</text>
  <text start="311.66" dur="4.319">what he did was should he be locked up</text>
  <text start="314.51" dur="3.48">to let somebody make a determination</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="4.081">look at all the dishonest things that</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="5.16">crooked Hillary did look at look at what</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s very sad sounds like he</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="3.21">was in a private email - he had a</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="4.92">private emails that was of all the</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="5.13">things that wasn&amp;#39;t to me maybe the most</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="3.949">interesting but it was probably the</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="2.239">funniest</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="7.26">the surprise I have to say from what we</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="4.259">see those regarding the IG report it</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="2.789">sounds like homie made some bad</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="4.261">judgments but nothing criminal</text>
  <text start="346.659" dur="4.201">well if you look at what happened and</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t forget all of these people like</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="6.41">struck what he did was criminal struck</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="5.669">and so many others became this bias they</text>
  <text start="357.27" dur="3.73">knew everything that was going then you</text>
  <text start="359.349" dur="3.931">think the kid didn&amp;#39;t tell him everything</text>
  <text start="361" dur="3.659">became talked everything became is a</text>
  <text start="363.28" dur="3.689">criminal right now</text>
  <text start="364.659" dur="4.081">and now he the derivatives justice and</text>
  <text start="366.969" dur="4.141">he&amp;#39;s now so again it&amp;#39;s a total mess</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="4.829">they&amp;#39;re all going against each other now</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="4.669">I think Comey was the ringleader of this</text>

  <text start="452.78" dur="5.73">this during the morning President Trump</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="4.89">just walked right on down as Fox &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="458.51" dur="5.58">Friends was conducting the show live</text>
  <text start="460.7" dur="6.8">from the White House lawn and gave an</text>
  <text start="464.09" dur="5.91">impromptu 30-minute interview it was</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="3.97">incredible I tried there there was a lot</text>

  <text start="472.82" dur="8.099">it it&amp;#39;s all over the internet but that</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="6.81">was a cut together of what I think the</text>
  <text start="480.919" dur="5.25">most important things related to the</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="5.31">inspector general&amp;#39;s report were being</text>
  <text start="486.169" dur="3.961">addressed by President Trump in that</text>
  <text start="488.09" dur="4.889">interview and as you saw in that</text>
  <text start="490.13" dur="6.48">interview he called basically Comey the</text>
  <text start="492.979" dur="6.331">scum of the FBI at the top the scum at</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="4.8">the top of the FBI he accused Comey</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="6.27">James Comey the former director of deaf</text>
  <text start="501.41" dur="7.41">guy as her for running a supposed den of</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="6.33">thieves amazing the strength in that</text>
  <text start="508.82" dur="6.45">phrase to say that he was in charge of a</text>
  <text start="511.91" dur="4.679">den of thieves at the FBI now what could</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="3.87">that be referencing well there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="516.589" dur="3.901">things we&amp;#39;re going to get into and a</text>
  <text start="519.14" dur="3.019">part of those comments that were</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="4.89">basically given by President Trump</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="5.471">impromptu this morning and an impromptu</text>
  <text start="525.38" dur="4.62">30 minute interview a part of those</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="4.26">comments covers exactly all the things</text>
  <text start="530" dur="5.22">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about FBI the</text>
  <text start="531.89" dur="6.51">Peter stroke lisa page tax the findings</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="4.95">of the inspector general&amp;#39;s report what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.4" dur="5.85">going on with the Mueller investigation</text>
  <text start="540.17" dur="7.41">and director Comey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="5.76">basic criminal actions all these things</text>
  <text start="547.58" dur="4.26">were covered pretty succinctly by the</text>
  <text start="550.01" dur="3.51">president but what&amp;#39;s important to note</text>
  <text start="551.84" dur="3.09">is that there are so many people out</text>
  <text start="553.52" dur="4.35">there I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of comments saying</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="6.06">oh that the Inspector General&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="5.31">is just another nothing burger and again</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="6.3">once again no big arrests are being made</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="6.3">and so on and so forth and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="3.68">point out this and this is an Anton who</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="4.62">posted something that I thought really</text>
  <text start="570.97" dur="4.66">warrants us taking a second look at so</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="3.21">here let&amp;#39;s read through it I want to</text>
  <text start="575.63" dur="4.86">give credit to whoever this is a nom</text>
  <text start="577.31" dur="5.49">they know who wrote it I don&amp;#39;t it says I</text>
  <text start="580.49" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t get the inflated expectations of</text>
  <text start="582.8" dur="4.47">this inspector general report release</text>
  <text start="585.02" dur="4.8">among Anton&amp;#39;s didn&amp;#39;t Q say that it would</text>
  <text start="587.27" dur="5.04">be a rod Rosenstein version and not the</text>
  <text start="589.82" dur="4.8">full report why would POTUS need to sign</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="4.53">an executive order declassifying info if</text>
  <text start="594.62" dur="4.89">this was going to have all the major</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="5.1">bombs in it if this watered-down report</text>
  <text start="599.51" dur="4.47">wasn&amp;#39;t expected then why would Trump</text>
  <text start="601.94" dur="6.66">preemptively sign the Executive Order if</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="7.05">all this is a part of movie and optics</text>
  <text start="608.6" dur="5.76">of Independence for the various actors</text>
  <text start="611.03" dur="5.31">is the objective of the movie then why</text>
  <text start="614.36" dur="5.79">wouldn&amp;#39;t you understand that Ray has a</text>
  <text start="616.34" dur="6.45">specific part to play logic is what is</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="4.35">needed here and yet it is what is solat</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="3.42">is so sorely lacking</text>
  <text start="624.5" dur="4.23">Anton&amp;#39;s need to understand that because</text>
  <text start="626.21" dur="5.28">we don&amp;#39;t control the media that the</text>
  <text start="628.73" dur="5.1">POTUS administration has to be careful</text>
  <text start="631.49" dur="3.96">what ammunition they give them everyone</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="3.81">involved in this investigation must</text>
  <text start="635.45" dur="4.32">retain their independence objectivity</text>
  <text start="637.64" dur="5.55">and credibility for this to make it to</text>
  <text start="639.77" dur="5.76">trial and end with actual convictions</text>
  <text start="643.19" dur="5.55">the reason we are important here at Q</text>
  <text start="645.53" dur="5.25">research at all is for our ability to</text>
  <text start="648.74" dur="4.53">understand this info and ultimately</text>
  <text start="650.78" dur="4.8">spread it to other people we have to</text>
  <text start="653.27" dur="4.95">sway public opinion where we can media</text>
  <text start="655.58" dur="5.1">is our direct counterpart it is they we</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="5.34">are battling public opinion on social</text>
  <text start="660.68" dur="6.51">media is that is the target that both us</text>
  <text start="663.56" dur="5.85">are battling for and saying reread the</text>
  <text start="667.19" dur="5.28">last two months of Q posts and sharpen</text>
  <text start="669.41" dur="4.98">up your logic imagine just how you would</text>
  <text start="672.47" dur="3.81">make it make this all happen if you were</text>
  <text start="674.39" dur="3.27">POTUS with vicious media at your heels</text>
  <text start="676.28" dur="4.56">and snakes and the rinks</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="5.16">of Washington imagine how you would get</text>
  <text start="680.84" dur="4.11">the necessary people indicted arrested</text>
  <text start="682.82" dur="4.65">and tried while retaining a semblance of</text>

  <text start="744.31" dur="6.43">I think that their points about exactly</text>
  <text start="748.49" dur="4.56">what&amp;#39;s going on it is are very valid</text>
  <text start="750.74" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re here to steer public opinion we</text>
  <text start="753.05" dur="6.12">have the ability to get people on our</text>
  <text start="755.48" dur="5.76">side and that&amp;#39;s the basically the</text>
  <text start="759.17" dur="5.49">capacity for all of us to be persuasive</text>
  <text start="761.24" dur="5.91">because we&amp;#39;re were people who have</text>
  <text start="764.66" dur="4.56">strong convictions because we see facts</text>
  <text start="767.15" dur="4.25">and we see logic and we see rationality</text>
  <text start="769.22" dur="5.37">and we say that makes sense to me</text>
  <text start="771.4" dur="5.68">and this anton&amp;#39;s basically laying out</text>
  <text start="774.59" dur="4.71">that this is all a part of the script</text>
  <text start="777.08" dur="4.17">and cue warned us he told us that it</text>
  <text start="779.3" dur="3.87">would be redacted and Rosenstein version</text>
  <text start="781.25" dur="3.42">which I said yesterday in my video and I</text>
  <text start="783.17" dur="6.48">thought it was important to hear again</text>
  <text start="784.67" dur="8.97">here and not only that that this is all</text>
  <text start="789.65" dur="5.64">about maintaining the investigators</text>
  <text start="793.64" dur="3.87">independence objectivity and credibility</text>
  <text start="795.29" dur="3.69">as they anton puts here that&amp;#39;s got to be</text>
  <text start="797.51" dur="3.45">the most thing the most important thing</text>
  <text start="798.98" dur="5.34">especially if we truly want people to be</text>
  <text start="800.96" dur="10.499">convicted at trial because if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="804.32" dur="9.629">even a shred of or an iota of doubt</text>
  <text start="811.459" dur="3.841">that they are that the ones who are</text>
  <text start="813.949" dur="3.18">administering these laws and</text>
  <text start="815.3" dur="3.69">administering these investigations and</text>
  <text start="817.129" dur="3.3">bringing these indictments don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="818.99" dur="4.68">independence and objectivity and</text>
  <text start="820.429" dur="5.19">credibility then it can basically</text>
  <text start="823.67" dur="4.139">undermine the whole investigation the</text>
  <text start="825.619" dur="4.171">whole trial and people can walk away</text>
  <text start="827.809" dur="4.111">freemen because of that free men and</text>
  <text start="829.79" dur="5.37">women who should be facing consequences</text>
  <text start="831.92" dur="4.469">for their actions so ok that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="835.16" dur="4.619">Anton&amp;#39;s putting out there and I think</text>
  <text start="836.389" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s a pretty valid point and we need to</text>
  <text start="839.779" dur="4.131">stay on top of it so that&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="841.369" dur="5.16">just something I wanted to mention first</text>
  <text start="843.91" dur="5.83">now a couple things that really stood</text>
  <text start="846.529" dur="5.881">out to me we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about Anthony</text>

  <text start="856.279" dur="2.881">inspector general&amp;#39;s report so you guys</text>
  <text start="857.72" dur="3.75">should stick around because they&amp;#39;re I</text>

  <text start="866.329" dur="3.74">watered it down and made it seem like oh</text>
  <text start="868.22" dur="4.109">it&amp;#39;s not politically motivated well</text>
  <text start="870.069" dur="4.38">regardless of the political motivations</text>
  <text start="872.329" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s crimes that are obviously being</text>
  <text start="874.449" dur="4.12">suggested of being committed and then</text>
  <text start="876.829" dur="3.211">they say at the end oh but there is no</text>
  <text start="878.569" dur="3.661">evidence to point that there was</text>
  <text start="880.04" dur="5.849">criminal intent or that there&amp;#39;s anything</text>
  <text start="882.23" dur="6.81">that was you know any politically</text>

  <text start="1083.95" dur="5.04">president Trump I mean I understand he</text>
  <text start="1087.519" dur="3.89">worked on his campaign but the crime</text>

  <text start="1568.23" dur="2.819">they&amp;#39;d save it in the drafts and then</text>
