  <text start="166.609" dur="3.21">standing up for what&amp;#39;s right and queues</text>
  <text start="168.439" dur="3.571">pointing it out and you know they have</text>
  <text start="169.819" dur="3.661">these crazy threats before the rally so</text>
  <text start="172.01" dur="5.039">the Secret Service can&amp;#39;t let people in</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="5.129">with that stuff on but you know what god</text>
  <text start="177.049" dur="3.72">bless each and every one of you showing</text>
  <text start="178.609" dur="4.681">up in force and doing what&amp;#39;s great and</text>
  <text start="180.769" dur="4.47">that says VIP Patriots so we may here</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="3.75">see them throughout the evening they may</text>
  <text start="185.239" dur="4.17">get pointed to you never know this is</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="4.169">how Q works sometimes people like that</text>
  <text start="189.409" dur="3.78">will just get pointed out and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="4.2">picked out and crowd but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="193.189" dur="3.961">wait and see it says quota R it says in</text>
  <text start="195.409" dur="6.121">the metaphorical kill box which is this</text>
  <text start="197.15" dur="6.089">bold brackets here so they call in</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="4.289">threats prior to each rally in an effort</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="5.821">to diminish reach for of our message or</text>
  <text start="205.819" dur="5.76">up message all four alarm when one shirt</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="6">is not enough to becomes the solution q</text>
  <text start="211.579" dur="7.34">so basically I think what&amp;#39;s just saying</text>
  <text start="215.06" dur="6.359">is that these shirts are really becoming</text>
  <text start="218.919" dur="3.671">indicative of how they&amp;#39;re trying to stop</text>
  <text start="221.419" dur="2.46">us they&amp;#39;re trying to stop the message</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="3.149">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop the signage</text>
  <text start="223.879" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re calling it in as a threat and</text>
  <text start="225.739" dur="6.631">it&amp;#39;s basically preventing people from</text>
  <text start="227.989" dur="6.93">allowing them in and I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="3.899">that when we see something later it</text>
  <text start="234.919" dur="3.841">might make a little more sense when one</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="4.34">shirt is enough - becomes a solution or</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="3.929">is not enough to become a solution as an</text>
  <text start="240.609" dur="3.701">president trouble point - - people</text>
  <text start="242.689" dur="4.11">accuse shirts or give some sort of</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="4.799">little signal I don&amp;#39;t know but that&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="3.96">for you guys now the next one now this</text>

  <text start="394.53" dur="5.59">the unfortunate part at least a guy like</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="7">Kanye actually has the the gall in the</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="5.22">the ability to admit what the truth is</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="4.14">that we are making America great again</text>

  <text start="416.56" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;ll build factories here will create</text>
  <text start="418.389" dur="4.231">jobs and will truly abolish the</text>
  <text start="421.36" dur="5.16">Thirteenth Amendment what does he mean</text>
  <text start="422.62" dur="7.17">by that it means the 13th the 13th</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="5.52">amendment was basically what abolish</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="6.96">slavery but inside of that it actually</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="7.499">says you know originally it said that it</text>
  <text start="436.75" dur="5.82">is illegal to have slavery unless you</text>
  <text start="439.539" dur="6.051">are basically imprisoned and prisons do</text>
  <text start="442.57" dur="4.92">basically have the right to wage</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="3.76">individuals under slave labor which is</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="4.26">why we have this whole corporate prison</text>
  <text start="449.35" dur="4.379">system in our country right and they use</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="3.72">slave labor to basically I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="462.07" dur="5.969">for a month or a year and that though is</text>
  <text start="465.46" dur="5.91">what is being pointed out to us right</text>
  <text start="468.039" dur="5.821">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s basically saying that Kanye</text>
  <text start="471.37" dur="5.79">wants a greater America for everyone</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="6.989">just like we all do we don&amp;#39;t want to see</text>

  <text start="598.02" dur="3.09">this one&amp;#39;s interesting because I had</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="3.63">originally thought from this post which</text>

  <text start="746.12" dur="3.57">the big deal here well first of all when</text>
  <text start="747.83" dur="5.34">John Perry&amp;#39;s Barlow&amp;#39;s name was first</text>
  <text start="749.69" dur="5.46">dropped on Q back on January 27 2008 een</text>
  <text start="753.17" dur="4.95">nobody really thought much of it but</text>
  <text start="755.15" dur="6.54">then shortly after that I think on</text>
  <text start="758.12" dur="7.38">February 8th of 2018 so approximately a</text>

  <text start="775.12" dur="4.18">you know natural cause I think it was a</text>
  <text start="777.47" dur="5.49">heart attack or something that he ended</text>
  <text start="779.3" dur="5.46">up dying of and but it was about a week</text>
  <text start="782.96" dur="4.7">there about ten days after this post was</text>
  <text start="784.76" dur="5.76">made now why is that important well</text>
  <text start="787.66" dur="4.99">let&amp;#39;s understand what that what Q is</text>
  <text start="790.52" dur="3.51">trying to get at here with this now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="792.65" dur="3.45">read this a million different ways and</text>
  <text start="794.03" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty much shaping up to look</text>
  <text start="796.1" dur="7.62">like John Perry Barlow was a voice that</text>
  <text start="799.55" dur="6.45">techno corporate elite they definitely</text>
  <text start="803.72" dur="4.619">listen to this guy this guy could</text>
  <text start="806" dur="4.35">actually shape narratives he was one of</text>
  <text start="808.339" dur="4.951">the I would presume one of the four a.m.</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="5.1">news makers so with that in mind you</text>
  <text start="813.29" dur="3.96">have to understand that these three guys</text>
  <text start="815.45" dur="3.09">James Dolan Aaron Swartz and Kevin</text>
  <text start="817.25" dur="3.75">Poulsen they created this thing called</text>
  <text start="818.54" dur="4.2">secure drop and then secure drop was</text>
  <text start="821" dur="3.779">basically after these two passed away</text>
  <text start="822.74" dur="3.33">from suicide secure drop was turned over</text>
  <text start="824.779" dur="2.761">to freedom of the press freedom of the</text>
  <text start="826.07" dur="4.079">press was started by John Perry Barlow</text>
  <text start="827.54" dur="4.38">and it&amp;#39;s basically it was this group</text>
  <text start="830.149" dur="4.981">that was supposedly going out and</text>
  <text start="831.92" dur="7.32">starting 2012 to go basically uncover</text>
  <text start="835.13" dur="6.18">corruption right and Q told us way back</text>
  <text start="839.24" dur="5.43">let&amp;#39;s see this post is from February 15</text>
  <text start="841.31" dur="5.7">so someone a week after John Perry</text>
  <text start="844.67" dur="5.49">Barlow passed about the exact same thing</text>
  <text start="847.01" dur="6.48">here and saying it was a 187 post name</text>
  <text start="850.16" dur="5.609">drop right and at Snowden you are now a</text>
  <text start="853.49" dur="4.529">liability so this is told that&amp;#39;s known</text>
  <text start="855.769" dur="4.051">your liability now and what I think this</text>
  <text start="858.019" dur="4.621">is referring to is that these people</text>
  <text start="859.82" dur="5.519">have the the ear of the techno elite and</text>
  <text start="862.64" dur="5.36">they have this whole idea of basically</text>
  <text start="865.339" dur="4.951">and it&amp;#39;s kind of weird it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="868" dur="5.41">they believed they could separate</text>

  <text start="879.8" dur="6.84">it was this really really grandiose and</text>
  <text start="882.14" dur="6.689">pretty much pipe dream type scenario</text>
  <text start="886.64" dur="4.53">where they follow these these leaders</text>
  <text start="888.829" dur="4.2">who give them these basically there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="891.17" dur="5.34">like these gurus who show them exactly</text>
  <text start="893.029" dur="5.191">what you know to think and how to feel</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="4.199">about you know the expansion of the</text>

  <text start="1215.169" dur="5.161">simple question it says and cue gives an</text>
  <text start="1217.54" dur="5.43">answer simple it says we made it public</text>
  <text start="1220.33" dur="6.56">operation closed and cleaned coincidence</text>

  <text start="1233.59" dur="5.37">NYC bomber fireworks hours prior where</text>
  <text start="1236.47" dur="5.39">we go one we go all cue so what this all</text>
  <text start="1238.96" dur="5.13">is talking about here is pretty pretty</text>
  <text start="1241.86" dur="3.939">complex but I&amp;#39;ll try to break down the</text>
  <text start="1244.09" dur="3.27">best I can and if you guys have any</text>
  <text start="1245.799" dur="2.851">different takes or if I miss something</text>
  <text start="1247.36" dur="3.48">or get something a little bit different</text>
  <text start="1248.65" dur="6.51">please correct me down in the comments</text>
  <text start="1250.84" dur="6.18">but what this is saying is that when</text>
  <text start="1255.16" dur="4.139">they made this public when they exposed</text>
  <text start="1257.02" dur="3.779">John Perry Barlow for what he is they</text>
  <text start="1259.299" dur="3.541">had to clean up the mess because they</text>
  <text start="1260.799" dur="4.051">knew that he had been exposed therefore</text>
  <text start="1262.84" dur="4.17">he was not useful to anyone at that</text>
  <text start="1264.85" dur="4.56">point and that these same people have</text>
  <text start="1267.01" dur="5.01">tried to get rid of him before right</text>
  <text start="1269.41" dur="4.44">because possibly he may be countering</text>
  <text start="1272.02" dur="3.42">what they they have originally wanted</text>
  <text start="1273.85" dur="4.98">him or he was using we&amp;#39;re using him for</text>
  <text start="1275.44" dur="4.68">right it says operation closed and clean</text>
  <text start="1278.83" dur="3.3">I guess that would be a suggestion by</text>
  <text start="1280.12" dur="3.78">cue that whatever it was it was wrapped</text>
  <text start="1282.13" dur="4.049">up and they cleaned up the mess after</text>
  <text start="1283.9" dur="3.87">themselves right and it says coincidence</text>
  <text start="1286.179" dur="2.941">after the drop will obviously if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1287.77" dur="3.21">pointed out publicly and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1289.12" dur="2.91">starting to put the pieces together</text>
  <text start="1290.98" dur="1.68">they&amp;#39;re gonna want to get rid of that</text>
  <text start="1292.03" dur="3.12">pretty quickly</text>
  <text start="1292.66" dur="4.38">now is it a coincidence that cue puts no</text>
  <text start="1295.15" dur="3.69">name in here it says no name exact 30</text>
  <text start="1297.04" dur="4.83">now that refers back to the fact that</text>
  <text start="1298.84" dur="6.12">cue actually pretty much predicted to</text>
  <text start="1301.87" dur="6.299">the day exactly when John McCain would</text>
  <text start="1304.96" dur="5.73">end up passing and I just we can go back</text>
  <text start="1308.169" dur="4.111">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s in previous and previous</text>
  <text start="1310.69" dur="3.75">video so I&amp;#39;m not hurting over exactly</text>
  <text start="1312.28" dur="4.8">how but cue told us you know every dog</text>
  <text start="1314.44" dur="4.71">has his day and they basically trying to</text>
  <text start="1317.08" dur="4.68">came to hide on thirty days later on</text>
  <text start="1319.15" dur="4.44">basically national dog day but it you</text>
  <text start="1321.76" dur="5.58">know people say it&amp;#39;s midnight and it was</text>
  <text start="1323.59" dur="5.97">off by a few hours I don&amp;#39;t know but then</text>
  <text start="1327.34" dur="4.38">it says coincidence that</text>
  <text start="1329.56" dur="3.84">Senator Graham was activated well no</text>
  <text start="1331.72" dur="3.54">obviously that&amp;#39;s not a coincidence</text>
  <text start="1333.4" dur="3.81">because senator Graham is the one who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1335.26" dur="3.57">pointing out on Capitol Hill think about</text>
  <text start="1337.21" dur="3.15">what senator Graham was saying this was</text>
  <text start="1338.83" dur="2.76">in that last video we watch if you guys</text>
  <text start="1340.36" dur="2.82">watch this channel regularly you know</text>
  <text start="1341.59" dur="3.06">what I&amp;#39;m talking about but there was an</text>
  <text start="1343.18" dur="3.39">exchange between judge Cavanaugh and</text>
  <text start="1344.65" dur="3.45">Lindsey Graham where Lindsey Graham was</text>
  <text start="1346.57" dur="4.32">basically outlining the fact that if</text>
  <text start="1348.1" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re if you help Abed our enemies and</text>
  <text start="1350.89" dur="3.99">this is right after they were talking</text>
  <text start="1352.03" dur="5.19">about 9/11 which is very interesting it</text>
  <text start="1354.88" dur="4.83">was saying if you help Abed and aid our</text>
  <text start="1357.22" dur="5.07">enemies in a time of war technically we</text>
  <text start="1359.71" dur="5.22">are at war with terror then you can be</text>
  <text start="1362.29" dur="4.86">held for a military court trial and you</text>
  <text start="1364.93" dur="4.35">could possibly possibly be sentenced to</text>
  <text start="1367.15" dur="5.01">death for treason and high treason</text>
  <text start="1369.28" dur="4.83">against our country and so it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1372.16" dur="4.38">starting to make sense now how there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1374.11" dur="4.17">this broad conspiracy that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1376.54" dur="3.18">uncovering piece by piece and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1378.28" dur="3.69">putting these puzzle pieces together</text>
  <text start="1379.72" dur="5.13">here and we&amp;#39;re actually seeing that you</text>
  <text start="1381.97" dur="4.98">know was no name working with these</text>
  <text start="1384.85" dur="4.08">other outside interests to get stories</text>
  <text start="1386.95" dur="3.66">out to push this agenda through our home</text>
  <text start="1388.93" dur="4.38">government being influenced by outside</text>
  <text start="1390.61" dur="5.73">actors obviously we know about McCain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1393.31" dur="4.86">work in the Middle East and all the</text>
  <text start="1396.34" dur="3.6">stuff that he was involved in in our</text>
  <text start="1398.17" dur="5.46">government so I mean this is really</text>
  <text start="1399.94" dur="5.34">really getting big so when Q says we</text>
  <text start="1403.63" dur="4.26">will be shocked to learn what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1405.28" dur="3.6">essentially witnessed I think it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1407.89" dur="3.39">be crazy and then when it talks about</text>
  <text start="1408.88" dur="4.26">the New York City bomber that&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="1411.28" dur="6.36">about the plot this is from way back</text>
  <text start="1413.14" dur="6.81">where Q told us basically it was a B D T</text>
  <text start="1417.64" dur="4.62">which is the Bangladeshi currency right</text>
  <text start="1419.95" dur="4.32">and he gave us that in the guy who ended</text>
  <text start="1422.26" dur="4.37">up going down into the subway trying to</text>
  <text start="1424.27" dur="5.34">blow himself up in a terrorist act</text>
  <text start="1426.63" dur="5.74">actually ended up not making that much</text>
  <text start="1429.61" dur="5.31">damage and only injuring himself because</text>
  <text start="1432.37" dur="4.2">some I I believe personally there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1434.92" dur="5.46">real official story on this yet but</text>
  <text start="1436.57" dur="5.46">somehow this guy originally had a bomb</text>
  <text start="1440.38" dur="4.62">to go down there but then ended up</text>
  <text start="1442.03" dur="5.25">having a it switched out I believe with</text>
  <text start="1445" dur="3.81">gunpowder which just made a really loud</text>
  <text start="1447.28" dur="3.27">bang and it burned the guy and he ended</text>
  <text start="1448.81" dur="6.15">up getting arrested but Q gave us</text>
  <text start="1450.55" dur="6.9">basically blunt indirect time which was</text>
  <text start="1454.96" dur="4.11">the the indicator to know that this was</text>
  <text start="1457.45" dur="4.02">going to happen and then it happened so</text>
  <text start="1459.07" dur="4.38">you know foreknowledge of these events</text>
  <text start="1461.47" dur="3.33">was being given us by cube</text>
  <text start="1463.45" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re not just trying to prove that</text>
  <text start="1464.8" dur="4.08">they they are who they are</text>
  <text start="1466.57" dur="6.45">the qa9 collective I mean they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1468.88" dur="5.55">to show those out in the world that we</text>
  <text start="1473.02" dur="3.3">know what they&amp;#39;re doing we know their</text>
  <text start="1474.43" dur="3.39">plans and we&amp;#39;re following them and we</text>
  <text start="1476.32" dur="3.72">see this whole connection between John</text>
  <text start="1477.82" dur="4.2">Barlow and Snowden and what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1480.04" dur="3.57">there so you guys have anything you want</text>
  <text start="1482.02" dur="3.72">to elaborate on and get more in depth</text>
  <text start="1483.61" dur="4.17">with that please leave it down in the</text>
  <text start="1485.74" dur="5.4">comments I&amp;#39;d love to read through that</text>
  <text start="1487.78" dur="5.61">all right now the next one here is an</text>
  <text start="1491.14" dur="4.23">Anton who says Ford should down for</text>
  <text start="1493.39" dur="5.48">poetry I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that what they</text>
  <text start="1495.37" dur="3.5">meant the same was like Ford should be</text>
  <text start="1499.95" dur="5.17">investigated for charges of perjury but</text>
  <text start="1503.17" dur="5.79">Q gives us an incredible rebut to this</text>
  <text start="1505.12" dur="5.46">and it shows exactly how the first of</text>
  <text start="1508.96" dur="3.12">all the reason why the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1510.58" dur="3">investigation is basically not gonna</text>
  <text start="1512.08" dur="3.83">uncover anything it&amp;#39;s not gonna have any</text>
  <text start="1513.58" dur="4.86">great Brown breaking Brown</text>
  <text start="1515.91" dur="4.36">groundbreaking revelations it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1518.44" dur="3.57">basically just confirm what we already</text>
  <text start="1520.27" dur="3.9">know which is just that he said she said</text>
  <text start="1522.01" dur="3.9">where there&amp;#39;s no corroborated facts</text>
  <text start="1524.17" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s no evidence to point that this</text>
  <text start="1525.91" dur="3.72">ever happened it&amp;#39;s just her word verse</text>
  <text start="1528.07" dur="3.54">judge Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s word and in that case</text>
  <text start="1529.63" dur="4.02">you can&amp;#39;t just believe somebody who</text>
  <text start="1531.61" dur="4.26">comes and makes an accusation with no</text>
  <text start="1533.65" dur="3.3">evidence I mean you&amp;#39;ve given every</text>
  <text start="1535.87" dur="4.5">chance of the world to have this</text>
  <text start="1536.95" dur="5.58">investigation but what Q says about</text>
  <text start="1540.37" dur="4.2">judge Cavanaugh right remember this is</text>
  <text start="1542.53" dur="4.08">about judge not judge kind of excuse me</text>
  <text start="1544.57" dur="5.22">this is about Professor Ford I should</text>
  <text start="1546.61" dur="5.28">say it says that basically she refused</text>
  <text start="1549.79" dur="4.65">to hand over therapy notes to the FBI</text>
  <text start="1551.89" dur="3.09">and to and he wants us to think why she</text>
  <text start="1554.44" dur="2.7">would do that</text>
  <text start="1554.98" dur="5.97">it says because justice Cavanaugh was</text>
  <text start="1557.14" dur="5.37">never named in those therapy sessions so</text>
  <text start="1560.95" dur="4.71">it was never written down in the notes</text>
  <text start="1562.51" dur="6.69">by anybody her her therapist right and</text>
  <text start="1565.66" dur="5.16">then it says mr. X logged in book along</text>
  <text start="1569.2" dur="4.65">with physical description during eyes</text>
  <text start="1570.82" dur="6.06">closed session equals equals justice K</text>
  <text start="1573.85" dur="5.07">so that&amp;#39;s literally what it says in the</text>
  <text start="1576.88" dur="3.54">notes it says mr. X and this is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1578.92" dur="4.08">presuming this is what it says in the</text>
  <text start="1580.42" dur="4.86">notes this is what Q&amp;#39;s was basically</text>
  <text start="1583" dur="4.35">alleging it says in the notes mr. X</text>
  <text start="1585.28" dur="2.91">logged in book along with physical</text>
  <text start="1587.35" dur="2.91">description</text>
  <text start="1588.19" dur="5.31">during eyes closed sessions so they</text>
  <text start="1590.26" dur="4.68">basically had an ice closed session</text>
  <text start="1593.5" dur="3.6">where she&amp;#39;s trying to recall what</text>
  <text start="1594.94" dur="5.55">happened and she gives a physical</text>
  <text start="1597.1" dur="5.22">description of the guy and that&amp;#39;s it but</text>
  <text start="1600.49" dur="3.179">that that in and of itself it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1602.32" dur="3.06">because she described something that</text>
  <text start="1603.669" dur="4.291">might have looked like judge Kay judge</text>
  <text start="1605.38" dur="3.78">Cavanaugh she&amp;#39;s all automatically its</text>
  <text start="1607.96" dur="3.3">judge Cavanaugh right even though</text>
  <text start="1609.16" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s no evidence to back this up it</text>
  <text start="1611.26" dur="5.1">says FBI knows subpoena power no grand</text>
  <text start="1613.9" dur="3.87">jury to demand so the FBI can&amp;#39;t go in</text>
  <text start="1616.36" dur="2.37">and subpoena them for the documents</text>
  <text start="1617.77" dur="2.22">because there&amp;#39;s no grand jury because</text>
  <text start="1618.73" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s no crime that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1619.99" dur="4.41">investigated so that&amp;#39;s what Q&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="1622.33" dur="3.99">to bring to our attention is the fact</text>
  <text start="1624.4" dur="6.54">that without a grand jury there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1626.32" dur="6.989">reason or even there&amp;#39;s no predicate for</text>
  <text start="1630.94" dur="4.859">a subpoena right because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1633.309" dur="5.1">criminal case it&amp;#39;s just this is</text>
  <text start="1635.799" dur="4.86">literally just until Fantasyland at this</text>
  <text start="1638.409" dur="3.451">point and it&amp;#39;s getting crazier but</text>
  <text start="1640.659" dur="3.39">hopefully they&amp;#39;re gonna have a vote here</text>
  <text start="1641.86" dur="3.27">q says they will I believe they will and</text>
  <text start="1644.049" dur="4.231">they&amp;#39;re going to confirm him hopefully</text>
  <text start="1645.13" dur="4.83">this week but it says justice Kavanagh</text>
  <text start="1648.28" dur="4.379">never named asked during Pollack</text>
  <text start="1649.96" dur="4.68">pondering polygraph and says something</text>

  <text start="1721.24" dur="4.919">justice Cavanaugh right and then it says</text>
  <text start="1724.03" dur="4.44">dr. Ford&amp;#39;s family has strong ties to the</text>

  <text start="1767.16" dur="5.25">you see how the swamp always ties back</text>
  <text start="1769.59" dur="4.589">into all this and then it says the FBI</text>
  <text start="1772.41" dur="4.019">is expanded an investigation into other</text>

  <text start="1793.62" dur="2.49">all they realize that rod Rhodes have</text>
  <text start="1794.76" dur="3.99">seen the only reason he has been fired</text>
  <text start="1796.11" dur="4.71">yet or has been forced to resign is</text>
  <text start="1798.75" dur="2.76">because justice Cavanaugh has not been</text>
  <text start="1800.82" dur="3.33">confirmed</text>
  <text start="1801.51" dur="4.77">second of all it&amp;#39;s saying the FBI isn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1830.07" dur="5.79">come back to bite them if we can prove</text>
  <text start="1832.44" dur="5.31">somehow that the CIA or other ABC</text>
  <text start="1835.86" dur="3.39">agencies were involved from the</text>
