  <text start="605.99" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s all fake now you see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.97" dur="4.08">completely nobody&amp;#39;s even talking about</text>

  <text start="613.67" dur="4.109">guys want to get a better idea of it</text>
  <text start="615.02" dur="7.55">watch the last episode but his whole</text>
  <text start="617.779" dur="7.921">thing was um that he has tapes with</text>
  <text start="622.57" dur="5.29">Trump or the whole but it&amp;#39;s not that his</text>
  <text start="625.7" dur="3.96">whole show is about trying to find tapes</text>
  <text start="627.86" dur="4.349">that may or may not exist</text>
  <text start="629.66" dur="4.169">and then he basically lied and said he</text>
  <text start="632.209" dur="3.421">was gonna go spend the whole weekend</text>
  <text start="633.829" dur="5.13">with trump&amp;#39;s former attorney michael</text>

  <text start="642.17" dur="3.87">which you know only thing I could see</text>
  <text start="644.24" dur="3.3">happening there is if Michael Cohen</text>
  <text start="646.04" dur="4.89">actually did sit down with him only</text>
  <text start="647.54" dur="5.69">thing he could be able to take away from</text>
  <text start="650.93" dur="4.469">that as a charge of its violating his</text>
  <text start="653.23" dur="5.409">attorney-client privilege and possibly</text>

  <text start="665.69" dur="9.12">so I digress what do we see here we</text>
  <text start="671.75" dur="7.47">actually see that this was his tactic</text>
  <text start="674.81" dur="6.93">right so what he decided to do was very</text>
  <text start="679.22" dur="6.57">interesting he decided to just become</text>
  <text start="681.74" dur="5.82">this anti Rosanna thing but this is what</text>
  <text start="685.79" dur="3.12">I it doesn&amp;#39;t matter about that because</text>

  <text start="688.91" dur="5.869">whatever what I want to talk about is</text>
  <text start="690.92" dur="6.33">the way he talks about how he saw her a</text>
  <text start="694.779" dur="5.081">Twitter feed and we all know if you</text>
  <text start="697.25" dur="3.99">watch Rosie on Twitter&amp;#39;s Rosanna Mars</text>

  <text start="827.27" dur="5.04">talks about it as in its it&amp;#39;s laughable</text>
  <text start="830.24" dur="6.03">and it&amp;#39;s unreasonable to suspect that</text>
  <text start="832.31" dur="5.82">there&amp;#39;s a big larger conspiracy of</text>
  <text start="836.27" dur="3.9">pedophiles who are working to cover each</text>

  <text start="914.86" dur="6.9">away into their little fake news land</text>
  <text start="918.4" dur="4.71">where they think they can just get away</text>
  <text start="921.76" dur="3.45">with anything what I thought was</text>

  <text start="925.21" dur="5.37">this part right this is cool long before</text>
  <text start="928.15" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s not cool but it&amp;#39;s interesting long</text>
  <text start="930.58" dur="3.99">before her racist tweet to manager</text>
  <text start="932.2" dur="4.02">Arnold was aware of her social media</text>
  <text start="934.57" dur="4.17">behavior and told Cooper that he was</text>
  <text start="936.22" dur="5.49">surprised that ABC decided to revive the</text>
  <text start="938.74" dur="4.92">show because of that it says I figured</text>

  <text start="948.94" dur="5.82">could see it coming listen what does</text>
  <text start="952.12" dur="4.86">this sound like what about freedom of</text>
  <text start="954.76" dur="4.17">speech what about you go and do a job</text>
  <text start="956.98" dur="4.13">and you&amp;#39;re an actor but you can have the</text>
  <text start="958.93" dur="5.76">the freedom of thought outside of that</text>
  <text start="961.11" dur="5.46">and that that in order to become an</text>

  <text start="966.57" dur="8.95">monitored right guys it&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="973.09" dur="5.13">laying it out for us to look and go okay</text>
  <text start="975.52" dur="4.95">I see it&amp;#39;s all about control like they</text>
  <text start="978.22" dur="3.96">need to month they would monitor her to</text>
  <text start="980.47" dur="4.14">keep her from talking about the truth of</text>
  <text start="982.18" dur="4.35">what&amp;#39;s going on so i just had thought</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="4.32">that was interesting thought it just</text>
  <text start="986.53" dur="5.49">warranted a little bit of a further dive</text>
  <text start="988.93" dur="5.55">and you know this is how the media</text>
  <text start="992.02" dur="4.59">portrays especially time magazines we</text>

  <text start="1324.2" dur="5.13">like what happened with the the biased</text>
  <text start="1326.93" dur="5.85">and more importantly what it didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1329.33" dur="6">into was what was discovered on Anthony</text>
  <text start="1332.78" dur="5.7">Weiner&amp;#39;s laptop now it&amp;#39;s so important to</text>
  <text start="1335.33" dur="6.48">read this article in the guise of</text>
  <text start="1338.48" dur="4.92">understanding that Anthony Weiner&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1343.4" dur="3.66">pieces of evidence in this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1345.23" dur="3.84">because it ties so much together it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1347.06" dur="5.16">got all the emails it&amp;#39;s got the the</text>

  <text start="1354.83" dur="4.38">what else right thousands of classified</text>
  <text start="1357.13" dur="3.64">hundreds of thousands it seems like</text>
  <text start="1359.21" dur="3.9">there was three hundred thousand emails</text>
  <text start="1360.77" dur="4.53">of that however many were classified I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1363.11" dur="4.08">not sure then you have the the evidence</text>
  <text start="1365.3" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s noted in the inspector general&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1367.19" dur="6.09">report that was evidence of crime</text>
  <text start="1369.89" dur="5.22">against children whatever that means</text>
  <text start="1373.28" dur="4.44">nobody&amp;#39;s giving us a full explanation on</text>
  <text start="1375.11" dur="4.83">that beside to say that that Anthony</text>
  <text start="1377.72" dur="4.8">Weiner&amp;#39;s laptop was possibly used to</text>
  <text start="1379.94" dur="4.14">talk to children but then what you know</text>
  <text start="1382.52" dur="3.18">why is that written in correlation to</text>
  <text start="1384.08" dur="3.72">the emails if you read the way the notes</text>
  <text start="1385.7" dur="5.94">are written it&amp;#39;s written in correlation</text>
  <text start="1387.8" dur="7.35">to the emails and this is what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1391.64" dur="6.63">saying and saying then it well then it</text>
  <text start="1395.15" dur="5.4">goes on to talk about how the former FBI</text>
  <text start="1398.27" dur="5.05">director James Comey did everything</text>
  <text start="1400.55" dur="5.57">basically out of political</text>
  <text start="1403.32" dur="4.51">bias I mean there was or political</text>
  <text start="1406.12" dur="5.79">consideration he didn&amp;#39;t try to be</text>
  <text start="1407.83" dur="5.85">objective or unbiased or follow any of</text>
  <text start="1411.91" dur="3.99">the the norms that are established to</text>
  <text start="1413.68" dur="5.07">keep federal agencies from intervening</text>
  <text start="1415.9" dur="5.67">inside of an election year when it were</text>
  <text start="1418.75" dur="6.3">but see there was two different things</text>
  <text start="1421.57" dur="5.7">for him for director coming to intervene</text>
  <text start="1425.05" dur="3.87">during the election year was okay when</text>
  <text start="1427.27" dur="5.07">it was Hillary because Hillary there was</text>
  <text start="1428.92" dur="5.97">actually proof of the crime there was</text>
  <text start="1432.34" dur="4.8">you know the emails I mean there&amp;#39;s crime</text>
  <text start="1434.89" dur="7.68">committed that there was evidence right</text>
  <text start="1437.14" dur="7.56">then with President Trump the the whole</text>
  <text start="1442.57" dur="4.5">argument goes like this okay first they</text>
  <text start="1444.7" dur="4.02">say you know President Trump had that</text>
  <text start="1447.07" dur="5.61">looked into there was no evidence</text>
  <text start="1448.72" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s no reason why director Comey</text>
  <text start="1452.68" dur="3.48">should have even started that</text>
  <text start="1453.91" dur="5.13">investigation or had his underlings</text>
  <text start="1456.16" dur="5.3">started or go to the the wherever and</text>
  <text start="1459.04" dur="5.12">get it going with the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="1461.46" dur="5.5">application with the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="1464.16" dur="4.87">sending Peter stroke on this operation</text>
  <text start="1466.96" dur="4.98">crossfire hurricane across and over to</text>
  <text start="1469.03" dur="4.92">brought the London and to get the the</text>
  <text start="1471.94" dur="4.68">dossier itself all of that should have</text>
  <text start="1473.95" dur="5.55">never been initiated because there was</text>
  <text start="1476.62" dur="4.47">no probable cause there was no evidence</text>
  <text start="1479.5" dur="4.17">and the probable cause that was</text>
  <text start="1481.09" dur="5.4">presented was from informants from the</text>
  <text start="1483.67" dur="5.73">FBI they were planting their own people</text>
  <text start="1486.49" dur="4.89">to create the seeds to sow the seeds of</text>
  <text start="1489.4" dur="7.05">doubt to get a judge to sign off on</text>
  <text start="1491.38" dur="7.62">furthering FISA warrants okay I hope I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1496.45" dur="4.38">explaining this fairly closely and</text>
  <text start="1499" dur="3.81">accurately but I&amp;#39;m just trying to go</text>
  <text start="1500.83" dur="8.27">through the main points here as we talk</text>
  <text start="1502.81" dur="6.29">about it but here&amp;#39;s an important thing</text>
  <text start="1510.48" dur="8.02">I&amp;#39;ll pull this one piece up</text>
  <text start="1515.88" dur="6.43">I&amp;#39;ll read it directly from the the</text>
  <text start="1518.5" dur="7.32">article to you these facts create a</text>
  <text start="1522.31" dur="4.95">strong inference that by squelching the</text>
  <text start="1525.82" dur="3.09">Clinton investigation in building a</text>
  <text start="1527.26" dur="3.72">narrative of Trump Russia collusion a</text>
  <text start="1528.91" dur="5.22">group of government officials saw to</text>
  <text start="1530.98" dur="5.52">bolster mrs. Clinton&amp;#39;s electoral chances</text>
  <text start="1534.13" dur="4.8">and if the unthinkable happen</text>
  <text start="1536.5" dur="4.11">happened obtain an insurance policy to</text>
  <text start="1538.93" dur="6">cripple the Trump administration with</text>
  <text start="1540.61" dur="6.87">the accusations of illegitimate I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1544.93" dur="5.49">I cannot summarize it better than that</text>
  <text start="1547.48" dur="4.68">that is the that is the crux of it that</text>
  <text start="1550.42" dur="4.85">is that the whole premise for why</text>
  <text start="1552.16" dur="6.72">there&amp;#39;s being an argument made fruit of</text>
  <text start="1555.27" dur="7.42">the the fruit of the poisonous tree</text>
  <text start="1558.88" dur="6.12">theory or argument basically stating</text>
  <text start="1562.69" dur="4.11">that the bias created by having people</text>
  <text start="1565" dur="5.84">like Peter stroke and Lisa page and</text>
  <text start="1566.8" dur="7.95">others at the FBI working taints</text>
  <text start="1570.84" dur="6.82">everything that happened and creates the</text>
  <text start="1574.75" dur="5.01">possibility that this was the lodge fair</text>
  <text start="1577.66" dur="5.13">this was the actual sequence of events</text>
  <text start="1579.76" dur="8.79">that that happened before the election</text>
  <text start="1582.79" dur="7.86">in 2016 that they put out the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1588.55" dur="4.59">investigation and they started the Trump</text>
  <text start="1590.65" dur="5.67">collusion investigation at the same time</text>
  <text start="1593.14" dur="4.56">in order to both help the President</text>
  <text start="1596.32" dur="4.86">Clinton have a chance of becoming</text>

  <text start="1605.47" dur="5.57">to him being elected that&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="1608.71" dur="5.46">it I mean and the article goes on to</text>
  <text start="1611.04" dur="9.12">explain it gives it gives court cases it</text>
  <text start="1614.17" dur="9.99">talks about the the fact that how when</text>
  <text start="1620.16" dur="5.89">there&amp;#39;s a perceived bias that it taints</text>
  <text start="1624.16" dur="5.72">an entire investigation it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1626.05" dur="5.85">matter what if you you could even say</text>
  <text start="1629.88" dur="4.6">Mueller&amp;#39;s great and he&amp;#39;s never done</text>
  <text start="1631.9" dur="5.31">anything wrong which is completely false</text>
  <text start="1634.48" dur="4.68">in my opinion but you could say all that</text>
  <text start="1637.21" dur="3.78">but it wouldn&amp;#39;t matter because you have</text>
  <text start="1639.16" dur="3.69">proof that there are biased people who</text>
  <text start="1640.99" dur="3.39">are working in this investigation from</text>
  <text start="1642.85" dur="4.02">the get-go therefore all of the evidence</text>
  <text start="1644.38" dur="4.98">all the effort at evidentiary findings</text>
  <text start="1646.87" dur="6.65">all of the investigatory efforts and</text>
  <text start="1649.36" dur="6.69">work all of that has to be dis basically</text>
  <text start="1653.52" dur="4.9">looked at through a different lens and</text>
  <text start="1656.05" dur="6.8">it can actually at least give us the</text>
  <text start="1658.42" dur="6.379">ability to stop and halt and pause the</text>
  <text start="1662.85" dur="6.569">Muller investigation as it stands right</text>
  <text start="1664.799" dur="6.99">now the anti-trump at rhetoric yes we</text>
  <text start="1669.419" dur="4.291">all know strong evidence of a crime can</text>
  <text start="1671.789" dur="3.36">overcome this policy which is what</text>
  <text start="1673.71" dur="3.809">happened with mrs. Clinton&amp;#39;s private</text>
  <text start="1675.149" dur="4.65">email server but again there was no</text>
  <text start="1677.519" dur="7.14">Russian evidence between President Trump</text>
  <text start="1679.799" dur="10.23">and Russia so look there&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="1684.659" dur="7.38">more to this it talks about how when</text>
  <text start="1690.029" dur="5.78">they started this crossfire hurricane</text>
  <text start="1692.039" dur="6.48">operation they neglected the most</text>
  <text start="1695.809" dur="4.57">important question if Russia promised</text>
  <text start="1698.519" dur="2.61">unspecified dirt on mrs. Clinton but</text>
  <text start="1700.379" dur="2.43">never delivered it</text>
  <text start="1701.129" dur="5.491">how would that amount to collusion with</text>
  <text start="1702.809" dur="6.96">the Trump campaign and it says given</text>
  <text start="1706.62" dur="12.75">everyone else talks to people from other</text>
  <text start="1709.769" dur="15.961">countries you know anyway this is what</text>
  <text start="1719.37" dur="7.919">we&amp;#39;re dealing with there&amp;#39;s even more in</text>
  <text start="1725.73" dur="7.71">this article if you guys want to read it</text>
  <text start="1727.289" dur="8.73">it&amp;#39;s up on the New York Times or near or</text>
  <text start="1733.44" dur="3.93">excuse me Wall Street Journal Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1736.019" dur="3.15">fruit of the poisonous tree</text>
  <text start="1737.37" dur="3.929">and there&amp;#39;s a link to it here on</text>
  <text start="1739.169" dur="4.021">president Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter page but um</text>
  <text start="1741.299" dur="4.021">that to me is is something that had to</text>
  <text start="1743.19" dur="3.63">be covered we have to reiterate these</text>
  <text start="1745.32" dur="4.979">things because they&amp;#39;re so important and</text>
  <text start="1746.82" dur="5.25">as of now you just now have that part of</text>
  <text start="1750.299" dur="3.691">justice giving and handing over new</text>
  <text start="1752.07" dur="7.589">classified documents on the Russia probe</text>
  <text start="1753.99" dur="8.49">we&amp;#39;ll see what these amount to but right</text>
  <text start="1759.659" dur="4.77">now it&amp;#39;s basically speaker Ryan has said</text>
  <text start="1762.48" dur="3.36">that they&amp;#39;ve partially complied with the</text>
  <text start="1764.429" dur="2.911">subpoenas meaning they didn&amp;#39;t give us</text>
  <text start="1765.84" dur="5.669">all the documents they didn&amp;#39;t give us</text>
  <text start="1767.34" dur="5.85">everything but once again that&amp;#39;s the DOJ</text>
  <text start="1771.509" dur="3.51">for you they just don&amp;#39;t want to turn</text>
  <text start="1773.19" dur="3.839">over anything to Congress for oversight</text>
  <text start="1775.019" dur="5.851">because they seem to think they know</text>
  <text start="1777.029" dur="6.181">better than us and that to me is is very</text>
  <text start="1780.87" dur="4.679">worrisome in troublesome and especially</text>
  <text start="1783.21" dur="4.14">given the fact that they&amp;#39;ve made they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1785.549" dur="4.08">classified information that&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="1787.35" dur="4.439">not a threat to national security in the</text>
  <text start="1789.629" dur="4.111">past which would lead me to believe that</text>
  <text start="1791.789" dur="2.471">they are classifying information now</text>
  <text start="1793.74" dur="2.89">that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1794.26" dur="5.31">threat to national security merely for</text>
  <text start="1796.63" dur="6.09">the fact that it&amp;#39;s going to keep them</text>
  <text start="1799.57" dur="8.31">from being implicated in further crimes</text>
  <text start="1802.72" dur="9.32">that have been committed so or even if</text>
  <text start="1807.88" dur="7.38">not chromed crimes of procedural</text>
  <text start="1812.04" dur="5.05">procedural misdoings whatever you want</text>

  <text start="2069.139" dur="10.5">and His grace and when talking about God</text>
  <text start="2075.46" dur="7.33">all I want is for everyone to know the</text>
  <text start="2079.639" dur="4.74">blessing of the Lord the blessings that</text>

  <text start="2117.14" dur="5.1">the Lord or do you want to live outside</text>
  <text start="2119.359" dur="4.711">of that without it because I think too</text>
  <text start="2122.24" dur="6.3">many people in our society just jump</text>
  <text start="2124.07" dur="7.16">right into that thought process of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2128.54" dur="5.819">not important or God doesn&amp;#39;t exist or</text>
  <text start="2131.23" dur="10.06">yeah you know God&amp;#39;s good but you know I</text>
  <text start="2134.359" dur="8.821">have I&amp;#39;m busy please remember God has to</text>

  <text start="2144.8" dur="5.72">you will see your blessings multiply you</text>
  <text start="2147.619" dur="6.181">will see the blessing of the Lord and</text>
  <text start="2150.52" dur="6.19">all I can say is that I pray everyday</text>

  <text start="2173.81" dur="5.16">following the commandments these things</text>
  <text start="2176.23" dur="4.78">these things are what are most important</text>
  <text start="2178.97" dur="5.85">and I just want to share this this quick</text>
  <text start="2181.01" dur="5.009">verse from Psalm 124 it says the Lord is</text>

  <text start="2194.099" dur="4.26">been on her side when men attacked us</text>
  <text start="2195.989" dur="4.86">then they would have swallowed us alive</text>

  <text start="2217.049" dur="6.81">help is in the name of the Lord the</text>
  <text start="2219.059" dur="8.94">maker of heaven and earth so just</text>
  <text start="2223.859" dur="5.791">remember the Lord is on your side and no</text>
