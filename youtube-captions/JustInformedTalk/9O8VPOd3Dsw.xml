  <text start="11.28" dur="10.8">second year and these are the best two</text>
  <text start="14.219" dur="11.55">years of my life thank you Alex Infowars</text>
  <text start="22.08" dur="6.859">is so threatening to the mainstream</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="6.301">media because it&amp;#39;s the most disruptive</text>
  <text start="28.939" dur="5.8">form of media that has been brought</text>
  <text start="32.07" dur="5.13">forward to challenge the mainstream</text>
  <text start="34.739" dur="6.301">media if you watch the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="37.2" dur="7.92">it all looks alike it all sounds alike</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="7.71">it has all the same patterns to it you</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="5.759">know the that talking points and NPR I</text>
  <text start="48.75" dur="3.629">think they go to the famous NPR school</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="6.061">to learn how to talk like that on the</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="7.491">radio they all sound the same well the</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="8.73">reason is because they are all corporate</text>
  <text start="59.87" dur="8.499">CIA fed mockingbird media and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="5.76">where Alex Jones comes in and disrupts</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="6.091">it breaks the model tells everybody the</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="4.89">truth fights and Alex and I have been</text>

  <text start="76.32" dur="7.26">interview with Alex went back to about</text>
  <text start="78.54" dur="8.55">2005 and this you know I mean this</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="7.05">period of time has been one where Alex I</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="6">found early on was a champion for</text>
  <text start="90.63" dur="5.07">fighting for the American freedoms for</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="4.44">fighting for the Constitution and we</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.52">didn&amp;#39;t have enough fighting for the</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="5.99">Constitution and now we&amp;#39;ve got millions</text>
  <text start="100.22" dur="3.3">including you</text>
  <text start="104.51" dur="6.52">and the reason the reason that Alex</text>
  <text start="108.33" dur="5.91">Jones is vilified and it&amp;#39;s is because</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="6.33">the mainstream media is afraid they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="114.24" dur="5.19">losing viewers by the millions while</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="4.71">Alex Jones is gaining viewers by the</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="4.71">millions and they&amp;#39;re seeing it happen</text>
