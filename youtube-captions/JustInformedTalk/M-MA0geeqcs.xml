  <text start="153.79" dur="5.97">to talk about that and how the path of</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="6.27">this storm is strange and is there more</text>
  <text start="159.76" dur="6.589">to the path of this storm and how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="6.75">moving and how everything is is</text>
  <text start="166.349" dur="4.03">connected I guess all the best way I can</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="3.389">put it right now is we&amp;#39;re gonna get into</text>
  <text start="170.379" dur="3.931">a bunch of different details that are</text>
  <text start="172.359" dur="4.171">gonna make sense once we put it all</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="4.47">together but before we do that look I</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="4.289">always say come here share these videos</text>
  <text start="178.78" dur="3.66">why watch them and share them if you</text>
  <text start="180.819" dur="4.351">haven&amp;#39;t already look the fact of the</text>
  <text start="182.44" dur="5.34">matter is we know Google&amp;#39;s suppressing</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="5.069">this content trust me if you could see</text>
  <text start="187.78" dur="5.579">the back end and you could see it from</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="5.041">Mayan and how they treat me and how our</text>
  <text start="193.359" dur="4.681">conversations are and how they</text>
  <text start="195.28" dur="4.769">demonetized every video and how you know</text>
  <text start="198.04" dur="4.05">you watch the actual analytics and the</text>
  <text start="200.049" dur="4.59">numbers you see real-time suppression</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="4.53">and then they admit it then they write</text>
  <text start="204.639" dur="4.49">blogs like Susan Wojcicki writes a blog</text>
  <text start="206.62" dur="5.67">and just brags about the fact that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.129" dur="7.211">limiting the the contents reach like</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="6.39">mines by 50% or more and that&amp;#39;s a part</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="4.679">of their game plan because they are</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="5.399">obviously the modern-day totalitarian</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="7.25">fascists that were described in George</text>
  <text start="224.079" dur="7.56">Orwell&amp;#39;s 1984 they are the the</text>
  <text start="228.269" dur="7.18">technocratic authoritarians who have</text>
  <text start="231.639" dur="5.761">decided to impose their will on society</text>
  <text start="235.449" dur="3.66">at large by telling us that they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="4.049">arbiters of truth and morality and</text>
  <text start="239.109" dur="4.891">before I get too much into an aside on</text>
  <text start="241.449" dur="4.831">that you guys got to share these videos</text>
  <text start="244" dur="5.25">hit the share button get the content out</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="4.95">that way because what we are doing is we</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="4.139">are going around them and their</text>
  <text start="251.23" dur="4.289">censorship algorithms but more</text>
  <text start="253.389" dur="5.371">importantly we&amp;#39;re continuing to show</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="5.22">them that we will not back down we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.76" dur="3.63">gonna continue to speak the truth as we</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="4.021">know and me on this channel I have two</text>
  <text start="262.39" dur="4.14">things first I share God&amp;#39;s grace with</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="3.36">everyone God&amp;#39;s Word that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m called to do God has given me this</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="4.62">great platform for it and also the truth</text>
  <text start="270.85" dur="3.18">as I know it but they want to shut that</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="2.91">down because they don&amp;#39;t want us to have</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="4.44">a conversation because the more you</text>
  <text start="275.65" dur="4.92">think the less controllable you are the</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="5.31">less of a slave you are and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="5.76">want free thinkers they want slaves they</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="6.859">want mindless zombies who will buy and</text>
  <text start="286.33" dur="6.69">do whatever they say and tell them to so</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="5.381">with that being said let&amp;#39;s just get into</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="5.149">the first story a tragedy thoughts and</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="4.68">prayers with family and friends of this</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="4.991">awful massacre</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="5.19">apparently five people dead 21 wounded</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="4.23">and the shooter was allegedly killed in</text>
  <text start="305.89" dur="3.779">this mass shooting in Midland Odessa</text>
  <text start="307.39" dur="4.49">this is just the latest report there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="4.351">not much information and go off of</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="5.44">initial reports say the shooter was a</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="4.86">white male in his mid 30s and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="6.42">about all we have and then we have these</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="7.02">latest totals now a few things first of</text>
  <text start="323.74" dur="4.83">all we already know what cue tells us</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="4.37">about looking for therapists and looking</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="4.349">for the Freemasons is there any other a</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="4.209">Freemasons that just pop on local TV and</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="5.491">start giving interviews like hey I was</text>
  <text start="334.479" dur="6.991">there uh other things that you look at</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="7.41">when these incidences occur in order to</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="5.88">understand better what this is but given</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="3.45">that we have no information on the</text>
  <text start="347.35" dur="3.93">shooter and we only have these</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="5.97">preliminary reports that are coming out</text>
  <text start="351.28" dur="6.06">I&amp;#39;m basically of the opinion at this</text>
  <text start="355.24" dur="4.56">point we should wait and see what the</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="4.29">facts are who was this person why they</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="4.64">do it did they have a mental illness</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="6.3">where they aren&amp;#39;t any psychotropic drugs</text>
  <text start="364.44" dur="4.96">were they recently with a therapist for</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="4.109">a long period of time who was that</text>
  <text start="369.4" dur="4.71">therapist and those kind of things I</text>
  <text start="372.039" dur="4.111">think would be a good place to start but</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="4.32">the mainstream media they always start</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="5.85">they they start 100 percent of the time</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="5.58">with we need to get rid of all guns and</text>
  <text start="382" dur="4.47">it seems like a logical argument until</text>
  <text start="384.01" dur="6.65">you look at other countries for instance</text>
  <text start="386.47" dur="7.74">this just happened in France we have a</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="6.64">Afghan asylum seeker killing one person</text>
  <text start="394.21" dur="4.459">and managing to stab a dozen other</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="5.989">people with a knife</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="7.5">so I mean look that&amp;#39;s where their whole</text>
  <text start="403.289" dur="5.071">thing falls apart because you what are</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="4.02">you gonna ban knives okay then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="3.51">gonna use a rock and oh you&amp;#39;re a band</text>
  <text start="410.189" dur="4.85">rocks good luck</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="5.879">right you&amp;#39;re gonna ban vans and cars and</text>
  <text start="415.039" dur="4.09">anything that can do anything matches</text>
  <text start="417.749" dur="4.92">because you know they might light</text>
  <text start="419.129" dur="4.921">something on fire I mean the logic just</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="2.97">doesn&amp;#39;t hold up when you put it to the</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="3.299">test and you know the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="425.639" dur="4.62">is gonna take this tragedy and say look</text>
  <text start="427.349" dur="4.38">we need to get rid of all guns I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.259" dur="2.94">know the details about what kind of gun</text>
  <text start="431.729" dur="3.93">this guy used I don&amp;#39;t know the details</text>
  <text start="433.199" dur="4.321">about anything about this person as an</text>
  <text start="435.659" dur="5.091">individual but I can tell you the answer</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="5.72">to this is not taking away people&amp;#39;s guns</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="5.439">except for in the case where we have</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="5.289">established parameters meaning</text>
  <text start="446.189" dur="4.891">background checks that look at certain</text>
  <text start="448.529" dur="4.32">things and markers that would you know</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="3.989">keep people from owning guns and we have</text>
  <text start="452.849" dur="5.13">very strong laws in the books now and</text>
  <text start="455.069" dur="3.9">also it always just neglects to take</text>
  <text start="457.979" dur="1.44">into account where there&amp;#39;s a will</text>
  <text start="458.969" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s a way</text>
  <text start="459.419" dur="5.701">if these people these Psychopaths want</text>
  <text start="462.569" dur="4.5">to hurt and maim and kill people they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="465.12" dur="3.599">figure out a way to do it take away all</text>
  <text start="467.069" dur="3.391">the guns well guess what they&amp;#39;ll go get</text>
  <text start="468.719" dur="4.801">a knife take away all the knives guess</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="5.579">what they will get a truck it it just</text>
  <text start="473.52" dur="4.379">baffles me the logic that is so flawed</text>
  <text start="476.039" dur="4.44">that they use every time one of these</text>
  <text start="477.899" dur="4.44">tragedies happens and they and they act</text>
  <text start="480.479" dur="5.61">like you know they&amp;#39;re giving you this</text>
  <text start="482.339" dur="5.79">this incredible you know answer that is</text>
  <text start="486.089" dur="4.021">gonna solve all of our problems when we</text>
  <text start="488.129" dur="3.451">know what happens look at the other</text>
  <text start="490.11" dur="4.049">countries where they took away the guns</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.309">I hate to quote Alex Jones but Mao took</text>
  <text start="494.159" dur="6.951">away the guns Stalin took away the guns</text>
  <text start="496.889" dur="6.75">and we will hurt in 1776 will commence</text>
  <text start="501.11" dur="4.269">in this country if you take away our</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="3.93">guns and I only say that laughingly</text>
  <text start="505.379" dur="3.72">because I&amp;#39;m thinking about the way Alex</text>
  <text start="507.569" dur="4.171">Jones said that on Piers Morgan I</text>
  <text start="509.099" dur="6.87">obviously do not think at all this</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="7.26">tragedy is funny but it does make us</text>
  <text start="515.969" dur="5.01">think it makes us go all right if this</text>
  <text start="519" dur="4.289">is happening what&amp;#39;s the logical solution</text>
  <text start="520.979" dur="5.011">this person obviously is deranged</text>
  <text start="523.289" dur="5.581">mentally disturbed and we need to know</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="6.57">like I said the facts surrounding his</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="6.87">psychological background in history</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="5.49">and you can&amp;#39;t just say oh he went on 18</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="4.65">once and he set a cue poster</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="3.45">and the logic doesn&amp;#39;t work that way but</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="4.29">it doesn&amp;#39;t work the other way either oh</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="5.55">you you attended an tyfa rally or even</text>
  <text start="544.68" dur="4.409">know these people are psychotically</text>
  <text start="547.05" dur="5.16">deranged and they are accountable for</text>
  <text start="549.089" dur="5.581">their own actions now of course you can</text>
  <text start="552.21" dur="6.03">say that some things are much worse than</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="8.13">others for instance an Tifa actually you</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="6.81">know basically inciting people to Ryan</text>
  <text start="562.8" dur="4.86">making calls to violence is far</text>
  <text start="565.05" dur="4.92">different than a peaceful movement of</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="5.07">truth seekers who are trying to bring</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="7.14">equality of law in this country but the</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="7.02">point is you can&amp;#39;t just say that this is</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="4.74">all because of this ideology or this</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="5.1">this one particular thing or because of</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="5.1">a gun it&amp;#39;s because of a multitude of</text>
  <text start="584.85" dur="3.87">things and you know what the fake news</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="3.78">is gonna do they&amp;#39;re gonna use this as a</text>
  <text start="588.72" dur="4.02">chance to divert away from the positive</text>
  <text start="590.73" dur="3.99">messages in our media they&amp;#39;re gonna use</text>
  <text start="592.74" dur="3.63">this and it depends it all really</text>
  <text start="594.72" dur="4.14">depends on what this guy ends up to be</text>
  <text start="596.37" dur="3.75">if he ends up to be some kind of an Tifa</text>
  <text start="598.86" dur="3.36">Bernie supporter we&amp;#39;re not gonna hear</text>
  <text start="600.12" dur="4.77">much about it but if he ends up to be</text>
  <text start="602.22" dur="5.04">some kind of conservative libertarian</text>
  <text start="604.89" dur="4.08">your bet your bottom dollar you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="3.36">hear about it non-stop for the next week</text>
  <text start="608.97" dur="4.83">and after all isn&amp;#39;t that what&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="610.62" dur="5.49">with our society the fake news media</text>
  <text start="613.8" dur="4.56">focuses on all the wrong things they</text>
  <text start="616.11" dur="6.3">tried to spin stories in order to push</text>
  <text start="618.36" dur="9.87">an agenda and their agenda is to destroy</text>
  <text start="622.41" dur="8.97">this country so I don&amp;#39;t know this on the</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="5.31">same day it would seem as this report</text>
  <text start="631.38" dur="4.62">comes out about the United States</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="4.47">unleashing the military to fight fake</text>
  <text start="636" dur="3.54">news and disinformation so I was</text>
  <text start="638.01" dur="3.89">thinking about this and I&amp;#39;m thinking is</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="5.19">this a good thing or a bad thing well</text>
  <text start="641.9" dur="5.08">these things in my opinion don&amp;#39;t ever</text>
  <text start="644.73" dur="4.049">end up working out too well especially</text>
  <text start="646.98" dur="4.32">when you have the good folks at the</text>
  <text start="648.779" dur="6.18">Defense Advanced Research Projects</text>
  <text start="651.3" dur="7.1">Agency aka DARPA wanting to customize</text>

  <text start="661.77" dur="4.5">photos videos and audio clips</text>
  <text start="664.28" dur="3.9">so the</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="4.71">fact of the matter is this is a</text>
  <text start="668.18" dur="5.53">controversial thing in my opinion but at</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="4.89">the same time it could be great if the</text>
  <text start="673.71" dur="4.5">if the DARPA bots were programmed to</text>
  <text start="675.87" dur="4.53">like go remove CNN articles and MSNBC</text>
  <text start="678.21" dur="5.4">articles then great I&amp;#39;m all for it but</text>
  <text start="680.4" dur="5.24">this is looking a little bit too</text>
  <text start="683.61" dur="3.99">Orwellian for me to sign on with and</text>
  <text start="685.64" dur="4.09">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see how that</text>
  <text start="687.6" dur="5.45">turns out</text>
  <text start="689.73" dur="5.97">the fact that it is though there is</text>
  <text start="693.05" dur="4.48">something to national security I may</text>
  <text start="695.7" dur="4.83">know people go you&amp;#39;re gonna censor</text>
  <text start="697.53" dur="5.73">people at all as well you know believe</text>
  <text start="700.53" dur="6.66">it or not our country as a whole has</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="7.98">kept secrets for since its inception</text>
  <text start="707.19" dur="6.06">pretty much so secrets are a part of it</text>
  <text start="711.24" dur="4.2">because we can&amp;#39;t just say everything and</text>
  <text start="713.25" dur="4.8">tell everyone everything that would take</text>
  <text start="715.44" dur="5.18">away a certain competitive or a military</text>
  <text start="718.05" dur="5.94">or any type of business economic</text>
  <text start="720.62" dur="7.09">advantage that would exist so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="723.99" dur="4.86">saying it&amp;#39;s okay to lie but I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="727.71" dur="3.87">that there&amp;#39;s always going to be that</text>
  <text start="728.85" dur="4.59">gray area that falls into the realm of</text>
  <text start="731.58" dur="3.87">national security and we have to be the</text>
  <text start="733.44" dur="6.42">constant force pushing back against that</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="7.8">so that we can continue to be a free and</text>
  <text start="739.86" dur="4.98">open society right because if we let</text>
  <text start="743.25" dur="3.51">this get too far out of hand just like</text>

  <text start="758.85" dur="3.54">that they want once you swing to one</text>
  <text start="760.62" dur="3.63">extreme it&amp;#39;ll swing back to another</text>
  <text start="762.39" dur="4.41">extreme and I&amp;#39;m hoping we don&amp;#39;t swing</text>
  <text start="764.25" dur="5.1">back to another extreme we should press</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="8.73">for a free media always but we should</text>

  <text start="877.2" dur="4.97">say now let&amp;#39;s get in this big story the</text>
  <text start="880.86" dur="3.63">one that we&amp;#39;re going to talk about is</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="3.97">the weaponization of whether do you guys</text>
  <text start="884.49" dur="4.83">you guys have probably heard this right</text>
  <text start="886.14" dur="8.94">harp right let&amp;#39;s go all the way to that</text>
  <text start="889.32" dur="13.05">if you want what what was harp it was</text>
  <text start="895.08" dur="9.78">the high altitude advanced research or</text>
  <text start="902.37" dur="6.84">excuse me high frequency active auroral</text>
  <text start="904.86" dur="5.46">research program so you know this was</text>
  <text start="909.21" dur="3.45">something that we talked about for a</text>
  <text start="910.32" dur="4.56">while it was it was an idea that they</text>
  <text start="912.66" dur="5.31">could use these these antennas to push</text>
  <text start="914.88" dur="6.3">these microwave waves into the</text>
  <text start="917.97" dur="5.43">atmosphere which would in turn push up a</text>
  <text start="921.18" dur="3.36">certain level of our atmosphere you know</text>
  <text start="923.4" dur="2.94">we have different levels the</text>
  <text start="924.54" dur="3.99">stratosphere ionosphere so on I think it</text>
  <text start="926.34" dur="4.74">pushes the ionosphere up and in doing so</text>
  <text start="928.53" dur="4.71">we could somehow manipulate weather</text>
  <text start="931.08" dur="3.36">patterns well this is stuff that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="933.24" dur="3.48">publicly talked</text>
  <text start="934.44" dur="3.899">for I don&amp;#39;t know how long and they</text>
  <text start="936.72" dur="3.929">basically admitted that it was one of</text>
  <text start="938.339" dur="4.161">their concepts and I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="940.649" dur="4.021">people have proven that it is</text>
  <text start="942.5" dur="4.75">theoretically very possible what they</text>
  <text start="944.67" dur="4.38">are saying right although we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="947.25" dur="3.899">how much hard evidence there is to</text>
  <text start="949.05" dur="4.17">suggest that it you know we could pull</text>
  <text start="951.149" dur="5.071">up to say it&amp;#39;s happening with that being</text>
  <text start="953.22" dur="7.14">said we have to understand that there is</text>
  <text start="956.22" dur="5.82">a certain set of coincidences with this</text>
  <text start="960.36" dur="4.2">storm now first of all if you guys watch</text>
  <text start="962.04" dur="5.01">this video here from yesterday I</text>

  <text start="974.37" dur="3.079">Twitter account</text>
  <text start="975.089" dur="5.19">where he warns people about the storm</text>
  <text start="977.449" dur="4.841">that&amp;#39;s heading toward Florida but he</text>
  <text start="980.279" dur="5.43">never mentions Florida he makes all</text>
  <text start="982.29" dur="5.549">kinds of cryptic references to the</text>
  <text start="985.709" dur="6.391">Virgin Islands and then makes another</text>
  <text start="987.839" dur="7.881">reference to the fact that you know that</text>
  <text start="992.1" dur="7.32">the storms gonna turn all this stuff so</text>

  <text start="1006.709" dur="4.411">the storm gonna end up hitting DC that</text>
  <text start="1009.56" dur="3.509">would be interesting now couple thoughts</text>

  <text start="1021.29" dur="4.95">digging down this track and it seems to</text>
  <text start="1024.5" dur="5.549">me that there&amp;#39;s a lot more to the story</text>
  <text start="1026.24" dur="5.61">that we can continue to uncover but like</text>
  <text start="1030.049" dur="4.101">I said we&amp;#39;re gonna start here Caribbean</text>

  <text start="1036.829" dur="4.311">put out a while ago actually this was</text>
  <text start="1039.559" dur="3.9">talking about</text>
  <text start="1041.14" dur="5.799">well actually this story was coming out</text>
  <text start="1043.459" dur="6.751">in March 25th but it&amp;#39;s talking about the</text>
  <text start="1046.939" dur="5.97">Grand Bahama Island where a Hong</text>

  <text start="1054.799" dur="9.561">expanding a deep-water container port</text>
  <text start="1058.34" dur="9.03">now the this port would be a direct</text>

  <text start="1067.37" dur="5.22">competition in the United States</text>
  <text start="1068.75" dur="6.87">it strategically allows Chinese to bring</text>
  <text start="1072.59" dur="4.56">more goods in and expand their trade</text>
  <text start="1075.62" dur="3.21">while at the same time they could</text>
  <text start="1077.15" dur="4.68">smuggle anything else in that they</text>
  <text start="1078.83" dur="7.4">wanted not to mention the fact that this</text>
  <text start="1081.83" dur="8.04">port is a part of the I believe</text>
  <text start="1086.23" dur="6.22">obviously the one belt one Road</text>
  <text start="1089.87" dur="4.47">initiative even though it is pushed by a</text>
  <text start="1092.45" dur="4.17">Hong kong-based company which is</text>
  <text start="1094.34" dur="4.829">supposedly free we see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1096.62" dur="4.38">in Hong Kong right now the the way that</text>
  <text start="1099.169" dur="4.921">the Chinese government is basically</text>
  <text start="1101" dur="6.33">integrated itself into their system has</text>
  <text start="1104.09" dur="5.43">inundated it with huge mass immigration</text>
  <text start="1107.33" dur="4.61">from mainland China in the Hong Kong of</text>
  <text start="1109.52" dur="5.94">mainland Chinese who are now voting</text>
  <text start="1111.94" dur="6.099">communist and pushing communist you know</text>
  <text start="1115.46" dur="5.699">principles even though the agreement was</text>

  <text start="1121.159" dur="5.88">30 or 40 years and basically Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="1125.33" dur="5.01">is compromised and it is a part of</text>
  <text start="1127.039" dur="7.951">mainland China now the communist part of</text>
  <text start="1130.34" dur="6.78">the CCP so remember this that this port</text>
  <text start="1134.99" dur="4.02">they spent three billion dollars in</text>
  <text start="1137.12" dur="3.33">developing a deep-water port and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1139.01" dur="3.6">know if you know what that means but</text>
  <text start="1140.45" dur="5.58">that means a lot of dredging that means</text>
  <text start="1142.61" dur="5.64">a lot of construction costs and I wonder</text>
  <text start="1146.03" dur="5.61">how devastating this hurricanes gonna be</text>
  <text start="1148.25" dur="6.659">because let&amp;#39;s look at this port the port</text>
  <text start="1151.64" dur="5.94">itself is actually located just what</text>
  <text start="1154.909" dur="7.411">seems to be north of a little place</text>
  <text start="1157.58" dur="7.77">called Cooperstown in the Bahamas now</text>
  <text start="1162.32" dur="4.729">here is the Bahamas and we&amp;#39;re gonna kind</text>
  <text start="1165.35" dur="3.9">of zoom all the way down into this</text>
  <text start="1167.049" dur="4.961">container port so you see here here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1169.25" dur="5.039">the town of Cooperstown and you can see</text>
  <text start="1172.01" dur="5.46">just north of here is this massive</text>
  <text start="1174.289" dur="5.971">complex which seems to be empty at the</text>
  <text start="1177.47" dur="5.4">moment as at the time of this photo</text>
  <text start="1180.26" dur="5.76">being taken but this looks to me I think</text>
  <text start="1182.87" dur="5.76">like the deep sea container port that</text>
  <text start="1186.02" dur="4.2">was developed by the Chinese I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1188.63" dur="7.529">able to basically verify that through</text>
  <text start="1190.22" dur="9.06">other other news sources but here it is</text>
  <text start="1196.159" dur="4.89">now let&amp;#39;s back out you see where this is</text>
  <text start="1199.28" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s Cooperstown it&amp;#39;s just north</text>
  <text start="1201.049" dur="3.511">there it&amp;#39;s on the No</text>
  <text start="1202.7" dur="5.85">worth end of the Bahamas I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1204.56" dur="6.48">grand bahama earner that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="1208.55" dur="5.82">Bahama Islands anyway the point being</text>
  <text start="1211.04" dur="4.53">let&amp;#39;s look at this so you see where this</text>
  <text start="1214.37" dur="4.05">is right and then you can see the</text>
  <text start="1215.57" dur="5.19">hurricane right there so I back out</text>
  <text start="1218.42" dur="6.48">there&amp;#39;s a massive category 5 hurricane</text>
  <text start="1220.76" dur="5.79">that I mean you could almost I mean</text>
  <text start="1224.9" dur="3.9">knowing how hurricanes go in this area</text>
  <text start="1226.55" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to basically hit a dead</text>
  <text start="1228.8" dur="5.34">center and it already hit that our</text>
  <text start="1231.56" dur="7.55">Virgin Islands and little st. James</text>
  <text start="1234.14" dur="7.83">that&amp;#39;s uh or the US Virgin Islands but</text>
  <text start="1239.11" dur="4.36">regardless you guys can see that this</text>
  <text start="1241.97" dur="3.66">hurricane is coming right at it now you</text>
  <text start="1243.47" dur="5.1">want to see this is a live picture right</text>
  <text start="1245.63" dur="5.99">now of that hurricane and as you can see</text>
  <text start="1248.57" dur="7.74">here I mean it&amp;#39;s heading directly for</text>
  <text start="1251.62" dur="7.6">the port there in the Bahamas that is</text>
  <text start="1256.31" dur="6.36">this 3 billion dollar deep-sea Chinese</text>
  <text start="1259.22" dur="4.83">port so is it coincidental and and</text>
  <text start="1262.67" dur="5.46">that&amp;#39;s really the question you have to</text>
  <text start="1264.05" dur="6.48">ask yourself I mean the way I work as</text>
  <text start="1268.13" dur="8.31">far as my mind goes is everything that</text>
  <text start="1270.53" dur="7.89">you imagine or see for the most part is</text>
  <text start="1276.44" dur="3.36">probably real and we probably just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1278.42" dur="4.47">know about it yet I know it sounds like</text>
  <text start="1279.8" dur="4.59">oh well that&amp;#39;s crazy well actually if</text>
  <text start="1282.89" dur="4.56">you think about the technology and how</text>
  <text start="1284.39" dur="5.49">advanced it continued continually gets</text>
  <text start="1287.45" dur="6.39">on a regular basis and then you look at</text>
  <text start="1289.88" dur="5.22">the the way that that our government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1293.84" dur="3.12">been spending all this money and</text>
  <text start="1295.1" dur="4.5">developing all these technologies for so</text>
  <text start="1296.96" dur="4.23">long I mean all so many things that we</text>
  <text start="1299.6" dur="5.43">probably think aren&amp;#39;t real are very real</text>
  <text start="1301.19" dur="5.67">and it wouldn&amp;#39;t take much for a control</text>
  <text start="1305.03" dur="6.6">system to be devised that could actually</text>
  <text start="1306.86" dur="6.51">steer a large mass of weather now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1311.63" dur="4.38">not telling you that I&amp;#39;m some sort of</text>
  <text start="1313.37" dur="5.19">meteorological scientists who can</text>
  <text start="1316.01" dur="4.65">provide you the exact specific details</text>
  <text start="1318.56" dur="3.84">of how that would be done but I can tell</text>
  <text start="1320.66" dur="4.23">you that what we looked at before which</text>
  <text start="1322.4" dur="4.32">was the HAARP article so we have things</text>
  <text start="1324.89" dur="4.89">like HAARP that do exist right</text>
  <text start="1326.72" dur="5.01">and we know that they&amp;#39;re reporting on</text>
  <text start="1329.78" dur="3.15">this right now the northern Bahamas are</text>
  <text start="1331.73" dur="3.21">hunkering down and I&amp;#39;ve always thought</text>
  <text start="1332.93" dur="2.65">to myself wouldn&amp;#39;t this be a great way</text>
  <text start="1334.94" dur="4.45">to</text>
  <text start="1335.58" dur="7.08">to deploy you know some black ops seals</text>
  <text start="1339.39" dur="6.3">for some tactical missions that involve</text>
  <text start="1342.66" dur="6.65">you know shutting down some criminal</text>
  <text start="1345.69" dur="6.38">enterprises or trafficking networks or</text>
  <text start="1349.31" dur="7.75">international money laundering</text>
  <text start="1352.07" dur="7.33">syndicates or whatever illegal weapons</text>
  <text start="1357.06" dur="5.91">being brought into the Chinese port by</text>
  <text start="1359.4" dur="5.16">the Chinese or you know I mean at one</text>
  <text start="1362.97" dur="4.23">point Russia was trying to bring nuclear</text>
  <text start="1364.56" dur="6">weapons into Cuba so I wouldn&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="1367.2" dur="4.95">anything past these people right and if</text>
  <text start="1370.56" dur="3.09">you think about it you could deploy a</text>
  <text start="1372.15" dur="4.83">SEAL team in the midst of a hurricane</text>
  <text start="1373.65" dur="4.71">and it would be great coverage I mean</text>
  <text start="1376.98" dur="4.74">the first of all you won&amp;#39;t have many</text>
  <text start="1378.36" dur="6.45">witnesses not maybe Wow anything that</text>
  <text start="1381.72" dur="5.55">happens you get privacy I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1384.81" dur="7.02">just thinking out loud here as you guys</text>
  <text start="1387.27" dur="6.54">can obviously tell so you know this is a</text>
  <text start="1391.83" dur="4.08">real thing that China did build the port</text>
  <text start="1393.81" dur="4.35">in the Bahamas and provide military and</text>
  <text start="1395.91" dur="3.36">it provided them with military</text>
  <text start="1398.16" dur="3.69">assistance so this could be a national</text>
  <text start="1399.27" dur="4.44">security threat and this could be a part</text>
  <text start="1401.85" dur="5.79">of the trade war that has been</text>
  <text start="1403.71" dur="6.65">clandestinely going on for so long so Q</text>
  <text start="1407.64" dur="5.72">is told us about this corona satellite</text>
  <text start="1410.36" dur="5.59">and how they were all taken offline</text>
  <text start="1413.36" dur="5.17">remember one of the first things we</text>
  <text start="1415.95" dur="6.18">heard from Q about the corona satellite</text>
  <text start="1418.53" dur="6.41">I believe program was seals are</text>
  <text start="1422.13" dur="6.75">wonderful creatures aka the Navy SEALs</text>
  <text start="1424.94" dur="5.68">which are fast dispatch teams that can</text>
  <text start="1428.88" dur="4.35">go anywhere in the world pretty much at</text>
  <text start="1430.62" dur="6.42">the drop of a hat and execute pretty</text>
  <text start="1433.23" dur="6.18">much any operation as far as anything</text>
  <text start="1437.04" dur="5.85">goes I would say heard they work fast at</text>
  <text start="1439.41" dur="6.99">capturing their prey so we&amp;#39;re capturing</text>
  <text start="1442.89" dur="5.31">prey meaning we are the the hunters are</text>
  <text start="1446.4" dur="4.53">becoming the hunted hmm isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="1448.2" dur="6.99">interesting pray silence is golden Kron</text>
  <text start="1450.93" dur="5.88">offline deactivate games are fun Q I</text>
  <text start="1455.19" dur="3.6">think there&amp;#39;s some more meaning there</text>
  <text start="1456.81" dur="3.42">but first of all let&amp;#39;s look back what</text>
  <text start="1458.79" dur="4.2">was Corona Corona was a satellite</text>
  <text start="1460.23" dur="6.54">program that&amp;#39;s apparently existed back</text>
  <text start="1462.99" dur="5.52">in 1950s up to the 70s but you know</text>
  <text start="1466.77" dur="2.79">these programs they keep the same name</text>
  <text start="1468.51" dur="2.94">and they just</text>
  <text start="1469.56" dur="3.63">say that they don&amp;#39;t exist anymore and</text>
  <text start="1471.45" dur="3.57">then they just keep developing the</text>
  <text start="1473.19" dur="3.33">technology and deploying that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1475.02" dur="4.23">plausible deniability that they worked</text>
  <text start="1476.52" dur="5.73">within if you look at the technology</text>
  <text start="1479.25" dur="5.67">that was found here in this satellite it</text>
  <text start="1482.25" dur="10.41">seemed that it was according to this</text>
  <text start="1484.92" dur="10.86">some sort of high quality satellite</text>
  <text start="1492.66" dur="5.67">camera lens that was used to take very</text>
  <text start="1495.78" dur="4.68">close up pictures detailed pictures now</text>
  <text start="1498.33" dur="3.9">we all know that along with that</text>
  <text start="1500.46" dur="3.51">technology they would have been testing</text>
  <text start="1502.23" dur="4.02">out all types of things do you guys</text>
  <text start="1503.97" dur="4.65">think about the technologies that we can</text>
  <text start="1506.25" dur="5.73">speculate may exist today like directed</text>
  <text start="1508.62" dur="6.51">energy weapons and or other EMP type</text>
  <text start="1511.98" dur="5.31">weapons you understand very quickly that</text>
  <text start="1515.13" dur="5.55">the applications of this satellite</text>
  <text start="1517.29" dur="4.98">weren&amp;#39;t just surveillance based I would</text>
  <text start="1520.68" dur="3.33">guarantee you a hundred and ten percent</text>
  <text start="1522.27" dur="3.54">that they had other capabilities that</text>
  <text start="1524.01" dur="3.12">they were testing and perfecting and</text>
  <text start="1525.81" dur="5.28">this is talking about a program that</text>
  <text start="1527.13" dur="5.76">supposedly ended back in the 70s so was</text>
  <text start="1531.09" dur="3.93">this program just can you know</text>
  <text start="1532.89" dur="4.16">officially ended then put on the black</text>
  <text start="1535.02" dur="4.89">budget and run by the CIA and</text>
  <text start="1537.05" dur="4.96">continually weaponize or perfected until</text>
  <text start="1539.91" dur="4.41">it was eventually taken over by this</text>
  <text start="1542.01" dur="5.55">deep seat and then weaponized and Q has</text>
  <text start="1544.32" dur="6.24">told us in these posts that it was taken</text>
  <text start="1547.56" dur="5.52">back from the deep state by President</text>
  <text start="1550.56" dur="5.37">Trump and military intelligence in the</text>
  <text start="1553.08" dur="6.45">operation that was shown here about all</text>
  <text start="1555.93" dur="6.75">the the routes the the satellites coming</text>
  <text start="1559.53" dur="5.66">offline it&amp;#39;s a theory I mean I have to</text>
  <text start="1562.68" dur="4.89">throw it out there because this came out</text>
  <text start="1565.19" dur="3.94">you know President Trump tweeted the</text>
  <text start="1567.57" dur="3.18">other day this picture saying the United</text>
  <text start="1569.13" dur="3.57">States of America was not involved in</text>
  <text start="1570.75" dur="3.9">the catastrophic accident during final</text>

  <text start="1581.52" dur="5.01">tan interring what happened at site one</text>
  <text start="1584.09" dur="3.91">so what&amp;#39;s interesting is this New York</text>
  <text start="1586.53" dur="2.91">Post article talks about one of the</text>
  <text start="1588" dur="3.69">scientists who&amp;#39;s developing this</text>
  <text start="1589.44" dur="3.72">technology which weirdly enough looks a</text>
  <text start="1591.69" dur="3.54">lot like the technology that they were</text>
  <text start="1593.16" dur="6.09">developing for this satellite system</text>
  <text start="1595.23" dur="5.309">back in what the 70s and that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1599.25" dur="4.019">about the</text>
  <text start="1600.539" dur="4.74">so where I ran is out as far as</text>
  <text start="1603.269" dur="4.14">technologically speaking but this guy</text>
  <text start="1605.279" dur="3.63">one of their top scientists says oh he</text>
  <text start="1607.409" dur="4.38">tweets at President Trump saying hey</text>
  <text start="1608.909" dur="5.94">look our satellites still totally fine</text>
  <text start="1611.789" dur="7.41">and me and the heat and I right now good</text>
  <text start="1614.849" dur="6.81">morning mr. Donald Trump and okay great</text>
  <text start="1619.199" dur="4.71">you know nowhere in this tweet do I see</text>
  <text start="1621.659" dur="5.88">President Trump say that the Saffir</text>
  <text start="1623.909" dur="5.7">satellite was destroyed he basically</text>
  <text start="1627.539" dur="3.63">says the launch light site was destroyed</text>
  <text start="1629.609" dur="2.97">so great you have your rocket now you</text>
  <text start="1631.169" dur="3.18">know a launch site</text>
  <text start="1632.579" dur="4.65">good luck building your next launch site</text>
  <text start="1634.349" dur="5.01">and watching it magically disappear as a</text>
  <text start="1637.229" dur="4.73">beam from the sky just shoots out of</text>
  <text start="1639.359" dur="5.82">nowhere and it Visser AIT&amp;#39;s your whole</text>
  <text start="1641.959" dur="6.97">launch pad so good luck with that Iran</text>
