  <text start="179.64" dur="3.9">on this channel and it seems to be a</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="3.03">regular occurrence and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="4.08">not luck they&amp;#39;re not trying to hide it</text>
  <text start="184.95" dur="5.43">you have the CEO of YouTube writing</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="4.83">blogs you know bragging about how they</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="3.63">are restricting the access to this</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="4.44">content they&amp;#39;re restricting the</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="5.33">algorithmic suggestions that promote</text>
  <text start="196.89" dur="4.41">this content how they are deeming</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="3.79">themselves the arbiters of truth and</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="3.93">morality and society and making</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="4.11">themselves the arbiters of what is true</text>

  <text start="216.24" dur="3.48">their phrase they use all the time which</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="3.45">is pretty appropriate because they are</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="4.31">authoritarians so they do need to give</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="6.09">you the authoritarian content that they</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="6.58">hand select for you to consume this</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="5.7">content and others like who do this kind</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="4.98">of stuff are being suppressed and this</text>
  <text start="233.46" dur="4.89">is a gross violation of our civil rights</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="5.58">but it seems that nobody is doing much</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="6.6">about it but as we know right now big</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="7.17">tech is getting hit with these massive</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="6.57">antitrust violations and this is a group</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="5.97">of attorney generals from across the</text>
  <text start="251.52" dur="4.65">country we have a 50 I believe decided</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="4.62">to come together to launch this probe</text>
  <text start="256.17" dur="4.83">into Google over these allegations that</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="4.17">are continuing to pop up of their</text>
  <text start="261" dur="3.72">anti-competitive behavior but we already</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="3.42">know what they&amp;#39;re doing people like</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="2.61">organizations like Project Veritas and</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="3.81">those who have</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="5.1">forward four against these major tech</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="3.839">corporations are exposing on a regular</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="4.109">basis the fact that they&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="5.52">anti-competitive they are politically</text>
  <text start="276.539" dur="5.4">biased in favor of one side over the</text>
  <text start="279.689" dur="4.861">other which means that they are giving</text>
  <text start="281.939" dur="5.25">in-kind campaign donations to their</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="4.53">favored parties which is illegal because</text>
  <text start="287.189" dur="5.51">it&amp;#39;s going around federal election</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="8.13">campaign finance law so this is really</text>
  <text start="292.699" dur="6.161">in my opinion a question of is Google</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="3.81">going to be held accountable for their</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="6.119">multiple multiple violations of federal</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="6.329">law or are the the Attorney General&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="5.071">our country of our states across the</text>
  <text start="307.349" dur="7.28">country going to buckle under the</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="9.959">immense pressure of Google&amp;#39;s litigious</text>
  <text start="314.629" dur="6.731">network of lawyers and lobbyists we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.009" dur="3.75">gonna have to wait and see how this</text>
  <text start="321.36" dur="3.41">happens to come together but I can tell</text>
  <text start="323.759" dur="4.321">you right now</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="6.34">Facebook Google YouTube Twitter all</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="6.869">these companies are involved in the most</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="6.75">gross violation of the law I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="334.949" dur="5.911">seen that as still to this day not been</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="5.13">addressed properly and hopefully this is</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="4.679">the first step in addressing it in the</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="5.609">proper way it needs to be but obviously</text>
  <text start="345.539" dur="5.071">it&amp;#39;s anti-competitive behavior times a</text>
  <text start="348.599" dur="4.981">hundred when you think of the amount of</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="5.76">power people like dr. Robert Epstein not</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="5.309">related to Jeffrey Epstein pointed out</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="4.32">on Capitol Hill during open testimony</text>

  <text start="360.69" dur="7.529">manipulate a 10 million votes before an</text>
  <text start="364.74" dur="5.97">election if not more subliminally</text>
  <text start="368.219" dur="4.591">without anyone knowing simply by</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="4.5">manipulating search results simply by</text>
  <text start="372.81" dur="3.96">Facebook putting out a reminder saying</text>
  <text start="375.21" dur="3.929">you should go vote only two Democrats</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="4.019">these kind of things we have to remember</text>
  <text start="379.139" dur="2.821">and that&amp;#39;s what this content suppression</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="3.331">is all about that&amp;#39;s why I ask you to</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="4.829">share this content because these big</text>
  <text start="384.12" dur="5.31">tech companies think that they are the</text>
  <text start="386.789" dur="4.141">arbiters of truth of morality and bigger</text>

  <text start="400.08" dur="3.119">this</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="4.82">now let&amp;#39;s get right into it this is</text>

  <text start="1743.21" dur="3.69">want to share a piece of Scripture and</text>
  <text start="1745.429" dur="2.701">in our segment that we do at the end of</text>
  <text start="1746.9" dur="3.029">each one of these episodes called God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1748.13" dur="3.539">grace is greater where we talk about</text>
  <text start="1749.929" dur="4.081">God&amp;#39;s grace and how it is truly greater</text>
  <text start="1751.669" dur="5.461">and today I want to talk about something</text>
  <text start="1754.01" dur="4.74">very important and this is talking about</text>
  <text start="1757.13" dur="4.049">competing for the faith</text>
  <text start="1758.75" dur="6">inside of the book of 1st Timothy and</text>
  <text start="1761.179" dur="7.441">it&amp;#39;s chapter 6 verse 11 and 12 it says</text>
  <text start="1764.75" dur="6.57">now you man of God run from these things</text>
  <text start="1768.62" dur="6.539">but pursue righteousness godliness faith</text>
  <text start="1771.32" dur="6.209">love endurance and gentleness fight the</text>
  <text start="1775.159" dur="4.201">good fight for the faith take hold of</text>
  <text start="1777.529" dur="4.38">eternal life to which you were called</text>
  <text start="1779.36" dur="4.28">and have made a good confession before</text>
  <text start="1781.909" dur="4.801">many witnesses</text>
  <text start="1783.64" dur="5.83">now that&amp;#39;s simple right but it talks</text>
  <text start="1786.71" dur="4.41">about something I think is important an</text>
  <text start="1789.47" dur="6.089">important message to share with everyone</text>
  <text start="1791.12" dur="7.23">right we have to run from the things</text>
  <text start="1795.559" dur="5.791">that are evil but pursue righteousness</text>
  <text start="1798.35" dur="7.5">godliness faith love endurance and</text>
  <text start="1801.35" dur="8.15">gentleness but it says we still have to</text>
  <text start="1805.85" dur="7.73">fight the good fight for the faith</text>
  <text start="1809.5" dur="6.87">so my message here is to remind us all</text>
  <text start="1813.58" dur="6.62">that when we stand and rebuke this evil</text>
  <text start="1816.37" dur="7.5">when we call on the Lord to come and</text>
  <text start="1820.2" dur="6.28">help us fight this battle against a</text>
  <text start="1823.87" dur="6.59">truly demonic force that is overtaking</text>
  <text start="1826.48" dur="7.41">so much of this world it is with our</text>
  <text start="1830.46" dur="5.92">hearts that we must remind ourselves to</text>
  <text start="1833.89" dur="5.55">have righteousness to be glad to have</text>
  <text start="1836.38" dur="5.789">godliness to pursue our faith in love</text>
  <text start="1839.44" dur="5.91">and endurance and gentleness while we</text>
  <text start="1842.169" dur="6.091">make this stand against evil it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1845.35" dur="5.85">tough balance I know and some of the</text>
  <text start="1848.26" dur="4.47">simplest things are just not easy but</text>
  <text start="1851.2" dur="6.839">you&amp;#39;ve got to remind yourself every</text>
  <text start="1852.73" dur="7.92">single day that you me all of us were</text>
  <text start="1858.039" dur="4.051">all children of God and we have to fight</text>
  <text start="1860.65" dur="4.95">for what&amp;#39;s right and we have to stand</text>
  <text start="1862.09" dur="6.839">against evil when we see it that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1865.6" dur="6.05">we&amp;#39;re called to do and it in my opinion</text>
  <text start="1868.929" dur="2.721">I think</text>
  <text start="1871.7" dur="6.25">that fighting the good fight for the</text>
  <text start="1874.47" dur="6.99">faith is how we take hold of our eternal</text>
  <text start="1877.95" dur="5.82">life in heaven is not backing down</text>
  <text start="1881.46" dur="7.52">not letting Satan win and standing and</text>
  <text start="1883.77" dur="9.74">showing the devil right to his face that</text>
  <text start="1888.98" dur="8.5">our love for one another our ability to</text>
  <text start="1893.51" dur="6.88">trust in God and our collective spirit</text>
  <text start="1897.48" dur="4.53">will never be broken that is the holy</text>
  <text start="1900.39" dur="4.89">spirit that lives in each and every one</text>
  <text start="1902.01" dur="4.74">of us so remember that take that into</text>
  <text start="1905.28" dur="4.19">the world share with your friends and</text>
  <text start="1906.75" dur="5.73">family remember that we stand and fight</text>
  <text start="1909.47" dur="4.12">the good fight for the faith and that&amp;#39;s</text>
