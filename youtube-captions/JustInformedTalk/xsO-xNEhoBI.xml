  <text start="133.68" dur="4.41">to suppress information and what I</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="4.83">consider like a modern-day book-burning</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="5.569">but as far as what I&amp;#39;ve called it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="5.039">not a modern day book morning it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="143.659" dur="4.78">modern day terms go it&amp;#39;s the equivalent</text>

  <text start="152.579" dur="3.181">comparison I make because what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="154.319" dur="3.84">done is they&amp;#39;ve just decided to start</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="4.229">erasing content off of the internet they</text>
  <text start="158.159" dur="5.461">disagree with or that they deemed to be</text>
  <text start="159.989" dur="5.521">on the border or controversial so these</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="3.75">people are authoritarians these people</text>

  <text start="214.159" dur="6.19">have been breaking down the video and I</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="5.279">guess from the moment that he walked</text>
  <text start="220.349" dur="6.181">into North Korea he turns around with</text>
  <text start="223.319" dur="5.34">kim jeong-hoon and takes according to</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="5.819">this person they put this graphic</text>
  <text start="228.659" dur="7.11">together 17 steps and then stops and has</text>
  <text start="232.349" dur="4.831">a handshake so we all know what 17 the</text>
  <text start="235.769" dur="5.19">significance of the number is if you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="260.759" dur="7.701">them meeting as you guys can tell here</text>

  <text start="268.46" dur="5.01">jong-un comes and they shake and</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="4.75">obviously then they turn around and</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="5.789">present Trump first I guess has to get</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="6.329">invited into North Korea so Kim invites</text>
  <text start="279.259" dur="4.38">him in and then they walked the 17 steps</text>
  <text start="282.199" dur="3.181">to the other side and have a</text>
  <text start="283.639" dur="5.43">conversation and come back</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="5.49">so here&amp;#39;s President Trump as you can see</text>
  <text start="289.069" dur="7.47">on the video here taking the first steps</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="7.829">in to North Korea and I watched this</text>
  <text start="296.539" dur="12.961">live last night obviously it was very</text>
  <text start="298.699" dur="17.421">interesting and 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</text>
  <text start="309.5" dur="10.02">16 17 yeah I was about 17 steps exactly</text>

  <text start="319.52" dur="3.119">guys and just kind of point that out</text>
  <text start="321.349" dur="2.85">because I thought it was interesting and</text>
  <text start="322.639" dur="3.391">if you go back to what Q&amp;#39;s been telling</text>
  <text start="324.199" dur="3.571">us about you know Kim and what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="4.53">on one of the first things that we were</text>
  <text start="327.77" dur="6.149">told about Kim in North Korea was back</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="5.19">in March of 2018 and this isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="333.919" dur="3.151">first first thing I think about North</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="2.82">Korea turning that but I think it was</text>
  <text start="337.07" dur="3.719">one of the first things we got about Kim</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.649">talking about him traveling to China and</text>
  <text start="340.789" dur="5.071">it says why was travel impossible in the</text>
  <text start="343.219" dur="5.491">past well that&amp;#39;s a very good question</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="5.16">and I think I know the answer to it and</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.579">Q alludes to it in a later post of</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="5.76">course where it talks about Kimpton and</text>
  <text start="354.289" dur="5.401">the next post q says Kim to China</text>
  <text start="356.78" dur="4.65">represents something vital a key now</text>
  <text start="359.69" dur="3.569">what I think he was referring to</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="5.609">obviously was something that he points</text>
  <text start="363.259" dur="4.831">out in one of the next posts here and I</text>
  <text start="367.039" dur="2.821">believe it&amp;#39;s this one right here where</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="3.569">it says and this is from June of 2018</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="4.02">where it says would you believe Hussein</text>
  <text start="371.659" dur="4.081">tried to call Kim prior to the summit</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="3.509">this is before President Trump had the</text>
  <text start="375.74" dur="6.03">North Korea summit where he met with Kim</text>
  <text start="377.389" dur="6.511">back in 2018 it says he did not have his</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="4.799">updated phone number three North Korean</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="5.1">generals released closed the pathway for</text>
  <text start="386.569" dur="4.65">bad actors q so we&amp;#39;ve talked about in</text>
  <text start="389" dur="5.099">the past is the fact that Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.219" dur="4.771">regime is comprised of military</text>
  <text start="394.099" dur="3.601">dictatorship and he is obviously at the</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="4.56">top Kim Jong moon</text>
  <text start="397.7" dur="5.16">as is the the whatever you want to call</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="5.79">it the path of succession from his</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="5.49">father and his grandfather so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.34" dur="4.62">interesting though from what Q says here</text>
  <text start="408.35" dur="7.5">there are top generals who help</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="7.77">basically control kim jeong-hoon and I</text>
  <text start="415.85" dur="4.68">think what we what we know now is that</text>
  <text start="418.73" dur="4.73">it&amp;#39;s very likely that there were</text>
  <text start="420.53" dur="7.14">generals inside of Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s army</text>
  <text start="423.46" dur="7.6">who were in basically in bed with deep</text>
  <text start="427.67" dur="6.33">state intelligence agencies globalist</text>
  <text start="431.06" dur="4.38">factions you name it and they were one</text>
  <text start="434" dur="3.42">they were the ones who were basically</text>
  <text start="435.44" dur="4.28">wielding a huge amount of control over</text>
  <text start="437.42" dur="5.34">kim jeong-hoon behind closed doors and</text>
  <text start="439.72" dur="6.4">why were they doing that well the idea</text>
  <text start="442.76" dur="5.19">is this you create the deep state needed</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="5.6">to create existential an existential</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="6.18">threat in order to extort the world I</text>
  <text start="451.72" dur="3.61">know that sounds crazy but it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="4.89">sounds like something I have a Bond</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="7.14">movie but the reason why President Obama</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="6.42">allowed North Korea to become a rogue</text>
  <text start="462.47" dur="6.9">nuclear state under his watch and other</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="6.18">presidents before him as minoo other</text>
  <text start="469.37" dur="4.92">reason then they needed a global</text>
  <text start="471.62" dur="5.4">existential threat in order to convince</text>
  <text start="474.29" dur="6.26">people to continue to give money to</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="3.53">these these big</text>
  <text start="483.96" dur="4.87">military industrial complex actors and</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="6.09">so on and so forth it was being used</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="7.52">basically as an excuse to hold the world</text>
  <text start="492.79" dur="5.79">hostage and to drain money out of the</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="4.8">coffers of the United States government</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="5.16">and into different military</text>
  <text start="501.15" dur="4">organizations pockets and this is really</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="3.66">something that&amp;#39;s been going on for quite</text>
  <text start="505.15" dur="3.63">some time but what I think happened with</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="3.72">President Trump is when he came to</text>
  <text start="508.78" dur="6.42">office the first thing they did was I</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="6.12">think help kim jeong-hoon to get rid of</text>
  <text start="515.2" dur="4.23">those three generals who were basically</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="4.5">probably either blackmailing him or</text>
  <text start="519.43" dur="5.46">controlling them secretly somehow behind</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="4.5">closed doors because there have been a</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="3.18">lot of people alluding to the fact that</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="3.99">Kim does not did not have full control</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="3.27">over his country so I thought that was</text>
  <text start="530.23" dur="3.51">something that was interesting if we</text>
  <text start="531.34" dur="4.08">look back at some of the older Kim or</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="3.78">older news North Korea post specially</text>
  <text start="535.42" dur="3.99">the ones dealing with Kim here and here</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="3.45">was a funny one that I thought from June</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="3.6">11th which was right before this other</text>
  <text start="540.97" dur="4.68">post talking about the generals and it</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="5.19">asked did Kim look nervous prior to the</text>
  <text start="545.65" dur="4.62">big meeting with POTUS and because he</text>
  <text start="548.2" dur="4.11">was in I think it was in Singapore and</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="3.78">qyd alluded to the fact that showing us</text>
  <text start="552.31" dur="3.48">pictures of this hotel where of course</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="4.26">Kim jong-un went and walked through and</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="3.98">they were trying to show him that you</text>
  <text start="558.31" dur="4.44">know his country could have all this</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="6.43">wealth and these beautiful places if</text>
  <text start="562.75" dur="4.68">they just would cooperate and of course</text>
  <text start="566.2" dur="3.06">he didn&amp;#39;t look nervous because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="2.49">been working behind closed doors for</text>
  <text start="569.26" dur="2.19">quite some time</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="3.33">and President Trump I believe that the</text>
  <text start="571.45" dur="5.37">United States helped him to get rid of</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="6.21">those controlling generals so that they</text>
  <text start="576.82" dur="5.01">could have peace and they could stop you</text>
  <text start="579.46" dur="3.99">know developing and pushing limits with</text>
  <text start="581.83" dur="4.44">their nuclear testing and their nuclear</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="5.22">weapons programs so this is something I</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="4.05">think that that we&amp;#39;re looking at in</text>
  <text start="588.67" dur="4.11">totally different light when we think</text>
  <text start="590.32" dur="4.8">about you know you look at the</text>
  <text start="592.78" dur="5.7">atrocities of what Kim&amp;#39;s regime has done</text>
  <text start="595.12" dur="8.01">and that&amp;#39;s unexcusable but how much of</text>
