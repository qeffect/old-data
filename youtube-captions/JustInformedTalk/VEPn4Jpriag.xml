  <text start="63.719" dur="4.681">know I really wanted to mention this</text>

  <text start="78.15" dur="8.28">let&amp;#39;s just continue to move forward here</text>
  <text start="81.95" dur="5.89">the N on who posts this says first he</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="3.81">gives us this tweet from Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="4.529">which says what many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="5.129">understand or don&amp;#39;t want to understand</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="6.39">is that Wayne Chris and the folks who</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="5.521">work so hard at the NRA are great people</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="4.081">and great American patriots they love</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="3.93">our country and will do the right thing</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="3.47">and there&amp;#39;s a bunch of spaces here and</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="4.17">then it says make America great again</text>
  <text start="106.31" dur="5.199">so I believe that the people at the NRA</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="5.1">are great I&amp;#39;ve been a member for a while</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="3.961">and I support the NRA and I support gun</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="3.569">rights and I support the Second</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="4.109">Amendment and if you want to find out</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="3.901">where I stand on that you can watch some</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="3.841">of my previous videos and you&amp;#39;ll get a</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="4.71">little a little taste of that here and</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="7.559">there so but going on the next post that</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="7.17">we have from him is the number of</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="5.011">fingers he&amp;#39;s holding on this card</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="5.22">okay we&amp;#39;ll look at this it says number</text>
  <text start="135.99" dur="5.97">five I hear you and he&amp;#39;s got one two</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="6.51">three four five fingers showing and we</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="7.34">have a post here from Q where he says</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="8.52">secure comms action or activated it says</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="8.11">signal underscore five :</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="5.19">five underscore red so we so what this</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="3.3">is saying here and then there&amp;#39;s a bunch</text>
  <text start="158.88" dur="4.08">of spaces inside these brackets which I</text>
  <text start="160.71" dur="5.7">think correlates to the tweet that we</text>
  <text start="162.96" dur="6.18">saw before right but he says here you</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="5.46">know the signal is 5 so it&amp;#39;s 1 2 3 4 5</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="5.79">fingers that&amp;#39;s the signal then we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="5.88">supposed to read what&amp;#39;s circled as 5 and</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="4.5">that says I hear you is that the</text>
  <text start="177.75" dur="3.15">president giving us a message or is it</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="4.29">just a coincidence I&amp;#39;ll leave that for</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="5.46">you the viewer to decide but I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="6.27">bring it to you as it comes to me so</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="5.31">moving forward or actually what we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="189.99" dur="4.47">read the rest of this knowing before it</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="5.19">it says we fill in the blanks he hears</text>
  <text start="194.46" dur="4.62">us we insert something here and show we</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="5.49">understand how this works whatever the</text>
  <text start="199.08" dur="5.61">board consensus is it will be you are</text>
  <text start="202.35" dur="4.02">learning our comms is how Q responses</text>

  <text start="206.37" dur="5.61">keel so there you go have we have we</text>
  <text start="210.42" dur="2.82">cracked a little bit of that code I</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="2.82">wanted to present this in the last</text>
  <text start="213.24" dur="3.06">episode but I&amp;#39;m so glad it&amp;#39;s been</text>

  <text start="223.59" dur="5.399">anton and everybody who brought this up</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="4.69">that&amp;#39;s fascinating and I think it all</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="3.241">correlates back to the fact that Trump</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="4.95">is behind this and it&amp;#39;s a group of</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="5.52">people a group of cues if you will who</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="4.649">are giving us this information helping</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="3.81">us along to get this into the public</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="3.931">domain as I&amp;#39;ve said before to create a</text>

  <text start="399.44" dur="4.25">regarding the missing</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="3.93">I guess that would be because they</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="4.38">wanted to keep a lot of the findings on</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="4.94">a pile out of the public record because</text>
  <text start="408.07" dur="4.62">the findings would show collusion and</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="5.58">corruption and treason at the highest</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="7.38">levels is that possible</text>
  <text start="416.07" dur="6.76">have we been betrayed will this this be</text>
  <text start="420.07" dur="4.38">made public soon I mean I&amp;#39;m gonna do a</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="3.03">few video series and I wanna hear what</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="4.02">you guys think about them in the</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="5.25">comments but one of the ideas I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="4.41">is to go back and do cover every single</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="3.96">Q post in the beginning because some of</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="4.49">the stuff in the beginning basically</text>
  <text start="435.07" dur="6.15">directly lays this out in no uncertain</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="7.75">terms and now we&amp;#39;re finally getting back</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="6.03">to it so is it the pendulum swinging</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="4.65">back to the other side have we gone to</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="4.49">the extreme of conservation and our work</text>
  <text start="449.77" dur="7.44">were on the attack</text>
  <text start="451.74" dur="7.96">that is yet to be seen the next is a man</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="6.99">on who posts the trader sold special</text>
  <text start="459.7" dur="9.03">access programs yes it says Q is</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="5.85">responding and Q says how do you break</text>
  <text start="468.73" dur="5.42">up something this big</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="6.81">what happens if low mid senior</text>
  <text start="474.15" dur="7.51">non-corrupt patriots learn they were</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="7.35">sold out what happens who&amp;#39;s waiting with</text>
  <text start="481.66" dur="5.1">open arms with a plan to reorganize</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="5.73">under a single entity with direct</text>
  <text start="486.76" dur="8.55">operational power or internal os&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="7.89">by trusted patriots i operational</text>
  <text start="495.31" dur="4.8">security i&amp;#39;m not sure who our trusted</text>
  <text start="497.83" dur="7.05">Patriots who understand Intel collection</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="6.9">q well you know I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="504.88" dur="7.38">the military that seems to be what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="9.9">pointing to you know but what this is</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="7.44">saying in a nutshell is the emails that</text>
  <text start="516.91" dur="6.81">were put onto that server were sold and</text>
  <text start="519.7" dur="5.67">the selling of that is an act of treason</text>
  <text start="523.72" dur="4.02">and those people are going to be</text>
  <text start="525.37" dur="6.67">uncovered and it will be made public</text>
  <text start="527.74" dur="6.88">soon but what hap</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="4.229">I think the real question is that even</text>
  <text start="534.62" dur="4.32">if we all know that that&amp;#39;s true what</text>
  <text start="536.269" dur="5.521">happens to these low mid mid level and</text>
  <text start="538.94" dur="4.589">senior level Patriots politicians and</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="3.659">government workers and who weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="543.529" dur="6.691">corrupt and they learned they were sold</text>
  <text start="545.449" dur="8.06">out I mean what happens honestly this is</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="3.289">where we could have a lot of big issues</text>
  <text start="553.569" dur="6.46">so you know you guys can help me figure</text>
  <text start="557.839" dur="3.48">this one out in the comments I really</text>
  <text start="560.029" dur="5.341">would be glad to hear what you guys have</text>
  <text start="561.319" dur="5.19">to think the Patriots who are trusted</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="4.05">with Intel collection or the military</text>
  <text start="566.509" dur="5.64">intelligence everything would go back to</text>
  <text start="569.42" dur="7.169">the military I&amp;#39;m not sure we would have</text>
  <text start="572.149" dur="7.62">to see on that but moving forward he</text>
  <text start="576.589" dur="5.101">responds to his own post here saying for</text>
  <text start="579.769" dur="4.951">those watching this should scare you</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s the power you depend on to survive</text>
  <text start="584.72" dur="4.71">money is worthless without those in</text>
  <text start="587" dur="8.339">power serving you White House military</text>
  <text start="589.43" dur="8.639">Patriots ready to play cue okay so what</text>
  <text start="595.339" dur="5.821">this is saying to me is is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="598.069" dur="5.491">obviously a lot that can be said for</text>
  <text start="601.16" dur="5.489">what this could be but I interpret is</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="5.519">this for those watching us here on the</text>

  <text start="614.209" dur="5.671">it&amp;#39;s the power in my opinion that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.12" dur="5.399">referring to the power grid it says you</text>
  <text start="619.88" dur="5.009">depend on to survive well obviously we</text>
  <text start="622.519" dur="5.13">all depend on that to survive then it</text>
  <text start="624.889" dur="5.76">says money is worthless which money</text>
  <text start="627.649" dur="6.361">would be worthless without power without</text>
