  <text start="145.98" dur="5.99">get the the word out around the</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="5.98">censorship and the algorithmic</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="4.9">manipulations that YouTube has employed</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="3.99">so all you guys have to do is scroll</text>

  <text start="161.61" dur="3.57">that helps the channel out morning you</text>
  <text start="163.32" dur="4.58">guys will ever know and it helps get the</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="4.74">word out because our mission is to</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="5.02">disseminate the information the</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="7.68">mainstream media will not and to bring</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="6.57">the truth as we know it for everyone to</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="6.2">look at objectively and make their own</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="6.51">minds up about so that&amp;#39;s where it is and</text>
  <text start="183.8" dur="3.85">if you guys watch this last video I just</text>
  <text start="186" dur="3.48">got to say thank you to everybody you</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="4.26">wrote in the comments I appreciate all</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="3.78">of your messages of positivity and I</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="3.39">know I probably sounded a little more</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="4.47">distressed in this video but the reality</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="4.02">is it&amp;#39;s just frustrating and if you guys</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="2.729">want to watch this video and get an idea</text>
  <text start="199.32" dur="3.84">of what I&amp;#39;m talking about it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="4.861">short and there&amp;#39;s just an example of</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="4.77">what I see on a regular basis here at</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="5.639">YouTube but that aside thank you for all</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="5.01">your support of messages very very kind</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="3.871">of you I appreciate that now getting</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="3.81">into the latest and also before we do</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="3">that also if you don&amp;#39;t know what Q Don</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="2.25">is in the Great Awakening and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.83" dur="2.49">kind of like what channel I just</text>
  <text start="219" dur="3.3">stumbled on what&amp;#39;s this guy talking</text>
  <text start="220.32" dur="3.33">about watch this video what it&amp;#39;s Q it on</text>
  <text start="222.3" dur="2.7">the Great Awakening it&amp;#39;ll give you all</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="2.7">that information that you need and a</text>
  <text start="225" dur="3.05">whole bunch more so I really encourage</text>
  <text start="226.35" dur="3.9">you guys to go check that out as well so</text>
  <text start="228.05" dur="3.61">today we&amp;#39;re gonna start with a few news</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="3.24">stories and then we&amp;#39;re going to get into</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="6.54">this whole temple thing because it is a</text>
  <text start="233.49" dur="8.37">crazy story but first here we are we</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="5.19">have this story coming out and I guess</text>
  <text start="241.86" dur="3.93">this would be the more appropriate story</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="7.349">to start with here would be the</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="6.66">hijacking of a of two British ships now</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="4.681">there&amp;#39;s video that&amp;#39;s come out which</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="6.45">apparently shows the Iranian</text>
  <text start="255.42" dur="6.9">Revolutionary Guard basically using a</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="4.8">helicopter to drop troops on this oil</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="3.75">tanker that was flying the British flag</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="3.27">in order to seize control of it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="4.1">surrounded by a</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="6.33">to the fast boats that the Iranian</text>
  <text start="270.17" dur="6.28">Revolutionary Guard are known for using</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="6.03">and this is obviously in the Strait of</text>
  <text start="276.45" dur="4.8">Hormuz and you can put together for</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="4.29">yourself you know what what happened</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="4.8">here they&amp;#39;re all masked up here and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="5.66">it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious that this is a point</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="6.09">of theirs to try to provoke</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="5.05">confrontation and to provoke a</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="4.2">confrontation and also I think there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="4.17">lot more going on behind the scenes and</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.11">what do I mean by that well as we</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="3.24">continue to expose epsteen epsteen</text>
  <text start="300.45" dur="2.31">Island something that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="1.38">talk about a little bit later in this</text>
  <text start="302.76" dur="2.67">video</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="5.19">is it really coincidental that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="5.13">being pushed into this global war</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.14">another endless war in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="4.68">something to take the attention away</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="4.56">from what we are uncovering on epstein</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="5.22">Island and I&amp;#39;m starting to think more</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="4.77">and more that epstein island is related</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="3.57">to what we&amp;#39;re going to talk about here</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="4.71">in the in the occult sense that this is</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="4.32">a traditional order that of things that</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="3.87">have been going on with the elite for a</text>
  <text start="328.35" dur="3.93">very long time and that&amp;#39;s gonna make a</text>
  <text start="330.36" dur="4.23">lot more sense when we look at this one</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="4.41">article which actually basically takes</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="4.44">what cues given us and gives us a</text>
  <text start="336.69" dur="4.32">historical background to it as far as</text>
  <text start="339.03" dur="4.38">dating all the way back to ancient Egypt</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="3.659">and that&amp;#39;s something that you guys are</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="3.27">gonna wanna stick around to check out</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="4.351">but as we see this happening and</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="3.63">unfolding you know there&amp;#39;s a few ways to</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="2.43">look at it but I think the more</text>
  <text start="350.31" dur="3.69">important thing is like you hear</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="4.77">President Trump&amp;#39;s words he says we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354" dur="5.01">put a lot of oil through the Strait of</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="4.8">Hormuz and the British have to deal with</text>
  <text start="359.01" dur="3.659">this like we have an agreement with the</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="4.62">British but we don&amp;#39;t have an agreement</text>
  <text start="362.669" dur="5.131">to fight their battles for them and</text>
  <text start="365.64" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s what the key difference is</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="3.72">between this president and every other</text>
  <text start="369.06" dur="5.54">president because President Trump has</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="6.63">taken a stand against these global elite</text>
  <text start="374.6" dur="6.79">aristocracy old Royal Guard that that</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="5.579">exists and is at the hub you know beyond</text>
  <text start="381.39" dur="5.67">the highest levels of power the power</text>
  <text start="383.729" dur="5.701">structures that exist so he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="387.06" dur="4.35">said look we&amp;#39;re about America first</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="4.049">we&amp;#39;re not about protecting British oil</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="4.98">tankers in the Strait of Hormuz</text>
  <text start="393.479" dur="5.06">you have a navy you have an army Britain</text>
  <text start="396.39" dur="4.48">go and take care of your own problems</text>
  <text start="398.539" dur="4.551">okay and don&amp;#39;t pull us into another</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="3.78">war not to mention the fact that the</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="5.7">Iranians are not stupid enough to go</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="6.06">after US assets even after what they did</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="3.93">with that drone allegedly because the</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="4.35">idea is this they are just trying to</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="4.49">drive up the price of oil and this helps</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="6.63">them because they&amp;#39;re being killed</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="6.04">metaphorically speaking by the sanctions</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="4.49">that have been imposed by the Trump</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="7.44">administration not to mention the the</text>
  <text start="426.18" dur="8.71">general movement toward freedom that is</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="8.07">overtaking certain areas that are let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.89" dur="5.82">just say less extreme and that is really</text>
  <text start="438.76" dur="4.86">something that they&amp;#39;re trying to fight</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="5.79">against as we speak but you know look</text>
  <text start="443.62" dur="3.99">this is the story as it&amp;#39;s coming and of</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="4.89">course you know you have all these</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="7.05">random globalist news outlets france24</text>
  <text start="451.39" dur="5.91">saying is the u.s. gonna lead a new war</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="5.64">in Iran and you&amp;#39;re like well this is</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="5.04">obviously global as propaganda being</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="4.53">shoveled into our face as we can see</text>
  <text start="462.34" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re trying to basically go to us</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="5.04">into another war and say you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="3.66">our duty to go and fight Iran in the</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="4.17">Strait of Hormuz when both of these</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="4.08">countries France you the Britain they</text>
  <text start="474.04" dur="3.36">have their own armies and can take care</text>
  <text start="475.51" dur="4.38">of themselves if they wanted to stand</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="5.64">against British or Iranian aggression in</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="5.58">the Strait of Hormuz so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a the</text>
  <text start="483.04" dur="5.61">whole thing is a complete farce to from</text>
  <text start="485.47" dur="4.59">the beginning so with that another story</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="4.05">that came out is we finally have a</text>
  <text start="490.06" dur="4.86">sentencing for this individual Harold</text>
  <text start="492.7" dur="4.35">Martin who was one of the many people</text>
  <text start="494.92" dur="5.16">who was stealing data from the National</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="6.27">Security Agency and keeping it privately</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="5.22">on his own server so I think that this</text>
  <text start="503.32" dur="3.48">is an example of what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="505.3" dur="3.09">as far as like when you look at Hillary</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="4.56">Clinton you look at what&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="508.39" dur="5.19">with Jeffrey Epstein and then you look</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="4.95">at what is going to be coming out</text>
  <text start="513.58" dur="5.19">through the NYPD and Anthony Weiner&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="5.28">laptop that is a story that is is has</text>
  <text start="518.77" dur="5.13">yet to be told and I really hope that</text>
  <text start="521.59" dur="4.62">one day we will see justice for what was</text>
  <text start="523.9" dur="4.23">found on that laptop and I think there</text>
  <text start="526.21" dur="5.87">are certain NYPD officers out there who</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="7.1">know exactly what I&amp;#39;m talking about but</text>
  <text start="532.08" dur="7.6">with that being said</text>
  <text start="535.23" dur="8.17">this is for you know an example to be</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="6.48">looked at this individual got nine years</text>
  <text start="543.4" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s other instances but I thought it</text>
  <text start="546.16" dur="4.02">was an interesting story to bring up in</text>
  <text start="547.78" dur="3.93">context of what I just referenced so</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="3.27">that was something that I thought was</text>
  <text start="551.71" dur="4.7">interesting here&amp;#39;s a great story from</text>
  <text start="553.45" dur="5.22">Mike Huckabee who I really appreciate</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="5.95">it&amp;#39;s talking about the real story about</text>
  <text start="558.67" dur="6.15">the Squad fascinating read here and what</text>
  <text start="562.36" dur="5.97">it talks about is there&amp;#39;s this faction</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="6.9">inside the Democrat Party called Justice</text>
  <text start="568.33" dur="6.72">Democrats now these Justice Democrats</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="7.83">are basically a very very far extreme</text>
  <text start="575.05" dur="8.85">left-wing platter organization</text>
  <text start="579.55" dur="6.36">associated with the Democrat Party and</text>
  <text start="583.9" dur="6.27">they have been placing candidates such</text>
