  <text start="7.98" dur="4.529">inquiries in the history of our country</text>
  <text start="10.01" dur="6.25">it goes to the core of whether the</text>
  <text start="12.509" dur="4.921">president abused his office to seek</text>
  <text start="16.26" dur="3.54">political help in his re-election</text>
  <text start="17.43" dur="5.189">campaign and did so to the detriment of</text>
  <text start="19.8" dur="5.37">our nation&amp;#39;s security a poll that just</text>
  <text start="22.619" dur="5.101">came out where I&amp;#39;m up massively with</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="4.32">independent voters I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="27.72" dur="3.66">this or because of the hoax you know</text>

  <text start="40.95" dur="9.089">country that has been invaded by Russia</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="8.521">to investigate a rival and condition the</text>

  <text start="62.489" dur="4.861">imagine a set of facts more damaging to</text>
  <text start="65.7" dur="4.65">our national security and our standing</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="4.41">in the world but also more of a</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="4.11">fundamental breach of the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="4.35">oath of office the American people have</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="3.81">the right to know if the president is</text>

  <text start="104.579" dur="5.281">I mean you it&amp;#39;s based on the unfair and</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="4.05">partisan process that mr. Schiff has</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="4.14">been running you think about what the</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="3.99">Democrats are trying to do impeach the</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.229">President of the United States thirteen</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="3.99">months prior to an election based on an</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="3.39">anonymous whistleblower with no</text>
  <text start="119.7" dur="3.629">first-hand knowledge who has a bias</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="5.011">against the President and the guy</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="4.65">running the process chairmanship didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="2.969">even tell us that he had met with the</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="4.081">whistleblower prior to the whistleblower</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="3.97">filing the complaint Adam Schiff didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="3.959">tell us that the way he</text>
  <text start="133.569" dur="4.95">ambassador Sandlin last week and this</text>
  <text start="136.019" dur="4.151">excuse me ambassador Volker in this</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="4.711">interview last week</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s that treatment is is the reason</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="3.81">why the administration the State</text>
  <text start="145.93" dur="4.11">Department said we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="5.849">subject ambassador song in to the same</text>
  <text start="150.04" dur="3.66">treatment and look we were actually</text>
  <text start="152.889" dur="3.151">looking forward to hearing from</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="3.599">ambassador solid we thought he was going</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="3.839">to reinforce exactly what ambassador</text>
  <text start="157.299" dur="4.62">Volker told us last week but again</text>
  <text start="159.879" dur="3.301">unfortunately when you have a speaker of</text>
  <text start="161.919" dur="2.43">the house who says we need to strike</text>
  <text start="163.18" dur="3.539">while the iron&amp;#39;s hot when you have a</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="5.131">chairman of the committee who is so</text>
  <text start="166.719" dur="4.38">biased against this president that he</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="2.819">wouldn&amp;#39;t even tell us that he had met</text>
  <text start="171.099" dur="3.39">with his staff had met with the</text>
  <text start="172.299" dur="4.08">whistleblower prior to the whistleblower</text>
  <text start="174.489" dur="4.53">filing the complaint and frankly this is</text>
  <text start="176.379" dur="4.11">a pattern with mr. chip he did the same</text>
  <text start="179.019" dur="3.12">thing if you remember the first big</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="3.511">hearing the Democrats did this Congress</text>
  <text start="182.139" dur="3.69">Michael Cohen he didn&amp;#39;t tell us that his</text>
  <text start="184" dur="4.29">staff had met with mr. Cohen for hours</text>
  <text start="185.829" dur="4.02">prior to mr. Cohen testifying he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="188.29" dur="4.529">tell us that last summer he had met with</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="5.521">mr. Simpson out in Colorado Palin while</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="5.13">with the guy with using GPS so this is a</text>
  <text start="195.37" dur="3.929">pattern like I said we were hoping to</text>
  <text start="197.949" dur="2.581">hear from the Ambassador today but we</text>
  <text start="199.299" dur="3.03">understand exactly why the</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="4.049">administration exactly why the State</text>
  <text start="202.329" dur="3.66">Department has chosen to say look if</text>
  <text start="204.579" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s going to be this kind of process if</text>
  <text start="205.989" dur="6.24">you&amp;#39;re going to selectively leaked text</text>
  <text start="209.319" dur="4.62">messages 67 pages of text messages we</text>
  <text start="212.229" dur="3.69">had they they take a handful and release</text>
  <text start="213.939" dur="4.38">to all of you and not give the full</text>
  <text start="215.919" dur="3.93">context not release the transcript we</text>
  <text start="218.319" dur="4.19">understand why they made this this</text>
  <text start="219.849" dur="5.31">decision at this at this moment</text>
  <text start="222.509" dur="4.48">transparency there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s an argument</text>
  <text start="225.159" dur="4.16">don&amp;#39;t know hold on one second hold on a</text>
  <text start="226.989" dur="4.65">second there&amp;#39;s an argument in favor of</text>
  <text start="229.319" dur="4.66">cherry-picking selective releases of</text>
  <text start="231.639" dur="5.25">texts there&amp;#39;s an argument in favor of</text>
  <text start="233.979" dur="4.921">only telling the American public what is</text>
  <text start="236.889" dur="3.901">best in the interests of wanting to take</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.169">down a sitting president maybe you</text>
  <text start="240.79" dur="4.08">should ask what was said inside the</text>
  <text start="243.069" dur="3.81">Volkers deposition during his</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="4.769">transcribed interview with regards to</text>

  <text start="255.939" dur="3.061">investigation into the Biden&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="3.21">last what did ambassador Volcker say</text>
  <text start="259" dur="3.15">about that that&amp;#39;s a great question I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="2.97">glad that you asked that question and</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="3.109">I&amp;#39;ll tell you the reason why that</text>
  <text start="263.56" dur="3.65">question was so important for you</text>
  <text start="265.259" dur="4.5">is for many things because he was in</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="5.13">this room for several hours and during</text>
  <text start="269.759" dur="5.13">several hours of testimony he talked</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="4.049">about how president Solinsky had no idea</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="4.141">that there was a hold on aid at the time</text>
  <text start="276.389" dur="4.951">the July 25th call ambassador Volker</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="3.99">taught testified about how the readouts</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="3.72">of the phone call that was made to him</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="3.69">that he had that there was nothing in</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="5.88">the readouts about there being a hold on</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="5.85">us aid or a quid pro quo or ambassador</text>
  <text start="290.94" dur="3.21">of Volcker testified this is what the</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="4.139">transcribed interview would tell you if</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="3.96">you ask this question I&amp;#39;m glad that we</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="3.81">were having this discussion</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="4.86">the next day ambassador of Volker meets</text>
  <text start="300.509" dur="5.581">with President Solinsky and in that</text>
  <text start="302.97" dur="6.09">meeting there is no reference to a quid</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="6.54">pro quo or president szalinski having</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="5.37">any idea there was a hold on aid or over</text>

  <text start="319.53" dur="4.53">being a hold on aid or there being a</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="4.889">quid pro quo and by the way no one else</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="4.71">ambassador Volcker testified to this</text>
  <text start="326.699" dur="5.071">entire time the aid was getting released</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="3.69">it was going to get released and guess</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="3.06">what happened</text>
  <text start="332.46" dur="4.829">the aid got released and you know what</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="4.679">didn&amp;#39;t have to happen there was no new</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="3.901">investigation to have to get created</text>
  <text start="339.509" dur="4.681">this whole thing is a fairy tale</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="4.71">Adam Schiff is misleading you and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="4.08">playing along with it many of you are</text>
  <text start="345.9" dur="4.65">and the American public is then getting</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="4.98">deceived when Adam Schiff said for</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="5.1">example that President Trump was asking</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="4.59">President Solinsky to manufacture dirt</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="5.069">on the Biden&amp;#39;s you know what ambassador</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="3.389">Volcker testified to that was absolutely</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="1.98">untrue</text>
  <text start="361.229" dur="3.091">that&amp;#39;s what we would call an</text>
  <text start="362.699" dur="3.27">inconvenient fact for the narrative you</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="3.899">know what else Adam Schiff has been</text>
  <text start="365.969" dur="4.741">saying to you and the American public</text>
  <text start="368.219" dur="4.741">that was not true that he had no contact</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="4.5">with the whistleblower he&amp;#39;d like to but</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="4.17">he didn&amp;#39;t have any contact he lied</text>
  <text start="375.21" dur="3.239">you know what else he lied about when he</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="2.75">gave his opening statement from the</text>
  <text start="378.449" dur="4.44">Acting Director of National Intelligence</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="4.48">as to what was in for the world as far</text>
  <text start="382.889" dur="3.931">as what the transcribed interview said</text>
  <text start="384.36" dur="5.369">now going back to ambassador Volkers</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="6.959">transcribed interview and a process we</text>
  <text start="389.729" dur="6.271">were here ready to do our part if anyone</text>
  <text start="393.779" dur="3.69">is going to testify behind those closed</text>
  <text start="396" dur="2.21">doors we&amp;#39;re going to make sure that</text>
  <text start="397.469" dur="2.661">we&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="3.959">to ensure that the other 99% of the</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="5.069">story is being told because guess what</text>
  <text start="402.169" dur="5.131">if we weren&amp;#39;t there last Thursday you</text>
  <text start="405.199" dur="4.201">would have no idea of everything that</text>

  <text start="444.139" dur="3.75">Schiff sure as heck is not going to tell</text>
  <text start="445.789" dur="3.75">you because all he has to do is write</text>
  <text start="447.889" dur="4.5">now release that transcribed interview</text>
  <text start="449.539" dur="5.011">because he won&amp;#39;t because it destroys his</text>
  <text start="452.389" dur="3.661">narrative it undercuts it it blows it up</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="3.359">that&amp;#39;s what we heard over the course of</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="4.2">several hours and by the way you know</text>

  <text start="474.349" dur="3.921">right and have this back and forth</text>
  <text start="475.909" dur="5.31">basically dumbing down their audience</text>
  <text start="478.27" dur="5.889">and what isn&amp;#39;t pointed out in that back</text>
  <text start="481.219" dur="5.551">and forth is that Gerry Connolly was the</text>

  <text start="496.88" dur="4.77">credibly exceptionally professionally</text>
  <text start="499.969" dur="4.471">but you&amp;#39;re not asking any of the most</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="3.87">important questions some of you are but</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="3.719">many of you aren&amp;#39;t asking the most</text>

  <text start="689.16" dur="2.729">kangaroo court you know what else Jim</text>
  <text start="690.48" dur="3.899">Jordan pointed out when we were here a</text>
  <text start="691.889" dur="5.281">few days ago was how when we showed up</text>
  <text start="694.379" dur="4.26">on Thursday Adam Schiff started by the</text>

  <text start="698.639" dur="4.8">a staff led a transcribed interview and</text>
  <text start="701.43" dur="4.17">that and it wasn&amp;#39;t until Jim Jordan push</text>
  <text start="703.439" dur="3.69">back the Adam Schiff reluctantly said</text>
  <text start="705.6" dur="4.26">that he would allow members to ask</text>
  <text start="707.129" dur="4.5">questions but it was discouraged he was</text>
  <text start="709.86" dur="3.75">strongly discouraging members to ask</text>
  <text start="711.629" dur="4.38">questions</text>
  <text start="713.61" dur="6.269">until it went so bad for Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="716.009" dur="5.791">didn&amp;#39;t jump for 25 minutes and and voice</text>
  <text start="719.879" dur="4.591">is cracking when they start to look at</text>
  <text start="721.8" dur="4.649">this why because ambassador Volcker was</text>
  <text start="724.47" dur="3.96">not giving them the answers that they</text>
  <text start="726.449" dur="4.531">were leading ambassador bulker to</text>
  <text start="728.43" dur="6.36">conclude I can tell you that that this</text>
  <text start="730.98" dur="5.909">is nothing more than you know Adam</text>
  <text start="734.79" dur="4.589">Schiff talked about four acts you know</text>
  <text start="736.889" dur="4.89">what there are four acts in the first</text>
  <text start="739.379" dur="4.741">second third and fourth act already has</text>
  <text start="741.779" dur="4.321">reached a conclusion for Adam Schiff let</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="5.909">the American people decide what could</text>
  <text start="746.1" dur="6.089">fine out of final act will be because</text>
  <text start="750.029" dur="4.471">ultimately when the truth comes out you</text>
  <text start="752.189" dur="6.57">will see that this president did not</text>
  <text start="754.5" dur="7.92">hold aid to try to influence a foreign</text>
  <text start="758.759" dur="6.661">country to do anything well first of all</text>
  <text start="762.42" dur="5.089">the impeachment inquiry is a scam the</text>
  <text start="765.42" dur="6.269">conversation that I had with the</text>
  <text start="767.509" dur="5.8">Ukrainian president Zielinski was a very</text>
  <text start="771.689" dur="4.351">good calm it was a very cordial very</text>
  <text start="773.309" dur="4.65">good conversation the mistake they made</text>
  <text start="776.04" dur="5.159">the opponents the opposition the</text>
  <text start="777.959" dur="5.22">Democrats the radical left deep state</text>
  <text start="781.199" dur="3.87">whatever you want to call them they came</text>
  <text start="783.179" dur="3.861">out with a whistleblower report before</text>
  <text start="785.069" dur="3.981">they saw the conversation</text>
  <text start="787.04" dur="3.33">had they waited one day Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="789.05" dur="2.7">wouldn&amp;#39;t have made a fool out of herself</text>
  <text start="790.37" dur="4.68">and she would have been able to say what</text>
  <text start="791.75" dur="5.339">I said because when she saw it she said</text>
  <text start="795.05" dur="6.81">this is not what the whistle blower said</text>
  <text start="797.089" dur="7.171">I had a very very congenial nice</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="5.039">conversation with a man that I liked and</text>
  <text start="804.26" dur="4.61">he ran on corruption because as you know</text>
  <text start="806.899" dur="3.841">Ukraine is known as a very corrupt</text>
  <text start="808.87" dur="3.79">country one of the most in the world</text>
  <text start="810.74" dur="3.63">shockingly because I know Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="812.66" dur="3.619">people it&amp;#39;s surprising to me but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="814.37" dur="4.5">known as one of the most corrupt</text>
  <text start="816.279" dur="5.161">countries and under the past leadership</text>
  <text start="818.87" dur="4.589">it was having a lot of difficulty this</text>
  <text start="821.44" dur="3.78">gentleman the current president the new</text>
  <text start="823.459" dur="3.961">president ran on the basis of</text>
  <text start="825.22" dur="6.22">anti-corruption as you know I think it</text>
  <text start="827.42" dur="6.18">was a single biggest thing and we had a</text>
  <text start="831.44" dur="3.69">great conversation but it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="833.6" dur="2.729">reported that way the only reason I</text>
  <text start="835.13" dur="2.61">would have released a letter because I</text>
  <text start="836.329" dur="2.82">think it&amp;#39;s terrible to have to release a</text>
  <text start="837.74" dur="2.61">letter that you have with the leader of</text>
  <text start="839.149" dur="4.56">a country I think that&amp;#39;s a terrible</text>
  <text start="840.35" dur="6.479">precedent but the whistleblower report</text>
  <text start="843.709" dur="6.451">or whatever the news was were so off it</text>
  <text start="846.829" dur="6.291">was so horrible I said I never said that</text>
  <text start="850.16" dur="7.25">I said let me see it we have a</text>
  <text start="853.12" dur="6.73">stenographer report we have a very very</text>
  <text start="857.41" dur="5.71">word-for-word report of what I said I</text>
  <text start="859.85" dur="5.28">released it and almost everybody that</text>
  <text start="863.12" dur="4.32">read it said it&amp;#39;s either perfect or</text>
  <text start="865.13" dur="7.079">really very good but it&amp;#39;s a very normal</text>
  <text start="867.44" dur="7.68">nice conversation and when you see that</text>
  <text start="872.209" dur="5.94">the president of Ukraine president</text>
  <text start="875.12" dur="5.82">szalinski said there was no pressure put</text>
  <text start="878.149" dur="5.55">on me whatsoever his spokesman came out</text>
  <text start="880.94" dur="4.47">two days ago said there was absolutely</text>
  <text start="883.699" dur="3.151">no pressure put on the president I</text>
  <text start="885.41" dur="2.7">didn&amp;#39;t tell him to say that there was no</text>
  <text start="886.85" dur="4.349">pressure put on all you have to do is</text>
  <text start="888.11" dur="5.969">read the report problem is I released it</text>
  <text start="891.199" dur="6.39">a day after they had already made their</text>
  <text start="894.079" dur="6.361">big statements and again it&amp;#39;s a big scam</text>
  <text start="897.589" dur="6">and I think Adam Schiff should be</text>
  <text start="900.44" dur="6.99">investigated for what he did he took to</text>
  <text start="903.589" dur="9.44">the Great Chamber Congress and he made a</text>
  <text start="907.43" dur="10.71">speech and his speech was a fraud</text>
  <text start="913.029" dur="7.841">everything he said was a fraud he went</text>
  <text start="918.14" dur="5.28">out as though I wrote it he defrauded</text>
  <text start="920.87" dur="5.52">the American people he defrauded</text>
  <text start="923.42" dur="5.13">Congress he defrauded himself and his</text>
  <text start="926.39" dur="3.72">family he made a speech as with a</text>
  <text start="928.55" dur="3.81">horrible speech I said what does this</text>
  <text start="930.11" dur="4.11">cut what&amp;#39;s going on here I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="932.36" dur="4.469">having some kind of a breakdown because</text>
  <text start="934.22" dur="4.679">he got up and made a speech that bore no</text>
  <text start="936.829" dur="3.901">relationship to what the conversation</text>
  <text start="938.899" dur="3.271">was and I&amp;#39;ll tell you a lot of people</text>
  <text start="940.73" dur="3.66">heard that speech and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="942.17" dur="3.599">thought that&amp;#39;s what I said because they</text>
  <text start="944.39" dur="4.46">heard his speech because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="945.769" dur="5.31">gonna read a three or four page</text>
  <text start="948.85" dur="6.07">conversation they don&amp;#39;t have access to</text>
  <text start="951.079" dur="6.12">it but I thought it was one of the I</text>
  <text start="954.92" dur="5.669">thought it was a terrible thing where</text>
  <text start="957.199" dur="5.611">he&amp;#39;s going up speaking as the president</text>
  <text start="960.589" dur="4.531">of the United States saying things that</text>
  <text start="962.81" dur="4.11">I never said and the meaning was</text>
  <text start="965.12" dur="2.519">horrible and the whole thought was</text>
  <text start="966.92" dur="3.21">horrible</text>
  <text start="967.639" dur="5.401">and then the whistleblower he did</text>
  <text start="970.13" dur="6.059">through his committee through himself he</text>
  <text start="973.04" dur="5.239">met with a whistleblower they never said</text>
  <text start="976.189" dur="4.71">that they never talked about it and</text>
  <text start="978.279" dur="4.211">Nancy Pelosi knew all of this stuff I</text>
  <text start="980.899" dur="3.99">mean she&amp;#39;s as guilty as he is cuz she</text>
  <text start="982.49" dur="4.23">know all that she knew everything about</text>
  <text start="984.889" dur="6.271">it and she didn&amp;#39;t do anything about it</text>
  <text start="986.72" dur="6.03">and I&amp;#39;ll tell you what they should</text>
  <text start="991.16" dur="4.5">really be looked at very strongly</text>
  <text start="992.75" dur="4.56">because what they did is unthinkable</text>
  <text start="995.66" dur="4.35">what they did to this country is</text>
  <text start="997.31" dur="4.29">unthinkable and it&amp;#39;s lucky that I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="1000.01" dur="3.09">president because I guess I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1001.6" dur="3.03">what a lot of people said very few</text>
  <text start="1003.1" dur="4.289">people could handle it I sort of thrive</text>
  <text start="1004.63" dur="5.13">on it you know why because because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1007.389" dur="4.82">so important that we get to the bottom</text>
  <text start="1009.76" dur="5.879">we went through the whole Muller scam</text>
  <text start="1012.209" dur="5.591">two and a half years we went through</text>
  <text start="1015.639" dur="3.871">that and I had three four days where it</text>
  <text start="1017.8" dur="3.45">was like overnight and then I&amp;#39;m walking</text>
  <text start="1019.51" dur="4.559">into the United Nations and they</text>
  <text start="1021.25" dur="5.4">released it as I&amp;#39;m walking in mr.</text>
  <text start="1024.069" dur="4.98">ambassador I&amp;#39;m walking in I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1026.65" dur="4.18">meet with I won&amp;#39;t name but one of the</text>
  <text start="1029.049" dur="4.061">top leaders of the world</text>
  <text start="1030.83" dur="4.53">and I see up on the screen and people</text>
  <text start="1033.11" dur="4.53">start screening about this scam called</text>
  <text start="1035.36" dur="4.08">impeachment you can&amp;#39;t impeach a</text>
  <text start="1037.64" dur="4.13">president for doing a great job</text>
  <text start="1039.44" dur="5.25">you can&amp;#39;t impeach a president for having</text>
  <text start="1041.77" dur="5.56">the lowest and best unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="1044.69" dur="6.12">that we&amp;#39;ve had in 51 years</text>
  <text start="1047.33" dur="6.45">you can&amp;#39;t impeach a president for tax</text>
  <text start="1050.81" dur="4.38">cuts and regulation cuts and creating</text>
  <text start="1053.78" dur="3.54">and even the Ambassador would say the</text>

  <text start="1057.32" dur="5.61">the strongest economy in the world this</text>
  <text start="1059.9" dur="4.65">is a scam and the people are wise to it</text>
  <text start="1062.93" dur="3.75">and that&amp;#39;s why my polls weren&amp;#39;t up I</text>
  <text start="1064.55" dur="3.69">think they said 17 points in the last</text>
