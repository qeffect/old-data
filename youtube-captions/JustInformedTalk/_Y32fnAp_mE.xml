  <text start="1932.049" dur="5.01">to share with you today&amp;#39;s is the first</text>
  <text start="1933.85" dur="5.09">part of a letter that was written now</text>
  <text start="1937.059" dur="5.07">you have to remember and this is our</text>
  <text start="1938.94" dur="7.18">Bible of course it&amp;#39;s second Corinthians</text>
  <text start="1942.129" dur="6.3">chapter 1 verses 3 to 11 basically and</text>
  <text start="1946.12" dur="3.96">what is the backstory to this because I</text>
  <text start="1948.429" dur="2.85">don&amp;#39;t normally get into the backstory of</text>
  <text start="1950.08" dur="3.569">some of these verses because usually I</text>
  <text start="1951.279" dur="3.661">like to extrapolate meaning in different</text>
  <text start="1953.649" dur="3.15">ways but this one I think is very</text>
  <text start="1954.94" dur="5.819">important because it&amp;#39;s a letter written</text>
  <text start="1956.799" dur="7.38">from Paul an apostle of Christ who was</text>
  <text start="1960.759" dur="9.061">out in Asia with Timothy who is another</text>
  <text start="1964.179" dur="8.46">brother of Christ and an apostle of the</text>
  <text start="1969.82" dur="5.54">Lord spreader of the good word now this</text>
  <text start="1972.639" dur="5.13">is after Christ had passed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1975.36" dur="3.58">traveling and spreading the word of God</text>
  <text start="1977.769" dur="4.02">throughout the world as they were</text>
  <text start="1978.94" dur="5.13">commanded to do by Christ to go out and</text>
  <text start="1981.789" dur="4.291">spread the word of God that is what we</text>
  <text start="1984.07" dur="4.68">were commanded to do and in this story</text>
  <text start="1986.08" dur="6.589">it opens up with this the letter</text>
  <text start="1988.75" dur="6.179">basically opens up with them telling</text>
  <text start="1992.669" dur="3.251">their brothers that they&amp;#39;re writing to</text>
  <text start="1994.929" dur="4.051">incur</text>
  <text start="1995.92" dur="5.4">at the church at Corinth about what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1998.98" dur="7.46">like out in Asia and how they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="2001.32" dur="7.68">basically targeted it&amp;#39;s a kind of like</text>
  <text start="2006.44" dur="4.42">not really but it&amp;#39;s kind of like what we</text>
  <text start="2009" dur="4.35">go through here where it&amp;#39;s like you know</text>

  <text start="2016.53" dur="5.88">incredible scrutiny and we get basically</text>
  <text start="2020.13" dur="4.02">raked over the coals over and over again</text>
  <text start="2022.41" dur="4.35">for just wanting to cover this</text>
  <text start="2024.15" dur="4.23">information share this information and I</text>
  <text start="2026.76" dur="4.08">just wanna let you guys know that that</text>
  <text start="2028.38" dur="4.11">just as their faith was strong God</text>
  <text start="2030.84" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s the faith we need to have in God</text>
  <text start="2032.49" dur="4.59">always this kind of faith that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2035.79" dur="3.54">gonna read about here in a second</text>

  <text start="2039.33" dur="4.95">our beliefs if it&amp;#39;s because God has</text>
  <text start="2042.12" dur="3.96">driven us to try to uncover the evil</text>

  <text start="2061.679" dur="5.22">take this kind of attitude but more</text>
  <text start="2064.83" dur="3.87">overly with our belief in God because if</text>
  <text start="2066.899" dur="4.26">we put that belief in God this kind of</text>
  <text start="2068.7" dur="4.65">strong belief like they have into God</text>

  <text start="2143.91" dur="5.73">we even despaired of life however we</text>
  <text start="2147.63" dur="5.1">personally had a death sentence within</text>
  <text start="2149.64" dur="5.67">ourselves so that we would not trust in</text>
  <text start="2152.73" dur="5.19">ourselves but in God who raises the dead</text>
  <text start="2155.31" dur="4.95">he has delivered us from such a terrible</text>
  <text start="2157.92" dur="4.41">death and he will deliver us we have</text>
  <text start="2160.26" dur="5.04">placed our hope in him that he will</text>
  <text start="2162.33" dur="4.77">deliver us again and you can join in</text>
  <text start="2165.3" dur="5.1">helping with prayer for us</text>
  <text start="2167.1" dur="5.37">so thanks may be given by many on our</text>
  <text start="2170.4" dur="7.83">behalf for the gift that came to us</text>
  <text start="2172.47" dur="7.41">through the prayers of many and I hope</text>
  <text start="2178.23" dur="3.81">you guys really kind of followed along</text>
  <text start="2179.88" dur="7.56">with that because what it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="2182.04" dur="8.19">saying is we&amp;#39;re all brothers in Christ</text>
  <text start="2187.44" dur="4.98">we share in that affliction first of all</text>
  <text start="2190.23" dur="3.9">my whole job on this earth is just</text>
  <text start="2192.42" dur="3.81">spread the word of God and to do my best</text>
  <text start="2194.13" dur="4.5">to honor God and to become the man that</text>
  <text start="2196.23" dur="4.62">God deserves for for God and for my</text>
  <text start="2198.63" dur="4.41">family and for you guys out there and</text>
  <text start="2200.85" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a mission I take very</text>
  <text start="2203.04" dur="6.84">seriously in my life but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2207" dur="5.43">important about this little little story</text>
  <text start="2209.88" dur="4.5">here is that it&amp;#39;s saying that we share</text>
  <text start="2212.43" dur="4.17">when we connect with one another through</text>
  <text start="2214.38" dur="4.44">God we share in the suffering and we</text>
  <text start="2216.6" dur="5.04">share in the comfort so we share</text>
  <text start="2218.82" dur="6.12">everything we share a common bond we</text>
  <text start="2221.64" dur="5.79">share our our highs and our lows but by</text>
  <text start="2224.94" dur="5.16">coming together in our love praise and</text>
  <text start="2227.43" dur="4.83">worship of God and Jesus that is what</text>
  <text start="2230.1" dur="4.35">makes us stronger that is our common</text>
  <text start="2232.26" dur="3.84">bond that is our connection that makes</text>
  <text start="2234.45" dur="4.41">it so that when we look at this stuff</text>
  <text start="2236.1" dur="4.8">when we examine what cues putting forth</text>
  <text start="2238.86" dur="3.69">you know and we try to examine it as</text>
  <text start="2240.9" dur="3.87">objectively as possible we look at it</text>
  <text start="2242.55" dur="6.6">and say alright this is evil that that</text>
  <text start="2244.77" dur="5.61">we have to stop and why do we see that</text>
  <text start="2249.15" dur="3.96">as evil that we have to stop it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2250.38" dur="5.15">because we understand that when a child</text>
  <text start="2253.11" dur="5.91">goes through that kind of abuse that if</text>
  <text start="2255.53" dur="5.26">they call out to God then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2259.02" dur="3.85">calling out to the same God that we are</text>
  <text start="2260.79" dur="4">and</text>
  <text start="2262.87" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s our duty to stand up for them if we</text>
  <text start="2264.79" dur="4.5">can to fight for them if we can and to</text>
  <text start="2267.13" dur="3.96">become stronger for them if we can and</text>
  <text start="2269.29" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s our commonality that&amp;#39;s our bond</text>
  <text start="2271.09" dur="5.52">our bond is through Christ and his</text>
  <text start="2273.46" dur="5.46">sacrifice so that you and I both can</text>
  <text start="2276.61" dur="4.68">have eternal life in heaven with our</text>
  <text start="2278.92" dur="5.52">Lord and Savior as long as we repent and</text>
