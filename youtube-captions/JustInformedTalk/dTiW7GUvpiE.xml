  <text start="50.43" dur="6.09">calling himself a complete nonpartisan</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="4.08">when he is the most partisan person I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="56.52" dur="4.019">ever heard speak and we&amp;#39;re gonna break</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="3.75">down a few of these early posts about</text>
  <text start="60.539" dur="3.84">Brennan and the implications they have</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="4.44">along with a few other things before we</text>
  <text start="64.379" dur="5.401">do that I want to share the start to the</text>
  <text start="66.96" dur="5.58">press that where this all started it was</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="4.379">in the White House press conference when</text>
  <text start="72.54" dur="3.59">Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked a</text>

  <text start="78.27" dur="4.56">revoking the security clearance of John</text>

  <text start="82.83" dur="4.429">Huckabee Sanders gives and I want you</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="2.96">guys to listen to this carefully</text>
  <text start="103.67" dur="10.229">security clearance and it should be will</text>
  <text start="111.259" dur="5.371">the president consider Senator Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.899" dur="6.271">suggestion and call for the removal of</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="5.79">former director Brennan security not</text>
  <text start="120.17" dur="3.059">only is the president looking to take</text>
  <text start="122.42" dur="2.64">away</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="4.051">Brennan&amp;#39;s security clearance he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="125.06" dur="5.759">looking into the clearances of Comey</text>
  <text start="127.28" dur="5.7">clapper Hayden rice and McCabe the</text>
  <text start="130.819" dur="3.721">president is exploring the mechanisms to</text>
  <text start="132.98" dur="3.78">remove security clearance because</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve politicized and in some cases</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="4.59">monetize their public service and</text>
  <text start="138.83" dur="4.739">security clearances making baseless</text>
  <text start="141.35" dur="4.35">accusations of improper contact with</text>
  <text start="143.569" dur="3.48">Russia or being influenced by Russia</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="3.3">against the president is extremely</text>
  <text start="147.049" dur="4.111">inappropriate and the fact that people</text>
  <text start="149" dur="3.72">with security clearances are making</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="3.9">these baseless charges provides</text>
  <text start="152.72" dur="6.41">inappropriate legitimacy to accusations</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="7.38">with zero evidence so there you have it</text>
  <text start="159.13" dur="6.22">basically what was being said is these</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="4.44">people are using there&amp;#39;s high security</text>
  <text start="165.35" dur="3.389">clearance that they still hold outside</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="3.63">of their positions now that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="168.739" dur="5.25">stepped down or resigned or been fired</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="5.13">in order to wield political influence</text>
  <text start="173.989" dur="4.261">and in some cases to monetize that</text>
  <text start="175.64" dur="5.939">information to their for their own self</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="5.7">gain so that and of itself is definitely</text>
  <text start="181.579" dur="3.871">morally reprehensible and I think</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s definitely some laws that could</text>
  <text start="185.45" dur="6.629">be cited but those have to be discovered</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="7.619">by the president&amp;#39;s legal correspondences</text>
  <text start="192.079" dur="4.44">our legal advisors and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="195.049" dur="4.081">have to figure out there is an actual</text>
  <text start="196.519" dur="4.231">present by which the pres precedent by</text>
  <text start="199.13" dur="5.46">which the President of the United States</text>
  <text start="200.75" dur="5.91">can actually remove these people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.59" dur="4.709">security clearances because you can just</text>
  <text start="206.66" dur="4.53">read about what they&amp;#39;re doing I mean</text>

  <text start="216.35" dur="2.55">about all this is going to happen it but</text>
  <text start="217.609" dur="2.791">I mean look at what John Brennan is</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="3.33">writing this is the kind of stuff he</text>

  <text start="276.41" dur="4.35">with President Putin about what happened</text>
  <text start="278.419" dur="4.981">with Hillary again we&amp;#39;re not blaming our</text>
  <text start="280.76" dur="5.19">adversaries for taking advantage of our</text>
  <text start="283.4" dur="5.91">corrupt politicians we can&amp;#39;t blame China</text>
  <text start="285.95" dur="5.76">for doing the best trade deals for</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="4.05">themselves that&amp;#39;s their prerogative just</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="3.209">like we can&amp;#39;t blame Russia for trying to</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="3.9">do the best trade deals for themselves</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="5.421">to get all of our uranium 3m1 and then</text>

  <text start="312.58" dur="4.149">authoritarian regimes give them nuclear</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="5.19">weapons and make them the threat that</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="6.411">can hold the whole world hostage but</text>

  <text start="758.949" dur="2.911">this way if that was there</text>
  <text start="760.089" dur="5.581">strategy what was the end goal the end</text>
  <text start="761.86" dur="7.529">goal was to create a regime outside of</text>

  <text start="782.11" dur="4.26">won&amp;#39;t let that happen now it&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="784.059" dur="3.9">about what was the bank and financial</text>

  <text start="1759.91" dur="5.7">media covering things there was a piece</text>
  <text start="1762.13" dur="5.04">on NBC where they talked about cue nan</text>
  <text start="1765.61" dur="3.6">and I thought it was really fascinating</text>
  <text start="1767.17" dur="5.43">to hear the lies that they spoke that</text>
  <text start="1769.21" dur="7.59">they wanted to put out there in the the</text>
  <text start="1772.6" dur="5.73">way that they basically butchered the</text>

  <text start="1778.33" dur="4.95">incredible they just what they want to</text>
  <text start="1780.19" dur="4.59">do is conflate people who study cue and</text>

  <text start="1799.279" dur="4.23">that just point that that pushes us to</text>
  <text start="1801.649" dur="4.561">work harder to have to find more</text>
  <text start="1803.509" dur="5.191">evidence and then find more proof so if</text>
  <text start="1806.21" dur="4.02">that is really a tactic they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1808.7" dur="3.449">use it&amp;#39;s going to end up backfiring on</text>
