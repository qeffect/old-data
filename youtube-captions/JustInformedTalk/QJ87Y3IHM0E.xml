  <text start="50.489" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re connected to the cue map and</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="5.069">what the cue map says about the booms</text>
  <text start="54.27" dur="6.48">but we&amp;#39;re gonna go ahead and look right</text>
  <text start="57.329" dur="7.921">here at the latest cue post and it was</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="7.409">posted earlier today and pretty cool</text>

  <text start="68.159" dur="5.401">think off the CBTs</text>

  <text start="86.97" dur="4.95">a lot there you get but here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="6.57">article it&amp;#39;s called here comes the fake</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="6.449">videos to artificial intelligence videos</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="4.68">tools make it relatively easy to put one</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.32">person&amp;#39;s face on another person&amp;#39;s face</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="5.97">person&amp;#39;s body with new traces of</text>
  <text start="102.689" dur="5.61">manipulation or with few traces of</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="5.339">manipulation excuse me I tried it on</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="6.18">myself what could go wrong now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="7.021">the actual article on the New York Times</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="5.791">com and if you go through the article it</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="3.799">kind of explains this technology I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="6.239">seen this before this is the technology</text>
  <text start="122.329" dur="6.971">where you can basically superimpose</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="5.461">people&amp;#39;s fate like they underlay your</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="3.28">face beneath a live video stream or a</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="2.95">video</text>
  <text start="132.58" dur="4.95">there has been made and you can actually</text>
  <text start="134.92" dur="4.17">manipulate the video to do what your</text>
  <text start="137.53" dur="2.19">face is saying so here&amp;#39;s a picture of</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="3.12">him</text>
  <text start="139.72" dur="5.07">this reporter he&amp;#39;s giving his initial</text>
  <text start="142.21" dur="4.56">inputs to the system he has to do</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="4.77">certain facial moves and say certain</text>
  <text start="146.77" dur="5.19">things and use his face and move his</text>
  <text start="149.56" dur="4.73">eyebrows around everything in a certain</text>
  <text start="151.96" dur="4.41">way to let the computer kind of</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="3.97">algorithmically log each every one of</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="4.08">his movements then the computer</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="4.67">processes that information and it can</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="6.03">transfer it into another person&amp;#39;s face</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="5.83">so you see here this is somebody who I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="166.48" dur="3.87">not familiar with on Allen because I</text>
  <text start="168.76" dur="2.7">don&amp;#39;t watch that show and most of the</text>
  <text start="170.35" dur="3.84">people who would appear on that show I</text>
  <text start="171.46" dur="6.06">probably would not support in a million</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="6.48">years besides a select few who do it</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="6.48">just for the sake of you know facing the</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="5.97">leftist media&amp;#39;s but and now here he is</text>
  <text start="184" dur="5.88">on this the guy from the Jurassic Park</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="5.88">movie I believe Pratt I think his name</text>
  <text start="189.88" dur="6.24">is or whatever that this guy is you know</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="5.51">and here he is on looks like no Jake</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="4.5">Gyllenhaal</text>
  <text start="198.03" dur="6.07">now what&amp;#39;s scary about this if this</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="6.63">technology I think this is him Jimmy</text>
  <text start="204.1" dur="7.71">Kimmel but what is terrifying about this</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="6.959">technology is the video drop okay now</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="13.649">we&amp;#39;re gonna go back and we&amp;#39;re gonna look</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="14.191">at this post here now what we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="4.651">talk about is basically how this is the</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="3.54">thing now another thing I want to say</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="3.54">thank you because everybody reminded me</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="2.76">I had a previous video where people had</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="5.19">to clarify this for me</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="7.53">that five five means loud and clear so</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="7.71">five five is loud and clear and people</text>
  <text start="242.23" dur="9.11">have speculated that this video is a is</text>
  <text start="246.55" dur="12.02">an x-rated video and it&amp;#39;s of HRC with</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="7.23">whom Abidine in some kind of disgusting</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="5.11">sexual in nature video that that I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="4.681">speculate on because I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="4.86">it is but I can tell you that that</text>
  <text start="266.23" dur="6.09">something that it could be very</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="9.45">disturbing and the whole post about put</text>
  <text start="272.32" dur="11.7">it up in Times Square you know that</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="10.32">that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s referring to so I was</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="5.46">gonna go back to that oh well I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="3.03">really find it you guys know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="289.48" dur="5.91">referring to it says post the video on</text>
  <text start="291.43" dur="7.05">Times Square but so what this is getting</text>
  <text start="295.39" dur="6.48">into though for me okay if you take what</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="5.55">this technology can do and you simply</text>
  <text start="301.87" dur="4.34">apply it to the principle of how the</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="5.13">mainstream media is gonna try to spin</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="5.41">this video if it were to be dropped okay</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="3.93">the first way I believe they would spin</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="4.14">it is they would say this technology</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="4.74">have been used okay there&amp;#39;s not not</text>
  <text start="315.76" dur="5.64">their real faces that&amp;#39;s not them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="7.2">not because it it would be think of it</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="7.29">this way it would be much easier for</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="9.17">people to accept the fact that it was a</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="7.83">fake a forgery and an untrue edited</text>
  <text start="334.2" dur="5.05">fabricated video than to accept the</text>
  <text start="336.52" dur="6.09">truth that it it&amp;#39;s the people that you</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="6.48">look up to probably the most next to</text>
  <text start="342.61" dur="7.17">clergy would be like politicians it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="5.61">which is sad because you know</text>
  <text start="349.78" dur="3.75">politicians usually aren&amp;#39;t the best</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="3.81">people in the world but certain people</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="3.93">come along and they are good people such</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="3.72">as Donald Trump our president so but</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="4.26">this is how they&amp;#39;re gonna spin it this</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="5.55">is the whole point I think it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="361.72" dur="5.22">fascinating that cue is giving us this</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="4.92">heads-up I mean he&amp;#39;s basically saying to</text>
  <text start="366.94" dur="5.19">us here we&amp;#39;ll read what he posts he says</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="6.27">try try try as they might fail they will</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="7.65">no free passes mainstream media cue and</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="6.02">they&amp;#39;re in a kill box so we are gonna</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="5.37">destroy the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="381.63" dur="11.85">metaphorically speaking so you have to</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="8.33">understand that there is a certain new</text>
  <text start="394" dur="5.08">technology that exists that can do these</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="4.05">things and then if you take that and put</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="3.93">it on top of how the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="401.27" dur="5.94">can spin it and then how they can spin</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="7.62">it to their dwindling but still massive</text>
  <text start="407.21" dur="5.01">swath of Americans who watch listen and</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="6.14">obey</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="4.55">that&amp;#39;s their their modus operandi for</text>
  <text start="418.15" dur="4.09">watching the news they don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="4.71">they don&amp;#39;t need or want to have critical</text>
  <text start="422.24" dur="5.25">thought when it comes to what they watch</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="4.41">they just want to be fed what it is</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="3.92">which is why I always try in my videos</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="5.79">to make you guys participate because</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="6.04">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost out of the fact that I</text>

  <text start="469.27" dur="4.81">there&amp;#39;s so much information going back</text>
  <text start="471.74" dur="4.47">and forth that they can&amp;#39;t control they</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="4.26">can&amp;#39;t control it all so I encourage you</text>

  <text start="499.52" dur="5.399">me insights like giving me insights on</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="5.43">how to speak or how to do it but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="504.919" dur="4.051">they&amp;#39;re critically analyzing what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="3.36">doing and then they&amp;#39;re giving me</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="3.509">feedback and then I&amp;#39;m gonna take that</text>

  <text start="521.51" dur="3.71">mind you because I think I&amp;#39;m doing it</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="4.61">pretty pretty well here I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="5.549">your input in that regard on a broad</text>
  <text start="528.279" dur="3.841">broad scale but it&amp;#39;s nice because you</text>
  <text start="530.769" dur="6.031">get a lot of people who come in here and</text>
  <text start="532.12" dur="6.63">say look Craig do this or I&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
