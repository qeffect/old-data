  <text start="138.69" dur="5.49">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s look at what the story is</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="3.27">here let&amp;#39;s start with the first stories</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="3.81">you guys saw President Trump in the</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="4.29">beginning talking about Iran and the you</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="4.47">know billions of dollars that were given</text>
  <text start="149.82" dur="6.06">and we got nothing we basically got</text>
  <text start="152.46" dur="6.12">absolutely zero except Iran got a bunch</text>
  <text start="155.88" dur="5.27">of cash that is untraceable that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="4.65">all we know so far about this deal but</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="5.26">apparently now we have a new story</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s coming out that is just it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="3.24">put out there for everyone</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.44">I guess president Trump has approved</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="4.44">cyber attacks against Iran after he</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="3.8">backed off of a military assault so as</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="5.34">you guys know what happened was</text>
  <text start="176" dur="5.5">President Trump was ready to basically</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="4.8">launch a counter assault after the the</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="5.58">Iranians had chosen to shoot down one of</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="5.43">our drones then subsequently after that</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="4.92">President Trump decided to not go</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="4.89">forward with that attack but rather</text>
  <text start="192" dur="3.99">approve these cyber attacks and what</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="3.45">were these cyber attacks of course we</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="4.53">have also the the Military Times</text>
  <text start="198" dur="4.62">reporting on this as well about that but</text>
  <text start="200.52" dur="4.29">what&amp;#39;s being alleged here is that the</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="5.16">cyber attacks are reportedly knocking</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="4.8">out Iranian missile control systems so</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="3.51">give to give them an idea of what our</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="3.36">capabilities are we probably just</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="3.96">knocked a bunch of their systems offline</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="4.14">so that they would understand that in</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="4.47">the event that they did go to an all-out</text>
  <text start="217.11" dur="6.15">conflict with us that it would not be a</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="5.67">competition their best and their best</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="3.9">bet at that point would be that some</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="3.72">other major country who steps in on</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="3.72">their behalf and tries to but then that</text>
  <text start="229.11" dur="3.57">would start a world war so it would</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="3.21">really depend but look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="2.73">happening with Iran they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="3.24">technology they don&amp;#39;t have the know-how</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="5.16">and they don&amp;#39;t have the skill or the</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.129">military or anything to stand a chance</text>
  <text start="240.57" dur="3.6">against us for more than a couple days</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="3.811">it would turn into an insurgency would</text>
  <text start="244.17" dur="3.84">turn exactly into what we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="246.27" dur="3.24">avoid happening which is exactly what I</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="5.699">have in Afghanistan and Iraq</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="6.75">just insurgency fighting that is endless</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="4.891">and is the worst kind and most violent</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="3.96">so that to me is is really what</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="3.24">President Trump avoided here and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="4.29">giving them a strong message saying look</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="5.46">you think that you can provoke us but</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="5.25">you you really should not do that</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="4.17">and of course you know there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="269.76" dur="3.75">story coming out I thought think it was</text>
  <text start="271.47" dur="4.02">reported on today by Jack so back over</text>
  <text start="273.51" dur="5.01">at oen he was talking about how the</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="7.17">Obama administration&amp;#39;s been engaged in</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="6.54">helping the Iranian administration</text>
  <text start="282.66" dur="4.98">figure out how to or the Iranian regime</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="5.1">figure out how to undermine US foreign</text>
  <text start="287.64" dur="3.9">policy globally and this is not really a</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="3.45">new story we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="3.99">story for a while this was back in May</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="3.69">here over on the blaze they were</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="4.29">reporting on this about former Obama</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="4.02">Michelle Obama officials currently</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="3.99">advising Iran on how to counter</text>
  <text start="301.32" dur="4.83">President Trump so this is a very common</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="3.6">practice now and the biggest problem is</text>
  <text start="306.15" dur="2.91">that you have all these different</text>
  <text start="307.41" dur="3.51">factions in fronts that are coming</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="3.45">against I wouldn&amp;#39;t just say the</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="3.6">president they&amp;#39;re coming against we the</text>
  <text start="312.51" dur="4.35">American people and our sovereign nation</text>
  <text start="314.52" dur="4.29">you have rogue actors inside of our</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="4.95">government former Obama officials who</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="6.06">are advising our enemies on how to</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="6.84">undermine our country&amp;#39;s foreign policy</text>
  <text start="324.87" dur="5.64">so think about that for a second that is</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="4.29">a violation obviously of the Logan Act</text>
  <text start="330.51" dur="3.42">if you guys were not aware but and for</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="4.26">those of you who don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="4.65">Logan Act is the Logan Act is a statute</text>
  <text start="337.2" dur="4.14">that was created by the US Congress</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="5.52">which says that a United States federal</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="4.44">law that criminalizes negotiation by</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="3.15">unauthorized persons with foreign</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="4.19">governments having a dispute with the</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="7.02">United States yes I believe that this</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="7.72">categorically fits into that fits into</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="5.16">the the violation of this act so and</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="4.5">this is the same Act I believe they went</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="5.4">after general Flynn for violating and</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="7.26">his work with Turkey where he was</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="6.69">basically helping to undermine a Turkish</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="3.63">cleric who had been protected by the</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="4.98">Clintons and the Obamas here in the</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="6.45">United States who was who was being</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="6.09">called by others basically the Osama bin</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="5.25">Laden of Turkey and this guy&amp;#39;s is no</text>
  <text start="382.59" dur="3.81">angel and he&amp;#39;s got a huge network of</text>
  <text start="384.78" dur="3.39">influence throughout our country and you</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="3.06">guys probably know him who I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="388.17" dur="4.44">about here but that&amp;#39;s a little aside to</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="5.19">where we&amp;#39;re at here this is the Logan</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="3.99">Act and this is what they&amp;#39;re saying has</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="4.65">been violated here which you know look</text>
  <text start="396.6" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going up against here</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="3.57">with you</text>
  <text start="400.32" dur="5.67">robo Amish officials currently advising</text>
  <text start="402.87" dur="4.89">arraign and this is the kind of swamp</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="3.56">that we are dealing with there in</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="7.47">Washington so I think that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="7.96">interesting to examine so here&amp;#39;s a look</text>
  <text start="415.23" dur="4.32">at what cue has told us about this in</text>
  <text start="417.51" dur="3.6">the past about Iran and and how to</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="3.33">understand what&amp;#39;s happening here and I</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="4.83">thought this was really an important few</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="5.97">posts to look at so first of all talking</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="5.1">about red cross and it says Iran and</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="4.02">Pakistan and North Korea and it says</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="3.69">define smuggle what is smuggled what</text>
  <text start="432.87" dur="3.72">funds are used to pay for the goods</text>
  <text start="434.73" dur="3.48">these people are sick relevant to the</text>
  <text start="436.59" dur="3.63">events about to unfold follow the</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="5.19">executive orders so this was back in</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="5.31">April of 2018 where Q was basically</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="4.65">showing us that there is a global</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="4.38">network of trafficking that they they</text>
  <text start="448.05" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t just traffic in anything in</text>
  <text start="449.91" dur="3.39">particularly traffic in humans they</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="3.18">trafficking drugs they trafficking</text>
  <text start="453.3" dur="4.8">weapons they trafficking more</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="6.66">specifically illicit materials for</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="7.08">weapons such as radioactive materials</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="7.23">and and other you know black market</text>
  <text start="465.18" dur="5.04">items such as bombs that exist and Q is</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="3.27">trying to explain to us that these</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="4.02">organizations are the ones that are used</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="5.04">for this kind of work and here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="474.24" dur="4.71">report out of NPR talking about how the</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="5.13">Red Cross spent 25 percent of Haiti</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="4.74">donations on internal expenses and if</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="3.33">you read through the story even further</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="3.69">it highlights the fact there are</text>
  <text start="485.52" dur="4.2">millions and millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="487.38" dur="3.9">dollars that are mismanaged and</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="5.16">unaccounted for by this organization</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="7.62">which was investigated by Senator Chuck</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="5.67">Grassley after reports had surfaced that</text>
  <text start="498.9" dur="3.48">a large majority of the money was not</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="3.33">reaching the Haitian people that was</text>
  <text start="502.38" dur="4.2">being put into this organizations</text>
  <text start="503.88" dur="5.31">control now the Red Cross is an</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="4.17">international organization whose charter</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="3.69">basically says that you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="4.02">gonna help you know keep people alive</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="3.99">and do all these great things for the</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="5.579">world but the reality is that the</text>
  <text start="516.87" dur="7.44">individuals who run it are involved in</text>
  <text start="520.349" dur="6.301">some of the most gross you know the</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="4.47">grossest most gross dereliction of duty</text>
  <text start="526.65" dur="3.87">when it comes to just accountability</text>
  <text start="528.78" dur="4.67">there is no accountability in this</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="5.569">organization there is no</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="5.22">the extensive accounting on where the</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="4.411">money goes and they basically say things</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="3.87">like well we have to cover program</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="3.87">expenses and then they put they funnel</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="4.049">money into other organizations and</text>
  <text start="544.37" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re associated with affiliated with</text>
  <text start="546.589" dur="7.861">and it&amp;#39;s basically just one big what</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="8.37">looks like a attempt to cover up a money</text>
  <text start="554.45" dur="6.12">trail for laundering money and for being</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="4.919">the type of organization that could be</text>
  <text start="560.57" dur="5.13">utilized by nefarious actors to enact</text>
  <text start="563.839" dur="4.381">human trafficking weapons trafficking</text>
  <text start="565.7" dur="5.25">drugs trafficking and all other types of</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="4.859">illicit material trafficking so what is</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="6.569">being alleged I think is that when</text>
  <text start="573.079" dur="8.01">President Trump took office he made this</text>

  <text start="581.089" dur="5.611">to shut down these global trafficking</text>
  <text start="584" dur="4.709">lanes now by doing that he has started</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="4.44">some big conflicts in countries that</text>
  <text start="588.709" dur="5.13">depend on these trafficking lanes to</text>
  <text start="591.14" dur="6.48">fund their you know clandestine illicit</text>
  <text start="593.839" dur="6.06">illegal operations and this is really I</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="5.1">think where we have to focus all of our</text>
  <text start="599.899" dur="5.971">attention because it&amp;#39;s an important</text>
  <text start="602.72" dur="5.22">point when understanding the sequence of</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="5.52">things now q even gives us an order here</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="5.91">back in April talking about the order of</text>
  <text start="611.39" dur="5.1">the events that are coming talks about</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="4.83">Saudi Arabia then North Korea then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.49" dur="4.589">Armenia and then it&amp;#39;s Iran and we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="618.68" dur="3.659">the Iran stage now and you&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="621.079" dur="3.811">yourself Armenia what happened in</text>
  <text start="622.339" dur="5.101">Armenia well they were basically freed</text>
  <text start="624.89" dur="6">according to Q when they had a new</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="5.28">election and their Minister had resigned</text>
  <text start="630.89" dur="4.23">because he was obviously an</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="4.979">anti-american in bed with these</text>
  <text start="635.12" dur="4.02">individuals and Armenia apparently plays</text>
  <text start="637.699" dur="3.121">a key role in all of this especially</text>
  <text start="639.14" dur="3.35">when you talk about the intelligence</text>
  <text start="640.82" dur="3.93">agencies and where some of their</text>
  <text start="642.49" dur="4.8">clandestine operations are run out of</text>
  <text start="644.75" dur="6.72">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re meant to look at</text>
  <text start="647.29" dur="6.01">here is a Saudi Arabia and and in the</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="3.869">order that we have here is given and</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="5.159">then it says any other rogue nuclear</text>

  <text start="658.459" dur="4.681">who is protected by rogue nuclear States</text>
  <text start="660.709" dur="4.62">trust the plan so think about this I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="663.14" dur="4.12">talked about this before these these</text>
  <text start="665.329" dur="7.591">rogue nuclear States like Noor</text>
  <text start="667.26" dur="8.37">Korea and Iran and other or other places</text>
  <text start="672.92" dur="7.48">they are the ones who are involved in</text>
  <text start="675.63" dur="7.83">this gross up this gross exploitation of</text>
  <text start="680.4" dur="4.65">the global community at large by</text>
  <text start="683.46" dur="4.59">probably clandestine intelligence</text>
  <text start="685.05" dur="6.24">agencies who have hijacked and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="688.05" dur="4.83">basically blackmailed and extorted their</text>

  <text start="692.88" dur="6.39">able to push these these bad actors if</text>
  <text start="696.78" dur="4.86">you will to become an existential threat</text>
  <text start="699.27" dur="5.01">for the global community to hold them</text>
  <text start="701.64" dur="5.52">hostage against their will and then</text>
  <text start="704.28" dur="4.5">force them to cooperate and to play the</text>
  <text start="707.16" dur="3.87">game that they want them to play and</text>
  <text start="708.78" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s when Q says you know the world is</text>
  <text start="711.03" dur="3.57">connected why our border states like</text>
  <text start="713.1" dur="4.02">Arizona California important why is</text>
  <text start="714.6" dur="6.12">Mexico vocal against POTUS those who are</text>
  <text start="717.12" dur="5.82">allowed us so this is a another one it</text>
  <text start="720.72" dur="3.51">talks about I think what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="722.94" dur="3.5">about here in general which is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.23" dur="6.18">this global trafficking network that was</text>
  <text start="726.44" dur="6.28">completely shut down as far as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="730.41" dur="3.72">going through the United States with</text>
  <text start="732.72" dur="3.57">President Trump when he took over I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="734.13" dur="4.29">sure it still exists working outside of</text>
  <text start="736.29" dur="3.75">the United States but he shut it down</text>
  <text start="738.42" dur="3.69">here and he&amp;#39;s helping other countries do</text>
  <text start="740.04" dur="3.42">the same thing and Arizona and</text>
  <text start="742.11" dur="3.42">California were important and are</text>
  <text start="743.46" dur="4.02">important because the human trafficking</text>
  <text start="745.53" dur="4.08">and the drug trafficking and and and</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="3.72">this is where you would sneak in people</text>
  <text start="749.61" dur="3.45">who want to commit atrocities against</text>
  <text start="751.2" dur="3.36">the American people this is where one of</text>
  <text start="753.06" dur="4.5">our weakest points is and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="754.56" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s today thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="757.56" dur="4.85">people coming every day illegally</text>
  <text start="760.44" dur="5.79">crossing that border and then not being</text>
  <text start="762.41" dur="8.44">deported because of our defunct legal</text>
  <text start="766.23" dur="9.42">you know or laws that exist around you</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="6.12">know Asylum and deportation so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.65" dur="3.96">where we&amp;#39;re at right now and I thought</text>
  <text start="776.97" dur="5.16">this was definitely an interesting story</text>
  <text start="779.61" dur="4.17">to cover so of course President Trump</text>
  <text start="782.13" dur="3.24">came out today and said I want to give</text>
  <text start="783.78" dur="3.9">the Democrats every last chance to</text>
  <text start="785.37" dur="5.1">quickly negotiate simple changes to</text>
  <text start="787.68" dur="4.77">asylum and loopholes this will fix the</text>
  <text start="790.47" dur="3.57">southern border together with that with</text>
  <text start="792.45" dur="3.48">the help that Mexico is now giving us</text>
  <text start="794.04" dur="3.96">probably won&amp;#39;t happen but worth a try</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="4.23">two weeks and a big deportation begins</text>
  <text start="798" dur="2.88">so this is what happened President Trump</text>
  <text start="800.16" dur="3.3">came out today and</text>
  <text start="800.88" dur="5.28">look we&amp;#39;re gonna give you a chance to</text>
  <text start="803.46" dur="5.58">get something passed through legislation</text>
  <text start="806.16" dur="4.44">because we all know very well the</text>
  <text start="809.04" dur="3.48">Democrats don&amp;#39;t want to solve this issue</text>
  <text start="810.6" dur="3.63">they don&amp;#39;t want a solution they want the</text>
  <text start="812.52" dur="3.24">issue itself so they can use it to</text>
  <text start="814.23" dur="3.63">attack president Trump so president</text>
  <text start="815.76" dur="3.81">Trump&amp;#39;s giving giving them more rope and</text>

  <text start="965.88" dur="4.05">what you have to remember is President</text>

  <text start="969.93" dur="4.14">exactly I apologize for that picture the</text>
  <text start="972.42" dur="4.44">disturbing photo that we had to just</text>
  <text start="974.07" dur="4.95">look at but um now they&amp;#39;re saying Oh</text>
  <text start="976.86" dur="4.2">Nancy Pelosi called Trump on Friday and</text>
  <text start="979.02" dur="4.71">asked him if he would call off the ice</text>

  <text start="983.73" dur="4.56">to stick with but we have a new report</text>
  <text start="985.68" dur="3.99">coming out of course today that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="988.29" dur="3.69">talking about yesterday I should say</text>
  <text start="989.67" dur="6.42">talking about how officials are accusing</text>
  <text start="991.98" dur="6.99">the DHS chief Kevin McHale II makayley</text>
  <text start="996.09" dur="5.97">then I can&amp;#39;t say the name for some</text>
  <text start="998.97" dur="5.7">reason of leaking ice raids plans to</text>
  <text start="1002.06" dur="6.09">sabotage the operation so this is coming</text>
  <text start="1004.67" dur="6.27">out report from the Washington Examiner</text>
  <text start="1008.15" dur="6.03">here but apparently some high-level</text>
  <text start="1010.94" dur="8.25">sources are telling the the news right</text>
  <text start="1014.18" dur="7.53">now that Kevin McHale Lehmann is the one</text>
  <text start="1019.19" dur="4.86">who tried to sabotage the efforts of the</text>
  <text start="1021.71" dur="4.05">president by leaking the ice rape plans</text>
  <text start="1024.05" dur="4.65">and this is kind of verified when you</text>
  <text start="1025.76" dur="6.21">look at the fact that there were stories</text>
  <text start="1028.7" dur="6.81">out that existed that showed like this</text>
  <text start="1031.97" dur="5.19">here Jim Hoff saying that a far left and</text>
  <text start="1035.51" dur="3.78">this is over a gateway Punnett because a</text>
  <text start="1037.16" dur="5.49">the story came out about a far left</text>

  <text start="1044.54" dur="5.1">illegal aliens in Mesa Arizona yesterday</text>
  <text start="1047.12" dur="5.94">so what I believe happened is if these</text>
  <text start="1049.64" dur="6.24">locations were leaked then the leftist</text>
  <text start="1053.06" dur="4.5">started organizing and forming parties</text>
  <text start="1055.88" dur="4.08">and you know putting people in the</text>
  <text start="1057.56" dur="3.54">places where they were where they knew</text>
  <text start="1059.96" dur="2.28">the rates were gonna happen so they</text>
  <text start="1061.1" dur="3.18">could get film of it</text>
  <text start="1062.24" dur="4.11">so they could politicize the film and go</text>
  <text start="1064.28" dur="3.84">after the president that way and I think</text>
  <text start="1066.35" dur="3.69">President Trump realized that</text>
  <text start="1068.12" dur="4.32">that would actually put the lives of</text>

  <text start="1169.55" dur="6.15">be held accountable for that I think so</text>
  <text start="1174.2" dur="3.359">obviously this talks about the different</text>
  <text start="1175.7" dur="4.77">places and of course Chicago is one of</text>
  <text start="1177.559" dur="4.921">the ones where these progressive you</text>
  <text start="1180.47" dur="4.35">know ultra progressive super extreme</text>
  <text start="1182.48" dur="4.59">leftists come forward and say you know</text>
  <text start="1184.82" dur="8.46">we&amp;#39;re gonna protect people who are here</text>
  <text start="1187.07" dur="8.13">illegally what I mean besides the fact</text>
  <text start="1193.28" dur="3.87">that it&amp;#39;s illegal I mean I know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1195.2" dur="4.32">a there&amp;#39;s not a consensus of people who</text>
  <text start="1197.15" dur="4.56">are supporting this these are just you</text>
  <text start="1199.52" dur="6.24">know entranced bureaucrats who have</text>
  <text start="1201.71" dur="8.1">you know basically made these you know</text>
  <text start="1205.76" dur="5.76">deep blue bastions where they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1209.81" dur="3.45">voted out of office and if anything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1211.52" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s a choice between you know an</text>
  <text start="1213.26" dur="4.8">extreme leftist or an extreme extreme</text>
  <text start="1215.42" dur="5.91">leftist as in the case of the Chicago</text>
  <text start="1218.06" dur="5.43">mayoral race but this is what happens</text>
  <text start="1221.33" dur="3.57">and they are continuing to destroy this</text>
  <text start="1223.49" dur="2.97">country and speaking of that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1224.9" dur="3.53">another story that come that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="1226.46" dur="6.78">out that I think we should talk about</text>
  <text start="1228.43" dur="7.33">with specific regard to organ organs of</text>
  <text start="1233.24" dur="6.87">issuing arrest warrants for multiple GOP</text>
  <text start="1235.76" dur="6.45">senators now this is truly terrifying</text>
  <text start="1240.11" dur="6.03">this is dystopian this is Orwellian this</text>
  <text start="1242.21" dur="7.02">is some sort of you know fascistic move</text>
  <text start="1246.14" dur="5.04">by the government of Oregon it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="1249.23" dur="3.93">specifically the leftist government of</text>
  <text start="1251.18" dur="5.43">Oregon which has ordered the arrest</text>
  <text start="1253.16" dur="6.48">warrant of these Oregon state senators</text>
  <text start="1256.61" dur="5.1">for deciding to flee the state to avoid</text>
  <text start="1259.64" dur="4.56">voting on a devastating cap-and-trade</text>
  <text start="1261.71" dur="4.55">bill so basically what happened here is</text>
  <text start="1264.2" dur="6.42">here&amp;#39;s an example of your typical</text>
  <text start="1266.26" dur="7.84">Oregonian leftist Democrat with their</text>
  <text start="1270.62" dur="5.7">you know inclusion and the you know</text>
  <text start="1274.1" dur="4.38">their desire for equality of outcome not</text>
  <text start="1276.32" dur="3.42">a quality of opportunity equality of</text>
  <text start="1278.48" dur="2.94">outcome that&amp;#39;s what they want because</text>
  <text start="1279.74" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re socialists they&amp;#39;re fascists</text>
  <text start="1281.42" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re authoritarians and they want to</text>
  <text start="1283.31" dur="3.93">destroy this country but with that being</text>
  <text start="1285.77" dur="3.39">said it says fed up with a Democrat</text>
  <text start="1287.24" dur="3.51">super majority help and on destroying</text>
  <text start="1289.16" dur="3.12">the state&amp;#39;s economy with a disastrous</text>
  <text start="1290.75" dur="4.68">cap-and-trade bill that combines the</text>
  <text start="1292.28" dur="5.25">worst climate change hopes data into</text>
  <text start="1295.43" dur="4.62">legislation to devastate businesses all</text>
  <text start="1297.53" dur="4.74">eleven Republican senators have fled org</text>
  <text start="1300.05" dur="4.11">and to deprive them of a quorum needed</text>
  <text start="1302.27" dur="5.01">to conduct a vote now I think this is</text>
  <text start="1304.16" dur="4.47">great and apparent according to them</text>
  <text start="1307.28" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re gonna wait this out until I</text>
  <text start="1308.63" dur="5.34">think it&amp;#39;s the end of June is when the</text>
  <text start="1311.63" dur="5.04">the session will be over because this</text>
  <text start="1313.97" dur="6.36">bill according to them and from what</text>
  <text start="1316.67" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;ve seen in read about it they it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1320.33" dur="3.57">terrible bill it is the kind of bill</text>
  <text start="1322.16" dur="5.27">that would destroy business it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1323.9" dur="6.12">kind of bill that embraces the wild</text>
  <text start="1327.43" dur="5.95">unverified speculative science of</text>
  <text start="1330.02" dur="5.01">climate change and it really embraces</text>
  <text start="1333.38" dur="5.26">some of the most left</text>
  <text start="1335.03" dur="5.14">ideologies when it comes to fixing these</text>
  <text start="1338.64" dur="2.61">problems when you look at things like</text>
  <text start="1340.17" dur="4.02">the green New Deal</text>
  <text start="1341.25" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s the same type of business killer</text>
  <text start="1344.19" dur="6.18">that that was because it it&amp;#39;s almost the</text>
  <text start="1347.97" dur="4.23">same kind of legislation so all eleven</text>
  <text start="1350.37" dur="4.68">Republican state senators just left</text>
  <text start="1352.2" dur="5.1">and then the government freaked out</text>
  <text start="1355.05" dur="4.71">because they couldn&amp;#39;t call a quorum and</text>
  <text start="1357.3" dur="4.95">a quorum is you have to have X amount of</text>
  <text start="1359.76" dur="4.56">people participating in the vote in</text>
  <text start="1362.25" dur="4.86">order for the vote to count that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1364.32" dur="5.61">how these how government works so if you</text>
  <text start="1367.11" dur="4.65">if all the the Republican state senators</text>
  <text start="1369.93" dur="3.57">just leave then they don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="1371.76" dur="3.9">people to make a quorum so they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1373.5" dur="4.64">vote on it so what do they do they ask</text>
  <text start="1375.66" dur="5.1">the governor to issue arrest warrants</text>
  <text start="1378.14" dur="5.26">against these senators and to get the</text>
  <text start="1380.76" dur="4.23">state police involved I think the State</text>
  <text start="1383.4" dur="3.39">Highway Patrol involved in trying to</text>
  <text start="1384.99" dur="4.92">track them down and bring them back now</text>
  <text start="1386.79" dur="5.31">this is Orwellian this is dystopic this</text>
  <text start="1389.91" dur="4.23">is the worst kind of fistic</text>
  <text start="1392.1" dur="4.77">authoritarianism you can imagine you</text>
  <text start="1394.14" dur="4.56">have these extreme leftists in in</text>
  <text start="1396.87" dur="3.66">government who are issuing arrest</text>
  <text start="1398.7" dur="4.32">warrants for sitting politicians and</text>
  <text start="1400.53" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re not taking it very well one of</text>
  <text start="1403.02" dur="4.5">the Oregon senators has said basically</text>
  <text start="1405.18" dur="4.17">come heavily-armed he threatens violence</text>
  <text start="1407.52" dur="3.36">as governor hunts down lawmakers and</text>
  <text start="1409.35" dur="4.14">everyone&amp;#39;s freaking out and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1410.88" dur="4.05">militias involved but this is crazy so a</text>
  <text start="1413.49" dur="4.29">standoff between Republican Democrat</text>
  <text start="1414.93" dur="4.02">Oregon sent state senators escalated on</text>
  <text start="1417.78" dur="2.94">Friday after governor Kate brown</text>
  <text start="1418.95" dur="3.27">authorized state police to track down</text>
  <text start="1420.72" dur="3.78">Republican lawmakers who have stalled a</text>
  <text start="1422.22" dur="5.73">vote on carbon credit legislation by</text>
  <text start="1424.5" dur="5.22">walking out refusing to vote and then</text>
  <text start="1427.95" dur="3.09">here&amp;#39;s a better explanation of the</text>
  <text start="1429.72" dur="3.21">cap-and-trade bill and what it would</text>
  <text start="1431.04" dur="3.54">propose it says under the proposed cap</text>
  <text start="1432.93" dur="3.27">and trade bill Oregon would put an</text>
  <text start="1434.58" dur="4.26">overall limit on greenhouse gas</text>
  <text start="1436.2" dur="4.2">emissions and auction of pollution</text>
  <text start="1438.84" dur="3.27">allowances for each ton of carbon</text>
  <text start="1440.4" dur="3.18">industries planned to admit the</text>
  <text start="1442.11" dur="2.97">legislation would lower that cap over</text>
  <text start="1443.58" dur="3.51">time encourage businesses to move away</text>
  <text start="1445.08" dur="3.66">from fossil fuels the state would reduce</text>
  <text start="1447.09" dur="6.45">emissions by forty five percent below</text>
  <text start="1448.74" dur="7.41">1990 levels in 2035 and by 2035 and 80</text>
  <text start="1453.54" dur="4.38">percent by a below 1990 levels by 2050</text>
  <text start="1456.15" dur="3.69">those opposed to the cap-and-trade</text>
  <text start="1457.92" dur="3.57">plants say it would exacerbate a growing</text>
  <text start="1459.84" dur="3.84">divide between the liberal urban parts</text>
  <text start="1461.49" dur="4.08">of the state in the rural areas the plan</text>
  <text start="1463.68" dur="3.33">would increase the cost of fuel damaging</text>
  <text start="1465.57" dur="2.14">small businesses truckers and logging</text>
  <text start="1467.01" dur="2.35">industry they</text>
  <text start="1467.71" dur="3.54">okay that&amp;#39;s just one of the many reasons</text>
  <text start="1469.36" dur="4.08">that that bill would not work and why</text>
  <text start="1471.25" dur="4.14">the senators are not really excited to</text>
  <text start="1473.44" dur="3.81">get into it but here&amp;#39;s what I want to</text>
  <text start="1475.39" dur="5.519">play for you I&amp;#39;m gonna play this video</text>

  <text start="1480.909" dur="5.52">the senators who is very very upset</text>
  <text start="1484.36" dur="4.62">about being tracked down by the police</text>
  <text start="1486.429" dur="6.841">and he has he wants to give them a piece</text>
