  <text start="869.24" dur="3.87">have this whistleblower come publicly</text>
  <text start="871.249" dur="4.5">testify in front of Congress is it</text>
  <text start="873.11" dur="4.68">perhaps because he recognizes fully that</text>
  <text start="875.749" dur="3.96">this is all a publicity stunt this is</text>
  <text start="877.79" dur="3.479">all an attempt to change in there this</text>
  <text start="879.709" dur="3.151">is an attempt to smear the president</text>
  <text start="881.269" dur="4.05">this is an attempt to undermine his</text>
  <text start="882.86" dur="4.829">administration but by using these deep</text>
  <text start="885.319" dur="4.02">state plans to just keep popping up</text>

  <text start="891.379" dur="6.421">something that if taken out of context</text>
  <text start="895.279" dur="4.41">could sound bad but maybe in context of</text>
  <text start="897.8" dur="4.68">President Trump and his negotiating</text>
  <text start="899.689" dur="4.95">tactics may make sense I mean let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="902.48" dur="3.449">ask these questions right and if you</text>
  <text start="904.639" dur="2.43">have to if you have you asked those</text>
  <text start="905.929" dur="3.09">questions and you try to be objective</text>
  <text start="907.069" dur="3.901">than yes what he&amp;#39;s saying here is just</text>
  <text start="909.019" dur="3.57">there could have been a crime committed</text>
  <text start="910.97" dur="3.719">maybe the Inspector General the crime</text>
  <text start="912.589" dur="3.48">identified was that this guy who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.689" dur="2.791">leaking it did it illegally because</text>
  <text start="916.069" dur="2.88">there was nothing to whistleblower if</text>
  <text start="917.48" dur="2.94">there&amp;#39;s no there there and this guy</text>
  <text start="918.949" dur="2.401">thinks he&amp;#39;s a whistleblower coming</text>
  <text start="920.42" dur="2.339">forward I mean we want to have</text>
  <text start="921.35" dur="4.62">protections for these people but at the</text>
  <text start="922.759" dur="4.95">same time we don&amp;#39;t want Joe deep state</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="4.02">to just come out of the woodwork every</text>
  <text start="927.709" dur="6.461">time president Trump starts going after</text>
  <text start="929.99" dur="5.74">these swamp creatures right</text>
  <text start="934.17" dur="3.57">make sense to me not to mention the fact</text>
  <text start="935.73" dur="4.77">that Trump&amp;#39;s having to sue the Manhattan</text>
  <text start="937.74" dur="5.31">da after they are trying to subpoena is</text>
  <text start="940.5" dur="5.339">tax returns so you have the Manhattan da</text>
  <text start="943.05" dur="5.789">trying to attack the president Trump</text>
  <text start="945.839" dur="5.19">he&amp;#39;s being attacked on every front right</text>
  <text start="948.839" dur="4.44">now and the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="951.029" dur="2.971">complicit on it they&amp;#39;re piling on their</text>
  <text start="953.279" dur="2.041">dogpiling</text>
  <text start="954" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s why we have to continue to</text>
  <text start="955.32" dur="4.92">support the president&amp;#39;s stand up against</text>
  <text start="956.91" dur="5.94">this not to mention the fact that what</text>
  <text start="960.24" dur="5.01">district does Adam Schiff represent</text>
  <text start="962.85" dur="4.289">speaking of Adam Schiff the twenty</text>
  <text start="965.25" dur="4.11">eighth congressional district well what</text>
  <text start="967.139" dur="4.44">does that include oh it includes West</text>
  <text start="969.36" dur="4.169">Hollywood now who is a famous Democrat</text>
  <text start="971.579" dur="4.94">donor who was just arrested out of West</text>

  <text start="983.69" dur="7">drug peddlers dem donor Edie bucks just</text>
  <text start="987.6" dur="5.76">arrested after a third man has overdosed</text>

  <text start="994.86" dur="3.57">drug house right in Adams shifts</text>
  <text start="996.72" dur="4.08">district so these are the kind of</text>
  <text start="998.43" dur="5.79">Democrat donors who put Adam Schiff in</text>
  <text start="1000.8" dur="4.89">his position presumably I can&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1004.22" dur="3.45">go look and see if that buck directly</text>
  <text start="1005.69" dur="4.53">donated to Adam Schiff but I know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1007.67" dur="4.44">donated to the Democratic Party and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1010.22" dur="5.059">sure it Lyle that money has found its</text>
  <text start="1012.11" dur="7.38">way madam shifts coffers and campaign</text>
  <text start="1015.279" dur="6.101">funds so think about that think about</text>
  <text start="1019.49" dur="4.11">what who these people represent and what</text>
  <text start="1021.38" dur="3.63">they represent and then ask yourself are</text>
  <text start="1023.6" dur="2.79">they the people we should be trusting</text>
  <text start="1025.01" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s my question</text>
  <text start="1026.39" dur="5.069">not to mention what President Trump just</text>
  <text start="1028.88" dur="3.72">gave us the other day I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="1031.459" dur="3.421">catch up on all this because I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1032.6" dur="4.14">out for a while House Judiciary had has</text>
  <text start="1034.88" dur="3.51">given up on the molar reports and this</text>
  <text start="1036.74" dur="4.53">is from president Ramona read this from</text>
  <text start="1038.39" dur="5.88">president from Twitter House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="1041.27" dur="4.71">has given up on the molar report sadly</text>

  <text start="1047.72" dur="4.32">your obstruction so they say okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1049.79" dur="3.84">look at everything else all of the deals</text>
  <text start="1052.04" dur="4.23">that Trump has done over his lifetime</text>
  <text start="1053.63" dur="4.679">right but it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way I</text>
  <text start="1056.27" dur="4.649">have a better idea look at the Obama</text>
  <text start="1058.309" dur="4.771">book deal at or the ridiculous netflix</text>
  <text start="1060.919" dur="4.701">deal then look at all the deals made by</text>
  <text start="1063.08" dur="4.88">the Dems in Congress and the</text>
  <text start="1065.62" dur="4.47">or that by the Dems in Congress the</text>
  <text start="1067.96" dur="5.46">quote-unquote congressional slush fund</text>
  <text start="1070.09" dur="3.63">and lastly the IG reports take a look at</text>
  <text start="1073.42" dur="2.37">them</text>
  <text start="1073.72" dur="6.12">those amaze investigations would be over</text>
  <text start="1075.79" dur="6.21">fast so what are you saying here is that</text>
  <text start="1079.84" dur="4.14">nobody wants to look at the other side</text>
  <text start="1082" dur="4.11">they want to dig in the president Trump</text>
  <text start="1083.98" dur="5.49">until they find one instance where he</text>
  <text start="1086.11" dur="6.449">you know didn&amp;#39;t report a $1,000 tax</text>
  <text start="1089.47" dur="5.07">break or something that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1092.559" dur="4.261">going for this is the insanity a crime</text>
  <text start="1094.54" dur="4.38">that wouldn&amp;#39;t even be punishable by jail</text>
  <text start="1096.82" dur="4.83">time it would be like a fine and saying</text>
  <text start="1098.92" dur="5.25">like don&amp;#39;t do that again or you could</text>
  <text start="1101.65" dur="5.01">just refile the paperwork and say okay I</text>
  <text start="1104.17" dur="3.69">messed up here right these are the kind</text>
  <text start="1106.66" dur="2.97">of crimes that we&amp;#39;re trying to get into</text>
  <text start="1107.86" dur="4.38">when we go into president Trump&amp;#39;s tax</text>

  <text start="1112.24" dur="3.84">prove that if you can&amp;#39;t prove certain</text>
  <text start="1114.04" dur="4.29">intent and certain air in certain areas</text>
  <text start="1116.08" dur="5.34">in the crime is just a financial</text>
  <text start="1118.33" dur="5.13">oversight it&amp;#39;s not really the crime of</text>
  <text start="1121.42" dur="4.02">the century here right it&amp;#39;s not like on</text>
  <text start="1123.46" dur="5.79">the other side of the aisle where you</text>
  <text start="1125.44" dur="5.76">have incredible corruption and it leads</text>
  <text start="1129.25" dur="4.59">into this story so why does this look</text>
  <text start="1131.2" dur="5.67">relieved in this story the Obamas book</text>
  <text start="1133.84" dur="5.43">deal and the Netflix deal how did that</text>
  <text start="1136.87" dur="3.12">all come to be we know about Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1139.27" dur="2.7">book deal</text>

  <text start="1659.779" dur="4.441">among them are those who worm their way</text>
  <text start="1661.85" dur="5.88">into households and capture Idol women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1664.22" dur="6.269">women burdened down with sins led along</text>
  <text start="1667.73" dur="5.25">by a variety of passions always learning</text>
  <text start="1670.489" dur="4.231">and never able to come to a knowledge of</text>
  <text start="1672.98" dur="6.57">the truth</text>
  <text start="1674.72" dur="6.81">so what this is saying in my opinion is</text>
  <text start="1679.55" dur="3.33">pretty simple these are the things we</text>
  <text start="1681.53" dur="4.05">have to avoid but these are the things</text>
  <text start="1682.88" dur="5.1">that are promoted by the society in</text>
  <text start="1685.58" dur="5.46">which we live we have to be children of</text>
  <text start="1687.98" dur="5.55">God and remember to avoid these people</text>
  <text start="1691.04" dur="4.98">those who engage in these behaviors and</text>
  <text start="1693.53" dur="5.04">actions are those who we have to try to</text>
  <text start="1696.02" dur="5.19">distance ourselves from and if we are</text>
  <text start="1698.57" dur="4.59">guilty of these things ourselves we have</text>
  <text start="1701.21" dur="3.99">to look to God and we have to ask God</text>
  <text start="1703.16" dur="4.32">for forgiveness and ask God to give us a</text>
  <text start="1705.2" dur="4.83">path forward we&amp;#39;re imperfect we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1707.48" dur="7.02">have mistakes along the way no none of</text>
  <text start="1710.03" dur="6.99">us are by any means going to be</text>
  <text start="1714.5" dur="4.65">successful without stumbling along the</text>
  <text start="1717.02" dur="4.14">way but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you have</text>
  <text start="1719.15" dur="4.11">to give up that means you have to</text>
  <text start="1721.16" dur="4.44">recognize that these things are what are</text>
  <text start="1723.26" dur="3.96">holding you back right they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="1725.6" dur="4.47">us all back and we have to relinquish</text>
  <text start="1727.22" dur="5.31">ourselves to God and let God help us</text>
  <text start="1730.07" dur="4.98">find a way forward and how do you do</text>
  <text start="1732.53" dur="5.37">that it&amp;#39;s simple just say a prayer open</text>
  <text start="1735.05" dur="5.37">your heart up to God look we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1737.9" dur="5.55">going to stumble on this path that God</text>
  <text start="1740.42" dur="5.6">has laid for us but that stumble may be</text>
  <text start="1743.45" dur="8.18">a part of your</text>
  <text start="1746.02" dur="9.39">journey to finding your true path so</text>
  <text start="1751.63" dur="6.2">embrace embrace adversity by looking to</text>
  <text start="1755.41" dur="5.73">God and asking God for direction and</text>
  <text start="1757.83" dur="6.28">when we come into difficult times like</text>
  <text start="1761.14" dur="5.61">that which are described here remind</text>
  <text start="1764.11" dur="6.99">yourself to avoid those people and</text>
  <text start="1766.75" dur="6.66">remind yourselves that those who do this</text>
  <text start="1771.1" dur="6.15">will never be able to come to the true</text>
  <text start="1773.41" dur="5.19">knowledge which is the truth of God so</text>
  <text start="1777.25" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s pretty much where I&amp;#39;m gonna leave</text>
