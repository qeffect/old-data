  <text start="88.59" dur="6.66">interview right here with mark all right</text>
  <text start="92.97" dur="4.2">mark it&amp;#39;s Craig from just informed talk</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="3.39">so why don&amp;#39;t you start off by telling us</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="20.97">a little bit about what you do in an</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="21.45">intro to the problem since we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="6.63">non-government employees working on</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="10.619">policy we&amp;#39;re pointed to two-year a basic</text>
  <text start="124.77" dur="17.4">executive approval the other members and</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="14.431">then a couple years back numbers and</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="5.88">what we were doing is planning to</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="5.37">replace the phone system from the</text>
  <text start="148.05" dur="6.03">existing landline system we needed to</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="5.059">find a universal identifier because the</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="5.73">phone numbers are going to run out by</text>
  <text start="155.569" dur="7.051">2024 so we&amp;#39;re looking for universal</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="4.319">identifiers so I was looking for a</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="3.85">solution for this</text>
  <text start="164.129" dur="4.44">so of course and my research I had to</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="5.67">contact everyone who used the unique</text>
  <text start="168.569" dur="6.091">identifiers which led me to the Security</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="6.03">Administration which led me to the IRS</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="6.51">which leads our registration which led</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="6.51">me to zip code just about every</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="5.399">organization just to get reference and I</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="5.309">was quite surprised when I talked to</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="5.84">these Security Administration and they</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="4.92">told me absolutely positively that</text>
  <text start="192.409" dur="4.871">social security numbers could not be</text>
  <text start="194.909" dur="4.41">used or unique identifiers not only</text>
  <text start="197.28" dur="4.129">because legal purposes for security</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="7.021">purposes but for this year fact that</text>
  <text start="201.409" dur="8.381">they received millions of duplicate</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="5.16">social security utilizations being used</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="4.169">under different names for multiple</text>
  <text start="211.5" dur="4.5">people throughout the US and they would</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="6.17">hit the IRS I got basically the same</text>
  <text start="216" dur="7.65">thing their identifier systems were</text>
  <text start="220.129" dur="5.561">equally as bad but what surprised me</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="3.809">though and as I started doing more</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="3.81">research as to that really confused and</text>
  <text start="227.459" dur="3.84">then also when I got to the voter</text>
  <text start="229.5" dur="6.269">registry also I talked to the voter</text>
  <text start="231.299" dur="7.381">registrar as well I had the Virginia</text>
  <text start="235.769" dur="6.771">voter register and what really surprised</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="3.86">me was that the IRS</text>
  <text start="242.689" dur="6.671">used to get duplicate</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="6.511">security numbers with a different order</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="5.37">to secure never didn&amp;#39;t match a name for</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="4.139">employment and they might get five six</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="2.999">thousand per year and they&amp;#39;re mainly</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.56">people women who had gotten married</text>
  <text start="257.729" dur="4.651">never got to change their name when they</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="5.881">had their workforce</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="8.24">and now it&amp;#39;s up to you know millions per</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="10.5">year now like around 12 million per year</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="11.77">the IRS changed their software in order</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="7.86">to allow people to file w2 reports with</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="7.74">a different name with a known stolen</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="8.37">said security number and the IRS deems</text>
  <text start="290.13" dur="5.43">this is not a crime as long as the soul</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="6.39">and Social Security number was only used</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="7.86">for a purpose of employment so they said</text>
  <text start="299.67" dur="5.79">the IRS is actually facilitating the</text>
  <text start="303.42" dur="5.31">ability for people for identity theft</text>
  <text start="305.46" dur="4.95">and at the same time they&amp;#39;re enabling</text>
  <text start="308.73" dur="6.33">people to basically hide their</text>
  <text start="310.41" dur="6.39">identities in work now the IRS then</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="4.08">whenever they find this they were there</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="6.6">under a requirement that they have to</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="6.72">report a duplicate security number or</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="6.33">what&amp;#39;s called a mismatch to the Social</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="6.33">Security Administration so the Security</text>
  <text start="329.73" dur="7.17">Administration at that point was</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="6.48">required to send a mismatch letter out</text>
  <text start="336.9" dur="4.98">to the employer to say hey something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="8">wrong corrected and the same time knows</text>
  <text start="341.88" dur="8.19">back in 2007 were started to be used for</text>
  <text start="346.67" dur="11.32">DHS to look for illegal aliens who work</text>
  <text start="350.07" dur="11.01">in the United States in 2009 the</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="6.54">Department of Homeland Security was</text>
  <text start="361.08" dur="6.33">ordered to stop using those for mismatch</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="5.64">to find aliens and at the same time the</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="5.1">Social Security Administration was</text>
  <text start="370.17" dur="6.18">ordered to stop sending out notices to</text>
  <text start="372.51" dur="5.31">employers for mismatched letters now</text>
  <text start="376.35" dur="3.93">since then the Social Security</text>
  <text start="377.82" dur="4.83">Administration has changed their policy</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="4.05">and they&amp;#39;ve now stopped sending out the</text>
  <text start="382.65" dur="6.33">letters under the paperwork reduction</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="8.06">Act so basically right now the IRS is</text>
  <text start="388.98" dur="5.88">profiting rather heavily from this</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="5.38">estimation right now is it&amp;#39;s closed</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="5.13">to the amount of revenue that has come</text>
  <text start="397.77" dur="5.88">in because each one of these w-2s</text>
  <text start="399.99" dur="4.859">the IRS knows that say your social</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="4.59">security number your name and your</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="5.011">address and your employer ID they know</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s you and they&amp;#39;ve written their</text>
  <text start="409.86" dur="4.44">software to identify anyone who&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="412.86" dur="4.26">or stolen your social security number</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="4.519">for employment purposes even when their</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="5.549">name they&amp;#39;ve written their software to</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="4.991">not have that show up in newer taxes as</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="4.261">to what you&amp;#39;re supposed to pay for</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="5.099">income and then the withholdings that</text>
  <text start="426.93" dur="4.47">get sent in from that are kept by the</text>
  <text start="428.909" dur="4.681">IRS because obviously the people who put</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="4.669">it in are never going to get and that</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="6.299">goes into a file called an e SF file</text>
  <text start="436.069" dur="7.541">that es f file right now is almost a</text>
  <text start="439.889" dur="5.821">trillion dollars that the IRS has in a</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="5.839">slush fund so maybe you can give us an</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="3.739">idea of like where that money goes</text>
  <text start="450.62" dur="6.519">it&amp;#39;s growing constantly because all this</text>
  <text start="453.779" dur="5.04">money&amp;#39;s coming in now what the IRS is</text>
  <text start="457.139" dur="4.231">doing with it is they&amp;#39;re just holding it</text>
  <text start="458.819" dur="5.1">because they said in case someone you</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="5.699">know claims it but currently all that</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="7.92">money is sitting there now if they allow</text>
  <text start="467.069" dur="7.41">illegal aliens to basically become</text>
  <text start="471.839" dur="4.76">citizens or to start working then they</text>
  <text start="474.479" dur="4.44">can actually claim all that money back</text>
  <text start="476.599" dur="5.261">you know for that because they work even</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="6.86">if it was under stolen premises but in</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="6.739">reality the the IRS should not be able</text>
  <text start="485.779" dur="4.66">just because the IRS does not consider</text>
  <text start="488.599" dur="3.79">someone stealing your social security</text>
  <text start="490.439" dur="4.59">number and filling out government forms</text>
  <text start="492.389" dur="6.09">as false information even though they do</text>
  <text start="495.029" dur="5.401">not consider it a crime or breaking in</text>
  <text start="498.479" dur="2.72">your rules that&amp;#39;s not really up to the</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="3.659">IRS</text>
  <text start="501.199" dur="4.21">it was a law against stealing and using</text>
  <text start="504.089" dur="4.11">someone&amp;#39;s social security number that</text>
  <text start="505.409" dur="6.87">has nothing to do with the IRS let us do</text>
  <text start="508.199" dur="5.911">it justice farm and justice should go</text>
  <text start="512.279" dur="4.221">after these guys I mean this is this is</text>
  <text start="514.11" dur="4.91">one this would be one the largest-ever</text>
  <text start="516.5" dur="6.33">cases of identity theft</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="8.58">now years ago I was involved in the</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="7.71">first well I got brought in to do some</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="7.26">work for a case that came in with the</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="6.359">FBI and I was able to identify some from</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="3.66">data and the start of the project called</text>
  <text start="536.899" dur="4.5">innocent images and in that particular</text>
  <text start="538.52" dur="6.36">one that was one of the largest amount</text>
  <text start="541.399" dur="5.401">of missing multi-jurisdictional arrests</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="6.74">in the US history and then that case</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="7.74">ended up for the reason that the</text>
  <text start="551.62" dur="5.05">Quantico cyber division got found it is</text>
  <text start="554.54" dur="4.859">that it&amp;#39;s even on their website about</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="5.37">that case and how they got their funding</text>
  <text start="559.399" dur="5.88">and this one right now</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="5.25">and I&amp;#39;m looking at this is this is huge</text>
  <text start="565.279" dur="4.951">this is the largest amount of identity</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="5.7">theft of cases of identity theft that</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="4.77">could be incidents because the ef-s file</text>
  <text start="572.99" dur="3.75">which control contains all the</text>
  <text start="575" dur="4.08">information of all these duplicate</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="4.77">numbers that people have been working at</text>
  <text start="579.08" dur="3.96">it knows where they work at it knows the</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="5.01">name that they&amp;#39;ve given to their</text>
  <text start="583.04" dur="6.12">employer and so we&amp;#39;re looking at you</text>
  <text start="586.52" dur="4.23">know going after it Justice Department</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="2.97">go after it because it is a crime you</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="3.18">can&amp;#39;t steal someone&amp;#39;s social security</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="4.47">number you can&amp;#39;t lie on government</text>
  <text start="593.93" dur="4.98">documents and forms and so this is</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="4.14">something justice is just jump at now</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="4.02">granted not all these will be illegal</text>
  <text start="600.74" dur="5.159">citizens that are in the country but I</text>
  <text start="602.93" dur="5.13">would say the lion&amp;#39;s share is but the</text>
  <text start="605.899" dur="4.621">interesting thing about this is if</text>
  <text start="608.06" dur="4.5">justice went after this you wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="610.52" dur="3.629">going after illegal immigrants you&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="612.56" dur="4.08">going after people who&amp;#39;ve stolen</text>
  <text start="614.149" dur="4.411">identity which is one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="616.64" dur="5.55">steps so our biggest thefts that are</text>
  <text start="618.56" dur="5.7">going on right now and so in going after</text>
  <text start="622.19" dur="3.45">these people who have stolen people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.26" dur="3.99">Social Security numbers stolen this</text>
  <text start="625.64" dur="4.17">information left or right would not</text>
  <text start="628.25" dur="3.51">become the left would not complain</text>
  <text start="629.81" dur="5.76">because this is just going after</text>
  <text start="631.76" dur="5.67">identity theft and so this is something</text>
  <text start="635.57" dur="3.6">that justice to jump on it&amp;#39;s not a left</text>
  <text start="637.43" dur="4.14">or right issue it&amp;#39;s someone has stolen</text>
  <text start="639.17" dur="4.409">someone&amp;#39;s identity and those are</text>
  <text start="641.57" dur="3.32">something you know identity theft is</text>
  <text start="643.579" dur="4.671">rampant in the US</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="6.45">and the FBI I mean excuse me the IRS</text>
  <text start="648.25" dur="5.28">should not be able to just ignore that</text>
  <text start="651.34" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s illegal activity going on and</text>
  <text start="653.53" dur="3.6">saying that they&amp;#39;re not gonna do</text>
  <text start="654.61" dur="4.11">anything because they consider theft</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="6.96">device that there was social security</text>
  <text start="658.72" dur="9.45">number for employment not that not a</text>
  <text start="664.09" dur="5.49">crime so basically they&amp;#39;re running on</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="3">the premise you know they just want to</text>
  <text start="669.58" dur="3.75">make the money they don&amp;#39;t care where it</text>
  <text start="671.17" dur="4.08">comes from or how it gets there they are</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="4.29">basically turning a blind eye to the</text>
  <text start="675.25" dur="3.84">illegal immigrants who use other</text>
  <text start="677.62" dur="3.81">people&amp;#39;s Social Security numbers so that</text>
  <text start="679.09" dur="4.02">they can skim off the top of that would</text>
  <text start="681.43" dur="4.59">take the money that they know that will</text>
  <text start="683.11" dur="4.62">never get claimed yeah I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.02" dur="3.9">part of it I think the other part is is</text>
  <text start="687.73" dur="6.21">that they don&amp;#39;t rock the boat on to</text>
  <text start="689.92" dur="5.28">cheap labor no of course yeah yeah so I</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="5.55">think that I think it&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="9.17">both you know and if you&amp;#39;ve ever worked</text>
  <text start="699.49" dur="8.07">in the government to be able to change</text>
  <text start="704.37" dur="6.28">software on a machine and get some with</text>
  <text start="707.56" dur="5.94">the right code to change the software I</text>
  <text start="710.65" dur="5.87">would say the IRS in their master file</text>
  <text start="713.5" dur="6.39">system that has to go through</text>

  <text start="740.92" dur="6.24">done this and is that they&amp;#39;ve used the</text>
  <text start="744.28" dur="7.23">employer ID number as the unique</text>
  <text start="747.16" dur="7.14">identifier instead of your name so what</text>
  <text start="751.51" dur="4.41">happens is they know your name and your</text>
  <text start="754.3" dur="4.26">social security number match and they</text>

  <text start="797.19" dur="4.899">from what I&amp;#39;ve been able to find out</text>
  <text start="799.329" dur="4.291">some such security numbers cuz they get</text>

  <text start="877.449" dur="10.351">us and we&amp;#39;ll solve it they could have</text>
  <text start="879.88" dur="11.06">been been used for employment purpose so</text>
  <text start="887.8" dur="6.839">let&amp;#39;s kind of talk about the e es F fund</text>
  <text start="890.94" dur="6.36">these this basically earning suspense</text>
  <text start="894.639" dur="2.661">file</text>
  <text start="911.04" dur="8.22">and how am i withholdings back and that</text>
  <text start="917.16" dur="5.489">was original and usually originally it</text>
  <text start="919.26" dur="4.98">was typically since women usually change</text>
  <text start="922.649" dur="3.421">the name not men when they get married</text>
  <text start="924.24" dur="4.469">it was typically women who had gotten</text>
  <text start="926.07" dur="4.47">married and on with their employer they</text>
  <text start="928.709" dur="3.75">hadn&amp;#39;t changed their actual name</text>
  <text start="930.54" dur="5.789">they said the employer still under the</text>
  <text start="932.459" dur="6.24">same name and so it allowed them to if</text>
  <text start="936.329" dur="5">they miss for like a year or so to be</text>
  <text start="938.699" dur="6.031">able to get back those withholdings and</text>
  <text start="941.329" dur="5.711">so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s recently for it&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="944.73" dur="4.77">way beyond anything that it that it</text>
  <text start="947.04" dur="5.159">normally was now the scary thing about</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="8.19">this is is this is gone gone so far down</text>
  <text start="952.199" dur="6.981">the line is that once they have once</text>
  <text start="957.69" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;ve stolen a social security number</text>
  <text start="959.18" dur="5.709">then as I started talking to the voter</text>
  <text start="961.5" dur="5.73">registrar in Virginia what was</text>
  <text start="964.889" dur="3.541">interesting on that is that we got in</text>
  <text start="967.23" dur="4.77">the conversation I start talking about</text>
  <text start="968.43" dur="4.769">security number issues as well and they</text>
  <text start="972" dur="3.93">were telling me that they have people</text>
  <text start="973.199" dur="4.801">are coming in constantly most a lot of</text>
  <text start="975.93" dur="4.62">them cannot even speak English to get a</text>
  <text start="978" dur="5.279">voter registration card in Virginia and</text>
  <text start="980.55" dur="7.229">the reason being is Virginia&amp;#39;s where it</text>
  <text start="983.279" dur="6.721">every single fake ID for all the 9/11</text>
  <text start="987.779" dur="4.17">terrorists we&amp;#39;re gotten through the</text>
  <text start="990" dur="3.87">DMV&amp;#39;s until they got their their</text>
  <text start="991.949" dur="3.12">licenses and everything to be able to</text>
  <text start="993.87" dur="5.31">get on planes and everything</text>
  <text start="995.069" dur="5.851">so Dean begot very strict to the what</text>
  <text start="999.18" dur="3.24">you had to have in order to get a</text>
  <text start="1000.92" dur="4.74">driver&amp;#39;s license they&amp;#39;re required</text>
  <text start="1002.42" dur="5.669">information so every single person you</text>
  <text start="1005.66" dur="4.169">see is a non-us citizen and illegal in</text>
  <text start="1008.089" dur="4.74">the United States that you see driving</text>
  <text start="1009.829" dur="7.141">or at least in Virginia they have to</text>
  <text start="1012.829" dur="7.681">have two forms of government ID so the</text>
  <text start="1016.97" dur="7.44">first one that used is stolen security</text>
  <text start="1020.51" dur="5.75">number and oddly enough it passes even</text>
  <text start="1024.41" dur="6.299">if it&amp;#39;s not your social security number</text>
  <text start="1026.26" dur="6.85">then the next one is the voter</text>
  <text start="1030.709" dur="4.23">registration card which you not have to</text>
  <text start="1033.11" dur="5.52">have a photo ID you do not have to have</text>
  <text start="1034.939" dur="6.331">a birth certificate to get one you go in</text>
  <text start="1038.63" dur="3.51">and you sign an affidavit saying that I</text>
  <text start="1041.27" dur="3">am</text>
  <text start="1042.14" dur="3.87">u.s. citizen and this is my name and I</text>
  <text start="1044.27" dur="4.44">live with inside this voter registration</text>
  <text start="1046.01" dur="6.78">district and then the only checks and</text>
  <text start="1048.71" dur="7.219">balances that the voter registrar has is</text>
  <text start="1052.79" dur="7.53">they they they have to mail the voter</text>
  <text start="1055.929" dur="6.041">registration card to a house or an</text>
  <text start="1060.32" dur="4.95">address that&amp;#39;s within that voter</text>
  <text start="1061.97" dur="5.19">registration district but you do not</text>
  <text start="1065.27" dur="7.32">speak English you don&amp;#39;t have to show any</text>
  <text start="1067.16" dur="7.8">ID right and so you can just go in fill</text>
  <text start="1072.59" dur="3.87">out an affidavit Sam Who I am I&amp;#39;m a US</text>
  <text start="1074.96" dur="3.3">citizen and get a voter registration</text>
  <text start="1076.46" dur="4.099">card then you once they get the voter</text>
  <text start="1078.26" dur="4.5">registration card they go to DMV and</text>
  <text start="1080.559" dur="4.301">they use their social security number</text>
  <text start="1082.76" dur="4.38">and they use the voter registration card</text>
  <text start="1084.86" dur="4.559">and the your driver&amp;#39;s license it once it</text>
  <text start="1087.14" dur="4.05">passed the test so what that means is</text>
  <text start="1089.419" dur="3.361">they have a valid ID and they have a</text>
  <text start="1091.19" dur="5.239">voter registration card which means they</text>
  <text start="1092.78" dur="3.649">can they can go right to the phone booth</text>
  <text start="1097.21" dur="7.15">now granted they didn&amp;#39;t get the voter</text>
  <text start="1100.4" dur="7.649">registration card to try and vote they</text>
  <text start="1104.36" dur="6.809">got that as something as someone figured</text>
  <text start="1108.049" dur="16.441">out and shared everyone as to how to get</text>
  <text start="1111.169" dur="14.821">a driver&amp;#39;s license millions immigrants</text>
  <text start="1124.49" dur="7.35">in the United States that have voter</text>
  <text start="1125.99" dur="9.12">registration cards and photo IDs wow</text>
  <text start="1131.84" dur="8.01">that uh certainly scares me to to know</text>
  <text start="1135.11" dur="5.91">and just incredible information can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1139.85" dur="5.22">even tell you how much we appreciate</text>
  <text start="1141.02" dur="6.04">this now I&amp;#39;m moving to anything else you</text>
  <text start="1145.07" dur="5.029">want to cover</text>
  <text start="1147.06" dur="3.039">[Music]</text>
  <text start="1157.75" dur="5.76">I mean you shouldn&amp;#39;t see these numbers</text>
  <text start="1160.33" dur="8.43">increase in the ef-s file because to</text>
  <text start="1163.51" dur="7.32">increase that means that some that</text>
  <text start="1168.76" dur="6.75">people are using security numbers and</text>
  <text start="1170.83" dur="7.77">that the sus being withheld that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1175.51" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s the the big big part of that</text>
  <text start="1178.6" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s it be impossible for these</text>
  <text start="1180.85" dur="6.69">numbers to grow that they the way they</text>
  <text start="1182.8" dur="8.42">grown up to millions of these duplicates</text>
  <text start="1187.54" dur="13.77">and I&amp;#39;m just absolutely surprised that</text>
  <text start="1191.22" dur="26.41">yes now for DHS to quit using the</text>
  <text start="1201.31" dur="19.02">mismatch earnings see this occurring</text>
  <text start="1217.63" dur="9.93">money at roughly six billion dollars per</text>
  <text start="1220.33" dur="10.2">year yeah so then this money is there</text>
  <text start="1227.56" dur="3.96">and nobody&amp;#39;s really apparently it</text>
  <text start="1230.53" dur="2.58">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like anybody&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="1231.52" dur="8.7">anything with it but they could be being</text>
  <text start="1233.11" dur="8.88">used right now we don&amp;#39;t know and I think</text>
  <text start="1240.22" dur="4.65">the bigger fact is the whole story is</text>
  <text start="1241.99" dur="5.91">what you&amp;#39;ve highlighted about how that</text>
  <text start="1244.87" dur="5.52">nobody cares because of a you know they</text>
  <text start="1247.9" dur="4.47">want to keep that money and then be the</text>
  <text start="1250.39" dur="4.41">labor and keeping cheap labor in our</text>
  <text start="1252.37" dur="3.96">country and this sounds like a some sort</text>
  <text start="1254.8" dur="3.78">of policy that would have been enacted</text>
  <text start="1256.33" dur="5.9">by the Obama administration in order to</text>
  <text start="1258.58" dur="11.31">actually facilitate the you know the the</text>
  <text start="1262.23" dur="10.18">exploitation of cheap illegal labor in</text>
  <text start="1269.89" dur="5.78">2009 I mean that&amp;#39;s when Homeland</text>
  <text start="1272.41" dur="5.43">Security could no longer use it for</text>
  <text start="1275.67" dur="5.38">looking for illegals that were in the</text>
  <text start="1277.84" dur="5.67">country and at the same time they</text>
  <text start="1281.05" dur="4.6">suspended the Security Administration</text>
  <text start="1283.51" dur="6.28">and sending out notices to employers</text>
  <text start="1285.65" dur="6.99">duplicate or mismatched information so</text>
  <text start="1289.79" dur="6.24">they bar the the social security network</text>
  <text start="1292.64" dur="6.99">from sending out in from this</text>
  <text start="1296.03" dur="5.43">information to employers to tell them</text>
  <text start="1299.63" dur="5.01">that they have people working for them</text>
  <text start="1301.46" dur="4.53">who are not have a real secure but then</text>
  <text start="1304.64" dur="8.1">what was the other one you said the</text>
  <text start="1305.99" dur="10.08">first one yes DHS in 2007 started using</text>
  <text start="1312.74" dur="6.51">the no no match role when security</text>
  <text start="1316.07" dur="5.43">numbers didn&amp;#39;t match to the name they</text>
  <text start="1319.25" dur="3.96">started using that to look for illegal</text>
  <text start="1321.5" dur="4.38">aliens it looked for employers who were</text>
  <text start="1323.21" dur="8.58">illegally hiring people and then in 2009</text>
  <text start="1325.88" dur="8.03">a TV screen nine that was rescinded and</text>
  <text start="1331.79" dur="6.269">they were restricted from using that</text>
  <text start="1333.91" dur="6.1">information in order to look for illegal</text>
  <text start="1338.059" dur="4.981">aliens or look for people come in or</text>
  <text start="1340.01" dur="31.22">employers that were hiring and then the</text>

  <text start="1490.17" dur="3.84">if that many people have used that</text>
  <text start="1492.33" dur="5.31">information to get driver&amp;#39;s license and</text>
  <text start="1494.01" dur="5.16">they have voter registrations most of</text>
  <text start="1497.64" dur="3.92">the undocumented aliens or illegal</text>
  <text start="1499.17" dur="5.61">aliens have been very reluctant to vote</text>
  <text start="1501.56" dur="4.63">yeah but right now they they see this as</text>
  <text start="1504.78" dur="2.88">a moratorium</text>
  <text start="1506.19" dur="2.82">you know that they need to vote on I</text>
  <text start="1507.66" dur="3.66">mean they&amp;#39;re protesting more openly</text>
  <text start="1509.01" dur="3.69">everything else and there&amp;#39;s nothing to</text>
  <text start="1511.32" dur="4.08">stop them from showing up at the polls</text>
  <text start="1512.7" dur="5.67">above it then there&amp;#39;s districts and that</text>
  <text start="1515.4" dur="4.65">that sort of worries me a little bit but</text>
  <text start="1518.37" dur="4.88">here&amp;#39;s even the better part here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1520.05" dur="6.57">part that really gets interesting and</text>
  <text start="1523.25" dur="5.89">that is that if these people have are</text>
  <text start="1526.62" dur="3.9">convicted of identity theft that means</text>
  <text start="1529.14" dur="6.21">that any of the money that they have</text>
  <text start="1530.52" dur="7.83">earned or gained that can be confiscated</text>
  <text start="1535.35" dur="5.16">through a legal action becomes ownership</text>
  <text start="1538.35" dur="3.81">of the government just like if you were</text>

  <text start="1542.16" dur="2.85">million dollars you know and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1543.51" dur="2.67">something the government takes and they</text>
  <text start="1545.01" dur="2.16">could pretty much do whatever they want</text>

  <text start="1553.92" dur="3.33">earnings that are in the other any of</text>

  <text start="1822.81" dur="3.96">talk about how God is gonna play a role</text>
  <text start="1825.63" dur="3.33">in this because a lot of the things we</text>
  <text start="1826.77" dur="4.08">talked about don&amp;#39;t really highlight that</text>
  <text start="1828.96" dur="4.35">the beauty and the grace and the</text>
  <text start="1830.85" dur="4.35">awesomeness of the world that God has</text>

  <text start="1835.2" dur="4.26">always like to end it on a positive note</text>
  <text start="1837.09" dur="4.35">so in this I want to share a piece of</text>
  <text start="1839.46" dur="3.36">scripture Psalm 8 and we&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="1841.44" dur="3.54">read the whole thing and I want this to</text>
  <text start="1842.82" dur="4.92">kind of resonate for you to understand</text>
  <text start="1844.98" dur="5.37">that God&amp;#39;s glory and man&amp;#39;s dignity are</text>
  <text start="1847.74" dur="4.68">one in the same if we live our lives the</text>
  <text start="1850.35" dur="6.21">right way so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s read this verse</text>
  <text start="1852.42" dur="6.6">it&amp;#39;s again Psalm 8 it says Lord our Lord</text>
  <text start="1856.56" dur="4.29">how magnificent is your name throughout</text>
  <text start="1859.02" dur="3.48">the earth you have covered the heavens</text>
  <text start="1860.85" dur="3.84">with your majesty because of your</text>

  <text start="1872.88" dur="5.16">moons and the stars which you set in</text>
  <text start="1875.04" dur="5.76">place what is man that you remember him</text>
  <text start="1878.04" dur="5.22">the son of man that you look after him</text>
  <text start="1880.8" dur="5.01">you made him little less than God and</text>
  <text start="1883.26" dur="4.95">crowned him with glory and honor</text>
  <text start="1885.81" dur="5.13">you made him Lord over the works of your</text>
  <text start="1888.21" dur="5.01">hands you put everything under his feet</text>
  <text start="1890.94" dur="4.65">all the sheep and oxen as well as the</text>
