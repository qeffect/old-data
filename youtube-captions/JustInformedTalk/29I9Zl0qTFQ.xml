  <text start="73.2" dur="6.12">here it&amp;#39;s like a graphic and it shows</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="5.071">these older a Q posts where basically</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="3.869">the anton&amp;#39;s were saying that the</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="3.6">timeline changed right because Q had</text>
  <text start="83.189" dur="4.921">said it&amp;#39;s gonna be glorious in November</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="6.42">11:11 for the Veterans Day there was</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.28">going to be a big parade a military</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="6.18">parade and they decided not to end up</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="6.03">doing that so when that happened Q came</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="4.979">and said timelines change watch the</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="6.51">budget Q so everybody kind of read this</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="6.961">at the time as to say that there was</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="4.619">something that was not good about what</text>
  <text start="109.47" dur="3.12">was gonna go on there a lot of people</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="4.801">said that even had to even made the</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="5.639">speculative thought that there was some</text>
  <text start="115.35" dur="4.89">kind of threat made against the parade</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="4.231">or some sort of threat anticipated</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="5.61">against the parade but whatever it is</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="5.85">let&amp;#39;s just put it this way Q told us</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s watching the budget so and the</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.99">timelines are changing so I guess that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="3.94">what Q wants us to look back at</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="2.82">and how does that relate to today well</text>
  <text start="134.74" dur="1.68">I&amp;#39;ll get into that right here in a</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="2.7">minute</text>
  <text start="136.42" dur="4.08">but Q says an enemy at the front door</text>
  <text start="138.82" dur="4.47">United States Secret Service state</text>
  <text start="140.5" dur="5.79">alerts prevent travel a week to remember</text>
  <text start="143.29" dur="4.32">q so you guys buckle up we got another</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="3.63">incredible week ahead of us</text>
  <text start="147.61" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;ve had several so far and now we just</text>
  <text start="149.92" dur="5.58">have another one here upcoming now what</text>
  <text start="153.16" dur="4.65">is this all meaning well according to</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="5.55">multiple reports President Trump was not</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="5.58">able to attend a ceremony in France that</text>
  <text start="161.05" dur="4.98">marked the 100th anniversary of the end</text>
  <text start="163.39" dur="4.68">of World War one President Trump had</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="4.4">planned to visit the aint smaran</text>
  <text start="168.07" dur="5.28">American Cemetery and Ballou France</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="5.74">sorry if I butchered all of those French</text>
  <text start="173.35" dur="4.77">words but it says the president was</text>
  <text start="176.17" dur="4.56">expected to lay a wreath and observe a</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="5.61">moment of silence it&amp;#39;s according to a</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="5.7">report from Fox News so what happened</text>
  <text start="183.73" dur="5.07">basically President Trump was not able</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="3.74">to make it now the reasons cited it out</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="3.87">of multiple reports is that the</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="6.63">president&amp;#39;s helicopter Marine one was</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="7.56">not able to fly in low cloud cover and</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="6.28">so the the actual ceremony itself was</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="4.89">located about an hour outside of Paris</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="5.31">where President Trump was and they had</text>
  <text start="205.12" dur="5.25">decided not to take up the presidential</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="3.9">motorcade on that road but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="4.2">something much more nefarious here that</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="4.199">I think the president or that the excuse</text>
  <text start="214.57" dur="4.56">me the Qun on is trying to allude to</text>
  <text start="216.489" dur="4.561">here when Q says enemy at the front door</text>
  <text start="219.13" dur="5.76">and it says United States Secret Service</text>
  <text start="221.05" dur="5.88">stay alerts prevent travel that to me</text>
  <text start="224.89" dur="3.51">can be interpreted you know a bunch of</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="3.12">different ways obviously you know some</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="3.66">people can read it and see is something</text>
  <text start="230.05" dur="4.17">some can read it and see something else</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="5.55">but I can tell you after having covered</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="8.76">this in depth for over a year now there</text>
  <text start="237.61" dur="8.04">that this information really points me</text>
  <text start="242.98" dur="4.979">to be quite skeptical of what actually</text>
  <text start="245.65" dur="4.05">happened now a lot of the boards are you</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="3.841">know all of the the q boards and all</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="5.599">that stuff they&amp;#39;re all basically saying</text>
  <text start="251.8" dur="6.6">that the United States Secret Service</text>
  <text start="255.299" dur="5.021">kept President Trump from going to these</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="4.14">events because there was credible</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="4.74">threats that may or may not have existed</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="6.18">right and these credible threats would</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="5.61">be definitely in response to the policy</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="4.65">position that President Trump was taken</text>
  <text start="270.67" dur="4.2">so imagine this President Trump gets to</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="4.44">to Paris he&amp;#39;s going to go to this</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="6">ceremony his Secret Service detail comes</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="5.55">from says sir we cannot we do not</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="4.26">suggest that you go there&amp;#39;s credible</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="3.87">threats out this is just a hypothetical</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;m not saying this is what happened but</text>
  <text start="287.23" dur="4.92">hypothetically speaking that was what</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="4.83">was told to him and they made the the</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="4.65">right decision to play it safe so now</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="4.2">take turn I take a step back and put</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="4.44">that in the context of what happened</text>
  <text start="298.72" dur="5.88">that day in Paris or today in Paris</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="6.72">during this ceremony so you have so many</text>
  <text start="304.6" dur="5.82">things going on but I mean if there was</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="4.98">some reason for the Secret Service to</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="4.38">put a stay alert to prevent travel on</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="5.04">the president then that means they must</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="5.58">have basically saw or heard or</text>
  <text start="317.98" dur="4.73">intercepted something that led them to</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="5.55">believe there was something unsafe about</text>
  <text start="322.71" dur="5.17">attending those ceremonies but obviously</text>
  <text start="325.93" dur="5">that would not be a prudent for them to</text>
  <text start="327.88" dur="6.27">release it because it may tip off there</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="5.41">whoever was behind this that they are on</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="4.14">to it now even though they probably got</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="3.69">a pretty good tip on that when they</text>
  <text start="338.29" dur="3.45">realized that President Trump wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="340.03" dur="3.33">be attending but you read these stories</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="3.12">and you read these tweets about</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="4.11">President Trump and they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="4.8">disrespectful that he you know decided</text>
  <text start="347.47" dur="4.71">to skip this event sit in his hotel room</text>
  <text start="349.66" dur="4.29">and do you think really that President</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="3.54">Trump wanted to miss this event that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.95" dur="4.29">the thing I think is pretty laughable</text>
  <text start="355.72" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s like why even travel all the way to</text>
  <text start="358.24" dur="4.95">Paris if you&amp;#39;re just gonna go sit in a</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="5.55">hotel room right and one thing I wanted</text>
  <text start="363.19" dur="4.08">to basically point out here is it says</text>
  <text start="365.32" dur="4.65">enemy at the front door and it uses the</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="7.25">@ symbol now I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.97" dur="8.7">maybe possibly a reference to Twitter</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="6.7">I&amp;#39;m not sure all I know is that this is</text>
  <text start="378.67" dur="5.43">telling us a lot and also I want to see</text>
  <text start="381.22" dur="7.89">here or say here you know you see these</text>
  <text start="384.1" dur="6.3">letters are put in capitals EFD I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="2.73">sure if that is I mean this one&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="390.4" dur="3.69">little more cryptic it&amp;#39;s harder to read</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="3.7">so if you guys have any other insights</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="4.15">please leave them down the comment</text>
  <text start="395.54" dur="5.67">but I definitely if you look at the smug</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="4.8">face on McCrone and Merkel at the</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="3.84">ceremony after they were talking about</text>
  <text start="403.04" dur="4.32">how nationalism is basically the</text>
  <text start="405.05" dur="5.21">opposite of patriotism and how it stands</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="5.7">in direct opposition to patriotism that</text>
  <text start="410.26" dur="6.01">to me was a direct sign they were almost</text>
  <text start="413.06" dur="5.01">smirking like yeah we know we did this</text>
  <text start="416.27" dur="3.12">and it&amp;#39;s like a message they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="418.07" dur="4.47">to send to the president so let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="419.39" dur="5.37">how that goes for them right it says let</text>
  <text start="422.54" dur="4.71">the unsealing begin this is mxq post let</text>
  <text start="424.76" dur="4.47">the d-class begin let the world witness</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="4.92">the truth we the people justice under</text>
  <text start="429.23" dur="4.77">the law q so the unsealing is going to</text>
  <text start="432.17" dur="4.23">begin hopefully I mean guys it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434" dur="4.59">November 11 that was the day that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="5.13">been basically building building and</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="3.99">building up to so November 12th we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="3.92">gonna have to wait and see what happens</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="6.78">now one thing I thought was interesting</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="7.38">it talks about let the D class begin and</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="6.51">it puts the L here in the brackets the</text>
  <text start="452.83" dur="6.25">metaphorical kill box and what that</text>
  <text start="455.87" dur="4.74">relates back to is the only other post I</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="3.75">could find with it was this one down</text>
  <text start="460.61" dur="5.34">here where actually is the same exact</text>
  <text start="462.83" dur="6.95">way it&amp;#39;s got the L in the parenthesis or</text>
  <text start="465.95" dur="6.75">the brackets there but it says LD R and</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="6.4">that would be you know a reference a lot</text>
  <text start="472.7" dur="5.94">of people made to Lynn de Rothschild</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="4.44">that was basically the takeaway from</text>
  <text start="478.64" dur="5.01">that because it says distress calls and</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="6.36">this is from November 13th 2017 so this</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="4.65">is almost exactly a year ago today right</text>
  <text start="486.98" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s pretty interesting</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="5.07">but it says distress calls to others</text>
  <text start="491.03" dur="5.64">will do you family no good at this stage</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="5.07">we know where you are you the family are</text>
  <text start="496.67" dur="5.28">at all times and can hear you breathing</text>
  <text start="498.44" dur="5.25">Q so if this does have to do with like</text>
  <text start="501.95" dur="4.08">Linda Rothschild and then this is</text>
  <text start="503.69" dur="4.68">another reference back to Lynn I guess</text>
  <text start="506.03" dur="4.11">the question really becomes why would Q</text>
  <text start="508.37" dur="4.2">be giving us a reference back to Linda</text>
  <text start="510.14" dur="5.64">Rothschild in right after President</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="5.58">Trump&amp;#39;s in Europe in France going to the</text>
  <text start="515.78" dur="4.889">ceremony having to miss events because</text>
  <text start="518.15" dur="4.949">of stay alerts according to cue from the</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="4.441">United States Secret Service that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.099" dur="4.531">something we need to remember and keep</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="4.07">an eye on and you know that could just</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="3.99">be a little message to them like</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="4.24">we&amp;#39;re gonna unseal this no matter what</text>
  <text start="531.62" dur="4.47">you try to do and we&amp;#39;re always going to</text>
  <text start="533.42" dur="4.74">be two steps ahead of you and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.09" dur="3.81">what it&amp;#39;s kind of saying to me as I read</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="3">it but obviously if you guys have</text>
  <text start="539.9" dur="3.21">different take please let me know down</text>
  <text start="541.16" dur="4.74">in the comments it says let the world</text>

  <text start="593.75" dur="6.15">they almost correlate directly directly</text>
  <text start="596.66" dur="5.55">with this other map here of undocumented</text>
  <text start="599.9" dur="4.71">immigrants in our country and there is</text>
  <text start="602.21" dur="4.59">no coincidence in that I think he wants</text>
  <text start="604.61" dur="5.76">us to know but now we have a series of</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="5.4">questions that let&amp;#39;s just think about</text>
  <text start="610.37" dur="4.5">this for a second Q&amp;#39;s gonna ask a series</text>
  <text start="612.2" dur="4.47">of questions that have to do with all of</text>
  <text start="614.87" dur="3.84">these elections across the country right</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="4.62">and you know what&amp;#39;s even better is that</text>
  <text start="618.71" dur="7.05">if any of this were true or is true</text>
  <text start="621.29" dur="5.97">right or is happening it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="625.76" dur="3.72">that we know what&amp;#39;s happening and we can</text>
  <text start="627.26" dur="4.17">call out for what it is but then</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="4.35">secondly they&amp;#39;re giving their showing</text>
  <text start="631.43" dur="4.32">their hand for the 2020 election so this</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="3.69">is a good learning opportunity for us</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="5.97">all to examine this information and say</text>
  <text start="637.52" dur="6.27">all of this if it did happen needs to be</text>
  <text start="641.72" dur="4.65">investigated and people would have to be</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="5.22">indicted and basically prosecuted if</text>
  <text start="646.37" dur="4.35">this were true but it says what if the</text>
  <text start="649.01" dur="4.8">below could be proven it says one</text>
  <text start="650.72" dur="4.92">election plus democrat party officials</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="4.56">filled out many thousands of blank</text>
  <text start="655.64" dur="4.62">ballots to election plus democrat</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="4.65">officials removed and destroyed legal</text>

  <text start="663.02" dur="5.07">officials deliberately organized</text>

  <text start="687.8" dur="5.31">how many blank ballots are generated</text>
  <text start="689.63" dur="5.46">worst total County pop population the</text>
  <text start="693.11" dur="4.44">control and issuance of blank ballots is</text>
  <text start="695.09" dur="4.44">key why did the same counties under</text>
  <text start="697.55" dur="4.44">dispute today refused to turn over voter</text>
  <text start="699.53" dur="3.81">registration information upon request to</text>
  <text start="701.99" dur="3.48">the voter fraud Commission</text>
  <text start="703.34" dur="5.28">why was the voter fraud commission</text>
  <text start="705.47" dur="6.45">disbanded and turned over to D DHS</text>
  <text start="708.62" dur="4.89">Department Homeland Security what vested</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="3.21">Authority does Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="713.51" dur="4.08">Security have compared to a commission</text>
  <text start="715.13" dur="4.35">body and it gives us Washington Post our</text>
  <text start="717.59" dur="4.68">article and it says enemy at the front</text>
  <text start="719.48" dur="7.08">door q okay so let&amp;#39;s go over a few</text>
  <text start="722.27" dur="5.97">things here first of all all of this up</text>
  <text start="726.56" dur="5.43">here at the top is pretty terrifying</text>
  <text start="728.24" dur="5.7">right so if democrat party officials</text>
  <text start="731.99" dur="4.77">with election officials we&amp;#39;re filling</text>
  <text start="733.94" dur="5.16">out thousands of blank ballots that</text>
  <text start="736.76" dur="6.03">would be incredibly illegal and that</text>
  <text start="739.1" dur="4.26">would be very very undemocratic to say</text>
  <text start="742.79" dur="4.02">the least</text>
  <text start="743.36" dur="4.97">it says if they actually were taking or</text>
  <text start="746.81" dur="4.5">moving and destroying</text>
  <text start="748.33" dur="5.62">illegal ballots that to in and of itself</text>
  <text start="751.31" dur="4.2">would be very illegal this is like</text>
  <text start="753.95" dur="3.81">looking like if these things are true</text>
  <text start="755.51" dur="5.4">then the Democrats don&amp;#39;t want democracy</text>
  <text start="757.76" dur="5.22">they want a dictatorship right so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="4.8">what you&amp;#39;re seeing here if this is in</text>
  <text start="762.98" dur="4.8">fact true but it says election plus</text>
  <text start="765.71" dur="4.89">Democrat it officials deliberately</text>
  <text start="767.78" dur="5.33">organized citizen a non citizen voting</text>
  <text start="770.6" dur="5.67">meaning busting people and who are not</text>
  <text start="773.11" dur="6.43">American citizens to go vote that in</text>
  <text start="776.27" dur="5.13">that to is illegal and it says if they</text>
  <text start="779.54" dur="4.56">were officials with from the election</text>
  <text start="781.4" dur="5.25">officials and Democratic Party were in</text>
  <text start="784.1" dur="5.1">certain locations across the u.s. under</text>
  <text start="786.65" dur="4.35">lock and key storing many thousands of</text>
  <text start="789.2" dur="5.28">blank ballots just for the sole purpose</text>
  <text start="791" dur="5.22">of altering the Volturi vote total again</text>
  <text start="794.48" dur="5.16">that is incredibly</text>
  <text start="796.22" dur="4.8">now if you look at what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="799.64" dur="5.99">Broward County that&amp;#39;s just a great</text>
  <text start="801.02" dur="6.96">example you have I saw a report today of</text>
  <text start="805.63" dur="4.93">basically a provisional ballot box that</text>
  <text start="807.98" dur="5.01">was found in a rental car at the Fort</text>
  <text start="810.56" dur="6.99">Lauderdale Airport just what more</text>
  <text start="812.99" dur="6.81">example of voting or an irregularity</text>
  <text start="817.55" dur="4.8">with that election process there but</text>
  <text start="819.8" dur="4.14">then it says whose safeguards blank</text>
  <text start="822.35" dur="5.46">ballots who issues blank ballots who</text>
  <text start="823.94" dur="6.39">controls blank ballots that to me those</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="4.29">three questions are all the same I</text>
  <text start="830.33" dur="4.8">believe I believe that would be the</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="5.4">supervisor of elections office in any</text>
  <text start="835.13" dur="3.57">County that you&amp;#39;re in there will be the</text>
  <text start="837.5" dur="3.21">ones who are in charge of I guess</text>
  <text start="838.7" dur="4.08">creating the ballot and then holding the</text>
  <text start="840.71" dur="5.25">ballot issuing about controlling where</text>
  <text start="842.78" dur="6.27">it goes and how it stays protected right</text>
  <text start="845.96" dur="4.71">and at least I believe that is if you if</text>
  <text start="849.05" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s not you guys would feel free to</text>
  <text start="850.67" dur="5.94">correct me but then it says how many</text>
  <text start="854.3" dur="5.46">blank ballots are generated verse total</text>
  <text start="856.61" dur="5.37">County population and given since this</text>
  <text start="859.76" dur="5.04">information is kind of hard to find my</text>
  <text start="861.98" dur="5.31">best guess is that you print more</text>
  <text start="864.8" dur="4.95">ballots than you have people voting in</text>
  <text start="867.29" dur="4.68">case ballots get destroyed or or</text>
  <text start="869.75" dur="4.77">whatever you need extra ballots for you</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="4.77">know somebody spill something or tears</text>
  <text start="874.52" dur="3.75">it or fills it out wrong whatever you</text>
  <text start="876.74" dur="4.41">would probably want to have a few extra</text>
  <text start="878.27" dur="3.9">ballots on hand now that to me is</text>
  <text start="881.15" dur="3.51">incredible</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="4.92">to think of in context of what is being</text>
  <text start="884.66" dur="4.32">suggested here by Q through these</text>
  <text start="887.09" dur="3.48">questions right but it says the</text>
  <text start="888.98" dur="3.75">controlled issuance of blank ballots is</text>
  <text start="890.57" dur="3.6">key so of course it&amp;#39;s going to be key</text>
  <text start="892.73" dur="2.67">because whoever&amp;#39;s controlling and</text>
  <text start="894.17" dur="3.81">issuing them then they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="895.4" dur="5.189">an ability to do whatever they want with</text>
  <text start="897.98" dur="4.98">them as long as they they&amp;#39;re all in it</text>
  <text start="900.589" dur="4.711">together right which is something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.96" dur="4.08">seeming to be the case as more and more</text>
  <text start="905.3" dur="5.42">information is uncovered in Broward</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="3.68">County where you just have an incredible</text>
  <text start="911.11" dur="6.12">set of coincidences that continue to</text>
  <text start="914.47" dur="5.38">point to the fact that there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="917.23" dur="4.42">asset of voting irregularities from that</text>
  <text start="919.85" dur="6.78">County that needs to be investigated</text>
  <text start="921.65" dur="6.9">thoroughly so that to me is what was</text>
  <text start="926.63" dur="4.38">interesting and then it goes</text>
  <text start="928.55" dur="4.44">talk about why did the same counties</text>
  <text start="931.01" dur="3.99">under dispute today refused to turn over</text>
  <text start="932.99" dur="4.34">voter registration information upon</text>
  <text start="935" dur="5.51">request to the voter fraud Commission</text>
  <text start="937.33" dur="5.68">well that&amp;#39;s pretty obvious I mean they</text>
  <text start="940.51" dur="4.449">the same County didn&amp;#39;t want to turn over</text>
  <text start="943.01" dur="4.29">that information and think it&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="944.959" dur="4.231">about Broward County for the simple fact</text>
  <text start="947.3" dur="5.13">that they knew that the numbers wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="949.19" dur="5.76">match up and that to me is what is most</text>
  <text start="952.43" dur="4.11">disturbing but then it says why was the</text>
  <text start="954.95" dur="5.1">voter fraud Commission disbanded and</text>
  <text start="956.54" dur="6.69">turned over to DHS yes back in 2017</text>
  <text start="960.05" dur="5.01">President Trump did basically disband</text>
  <text start="963.23" dur="4.71">the voter fraud Commission that he had</text>
  <text start="965.06" dur="4.29">basically put together in favor of</text>
  <text start="967.94" dur="4.589">having the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="969.35" dur="6.989">Security oversee these issues and that</text>
  <text start="972.529" dur="6.901">to me indicates that the difference</text>
  <text start="976.339" dur="4.74">between the DHS and the voter Commission</text>
  <text start="979.43" dur="4.52">is that a commission is basically an</text>
  <text start="981.079" dur="5.82">advisory role they can make advisory</text>
  <text start="983.95" dur="5.8">recommendations but DHS can actually</text>
  <text start="986.899" dur="5.701">take more substantive actions against</text>
  <text start="989.75" dur="5.79">fighting the actual act of voter fraud</text>
  <text start="992.6" dur="8.429">which to me is a more important take</text>
  <text start="995.54" dur="8.01">away from what is being basically given</text>
  <text start="1001.029" dur="4.081">us by Q here so the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="1003.55" dur="3.57">article of course you guys know I</text>
  <text start="1005.11" dur="3.45">refused to pay for the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="1007.12" dur="5.37">because I don&amp;#39;t want to pay for fake</text>
  <text start="1008.56" dur="7.62">news and it&amp;#39;s just not worth it to me</text>
  <text start="1012.49" dur="6.15">but the article here is talks about how</text>
  <text start="1016.18" dur="5.01">it basically is a hit piece on President</text>
  <text start="1018.64" dur="4.29">Trump and sessions right when they</text>
  <text start="1021.19" dur="4.8">talked about voter fraud without</text>
  <text start="1022.93" dur="4.649">evidence right well the reality is that</text>
  <text start="1025.99" dur="5.61">we&amp;#39;re getting more and more evidence</text>
  <text start="1027.579" dur="6.24">every day and it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1031.6" dur="4.62">even worth going after you know trying</text>
  <text start="1033.819" dur="5.401">to refute what these people say because</text>
  <text start="1036.22" dur="5.849">in that case because you know these are</text>
  <text start="1039.22" dur="6.66">just politically motivated articles that</text>
  <text start="1042.069" dur="6.871">are written to stir up an emotion and</text>
  <text start="1045.88" dur="4.77">get people to distrust the president and</text>
  <text start="1048.94" dur="5.79">his attorney general former attorney</text>
  <text start="1050.65" dur="5.61">general right so this right here is</text>
  <text start="1054.73" dur="4.23">interesting too because it says enemy at</text>
  <text start="1056.26" dur="4.2">the front door again and it says q so</text>
  <text start="1058.96" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;m thinking this is a direct</text>
  <text start="1060.46" dur="4.68">correlation to something</text>
  <text start="1062.47" dur="6.45">I&amp;#39;m not sure what I mean you can take it</text>
  <text start="1065.14" dur="5.31">for its most plain and simple face value</text>
  <text start="1068.92" dur="3">where it&amp;#39;s just saying that the enemy is</text>
  <text start="1070.45" dur="6.99">at the front door meaning we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1071.92" dur="7.26">confronting a very a you know direct</text>
  <text start="1077.44" dur="3.81">threat you know somebody&amp;#39;s coming right</text>
  <text start="1079.18" dur="3.96">to your throne front door but other than</text>
  <text start="1081.25" dur="3.57">that you know I don&amp;#39;t know how much I</text>
  <text start="1083.14" dur="3.27">can read into it yet I&amp;#39;m sure there are</text>
  <text start="1084.82" dur="3.81">some very clever anions out there</text>
  <text start="1086.41" dur="5.07">already put piecing it together as we</text>

  <text start="1246.28" dur="5.61">right that this is kind of cute giving</text>

  <text start="1261.88" dur="7.94">right then we may see basically the</text>
  <text start="1267.15" dur="5.2">Supreme Court get involved with these</text>
  <text start="1269.82" dur="7.27">challenges where they&amp;#39;re basically going</text>

  <text start="1277.09" dur="2.04">they&amp;#39;re called out for what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1278.23" dur="2.07">doing they&amp;#39;re going to take it all the</text>

  <text start="1280.3" dur="4.59">argue that it was legal and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1283.9" dur="3.69">something that we&amp;#39;re gonna have to wait</text>
  <text start="1284.89" dur="5.64">and see and then Q says of course some</text>
  <text start="1287.59" dur="4.89">of us a verse defense appeals right and</text>
  <text start="1290.53" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s gonna be interesting to see how</text>
  <text start="1292.48" dur="4.14">that all plays out and kind of reading</text>
  <text start="1294.34" dur="3.6">these briefly because there&amp;#39;s not much</text>
  <text start="1296.62" dur="5.52">to take away other than what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1297.94" dur="6.84">basically insinuating then branch</text>
  <text start="1302.14" dur="4.77">terminations I think that obviously</text>
  <text start="1304.78" dur="3.6">refers to different branches of the</text>
  <text start="1306.91" dur="5.01">government where people will be losing</text>
  <text start="1308.38" dur="5.97">their positions over this and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1311.92" dur="4.2">those people some of those people who</text>
  <text start="1314.35" dur="3.57">are going to be being terminated will</text>
  <text start="1316.12" dur="3.72">not hesitate to start leaking to do</text>
  <text start="1317.92" dur="5.19">anything they can to save their own tail</text>
  <text start="1319.84" dur="5.67">from being basically put out of a job</text>
  <text start="1323.11" dur="4.3">and exposed and maybe even held</text>
  <text start="1325.51" dur="4">criminally liable for their</text>
  <text start="1327.41" dur="4.65">so then the next one here is a</text>
  <text start="1329.51" dur="5.7">placeholder for acts of treason plus</text>
  <text start="1332.06" dur="5.73">support articles right and I think that</text>
  <text start="1335.21" dur="6.57">one&amp;#39;s obvious pretty straightforward and</text>
  <text start="1337.79" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s saying foreign acts are public so</text>
  <text start="1341.78" dur="4.71">that means we will be told about the</text>
  <text start="1343.46" dur="4.98">foreign involvement the foreign actions</text>
  <text start="1346.49" dur="4.2">and that goes right into this one here</text>
  <text start="1348.44" dur="3.41">with five eyes being made public as we</text>
  <text start="1350.69" dur="3.72">know they were involved heavily</text>
  <text start="1351.85" dur="4.18">according to cue with the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="1354.41" dur="4.2">and all of that surveillance on</text>
  <text start="1356.03" dur="6.32">President Trump during his campaign and</text>
  <text start="1358.61" dur="6.24">of course the FISA abuse where basically</text>
  <text start="1362.35" dur="5.59">people have brought forth information</text>
  <text start="1364.85" dur="7.17">that would lend itself for us to say you</text>
  <text start="1367.94" dur="6.72">know Glenn Simpson at a fusion GPS had</text>
  <text start="1372.02" dur="4.71">direct ties with Bruce or through Nelly</text>
  <text start="1374.66" dur="4.14">or and it was funneling that information</text>
  <text start="1376.73" dur="4.83">into the Department of Justice in order</text>
  <text start="1378.8" dur="5.25">to basically get this investigation</text>
  <text start="1381.56" dur="4.86">going and when they went to present the</text>
  <text start="1384.05" dur="5.28">evidence to the FISA Court they knew</text>
  <text start="1386.42" dur="5.49">full and well that the steel dossier was</text>
  <text start="1389.33" dur="4.44">not verified and they chose to withhold</text>
  <text start="1391.91" dur="5.28">information that would support the fact</text>
  <text start="1393.77" dur="6.57">that it was unverified and basically not</text>
  <text start="1397.19" dur="5.58">non in or inconclusive and that would</text>
  <text start="1400.34" dur="6.15">have basically may be given the FISA</text>
  <text start="1402.77" dur="6.45">judge a reason to doubt the issuance of</text>
  <text start="1406.49" dur="3.93">this warrant to spy on the president so</text>
  <text start="1409.22" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s something we have to look forward</text>
  <text start="1410.42" dur="4.38">to as well here again is a placeholder</text>
  <text start="1412.52" dur="3.75">talking about did the general</text>
  <text start="1414.8" dur="4.11">declassification which would be I guess</text>
  <text start="1416.27" dur="5.01">the full declassification and that would</text>
  <text start="1418.91" dur="5.7">be the exposing of the Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="1421.28" dur="5.4">Robert Muller so yeah that&amp;#39;s kind of how</text>
  <text start="1424.61" dur="3.99">I read those guys it&amp;#39;s like a sequence</text>
  <text start="1426.68" dur="4.26">of events for things to come</text>
  <text start="1428.6" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ll have to see this is definitely an</text>
  <text start="1430.94" dur="3.54">interesting way that Hugh puts this so</text>
  <text start="1433.1" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see how that all</text>
  <text start="1434.48" dur="3.33">basically pans out if you guys have your</text>
  <text start="1436.52" dur="3.06">own thoughts on what it could be</text>
  <text start="1437.81" dur="3.9">please let me know down in the comments</text>
  <text start="1439.58" dur="6.69">now the next one here the final one is</text>
  <text start="1441.71" dur="6.99">this post which is just this article it</text>
  <text start="1446.27" dur="5.36">says rap Ratcliffe and Gowdy join a list</text>
  <text start="1448.7" dur="5.82">of potential Attorney General picks and</text>
  <text start="1451.63" dur="6.22">this is a new report a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="1454.52" dur="6.12">reporting this now that both John</text>
  <text start="1457.85" dur="6.53">Ratcliffe of Texas</text>
  <text start="1460.64" dur="6.51">and Trey Gaudi of South Carolina are</text>
  <text start="1464.38" dur="7.09">being considered for the next Attorney</text>
  <text start="1467.15" dur="5.97">General now this to me is is could could</text>
  <text start="1471.47" dur="3.9">be a few different things the first</text>
  <text start="1473.12" dur="4.47">thing I think when I think about John</text>
  <text start="1475.37" dur="4.02">Ratcliffe is that he doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a</text>
  <text start="1477.59" dur="5.76">likely pick for the Attorney General at</text>
  <text start="1479.39" dur="8.22">this point I just watched an interview</text>
  <text start="1483.35" dur="5.85">over here on it was a post it was a</text>
  <text start="1487.61" dur="6.21">story on Breitbart and it gave this</text>
  <text start="1489.2" dur="6.3">Maria Bartow MO video clip where you</text>
  <text start="1493.82" dur="3.42">know he&amp;#39;s kind of going over a lot of</text>
  <text start="1495.5" dur="3.75">the information that has to do with what</text>
  <text start="1497.24" dur="4.59">he&amp;#39;s been uncovering in the House</text>
  <text start="1499.25" dur="5.13">Committee on the judiciary in their</text>
  <text start="1501.83" dur="6.36">investigation of what actually happened</text>
  <text start="1504.38" dur="6.75">with the FISA spying on President Trump</text>
  <text start="1508.19" dur="4.92">right and he made some pretty you know</text>
  <text start="1511.13" dur="3.57">spot-on conclusions but he said</text>
  <text start="1513.11" dur="4.14">something that was a little worrying to</text>
  <text start="1514.7" dur="4.53">me and that kind of lended itself for me</text>
  <text start="1517.25" dur="3.99">to think that he would not be the pick</text>
  <text start="1519.23" dur="4.56">for attorney general because he</text>
  <text start="1521.24" dur="5.52">insinuated that it is his belief that</text>
  <text start="1523.79" dur="6.629">the best course of action right for</text>
  <text start="1526.76" dur="5.1">remedying this Phi sub u stuff is to</text>
  <text start="1530.419" dur="5.371">actually have another Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="1531.86" dur="7.11">right so I think you has said multiple</text>
  <text start="1535.79" dur="4.769">times or given the full case for why a</text>
  <text start="1538.97" dur="5.76">second Special Counsel wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1540.559" dur="5.851">necessarily be the best thing for this</text>
  <text start="1544.73" dur="4.26">it would just make things drag out</text>
  <text start="1546.41" dur="4.05">longer it&amp;#39;d give the Democrats another</text>
  <text start="1548.99" dur="3.179">two years to stall until the next</text>
  <text start="1550.46" dur="4.349">election and then they could just keep</text>
  <text start="1552.169" dur="5.041">stalling indefinitely in this like</text>
  <text start="1554.809" dur="3.661">holding pattern trying to keep President</text>
  <text start="1557.21" dur="5.339">Trump from moving forward with the</text>
  <text start="1558.47" dur="7.11">agenda that he has set forth and q had</text>
  <text start="1562.549" dur="5.041">made that very clear I think so to me</text>
  <text start="1565.58" dur="5.099">when I read that I think the first thing</text>
  <text start="1567.59" dur="5.19">I think is is John Radcliffe might not</text>
  <text start="1570.679" dur="3.721">be the guy but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="1572.78" dur="2.07">that&amp;#39;s true I mean that&amp;#39;s just my</text>
  <text start="1574.4" dur="2.85">opinion</text>
  <text start="1574.85" dur="4.92">then trey Gowdy of course you know trey</text>
  <text start="1577.25" dur="4.08">Gowdy has done an incredible job in</text>
  <text start="1579.77" dur="3.42">doing all the work he did to get</text>
  <text start="1581.33" dur="3.3">everything started and I personally have</text>
  <text start="1583.19" dur="3.119">wanted trey Gowdy for the Attorney</text>
  <text start="1584.63" dur="3.87">General for quite some time I think he</text>
  <text start="1586.309" dur="4.321">would make a very good choice I think</text>
  <text start="1588.5" dur="2.89">that you know a lot of people say that</text>
  <text start="1590.63" dur="2.74">his</text>
  <text start="1591.39" dur="5.01">rhetoric that he&amp;#39;s used before and</text>
  <text start="1593.37" dur="5.73">certain things he said may preclude him</text>
  <text start="1596.4" dur="5.46">from being involved in becoming the</text>
  <text start="1599.1" dur="4.14">Attorney General so I don&amp;#39;t know why Q</text>
  <text start="1601.86" dur="3.63">is bringing this to our attention other</text>
  <text start="1603.24" dur="3.84">than to say if he was bringing it to our</text>
  <text start="1605.49" dur="4.17">attention we should start thinking about</text>
  <text start="1607.08" dur="3.81">these two individuals maybe and looking</text>
  <text start="1609.66" dur="6.54">at them a little more closely</text>
  <text start="1610.89" dur="7.74">I think trey gowdy is my that&amp;#39;s my pick</text>
  <text start="1616.2" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s who I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1618.63" dur="3.69">just saying that&amp;#39;s my guess my</text>
  <text start="1620.1" dur="4.11">speculative thought but you guys let me</text>
  <text start="1622.32" dur="3.57">know who do you think is gonna be the</text>
  <text start="1624.21" dur="3.469">new Attorney General leave that down in</text>
  <text start="1625.89" dur="4.289">the comments and I&amp;#39;d love to read that</text>
  <text start="1627.679" dur="5.021">and you could also tweet that to me over</text>
  <text start="1630.179" dur="7.171">at Justin underscore formed over here on</text>
  <text start="1632.7" dur="7.17">Twitter okay so before we go that was</text>
  <text start="1637.35" dur="5.16">the last post so like I said before we</text>
  <text start="1639.87" dur="6.679">go we have a few more things I want to</text>
  <text start="1642.51" dur="8.669">go over some credible stuff first of all</text>
  <text start="1646.549" dur="7.171">this story right here is the best story</text>
  <text start="1651.179" dur="4.861">I think we could have all hoped for</text>
  <text start="1653.72" dur="7">Hillary Clinton is planning on running</text>

  <text start="1667.2" dur="3.359">that she is actually contemplating</text>
  <text start="1668.85" dur="3.569">another run but I think the reality is</text>
  <text start="1670.559" dur="3.961">that she realizes that if the</text>
  <text start="1672.419" dur="4.801">declassification happens and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1674.52" dur="6.11">this other stuff gets uncovered then as</text>

  <text start="1972.23" dur="4.5">is being reported now and it&amp;#39;s like I</text>
  <text start="1974.44" dur="5.62">know my thoughts and prayers are with</text>
  <text start="1976.73" dur="5.25">Tucker and his family and I wrote you</text>
  <text start="1980.06" dur="5.37">know just a little tweet about it</text>
  <text start="1981.98" dur="5.94">because I was just basically saying that</text>
  <text start="1985.43" dur="4.26">I was just basically saying that it</text>

  <text start="1989.69" dur="2.1">man</text>
  <text start="1990.23" dur="3.6">and I think that the man who did that to</text>
  <text start="1991.79" dur="4.41">his daughter is a coward and I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="1993.83" dur="4.02">that he was removed from that Club and I</text>
  <text start="1996.2" dur="3.99">hope that we can all stand behind Tucker</text>

  <text start="2024.58" dur="5.43">Tucker I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and say that</text>
  <text start="2027.4" dur="4.35">the media is gonna try to use this to go</text>
  <text start="2030.01" dur="4.049">after him he&amp;#39;s one of the few people</text>

  <text start="2037.87" dur="5.07">certain things I disagree with him on</text>
  <text start="2039.52" dur="5.58">but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I don&amp;#39;t defend his</text>

  <text start="2053.74" dur="4.71">attacked in public for no good reason</text>
  <text start="2055.96" dur="6.39">other than the fact that he espouses his</text>
  <text start="2058.45" dur="6.659">own opinion on TV so that to me is is</text>
  <text start="2062.35" dur="6.42">despicable I think whoever did that to</text>
