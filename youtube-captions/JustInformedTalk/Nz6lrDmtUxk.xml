  <text start="8.28" dur="4.83">just inform talk to migrate into a lot</text>
  <text start="10.92" dur="4.5">of different things but first I always</text>
  <text start="13.11" dur="3.749">like to start out by thanking each and</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="3.09">every one of my subscribers without you</text>

  <text start="36.42" dur="4.11">available you will be notified but</text>
  <text start="38.91" dur="4.079">tonight we&amp;#39;re gonna get into this I</text>
  <text start="40.53" dur="4.38">think I kind of misread this now just as</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="4.831">I kind of I&amp;#39;m working on the theory</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="9.78">which on Brennan now we know that raisin</text>
  <text start="47.82" dur="10.8">faced traitor is the one who is being</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="6.93">mentioned here but moving forward I</text>
  <text start="58.62" dur="7.35">think I&amp;#39;ve gotten this wrong in a few</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="6.569">different ways the suggested thought</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="5.969">here is like real time or Rex Tillerson</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="5.641">but what makes more sense to me and I</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="5.401">can only credit the comment board where</text>
  <text start="73.83" dur="5.219">I&amp;#39;ve had several dozen comments pointing</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="4.86">in this direction and what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="7.621">referring to is a secretive investment</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="10.44">firm that it made the news back in let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="8.4">see this is 2016 August of 2016 where a</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="7.019">little-known group called the Rizvi</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="6.99">Traverse management group here noted in</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="6.17">their website as being heavily invested</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="6.69">in Twitter as well as playboy as well as</text>
  <text start="105.829" dur="6.04">square as we all know for taking credit</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="5.52">cards as well as other categories of</text>
  <text start="111.869" dur="7.441">entertainment and industry as well as</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="6.93">SpaceX but fascinating article here when</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="3.72">you look at what happened</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="3.9">it says the secretive firm investors</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="4.5">just dumped half its firms Twitter stock</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="4.549">they had a huge stake in it they jumped</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="5.91">out really quick and it&amp;#39;s like who is</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="6.551">Suhail rizvi right</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="6.63">well he&amp;#39;s the head manager of this group</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="7.08">the rizvi Traverse management and they</text>
  <text start="140.07" dur="6.48">just happen to have a big stake in a</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="8.37">little company called Facebook and they</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="7.62">bought their stake before it was an IPO</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="5.55">so before it was initially made public</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="5.55">as an offering so that you you or I</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="6.45">could go buy it on the stock market this</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="5.82">firm was heavily invested in it so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="3.6">take a look at what they actually did</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="4.11">with that investment along with other</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="5.7">investments like you saw Facebook they</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="7.29">had Facebook Twitter SpaceX all this</text>
  <text start="172.95" dur="5.58">stuff right now here&amp;#39;s a Reuters article</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="3.48">that I think is really important when</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re covering this information here</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="5.49">but it says insight little-known</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="6.66">hollywood investor poised to score with</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="6.99">Twitter IPO now this is the article I</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="7.77">got the information from it&amp;#39;s an article</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="7.95">from I want to say 2013 October 3rd here</text>
  <text start="197.49" dur="6.36">and what it&amp;#39;s referring to is that the</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="6.6">Rizvi Traverse was actually invested in</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="9.59">the primary public offering of Twitter</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="9.66">and they even mentioned down here that</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="4.66">it says from their Rizvi scored stakes</text>
  <text start="217.11" dur="3.12">and some of the most sought-after</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="4.86">internet startups from Facebook Inc</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="5.04">before it went public to square and</text>
  <text start="222.96" dur="4.41">Flipboard so these guys are really big</text>
  <text start="225.27" dur="8.49">heavy hitters they have a lot of money</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="10.44">in there and who is Rou hail or Suhail</text>

  <text start="237.81" dur="5.34">time of this article and he had enough</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="6.3">money to actually he guards the secrecy</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="5.43">so zealously that he employs a person to</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="4.17">take down his Wikipedia entry and scrub</text>
  <text start="248.58" dur="3.84">his picture from the internet well I</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="6.289">mean yeah yeah because you know once</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="6.78">they associate Wikipedia with YouTube</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="6.071">heaven forbid that my video popped up in</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="5.83">somebody&amp;#39;s suggested video ad or they</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="4.87">came to the channel one to watch it</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="4.83">they saw the the Wikipedia that&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="267.49" dur="5.34">know I can&amp;#39;t help it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="5.61">associated with it apparently if they</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="5.309">deem my video to be conspiratorial then</text>
  <text start="275.47" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;ll look at that and go oh I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="278.139" dur="5.941">know anything about hail or Suhail Rizvi</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="4.89">and who is sue hail recipe on Wikipedia</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="4.02">well I guess this is the scrubbed</text>
  <text start="285.85" dur="5.28">version of who he actually is but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="4.5">of Indian descent his nationality is he</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="4.92">was born here he went to the Wharton</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="6.81">School of Business at the University of</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="6.33">Pennsylvania he&amp;#39;s been a investment</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="4.8">capitalists or venture capitalists</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="5.52">whatever you want to call it for quite</text>
  <text start="304.21" dur="6.48">some time and he&amp;#39;s responsible for doing</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="5.97">a lot of things here now the firm helped</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="5.37">Hugh Hefner by that playboy in 2011 and</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="5.34">then I think they leveraged him out of</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="4.98">it so think of it this way a lot of</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="3.03">people and you guys let me know what you</text>
  <text start="321.04" dur="2.79">think in the comments here because</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="2.88">sometimes I like to riff in these videos</text>
  <text start="323.83" dur="5.399">and I think this is a great opportunity</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="5.94">to riff without giving you any specifics</text>
  <text start="329.229" dur="5.821">or telling you exactly what may or may</text>
  <text start="331.06" dur="8.1">not be the truth I don&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="5.79">heard speculation and rumor actually let</text>
  <text start="339.16" dur="4.28">me let me rephrase that I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="6.03">speculation that has been verified with</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="5.65">certain documentation through different</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="5.1">articles that I&amp;#39;ve read that actually</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="4.889">suggests that Hugh Hefner maybe it may</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="5.19">have been one of the key people in</text>
  <text start="353.979" dur="7.201">revealing information to the Trump</text>
  <text start="357.16" dur="7.53">administration and the newly revised</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="7.38">intelligence agencies after Trump came</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="5.88">into power and if this is true then you</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="6.57">can only imagine what kind of secrets</text>
  <text start="370.57" dur="8.67">were shared with certain high ups about</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="6.599">certain other high ups that ultimately</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="5.58">we can make our speculations all day but</text>
  <text start="381.729" dur="6.421">we all know about the pedophilia the</text>
  <text start="384.82" dur="5.909">luciferianism the the awful things that</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="5.31">go on in Hollywood so we can only use</text>
  <text start="390.729" dur="5.69">our imagination to see what could</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="5.01">actually be happening in reality there</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="3.131">definitely something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="2.79">definitely something that needs to be</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="4.02">investigated but I&amp;#39;m gonna leave that</text>
  <text start="401.26" dur="4.31">for another episode entirely now getting</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="4.08">into a person that I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of</text>
  <text start="405.57" dur="5.11">obviously if you&amp;#39;ve watched any of my</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="6">last few videos but Mark Zuckerberg now</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="4.92">I don&amp;#39;t have anything against him on a</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="4.02">personal level because I don&amp;#39;t know him</text>
  <text start="415.6" dur="5.22">personally but I can tell you right now</text>
  <text start="417.67" dur="4.83">that as far as what he&amp;#39;s doing in the</text>
  <text start="420.82" dur="5.79">public domain and what his business</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="6.48">propagates and what his his social</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="5.54">network has done to society as a whole I</text>
  <text start="428.98" dur="7.68">do have some grudges with him now</text>
  <text start="432.15" dur="8.65">begrudgingly I say that because I use</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="6.42">Facebook and I don&amp;#39;t necessarily believe</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="6.24">that it had to have been created and</text>
  <text start="443.08" dur="7.02">turned into this tool for deception that</text>
  <text start="447.04" dur="5.13">has been but ultimately that&amp;#39;s how these</text>
  <text start="450.1" dur="3.51">these things start now one thing you</text>
  <text start="452.17" dur="4.92">have to know about Zuckerberg is that</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="8.28">some of the first main investors in his</text>
  <text start="457.09" dur="8.7">actual company were according to his own</text>
  <text start="461.89" dur="6.24">words from Google and that to me throws</text>
  <text start="465.79" dur="5.879">up a red flag immediately now we all</text>
  <text start="468.13" dur="8.48">know Google was co-opted in the early or</text>
  <text start="471.669" dur="8.25">the late 90s in the early 2000s by the</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="6.01">let&amp;#39;s say one of the three-letter</text>
  <text start="479.919" dur="5.881">agencies and what they actually did is</text>
  <text start="482.62" dur="6.11">they went in there and they just pumped</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="6.3">money in and then they took it over and</text>
  <text start="488.73" dur="8.2">covertly made it into a a state asset</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="9.12">which you know ultimately only time will</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="5.97">tell what that means for you and me but</text>
  <text start="501.22" dur="4.89">we see some of the effects coming out</text>
  <text start="502.9" dur="5.4">now where obviously there&amp;#39;s a biased</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="4.41">obviously there&amp;#39;s propaganda obviously</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="4.739">it&amp;#39;s been made legal to propagandize the</text>
  <text start="510.52" dur="3.87">masses and obviously people like</text>
  <text start="513.039" dur="3.69">Zuckerberg could have been co-opted</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="4.35">pretty easily under a rogue</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="4.471">administration such as the last one that</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="5.64">we went through where they were not</text>
  <text start="521.2" dur="6.33">acting in my opinion in the interest of</text>
  <text start="524.38" dur="5.31">you or me or anyone else in this country</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="5.04">besides the Socialists who want to</text>
  <text start="529.69" dur="5.19">destroy it the Communists who wanted to</text>
  <text start="532.57" dur="4.38">the globalists who want to destroy it</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="5.76">the people who want to break down our</text>
  <text start="536.95" dur="7.73">borders steal our wealth and ruin our</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="6.69">country and take away our sovereignty so</text>
  <text start="544.68" dur="5.77">that&amp;#39;s the cabal that we&amp;#39;re up against</text>
  <text start="547.33" dur="6.69">right so ultimately this is Mark</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="6.54">Zuckerberg he saved tens of millions of</text>
  <text start="554.02" dur="6.99">dollars by selling Facebook stock ahead</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="6.78">of Monday&amp;#39;s decline so there you go I</text>
  <text start="561.01" dur="6.45">mean you guys look at that for what it</text>
  <text start="563.77" dur="5.7">is right there is no other way to</text>
  <text start="567.46" dur="3.629">interpret it other than he had</text>
  <text start="569.47" dur="4.32">foreknowledge now how did he have</text>
  <text start="571.089" dur="5.641">foreknowledge well I wonder I wonder if</text>
  <text start="573.79" dur="5.31">it had something to do with this even</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="5.37">though he sold it off well before that I</text>
  <text start="579.1" dur="7.98">wonder if something was got him shook</text>
  <text start="582.1" dur="8.58">I mean think of it this way right you</text>
  <text start="587.08" dur="5.55">only have so much you can point to in a</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="4.02">set of coincidences before you go oh</text>
  <text start="592.63" dur="4.53">well you know this is kind of making</text>
  <text start="594.7" dur="4.86">sense now and I&amp;#39;ve been following this Q</text>
  <text start="597.16" dur="5.34">thing since pretty much the beginning in</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="7.56">October of 2017 and I can tell you right</text>
  <text start="602.5" dur="6.99">now that this isn&amp;#39;t the first time Mark</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="4.74">Zuckerberg has been mentioned so for all</text>
  <text start="609.49" dur="6.12">of you who are like new this video just</text>
  <text start="611.86" dur="6.99">scroll through my videos I mean gosh my</text>
  <text start="615.61" dur="6.62">last five or six videos well before his</text>
  <text start="618.85" dur="5.88">big sell-off we&amp;#39;re talking about what</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="5.95">kind of person I believe Mark Zuckerberg</text>
  <text start="624.73" dur="6.09">to be not giving you an exact opinion</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="5.07">other than to say that I gave you</text>
  <text start="630.82" dur="5.04">evidence about what his personal beliefs</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="5.04">were and what his personal texts were</text>
  <text start="635.86" dur="5.49">with certain individuals as we will go</text>
  <text start="638.29" dur="4.799">through again in this video briefly when</text>
  <text start="641.35" dur="6.03">you look at what he said about people</text>
  <text start="643.089" dur="5.461">that he didn&amp;#39;t like I mean this is the</text>
  <text start="647.38" dur="2.34">kind of guy we&amp;#39;re dealing with here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="648.55" dur="2.37">gonna read through this because I didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="653.08" dur="2.82">gonna get into a little bit of what his</text>
  <text start="654.49" dur="3.719">character is like this is a Mark</text>
  <text start="655.9" dur="5.309">Zuckerberg from years ago let&amp;#39;s say it</text>
  <text start="658.209" dur="6.301">was a 10 years ago maybe but he says</text>
  <text start="661.209" dur="3.861">yeah so if you ever need info about</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="3.35">anyone</text>

  <text start="688.19" dur="6.4">person like Zuckerberg in my opinion it</text>

  <text start="797.23" dur="5.49">rizvi being one of the first investors</text>
  <text start="799.57" dur="4.47">before the IPO was put out he&amp;#39;s put a</text>

  <text start="847.18" dur="7.769">headlines in the news to jump or drop</text>
  <text start="851.61" dur="5.349">stock prices and then using the</text>
  <text start="854.949" dur="4.2">information of well those stories going</text>
  <text start="856.959" dur="4.651">up then they can take that and actually</text>
  <text start="859.149" dur="5.661">aggregate it into a stock investment</text>
  <text start="861.61" dur="6.06">that becomes a multi-million dollar a</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="5.23">gain for them right so you have this</text>
