  <text start="239.519" dur="5.31">because I think this gives us a good</text>
  <text start="241.829" dur="6.06">idea of where everything&amp;#39;s coming from</text>

  <text start="254.549" dur="4.831">club they were all part of right and</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="6.24">this is one example of something that we</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="6.06">need to dive deeper into right the story</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="4.21">here Obama gave Pearson publishing 350</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="3.76">million dollars to</text>
  <text start="266.98" dur="6.3">Common Core text and Pearson gave them</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="7.23">maybe coincidentally I guess a 65</text>
  <text start="273.28" dur="5.7">million dollar book deal so this is the</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="4.74">kind of quid pro pro cronyism and</text>
  <text start="278.98" dur="4.5">corruption that we&amp;#39;re trying to uproot</text>
  <text start="281.17" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re trying to fix our political system</text>
  <text start="283.48" dur="4.53">fix our two-tiered justice system expose</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="5.1">these evil criminals in the process and</text>
  <text start="288.01" dur="5.28">expose the fake news who covers up for</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="4.44">them who let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ll get into that a</text>
  <text start="293.29" dur="4.05">little bit later but have been basically</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="6.54">complicit from day one because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.34" dur="7.22">it&amp;#39;s all the same you know elite clubs</text>
  <text start="301.48" dur="5.94">that they all run in the same circles so</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="5.5">this is where I want to start you know</text>
  <text start="307.42" dur="4.83">the the question has to be just stated</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="4.53">you know is this a quit an example of</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="3.48">quid pro quo as we see with Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="2.85">and we&amp;#39;re going to get into the IG</text>
  <text start="315.73" dur="3.42">report in just a second here we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="321.19" dur="5.1">the hoax hearings if you want to call</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="5.28">them what they really are and when you</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="4.61">look at all these facts in the way that</text>
  <text start="328" dur="5.01">they pile up all I can say is that</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="3.88">whether it&amp;#39;s hunter Biden getting</text>
  <text start="333.01" dur="5.07">hundreds of thousands of dollars from</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="5.25">the Ukrainians if it&amp;#39;s you know a</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="5.22">hundred Biden get a billion dollar-plus</text>
  <text start="340.03" dur="5.55">deal with China or it&amp;#39;s Christopher</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="4.77">Hynes John Kerry steps on working with</text>
  <text start="345.58" dur="4.5">hunter Biden or it&amp;#39;s Obama getting a</text>

  <text start="352.42" dur="5.01">skin and with the Clinton Foundation I</text>
  <text start="354.28" dur="4.74">mean whatever it is it&amp;#39;s like everywhere</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="3.96">we look with these people who are trying</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="4.8">to call us you know crazy conspiracy</text>
  <text start="361.39" dur="4.56">theorists if not that deplorable if not</text>
  <text start="363.82" dur="3.99">that than racist they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="4.17">engaging in corruption selling out our</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="5.25">country enriching themselves and trying</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="5.1">to paint it as you know we&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="4.77">criminals for trying to investigate them</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="4.86">as cute predicted like you said that</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="5.4">they would paint it as attacking your</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="4.92">political enemies correct so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="383.23" dur="5.28">I wanted to start with this story in</text>
  <text start="385" dur="7.38">particular and the new FISA AG report</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="6.36">this is the big story right and this</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="3.69">headline basically sums a lot of it up</text>
  <text start="394.87" dur="5.01">here but we&amp;#39;re gonna get into a lot more</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="4.81">detail as well this is from Joe hop over</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="2.92">at the gateway planet</text>
  <text start="400.88" dur="3.42">and about how the igf ice report has</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="4.89">revealed that Obama administration</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="5.85">falsely claimed Russia bribed the Trump</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="4.94">campaign now why would they make that</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="7.11">false accusation oh I don&amp;#39;t know to</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="6.64">create a precedent to spy on the future</text>
  <text start="417.26" dur="4.23">president Donald Trump in order to try</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="6.75">to gain a political advantage in our</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="7.85">2016 US presidential election possibly</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="5.97">maybe that&amp;#39;s if you just were - you know</text>
  <text start="429.34" dur="5.32">logically objectively tie things</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="4.71">together and not view it from a skewed</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="4.32">and biased viewpoint as the fake news</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="5.01">does on a regular basis you have to look</text>
  <text start="438.98" dur="5.58">at it objectively logically that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="441.71" dur="5.07">what the the underlying fact is I think</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="3.99">when we look at this IG feist report and</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.76">more broadly I think we have to remember</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="6.93">that inspector general Horowitz never</text>
  <text start="452.54" dur="5.37">had any prosecutorial authority he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="455.48" dur="3.57">out there you know going to be he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="457.91" dur="3.24">gonna be the one prosecuting these</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="4.23">crimes if they&amp;#39;re really crimes that</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="4.85">happen and he&amp;#39;s not running around with</text>
  <text start="463.28" dur="5.55">a badge and a gun like some you know</text>
  <text start="466" dur="6.73">police officer what he is doing though</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="6.39">is giving us an insight into exactly how</text>
  <text start="472.73" dur="4.98">big it was now he can say what he wants</text>
  <text start="475.22" dur="4.05">about intent and you know whether or not</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="3.99">it was a conspiracy because none of that</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="5.16">matters the facts speak for themselves</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="5.4">and the facts show as president Trump</text>
  <text start="484.43" dur="4.59">said earlier in this video that you saw</text>
  <text start="487.1" dur="3.87">at the beginning this was a criminal</text>
  <text start="489.02" dur="3.87">conspiracy basically against him it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.97" dur="5.55">basically what I said I think something</text>
  <text start="492.89" dur="6.51">that effect and the sooner people wake</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="5.28">up to the fact that you know Durham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.4" dur="4.38">investigation is going to be about this</text>
  <text start="501.8" dur="5.46">particular abuse and how they try to</text>

  <text start="639.02" dur="4.53">when you think about that you have to</text>
  <text start="640.97" dur="5.19">understand Attorney General bar came out</text>
  <text start="643.55" dur="6.21">today and basically derided the IG</text>
  <text start="646.16" dur="5.52">report and saying that it was obvious</text>
  <text start="649.76" dur="4.5">what I just put together there for you</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.38">which was that it was a conspiracy put</text>
  <text start="654.26" dur="4.86">on against the president by these people</text>
  <text start="656.06" dur="5.13">who weren&amp;#39;t just making mistakes they</text>
  <text start="659.12" dur="4.53">were intentionally plotting to overthrow</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="4.95">the president to frame him for something</text>
  <text start="663.65" dur="3.9">he didn&amp;#39;t do and to use the</text>

  <text start="667.55" dur="5.73">around him with in order to spy on them</text>
  <text start="669.89" dur="4.86">illegally so I don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="673.28" dur="3.3">so hard for people really good about all</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="3.21">this this is the story coming out the</text>
  <text start="676.58" dur="3.99">epoch times here&amp;#39;s the official</text>

  <text start="685.1" dur="4.5">release of the IG report or I excuse me</text>
  <text start="686.99" dur="3.72">I think just before it saying this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="689.6" dur="2.97">only going to read the important part</text>
  <text start="690.71" dur="3.69">here it says the Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="692.57" dur="4.32">reports or the Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.4" dur="4.95">report now makes clear the FBI launched</text>
  <text start="696.89" dur="4.74">an intrusive investigation of a u.s.</text>
  <text start="699.35" dur="4.88">presidential campaign on the thinnest of</text>
  <text start="701.63" dur="5.82">suspicions that in my view were</text>
  <text start="704.23" dur="5.95">insufficient to justify the steps taken</text>
  <text start="707.45" dur="4.59">it is also clear that from its inception</text>
  <text start="710.18" dur="3.51">the evidence produced by the</text>
  <text start="712.04" dur="7.2">investigation was consistently</text>
  <text start="713.69" dur="7.65">exculpatory so I don&amp;#39;t even understand</text>
  <text start="719.24" dur="3.54">how people are really going on the fake</text>
  <text start="721.34" dur="4.13">news lying except that they just</text>
  <text start="722.78" dur="5.46">obviously are paid to lie at this point</text>
  <text start="725.47" dur="4.15">it goes on says nevertheless the</text>
  <text start="728.24" dur="3.63">investigation and surveillance was</text>
  <text start="729.62" dur="3.9">pushed forward for the duration of the</text>
  <text start="731.87" dur="3.75">campaign and deep into the president</text>
  <text start="733.52" dur="3.78">Trump&amp;#39;s administration in the rush to</text>
  <text start="735.62" dur="4.26">obtain and maintain FISA surveillance of</text>
  <text start="737.3" dur="4.38">Trump campaign associates FBI officials</text>
  <text start="739.88" dur="3.95">misled the FISA Court or made a critical</text>
  <text start="741.68" dur="4.8">exculpatory facts from their filings and</text>
  <text start="743.83" dur="4.78">suppressed or ignored information</text>
  <text start="746.48" dur="7.98">negating the reliability of their</text>
  <text start="748.61" dur="7.17">principal source so I mean this is the</text>
  <text start="754.46" dur="3.99">Attorney General of the United States</text>
  <text start="755.78" dur="6.18">coming forward and laying it on the line</text>
  <text start="758.45" dur="5.66">saying everything that the Inspector</text>
  <text start="761.96" dur="5.46">General found was correct except in his</text>
  <text start="764.11" dur="6.07">assertions that there was some sort of</text>
  <text start="767.42" dur="4.47">predicate for this in intrusive as he</text>
  <text start="770.18" dur="3.72">calls an investigation which we all know</text>
  <text start="771.89" dur="6.3">is just another way of saying illegal</text>
  <text start="773.9" dur="7.32">spying so here&amp;#39;s what I just want to</text>
  <text start="778.19" dur="5.43">show you that also is that there was a</text>
  <text start="781.22" dur="3.93">statement put out today by the US</text>
  <text start="783.62" dur="3.03">attorney John Durham and I just thought</text>
  <text start="785.15" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;d share with you real quick since it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="786.65" dur="4.44">pretty short it says I have the utmost</text>

  <text start="791.09" dur="2.67">the Inspector General in the</text>
  <text start="791.99" dur="3.69">comprehensive work that went into the</text>
  <text start="793.76" dur="4.59">report prepared by mr. Horwitz and staff</text>

  <text start="812.78" dur="4.5">to date while our investigation is going</text>
  <text start="815.42" dur="3.39">on going last month we advise the</text>
  <text start="817.28" dur="3.75">expected general that we do not agree</text>
  <text start="818.81" dur="5.07">with some of the reports conclusions as</text>
  <text start="821.03" dur="7.68">to predication and how the FBI case was</text>
  <text start="823.88" dur="6.18">open so right now we know US attorney</text>
  <text start="828.71" dur="3">John Durham who&amp;#39;s gonna have the</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="3.18">prosecutorial power to go after these</text>
  <text start="831.71" dur="5.43">people and put them on trial and give</text>
  <text start="833.24" dur="6.78">indictments this person is disagreeing</text>
  <text start="837.14" dur="5.79">with the IG report as well so with that</text>
  <text start="840.02" dur="5.91">I want to go in John Brennan right what</text>

  <text start="845.93" dur="4.98">know it and this is a big question</text>
  <text start="847.88" dur="5.1">because he did get up back in 2016 in</text>
  <text start="850.91" dur="4.41">front of Congress and basically state</text>
  <text start="852.98" dur="3.63">that there was no he didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="855.32" dur="2.91">anything about the steel dossier and</text>
  <text start="856.61" dur="3.39">that they didn&amp;#39;t use that as the</text>
  <text start="858.23" dur="4.25">predication for spying on president</text>
  <text start="860" dur="5.61">Trump whereas now today we are learning</text>
  <text start="862.48" dur="4.99">well actually that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="865.61" dur="3.69">happened you guys used an unverified</text>
  <text start="867.47" dur="4.89">piece of salacious intelligence that</text>
  <text start="869.3" dur="5.84">nobody would have trusted ever who had</text>
  <text start="872.36" dur="5.31">half a cent you know in their brain and</text>
  <text start="875.14" dur="4.27">then he went after the president why did</text>
  <text start="877.67" dur="3.99">you do it well I think it has a lot to</text>
  <text start="879.41" dur="4.5">do with what we&amp;#39;ve uncovered here Mary</text>

  <text start="883.91" dur="6.48">the America report org talking about the</text>
  <text start="886.13" dur="7.53">hammer the question really is did Obama</text>
  <text start="890.39" dur="5.28">and his top officials steel and</text>
  <text start="893.66" dur="5.04">weaponize a super-secret surveillance</text>

  <text start="898.7" dur="5.76">their political enemies and were they</text>
  <text start="900.71" dur="6.54">using that behind closed doors and using</text>
  <text start="904.46" dur="4.82">that in conjunction with what we have</text>
  <text start="907.25" dur="4.68">found about the abuse of the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="909.28" dur="4.39">you have to say that these people are</text>
  <text start="911.93" dur="3.78">the worst kinds of criminals out there</text>
  <text start="913.67" dur="3.42">this new report from Mary Fanning Allen</text>

  <text start="919.7" dur="5.48">whistleblower Dennis Montgomery&amp;#39;s story</text>

  <text start="977.14" dur="4.05">go after his enemies so this is their</text>
  <text start="979.81" dur="3.48">attempt to cover that up</text>
  <text start="981.19" dur="3.42">it looks like and I&amp;#39;ll leave this for</text>
  <text start="983.29" dur="3.66">you guys to read because there&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="5.01">letters that came forward and apparently</text>
  <text start="986.95" dur="4.98">an interesting fact that Dennis</text>
  <text start="989.62" dur="4.95">Montgomery asserts is that he tried to</text>
  <text start="991.93" dur="4.8">send letters explaining everything that</text>
  <text start="994.57" dur="4.889">I just kind of went over to all the</text>

  <text start="1023.339" dur="6.061">representatives so of that it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1027.24" dur="4.98">an interesting note to see that</text>
  <text start="1029.4" dur="4.62">Montgomery&amp;#39;s claims that when he brought</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="3.63">the information that we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
