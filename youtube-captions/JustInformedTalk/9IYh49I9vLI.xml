  <text start="272.729" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s pretty simple this is talking about</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="3.87">the harvest which I believe is referring</text>
  <text start="276.509" dur="4.291">to the FISA and the investigations that</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="5.97">have been going on from the beginning</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="7.709">since back in October of 2017 when Jeff</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="6.989">Sessions appointed US Attorney John</text>

  <text start="291.509" dur="6.421">to go after these individuals and this</text>
  <text start="296.669" dur="2.791">is something that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing in</text>
  <text start="297.93" dur="3.209">the making over the last two years it</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="4.769">takes time to build a case and we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="309.12" dur="5.97">cues reminding us of you all will recall</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.069">James commis book a higher loyalty this</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="7.109">is obviously referencing James Comey</text>
  <text start="317.129" dur="7.53">himself being a main character in this</text>
  <text start="322.199" dur="4.44">whole entire Feist report that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="324.659" dur="5.07">to come out because his decisions</text>
  <text start="326.639" dur="4.62">directly affected the way in which the</text>
  <text start="329.729" dur="4.291">Russian witch-hunt</text>
  <text start="331.259" dur="5.4">got started and how it was basically a</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="5.009">weaponization of our federal law</text>
  <text start="336.659" dur="5.611">enforcement against President Trump and</text>
  <text start="339.029" dur="5.67">this this was for totally corrupt and</text>
  <text start="342.27" dur="4.98">political reasons had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="344.699" dur="5.19">President Trump actually having any real</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="4.319">ties to Russia they manufactured the</text>
  <text start="349.889" dur="3.571">majority of that evidence and then</text>
  <text start="351.569" dur="4.951">proceeded to go after President Trump</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="6.569">based on that just meant completely</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.22">manufactured nonsense right the steel</text>
  <text start="360.029" dur="4.38">dossier which we know was an</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="5.639">amalgamation of different intelligence</text>
  <text start="364.409" dur="6.211">reports that were put together by spies</text>
  <text start="367.379" dur="4.861">working for you guessed it the clowns in</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="3.329">America at the behest of the Obama</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="5.88">administration through the five eyes</text>
  <text start="373.949" dur="7.14">intelligence pact which brought in</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="5.519">outside foreign intelligence services to</text>
  <text start="381.089" dur="4.29">actually help to conduct a surveillance</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="3.87">on President Trump and his closest</text>
  <text start="385.379" dur="5.22">allies so that they could circumvent our</text>
  <text start="387.509" dur="5.041">own laws here in the United States right</text>
  <text start="390.599" dur="4.801">because it would be illegal for let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.55" dur="4.919">say the clowns in action to be spying on</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="4.41">our own citizens well they just tasked</text>
  <text start="397.469" dur="5.511">another foreign intelligence agency with</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="5.81">it and just called it a fusion of</text>
  <text start="402.98" dur="4.29">change of information right hunters</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="3.39">become the hunted I think this is</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="5.25">another thing we&amp;#39;ve been primed for</text>
  <text start="409.01" dur="5.19">Hunter Biden why because he is pivotal</text>
  <text start="412.52" dur="3.33">he&amp;#39;s one of the linchpins to all of us</text>
  <text start="414.2" dur="4.08">remember the business</text>
  <text start="415.85" dur="5.19">Rosemont Seneca partners that he was in</text>
  <text start="418.28" dur="4.74">right was a partnership with a man named</text>
  <text start="421.04" dur="3.51">Devin Archer who nobody really talks</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="5.13">about but he&amp;#39;s a very important player</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="4.8">in all this him hunter Biden and a man</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="4.32">who went by the name of Christopher</text>
  <text start="429.35" dur="6.42">Hines yes you guessed it one of the</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="5.52">heirs to the Heinz ketchup mustard</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="5.85">whatever you guys use that stuff yeah</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s the family who happens to be the</text>
  <text start="441.62" dur="4.38">stepson of John Kerr yes you guessed it</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="4.92">so if you got all that and guessed all</text>
  <text start="446" dur="4.58">that then good for you but if you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="5.49">know that that&amp;#39;s why this is so</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="4.72">important to the upcoming FISA report</text>
  <text start="454.07" dur="2.85">and what these investigations have been</text>
  <text start="455.3" dur="2.91">doing behind the scenes because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="456.92" dur="3.84">been connecting the dots this is why</text>
  <text start="458.21" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re so afraid of Ukraine because</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="5.13">what hunter Biden did in Ukraine with</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="6">Purisima was indicative of what they</text>
  <text start="465.89" dur="4.83">were all doing basically globally and if</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="5.43">we can unravel that then that will lead</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="6.6">to more arrests I believe it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="4.8">what happened with nexium you know there</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="3.09">were there was this whole period where</text>
  <text start="478.88" dur="3.72">we were going after all the people</text>
  <text start="480.41" dur="3.72">involved with nexium which i think has</text>
  <text start="482.6" dur="5.55">to do with some other things too but but</text>
  <text start="484.13" dur="6.57">that&amp;#39;s for another time and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.15" dur="5.07">went into Jeffrey Epstein right so we</text>
  <text start="490.7" dur="3.96">kind of had that in stages this is kind</text>
  <text start="493.22" dur="4.05">of the same thing playing out I think</text>
  <text start="494.66" dur="4.95">and hunter Biden will be basically the</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="4.59">the point at which people understand how</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="4.41">the system corruption works globally and</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="3.9">how they peddle influence and power and</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="6.54">it&amp;#39;s sold I have sold our country out</text>
  <text start="505.76" dur="6.96">basically to foreign nationals and then</text>
  <text start="510.56" dur="6.03">Q says treason sedition how do you</text>
  <text start="512.72" dur="6.449">remove a liability well we&amp;#39;re here just</text>
  <text start="516.59" dur="4.86">to see what happens right six o&amp;#39;clock</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="5.551">can be dangerous I think what this is</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="5.01">talking about is that that idea that</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="6.3">there are people involved in this</text>
  <text start="526.46" dur="6.6">movement who are going to be exposed who</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="3.87">the powerful elites who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="533.06" dur="2.94">controlling and running them will not</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="3.059">want them to be</text>
  <text start="536" dur="4.379">exposed especially if this criminal</text>
  <text start="537.949" dur="4.231">investigation comes out so it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="540.379" dur="4.26">as if to say you you should be careful</text>
  <text start="542.18" dur="4.74">because the corrupt criminals that you</text>
  <text start="544.639" dur="4.56">were working with may not be happy if</text>
  <text start="546.92" dur="4.05">your name is plastered all over you know</text>
  <text start="549.199" dur="3.901">the front page of every newspaper in the</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="3.929">country as the Feist report comes out</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="3.75">and shows that you are corrupt criminal</text>
  <text start="554.899" dur="3.841">and there are other even more powerful</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="4.14">people globally who wouldn&amp;#39;t want that</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="4.289">to happen and that&amp;#39;s when you become a</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="5.61">liability and that&amp;#39;s when bad things</text>
  <text start="563.029" dur="5.55">happen but I&amp;#39;m just thinking out loud</text>
  <text start="566.6" dur="3.929">I&amp;#39;m not saying anything Bad&amp;#39;s gonna say</text>
  <text start="568.579" dur="4.05">that that is presumably I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.529" dur="4.92">being referenced there the family proud</text>
  <text start="572.629" dur="6.121">thing is just I think a reference to</text>
  <text start="575.449" dur="5.221">some sort of association with being in a</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="3.959">broader family maybe the literal</text>

  <text start="582.709" dur="5.221">would your family be proud of what</text>
  <text start="584.269" dur="5.521">you&amp;#39;re doing or broad interpretation you</text>
  <text start="587.93" dur="3.389">know what kind of family would you be</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="3.599">involved with you know we talked about</text>
  <text start="591.319" dur="4.411">the way that these corrupt criminals</text>
  <text start="593.389" dur="6.63">work is very much like some sort of mob</text>
  <text start="595.73" dur="6.06">family a Mafia family so remember that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="600.019" dur="4.531">what I think were kind of referring to</text>
  <text start="601.79" dur="4.529">there and then the next one says for</text>
  <text start="604.55" dur="3.87">those who decide to say to save the</text>
  <text start="606.319" dur="4.56">taxpayers money there is no escaping God</text>
  <text start="608.42" dur="4.62">q now a lot of people have read this is</text>
  <text start="610.879" dur="4.861">it an interpreters it&amp;#39;s a direct threat</text>
  <text start="613.04" dur="4.56">oh it&amp;#39;s incitement to violence no no I</text>
  <text start="615.74" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t see that at all do you know what I</text>
  <text start="617.6" dur="4.62">see here I see Q making a very logical</text>
  <text start="619.85" dur="4.62">statement saying these people are</text>
  <text start="622.22" dur="3.809">corrupt criminals right they know they</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="3.39">are corrupt and guilty of their crimes</text>
  <text start="626.029" dur="7.62">they are doing everything they can to</text>
  <text start="627.86" dur="7.32">avoid being caught presumably so they</text>
  <text start="633.649" dur="4.141">could save the taxpayers a lot of money</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="6.93">and save us the cost of the trial</text>
  <text start="637.79" dur="6.779">confess come forward and work with us to</text>
  <text start="642.11" dur="4.38">help save this country from these</text>
  <text start="644.569" dur="5.101">corrupt criminals who tried to sell it</text>
  <text start="646.49" dur="7.11">out because ultimately there is no</text>
  <text start="649.67" dur="5.55">escaping God so they need to be reminded</text>
  <text start="653.6" dur="5.099">of that I think just as much as we all</text>
  <text start="655.22" dur="6.479">do about the fact that what happens in</text>
  <text start="658.699" dur="4.591">this world is but a blip and then our</text>
  <text start="661.699" dur="4.921">eternal salvation is really what matters</text>
  <text start="663.29" dur="4.969">in heaven so we hope that we can bring</text>

  <text start="671.589" dur="7.22">your eternal soul anyway that&amp;#39;s how I</text>
  <text start="675.309" dur="6.63">read that and then here the next one is</text>
  <text start="678.809" dur="4.99">interesting but first a few things about</text>
  <text start="681.939" dur="3.51">the Comey thing we really jump out of</text>
  <text start="683.799" dur="3.03">that so call me up here</text>
  <text start="685.449" dur="3.57">apparently tweeted this outing us the</text>
  <text start="686.829" dur="5.581">other day and of course it&amp;#39;s got the why</text>
  <text start="689.019" dur="5.04">in the brackets there and we know that</text>
  <text start="692.41" dur="4.709">that&amp;#39;s something Q has been referencing</text>
  <text start="694.059" dur="5.64">to reference Comey for quite some time</text>
  <text start="697.119" dur="4.91">and here&amp;#39;s James Comey statement you</text>
  <text start="699.699" dur="5.31">can&amp;#39;t promote principled anti-corruption</text>
  <text start="702.029" dur="5.47">action without pissing off corrupt</text>
  <text start="705.009" dur="4.8">people and this is from George Kent the</text>
  <text start="707.499" dur="4.95">Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who</text>
  <text start="709.809" dur="5.82">is I believe in front of Congress right</text>

  <text start="715.629" dur="4.32">President Trump in this whole Ukrainian</text>

  <text start="722.109" dur="5.52">Adam Schiff shifty Schiff so this is</text>
  <text start="726.339" dur="2.97">something that&amp;#39;s interesting you know he</text>
  <text start="727.629" dur="3.81">makes this reference and then cute or</text>
  <text start="729.309" dur="6.15">excuse me koni makes this reference then</text>
  <text start="731.439" dur="7.95">q retorts with what we see here the why</text>
  <text start="735.459" dur="6.62">and the reference to a higher loyalty</text>
  <text start="739.389" dur="5.79">which was in the name of his book so</text>
  <text start="742.079" dur="4.63">these people are going to be exposed</text>
  <text start="745.179" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re obviously desperate and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="746.709" dur="3.63">had these communication these ways of</text>
  <text start="748.869" dur="3.09">communicating for quite some time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.339" dur="3.72">going to talk about this in a second</text>
  <text start="751.959" dur="4.65">here these secret paths of communication</text>
  <text start="754.059" dur="4.411">first it was like the Gmail drafts that</text>
  <text start="756.609" dur="5.45">we figured out from Q then it was the</text>
  <text start="758.47" dur="5.579">Xbox and ps4 chat logs other things</text>
  <text start="762.059" dur="4">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about all that in a</text>
  <text start="764.049" dur="5.16">minute here but but let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="766.059" dur="5.07">next one the next thing we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="769.209" dur="3.75">about is this tweet that Q points us to</text>
  <text start="771.129" dur="4.38">right and Q says many who represent us</text>
  <text start="772.959" dur="5.22">do not love us now what is this</text>
  <text start="775.509" dur="5.67">referring to well it&amp;#39;s this video that</text>
  <text start="778.179" dur="6.69">seems to show it&amp;#39;s hard to really say</text>
  <text start="781.179" dur="6.78">for sure but seems to show that during a</text>
  <text start="784.869" dur="4.97">9/11 ceremony in 2011 as an honor guard</text>
  <text start="787.959" dur="4.74">was respecting our American flag</text>
  <text start="789.839" dur="7.54">Michelle seems to turn to Hussein and</text>
  <text start="792.699" dur="7.47">say all this for a expletive flag and in</text>
  <text start="797.379" dur="3.481">then it says here in the tweet look at</text>
  <text start="800.169" dur="2.881">his</text>
  <text start="800.86" dur="4.65">spreche and as he nods in agreement and</text>
  <text start="803.05" dur="3.72">if you watch the video it seems like</text>
  <text start="805.51" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s very possible that she could have</text>
  <text start="806.77" dur="7.53">said that so is that what she said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="811.69" dur="4.85">hard to say but given what we know and</text>
  <text start="814.3" dur="5.43">all the things that seem to be adding up</text>
  <text start="816.54" dur="5.26">as far as the circumstantial evidence as</text>
  <text start="819.73" dur="4.5">to what happened with the way that</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="5.24">Obama&amp;#39;s administration was seemingly a</text>
  <text start="824.23" dur="5.25">put you know surveilling their political</text>
  <text start="827.04" dur="4.66">adversaries and doing other things that</text>
  <text start="829.48" dur="3.66">were very illegal I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="831.7" dur="3.54">surprised that this was their sentiment</text>
  <text start="833.14" dur="5.46">behind closed doors I&amp;#39;ll just put it out</text>
  <text start="835.24" dur="5.25">there I&amp;#39;d be I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="838.6" dur="4.83">this was just the tip of the iceberg as</text>
  <text start="840.49" dur="5.55">far as their vitriolic hate for this</text>
  <text start="843.43" dur="5.73">country but I&amp;#39;ll leave that for you guys</text>
  <text start="846.04" dur="4.74">to decide on your own the next one here</text>
  <text start="849.16" dur="4.56">is very interesting right this is the</text>
  <text start="850.78" dur="5.76">big one kinda so it gives us a link to</text>
  <text start="853.72" dur="4.35">this it&amp;#39;s a Star Wars game right I guess</text>
  <text start="856.54" dur="3.24">you download it and you play it I</text>
  <text start="858.07" dur="3.33">haven&amp;#39;t downloaded it I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="859.78" dur="3.57">want to play it but I can tell you right</text>
  <text start="861.4" dur="5.97">now this is something keeps pointing us</text>
  <text start="863.35" dur="7.08">to for a very good reason so Q says how</text>
  <text start="867.37" dur="5.3">do select bad actors attempt comms</text>
  <text start="870.43" dur="4.86">without signals intelligence collection</text>
  <text start="872.67" dur="7.33">rebellion or Empire private invite-only</text>
  <text start="875.29" dur="8.43">factions dark to light q so think about</text>
  <text start="880" dur="6.09">this what is this game it is just</text>
  <text start="883.72" dur="4.11">another online game that you can play</text>
  <text start="886.09" dur="4.44">and you can have private you know</text>
  <text start="887.83" dur="4.83">battles with friends or whatever and I</text>
  <text start="890.53" dur="4.68">guess you can actually probably have</text>
  <text start="892.66" dur="4.53">some sort of in-game chat right some</text>
  <text start="895.21" dur="5.37">some way to communicate with the other</text>
  <text start="897.19" dur="6.69">players right and if you think about it</text>
  <text start="900.58" dur="6.35">this is the perfect place to hide open</text>
  <text start="903.88" dur="6.96">communications right sifting through a</text>
  <text start="906.93" dur="7.15">huge plethora of information that is</text>
  <text start="910.84" dur="6.33">being constantly constantly amplified</text>
  <text start="914.08" dur="5.67">that is somewhere that you could maybe</text>
  <text start="917.17" dur="3.72">possibly hide communications because</text>
  <text start="919.75" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re never gonna hide anything from</text>
  <text start="920.89" dur="6.12">the data collection that&amp;#39;s happening but</text>
  <text start="923.74" dur="5.13">you can sometimes bury it within such a</text>
  <text start="927.01" dur="3.78">large amount of data that it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="928.87" dur="3.54">impossible to find because you got to</text>
  <text start="930.79" dur="3.15">understand that even though they can</text>
  <text start="932.41" dur="2.29">collect all the data in the world</text>
  <text start="933.94" dur="3.22">basically</text>
  <text start="934.7" dur="4.95">to be able to process that data and to</text>
  <text start="937.16" dur="4.8">be able to actually analytically look at</text>
  <text start="939.65" dur="4.14">it and pull out things that you need is</text>
  <text start="941.96" dur="3.66">actually quite difficult and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="943.79" dur="3.36">actually working on that&amp;#39;s the next</text>
  <text start="945.62" dur="4.22">evolution of computing to go down</text>
  <text start="947.15" dur="6.72">another rabbit hole for another time but</text>
  <text start="949.84" dur="5.8">this is fascinating because what what</text>
  <text start="953.87" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re trying to say is I think what Q</text>
  <text start="955.64" dur="4.17">is trying to say is they&amp;#39;re using these</text>
  <text start="957.11" dur="5.16">systems as backdoor communications areas</text>
  <text start="959.81" dur="5.04">remember this post from August of 2018</text>
  <text start="962.27" dur="7.2">where Q tells us about the texts and</text>
  <text start="964.85" dur="7.41">emails and Gmail drafts and ham radio</text>
  <text start="969.47" dur="6">communications pate PlayStation Xbox</text>
  <text start="972.26" dur="6.69">chat logs right how James Comey</text>
  <text start="975.47" dur="7.31">and Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer Larry</text>
  <text start="978.95" dur="7.16">Lynch and number two who&amp;#39;s Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="982.78" dur="10.41">Nelly or and Sally Yates were all</text>
  <text start="986.11" dur="11.22">communicating on these other alternative</text>
  <text start="993.19" dur="7.27">communications methods in order to avoid</text>
  <text start="997.33" dur="4.51">surveillance that the wide spectrum of</text>
  <text start="1000.46" dur="3.63">surveillance is going on with the NSA</text>
  <text start="1001.84" dur="4.02">and other organizations were primarily</text>
  <text start="1004.09" dur="5.13">the NSA right in their metadata</text>
  <text start="1005.86" dur="4.95">collection so these people are having</text>
  <text start="1009.22" dur="3.42">these private communications with one</text>
  <text start="1010.81" dur="4.05">another using things like ham radios</text>
  <text start="1012.64" dur="4.89">right to avoid detection and PlayStation</text>
  <text start="1014.86" dur="2.91">and Xbox chat logs and now Q&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="1017.53" dur="2.85">us</text>
  <text start="1017.77" dur="5.49">guess what we&amp;#39;re watching everything</text>
  <text start="1020.38" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re doing and maybe if Comey or all</text>
  <text start="1023.26" dur="3.15">of his friends are over there playing</text>
  <text start="1024.58" dur="5.06">Star Wars and having little chats with</text>
  <text start="1026.41" dur="5.97">one another there may be some</text>
  <text start="1029.64" dur="5.32">individuals watching let&amp;#39;s just put it</text>
  <text start="1032.38" dur="6.09">that way and listening and documenting</text>
  <text start="1034.96" dur="6.33">and building a case so that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1038.47" dur="5.37">to take into consideration and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1041.29" dur="4.56">what Q&amp;#39;s telling us here possibly is</text>
  <text start="1043.84" dur="3.27">happening behind the scenes so you guys</text>
  <text start="1045.85" dur="2.37">would let me know what you think down in</text>
  <text start="1047.11" dur="3.51">the description there&amp;#39;s a few more</text>
