  <text start="1069.94" dur="4.38">thing and that&amp;#39;s going to be just</text>
  <text start="1072.16" dur="3.6">remembering verses that we know more</text>
  <text start="1074.32" dur="3.87">important I know a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="1075.76" dur="4.14">there especially those who I love and</text>
  <text start="1078.19" dur="3.65">care about are going through a hard</text>
  <text start="1079.9" dur="4.83">times</text>
  <text start="1081.84" dur="6.79">unfortunately that is the way that we</text>
  <text start="1084.73" dur="6.51">have to deal with situations in time in</text>

  <text start="1091.24" dur="4.35">through trials that we have to overcome</text>

  <text start="1103.95" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s just reminding us how to praise and</text>
  <text start="1106.98" dur="4.2">love God so we&amp;#39;re gonna read right</text>
  <text start="1109.47" dur="5.37">through it very quickly</text>
  <text start="1111.18" dur="6.72">it says sing a new song to the Lord for</text>
  <text start="1114.84" dur="6.09">he has performed wonders his right hand</text>
  <text start="1117.9" dur="5.82">and holy arm have won him victory the</text>
