  <text start="55.77" dur="5.55">where dr. Corsi had been putting out</text>
  <text start="58.379" dur="5.34">information that was very interesting to</text>
  <text start="61.32" dur="6.03">hear and it was very enlightening in</text>
  <text start="63.719" dur="5.371">certain regards to letting us know about</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="4.32">certain aspects of what q was posting</text>
  <text start="69.09" dur="4.47">but now it seems as though he has taken</text>

  <text start="76.32" dur="4.89">things but what I&amp;#39;m going to talk about</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="11.28">what dr. Corsi has a lot to do with the</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="11.07">fact that he is being accused on most of</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="4.949">the forms now and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="6.589">interpreting Q&amp;#39;s post to say that what</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="4.07">he is engaged in is a sort of</text>
  <text start="100.13" dur="6.489">profiteering off of the Q post where</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="5.669">he&amp;#39;s not actually believer in the</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="5.811">movement and that he&amp;#39;s actually trying</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="6.951">to warn us against following q which</text>
  <text start="112.43" dur="5.28">would be contradictory to what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="115.25" dur="6.369">encountered so far Q&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="117.71" dur="7.659">predominantly right in pretty much every</text>

  <text start="372.36" dur="6.66">the world when we break down these posts</text>
  <text start="374.069" dur="7.771">together so first thing logically mass</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="6.929">exodus in DC well article from a while</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="7.919">ago September of 2017 talks about this</text>
  <text start="385.949" dur="7.321">mass exodus that was happening as the</text>
  <text start="389.759" dur="5.431">House GOP was worrying about how members</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="4.019">were getting out of the way because they</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="4.44">understood the Trump train was coming so</text>
  <text start="397.289" dur="3.751">they knew who was in control and I think</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s the takeaway from this</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="3.84">this has just happened you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="403.14" dur="5.31">picture of Paul Ryan here almost</text>
  <text start="404.88" dur="6.48">fortuitously taken if you look at the</text>
  <text start="408.45" dur="4.56">date here from September 14 2017 and now</text>
  <text start="411.36" dur="3.48">he is not seeking reelection he has</text>
  <text start="413.01" dur="3.96">decided to resign from his office and</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="4.67">his position as the Speaker of the House</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="4.92">for good reason because he&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="419.51" dur="6.52">been implicated in some kind of</text>
  <text start="421.89" dur="7.92">nefarious activities so please follow me</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="5.97">on this as we go forward but mass exodus</text>
  <text start="429.81" dur="4.2">corporate CEOs now you have an article</text>
  <text start="432" dur="3.96">here out of Bloomberg talking about how</text>
  <text start="434.01" dur="3.12">and this was from a while ago - around</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="4.26">that same time where they were talking</text>
  <text start="437.13" dur="5.58">about how the the business councils that</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="5.45">Trump put together with all the CEOs in</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="5.1">order to figure out things they ended up</text>
  <text start="445.67" dur="4.39">dissolving and the CEOs ended up leaving</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="4.47">well that&amp;#39;s probably because let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="3.81">quite honest Trump probably sat down in</text>
  <text start="452.28" dur="3.12">the room with them and said look I</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="5.01">understand what you&amp;#39;re doing I</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="5.61">understand that you&amp;#39;re embezzling money</text>
  <text start="458.88" dur="3.81">out of the American taxpayer I</text>
  <text start="461.01" dur="3.9">understand that what you&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="8.28">basically tantamount to economic</text>
  <text start="464.91" dur="7.71">extortion allegedly and it&amp;#39;s gonna stop</text>
  <text start="470.97" dur="3.99">the buck stops here</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="4.86">so when Trump&amp;#39;s telling him this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.96" dur="5.19">obvious that they are telling them this</text>
  <text start="477.48" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s obvious they don&amp;#39;t really want to</text>
  <text start="480.15" dur="4.34">work with him they understand what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="6.57">doing is real and they need to watch out</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="5.47">so the next questions are pertinent to</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="3.66">what we just talked about where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.96" dur="5.49">saying why who has the power who has</text>
  <text start="492.06" dur="5.85">control if POTUS was not in control</text>
  <text start="495.45" dur="4.44">would they be were treating all of these</text>
  <text start="497.91" dur="3.96">questions relate to exactly what I was</text>
  <text start="499.89" dur="4.29">just saying if you think about them in</text>
  <text start="501.87" dur="6">context Trump went to these business</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="5.49">CEOs and said look for those of you who</text>
  <text start="507.87" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;re not going to allow you</text>
  <text start="509.67" dur="2.999">to fleece America anymore we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="511.38" dur="2.64">going to allow you to steal from the</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="2.761">American taxpayer anymore we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="514.02" dur="2.88">going to allow you to infiltrate</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="4.26">government through your lobbying</text>
  <text start="516.9" dur="6.09">lobbying campaigns in order to buy off</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="7.35">politicians that then can give you the</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="6.47">favor in corporate or legal battles or</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="5.85">whatever so that you may make more money</text>
  <text start="529.46" dur="5.1">whether it&amp;#39;s contracts or litigation or</text>
  <text start="532.89" dur="4.85">whatever it is</text>
  <text start="534.56" dur="5.04">so that&amp;#39;s exactly what Q is pointing to</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="4.409">there I think that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s ending and</text>
  <text start="539.6" dur="4.169">it&amp;#39;s good for people like us because</text>
  <text start="542.149" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re Patriots and we love our country</text>
  <text start="543.769" dur="3.81">and we obviously don&amp;#39;t want that to be</text>
  <text start="545.689" dur="4.59">the case especially behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="547.579" dur="4.44">where you have corporate America running</text>
  <text start="550.279" dur="3.66">the government that is not the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.019" dur="3.48">supposed to go it&amp;#39;s supposed to be we</text>
  <text start="553.939" dur="4.14">the people running the government not</text>
  <text start="555.499" dur="4.53">the corporation&amp;#39;s of this foreign</text>
  <text start="558.079" dur="4.38">country because as much as we love and</text>
  <text start="560.029" dur="4.381">respect our corporations and they can</text>
  <text start="562.459" dur="5.55">even be people if they want they should</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="5.099">not be in control of our government just</text>
  <text start="568.009" dur="5.31">because they have the majority of the</text>
  <text start="569.509" dur="6.361">cash okay so we&amp;#39;re gonna jump into the</text>
  <text start="573.319" dur="4.231">next set of posts here so who is the</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="4.199">Attorney General obviously Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="577.55" dur="4.86">who must approve the firing dismissal of</text>
  <text start="580.069" dur="4.62">DOJ officials obviously Jeff Sessions</text>

  <text start="594.23" dur="6.049">taking a look at so if we look at them</text>
  <text start="598.059" dur="9.7">let&amp;#39;s go ahead and take a look from the</text>

  <text start="607.759" dur="4.89">one and you guys know this one because</text>
  <text start="611.149" dur="4.471">we talked about in a previous episode</text>

  <text start="641.35" dur="9.7">then it&amp;#39;s talking about the DOJ where</text>
  <text start="644.389" dur="8.37">you have all the previous previous heads</text>
  <text start="651.05" dur="4.589">of the Department of Justice being</text>
  <text start="652.759" dur="8.221">removed the Loretta Lynch and Eric</text>
  <text start="655.639" dur="7.531">Holder and rod Rosenstein these people</text>
  <text start="660.98" dur="4.94">were removed because or are they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.17" dur="4.649">still there obviously I think it&amp;#39;s um</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="3.88">different who the number two is being</text>
  <text start="667.819" dur="4.411">referred to but anyway it&amp;#39;s saying plus</text>
  <text start="669.8" dur="5.25">18 it&amp;#39;s giving us an idea here of how</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="6.419">you obviously have a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="675.05" dur="6.659">are bad they are corrupt and they are</text>
  <text start="678.649" dur="5.011">involved at the top top highest levels</text>
  <text start="681.709" dur="5.341">of the FBI in the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="683.66" dur="5.909">then you go up here and you read talking</text>
  <text start="687.05" dur="5.519">about election fraud cases that are open</text>
  <text start="689.569" dur="4.531">right now this is very important okay</text>
  <text start="692.569" dur="2.611">now we&amp;#39;ll continue because we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="3.81">show you skip through this when I can</text>
  <text start="695.18" dur="4.259">read each other one of them then the</text>
  <text start="697.91" dur="3.09">next when talking about how the</text>
  <text start="699.439" dur="4.801">department justice is involved with the</text>
  <text start="701" dur="4.889">Awan investigation right this is all</text>
  <text start="704.24" dur="3.86">very important we have to take this all</text>
  <text start="705.889" dur="2.211">together</text>
  <text start="711.1" dur="5.08">Christopher Steele being investigated by</text>
  <text start="714.11" dur="4.74">the Department of Justice is very</text>
  <text start="716.18" dur="6.48">important as well and what Q is trying</text>
  <text start="718.85" dur="6.75">to pull together here is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="5.969">and this was a disturbing one where we</text>
  <text start="725.6" dur="5.729">expose this Rachel Chandler thing where</text>
  <text start="728.629" dur="5.281">she was obviously involved in some kind</text>
  <text start="731.329" dur="3.841">of very nefarious stuff thank you to</text>
  <text start="733.91" dur="3.479">each and every one of you Anton&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="735.17" dur="5.279">there and viewers and Watchers who</text>
  <text start="737.389" dur="5.221">called the FBI after this was posted I</text>
  <text start="740.449" dur="4.771">know we got contact to the FBI and that</text>
  <text start="742.61" dur="4.199">this is being remedied as we speak but</text>
  <text start="745.22" dur="4.76">this is like child human trafficking</text>
  <text start="746.809" dur="6.03">taking place in front of our eyes here</text>
  <text start="749.98" dur="6.789">thank God we&amp;#39;re here to to get rid of it</text>
  <text start="752.839" dur="6.36">but he was also talking about how the</text>
  <text start="756.769" dur="4.17">DOJ is involved with the fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="759.199" dur="4.471">thing and the witch hunt was Christopher</text>
  <text start="760.939" dur="8.33">Steele obviously so it just goes on and</text>
  <text start="763.67" dur="8.149">on so it takes you all the way up into</text>
  <text start="769.269" dur="4.87">here which is really important because</text>
  <text start="771.819" dur="4.031">they&amp;#39;re saying how they don&amp;#39;t get credit</text>
  <text start="774.139" dur="3.51">the artists you know they do a lot of</text>
  <text start="775.85" dur="6.51">work I mean some of these people are</text>
  <text start="777.649" dur="7.141">just like amazing and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="782.36" dur="4.68">frustrated there&amp;#39;s a lot of open arrests</text>
  <text start="784.79" dur="3.659">right but it&amp;#39;s very interesting to see</text>
  <text start="787.04" dur="5.969">how Q responds he&amp;#39;s talking about how</text>
  <text start="788.449" dur="6.601">the FBI and the DOJ are the two are two</text>
  <text start="793.009" dur="4.161">of the cornerstones of our justice</text>
  <text start="795.05" dur="4.11">system I mean the FBI is the the</text>
  <text start="797.17" dur="5.43">nation&amp;#39;s top</text>
  <text start="799.16" dur="6.989">criminal investigation a organization</text>
  <text start="802.6" dur="7.929">and then you have the DOJ which is the</text>
  <text start="806.149" dur="7.981">the top prosecutorial branch of the</text>
  <text start="810.529" dur="9.12">government in charge of the judiciary so</text>
  <text start="814.13" dur="9.74">I mean in order to make a system that</text>
  <text start="819.649" dur="6.481">does not fail and in order to prevent</text>
  <text start="823.87" dur="4.51">cases from getting thrown out of court</text>
  <text start="826.13" dur="4.199">because of corrupt officials you have to</text>
  <text start="828.38" dur="4.769">clean out the organization&amp;#39;s first and</text>
  <text start="830.329" dur="5.271">then prosecute individuals you can have</text>
  <text start="833.149" dur="5.641">an ongoing investigation but you need to</text>
  <text start="835.6" dur="5.32">weed out the Peter strokes and the Lesa</text>
  <text start="838.79" dur="6.68">Lesa pages these people who are</text>
  <text start="840.92" dur="7.83">obviously involved in partisan political</text>
  <text start="845.47" dur="5.919">sabotage I mean it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious to</text>
  <text start="848.75" dur="5.88">me it&amp;#39;s all alleged at this point but I</text>
  <text start="851.389" dur="5.041">mean let&amp;#39;s be honest who among us has</text>
  <text start="854.63" dur="6.509">not looked at the Peter stroke and Lisa</text>
  <text start="856.43" dur="7.08">page texts in in broad and said that are</text>
  <text start="861.139" dur="4.801">in brief and said there is obviously</text>
  <text start="863.51" dur="4.889">some sort of biased against the</text>
  <text start="865.94" dur="4.829">president united states here that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="868.399" dur="3.721">fairly obvious to me I&amp;#39;m just bringing</text>
  <text start="870.769" dur="3.801">this all to your attention because I</text>
  <text start="872.12" dur="4.969">think it&amp;#39;s very important to discuss so</text>
  <text start="874.57" dur="5.829">that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="877.089" dur="6.461">who is the FBI director that is James</text>
  <text start="880.399" dur="5.341">Comey who must approve the firing</text>
  <text start="883.55" dur="4.83">dismissal of FBI agents or not James</text>
  <text start="885.74" dur="7.2">Comey excuse me christopher ray sorry</text>
  <text start="888.38" dur="6.75">that was slip but who must approve it</text>
  <text start="892.94" dur="5.459">obviously christopher ray re-read the</text>
  <text start="895.13" dur="6.36">FBI organizational change pose well</text>
  <text start="898.399" dur="5.911">there&amp;#39;s a lot of FBI posters over I</text>
  <text start="901.49" dur="3.93">think around 40 posts and it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="904.31" dur="2.73">go through each and every one of them</text>
  <text start="905.42" dur="3.06">but I can tell you that the important</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="3.93">things to draw away are the same things</text>
  <text start="908.48" dur="4.14">that are being drawn from the DOJ posts</text>
  <text start="910.97" dur="3.239">because they all talk about the same</text>
  <text start="912.62" dur="3.48">thing they talk about corruption inside</text>
  <text start="914.209" dur="4.051">of our government and how if you have</text>
  <text start="916.1" dur="5.239">the top law enforcement agency in the</text>
  <text start="918.26" dur="5.37">country with the top judicial</text>
  <text start="921.339" dur="4.81">organization in the country being</text>
  <text start="923.63" dur="4.92">corrupted infiltrated by corrupting</text>
  <text start="926.149" dur="4.951">forces then you have to clean that up</text>
  <text start="928.55" dur="4.56">first because you can actually lose the</text>
  <text start="931.1" dur="5.429">integrity of law</text>
  <text start="933.11" dur="5.18">and like cues pointed out before there</text>
  <text start="936.529" dur="4.141">are so many people out there who could</text>
  <text start="938.29" dur="5.169">contest their conviction based on the</text>
  <text start="940.67" dur="4.95">fact that if you take a person like</text>
  <text start="943.459" dur="4.68">let&amp;#39;s say Peter struck who&amp;#39;s obviously a</text>
  <text start="945.62" dur="5.73">bad actor he&amp;#39;s evil</text>
  <text start="948.139" dur="6.601">he loves Hillary he was against Trump</text>
  <text start="951.35" dur="6.51">he&amp;#39;s a partisan player he&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="954.74" dur="5.639">being implicated in this as being an</text>
  <text start="957.86" dur="4.349">alleged conspirators against the</text>
  <text start="960.379" dur="3.81">president United States but I mean</text>
  <text start="962.209" dur="3.661">imagine the other cases he&amp;#39;s worked on</text>
  <text start="964.189" dur="3.421">what if he&amp;#39;s locked up pedophiles what</text>
  <text start="965.87" dur="4.199">if he&amp;#39;s locked up real criminals what if</text>
  <text start="967.61" dur="6.149">he&amp;#39;s done some actual patriotic stuff</text>
  <text start="970.069" dur="5.94">for our country you know and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="973.759" dur="4.861">mean to say that he&amp;#39;s a patriot</text>
  <text start="976.009" dur="4.801">given his alleged activities but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="978.62" dur="4.23">saying that what if he&amp;#39;s done some good</text>
  <text start="980.81" dur="4.259">things for our country and what if those</text>
  <text start="982.85" dur="5.25">good things could be overturned because</text>
  <text start="985.069" dur="6.26">of his implication and being a criminal</text>
  <text start="988.1" dur="5.01">in this one particular instance</text>
  <text start="991.329" dur="6.07">obviously these are all allegations</text>
  <text start="993.11" dur="7.019">these are not factually confirmed yet</text>
  <text start="997.399" dur="4.86">but I can tell you this that that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1000.129" dur="6.18">dilemma that we face here with the DOJ</text>
  <text start="1002.259" dur="6.031">and the FBI is that there&amp;#39;s even some of</text>
  <text start="1006.309" dur="3.78">these bad actors that we looked at look</text>
  <text start="1008.29" dur="4.07">at on a daily basis there is a</text>
  <text start="1010.089" dur="5.641">possibility that they were in they were</text>
  <text start="1012.36" dur="9.219">behind the conviction of some much worse</text>
  <text start="1015.73" dur="7.74">people and it could be said that those</text>
  <text start="1021.579" dur="4.441">previous convictions could be brought</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="4.14">into contention because of the fact that</text>
  <text start="1026.02" dur="3.24">somebody was exposed for being a</text>
  <text start="1027.61" dur="4.02">criminal such as when you talk about</text>
  <text start="1029.26" dur="5.73">Peter stroke what happened with general</text>
  <text start="1031.63" dur="7.079">Flynn and the 3:02 and the falsifying of</text>
  <text start="1034.99" dur="5.669">information allegedly so please</text>
  <text start="1038.709" dur="3.96">understand there&amp;#39;s so much more going on</text>
  <text start="1040.659" dur="4.741">here behind the scenes that we all have</text>
  <text start="1042.669" dur="6.091">to understand is quite important to</text>
  <text start="1045.4" dur="5.46">understanding the overall situation we</text>
  <text start="1048.76" dur="4.83">find ourselves in which is quite</text>
  <text start="1050.86" dur="6.33">precarious given the fact that we have</text>
  <text start="1053.59" dur="7.26">to uphold the standards that the United</text>
  <text start="1057.19" dur="7.13">States is known for globally we&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="1060.85" dur="3.47">third world country we&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="1065.27" dur="5.17">dictatorship we&amp;#39;re not anything other</text>
  <text start="1067.41" dur="4.91">than a republic that follows a certain</text>
  <text start="1070.44" dur="6.75">set of guidelines in order to</text>
  <text start="1072.32" dur="7.66">effectively make positive change in the</text>
  <text start="1077.19" dur="4.2">world so this could all undo some pretty</text>
  <text start="1079.98" dur="4.41">important things that we&amp;#39;ve already gone</text>
  <text start="1081.39" dur="6.24">over but we&amp;#39;re gonna jump back into what</text>
  <text start="1084.39" dur="5.25">Q saying here if sessions in rayar DC</text>
  <text start="1087.63" dur="3.57">swamp deep state why are they cleaning</text>
  <text start="1089.64" dur="5.37">their respective houses well obviously</text>
  <text start="1091.2" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re working on their own FBI and DOJ</text>
  <text start="1095.01" dur="7.799">in their own way which with Ray I think</text>
  <text start="1098.28" dur="6.69">is more overly about holding internal</text>
  <text start="1102.809" dur="4.981">investor or turning over investigations</text>
  <text start="1104.97" dur="6.27">to the inspector general as well as John</text>
  <text start="1107.79" dur="5.28">Huber and kind of staying out of it but</text>
  <text start="1111.24" dur="4.29">then running the FBI because criminals</text>
  <text start="1113.07" dur="4.38">are still acting against our country who</text>
  <text start="1115.53" dur="4.47">are not involved in politics who are</text>
  <text start="1117.45" dur="5.82">just criminals who need to be prosecuted</text>
  <text start="1120" dur="5.46">and investigated and found out now</text>
  <text start="1123.27" dur="4.649">sessions on the other hand is in charge</text>
  <text start="1125.46" dur="4.89">of the judges and the others who are in</text>
  <text start="1127.919" dur="7.201">charge of making and obtaining law</text>
  <text start="1130.35" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re upholding law in our country not</text>
  <text start="1135.12" dur="6.299">necessarily making it in some cases</text>
  <text start="1136.89" dur="7.68">establishing president so he&amp;#39;s actively</text>
  <text start="1141.419" dur="6.111">working with many different districts</text>

  <text start="1152.73" dur="5.189">law where it&amp;#39;s deemed necessary to</text>
  <text start="1155.34" dur="4.38">uphold especially when you have the</text>
  <text start="1157.919" dur="6.271">border issue in California which I</text>
  <text start="1159.72" dur="7.35">think&amp;#39;s on the radar so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1164.19" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re both independently doing and I</text>
  <text start="1167.07" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t think that they&amp;#39;re in the swamp or</text>
  <text start="1169.35" dur="5.069">the deep state I think that they&amp;#39;re my</text>
  <text start="1171.57" dur="5.489">personal opinion is that is and it could</text>
  <text start="1174.419" dur="5.431">be completely wrong it very well may be</text>
  <text start="1177.059" dur="6.321">but that it&amp;#39;s all Kabuki it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1179.85" dur="7.16">political theater and that this is all</text>
  <text start="1183.38" dur="6.13">misdirection to keep the Cabal off of</text>
  <text start="1187.01" dur="4.75">sessions and off of Ray because they</text>
  <text start="1189.51" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t need the media following them</text>
  <text start="1191.76" dur="4.03">hounding them</text>
  <text start="1192.93" dur="4.63">embellishing stories about them and so</text>
  <text start="1195.79" dur="5.06">on and so forth because it would hinder</text>
  <text start="1197.56" dur="7.62">their progress as far as investigatory</text>
  <text start="1200.85" dur="6.85">capacity goes so I really want to just</text>
  <text start="1205.18" dur="3.81">cover that in brief because it&amp;#39;s if that</text>
  <text start="1207.7" dur="3.57">is the case I don&amp;#39;t want to bring a</text>
  <text start="1208.99" dur="5.07">light to it as much as I just want to</text>
  <text start="1211.27" dur="4.86">share it with you guys here talking</text>
  <text start="1214.06" dur="3.93">about us using logic that&amp;#39;s my best</text>
  <text start="1216.13" dur="4.86">logic on this if you guys have better</text>
  <text start="1217.99" dur="5.76">Intel please let me know why are they</text>
  <text start="1220.99" dur="4.35">slow walking unredacted data why are</text>
  <text start="1223.75" dur="3.87">they still walking document disclosure</text>
  <text start="1225.34" dur="5.79">why is the White House backing up the</text>
  <text start="1227.62" dur="6.03">DOJ what if the same data is being used</text>
  <text start="1231.13" dur="6.6">by other investigations what does it</text>
  <text start="1233.65" dur="5.67">mean if a grand jury is impaneled well</text>
  <text start="1237.73" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s a lot here and that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1239.32" dur="4.2">interesting to think about so why are</text>
  <text start="1241.9" dur="5.25">they slow walking the unredacted</text>
  <text start="1243.52" dur="6.75">documents regarding the stroke and page</text>
  <text start="1247.15" dur="4.53">text why are they slow walking the</text>
  <text start="1250.27" dur="4.08">document disclosures that have been</text>
  <text start="1251.68" dur="6.27">subpoenaed by the Congress I think</text>
  <text start="1254.35" dur="7.02">that&amp;#39;s quite simple quite simply put</text>
  <text start="1257.95" dur="7.53">what they&amp;#39;re slow walking is documents</text>
  <text start="1261.37" dur="6.03">that will prove there&amp;#39;s investigations</text>
  <text start="1265.48" dur="4.71">going on behind the scenes and what do I</text>
  <text start="1267.4" dur="6.24">mean by that well let me explain the way</text>
  <text start="1270.19" dur="5.79">it would work is this because Devin</text>
  <text start="1273.64" dur="3.63">Nunez and others have subpoenaed for</text>
  <text start="1275.98" dur="4.17">information from the Department of</text>
  <text start="1277.27" dur="5.58">Justice they have to give that</text>
  <text start="1280.15" dur="4.5">information over but the only loophole</text>
  <text start="1282.85" dur="3.81">that would prevent them from having to</text>
  <text start="1284.65" dur="4.11">give that information over is if that</text>
  <text start="1286.66" dur="6.48">information was actually being used in</text>
  <text start="1288.76" dur="7.68">an ongoing investigation so what is</text>
  <text start="1293.14" dur="5.64">gonna come out in the next I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1296.44" dur="5.7">I would say a week week couple weeks</text>
  <text start="1298.78" dur="5.16">baby is going to be uncovering the fact</text>
  <text start="1302.14" dur="4.44">that there are active investigations</text>
  <text start="1303.94" dur="5.76">going on and that that information will</text>
  <text start="1306.58" dur="6.87">not be able to be disclosed yet because</text>
  <text start="1309.7" dur="5.68">it could negatively affect the</text>
  <text start="1313.45" dur="6.94">investigate the the</text>
  <text start="1315.38" dur="6.39">court proceedings so that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1320.39" dur="3.9">believe is going on behind the surface</text>
  <text start="1321.77" dur="5.94">and I are going on beneath the surface</text>
  <text start="1324.29" dur="5.64">and I think that you guys out there can</text>
  <text start="1327.71" dur="5.76">give me your opinion but when you read</text>
  <text start="1329.93" dur="5.82">these succinctly every day and you get a</text>
  <text start="1333.47" dur="4.32">good idea of it you get feeling you get</text>
  <text start="1335.75" dur="3.48">a feeling for what it actually means and</text>
  <text start="1337.79" dur="4.2">I think that&amp;#39;s exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1339.23" dur="5.25">referring to is the fact that Jeff</text>
  <text start="1341.99" dur="5.67">Sessions behind the scenes without</text>
  <text start="1344.48" dur="4.74">having any media scrutiny has been able</text>
  <text start="1347.66" dur="3.3">to put together like several</text>
  <text start="1349.22" dur="3.93">investigations into the Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1350.96" dur="4.86">servers from the Hillary Clinton servers</text>
  <text start="1353.15" dur="5.16">to pedophilia and Satanism and all that</text>
  <text start="1355.82" dur="6.87">the occult and everything in between</text>
  <text start="1358.31" dur="7.89">including this nexium sex cult cult and</text>
  <text start="1362.69" dur="7.74">so on that that is all being combined</text>
  <text start="1366.2" dur="5.97">into this larger investigation and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1370.43" dur="5.37">going to talk about how the Inspector</text>
  <text start="1372.17" dur="5.49">General and John Huber are actually one</text>
  <text start="1375.8" dur="4.76">in the same to a degree because they</text>
  <text start="1377.66" dur="6.3">have the same prosecutorial powers and</text>
  <text start="1380.56" dur="7.21">are the same investigative powers and</text>
  <text start="1383.96" dur="5.51">subpoena powers and all that so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1387.77" dur="5.31">gonna go ahead and see what happens but</text>
  <text start="1389.47" dur="6.19">he says what does it mean if a drink</text>
  <text start="1393.08" dur="5.52">grand jury is impaneled now when for</text>
  <text start="1395.66" dur="5.94">those of you don&amp;#39;t know briefly grand</text>
  <text start="1398.6" dur="5.43">jury is basically all it is is a thing</text>
  <text start="1401.6" dur="4.86">that we use here in our democracy in the</text>
  <text start="1404.03" dur="5.1">United States and our republic in order</text>
  <text start="1406.46" dur="5.31">to determine whether or not to bring</text>

  <text start="1411.77" dur="4.79">individuals in certain cases they can</text>
  <text start="1414.29" dur="6.14">have a special grand jury which is for</text>
  <text start="1416.56" dur="5.83">some kind of conspiratorial criminal</text>
  <text start="1420.43" dur="4.12">accusations or indictments that are</text>
  <text start="1422.39" dur="5.7">being brought against maybe mafia or</text>
  <text start="1424.55" dur="6.02">whoever but there&amp;#39;s basically a grand</text>

  <text start="1430.57" dur="5.47">serve at the behest of this state or the</text>

  <text start="1448.31" dur="3.54">not</text>
  <text start="1448.669" dur="7.89">have been involved in a crime that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1451.85" dur="7.11">simple meaning of grand jury jury being</text>
  <text start="1456.559" dur="4.381">impaneled but why is it important to</text>
  <text start="1458.96" dur="5.039">what we&amp;#39;re talking about here well quite</text>
  <text start="1460.94" dur="5.189">simply put you have grand juries that</text>
  <text start="1463.999" dur="6.211">could be being in panel behind the</text>
  <text start="1466.129" dur="7.62">scenes to indict certain individuals who</text>
  <text start="1470.21" dur="5.789">are involved with very very bad things</text>
  <text start="1473.749" dur="5.4">such as the uranium one deal such as</text>
  <text start="1475.999" dur="8.4">other nefarious Awan brother activities</text>
  <text start="1479.149" dur="7.62">in the DNC server investigation so rest</text>
  <text start="1484.399" dur="4.23">assured that things can be going on</text>
  <text start="1486.769" dur="3.211">behind the scenes that can&amp;#39;t become</text>
  <text start="1488.629" dur="5.461">public because then they would affect</text>
  <text start="1489.98" dur="5.789">the investigation so understand that</text>
  <text start="1494.09" dur="3.299">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot more to this and</text>
  <text start="1495.769" dur="4.051">there&amp;#39;s a lot more that may be going on</text>
  <text start="1497.389" dur="5.73">beneath the surface that we may not</text>
  <text start="1499.82" dur="8.28">actually be able to see right now next</text>
  <text start="1503.119" dur="7.65">post is saying why are confusing</text>
  <text start="1508.1" dur="5.429">questions asked as to outcome regarding</text>
  <text start="1510.769" dur="6.421">Mueller what would be the purpose of</text>
  <text start="1513.529" dur="5.431">creating confusion well and okay so</text>
  <text start="1517.19" dur="8.179">these two questions kind of go right</text>
  <text start="1518.96" dur="9.419">into each other&amp;#39;s lap here you have why</text>
  <text start="1525.369" dur="6.19">would confusing questions be asked about</text>
  <text start="1528.379" dur="6.961">Mueller well what confusing questions is</text>
  <text start="1531.559" dur="6.45">key referring to well there&amp;#39;s this and</text>
  <text start="1535.34" dur="6.809">basically there&amp;#39;s a debate going on</text>
  <text start="1538.009" dur="7.74">behind the scenes where nobody&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1542.149" dur="6.331">sure where Mueller&amp;#39;s loyalties lie but</text>
  <text start="1545.749" dur="5.67">everyone&amp;#39;s very sure that he&amp;#39;s gone on a</text>
  <text start="1548.48" dur="5.399">fishing expedition and that this and</text>
  <text start="1551.419" dur="7.13">what a fishing expedition is is that the</text>
  <text start="1553.879" dur="4.67">original out the original outlying</text>
  <text start="1558.73" dur="6.699">purview for the Special Counsel was for</text>
  <text start="1562.34" dur="5.159">him to investigate the connection</text>
  <text start="1565.429" dur="3.84">between Russia and Trump and the</text>
  <text start="1567.499" dur="4.86">election and was there was there not</text>
  <text start="1569.269" dur="7.1">collusion now it&amp;#39;s evolved into raiding</text>
  <text start="1572.359" dur="8.7">Michael Cohen and his families apart are</text>

  <text start="1588.46" dur="8.76">regarding a payment to a porn star who</text>
  <text start="1592.42" dur="7.71">is categorically proven to be a liar and</text>
  <text start="1597.22" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;ll say this openly I yet to have</text>
  <text start="1600.13" dur="3.38">anybody call me on it she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1601.33" dur="4.71">categorically stormy Daniels is</text>
  <text start="1603.51" dur="5.5">categorically the definition of a liar</text>
  <text start="1606.04" dur="5.79">and in my opinion is starting to look</text>
  <text start="1609.01" dur="7.56">more and more like an extortionist every</text>
  <text start="1611.83" dur="7.05">day so that aside and if you want proof</text>
  <text start="1616.57" dur="4.23">of how she&amp;#39;s liar she&amp;#39;s made written</text>
  <text start="1618.88" dur="4.02">statements saying that she never had</text>
  <text start="1620.8" dur="4.02">sexual relations with the president and</text>
  <text start="1622.9" dur="5.31">now she&amp;#39;s coming out and saying she did</text>
  <text start="1624.82" dur="6.02">and she&amp;#39;s using it as a means to extort</text>
  <text start="1628.21" dur="6.24">money from the president so obviously</text>
  <text start="1630.84" dur="7.42">that is the categorical definition of a</text>
  <text start="1634.45" dur="6.5">liar and it&amp;#39;s looking more and more like</text>
  <text start="1638.26" dur="7.32">she could possibly be Amex tortion</text>
  <text start="1640.95" dur="8.44">esteem ball attorney day every day and</text>
  <text start="1645.58" dur="5.4">so that is what&amp;#39;s going on with the the</text>
  <text start="1649.39" dur="3.78">Moller investigation everybody&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1650.98" dur="3.6">why is this gone off the rails why is it</text>
  <text start="1653.17" dur="3.63">going into the stormy day most thing and</text>
  <text start="1654.58" dur="4.32">nobody&amp;#39;s given a good explanation so I</text>
  <text start="1656.8" dur="4.02">think it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious that Mueller</text>
  <text start="1658.9" dur="4.38">is compromised and that rot Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="1660.82" dur="6.27">is compromised and we will have to see</text>
  <text start="1663.28" dur="5.66">how that goes but the next questions are</text>
  <text start="1667.09" dur="4.92">important to that what was sessions</text>
  <text start="1668.94" dur="4.81">sessions a Senate confirmation vote what</text>
  <text start="1672.01" dur="4.14">was Rosenstein swell that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="1673.75" dur="4.47">question so here you see that Jeff</text>
  <text start="1676.15" dur="4.14">Sessions had a very close vote in the</text>
  <text start="1678.22" dur="4.65">Senate for his confirmation as Attorney</text>
  <text start="1680.29" dur="7.139">General and this would be expected you</text>
  <text start="1682.87" dur="6.6">know 52 to 47 he barely made the mark to</text>
  <text start="1687.429" dur="4.231">become the Attorney General of the</text>
  <text start="1689.47" dur="4.14">United States so that tells you that</text>
  <text start="1691.66" dur="4.05">there is 47 members of the United States</text>
  <text start="1693.61" dur="4.62">Senate who do not like Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="1695.71" dur="4.74">because probably in my opinion he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1698.23" dur="4.68">going to prosecute each and every one of</text>
  <text start="1700.45" dur="7.31">the criminals in Congress and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1702.91" dur="7.14">too afraid or compromised to actually</text>
  <text start="1707.76" dur="3.909">effectively want to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="1710.05" dur="4.95">they just want to keep the status quo</text>
  <text start="1711.669" dur="5.621">because they&amp;#39;re locked in as actual</text>
  <text start="1715" dur="5.26">hostages I guess you would say a lot of</text>
  <text start="1717.29" dur="6.6">these senators are just being beholden</text>
  <text start="1720.26" dur="5.79">to the the lobbying groups but here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1723.89" dur="5.67">Rosenstein numbers well look he had</text>
  <text start="1726.05" dur="5.94">ninety four to six that was his</text>
  <text start="1729.56" dur="4.26">confirmation so a little bit different</text>
  <text start="1731.99" dur="3.71">than Jeff Sessions which it kind of</text>
  <text start="1733.82" dur="4.83">gives a little bit of credence to what</text>
  <text start="1735.7" dur="6.01">cue saying when he says trust sessions</text>
  <text start="1738.65" dur="4.62">but that&amp;#39;s just my opinion</text>
  <text start="1741.71" dur="4.68">you guys will let me know what you think</text>
  <text start="1743.27" dur="3.54">in the comments but after what Q says</text>
  <text start="1746.39" dur="2.22">there</text>
  <text start="1746.81" dur="3.78">he says if Ron Rose are seen as dirty</text>
  <text start="1748.61" dur="3.84">Muller must also be dirty</text>
  <text start="1750.59" dur="3.3">if Mueller&amp;#39;s dirty brought roses team</text>
  <text start="1752.45" dur="4.59">must also be dirty that&amp;#39;s kind of one of</text>
  <text start="1753.89" dur="6.42">those if one is the other than the the</text>
  <text start="1757.04" dur="3.57">other is one type scenarios so here you</text>
  <text start="1760.31" dur="1.83">go</text>
  <text start="1760.61" dur="4.02">you obviously have cue telling us</text>
  <text start="1762.14" dur="4.17">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on the question</text>
  <text start="1764.63" dur="7.14">then becomes what is the common</text>
  <text start="1766.31" dur="9.06">denominator and the common denominator</text>
  <text start="1771.77" dur="7.29">in my opinion is the DNC it&amp;#39;s Hillary</text>
  <text start="1775.37" dur="9.47">Clinton it&amp;#39;s the the fact that Mueller</text>
  <text start="1779.06" dur="5.78">is has been known to be a complete a</text>
  <text start="1786.16" dur="6.79">completely compromised individual ever</text>
  <text start="1789.29" dur="7.59">since his early goings at the FBI and in</text>
  <text start="1792.95" dur="6.99">my opinion allegedly that&amp;#39;s true but and</text>
  <text start="1796.88" dur="5.13">also rod Rosen scene is obviously in the</text>
  <text start="1799.94" dur="4.16">same boat as Mueller and that they are</text>
  <text start="1802.01" dur="6.48">both two birds of the same feather</text>
  <text start="1804.1" dur="7.68">beholden to the same cabal that is the</text>
  <text start="1808.49" dur="7.29">deep state globalists and the DNC</text>
  <text start="1811.78" dur="6.88">radicals if you will so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1815.78" dur="5.82">fascinating to me and that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="1818.66" dur="5.25">common denominator in my opinion now it</text>
  <text start="1821.6" dur="5.4">says why did sessions pick rod Rose the</text>
  <text start="1823.91" dur="4.86">scene and then he says everyone has an</text>
  <text start="1827" dur="4.41">opinion if you have the facts few know</text>
  <text start="1828.77" dur="5.07">the plan midterms save and push I</text>
  <text start="1831.41" dur="6.39">actually think that this was some clever</text>
  <text start="1833.84" dur="6.02">long game stuff here on cues part and</text>
  <text start="1837.8" dur="6.99">I&amp;#39;ll explain exactly what I mean by that</text>
  <text start="1839.86" dur="7.2">what I mean by that is that did sessions</text>
  <text start="1844.79" dur="5.21">pick rod Rosen seem to expose</text>
  <text start="1847.06" dur="5.85">the corruption I mean think about it as</text>
  <text start="1850" dur="4.65">many people get on the boards here and</text>
  <text start="1852.91" dur="3.51">are very upset about the fact that rod</text>
  <text start="1854.65" dur="5.37">Rosenstein was even selected to have</text>
  <text start="1856.42" dur="5.4">this position what if the game was a</text>
  <text start="1860.02" dur="4.26">little longer than you thought what if</text>
  <text start="1861.82" dur="4.11">the game was a little more complex than</text>
  <text start="1864.28" dur="2.85">you thought what if the 40 chess was</text>
  <text start="1865.93" dur="3.9">something you couldn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1867.13" dur="4.44">necessarily none of us</text>
  <text start="1869.83" dur="5.07">I mean I&amp;#39;m including myself could have</text>
  <text start="1871.57" dur="6.6">had the foresight to see and what would</text>
  <text start="1874.9" dur="5.76">that 40 chess consist of well quite</text>
  <text start="1878.17" dur="6.6">simply put if you think about it let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1880.66" dur="9.54">say rod Rosenstein was corrupt and jeff</text>
  <text start="1884.77" dur="7.68">sessions found out and he it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1890.2" dur="4.89">principle of you you give a person</text>
  <text start="1892.45" dur="4.56">enough rope you know what I mean and</text>
  <text start="1895.09" dur="3.69">they may end up giving enough rope to</text>
  <text start="1897.01" dur="3.18">hang themselves basically you keep</text>
  <text start="1898.78" dur="5.19">giving them as much rope so they want</text>
  <text start="1900.19" dur="6.33">and it&amp;#39;s not like he did it purposely</text>
  <text start="1903.97" dur="5.52">because rod Rosenstein was representing</text>
  <text start="1906.52" dur="5.7">himself as a good actor obviously not a</text>
  <text start="1909.49" dur="5.16">lot of proof of than circumstantial</text>
  <text start="1912.22" dur="5.7">stuff to suggest that he may not be a</text>
  <text start="1914.65" dur="7.53">good actor but it all come out in the</text>
  <text start="1917.92" dur="8.46">wash as to how and who he is in</text>
  <text start="1922.18" dur="5.66">character and indeed but this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1926.38" dur="3.96">what we&amp;#39;re talking about here is that</text>
  <text start="1927.84" dur="4.15">there could be stuff going on beneath</text>
  <text start="1930.34" dur="3.06">the surface that we don&amp;#39;t know it says</text>
  <text start="1931.99" dur="3.63">if you have the facts for you know the</text>
  <text start="1933.4" dur="3.81">plan this could all been a part of the</text>
  <text start="1935.62" dur="2.91">plan and it could be something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1937.21" dur="4.02">going to be exposed to you before the</text>
  <text start="1938.53" dur="5.37">midterm midterms in order to get that</text>
  <text start="1941.23" dur="3.81">pushback going red because right now</text>
  <text start="1943.9" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re talking about the blue wave</text>
  <text start="1945.04" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s coming and it&amp;#39;s looking less and</text>
  <text start="1947.71" dur="4.98">less like a blue wave and more like a</text>

  <text start="2011.55" dur="4.23">be nice but that&amp;#39;s just a thought we</text>
  <text start="2013.92" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t know yet exactly what that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2015.78" dur="5.58">to show only time will tell but they do</text>

  <text start="2021.36" dur="7.41">afraid to do whatever they have to do so</text>
  <text start="2026.76" dur="4.38">it says why must the DOJ and the FBI be</text>
  <text start="2028.77" dur="4.74">cleaned first what is the DOJ response</text>
  <text start="2031.14" dur="5.31">before was the FBI responsible for wide</text>
  <text start="2033.51" dur="5.76">hrc you get a free pass used logic so</text>
  <text start="2036.45" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;ve talked about this the the DOJ and</text>
  <text start="2039.27" dur="3.48">the FBI you have the top law enforcement</text>
  <text start="2040.98" dur="7.41">agency in the country and then you have</text>
  <text start="2042.75" dur="6.78">the top your judicial organization in</text>
  <text start="2048.39" dur="5.25">the country</text>
  <text start="2049.53" dur="6.45">if you corrupt those then you corrupt</text>
  <text start="2053.64" dur="4.5">the whole system and you leave it liable</text>
  <text start="2055.98" dur="6.26">to such things as criminals being able</text>
  <text start="2058.14" dur="6.87">to appeal their convictions and that is</text>
  <text start="2062.24" dur="4.57">terrifying for a lot of people who have</text>
  <text start="2065.01" dur="3.69">been on the other end of that where</text>
  <text start="2066.81" dur="5.28">there have been victims and there if</text>
  <text start="2068.7" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;re a victim of a criminal especially</text>
  <text start="2072.09" dur="5.13">once picked up by the FBI let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="2073.68" dur="6">human trafficker and then it comes out</text>
  <text start="2077.22" dur="4.83">later that that person has a lawyer who</text>
  <text start="2079.68" dur="5.73">who finds out that Rosenstein let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="2082.05" dur="5.01">for instance is dirty and corrupt and</text>
  <text start="2085.41" dur="3.66">then they go back to well Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="2087.06" dur="3.8">prosecuting my case and now all of a</text>
  <text start="2089.07" dur="5.49">sudden that person is going to get off</text>
  <text start="2090.86" dur="7.84">get out of jail because they have been</text>
  <text start="2094.56" dur="8.46">cleared on or they have been a acquitted</text>
  <text start="2098.7" dur="7.83">on a technicality right that&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="2103.02" dur="5.4">need to be quite aware of now why did</text>
  <text start="2106.53" dur="5.37">HRC get a free pass well it&amp;#39;s fairly</text>
  <text start="2108.42" dur="6.15">obvious she has dirt on everyone and</text>
  <text start="2111.9" dur="5.13">he was looked at as the logical person</text>
  <text start="2114.57" dur="4.11">to become the next president now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2117.03" dur="3.54">an interesting one that I want your help</text>
  <text start="2118.68" dur="3.87">on I really appreciate it when you guys</text>
  <text start="2120.57" dur="3.03">help me out here I&amp;#39;ve actually tried to</text>
  <text start="2122.55" dur="5.75">figure out what it means when it says</text>
  <text start="2123.6" dur="8.88">define single shooter now Huber is</text>
  <text start="2128.3" dur="8.32">obviously the person who goes by the</text>
  <text start="2132.48" dur="12">name of John Huber now who is John Huber</text>
  <text start="2136.62" dur="13.65">well let&amp;#39;s just take a look pull up that</text>
  <text start="2144.48" dur="8.37">right now so John Huber is the one who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2150.27" dur="5.22">gonna F or the the one who is involved</text>
  <text start="2152.85" dur="4.86">in investigating the FBI but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2155.49" dur="4.26">basically a special counsel on this this</text>
  <text start="2157.71" dur="4.38">article kind of lays it out he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2159.75" dur="5.31">basically a special counsel in every way</text>
  <text start="2162.09" dur="6.27">but named he&amp;#39;s able to impanel grand</text>
  <text start="2165.06" dur="5.34">juries he&amp;#39;s able to bring criminal</text>
  <text start="2168.36" dur="5.28">indictments if the grand juries say so</text>
  <text start="2170.4" dur="4.98">so his investigation is actually almost</text>
  <text start="2173.64" dur="3.51">as important as what&amp;#39;s going on with the</text>
  <text start="2175.38" dur="3.24">inspector general and I think his</text>
  <text start="2177.15" dur="4.35">investigation is more to do with the</text>
  <text start="2178.62" dur="5.84">stuff that everyone here on the q boards</text>
  <text start="2181.5" dur="5.07">is frantically waiting to hear about</text>
  <text start="2184.46" dur="4.33">because you have this entire</text>
  <text start="2186.57" dur="4.77">investigation going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="2188.79" dur="4.23">that we can&amp;#39;t know about about all of</text>
  <text start="2191.34" dur="3.21">this corruption criminality that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2193.02" dur="2.85">pointing out on a daily basis that</text>
  <text start="2194.55" dur="5.94">nobody&amp;#39;s picking up in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="2195.87" dur="6.51">media so my hope is that Huber is one of</text>
  <text start="2200.49" dur="5.58">the good actors who&amp;#39;s working behind the</text>
  <text start="2202.38" dur="7.01">scenes in order to effectively become</text>
  <text start="2206.07" dur="6.38">the new Inspector General through his</text>
  <text start="2209.39" dur="6.27">basic appointment to Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="2212.45" dur="6.94">without actually being a special counsel</text>
  <text start="2215.66" dur="5.35">now it&amp;#39;s saying when does session step</text>
  <text start="2219.39" dur="3.66">back in it already is well maybe</text>
  <text start="2221.01" dur="6.38">sessions is working with Huber behind</text>
  <text start="2223.05" dur="4.34">the scenes as part of the bigger broader</text>
  <text start="2227.54" dur="5.35">undercover investigations going on you</text>
  <text start="2230.37" dur="3.83">know beneath the surface that would be</text>
  <text start="2232.89" dur="4.44">very interesting</text>
  <text start="2234.2" dur="6.1">why did sessions secretly engage Huber</text>
  <text start="2237.33" dur="5.7">why did sessions reveal Huber timing is</text>
  <text start="2240.3" dur="4.92">everything well I&amp;#39;m not sure on the</text>
  <text start="2243.03" dur="4.65">timing of revealing Huber but I know</text>
  <text start="2245.22" dur="5.66">that he engaged him in order to do</text>
  <text start="2247.68" dur="9.45">exactly what we&amp;#39;re talking about here so</text>
  <text start="2250.88" dur="7.87">next thing says Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="2257.13" dur="5.01">does not discuss ongoing investigations</text>
  <text start="2258.75" dur="5.01">or confirm specific matters what about</text>
  <text start="2262.14" dur="4.41">the active investigation into leaks</text>
  <text start="2263.76" dur="5.58">Horowitz and this is a quote Horowitz /</text>
  <text start="2266.55" dur="6">sees a nationwide workforce of more than</text>
  <text start="2269.34" dur="5.25">450 special agents auditors inspectors</text>
  <text start="2272.55" dur="3.809">attorneys and support staff whose</text>
  <text start="2274.59" dur="4.56">mission is to detect and deter waste</text>
  <text start="2276.359" dur="5.191">fraud abuse and misconduct in the DOJ</text>
  <text start="2279.15" dur="5.64">programs and personnel to promote and</text>
  <text start="2281.55" dur="6.42">and to promote economy and efficiency in</text>
  <text start="2284.79" dur="5.85">department operations on end quote this</text>
  <text start="2287.97" dur="4.32">is Horowitz who is the inspector general</text>
  <text start="2290.64" dur="3.63">who has put out his report who is</text>
  <text start="2292.29" dur="4.38">investigating things like Lisa Paige and</text>
  <text start="2294.27" dur="4.11">Peter stroke and their text messages and</text>
  <text start="2296.67" dur="3.57">other things that are obviously</text>
  <text start="2298.38" dur="4.41">corruption and obviously need</text>
  <text start="2300.24" dur="4.74">investigating I think we should trust</text>
  <text start="2302.79" dur="4.5">Horowitz for that for now especially if</text>
  <text start="2304.98" dur="6.09">he&amp;#39;s working with sessions and Hueber in</text>
  <text start="2307.29" dur="6.059">order to put together this brilliant for</text>
  <text start="2311.07" dur="4.32">DHS in my opinion but what this is</text>
  <text start="2313.349" dur="4.471">saying here it&amp;#39;s pointing to the fact</text>
  <text start="2315.39" dur="4.26">that the leaks that have been going on</text>
  <text start="2317.82" dur="3.72">are being investigated I mean think</text>
  <text start="2319.65" dur="3.689">about it all the way back to when Trump</text>
  <text start="2321.54" dur="4.53">first got in office and we were leaking</text>
  <text start="2323.339" dur="5.451">out his private phone calls between him</text>
  <text start="2326.07" dur="6.779">and the heads of state of other of other</text>
  <text start="2328.79" dur="5.11">countries so this has been going on for</text>
  <text start="2332.849" dur="3.711">a while right now and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2333.9" dur="5.49">expanded out until like things like</text>
  <text start="2336.56" dur="5.41">Hillary Clinton Foundation uranium one</text>
  <text start="2339.39" dur="6.19">the pedophilia the globalists the</text>
  <text start="2341.97" dur="5.33">Luciferian Satanists I&amp;#39;m really really</text>
  <text start="2345.58" dur="4.46">[Music]</text>
  <text start="2347.3" dur="3.87">hopeful that that is what is going on</text>
  <text start="2350.04" dur="4.68">behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="2351.17" dur="5.53">now the next one says why did Mike</text>
  <text start="2354.72" dur="3.6">Pompeo step into the CIA prior to</text>
  <text start="2356.7" dur="4.62">Secretary of State they are deeply</text>
  <text start="2358.32" dur="4.74">connected think offshore military</text>
  <text start="2361.32" dur="4.17">intelligence providing support during</text>
  <text start="2363.06" dur="3.9">this time this is all talking about</text>
  <text start="2365.49" dur="2.91">stuff that we&amp;#39;ve covered before but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2366.96" dur="4.95">very important to understand that Mike</text>
  <text start="2368.4" dur="5.699">Pompeo is obviously a good actor he went</text>
  <text start="2371.91" dur="3.66">to the CIA because the CIA had had</text>
  <text start="2374.099" dur="4.651">hijacked the State Department they had</text>
  <text start="2375.57" dur="3.81">hijacked our global relations you have</text>
  <text start="2378.75" dur="2.519">to understand</text>
  <text start="2379.38" dur="3.78">when you look at what the State</text>
  <text start="2381.269" dur="4.231">Department is responsible for and what</text>
  <text start="2383.16" dur="7.5">the CIA are responsible for they almost</text>
  <text start="2385.5" dur="7.259">have it conflicting interests because</text>
  <text start="2390.66" dur="7.04">the State Department is supposed to work</text>
  <text start="2392.759" dur="8.431">in the light under oversight fair and</text>
  <text start="2397.7" dur="5.97">reasonable oversight of the Congress and</text>
  <text start="2401.19" dur="5.159">the American people in order to make</text>
  <text start="2403.67" dur="5.649">diplomatic moves on behalf of the</text>
  <text start="2406.349" dur="5.52">country as a whole whereas you have the</text>
  <text start="2409.319" dur="4.921">CIA it&amp;#39;s that works in the night under</text>
  <text start="2411.869" dur="6.361">the cover of darkness without any in</text>
  <text start="2414.24" dur="7.609">some cases judicial or congressional</text>
  <text start="2418.23" dur="5.97">oversight in order to enact policy</text>
  <text start="2421.849" dur="4.45">globally on behalf of the United States</text>
  <text start="2424.2" dur="3.48">so there&amp;#39;s obviously a conflict of</text>
  <text start="2426.299" dur="5.46">interest when you put those two together</text>
  <text start="2427.68" dur="6.899">and it&amp;#39;s time that the oversight wins</text>
  <text start="2431.759" dur="4.53">that the light wins that it can&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="2434.579" dur="5.841">behind the scenes in darkness because</text>
  <text start="2436.289" dur="8.101">that only breeds corruption it breeds</text>
  <text start="2440.42" dur="6.669">terrible terrible people who obviously</text>
  <text start="2444.39" dur="5.04">have stepped in and taken power now and</text>
  <text start="2447.089" dur="3.99">are deeply connected to pretty awful</text>
  <text start="2449.43" dur="3.359">stuff that we&amp;#39;re gonna expose here in</text>
  <text start="2451.079" dur="7.801">the future but you guys all have to stay</text>
  <text start="2452.789" dur="7.651">tuned for that now it says and we think</text>
  <text start="2458.88" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m just finisher</text>
  <text start="2460.44" dur="6.109">you think offshore well I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="2462.45" dur="6.72">offshore means other countries other</text>
  <text start="2466.549" dur="5.32">shell companies that the CIA has where</text>
  <text start="2469.17" dur="5.57">they keep money ways of them storing</text>
  <text start="2471.869" dur="5.101">money outside the United States that</text>
  <text start="2474.74" dur="5.26">billions if not trillions they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2476.97" dur="4.589">siphoned off of the taxpayers in order</text>
  <text start="2480" dur="4.2">to keep their secret government going</text>
  <text start="2481.559" dur="6">behind the scenes that&amp;#39;s definitely what</text>
  <text start="2484.2" dur="5.099">I think they&amp;#39;re referring to but</text>
  <text start="2487.559" dur="3.54">military intelligence is helping out</text>
  <text start="2489.299" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re going to put a stop to it we</text>
  <text start="2491.099" dur="2.49">have a lot of great people working</text>
  <text start="2492.089" dur="4.801">behind the scenes so we have to put our</text>
  <text start="2493.589" dur="5.161">trust in them now the Select it says</text>
  <text start="2496.89" dur="3.3">wire select executive orders</text>
  <text start="2498.75" dur="5.039">aggressively being written and put in</text>
  <text start="2500.19" dur="5.819">the law obviously there is so much going</text>
  <text start="2503.789" dur="3.81">on behind the scenes that it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2506.009" dur="3.691">really important to understand that</text>
  <text start="2507.599" dur="4.23">Donald Trump has been signing and</text>
  <text start="2509.7" dur="2.86">putting into law many executive orders</text>
  <text start="2511.829" dur="2.711">they&amp;#39;ve been dealing with</text>
  <text start="2512.56" dur="4.44">human trafficking and the funds</text>
  <text start="2514.54" dur="4.32">preceding that and other things that are</text>
  <text start="2517" dur="6.09">involved with criminal activity on a</text>
  <text start="2518.86" dur="4.89">global scale that will allow the army to</text>
  <text start="2523.09" dur="4.02">get involved</text>
  <text start="2523.75" dur="7.47">it allows a establishment of a state of</text>
  <text start="2527.11" dur="7.22">emergency it allows the enactment of</text>
  <text start="2531.22" dur="5.78">special executive privilege powers</text>
  <text start="2534.33" dur="5.29">special executive powers I should say</text>
  <text start="2537" dur="5.32">that allow Donald Trump to X</text>
  <text start="2539.62" dur="4.95">traditionally make decisions that he</text>
  <text start="2542.32" dur="6.21">otherwise would not be able to make in a</text>
  <text start="2544.57" dur="5.25">state of peace or non emergency so these</text>
  <text start="2548.53" dur="2.91">are things that are very important to</text>
  <text start="2549.82" dur="3.93">understand that are going on behind the</text>
  <text start="2551.44" dur="5.85">scenes now next one I think it&amp;#39;s a state</text>
  <text start="2553.75" dur="6.09">slash CIA next but I think what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2557.29" dur="5.43">saying here is that the CIA&amp;#39;s somehow</text>
  <text start="2559.84" dur="5.46">intrinsically connected to California</text>
  <text start="2562.72" dur="5.91">and it&amp;#39;s saying that state of California</text>
  <text start="2565.3" dur="4.17">is next so that&amp;#39;s my take on it if you</text>
  <text start="2568.63" dur="2.19">guys have a different interpretation</text>
  <text start="2569.47" dur="5.13">please let me know what you think in the</text>
  <text start="2570.82" dur="7.32">comments but it says think logically no</text>
  <text start="2574.6" dur="5.37">outside comes just askew so we all need</text>
  <text start="2578.14" dur="3.75">to think logically and there is no</text>

  <text start="2965.88" dur="8.37">absolutely care about immensely and the</text>
  <text start="2971.58" dur="5.61">best advice I give them is to follow God</text>

  <text start="2985.77" dur="6.15">seek God&amp;#39;s guidance and trust in our</text>
  <text start="2989.25" dur="5.04">Lord Jesus so we&amp;#39;re gonna read first</text>
  <text start="2991.92" dur="6.27">John chapter 5 verses 1 through 6 and</text>
  <text start="2994.29" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s very telling about God&amp;#39;s love and I</text>
  <text start="2998.19" dur="2.97">hope this resonates for some of those</text>
  <text start="2999.57" dur="3.69">out there who are struggling with things</text>
  <text start="3001.16" dur="5.34">very similar to what I&amp;#39;ve described just</text>
  <text start="3003.26" dur="5.1">previously but it says everyone who</text>
  <text start="3006.5" dur="4.02">believes that Jesus is the Christ has</text>
  <text start="3008.36" dur="5.34">been born of God and everyone who loves</text>
  <text start="3010.52" dur="6">the parent loves the child by this we</text>
  <text start="3013.7" dur="4.77">know that we love the children of God</text>
  <text start="3016.52" dur="5.67">when we love God and obey His</text>
  <text start="3018.47" dur="7.65">commandments for love of God is this</text>
  <text start="3022.19" dur="5.58">that we obey his Commandments and His</text>
  <text start="3026.12" dur="3.93">commandments are not burdensome for</text>
  <text start="3027.77" dur="5.43">whatever is born of God conquers the</text>
  <text start="3030.05" dur="6.69">world and this is the victory that</text>
  <text start="3033.2" dur="5.55">conquers the world our faith who is it</text>
  <text start="3036.74" dur="3.83">that conquers the world but the one who</text>
  <text start="3038.75" dur="4.82">believes that Jesus is the Son</text>
  <text start="3040.57" dur="5.1">god this is the one who came by water</text>
  <text start="3043.57" dur="4.71">and blood Jesus Christ not with the</text>
  <text start="3045.67" dur="6.06">water only but with the water and the</text>
  <text start="3048.28" dur="7.25">blood and the Spirit is the one that</text>
  <text start="3051.73" dur="9.78">testifies for the Spirit is the truth</text>
  <text start="3055.53" dur="9.4">and that speaks volumes God&amp;#39;s love is</text>
  <text start="3061.51" dur="4.89">overwhelming and God&amp;#39;s love is</text>
  <text start="3064.93" dur="5.13">everything that we should seek on a</text>
  <text start="3066.4" dur="5.43">daily basis but we have to obey His</text>
  <text start="3070.06" dur="2.76">commandments and we have to understand</text>
  <text start="3071.83" dur="5.16">that His commandments are not burdensome</text>
  <text start="3072.82" dur="9.54">they&amp;#39;re gonna be to our benefit and if</text>
  <text start="3076.99" dur="8.01">we follow him and our faith is true he</text>
  <text start="3082.36" dur="8.43">points out that we will be the ones that</text>
  <text start="3085" dur="8.4">will conquer the world we will be the</text>
  <text start="3090.79" dur="7.47">ones who believe that Jesus is the Son</text>
