  <text start="381.979" dur="3.99">sharing this on our social media we need</text>
  <text start="383.81" dur="4.05">to be making memes doing all the stuff q</text>

  <text start="387.86" dur="5.489">like what Q says here is so true nothing</text>
  <text start="390.469" dur="4.891">can stop what is coming if if in fact</text>
  <text start="393.349" dur="4.081">all this impropriety took place then we</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="4.14">are banking on the fact that John Huber</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="4.08">at Michael Horowitz the Inspector</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="3.42">General and the US Attorney John Huber</text>
  <text start="401.51" dur="3.03">been working behind the scenes to get</text>
  <text start="402.92" dur="4.35">these investigations going they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="404.54" dur="4.23">uncover this these improprieties and</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re gonna at least give us an</text>
  <text start="408.77" dur="5.37">insight into what they&amp;#39;ve uncovered so</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="5.64">far and you know like that article also</text>
  <text start="414.14" dur="3.81">said well actually not that one it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.75" dur="2.25">another one that we&amp;#39;re gonna get into a</text>
  <text start="417.95" dur="4.59">little later so I don&amp;#39;t wanna get too</text>
  <text start="419" dur="6.36">ahead of myself but look Q is saying</text>
  <text start="422.54" dur="4.8">what we all know electing Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="5.21">wasn&amp;#39;t just about a little four-year</text>
  <text start="427.34" dur="7.08">election it was about making a choice to</text>
  <text start="430.57" dur="5.89">bring law and order back into our</text>
  <text start="434.42" dur="3.63">government back into the most corrupt</text>
  <text start="436.46" dur="5.46">places of our government which is the</text>
  <text start="438.05" dur="8.51">swamp in DC how corporations had taken</text>
  <text start="441.92" dur="6.72">over and effectively made this</text>
  <text start="446.56" dur="4.09">institution that was meant to serve the</text>
  <text start="448.64" dur="5.88">people into something less than that</text>
  <text start="450.65" dur="6.33">into a crony capitalist a swamp where</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="5.52">people do whatever is most politically</text>
  <text start="456.98" dur="5.34">expedient in order to contain and keep</text>
  <text start="460.04" dur="4.56">the most power so that is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.32" dur="3.99">trying to break up here that&amp;#39;s why Q is</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="3.57">is so important that&amp;#39;s why president</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="3.39">Trump&amp;#39;s so important that&amp;#39;s why trusting</text>
  <text start="468.17" dur="3.99">the plan is so important these things</text>
  <text start="469.7" dur="4.23">take time it may not even December 5th</text>
  <text start="472.16" dur="3.99">may not lead to anything other than more</text>
  <text start="473.93" dur="4.29">questions but that&amp;#39;s okay because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.15" dur="3.92">growing what we&amp;#39;re continuing to grow</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="4.44">the amount of information that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="4.39">basically being exposed to you think if</text>
  <text start="482.66" dur="3.9">Hillary Clinton had won the election</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="3.42">that we would have any idea what was</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="2.04">going on they would have swept all this</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="2.4">under the rug</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="3.45">there were been no investigation we</text>
  <text start="490.28" dur="4.17">would have made no progress in draining</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="5.25">the swamp and you know bringing the</text>
  <text start="494.45" dur="5.73">Equality of law into our own governing</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="4.8">systems so this is really the most</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="3.63">important thing to do which is just</text>
  <text start="502.1" dur="3.39">stick with it trust the plan and keep</text>
  <text start="503.81" dur="4.56">going and that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at especially</text>

  <text start="1058.53" dur="4.8">but then it says the bridge is the</text>
  <text start="1060.75" dur="4.77">Podesta group right the bridge to these</text>
  <text start="1063.33" dur="3.87">media outlets and and cue was telling us</text>
  <text start="1065.52" dur="2.039">that the way that they got there</text>
  <text start="1067.2" dur="1.979">probably</text>
  <text start="1067.559" dur="3.72">the media was through the Podesta group</text>
  <text start="1069.179" dur="4.261">that&amp;#39;s what it was the best at doing was</text>
  <text start="1071.279" dur="4.23">planting stories with individuals who</text>
  <text start="1073.44" dur="5.459">could make those stories into a reality</text>
  <text start="1075.509" dur="5.67">because once one once one institution</text>
  <text start="1078.899" dur="5.061">news organization is willing to report</text>
  <text start="1081.179" dur="5.641">on something it does there&amp;#39;s no I mean</text>
  <text start="1083.96" dur="5.319">the media&amp;#39;s changed there&amp;#39;s nothing to</text>
  <text start="1086.82" dur="3.929">say that there aren&amp;#39;t good journalists</text>
  <text start="1089.279" dur="2.821">out there who do a lot of hard work to</text>
  <text start="1090.749" dur="3.3">source everything and make sure it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1092.1" dur="4.289">right but for the most part in these big</text>
  <text start="1094.049" dur="5.73">corporate media newsrooms if one of the</text>
  <text start="1096.389" dur="5.37">NBC runs a story CNN they use that as</text>
  <text start="1099.779" dur="3.72">the validate dating fact to run the</text>
  <text start="1101.759" dur="3.961">story it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve stopped going out and</text>
  <text start="1103.499" dur="4.231">checking these stories independently and</text>
  <text start="1105.72" dur="4.289">that to me is what is most disturbing</text>
  <text start="1107.73" dur="4.5">but that&amp;#39;s what keeps pointing us to and</text>
  <text start="1110.009" dur="3.811">it talks about basically it goes on to</text>
  <text start="1112.23" dur="3.049">talk about how the Podesta group closed</text>
  <text start="1113.82" dur="3.809">at the same time the hueber</text>
  <text start="1115.279" dur="5.411">investigation was starting in November</text>
  <text start="1117.629" dur="6.211">oh very interesting John Podesta and</text>

  <text start="1125.73" dur="5.549">see it&amp;#39;s sealed so that was something</text>
  <text start="1127.919" dur="4.83">that we talked about early on these were</text>
  <text start="1131.279" dur="3.661">sealed indictments they&amp;#39;ve probably been</text>
  <text start="1132.749" dur="3.991">sealed for a year over a year now for</text>
  <text start="1134.94" dur="5.25">some of these people but it says do they</text>
  <text start="1136.74" dur="6.33">know why why did the Podesta group close</text>
  <text start="1140.19" dur="6.959">why no leaks who else knows HRC Deal</text>
  <text start="1143.07" dur="6">request why inspector general Huber can</text>

  <text start="1159.24" dur="5.46">this all into a little a bundle for us</text>
  <text start="1161.58" dur="5.789">and it&amp;#39;s giving us hey here it is this</text>
  <text start="1164.7" dur="4.199">is it guys this is the full story that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1167.369" dur="4.581">what hopefully we&amp;#39;re going to start to</text>
  <text start="1168.899" dur="7.14">uncover with this briefing of the House</text>
  <text start="1171.95" dur="5.38">committee by John Huber on December 5th</text>
  <text start="1176.039" dur="4.051">we&amp;#39;re going to get more information</text>
  <text start="1177.33" dur="4.679">about this but this is what Q is telling</text>
  <text start="1180.09" dur="3.87">us and I have more than enough reason to</text>
  <text start="1182.009" dur="3.54">believe that q and on is connected</text>
  <text start="1183.96" dur="3.24">directly to the president to military</text>
  <text start="1185.549" dur="3.33">intelligence and that this is a way to</text>
  <text start="1187.2" dur="2.849">go around the fake news media who</text>
  <text start="1188.879" dur="5.731">doesn&amp;#39;t want to give us this information</text>
  <text start="1190.049" dur="7.201">so we have to get it here okay and I</text>
  <text start="1194.61" dur="4.47">hope that that makes sense I mean this</text>
  <text start="1197.25" dur="4.18">is what it is anyway that&amp;#39;s what all</text>
  <text start="1199.08" dur="4.36">that goes to then it says FBI DOJ</text>
  <text start="1201.43" dur="4.56">people are nervous q and it says three</text>
  <text start="1203.44" dur="4.26">to one or three and one I read this</text>
  <text start="1205.99" dur="3.57">pretty simply that there&amp;#39;s three</text>
  <text start="1207.7" dur="5.97">individuals at the FBI and one person at</text>
  <text start="1209.56" dur="5.66">DOJ who were so or who are gonna be you</text>
  <text start="1213.67" dur="4.71">know exposed to have been involved now</text>
  <text start="1215.22" dur="4.6">speculate speculatively speaking off the</text>
  <text start="1218.38" dur="3.81">top of my head I could think of a few</text>
  <text start="1219.82" dur="5.82">people at the FBI for instance you have</text>
  <text start="1222.19" dur="4.71">James Comey Andrew McCabe I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="1225.64" dur="3.33">who the other third person could be</text>
  <text start="1226.9" dur="4.37">because it could be anyone from Peter</text>
  <text start="1228.97" dur="5.25">struck to James Baker to Jim or be key</text>
  <text start="1231.27" dur="4.57">anyone okay and then at the DOJ the</text>
  <text start="1234.22" dur="3.99">first person that comes to mind is</text>
  <text start="1235.84" dur="4.14">obviously you learn at a Lynch you know</text>
  <text start="1238.21" dur="2.64">people are nervous that that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1239.98" dur="4.23">what we&amp;#39;re gonna have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="1240.85" dur="5.67">what what comes out of there and then we</text>
  <text start="1244.21" dur="4.83">go on to the next one here which is just</text>
  <text start="1246.52" dur="4.98">as fascinating q response to his own</text>
  <text start="1249.04" dur="6.18">post here giving us these two New York</text>
  <text start="1251.5" dur="5.46">Times articles now as you guys know I am</text>
  <text start="1255.22" dur="3.3">one of those people I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1256.96" dur="3.27">boycott things I don&amp;#39;t do stuff like</text>
  <text start="1258.52" dur="4.47">that but I understand that I vote with</text>
  <text start="1260.23" dur="4.89">my dollars I vote with my money you know</text>
  <text start="1262.99" dur="3.42">wherever I put a dollar that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="1265.12" dur="3.36">voting so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1266.41" dur="3.39">I choose not to get these subscriptions</text>
  <text start="1268.48" dur="2.97">like the New York Times in the</text>
  <text start="1269.8" dur="3.15">Washington Post because you can easily</text>
  <text start="1271.45" dur="3.99">find the articles without actually</text>
  <text start="1272.95" dur="3.93">having access to the New York Times and</text>
  <text start="1275.44" dur="2.88">their pay wall that they use to get</text>
  <text start="1276.88" dur="4.38">people in there I&amp;#39;m not going to support</text>
  <text start="1278.32" dur="4.95">basically what I think is basically an</text>
  <text start="1281.26" dur="6.18">organization that that you know puts out</text>
  <text start="1283.27" dur="6.57">stories that are meant to undermine the</text>
  <text start="1287.44" dur="5.13">institution of journalism and the Free</text>
  <text start="1289.84" dur="4.17">Press as opposed to other organizations</text>
  <text start="1292.57" dur="3.33">that you know put it out there for free</text>
  <text start="1294.01" dur="4.59">and actually do great work as well but</text>
  <text start="1295.9" dur="4.14">anyway long story short I can show you</text>
  <text start="1298.6" dur="3.48">it says Democrats plan to investigate</text>
  <text start="1300.04" dur="4.59">Ivanka Trump&amp;#39;s use of private emails</text>
  <text start="1302.08" dur="4.95">okay I found another story that goes</text>
  <text start="1304.63" dur="5.31">over this exactly but what it&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1307.03" dur="4.41">is they&amp;#39;ve come out Elijah Cummings from</text>
  <text start="1309.94" dur="3.3">the Democrat from Maryland has said the</text>
  <text start="1311.44" dur="5.97">house is gonna launch an investigation</text>
  <text start="1313.24" dur="7.8">in January directly into Ivanka Trump</text>
  <text start="1317.41" dur="7.41">and hurt illegal use of emails because</text>
  <text start="1321.04" dur="6.03">they got them now now they can just say</text>
  <text start="1324.82" dur="4.11">you know who cares about Hillary Ivanka</text>
  <text start="1327.07" dur="5.16">Trump did the same thing right</text>
  <text start="1328.93" dur="5.66">well not quite right because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1332.23" dur="4.189">huge huge difference between what</text>
  <text start="1334.59" dur="3.36">happened with Ivanka Trump and what</text>
  <text start="1336.419" dur="5.76">happened with Hillary Clinton and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1337.95" dur="8.49">give you an example for instance Ivanka</text>
  <text start="1342.179" dur="6.661">Trump supposedly used a private email</text>
  <text start="1346.44" dur="3.9">account but did not use a private server</text>
  <text start="1348.84" dur="3.329">or private devices</text>
  <text start="1350.34" dur="7.11">she used a private email account on</text>
  <text start="1352.169" dur="9.181">government devices that was not secure</text>
  <text start="1357.45" dur="5.88">and she was using it allegedly to put</text>
  <text start="1361.35" dur="4.199">together things during the the first</text>
  <text start="1363.33" dur="4.67">first parts of the administration things</text>
  <text start="1365.549" dur="5.311">like dinners things like you know</text>
  <text start="1368" dur="5.08">non-classified meetings things that</text>
  <text start="1370.86" dur="3.87">regular scheduling stuff there was</text>
  <text start="1373.08" dur="4.5">nothing that serious that was being</text>
  <text start="1374.73" dur="5.429">planned or coordinated and not to</text>
  <text start="1377.58" dur="4.62">mention there was no destruction of the</text>
  <text start="1380.159" dur="4.711">evidence there was no destruction of the</text>
  <text start="1382.2" dur="4.589">emails everything that was sent and</text>
  <text start="1384.87" dur="4.049">received was recorded through the White</text>
  <text start="1386.789" dur="3.691">House and they picked it up and they</text>
  <text start="1388.919" dur="3.841">logged it and they have it all very</text>
  <text start="1390.48" dur="3.48">clearly and plainly are able to go</text>
  <text start="1392.76" dur="3.36">through each and every one of the emails</text>
  <text start="1393.96" dur="4.05">to verify a that there was no classified</text>
  <text start="1396.12" dur="4.08">information on him and that be there was</text>
  <text start="1398.01" dur="4.649">nothing you know there was nothing</text>
  <text start="1400.2" dur="4.32">destroyed or deleted and and see that</text>
  <text start="1402.659" dur="3.89">there was no private servers or private</text>
  <text start="1404.52" dur="4.92">devices that were brought in to use but</text>
  <text start="1406.549" dur="4.931">throw all that out right no no no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1409.44" dur="4.2">gonna go after her cuz she knows our</text>
  <text start="1411.48" dur="5.16">private email and I hate to be so</text>
  <text start="1413.64" dur="6.24">dramatic but it&amp;#39;s kind of true and the</text>
  <text start="1416.64" dur="5.94">difference is looking at Hillary there</text>
  <text start="1419.88" dur="4.769">were 30,000 plus emails deleted there</text>
  <text start="1422.58" dur="3.839">was a private server used in in the</text>
  <text start="1424.649" dur="3.961">basement of a coffee shop somewhere</text>
  <text start="1426.419" dur="5.671">there were private device there were</text>
  <text start="1428.61" dur="5.78">non-governmental issued devices used to</text>
  <text start="1432.09" dur="6.689">send and receive classified information</text>
  <text start="1434.39" dur="5.169">that people have alleged was used or</text>
  <text start="1438.779" dur="3.211">stolen</text>
  <text start="1439.559" dur="5.281">by the Chinese and other foreign agents</text>
  <text start="1441.99" dur="4.2">and actors to use against the United</text>
  <text start="1444.84" dur="4.439">States and there&amp;#39;s been multiple reports</text>
  <text start="1446.19" dur="4.979">out about how you know one report says</text>
  <text start="1449.279" dur="4.38">that it&amp;#39;s possible that between 18 and</text>
  <text start="1451.169" dur="5.311">20 CIA agents had their identities</text>
  <text start="1453.659" dur="5.431">exposed in China and and and had a very</text>
  <text start="1456.48" dur="4.23">bad outcome for them there but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1459.09" dur="3.63">just one example not to mention the</text>
  <text start="1460.71" dur="4.199">Clinton Foundation not to mention that</text>
  <text start="1462.72" dur="4.06">the bleach bit deleting of government</text>
  <text start="1464.909" dur="5.501">emails that should have been in the</text>
  <text start="1466.78" dur="5.34">records it&amp;#39;s different there&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1470.41" dur="4.83">like there&amp;#39;s night and then there&amp;#39;s day</text>
  <text start="1472.12" dur="4.73">right so to me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so frustrating</text>
  <text start="1475.24" dur="5.73">but that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re gonna do and</text>
  <text start="1476.85" dur="5.83">that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to share now the</text>
  <text start="1480.97" dur="3.57">next article that Q gives us right here</text>
  <text start="1482.68" dur="3.99">of course like I said I don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="1484.54" dur="3.84">but it says Trump wanted to order the</text>
  <text start="1486.67" dur="3.57">Justice Department to prosecute Comey</text>
  <text start="1488.38" dur="3.12">and Clinton and guess what I found</text>
  <text start="1490.24" dur="3.03">another story that basically goes over</text>
  <text start="1491.5" dur="3.51">the full gist of the story saying</text>
