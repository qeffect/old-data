  <text start="183.9" dur="3.69">of information that is pretty useful I</text>
  <text start="185.849" dur="6.181">think so you should check that out as</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.759">well now here&amp;#39;s the first story of the</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="3.379">day that we&amp;#39;re gonna look at here so</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="6.48">this is coming out of the u.s. ni</text>
  <text start="195.409" dur="6.04">news.org and here you can see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.829" dur="3.06">saying that there were fourteen sailors</text>
  <text start="201.449" dur="3.72">that apparently died on a secretive</text>
  <text start="202.889" dur="5.701">Russian nuclear submarine Putin calls</text>
  <text start="205.169" dur="8.04">incident great loss so this was an</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="5.97">incident that was reported today and all</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="4.261">we really know is that there was a</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="5.639">damaged vessel and that there were 14</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="4.59">sailors who apparently died I think one</text>
  <text start="220.199" dur="6.03">of the reports I saw said seven of those</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="6.149">sub sailors we&amp;#39;re of the rank of captain</text>
  <text start="226.229" dur="3.78">which I&amp;#39;m not that didn&amp;#39;t make sense to</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="3.99">me but I guess they have different</text>
  <text start="230.009" dur="5.19">rankings for who runs different</text>
  <text start="232.199" dur="4.62">operations in their military ranks but</text>
  <text start="235.199" dur="4.141">with that being said I mean this is a</text>
  <text start="236.819" dur="4.92">pretty big story so how does this tie</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="5.94">into anything else well this apparently</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="8.821">happened just off of the coast of or</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="7.489">near Alaska I would think and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.859">kind of the story as it&amp;#39;s coming but</text>
  <text start="252.769" dur="4.631">apparently Vladimir Putin also called an</text>
  <text start="255.419" dur="5.43">urgent meeting with the defense Chiefs</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="6.449">after 14 Russian sailors died on a par</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="6.031">on this sub and this was a pretty big</text>
  <text start="263.849" dur="3.751">deal and of course you know if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="1.83">scrambling and</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="2.85">calling a meeting that means there was</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="4.65">something big going on well of course</text>
  <text start="270.45" dur="6.69">then you have vice president Mike Pence</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="5.91">whose plane was diverted and rerouted</text>
  <text start="277.14" dur="4.64">back to white Washington DC to the White</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="5.46">House after this incident took place</text>
  <text start="281.78" dur="6.82">obviously there was something much</text>
  <text start="284.73" dur="5.79">bigger afoot and that&amp;#39;s really where the</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="4.56">story gets very interesting so Mike</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="7.92">Pence is called he&amp;#39;s diverted off of his</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="8.3">trip back to the White House this is he</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="5.07">was supposed to be in New Hampshire for</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="4.27">undisclosed reasons at this moment they</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="4.2">say that his flight had to be turned</text>
  <text start="305.73" dur="3.57">back here&amp;#39;s the actual tweet where it</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="3.81">says vice president&amp;#39;s chief of staff</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="5.25">mark short just said the VP was on Air</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="5.49">Force two at jba when he was called back</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="3.9">the plane never took off VP join POTUS</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="3.75">at the White House for other high-level</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="5.85">meetings issue was not a national</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="7.95">security but VP discussed whatever it</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="7.46">was with POTUS briefly so conflicting</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="5.16">reports I would say obviously the big</text>
  <text start="331.76" dur="4.21">takeaway here is that his plane was</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="5.28">diverted and he was called back to DC so</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="5.25">with that here&amp;#39;s how Turner you guys</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="4.29">probably may be of heard of this radio</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="5.1">show but I found this through a tip that</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="4.59">was given to me by online somebody</text>
  <text start="346.32" dur="4.65">pointed this story out to me that just</text>
  <text start="348.03" dur="7.43">came out and apparently according to his</text>
  <text start="350.97" dur="7.32">Cerf is according to his sources or his</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="4.78">speculation at this point an American</text>
  <text start="358.29" dur="4.53">submarine was torpedoed and sunk off the</text>
  <text start="360.24" dur="4.08">Alaska coast and it says I&amp;#39;ll read this</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="3.12">story to you because I want to just read</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="4.59">this story from the Hal Turner radio</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="4.77">show and you can basically be the judge</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="3.57">of it for yourself it said an American</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="3.84">submarine operating off the coast of</text>
  <text start="372.48" dur="3.51">Alaska was reportedly torpedoed and sunk</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="3.21">during a firefight with a Russian</text>
  <text start="375.99" dur="3.66">submarine after the American sub</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="4.47">allegedly intercepted the Russian sub in</text>
  <text start="379.65" dur="4.5">American waters the Russian submarine</text>
  <text start="382.23" dur="4.62">allegedly sustained heavy damage in the</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="4.7">fight with upwards of 14 crew killed but</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="4.11">it made it back to the base in Russia</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="4.66">apparently this is how Turner speaking</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="4.56">saying I have calls into the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="393.51" dur="4.59">into my Intel sources seeking to confirm</text>

  <text start="504.84" dur="4.59">Russia territorial waters why the need</text>
  <text start="507.15" dur="3.75">to say that something&amp;#39;s fishy already</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="4.14">with the public statements from Russia</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="4.53">and US EU UK governments do not have</text>

  <text start="515.43" dur="4.71">Russian submarine nope I don&amp;#39;t buy this</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="4.44">one bit this sounds like a cover story</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="10.199">to me still digging via my Intel</text>
  <text start="522.33" dur="11.04">contacts so nothing has come no</text>
  <text start="530.339" dur="4.451">confirmation no denial as of 7:00 p.m.</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="5.17">Eastern when the</text>
  <text start="534.79" dur="7.5">latest update seems to have been posted</text>
  <text start="538.54" dur="4.8">but it says there&amp;#39;s two more updates</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="3.36">here that I thought were interesting</text>
  <text start="543.34" dur="5.13">where it just says I&amp;#39;ll give this Intel</text>
  <text start="545.65" dur="4.5">to you exactly how I just got it make of</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="3.96">it what you will it says unquote an</text>
  <text start="550.15" dur="3.78">unnatural mobilization at u.s. and</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="3.66">Western military bases in the Persian</text>

  <text start="556.09" dur="6.89">update gold bullion spikes up by $40 per</text>
  <text start="559.87" dur="5.52">ounce in the final hours of trading so</text>
  <text start="562.98" dur="5.32">there&amp;#39;s a lot to look at here and you</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="7.2">can kind of figure it out for yourself</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="7.02">but there is something to this story</text>
  <text start="572.59" dur="4.35">obviously if you think about it what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="4.17">happening here is not all just a bunch</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="5.91">of coincidences the American submarine</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="6.42">was sunk allegedly off of the coast of</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="5.04">Alaska when a Russian submarine was</text>
  <text start="585.91" dur="5.04">caught inside of our territorial waters</text>
  <text start="587.89" dur="5.73">this is what is being reported by how</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="5.37">Turner so this is still unsubstantiated</text>
  <text start="593.62" dur="5.01">as he says in his own report his sources</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="6.21">at the Pentagon have yet to confirm or</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="6.21">deny it so if that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at what</text>
  <text start="602.53" dur="4.5">I think when you look at this story is</text>
  <text start="604.84" dur="3.63">yes there is something here and then if</text>
  <text start="607.03" dur="3.21">you connect it to a story that just</text>
  <text start="608.47" dur="4.29">happened today where you have this</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="5.46">CloudFlare worldwide outage caused by</text>
  <text start="612.76" dur="5.25">quote bad software deployment unquote</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="5.61">and what happened today was pretty</text>
  <text start="618.01" dur="6.18">incredible millions of websites that use</text>
  <text start="621.31" dur="6.74">cloud fare were not accessible because</text>

  <text start="628.05" dur="5.2">always look at these as possible</text>
  <text start="630.37" dur="5.69">retaliation attacks the type of DDoS</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="5.79">attacks that could shut down entire</text>
  <text start="636.06" dur="5.5">networks which would in turn shut down</text>
  <text start="639.04" dur="5.31">you know entire web systems and how you</text>
  <text start="641.56" dur="5.49">would be able to access the web that is</text>
  <text start="644.35" dur="4.71">obviously another part of warfare that</text>
  <text start="647.05" dur="4.47">would be the digital side of it if we</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="4.95">were to get into a major global conflict</text>
  <text start="651.52" dur="4.8">based off of a you know a you know a</text>
  <text start="654.01" dur="5.43">powder keg incident like what&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="656.32" dur="5.1">here in allegedly what&amp;#39;s happened in the</text>
  <text start="659.44" dur="4.95">waters just off the coast of Alaska</text>
  <text start="661.42" dur="4.29">where you have allegedly the possibility</text>
  <text start="664.39" dur="2.73">that there was a Russian sub that was</text>
  <text start="665.71" dur="3.03">caught doing something that shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.12" dur="6.06">have inside of our water</text>
  <text start="668.74" dur="8.01">and that could have meant some severe</text>
  <text start="673.18" dur="5.43">casualties but we&amp;#39;re still we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="4.04">waiting to hear the reports and and you</text>
  <text start="678.61" dur="4.23">know at the end of the day guys look</text>
  <text start="680.79" dur="3.37">we&amp;#39;re here to look at this information</text>
  <text start="682.84" dur="3.48">because it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="684.16" dur="5.1">understand how this all connects and</text>
  <text start="686.32" dur="7.52">here&amp;#39;s how it would look if I were to</text>
  <text start="689.26" dur="7.08">hypothetically say you know want to</text>
  <text start="693.84" dur="4.84">hypothesize on how they would respond</text>
  <text start="696.34" dur="4.89">they might knock out an entire network</text>
  <text start="698.68" dur="7.38">to show us that their cyber attack</text>
  <text start="701.23" dur="6.78">capability is strong and it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="706.06" dur="4.17">tit-for-tat thing and you have to work</text>
  <text start="708.01" dur="3.87">on de-escalation really because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="3.9">very easy to continue to escalate these</text>
  <text start="711.88" dur="4.38">kind of attacks on each other&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="714.13" dur="3.99">infrastructure and I think this all kind</text>
  <text start="716.26" dur="3.36">of started with what I showed you guys</text>
  <text start="718.12" dur="5.58">the beginning of this video the meeting</text>
  <text start="719.62" dur="6.24">between President Trump and chairman kim</text>
  <text start="723.7" dur="4.98">jeong-hoon I really think that hit a</text>
  <text start="725.86" dur="4.92">nerve with Russia because I think that</text>
  <text start="728.68" dur="4.32">Russia&amp;#39;s ploy from the beginning has</text>
  <text start="730.78" dur="4.17">been to make make good neighbors with</text>
  <text start="733" dur="3.93">the Chinese and all the other Asian</text>
  <text start="734.95" dur="4.14">countries knowing that that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="736.93" dur="3.51">their most vulnerable borders even</text>
  <text start="739.09" dur="2.97">though it is Siberia they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="740.44" dur="5.82">anybody out there really to defend that</text>
  <text start="742.06" dur="6.78">area and it&amp;#39;s kind of uninhabitable but</text>
  <text start="746.26" dur="4.08">at the same time they want to keep their</text>
  <text start="748.84" dur="5.25">territorial claims and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="750.34" dur="6.36">to rile up the Chinese so if he sees the</text>
  <text start="754.09" dur="7.02">US and the Chinese becoming closer visa</text>
  <text start="756.7" dur="6.24">vie North Korea which is basically right</text>
  <text start="761.11" dur="3.42">on the border of China so there is a</text>
  <text start="762.94" dur="3.81">huge influence from the Chinese there</text>
  <text start="764.53" dur="5.94">that you you got to understand that this</text>
  <text start="766.75" dur="5.7">is fully a kind of a geopolitical chess</text>
  <text start="770.47" dur="4.05">game that we&amp;#39;re in the middle of here</text>
  <text start="772.45" dur="3.93">and I think this all started with</text>
  <text start="774.52" dur="4.05">President there was the the New York</text>
  <text start="776.38" dur="3.78">Times started this and I hate to say</text>
  <text start="778.57" dur="2.79">that I just think that this recent</text>
  <text start="780.16" dur="3.6">series of events I&amp;#39;m not going to say</text>
  <text start="781.36" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re the reason for everything but I</text>
  <text start="783.76" dur="5.1">recall a story that was posted by the</text>
  <text start="786.46" dur="5.16">New York Times which alleged that the</text>
  <text start="788.86" dur="5.16">United States had been ramping up its</text>
  <text start="791.62" dur="5.04">cyber attacks on Russia on Russian</text>
  <text start="794.02" dur="3.93">infrastructure with regard to certain</text>
  <text start="796.66" dur="4.38">areas that were responsible for</text>
  <text start="797.95" dur="4.68">funneling you know the pipelines that go</text>
  <text start="801.04" dur="3.48">that had been agreed to by</text>
  <text start="802.63" dur="3.75">Germany to go into Europe there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="804.52" dur="3.63">big point of contention for the United</text>
  <text start="806.38" dur="5.1">States they didn&amp;#39;t like the fact that</text>
  <text start="808.15" dur="5.13">Angela Merkel was making deals with the</text>
  <text start="811.48" dur="4.29">Russians behind closed doors and saying</text>
  <text start="813.28" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re gonna set up pipelines and become</text>
  <text start="815.77" dur="4.35">you know close buddies with the Russians</text>
  <text start="818.08" dur="4.53">because obviously president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="820.12" dur="5.46">interest would be to sell liquid LNG</text>
  <text start="822.61" dur="5.37">liquid natural gas I should say liquid</text>
  <text start="825.58" dur="4.43">natural gas which is one of our big</text>
  <text start="827.98" dur="4.71">exports were one of the world&amp;#39;s largest</text>
  <text start="830.01" dur="5.02">exporters of energy in the world or if</text>
  <text start="832.69" dur="5.91">not we are now the number one exporter I</text>
  <text start="835.03" dur="5.49">believe so but to have what we would</text>
  <text start="838.6" dur="4.14">call our suppose at European allies</text>
  <text start="840.52" dur="4.2">making this deal with Russia when</text>
  <text start="842.74" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re also begging for billions of</text>
  <text start="844.72" dur="7.23">dollars in military security to defend</text>
  <text start="848.65" dur="8.43">them from Russia it really it shows you</text>
  <text start="851.95" dur="8.31">just how you know basically how</text>
  <text start="857.08" dur="5.42">two-faced the leaders of the Russian are</text>
  <text start="860.26" dur="4.44">excuse me of the European Union are</text>
  <text start="862.5" dur="3.87">because they don&amp;#39;t care they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="864.7" dur="3.96">take the cheap gas from Russia and</text>
  <text start="866.37" dur="4.21">they&amp;#39;ll just ignore things like certain</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="4.47">sanctions that we want to employ and</text>
  <text start="870.58" dur="4.38">different business restrictions even</text>
  <text start="873.13" dur="3.84">though they seem to comply with most of</text>
  <text start="874.96" dur="4.02">them I&amp;#39;ll give them that but this is the</text>
  <text start="876.97" dur="4.56">story you know we have this very big</text>
  <text start="878.98" dur="5.07">cloud fair attack and it relates back to</text>
  <text start="881.53" dur="4.59">what we&amp;#39;re talking about with this</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="4.41">alleged report of an American submarine</text>
  <text start="886.12" dur="6.15">that may have been involved in a tragic</text>
  <text start="888.46" dur="7.38">tragic incident but we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="892.27" dur="8.04">kind of just wait and see so for me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.84" dur="5.55">it it gets all very very convoluted when</text>
  <text start="900.31" dur="3.63">you start looking at what the Anton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="901.39" dur="6.84">are putting together because there is a</text>
  <text start="903.94" dur="6.78">lot of very interesting things that we</text>
  <text start="908.23" dur="4.14">should look at so in order to do that I</text>
  <text start="910.72" dur="3">want to start here this graphic that was</text>
  <text start="912.37" dur="6.32">put together by one of the Anton&amp;#39;s was</text>
  <text start="913.72" dur="4.97">very fascinating so the other day this</text>
  <text start="918.72" dur="5.65">baseball player I think his name what</text>
  <text start="921.52" dur="8.1">was it Savage but he was number 45 on</text>
  <text start="924.37" dur="8.37">the Los Angeles Angels or I&amp;#39;m not sure I</text>
  <text start="929.62" dur="5.64">think that&amp;#39;s the Angels right so this</text>
  <text start="932.74" dur="3.81">guy was found dead in a hotel room and</text>
  <text start="935.26" dur="4.98">one of the trending hashtag</text>
  <text start="936.55" dur="6.39">was of course hashtag r.i.p 45 then</text>
  <text start="940.24" dur="6.75">President Trump tweets in the morning</text>
  <text start="942.94" dur="5.19">big 4th of July in DC salute to America</text>

  <text start="949.779" dur="3.691">and showing to the American people among</text>
  <text start="952.12" dur="3.089">other things the strongest and most</text>

  <text start="955.209" dur="6.271">incredible flyovers and biggest ever</text>
  <text start="957.43" dur="8.01">fireworks so there&amp;#39;s really no reason</text>
  <text start="961.48" dur="5.37">for the F to be capitalized here and you</text>
  <text start="965.44" dur="3.63">know where the Anton&amp;#39;s go when they get</text>
  <text start="966.85" dur="3.6">to F&amp;#39;s obviously false flag it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="969.07" dur="3.56">first thing that they think of and</text>
  <text start="970.45" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s an interesting point</text>
  <text start="972.63" dur="4.24">Rachel Sutherland I think was one of the</text>
  <text start="975.16" dur="3.869">first ones to report that Air Force two</text>
  <text start="976.87" dur="3.659">had been diverted and the Vice President</text>
  <text start="979.029" dur="4.981">had been brought back to Washington for</text>
  <text start="980.529" dur="5.401">undisclosed emergency meeting and then</text>
  <text start="984.01" dur="4.68">you had what we learned about in this</text>
  <text start="985.93" dur="6.02">how important a report about all the</text>
  <text start="988.69" dur="5.61">different individual global</text>

  <text start="996.01" dur="6.75">government meeting the European Union</text>
  <text start="998.17" dur="6.09">meeting so this this was definitely</text>
  <text start="1002.76" dur="3.15">something that we look at and go okay</text>
  <text start="1004.26" dur="4.34">well there&amp;#39;s obviously a lot more there</text>
  <text start="1005.91" dur="5.46">and then the White House puts out this</text>

  <text start="1034.439" dur="3.51">this all goes back to the cloud fair</text>
  <text start="1036.419" dur="4.831">thing and it was talking about this cue</text>
  <text start="1037.949" dur="9.451">post what was this cue post but I think</text>
  <text start="1041.25" dur="8.01">that says 1043 and this was</text>
  <text start="1047.4" dur="3.96">on in the queue pose 10:43 I believe so</text>
  <text start="1049.26" dur="5.81">anyway it said here net will be paused</text>

  <text start="1062.4" dur="4.26">the two F&amp;#39;s is that does that mean that</text>
  <text start="1064.53" dur="4.14">this there&amp;#39;s something more to this this</text>
  <text start="1066.66" dur="3.66">could be something that we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="1068.67" dur="5.55">yet I mean this is where I go to</text>
  <text start="1070.32" dur="5.13">we were told previously this post here</text>
