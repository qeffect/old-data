  <text start="127.29" dur="6">bridge discussion so let&amp;#39;s just go ahead</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="4.201">and take a second and watch this jump to</text>

  <text start="148.59" dur="5.549">take a look at googled that and up comes</text>
  <text start="150.81" dur="6.45">this book from David Remnick the bridge</text>
  <text start="154.139" dur="5.041">life and rise of Barack Obama and a</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="4.589">quote right next to it from stanislav</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="4.919">luma which says the best spy will be</text>
  <text start="161.849" dur="5.79">everyone&amp;#39;s best friend not a shadowy</text>
  <text start="164.099" dur="4.711">figure in the corner and I for a long so</text>
  <text start="167.639" dur="3.331">I&amp;#39;m going to stop it right there and</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="4.62">just let you guys know when I made that</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="5.46">video previously I knew about the David</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="6.509">Remnick book and I didn&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="5.94">this quote but I understood that there</text>
  <text start="179.939" dur="4.23">was a book named the bridge by Barack</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="3.929">Obama but you have to understand how</text>
  <text start="184.169" dur="4.47">everything is there there are there</text>
  <text start="186.299" dur="7.381">multiple entendre so there&amp;#39;s multiple</text>
  <text start="188.639" dur="7.68">meanings so I believe that this is a</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="4.08">very valid explanation if you guys want</text>
  <text start="196.319" dur="4.681">to listen to the rest of it I&amp;#39;ll let you</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="7.17">hear it but um also we&amp;#39;re gonna go back</text>
  <text start="201" dur="6.87">into how the bridge community center</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="5.19">ties in all this long time a very very</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="3.959">long time especially when the fake birth</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="4.769">certificate came out and Sheriff Arpaio</text>
  <text start="211.829" dur="5.49">s investigation into who Barry Soetoro</text>
  <text start="214.889" dur="4.621">really is I&amp;#39;ve drawn the conclusion as</text>
  <text start="217.319" dur="4.62">many of us have that he&amp;#39;s a creation of</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="5.249">the CIA Tracy your thoughts on this</text>
  <text start="221.939" dur="5.461">latest post from Q I think this post is</text>
  <text start="224.759" dur="5.641">super interesting and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="4.41">much speculation either alike there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="3.059">lot to address in what you just said and</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="4.259">I think a lot of it is a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="233.459" dur="4.971">on point um this actually relates back</text>
  <text start="236.069" dur="4.861">to nuclear weapons in the Potomac River</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="4.929">until the water supply which ties back</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="4.229">into a different post of Q&amp;#39;s now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="243.359" dur="3.78">think that that&amp;#39;s literal personally</text>
  <text start="245.159" dur="4.771">after reading these things for so long I</text>
  <text start="247.139" dur="4.201">think it&amp;#39;s metaphoric there are some</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="3.299">people have done some really good work</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="4.47">into this and I&amp;#39;ve been able to tie it</text>
  <text start="253.229" dur="5.79">together that maybe they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="5.969">hinting at Obama being some sort of an</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="4.591">embedded Russian spy which I would find</text>
  <text start="261.779" dur="2.321">really interesting given we know about</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="4.09">his</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="5.88">um you know Islamic roots and all that</text>
  <text start="267.7" dur="7.17">which so there you go</text>
  <text start="269.98" dur="6">now okay let me connect this whole</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="4.2">picture for you</text>
  <text start="275.98" dur="5.1">from my perspective we&amp;#39;ll go back to the</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="6.81">queue we can see exactly what he put</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="7.26">here so as you can see this is what he</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="5.67">put here now I&amp;#39;m gonna put this all</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="4.86">together for you and I hope that my</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="3.15">computer isn&amp;#39;t lagged because my mic</text>
  <text start="293.2" dur="4.71">keeps cutting out right at key moments</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="5.48">when I&amp;#39;m about to expose very critical</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="5.37">information that&amp;#39;s very suspicious to me</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="6.69">but I&amp;#39;ll just move right past that and</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="3.59">keep giving you the information now</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="5.73">there are three bridges okay that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="5.48">going to connect here in all of this</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="8.86">there&amp;#39;s the bridge community center</text>
  <text start="316.23" dur="9.22">there&amp;#39;s the bridge that was written by</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="6.24">David red Mick the biography of Obama</text>
  <text start="325.45" dur="7.7">and then there&amp;#39;s another bridge that we</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="9.66">can look at and that is a bridge</text>
  <text start="333.15" dur="6.91">referenced now this is all speculative</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="4.62">we can tie it all together however we</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="6.42">see fit I&amp;#39;m not going to make that</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="5.97">presumption of knowledge on your behalf</text>
  <text start="346.48" dur="3.63">on my behalf but I will tell you this</text>
  <text start="348.67" dur="3.99">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of strange</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="4.68">coincidences so if we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="3.77">these strange coincidences objectively</text>
  <text start="354.79" dur="7.52">then we can put together a few things</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="9.19">okay that the Stanislaw from Lou Nev</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="7.35">connection to the cue post is referring</text>
  <text start="365.62" dur="6.39">to a bridge the double</text>
  <text start="369.66" dur="5.47">now the payback for today I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="6.15">how to break that down yet but if we can</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="7.73">tie all three of these ideas to get we</text>
  <text start="378.16" dur="8.16">can basically formulate a new theory so</text>
  <text start="382.86" dur="6.88">let&amp;#39;s just go through it now what would</text>
  <text start="386.32" dur="5.7">that theory look like you guys have seen</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="3.989">this I posted it but it&amp;#39;s referring to</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="5.82">the poisoning of the Potomac River and</text>
  <text start="393.729" dur="6.301">it was a plot that was revealed</text>
  <text start="397.84" dur="4.94">by Stanislav Luna to the American</text>
  <text start="400.03" dur="10.29">government after he defected in 1992</text>
  <text start="402.78" dur="11.55">from Russia and what he did is he told</text>
  <text start="410.32" dur="6.39">us about a plan to poison Tomek now</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="4.51">recording supposedly there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.71" dur="5.489">reports of construction happening along</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="5.67">the Potomac and this individual James</text>
  <text start="422.199" dur="4.5">Comey has put out this cryptic tweet</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="3.81">which hew has already taken the time to</text>
  <text start="426.699" dur="5.521">break down one of his former tweets</text>
  <text start="428.32" dur="7.02">which was a veiled threat to former</text>
  <text start="432.22" dur="6.77">colleague Andrew McCabe that was</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="6.57">basically a coded threat if you will and</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="4.69">he broke that down succinctly and</text>
  <text start="441.91" dur="3.42">perfectly for us and I&amp;#39;ve had I&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="4.11">lot of chances to look at people who</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="7.41">have broken down this tweet for what it</text>
  <text start="447.79" dur="9.15">is and to me it&amp;#39;s not nothing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.74" dur="7.679">something there this is interesting the</text>
  <text start="456.94" dur="5.91">bridge this was a book written by David</text>
  <text start="460.419" dur="4.56">Remnick the life and rise of a Barack</text>

  <text start="471.01" dur="3.99">you of anyone I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and</text>
  <text start="472.75" dur="4.71">leave that there but then how does this</text>

  <text start="487.9" dur="5.94">anywhere but this connects okay and how</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="4.59">does it connect well I will explain it</text>
  <text start="493.84" dur="7.77">to you right now the way that this</text>
  <text start="496.09" dur="8.73">connects is that who is stanislav luna</text>
