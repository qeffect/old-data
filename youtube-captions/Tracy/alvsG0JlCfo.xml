  <text start="0.11" dur="8.319">good afternoon it is 3 p.m. on Eastern</text>
  <text start="4.41" dur="5.309">Time on Saturday May 6 2007 teen I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="8.429" dur="7.5">been gone for a little while</text>
  <text start="9.719" dur="8.701">um because sometimes doing this stuff</text>
  <text start="15.929" dur="4.68">daily and delving into all these topics</text>
  <text start="18.42" dur="6.93">and doing all this research really makes</text>
  <text start="20.609" dur="6.871">me need to step away and I do and I</text>
  <text start="25.35" dur="5.64">delve into some other projects and get</text>
  <text start="27.48" dur="5.849">some other things done and come back a</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="5.01">lot more refreshed than I was when I</text>
  <text start="33.329" dur="5.941">left and right now I&amp;#39;m back listening to</text>
  <text start="36" dur="9.11">and reading a lot about the law of</text>
  <text start="39.27" dur="8.43">attraction listening to Abraham Hicks</text>
  <text start="45.11" dur="5.469">reading a lot of inspirational sort of</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="4.379">novels and books that are kind of</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="5.881">getting me more focused on the positive</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="5.941">and I don&amp;#39;t have a channel that talks</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="6.3">about all this stuff</text>
  <text start="58.02" dur="6.959">so I&amp;#39;m doing a video on a conversation</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="4.62">and this is so counterintuitive to what</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="4.351">I&amp;#39;m trying to accomplish over the past</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="3.96">few days but I&amp;#39;m doing this video</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="3.899">because I&amp;#39;ve been involved in this</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="8.27">conversation I got brought into it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="10.731">about 40 other people um five days ago</text>
  <text start="79.61" dur="9.6">and the listing</text>
  <text start="83.96" dur="10.17">vacations are a mile long and basically</text>
  <text start="89.21" dur="6.409">what ended up happening is there was a</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="7.489">gent that it was a debate about</text>
  <text start="95.619" dur="11.771">pedophiles with the actual pedophiles</text>
  <text start="101.619" dur="12.581">saying that our our meaning non</text>
  <text start="107.39" dur="16.11">pedophiles our reaction to them our sort</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="12.99">of response to their sexuality depraved</text>
  <text start="123.5" dur="6.6">sexuality is what causes them to act</text>
  <text start="127.19" dur="4.86">upon it in other words if we were just</text>
  <text start="130.1" dur="3.3">to hug a pedophile and say they were</text>
  <text start="132.05" dur="5.31">accepted in society</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="8.76">then they wouldn&amp;#39;t lash out and be with</text>
  <text start="137.36" dur="8.36">children which I found to be asked</text>
  <text start="142.16" dur="3.56">backwards and ridiculous</text>
  <text start="146.89" dur="6.939">because by that logic no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="7.949">responsible for their own actions I need</text>
  <text start="153.829" dur="7.47">you to stop me from doing what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="158.209" dur="5.431">intending to do and if you don&amp;#39;t act the</text>
  <text start="161.299" dur="3.361">right way then I&amp;#39;m going to do it and</text>
  <text start="163.64" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s your fault</text>
  <text start="164.66" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s wrong with this entire</text>
  <text start="166.91" dur="4.98">country with a lot of the world that</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="4.29">nobody nobody will take responsibility</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="5.189">for themselves</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="4.77">they want to place the blame on everyone</text>
  <text start="177.079" dur="3.541">else well I don&amp;#39;t have enough money</text>
  <text start="178.28" dur="8.64">because you X Y Z and I don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="7.649">because X Y Z and you know we need the</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="3.09">government to provide health care</text>
  <text start="188.269" dur="4.261">because I can&amp;#39;t get it myself and I</text>
  <text start="190.01" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t get a job because bla bla bla and</text>
  <text start="192.53" dur="3.989">I can&amp;#39;t go to college because the this</text>
  <text start="194.6" dur="2.37">that I can&amp;#39;t afford college because bla</text>
  <text start="196.519" dur="3.481">bla bla</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a culture of</text>
  <text start="200" dur="7.049">blaming other people and never taking</text>
  <text start="203.18" dur="6.119">responsibility for yourself and as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="207.049" dur="4.711">speaking these words I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="209.299" dur="5.34">realizing how it&amp;#39;s a teaching moment for</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="4.54">everybody the subject that I started on</text>
  <text start="214.639" dur="4.121">is absolutely abhorrent and</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="5.1">fasting but I think it&amp;#39;s a teaching</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="7.37">moment for everybody nobody is</text>
  <text start="221.4" dur="7.59">responsible for your actions but you and</text>
  <text start="226.13" dur="6.46">while these pedophiles are or are</text>
  <text start="228.99" dur="6">arguing socked crime in other words we</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="8.67">have a thought that we&amp;#39;re attracted to</text>
  <text start="234.99" dur="7.29">child and we should not be chastised for</text>
  <text start="241.26" dur="7.29">our thoughts</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="12.48">however immoral they agree they are well</text>
  <text start="248.55" dur="8.249">on its premise one may agree that</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="4.5">thought crimes are not a crime because</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="4.051">by that logic then you know anybody</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="3.63">could be prosecuted for their thoughts</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="5.85">if they don&amp;#39;t go along with the status</text>
  <text start="262.89" dur="6.26">quo at the end of the day you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="6.57">responsible for those thoughts you are</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="6.94">no one else is responsible for them you</text>
  <text start="273.27" dur="6.83">are just like I&amp;#39;m responsible for the</text>
  <text start="276.09" dur="8.49">thoughts that I have and I can choose to</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="9.24">I can choose to have thoughts and to act</text>
  <text start="284.58" dur="6.9">upon them in positive ways to advance</text>
  <text start="289.34" dur="8.71">humans to advance society to advance</text>
  <text start="291.48" dur="8.13">myself because after all anything one</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.05">wants they want because they&amp;#39;ll feel</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="6.96">better in the having of it right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="9.48">what that&amp;#39;s what they believe anyway it</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="6.45">just blew my mind that and part of me</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="3.96">for that incomplete thought I just had</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="4.26">kind of rambling here but it just blew</text>
  <text start="315.54" dur="4.25">my mind the arguments that we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="6.17">back and forth here</text>
  <text start="319.79" dur="3.66">so here&amp;#39;s Thomas</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="4.71">saying denying social acceptance for</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="4.89">pedophiles drives them into depression</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="7.08">and desperation which leads to a higher</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="5.64">chance of committing a crime it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="5.07">disturbing how much more important your</text>
  <text start="339.66" dur="5.22">hatred towards pedo is then predict it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="3.96">disturbing how much more important your</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="4.92">hatred toward speedos is to you than</text>
  <text start="346.98" dur="4.44">protecting children is this this</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="3.42">statement right here is the one that</text>
  <text start="351.42" dur="6.57">really sent me over the edge and you</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="7.47">know it&amp;#39;s basically saying either you</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="5.13">stop hating pedophiles or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="5.28">responsible for the pedophile acting</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="9.64">upon their thoughts how sick and twisted</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="8.95">of a mentality is that and then someone</text>
  <text start="372.76" dur="3.99">other protect kids from PTO&amp;#39;s and Thomas</text>
  <text start="374.92" dur="4.23">says which is the exact opposite of what</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="5.61">you&amp;#39;re doing in other words it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="6.75">fault now if a pedophile reads this and</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="5.64">goes out and acts upon his thoughts it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.9" dur="5.43">your fault because you were mean to him</text>
  <text start="388" dur="7.82">what in the everliving hell is that all</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="8.09">about this is how these people think</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="6.13">then why do you not do that</text>
  <text start="399.42" dur="5.92">he says keeping children safe from PTO&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.95" dur="4.92">is safe and he says then why do you not</text>
  <text start="405.34" dur="3.15">do that you&amp;#39;re making PTO&amp;#39;s more likely</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="3.21">to commit crimes and then I said how are</text>
  <text start="408.49" dur="4.05">we making you guys commit crimes</text>
  <text start="410.08" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;m not carat Kareem said that and</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="3.27">Thomas says you&amp;#39;re making some commit</text>
  <text start="414.16" dur="3.45">crimes by driving them into depression</text>
  <text start="415.81" dur="6.39">if you have nothing to lose no support</text>
  <text start="417.61" dur="9.27">and no hope you&amp;#39;re more likely i guess</text>
  <text start="422.2" dur="5.28">he means to attack a child and you made</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="2.31">me do it</text>
  <text start="427.48" dur="3.36">you made me do it it sounds like a</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="5.04">five-year-old arguing with his brother</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="5.94">or sister it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sick it&amp;#39;s a horrible</text>
  <text start="434.23" dur="4.77">way to think it is it is a horrible way</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="4.86">to think that you are such a weak person</text>
  <text start="439" dur="6.15">that you cannot take responsibility for</text>
  <text start="441.64" dur="5.85">yourself Oh someone said something mean</text>
  <text start="445.15" dur="4.2">to me so I went out and killed someone</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="5.43">up lock that person up it&amp;#39;s their fault</text>

  <text start="452.92" dur="7.29">back passwords how it sounds doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="6.42">mean to me all I care about is</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="6.06">protecting innocent people I back up my</text>
  <text start="464.95" dur="2.94">claims where everyone who comes have</text>
  <text start="466.27" dur="4.98">proof that I am wrong blocks my resorts</text>
  <text start="467.89" dur="4.53">to insults or never responds again then</text>

  <text start="472.42" dur="8.67">that come on backing Thomas&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="478.32" dur="4.27">thoughts so you know what I did which is</text>
  <text start="481.09" dur="4.35">something that I don&amp;#39;t think now this is</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="4.92">days this is going on for days days this</text>

  <text start="489.1" dur="5.16">so much so that I couldn&amp;#39;t even find the</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="4.23">main post and I believe the reason why</text>
  <text start="494.26" dur="4.44">is because it was started by Clive from</text>
  <text start="496" dur="4.59">heart progress and one of the folks on</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="5.75">there had blocked me because I got into</text>
  <text start="500.59" dur="3.86">a war with them about the age of consent</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="5.11">and I can&amp;#39;t even find the beginning of</text>
  <text start="509" dur="3.479">this thread but it went on for days and</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="4.499">I get notification after notification so</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="8.011">I popped my hat in the ring after all</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="7.38">these notifications and i said thomas is</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="3.87">seeking social acceptance because he</text>
  <text start="522.169" dur="3.871">wants to abuse children he says that if</text>
  <text start="524.36" dur="7.59">we cast him out it will make him prone</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="7.98">to act thomas says i&amp;#39;m already cast out</text>
  <text start="531.95" dur="3.42">and i haven&amp;#39;t offended doesn&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="534.02" dur="7.14">the fact that depression is a major</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="7.35">factor in criminal behavior to county I</text>
  <text start="541.16" dur="3.06">seek to count your claims if they made</text>
  <text start="542.72" dur="3.63">me do it none of them work in your favor</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="5.4">normal people don&amp;#39;t accept unnatural</text>
  <text start="546.35" dur="4.32">behavior to enable you he says you would</text>
  <text start="549.62" dur="3.18">increase the chances of someone</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="5.28">offending that&amp;#39;s all but it doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="552.8" dur="3.51">to be and I said you know what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.95" dur="1.32">right</text>
  <text start="556.31" dur="2.43">why don&amp;#39;t you come over for dinner and</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="6.11">tell me all about how you want to have</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="9.41">sex with children or that and</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="8.38">it&amp;#39;s going down and down and down</text>
  <text start="568.15" dur="7.54">everybody is pretty much saying the same</text>
  <text start="571.76" dur="5.49">thing that I&amp;#39;m thinking and I say your</text>
  <text start="575.69" dur="4.17">logic is flawed and disgusting people</text>
  <text start="577.25" dur="7.02">don&amp;#39;t make others do anything you have a</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="6.81">choice and then I basically say why is</text>
  <text start="584.27" dur="3.84">it my responsibility take ownership of</text>
  <text start="586.67" dur="2.85">yourself maybe this world would be</text>
  <text start="588.11" dur="5.34">better if people stopped blaming</text>
  <text start="589.52" dur="6.72">everyone else but I took it a step</text>
  <text start="593.45" dur="6.24">further and I reached out to Thomas and</text>
  <text start="596.24" dur="4.53">I asked him for an interview I reached</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="2.19">out to Thomas I&amp;#39;ve asked for an</text>
  <text start="600.77" dur="2.43">interview he spent days trying to</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="3.329">convince everyone of his points let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.2" dur="3.03">see what happens when I reached out to</text>
  <text start="605.209" dur="3.57">him and I won&amp;#39;t share the conversation</text>
  <text start="606.23" dur="4.89">because I don&amp;#39;t have his permission he</text>
  <text start="608.779" dur="3.781">was nervous of course I made it very</text>
  <text start="611.12" dur="2.37">clear that I don&amp;#39;t agree with his</text>
  <text start="612.56" dur="3.51">viewpoints and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="4.41">disgusting I made it very clear that</text>
  <text start="616.07" dur="3.81">what he&amp;#39;s saying is absolutely abhorrent</text>
  <text start="617.9" dur="3.78">I made it very clear that the</text>
  <text start="619.88" dur="3.51">normalization of pedophilia is not</text>
  <text start="621.68" dur="3.57">something that&amp;#39;s going to happen that</text>
  <text start="623.39" dur="4.68">there are millions of us dedicated to</text>
  <text start="625.25" dur="6.23">stopping pedophilia I made it very clear</text>
  <text start="628.07" dur="3.41">that he needs to get help and</text>
  <text start="632.2" dur="4.89">said you spent days what people attacked</text>
  <text start="634.9" dur="5.27">you trying to get a point across and I</text>
  <text start="637.09" dur="8.04">don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ve been successful so</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="6.64">I&amp;#39;ll give you a microphone and then let</text>
  <text start="645.13" dur="2.91">you say what you got to say and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="646.81" dur="6.2">going to promise you that I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="648.04" dur="4.97">to come back with some hardcore hatred</text>
  <text start="653.73" dur="9.37">but it I want to know why these people</text>
  <text start="661.18" dur="4.89">think this what makes them think this</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="5.22">way uh you know why do they think this</text>
  <text start="666.07" dur="6.75">is this is normal</text>
  <text start="668.32" dur="6.62">why should it be I dedicate a large</text>
  <text start="672.82" dur="9.09">portion of my life to the research</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="8.74">against pedophiles so it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="681.91" dur="6.39">to me that one should present himself to</text>
  <text start="683.68" dur="7.11">me who has a girlfriend an adult</text>
  <text start="688.3" dur="6.93">girlfriend and who has never acted on</text>
  <text start="690.79" dur="5.85">his thoughts now we would argue these</text>

  <text start="696.64" dur="7.77">are but their thoughts so is he a</text>
  <text start="700.63" dur="5.61">criminal before he acts on anything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="3.75">an interesting debate and it&amp;#39;s a hard</text>
