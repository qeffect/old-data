  <text start="120.06" dur="4.169">ok so what I wanted to touch on today is</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="3.691">something that&amp;#39;s been absolutely</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="3.6">infuriating me over the past several</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="6.299">days and I have tweeted about it several</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="5.431">times and that is that the media as a</text>
  <text start="132.569" dur="1.261">whole</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="2.01">no matter</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="5.67">what side of the aisle outside of a</text>
  <text start="135.27" dur="5.64">handful of folks on Fox News is getting</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="3.99">this story wrong and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="4.23">doing it on purpose and you know even</text>
  <text start="143.49" dur="4.68">even some of the people that we thought</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="6.99">were arbiters of truth are seemingly</text>
  <text start="148.17" dur="6.51">getting details of this wrong that are</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="4.47">crucial to understanding the story as a</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="4.35">whole they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="5.04">obfuscating they&amp;#39;re allowing people that</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="4.23">they have on as guests to cite facts</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="4.29">that aren&amp;#39;t correct they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="6.09">misinterpreting what key witnesses in</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="5.91">the story say like Giuliani etc they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="4.98">interrupting when they start to get to a</text>
  <text start="171.84" dur="6">point that makes sense they&amp;#39;re flat-out</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="6.09">lying about things like things that are</text>
  <text start="177.84" dur="7.71">just not even true are being broadcast</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="6.6">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s disturbing like to a level</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="3.33">that it really hasn&amp;#39;t been before like</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;ve been disturbed about the media</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="5.07">before but this is to a level where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="4.53">just this it&amp;#39;s almost criminal I was</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="3.75">talking about this on the podcast with</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="3.05">Frank yesterday that there there should</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="4.37">be liability here for what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="5.25">because they&amp;#39;re quite literally</text>
  <text start="202.07" dur="4.81">gaslighting the American people and</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="6.1">especially in the case of Fox when you</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="6.12">have a handful of you know a lineup of a</text>
  <text start="210.57" dur="5.73">handful of people who are consistently</text>
  <text start="213" dur="7.709">factual and then you introduce unfactual</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="7.65">things to that same channel it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="220.709" dur="6.331">easier to dissuade people into believing</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="5.16">the falsity because they say okay well</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="3.72">these five people are honest so that</text>
  <text start="229.11" dur="4.98">must be true and oh my gosh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="5.25">concerning so I&amp;#39;m going to play a clip</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="3.6">from this morning on Cavuto and I know</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s a never Trumper and I know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="6.11">been critical of Trump martha maccallum</text>
  <text start="240.3" dur="5.73">yeah she&amp;#39;s one of them yes absolutely</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ll get into that in a second but this</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="4.32">this clip this morning really annoyed me</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="5.259">Cavuto did push back a little bit on</text>
  <text start="250.35" dur="4.77">this to be fair but not in the right way</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="6.691">and I think it&amp;#39;s really important that</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="8.73">we play this outright blatant falsity</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="7.71">that is not even true at all that</text>
  <text start="263.85" dur="6.779">broadcast on Fox this morning out of the</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="6.269">of Al Green Democrat from Texas here we</text>
  <text start="270.629" dur="9.63">go wasn&amp;#39;t in this fair use this is in</text>
  <text start="273.629" dur="9.931">fair use they&amp;#39;ve been trying to impeach</text>
  <text start="280.259" dur="6.571">me from the day I got elected I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="4.409">going through this for three years all</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="3.42">right well maybe not since he was</text>
  <text start="287.969" dur="3.66">elected but the next guess has been</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="4.34">calling for the president&amp;#39;s impeachment</text>
  <text start="291.629" dur="5.88">since at least he was shortly sworn in</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="4.629">but for not all the obvious reasons now</text>
  <text start="297.509" dur="3.991">he&amp;#39;s got a lot of the Democratic world</text>
  <text start="299.219" dur="4.681">with him but he was there when no one</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="4.11">was there the Democratic congressman</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="4.259">from Texas Al Green with us now I&amp;#39;m some</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="4.049">good to have you back good to be back</text>
  <text start="308.159" dur="2.97">with you mister Cavuto thank you for</text>
  <text start="309.659" dur="6.031">having me well I have you back because</text>
  <text start="311.129" dur="8.181">you keep calling me mister good old</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="8.279">buddy old pal I mean all right whatever</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="6.43">let&amp;#39;s just keep going you you&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="323.969" dur="3.961">heard from a former Republican Congress</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="4.56">and it says that Republicans might rue</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="5.31">the day they resisted this when they</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="5.399">should have an open open ear to this and</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="4.079">that this this is about getting to the</text>
  <text start="335.699" dur="2.671">bottom of what the president&amp;#39;s doing and</text>
  <text start="337.319" dur="4.231">maybe nothing there but it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="338.37" dur="5.639">exploring it&amp;#39;s not worth exploring none</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="7.019">of this is worth exploring there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="6.21">story here I consistently am overwhelmed</text>
  <text start="348.569" dur="4.41">with the fact that these people think</text>
  <text start="350.219" dur="6.471">that there&amp;#39;s a story here there is no</text>
  <text start="352.979" dur="8.16">story nothing happened</text>
  <text start="356.69" dur="6.969">nothing legitimately nothing nothing</text>
  <text start="361.139" dur="4.2">happened the only thing that happened is</text>
  <text start="363.659" dur="3.451">that these people know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.339" dur="9.721">being looked at with a microscope that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="10.559">what happened when he talked about the</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="6.719">current President President Trump the</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="7.5">president dispatched his unofficial</text>
  <text start="381.779" dur="7.411">Minister Plenipotentiary mr. Giuliani to</text>
  <text start="385.169" dur="5.911">Ukraine he is not a person paid by the</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="5.31">taxpayers hasn&amp;#39;t been confirmed by the</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="5.519">Senate he was there to get dirt on the</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="3.719">Biden&amp;#39;s now I&amp;#39;m gonna stop it there</text>
  <text start="396.599" dur="5.3">because I have a bunch to say about that</text>
  <text start="398.219" dur="5.42">first little section there hold on</text>
  <text start="401.899" dur="3.42">still trying to get over this cold</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="5.66">coughing okay</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="8.52">so first of all let&amp;#39;s talk about this I</text>
  <text start="409.299" dur="5.98">have a comparison that if I were Kabuto</text>
  <text start="413.839" dur="5.4">I would have made I would have said well</text>
  <text start="415.279" dur="7.26">sir well mr. green you know we could</text>
  <text start="419.239" dur="7.26">make that argument about about Sidney</text>
  <text start="422.539" dur="5.46">Blumenthal Obama blatantly rejected him</text>
  <text start="426.499" dur="3.54">from the State Department and Hillary</text>
  <text start="427.999" dur="4.2">Clinton had no problem sending him all</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="6.511">over the country dealing in Libya etc</text>
  <text start="432.199" dur="6.21">and sending dirt about all kinds of</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="3.599">things to her personal private email</text>
  <text start="438.409" dur="9.33">server that she was using while against</text>
  <text start="440.149" dur="8.45">the law just saying here we go let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.739" dur="4.41">keep going</text>
  <text start="448.599" dur="6.07">and at the time he was there the</text>
  <text start="452.149" dur="8.28">president was withholding hundreds of</text>
  <text start="454.669" dur="10.191">millions the current president President</text>
  <text start="460.429" dur="7.44">Trump the president dispatched his</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="7.959">unofficial Minister Plenipotentiary mr.</text>
  <text start="467.869" dur="6.69">Giuliani to Ukraine he is not a person</text>
  <text start="472.819" dur="4.291">paid by the taxpayers hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="474.559" dur="5.88">confirmed by the Senate he was there to</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="5.879">get dirt on the Biden&amp;#39;s and at the time</text>
  <text start="480.439" dur="5.13">he was there the president was</text>
  <text start="482.989" dur="6.54">withholding hundreds of millions of</text>
  <text start="485.569" dur="5.88">dollars in funds the Ukraine needed to</text>
  <text start="489.529" dur="6.78">fend off the Russians</text>
  <text start="491.449" dur="8.76">that&amp;#39;s impeachable that&amp;#39;s a lie that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="496.309" dur="7.14">lie Rudy Giuliani wasn&amp;#39;t there Rudy</text>
  <text start="500.209" dur="6.21">Giuliani wasn&amp;#39;t there he wasn&amp;#39;t there</text>
  <text start="503.449" dur="7.32">during that time period either it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="506.419" dur="7.35">a flat-out lie like Cavuto in a second</text>
  <text start="510.769" dur="5.04">he&amp;#39;ll push back and he&amp;#39;ll say you know</text>
  <text start="513.769" dur="3.36">to be fair we don&amp;#39;t really have proof of</text>
  <text start="515.809" dur="5.01">that you know blah blah blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="517.129" dur="6.33">and he goes well I really well what what</text>
  <text start="520.819" dur="5.851">a shock I actually do have proof right</text>
  <text start="523.459" dur="6.031">here in my lap like and then he pulls</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="4.46">out these transcripts of these calls</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="4.74">that were released the other day</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="5.32">yesterday that are cherry</text>
  <text start="534.23" dur="4.95">and I&amp;#39;m going to show you the parallels</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="4.98">between what they did here and what they</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="5.01">did during the Muller during the setup</text>
  <text start="541.43" dur="5.07">for a Trump you know when they tried to</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="3.81">entrap him into some sort of collusion</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="3.93">so they would be able to use it later</text>
  <text start="548" dur="7.14">and it never worked how they tried to do</text>
  <text start="550.43" dur="6.36">that with his campaign as well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="555.14" dur="6.24">know that for sure to be fair</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="7.32">congressman so we can&amp;#39;t you know well</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="4.77">well I do I do have evidence of it in my</text>
  <text start="564.11" dur="7.44">hand or if I may share it with directly</text>
  <text start="566.15" dur="7.74">I have first the memo the July 25th</text>
  <text start="571.55" dur="5.37">phone memo where the president of</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="5.64">Ukraine says one of my assistants spoke</text>
  <text start="576.92" dur="9.29">with mr. Giuliani just recently this is</text>
  <text start="579.53" dur="11.4">a new memo and and what is that proof of</text>
  <text start="586.21" dur="6.7">that&amp;#39;s proof of nothing then you I hate</text>
  <text start="590.93" dur="5.55">to mention a competitor but on mr.</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="7.83">Cuomo&amp;#39;s program Chris Cuomo on Thursday</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="6.51">September 19th here&amp;#39;s what occurred mr.</text>

  <text start="602.99" dur="9.51">investigate Biden and of course mr.</text>
  <text start="605.6" dur="8.37">Giuliani said of course uh-huh and like</text>
  <text start="612.5" dur="3.42">I don&amp;#39;t understand why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="5.52">make this into something that it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="615.92" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s very clear like I was saying to my</text>

  <text start="635.36" dur="4.7">day about this he&amp;#39;s very clear about why</text>
  <text start="638.36" dur="6.59">this all happened</text>
  <text start="640.06" dur="8.23">have fun apple-picking coma have fun</text>
  <text start="644.95" dur="5.38">Giuliani was investigating in Ukraine</text>

  <text start="650.33" dur="4.62">of the dossier the black book ledger all</text>
  <text start="652.67" dur="4.8">the other malfeasance we know was coming</text>
  <text start="654.95" dur="5.88">at a ukraine as he was doing that he</text>
  <text start="657.47" dur="7.47">realized the other stuff and they all</text>
  <text start="660.83" dur="6.45">tied together plain and simple and they</text>
  <text start="664.94" dur="3.06">were doing this I have the dates he</text>
  <text start="667.28" dur="4.8">started the</text>
  <text start="668" dur="9.09">investigation on in November of 2018 and</text>
  <text start="672.08" dur="7.68">he finished it in March of 2018 the only</text>
  <text start="677.09" dur="4.59">reason why this came up now is because</text>
  <text start="679.76" dur="3.03">the Democrats brought it up with this</text>

  <text start="804.02" dur="4.01">like you know what this is pretty</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="5.76">serious based off of the complaint</text>
  <text start="808.03" dur="4.81">that&amp;#39;s what you would want to happen you</text>

  <text start="833.66" dur="4.8">clearly the hearsay was wrong</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="4.23">so the fact that these people did what</text>

  <text start="1064.12" dur="4.83">why he didn&amp;#39;t go was for no other reason</text>

  <text start="1079.81" dur="11.91">interesting stuff one of the most</text>
  <text start="1085.86" dur="7.69">interesting is this here&amp;#39;s a here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1091.72" dur="5.69">section of text messages that were</text>

  <text start="1139.84" dur="4.68">us thus my nightmare scenario bill then</text>
  <text start="1142.72" dur="3.99">says counting on you to be right about</text>
  <text start="1144.52" dur="4.86">this interview Gordon and then Gordon</text>

  <text start="1155.92" dur="4.35">as I said on the phone I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1158.29" dur="4.71">crazy to withhold security assistance</text>
  <text start="1160.27" dur="5.25">for help with the political campaign now</text>
  <text start="1163" dur="5.28">during the testimony Kurt testifies that</text>
  <text start="1165.52" dur="4.92">the reason why bill says this is because</text>
  <text start="1168.28" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s reading media reports that Schiff</text>
  <text start="1170.44" dur="4.05">is putting out there making the</text>

  <text start="1176.95" dur="4.89">investigations which is not the case at</text>
  <text start="1179.41" dur="4.26">all and as a matter of fact in regards</text>
  <text start="1181.84" dur="4.62">to Ukraine Donald Trump&amp;#39;s policy has</text>
  <text start="1183.67" dur="4.35">always been that he wanted the EU to</text>
  <text start="1186.46" dur="4.17">take up more responsibility for aid</text>
  <text start="1188.02" dur="4.29">package so this is really in keeping</text>

  <text start="1192.31" dur="4.47">always wanted as a matter of fact the</text>

  <text start="1196.78" dur="4.74">Muller up on some big pedestal leftists</text>
  <text start="1199.69" dur="3.59">you can go ahead and look in his report</text>
  <text start="1201.52" dur="5.52">where this is proof</text>
  <text start="1203.28" dur="6.28">where this is proven so the Democrats</text>

  <text start="1242.38" dur="4.05">how involved is Bill Taylor in this</text>
