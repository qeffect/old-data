  <text start="202.29" dur="5.25">really good show what I want to do is</text>
  <text start="204.599" dur="5.13">focus on a thread that I did when I was</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="4.77">in Ohio about representative Cummings</text>
  <text start="209.729" dur="4.23">before all this craziness happened we</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="4.319">were talking about what representative</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="3.84">Cummings had done to Baltimore and Scott</text>
  <text start="216.629" dur="2.82">Pressler is actually there right now</text>
  <text start="217.799" dur="5.011">cleaning up the mess interestingly</text>
  <text start="219.449" dur="7.171">enough but I was fortunate enough to</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="6.48">meet somebody who had personal</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="5.399">experience with Cummings back during the</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="4.08">IRS scandal and I&amp;#39;m gonna go over this</text>
  <text start="232.019" dur="4.161">thread that I wrote and there&amp;#39;ll be an</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="5.519">article coming up very soon but Cummings</text>
  <text start="236.18" dur="4.72">this was a big deal Cummings in is in</text>
  <text start="238.889" dur="3.69">the spotlight because of the missing</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="3.809">funds poverty-stricken neighborhoods</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="4.62">prioritizing illegal immigration over</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="4.92">his own constituents and calling Trump a</text>
  <text start="247.199" dur="7.16">racist doesn&amp;#39;t that sound familiar but I</text>
  <text start="249.629" dur="7.95">want to bring you back to 2012 in 2012</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="6.011">Cummings was accused of targeting a</text>
  <text start="257.579" dur="5.21">group that was focused on electorate</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="4.65">election integrity and voters rights</text>
  <text start="262.789" dur="4.481">basically what I&amp;#39;m about to tell you is</text>
  <text start="265.02" dur="4.049">the story of how Cummings</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="5.489">misrepresented that he was operating on</text>
  <text start="269.069" dur="6.511">behalf of a government committee when he</text>
  <text start="272.759" dur="6.211">worked in tandem with a weaponized IRS</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="7.23">to target an entity and a person and a</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="9.3">family that ran true the vote true the</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="8.4">vote was a an enormous ly effective</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="6.57">voter integrity integrity organization</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="7.019">that applied for a 501 C 3 status during</text>
  <text start="294.84" dur="8.52">when Lerner was running the IRS on</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="7.231">October 4th 2012 Cummings sent a 9 page</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="3.989">letter which was the first in a series</text>
  <text start="305.46" dur="3.9">of several letters on official</text>
  <text start="307.349" dur="4.531">stationery from the Oversight Committee</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="4.35">to catherine Engelbrecht who was the</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="6.509">founder and president of truth abou true</text>
  <text start="313.71" dur="6.329">the vote true the vote you guys can go</text>
  <text start="318.389" dur="4.981">to their website at true the vote org is</text>
  <text start="320.039" dur="5.37">a nonpartisan election election</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="4.41">integrity and voters rights organization</text>
  <text start="325.409" dur="6.121">and this letter that coming sent accused</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="6.15">them of partners partisanship voter</text>
  <text start="331.53" dur="5.49">suppression tactics basically overt</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="4.769">racism and even kind of threatened her</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="5.36">in the letter that she could be subject</text>
  <text start="338.699" dur="6.301">to criminal charges for actions that</text>
  <text start="342.38" dur="8.129">Cummings claimed were true but were</text>
  <text start="345" dur="5.509">actually unsubstantiated unproven and</text>
  <text start="350.599" dur="4.18">not right they were just incorrect</text>
  <text start="352.949" dur="5.761">noting that he had in the letter was it</text>
  <text start="354.779" dur="5.76">was anything it was basically like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="3.75">hurled a bunch of accusations based on</text>
  <text start="360.539" dur="3.18">news reports but the news reports were</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="4.56">biased does that sound familiar to</text>
  <text start="363.719" dur="5.971">everybody even back then the media was</text>
  <text start="367.02" dur="4.53">being used as kind of like a tool to do</text>
  <text start="369.69" dur="3.9">the dirty work of the left&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="3.45">course the left was very unhappy with</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="3">this organization they were filing</text>
  <text start="375" dur="6.21">reports and complaints left and rights</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="6.449">they were again very effective at voter</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="4.67">integrity which is something that every</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="7.171">single American should care about</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="5.8">regardless of party right right before</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="3.15">the presidential election is when this</text>
  <text start="391.68" dur="6.719">happened and the country is on edge</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="7.23">about illegal voting hasn&amp;#39;t gotten much</text>
  <text start="398.399" dur="4.801">better since then - believe it or not</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="4.98">so as they began true the vote began</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="4.35">effective oversight of the elections in</text>
  <text start="405.57" dur="3.99">in numerous different ways which you can</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="3.66">read about on their website it seems</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="4.59">that the people that were very dependent</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="5.49">on unfair election practices took aim at</text>
  <text start="414.15" dur="3.75">the organization they actually like I</text>
  <text start="416.7" dur="2.85">said they filled they filled out</text>
  <text start="417.9" dur="3.75">incident reports and complaints they</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="4.05">mobilized this passionate army of</text>
  <text start="421.65" dur="3.66">volunteers across the entire country and</text>
  <text start="423.6" dur="3.66">it was the effectiveness of their</text>
  <text start="425.31" dur="4.29">organization that actually caused Elijah</text>
  <text start="427.26" dur="3.75">Cummings to send this first nine page</text>
  <text start="429.6" dur="3.539">letter which we will look at right here</text>
  <text start="431.01" dur="3.6">this is I believe the first time these</text>
  <text start="433.139" dur="3.991">letters are available I spoke to</text>
  <text start="434.61" dur="4.26">Katherine and we spent a good amount of</text>
  <text start="437.13" dur="3.3">time on the phone she&amp;#39;s a wonderful</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="2.79">woman she&amp;#39;s been through hell which</text>
  <text start="440.43" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re gonna get into a little bit more</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="4.95">of in a second but this is the letter</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="5.039">that she got on committee on Oversight</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="6.51">and Government Reform stationery back in</text>
  <text start="448.979" dur="5.431">2012 and she helped me and she uploaded</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="3.72">these two scripts so that I could share</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="4.97">them with everybody the website I mean</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="5.43">the letters long it&amp;#39;s seven pages long</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="4.539">it cites numerous examples of things</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="6.69">that they say she did wrong</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="6.691">it talks about Ohio a lot and basically</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="3.42">what what true the vote does is it has a</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="2.94">bunch of chapter organizations</text>
  <text start="472.38" dur="2.909">underneath it and they provide the</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="4.679">training that then blankets out across</text>
  <text start="475.289" dur="5.371">if I&amp;#39;m understanding correctly so the</text>
  <text start="478.229" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;re not necessarily responsible for</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="3.81">the individual people doing the work but</text>
  <text start="482.97" dur="2.97">what was happening was they were going</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="3.42">out and witnessing things and then the</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="4.5">poll and the poll of people working the</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="4.83">polls were lying and saying that none of</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="5.21">it happened and not only that but</text>
  <text start="492.72" dur="5.34">Cummings representative Cummings was</text>
  <text start="495.65" dur="3.94">misrepresenting Ohio law when he wrote</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="3.57">to her in this letter and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="4.44">necessarily very important right now at</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="4.2">this moment to go over everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="3.63">inside of this letter but it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="3.24">available to you in the description box</text>
  <text start="507.66" dur="3.45">below so that you can read through it</text>
  <text start="509.07" dur="3.599">yourself and I really hope you do I know</text>
  <text start="511.11" dur="3.75">a lot of the times in these videos you</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="3.481">watch the video and then you don&amp;#39;t click</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="3.65">on the links and you don&amp;#39;t really do the</text>
  <text start="516.15" dur="5.129">follow-up but it&amp;#39;s really important here</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="4.18">to do this to really understand not to</text>
  <text start="521.279" dur="3.901">understand the story but to understand</text>
  <text start="522.69" dur="5.67">the depth of depravity that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="5.07">dealing with here so this was the</text>
  <text start="528.36" dur="3.96">beginning of the harassment of true the</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="3.01">vote which came at the hands of the</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="4">Democrats</text>
  <text start="533.26" dur="4.56">and the IRS under Obama in the letter</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="3.12">Cummings hints that true the vote could</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="5.25">face these criminal charges which was an</text>
  <text start="539.44" dur="5.22">intimidation tactic and before true the</text>
  <text start="543.07" dur="4.26">vote even received the first letter</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="5.61">Cummings goes out to the TV circuit and</text>
  <text start="547.33" dur="6.93">he starts slandering Catherine and the</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="6.44">group he does several TV interviews</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="5.01">where he says that these people are</text>
  <text start="556.71" dur="7.66">inciting hatred they&amp;#39;re unpatriotic</text>
  <text start="559.27" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re unamerican they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="4.62">stop people from being able to vote</text>
  <text start="566.05" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re trying to with you know prevent</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="4.41">people from from getting to the polls</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="4.92">all kinds of craziness that was</text>
  <text start="573.4" dur="5.22">basically slander it wasn&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.59" dur="4.89">true one of the one one of the things</text>
  <text start="578.62" dur="4.95">that struck me when I was reading the</text>
  <text start="580.48" dur="4.95">first letter is what they&amp;#39;re asking for</text>
  <text start="583.57" dur="3.93">like what the the Cummings is asking for</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="4.47">and again what we know now but she</text>
  <text start="587.5" dur="6.6">didn&amp;#39;t realize at the time is that this</text>
  <text start="589.9" dur="5.25">letter this request didn&amp;#39;t come from the</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="5.13">Committee on Oversight and Government</text>
  <text start="595.15" dur="6.57">Reform it came from him and his staff so</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="7.47">he wrote his letter using the weight of</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="7.41">a committee to bolster its intimidation</text>
  <text start="606.7" dur="6.77">like the intimidation factor so to speak</text>
  <text start="609.13" dur="7.71">but it wasn&amp;#39;t on behalf of the committee</text>

  <text start="867.84" dur="6.01">what I&amp;#39;m saying is that true to vote has</text>
  <text start="870.4" dur="5.55">consistently challenged the voting</text>
  <text start="873.85" dur="4.77">rights of legitimate voters I believe</text>
  <text start="875.95" dur="5.16">very strongly that voting is a</text>

  <text start="895.3" dur="4.8">and I think highly offensive and</text>
  <text start="897.94" dur="5.37">basically what true to vote has done is</text>
