  <text start="176.85" dur="3.24">you have any I&amp;#39;m going to go through</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="4.05">this thread because it spells it out</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="4.98">really easy in the OIG report on</text>
  <text start="183" dur="3.709">McCabe&amp;#39;s leaked to Barrett on the walls</text>
  <text start="185.07" dur="3.72">of the Wall Street Journal is an</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="4.271">astronomically damning correlation</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="5.1">between Loretta Lynch the New York field</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="6.75">office of the FBI Andrew McCabe and the</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="7.05">New York Police Department on September</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="7.89">28th now the dates here September 28th</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="6.96">of 2016 McCabe is made aware of the</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="5.82">information they found regarding hillary</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="6.53">clinton on anthony Weiner&amp;#39;s laptop in an</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="7.34">unrelated sexting case so they are</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="6.66">looking into anthony Weiner&amp;#39;s case in</text>
  <text start="218.78" dur="6.25">regards to what he did with a minor and</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="7.72">they find the insurance policy folder</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="5.519">okay so former FBI director Andrew</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="3.269">McCabe knew of thousands of emails</text>
  <text start="230.549" dur="3.151">related to the Hillary Clinton private</text>
  <text start="232.079" dur="5.401">server investigation for at least a</text>
  <text start="233.7" dur="7.849">month before Comey informed Congress the</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="7.83">New York Police Department finds this</text>
  <text start="241.549" dur="5.41">information on weiners laptop back then</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="3.39">when they&amp;#39;re investigating Anthony</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="3.511">Weiner and they give it over to the New</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="6.09">York field office of the FBI so then the</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="11.28">FBI has it and McCabe sits on this for</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="10.08">an entire month before he but there</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="5.039">begins to be this this stirring inside</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="2.91">of the police department and the field</text>
  <text start="266.789" dur="2.821">office there</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="4.44">why isn&amp;#39;t anybody doing thing anything</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="4.23">about this why isn&amp;#39;t anybody taking care</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="4.11">of this we&amp;#39;re gonna go public with this</text>
  <text start="273.84" dur="11.73">stuff nobody does what they&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="13.68">to do on October 24th of 2016 Loretta</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="7.05">Lynch takes the before we get there Eric</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="4.44">garner was a man who was selling illegal</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="5.52">cigarettes on the streets of Staten</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="6.27">Island and was killed accidentally by</text>
  <text start="298.14" dur="4.86">police when they try to subdue him after</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="3.84">he refuses to comply and it was a very</text>
  <text start="303" dur="3.15">controversial case at the time because</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="3.359">Eric garner is african-american it was</text>
  <text start="306.15" dur="5.3">police brutality it was all this stuff</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="6.211">and it was a superduper charged period</text>
  <text start="311.45" dur="4.57">during during that time for the force</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="3.66">and in new york city and across the</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="5.22">country of course it was politicized</text>
  <text start="317.79" dur="5.97">it was it was a huge deal so there is</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="6.36">now a local investigation into this</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="5.4">going on at the time then internally and</text>
  <text start="327.6" dur="5.22">then there was also a federal</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="5.88">investigation going on into Eric garner</text>
  <text start="332.82" dur="4.59">the criminal investigation on Staten</text>
  <text start="335.04" dur="6.3">Island neglected to bring any charges</text>
  <text start="337.41" dur="8.13">okay though the federal investigation</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="7.35">was ongoing on October 24th of 2016</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="5.31">Loretta Lynch takes the team that was</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="5.61">looking into the officers who were in</text>
  <text start="350.85" dur="7.379">the Eric garner situation and she swaps</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.49">it out with a new team so what the</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="4.141">Justice Department review means for the</text>
  <text start="359.79" dur="5.67">Eric garner case October 26 2016 and</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="5.22">then one possibility is that federal</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="3.93">prosecutors closest to the investigation</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t believe there is enough evidence</text>
  <text start="369.39" dur="5.13">to bring charges very very important</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="5.04">sentence but are being pushed by the DOJ</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="6.08">in Washington DC to continue the</text>
  <text start="377.1" dur="9.35">investigation and bring a case forward</text>
  <text start="380.6" dur="8.47">so there&amp;#39;s a team investigating this</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="4.21">they&amp;#39;re going along there many way their</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="4.68">merry way they&amp;#39;re not finding anything</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="6.48">they can grab on to Loretta Lynch all of</text>
  <text start="393.75" dur="6.06">a sudden on the 24th of October in 2016</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="4.08">swaps out the team that was doing this</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="3.54">investigation</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="3.81">I say this is telling because as ABC</text>
  <text start="403.35" dur="3.3">hints it appears that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="405.03" dur="3.48">more aggressively for an indictment and</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="3.93">conviction of the officers who are</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="3.72">involved with this the the Staten Island</text>
  <text start="410.58" dur="3.66">criminal grand jury failed to indict in</text>
  <text start="412.23" dur="5.88">the case and then they passed it over to</text>
  <text start="414.24" dur="6.48">main justice now in this oh i G report</text>
  <text start="418.11" dur="7.5">that comes out in April of last year</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="8.25">it states that on October 26th remember</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="5.16">the date October 26th so on October 24th</text>
  <text start="428.97" dur="6.17">she switches out the team on October</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="7.29">26th McCabe and the ADI C of the FBI</text>
