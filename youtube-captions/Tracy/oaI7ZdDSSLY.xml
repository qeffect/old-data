  <text start="199.099" dur="5.771">appointing a special counsel that you</text>
  <text start="202.139" dur="4.22">sent to us but my concern is we sent you</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="5.339">a letter three-and-a-half months ago</text>
  <text start="206.359" dur="5.681">asking for a second special counsel</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="3.511">what&amp;#39;s it going to take to actually get</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="5.52">a special counsel it would take a</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.669">factual basis that meets the standards</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="4.59">of the appointment of a special is that</text>
  <text start="219.389" dur="5.581">is that analysis going on right now or</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="4.649">that&amp;#39;s in the manual of the apartment of</text>

  <text start="239.819" dur="3.331">know good 3540 seconds of the two</text>
  <text start="241.889" dur="2.521">minutes or five minutes or whatever</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="6.419">amount of time I think it was five</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="6.81">minutes that Jim Jordan had we will use</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="4.23">the proper standards and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="4.71">only thing I can tell you mr. Jordan</text>
  <text start="253.799" dur="4.74">well I appreciate you can have your idea</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="4.619">but sometimes we have to study you see</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="4.291">how he&amp;#39;s running out the clock but the</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="5.581">facts are and to evaluate whether it</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="4.2">meets the standard well said and Jim</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="2.4">Jordans like I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="5.64">very much time and you just won&amp;#39;t shut</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="5.64">up but is that done by design council</text>
  <text start="272.67" dur="2.969">well we know one fact we know the</text>
  <text start="274.17" dur="4.29">Clinton campaign the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="275.639" dur="5.311">Committee paid for through the law firm</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="5.37">paid for the dossier we know that</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="5.61">happened and it sure looks like the FBI</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="5.49">was paying the author of that document</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="4.56">and it sure looks like a major political</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="3.72">party was working with the federal</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="3.6">government to them turn an opposition</text>

  <text start="303.33" dur="3.66">what it looks like and I&amp;#39;m asking you</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="3.12">doesn&amp;#39;t that warrant in addition to all</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="4.59">the things we know about James Comey in</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="5.01">2016 doesn&amp;#39;t that warrant naming a</text>
