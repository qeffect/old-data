  <text start="0.29" dur="7.239">hey guys I have literally five minutes</text>
  <text start="6" dur="4.4">to do this</text>
  <text start="7.529" dur="9">so I just wanted to do this quickly</text>
  <text start="10.4" dur="10.84">about six months ago I was sent audio by</text>
  <text start="16.529" dur="6.481">a YouTube user named Jed Clampett and he</text>
  <text start="21.24" dur="4.44">really wanted me to listen to it it was</text>
  <text start="23.01" dur="4.259">the recordings of Montgomery that I just</text>
  <text start="25.68" dur="5.37">shared with everybody that I recorded</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="7.38">six months ago six months ago when I did</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="5.31">this I spoke with him and we kind of</text>
  <text start="34.649" dur="4.32">came to the conclusion that I was going</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="5.879">to give him credit for the information</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="6.241">in the description box of my video as</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="5.611">well as a producer credit which I did so</text>
  <text start="45.21" dur="4.32">now that ivory released this again and</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="5.52">started talking about it again today Jed</text>
  <text start="49.53" dur="6.209">is back and he is concerned that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="5.31">not receiving the credit for sharing the</text>
  <text start="55.739" dur="6.181">initial audio with me this being said</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="6.299">and given that I am never one to steal</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="5.22">someone&amp;#39;s information and use it without</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="5.161">giving credit I figured that I would</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="7.68">make a video dedicated to specifically</text>
  <text start="70.14" dur="6.57">thanking Jed Clampett who is a YouTube</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="4.65">user who has a channel and he has a few</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="6.36">videos who graciously six months ago or</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="6.39">so shared with me the blix f montgomery</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="5.759">audio which you can also find on</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="5.49">soundcloud and he&amp;#39;s got a few other</text>
  <text start="88.829" dur="6.261">videos and he really wants to be</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="6.479">recognized for sharing this information</text>
  <text start="95.09" dur="4.9">he gave it to me I shared it it picked</text>
  <text start="97.829" dur="4.741">up some traction I credit him for it at</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="6.21">the time we had some conversations about</text>
  <text start="102.57" dur="5.82">it he said you know I you know it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="3.809">necessarily very important to him but</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="4.17">when I shared it again today he showed</text>
  <text start="110.009" dur="4.25">up in my comments and he wasn&amp;#39;t happy so</text>
