  <text start="503.169" dur="5.28">interest here is stunning and it - in my</text>
  <text start="506.319" dur="4.561">mind discredits the entire Senate</text>

  <text start="522.27" dur="5.62">do this investigation were listen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="3.75">just we&amp;#39;re it stinks in my opinion</text>
  <text start="527.89" dur="4.38">whether Deripaska is a good guy a bag or</text>
  <text start="529.81" dur="4.44">whatever it doesn&amp;#39;t matter the way this</text>
  <text start="532.27" dur="4.32">was done was horrible and they</text>
  <text start="534.25" dur="3.84">they actually admit that it looks</text>
  <text start="536.59" dur="3.24">horrible on the surface if it&amp;#39;s taken</text>
  <text start="538.09" dur="4.49">out of context well I don&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="539.83" dur="2.75">take it any other way</text>
  <text start="542.91" dur="4.06">sometimes things you know I don&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="755.709" dur="3.12">meets with Assange as well and comes</text>
  <text start="757.06" dur="3.6">back and that goes nowhere as far as we</text>

  <text start="767.56" dur="4.35">with Rohrbacher and is attacked less</text>
  <text start="769.329" dur="5.521">than 10 days later just an interesting</text>
  <text start="771.91" dur="5.729">tale Rohrabacher ties to Eric Prince</text>
  <text start="774.85" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s just a very very interesting story</text>

  <text start="785.56" dur="4.41">bunch of stuffs happening with that too</text>
  <text start="787.18" dur="5.7">but basically Mark Warner here who is</text>

  <text start="796.93" dur="3.34">know where they got them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="799.12" dur="2.95">interesting in it</text>
  <text start="800.27" dur="4.26">note here too that the fox news story</text>
  <text start="802.07" dur="4.8">claims that Deripaska wanted immunity to</text>
  <text start="804.53" dur="4.5">testify but the hill piece from salomon</text>
  <text start="806.87" dur="4.77">yesterday says that Deripaska never</text>
  <text start="809.03" dur="4.5">requested immunity and we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="811.64" dur="5.19">over the hill piece at the end but</text>
  <text start="813.53" dur="4.68">before we move on to Waldman I wanted to</text>
  <text start="816.83" dur="2.58">go into one thing let&amp;#39;s take a quick</text>
  <text start="818.21" dur="6.6">look at this piece that came out a</text>
  <text start="819.41" dur="7.14">couple days ago from from Warner this</text>
  <text start="824.81" dur="3.96">was two days ago or three days ago this</text>
  <text start="826.55" dur="4.23">was the 13th so three days ago Mark</text>

  <text start="839.45" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;m gonna hold off he said in an</text>
