  <text start="438.68" dur="4.019">honestly the way you&amp;#39;re saying it this</text>
  <text start="440.419" dur="18.921">is a reason why I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="442.699" dur="16.641">thought that we were I mean I</text>

  <text start="532.22" dur="5.64">why do you think his lawyers saying that</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="6.409">now because I think I have been</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="6.39">speculating about this myself I think I</text>
  <text start="541.209" dur="5.411">think this probably has some sort of</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="4.62">deal with one of these intelligence</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="4.26">agencies but after you&amp;#39;re expendable</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;re expendable that&amp;#39;s just helped</text>
  <text start="550.88" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s these people don&amp;#39;t need you you</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="3.869">could be a patriot at all you think you</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="3.87">are or help these people you think you</text>
  <text start="557.839" dur="3.391">might be helping them whether well</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;ve got one of them and the moment</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;re expendable</text>
  <text start="562.16" dur="6.96">you&amp;#39;re turned to the side and I believe</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="5.16">that the checks stopped that was</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="3.42">probably getting and his lawyer</text>
  <text start="571.22" dur="3.45">basically told him you&amp;#39;re never gonna</text>
  <text start="572.54" dur="4.14">get another job your life working with</text>
  <text start="574.67" dur="6.69">the Western governments Western</text>
  <text start="576.68" dur="6.899">intelligence unless you probably just</text>
  <text start="581.36" dur="6.229">say the truth about what you were really</text>
  <text start="583.579" dur="4.01">doing and get this</text>
  <text start="588.829" dur="4.38">and maybe that&amp;#39;s the only recourse that</text>
  <text start="591.769" dur="6.081">this guy probably has in his life right</text>
  <text start="593.209" dur="6.72">that was wife divorced him he&amp;#39;s bankrupt</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="4.63">and he&amp;#39;s living under a different</text>
  <text start="599.929" dur="3.06">identity that doesn&amp;#39;t seem that nice to</text>
  <text start="602.48" dur="3.659">me</text>
  <text start="602.989" dur="4.31">the DNC came out and basically said that</text>
  <text start="606.139" dur="3.721">he was dead</text>
  <text start="607.299" dur="4.69">do you have had this is it a hard</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="3.75">question sir do you guys have any idea</text>
  <text start="611.989" dur="4.82">why they would do that I&amp;#39;d be afraid of</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="3.199">they&amp;#39;re obviously afraid of him</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="5.98">so they were basically sort of putting</text>
  <text start="640.16" dur="4.92">you through an operation in your</text>
  <text start="642.05" dur="4.56">questioning exactly to Truckee AK to try</text>
  <text start="645.08" dur="4.49">to figure out what you knew but in</text>
  <text start="646.61" dur="2.96">attending that</text>
  <text start="658.49" dur="6.18">Russia is worth injuring me</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="4.709">because before right before when George</text>

  <text start="674.769" dur="5.381">that we&amp;#39;re not talking much about it was</text>

  <text start="709" dur="15.96">exactly this is it 90 yeah even overseas</text>
  <text start="711.97" dur="14.31">obviously okay so when you first were</text>
  <text start="724.96" dur="4.38">arrested a lot of things were</text>
  <text start="726.28" dur="4.65">interesting to me you know one of the</text>
  <text start="729.34" dur="3.81">things that really struck me is very</text>
  <text start="730.93" dur="4.05">strange maybe you can clear up is the</text>
  <text start="733.15" dur="4.65">White House our Sanders took credit for</text>
  <text start="734.98" dur="4.8">it she said in a political article and</text>
  <text start="737.8" dur="3.63">there was an article in Politico they</text>
  <text start="739.78" dur="4.14">basically said because they provided the</text>
  <text start="741.43" dur="4.47">emails they were able to tell that you</text>
  <text start="743.92" dur="4.71">weren&amp;#39;t telling the truth and I found</text>
  <text start="745.9" dur="4.35">that weird it&amp;#39;s quoted she&amp;#39;s quoted as</text>
  <text start="748.63" dur="4.89">saying that do you have any idea why</text>
  <text start="750.25" dur="5.25">they would say something like that did</text>
  <text start="753.52" dur="29.16">they not know what the depth of his</text>
  <text start="755.5" dur="28.29">story wasn&amp;#39;t I may be personally so I</text>
  <text start="782.68" dur="2.91">want to get into how you have those</text>
  <text start="783.79" dur="3.15">contacts and talk about that in a second</text>
  <text start="785.59" dur="3.18">the only other question I have about</text>
  <text start="786.94" dur="2.89">that day when you know we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="788.77" dur="11.23">the $10,000</text>
  <text start="789.83" dur="12.18">it&amp;#39;s very important and and so you it</text>
  <text start="800" dur="3.54">was very hastily done they have you</text>
  <text start="802.01" dur="3.3">waiting over and I basically while</text>
  <text start="803.54" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re trying to get a warrant and Dan</text>
  <text start="805.31" dur="4.47">bungee nose did a great job of talking</text>
  <text start="806.57" dur="5.07">about all that they wanted to use you as</text>
  <text start="809.78" dur="4.02">a cooperative witness from what the</text>
  <text start="811.64" dur="3.51">outward look like outwardly they gave</text>
  <text start="813.8" dur="3.87">you a list of people that you weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.15" dur="6.21">allowed to speak to can you share who</text>
  <text start="817.67" dur="5.4">anybody on that list was people directly</text>
  <text start="821.36" dur="6.81">and indirectly tied to Trump essentially</text>
  <text start="823.07" dur="6.3">so anyone next even like batting yeah ok</text>
  <text start="828.17" dur="2.43">so you weren&amp;#39;t allowed to talk to any of</text>
  <text start="829.37" dur="3.84">those people so one of the things that</text>
  <text start="830.6" dur="3.78">flag to me at that time was he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="833.21" dur="2.43">allowed to talk to you what connected to</text>
  <text start="834.38" dur="5.07">the campaign but they want him to</text>
  <text start="835.64" dur="5.82">cooperate with them against who if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="839.45" dur="4.71">not against Trump right because you know</text>
  <text start="841.46" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;m saying like it was interesting to me</text>
  <text start="844.16" dur="2.91">and now that&amp;#39;s listed and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="845.54" dur="6.84">allowed to talk to all those folks again</text>
  <text start="847.07" dur="8.1">yeah and like you said it was a very</text>
  <text start="852.38" dur="3.96">hastily made arrests they didn&amp;#39;t have an</text>
  <text start="855.17" dur="2.01">arrest warrant I don&amp;#39;t even know why was</text>
  <text start="856.34" dur="3.27">being arrested</text>
  <text start="857.18" dur="3.67">except I think I heard this is what</text>
  <text start="859.61" dur="4.18">happens we work for Trump</text>
  <text start="860.85" dur="5.099">and you&amp;#39;re not fully transparent or</text>
  <text start="863.79" dur="4.2">something which is very vague you know I</text>
  <text start="865.949" dur="4.351">was just like coming off a transatlantic</text>
  <text start="867.99" dur="3.42">flight was that get transmitted like to</text>
  <text start="870.3" dur="3.779">the place where they were booking you</text>

  <text start="874.079" dur="5.7">tell right away that I was there for for</text>
  <text start="876.779" dur="6.901">trauma because I worked for they want to</text>
  <text start="879.779" dur="5.821">make somebody pay that&amp;#39;s what it was I</text>
  <text start="883.68" dur="5.37">think I said it earlier and I&amp;#39;ll say it</text>
  <text start="885.6" dur="5.46">again during my entire course of my</text>
  <text start="889.05" dur="4.2">interviews with Mahler and these people</text>
  <text start="891.06" dur="3.779">I thought that I was being persecuted or</text>
  <text start="893.25" dur="3.269">prosecuted because I was helping</text>
  <text start="894.839" dur="3.631">troubled women not because I did</text>
  <text start="896.519" dur="3.331">anything illegal against my country and</text>
  <text start="898.47" dur="2.609">because I mean I like I said I was</text>
  <text start="899.85" dur="3.63">hearing things about the Loken that</text>
  <text start="901.079" dur="4.26">violation want to be one of the</text>
  <text start="903.48" dur="6.779">prosecutors for me you know but the</text>
  <text start="905.339" dur="9.18">Logan Act violation I mean so it was</text>
  <text start="910.259" dur="5.7">just a bizarre sequence of events I</text>
  <text start="914.519" dur="3.031">never really understood what they were</text>
  <text start="915.959" dur="3.69">trying to get on they considered MIPS it</text>
  <text start="917.55" dur="4.62">was working for at least the whole time</text>
  <text start="919.649" dur="4.86">I never understood that at all it was</text>
  <text start="922.17" dur="5.43">like and then I I had to lawyers who</text>
  <text start="924.509" dur="5.83">hated Trump oh well here here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="927.6" dur="5.81">here&amp;#39;s something that I&amp;#39;ve never shared</text>
  <text start="930.339" dur="5.891">because people ask why did you plead</text>
  <text start="933.41" dur="5.82">so I had a great lawyer lined up for me</text>
  <text start="936.23" dur="7.4">in Washington DC guy named John Smith</text>
  <text start="939.23" dur="4.4">and she worked for him</text>
  <text start="951.37" dur="15.65">any question I would ask</text>
  <text start="979.3" dur="13.56">is that I was yeah that&amp;#39;s it to say that</text>
  <text start="990.519" dur="3.811">they would start poking around there so</text>
  <text start="992.86" dur="3.26">today say you couldn&amp;#39;t use that attorney</text>
  <text start="994.33" dur="4.74">because of a conflict yes so basically</text>
  <text start="996.12" dur="4.6">you know I had just spent you know a lot</text>
  <text start="999.07" dur="3.99">of money on the summer vacation with her</text>
  <text start="1000.72" dur="3.809">and that was I had a job offer actually</text>
  <text start="1003.06" dur="4.62">the one of the major news channels here</text>
  <text start="1004.529" dur="5.071">in this country the day after I was</text>

  <text start="1101.029" dur="6.09">why so what how quickly did you have to</text>
  <text start="1105.409" dur="3.9">pick an attorney then how did you find</text>
  <text start="1107.119" dur="13.081">him well he was like an old as hurting</text>

  <text start="1122.09" dur="6.089">criminal case this entire thing</text>
  <text start="1123.859" dur="8.49">political and I&amp;#39;m stuck with two lawyers</text>
  <text start="1128.179" dur="9.291">from Chicago who hate Trump tell me that</text>
  <text start="1132.349" dur="7.38">basic way or Hillary fans Hillary donors</text>
  <text start="1137.47" dur="5.319">and the last thing they probably wanted</text>
  <text start="1139.729" dur="5.611">to do was instigate Muller and his</text>
  <text start="1142.789" dur="4.651">investigation and wanted to basically</text>
  <text start="1145.34" dur="3.179">use me any way possible as an instrument</text>
  <text start="1147.44" dur="3.39">to hurt Trump</text>
  <text start="1148.519" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s what I think happened because we</text>
  <text start="1150.83" dur="5.309">jumped so quick into negotiations with</text>
  <text start="1153.649" dur="5.041">them and I didn&amp;#39;t want them I never</text>
  <text start="1156.139" dur="3.96">wanted to plead I never wanted complete</text>
  <text start="1158.69" dur="3.569">because I never felt I did anything</text>
  <text start="1160.099" dur="5.731">wrong especially with the lighting stuff</text>
  <text start="1162.259" dur="5.36">but then as I stated earlier about my</text>
  <text start="1165.83" dur="4.86">contacts with Israel in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1167.619" dur="4.75">then during my last session with these</text>
  <text start="1170.69" dur="3.179">people they tell me you don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1172.369" dur="4.081">guilty to lying we&amp;#39;re gonna charge you</text>
  <text start="1173.869" dur="5.28">with activism Israeli agent I said in</text>
  <text start="1176.45" dur="3.899">Israeli agent what does that even mean</text>
  <text start="1179.149" dur="3.45">yeah I think you&amp;#39;re thinking in your</text>
  <text start="1180.349" dur="2.79">mind that if I don&amp;#39;t know what that</text>
  <text start="1182.599" dur="2.731">means</text>
  <text start="1183.139" dur="3.691">what could a jury think that means and</text>
  <text start="1185.33" dur="1.85">what could the government present it as</text>
  <text start="1186.83" dur="2.36">and</text>
  <text start="1187.18" dur="3.45">what would they even so I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="1189.19" dur="2.67">myself first of all I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1190.63" dur="4.32">confidence in these attributes to the</text>
  <text start="1191.86" dur="4.71">beginning yeah secondly the last thing I</text>
  <text start="1194.95" dur="4.8">would want to do is go to trial with</text>
  <text start="1196.57" dur="7.02">these people who know nothing about fara</text>
  <text start="1199.75" dur="8.34">issues and my work and what I was up to</text>
  <text start="1203.59" dur="6.18">and actually attacking Muller and they</text>

  <text start="1330.1" dur="3.39">time that I joined that Institute there</text>
  <text start="1332.11" dur="2.97">were three things going on in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1333.49" dur="3.45">East and we&amp;#39;re kind of under the radar</text>
  <text start="1335.08" dur="4.979">and somewhere over the above the radar</text>
  <text start="1336.94" dur="4.589">the Arab Spring get the collapse of</text>
  <text start="1340.059" dur="3.661">relations between Israel and Turkey</text>
  <text start="1341.529" dur="5.25">we had energy discovered off Israel and</text>
  <text start="1343.72" dur="5.459">Cyprus okay so people were like whoa</text>
  <text start="1346.779" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s a lot going on in just one year</text>
  <text start="1349.179" dur="3.811">and Obama had in the State Department</text>
  <text start="1351.549" dur="3.091">had their vision for the Middle East I</text>
  <text start="1352.99" dur="4.62">mean support the Muslim Brotherhood yeah</text>
  <text start="1354.64" dur="5.789">in Egypt in Turkey and basically make</text>
  <text start="1357.61" dur="4.949">Israel then to Turkey as the leader of</text>
  <text start="1360.429" dur="5.461">the Muslim Brotherhood and that all this</text>
  <text start="1362.559" dur="5.461">energy should transit turkey into Europe</text>
  <text start="1365.89" dur="4.2">so that turkeys essentially the kingpin</text>
  <text start="1368.02" dur="3.75">in that part of the world obviously it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1370.09" dur="2.819">something that I didn&amp;#39;t agree with and</text>
  <text start="1371.77" dur="3.06">my colleagues at the Hudson Institute</text>
  <text start="1372.909" dur="3.931">didn&amp;#39;t agree with and they started to</text>
  <text start="1374.83" dur="4.11">ask me so what alternatives should we</text>
  <text start="1376.84" dur="3.839">look into so what I just stated was the</text>
  <text start="1378.94" dur="3.27">Obama State Department vision and this</text>
  <text start="1380.679" dur="4.651">is why I got in trouble with these</text>
  <text start="1382.21" dur="5.37">people I events I have contacts in</text>
  <text start="1385.33" dur="3.37">Greece I have contacts in Cyprus they</text>

  <text start="1391.43" dur="3.57">me bring these three countries together</text>
  <text start="1392.51" dur="3.9">for the first time ever and the guys at</text>
  <text start="1395" dur="3.6">the Hudson and since who basically said</text>
  <text start="1396.41" dur="4.11">hey if you could you think you could do</text>
  <text start="1398.6" dur="4.74">with us see what you&amp;#39;re up to and they</text>
  <text start="1400.52" dur="6.57">allowed me to bring these governments</text>
  <text start="1403.34" dur="5.7">together to hold secret symposiums we</text>
  <text start="1407.09" dur="3.66">wrote articles we helped briefings on</text>
  <text start="1409.04" dur="3.93">Capitol Hill conferences about San</text>
  <text start="1410.75" dur="3.36">Institute about why there should be like</text>
  <text start="1412.97" dur="3.63">basically a new order in the</text>
  <text start="1414.11" dur="4.65">Mediterranean that would isolate the</text>
  <text start="1416.6" dur="5.37">Obama administration agenda it sounds</text>
  <text start="1418.76" dur="6.39">crazy but this is actually that so so</text>
  <text start="1421.97" dur="5.22">what was going on from 2011 and 2015 was</text>
  <text start="1425.15" dur="3.75">I was working the same goal and the</text>
  <text start="1427.19" dur="4.35">Prime Minister&amp;#39;s the defense ministers</text>
  <text start="1428.9" dur="6.24">and ministers of energy of Greece Israel</text>
  <text start="1431.54" dur="6.63">Egypt Cyprus Turkey we&amp;#39;re all listening</text>
  <text start="1435.14" dur="4.41">to what we were doing because they they</text>
  <text start="1438.17" dur="2.91">didn&amp;#39;t agree with the Obama</text>
  <text start="1439.55" dur="3.57">administration but they thought what we</text>
  <text start="1441.08" dur="5.37">were talking about was worth realistic</text>
  <text start="1443.12" dur="5.85">and actually the the report that we</text>
  <text start="1446.45" dur="5.34">finally published in 2015 that was</text>
  <text start="1448.97" dur="5.07">briefed on Capitol Hill if you read it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1451.79" dur="5.16">52 pages and you look at the situation</text>
  <text start="1454.04" dur="6.87">today in the Mediterranean if it&amp;#39;s 100%</text>
  <text start="1456.95" dur="5.89">implemented it&amp;#39;s incredible so I loved</text>
  <text start="1460.91" dur="3.999">Hudson Institute in 2005</text>
  <text start="1462.84" dur="4.98">after that major accomplishments</text>
  <text start="1464.909" dur="4.321">basically being like one of the first</text>
  <text start="1467.82" dur="3.929">thing basis with all these leaders and</text>
  <text start="1469.23" dur="4.35">because of that work how did you build</text>
  <text start="1471.749" dur="4.621">those connections so quickly you know</text>
  <text start="1473.58" dur="4.559">when did you start working like 2019 I</text>
  <text start="1476.37" dur="8.309">mean you know what I mean how did you</text>
  <text start="1478.139" dur="10.62">manage to do that it&amp;#39;s amazing no but</text>
  <text start="1484.679" dur="4.921">really sometimes you know it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1488.759" dur="6.331">estimate</text>
  <text start="1489.6" dur="8.519">so that was one semi joking someone to</text>
  <text start="1495.09" dur="6.209">I&amp;#39;m bringing a unique perspective that</text>
  <text start="1498.119" dur="6.091">no one in Washington can do because no</text>
  <text start="1501.299" dur="5.641">one has particular language skills I had</text>
  <text start="1504.21" dur="7.039">that particular context for other</text>
  <text start="1506.94" dur="7.05">reasons and trust by these governments</text>
  <text start="1511.249" dur="6.15">so I&amp;#39;ll explain so in that part of the</text>
  <text start="1513.99" dur="3.409">world Trust is everything</text>
  <text start="1518" dur="7.23">I look like not just doing Israeli side</text>
  <text start="1523.46" dur="4.41">which is really Egyptian side with</text>
  <text start="1525.23" dur="4.319">Egyptian you do not that multinational</text>
  <text start="1527.87" dur="4.049">yeah the Turks thought I looked Turkish</text>
  <text start="1529.549" dur="4.291">I mean so it was like okay he&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="1531.919" dur="5.281">us he&amp;#39;s not American but he is America</text>
  <text start="1533.84" dur="5.52">is it for us so it was like I was</text>
  <text start="1537.2" dur="6.03">balancing both worlds</text>
  <text start="1539.36" dur="6.199">and so when I would go there to Israel</text>

  <text start="1550.279" dur="4.681">was my parents are from Greece they felt</text>
  <text start="1553.19" dur="4.5">that they would rather trust me than the</text>
