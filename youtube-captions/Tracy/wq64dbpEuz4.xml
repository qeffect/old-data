  <text start="269.41" dur="7.55">other material she says here has</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="6.62">explained more fully in the accompanying</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="7.6">accompanying brief it&amp;#39;s the government&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="284.56" dur="8.9">guilt or to punishment irrespective of</text>
  <text start="290.79" dur="5.11">the prosecution&amp;#39;s good or bad faith and</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="4.92">because they&amp;#39;re supposed to pursue</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="4.799">justice not just convictions its</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="4.3">responsibility to produce Brady material</text>
  <text start="300.699" dur="4.561">is a grave one and she goes over what</text>
  <text start="302.68" dur="4.2">exactly it means indeed the court</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="3.62">entered an initial standing order to</text>
  <text start="306.88" dur="5.039">produce Brady material on December 12</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="5.2">2017 and then updated the order to</text>
  <text start="311.919" dur="6.541">produce that material On February 16</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="6.149">2018 making it clear to the government</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="4.86">its duty to produce exculpate ori</text>
  <text start="320.229" dur="6">evidence exists independently of mr.</text>
  <text start="323.32" dur="6.3">Flynn&amp;#39;s guilty plea so even though he</text>
  <text start="326.229" dur="5.671">pled guilty the judge is saying it</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="3.96">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if there&amp;#39;s evidence that</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="5.73">exonerates him the government must</text>
  <text start="333.58" dur="7.35">provide it yet</text>
  <text start="337.63" dur="5.55">listen to this this blew my mind when</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="3.75">the undersigned knew counsel for mr.</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="3.239">Flynn requested a detailed list of</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="4.59">outstanding Brady material immediately</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="4.68">upon taking over from prior counsel mr.</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="4.68">Van grack who is the attorney from</text>
  <text start="351.099" dur="5.6">yesterday glibly responded a few weeks</text>
  <text start="353.95" dur="5.07">later on June 26th writing the following</text>
  <text start="356.699" dur="4.421">the government has exceeded its</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="3.78">discovery and disclosure obligations in</text>
  <text start="361.12" dur="4.169">this matter including those imposed</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="5.04">pursuant to Brady vs. Maryland and the</text>
  <text start="365.289" dur="4.831">courts standing order dated February 16</text>
  <text start="367.84" dur="4.59">2018 additionally in the plea agreement</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="5.579">that your client signed on November 30th</text>
  <text start="372.43" dur="5.25">2017 your client waived the right to any</text>
  <text start="375.699" dur="4.411">further discovery or disclosures of</text>
  <text start="377.68" dur="4.169">information as such the government does</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="4.52">not anticipate providing additional</text>
  <text start="381.849" dur="7.981">information in response to your letter</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="9.25">what basically go pound sand we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="6.329">giving you anything and Sidney Powell</text>
  <text start="393.88" dur="4.92">basically goes on to talk about how she</text>
  <text start="396.159" dur="4.681">asked again on July 12th and Vondrak</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="4.71">again refused the request</text>
  <text start="400.84" dur="4.95">again suggesting that mr. Flynn&amp;#39;s plea</text>
  <text start="403.51" dur="4.02">and did the prosecutors Brady obligation</text>
  <text start="405.79" dur="4.47">while also touting the government</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="6.449">supposedly extensive production but</text>
  <text start="410.26" dur="7.5">Powell&amp;#39;s saying there was no extensive</text>
  <text start="413.979" dur="8.281">production here they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="6.81">here that assertions that mr. Flynn was</text>
  <text start="422.26" dur="4.34">an undisclosed agent of Russia or agents</text>
  <text start="424.57" dur="4.8">of Turkey</text>
  <text start="426.6" dur="7.24">that&amp;#39;s what wait I skipped a sentence ah</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="7.109">sorry guys oh here it is in fact just</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="4.71">last week van Gregg produced an</text>
  <text start="436.479" dur="3.991">additional 330 pages that included</text>
  <text start="438.55" dur="3.51">information that any reasonable attorney</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="3.24">would understand his Brady evidence in</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="3.66">light of the special counsels</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="4.14">investigation and assertions that Flynn</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="5.04">was an agent of Turkey or Russia so in</text>
  <text start="447.85" dur="5.22">other words again they provided a bucket</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="4.26">of 330 pages of material to Sidney</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="4.62">Powell and Flynn&amp;#39;s defense team and</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="5.82">there was excope Ettore information</text>
  <text start="457.69" dur="5.699">inside of there but the government said</text>
  <text start="460.84" dur="4.199">there was none which is now compelling</text>
  <text start="463.389" dur="6.481">Sidney Powell to say over and over again</text>
  <text start="465.039" dur="7.35">they don&amp;#39;t even know what is exculpatory</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="4.56">so how are we going to trust them to</text>
  <text start="472.389" dur="4.321">make the decision if they handed us over</text>
  <text start="474.43" dur="6.35">exculpatory information and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="4.07">even realize it I hope that makes sense</text>
  <text start="482.25" dur="3.669">to everybody that&amp;#39;s talking to me in the</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="3.48">chat right now saying thank you</text>
  <text start="485.919" dur="3.331">thank you guys and I&amp;#39;m glad that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="4.41">here</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="5.669">you rock all of you rock so that</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="3.6">production that they provided the 330</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="3.631">pages where they said there was no</text>
  <text start="496" dur="5.88">exploring information also showed that</text>
  <text start="498.55" dur="4.86">Flynn passed his polygraph tests in 2016</text>
  <text start="501.88" dur="3.509">and they renewed his security clearance</text>
  <text start="503.41" dur="4.319">and this is what I found interesting</text>
  <text start="505.389" dur="4.321">here this was at the same time that the</text>
  <text start="507.729" dur="4.081">FBI seems to have been investigating him</text>
  <text start="509.71" dur="4.59">under the pretext he was an agent of</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="5.43">Russia or Turkey and the new production</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="5.25">showed that James clapper refused to</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="4.53">assist in the investigation for mr.</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="4.32">Flynn&amp;#39;s security clearance which Flynn</text>
  <text start="521.77" dur="7.68">received after a full investigation</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="8.01">despite his actions so James clapper</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="4.98">said I&amp;#39;m not investigating this man for</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="4.47">a clearance I&amp;#39;m stepping away</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="8.01">and they did it without him and he still</text>
  <text start="536.35" dur="7.92">got it she says yet again in the status</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="3.57">report filed today the prosecutors exude</text>
  <text start="544.27" dur="3.87">arrogance and their flight denials of</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="6.72">request for clearance and the production</text>
  <text start="548.14" dur="6.54">of material that it says this is what</text>
  <text start="552.73" dur="6.979">they&amp;#39;re asking this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.68" dur="5.029">asking for one hold on a second</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="5.619">mmm-hmm didn&amp;#39;t want to subject you to</text>
