  <text start="2.73" dur="7.43">20th 2018 at 1251 p.m. Eastern Standard</text>
  <text start="6.779" dur="6.27">Time I&amp;#39;m going to be going through the</text>
  <text start="10.16" dur="4.57">testimony in the permanent Select</text>
  <text start="13.049" dur="4.081">Committee on Intelligence for the House</text>
  <text start="14.73" dur="4.65">of Representatives and they have</text>
  <text start="17.13" dur="4.26">released glenn simpson&amp;#39;s testimony in</text>
  <text start="19.38" dur="4.26">case you&amp;#39;ve missed it on my channel I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="21.39" dur="4.92">done a part one and a part two of glenn</text>
  <text start="23.64" dur="5.04">simpson&amp;#39;s testimony in the senate and i</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="5.309">have also broken down the dossier and</text>
  <text start="28.68" dur="5.039">used it in an expose against itself I</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="3.361">will place the links to those videos in</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="4.34">the description box below</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="5.37">they were quite entertaining</text>
  <text start="38.059" dur="4.391">now given that I have that background</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="5.1">let me just let you know that the Senate</text>
  <text start="42.45" dur="7.53">Intelligence the Senate hearing was done</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="8.129">back in August and this one happened in</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="5.45">November of 2017 so a lot more had come</text>
  <text start="53.579" dur="5.191">out into the public sphere at that point</text>
  <text start="55.43" dur="6.519">whereas in the Senate committee the</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="5.1">testimony was very very mundane and very</text>
  <text start="61.949" dur="5.28">broad and not very detailed but we were</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="6.06">able to you know extract a number of</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="6.261">different kind of tangents and talking</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="7.11">points and all kinds of nonsense from it</text>
  <text start="73.49" dur="5.8">in this one we get a lot more meat and</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="5.67">potatoes about what Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="5.07">actually is trying to convince people is</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="3.87">happening with him in Russia and all</text>
  <text start="84.36" dur="3.689">kinds of business things that contradict</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="5.34">themselves and to be quite honest with</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="5.161">you the names he throws out that the</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="3.269">things that he throws out in this</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="4.32">testimony it&amp;#39;s worth a look at because</text>
  <text start="95.189" dur="4.951">you know their connections that he says</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="5.46">are actually there and it would be worth</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="5.61">a look to see what&amp;#39;s real and what&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="4.35">I will tell you again 3% of what comes</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="5.07">out of this man&amp;#39;s mouth is anything</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="5.55">other than speculation and a spin he</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="3.869">claims consistently and over and over</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="4.799">that he is not a partisan but I will</text>
  <text start="114.689" dur="5.07">prove to use significant significant</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="3.841">reasons why he is a partisan hack as</text>
  <text start="119.759" dur="3.93">much as he wants to tell everybody that</text>
  <text start="121.53" dur="5.25">he&amp;#39;s not and he&amp;#39;s impartial and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="123.689" dur="7.44">biased and not the case so let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="7.1">get started into this on page 9 they go</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="5.421">through all their mumbo jumbo in here</text>
  <text start="133.88" dur="6.78">it&amp;#39;s there are some redactions and</text>
  <text start="136.55" dur="5.76">things of that nature and it&amp;#39;s not easy</text>
  <text start="140.66" dur="3.51">to flip two pages so you&amp;#39;ll have to bear</text>
  <text start="142.31" dur="3.21">with me as I do this I&amp;#39;ve also made it</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="4.8">very big for you so hopefully you can</text>
  <text start="145.52" dur="5.31">read it along with me so on page 9 gaudy</text>
  <text start="148.97" dur="4.41">is actually questioning Simpson and he</text>
  <text start="150.83" dur="5.49">asked about fair and balanced and</text>
  <text start="153.38" dur="6.3">Simpson goes into a non-partisan sort of</text>
  <text start="156.32" dur="6.18">schtick but on page 219 of the Senate</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="5.49">testimony he states how surprised he was</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="7.709">about the results of the election so on</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="6.87">page 219 here you know Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="3.481">says so after the election obviously we</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="3.15">were as surprised as everyone else and</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="2.76">Chris and I were concerned about the</text>
  <text start="175.19" dur="3.63">United States and blah blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="176.45" dur="3.81">blah who was surprised about the results</text>
  <text start="178.82" dur="4.05">of the election and I talked about this</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.68">before everybody but people that were on</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="4.95">Team Trump everybody but Trump voters</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="4.38">everybody but you know certain people in</text>
  <text start="187.82" dur="3.63">the media that knew that the polls were</text>
  <text start="189.32" dur="4.91">non sense the only people who were quote</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="3.99">surprised were the Democrats</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="4.09">establishment</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="5.07">you know hacks not people just the</text>
  <text start="198.32" dur="5.16">people in power the people the elitist</text>
  <text start="200.51" dur="5.28">leftist craziness that deck Clemson</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="3.92">Senate Glenn Simpson is a part of they</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="5.13">were the ones who were surprised</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="5.17">everyone else who&amp;#39;s everyone not us I</text>
  <text start="210.92" dur="4.11">wasn&amp;#39;t surprised about it</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="7.98">so who is he talking about he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="7.53">partisan so Glenn Simpson says we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="220.55" dur="4.469">only had a very small number of</text>
  <text start="222.56" dur="3.54">political clients and remember that he</text>
  <text start="225.019" dur="3.391">says they&amp;#39;ve only had a very small</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="5.13">number of political clients so I can</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="5.85">tell you I mean our methodology doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="5.19">really change we my firm is all the</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="3.96">principles are former journalists so we</text>
  <text start="236.42" dur="4.129">don&amp;#39;t come out of the political combat</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="4.799">industry we come out of the you know</text>
  <text start="240.549" dur="4.211">journalism industry which is all about</text>
  <text start="243.019" dur="3.841">sort of sticking to the facts and not</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="4.05">leaping to conclusions and not trying to</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="5.64">you know come up with a hit piece on</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="5.91">anybody so generally speaking you know</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="3.87">what we get compensated for is producing</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="4.47">reliable treatments of whatever the</text>
  <text start="256.37" dur="4.919">subject is and I should add I mean it</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="3.599">doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t help us or our</text>
  <text start="261.289" dur="4.081">clients if we only look for negative</text>
  <text start="262.789" dur="3.841">information what the clients want is all</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="3.15">the information and</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="3.96">you know someone if you&amp;#39;re in a campaign</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="3.69">and the you know other side is a</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="3.66">businessman and if you&amp;#39;re reviewing his</text>
  <text start="272.21" dur="3.78">career it&amp;#39;s important information</text>
  <text start="274.25" dur="3.27">whether he&amp;#39;s a good businessman or bad</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="3.06">businessman and you don&amp;#39;t want your</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="2.91">client trying to make an issue of his</text>
  <text start="279.05" dur="3.06">business career if he&amp;#39;s a brilliant</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="6.15">businessman who knows how to make money</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="5.7">in an honest and ethical way so sticking</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="3.3">to the facts not leaping to conclusions</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="4.14">and not trying to come up with a hit</text>
  <text start="289.88" dur="3.72">piece on anybody are three things that</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="3.21">Glenn Simpson says he does but clearly</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="6.06">demonstrates otherwise throughout his</text>
  <text start="295.16" dur="7.5">own testimony and we&amp;#39;ll get there on</text>
  <text start="299.66" dur="4.56">page 10 he starts talking about facts</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="3.39">and journalism proving facts and</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="4.53">gathering and presenting in an impartial</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="4.37">manner but but we know that that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="4.98">true</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="5.29">you know he basically says factual</text>
  <text start="313.73" dur="4.14">information a lot of what we do is</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.35">gather facts and sometimes facts are for</text>
  <text start="317.87" dur="3.96">provable facts sometimes facts are</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="2.67">established facts sometimes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.83" dur="3.45">allegations</text>
  <text start="322.73" dur="4.41">factual allegations so we do all of the</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="3.9">above when you gather up lawsuit</text>
  <text start="327.14" dur="4.32">information for example you have two</text>
  <text start="329.18" dur="4.23">sides making factual allegations against</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="4.11">each other and what&amp;#39;s important is that</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="4.17">you have a reliable credible basis for</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="4.05">your information and you know it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="4.11">like journalism and that journalism is</text>
  <text start="339.62" dur="3.72">called the first draft of history where</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="3.18">essentially you&amp;#39;re gathering up</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="4.02">information and your job is not to</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="4.74">determine the truth it&amp;#39;s to gather</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="4.38">credible information and present it and</text>
  <text start="349.61" dur="3.9">to present all the possibilities all</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="4.74">there are liable information you can</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="4.89">find but you know every day in the</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="4.02">newspaper every story has two sides to</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="3.54">it and it&amp;#39;s not the reporter&amp;#39;s job to</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="3.14">figure out who&amp;#39;s telling the truth and</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="4.32">who&amp;#39;s not or who&amp;#39;s right and who&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="363.64" dur="4.12">it&amp;#39;s to be responsible and professional</text>
  <text start="366.26" dur="3.36">and gathering up all the facts and</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="3.57">allegations and presenting them in a</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="3.93">neutral way so our method is</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="6.06">journalistic and our reports are written</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="5.49">along those lines if I were to take a</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="4.11">poll of the audience at this point in</text>
  <text start="379.04" dur="4.44">time I think that 99% of you would</text>
  <text start="381.5" dur="6">disagree with what this man saying right</text>
  <text start="383.48" dur="5.61">now because it&amp;#39;s not true that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="387.5" dur="4.05">what journalism is at least in the</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="5.82">mainstream anymore and I actually would</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="4.86">kind of differ with the assessment that</text>
  <text start="394.91" dur="3.36">you gather up what you think may be</text>
  <text start="396.41" dur="3.509">facts and it&amp;#39;s not your job to kind of</text>
  <text start="398.27" dur="4.799">prove what&amp;#39;s true that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.919" dur="4.351">maybe that&amp;#39;s classic journalism but I</text>
  <text start="403.069" dur="5.63">don&amp;#39;t think that we can do that anymore</text>
  <text start="404.27" dur="6.269">in this country okay on page 12</text>
  <text start="408.699" dur="4.03">information comes out about the</text>
  <text start="410.539" dur="5.34">Washington free beacon job which was</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="4.891">stopped in 2016 so basically the</text>
  <text start="415.879" dur="5.88">Washington free beacon was the first</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="5.639">outlet to engage fusion GPS and Glenn</text>
  <text start="421.759" dur="3.24">Simpson says we can talk about that</text>
  <text start="423.259" dur="4.201">because it&amp;#39;s out in the public but it</text>
  <text start="424.999" dur="3.901">gets very dicey when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="4.65">rest of the information which we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="6.21">to in a second what&amp;#39;s really important</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="6.66">to note here is that he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="6.299">basically about working with an outlet</text>
  <text start="438.77" dur="5.28">that stopped their retention of fusion</text>
  <text start="441.409" dur="3.81">GPS after the primaries and they they</text>
  <text start="444.05" dur="2.339">just let all the work go</text>
  <text start="445.219" dur="4.35">they didn&amp;#39;t even focus on it anymore</text>
  <text start="446.389" dur="5.43">because their engagement was over so</text>
  <text start="449.569" dur="4.141">here mr. Gowdy which is trey Gowdy says</text>
  <text start="451.819" dur="3.72">at some point did the Washington free</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="3.72">beacon stop paying you for the project</text>
  <text start="455.539" dur="4.261">into then-candidate Trump did the</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="4.079">business relationship end and Glenn</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="3.359">Simpson says I remember that we stopped</text>
  <text start="461.509" dur="5.34">doing the Trump work for beacon sometime</text>
  <text start="463.159" dur="5.16">in the spring of 2016 and then he starts</text>
  <text start="466.849" dur="3.99">to ask another question did you pick up</text>
  <text start="468.319" dur="4.231">and then they go off the record and then</text>
  <text start="470.839" dur="10.35">he says that the work stopped in April</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="11.339">or May so interesting they&amp;#39;re on page 13</text>
  <text start="481.189" dur="4.771">here he establishes that Perkins Coie</text>
  <text start="483.889" dur="3.93">hired him for the second bit of the</text>
  <text start="485.96" dur="3.419">Trump Russia stuff and they squabble</text>
  <text start="487.819" dur="3.84">back and forth a little bit about them</text>
  <text start="489.379" dur="3.991">doing work for the DNC so Simpsons</text>
  <text start="491.659" dur="3.63">basically stating in this testimony that</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="5.609">it&amp;#39;s publicly available information that</text>
  <text start="495.289" dur="7.261">the DNC retained Perkins Coie as their</text>
  <text start="498.979" dur="5.25">attorneys and Gowdy is trying to wrestle</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="3.179">out of him how he knows it but Glenn</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="3.3">Simpson is basically saying because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.729" dur="4.141">public knowledge not because they told</text>
  <text start="507.529" dur="4.5">me and they go back and forth and they</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="4.469">argue about client confidentiality and</text>
  <text start="512.029" dur="6.18">it takes up a lot of the Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.339" dur="5.82">time you know he goes into a little</text>
  <text start="518.209" dur="3.481">detail about whether he&amp;#39;s worked for</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="4.771">them in the past and he says he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="5.49">answer confidentiality requirements come</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="6.05">in blah blah blah blah blah they go back</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="6.96">and forth let&amp;#39;s talk to the lawyer let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="5.169">it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of time wasting you</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="4.17">know for some reason and I think I know</text>
  <text start="536.149" dur="4.201">why trey gowdy wants Glenn Simpson to a</text>
  <text start="538.31" dur="4.95">you know state that he knew he was</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="5.58">working for the DNC when he took up this</text>
  <text start="543.26" dur="5.82">job because Perkins Coie told them told</text>
  <text start="545.93" dur="4.25">him that they were but it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.08" dur="5.4">not going anywhere</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="9.13">page 16 they&amp;#39;re arguing back and forth</text>
  <text start="554.48" dur="7.14">on page 16 about what information Glenn</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="8.31">Simpson will be forced to give them and</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="8.01">they basically state that they basically</text>
  <text start="567.62" dur="4.23">state that you know during the Carter</text>
  <text start="569.63" dur="5.24">Page testimony which I&amp;#39;ve read and I</text>
  <text start="571.85" dur="5.34">didn&amp;#39;t do a video on the House Committee</text>
  <text start="574.87" dur="3.94">forced Carter page to give out personal</text>
  <text start="577.19" dur="3.39">email and cell phone numbers on the</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="3.66">record and Carter page was very very</text>

  <text start="602.45" dur="3.93">to be subpoenaed and Simpson is there</text>
  <text start="604.55" dur="3.36">voluntarily so that standard is</text>
  <text start="606.38" dur="3.6">different for Simpson because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="607.91" dur="7.17">have subpoena power over him it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="609.98" dur="7.56">voluntary interview and they go back and</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="10.199">forth about that a little bit also on</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="12.69">page 16 it says to start he won&amp;#39;t answer</text>
  <text start="625.279" dur="13.981">the question oh this is basically</text>
  <text start="630.23" dur="12.57">talking about how the the I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>

  <text start="747.2" dur="7.47">finally Simpson says you know finally</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="4.34">Simpson says on page 20 it&amp;#39;s harder to</text>

  <text start="768.26" dur="6.45">answer I knew it was the DNC that we</text>

  <text start="790.17" dur="5.769">I&amp;#39;m gonna read here so we began to</text>
  <text start="793.66" dur="4.859">develop more specific lines of inquiry</text>
  <text start="795.939" dur="4.231">so they would be so the things that we</text>
  <text start="798.519" dur="3.57">started looking at specifically where a</text>
  <text start="800.17" dur="4.289">lot of mr. Trump&amp;#39;s overseas business</text>
  <text start="802.089" dur="4.591">deals his history with regard to tax</text>
  <text start="804.459" dur="4.771">disputes we were interested in things</text>
  <text start="806.68" dur="5.009">like his clothing line and where his you</text>
  <text start="809.23" dur="4.349">know he I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly when</text>
  <text start="811.689" dur="3.06">this came up but we gradually figured</text>
  <text start="813.579" dur="3.51">out that while he was running on a</text>
  <text start="814.749" dur="3.96">platform of economic nationalism that</text>
  <text start="817.089" dur="3.271">he&amp;#39;s out sourced his clothing line to</text>
  <text start="818.709" dur="3.57">developing countries so we were</text>
  <text start="820.36" dur="5.88">interested in the labor practices around</text>
  <text start="822.279" dur="6.24">his factories I just wanted to make a</text>
  <text start="826.24" dur="3.81">point here because this argument has</text>
  <text start="828.519" dur="3.81">brought up been brought up several times</text>
  <text start="830.05" dur="4.529">by people that are opposed to Donald</text>
  <text start="832.329" dur="3.99">Trump etc and I think he was very</text>
  <text start="834.579" dur="3.391">transparent during the campaign about</text>
  <text start="836.319" dur="2.93">this and I think that he is you know</text>
  <text start="837.97" dur="5.19">very honest about it</text>
  <text start="839.249" dur="7.661">he did his work overseas because the the</text>
  <text start="843.16" dur="7.349">way that Obama had decimated and before</text>
  <text start="846.91" dur="6.929">him Bush even and before that Clinton</text>
  <text start="850.509" dur="7.531">had decimated the ability to do business</text>
  <text start="853.839" dur="6.841">in this country regulation tax burden</text>
  <text start="858.04" dur="4.789">etc so on and so forth it literally</text>
  <text start="860.68" dur="4.529">doesn&amp;#39;t make business sense to</text>
  <text start="862.829" dur="3.82">manufacture product in the United States</text>
  <text start="865.209" dur="3.42">back at this time when he&amp;#39;s running his</text>
  <text start="866.649" dur="3.901">businesses which is why he&amp;#39;s always been</text>
  <text start="868.629" dur="3.841">so passionate about trade deals and</text>
  <text start="870.55" dur="7.8">business regulation and taxes for</text>
  <text start="872.47" dur="7.5">corporations etc so of course a smart</text>
  <text start="878.35" dur="4.26">businessman and a lot of people might</text>
  <text start="879.97" dur="4.229">not like this but when you have people</text>
  <text start="882.61" dur="5.55">that are enemies of the country running</text>
  <text start="884.199" dur="5.58">the country it&amp;#39;s really hard to make a</text>
  <text start="888.16" dur="3.599">profit and stay in business when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="889.779" dur="3.331">trying to do things in America because</text>
  <text start="891.759" dur="3.27">you can get them for half as much</text>
  <text start="893.11" dur="3.029">elsewhere so you can&amp;#39;t make money</text>
  <text start="895.029" dur="2.761">because you can&amp;#39;t stay competitive</text>
  <text start="896.139" dur="3.961">because everyone else is doing their</text>
  <text start="897.79" dur="3.479">stuff out in other countries so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="900.1" dur="3.27">the reason why he went to other</text>
  <text start="901.269" dur="4.26">countries he&amp;#39;s running on a platform of</text>
  <text start="903.37" dur="6.6">economic nationalism if you want to call</text>
  <text start="905.529" dur="6.56">it that but given the state of the way</text>
  <text start="909.97" dur="6.869">the economy was and what he was running</text>
  <text start="912.089" dur="6.97">against he&amp;#39;s trying to you know you know</text>
  <text start="916.839" dur="3.511">what I&amp;#39;m saying like this is just a</text>
  <text start="919.059" dur="2.221">stupid argument and I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="920.35" dur="5.75">take a minute to talk about</text>
  <text start="921.28" dur="8.76">it&amp;#39;s always bothered me on page 22</text>
  <text start="926.1" dur="6.52">mr. Simpson tells tells miss trey gowdy</text>
  <text start="930.04" dur="4.68">i don&amp;#39;t remember being given a specific</text>
  <text start="932.62" dur="4.02">expense budget but the fees were fifty</text>
  <text start="934.72" dur="3.54">thousand a month so the perkins coie is</text>
  <text start="936.64" dur="5.31">paying them fifty thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="938.26" dur="6.84">month plus expenses to do the work into</text>

  <text start="945.1" dur="6.21">it far the scope of that work is is is</text>
  <text start="948.01" dur="5.49">far outside the bounds of just the</text>
  <text start="951.31" dur="3.21">dossier you know simpson&amp;#39;s doing his</text>
  <text start="953.5" dur="2.79">work on its own he&amp;#39;s got other</text>
  <text start="954.52" dur="5.51">subcontractors coming in and looking</text>
  <text start="956.29" dur="7.35">into other things and he&amp;#39;s got steel</text>
  <text start="960.03" dur="6.42">doing the dossier because he brought in</text>
  <text start="963.64" dur="5.58">steel when he exhausted all of his</text>
  <text start="966.45" dur="4">avenues from the public sphere from</text>
  <text start="969.22" dur="12.24">publicly available open-source</text>
  <text start="970.45" dur="18.84">information pages 24 to 25 steel says in</text>
  <text start="981.46" dur="9.75">here that he&amp;#39;s made a number of trips to</text>
  <text start="989.29" dur="6">Russia but he&amp;#39;s never done a business</text>
  <text start="991.21" dur="7.05">deal there and that was mysterious so he</text>
  <text start="995.29" dur="4.74">says and then you know we were also and</text>
  <text start="998.26" dur="3.63">we also increasingly saw that mr.</text>
  <text start="1000.03" dur="4.2">Trump&amp;#39;s business career had evolved over</text>
  <text start="1001.89" dur="4.59">the prior decade into a lots of projects</text>
  <text start="1004.23" dur="4.17">and overseas places particularly in the</text>
  <text start="1006.48" dur="3.87">former Soviet Union that were very</text>
  <text start="1008.4" dur="4.2">opaque and that he had made a number of</text>
  <text start="1010.35" dur="4.55">trips to Russia but said he&amp;#39;d never done</text>
  <text start="1012.6" dur="7.44">a business deal there and I found that</text>
  <text start="1014.9" dur="7.24">mysterious really a number of trips that</text>
  <text start="1020.04" dur="4.909">actually ends up by Simpsons testimony</text>
  <text start="1022.14" dur="6">to be four or five and he finds it very</text>
  <text start="1024.949" dur="4.99">mysterious and so I had the perfect</text>
  <text start="1028.14" dur="3.54">person to go see if they could figure</text>
  <text start="1029.939" dur="3.781">out what was going on there and so</text>
  <text start="1031.68" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s how I decided to ask risk if he</text>
  <text start="1033.72" dur="4.349">could look into it for me and I had the</text>
  <text start="1036.24" dur="3.63">initial engagement with Chris was much</text>
  <text start="1038.069" dur="2.821">like we do I didn&amp;#39;t hire him for a</text>

  <text start="1040.89" dur="4.5">I said take 30 days 20 or 30 days and</text>
  <text start="1043.949" dur="3.061">we&amp;#39;ll pay you a set amount of money and</text>
  <text start="1045.39" dur="3.33">see if you can figure out what Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1047.01" dur="3.81">been up to over there because he&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="1048.72" dur="4.02">over a bunch of times he said some weird</text>
  <text start="1050.82" dur="3.12">things about Putin but he doesn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="1052.74" dur="5.819">to have gotten any business</text>
  <text start="1053.94" dur="7.17">deels so nobody you know if I travel to</text>

  <text start="1061.11" dur="5.159">come back with a business deal should I</text>

  <text start="1083.07" dur="2.479">I doubt it</text>
  <text start="1086.639" dur="7.471">pages 24 to 25 basically what we get out</text>
  <text start="1091.049" dur="4.771">of this is that you know Simpson says</text>
  <text start="1094.11" dur="3.059">that Trump made a number of trips to</text>
  <text start="1095.82" dur="2.93">Russia but had never done a business</text>

  <text start="1104.429" dur="6.09">expense Perkins Coie for the money for</text>
  <text start="1106.649" dur="5.28">steel so he basically says I think we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1110.519" dur="5.25">told the committee from the bank records</text>
  <text start="1111.929" dur="5.34">that was around 160,000 and the initial</text>
  <text start="1115.769" dur="3.39">engagement was for twenty or thirty</text>
  <text start="1117.269" dur="3.87">thousand and then there&amp;#39;s currency</text>
  <text start="1119.159" dur="8.071">differences so if you do the math on</text>
  <text start="1121.139" dur="10.561">that figure they were retained for eight</text>

  <text start="1189.35" dur="6.51">into a whole big thing about how he you</text>
  <text start="1193.97" dur="3.089">know he&amp;#39;s been exposed as a former</text>
  <text start="1195.86" dur="2.97">undercover bridge and British</text>
  <text start="1197.059" dur="5.701">intelligence officer so it wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1198.83" dur="6.87">been smart for him to go there on page</text>
  <text start="1202.76" dur="6.81">27 here that we&amp;#39;re going over Glenn</text>
  <text start="1205.7" dur="6.42">Simpson didn&amp;#39;t know who Christopher</text>
  <text start="1209.57" dur="7.26">Steele&amp;#39;s sources were and did not</text>
  <text start="1212.12" dur="7.08">corroborate the sources he says</text>
  <text start="1216.83" dur="3.42">basically Glenn Simpson does public</text>
  <text start="1219.2" dur="3.089">records and we don&amp;#39;t do much</text>
  <text start="1220.25" dur="4.14">interviewing but he&amp;#39;s familiar with how</text>
  <text start="1222.289" dur="3.811">steel does his work and generally you</text>
  <text start="1224.39" dur="3.029">have a network of sources who come in</text>
  <text start="1226.1" dur="3.78">from the place that you&amp;#39;re interested in</text>
  <text start="1227.419" dur="4.531">and trey Gowdy says were you able to vet</text>
  <text start="1229.88" dur="4.89">or corroborate or contradict any of the</text>
  <text start="1231.95" dur="4.08">sources or sub sources and Simpson says</text>
  <text start="1234.77" dur="2.7">we did get into assessing the</text>
  <text start="1236.03" dur="3.3">credibility of the sources and whether</text>
  <text start="1237.47" dur="4.35">they were in a position to know things</text>
  <text start="1239.33" dur="4.469">that they were saying I didn&amp;#39;t ask for</text>
  <text start="1241.82" dur="4.229">specific identities of specific people</text>
  <text start="1243.799" dur="4.441">some people I think I know who they are</text>
  <text start="1246.049" dur="7.321">for other reasons but that is that&amp;#39;s as</text>
  <text start="1248.24" dur="7.2">much as I can say we did a lot of when</text>
  <text start="1253.37" dur="3.78">the first reports come in we did a lot</text>
  <text start="1255.44" dur="4.29">of discussing whether this was credible</text>
  <text start="1257.15" dur="3.99">information and obviously evaluating</text>
  <text start="1259.73" dur="3.36">human intelligence it&amp;#39;s not the same</text>
  <text start="1261.14" dur="3.99">thing as looking at documents and so</text>
  <text start="1263.09" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s a much trickier process process and</text>
  <text start="1265.13" dur="4.56">the thresholds are different and so what</text>
  <text start="1267.38" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re really trying to do is kind of</text>
  <text start="1269.69" dur="3.63">like interviewing and journalism is</text>
  <text start="1271.49" dur="3.36">figure out whether there&amp;#39;s a reason to</text>
  <text start="1273.32" dur="3.469">think that&amp;#39;s what that what&amp;#39;s being said</text>
  <text start="1274.85" dur="4.29">is credible and so we did a lot of that</text>
  <text start="1276.789" dur="4.27">can you give me an example of anything</text>
  <text start="1279.14" dur="4.32">that he produced that you found to be</text>
  <text start="1281.059" dur="5.551">not credible no I don&amp;#39;t think anything</text>
  <text start="1283.46" dur="5.969">comes to mind I think I trust I mean I</text>
  <text start="1286.61" dur="5.1">try I must say my original reaction to</text>
  <text start="1289.429" dur="3.361">this was to suspend judgment I was not</text>
  <text start="1291.71" dur="3.03">particularly interest</text>
  <text start="1292.79" dur="4.05">some of the things that he&amp;#39;d found that</text>
  <text start="1294.74" dur="3.39">are among the most controversial because</text>
  <text start="1296.84" dur="4.85">I didn&amp;#39;t think they were useful or</text>
  <text start="1298.13" dur="3.56">important for what I was trying to do</text>
  <text start="1302.14" dur="7.12">and he basically says he found</text>
  <text start="1305.66" dur="6.09">everything to be credible right and he</text>
  <text start="1309.26" dur="4.32">says that the first memo and you know</text>
  <text start="1311.75" dur="4.38">that the the salacious part of it in</text>
  <text start="1313.58" dur="4.62">quotes that they found that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1316.13" dur="3.62">really concerning to him but remember</text>
  <text start="1318.2" dur="5.52">and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into this again that</text>
  <text start="1319.75" dur="7.57">was the basis of Steele going to the FBI</text>
  <text start="1323.72" dur="5.19">that was it that was what Steele said</text>
  <text start="1327.32" dur="9.18">was so concerning he needed to go to the</text>
  <text start="1328.91" dur="23.04">FBI now we&amp;#39;re gonna go down to pages 33</text>
  <text start="1336.5" dur="17.07">and 34 and Schiff asks can you tell us</text>
  <text start="1351.95" dur="3.18">what publications your work appeared</text>
  <text start="1353.57" dur="4.17">with in in terms of the work you were</text>
  <text start="1355.13" dur="4.11">doing for the free beacon and Simpson</text>
  <text start="1357.74" dur="4.8">says I would struggle to come up with a</text>
  <text start="1359.24" dur="5.37">list right now I&amp;#39;m that was you know a</text>
  <text start="1362.54" dur="3.87">good while ago I think we probably had</text>
  <text start="1364.61" dur="4.23">inquiries from you know all the networks</text>
  <text start="1366.41" dur="4.2">and most of the major papers and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1368.84" dur="7.68">have a specific recollection of who</text>
  <text start="1370.61" dur="8.76">published what Schiff says did your work</text>
  <text start="1376.52" dur="5.04">product appear on Fox News Simpson I</text>
  <text start="1379.37" dur="6">honestly don&amp;#39;t know Schiff says and how</text>
  <text start="1381.56" dur="5.49">about bright Bart Simpson again I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1385.37" dur="4.5">sorry to say I just I don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="1387.05" dur="4.23">recollection and Schiff says now you</text>
  <text start="1389.87" dur="2.67">don&amp;#39;t have a recollection because there</text>
  <text start="1391.28" dur="3.63">might be other people at the firm who</text>
  <text start="1392.54" dur="5.46">would be providing that information or</text>
  <text start="1394.91" dur="5.52">it would be it would be you but you just</text>
  <text start="1398" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t recall Simpson says it would be a</text>
  <text start="1400.43" dur="3.75">little bit of both I mean those aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1402.74" dur="3.57">my go-to news sources</text>
  <text start="1404.18" dur="3.75">I don&amp;#39;t really spend a lot of time you</text>
  <text start="1406.31" dur="3.57">know I don&amp;#39;t read breitbart every day</text>
  <text start="1407.93" dur="7.17">and I certainly don&amp;#39;t watch Fox every</text>
  <text start="1409.88" dur="7.62">day really well I mean you&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="1415.1" dur="5.01">to be so unbiased and all your consuming</text>
  <text start="1417.5" dur="6.63">is liberal left media huh</text>
  <text start="1420.11" dur="6.28">that&amp;#39;s interesting that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="1424.13" dur="4.06">so Schiff is asking about what new</text>
  <text start="1426.39" dur="3.93">sources the first apple research appears</text>
  <text start="1428.19" dur="4.26">in and Schiff asks about Fox and</text>
  <text start="1430.32" dur="4.26">Breitbart and Simpson says it would be a</text>
  <text start="1432.45" dur="4.83">little of both all the talk about being</text>
  <text start="1434.58" dur="4.35">nonpartisan and he is clearly partisan</text>
  <text start="1437.28" dur="3.78">and you can make the argument he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1438.93" dur="4.77">saying he&amp;#39;s nonpartisan in his work but</text>
  <text start="1441.06" dur="6.24">we all know that it is especially for</text>
  <text start="1443.7" dur="6.42">someone with such an agenda as we now</text>
  <text start="1447.3" dur="4.59">know he had and so many connections to</text>
  <text start="1450.12" dur="5.37">so many people in so many places that</text>
  <text start="1451.89" dur="5.04">are really in deep crap right now it</text>
  <text start="1455.49" dur="3.84">would be really hard to believe that he</text>
  <text start="1456.93" dur="14.49">could be unbiased in his research really</text>
  <text start="1459.33" dur="13.74">hard so on page 38 Schiff is asking</text>
  <text start="1471.42" dur="3.06">about evidence that Trump&amp;#39;s engaging</text>
  <text start="1473.07" dur="5.61">with Russians and money-laundering</text>
  <text start="1474.48" dur="7.05">through real estate and he says did you</text>
  <text start="1478.68" dur="6.24">find evidence of that with respect to</text>
  <text start="1481.53" dur="5.67">mr. Trump and because Simpson says</text>
  <text start="1484.92" dur="4.38">evidence I think is a strong word I</text>
  <text start="1487.2" dur="4.02">think we saw patterns of buying and</text>
  <text start="1489.3" dur="4.85">selling that we thought were suggestive</text>
  <text start="1491.22" dur="2.93">of money laundering</text>
  <text start="1499.79" dur="4.18">so I shudder to think what they would</text>
  <text start="1502.38" dur="4.44">have found if they took three minutes to</text>
  <text start="1503.97" dur="4.29">look into just the Clinton Foundation he</text>
  <text start="1506.82" dur="3.03">states that there was a Russian gangster</text>
  <text start="1508.26" dur="3.48">living in Trump Tower and he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1509.85" dur="5.91">remember his name but that was a huge</text>
  <text start="1511.74" dur="7.35">concern so I couldn&amp;#39;t spell his name but</text>
  <text start="1515.76" dur="4.95">he was living in Trump Tower and he was</text>
  <text start="1519.09" dur="3.96">running a high-stakes gambling ring out</text>
  <text start="1520.71" dur="4.47">of Trump Tower you know who else ran</text>
  <text start="1523.05" dur="5.61">lives in to Trump Tower there are so</text>
  <text start="1525.18" dur="5.1">many people that live in Trump Tower and</text>
  <text start="1528.66" dur="4.01">this is where we get into with with</text>
  <text start="1530.28" dur="4.44">Schiff specifically he&amp;#39;s looking for</text>
  <text start="1532.67" dur="4.54">Simpson to tell him where he</text>
  <text start="1534.72" dur="4.62">investigated and what kind of shady ties</text>
  <text start="1537.21" dur="5.21">and all kinds of stuff and you know all</text>
  <text start="1539.34" dur="7.89">of this is very loose very very loose</text>
  <text start="1542.42" dur="6.73">stuff he says that there&amp;#39;s fraud and</text>
  <text start="1547.23" dur="3.57">that Russians may or may not have put</text>
  <text start="1549.15" dur="6.42">money into some of these business deals</text>
  <text start="1550.8" dur="6.07">and you know he doesn&amp;#39;t know he says may</text>
  <text start="1555.57" dur="3.04">or may not and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1556.87" dur="11.34">any sense I got to find it it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1558.61" dur="10.86">hard to use this PDF here we go he says</text>
  <text start="1568.21" dur="2.82">well I mean some of the things that we</text>
  <text start="1569.47" dur="3.6">have looked at we thought were very</text>
  <text start="1571.03" dur="3.9">concerning our existing investments in</text>
  <text start="1573.07" dur="4.62">projects and specifically a project in</text>
  <text start="1574.93" dur="4.35">Panama the one in Toronto these both got</text>
  <text start="1577.69" dur="4.02">a lot of fraud associated with them a</text>
  <text start="1579.28" dur="4.2">lot of fraud allegations a lot of</text>
  <text start="1581.71" dur="3.99">activity that I would say smacks of</text>
  <text start="1583.48" dur="4.41">fraud and a lot of Russian mafia figures</text>
  <text start="1585.7" dur="5.85">listed as buyers who may or may not have</text>
  <text start="1587.89" dur="3.96">actually put money into it so which is</text>
  <text start="1591.55" dur="4.29">it</text>
  <text start="1591.85" dur="5.49">which is it did they or didn&amp;#39;t they and</text>
  <text start="1595.84" dur="2.67">what he&amp;#39;s trying to argue here is that</text>
  <text start="1597.34" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s like a way to do money</text>
  <text start="1598.51" dur="4.29">laundering apparently where if you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1600.61" dur="4.38">get a business loan you have people say</text>
  <text start="1602.8" dur="3.99">okay I&amp;#39;m buying you know thirty five</text>
  <text start="1604.99" dur="3.45">thousand units in this condo building</text>
  <text start="1606.79" dur="3.54">and that&amp;#39;s what you use as the basis for</text>
  <text start="1608.44" dur="3.989">your loan that the condos are already</text>
  <text start="1610.33" dur="4.05">sold and then you know you get the money</text>
  <text start="1612.429" dur="3.451">to build it and then the people decide</text>
  <text start="1614.38" dur="3.72">that they&amp;#39;re not going to build them or</text>
  <text start="1615.88" dur="4.14">they are or buy them or they are and</text>
  <text start="1618.1" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s illegal not to buy them once you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1620.02" dur="4.05">promised to buy them so I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="1622.059" dur="3.331">excuse me oh sorry about that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1624.07" dur="6.81">really sure what he&amp;#39;s getting out there</text>
  <text start="1625.39" dur="8.49">I&amp;#39;m really not and then on page 45 he</text>
  <text start="1630.88" dur="5.549">basically says that day found a picture</text>
  <text start="1633.88" dur="4.98">of him with sergej million and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1636.429" dur="5.311">why they started looking into you know</text>
  <text start="1638.86" dur="4.199">sergej million and Donald Trump you know</text>
  <text start="1641.74" dur="2.49">there&amp;#39;s pictures of Donald Trump with</text>
  <text start="1643.059" dur="4.081">Hillary Clinton are you going to</text>
  <text start="1644.23" dur="4.47">investigate Hillary Clinton too and then</text>
  <text start="1647.14" dur="4.71">they start going into how Michael Cohen</text>
  <text start="1648.7" dur="5.91">is attached to Hillary Clinton I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="1651.85" dur="4.23">attached to Sarge a million etc so on</text>
  <text start="1654.61" dur="6.48">and so forth</text>
  <text start="1656.08" dur="6.599">and they found that million was attached</text>
  <text start="1661.09" dur="3.63">to Cohen through social media like</text>
  <text start="1662.679" dur="5.731">Facebook and Twitter Facebook and</text>
  <text start="1664.72" dur="6.51">Twitter on pages 50 and 51 it gets</text>
  <text start="1668.41" dur="5.01">really like irritating for me because</text>
  <text start="1671.23" dur="3.84">Schiff says you mentioned the</text>
  <text start="1673.42" dur="3.45">limitations on your ability to follow</text>

  <text start="1924.37" dur="8.76">page 59 did you inform the media Simpson</text>
  <text start="1929.89" dur="6.75">doesn&amp;#39;t remember which outlets but he</text>
  <text start="1933.13" dur="6.17">assumed Clinton would win did you inform</text>

  <text start="1939.3" dur="6.49">anything specific I ok did you stir echt</text>
  <text start="1944.05" dur="4.31">steel to brief the media outlets and</text>
  <text start="1945.79" dur="4.73">Simpson says yeah we did it together</text>
  <text start="1948.36" dur="5.2">initially the reason was that we were</text>
  <text start="1950.52" dur="5.05">everyone assumed that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1953.56" dur="3.72">was going to win the election and when</text>
  <text start="1955.57" dur="7.32">we initially briefed the media that was</text>

  <text start="1967.08" dur="8.16">everyone assumed everyone page 62</text>
  <text start="1981.49" dur="4.3">so Chris went and this is Simpson</text>
  <text start="1984.08" dur="4.17">talking so current Chris went and</text>
  <text start="1985.79" dur="4.23">reported this to the bureau and he came</text>
  <text start="1988.25" dur="3.42">back and he said I reported this to the</text>
  <text start="1990.02" dur="3.54">bureau and we did not ask permission</text>
  <text start="1991.67" dur="4.86">from the clients to do that the client</text>
  <text start="1993.56" dur="5.4">didn&amp;#39;t instruct us to do that it was he</text>
  <text start="1996.53" dur="3.93">was you know it was viewed as reporting</text>
  <text start="1998.96" dur="7.53">a crime in progress</text>
  <text start="2000.46" dur="9.18">sort of a citizenship obligation but the</text>
  <text start="2006.49" dur="7.65">problem is that Steele is not a citizen</text>
  <text start="2009.64" dur="7.5">and Glenn Simpson didn&amp;#39;t find it</text>
  <text start="2014.14" dur="11.19">necessary to report that salacious part</text>
  <text start="2017.14" dur="10.26">of the dossier to the FBI and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2025.33" dur="3.78">understand how a citizenship obligation</text>
  <text start="2027.4" dur="10.53">comes into it when Steele didn&amp;#39;t even do</text>
  <text start="2029.11" dur="16.59">it mr. Rooney says something really</text>
  <text start="2037.93" dur="11.13">funny right after here I just want to go</text>
  <text start="2045.7" dur="4.949">back he says I have a note here to say</text>
  <text start="2049.06" dur="3.75">remember Simpson didn&amp;#39;t think it was</text>
  <text start="2050.649" dur="4.411">necessary to brief the FBI because he</text>
  <text start="2052.81" dur="5.22">couldn&amp;#39;t verify and said he didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2055.06" dur="5.099">how to verify and Steele isn&amp;#39;t a citizen</text>
  <text start="2058.03" dur="4.68">he also asserts that the russians hacked</text>
  <text start="2060.159" dur="4.891">the emails with no proof yeah he does</text>
  <text start="2062.71" dur="4.32">this a lot you know at a point later on</text>
  <text start="2065.05" dur="4.05">you know I think that as the questions</text>
  <text start="2067.03" dur="3.69">I&amp;#39;m not sure how to say this as the</text>
  <text start="2069.1" dur="3.809">hacked attacks by the Russians on the</text>
  <text start="2070.72" dur="4.439">Democrats became a major issue in late</text>
  <text start="2072.909" dur="5.941">later in the year questions of whether</text>
  <text start="2075.159" dur="9.601">to engage the FBI you know became more</text>
  <text start="2078.85" dur="8.309">of a general issue oh no proof mr.</text>
  <text start="2084.76" dur="4.32">Rooney says my times up but I will say</text>
  <text start="2087.159" dur="4.171">that I think that the Russian scores in</text>
  <text start="2089.08" dur="4.74">that salt lake Olympics were pretty low</text>
  <text start="2091.33" dur="4.589">very suspicious I didn&amp;#39;t get to ask you</text>
  <text start="2093.82" dur="4.02">about that but it&amp;#39;s always the Russians</text>
  <text start="2095.919" dur="4.441">like everybody else has got a 10 or a 9</text>
  <text start="2097.84" dur="4.62">and the Russians are like 5 do you see</text>
  <text start="2100.36" dur="5.96">what he&amp;#39;s doing there the Russians don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2102.46" dur="3.86">do well let&amp;#39;s investigate the Russians</text>
  <text start="2109.49" dur="4.39">again Schiff says before I pass it off</text>
  <text start="2112.62" dur="3.06">you didn&amp;#39;t have a chance to answer one</text>
  <text start="2113.88" dur="4.23">of the questions I posed at the end that</text>
  <text start="2115.68" dur="4.35">is we do have the subpoena power if we</text>
  <text start="2118.11" dur="4.14">are get to get to the bottom of this</text>
  <text start="2120.03" dur="3.84">issue of whether Russian organized crime</text>
  <text start="2122.25" dur="3.12">money was used in the flipping of these</text>

  <text start="2125.37" dur="4.05">courses and this is a lever over the</text>

  <text start="2129.42" dur="5.55">use that process with to get to the</text>
  <text start="2131.91" dur="4.71">bottom of it and he goes into what do</text>
  <text start="2134.97" dur="3.6">you would do go to the banks go to the</text>
  <text start="2136.62" dur="3.99">title agencies go to the title companies</text>
  <text start="2138.57" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re basically just having you know a</text>

  <text start="2143.04" dur="9.18">you know about you know what you&amp;#39;d find</text>
  <text start="2146.67" dur="6.99">you know it&amp;#39;s a friendly little banter</text>
  <text start="2152.22" dur="8.3">back and forth between Schiff and</text>
  <text start="2153.66" dur="6.86">Simpson page 67</text>
  <text start="2170.4" dur="4.48">Quigley asks and without getting into</text>
  <text start="2173.019" dur="3.27">the exact communications when did you</text>
  <text start="2174.88" dur="2.939">start alerting your client that this</text>
  <text start="2176.289" dur="3.651">might have been a bigger deal then as</text>
  <text start="2177.819" dur="5.67">you just described it originally thought</text>
  <text start="2179.94" dur="4.839">Simpson says yeah I mean I think that I</text>
  <text start="2183.489" dur="2.971">would that would call for our</text>
  <text start="2184.779" dur="4.29">confidential client communication I</text>
  <text start="2186.46" dur="4.98">think what I can say is well let me put</text>
  <text start="2189.069" dur="4.77">it this way I think it&amp;#39;s now public that</text>
  <text start="2191.44" dur="4.619">you know the FBI had gone to the DNC</text>
  <text start="2193.839" dur="4.051">prior to this and told them you know</text>
  <text start="2196.059" dur="3.81">that they&amp;#39;d been hacked by the Russian</text>
  <text start="2197.89" dur="3.929">government and you know foreign</text>
  <text start="2199.869" dur="3.601">intelligence services hacking American</text>
  <text start="2201.819" dur="3.901">political operations is not that unusual</text>
  <text start="2203.47" dur="3.599">actually and there&amp;#39;s a lot of foreign</text>
  <text start="2205.72" dur="3.45">intelligence services that play in</text>
  <text start="2207.069" dur="4.53">American elections and so that in itself</text>
  <text start="2209.17" dur="5.25">isn&amp;#39;t actually totally alarming the</text>
  <text start="2211.599" dur="5.041">Chinese did it last time the Indians do</text>
  <text start="2214.42" dur="3.51">it but when it became when the</text>
  <text start="2216.64" dur="3.389">suggestion that they were going to</text>
  <text start="2217.93" dur="3.72">weaponize the information and that this</text>
  <text start="2220.029" dur="3.51">was more than just an Intel gathering</text>
  <text start="2221.65" dur="4.439">operation that they were actually going</text>
  <text start="2223.539" dur="6.77">to engage in active measures that was</text>
  <text start="2226.089" dur="4.22">when you know it became a major issue</text>
  <text start="2233.57" dur="4.59">how do you know that the russians hacked</text>
  <text start="2236.12" dur="4.58">the DNC servers the DNC didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2238.16" dur="4.74">allow them to look at the server&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2240.7" dur="4.75">CrowdStrike were the only company that</text>
  <text start="2242.9" dur="4.74">looked at those servers the DNC refused</text>
  <text start="2245.45" dur="4.88">to allow the FBI to look at their</text>
  <text start="2247.64" dur="6.05">servers I wonder why</text>
  <text start="2250.33" dur="5.62">maybe it&amp;#39;s because there was a leak</text>
  <text start="2253.69" dur="5.95">CrowdStrike tried to make it look like a</text>
  <text start="2255.95" dur="5.13">hack and if the FBI looked at the</text>
  <text start="2259.64" dur="2.82">servers they may have figured that out</text>
  <text start="2261.08" dur="3.39">what they would have done with that</text>
  <text start="2262.46" dur="4.89">information back then is beyond me</text>
  <text start="2264.47" dur="6.84">probably nothing good depending on who</text>
  <text start="2267.35" dur="16.32">did the looking if it was struck who</text>
  <text start="2271.31" dur="14.04">knows who knows on page 70 again he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2283.67" dur="3.15">trying to protect himself against</text>
  <text start="2285.35" dur="5.25">disinformation that came out of the</text>
  <text start="2286.82" dur="5.7">dossier by making it clear that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2290.6" dur="3.93">human intelligence and humans sometimes</text>
  <text start="2292.52" dur="6.24">lie and more frequently they just get it</text>
  <text start="2294.53" dur="5.97">wrong and then did he ever in talking to</text>
  <text start="2298.76" dur="3.06">you subsequent to the release of the</text>
  <text start="2300.5" dur="3.03">documents say that he thought he would</text>
  <text start="2301.82" dur="5.4">alter any of it after the fact or</text>
  <text start="2303.53" dur="5.82">information he had gathered later and he</text>
  <text start="2307.22" dur="4.14">says Simpson says I have talked to him</text>
  <text start="2309.35" dur="4.67">about that and he remains he continues</text>
  <text start="2311.36" dur="10.65">to believe that it is largely not</text>
  <text start="2314.02" dur="10.66">disinformation largely not again what</text>
  <text start="2322.01" dur="4.86">does largely not mean that there is some</text>

  <text start="2326.87" dur="9.09">lies that there aren&amp;#39;t lies what does it</text>
  <text start="2329.54" dur="8.61">mean what does it mean page 77 something</text>
  <text start="2335.96" dur="4.68">very interesting for me came up the</text>
  <text start="2338.15" dur="8.94">timing of this and I&amp;#39;ll go over it with</text>
  <text start="2340.64" dur="9.05">you guys now so on page 77 the question</text>
  <text start="2347.09" dur="2.6">is asked</text>
  <text start="2352.51" dur="5.17">switching gears a little bit going over</text>
  <text start="2354.71" dur="4.65">to you testified earlier that mr. Steele</text>
  <text start="2357.68" dur="4.62">went to the FBI at a certain point in</text>
  <text start="2359.36" dur="4.05">time approximately late June 2016 is</text>
  <text start="2362.3" dur="3.36">that correct</text>
  <text start="2363.41" dur="4.89">and the answer from Simpson this</text>
  <text start="2365.66" dur="4.41">transcript is horrible yeah I think what</text>
  <text start="2368.3" dur="3.87">I said was he raised the issue of going</text>
  <text start="2370.07" dur="4.11">to the FBI with me after the first memo</text>
  <text start="2372.17" dur="3.66">and I didn&amp;#39;t give him an answer or I</text>
  <text start="2374.18" dur="4.08">didn&amp;#39;t sign off on that and then he</text>
  <text start="2375.83" dur="5.19">raised it again a few days later and by</text>
  <text start="2378.26" dur="4.98">approximately like early July like the</text>
  <text start="2381.02" dur="4.32">first or the second I had given my</text>
  <text start="2383.24" dur="4.83">assent to him doing it as a professional</text>
  <text start="2385.34" dur="4.59">obligation or a citizenship obligation</text>
  <text start="2388.07" dur="8.04">and that&amp;#39;s when he did it sometimes</text>
  <text start="2389.93" dur="7.41">around the fourth of July and they kind</text>
  <text start="2396.11" dur="3.66">of firm up the time</text>
  <text start="2397.34" dur="6.6">you remember Hillary Clinton was</text>
  <text start="2399.77" dur="6.15">interviewed on July 2nd it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2403.94" dur="3.9">interesting that right after her</text>
  <text start="2405.92" dur="4.44">testimony that was not under oath with</text>
  <text start="2407.84" dur="3.78">Peter struck etc these people decide to</text>
  <text start="2410.36" dur="5.15">go to the FBI</text>
  <text start="2411.62" dur="7.29">with the information about Trump Rocha</text>
  <text start="2415.51" dur="5.23">very interesting and not even any good</text>
  <text start="2418.91" dur="5.22">information just the fact that he may</text>
  <text start="2420.74" dur="5.13">have been filmed may have been filmed</text>
  <text start="2424.13" dur="3.12">they don&amp;#39;t have any tape but he may have</text>
  <text start="2425.87" dur="4.44">been filmed doing something disgusting</text>
  <text start="2427.25" dur="3.87">in a hotel room in Russia which we know</text>
  <text start="2430.31" dur="5.37">didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="2431.12" dur="8.73">so that&amp;#39;s a really interesting timeline</text>
  <text start="2435.68" dur="6.42">point there for me and then he says that</text>
  <text start="2439.85" dur="5.4">right after the election he was</text>
  <text start="2442.1" dur="9.77">approached by Bruce or right after the</text>

  <text start="2495.809" dur="7.891">I think Thanksgiving of 2016 yes</text>
  <text start="2500.809" dur="6.25">did mr. Oher reach out to you or how did</text>
  <text start="2503.7" dur="5.75">that shake out originally I think Kris</text>
  <text start="2507.059" dur="3.571">it was someone that chrissteele knows</text>
  <text start="2509.45" dur="3.55">question</text>
  <text start="2510.63" dur="5.39">I&amp;#39;m sorry chrissteele knows who answer</text>
  <text start="2513" dur="7.799">Bruce or wife Nelly or sound familiar</text>
  <text start="2516.02" dur="6.7">question okay answer and I met Bruce too</text>
  <text start="2520.799" dur="4.191">through organized crime crime</text>
  <text start="2522.72" dur="6.03">conferences or something like that and</text>
  <text start="2524.99" dur="5.47">Chris had said he had been Chris told me</text>
  <text start="2528.75" dur="3.119">that he had been talking to Bruce that</text>
  <text start="2530.46" dur="3.149">he had told Bruce about what happened</text>
  <text start="2531.869" dur="3.361">and that Bruce wanted more information</text>
  <text start="2533.609" dur="4.141">and suggested that I speak with Bruce</text>
  <text start="2535.23" dur="7.44">the context of this is that it was after</text>
  <text start="2537.75" dur="7.53">the election a very surprising thing had</text>
  <text start="2542.67" dur="6.6">happened which is that Donald Trump had</text>
  <text start="2545.28" dur="6.24">won there was we were by that time we</text>
  <text start="2549.27" dur="4.049">were enormous ly concerned about rapidly</text>
  <text start="2551.52" dur="3.63">accumulating indications that the</text>
  <text start="2553.319" dur="4.221">Russian government had mounted a massive</text>
  <text start="2555.15" dur="5.189">attack on the American election system</text>
  <text start="2557.54" dur="6.549">and that you know Donald Trump or his</text>
  <text start="2560.339" dur="10.411">associates might have been involved what</text>
  <text start="2564.089" dur="11.76">are you talking about they never touched</text>
  <text start="2570.75" dur="6.9">the voting system clearly the dossier is</text>
  <text start="2575.849" dur="3.811">nonsense there&amp;#39;s no proof that they</text>
  <text start="2577.65" dur="3.27">hacked the election and there&amp;#39;s no proof</text>
  <text start="2579.66" dur="1.709">that Donald Trump had anything to do</text>
  <text start="2580.92" dur="3.689">with it</text>
  <text start="2581.369" dur="5.281">and there was a lot of alarming things</text>
  <text start="2584.609" dur="3.841">happening including Donald Trump saying</text>
  <text start="2586.65" dur="3.81">things about Vladimir Putin that really</text>
  <text start="2588.45" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t make any sense weren&amp;#39;t ordinary</text>
  <text start="2590.46" dur="4.47">things for a Republican to say well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2592.74" dur="8.4">not an ordinary Republican and you know</text>
  <text start="2594.93" dur="8.46">anyway I didn&amp;#39;t so we had also by this</text>
  <text start="2601.14" dur="4.89">time given information to the FBI and</text>
  <text start="2603.39" dur="4.14">they had you know told indicated to</text>
  <text start="2606.03" dur="3.48">Chris that they were investigating it</text>
  <text start="2607.53" dur="3.93">and then told apparently told the New</text>
  <text start="2609.51" dur="3.72">York Times they weren&amp;#39;t and so it was</text>
  <text start="2611.46" dur="3.48">not clear to us whether anyone at a high</text>
  <text start="2613.23" dur="3.7">level of government was aware of the</text>
  <text start="2614.94" dur="5.889">information that Chris had gathered in</text>
  <text start="2616.93" dur="6.72">to the FBI and so you know so we were</text>
  <text start="2620.829" dur="3.451">frankly you know very scared for the</text>
  <text start="2623.65" dur="3.3">country</text>
  <text start="2624.28" dur="3.96">and for ourselves and felt that if we</text>
  <text start="2626.95" dur="4.77">could give it to someone else we should</text>
  <text start="2628.24" dur="6.569">higher up oh they were petrified for the</text>
  <text start="2631.72" dur="5.76">country frankly frankly we were scared</text>
  <text start="2634.809" dur="5.01">for the country and for ourselves oh my</text>
  <text start="2637.48" dur="5.52">goodness give me a break</text>
  <text start="2639.819" dur="5.04">this is just disgusting to me and so</text>
  <text start="2643" dur="4.41">Chris suggested I give some information</text>
  <text start="2644.859" dur="4.2">to Bruce give him the background to all</text>
  <text start="2647.41" dur="5.27">this and we eventually made it met at a</text>
  <text start="2649.059" dur="3.621">coffee shop and I told him the story</text>
  <text start="2655.47" dur="19.03">mm-hmm page 82 he goes to look into his</text>
  <text start="2670.93" dur="6.929">business dealings in Russia but there</text>
  <text start="2674.5" dur="6.089">are no business dealings in Russia what</text>
  <text start="2677.859" dur="3.871">I will say he says the question is did</text>
  <text start="2680.589" dur="3.03">you tell mr. Steele what you would</text>
  <text start="2681.73" dur="4.379">affect it expected him to find the</text>
  <text start="2683.619" dur="4.261">answers no what I will say is I was</text>
  <text start="2686.109" dur="4.111">quite shocked by what he came back with</text>
  <text start="2687.88" dur="3.719">and what I the general mandate was to</text>
  <text start="2690.22" dur="3.119">look into Donald Trump&amp;#39;s business</text>
  <text start="2691.599" dur="2.821">dealings in Russia and see if he could</text>
  <text start="2693.339" dur="3.091">come up with a little bit more</text>
  <text start="2694.42" dur="3.99">information about who was doing business</text>
  <text start="2696.43" dur="3.3">over there and why you know in the</text>
  <text start="2698.41" dur="3.03">course of all these trips he never</text>
  <text start="2699.73" dur="5.72">seemed to be able to consummate a deal</text>
  <text start="2701.44" dur="4.01">so that was the general assignment</text>
  <text start="2711.9" dur="5.17">ninety-one I skipped a lot of the</text>
  <text start="2715.6" dur="12.42">Michael Cohen stuff cuz it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2717.07" dur="16.8">interest me you guys can read it so this</text>
  <text start="2728.02" dur="6.57">part is interesting we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2733.87" dur="7.23">Browder</text>
  <text start="2734.59" dur="8.13">and we&amp;#39;re talking about the we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2741.1" dur="4.65">talking about the preface in case the</text>
  <text start="2742.72" dur="8.06">imagine it&amp;#39;s jacked stuff and the</text>
  <text start="2745.75" dur="7.35">question is originally way back there</text>
  <text start="2750.78" dur="4.12">tell us about what you did with Preveza</text>
  <text start="2753.1" dur="3.9">and he goes into this big long spiel</text>
  <text start="2754.9" dur="4.44">about it Sartain he apologizes for</text>
  <text start="2757" dur="8.55">taking so long and then on page 91 he</text>
  <text start="2759.34" dur="9.69">says the lawyers asked me how to figure</text>
  <text start="2765.55" dur="5.01">out how we could subpoena him so i found</text>
  <text start="2769.03" dur="3.36">that his hedge fund was registered in</text>
  <text start="2770.56" dur="3.15">delaware and therefore he had corporate</text>
  <text start="2772.39" dur="3.75">presence in the united states which</text>
  <text start="2773.71" dur="3.75">meant that theoretically at least he can</text>
  <text start="2776.14" dur="3">be subpoenaed through his hedge fund</text>
  <text start="2777.46" dur="4.29">because he was listed as an officer in</text>
  <text start="2779.14" dur="5.58">the records so we subpoenaed the hedge</text>
  <text start="2781.75" dur="5.13">fund we then retroactively lee filed new</text>
  <text start="2784.72" dur="4.5">documentation with the CEO as he c</text>
  <text start="2786.88" dur="4.14">taking his name off the record said it</text>
  <text start="2789.22" dur="4.05">was all a mistake and he said you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2791.02" dur="4.38">subpoena me I&amp;#39;m not really an officer of</text>
  <text start="2793.27" dur="6.11">that hedge fund now why is this</text>
  <text start="2795.4" dur="6.69">important why is this important because</text>
  <text start="2799.38" dur="6.67">during the previs on case he was working</text>
  <text start="2802.09" dur="5.25">with Baker Hostetler a law firm and back</text>
  <text start="2806.05" dur="5.04">in the testimony that we went over just</text>
  <text start="2807.34" dur="4.83">recently Schiff asks well or someone I</text>
  <text start="2811.09" dur="3.09">think it was actually the menorah</text>
  <text start="2812.17" dur="3.81">majority party asked well why didn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="2814.18" dur="3.63">go after any of this stuff and he says</text>
  <text start="2815.98" dur="4.14">well because I you know I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="2817.81" dur="4.26">I don&amp;#39;t know how I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t do any</text>
  <text start="2820.12" dur="4.4">of that stuff I can&amp;#39;t subpoena but he</text>
  <text start="2822.07" dur="4.8">was saying you know he had no problem</text>
  <text start="2824.52" dur="5.71">subpoenaing now I get that there wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2826.87" dur="5.28">an active case against Trump but if this</text>
  <text start="2830.23" dur="3.66">was a vital national importance like</text>
  <text start="2832.15" dur="4.14">they want us to believe it was right and</text>
  <text start="2833.89" dur="3.6">if perkins coie is paying like hundreds</text>
  <text start="2836.29" dur="4.44">and hundreds and hundreds and millions</text>
  <text start="2837.49" dur="5.37">and millions eventually of dollars for</text>
  <text start="2840.73" dur="4.32">this thing why not start up some little</text>
  <text start="2842.86" dur="3.57">Gatien so that they can subpoena these</text>
  <text start="2845.05" dur="4.25">things the way they did in the Browder</text>
  <text start="2846.43" dur="5.76">case doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense does it</text>
  <text start="2849.3" dur="4.63">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense so he knows</text>
  <text start="2852.19" dur="5.55">exactly how to do it they just didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="2853.93" dur="5.4">it because there&amp;#39;s nothing there why is</text>
  <text start="2857.74" dur="3.51">Simpson lying about having to know how</text>
  <text start="2859.33" dur="3.78">to subpoena when he says that he</text>
  <text start="2861.25" dur="4.8">organized a subpoena service down in</text>
  <text start="2863.11" dur="6.75">here too he organizes subpoena service</text>
  <text start="2866.05" dur="4.64">he supervised dit it&amp;#39;s all lies it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2869.86" dur="8.67">lies</text>
  <text start="2870.69" dur="11.23">95 and 96 Schiff is such a little snake</text>
  <text start="2878.53" dur="4.92">I swear they talk about all the Russians</text>
  <text start="2881.92" dur="2.91">here involved in the Trump deals that</text>
  <text start="2883.45" dur="4.17">really aren&amp;#39;t illegal at all there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2884.83" dur="4.65">nothing illegal and there&amp;#39;s no basis or</text>
  <text start="2887.62" dur="4.59">facts for any of it and then he says at</text>
  <text start="2889.48" dur="5.34">the bottom of page 96 that someone said</text>
  <text start="2892.21" dur="7.46">they drank Cristal with Trump which this</text>
  <text start="2894.82" dur="4.85">is all hearsay right but the problem is</text>
  <text start="2900.3" dur="4.6">sergej million says he tells the story</text>
  <text start="2903.58" dur="3.21">about meeting donald trump at the Gulf</text>
  <text start="2904.9" dur="4.86">at a racetrack drinking a bottle of</text>
  <text start="2906.79" dur="5.91">Cristal with him he seems he gave him</text>
  <text start="2909.76" dur="5.1">some crystal and that was in the early</text>
  <text start="2912.7" dur="3.93">phases of the product so it was clear</text>
  <text start="2914.86" dur="5.52">that Donald Trump so the equity partner</text>
  <text start="2916.63" dur="5.55">was the related group if this is he gave</text>
  <text start="2920.38" dur="4.53">him a bottle of Cristal he drank with</text>
  <text start="2922.18" dur="5.25">him Donald Trump doesn&amp;#39;t drink it&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="2924.91" dur="5.34">keep hitting my foot Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="2927.43" dur="7.35">doesn&amp;#39;t drink now that that&amp;#39;s a big deal</text>
  <text start="2930.25" dur="7.88">in all this but he doesn&amp;#39;t drink so is</text>
  <text start="2934.78" dur="5.91">it possible that Sergi million was lying</text>
  <text start="2938.13" dur="5.11">exaggerating do you have any facts</text>
  <text start="2940.69" dur="4.59">whatsoever there are no facts here</text>
  <text start="2943.24" dur="3.54">literally that&amp;#39;s just hearsay I think</text>
  <text start="2945.28" dur="2.76">this person did this and I think his</text>
  <text start="2946.78" dur="3.32">name was that and I think it might be</text>
  <text start="2948.04" dur="3.5">called this and I think this is just</text>
  <text start="2950.1" dur="5.52">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="2951.54" dur="4.08">draw ridiculous</text>
  <text start="2957.13" dur="4.959">so we&amp;#39;re on page 97 we&amp;#39;re gonna go to</text>
  <text start="2960.2" dur="9.809">page 99 where they start talking about</text>
  <text start="2962.089" dur="9.51">WikiLeaks and Roger stone now we</text>
  <text start="2970.009" dur="3.631">gradually towards the end of the project</text>
  <text start="2971.599" dur="3.96">became very interested in you know Roger</text>
  <text start="2973.64" dur="3.389">stolen bragged about having his contact</text>
  <text start="2975.559" dur="3.601">we tried to figure out who the contact</text>
  <text start="2977.029" dur="3.69">was we started going into who&amp;#39;s stone</text>
  <text start="2979.16" dur="4.26">was and who was relationships for it</text>
  <text start="2980.719" dur="4.77">with and if essentially the trail led to</text>
  <text start="2983.42" dur="4.71">sort of an international far right and</text>
  <text start="2985.489" dur="4.11">you know Briggs had happened and Nigel</text>
  <text start="2988.13" dur="3.419">Farage became someone that they were</text>
  <text start="2989.599" dur="4.74">variant we were very interested in and I</text>
  <text start="2991.549" dur="4.47">think it&amp;#39;s still very interesting and so</text>
  <text start="2994.339" dur="3.331">I formed my own opinions that went</text>
  <text start="2996.019" dur="3.361">through that there was a somewhat</text>
  <text start="2997.67" dur="3.599">unacknowledged relationship between the</text>
  <text start="2999.38" dur="3.599">Trump people and the UK people and that</text>
  <text start="3001.269" dur="4.35">the path to WikiLeaks rent ran through</text>
  <text start="3002.979" dur="4.05">that so I formed my own opinions that</text>
  <text start="3005.619" dur="3.571">there was a connection between Trump and</text>
  <text start="3007.029" dur="6.78">WikiLeaks and you kept and I still think</text>
  <text start="3009.19" dur="5.97">that today well why why why why and then</text>
  <text start="3013.809" dur="3.841">they go on to talk about can bridge</text>
  <text start="3015.16" dur="4.349">analytical and brexit and Bannen and you</text>
  <text start="3017.65" dur="3.54">could in 2011 and they try to do the</text>
  <text start="3019.509" dur="4.171">anti Tea Party and blah blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="3021.19" dur="4.319">blah and Schiff says I mean were you</text>
  <text start="3023.68" dur="3.779">able to find any factual links between</text>
  <text start="3025.509" dur="4.681">the Mercer&amp;#39;s and Assange or WikiLeaks or</text>
  <text start="3027.459" dur="4.65">Faraj and Simpson says well I mean the</text>
  <text start="3030.19" dur="3.72">things that we heard which you know I</text>
  <text start="3032.109" dur="3.48">think could be sorted out by an official</text>
  <text start="3033.91" dur="3.299">inquiry are that Nigel Farraj made a</text>
  <text start="3035.589" dur="3.811">number of trips to New York and had a</text>

  <text start="3127.279" dur="5.76">I&amp;#39;m gonna read it and my last question</text>
  <text start="3130.13" dur="4.83">for you mr. Simpson is why did you go</text>
  <text start="3133.039" dur="3.24">direct to mr. Steele to go to the media</text>
  <text start="3134.96" dur="3.54">with the information and the steel</text>
  <text start="3136.279" dur="4.56">dossier and I want you guys to listen to</text>
  <text start="3138.5" dur="9.51">his answer I&amp;#39;m gonna be reading five</text>
  <text start="3140.839" dur="9.301">pages four pages here sure well so there</text>
  <text start="3148.01" dur="3.87">were two instances of this or rounds of</text>
  <text start="3150.14" dur="4.619">it and I think I was beginning to</text>
  <text start="3151.88" dur="4.889">recount this earlier in the in whatever</text>
  <text start="3154.759" dur="4.53">the first round was I assume it was</text>
  <text start="3156.769" dur="4.711">sometime in mid December or early</text>
  <text start="3159.289" dur="4.351">October it was mainly about telling the</text>
  <text start="3161.48" dur="4.77">press a few high-level members of the</text>
  <text start="3163.64" dur="4.5">national security press and the you know</text>
  <text start="3166.25" dur="3.779">top-level press that we had information</text>
  <text start="3168.14" dur="3.75">that there was a Russian intelligence</text>
  <text start="3170.029" dur="4.711">operation that the Russians were very</text>
  <text start="3171.89" dur="4.8">engaged in you know that this was more</text>
  <text start="3174.74" dur="3.569">than just hacking and there was a major</text>
  <text start="3176.69" dur="3.96">effort to interfere with the election</text>
  <text start="3178.309" dur="6.24">and that it allegedly involved the Trump</text>
  <text start="3180.65" dur="6.119">Organization and the reason for that the</text>
  <text start="3184.549" dur="4.47">motivation for that was mainly because I</text>
  <text start="3186.769" dur="3.481">thought this was a historic and that it</text>
  <text start="3189.019" dur="3.06">was something the press needed to</text>
  <text start="3190.25" dur="3.48">investigate and know about and asked the</text>
  <text start="3192.079" dur="4.47">intelligence community about because I</text>
  <text start="3193.73" dur="4.68">wanted to expose it but you know we were</text>
  <text start="3196.549" dur="3.631">operating under the assumption at the</text>
  <text start="3198.41" dur="3.54">time that Hillary Clinton was going to</text>
  <text start="3200.18" dur="4.649">win the election and so there was no</text>
  <text start="3201.95" dur="5.849">urgency to it so I&amp;#39;m just gonna stop</text>
  <text start="3204.829" dur="5.161">there so there&amp;#39;s no urgency to it if</text>
  <text start="3207.799" dur="3.51">he&amp;#39;s not gonna win there&amp;#39;s no urgency to</text>
  <text start="3209.99" dur="3.24">it if Donald Trump isn&amp;#39;t gonna win</text>
  <text start="3211.309" dur="3.121">because who cares at that point if the</text>
  <text start="3213.23" dur="3.48">Russians are interfering with the</text>
  <text start="3214.43" dur="4.409">election if your candidate is going to</text>
  <text start="3216.71" dur="4.619">win anyway why would we pay any</text>
  <text start="3218.839" dur="2.941">attention to it I mean why would we look</text>
  <text start="3221.329" dur="2.941">into</text>
  <text start="3221.78" dur="5.01">Russians interfering in our elections if</text>
  <text start="3224.27" dur="5.81">your candidate was gonna win anyway and</text>
  <text start="3226.79" dur="6.84">there was no urgency to it hmm</text>
  <text start="3230.08" dur="6.49">you are a contradictory nightmare mr.</text>
  <text start="3233.63" dur="5.28">Simpson you are nonpartisan you are</text>
  <text start="3236.57" dur="4.02">partisan you are partisan and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3238.91" dur="3.27">care about the country because if you</text>
  <text start="3240.59" dur="3.48">cared about the country you would have</text>
  <text start="3242.18" dur="3.48">been reporting this anyway if that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3244.07" dur="10.71">case of what you&amp;#39;re saying here is true</text>
  <text start="3245.66" dur="12.6">you&amp;#39;re disgusting disgusting I will</text>
  <text start="3254.78" dur="5.16">continue and there was an assumption on</text>
  <text start="3258.26" dur="4.41">my part that nothing would be published</text>
  <text start="3259.94" dur="4.77">about any of this any time likely before</text>
  <text start="3262.67" dur="3.24">the election and I wanted to tell them</text>
  <text start="3264.71" dur="4.38">about it because that&amp;#39;s when it was</text>
  <text start="3265.91" dur="5.22">happening but I didn&amp;#39;t you know it was</text>
  <text start="3269.09" dur="4.29">basically in a political campaign you</text>
  <text start="3271.13" dur="3.87">know when you get past Labor Day people</text>
  <text start="3273.38" dur="3.6">stop publishing stories that could be</text>
  <text start="3275" dur="4.74">perceived as a late hit or an October</text>
  <text start="3276.98" dur="7.38">Surprise or some kind of a stunt but</text>
  <text start="3279.74" dur="9.51">it&amp;#39;s the Russians hacking the election I</text>
  <text start="3284.36" dur="6.96">am so frustrated at this and so you know</text>
  <text start="3289.25" dur="4.29">in a presidential campaign you&amp;#39;re sort</text>
  <text start="3291.32" dur="3.84">of winding down at that point you know</text>
  <text start="3293.54" dur="3.33">all the information that you needed to</text>
  <text start="3295.16" dur="2.88">gather for debates or political ads or</text>
  <text start="3296.87" dur="5.31">anything like that it&amp;#39;s all been</text>
  <text start="3298.04" dur="6.27">gathered and so anyway so we wanted</text>
  <text start="3302.18" dur="3.99">people to know and we were also of the</text>
  <text start="3304.31" dur="3.96">view by that point we&amp;#39;d been doing the</text>
  <text start="3306.17" dur="3.42">research for two plus months we were of</text>
  <text start="3308.27" dur="3.66">the view that there was really something</text>
  <text start="3309.59" dur="3.84">here that this was really bad and there</text>
  <text start="3311.93" dur="3.57">was some serious allegations that it</text>
  <text start="3313.43" dur="4.53">wasn&amp;#39;t just Russians it was Russians</text>
  <text start="3315.5" dur="5.37">working with Americans so that was round</text>
  <text start="3317.96" dur="4.98">one then and indeed no one ran off and</text>
  <text start="3320.87" dur="4.68">wrote a big story about how Russian how</text>
  <text start="3322.94" dur="4.23">a bit British spy is thinks that you</text>
  <text start="3325.55" dur="5.52">know the Russians are working with the</text>
  <text start="3327.17" dur="6.27">Trump people there were you know a</text>
  <text start="3331.07" dur="3.78">trickle of stories you know I guess more</text>
  <text start="3333.44" dur="3.27">than a trickle but there were some very</text>
  <text start="3334.85" dur="3.48">limited stories about people associated</text>
  <text start="3336.71" dur="3.96">with Trump having connections to the</text>
  <text start="3338.33" dur="3.93">Russians and I can remember specifically</text>
  <text start="3340.67" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re being stories about Carter page</text>
  <text start="3342.26" dur="3.84">and his trip to Moscow and the fact that</text>
  <text start="3344.51" dur="3.78">that was something that was of FBI</text>
  <text start="3346.1" dur="3.57">interest and that Carter page stuff is</text>
  <text start="3348.29" dur="4.14">something that we covered with the media</text>
  <text start="3349.67" dur="4.689">but anyway so none of the media made a</text>
  <text start="3352.43" dur="3.49">dent in the sort of general cover</text>
  <text start="3354.359" dur="3.21">and it didn&amp;#39;t bother me because I was</text>
  <text start="3355.92" dur="14.75">inspecting any of it to really make a</text>
  <text start="3357.569" dur="15.361">dent what hmm come the end of October</text>
  <text start="3370.67" dur="2.74">some extraordinary things started</text>
  <text start="3372.93" dur="4.379">happening</text>
  <text start="3373.41" dur="6.75">the Russians WikiLeaks releases John</text>
  <text start="3377.309" dur="5.49">Podesta Z mails and then you know the</text>
  <text start="3380.16" dur="4.56">most extraordinary of all James Comey</text>
  <text start="3382.799" dur="3.75">sends a letter to Congress saying he is</text>
  <text start="3384.72" dur="4.049">reopening the Hillary Clinton email</text>
  <text start="3386.549" dur="4.651">investigation and that was I believe</text>
  <text start="3388.769" dur="4.411">around the 25th and you know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3391.2" dur="3.21">me you know and you have been in</text>
  <text start="3393.18" dur="2.79">politics and campaigns and</text>
  <text start="3394.41" dur="6.27">investigations and this is your whole</text>
  <text start="3395.97" dur="6.66">world and you have basically been doing</text>
  <text start="3400.68" dur="4.349">it since you got out of college you know</text>
  <text start="3402.63" dur="4.619">one of the things that you that is</text>
  <text start="3405.029" dur="4.621">really ingrained in you is the rules of</text>
  <text start="3407.249" dur="3.84">Washington and when I say rules I mean</text>
  <text start="3409.65" dur="3.119">like regulations of the Justice</text>
  <text start="3411.089" dur="5.791">Department about interfering with the</text>
  <text start="3412.769" dur="6.27">election it&amp;#39;s not I&amp;#39;m gonna go back to</text>
  <text start="3416.88" dur="3.54">this in a second it is not something</text>
  <text start="3419.039" dur="3.21">that you are just aware of as a</text>
  <text start="3420.42" dur="3.96">technical requirement it is something</text>
  <text start="3422.249" dur="3.81">that people embrace which is that law</text>
  <text start="3424.38" dur="3.54">enforcement shouldn&amp;#39;t interfere in</text>
  <text start="3426.059" dur="4.591">elections by announcing investigations</text>
  <text start="3427.92" dur="5.429">of people at the last minute and so we</text>
  <text start="3430.65" dur="5.099">were shocked and I felt I mean I guess I</text>
  <text start="3433.349" dur="4.44">was angry but in any case you know the</text>
  <text start="3435.749" dur="4.201">result of that was predictable which is</text>
  <text start="3437.789" dur="4.381">that you know it began to influence the</text>
  <text start="3439.95" dur="4.2">election and so we tried to decide how</text>
  <text start="3442.17" dur="4.199">to respond to that and when I say we I</text>
  <text start="3444.15" dur="5.189">mean like me and my little you know</text>
  <text start="3446.369" dur="4.41">company my little company and Chris and</text>
  <text start="3449.339" dur="2.791">you know I didn&amp;#39;t have any dealings with</text>
  <text start="3450.779" dur="3.54">miss Clinton or any of these other</text>
  <text start="3452.13" dur="5.1">people they were dealing with that was</text>
  <text start="3454.319" dur="5.22">their thing but I was sitting on this</text>
  <text start="3457.23" dur="3.9">piece of knowledge which was in fact the</text>
  <text start="3459.539" dur="3.841">FBI was investigating the Trump</text>
  <text start="3461.13" dur="3.57">Organization for possibly having illegal</text>
  <text start="3463.38" dur="3.54">dealings with the government of Russia</text>
  <text start="3464.7" dur="4.02">and you can imagine if you were me or</text>
  <text start="3466.92" dur="4.53">Chris teal and we&amp;#39;ve been sitting here</text>
  <text start="3468.72" dur="4.5">working blank and they seemed to be very</text>
  <text start="3471.45" dur="3.72">seriously running a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="3473.22" dur="4.2">or espionage investigation into the</text>
  <text start="3475.17" dur="3.75">Trump Organization and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="3477.42" dur="3.51">they announced they&amp;#39;re reopening the</text>
  <text start="3478.92" dur="4.859">Hillary case you know you&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="3480.93" dur="5.49">what&amp;#39;s going on here so at that point I</text>
  <text start="3483.779" dur="4.131">of course was really confused and I</text>
  <text start="3486.42" dur="3.679">would say Chris was a little scared</text>
  <text start="3487.91" dur="3.33">because he didn&amp;#39;t he thought that he</text>
  <text start="3490.099" dur="3.811">didn&amp;#39;t really understand what was going</text>
  <text start="3491.24" dur="4.17">on with the FBI in any event at that</text>
  <text start="3493.91" dur="3.24">point I felt the rules had just been</text>
  <text start="3495.41" dur="3.57">thrown out and that Comey had violated</text>
  <text start="3497.15" dur="4.619">the sort of one of the most sacrosanct</text>
  <text start="3498.98" dur="4.589">policies which is not announcing running</text>
  <text start="3501.769" dur="4.651">law-enforcement org activity into the</text>
  <text start="3503.569" dur="4.8">closing days of an election and so we</text>
  <text start="3506.42" dur="4.199">began talking to the press again about</text>
  <text start="3508.369" dur="3.301">we decided that if James Comey wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3510.619" dur="3.511">gonna tell people about this</text>
  <text start="3511.67" dur="4.5">investigation that you know he had</text>
  <text start="3514.13" dur="3.51">violated the rules and we would only be</text>
  <text start="3516.17" dur="4.79">fair if the world knew that both</text>
  <text start="3517.64" dur="9.869">candidates were under FBI investigation</text>
  <text start="3520.96" dur="11.52">holy crap I could really just stop here</text>
  <text start="3527.509" dur="4.971">I could really just stop here</text>
  <text start="3533.289" dur="5.711">he says multiple times that he barely</text>
  <text start="3537.019" dur="4.08">ever gets involved in this political</text>
  <text start="3539" dur="3.96">stuff in terms of you know political</text>
  <text start="3541.099" dur="4.41">opposition research only a couple times</text>
  <text start="3542.96" dur="4.129">every four years once in a blue he gets</text>
  <text start="3545.509" dur="5.52">involved with political you know</text>
  <text start="3547.089" dur="5.891">investigations and Doppel research but</text>
  <text start="3551.029" dur="4.201">then he says you know when this was your</text>
  <text start="3552.98" dur="4.349">whole world and this is what you do and</text>
  <text start="3555.23" dur="3.869">this is all you do you&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="3557.329" dur="3.18">politics and campaigns and this is your</text>
  <text start="3559.099" dur="3.44">whole world and you&amp;#39;ve been doing it</text>
  <text start="3560.509" dur="5.61">basically since you got out of college</text>
  <text start="3562.539" dur="7.51">the rules of Washington are ingrained in</text>
  <text start="3566.119" dur="6.5">you like regulations about the Justice</text>
  <text start="3570.049" dur="9.75">Department</text>
  <text start="3572.619" dur="9.791">it&amp;#39;s embraced so we decided my little</text>
  <text start="3579.799" dur="6.54">company and I with the backing of one of</text>
  <text start="3582.41" dur="8.28">the largest attorney law firms in on the</text>
  <text start="3586.339" dur="10.051">in the world we decide we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3590.69" dur="7.2">influence the election to if James Comey</text>
  <text start="3596.39" dur="4.709">is not gonna tell people that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3597.89" dur="6.959">investing this wasn&amp;#39;t by golly it would</text>
  <text start="3601.099" dur="6.92">only be fair if the world knew that both</text>
  <text start="3604.849" dur="8.131">candidates were under FBI investigation</text>
  <text start="3608.019" dur="8.171">so we decided to tamper and inject</text>
  <text start="3612.98" dur="6.48">ourselves and influence a presidential</text>
  <text start="3616.19" dur="5.4">election with the help of a foreign</text>

  <text start="3633.08" dur="13.89">ended it it&amp;#39;s pretty clear so this</text>
  <text start="3645.83" dur="2.88">testimony here just basically</text>
  <text start="3646.97" dur="3">demonstrates that he&amp;#39;s clearly an</text>
  <text start="3648.71" dur="4.17">operative of the Democratic Party</text>
  <text start="3649.97" dur="8.25">clearly clearly and we can read through</text>
  <text start="3652.88" dur="7.17">it but 113 is about you know what he</text>
  <text start="3658.22" dur="3.3">didn&amp;#39;t know about Podesta and Matt</text>

  <text start="3661.52" dur="4.26">a lot about what manna fort does over in</text>
  <text start="3664.04" dur="3.51">the Ukraine and in Russia but they</text>
  <text start="3665.78" dur="3.36">forget and neglect to add and they talk</text>
  <text start="3667.55" dur="4.41">about stone involved in that too but as</text>
  <text start="3669.14" dur="5.31">you know through the video that I did in</text>

  <text start="4049.239" dur="7.75">something that&amp;#39;ll probably bite them in</text>

  <text start="4086.69" dur="5.37">important okay here we go</text>
  <text start="4089.11" dur="5.23">the reason I ask this question is and</text>
  <text start="4092.06" dur="5.1">you probably have seen this there is a</text>
  <text start="4094.34" dur="5.34">conspiracy theory that the Russians bar</text>
  <text start="4097.16" dur="5.49">either through ms vessel Metz kaya or</text>
  <text start="4099.68" dur="4.889">elseways feeding you misinformation to</text>

  <text start="4109.04" dur="7.02">truth to that theory that you can see</text>
  <text start="4113.41" dur="4.54">there is no truth to that theory in my</text>
  <text start="4116.06" dur="3.63">mind I would certainly agree with the</text>
  <text start="4117.95" dur="3.48">observation that for these matters to</text>
  <text start="4119.69" dur="3.96">have intersected in the way they did is</text>
  <text start="4121.43" dur="6.48">remarkable and it caught me totally by</text>
  <text start="4123.65" dur="6.12">surprise and as best as I can figure the</text>
  <text start="4127.91" dur="8.13">Russians were up to a lot of stuff and I</text>
  <text start="4129.77" dur="8.79">only know about some of it mm-hmm so</text>
  <text start="4136.04" dur="4.23">that we were tricked by the Russians</text>
  <text start="4138.56" dur="3.63">thing that got floated around is just</text>
  <text start="4140.27" dur="4.35">debunked by Schiff and Simpson in this</text>
  <text start="4142.19" dur="4.919">testimony and that my friends is</text>

  <text start="4154.04" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s behind any of this but he had some</text>
  <text start="4156.049" dur="6.81">interesting connections and there we go</text>
  <text start="4159.38" dur="7.439">that&amp;#39;s it a bunch of nonsense and lies</text>
  <text start="4162.859" dur="5.46">and disgusting partisanship and a witch</text>
