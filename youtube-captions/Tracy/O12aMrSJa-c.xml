  <text start="109.939" dur="5.86">we&amp;#39;ve got a lot to talk about today</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="5.82">folks and Jeffrey Epstein has been a</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="4.741">topic on everybody&amp;#39;s mind obviously for</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="4.139">a very long time but outside of that he</text>
  <text start="120.54" dur="2.52">was arrested this sat in case you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="122.159" dur="3.451">been living under a rock</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="6.919">he was arrested this Saturday at</text>
  <text start="125.61" dur="7.499">Teterboro Airport upon his arrival from</text>
  <text start="129.979" dur="5.02">from Paris and he was on vacation he</text>
  <text start="133.109" dur="5.52">lands at the airport he gets arrested</text>
  <text start="134.999" dur="6.061">and numerous things have happened since</text>
  <text start="138.629" dur="4.59">then but what I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing as</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="5.239">I go through this on social media is</text>
  <text start="143.219" dur="6.091">that there&amp;#39;s not one very cohesive story</text>
  <text start="146.299" dur="5.17">of all this including the new stuff put</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="5.31">together there was a press conference</text>
  <text start="151.469" dur="7.681">today the Southern District of New York</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="5.849">did that went over the charges and</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="3.479">things like that and then they</text>
  <text start="160.469" dur="6.061">referenced twice the fact that</text>
  <text start="162.629" dur="6.2">investigative reporting done by specific</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="4.919">journalists has helped them in the case</text>
  <text start="168.829" dur="5.071">at the end of the video I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="171.449" dur="5.311">over a bunch of different sort of things</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="4.959">to watch out for things that we</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="3.78">shouldn&amp;#39;t fall into the trap of things</text>
  <text start="178.859" dur="4.83">that are curious things that are</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="4.589">disheartening in my opinion but right</text>
  <text start="183.689" dur="4.17">now what I wanted to do is stick to</text>
  <text start="185.129" dur="4.741">facts so what I did was I basically the</text>
  <text start="187.859" dur="6.66">reporting coming from the Miami Herald</text>
  <text start="189.87" dur="6.42">is really stellar and it this series of</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="4.86">reports that they did about the Epstein</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="4.8">case came out back in November of 2018</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="4.771">and the reporters on the story worked</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="5.819">the story for about a year going over</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="4.829">all kinds of all kinds of new</text>
  <text start="206.909" dur="5.16">information they examined a decade&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.979" dur="5.94">worth of court documents lawsuits</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="5.28">witness depositions newly released FBI</text>
  <text start="214.919" dur="4.981">documents and they entry in interviewed</text>
  <text start="217.349" dur="4.86">key new people who had never spoken</text>
  <text start="219.9" dur="4.14">previously about what had happened they</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="3.87">also got new records from the Palm Beach</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="4.229">police which were unredacted and then</text>
  <text start="226.079" dur="4.291">other witness statements that had been</text>
  <text start="228.269" dur="5.3">kept under seal and they put all of this</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="5.639">stuff together into this five piece</text>
  <text start="233.569" dur="5.5">manifesto so to speak about what had</text>
  <text start="236.009" dur="5.641">gone on in Florida for the most part</text>
  <text start="239.069" dur="6.301">this reporting is very politically</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="8.339">neutral there is some spin on it there</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="7.079">is some it&amp;#39;s not just straight facts but</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s really hard to find any news story</text>
  <text start="252.449" dur="5.701">anymore that doesn&amp;#39;t have some sort of</text>
  <text start="254.579" dur="7.4">and nudge this way you&amp;#39;re a poke over</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="5.04">here it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s really well done</text>
  <text start="261.979" dur="2.681">they</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="4.17">you have an anti-trump bent but</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="5.16">otherwise the facts are the facts are</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="5.61">really good so I wanted to just detail</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="4.83">for you what happened based off of this</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="4.02">sound like gosh</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="4.05">several thousand words so I went through</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="3.54">and I picked out a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="3.99">details to be able to share with you in</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="3.75">a kind of cohesive format I will warn</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="3.93">you this video is likely going to be</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="4.05">long so if you need to take it in two</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="3.3">parts that&amp;#39;s fine I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="4.5">separate it because this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="289.92" dur="5.04">presenting the case and then after this</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="4.17">is done I&amp;#39;ll try and dig into some other</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="3.51">details and stuff there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="297" dur="3.69">people online piecing things together</text>
  <text start="298.47" dur="5.67">piecing through is past doing all kinds</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="5.22">of things like that and to be honest it</text>
  <text start="304.14" dur="3.93">gets hairy for me when there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="3.81">information out there because no matter</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="3.98">what ends up happening I&amp;#39;ll I miss</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="5.01">something that someone else said or I</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="4.54">you know I cover something in a</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="3.54">different way and that I&amp;#39;m flooded with</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="3.27">people saying you didn&amp;#39;t say this you</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="2.49">said this you didn&amp;#39;t say that so-and-so</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="3.06">said this</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="4.77">someone so says you&amp;#39;re wrong and I I</text>
  <text start="322.92" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t want to get into that and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="4.35">a lot of people doing really good work</text>
  <text start="326.76" dur="5.61">out there so I&amp;#39;ll do my best but I have</text>
  <text start="329.88" dur="4.8">to fill I have to process a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="6.87">of data before I go ahead into that</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="10.47">realm now that I&amp;#39;ve talked so much let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="413.84" dur="6.96">Caribbean and that&amp;#39;s shown by FBI and</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="4.44">court records that are available now the</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="3.36">gentleman who was in charge of the case</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="3.479">down there in Florida&amp;#39;s name was Acosta</text>
  <text start="424.16" dur="3.81">and he is now in the Trump</text>
  <text start="425.599" dur="4.171">administration so when these charges all</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="3.919">came out this weekend everyone on the</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="4.56">left was like oh I&amp;#39;ve Steen&amp;#39;s chump Skyy</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="3.911">Epstein&amp;#39;s Trump&amp;#39;s friend we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="5.149">through and hear why that is absolutely</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="7.17">ridiculous and explain that but also</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="5.771">Acosta did handle this case and it was</text>
  <text start="442.97" dur="5.039">handled very poorly and there is a huge</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="3.21">question mark over why this happened the</text>
  <text start="448.009" dur="2.34">way it did</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="3.57">but there&amp;#39;s also interesting stuff</text>
  <text start="450.349" dur="5.04">brought up inside of these reports that</text>
  <text start="452.03" dur="5.729">I&amp;#39;ll tell you in a second he claims that</text>
  <text start="455.389" dur="4.65">he was strong-armed by Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.759" dur="5.311">legal team and in a written public</text>
  <text start="460.039" dur="4.681">statement on the 20th March 20th of 2011</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="3.51">he asserted that the deal that he struck</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="3.3">with Epstein&amp;#39;s lawyers was actually</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="3.119">harsher than it would have been had the</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="3.6">case remained with the state prosecutor</text>
  <text start="469.699" dur="4.201">who&amp;#39;s name was Krisher and Krisher</text>
  <text start="471.62" dur="3.53">favored charging Epstein with only this</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="4.65">little misdemeanor prostitution</text>
  <text start="475.15" dur="4.81">violation but documents show that Acosta</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="3.27">not only buckled under the pressure from</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="3.78">Epstein&amp;#39;s lawyers but he and other</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="4.62">prosecutors actually worked with the</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="4.679">attorneys to contain the case even as</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="4.8">the FBI was uncovering evidence of</text>
  <text start="488.419" dur="4.981">victims and witnesses in other states so</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="4.919">there&amp;#39;s a case going on down in Florida</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="6.09">and there&amp;#39;s a case going on nationally</text>
  <text start="496.159" dur="5.94">with which the FBI is involved in there</text>
  <text start="499.49" dur="6.69">were two people down in Florida who</text>
  <text start="502.099" dur="6.091">worked in Palm Beach that really were</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="4.019">the ones who put their careers and their</text>
  <text start="508.19" dur="4.68">lives on the line which we&amp;#39;ll learn</text>
  <text start="510.199" dur="5.251">about in a second the police chief there</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="4.919">Michael Reiter and a detective named</text>
  <text start="515.45" dur="4.23">Joseph for Kerry they were the only two</text>
  <text start="517.789" dur="4.201">really wanting to take on the case and</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="4.08">they interviewed victims and they were</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="3.3">you know really piecing through this and</text>
  <text start="523.76" dur="3.72">word got back to Epstein while they were</text>
  <text start="525.29" dur="4.21">doing that and he hired Alan Dershowitz</text>
  <text start="527.48" dur="4.36">as his attorney</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="4.53">police reports actually show as per this</text>
  <text start="531.84" dur="4.32">article that Epstein&amp;#39;s private</text>
  <text start="534.03" dur="4.32">investigators attempted to conduct</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="3.9">interviews while posing as cops they</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="3.72">picked through writers trash in search</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="3.81">of dirt to discredit him and that the</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="3.09">private investigators were accused of</text>
  <text start="543.87" dur="3.9">following the girls and their families</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="3.99">actually in one case the father of one</text>
  <text start="547.77" dur="3.12">of the girls claimed he had been run off</text>
  <text start="549.15" dur="3.69">the road by a private investigator and</text>
  <text start="550.89" dur="3.87">that was mentioned today in the bail</text>
  <text start="552.84" dur="5.49">document which we&amp;#39;ll go over at the end</text>
  <text start="554.76" dur="6.09">of this Dershowitz denies that he had</text>
  <text start="558.33" dur="5.24">anything to do with all of that but</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="6.12">Acosta who was in charge of this case</text>
  <text start="563.57" dur="4.99">ends up striking a deal with Epstein and</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="10.74">that&amp;#39;s where the controversy all comes</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="10.46">in so writer and writer so I lost my</text>
  <text start="577.71" dur="3.54">place I&amp;#39;m really sorry</text>

  <text start="1283.12" dur="4.8">their investigation was being undermined</text>
  <text start="1284.77" dur="4.62">and at the time of the article that</text>
  <text start="1287.92" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re talking about here there were two</text>
  <text start="1289.39" dur="5.34">unrelated lawsuits happening meaning</text>
  <text start="1292.42" dur="4.5">they were unrelated to one another one</text>
  <text start="1294.73" dur="4.83">of them involved Epstein and Edwards</text>
  <text start="1296.92" dur="5.52">Edwards was an attorney for some of the</text>
  <text start="1299.56" dur="4.77">victims and Epstein had accused him of</text>
  <text start="1302.44" dur="5.369">some legal misdeeds</text>
  <text start="1304.33" dur="5.219">and representing the victims this case</text>
  <text start="1307.809" dur="3.09">was noteworthy because it would mark the</text>
  <text start="1309.549" dur="3.72">first time that any of these victims</text>
  <text start="1310.899" dur="4.951">would actually speak in court and I</text>
  <text start="1313.269" dur="6.63">believe that that case was dismissed or</text>
  <text start="1315.85" dur="5.699">that Epstein withdrew basically Edwards</text>
  <text start="1319.899" dur="3.541">didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong</text>
  <text start="1321.549" dur="4.801">there was a conflict of interest it was</text>
  <text start="1323.44" dur="6.079">it was not it was not what Epstein</text>
  <text start="1326.35" dur="6.959">alleged it was and the other was the</text>
  <text start="1329.519" dur="7.061">federal crimes Victims Rights suit which</text>
  <text start="1333.309" dur="6.24">was decided recently and basically what</text>
  <text start="1336.58" dur="5.55">was decided was that when the government</text>
  <text start="1339.549" dur="4.59">gave this deal to Epstein they violated</text>
  <text start="1342.13" dur="4.289">the rights of all the victims by keeping</text>
  <text start="1344.139" dur="5.91">it hidden and not allowing these victims</text>
  <text start="1346.419" dur="6.291">to know that they were cutting a deal</text>
  <text start="1350.049" dur="4.771">with the person that had attacked them</text>
  <text start="1352.71" dur="4.329">which he was obviously pleading guilty</text>
  <text start="1354.82" dur="5.459">to so there&amp;#39;s no allegedly involved here</text>
  <text start="1357.039" dur="5.01">a lot of them thought that that all of</text>
  <text start="1360.279" dur="4.38">this was still happening that there was</text>
  <text start="1362.049" dur="5.461">still an investigation ongoing until the</text>
  <text start="1364.659" dur="5.461">very last second and if not then after</text>
  <text start="1367.51" dur="5.279">the deal had already been signed what a</text>
  <text start="1370.12" dur="5.75">travesty of justice for these people so</text>
  <text start="1372.789" dur="3.081">to sum up</text>
  <text start="1376.169" dur="4.451">Epstein would pay girls for massages</text>
  <text start="1378.82" dur="3.359">they would get he would give bonuses if</text>
  <text start="1380.62" dur="2.76">they did more he would tell the girls if</text>
  <text start="1382.179" dur="3.11">he didn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable they could</text>
  <text start="1383.38" dur="6.99">bring another girl and still get paid</text>
  <text start="1385.289" dur="7.151">thereby getting all of these victims to</text>
  <text start="1390.37" dur="5.159">come to his mansion for this horrible</text>

  <text start="1409.21" dur="8.339">something you know in in a drama club or</text>

  <text start="1420.639" dur="4.14">there in Florida take the case very</text>
  <text start="1422.83" dur="3.66">seriously they begin to prosecute it the</text>
  <text start="1424.779" dur="3.451">victims start piling up every time they</text>
  <text start="1426.49" dur="3.899">interview someone a new victim comes up</text>
  <text start="1428.23" dur="4.74">they start realizing the state attorney</text>
  <text start="1430.389" dur="4.741">in Florida is stonewalling the case they</text>

  <text start="1438.1" dur="4.56">that comes in the attorney strong-armed</text>
  <text start="1440.29" dur="4.98">Acosta allegedly according to Acosta</text>
  <text start="1442.66" dur="4.32">there is this massive cooperation</text>
  <text start="1445.27" dur="4.38">between the attorneys for Epstein and</text>
  <text start="1446.98" dur="4.44">the government they cut him a sweet ass</text>
  <text start="1449.65" dur="4.41">plea deal that never should have</text>
  <text start="1451.42" dur="4.92">happened with ridiculous I mean he</text>
  <text start="1454.06" dur="3.6">served in like no time basically for any</text>
  <text start="1456.34" dur="2.49">of this the only thing that really</text>
  <text start="1457.66" dur="3.06">happened to him was that he had to</text>
  <text start="1458.83" dur="3.87">register as a sex offender hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1460.72" dur="6.18">stopped him apparently which is very</text>
  <text start="1462.7" dur="6.27">clear and in 2018 the Miami Herald comes</text>
  <text start="1466.9" dur="6.62">out with a story the whole thing blows</text>
  <text start="1468.97" dur="7.61">up again and now the prosecutors of this</text>
  <text start="1473.52" dur="5.71">current arrest say that the</text>
  <text start="1476.58" dur="5.83">investigative reporting in part by the</text>
  <text start="1479.23" dur="5.07">Miami Herald and others helped them to</text>
  <text start="1482.41" dur="4.17">reopen the case that is what is being</text>
  <text start="1484.3" dur="3.87">said that is not necessarily what I</text>
  <text start="1486.58" dur="4.17">think is going on but it is what is</text>
  <text start="1488.17" dur="5.46">being said okay and the reason why I</text>
  <text start="1490.75" dur="5.25">think that that might not be what is</text>
  <text start="1493.63" dur="5.88">going on is because in a few of the</text>
  <text start="1496" dur="7.5">articles here they say some interesting</text>
  <text start="1499.51" dur="7.08">things now one thing to note is that</text>
  <text start="1503.5" dur="5.34">Recaro who&amp;#39;s a detective died he died in</text>
  <text start="1506.59" dur="7.5">May after a brief illness and right</text>
  <text start="1508.84" dur="6.93">after the story at 50 he said quote I</text>
  <text start="1514.09" dur="3.57">always hoped that the plea would be</text>
  <text start="1515.77" dur="4.56">thrown out and that these teenage girls</text>
  <text start="1517.66" dur="5.01">who were labeled as prostitutes by</text>
  <text start="1520.33" dur="3.69">prosecutors would get to finally shed</text>
  <text start="1522.67" dur="3.59">that label and see him go to prison</text>
  <text start="1524.02" dur="2.24">where he belongs</text>
  <text start="1526.56" dur="3.7">the interesting thing and that&amp;#39;s sad I</text>
  <text start="1529" dur="4.32">mean that&amp;#39;s sad</text>
  <text start="1530.26" dur="5.52">the interesting thing for me listen to</text>
  <text start="1533.32" dur="4.41">this this is from part three lawyers</text>
  <text start="1535.78" dur="3.87">representing Epstein&amp;#39;s victims have</text>

  <text start="2139.84" dur="5.55">speculating that&amp;#39;s just what I thought</text>
  <text start="2142.74" dur="5.41">now as soon as that the word got out</text>
  <text start="2145.39" dur="5.34">that Jeffrey Epstein was arrested though</text>
  <text start="2148.15" dur="4.83">the entire of course all of the stories</text>
  <text start="2150.73" dur="4.77">started coming out Trump pal</text>
  <text start="2152.98" dur="4.83">Epstein Trump pal Epstein Trump pal</text>

  <text start="2157.81" dur="4.08">named Trump as a friend of Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="2159.7" dur="4.44">Epstein and it really frustrates me</text>
  <text start="2161.89" dur="4.5">because there is so much open source</text>
  <text start="2164.14" dur="6.87">available that proves that to be false</text>
  <text start="2166.39" dur="7.229">and I&amp;#39;m going to show it to you but just</text>
  <text start="2171.01" dur="3.9">the fact that they they jump and I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="2176.71" dur="4.889">that they jump to that so quickly really</text>
  <text start="2179.14" dur="4.62">infuriated me of course they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2181.599" dur="3.541">do that and the other thing that</text>
  <text start="2183.76" dur="3.96">happened it&amp;#39;s the Southern District of</text>
  <text start="2185.14" dur="6.3">New York everybody all of a sudden said</text>
  <text start="2187.72" dur="5.58">I understand why I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>

  <text start="2193.3" dur="5.549">said this is because this is this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2196.99" dur="4.349">going to be a real trial or a real case</text>
  <text start="2198.849" dur="6.061">because it&amp;#39;s the SD NY and the entire SD</text>
  <text start="2201.339" dur="5.911">NY is corrupt but the public corruption</text>

  <text start="3598.46" dur="8.82">age of the victims there&amp;#39;s also no um</text>
  <text start="3601.76" dur="7.26">the plea deal is it doesn&amp;#39;t matter the</text>
  <text start="3607.28" dur="5.49">plea deal because this is a federal case</text>

  <text start="3673.55" dur="4.32">yet but it could be possible I know that</text>
  <text start="3676.1" dur="2.97">or I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that the reason why</text>
  <text start="3677.87" dur="3.75">they said that is because they&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="3679.07" dur="3.87">open court and there were media in there</text>
  <text start="3681.62" dur="3.15">and they neither confirm nor deny</text>

  <text start="3700.14" dur="4.53">whoa what just happened</text>
  <text start="3702.839" dur="4.651">so everybody looked at this today and</text>
  <text start="3704.67" dur="6.57">kind of was like ooh but I wasn&amp;#39;t I</text>
