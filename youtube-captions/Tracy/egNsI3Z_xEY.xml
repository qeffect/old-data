  <text start="6.569" dur="7.74">Time I don&amp;#39;t know exactly or I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="12.84" dur="3.689">know exactly and I still kind of don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="14.309" dur="5.341">know exactly what I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="16.529" dur="5.121">accomplish with this video but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="19.65" dur="4.379">relatively quiet over the past few weeks</text>
  <text start="21.65" dur="6.93">I&amp;#39;ve been working on a lot of stuff in</text>
  <text start="24.029" dur="7.951">the background big stuff but sometimes</text>
  <text start="28.58" dur="8.17">sometimes I kind of retreat into myself</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="6.75">I am I&amp;#39;m gonna get a teeny bit personal</text>
  <text start="36.75" dur="3.75">with you folks before I get into this</text>
  <text start="38.73" dur="4.59">material that I&amp;#39;m bringing up for you</text>
  <text start="40.5" dur="5.129">guys because I just have to share this</text>
  <text start="43.32" dur="9.36">and I know that I am not alone when I</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="9.811">say this um I have a keen sense of</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="5.91">intuition I&amp;#39;ve always had a keen sense</text>
  <text start="55.44" dur="5.79">of intuition however it seems as though</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="4.68">over the past year to two years it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="61.23" dur="4.77">been getting sharper and sharper and</text>
  <text start="63.27" dur="4.68">sharper and I&amp;#39;ve started practicing</text>
  <text start="66" dur="5.27">using this intuition in day-to-day</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="6.87">activity in decisions that I make in</text>
  <text start="71.27" dur="7.209">trying to kind of expand my mind expand</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="8.339">my consciousness understanding what it</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="8.64">is how it works um I suppose I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="6.811">for answers to the deeper questions of</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="5.79">our existence as a whole and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="89.97" dur="7.74">know why other than to say that I feel</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="10.381">like this is the logical place for us to</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="9.15">go now clearly there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="103.29" dur="5.44">happening to people on this planet in</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="4.91">terms of</text>
  <text start="108.73" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re awakening in terms of what</text>
  <text start="111.77" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re sensing and feeling and in terms</text>
  <text start="114.41" dur="8.1">of their meters in terms of</text>
  <text start="118.04" dur="6.12">their thoughts about life in terms of</text>
  <text start="122.51" dur="11.01">how people have come together through</text>
  <text start="124.16" dur="13.47">disaster and I know that I have some</text>
  <text start="133.52" dur="5.82">role to play in helping folks to kind of</text>
  <text start="137.63" dur="5.12">open their minds a little bit and stop</text>
  <text start="139.34" dur="6.51">focusing only on what we can see and</text>
  <text start="142.75" dur="8.89">start trying to focus more on what we</text>
  <text start="145.85" dur="7.92">feel and what exists that may be outside</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="8.58">of the realm of what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="153.77" dur="9.9">force-fed for so long this is</text>
  <text start="160.22" dur="5.31">spirituality whether you&amp;#39;re a religious</text>
  <text start="163.67" dur="3.03">person or you&amp;#39;re a spiritual person or</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="5.22">you don&amp;#39;t believe in organized religion</text>
  <text start="166.7" dur="9.78">or you do this videos not for that topic</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="8.19">it&amp;#39;s just I suppose if I came out and</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="5.58">just started talking about and um you</text>
  <text start="178.94" dur="5.91">know empaths and possibly even you know</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="4.5">psychics in quote or folks who can</text>
  <text start="184.85" dur="5.85">discern things that most other people</text>
  <text start="186.56" dur="6.75">kind of ignore that every one of us can</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="4.77">discern and started talking about how</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="4.35">little of our brain we actually used how</text>
  <text start="195.47" dur="4.68">energy is important how the frequency of</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="4.62">the earth is important to how space</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="4.74">plays into this how you know if I just</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="4.95">went on a tangent about that a lot of or</text>
  <text start="204.89" dur="4.02">some people who are just on the cusp of</text>
  <text start="207.23" dur="4.56">understanding these things or feeling</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="5.43">them may turn out immediately and I</text>
  <text start="211.79" dur="5.039">worked really really hard to build a</text>
  <text start="214.34" dur="4.83">level of credibility with folks and to</text>
  <text start="216.829" dur="5.101">report factual information and so I</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="8.49">figured as an introduction to kind of I</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="7.559">guess a new take that I&amp;#39;ll be sometimes</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="5.01">a new direction I&amp;#39;ll be going in</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="6.181">sometimes on this channel I would show</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="4.909">you some documentation from within our</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="4.59">own government that&amp;#39;s been Declassified</text>
  <text start="237.579" dur="3.751">that shows you that this stuff is real</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="5.75">and</text>
  <text start="241.33" dur="6.24">that the government is using it just</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="2.91">like I did with what a modification I do</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="4.5">have some more things on that at the end</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="6.66">here if we get to them but I want to</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="6.77">encourage everybody to focus more on</text>
  <text start="255.58" dur="5.73">what they feel tune into that</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="7.27">concentrate on raising their energy</text>
  <text start="261.31" dur="9.03">raising their vibration getting kind of</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="7.41">razor-sharp on that stuff because some</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="3.63">things coming and I don&amp;#39;t know what it</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="5.67">is</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="7.11">but I feel it and I&amp;#39;ve gotten pretty</text>
  <text start="279.19" dur="8.27">good at doing that</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="11.07">honestly I don&amp;#39;t share 99% of it with</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="6.24">you guys but I think it&amp;#39;s a common thing</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="6.15">and I think in the comments section</text>
  <text start="293.7" dur="7.18">you&amp;#39;ll probably see a large majority of</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="4.83">folks saying the same thing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="300.88" dur="5.43">think it&amp;#39;s doomsday I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.13" dur="7.07">the end of the world I do think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="8.76">paradigm shifting world changing earth</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="7.39">changing circumstance event series of</text>
  <text start="315.07" dur="4.62">events I don&amp;#39;t really know all I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="4.68">saying is I wanted to go into some of</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="5.49">this stuff for you so that you can see</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="6.899">that this stuff has been studied it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="7.64">been looked at it&amp;#39;s been used to advance</text>
  <text start="329.169" dur="6.331">a set of goals so I started at the CIA</text>
  <text start="332.82" dur="6.04">vault and I did a search for several</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="5.04">different terms here&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="6.05">parapsychology abstracts and</text>
  <text start="340.54" dur="7.41">international aspects of the occult and</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="6.16">here it is para psychological threat to</text>
  <text start="347.95" dur="4.4">cosmic in the 80s definitions and</text>
  <text start="351.07" dur="3.33">reasons for them and they go</text>

  <text start="365.41" dur="3.48">especially by the Soviets and the</text>
  <text start="367.18" dur="4.62">Chinese and the possibility that these</text>
  <text start="368.89" dur="4.4">uses are a threat to COMSEC as we know</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="3.53">today</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="4.02">the United States today has been has</text>

  <text start="382.26" dur="6.36">viewing and things like that that the</text>
  <text start="383.91" dur="6.24">CIA hits used for decades it would be</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="3.48">foolish to believe that the Soviets with</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="3.57">their large ongoing research projects or</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="4.53">the Chinese with their history of belief</text>

  <text start="396.63" dur="7.62">already using paranormal technique for</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="7.62">the same purpose and this basically goes</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="3.84">through it&amp;#39;s just the outline it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="4.92">get into the details of it it&amp;#39;s just the</text>
