  <text start="74.25" dur="6.84">gravity of what&amp;#39;s happening how can I</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="5.85">explain all the different facets of how</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="6.029">this new information shows us the way</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="5.04">the world is shaped around us and you</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="10.981">know everything you ever knew about</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="10.02">privacy is gone that&amp;#39;s basically that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="5.729">basically it</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="11.239">Internet of Things technology as a whole</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="6.29">has been weaponized against us</text>
  <text start="111.77" dur="5.08">the implications for governments around</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="5.549">the world for our relationships with</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="5.64">governments around the world for our</text>

  <text start="137.61" dur="7.04">have done what previous administrations</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="6.991">have done to stop this you know</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="7.23">basically an unaccountable rogue shadow</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="7.25">deep state running around completely</text>
  <text start="151.88" dur="7.51">operating completely outside of any law</text>
  <text start="155.09" dur="9.27">the Constitution it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="4.97">overwhelming it&amp;#39;s an overwhelming</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="4.69">undertaking or it&amp;#39;s an overwhelming</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="6.06">thought it&amp;#39;s an overwhelming dump it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="5.79">an overwhelming massive amount of every</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.07">information in vault seven and this is</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="5.13">part one um what I figured I would do in</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="4.83">part one is basically a tutorial for you</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="3.93">guys this may not be the viral video you</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="2.489">were hoping for but I think it might</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="4.099">help some people as they navigate</text>
  <text start="186.359" dur="2.96">through this on their own</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="3.97">everybody&amp;#39;s got tidbits coming out like</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="3.57">oh they can pretend they&amp;#39;re Russia just</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="4.349">everything you thought you ever knew</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="5.28">about anything pretended it you know</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="5.101">pretend what you thought you knew just</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="5.429">realize that nothing you thought or or</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="6.149">knew about anything is real everything</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="6.631">you were ever told is a lie it sounds</text>
  <text start="209.549" dur="5.211">dramatic but it&amp;#39;s really the truth I do</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="5.34">want to clear up something about signal</text>
  <text start="214.76" dur="5.289">they can&amp;#39;t hack signal encryption but</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="3.389">they can hack the phone which then gives</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="5.28">them a you know access to those things</text>
  <text start="221.819" dur="5.01">keystroke loggers spying on you through</text>
  <text start="225.329" dur="4.231">your television spying on you through</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="5.13">your gaming system you know this is so</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="3.33">far outside of the realm of partisan</text>
  <text start="231.959" dur="4.681">politics or Paula</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="5.88">takes as a whole yes yes the deep state</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="3.51">can use this against Donald Trump and</text>
  <text start="238.77" dur="2.91">yes they can make it look like Russia</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="3.78">was talking with Donald Trump yeah they</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="4.56">could do anything they want I think that</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s what the real takeaway here is is</text>
  <text start="246.24" dur="10.02">that this is bigger than politics in the</text>
  <text start="250.02" dur="11.969">United States of America sorry it took a</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="7.71">drink of water if I sound somber it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="7.141">not because I&amp;#39;m upset or sad it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="5.67">well that&amp;#39;s wrong I am sad I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="2.76">know</text>
  <text start="269.64" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s almost mind-blowing how you fix</text>
  <text start="271.89" dur="3.779">something like this</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="6.23">I suppose awareness is the first way and</text>
  <text start="275.669" dur="3.531">WikiLeaks is taking care of that for us</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="8.53">so let&amp;#39;s get into our tutorial WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="2.7">has done a really good job of</text>
  <text start="289.47" dur="3.449">characterizing this for us</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="4.89">categorizing us with this for us I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="5.341">sorry with the table of contents the</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="4.26">press release the analysis I would</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="5.219">encourage everybody to really read this</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="6.66">stuff it&amp;#39;s insane</text>
  <text start="303.479" dur="6.091">and then they break everything down into</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="5.4">documents there&amp;#39;s 8,000 or somewhat</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="4.71">documents in here and they go by</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="4.92">department branches and groups in the</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="4.44">first directory better development</text>
  <text start="317.1" dur="3.15">branches and then they go through all</text>
  <text start="318.72" dur="3.89">this stuff and a lot of the stuff in</text>
  <text start="320.25" dur="6.72">here you probably won&amp;#39;t even understand</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="6.82">because it&amp;#39;s technical jargon they have</text>
  <text start="326.97" dur="8.43">their project names here and if you go</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="8.549">to their projects you&amp;#39;ll see information</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="4.68">and if you read in here</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="6.451">you&amp;#39;ll find some things that you can</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="8.25">understand and what I wanted to point</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="5.88">out to people was at the bottom I mean</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="5.399">look at all this there are previous</text>
  <text start="350.31" dur="9.32">versions so this is every iteration of</text>
  <text start="353.729" dur="5.901">this document that was available</text>
  <text start="359.639" dur="8.791">go back I would I would definitely click</text>
  <text start="362.009" dur="8.011">on one start in the beginning the only</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="7.319">issue is you can&amp;#39;t go back to two you</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="16.34">have to start again and then click on</text>
  <text start="375.749" dur="13.801">two and read if anyone&amp;#39;s got a Sonos</text>
  <text start="386.36" dur="7.51">networking system speaker system in</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="7.94">their house pay attention to this but</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="3.62">you could basically go through every um</text>

  <text start="504.24" dur="3.99">listen to your television why do they</text>
  <text start="506.97" dur="6.78">want to know what we&amp;#39;re saying in our</text>

  <text start="593.58" dur="7.08">really secure they tell you exactly what</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="9.779">they&amp;#39;re doing and how the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="600.66" dur="7.95">I think is they were unable to classify</text>
  <text start="606.389" dur="7.051">this material because it would have been</text>
  <text start="608.61" dur="6.149">against the law I don&amp;#39;t understand so</text>
  <text start="613.44" dur="3.629">they couldn&amp;#39;t classify it so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.759" dur="5.7">basically like the person who were the</text>
  <text start="617.069" dur="7.14">people who provided this use their own</text>
  <text start="620.459" dur="5.19">tools to steal it but technically I</text>
  <text start="624.209" dur="2.911">guess wasn&amp;#39;t stealing it because it was</text>
  <text start="625.649" dur="3.831">unclassified because if they would have</text>
  <text start="627.12" dur="5.19">classified it it would have been illegal</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="5.95">but I don&amp;#39;t think that that really</text>
  <text start="632.31" dur="5.49">matters I&amp;#39;m gonna go through the history</text>
  <text start="635.43" dur="4.019">I&amp;#39;m gonna go through it all and I know</text>
  <text start="637.8" dur="2.399">there are so many other people doing it</text>
  <text start="639.449" dur="3.24">and that&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="640.199" dur="6.711">you&amp;#39;re not gonna necessarily get the</text>
  <text start="642.689" dur="11.25">breaking this is what I found because I</text>
  <text start="646.91" dur="9.13">can&amp;#39;t do that right now but the</text>
  <text start="653.939" dur="4.08">significance of this is it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="656.04" dur="5.25">something that I&amp;#39;ve not quite found the</text>
  <text start="658.019" dur="5.01">words yet to explain and I can guarantee</text>
  <text start="661.29" dur="4.739">they&amp;#39;ll be more coming in the next few</text>

  <text start="675.36" dur="10.14">code that&amp;#39;s in here for them to look at</text>
  <text start="678.149" dur="9.5">I will talk to you guys soon but I would</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="4.38">recommend going through this and</text>
  <text start="687.649" dur="7.351">navigating through the pages and just</text>
