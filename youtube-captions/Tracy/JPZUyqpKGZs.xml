  <text start="113.13" dur="4.26">while I&amp;#39;ve been really really busy hard</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="3.72">at work on a lot of different things but</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="4.53">I wanted to come and talk to you today</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="5.549">about work that I&amp;#39;ve been doing for</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="6">uncovered DC and kind of just stepping</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="7.921">back a couple of steps and taking a look</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="5.88">at this from like 30,000 feet and I know</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.76">a lot of other people are doing this</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="6.15">same thing you know the impeachment</text>
  <text start="137.09" dur="6.25">Fiasco that started started based off of</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="5.79">a transcript of a core based off of a</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="4.8">leaker report of a call that never</text>
  <text start="145.74" dur="4.74">happened and they got incorrect</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="4.89">information and they used that in the</text>
  <text start="150.48" dur="6.42">whistleblower report which the IC IG</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="6.63">just went right to Congress with if you</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="4.56">guys listen to Dan van Geno&amp;#39;s interview</text>
  <text start="159.66" dur="4.37">with President Trump yesterday he made</text>
  <text start="161.46" dur="6.03">the point to say that they didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="5.08">you know explore it at all before they</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="3.12">went right to Congress with it and that</text>
  <text start="169.11" dur="4.02">he made the point a couple times that</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="4.77">Nancy Pelosi is angry because what she</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="4.14">was told was there was not there and</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s been getting my wheel spinning a</text>
  <text start="177.27" dur="3.09">little bit I&amp;#39;ve been trying to kind of</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="5.28">come up with what happened and what went</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="5.94">wrong because there&amp;#39;s no way no way that</text>
  <text start="183.96" dur="3.48">they could have pulled this there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="186.3" dur="3.21">way they would have gone forward with</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="5.97">this in my opinion on such a weak and</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="6.12">flimsy basis so I&amp;#39;ve been exploring</text>
  <text start="193.41" dur="4.26">lieutenant colonel VIN Minh my last</text>
  <text start="195.63" dur="4.5">video was the statement from Hickman</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="4.7">Lieutenant Colonel Hickman on his</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="5.4">experiences with Michael VIN Minh and</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="6.4">VIN man&amp;#39;s relationship with the whistle</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="5.55">leaker and what the heck happened there</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="4.59">and whether or not VIN Minh could have</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="5.129">been the one remember he wanted to</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="5.07">change the transcript whether he could</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="7.401">have been the one to leak to the</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="8.88">whistleblower what he thought was going</text>
  <text start="223.61" dur="6.91">to be changed in the transcript and they</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="7.5">just went so quickly that they messed</text>
  <text start="230.52" dur="6.96">themselves up but that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="6">functionality of how it happened not the</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="4.68">why so obviously they want to remove the</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="3.12">president obviously they want to cause</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="3.21">problems for reelection obviously we all</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="3.36">know that stuff already but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="3.869">really trying to figure out you know or</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="6.63">put together in a more cohesive form</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="10.051">what is it about this that is really</text>
  <text start="253.92" dur="9.15">hurting them and Ukraine is a very</text>
  <text start="259.29" dur="7.59">important country in terms of power and</text>
