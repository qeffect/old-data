  <text start="13.23" dur="5.24">hearing from today with Rosenstein and</text>
  <text start="18.68" dur="7.75">there are a number of things I could say</text>
  <text start="21.9" dur="7.799">about a number of different portions of</text>
  <text start="26.43" dur="9.629">this testimony how hypocritical it is</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="8.731">how if you know the facts if you know</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="5.491">the facts of what&amp;#39;s going on the hard</text>
  <text start="38.43" dur="6.449">evidence of what&amp;#39;s going on whether you</text>
  <text start="41.55" dur="5.25">are a Democrat or a Republican or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="6.031">not affiliated with a party or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="7.05">just a spectator and you know the facts</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="6.059">that we all know this is a dog and pony</text>
  <text start="53.85" dur="7.59">show for the most part but this</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="5.73">congressman or senator I think at the</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="3.57">Congress know the house set the</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="4.561">congressman he just his testimony was</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="6.51">the most striking to me so far and I</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="5.49">want to play it for you guys listen the</text>
  <text start="71.52" dur="3.36">chair recognizes the gentleman from</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="4.02">Idaho mr. Labrador for five minutes</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="4.14">Thank You mr. chairman Thank You mr.</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="5.58">Rosenstein for being here today</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="5.07">I should her at some of the questions</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="3.6">from the other side and I just want to</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="3.66">ask you a quick question have you ever</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="5.73">said that you are the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="6.03">wingman no sir has the current Attorney</text>
  <text start="91.68" dur="4.38">General of the United States ever said</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="4.62">that he is the president&amp;#39;s wingman not</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="4.11">to our knowledge but yet the Attorney</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="3.39">General under President Obama said that</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="4.35">he was the president&amp;#39;s wingman and I</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="4.619">never heard a single Democrat object to</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="4.23">that so it&amp;#39;s kind of ridiculous to sit</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="3.96">here and try to question your integrity</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="3.45">or trying to question whether somebody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="4.231">going to be loyal to their president or</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="4.529">not as you clearly indicated you can be</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="4.619">both loyal to the Constitution and to</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="3.99">the President of the United States as</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="2.671">long as there&amp;#39;s not a conflict of</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="3.9">interest as long as you&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="4.56">anything that is inappropriate it&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="3">to be the president&amp;#39;s wingman it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="3.059">Kate to say that you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="3.84">loyal to the president as long as</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re not asking to do anything that</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="5.761">is illegal isn&amp;#39;t that correct</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="5.97">yes so what was the goal of the Russians</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="3.47">when they tried to interfere with the</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="3.479">elections in the United States</text>
  <text start="140.69" dur="4.18">assessment of the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="142.319" dur="5.241">as reflected in their public report is</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="5.55">that the goal of the Russians was to</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="7.27">undermine American confidence and</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="6.72">democracy so to undermine the Americans</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="4.379">at some of paraphrasing contract in</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="4.17">front of me so they try to undermine the</text>
  <text start="159.209" dur="3.721">public faith in the US democratic</text>
  <text start="161.31" dur="4.14">process is that correct leave that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="4.86">correct I believe that no one in the</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="4.05">United States has done more to undermine</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="3.93">the belief in the United States</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="4.47">democratic process and the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="4.769">the press in some cases when they</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.01">continue to report on false allegation</text>
  <text start="176.489" dur="4.08">after allegation after allegation in</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="3.569">fact what you see from the Democrats is</text>
  <text start="180.569" dur="3.661">that they move from one allegation that</text>
  <text start="182.549" dur="3.75">allegation is proven to be false and</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="3.569">they move to the next one and they move</text>
  <text start="186.299" dur="3.841">to the next one or they do move to the</text>
  <text start="187.799" dur="4.921">next one because they&amp;#39;re unhappy with</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="5.28">the results of the election can you tell</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="4.859">me why the Independent Counsel was</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="4.5">actually appointed and I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="197.579" dur="5.371">stop real quick because my gosh isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="4.8">that music to your ears that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="2.22">pretty much word-for-word what I just</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="2.73">said</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="5.7">yesterday and I think it&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="4.619">all thinking this gentleman just like I</text>
  <text start="210.87" dur="3.06">was sitting here and I&amp;#39;m just sitting</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="4.561">here like idly listening to this and</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="4.74">then I I just I start hearing this and</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;m like whew this sounds great let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="5.069">continue special counsel congressman</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;ve explained publicly that I appointed</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="3.211">the special counsel based upon the</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="4.139">unique circumstances in order to promote</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="5.28">public confidence and I have nothing to</text>
  <text start="229.169" dur="5.611">add to that so why when mr. Miller was</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="4.74">charged with investigating he was</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="4.44">charged with investigating quote any</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.62">links and/or coordination between the</text>
  <text start="239.22" dur="4.949">Russian government and individuals</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="5.579">associated with the campaign of Donald</text>
  <text start="244.169" dur="5.19">Trump and any matters that arose or may</text>
  <text start="247.169" dur="3.41">arise directly from the investigation</text>
  <text start="249.359" dur="5.371">end quote</text>
  <text start="250.579" dur="8.41">that charge is overly broad but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="5.999">been two prosecutions or at least two</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="4.43">charges so far brought by the</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="5.281">Independent Counsel is that correct for</text>
  <text start="263.419" dur="3.22">individuals charged to pleaded guilty</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="2.76">and</text>
  <text start="266.639" dur="4.261">you will stand trial have any of them</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="3.69">been charged with any links and/or</text>
  <text start="270.9" dur="3.15">coordination between the Russian</text>
  <text start="272.46" dur="3.6">government and individuals associated</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="3.51">with that campaign for president</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="2.609">Irishman the charges speak for</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="2.699">themselves I&amp;#39;m not going to comment</text>
  <text start="278.669" dur="5.28">beyond what&amp;#39;s in the charging document</text>
  <text start="280.259" dur="6.12">the answer is no just in case you think</text>
  <text start="283.949" dur="4.261">you shouldn&amp;#39;t know that but is there</text>
  <text start="286.379" dur="4.171">anything in those charging documents</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="4.889">that there was a coordination between</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="5.31">the Trump administration and the</text>
  <text start="293.099" dur="4.111">Russians congressman I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="4.23">comment beyond what&amp;#39;s in the charging</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="5.069">documents I think you can draw your own</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="4.199">conclusions so something I do agree with</text>
  <text start="302.279" dur="3.271">my friends on the other side is that we</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="2.88">should get to the bottom of the we</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="3.419">should know the truth we should know</text>
  <text start="307.169" dur="3.451">whether there was collusion between</text>
  <text start="308.969" dur="3.841">Russia and the President of the United</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="4.319">States we should also know whether there</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="5.849">was collusion between any department who</text>
  <text start="314.939" dur="6.331">tried to interfere with our elections so</text>
  <text start="318.659" dur="6.54">can you tell me was there collusion</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="6.899">between the DOJ and fuchsine GPS to use</text>
  <text start="325.199" dur="5.851">a Democratic funded document for</text>
  <text start="328.169" dur="4.74">political and legal purposes I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="3.78">know the answer to that congressman I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="332.909" dur="4.171">simply point out that the language I</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="4.739">actually used in the Poynting order was</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="5.1">coordination and I believe that was the</text>
  <text start="339.569" dur="5.1">language used by director Comey when he</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="4.079">publicly testified about an ongoing</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="4.62">investigation I did not use the word</text>
  <text start="346.259" dur="5.16">collusion okay so that coordination as</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="5.641">it was there any coordination between</text>
  <text start="351.419" dur="6.78">the DOJ and fusion GPS to try to</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="5.789">undermine an election of the United</text>
  <text start="358.199" dur="3.81">States if there were congressmen I&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="3.45">very concerned about it as you know</text>
  <text start="362.009" dur="3.601">there are ongoing reviews and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="2.941">position to comment about this so there</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="3.899">are ongoing reviews so there could</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="5.669">potentially be an investigation whether</text>
  <text start="369.509" dur="6.15">the DOJ and members of the DOJ actually</text>
  <text start="372.779" dur="5.091">colluded with an enemy of a political</text>
  <text start="375.659" dur="4.29">party in a political candidate to</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="3.849">undermine the elections of the United</text>
  <text start="379.949" dur="3.12">States if there&amp;#39;s any evidence that</text>
  <text start="381.719" dur="4.62">warrants that congressman will do what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.069" dur="7.861">appropriate all right so I think if you</text>
  <text start="386.339" dur="6.841">want to to restore the trust of the</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="3.989">American people I think the Department</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="3.089">of Justice has a duty to give us all the</text>
  <text start="394.919" dur="3.96">information that we have been asking for</text>
  <text start="396.269" dur="4.051">we need to find out who started this</text>
  <text start="398.879" dur="3.391">investigation</text>
  <text start="400.32" dur="5.18">to find out what the purpose was if you</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="6.69">have an individual who actually had a</text>
  <text start="405.5" dur="5.74">desire to have an outcome in a political</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="4.02">race and they decided to use the</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="4.32">Department of Justice to investigate</text>
  <text start="412.98" dur="4.05">their political opponents I think that</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="3.18">is one of the worst crimes that has</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="3.6">occurred in the history of the United</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="4.35">Sates II when it comes to politics do</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="4.56">you agree with that you would if that</text>
  <text start="423.09" dur="4.02">were what happened congressman it would</text>
  <text start="425.19" dur="3.06">certainly be of great concern all right</text>
  <text start="427.11" dur="2.94">well I hope that you are truly</text>
  <text start="428.25" dur="3.33">investigating this and that we get to</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="4.07">the bottom of this thank you very much</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="2.54">and I yield back</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="11.11">that was beautiful thank you that was it</text>
  <text start="444.51" dur="4.44">there was no grandstanding there was no</text>
  <text start="446.79" dur="5.9">yelling there was no screaming that was</text>
  <text start="448.95" dur="8.1">just the blunt truth right there</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="7.3">masterful perfect beautiful I&amp;#39;m you know</text>
  <text start="457.05" dur="4.23">on both sides of the aisle I I sit here</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="3.9">and I watch these things and I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="4.38">you know the on one side you have the</text>
  <text start="463.89" dur="5.25">Democrats who don&amp;#39;t really give two</text>
  <text start="465.66" dur="5.13">hoots about justice it&amp;#39;s obvious and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="469.14" dur="2.79">not being partisan when I say that if</text>
