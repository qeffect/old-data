  <text start="750.68" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s very strange maybe you can clear up</text>
  <text start="752.3" dur="5.01">is the White House Cyrus Sanders took</text>

  <text start="759.17" dur="1.859">Politico</text>
  <text start="759.709" dur="2.791">they basically said because they</text>
  <text start="761.029" dur="4.05">provided the emails they were able to</text>
  <text start="762.5" dur="5.699">tell that you weren&amp;#39;t telling the truth</text>

  <text start="768.199" dur="4.44">quoted as saying that do you have any</text>
  <text start="769.73" dur="5.849">idea why they would say something like</text>

  <text start="775.579" dur="4.8">the story wasn&amp;#39;t the time maybe I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="851.189" dur="3.811">me at that time was he&amp;#39;s not allowed to</text>
  <text start="853.56" dur="3.269">talk to you well connected I can&amp;#39;t paint</text>
  <text start="855" dur="5.519">but they want him to cooperate with them</text>

  <text start="860.519" dur="4.291">right because you know I&amp;#39;m saying like</text>
  <text start="862.319" dur="3.87">it was interesting to me and now that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="875.04" dur="3.57">have an arrest warrant know why I was</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="4.22">being arrested except I think I heard</text>

  <text start="880.7" dur="4.77">and when you&amp;#39;re not fully transparent or</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="3.6">something we&amp;#39;re just very vague</text>

  <text start="909.2" dur="4.23">interviews with Moeller and these people</text>
  <text start="911.21" dur="3.66">I felt that I was being persecuted or</text>
  <text start="913.43" dur="3.24">prosecuted because I was helping</text>
  <text start="914.87" dur="3.39">troubled women not because I did</text>
  <text start="916.67" dur="3.33">anything illegal against my country and</text>

  <text start="925.49" dur="4.92">Logan act violation we&amp;#39;re gonna look</text>
  <text start="928.1" dur="7.05">into that opportunity I mean so it was</text>
  <text start="930.41" dur="5.91">just bizarre sequence of events I never</text>
  <text start="935.15" dur="2.67">really understood what they were trying</text>
  <text start="936.32" dur="3.48">to get out of me considering Mifsud was</text>
  <text start="937.82" dur="4.68">working there friendlies the whole time</text>

  <text start="985.94" dur="5.19">mean I&amp;#39;m a trainee despite what they say</text>
  <text start="988.64" dur="6">suddenly this is some people that was</text>
  <text start="991.13" dur="5.73">subscribed I was a trainee in Washington</text>
  <text start="994.64" dur="4.53">and you know what&amp;#39;s funny about this</text>
  <text start="996.86" dur="3.029">qualities that I entire campaign is</text>
  <text start="999.17" dur="2.879">currently</text>
  <text start="999.889" dur="6.24">is that the trying to say or she was</text>

  <text start="1009.759" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s interesting that they would start</text>
  <text start="1011.199" dur="3.24">talking around there yeah so what did</text>
  <text start="1013.329" dur="2.93">they say you couldn&amp;#39;t use that attorney</text>
  <text start="1014.439" dur="4.411">because of a conflict there so basically</text>
  <text start="1016.259" dur="4.42">you know I had just spent them you know</text>
  <text start="1018.85" dur="3.839">a lot of money on summer vacation with</text>
  <text start="1020.679" dur="3.39">her and that was I had a job offer</text>
  <text start="1022.689" dur="5.13">actually one of the major news channels</text>
  <text start="1024.069" dur="5.671">here in this country the day after I was</text>
  <text start="1027.819" dur="5.401">arrested obviously that didn&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="1029.74" dur="7.349">so I&amp;#39;m stuck in a position where I&amp;#39;m 29</text>
  <text start="1033.22" dur="6.239">yeah with X amount of savings and the</text>
  <text start="1037.089" dur="4.651">federal government following on top of</text>
  <text start="1039.459" dur="3.81">me and not allowing me to choose what</text>
  <text start="1041.74" dur="2.13">lawyer I want to defend maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1043.269" dur="2.52">great</text>
  <text start="1043.87" dur="3.179">so they basically told me that if you</text>
  <text start="1045.789" dur="4.89">choose him as your lawyer we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1047.049" dur="6.451">put you back in jail and I said what are</text>
  <text start="1050.679" dur="4.98">they even allowed to do that well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1053.5" dur="3.75">a good question her subpoena by them is</text>
  <text start="1055.659" dur="4.101">also another legal question but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1057.25" dur="2.51">get into that later</text>
  <text start="1062.42" dur="7.76">okay yeah yeah I had like a US soil</text>
  <text start="1064.94" dur="5.24">normally you can subpoena its you know</text>
  <text start="1073.87" dur="5.909">or less likely to be involved into crime</text>
  <text start="1077.89" dur="3.69">so they couldn&amp;#39;t really even subpoena</text>
  <text start="1079.779" dur="5.4">you don&amp;#39;t stay hiding out of that but</text>
  <text start="1081.58" dur="6.26">you said you didn&amp;#39;t have counsel here no</text>
  <text start="1085.179" dur="5.981">Bryce they knew it was them for 50 days</text>
  <text start="1087.84" dur="10.12">and then contact the</text>
  <text start="1091.16" dur="10.53">they might know how to love it Pizza and</text>
  <text start="1097.96" dur="4.99">lower than bureaucracy and you know not</text>
  <text start="1101.69" dur="7.41">the most efficient it&amp;#39;s at the Swiss</text>
  <text start="1102.95" dur="10.4">Embassy provided oh here for eight</text>
  <text start="1109.1" dur="4.25">hundred dollars an hour and I said</text>
  <text start="1115.28" dur="5.58">they want to see me to me everything was</text>
  <text start="1117.35" dur="8.07">so yeah you ever nothing to hide right</text>
  <text start="1120.86" dur="6.12">so why so why how quickly did you have</text>
  <text start="1125.42" dur="2.31">to pick an attorney that how did you</text>
  <text start="1126.98" dur="2.91">find her</text>
  <text start="1127.73" dur="5.97">well he was like an old attorney family</text>
  <text start="1129.89" dur="7.5">attorney in Chicago yeah who had no</text>
  <text start="1133.7" dur="6.66">background in the political cases yeah</text>
  <text start="1137.39" dur="4.68">yeah if you don&amp;#39;t understand that people</text>
  <text start="1140.36" dur="3.66">outside resent us more so political he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1142.07" dur="6.15">in the criminal case this entire thing</text>
  <text start="1144.02" dur="8.31">political and I&amp;#39;m stuck with two lawyers</text>
  <text start="1148.22" dur="7.35">from Chicago who will hate Trump tell me</text>
  <text start="1152.33" dur="6.93">that basically we&amp;#39;re Hillary fans</text>
  <text start="1155.57" dur="5.87">Hillary donors and the last thing they</text>
  <text start="1159.26" dur="5.91">probably wanted to do was instigate</text>
  <text start="1161.44" dur="5.59">Moeller and his investigation and wanted</text>
  <text start="1165.17" dur="3.75">to basically use me any way possible as</text>
  <text start="1167.03" dur="3.96">an instrument to hurt Trump I mean</text>
  <text start="1168.92" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s what I think happened because we</text>
  <text start="1170.99" dur="5.58">change so quick into negotiations with</text>
  <text start="1173.78" dur="5.55">them and I didn&amp;#39;t want to I never wanted</text>
  <text start="1176.57" dur="4.13">to play I never wanted to play because I</text>
  <text start="1179.33" dur="4.52">never felt I had anything wrong</text>
  <text start="1180.7" dur="5.74">especially with the lying stuff but then</text>
  <text start="1183.85" dur="4.9">as I stated earlier about my contacts</text>
  <text start="1186.44" dur="4.59">with Israel in the Middle East then</text>
  <text start="1188.75" dur="4.38">during my last session with these people</text>
  <text start="1191.03" dur="3.12">they tell me you don&amp;#39;t think guilty to</text>
  <text start="1193.13" dur="3.42">lying we&amp;#39;re gonna charge you with the</text>
  <text start="1194.15" dur="4.77">mechanism an Israeli agent I said in</text>
  <text start="1196.55" dur="3.93">this really agent what does it even mean</text>
  <text start="1198.92" dur="4.38">yeah and then you&amp;#39;re thinking in your</text>
  <text start="1200.48" dur="4.98">mind if I don&amp;#39;t know what that means</text>
  <text start="1203.3" dur="3.66">what could a jury think that means and</text>
  <text start="1205.46" dur="3.87">what could the government present it as</text>
  <text start="1206.96" dur="3.81">and what would they even so I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="1209.33" dur="2.76">myself first of all I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1210.77" dur="4.32">confidence of these attorneys that the</text>
  <text start="1212.09" dur="4.59">kid yeah the secondly the last thing I</text>
  <text start="1215.09" dur="4.71">would want to do is go to trial with</text>
  <text start="1216.68" dur="7.05">these people who know nothing about fara</text>
  <text start="1219.8" dur="8.43">issues and my work and what I was up to</text>
  <text start="1223.73" dur="6.14">and actually attacking Muller and they</text>
  <text start="1228.23" dur="5.1">basically told me we don&amp;#39;t want to go to</text>
  <text start="1229.87" dur="5.59">they fired you I mean they basically</text>
  <text start="1233.33" dur="4.23">told me Oh like that&amp;#39;s not a good idea</text>
  <text start="1235.46" dur="3.78">so move forward - and I&amp;#39;m thinking some</text>
  <text start="1237.56" dur="4.08">some and I&amp;#39;m reading the status of</text>
  <text start="1239.24" dur="3.74">offense and she&amp;#39;s there - she&amp;#39;s a lawyer</text>
  <text start="1241.64" dur="3.45">she&amp;#39;s like so you&amp;#39;re pleading guilty</text>
  <text start="1242.98" dur="4.48">instead of lying about what you met</text>
  <text start="1245.09" dur="4.68">somebody a year ago that&amp;#39;s what your</text>
  <text start="1247.46" dur="5.16">cases and that&amp;#39;s actually what my cases</text>
  <text start="1249.77" dur="5.66">yes no year can you you cannot really</text>
  <text start="1252.62" dur="6.03">challenge it a quarter because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1255.43" dur="5.68">yeah they were asking me but they do</text>
  <text start="1258.65" dur="4.26">means we&amp;#39;ve stood before or after</text>
  <text start="1261.11" dur="4.08">joining the tram campaign and that</text>
  <text start="1262.91" dur="4.94">officially was appointed after so is</text>
  <text start="1265.19" dur="2.66">that soon after</text>
  <text start="1268.04" dur="6.61">so why don&amp;#39;t you defend them and I said</text>
  <text start="1272.4" dur="5.909">it&amp;#39;s not my you certainly anything</text>
  <text start="1274.65" dur="5.58">basically what my entire situation is</text>
  <text start="1278.309" dur="4.381">after all this time I&amp;#39;ve had to think</text>
  <text start="1280.23" dur="4.56">about it and look back and I understand</text>
  <text start="1282.69" dur="4.8">what it is now my involvement in the</text>
  <text start="1284.79" dur="4.89">Russia fake conspiracy isn&amp;#39;t red herring</text>
  <text start="1287.49" dur="4.44">to keep the attention off of what they</text>
  <text start="1289.68" dur="3.66">were really after before or widely why</text>
  <text start="1291.93" dur="3.45">the surveillance have you started them</text>

  <text start="1813.32" dur="3.96">the beginning on the more you talk about</text>
  <text start="1814.58" dur="5.16">the UK in Australia but there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="1817.28" dur="5.19">now that the newspaper the Australian</text>
  <text start="1819.74" dur="4.89">did a profile on me a couple weeks ago</text>
  <text start="1822.47" dur="6.48">there&amp;#39;s a reason that Alexander Downer</text>
  <text start="1824.63" dur="7.5">is hiding he&amp;#39;s in fear there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="1828.95" dur="5.82">that I have specific information that</text>
  <text start="1832.13" dur="4.17">the British Foreign Ministry was spying</text>
  <text start="1834.77" dur="6.69">on me in London during the same</text>

  <text start="1858.05" dur="2.04">hurtful</text>
  <text start="1858.53" dur="3.15">so the back story that no one has</text>
  <text start="1860.09" dur="2.82">learned so far is that you have all</text>
  <text start="1861.68" dur="3.78">these connections you&amp;#39;re changing</text>
  <text start="1862.91" dur="4.98">basically the world stage in terms of</text>
