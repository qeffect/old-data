  <text start="119.64" dur="4.409">to you about Ratcliffe and I want to</text>
  <text start="120.78" dur="5.129">talk to you about this Jodha Jenna via</text>
  <text start="124.049" dur="3.75">interview that came out yesterday now if</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="4.531">you guys will recall a few months ago I</text>
  <text start="127.799" dur="4.531">sat here and I told you how Jo digenova</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="3.47">wouldn&amp;#39;t put his credibility on the line</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="3.14">and say there was a report B</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="3.15">released on call me if he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.47" dur="4.17">generally sure that there would be a</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="4.47">report being released on Comey and that</text>
  <text start="139.64" dur="5.88">was one of the only reasons why I was</text>
  <text start="141.53" dur="5.7">sharing what I did the cricket sound</text>
  <text start="145.52" dur="4.35">effects should be cued right now because</text>
  <text start="147.23" dur="5.82">we got crickets we never got the</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="5.49">supposed report on Comey and I talked</text>
  <text start="153.05" dur="4.62">about it in that way for a very specific</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="4.11">reason I still don&amp;#39;t think that Jones</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="3.51">Jennifer would put his credibility on</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="4.94">the line and say that there was a report</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="5.25">being released when there wasn&amp;#39;t I just</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="4.03">will take the next bit of information</text>
  <text start="166.43" dur="5.46">and the next bit of information with a</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="6.63">little bit less of a surety as I did</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="4.59">before what he does say in here is</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="4.29">rather interesting and if you guys</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="4.98">listen to the podcast yesterday Frank</text>
  <text start="179.36" dur="4.38">and I talked about some stuff that John</text>
  <text start="181.46" dur="5.85">Solomon said in a Sean Hannity interview</text>
  <text start="183.74" dur="6.42">where he mentioned that he mentioned</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="6.21">that Coates would be leaving before that</text>
  <text start="190.16" dur="5.61">news hit and he also mentioned that we</text>
  <text start="193.52" dur="6.12">would be getting information this week</text>
  <text start="195.77" dur="5.85">so John Solomon was corroborated on</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="4.95">Coates not even a day and a half later</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="5.58">and also said what Joe Jennifer is</text>
  <text start="204.59" dur="5.04">saying I personally I&amp;#39;m getting tired of</text>
  <text start="207.2" dur="3.27">waiting it&amp;#39;s getting old let&amp;#39;s get the</text>
  <text start="209.63" dur="2.91">show on the road</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="3.51">shall we but I wanted to play some of</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="3.03">this for you and then I wanted to go</text>
  <text start="213.98" dur="3.15">into some of the documents and some of</text>
  <text start="215.57" dur="3.09">the things that we could be talking</text>
  <text start="217.13" dur="3.45">about here especially when it comes to</text>
  <text start="218.66" dur="5.22">demmin nass so let&amp;#39;s get into it</text>
  <text start="220.58" dur="4.89">a real task and I know there are people</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="3.39">who are working work on it you talk a</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="3.15">lot about John Durham but I want to ask</text>
  <text start="227.27" dur="2.49">you about an announcement this weekend</text>
  <text start="228.62" dur="2.76">that the president made which is his</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="3.69">Director of National Intelligence Dan</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="4.56">Coates is leaving and it will be</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="4.17">replaced by Congressman John Ratcliffe</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="4.26">who was especially tough on Bob Waller</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="5.67">this past week does this replacement</text>
  <text start="240.2" dur="4.38">mean that we will much more quickly be</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="2.46">able to get to the bottom of what</text>
  <text start="244.58" dur="5.37">happened inside of our intelligence</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="5.76">community probably not Dan Coates is</text>
  <text start="249.95" dur="3.14">gone because he had outlived his</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="5.13">usefulness when he did that famous</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="7.09">interview out of the inn wherever that</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="5.58">was bent in Colorado where he made some</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="3.6">committee remarks about the President of</text>
  <text start="262.22" dur="4.81">the United States and Putin it was he</text>
  <text start="263.78" dur="5.71">was done that disrespectful performance</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="5.1">among friends at the Aspen Institute it</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="5.4">just came into my head was the end of</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="5.22">his job but here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the truth</text>
  <text start="274.89" dur="4.32">the reason Marv was given</text>
  <text start="277.35" dur="3.9">declassification authority was because</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="3.63">Coates was in the way as was Chris Rea</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="4.77">the FBI director they were fighting</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="5.12">tooth and nail phoney cover-ups</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="4.32">allegedly to protect sources and methods</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="4.99">when Chris rein was simply trying to</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="4.2">protect the FBI from just hugely</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="3.36">embarrassing details that are going to</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="4.5">come out by the way the declassification</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="4.5">process will start this week there are</text>
  <text start="299.04" dur="4.71">going to be documents released I think</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="4.35">by Wednesday the Attorney General as I</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="3.39">understand it is in the process of</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="3.39">getting those ready to come out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="4.02">going to be some of the Devon Nunez</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="4.5">documents that he requested and then a</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="2.1">series of other releases will come after</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="2.55">that</text>
  <text start="313.26" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s because Durham is progressing</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="4.08">very very quickly in his criminal</text>
  <text start="318" dur="4.08">investigation this is not a review</text>
  <text start="319.68" dur="6.03">quote/unquote of what went on this is a</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="5.03">criminal investigation of senior DOJ and</text>

  <text start="327.11" dur="4.54">administration and intelligence</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="4.62">community people including John Brennan</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="5.01">this is a federal grand jury this is not</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="5.07">a review this is not an IG audit this is</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="4.71">not some Congressional Research Service</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="5.07">look at history this is a criminal</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="5.22">investigation of a bunch of people who</text>

  <text start="442.349" dur="4.23">given him authorization to release it to</text>
  <text start="444.149" dur="4.32">whoever he wants whether it&amp;#39;s his people</text>
  <text start="446.579" dur="3.84">frankly perhaps people like Devin Nunez</text>
  <text start="448.469" dur="5.07">who was a star I agree</text>
  <text start="450.419" dur="4.62">Devin Nunez is a star hmm before we get</text>
  <text start="453.539" dur="3.39">into the new nesbitt I wanted to talk a</text>
  <text start="455.039" dur="5.19">bit about Ratcliffe I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="456.929" dur="5.94">want to talk about Coates because as of</text>
  <text start="460.229" dur="5.61">the 15th he is a foregone conclusion and</text>
  <text start="462.869" dur="5.28">I don&amp;#39;t particularly have a feeling</text>
  <text start="465.839" dur="3.93">either way right now I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="468.149" dur="3.24">evidence to support the fact that Trump</text>
  <text start="469.769" dur="3.48">needed him around I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="471.389" dur="4.71">evidence to support the fact that he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="473.249" dur="4.68">swamp rat I tend to lean more towards</text>
  <text start="476.099" dur="3.78">the latter only because he&amp;#39;s got the</text>
  <text start="477.929" dur="6.121">entire universe out there supporting him</text>
  <text start="479.879" dur="6.33">but I also don&amp;#39;t think listen this is</text>
  <text start="484.05" dur="4.5">what my gut told me my instinct told me</text>
  <text start="486.209" dur="3.75">this isn&amp;#39;t backed up by any factual</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="3.839">information it&amp;#39;s just where I went with</text>
  <text start="489.959" dur="4.68">it I personally felt they kept him there</text>
  <text start="492.389" dur="4.14">on purpose maybe he was being used in an</text>
  <text start="494.639" dur="4.44">Inspector General&amp;#39;s investigation maybe</text>
  <text start="496.529" dur="4.98">he was appointed by Trump he stuck</text>
  <text start="499.079" dur="3.81">around for this long he&amp;#39;s gone he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.509" dur="2.82">leaving the 15th if it was something</text>
  <text start="502.889" dur="4.17">really serious I think he&amp;#39;d be gone</text>
  <text start="504.329" dur="6">earlier I think Ratcliffe is a great</text>
  <text start="507.059" dur="5.34">choice to replace him for gazillion</text>
  <text start="510.329" dur="4.32">reasons one of which is he will not be</text>
  <text start="512.399" dur="3.841">stalling the release of documents like</text>
  <text start="514.649" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s been alleged that Coates has been</text>

  <text start="628.47" dur="5.73">said over the years since the Spygate</text>
  <text start="631.32" dur="6.6">scandal has been going on on June 17th</text>
  <text start="634.2" dur="5.43">2018 before Michael Horowitz was</text>
  <text start="637.92" dur="3.18">scheduled to testify in front of the</text>

  <text start="643.2" dur="6.45">met with Maria Bartiromo and gave his</text>
  <text start="647.459" dur="6.541">kind of summary or three main takeaways</text>
  <text start="649.65" dur="7.35">of what was in there because that report</text>
  <text start="654" dur="5.85">was criticized really really hard and a</text>
  <text start="657" dur="5.25">lot of people didn&amp;#39;t read the 565 pages</text>
  <text start="659.85" dur="4.14">and just looked at the conclusions and</text>
  <text start="662.25" dur="4.519">ran with them including the Democrats</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="6.259">who said look there was no nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="666.769" dur="6.24">an email investigation and look let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="670.249" dur="5.25">skip this part where the IG says that</text>
  <text start="673.009" dur="3.901">there was bias in the opening of the</text>
  <text start="675.499" dur="3.39">Russian investigation we&amp;#39;ll skip over</text>
  <text start="676.91" dur="5.159">that and we&amp;#39;ll just solely focus on the</text>
  <text start="678.889" dur="5.31">fact that the IG said there was no</text>
  <text start="682.069" dur="4.92">wrongdoing they could find in the</text>

  <text start="688.869" dur="4.96">Ratcliffe says in this interview the</text>
  <text start="691.22" dur="4.169">first thing is that it tells us that the</text>
  <text start="693.829" dur="2.91">problems the FBI in the Department of</text>
  <text start="695.389" dur="3.66">Justice were more pervasive and</text>
  <text start="696.739" dur="5.16">pervasive and problematic than any of us</text>
  <text start="699.049" dur="4.2">realized the second thing it confirms</text>
  <text start="701.899" dur="2.55">that even though Clinton should have</text>
  <text start="703.249" dur="3.09">been charged with mishandling classified</text>
  <text start="704.449" dur="4.531">information she was never really in</text>
  <text start="706.339" dur="5.1">danger of seeing that happen and it</text>
  <text start="708.98" dur="4.529">provides a factual basis to call into</text>
  <text start="711.439" dur="4.921">question the legitimacy of all the</text>
  <text start="713.509" dur="4.74">actions taken all the decisions made and</text>
  <text start="716.36" dur="3.839">all of the evidence gathered in the</text>

  <text start="720.199" dur="5.73">investigation based on who was in charge</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="4.889">of that investigation they then talked</text>
  <text start="725.929" dur="4.56">about the text messages between Paige</text>

  <text start="734.299" dur="3.45">he&amp;#39;s not sure that the FBI could have</text>
  <text start="736.129" dur="3.361">chosen anyone worse to lead that</text>

  <text start="771.199" dur="8.43">Ratcliffe has been very much on board</text>
  <text start="776.929" dur="4.95">with Trump even though he may not have</text>
  <text start="779.629" dur="4.05">agreed with him in the beginning he</text>
  <text start="781.879" dur="3.661">never said anything like that that I</text>
  <text start="783.679" dur="3.87">could find anyway all he said was</text>
  <text start="785.54" dur="3.93">Trump&amp;#39;s the nominee I will support the</text>
  <text start="787.549" dur="4.65">nominee there is no way that the</text>
  <text start="789.47" dur="5.119">alternative is any better and the rest</text>
  <text start="792.199" dur="5.281">is history he was also in the running</text>
  <text start="794.589" dur="4.72">allegedly I&amp;#39;ll say again because there</text>
  <text start="797.48" dur="3.06">were rumors but he was also in the</text>
  <text start="799.309" dur="4.441">running to be a</text>
  <text start="800.54" dur="6.63">Attorney General with William bar it was</text>
  <text start="803.75" dur="4.53">him Ratcliffe and I think I forgot who</text>
  <text start="807.17" dur="2.82">the other one was there were three of</text>
  <text start="808.28" dur="3.99">them in the running I&amp;#39;ve got a couple</text>
  <text start="809.99" dur="4.14">more notable things you guys can scour</text>
  <text start="812.27" dur="4.17">the internet and find countless examples</text>
  <text start="814.13" dur="3.96">of Ratcliffe being on the right side of</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="3.42">the spy gate story and being on the side</text>
  <text start="818.09" dur="3.63">of transparency in working with Nunez</text>
  <text start="819.86" dur="3.39">and his counterparts and you can take a</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="3.21">look at what he did to Muller the other</text>
  <text start="823.25" dur="3.81">day and you just you know that where</text>
  <text start="824.93" dur="3.6">this guy is is the DNI this is just the</text>
  <text start="827.06" dur="3.65">best thing we could possibly have ever</text>
  <text start="828.53" dur="4.74">asked for</text>
  <text start="830.71" dur="5.47">Ratcliffe told Fox &amp;amp; Friends on Sunday</text>
  <text start="833.27" dur="4.41">morning the indictment of 13 Russians by</text>
  <text start="836.18" dur="3.83">special counsel Muller was good news for</text>
  <text start="837.68" dur="4.5">the president again this is February</text>
  <text start="840.01" dur="3.76">remember the charge to Bob Muller was to</text>
  <text start="842.18" dur="3.03">investigate whether or not the Russians</text>
  <text start="843.77" dur="2.76">interfere with the election and whether</text>
  <text start="845.21" dur="3.57">or not there were any links to the Trump</text>
  <text start="846.53" dur="3.75">campaign the indictment lays out for the</text>
  <text start="848.78" dur="3.03">first time the Russians actually did</text>
  <text start="850.28" dur="4.35">interfere and meddle in the election but</text>
  <text start="851.81" dur="4.35">very clear it lays out how no Americans</text>
  <text start="854.63" dur="3.15">including anyone involved with the Trump</text>
  <text start="856.16" dur="3.87">team was wittingly involved in this</text>
  <text start="857.78" dur="3.66">particular conspiracy as far as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="860.03" dur="3.78">concerned and I&amp;#39;ve said this on the</text>
  <text start="861.44" dur="5.22">podcast a gazillion times now I&amp;#39;m of the</text>
  <text start="863.81" dur="6.12">firm belief that we are not going to get</text>
  <text start="866.66" dur="4.89">the truth about the DNC server and the</text>
  <text start="869.93" dur="4.55">only way we&amp;#39;ll get the truth about the</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="7.74">DNC server is if the Assange arrest is</text>
  <text start="874.48" dur="7.95">in any way tied to exposing that if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="879.29" dur="6.87">tied to covering it up it&amp;#39;s gonna take</text>
  <text start="882.43" dur="5.38">people just not letting it go in order</text>
  <text start="886.16" dur="4.23">to get it out into the public sphere on</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="4.5">a massive scale because the answer is</text>
  <text start="890.39" dur="11.64">we&amp;#39;re being given are not satisfactory</text>
  <text start="892.31" dur="12.57">at all at all one more here Ratcliffe on</text>
  <text start="902.03" dur="5.46">bartiromo again discussing the</text>
  <text start="904.88" dur="3.93">deposition of Peter struck back in June</text>
  <text start="907.49" dur="3.12">again of 2018</text>
  <text start="908.81" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s a central figure in both these</text>
  <text start="910.61" dur="4.41">cases he was involved on both the law</text>
  <text start="913.37" dur="3.15">enforcement side and the intelligence</text>
  <text start="915.02" dur="3.3">side so you know we&amp;#39;ve taken a lot of</text>
  <text start="916.52" dur="3.15">testimony from a lot of folks and if his</text>
  <text start="918.32" dur="3.39">is inconsistent with that it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="919.67" dur="3.99">raise more questions he doesn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="921.71" dur="3.72">have to explain away one or two bad text</text>
  <text start="923.66" dur="3.93">messages there are hundreds of hateful</text>
  <text start="925.43" dur="5.01">text messages that can&amp;#39;t be taken out of</text>
  <text start="927.59" dur="5.04">context and how he explains those could</text>
  <text start="930.44" dur="3.96">impact his legal jeopardy and may also</text>

  <text start="1517.85" dur="5.28">to come and testify this is up there too</text>
  <text start="1520.22" dur="6.54">but basically what their</text>
  <text start="1523.13" dur="6.45">looking for or what Nunez could have has</text>
  <text start="1526.76" dur="5.25">to do with FISA has to do with 302s and</text>
  <text start="1529.58" dur="5.43">interviews between all these people has</text>
  <text start="1532.01" dur="6.45">to do with how the the whole spy gate</text>
  <text start="1535.01" dur="5.88">thing started and as Jo digenova says</text>
  <text start="1538.46" dur="4.32">apparently there is a grand jury</text>
  <text start="1540.89" dur="4.05">investigation going on right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1542.78" dur="4.32">not just a review there&amp;#39;s a grand jury</text>
  <text start="1544.94" dur="5.88">impaneled which leads me to my next</text>
  <text start="1547.1" dur="9.21">statement if what jo digenova says is</text>
  <text start="1550.82" dur="7.56">true then the reports of durham meeting</text>
  <text start="1556.31" dur="5.67">with Christopher Steele could have been</text>
  <text start="1558.38" dur="11.43">in regards to the criminal referral that</text>
  <text start="1561.98" dur="12.56">was made against him years ago Grassley</text>

  <text start="1579.08" dur="7.44">investigation into Christopher steel</text>

  <text start="1593.48" dur="10.35">Steele talking to Durham a Sunday Times</text>
  <text start="1601.37" dur="3.78">report said the British ex-spy agreed to</text>

  <text start="1605.15" dur="4.08">preconditions were met and strongly</text>

  <text start="1609.23" dur="6.57">Department Inspector General Michael</text>
  <text start="1610.61" dur="8.76">Horowitz I would think that I lean more</text>
  <text start="1615.8" dur="5.64">towards Durham in this case especially</text>
  <text start="1619.37" dur="7.98">given the criminal referrals now I</text>
  <text start="1621.44" dur="8.94">believe I believe that Margaux Cleveland</text>
  <text start="1627.35" dur="6.03">from the Federalists did a piece where</text>
  <text start="1630.38" dur="5.7">she used some of the redactions</text>
  <text start="1633.38" dur="4.5">and the reasons for them to prove that</text>
  <text start="1636.08" dur="4.11">they had let Christopher steel off the</text>
  <text start="1637.88" dur="3.96">hook and I had a disagreement with that</text>
  <text start="1640.19" dur="3.51">piece when it came out and we talked</text>
  <text start="1641.84" dur="4.56">about it and we weren&amp;#39;t able to come to</text>
  <text start="1643.7" dur="6.33">a conclusion where one of us swayed the</text>
  <text start="1646.4" dur="5.43">other either way and I&amp;#39;m just kind of</text>
  <text start="1650.03" dur="5.76">recalling this as I said as I think</text>
  <text start="1651.83" dur="5.699">about it right now however even though</text>
  <text start="1655.79" dur="4.469">Christopher Steele is over</text>
  <text start="1657.529" dur="4.59">he can be indicted here and if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1660.259" dur="3.811">indicted here then he can&amp;#39;t come back</text>
  <text start="1662.119" dur="3.3">here and given that apparently a lot of</text>
  <text start="1664.07" dur="3.179">his business dealings have to do with</text>
  <text start="1665.419" dur="3.271">America which I think he should be</text>
  <text start="1667.249" dur="3.571">barred from doing anything here for the</text>
  <text start="1668.69" dur="3.479">rest of his damn life that would be a</text>
  <text start="1670.82" dur="4.079">problem for him to have an arrest</text>
  <text start="1672.169" dur="5.46">warrant out for him in in America not a</text>
  <text start="1674.899" dur="4.86">good not a good look so I think</text>
  <text start="1677.629" dur="4.081">personally the durum is interviewing</text>
  <text start="1679.759" dur="3.691">steel on behalf of the criminal referral</text>
  <text start="1681.71" dur="5.159">that was issued by Graham and Grassley</text>
  <text start="1683.45" dur="5.28">years ago and again there may have been</text>
  <text start="1686.869" dur="4.14">some reporting that that had been put to</text>
  <text start="1688.73" dur="3.12">bed but I don&amp;#39;t necessarily believe that</text>
  <text start="1691.009" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s the case</text>
  <text start="1691.85" dur="8.039">similarly Christopher Steele could be</text>
  <text start="1695.119" dur="8.071">asking could be asking for immunity or a</text>
  <text start="1699.889" dur="6.36">proffer or something of that nature to</text>
  <text start="1703.19" dur="5.099">be able to shield himself from</text>
  <text start="1706.249" dur="4.17">wrongdoing but what I do know is that</text>
  <text start="1708.289" dur="4.77">whatever was said to Durham made its way</text>
  <text start="1710.419" dur="4.38">back to Horowitz because the OIG report</text>
