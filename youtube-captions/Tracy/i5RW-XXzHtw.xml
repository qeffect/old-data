  <text start="476.07" dur="5.55">current employees that&amp;#39;s what they do</text>
  <text start="478.8" dur="5.69">that is why sessions brought Hoover on</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="6.27">in the early stages of this to work with</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="5.26">Horowitz on the FISA investigation so</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="4.26">one of the things that was inside of</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="5.31">this article from real clear</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="5.22">investigations that people are really</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="4.41">freaking out about was that again</text>
  <text start="497.37" dur="4.14">Michael Horowitz donated when</text>
  <text start="499.47" dur="3.96">volunteered when he was in college</text>
  <text start="501.51" dur="8.54">just on the political campaign of</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="9.51">several Democrats and then he donated to</text>
  <text start="510.05" dur="5.429">Colorado Senator Michael Bennet at some</text>
  <text start="512.94" dur="5.64">point in his life which were not told a</text>
  <text start="515.479" dur="5.051">former colleague were not told when who</text>
  <text start="518.58" dur="3.33">was seeking the 2020 Democratic</text>
  <text start="520.53" dur="3.6">presidential nomination</text>
  <text start="521.91" dur="5.28">and doesn&amp;#39;t like Trump and now because</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="7.11">of this we yes because he&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="527.19" dur="5.22">government employee and then somebody</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="7.38">else is that like Carter Paige wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="9.39">interviewed yes so um anyway he can talk</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="6.81">to people if he so Michael Horowitz can</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="5.61">go and talk to somebody or you know if</text>

  <text start="547.41" dur="3.24">sure that that&amp;#39;s the case but if he</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="3.27">doesn&amp;#39;t need to he doesn&amp;#39;t ask to</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="3.84">because it&amp;#39;s very much outside of scope</text>
  <text start="552.45" dur="4.65">and Carter Paige was never a government</text>
  <text start="554.49" dur="4.65">quote employee so he&amp;#39;s really way</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="4.17">outside of his jurisdiction he may have</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="3.72">been an informant and a paid one but he</text>
  <text start="561.27" dur="4.65">was never an employee of the government</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="7.86">way outside of his jurisdiction again if</text>
  <text start="565.92" dur="7.08">I am speaking off off I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not</text>

  <text start="2585.17" dur="5.13">many other big things that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2587.48" dur="6.45">want to open an investigate or put him</text>
  <text start="2590.3" dur="5.52">on on it put him in court for this when</text>
