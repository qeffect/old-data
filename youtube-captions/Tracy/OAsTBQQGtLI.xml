  <text start="29.599" dur="6.211">you guys an explanation of what that</text>
  <text start="32.47" dur="5.26">anomaly could have been in the texts</text>
  <text start="35.81" dur="4.2">that we were just talking about in my</text>
  <text start="37.73" dur="3.24">livestream a second ago but I also I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="40.01" dur="5.1">going to show you a couple of other</text>
  <text start="40.97" dur="7.7">things as well so here&amp;#39;s the deal I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="45.11" dur="6.75">human being like all of you guys are and</text>
  <text start="48.67" dur="5.2">sometimes I make errors and I have a lot</text>
  <text start="51.86" dur="3.78">going on and so my brain is just not</text>
  <text start="53.87" dur="5.07">functioning as sharply as it normally</text>
  <text start="55.64" dur="6.6">does that being said I also feel like I</text>
  <text start="58.94" dur="5.549">need to definitely call myself out</text>
  <text start="62.24" dur="3.78">immediately as soon as I notice that</text>
  <text start="64.489" dur="4.501">there&amp;#39;s a possibility that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="66.02" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;ve said can&amp;#39;t it is explained by</text>
  <text start="68.99" dur="5.16">something else and this is one of those</text>
  <text start="70.55" dur="5.37">times so I would much rather do this and</text>
  <text start="74.15" dur="4.08">have somebody say oh that girl she was</text>
  <text start="75.92" dur="4.89">careless then not do this just to save</text>
  <text start="78.23" dur="3.15">face because that&amp;#39;s not why we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="80.81" dur="2.7">right</text>
  <text start="81.38" dur="4.5">I mean honestly we&amp;#39;re here to learn and</text>
  <text start="83.51" dur="5.27">to get things right and I try really</text>
  <text start="85.88" dur="5.55">hard to get things right all the time</text>
  <text start="88.78" dur="5.71">sadly that doesn&amp;#39;t happen all the time</text>
  <text start="91.43" dur="9.6">and I do make mistakes so here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="94.49" dur="9.989">deal the discrepancy in the let&amp;#39;s open</text>
  <text start="101.03" dur="5.46">it up and just take a look at it the</text>
  <text start="104.479" dur="4.381">discrepancy in these text messages I was</text>
  <text start="106.49" dur="4.44">telling you about earlier with Felix</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="6.45">aider and Michael Cohen in terms of the</text>
  <text start="110.93" dur="6.66">timestamp a lot of people were saying</text>
  <text start="115.31" dur="6.47">wait a second that that&amp;#39;s explainable</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="9.03">and and here&amp;#39;s how if it had just turned</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="6.25">115 p.m. right and then I&amp;#39;m just finding</text>
  <text start="126.62" dur="3.02">the page I know you guys get seasick</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="4.03">when I scroll I&amp;#39;m really sorry</text>
  <text start="129.64" dur="5.63">hold on here we go</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="6.63">if it had just turned 115 and he was on</text>
  <text start="135.27" dur="8.579">the phone already for six minutes and 44</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="8.34">seconds and then it turned there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="143.849" dur="5.551">minute and 16 seconds between us six</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="5.58">minutes and 44 seconds and eight minutes</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="7.82">so if it had just turned 115 you would</text>
  <text start="152.61" dur="7.95">have had 60 seconds from 115 to 116 and</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="5.68">then you could have still been within</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="4.83">the moment within the sixteenth minute</text>
  <text start="162.9" dur="10.14">and had this call be at eight minutes in</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="13.17">length am I making sense I hope I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="8.4">making sense again if it had just turned</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="5.009">115 or even had turned 115 within the</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="4.079">past 15 seconds and this screenshot was</text>
  <text start="183.569" dur="5.911">taken and he had been on the phone for</text>
  <text start="185.519" dur="5.881">six minutes and 44 seconds I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="2.819">address the kids Inc documentary when</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="2.97">I&amp;#39;m done okay</text>
  <text start="192.299" dur="3.421">because porkchop has been around talking</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="2.97">about this and I&amp;#39;ve been answering as</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="4.139">respectfully as possible but I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="5.13">just get that off my chest at one minute</text>
  <text start="199.859" dur="4.591">I&amp;#39;m sorry at one hour 1:15 if he had</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="4.92">just gotten on the phone within like 15</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="5.099">seconds between then and he was on the</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="4.83">phone for 6 minutes and 44 seconds and</text>
  <text start="209.549" dur="5.131">then all of a sudden it you know it</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="4.889">turns one 16 and it&amp;#39;s eight minutes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="6.119">been on the call it&amp;#39;s still possible for</text>
  <text start="217.109" dur="6.481">it to be somewhere like between 1:16 and</text>
  <text start="220.799" dur="7.141">one second and 1:16 and thirty seconds</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="8.459">and you would still be within the window</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="7.139">that that would make sense so I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="5.761">think of that i sat here and</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="5.91">triple-checked myself like 17 times and</text>
  <text start="237.81" dur="5.31">my maths my math challenged brain didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="5.041">put that together but as soon as I was</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="7.19">alerted to that I updated folks on my</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="4.28">Twitter and said here&amp;#39;s the possibility</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="5.539">this is a couple</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="3.75">things that I found in there though that</text>
  <text start="256.269" dur="4.68">led me to think this in the first place</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="4.2">so like I was recording the video going</text>
  <text start="260.949" dur="3.961">through just the information and I</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="4.95">zoomed in so that you guys would have a</text>
  <text start="264.91" dur="4.56">better look at the documents and when I</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="4.38">zoomed in I started noticing all these</text>
  <text start="269.47" dur="6.919">weird anomalies and that led me to</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="4.489">really critique what I was seeing right</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="6.34">here is one of them this is page 230</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="5.25">which we&amp;#39;ll go to in the original</text>
  <text start="283" dur="8.91">document okay if you look here at like</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="8.731">telling and the s here in second and the</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="6.99">C and the I and this C and this R and</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="6.3">this I you can see a clear difference</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="5.97">between these letters and the ones next</text>
  <text start="302.2" dur="4.439">to them right so I was like what the</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="5.81">heck is this noise all about this is</text>
  <text start="306.639" dur="7.831">really weird so I I kept looking on</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="4.9">here&amp;#39;s another one same thing that is so</text>
  <text start="314.47" dur="3.12">now I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of graphic</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="3.57">designers weighing in on my tweet saying</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="5.13">yeah you know what you&amp;#39;re here right</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="5.579">there&amp;#39;s definitely anomalies in this do</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="4.169">they change the context is the question</text>
  <text start="324.729" dur="4.771">it doesn&amp;#39;t appear so but why is somebody</text>
  <text start="326.889" dur="6.451">in there making these edits so here we</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="7.11">go here&amp;#39;s another one you can see that</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="5.28">these letters are more are more bright</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="4.619">in white than the rest of them are here</text>
  <text start="338.62" dur="4.79">in this tweet I mean in this text and</text>
  <text start="341.229" dur="5.331">then if you look to this other text</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="6.28">they&amp;#39;re all uniform oops</text>
  <text start="346.56" dur="4.69">so there are anomalies in here that I</text>
  <text start="349.69" dur="3.59">don&amp;#39;t understand and I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="351.25" dur="4.68">ever get an answer to to be quite honest</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="7.359">but let&amp;#39;s just take a look through here</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="7.799">if we can yes I am shadow band I&amp;#39;m just</text>

  <text start="411.74" dur="4.59">there are definitely weird textual</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="3.39">anomalies inside of these text messages</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="3.03">and they&amp;#39;re coming from BuzzFeed and I</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="6.45">don&amp;#39;t believe a thing that BuzzFeed says</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="6.9">so there you go I&amp;#39;m just looking at it</text>
  <text start="424.28" dur="3.33">from that perspective so as I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="426.26" dur="3.06">to read this information</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="2.82">Izu min to give you guys a better view</text>

  <text start="454.04" dur="4.8">there that I want people to have and to</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="4.74">delete that would be a travesty because</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="3.54">I spent like almost an hour in some</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="3.63">minutes on it and I really don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="462.38" dur="4.65">delete it but I will make sure either in</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="5.82">a pin comment or both that people see</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="5.01">this okay secondly a lot of people</text>
  <text start="469.97" dur="3.72">actually not a lot of people just a few</text>

  <text start="473.69" dur="4.79">about the kids ank documentary here&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="482.03" dur="4.74">for it I had known her for a good long</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="4.26">while she was a great researcher did a</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="3.93">lot of good work I helped her to raise</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="4.14">money for it by just telling my subs if</text>
  <text start="490.7" dur="5.67">you want to donate to this she&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="5.4">a documentary about you know all these</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="4.08">topics that I won&amp;#39;t name because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="4.35">want to get too monetized again and that</text>
  <text start="500.45" dur="6.12">was literally the extent of it I have</text>

  <text start="508.22" dur="3.15">disappeared</text>
  <text start="509.42" dur="4.17">like literally the extent of the</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="4.17">information I have there was like one</text>
  <text start="513.59" dur="5.01">person on Twitter accusing me of</text>

  <text start="518.6" dur="4.05">okay</text>
  <text start="519.41" dur="6.15">don&amp;#39;t accuse me of being a thief of all</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="5.4">things I had literally no financial gain</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="6.72">from that movie whatsoever as a matter</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="6.54">of fact I donated to it also okay so if</text>

  <text start="542.72" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s the case but I haven&amp;#39;t been able</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="4.95">to get a comment from her so until I can</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="4.23">find her I can&amp;#39;t respond to any further</text>
