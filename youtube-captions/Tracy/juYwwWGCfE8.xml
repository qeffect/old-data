  <text start="91.14" dur="5.519">to share their story unfiltered one of</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="4.44">the things we spoke about before the</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="4.831">interview was that they they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="99.78" dur="7.799">really been able to tell their story</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="7.71">without being interrupted and there was</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="3.511">a lot of information that they wanted to</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="4.89">get out that they haven&amp;#39;t had the</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="6.919">opportunity to get out as of yet so a</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="7.349">little bit of just business first I did</text>
  <text start="118.009" dur="8.14">change this I did a couple of live</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="6.241">stream videos this morning for when Mike</text>

  <text start="131.19" dur="3.21">media this morning</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.53">with his interview and the live stream</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="6.18">the the stream the service was really</text>
  <text start="136.86" dur="5.37">bad I just deleted them all off of my</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="4.68">channel because they were useless but I</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="5.07">do want to say I am gonna upload the raw</text>

  <text start="153.87" dur="4.62">upfront with everybody right now when I</text>
  <text start="156.48" dur="6.15">think it&amp;#39;s so valuable it needs to get</text>
  <text start="158.49" dur="7.53">up there immediately so the sound is</text>
  <text start="162.63" dur="7.2">poor the sound quality is poor you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="5.79">gonna need to raise your volume up very</text>
  <text start="169.83" dur="5.16">very high because Simona is very</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="6.3">soft-spoken and so it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard</text>
  <text start="174.99" dur="8.43">for you guys to hear but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="7.56">feel like not um not uploading it would</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="5.73">be kind of detrimental to for everybody</text>
