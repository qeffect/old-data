  <text start="0.11" dur="8.529">good afternoon it is 308 p.m. Eastern</text>
  <text start="3.659" dur="9.991">Time on Tuesday 1120 2018 I came across</text>
  <text start="8.639" dur="6.991">this last night and I just was beside</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="4.29">myself and I&amp;#39;m sure that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="15.63" dur="4.77">are talking about this this is Celine</text>
  <text start="17.94" dur="4.14">Dion&amp;#39;s new genderless clothing line and</text>
  <text start="20.4" dur="3.6">when she announced that she was gonna do</text>
  <text start="22.08" dur="3.84">a genderless clothing line I said oh</text>
  <text start="24" dur="5.22">there goes another celebrity just</text>
  <text start="25.92" dur="5.759">destroying everything that is natural in</text>
  <text start="29.22" dur="5.519">the world in my opinion there are two</text>
  <text start="31.679" dur="5.161">genders male and female it&amp;#39;s not a bad</text>
  <text start="34.739" dur="4.111">thing if girls dress like girls and the</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="4.02">clothes are fit to their bodies and boys</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="8.24">dressed like boys and the closer fit to</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="9.449">their bodies just saying but hey</text>
  <text start="47.09" dur="5.14">so she&amp;#39;s partnered up with nu nu nu</text>
  <text start="50.309" dur="4.261">which was an existing brand that was</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="5.73">founded by two women who were both moms</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="5.28">and they&amp;#39;ve been really popular with</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="3.48">celebrities and they have a whole page</text>
  <text start="59.85" dur="4.379">on their website dedicated to their</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="5.34">celebrity clientele and I did a ton of</text>
  <text start="64.229" dur="4.831">research into this today and I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="3.72">honest with you I don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="3.33">sharing a lot of it not because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.5" dur="4.409">wrong but because it&amp;#39;s so loose like</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="5.43">there are so many loose knots or loose</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="4.921">connections that I feel like presenting</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="4.229">what I found would be irresponsible so I</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="4.17">decided instead of doing that</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="3.481">first of all we&amp;#39;ll wait a little while</text>
  <text start="84" dur="3.96">because they always out themselves</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="4.32">eventually second of all I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="4.56">over this video with you guys show you</text>

  <text start="101.159" dur="3.361">gonna end the video because I mean I</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t think that you&amp;#39;re gonna need me to</text>

  <text start="456.19" dur="3.54">Dion was somewhat wholesome figure and a</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="3.69">music business that is heavily bent on</text>
  <text start="459.73" dur="3.57">depravity however since the death of her</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="3.12">husband and manager she&amp;#39;s been involved</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="3.27">in increasing weirdness</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="3.78">since wrapping up her Las Vegas</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="4.14">residency Celine apparently found a new</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="4.02">mission to free newborns from gender</text>
  <text start="470.71" dur="4.41">binary because that was the main</text>

  <text start="494.47" dur="2.91">I will go to their website and go</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="3.42">through that with you in a minute I did</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="4.41">I did do a lot of research into these</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="5.7">people today a lot of what they do in</text>
  <text start="501.79" dur="6.63">their clothing is is directly tied to</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="4.89">art surprise I looked into the artists</text>
  <text start="508.42" dur="3.9">that were behind some of those demon</text>
  <text start="509.98" dur="4.86">dolls that were in the cribs he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="4.74">you know it&amp;#39;s weird but it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="514.84" dur="7.829">anything that&amp;#39;s like oh my gosh look at</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="9.15">this you know it so it&amp;#39;s weird and then</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="5.971">the guy who introduced these two is a</text>
  <text start="526.21" dur="8.09">director who happened to do a video for</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="8.76">an Israeli child like assistance</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="6.76">organization that aids with people and</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="5.46">child trafficking but that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="541.06" dur="4.23">thing he did for them and and he&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="542.86" dur="4.17">acclaimed director so I can&amp;#39;t I said I</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="5.37">told you guys anyway I can&amp;#39;t pull that</text>
  <text start="547.03" dur="5.49">and be like look it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="4.5">it could be a coincidence there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="552.52" dur="3.72">to know you know honestly and you know</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="3.87">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna say do you believe in</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="3.99">coincidences yes I do sometimes that</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="2.7">could be a coincidence</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="2.88">you know he could be thinking he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="561.73" dur="4.32">something good he you know he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="4.56">lots of other work and none of it at all</text>
  <text start="566.05" dur="3.27">suggests to me that this guy is</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="3.21">nefarious in any way and he&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="569.32" dur="2.6">who would juice introduced the two moms</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="4.43">together started</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="6.659">beneath ATS the artists are artists and</text>
  <text start="575.31" dur="5.7">their art while questionable sometimes</text>
  <text start="578.579" dur="3.991">it is nothing like what we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="581.01" dur="3.36">the past on Wikileaks and things like</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="3.959">that so let&amp;#39;s just get that other way it</text>
  <text start="584.37" dur="4.95">seems to me personally after spending a</text>
  <text start="586.529" dur="5.881">good solid five or six hours researching</text>
  <text start="589.32" dur="4.74">here that this brand went all out</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="4.71">when Celine Dion joined with them</text>
