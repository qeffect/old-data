  <text start="115.68" dur="5.82">justifiable question and concern I was</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="3.78">trained as a physician I was a</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="3.57">government medical degree from</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="3.991">Northwestern University in Chicago did</text>

  <text start="127.14" dur="2.88">of Michigan and actually did a</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="3.739">fellowship and shoulder reconstructive</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="3.69">surgery and sports medicine in Canada I</text>
  <text start="131.959" dur="4.391">thought that&amp;#39;s what was</text>
  <text start="133.71" dur="5.28">gonna be my fellowship which it was but</text>
  <text start="136.35" dur="6.18">I actually got a significant background</text>
  <text start="138.99" dur="5.76">in national healthcare delivery and</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="4.47">healthcare policy while I was up there</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="4.23">it was completely inadvertent and it was</text>
  <text start="147" dur="4.83">a huge education because you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="148.98" dur="4.65">Canada because I was in Canada in a</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="4.47">single-payer system at a national</text>
  <text start="153.63" dur="4.74">healthcare approach and and it was an</text>
  <text start="156.3" dur="4.5">incredible incredibly enlightening</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="5.4">experience and I had a background in</text>
  <text start="160.8" dur="5.7">economics one of my majors in in college</text>
  <text start="163.77" dur="4.98">I two majors chemistry and economics in</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="4.32">throughout my work in medicine and my</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.23">research I always have an economic</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="6.9">component looking at costs and the like</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="7.89">and I mentioned I became an orthopedic</text>
  <text start="177.72" dur="6.75">surgeon and was working in the sports</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="6.39">medicine world and I also at the same</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="7.44">time was working in the research world</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="6.63">the clinical research world and this is</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="3.66">actually I spoke about this in the book</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="4.17">I wrote The Awakening resurgent but I</text>
  <text start="195.57" dur="5.84">really haven&amp;#39;t gone into depth and on</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="5.28">any other show including actually my own</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="4.68">so maybe we should touch on there right</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="5.58">now I was at a crossroads in my career</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="5.04">focusing on developing operations to</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="4.89">help people once they were injured and</text>
  <text start="211.13" dur="4.84">on the prevention side of the equation</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="6.41">trying to prevent people from sustaining</text>
  <text start="215.97" dur="7.43">an injury and I was at a crossroads and</text>
  <text start="220.22" dur="6.88">many people say well Dave why did you</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="6.91">choose to put all your eggs in the</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="8.55">basket of prevention from your research</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="7.05">standpoint and here is why I am</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="6.33">fortunate to be the father of two</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="6.12">daughters and at the time we had one</text>
  <text start="241.98" dur="4.2">daughters before a second daughter</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="7.52">obviously was born and she was about 11</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="8.55">months old and she became critically ill</text>
  <text start="251" dur="4.27">and in fact her bone marrow stopped</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="5.16">functioning</text>
  <text start="255.27" dur="10.17">oh gosh Wow and the concern was that she</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="7.48">either had a malignancy a cancer of her</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.84">bone marrow</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="4.23">or a significant viral attack of her</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="3.24">bone marrow that made it stop</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="4.65">functioning both bad the worst obviously</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="4.8">being the cancer so she progressively</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="8.31">got worse was hospitalized and at one</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="9.96">point she lost consciousness and my</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="7.94">friends who were taking care of her came</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="4.22">to myself and my wife and said that</text>
  <text start="292.71" dur="5.11">there&amp;#39;s nothing else we can do and we</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="6.93">don&amp;#39;t think this looks good</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="9.81">that&amp;#39;s scary yeah it was really the low</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="6.33">point of my life which actually then</text>
  <text start="307.63" dur="6.539">something happened which has never</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="6.63">happened to me prior to that or since in</text>
  <text start="314.169" dur="5.041">a sense that what I did is I did what</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="6.209">thousands of parents do in children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="5.97">hospitals in the United States and</text>
  <text start="322.419" dur="6.571">around the world every year I took her</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="7.38">out of her crib and of which she was</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="9.32">unresponsive and the only person in the</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="8.539">room was my dad I said a prayer and I</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="8.5">asked God to take my life and not hers</text>
  <text start="341.099" dur="11.741">and something happened Tracy as I said</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="8.789">this prayer I heard this voice now I</text>
  <text start="352.84" dur="5.4">have to say um in some of my immediate</text>
  <text start="355.599" dur="5.431">friends after this happened and I told</text>

  <text start="361.03" dur="7.169">know Dave we lucked people up your</text>
  <text start="365.229" dur="6.12">voices thank you for stopping me from</text>

  <text start="371.349" dur="9.511">them as well not this voice and the</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="7.65">voice said as I said this prayer to take</text>

  <text start="480.849" dur="6">to me you know Dave why did you do what</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="5.34">you do you know you from the minute you</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="6.481">started on the prevention mode you you</text>
  <text start="489.58" dur="7.17">upset people in big medicine in the AMA</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="5.28">and the pharmaceutical industry in the</text>
  <text start="496.75" dur="4.11">hospital industry and the insurance</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="4.41">industry because if you prevent people</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="3.779">from getting injured they don&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="4.619">the doc they don&amp;#39;t go to the hospital</text>
  <text start="504.639" dur="4.65">you don&amp;#39;t need medications and and you</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="4.471">cost a lot of people a lot of money</text>
  <text start="509.289" dur="4.74">based on the research you do why do you</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="4.26">do this and on top of that you get all</text>
  <text start="514.029" dur="5.06">these threats for doing the right thing</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="5.099">there the special interests are</text>
  <text start="519.089" dur="4.541">threatened to sue you they threatened to</text>

  <text start="545.47" dur="5.58">make a difference what year was this</text>
  <text start="548.459" dur="5.021">1980-1989 it&amp;#39;s almost the same way</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="4.8">chiropractic was looked at as nonsense</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="4.5">sort of right I mean you know prevention</text>
  <text start="555.85" dur="6.21">is kind of a dirty word in your interest</text>
  <text start="557.98" dur="6.27">oh no I wish to I wish you were wrong</text>
  <text start="562.06" dur="4.949">and I could argue with you but you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="589.449" dur="3.091">these people were jumping on board</text>
  <text start="590.769" dur="4.32">helped Tracey over the years we produced</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="5.13">dozens and dozens of studies that made</text>
  <text start="595.089" dur="4.86">it made a huge difference you know just</text>
  <text start="597.67" dur="3.539">one of our studies that we started at</text>
  <text start="599.949" dur="3.301">the University of Michigan then carried</text>
  <text start="601.209" dur="3.891">over to the Institute according to</text>
  <text start="603.25" dur="4.62">federal government has prevented 1.7</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="5.679">million people every year from being</text>

  <text start="714.129" dur="4.861">because nobody wants to look at this so</text>
  <text start="717.04" dur="4.649">we did and and we got a team together</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="4.139">and actually some research scientists at</text>
  <text start="721.689" dur="2.611">General Motors research labs because</text>
  <text start="723.129" dur="2.94">they were actually looking at when</text>
  <text start="724.3" dur="3.93">airbags hit the chest and how some</text>
  <text start="726.069" dur="4.02">people were dying now we found out it</text>
  <text start="728.23" dur="4.919">was the same scenario what we found to</text>
  <text start="730.089" dur="5.1">make a long story short is that if the</text>
  <text start="733.149" dur="5.04">impact occurs at the right whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="735.189" dur="4.38">an airbag or whether it&amp;#39;s a baseball if</text>

  <text start="746.699" dur="4.841">you have to thump the chest or better</text>
  <text start="749.559" dur="4.111">yet get one of those defibrillators</text>
  <text start="751.54" dur="3.959">automatic external defibrillators which</text>
  <text start="753.67" dur="4.05">are actually pretty prevalent now yeah</text>
  <text start="755.499" dur="4.02">and shock the chest and you can bring</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="4.38">somebody back to life so let me give me</text>
  <text start="759.519" dur="6.3">an example of the impact of empowerment</text>
  <text start="762.1" dur="5.909">of individuals with education uh I wrote</text>
  <text start="765.819" dur="3.45">a book called the awakening research and</text>
  <text start="768.009" dur="3.3">I wrote him the book</text>
  <text start="769.269" dur="3.66">I didn&amp;#39;t especially want to write the</text>
  <text start="771.309" dur="3.811">book but I did because a lot of my</text>
  <text start="772.929" dur="4.291">friends said you know Dave you have to</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="4.709">let people know about not only the what</text>

  <text start="801.07" dur="4.769">talked about prevention but we talked</text>
  <text start="803.98" dur="3.479">about this chest impact scenario now</text>
  <text start="805.839" dur="4.581">here&amp;#39;s the best buy there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="807.459" dur="7.171">good things about doing her show but</text>
  <text start="810.42" dur="7.21">here was the best part we talked about</text>
  <text start="814.63" dur="5.67">this and two weeks after her show aired</text>
  <text start="817.63" dur="3.899">a 13 year old boy in the substance cago</text>

  <text start="852.63" dur="3.73">what happened here and they were like</text>
  <text start="854.74" dur="3.719">well he got hit in the chest and we</text>
  <text start="856.36" dur="3.08">tried to provide the CPR and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="858.459" dur="3.151">work</text>
  <text start="859.44" dur="4.99">but somebody had called for the</text>
  <text start="861.61" dur="4.74">defibrillator and thank goodness it</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="5.46">worked in the reporter then went to the</text>
  <text start="866.35" dur="6.03">mom and said you&amp;#39;re the one who called</text>
  <text start="869.89" dur="5.61">for this yes yes I was well well how did</text>

  <text start="885.1" dur="5.07">Oprah that&amp;#39;s amazing when one point when</text>
  <text start="888.43" dur="4.38">I did Oprah show was a commercial break</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="5.4">she did the show live she only does used</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="6.6">to do and this was back in 2001 when we</text>
  <text start="895.57" dur="7.379">did the show when she did the show she</text>
  <text start="899.41" dur="5.669">very rarely did a live show and it was</text>
  <text start="902.949" dur="4.411">always a tape show this she did live and</text>
  <text start="905.079" dur="3.421">the reason why she did it live is</text>
  <text start="907.36" dur="3.06">because she wanted to get the</text>
  <text start="908.5" dur="4.23">information out as soon as she could to</text>
  <text start="910.42" dur="4.289">as many people and I&amp;#39;d give her a lot of</text>
  <text start="912.73" dur="3.84">credit for that she takes a lot of flack</text>
  <text start="914.709" dur="3.421">and and she&amp;#39;s changed a lot she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="916.57" dur="3.24">changed a whole lot but she well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="918.13" dur="4.68">why I mentioned when it when we did the</text>
  <text start="919.81" dur="8.13">show yeah I agree with you I I agree</text>
  <text start="922.81" dur="7.62">that that she has changed a lot based on</text>
  <text start="927.94" dur="6.08">the information she presents</text>
  <text start="930.43" dur="8.34">but during one of the commercial breaks</text>
  <text start="934.02" dur="6.16">she looked at me and she said so how</text>
  <text start="938.77" dur="5.75">many people you think are watching us</text>
  <text start="940.18" dur="7.56">right now dr. Dave I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="944.52" dur="9.37">she said about 12 million Wow</text>
  <text start="947.74" dur="9.66">said are you nervous yet and and I said</text>

  <text start="959.86" dur="7.46">we&amp;#39;re having we&amp;#39;re okay but here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="6.8">best part one of those 12 million people</text>
  <text start="967.32" dur="5.26">was their mom in the suburbs of Chicago</text>
  <text start="969.99" dur="4.87">who took that information applied it and</text>
  <text start="972.58" dur="3.06">saved that boy&amp;#39;s life yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="974.86" dur="2.64">incredible</text>
  <text start="975.64" dur="3.78">I mean that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s so important about</text>
  <text start="977.5" dur="4.86">you know what you do with your platform</text>
  <text start="979.42" dur="5.19">right you educate people who empower</text>
  <text start="982.36" dur="6.26">people so they can then utilize that</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="8.91">information to make a difference and and</text>
  <text start="988.62" dur="8.98">that&amp;#39;s where I found that I felt I was</text>
  <text start="993.52" dur="8.85">better served helping folks and getting</text>
  <text start="997.6" dur="6.39">the information out so as I got this</text>
  <text start="1002.37" dur="5.16">prevention information out starting at</text>
  <text start="1003.99" dur="6">88 I got a phone call and it was with at</text>
  <text start="1007.53" dur="6.18">the end of President Reagan&amp;#39;s terminan</text>
  <text start="1009.99" dur="4.98">office and our research had gotten a lot</text>
  <text start="1013.71" dur="3.09">of national media attention and the</text>
  <text start="1014.97" dur="3.51">national media at that point was a bit</text>
  <text start="1016.8" dur="3.69">different than it is drastically</text>
  <text start="1018.48" dur="4.35">different agency than it is now there</text>
  <text start="1020.49" dur="4.65">was some semblance of integrity in the</text>
  <text start="1022.83" dur="4.259">network media back in 88</text>
  <text start="1025.14" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m not saying a hundred percent but but</text>
  <text start="1027.089" dur="5.131">there was much more integrity than there</text>
  <text start="1029.16" dur="4.56">ever is now and we can look at a</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="3.27">specific date that I think things</text>
  <text start="1033.72" dur="3.39">started to change drastically based on</text>
  <text start="1035.49" dur="4.89">my experience dealing with the media</text>
  <text start="1037.11" dur="5.729">before and after that date but but at</text>
  <text start="1040.38" dur="3.87">that point they contacted me and we got</text>
  <text start="1042.839" dur="2.881">a lot of information out through the</text>

  <text start="1631.09" dur="6.84">seen as being disloyal by blowing the</text>

  <text start="1790.039" dur="6.51">one for giving dates however when it</text>
  <text start="1794.779" dur="4.02">came to the declassification issue</text>
  <text start="1796.549" dur="7.291">because the declassification issue was</text>
  <text start="1798.799" dur="8.811">huge I believe the whole if you will the</text>
  <text start="1803.84" dur="6.66">whole ball of yarn starts to unravel</text>
  <text start="1807.61" dur="4.72">with the declassification with the</text>
  <text start="1810.5" dur="3.96">revelations that are there the</text>

  <text start="1922.8" dur="3.84">determine when the declassification</text>
  <text start="1924.03" dur="6.75">occurs try that job and it&amp;#39;s Donald</text>
  <text start="1926.64" dur="4.74">Trump good I always wonder how much does</text>
  <text start="1930.78" dur="3.39">he know</text>
  <text start="1931.38" dur="4.32">does he know like he&amp;#39;s so busy right and</text>
  <text start="1934.17" dur="3.6">sometimes I wonder does he know the</text>
  <text start="1935.7" dur="5.46">intricate details that like you and I</text>
  <text start="1937.77" dur="4.98">spend 24 hours a day working on or is he</text>
  <text start="1941.16" dur="3.18">not aware of some of those things and he</text>
  <text start="1942.75" dur="3.54">needs to know them or you know what I</text>

  <text start="1948.48" dur="4.08">brunt of everything but he does he know</text>
  <text start="1949.98" dur="5.25">the specific details like Felix aiders</text>

  <text start="1964.44" dur="4.32">lot to also do on top of everything else</text>
  <text start="1966.9" dur="4.07">you know what I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1968.76" dur="6.44">reasonable to doubt especially</text>
  <text start="1970.97" dur="7.06">especially when you we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="1975.2" dur="11.31">certain individuals in orange jumpsuits</text>
  <text start="1978.03" dur="8.48">and and and and bracelets on right and I</text>
  <text start="1986.6" dur="6.7">I don&amp;#39;t think I I think one of his</text>
  <text start="1990.84" dur="5.49">advant advantage is he takes it that he</text>
  <text start="1993.3" dur="4.92">really utilizes his people not realizing</text>
  <text start="1996.33" dur="6.06">he really</text>
  <text start="1998.22" dur="5.97">wants to be if you will underestimate me</text>
  <text start="2002.39" dur="3.33">it makes him much more effective just</text>
  <text start="2004.19" dur="4.02">like in the State of the Union address</text>
  <text start="2005.72" dur="6.63">mm-hmm I mean he killed it last night</text>

  <text start="2019.73" dur="6.66">off he was gonna be out of control he</text>
  <text start="2021.23" dur="7.23">was gonna be who and he just the</text>
  <text start="2026.39" dur="4.169">majority of Americans an overwhelming</text>

  <text start="2032.539" dur="4.26">and you know he&amp;#39;s perfect he did a</text>
  <text start="2034.789" dur="5.101">perfect job of playing that any audience</text>
  <text start="2036.799" dur="3.691">exactly the way immediately and this is</text>
  <text start="2039.89" dur="3.75">what he&amp;#39;s doing with the</text>
  <text start="2040.49" dur="5.819">declassification and here is my</text>
  <text start="2043.64" dur="5.82">understanding and this is part this is</text>
  <text start="2046.309" dur="5.491">again from folks that I know that have</text>
  <text start="2049.46" dur="7.949">helped always provided me information</text>
  <text start="2051.8" dur="8.359">that has been accurate that when he</text>
  <text start="2057.409" dur="5.811">pushed for the declassification he felt</text>
  <text start="2060.159" dur="6.52">he had anticipated</text>
  <text start="2063.22" dur="5.79">what and it actually addresses some in</text>
  <text start="2066.679" dur="8.16">the issue you brought about does he know</text>
  <text start="2069.01" dur="8.23">he anticipated a if you will a not just</text>
  <text start="2074.839" dur="5.881">blowback a countermove</text>
  <text start="2077.24" dur="8.58">by the deep state when he Declassified</text>
  <text start="2080.72" dur="7.47">he anticipated that and as he got closer</text>
  <text start="2085.82" dur="4.319">to their time period and then and said</text>
  <text start="2088.19" dur="3.78">okay we wanted to be classify and then</text>
  <text start="2090.139" dur="5.52">session started to slow walk things</text>
  <text start="2091.97" dur="9.57">which is ultimately I believe what led</text>
  <text start="2095.659" dur="8.761">to him being gone as it was being slow</text>
  <text start="2101.54" dur="7.02">walked president Trump realized oh wait</text>
  <text start="2104.42" dur="8.34">a minute wait wait there there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2108.56" dur="9.51">counter move that they have that we</text>
  <text start="2112.76" dur="10.77">haven&amp;#39;t fully blocked Muller and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2118.07" dur="6.81">when he said okay it&amp;#39;s okay for the</text>
  <text start="2123.53" dur="3.69">Department of Justice inspector general</text>
  <text start="2124.88" dur="4.68">Horowitz to be looking over this to see</text>
  <text start="2127.22" dur="4.71">and as I understand it what has been</text>
  <text start="2129.56" dur="8.12">occurring behind the curtain</text>
  <text start="2131.93" dur="9.86">is that politically economically</text>
  <text start="2137.68" dur="9.13">socioeconomically and geopolitically</text>
  <text start="2141.79" dur="13.47">internationally he has been mobilizing</text>
  <text start="2146.81" dur="8.45">his team to block the deep states</text>
  <text start="2156.07" dur="7.33">reaction to when these documents are</text>
  <text start="2161.93" dur="5.85">Declassified because it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="2163.4" dur="7.35">very big and and when the deep state</text>
  <text start="2167.78" dur="6.77">part of this deep state counter our</text>
  <text start="2170.75" dur="9">false flag operations that could well be</text>
  <text start="2174.55" dur="7.03">very potentially very harmful to a</text>
  <text start="2179.75" dur="5.27">tremendous number of people not just</text>
  <text start="2181.58" dur="9.21">Donald Trump not just the Trump family</text>
  <text start="2185.02" dur="9.31">and he did not want to put it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="2190.79" dur="7.29">understanding in harm&amp;#39;s way a tremendous</text>
  <text start="2194.33" dur="7.5">number of people and he didn&amp;#39;t want that</text>
  <text start="2198.08" dur="6.02">exposure to occur which is why he this</text>
  <text start="2201.83" dur="4.98">has been slow walked at this point and</text>
  <text start="2204.1" dur="4.39">we will know the question is well when</text>
  <text start="2206.81" dur="3.78">whenever we get when is this going to</text>
  <text start="2208.49" dur="7.44">happen and the answer I keep getting</text>
  <text start="2210.59" dur="7.74">from my multiple sources is the</text>
  <text start="2215.93" dur="4.16">declassification is going to happen the</text>
  <text start="2218.33" dur="4.5">minute he feel as though a</text>
  <text start="2220.09" dur="7.42">counter-attack by the deep state is</text>
  <text start="2222.83" dur="5.31">completely neutralized that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2227.51" dur="3.48">been told</text>
  <text start="2228.14" dur="5.7">fair enough I mean you know that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2230.99" dur="4.62">removing leverage just by the removing</text>
  <text start="2233.84" dur="3.24">leverage just by these little releases</text>
  <text start="2235.61" dur="4.2">and did you happen to catch that last</text>
  <text start="2237.08" dur="4.26">night one of my friends caught this Jena</text>
  <text start="2239.81" dur="5.67">Haspel was wearing a dress with white</text>
  <text start="2241.34" dur="6.95">hats on it I didn&amp;#39;t see that she was</text>
  <text start="2245.48" dur="4.77">wearing a dress with white bonnets on it</text>
  <text start="2248.29" dur="4.48">like walking hats</text>
  <text start="2250.25" dur="6.09">I did not see well yeah it&amp;#39;s pretty cool</text>
  <text start="2252.77" dur="7.53">I did see I actually is freaking a white</text>
  <text start="2256.34" dur="5.91">you know Pelosi and her see we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="2260.3" dur="4.83">dressed in white which I thought</text>
  <text start="2262.25" dur="3.27">remember a year ago when Melania had a</text>
  <text start="2265.13" dur="2.88">why</text>
  <text start="2265.52" dur="5.31">outfit on it and she was dumb she they</text>
  <text start="2268.01" dur="4.56">were they were demonized for wearing</text>
  <text start="2270.83" dur="3.9">white that this was so politically</text>
  <text start="2272.57" dur="4.05">incorrect and this is sort of now</text>
  <text start="2274.73" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re all wearing white which was</text>
  <text start="2276.62" dur="5.76">actually I think of a bit of a wardrobe</text>
  <text start="2279.83" dur="5.73">malfunction because after what we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="3448.98" dur="5.52">going on with Jeb I know I think Jeb</text>
  <text start="3452.4" dur="6.03">look like he looked like he was gonna</text>
  <text start="3454.5" dur="8.24">vomit and Dovie was acting all kind of</text>
  <text start="3458.43" dur="7.76">fidgety and and what I was told Tracy</text>
  <text start="3462.74" dur="3.45">was that</text>
  <text start="3467.309" dur="9.93">a number of months ago George W Bush</text>
  <text start="3472.549" dur="8.77">came to Tromp and said that he could no</text>
  <text start="3477.239" dur="10.71">longer be a part of what was happening</text>
  <text start="3481.319" dur="9.39">and how it was happening and he wanted</text>
  <text start="3487.949" dur="8.28">to essentially flip on the deep state</text>
  <text start="3490.709" dur="9.74">and provide information and the quid pro</text>
  <text start="3496.229" dur="12.6">quo in that was that the Bush family</text>
  <text start="3500.449" dur="10.27">would be pushed to the side and other</text>
  <text start="3508.829" dur="6.35">high level players would be taken down</text>
  <text start="3510.719" dur="9.87">at least at a minimum first mmm-hmm</text>
  <text start="3515.179" dur="6.88">and that when the bushes or the Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3520.589" dur="3.21">had arranged the bushes to stay at the</text>
  <text start="3522.059" dur="2.88">Blair House across the street from the</text>
  <text start="3523.799" dur="3.87">White House and remember there was this</text>
  <text start="3524.939" dur="4.11">big hoo-ha about George W and Laura</text>
  <text start="3527.669" dur="3.9">coming over to the White House for a</text>
  <text start="3529.049" dur="5.43">special visit I remember that yeah and</text>
  <text start="3531.569" dur="4.2">reportedly that is where W was informed</text>
  <text start="3534.479" dur="3.75">of the sequence of events that would</text>
  <text start="3535.769" dur="6.121">occur at the funeral and what was</text>
  <text start="3538.229" dur="6.54">expected of him and what happened was is</text>
  <text start="3541.89" dur="8.49">that what he was writing is he</text>
  <text start="3544.769" dur="8.361">essentially indicated to Laura that he</text>
  <text start="3550.38" dur="6.179">in fact had flipped that&amp;#39;s when he was</text>
  <text start="3553.13" dur="6.369">supposed to do that now the reason why</text>
  <text start="3556.559" dur="9.54">there is because it was heavily</text>
  <text start="3559.499" dur="9.391">documented with video footage because</text>
  <text start="3566.099" dur="5.64">one of the concerns of people playing</text>
  <text start="3568.89" dur="4.949">against the deep state is that so many</text>
  <text start="3571.739" dur="8.22">people are frustrated because they</text>
  <text start="3573.839" dur="9.74">haven&amp;#39;t seen any visual proof of deep</text>
  <text start="3579.959" dur="8.22">state players being at a minimum off</text>
  <text start="3583.579" dur="6.97">guard or upset yep and the reason why</text>
  <text start="3588.179" dur="6.42">these events happened at the bush</text>
  <text start="3590.549" dur="5.97">funeral was anyone willing to think now</text>
  <text start="3594.599" dur="3.45">wait a minute why is Jeb acting that way</text>
  <text start="3596.519" dur="4.711">wait a minute what it what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="3598.049" dur="5.761">with this what&amp;#39;s going miss do you get</text>
  <text start="3601.23" dur="5.57">to show some indication to some evidence</text>
  <text start="3603.81" dur="5.28">to some people that things were in fact</text>
  <text start="3606.8" dur="4.27">happening I&amp;#39;ve not stopped thinking</text>
  <text start="3609.09" dur="6.06">about it since personally well and and</text>
  <text start="3611.07" dur="7.65">what what bush I understand had written</text>
  <text start="3615.15" dur="5.34">to Laura the insurance policy for the</text>
  <text start="3618.72" dur="4.31">bushes as I understand it has always</text>
  <text start="3620.49" dur="5.82">been pence</text>
  <text start="3623.03" dur="5.68">if you go back to the knot this latest</text>
  <text start="3626.31" dur="7.26">Super Bowl the Super Bowl before George</text>
  <text start="3628.71" dur="6.99">HW Bush was there and after he flipped</text>
  <text start="3633.57" dur="6.36">the coin or whatever he did he went to</text>
  <text start="3635.7" dur="5.54">his box and who was in that box with him</text>
  <text start="3639.93" dur="4.83">but pence</text>
  <text start="3641.24" dur="5.89">well pence was a basically a consolation</text>
  <text start="3644.76" dur="4.11">pick for Trump you know that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3647.13" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s not who we wanted to pick as his</text>
  <text start="3648.87" dur="5.49">vice president I mean we do a campaign</text>
  <text start="3651.03" dur="7.65">well I will tell you something from</text>
  <text start="3654.36" dur="7.08">someone very connected in the Reagan</text>
  <text start="3658.68" dur="4.38">administration George HW Bush was not</text>
  <text start="3661.44" dur="4.56">Ronald Reagan&amp;#39;s pick for a vice</text>
  <text start="3663.06" dur="7.19">president uh-huh he in fact had it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="3666" dur="8.22">understanding had asked someone else and</text>
  <text start="3670.25" dur="6.7">then he had a visit yeah Nana said it</text>
  <text start="3674.22" dur="3.48">was told if you expect to make it to the</text>
  <text start="3676.95" dur="4.02">Election Day</text>
  <text start="3677.7" dur="6.23">let alone become president this other</text>
  <text start="3680.97" dur="7.65">person is not going to be your choice</text>
  <text start="3683.93" dur="7.24">was the how am I gonna ask this question</text>
  <text start="3688.62" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s lots of people speculating out</text>
  <text start="3691.17" dur="3.96">there that George Bush had been senior</text>
  <text start="3693.18" dur="3.54">had been dead dead for some time and</text>
  <text start="3695.13" dur="4.17">that they chose that date because of the</text>
  <text start="3696.72" dur="3.51">hearings and all that those hearings I</text>
  <text start="3699.3" dur="2.4">don&amp;#39;t think would have been so</text>
  <text start="3700.23" dur="3.42">consequential to begin with other than</text>
  <text start="3701.7" dur="5.63">the Clinton whistleblowers but why D is</text>
  <text start="3703.65" dur="7.88">that true do you think that&amp;#39;s true and</text>
  <text start="3707.33" dur="5.79">what that date just seems to be pretty</text>
  <text start="3711.53" dur="4.39">significant</text>
  <text start="3713.12" dur="8.44">you mean the date he died December 5th</text>
  <text start="3715.92" dur="9.36">for the funeral yeah so my sources never</text>
  <text start="3721.56" dur="10.26">confirmed to me that HW had been dead</text>
  <text start="3725.28" dur="9.29">for days or weeks beforehand they did</text>
  <text start="3731.82" dur="2.75">feel as though</text>
  <text start="3734.809" dur="8.61">one of the reasons for that pic of the</text>
  <text start="3738.14" dur="8.49">funeral on December 5th was to put on</text>
  <text start="3743.419" dur="6.06">hold the testimony that was going to</text>
  <text start="3746.63" dur="4.979">occur about the Clinton Foundation and</text>
  <text start="3749.479" dur="6.151">you know about that testimony Tracy and</text>
  <text start="3751.609" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;ve outlined this everybody in it and</text>
  <text start="3755.63" dur="2.699">whenever the him one of the things I</text>
  <text start="3757.069" dur="3.48">learned very early in being in</text>
  <text start="3758.329" dur="4.051">Washington when when folks in Washington</text>
  <text start="3760.549" dur="3.78">are going look at the left hand look at</text>
  <text start="3762.38" dur="3.299">the left hand look at the left hand it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3764.329" dur="2.79">the right hand that&amp;#39;s picking your</text>
  <text start="3765.679" dur="3.54">pocket okay that&amp;#39;s where all the</text>
  <text start="3767.119" dur="5.36">business is being done so when everybody</text>
  <text start="3769.219" dur="6.36">was percent goober goober goober goober</text>
  <text start="3772.479" dur="5.62">what that did is everybody focused on</text>
  <text start="3775.579" dur="4.92">the shiny object of Hoover when in fact</text>
  <text start="3778.099" dur="4.91">the guys delivering the deal were</text>
  <text start="3780.499" dur="4.891">Moynihan and Doyle yep who absolutely</text>
  <text start="3783.009" dur="4.57">annihilated the Clinton Foundation and</text>
  <text start="3785.39" dur="5.039">it took off them so they could walk in</text>
  <text start="3787.579" dur="6.811">so they could physically walk in and do</text>
  <text start="3790.429" dur="7.14">their deal being able to walk out so I</text>
  <text start="3794.39" dur="7.559">do think that why they chose the fifth</text>
  <text start="3797.569" dur="6.51">was to try to postpone that hearing they</text>
  <text start="3801.949" dur="4.951">did postpone until I believe it was the</text>
  <text start="3804.079" dur="6.75">13th I think their goal was trying to</text>
  <text start="3806.9" dur="8.009">push it out even further and hopefully</text>
  <text start="3810.829" dur="5.25">after Congress adjourned that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3814.909" dur="3.57">happen</text>
  <text start="3816.079" dur="4.051">the Trump allies ended up being able to</text>
  <text start="3818.479" dur="5.28">get those guys to get in there and do</text>
  <text start="3820.13" dur="7.679">their deal but it&amp;#39;s my understanding</text>
  <text start="3823.759" dur="9.6">what Laura had shown jabbed why he was</text>
  <text start="3827.809" dur="8.7">about to toss his cookies was that their</text>
  <text start="3833.359" dur="5.49">insurance policy pence could no longer</text>
  <text start="3836.509" dur="6.631">be considered an insurance policy</text>
  <text start="3838.849" dur="8.16">because it was an indication that I</text>
  <text start="3843.14" dur="7.819">would not be surprised if you do not see</text>
  <text start="3847.009" dur="7.65">pence on the 20/20 ticket interesting I</text>
  <text start="3850.959" dur="7.63">know you know I have one more question</text>
  <text start="3854.659" dur="6.42">for you but I would be like there&amp;#39;s tons</text>
  <text start="3858.589" dur="5.22">of indications that as of that two-year</text>
  <text start="3861.079" dur="5.43">mark things just kind of changed for</text>
  <text start="3863.809" dur="4.381">president Trump deals that maybe had</text>
  <text start="3866.509" dur="4.921">been made or things kind of</text>
  <text start="3868.19" dur="5.31">expired certain things like that had</text>
  <text start="3871.43" dur="6.51">changed have you heard anything to that</text>
  <text start="3873.5" dur="7.38">effect what I have heard is from the</text>
  <text start="3877.94" dur="9.24">very beginning and even before he took</text>
  <text start="3880.88" dur="14.459">office he his intelligence network is</text>
  <text start="3887.18" dur="12.96">like no other he has an intelligence</text>
  <text start="3895.339" dur="7.321">gathering system behind him and Patriots</text>
  <text start="3900.14" dur="5.939">within the system that had been</text>
  <text start="3902.66" dur="6.15">providing him information that puts him</text>
  <text start="3906.079" dur="4.471">one two and three steps ahead at a game</text>
  <text start="3908.81" dur="5.34">you know folks make fun of him and say</text>
  <text start="3910.55" dur="6.6">oh yeah for DJ&amp;#39;s five each you know what</text>

  <text start="3976.19" dur="6.87">question that most people would get to</text>
  <text start="3979.359" dur="6.041">three questions down the line the other</text>
  <text start="3983.06" dur="5.88">thing is he said he surrounds himself</text>

  <text start="3996.44" dur="6.07">hear but he needed to know in</text>
  <text start="4000.32" dur="5.43">most people when you do that to them</text>
  <text start="4002.51" dur="6.18">they shut you down or they just shut</text>

  <text start="4019.58" dur="5.43">room that project had advanced we had</text>
  <text start="4023.57" dur="3.24">more advancement in that project and we</text>
  <text start="4025.01" dur="6.18">could have done with pretty much anybody</text>
  <text start="4026.81" dur="8.46">else in six months I bring that story up</text>
  <text start="4031.19" dur="5.82">because that was 30-some years ago his</text>

  <text start="4048.5" dur="7.26">uses that as a means to get ahead of his</text>
  <text start="4052.67" dur="7.47">opponents people need to realize about</text>
  <text start="4055.76" dur="8.52">Trump he loves being the underdog he</text>
  <text start="4060.14" dur="6.93">also loves supporting the underdog he</text>
  <text start="4064.28" dur="12.33">loves being underestimated because it</text>
  <text start="4067.07" dur="12.93">makes his win easier and based on the</text>
  <text start="4076.61" dur="7.56">people I know who have played against</text>

  <text start="4360.07" dur="5.7">down that aisle</text>
  <text start="4361.27" dur="9.24">that&amp;#39;s what 50 or 20 yards mm-hmm 30</text>
  <text start="4365.77" dur="7.82">yards yeah okay so so she doesn&amp;#39;t go for</text>
  <text start="4370.51" dur="8.67">that so no one has confirmed to me</text>
  <text start="4373.59" dur="7.27">no one that she is dead none of my</text>
  <text start="4379.18" dur="6.23">sources have confirmed that to me they</text>
  <text start="4380.86" dur="10.71">have said they believe she is a very ill</text>
  <text start="4385.41" dur="14.68">and that their concern is that she is</text>
  <text start="4391.57" dur="10.41">not capable of hearing and hearing the</text>
  <text start="4400.09" dur="6.02">cases that are being presented</text>
  <text start="4401.98" dur="7.43">Supreme Court of which she reportedly is</text>
  <text start="4406.11" dur="6.43">providing yeah decision it&amp;#39;s not her</text>
  <text start="4409.41" dur="5.62">it&amp;#39;s her clerks it&amp;#39;s pretty crazy</text>
  <text start="4412.54" dur="5.75">yeah it there&amp;#39;s something not right</text>
  <text start="4415.03" dur="5.55">there and and the question is is when</text>
  <text start="4418.29" dur="5.23">you know when when is somebody gonna</text>
  <text start="4420.58" dur="5.04">throw a penalty flag hopefully soon</text>
  <text start="4423.52" dur="3.93">because there&amp;#39;s no way they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="4425.62" dur="6.54">garland the heck out of this there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="4427.45" dur="6.93">way they know no there&amp;#39;s another year no</text>
  <text start="4432.16" dur="4.11">see so that so the question is well what</text>
  <text start="4434.38" dur="4.35">are they what are they waiting on what</text>
  <text start="4436.27" dur="6">are they what did what what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="4438.73" dur="6.11">endgame here for the globalist is you</text>
  <text start="4442.27" dur="4.77">say continue this for another year</text>
  <text start="4444.84" dur="5.47">no I&amp;#39;m that ain&amp;#39;t good that&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="4447.04" dur="5.4">work and I also think that it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="4450.31" dur="5.31">country&amp;#39;s best interest that everyone</text>
  <text start="4452.44" dur="4.86">know I mean I think the the precedent</text>
  <text start="4455.62" dur="3.15">that they bring up is I think it might</text>
  <text start="4457.3" dur="3.09">be Rehnquist where they said well for</text>
  <text start="4458.77" dur="3.99">two months he didn&amp;#39;t hear I mean he</text>
  <text start="4460.39" dur="5.58">wasn&amp;#39;t in the Chamber&amp;#39;s for two months</text>
  <text start="4462.76" dur="6.33">well you know we&amp;#39;re kind of coming up on</text>
  <text start="4465.97" dur="9.57">that two-month mark for her oh yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="4469.09" dur="8.91">right and and where are we so I I do not</text>
  <text start="4475.54" dur="6.03">have confirmation that she has passed I</text>
  <text start="4478" dur="7.2">do have confirmation that she is very</text>
  <text start="4481.57" dur="6.78">ill and according to the folks I spoken</text>
  <text start="4485.2" dur="9.24">with she did the concern is she is not</text>
  <text start="4488.35" dur="9.93">capable of being able to formulate a</text>
  <text start="4494.44" dur="7.86">legal opinion and what&amp;#39;s being presented</text>
  <text start="4498.28" dur="5.73">to the court that&amp;#39;s actually think the</text>
  <text start="4502.3" dur="4.01">Brooke the burden of proof somebody has</text>
  <text start="4504.01" dur="5.94">to breathe the burden of proof is really</text>
  <text start="4506.31" dur="9.64">with in frankly if we had a Supreme</text>
  <text start="4509.95" dur="10.44">Court a a chief just as the Supreme</text>
  <text start="4515.95" dur="6.21">Court that wasn&amp;#39;t a partisan it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="4520.39" dur="3.15">part of the what yeah right who&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="4522.16" dur="4.77">chopped it&amp;#39;s not part of the problem you</text>
  <text start="4523.54" dur="5.46">know it&amp;#39;s really and again let&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="4526.93" dur="3.75">remember it&amp;#39;s Roberts</text>
  <text start="4529" dur="4.65">not only on the Obamacare decision but</text>
  <text start="4530.68" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s Obama if it&amp;#39;s Roberts who appoints</text>
  <text start="4533.65" dur="4.56">these FISA Court judges</text>
  <text start="4535.69" dur="4.59">and and it&amp;#39;s roberts who oversees the</text>
  <text start="4538.21" dur="5.57">face of the court so history you know i</text>
  <text start="4540.28" dur="9.84">mean he has so many issues right now</text>
  <text start="4543.78" dur="7.99">that i think he is really suspect on and</text>
  <text start="4550.12" dur="5.34">i and I really think the integrity of</text>
  <text start="4551.77" dur="6.6">the court is in jeopardy if he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4555.46" dur="5.34">address this Ginsburg issue very soon</text>
