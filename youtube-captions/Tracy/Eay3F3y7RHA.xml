  <text start="502.29" dur="3.66">uncharacteristic for that to happen</text>

  <text start="576.98" dur="4.289">investigate Trump&amp;#39;s ties to Russia or</text>
  <text start="579.589" dur="3.451">maybe he was appointed as a special</text>

  <text start="583.04" dur="3.96">investigating that but during his</text>
  <text start="584.959" dur="5.221">investigation he started to uncover all</text>
  <text start="587" dur="6.569">kinds of crazy stuff that the Democrats</text>
  <text start="590.18" dur="6.36">have done we were investigating Trump</text>

  <text start="936.2" dur="4.44">circle that are let&amp;#39;s finish the</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="4.32">investigation is that how you took it as</text>
  <text start="940.64" dur="5.85">yes sir yes and then you made a comment</text>
  <text start="943.37" dur="5.73">earlier about the Attorney General of</text>
  <text start="946.49" dur="5.67">previous Attorney General asking you</text>
  <text start="949.1" dur="4.65">about the investigation on the Clinton</text>
  <text start="952.16" dur="3.54">emails saying that you&amp;#39;ve been asked not</text>
  <text start="953.75" dur="4.23">to call it an investigation anymore but</text>
  <text start="955.7" dur="3.93">to call it a matter and you had said</text>
  <text start="957.98" dur="4.65">that confused you can you give us</text>
  <text start="959.63" dur="5.55">additional details on that well it</text>
  <text start="962.63" dur="5.28">concerned me because we&amp;#39;re at the point</text>
  <text start="965.18" dur="4.41">where we had refused to confirm the</text>
  <text start="967.91" dur="4.08">existence as we typically do of an</text>
  <text start="969.59" dur="3.75">investigation for months and it was</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="3.96">getting to a place where that looks</text>
  <text start="973.34" dur="5.1">silly because the campaigns were talking</text>
  <text start="975.95" dur="3.24">about interacting with the FBI in the</text>
  <text start="978.44" dur="3.03">course of our work</text>
  <text start="979.19" dur="5.25">the Clinton campaign at the time was</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="5.61">using all kinds of euphemisms security</text>
  <text start="984.44" dur="4.5">review matters things like that for what</text>
  <text start="987.08" dur="3.09">was going on we were getting to a place</text>
  <text start="988.94" dur="2.7">where the attorney Jo and I were both</text>
  <text start="990.17" dur="3.57">gonna have to testify and talk publicly</text>
  <text start="991.64" dur="3.9">about it and I want to know was she</text>
  <text start="993.74" dur="4.44">gonna authorize us to confirm we had an</text>
  <text start="995.54" dur="5.16">investigation and she said yes but don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="998.18" dur="5.67">call it that call it a matter and I said</text>
  <text start="1000.7" dur="6.39">why would I do that and she said just</text>
  <text start="1003.85" dur="4.41">call it a matter and again you look back</text>
  <text start="1007.09" dur="3.15">an EIN site you think should I have</text>
  <text start="1008.26" dur="3.84">resisted harder I just said all right</text>
  <text start="1010.24" dur="4.98">isn&amp;#39;t worth this is an ill worth dying</text>
  <text start="1012.1" dur="4.83">on and so I just said okay the press is</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="3.72">gonna completely ignore it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1016.93" dur="4.38">what happened when I said we have opened</text>
  <text start="1018.94" dur="4.68">a matter they all reported the FBI has</text>
  <text start="1021.31" dur="4.08">an investigation open and so that</text>
  <text start="1023.62" dur="5.01">concerned me because that language</text>
  <text start="1025.39" dur="6.18">tracked the way the campaign was talking</text>
  <text start="1028.63" dur="5.67">about the FBI&amp;#39;s work and that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1031.57" dur="4.38">concerning it gave the impression that</text>
  <text start="1034.3" dur="3.539">the campaign was somehow using the same</text>
  <text start="1035.95" dur="3.75">language the FBI because you were handed</text>
  <text start="1037.839" dur="3.421">the campaign language and totally be</text>
  <text start="1039.7" dur="2.759">able to use the campaign what and I get</text>
  <text start="1041.26" dur="2.52">out of whether it was intentional or not</text>
  <text start="1042.459" dur="2.911">but it gave the impression that the</text>
  <text start="1043.78" dur="3.87">Attorney General was looking to align</text>
  <text start="1045.37" dur="3.9">the way we talked about our work with</text>
  <text start="1047.65" dur="3.66">the way political campaign was</text>
  <text start="1049.27" dur="2.64">describing the same activity which was</text>
  <text start="1051.31" dur="2.28">inaccurate</text>
  <text start="1051.91" dur="4.02">we had a criminal investigation open</text>
  <text start="1053.59" dur="4.68">with as I said before the Federal Bureau</text>
  <text start="1055.93" dur="4.02">of Investigation we had an investigation</text>
  <text start="1058.27" dur="4.77">open at the time and so that gave me a</text>

  <text start="1063.04" dur="5.25">feeling now that&amp;#39;s a big bombshell to</text>

  <text start="1199.75" dur="5.399">there in this revolution of ID</text>
  <text start="1202.21" dur="6.63">does not have to be a violent revolution</text>

  <text start="1213.58" dur="5.25">amount of corruption here it is obvious</text>
  <text start="1216.73" dur="3.84">and it is so easy to get frustrated I</text>
  <text start="1218.83" dur="3.329">was so frustrated after watching that</text>

  <text start="1237.46" dur="5.939">maybe we the American people will</text>
  <text start="1239.769" dur="6.75">finally begin to see justice it can get</text>
  <text start="1243.399" dur="5.37">really frustrating when you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="1246.519" dur="4.53">on this stuff for so long screaming it</text>
  <text start="1248.769" dur="5.49">from the rooftops and you feel like</text>

  <text start="1257.11" dur="6.919">power to do something about it see it as</text>
  <text start="1258.879" dur="7.471">clear as day maybe they do maybe they do</text>
  <text start="1264.029" dur="4.36">have a great day guys share this video</text>

  <text start="1275.71" dur="4.169">too many odd coincidences I&amp;#39;m sure there</text>
  <text start="1278.169" dur="3.061">are more that I even didn&amp;#39;t mention I</text>
  <text start="1279.879" dur="3.24">could think of three or four of them off</text>
  <text start="1281.23" dur="3.36">the top of my head right now but there</text>
  <text start="1283.119" dur="3.93">are reasons why I&amp;#39;ve come to this</text>
  <text start="1284.59" dur="6.99">conclusion they tie in very very very</text>
  <text start="1287.049" dur="7.171">deep very deep this is all one sort of</text>
  <text start="1291.58" dur="4.829">connected narrative and to the question</text>
  <text start="1294.22" dur="2.789">I have not seen it anything at this</text>

  <text start="1306.58" dur="6.209">that&amp;#39;s anywhere near the case I would</text>
  <text start="1308.529" dur="6.421">say the exact opposite however given my</text>
  <text start="1312.789" dur="4.051">research and this is my own opinion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1314.95" dur="4.709">not reflective of anybody else that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1316.84" dur="4.26">been associated with or anyone I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1319.659" dur="5.281">starting to think there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>

  <text start="1328.929" dur="2.401">was killed</text>
  <text start="1329.769" dur="3.03">might might there&amp;#39;s possibly some other</text>
