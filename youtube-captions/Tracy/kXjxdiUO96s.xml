  <text start="100.17" dur="3.839">pants down around their their their</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="4.259">ankles like it didn&amp;#39;t work out the way</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="7.97">they thought it would like there was</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="8.941">something that was covertly thwarted and</text>
  <text start="111.979" dur="5.381">you know I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of radio</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="4.11">interviews and stuff and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="4.59">listening to a lot of different people</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="6.51">and the one thing that I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="4.919">that folks realize is a lot of people</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="4.069">are saying I&amp;#39;m not paying any attention</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="5.851">to this this is just a big distraction</text>
  <text start="129.709" dur="3.681">this is you know it&amp;#39;s not important</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="3.46">this is so</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="6.9">stupid I want everybody to take a second</text>

  <text start="148.6" dur="5.31">time for you to watch this stuff that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="4.83">I think what they&amp;#39;re hoping that people</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="5.19">do I was listening to a show last night</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="4.65">and a lot of the folks were on the show</text>
  <text start="159.1" dur="4.05">and they were talking about how it</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t even make good television it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.15" dur="5">not entertaining you know this is just</text>
  <text start="165.82" dur="4.8">unlike not entertaining</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="5.92">holy-moly are talking about this as if</text>

  <text start="174.07" dur="4.11">impeach the President of the United</text>
  <text start="175.57" dur="5.12">States of America and while we&amp;#39;re used</text>
  <text start="178.18" dur="5.279">to the ridiculous hijinks of the left</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="4.18">this is a serious thing it&amp;#39;s impeachment</text>
  <text start="183.459" dur="3.151">I know it&amp;#39;s not serious because he</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="5.64">didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong I get that I</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="7.11">understand but the the fervor at which</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re pursuing this just makes me step</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="5.64">back and look around and I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="4.38">something else is afoot here</text>

  <text start="351.039" dur="7.951">Sunday to getting back at you about the</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="8.97">Intelligence Committee community to to</text>
  <text start="358.99" dur="6.06">what we&amp;#39;ve seen happen so far to this</text>
  <text start="361.72" dur="6.78">president it has been clear that there</text>
  <text start="365.05" dur="5.52">is an unelected dark power establishment</text>
  <text start="368.5" dur="4.77">that was running the country and still</text>
  <text start="370.57" dur="4.11">is to a large degree that will do</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="7.709">anything and everything that it possibly</text>
  <text start="374.68" dur="8.52">can to stop this progress that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.979" dur="3.601">making and revert us back to where we</text>
  <text start="383.2" dur="2.67">were before we started and one of the</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="3.48">ways that they&amp;#39;re trying to do that is</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="5.25">through this impeachment nonsense and</text>
  <text start="388.06" dur="6.99">sham they are systematically destroying</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="5.91">every norm every precedent every there</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s scorched earth they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re firing a flamethrower and</text>
  <text start="399.01" dur="2.27">they&amp;#39;re not thinking about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="7.07">burning</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="8.88">in the process and another thing is what</text>
  <text start="407.97" dur="4.41">this is doing to the United States of</text>
  <text start="410.16" dur="7.2">America&amp;#39;s ability in the future to deal</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="9.03">with foreign nations it&amp;#39;s damaging so</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="6.12">much and they don&amp;#39;t care and I think the</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="5.52">reason that they don&amp;#39;t care is because</text>
  <text start="423.48" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s all or nothing now and this is it I</text>
  <text start="426.93" dur="4.17">mean they have to they have to get our</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="3.23">president out of office he cannot have a</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="3.87">second term</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="4.18">they have to reestablish their order</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="4.29">they have to reestablish their</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="5.46">stranglehold on things they absolutely</text>
  <text start="439.26" dur="4.83">cannot have the truth of what they did</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="5.72">in 2016 coming out because that will</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="5.94">just completely decimate what happened</text>
  <text start="447.62" dur="4.72">or that will completely decimate even</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="5.13">further you know what&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="4.62">the past couple years and there needs to</text>
  <text start="455.16" dur="3.09">be accountability and we have a few</text>
  <text start="456.96" dur="3.39">people that are going to bring it and I</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="3.6">think that we have to think about this</text>
  <text start="460.35" dur="5.16">in a different way to like there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="461.85" dur="6.03">more good guys than we get to see out in</text>
  <text start="465.51" dur="4.98">public doing things behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="6.39">right I mean the government is is not</text>
  <text start="470.49" dur="5.19">all bad people I wanted to just play</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="4.41">something for you really quickly that</text>
  <text start="475.68" dur="5.1">really struck me this morning means this</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="6.54">is a waste of time I think the Democrats</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="6.27">know that look you have Democrats on the</text>
  <text start="485.22" dur="4.5">House Intelligence Committee which is</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="4.76">now the house impeachment committee that</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="5.85">already voted to impeach the president</text>
  <text start="491.81" dur="7.75">they&amp;#39;ve made up their mind and this is</text>
  <text start="495.57" dur="6.36">dead on arrival without fairly looking</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="4.05">at the most important witnesses they</text>
  <text start="501.93" dur="3.239">don&amp;#39;t want the whistleblower to come in</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="4.619">because it has now been discovered the</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="5.271">Chairman shifts office coordinated for</text>

  <text start="545.72" dur="5.91">something new now many of us assume that</text>
  <text start="548.96" dur="5.7">that might be the case but they</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="6.12">literally planted this guy whoever their</text>
  <text start="554.66" dur="4.83">leaker to him was either wasn&amp;#39;t able to</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="6.54">fix that transcript the way they needed</text>

  <text start="569.81" dur="6.33">think people really are getting how</text>
  <text start="571.76" dur="6.99">important that is fairly looking at the</text>
