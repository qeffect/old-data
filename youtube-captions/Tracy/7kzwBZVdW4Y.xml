  <text start="13.2" dur="8.94">I&amp;#39;m gonna do a report today to try to</text>
  <text start="17.539" dur="7.631">help understand what could possibly be</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="5.309">going on with Nunez</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="4.98">this agent that stepped down in August</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="6.27">why it could be happening right now of</text>
  <text start="30.15" dur="6.24">all times and I&amp;#39;m not a hundred and ten</text>
  <text start="33.719" dur="5.311">percent sold on my theory but I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="3.57">confident some speculation in here but</text>
  <text start="39.03" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;m going to show you why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="4.29">speculating the way I am and just bear</text>
  <text start="42.66" dur="3.629">with me I&amp;#39;m gonna get through this as</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="4.77">fast as I can and as to the point as I</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="5.221">can but we need to get some history to</text>
  <text start="49.02" dur="4.41">understand what&amp;#39;s going on so I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="5.819">my little thing here so basically what</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="5.37">happened is stroszek who I looked up how</text>
  <text start="57.329" dur="3.901">to pronounce his name for those of you</text>
  <text start="58.8" dur="4.89">who have helped me with pronunciations</text>
  <text start="61.23" dur="4.05">in the past but I I couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="4.26">anything solid so stroszek is the</text>
  <text start="65.28" dur="5.61">closest I could find so stroszek was an</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="4.41">FBI agent who was appointed to very high</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="4.68">up on the Hillary Clinton email</text>

  <text start="78.439" dur="6.22">demoted to the human resources</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="4.89">department back in July took them off</text>

  <text start="131.91" dur="3.73">resources division</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s unclear why he stepped aside or if</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="3.72">he did so voluntarily so we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="137.83" dur="2.16">really any information at this point</text>

  <text start="156.03" dur="5.98">investigation or the operation center</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="4.23">but why he would be moved to HR is just</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="3.21">bizarre</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="4.45">rangamma did not want to speculate on</text>
  <text start="165.22" dur="4.17">what may have happened but said there</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="3.93">were many factors ranging from small</text>
  <text start="169.39" dur="3.69">administrative violations to more</text>
