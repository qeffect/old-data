  <text start="3.48" dur="3.299">I&amp;#39;m just letting everyone know I wanted</text>
  <text start="5.279" dur="8.311">to jump on and do a quick livestream for</text>
  <text start="6.779" dur="8.461">you guys and explain what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="13.59" dur="3.81">with McKay because I&amp;#39;m seeing a whole</text>
  <text start="15.24" dur="3.27">bunch of different folks that um are a</text>
  <text start="17.4" dur="3.33">little bit confused about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="18.51" dur="3.9">happening here and what the deal is so I</text>
  <text start="20.73" dur="3.9">figured I&amp;#39;d jump on for a very quick</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="4.949">stream and explain it to you guys and</text>
  <text start="24.63" dur="4.53">also um I&amp;#39;m expecting a very important</text>
  <text start="27.359" dur="3.451">phone call and there is a good chance</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="4.98">because I started the stream there will</text>
  <text start="30.81" dur="5.19">be that phone call so if that happens</text>
  <text start="34.14" dur="4.739">I&amp;#39;m gonna mute my microphone for a good</text>
  <text start="36" dur="7.5">minute and I&amp;#39;ll be done okay</text>
  <text start="38.879" dur="7.831">so here&amp;#39;s the deal Andrew McCabe has</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="4.559">been a fixture for me for over for a</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="2.79">very long time and I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of</text>
  <text start="48.059" dur="2.791">work into Andrew McCabe and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="49.5" dur="3.899">what he&amp;#39;s done and what the deal is with</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="4.2">him and I&amp;#39;ve always said from the very</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="3.121">beginning that he would be the first one</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="3.54">to take a fall he would be the first one</text>
  <text start="56.52" dur="3.929">to be indicted often too a lot of people</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="3.989">not believing me go rightfully so</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="3.99">because we you know we don&amp;#39;t expect to</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="6.181">see people don&amp;#39;t expect to see justice</text>
  <text start="64.439" dur="6.031">and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re frustrated but we</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="3.719">got word there was a grand jury and</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="5.07">panelled in his case which I&amp;#39;ll get into</text>
  <text start="72.479" dur="5.851">in a second over a year ago we got word</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="4.98">a couple weeks ago that his attorneys</text>
  <text start="78.33" dur="5.25">were talking to the US attorney trying</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="8.79">to bargain with them to not indict</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="7.77">Andrew McCabe on these charges of lying</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.379">to a lack of candor basically lying to</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="4.74">investigators and I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="93.689" dur="4.801">explain what this is all about and this</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="4.56">is not net it&amp;#39;s not directly related to</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="4.769">Spygate or even the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="5.28">investigation while the Inspector</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="4.801">General was investigating the Clinton</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="5.07">email investigation he came across the</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="5.04">text messages between McCabe and struck</text>
  <text start="111" dur="3.869">and page etc so on and so forth at the</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="3.75">same time as that was happening the</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="4.29">internal Inspection Division at the FBI</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="6">was doing an investigation internally</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="5.431">into leaking into leaking so they were</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="3.51">looking into all these leaks in one of</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="4.38">the leaks they were looking into was a</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="4.83">leak that went out to Barrett from the</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="4.59">Wall Street Journal where he was writing</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="5.97">Devin Barrett was writing a story of</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="5.85">about how Andrew McCabe was tanking the</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="5.82">Clinton Foundation investigation that</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="5.73">was ongoing inside of the FBI because of</text>
  <text start="142.98" dur="3.99">his close proximity to Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="4.08">etc something to that effect don&amp;#39;t quote</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="3.66">me exactly but it was basically Barrett</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="3.269">was gonna write a story about how the</text>
  <text start="150.63" dur="3.48">investigation was being politicized and</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="4.351">McCabe was a key component of that</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="5.129">McCabe got wind of it and he decided he</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="5.16">was going to leak to the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="6">Journal the contents of a conversation</text>
  <text start="162" dur="6.48">that he had with the PA d AG above him</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="4.921">where he claims that person yelled and</text>
  <text start="168.48" dur="4.44">screamed at him to take it easy on the</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="5.07">investigation to not do it and McCabe in</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="5.069">return said what are you trying to do</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="5.28">tell me to stop investigating this for</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="5.461">political reasons so what he did McCabe</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="5.339">was tell Lisa page that she could speak</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="9.84">to the Wall Street Journal and tell him</text>
  <text start="185.849" dur="9.45">that story then when the I NSD began</text>
  <text start="193.29" dur="3.66">investigating this McCabe denied it</text>
  <text start="195.299" dur="3.151">denied it denied it tonight it said it</text>
  <text start="196.95" dur="4.319">wasn&amp;#39;t him said it wasn&amp;#39;t him said he</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="6">didn&amp;#39;t know who it was and when the I</text>
  <text start="201.269" dur="5.28">NSD realized that it was McCabe they</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="4.11">passed the investigation along to the</text>
  <text start="206.549" dur="3.931">Office of Inspector General because they</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="4.14">could no longer investigate their</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="3.839">superior in other words it was a</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="3.42">conflict of interest for the imsd to</text>
  <text start="214.319" dur="4.281">continue the investigation into someone</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="5.179">above them they were absolutely</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="7.979">frustrated that they had wasted time and</text>
  <text start="221.299" dur="8.891">resources on this and which one is it</text>
  <text start="226.579" dur="5.53">time and resources on this and it was</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="3.54">literally somebody that was lying to</text>
  <text start="232.109" dur="3.301">them the entire time saying that it</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="3.96">wasn&amp;#39;t them who did this it was someone</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="4.829">else the IG finds the Lisa page struck</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="4.74">text messages starts asking McCabe about</text>
  <text start="240.239" dur="4.62">them McCabe is denying everything until</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="5.429">Lisa page comes forward and says it was</text>
  <text start="244.859" dur="5.13">McCabe that told me to do this and then</text>
  <text start="247.859" dur="4.621">pay it&amp;#39;s basically page this is a very</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="5.28">broad summary it&amp;#39;s basically page pitted</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="6.72">against McCabe McCabe realizes he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="6.571">for McCabe takes finally after four</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="7.709">interviews under oath some of which were</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="5.66">recorded when he&amp;#39;s lying he finally says</text>
  <text start="266.909" dur="3.411">all</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="5.13">it was me yeah it was me I did it when</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="4.5">he balls-to-the-wall excuse me</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="5.13">no chance that he could possibly get out</text>
  <text start="274.82" dur="5.1">of it anymore completely screwed</text>
  <text start="277.76" dur="4.41">who else was pitted against McCabe in</text>
  <text start="279.92" dur="4.2">this james comey because McCabe said he</text>
  <text start="282.17" dur="4.53">told Col me that he was gonna do it</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="4.71">Comey acted like it was fine Comey says</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="4.22">no way I would never have done that</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="4.32">because it would have acknowledged and</text>
  <text start="290.92" dur="3.64">confirmed that there was an</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="3.48">investigation into the Clinton</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="6.359">Foundation and and we never do things</text>
  <text start="296.63" dur="6.24">like that big big long thing basically</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="5.011">the entire time that McCabe is doing</text>
  <text start="302.87" dur="7.56">this he&amp;#39;s also attempting to pin this</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="6.42">leak on the New York field office of the</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="4.65">FBI and this is something that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="312.35" dur="4.2">talked about at nauseam now this report</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="4.5">about this leak to the Wall Street</text>

  <text start="328.34" dur="4.59">is going on with Andrew McCabe what the</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="4.02">charges that he&amp;#39;s facing are you know</text>
  <text start="332.93" dur="3.42">what the thoughts are about when those</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="3.81">charges will come down what the details</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="3.66">are about what&amp;#39;s going on right now and</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="3.18">all the news articles that are flooding</text>
  <text start="340.01" dur="3.63">and just trying to get people on the</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="4.83">same page because a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.64" dur="4.86">understand it so the the OIG does the</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="4.32">report about Andrew McCabe he</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="4.95">subsequently fired the day before he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="5.19">supposed to receive his pension they</text>
  <text start="353.45" dur="5.07">refer Andrew McCabe for criminal</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="5.22">prosecution because he blatantly lied to</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="5.28">investigators under oath several times</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="5.49">while he was at the FBI also while</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="6.77">trying to pin his own misdeeds on his</text>
  <text start="366.62" dur="7.26">his agents and it&amp;#39;s just disgusting so a</text>
  <text start="370.57" dur="6.67">year ago a year and a half ago now</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="5.16">Horowitz recommends this and we have not</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="3.51">heard very much other than to know that</text>
  <text start="379.04" dur="4.11">there was a grand jury in panelled that</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="3.9">things were moving and there have been</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="3.18">naysayers along the way saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="3.39">never gonna happen on both sides there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="3.81">no way this grand jury&amp;#39;s expired now</text>
  <text start="388.04" dur="4.08">nobody&amp;#39;s looking at this and then a</text>
  <text start="390.14" dur="4.32">couple of like a week or two ago we got</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="4.799">a few stories that McCabe&amp;#39;s attorneys</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="4.829">were kind of doing like a Hail Mary with</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="4.021">the US attorney trying to get them not</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="3.451">to press charges on Andrew</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="3.57">McCabe and doing they&amp;#39;re sort of like</text>
  <text start="402.74" dur="4.05">negotiation like please don&amp;#39;t press</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="4.2">charges blah blah blah well today we</text>
  <text start="406.79" dur="4.5">have Sarah Carter reporting with several</text>
  <text start="408.71" dur="4.14">others US attorney recommends moving</text>
  <text start="411.29" dur="3.93">forward with charges against Andrew</text>
  <text start="412.85" dur="5.31">McCabe which is is misleading in my</text>
  <text start="415.22" dur="5.28">opinion because the US attorney is the</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="4.44">one unless these charges are coming</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="5.64">directly from William Barr at the DOJ</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="5.22">the US attorney is the one working the</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="3.45">case who gets the indictment whose name</text>
  <text start="427.82" dur="4.2">is on the indictment etc so on and so</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="4.35">forth like imagine if every US attorney</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="4.83">had to get the approval of the the</text>
  <text start="433.94" dur="4.08">Attorney General to press charges I</text>
  <text start="436.85" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s how it works</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="4.47">maybe I&amp;#39;m mistaken but I really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="439.76" dur="5.64">think so so now we know that basic that</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="7.83">the DOJ or the US attorney Jesse Lew I</text>
  <text start="445.4" dur="6.27">believe it is in DC or Virginia I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="3.3">sure which district Issa I think there</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="5.58">in Virginia with him I&amp;#39;m pretty sure has</text>
  <text start="453.62" dur="5.67">decided that sorry not sorry guys your</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="4.26">pleas for help are not null and void</text>
  <text start="459.29" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re gonna move forward and indict</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="5.34">Andrew McCabe on this I think that that</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="4.11">is wonderful because it is a huge crime</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="3.51">that he committed as a matter of fact</text>
  <text start="468.41" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s a felony and they have him on tape</text>
  <text start="470.36" dur="5.49">I mean you can&amp;#39;t get more solid than</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="5.84">this nonsense you can&amp;#39;t and it&amp;#39;s a crime</text>
  <text start="475.85" dur="5.91">for comparison General Michael Flynn</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="5.65">didn&amp;#39;t know he was being questioned for</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="4.86">some sort of an investigation and didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="4.47">didn&amp;#39;t put get put under oath and was</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="5.07">completely lied to and didn&amp;#39;t even lie</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="6.99">and is in the position that he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="491.69" dur="6.21">right now so just to spell it out again</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="4.02">the charges that are being talked about</text>
  <text start="497.9" dur="4.74">today in regards to Andrew McCabe have</text>
  <text start="499.88" dur="4.47">to do with his lying to the Office of</text>
  <text start="502.64" dur="4.08">Inspector General while they were</text>
  <text start="504.35" dur="5.43">investigating him for leaking to the</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="5.55">Wall Street Journal via Lisa page</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="4.559">Lisa page told the truth Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="512.27" dur="3.93">did not as a matter of fact he</text>
  <text start="514.339" dur="4.651">completely denied it to the point where</text>
  <text start="516.2" dur="5.04">he lied to his own people about it and</text>
  <text start="518.99" dur="5.22">then tried to pin the crime on someone</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="5.43">else so just just to get that out of the</text>
  <text start="524.21" dur="4.95">way he was on tape lying to the</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="4.8">inspector general while under oath again</text>
  <text start="529.16" dur="4.32">he was on tape lying to the inspector</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="2.79">general while under oath can you guys</text>
  <text start="533.48" dur="2.52">understand</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="4.59">why this is a very strong case you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="536" dur="4.74">got a man who&amp;#39;s using his own words when</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="2.31">you&amp;#39;ve got documents etc so on and so</text>
  <text start="540.74" dur="2.91">forth</text>

  <text start="549.59" dur="5.01">the Clinton Foundation investigation</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="5.97">this is simply charging him for lying to</text>

  <text start="557.21" dur="3.72">questioned in relation to the leaks that</text>

  <text start="707.88" dur="4.38">talking about Devlin Barrett we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="711.06" dur="2.82">go over this real quick the IG report</text>
  <text start="712.26" dur="3.51">faulted McCabe for leaking information</text>
  <text start="713.88" dur="4.98">to then Wall Street Journal reporter</text>

  <text start="718.86" dur="4.8">internal feud over Hillary Clinton probe</text>
  <text start="720.72" dur="4.74">the story written just days before the</text>

  <text start="725.46" dur="8.01">announcing the reopening of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="727.05" dur="6.78">investigation no no that&amp;#39;s wrong there</text>
  <text start="733.47" dur="1.98">it is</text>
  <text start="733.83" dur="3.09">the journals account of the call said</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="3.48">the senior Justice Department official</text>
  <text start="736.92" dur="3.66">expressed his pleasure to McCabe that</text>
  <text start="738.93" dur="3.51">FBI agents were still looking into the</text>
  <text start="740.58" dur="3.6">Clinton Foundation and that Makeba</text>
  <text start="742.44" dur="4.14">defended the agents authority to pursue</text>
  <text start="744.18" dur="4.68">the issue the leak confirmed the</text>
  <text start="746.58" dur="4.26">existence of the probe the report said</text>
  <text start="748.86" dur="4.05">which Comey had up to that point refused</text>
  <text start="750.84" dur="3.84">to do the report said McCabe lacked</text>
  <text start="752.91" dur="3.15">candor in a conversation would call me</text>
  <text start="754.68" dur="2.58">when he said he had not authorized the</text>
  <text start="756.06" dur="4.14">disclosure and didn&amp;#39;t know who had done</text>
  <text start="757.26" dur="4.8">so and also found he lack candor when</text>
  <text start="760.2" dur="4.68">questioned by FBI agents on multiple</text>
  <text start="762.06" dur="4.26">occasions since that conversation of</text>
  <text start="764.88" dur="3.93">course he denies the entire thing</text>
  <text start="766.32" dur="3.74">started a civil suit against the Justice</text>
  <text start="768.81" dur="3.48">Department for wrongful termination</text>
  <text start="770.06" dur="3.85">arguing it was part of Trump&amp;#39;s plan to</text>
  <text start="772.29" dur="9.63">rid the Bureau of leaders he perceived a</text>
  <text start="773.91" dur="11.45">disloyal and that&amp;#39;s that so again if you</text>
  <text start="781.92" dur="8.7">guys want to you should read this report</text>
  <text start="785.36" dur="8.23">because it is 40 pages long and it is</text>
  <text start="790.62" dur="7.2">worth the read it really is it&amp;#39;s 40</text>
  <text start="793.59" dur="8.54">pages long read it digest it understand</text>
  <text start="797.82" dur="4.31">it it is necessary and important</text>
  <text start="802.79" dur="3.88">that&amp;#39;s it Andrew McCabe in my opinion</text>
  <text start="805.53" dur="2.49">and I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a long</text>
  <text start="806.67" dur="2.97">time but it really looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.02" dur="3.87">definitely going to happen we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="809.64" dur="5.19">indicted for lack of candor which</text>
  <text start="811.89" dur="4.74">actually ends up being a felony so one</text>
  <text start="814.83" dur="4.29">last thing I want to address before I go</text>
  <text start="816.63" dur="5.04">this it would be a great day in this</text>
  <text start="819.12" dur="9.05">country if finally someone was held</text>
  <text start="821.67" dur="8.88">accountable for something that they did</text>
  <text start="828.17" dur="5.95">no I don&amp;#39;t think that it&amp;#39;s a misdemeanor</text>
  <text start="830.55" dur="12.48">hold on hold on a second let me just</text>
  <text start="834.12" dur="12.51">triple check this he didn&amp;#39;t say what he</text>
  <text start="843.03" dur="24.17">recommends in here lacking candor under</text>
  <text start="846.63" dur="20.57">oath let&amp;#39;s say it is</text>
  <text start="874.089" dur="11.531">I gotta look into it I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ve researched</text>
  <text start="883.939" dur="5.791">it before and I&amp;#39;m nearly certain it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="885.62" dur="6.36">felony so I&amp;#39;ll look at it I&amp;#39;ll look into</text>
  <text start="889.73" dur="3.719">it um it&amp;#39;s just I don&amp;#39;t want to make you</text>
  <text start="891.98" dur="2.909">guys sit here while I well I look into</text>
  <text start="893.449" dur="2.82">this research it because we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="894.889" dur="2.55">charges now so I don&amp;#39;t know what their</text>
  <text start="896.269" dur="3.81">specific what statute they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="897.439" dur="4.14">specifically use to indict him so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="900.079" dur="3.331">not sure we don&amp;#39;t have that stuff public</text>
  <text start="901.579" dur="3.481">but I do want to say this some I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="903.41" dur="3.869">a couple people on different threads and</text>
  <text start="905.06" dur="5.879">one of my own saying like oh this is a</text>
  <text start="907.279" dur="5.49">big ruse when they arrest him it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="910.939" dur="3.45">gonna be so that they make it look like</text>
  <text start="912.769" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re doing something and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="914.389" dur="7.5">gonna tank the case and he&amp;#39;s gonna walk</text>
  <text start="916.129" dur="10.71">and I just want to say I just want to</text>
  <text start="921.889" dur="8.43">say we can&amp;#39;t continue like that in my</text>
  <text start="926.839" dur="5.94">opinion I I mean if if a former director</text>
  <text start="930.319" dur="5.52">and deputy director of the FBI is</text>
  <text start="932.779" dur="5.49">arrested and indicted for what I believe</text>
  <text start="935.839" dur="6.841">at this point in time is a felony for</text>
  <text start="938.269" dur="6.57">lying to investigators then it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="942.68" dur="4.079">thing which means justice is being done</text>
  <text start="944.839" dur="3.87">you can&amp;#39;t just automatically assume that</text>
  <text start="946.759" dur="4.711">everything is just to get away there is</text>
  <text start="948.709" dur="6.031">no it just it&amp;#39;s silly I want to I</text>
  <text start="951.47" dur="4.77">understand skepticism and I understand</text>
  <text start="954.74" dur="3.36">people being frustrated with the length</text>
  <text start="956.24" dur="4.529">of time this is taken and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="958.1" dur="6.15">understand that I understand that people</text>
  <text start="960.769" dur="5.55">are just they don&amp;#39;t trust the government</text>
  <text start="964.25" dur="3.86">I don&amp;#39;t either I mean I get it I get all</text>
  <text start="966.319" dur="4.411">that but if somebody gets arrested and</text>
  <text start="968.11" dur="4.36">we got to read an indictment and we get</text>
  <text start="970.73" dur="6.12">to see if he please and all of that</text>
  <text start="972.47" dur="5.58">stuff that&amp;#39;s that you I mean you just</text>
  <text start="976.85" dur="3.299">kind of have to take it at face value</text>
  <text start="978.05" dur="4.829">they&amp;#39;re arresting a former FBI director</text>
  <text start="980.149" dur="4.5">that doesn&amp;#39;t happen every day and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="982.879" dur="5.041">sure it&amp;#39;s just a foreshadowing of what&amp;#39;s</text>
