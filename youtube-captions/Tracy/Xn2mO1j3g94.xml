  <text start="0.589" dur="8.8">hey there so it is Friday June 14 2019</text>
  <text start="5.04" dur="9.78">at 4:11 p.m. Eastern Time and I started</text>
  <text start="9.389" dur="10.291">to do research into Kellyanne Conway&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.82" dur="6.539">Hatch Act violations and quotes and I</text>
  <text start="19.68" dur="4.259">wanted to kind of take a look at the</text>
  <text start="21.359" dur="6.961">Office of Special Counsel how many</text>
  <text start="23.939" dur="6.51">complaints they lodged in 2015 14 13 etc</text>
  <text start="28.32" dur="4.53">I wanted to look at how many Hatch Act</text>
  <text start="30.449" dur="4.95">violations they&amp;#39;ve ever done I just</text>
  <text start="32.85" dur="5.01">wanted to get an idea because the report</text>
  <text start="35.399" dur="5.25">was written in such a partisan manner it</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="5.25">was just it was it just was gross and</text>
  <text start="40.649" dur="6.871">you know while some of the things that</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="7.07">she said could be taken as violations of</text>
  <text start="47.52" dur="6.99">the Hatch Act it was clearly a partisan</text>
  <text start="50.18" dur="7.09">exercise and it wasn&amp;#39;t fair and the</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="3.75">White House report written on it made</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="5.309">perfect sense</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="6.21">um but while I was doing that and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="7.591">still planning on doing it</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="8.28">I some other things and here is a</text>
  <text start="70.17" dur="5.339">basically here&amp;#39;s a public files chart</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="4.5">from 2013 I just wanted to look back</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="3.091">through the prior administration and see</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="3.119">how many reports were filed</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="5.61">now the Office of Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="5.61">doesn&amp;#39;t just do Hatch Act violations</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="4.409">they do whistleblower complaints and</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="4.411">things of that nature as well so these</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="4.471">are all the reports that they put out</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="6.57">over the course of 2013 and I noticed</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="12.059">there were several handful about the DOJ</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="11.31">and the FBI and I found one here it was</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="5.01">this gentleman named Scott McDonald he</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="6.209">was a CPA who was hired to come into the</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="6.32">FBI and do basically audits to audit</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="4.411">their electronic records their</text>
  <text start="116.479" dur="4.661">electronic surveillance their</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="7.259">record-keeping capabilities how they</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="9.989">were managing things and he what he</text>
  <text start="126.149" dur="7.621">found was horrific malfeasance</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="6.501">that was not only designed</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="6.84">- basically skirt the foyer requirements</text>
  <text start="137.63" dur="7.39">for Responsive records in terms of</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="9.18">emails and in terms of you know other</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="8.34">other electronic communications etc he</text>
  <text start="149.79" dur="8.37">found that in addition to all of that</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="8.13">stuff the database that maintained FISA</text>
  <text start="158.16" dur="12.51">and title 3 search warrants electronic</text>
  <text start="161.49" dur="13.41">warrants was grossly corrupt and</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="6.66">mismanaged and in doing that it causes a</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.98">search like when you go to present a</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="7.2">warrant you&amp;#39;re supposed to be able to</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="6.57">say you know this person so-and-so was</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="3.75">the subject of a warrant in the past</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="4.2">this person is a search you know was</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="6.27">never a subject of a warrant and the way</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="6.42">the records queries were set up any any</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="4.44">search or incorrect search wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="3.96">pulled the right information every time</text>
  <text start="198.99" dur="3.78">and the way it was catalogs even though</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="5.1">there was an upgrade of this database</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="6.09">done in 2012 the old data that was</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="3.96">corrupted in the search the database</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="3.36">structure that was in there and</text>
  <text start="210.09" dur="3.81">corrupted was brought over and so Scott</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="5.1">McDonald starts to raise questions about</text>
  <text start="213.9" dur="5.7">the validity and the sanctity of all of</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="4.26">the warrant requests the FBI had asked</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="6">for in the past goodness knows how many</text>
  <text start="221.58" dur="7.29">years he attempted to address these</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="6.72">findings inside of the FBI Oh in</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="5.1">addition to that he also found he I went</text>
  <text start="232.32" dur="4.86">on such a rabbit hole today he also</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="6.75">found that the microfiche evidence</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="5.97">wasn&amp;#39;t stored properly in in rooms that</text>
  <text start="240.72" dur="4.05">they didn&amp;#39;t catalog evidence properly at</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="3.57">all that they bulked it up into one</text>
  <text start="244.77" dur="8.33">container and cataloged it as an</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="8.82">evidence a bulk evidence box so to speak</text>
  <text start="253.1" dur="4.03">so rather than cataloguing each piece of</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="3.6">evidence in a case they put it all in</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="4.169">the box and said this is evidence box</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="4.41">one that&amp;#39;s not how it&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="4.011">done queried evidence isn&amp;#39;t found that</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="3.86">way</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="5.28">recordkeeping isn&amp;#39;t done correctly and</text>
  <text start="267.41" dur="5.46">more importantly in some cases all of</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="5.16">this stuff that they&amp;#39;re doing isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.31">subject to FOIA because they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="6.41">things there&amp;#39;s no proper attention</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="6.81">policies on email just the whole entire</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="4.93">watchdog aspect the ex the FBI is</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="4.53">supposed to have in terms of Records in</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="5.16">terms of yellowbook criteria and things</text>
  <text start="289.52" dur="6.6">like that they were completely out of</text>
  <text start="292.25" dur="6.84">compliance with and we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="5.28">through some of that today he Scott</text>
  <text start="299.09" dur="5.82">McDonald brings this stuff forward to</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="6.78">his supervisor to begin to implement fix</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="6.12">and his supervisor says no no no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.18" dur="6">gonna remove all this stuff and carry on</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="5.88">and he said no I&amp;#39;m not removing it they</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="4.41">also asked him if they could they asked</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="6.48">him first questions in advance when he</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="6.78">was performing his audits and he said</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="5.45">I&amp;#39;ll give you my questions but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="6.48">outside of policy to do that because</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="4.69">then the people in the main office can</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="3.21">just remove the questions that make them</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="3.93">feel uncomfortable and I can&amp;#39;t perform</text>
  <text start="335.06" dur="7.62">my audit correctly sure enough that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="7.83">exactly what they did he was fired they</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="6.36">made up a whole bunch of excuses and and</text>
  <text start="345.29" dur="5.49">fake stories about why he was let go he</text>

  <text start="531.3" dur="4.62">of issues identified while performing</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="5.28">the redesigned compliance audits and his</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="4.98">a desire to address the problems that he</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="5.1">found Glenn Murphy who was his</text>
  <text start="540.9" dur="4.14">supervisor had a suspicion that he was a</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="3.48">whistleblower and attacked him because</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="3.9">of it and you know what&amp;#39;s really funny</text>
  <text start="546.78" dur="3.48">is that the office of legal counsel I</text>
  <text start="548.94" dur="3.3">mean the office of special counsel is</text>
  <text start="550.26" dur="4.38">designed to protect whistleblowers and</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="4.83">here they have the FBI during an</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="7.31">investigation into itself on these</text>
  <text start="557.07" dur="4.88">charges and firing a whistleblower</text>
  <text start="563.45" dur="4.3">the FBI violated civil rights of</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="3.09">suspects and failed to safeguard</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="3.11">electronic surveillance evidence and</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.74">other records of the FBI</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="5.83">the DOJ did not do an investigation as</text>
  <text start="574.05" dur="4.74">directed by the OSC instead they turned</text>
  <text start="576.69" dur="4.2">the investigation over to the people who</text>
  <text start="578.79" dur="4.35">violated the law namely management</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="4.89">within the FBI this is a clear violation</text>
  <text start="583.14" dur="4.68">of independent review and a conflict of</text>
  <text start="585.78" dur="4.08">interest it was conducted by two</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="3.81">inspectors in the FBI Inspection</text>
  <text start="589.86" dur="3.63">Division it has been reported in the</text>
  <text start="591.63" dur="3.27">media that a special agent with the same</text>
  <text start="593.49" dur="3.45">name as one of the inspectors was</text>
  <text start="594.9" dur="4.89">previously dismissed for lack of candor</text>
  <text start="596.94" dur="4.71">and then reinstated but did admit that</text>
  <text start="599.79" dur="2.87">he used government property for personal</text>
  <text start="601.65" dur="3.33">use</text>
  <text start="602.66" dur="3.43">he knew this before he interviewed with</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="2.43">him McDonald did and made him</text>
  <text start="606.09" dur="2.73">uncomfortable that he&amp;#39;s sitting here in</text>
  <text start="607.41" dur="5.12">front of somebody who was fired for lack</text>
  <text start="608.82" dur="3.71">of candor and then brought back on board</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="4.48">as a test of the thoroughness of the</text>
  <text start="616.5" dur="4.62">investigation I didn&amp;#39;t mention to the</text>
  <text start="618.45" dur="4.35">inspectors that I identified lost</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="3.75">electronic surveillance evidence when I</text>
  <text start="622.8" dur="4.35">performed an inventory of the evidence</text>
  <text start="624.87" dur="3.75">room during the inventory there were two</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="3.57">pieces of evidence that were missing</text>
  <text start="628.62" dur="3.99">they were signed out to a special agent</text>
  <text start="630.72" dur="3.57">in the Washington field office who then</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="6.18">retired and never brought back the</text>
  <text start="634.29" dur="8.28">evidence either it was destroyed or was</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="5.76">never reported it is my perception and</text>
  <text start="642.57" dur="4.37">that of many others that the ID is a</text>
  <text start="644.55" dur="5.1">highly political division within the FBI</text>
  <text start="646.94" dur="4.99">special agents and Supervisory special</text>
  <text start="649.65" dur="4.44">agents are selected for or volunteer for</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="4.38">these positions to advance their careers</text>
  <text start="654.09" dur="3.99">and they must prove themselves as team</text>
  <text start="656.31" dur="3.9">players it&amp;#39;s difficult for me to</text>
  <text start="658.08" dur="3.91">envision an investigation of my concerns</text>
  <text start="660.21" dur="6.1">performed by these inspectors</text>
  <text start="661.99" dur="6.06">be free of bias it was clear from my</text>
  <text start="666.31" dur="3.6">interaction with the inspectors they</text>
  <text start="668.05" dur="3.87">were not open to any information outside</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="3.27">of their preconceived notions they</text>
  <text start="671.92" dur="4.229">wouldn&amp;#39;t let me read my prepared</text>
  <text start="673.18" dur="4.68">statement and they threatened to leave</text>
  <text start="676.149" dur="3.571">the interview if I tried and not</text>
  <text start="677.86" dur="3.36">returned additionally when they were</text>
  <text start="679.72" dur="3.3">interviewing another whistleblower that</text>
  <text start="681.22" dur="4.2">worked with him to try and uncover this</text>
  <text start="683.02" dur="4.379">they displayed the same attitude kandel</text>
  <text start="685.42" dur="3.69">is his name he was retired from the FBI</text>
  <text start="687.399" dur="3.031">with 40 years of experience and had</text>
  <text start="689.11" dur="2.84">detailed knowledge of the problems</text>
