  <text start="0" dur="5.31">good morning everyone I wanted to take a</text>
  <text start="3" dur="6.24">few minutes today to go through dr. Rand</text>
  <text start="5.31" dur="6.06">Paul Senator Rand Paul a ho bomber care</text>
  <text start="9.24" dur="4.97">replacement act and I wanted to talk</text>
  <text start="11.37" dur="6.48">briefly about Trump&amp;#39;s executive orders</text>
  <text start="14.21" dur="5.14">none of which are legislating basically</text>
  <text start="17.85" dur="4.05">what he&amp;#39;s doing is providing guidance</text>
  <text start="19.35" dur="7.61">especially in the executive order on the</text>
  <text start="21.9" dur="7.5">individual mandate to give power back to</text>
  <text start="26.96" dur="6.18">localities to decide on how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="3.74">going to enforce the individual mandate</text>
  <text start="33.59" dur="7.93">it&amp;#39;s very simple and straightforward I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="5.461">going to link it below for you guys to</text>
  <text start="41.52" dur="5.34">read it&amp;#39;s really important that the</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="6.719">president is not legislating using</text>
  <text start="46.86" dur="5.31">executive order it&amp;#39;s really important</text>
  <text start="49.829" dur="5.941">and it&amp;#39;s really great it shows that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="52.17" dur="6.33">going to adhere to the Constitution so</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="6.21">here we go Obamacare&amp;#39;s replacement which</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="5.28">is a breath of fresh air I mean when</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.17">they said repeal and replace I was</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="5.37">really worried because I assumed any</text>
  <text start="66.15" dur="5.46">government government you know sponsored</text>
  <text start="69.15" dur="4.5">health care plan would be bad news but</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="3.72">this one is not really a</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="6.24">government-sponsored health care plan</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="7.05">its guidance and its freedom repealing</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="5.31">Obamacare effective as of the date of</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="4.559">this bill the individual mandate and the</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="2.88">employer mandate as well as community</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="2.941">rating restrictions rate review</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="4.17">essential health benefits requirement</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="5.01">medical loss ratio and other insurance</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="4.17">mandates are repealed it does still</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="3.96">productive projects in to protect</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="5.25">individuals with pre-existing conditions</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="3.72">it provides a two-year open enrollment</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="3.03">which means that people with</text>
  <text start="102.57" dur="5.1">pre-existing conditions have an open</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="4.89">enrollment period to enroll with our</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="4.729">healthcare providers and it restores</text>
  <text start="109.59" dur="8.73">HIPAA pre-existing conditions</text>
  <text start="112.399" dur="8.351">protections so HIPAA before Obamacare</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="4.229">guaranteed that people within the market</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="5.13">could obtain coverage of pre-existing</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="5.701">condition and have continued with</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="5.88">coverage so it brings that back</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="5.7">it gives you some tax benefits</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="3.6">individuals who receive health insurance</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="4.16">through an employer able to exclude the</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="5.22">premium amount from their taxable income</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="3.88">that subsidies not available for those</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="3.18">who don&amp;#39;t receive their insurance</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="4.11">through an employer but instead shop on</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="4.02">the individual market that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="146.1" dur="4.5">because there are plenty of benefits for</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="5.46">you below if that&amp;#39;s you so if you choose</text>
  <text start="150.6" dur="4.53">not to receive health care from your</text>
  <text start="153.24" dur="3.92">employer there are many options</text>
  <text start="155.13" dur="5.76">available to you which will get through</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="6.31">it provides a universal deduction on</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="4.53">both income and payroll taxes regardless</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="4.5">of how an individual obtains their</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="4.62">health insurance so they can you know</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;ll basically open up competition to</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="4.88">the extent that Americans can choose you</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="5.73">know they&amp;#39;re not going to be usually</text>
  <text start="174.92" dur="4.6">health care given to us by our employer</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="3.839">is is better because there are more</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="3.66">people you know the bigger the company</text>
  <text start="181.709" dur="3.121">the better the coverage the more people</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="4.61">buy it the cheaper it is that was</text>
  <text start="184.83" dur="5.07">something that was unavailable to</text>
  <text start="187.79" dur="4.06">entrepreneurs and individuals who are</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="5.52">working for themselves and individuals</text>
  <text start="191.85" dur="5.4">who are unemployed they were the high</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="4.349">risk and put into a different bracket</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="5.79">and had to pay a lot more these tax</text>
  <text start="199.769" dur="4.921">subsidies allow for Americans to</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="3.03">purchase insurance independent of</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="4.019">employment and it does not interfere</text>
  <text start="206.07" dur="4.71">with employer-provided coverage for</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="4.891">Americans who preferred the employer</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="4.23">provided coverage this whole bill is</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="2.52">just amazing and please I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="3.89">bore you with this it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="5.16">few minutes but I hope that it helps</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="4.03">provides individuals the option of a tax</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="3.78">credit of up to five thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="4.44">per taxpayer for contributions to a</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="5.82">health savings account so basically what</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="5.25">a health savings account is is pre-tax</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="3.389">dollars that you put into account that</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="3">you can use to pay for your health care</text>
  <text start="234.269" dur="2.97">so you&amp;#39;re not taking money out of your</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="4.38">pocket that&amp;#39;s been already taxed and</text>
  <text start="237.239" dur="5.701">using that to pay for doctor&amp;#39;s bills or</text>
  <text start="240" dur="4.68">co-pays or medications because this has</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="5.13">opened up to medications now it will get</text>
  <text start="244.68" dur="8.58">to you are using pre-tax dollars to pay</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="7.169">that pay those funds and you can use it</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="3.96">as well guess you was opened up to</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="3.601">health savings account greater than the</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="4.35">five thousand dollar cap that exists on</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="3.269">it on it now it removes the maximum</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="2.64">allowable</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="4.05">contribution so individuals can make</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.34">unlimited contributions to a health</text>
  <text start="266.159" dur="5.04">savings account and it eliminates the</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="3.03">requirement that a participant in health</text>
  <text start="271.199" dur="3.24">savings accounts be enrolled in a high</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="3.989">deductible health care plan so as it</text>
  <text start="274.439" dur="3.75">stands right now the only way you could</text>
  <text start="276.569" dur="3.271">use a health savings account would be if</text>
  <text start="278.189" dur="3.391">you had a high deductible plan which</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="3">basically nullifies your insurance is</text>
  <text start="281.58" dur="4.589">anyone who has a high deductible plan</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="5.43">which is most people are aware it will</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="4.291">nullify the requirement that you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="4.32">high deductible plan and anyone in any</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="6.509">health plan will be able to use a health</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="6.27">savings account this would also enable</text>
  <text start="296.969" dur="5.13">individuals who are eligible for</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="4.89">Medicare VA TRICARE IHS and health</text>
  <text start="302.099" dur="5.22">sharing ministries to be eligible to</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="5.49">establish an HSA that&amp;#39;s amazing right</text>
  <text start="307.319" dur="3.361">there because there are health care</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="3.419">sharing ministries right now where you</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="4.169">can get health care through your church</text>
  <text start="312.659" dur="4.53">which everybody was opting to do because</text>
  <text start="314.849" dur="3.81">it was a private solution where it was</text>
  <text start="317.189" dur="4.2">individuals pulled together and it was</text>
  <text start="318.659" dur="5.78">very specific so in other words if you</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="6.921">were pro-life or pro-choice per se and</text>
  <text start="324.439" dur="5.831">you want a birth control obviously the</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="3.539">ministry&amp;#39;s health care plans wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="7.049">cover that because it was against their</text>
  <text start="331.849" dur="9.611">ideology well this comes vistas will go</text>
  <text start="337.319" dur="5.791">down changes all that as well it allows</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="3.179">prescription and over-the-counter drug</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="4.769">costs to be treated as allowable</text>
  <text start="344.639" dur="9.87">expenses of hsas that means if you</text>
  <text start="347.879" dur="9.21">wanted to go and you wanted to go and</text>
  <text start="354.509" dur="4.71">buy aspirin or cold medicine you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.089" dur="5.491">use your HSA to do that now this allows</text>
  <text start="359.219" dur="5.641">you to do that also purchase of health</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="4.32">insurance from your HSA account if you</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="3.809">wanted to purchase individual health</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="3.689">care for yourself outside of your</text>
  <text start="368.669" dur="3.65">employer you could still have a health</text>
  <text start="370.589" dur="5.491">savings accounts through your employer</text>
  <text start="372.319" dur="7.361">where funds are deposited before tax</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="5.79">deductions into this account at your</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="4.62">discretion however much you want with no</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="4.229">limit and you could use those pre-tax</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="3.75">dollars to buy your health insurance so</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s basically opening up such freedom</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="3.209">for the individual to be able to</text>
  <text start="389.879" dur="3.78">purchase the health plan that they want</text>
  <text start="391.259" dur="4.291">and some people would argue well there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.659" dur="3.301">not much available there&amp;#39;s not much</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="5.75">you know that that&amp;#39;s there in the pool</text>
  <text start="396.96" dur="4.34">well this bill addresses that as well</text>
  <text start="401.36" dur="4.24">medical expenses incurred prior to</text>
  <text start="403.74" dur="3.66">accounts establishment allows qualified</text>
  <text start="405.6" dur="3.48">expenses incurred prior to at HSA</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="4.47">establishment to be reimbursed from an</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="4.23">HSA as long as the account is</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="4.56">established prior to tax following</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="5.13">filing which means that let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="416.43" dur="4.02">pretend this bill gets passed on Friday</text>
  <text start="418.44" dur="4.89">and it goes through the house and senate</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="4.83">and everything&amp;#39;s grand everything you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="423.33" dur="3.87">spent on health care for the previous</text>
  <text start="425.28" dur="7.83">year that you were not allowed to use an</text>
  <text start="427.2" dur="10.86">HSA for is now reimbursable if you</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="8.01">create an HH HSA in other words if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="6.24">understanding correctly you can take the</text>
  <text start="441.12" dur="5.01">money that you make from your HSA that</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="4.86">the pre-tax dollars and put them back in</text>

  <text start="467.7" dur="4.44">take that money back into your own</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.92">pocket as a sort of deduction in quotes</text>
  <text start="472.14" dur="4.8">to compensate you for having to pay out</text>
  <text start="474.33" dur="4.25">post tax dollars on the things that</text>
  <text start="476.94" dur="6.63">you&amp;#39;ve purchased for the previous year</text>
  <text start="478.58" dur="7.48">talk about friendly allowing HSA roll</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="5.19">over to a child or parent that means</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="8.18">that if you are the insured and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="8.97">covering your child or your spouse or</text>
