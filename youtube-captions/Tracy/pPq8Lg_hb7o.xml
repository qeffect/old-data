  <text start="84.6" dur="14.07">we&amp;#39;re going to start with today is this</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="11.699">one about intent from King and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="98.67" dur="2.94">make the volume on this any louder so I</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="3.21">just want you guys to listen to it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="3.63">about five minutes just on the unsecured</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="5.43">server between Hillary Rodham Clinton</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="5.85">and President Barack Obama I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="5.481">the exact number we can go back and look</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="7.29">we we understood he was one of 13</text>
  <text start="114.53" dur="6.28">individuals in that do you have any</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="3.87">sense of the volume that was exchanged</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="3.989">between the Secretary of State and the</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="4.77">president I can get back to you on that</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="3.901">I&amp;#39;d have to refresh my recollection on</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="2.73">that one at this point you don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="4.2">sense of that volume</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="5.28">I just don&amp;#39;t done and then do you</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="6.41">do you have the information or a sense</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="8.97">of were those emails secret top secret</text>
  <text start="139.31" dur="6.16">classified my recollection is as I sit</text>
  <text start="144" dur="4.26">here that they were not among the</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="5.01">classified material but I&amp;#39;m not certain</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="3.63">of that so I need to go back and</text>
  <text start="150.48" dur="3.179">double-check and I want to ask you</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="3.42">formally that you produce those records</text>
  <text start="153.659" dur="4.05">for us I think it&amp;#39;s essential of this</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="4.14">committee understand those facts is</text>
  <text start="157.709" dur="3.901">surrounding that and I&amp;#39;ll get to that</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="4.47">hopefully in a moment could you point</text>
  <text start="161.61" dur="4.92">out to us your first encounter with the</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="8.189">replacement of the words from the</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="7.44">statute in in 793 gross negligence with</text>
  <text start="172.109" dur="3.871">the words extreme carelessness the first</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="4.829">encounter with that switch that was back</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="4.83">in May as this as the drafts were of the</text>
  <text start="178.799" dur="5.58">Comey statement that as the drafts were</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="6.539">evolving into June and were the</text>
  <text start="184.379" dur="6.211">fingerprints of Peter struck on that</text>
  <text start="187.349" dur="5.7">exchange yes anyone else&amp;#39;s fingerprints</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="5.91">on that exchange I believe Miss Paige as</text>
  <text start="193.049" dur="5.461">well and what about James Comey had he I</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="3.63">was very much in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="5.099">drafting that was going over three of</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="5.28">them were in communication and drafting</text>
  <text start="203.609" dur="3.571">that so it&amp;#39;d be hard to identify exactly</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="3.509">who inserted it the first time is that</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="3.63">fair analysis I think we actually do</text>
  <text start="208.919" dur="3.031">have some idea of how it got changed and</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="2.88">who put it in but not necessarily</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="4.98">because it was their decision as opposed</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="5.46">to who was the sort of scribe on it as</text>
  <text start="216.93" dur="3.69">opposed to the decision-maker I would</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="3.57">like a little bit more if we came down</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="4.14">that to if he could mr. Horowitz yes and</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="5.43">so while we&amp;#39;re searching back for the</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="4.89">genesis of extreme carelessness at the</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.07">replacement for the statutory language</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="6.269">of gross negligence could you inform the</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="5.04">committee here as to the genesis of the</text>
  <text start="235.919" dur="5.88">word intent as it found its way into</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="5.129">this dialogue so it looks like in a</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="3.631">variety of discussions with the team and</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="4.261">the prosecutors the investigative team</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="5.01">from the Afghan and the prosecutors that</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="4.799">the focus was on in a significant way</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="3.509">there were other factors as well here</text>
  <text start="252.449" dur="6.09">but in a significant way the focus was</text>
  <text start="253.949" dur="7.111">on the fact that the classified material</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="4.861">that was transiting through the email</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="5.1">server was not clearly marked as you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="6.15">supposed to have it marked with banners</text>
  <text start="266.16" dur="5.88">it is classified in what more clarifying</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="5.58">my question actually the insertion of</text>
  <text start="272.04" dur="6.99">the word intent as a condition to a</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="6.18">violation of 793 that when did that word</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="4.32">first in find itself in the dialogue</text>
  <text start="281.31" dur="5.67">that you looked at that is in the</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="5.34">dialogue months earlier well before the</text>
  <text start="286.98" dur="3.06">investigation reached it&amp;#39;s about when</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="5.39">would you guess that is the months</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="9.03">earlier I&amp;#39;d have time in 2016 it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="6.73">2016 not in 2015 I&amp;#39;m not sure whether it</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="3.24">went back that far although frankly it</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="4.68">could have because there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="5.51">indication that early on people thought</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="5.52">that it was unlikely let me assert that</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="6.43">the evidence I&amp;#39;m looking at suggests</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="6.75">that President Barack Obama spoke that</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="6.45">word into law and that tape program</text>
  <text start="317.76" dur="5.55">October 10th of 2015 he said Hillary</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="6.15">Clinton was careless but not intentional</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="7.05">that program was aired on October 11th</text>
  <text start="326.85" dur="6.06">CBS 60 minutes and I have the article</text>
  <text start="330.36" dur="4.98">printed in New York Times that&amp;#39;s dated</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="4.74">the 16th of October the article that</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="4.2">references the October 11th where it</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="3.66">says in this article quote mr. Obama</text>
  <text start="339.54" dur="4.35">said he had no impression that mrs.</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="4.2">Clinton had purposely tried quote to</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="3.93">hide something or to squirrel away</text>
  <text start="345.51" dur="4.89">information close quote continuing in</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="5.13">doing so mr. Obama spoke directly to a</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="5.31">core component of the law used against</text>
  <text start="352.95" dur="5.19">mr. Petraeus intent and said he did not</text>
  <text start="355.71" dur="5.33">think it applied in mrs. Clinton&amp;#39;s case</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="5.58">so I&amp;#39;m gonna suggest that the president</text>
  <text start="361.04" dur="4.33">suggested that language through the open</text>
  <text start="363.72" dur="4.91">medium and spoke the word into the law</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="6">that it require intent which shows up</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="8.19">throughout in the following months in</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="8.79">particular in James commis July 5th 2016</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="5.71">exoneration well let&amp;#39;s say a summary of</text>
  <text start="380.16" dur="5.64">the prosecution / exoneration statement</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="4.92">six times that word intent and I find it</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="3.45">no place else would you have any</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="4.469">comments on your thoughts of how that</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="4.2">might have been the the genesis might</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="3.391">have gone back to the president United</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="3.36">States on that idea I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="3">that was necessarily the genesis we</text>
  <text start="396.81" dur="2.34">don&amp;#39;t have evidence of that but we do</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="3.9">have in here</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="5.97">as you noted references to the</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="5.16">statements made by President Obama and</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="5.12">by his press secretary and the concerns</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="6.57">that those raised and the issues that</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="6.94">and how it was viewed and perceived by</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="4.89">the team so what I learned from this</text>
  <text start="417.18" dur="3.45">little exchange and from reading the</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="3.6">report in these sections just from my</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="5.46">kind of kind of commentary on this is</text>
  <text start="422.43" dur="6.06">that you know Horowitz is actually from</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="6.3">from the way the investigation was done</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="8.4">into the investigation the but most of</text>
  <text start="432.39" dur="7.2">the people prosecuting this case for the</text>
  <text start="436.89" dur="7.56">most part from what I read so far didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="439.59" dur="7.5">seem to care one iota necessarily who</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="7.2">was doing you know who wasn&amp;#39;t involved</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="7.92">in this a lot of them it just seems like</text>
  <text start="451.65" dur="6.5">this Obama thing was much more so</text>
  <text start="455.01" dur="6.75">engineered at the very very very top</text>
  <text start="458.15" dur="6.19">because there are real-time emails and</text>
  <text start="461.76" dur="6.18">text messages etc that the the IG was</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="6.15">able to recover that proved that the</text>
  <text start="467.94" dur="4.83">agents and the prosecutors were very</text>
  <text start="470.49" dur="4.2">upset about this and you know Loretta</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="5.64">Lynch sort of chimes in here too but I</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t know that I believe her I know</text>
  <text start="478.41" dur="3.99">that you guys are gonna laugh at the way</text>
  <text start="480.51" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;m saying I don&amp;#39;t know if I believe her</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="4.86">but I really think that this wasn&amp;#39;t an</text>
  <text start="485.25" dur="4.11">accident and that even if he was just</text>
  <text start="487.26" dur="4.5">seeding the public sphere with the</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="4.56">thought of it the fact that later on it</text>
  <text start="491.76" dur="4.82">comes back in the exoneration so many</text>
  <text start="493.92" dur="4.89">times is very telling I think that um</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="5.86">King did a really good job of laying</text>
  <text start="498.81" dur="5.67">this out here in this clip and the fact</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="4.58">that Barack Obama emailed on a private</text>
  <text start="504.48" dur="4.95">server and knew that she was doing it so</text>
  <text start="507.02" dur="4.21">it&amp;#39;s a culture thing and they were</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="3.12">trying to get around FOIA we know the</text>
  <text start="511.23" dur="3.39">problems they&amp;#39;re having with the Library</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="3.45">of Congress we understand I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="3.69">to reinvent the wheel and go through all</text>
  <text start="516" dur="4.26">that stuff with you here&amp;#39;s the next clip</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="7.17">I had on tap for the one yesterday that</text>
  <text start="520.26" dur="7.74">I cut short this is a clip about the</text>
  <text start="525.48" dur="4.98">Clinton Foundation in uranium one and</text>
  <text start="528" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s a very odd assertion and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="530.46" dur="2.37">listen to it and then I&amp;#39;ll talk about it</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="3.27">yes</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="4.59">it now appears that Attorney General&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1920.47" dur="3.449">it&amp;#39;s not a final decision and he is</text>
  <text start="1922.33" dur="4.439">working with them to try and get them to</text>
  <text start="1923.919" dur="4.31">let let him release the names he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1926.769" dur="7.86">talked about that several times</text>
  <text start="1928.229" dur="8.02">throughout the hearing this one is</text>
  <text start="1934.629" dur="5.22">another interesting one and and this</text>
  <text start="1936.249" dur="5.341">cristiano morty congressperson was one</text>
  <text start="1939.849" dur="3.361">of the only there were three people</text>

  <text start="1945.849" dur="4.68">couple weeks ago this gentleman was one</text>
  <text start="1947.979" dur="4.861">of them the chair who I believe was</text>
  <text start="1950.529" dur="4.08">Grassley picked just three people to go</text>
  <text start="1952.84" dur="3.779">in and listen to those hearings this</text>
  <text start="1954.609" dur="4.981">gentleman was one of them he is very</text>
  <text start="1956.619" dur="4.86">polite in that he lets other people like</text>
  <text start="1959.59" dur="5.039">he lets Horowitz finish speaking however</text>
  <text start="1961.479" dur="7.08">you&amp;#39;ll see the arrogance and the sarcasm</text>
  <text start="1964.629" dur="5.75">in his questioning and answers and he</text>
  <text start="1968.559" dur="4.74">makes a very interesting point about</text>
  <text start="1970.379" dur="5.441">struck on page not leaking about Trump</text>
  <text start="1973.299" dur="4.171">Russia and again I want to call to your</text>
  <text start="1975.82" dur="4.829">attention that the reason why they were</text>
  <text start="1977.47" dur="8.389">not leaking about Trump Russia in the</text>
  <text start="1980.649" dur="5.21">way that they James Comey spoke about</text>
  <text start="1987.359" dur="6.55">the mid-year exam is because they were</text>
  <text start="1990.22" dur="5.789">the ones that were guilty in that they</text>
  <text start="1993.909" dur="3.4">were spying and cloaking it as an</text>
  <text start="1996.009" dur="4.12">investigation there</text>
  <text start="1997.309" dur="4.23">in a real investigation so the of course</text>
  <text start="2000.129" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re not gonna leak it because they</text>
  <text start="2001.539" dur="6.901">need to obtain information so it&amp;#39;s in an</text>
  <text start="2004.059" dur="6.931">asinine defense that they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="2008.44" dur="4.53">besides it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s against policy to talk</text>
  <text start="2010.99" dur="4.799">about an ongoing investigation and if I</text>
  <text start="2012.97" dur="5.909">really want it to go into this I could</text>
  <text start="2015.789" dur="5.87">easily spend a couple hours and pull up</text>
  <text start="2018.879" dur="6.03">all the articles that came out that</text>
  <text start="2021.659" dur="5.441">talked about this in some way shape or</text>
  <text start="2024.909" dur="4.041">form whether they reference a</text>
  <text start="2027.1" dur="5.13">counterintelligence operation or</text>
  <text start="2028.95" dur="5.979">investigation or not they allude to the</text>
  <text start="2032.23" dur="4.38">fact that there is a problem the reason</text>
  <text start="2034.929" dur="6.69">why this was kept so quiet is because</text>
  <text start="2036.61" dur="7.23">they didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to know and who</text>
  <text start="2041.619" dur="6.45">made the decision got it got it now let</text>
  <text start="2043.84" dur="7.499">me take you to another point you would</text>
  <text start="2048.069" dur="5.221">agree with me that Jim Comey although he</text>
  <text start="2051.339" dur="4.02">did announce that there was an</text>
  <text start="2053.29" dur="4.799">investigation into Hillary Clinton did</text>
  <text start="2055.359" dur="6.181">not announce any investigation into</text>
  <text start="2058.089" dur="6.931">Donald Trump correct in October in that</text>
  <text start="2061.54" dur="5.849">fall period he did not announce a the</text>
  <text start="2065.02" dur="3.51">ongoing Russia investigation or the for</text>
  <text start="2067.389" dur="3.93">that matter as I said the Clinton</text>
  <text start="2068.53" dur="4.17">Foundation Frank so he again clarifies</text>
  <text start="2071.319" dur="3.03">it wasn&amp;#39;t just the Trump Russia</text>
  <text start="2072.7" dur="4.649">investigation was also the Clinton</text>
  <text start="2074.349" dur="4.711">Foundation investigation trying to make</text>
  <text start="2077.349" dur="3.901">the distinction for this gentleman and</text>
  <text start="2079.06" dur="4.92">he&amp;#39;s like yeah correct</text>
  <text start="2081.25" dur="5.159">all you know I don&amp;#39;t think he realized</text>
  <text start="2083.98" dur="6.27">he was gonna say that he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="2086.409" dur="6.45">make the distinction Horowitz is that he</text>
  <text start="2090.25" dur="5.099">also kept another Clinton investigation</text>
  <text start="2092.859" dur="3.841">quiet so stop trying to make it like he</text>
  <text start="2095.349" dur="5.821">was trying to help Trump in other words</text>
  <text start="2096.7" dur="7.35">issue now struck and Paige if they</text>
  <text start="2101.17" dur="4.59">wanted to really tank Donald Trump the</text>
  <text start="2104.05" dur="3.87">way that some of my colleagues assert</text>
  <text start="2105.76" dur="4.23">that they wanted to do could have leaked</text>
  <text start="2107.92" dur="3.78">that this investigation was happening</text>
  <text start="2109.99" dur="4.77">but you did not uncover any evidence</text>
  <text start="2111.7" dur="5.43">that stricken Paige did that did you we</text>
  <text start="2114.76" dur="4.109">did not uncover evidence that they</text>
  <text start="2117.13" dur="3.36">disclosed the Russian investigation and</text>
  <text start="2118.869" dur="4.681">that was one of the arguments their</text>
  <text start="2120.49" dur="4.92">lawyers made as to their conduct is and</text>
  <text start="2123.55" dur="5.97">in fact there&amp;#39;s no evidence in your</text>
  <text start="2125.41" dur="5.82">report that anybody leaked evidence of</text>
  <text start="2129.52" dur="5.46">an can going in vest</text>
  <text start="2131.23" dur="6.9">into Donald Trump in Russia correct we</text>
  <text start="2134.98" dur="6.03">didn&amp;#39;t touch on the Russia investigation</text>
  <text start="2138.13" dur="6.12">in this this was focused on the Clinton</text>
  <text start="2141.01" dur="4.829">email investigation I will say that</text>
  <text start="2144.25" dur="4.109">obviously we&amp;#39;re looking at the leak</text>
  <text start="2145.839" dur="4.171">question that&amp;#39;s could be a broader</text>
  <text start="2148.359" dur="4.411">question depending upon what we find</text>
  <text start="2150.01" dur="4.589">sure but in this report this is what</text>
  <text start="2152.77" dur="3.48">does not reference that correct that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2154.599" dur="3.541">what I thought thank you that&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="2156.25" dur="4.14">answer that&amp;#39;s not the answer that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2158.14" dur="3.75">what I thought no he&amp;#39;s saying we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2160.39" dur="4.56">even look into that it doesn&amp;#39;t reference</text>
  <text start="2161.89" dur="8.99">it not that it didn&amp;#39;t happen mr. Chris</text>
  <text start="2164.95" dur="13.86">Moore T Krishnamurti Krishnamurti yeah</text>
  <text start="2170.88" dur="9.55">that&amp;#39;s right dot I&amp;#39;m bad I&amp;#39;m bad this is</text>
  <text start="2178.81" dur="4.47">my second time third time listening to</text>
  <text start="2180.43" dur="5.28">this so you know take it for what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2183.28" dur="11.069">worth Desjarlais this is an interesting</text>
  <text start="2185.71" dur="11.48">one too I don&amp;#39;t know our ongoing review</text>
  <text start="2194.349" dur="4.891">now I assume you watch the news</text>
  <text start="2197.19" dur="7.33">occasionally hold on I got a set this</text>
  <text start="2199.24" dur="7.74">one out he&amp;#39;s gonna talk about the</text>
  <text start="2204.52" dur="5.67">mainstream media and I want you to watch</text>
  <text start="2206.98" dur="4.47">Horowitz very closely okay I just wanted</text>
  <text start="2210.19" dur="3.419">to clarify let me make this fullscreen</text>
  <text start="2211.45" dur="4.5">here that we&amp;#39;re looking at in our</text>
  <text start="2213.609" dur="4.98">ongoing review now I assume you watch</text>
  <text start="2215.95" dur="4.29">the news occasionally I try not to</text>
  <text start="2218.589" dur="4.111">actually as much as perhaps I have in</text>
  <text start="2220.24" dur="5.16">the past do you believe that there is</text>
  <text start="2222.7" dur="4.29">anti-trump bias in the news not as</text>
  <text start="2225.4" dur="3.689">Inspector General but just as a private</text>
  <text start="2226.99" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;m not gonna pine on that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2229.089" dur="3">have an opinion as a private I might</text>
  <text start="2230.56" dur="4.23">have a private citizen appear you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2232.089" dur="4.471">adhere okay would it surprise you to</text>
  <text start="2234.79" dur="7.17">know that 90% of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="2236.56" dur="6.15">coverage is anti Trump again wouldn&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="2241.96" dur="4.23">an opinion on that</text>
  <text start="2242.71" dur="4.859">congressman okay would it be safe to</text>
  <text start="2246.19" dur="2.73">assume that FBI agents and attorneys</text>
  <text start="2247.569" dur="4.26">watch the mainstream news</text>
  <text start="2248.92" dur="4.74">I assume the public at large does and</text>
  <text start="2251.829" dur="3.961">since they&amp;#39;re part of that I assume they</text>
  <text start="2253.66" dur="3.689">do okay so I guess what I&amp;#39;m getting at</text>
  <text start="2255.79" dur="3.87">it wouldn&amp;#39;t it be fair to conclude that</text>
  <text start="2257.349" dur="4.201">some of them I just want to death I just</text>
  <text start="2259.66" dur="3.63">want head I know I keep stopping it I</text>
  <text start="2261.55" dur="3.279">just want to reference for you guys how</text>
  <text start="2263.29" dur="4.09">meticulously and logic</text>
  <text start="2264.829" dur="4.051">Klee Horowitz approaches the answers to</text>
  <text start="2267.38" dur="4.379">his questions remember he&amp;#39;s under oath</text>
  <text start="2268.88" dur="5.669">so he has to systematically like and</text>
  <text start="2271.759" dur="5.431">logically break down a if this then that</text>
  <text start="2274.549" dur="4.26">than this and he does it in a masterful</text>
  <text start="2277.19" dur="3.21">way this is the way the reports are</text>
  <text start="2278.809" dur="6.75">written even the mid-year exam report</text>
  <text start="2280.4" dur="9.599">that everybody hated so just wanted to</text>
  <text start="2285.559" dur="6.3">throw that out there biased coverage has</text>
  <text start="2289.999" dur="4.02">impacted their ability to fairly conduct</text>
  <text start="2291.859" dur="4.14">their investigation I couldn&amp;#39;t draw that</text>
  <text start="2294.019" dur="4.111">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to draw that</text>
  <text start="2295.999" dur="4.171">conclusion sitting here congressman okay</text>
  <text start="2298.13" dur="3.689">well your report highlighted some of the</text>
  <text start="2300.17" dur="3.24">most blatant anti-trump sentiments</text>
  <text start="2301.819" dur="4.41">within the FBI concerns me that this</text>
  <text start="2303.41" dur="5.52">problem is more pervasive than we think</text>
  <text start="2306.229" dur="4.77">the FBI is both bound remain neutral</text>
  <text start="2308.93" dur="4.2">enforce the law and partially and fairly</text>
  <text start="2310.999" dur="3.81">how can we accomplish this when there is</text>
  <text start="2313.13" dur="4.05">eight when there are agents that are</text>
  <text start="2314.809" dur="5.01">actively biased against our sitting</text>
  <text start="2317.18" dur="5.069">president look I think congressman you</text>
  <text start="2319.819" dur="5.64">know the I haven&amp;#39;t been an AUSA worked</text>
  <text start="2322.249" dur="5.58">with agents tremendous agents at the FBI</text>
  <text start="2325.459" dur="4.64">and other law enforcement agencies the</text>
  <text start="2327.829" dur="4.53">one thing I thought we all understood is</text>
  <text start="2330.099" dur="5.77">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re entitled to be and you</text>
  <text start="2332.359" dur="5.25">should be part of the your the public</text>
  <text start="2335.869" dur="3.87">the government the democracy that we</text>
  <text start="2337.609" dur="3.45">live in but when you get to the war to</text>
  <text start="2339.739" dur="3.3">your office you&amp;#39;ll leave your views</text>
  <text start="2341.059" dur="5.16">outside the door when you walk through</text>
  <text start="2343.039" dur="5.641">and you just focus on your work the law</text>
  <text start="2346.219" dur="4.951">the evidence and that&amp;#39;s what you focus</text>
  <text start="2348.68" dur="3.419">on knowing what you know though if you</text>
  <text start="2351.17" dur="2.849">were the subject of the investigation</text>
  <text start="2352.099" dur="3.87">and knowing that the people you just</text>
  <text start="2354.019" dur="4.921">investigated were the ones doing the</text>
  <text start="2355.969" dur="5.61">work would you not be concerned look I</text>
  <text start="2358.94" dur="4.559">think again it goes to what I just said</text>
  <text start="2361.579" dur="6.811">there are I was a public corruption</text>
  <text start="2363.499" dur="6.71">prosecutor and the key the most</text>
  <text start="2368.39" dur="4.29">important thing I supervised our unit</text>
  <text start="2370.209" dur="4.75">people who were working on those cases</text>
  <text start="2372.68" dur="4.559">needed to leave whatever their views</text>
  <text start="2374.959" dur="4.14">were outside the office they needed to</text>
  <text start="2377.239" dur="4.911">come in and be committed to focusing</text>
  <text start="2379.099" dur="8.4">only on the facts in the law but that so</text>
  <text start="2382.15" dur="7.48">take that for what it&amp;#39;s worth this was a</text>
  <text start="2387.499" dur="4.2">great exchange to this is Gowdy and</text>
  <text start="2389.63" dur="3.3">Horowitz having a friendly lawyerly talk</text>
  <text start="2391.699" dur="3.39">look at how they interact with one</text>
  <text start="2392.93" dur="3.72">another watch that carefully it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2395.089" dur="3.451">been in every exchange they&amp;#39;ve had I</text>
  <text start="2396.65" dur="4.44">think it&amp;#39;s like a jovial kind</text>
  <text start="2398.54" dur="6.69">sparring back and forth amongst like</text>
  <text start="2401.09" dur="7.65">colleagues it&amp;#39;s pretty cool it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2405.23" dur="4.53">interesting point too you know for never</text>
  <text start="2408.74" dur="3.3">mind I&amp;#39;m not gonna say anything about</text>
  <text start="2409.76" dur="3.3">getting did not happen okay well I thank</text>
  <text start="2412.04" dur="2.28">you for time I&amp;#39;d like to yield the</text>
  <text start="2413.06" dur="4.71">balance of my time to our Chairman mr.</text>

  <text start="2417.77" dur="5.19">was I&amp;#39;m trying to understand the drafts</text>
  <text start="2420.86" dur="4.05">of the Comey memos indicated that the</text>
  <text start="2422.96" dur="4.05">missing element was the failure to</text>
  <text start="2424.91" dur="4.56">expose the material to potentially</text>
  <text start="2427.01" dur="4.08">hostile actors and then I&amp;#39;m going back</text>

  <text start="3082.18" dur="4.89">an investigation of Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3084.25" dur="4.41">emails the amazing thing is that the</text>
  <text start="3087.07" dur="3.36">majority chose to re-enter this maze</text>
  <text start="3088.66" dur="4.08">when your report was perfectly clear on</text>
  <text start="3090.43" dur="3.75">its findings and I quote we found no</text>
  <text start="3092.74" dur="3.45">evidence the conclusions by the</text>
  <text start="3094.18" dur="4.44">prosecutors were affected by bias or</text>
  <text start="3096.19" dur="3.54">other improper considerations rather we</text>
  <text start="3098.62" dur="3.66">determine they were based on the</text>
  <text start="3099.73" dur="4.2">prosecutors assessment so to me that</text>
  <text start="3102.28" dur="3.12">seems like somebody who was like I got</text>
  <text start="3103.93" dur="5.01">to get my talking points out but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3105.4" dur="5.1">want this to be - he seems like he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3113.71" dur="4.5">got it they all got a memo they got a</text>
  <text start="3115.24" dur="6.24">memo damn it of the facts the law and</text>
  <text start="3118.21" dur="4.44">the department practice indeed you seem</text>
  <text start="3121.48" dur="2.73">to find that the major case of</text>
  <text start="3122.65" dur="3.45">prosecutor are wrong during here took</text>
  <text start="3124.21" dur="4.08">place at the expense of Secretary</text>
  <text start="3126.1" dur="4.47">Clinton while director Comey properly</text>
  <text start="3128.29" dur="4.41">kept secret the FBI investigation of the</text>
  <text start="3130.57" dur="4.17">Trump campaigns involvement with Russian</text>
  <text start="3132.7" dur="4.35">agents throughout the campaign he</text>
  <text start="3134.74" dur="4.38">repeatedly ignored Department policy to</text>
  <text start="3137.05" dur="6.9">release information about the Clinton</text>
  <text start="3139.12" dur="10.62">email investigation let&amp;#39;s see we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="3149.74" dur="3.69">four five five five left let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="3151.9" dur="4.1">look at this and I&amp;#39;ll save the rest of</text>
  <text start="3153.43" dur="5.79">them actually I got to do this one too</text>
  <text start="3156" dur="6.01">and then we&amp;#39;ll save these last two for</text>
  <text start="3159.22" dur="8.16">the next video tomorrow here is a good</text>
  <text start="3162.01" dur="8.46">one about why why struck a pager texting</text>
  <text start="3167.38" dur="5.07">about excuse me surveillance after the</text>
  <text start="3170.47" dur="10.44">MIDI or exam and it&amp;#39;s actually very well</text>
  <text start="3172.45" dur="10.08">done right and so so let me look at four</text>
  <text start="3180.91" dur="2.88">other things that I need you to some</text>
  <text start="3182.53" dur="3.45">clarification because there are some</text>
  <text start="3183.79" dur="3.84">text messages we know that Peter struck</text>
  <text start="3185.98" dur="3.45">worked on both the Russia and the</text>
  <text start="3187.63" dur="4.17">Hillary investigation so I want to make</text>
  <text start="3189.43" dur="6.11">sure that these text messages don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3191.8" dur="6.12">apply to Hillary so on July the 29th</text>
  <text start="3195.54" dur="3.85">before the investigation into the</text>
  <text start="3197.92" dur="3.48">Russian investigations start</text>
  <text start="3199.39" dur="5.399">there was a text message that says do</text>
  <text start="3201.4" dur="4.649">you want us to reach out to Grievous and</text>
  <text start="3204.789" dur="3.691">I think they&amp;#39;re referring to get</text>
  <text start="3206.049" dur="3.81">Grevious Griggs at that particular point</text>
  <text start="3208.48" dur="3.78">they said well why do you want to do</text>
  <text start="3209.859" dur="4.801">that well we want to see if he actually</text>
  <text start="3212.26" dur="3.96">has the names that we already have now</text>
  <text start="3214.66" dur="3.179">I&amp;#39;m troubled by this a little bit did</text>
  <text start="3216.22" dur="5.129">that apply to the Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="3217.839" dur="5.25">investigation it was already closed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3221.349" dur="4.351">already closed I&amp;#39;d have to go back and</text>
  <text start="3223.089" dur="5.041">double okay why I&amp;#39;m curious is why would</text>
  <text start="3225.7" dur="6.78">they be checking with someone who his</text>
  <text start="3228.13" dur="6.75">specialty is quote FBI advanced</text>
  <text start="3232.48" dur="4.41">electronic surveillance why would he be</text>
  <text start="3234.88" dur="4.26">checking before a Russian investigation</text>
  <text start="3236.89" dur="5.55">is open with somebody who does</text>
  <text start="3239.14" dur="6.479">essentially bugging and monitoring to</text>
  <text start="3242.44" dur="5.01">find out anything that might have been</text>
  <text start="3245.619" dur="3.571">going on why would that have happened I</text>
  <text start="3247.45" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t know okay</text>
  <text start="3249.19" dur="5.46">so let me go on a little bit further</text>
  <text start="3250.93" dur="6.81">then the text message that says the</text>
  <text start="3254.65" dur="4.949">White House is running this which</text>
  <text start="3257.74" dur="3.75">happened on August 5th was that in</text>
  <text start="3259.599" dur="4.531">reference to Russia or a Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="3261.49" dur="5.099">our assumption and understanding was it</text>
  <text start="3264.13" dur="4.05">was not Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s matter because</text>
  <text start="3266.589" dur="3.51">that had been closed around that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="3268.18" dur="3.75">assumption as well and the one that says</text>
  <text start="3270.099" dur="3.66">that the president wants to know</text>
  <text start="3271.93" dur="4.05">everything about this that happened on</text>
  <text start="3273.759" dur="4.11">September 2nd was that with Hillary or</text>
  <text start="3275.98" dur="3.48">with the Russia investigation our</text>
  <text start="3277.869" dur="2.761">understanding is that would not have</text>
  <text start="3279.46" dur="3.899">been Hillary that would have been the</text>
  <text start="3280.63" dur="4.56">Russia manner yeah so looking at the</text>
  <text start="3283.359" dur="3.99">difference between the way that the</text>
  <text start="3285.19" dur="4.8">Hillary Clinton investigation was</text>
  <text start="3287.349" dur="4.321">notified in research versus the way that</text>
  <text start="3289.99" dur="4.079">it appears that the Russian</text>
  <text start="3291.67" dur="5.339">investigation did the administration the</text>
  <text start="3294.069" dur="5.04">previous administration take an abnormal</text>
  <text start="3297.009" dur="3.81">interest in all of that the gentleman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3299.109" dur="3.601">time has expired mr. inspector general</text>
  <text start="3300.819" dur="3.181">but you may answer I don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="3302.71" dur="3.54">answer to that at this point because</text>
  <text start="3304" dur="4.74">that was not part of this review but</text>
  <text start="3306.25" dur="3.9">certainly it&amp;#39;s something we as we look</text>
  <text start="3308.74" dur="4.109">at the matters that have been recently</text>
  <text start="3310.15" dur="4.05">referred to us we will be considering we</text>
  <text start="3312.849" dur="3.48">can answer that question really quickly</text>
  <text start="3314.2" dur="5.46">he was buying they were spying all of</text>
  <text start="3316.329" dur="5.671">them were spying and I think that we</text>
  <text start="3319.66" dur="4.169">could be fairly confident we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3322" dur="3.66">be learning about that very soon we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3323.829" dur="5.671">gonna close out with this tiny little</text>
  <text start="3325.66" dur="5.05">clip here that is very telling and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3329.5" dur="4.96">a good way to end this</text>
  <text start="3330.71" dur="6.06">otherwise frustrating video this is very</text>
