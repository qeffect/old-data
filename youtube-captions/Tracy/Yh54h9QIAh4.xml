  <text start="64.939" dur="3.871">know I think I would like to think the</text>
  <text start="67.07" dur="3.6">audience knows but basically the summary</text>
  <text start="68.81" dur="5.91">report came out and inside the summary</text>
  <text start="70.67" dur="6.51">it says three high-level FBI officials</text>
  <text start="74.72" dur="4.17">were managing a subcontractor and while</text>
  <text start="77.18" dur="3.93">they were managing the subcontractor the</text>
  <text start="78.89" dur="4.85">subcontractor performed what are known</text>
  <text start="81.11" dur="5.34">as inherent governmental activities and</text>
  <text start="83.74" dur="4.78">that&amp;#39;s against the rules big time</text>
  <text start="86.45" dur="3.66">because inherent governmental activities</text>
  <text start="88.52" dur="3.389">are things as sensitive as like counter</text>
  <text start="90.11" dur="4.95">to counter intelligence operations and</text>
  <text start="91.909" dur="4.831">things of that nature and then there was</text>
  <text start="95.06" dur="3.45">a personal conflict of interest and then</text>
  <text start="96.74" dur="3.239">there was also like a slap on the wrist</text>
  <text start="98.51" dur="6.66">for these not a slap on the wrist but</text>
  <text start="99.979" dur="8.041">like you know oh gosh like a condemning</text>
  <text start="105.17" dur="5.1">of what these three upper-level FBI</text>
  <text start="108.02" dur="4.62">officials did in managing the</text>
  <text start="110.27" dur="4.98">subcontractor and we know that the Peter</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="3.96">struck text messages say you know we</text>
  <text start="115.25" dur="3.15">have to move to wire carrying current</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="4.92">now because they couldn&amp;#39;t use the</text>
  <text start="118.4" dur="5.55">Patriot Act or the 702 database anymore</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="5.43">and we know all about how the 702</text>
  <text start="123.95" dur="5.25">database was abused by FBI contractors</text>
  <text start="126.95" dur="4.1">and through all the work we figured out</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="3.26">that fusion gps is</text>
  <text start="131.05" dur="6.27">this contractor that they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="132.46" dur="6.78">okay whew it is definitely fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="137.32" dur="4.53">which means that in the course of his</text>
  <text start="139.24" dur="4.35">work Horowitz found in the course of his</text>
  <text start="141.85" dur="3.18">fights that abuse work and possibly even</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="4.2">the dossier and I&amp;#39;ll get to that in a</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="5.79">second Horowitz found that fusion gps</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="4.38">was a government contractor working on</text>
  <text start="150.82" dur="4.26">behalf of the FBI</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="5.64">and not following any of the rules now I</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="3.99">found a court transcript and inside of</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="5.55">that court transcript</text>
  <text start="159.07" dur="6.96">it was fusion GPS took the their bank to</text>
  <text start="163.36" dur="3.72">court and a party on that lawsuit was</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="2.85">also the house permanent Select</text>
  <text start="167.08" dur="4.41">Committee on Intelligence who put out a</text>
  <text start="168.88" dur="4.95">subpoena for fusion gps&amp;#39;s bank records</text>
  <text start="171.49" dur="5.28">fusion GPS argues in court this is back</text>
  <text start="173.83" dur="5.43">in 2017 they argue in court we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="176.77" dur="4.71">want to prevent have to provide all of</text>
  <text start="179.26" dur="3.57">this expansive information it would ruin</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="3.75">our business we wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="182.83" dur="4.11">confidentiality anymore really pushing</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="3.27">back hard if they want to know about</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="3.66">what payments we made to Christopher</text>
  <text start="188.5" dur="4.05">steel will provide that information to</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="4.98">you to them in in this three-month</text>
  <text start="192.55" dur="6.24">window well the the government lawyer</text>
  <text start="195.58" dur="6.33">comes back and says actually we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="6.87">only want Christopher steel we want to</text>
  <text start="201.91" dur="5.22">find what kind of relationship fusion GP</text>
  <text start="205.66" dur="4.32">has had with the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="207.13" dur="4.17">this is in the court transcript so that</text>
  <text start="209.98" dur="3.44">means that the house permanent Select</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="4.439">Committee on Intelligence in 2017</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="4.18">suspected that fusion gps was a</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="4.381">government contractor and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="5.97">see the money trail to prove that they</text>
  <text start="220.12" dur="6.45">were those documents were were</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="4.47">eventually the records were the the</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="2.669">judge ordered they be released so that</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="3.449">the house permanent Select Committee on</text>
  <text start="229.239" dur="4.47">Intelligence got them so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="4.47">something that&amp;#39;s in the that&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="3.511">possession of the the committee this in</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="3.961">the possession of the committee likely</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="5.82">the Special Counsel likely Hoover likely</text>
  <text start="239.92" dur="6.51">Horowitz but and whereas in has been</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="6.84">under seal no leaking right exactly now</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="5.49">moving on from there we had John</text>
  <text start="249.88" dur="3.6">Solomon&amp;#39;s article come out the other day</text>
  <text start="251.92" dur="3.27">where he basically talks about</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="3.689">everything that Jeff already talked</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="4.5">about in terms of Bruce or Nellie or</text>
  <text start="257.169" dur="4.981">Nellie or handing over a thumb drive</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="4.07">with the dossier on it that she did</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="3.74">while she was at fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="4.86">remember Nellie auras contacts with the</text>
  <text start="265.89" dur="5.16">CIA work for the CIA that&amp;#39;ll lupine</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="4.38">Brennan now Nellie or was hired by</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="6.63">fusion GPS and was working on behalf of</text>
  <text start="273" dur="6.99">fusion GPS on this whole Trump saga she</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="5.52">hands information to her husband her</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="4.89">husband then submits it to the FBI then</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="3.36">we get the summary report saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="4.05">this massive personal conflict of</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="3.69">interest what do you think that conflict</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="4.8">of interest is on behalf of the</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="8.7">contractor do you think it could be</text>
  <text start="293.73" dur="8.63">Nellie or could have been so we get we</text>
  <text start="298.95" dur="6.96">get solomon using those specific words</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="5.77">conflict of interest in his article and</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="3.9">i&amp;#39;m like alright that&amp;#39;s it it hammers it</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="4.05">home for me even more now now I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="4.47">hundred percent positive but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="6.12">all my wheels started turning and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="6.66">like hold on a second here if Fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="5.76">is working as a contractor for the FBI</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="4.98">throughout this whole debacle doesn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="5.64">stand to reason that it&amp;#39;s entirely</text>
  <text start="325.92" dur="7.41">possible that not only was this dossier</text>
  <text start="329.7" dur="8.85">funded by the DNC but it was also funded</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="7.89">by the FBI yeah yeah I mean the funding</text>
  <text start="338.55" dur="4.68">is it&amp;#39;s all the people it&amp;#39;s the entire</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s the intelligence community itself</text>
  <text start="343.23" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s the DNC which at that time had been</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="5.07">taken over as a host I mean the the by</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="4.08">the parasite that was the Clinton</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="4.26">Foundation and then not only that but</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re all also remember what was the the</text>
  <text start="355.41" dur="4.89">Obama the Obama it wasn&amp;#39;t Obama for</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="4.5">America we just talked about them today</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="4.65">yeah I mean they went in on they they</text>
  <text start="363.03" dur="3.93">donated at least nine hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="4.17">dollars to that that what would amount</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="4.95">to twelve point four million dollars to</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="4.74">compose to compile that dossier or all</text>
  <text start="371.91" dur="3.81">that work or the multiple versions at</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="5.94">this point because we had the the whiner</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="5.67">the the the carry the State Department</text>
  <text start="379.8" dur="3.69">version over there with Jonathan Winer</text>
  <text start="381.39" dur="5.01">we had the steel version and now this</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="5.49">tower version that&amp;#39;s all and so you</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="5.01">think about this it&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.98" dur="5.16">the intelligence community itself it is</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="4.09">the official apparatus of the Democrat</text>
  <text start="394.14" dur="5.02">Party and of course</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="5.25">it is the city it is a organization of</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="3.99">the sitting president at that time</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="4.05">Barack Obama and they were all going in</text>
  <text start="403.15" dur="3.63">on it and you remember I think that that</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="5.16">was the funniest thing about the initial</text>
  <text start="406.78" dur="6.3">the initial phases of this disclosure</text>
  <text start="409.96" dur="6.03">about where the dossier came from it was</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="5.79">that that Hillary Clinton they did not</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="5.01">know what they were what it was about or</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="4.8">what was going to be coming from that</text>
  <text start="421" dur="5.1">dossier and all that stuff and I just</text>
  <text start="423.67" dur="4.14">laughed to myself thinking they spent 12</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="3.03">million dollars on something they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="3.48">know what they were going to get out of</text>
  <text start="429.13" dur="4.86">it and this was going to be a President</text>
  <text start="431.29" dur="4.71">of the United States not only that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="4.14">forget Christopher steel was also paid</text>
  <text start="436" dur="4.68">by the FBI in addition to being paid by</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="5.64">fusion GPS and don&amp;#39;t forget the icing on</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="5.99">the cake what journalists was Fuzion GPS</text>
  <text start="443.77" dur="2.9">paying at the time</text>
