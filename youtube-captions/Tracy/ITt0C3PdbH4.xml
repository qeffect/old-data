  <text start="13.889" dur="3.211">intersections here and it needs</text>
  <text start="15.24" dur="4.77">follow-up but I wanted to get it out</text>
  <text start="17.1" dur="6.599">there yesterday I posted this tweet the</text>
  <text start="20.01" dur="6.33">DNC has chosen to sue a number of people</text>
  <text start="23.699" dur="4.351">yet again about the whole suppose it</text>
  <text start="26.34" dur="3.96">hack and one of the most interesting</text>
  <text start="28.05" dur="5.37">things that struck me is that this</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="5.279">process server for the for the dancy got</text>
  <text start="33.42" dur="5.58">approval by the judge to be able to</text>
  <text start="35.579" dur="5.581">serve these papers on Twitter they serve</text>
  <text start="39" dur="4.98">them electronically via Twitter and my</text>
  <text start="41.16" dur="4.079">question was this sets an interesting</text>
  <text start="43.98" dur="2.91">standard when it comes to the platform</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="4.441">as a whole does this make Twitter a</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="4.41">public square in other words is Twitter</text>
  <text start="49.68" dur="2.94">now like a street in New York City where</text>
  <text start="51.3" dur="3.09">you can just walk up to somebody and</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="4.41">hand them paperwork to serve them</text>
  <text start="54.39" dur="4.259">what happens if WikiLeaks can&amp;#39;t see this</text>

  <text start="61.1" dur="5.29">you there&amp;#39;s a number of things a myriad</text>

  <text start="66.39" dur="4.65">Twitter as a platform and and and this</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="4.171">sets precedent in so many different ways</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="3.78">like if you&amp;#39;re gonna have the ability to</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="3.81">stop someone from using your platform</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="5.549">disable their account limit their</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="4.08">account all kinds of other things and a</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="3.601">court of law</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="6.9">is allowing a process server to serve</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="6.75">court documents via Twitter that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="4.95">really interesting line to go down and</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="4.439">now yes they did have to file a copy by</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="4.58">mail as well but there&amp;#39;s an order here</text>

  <text start="144.48" dur="4.44">interesting tidbits in here and it does</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="4.58">tie into the past just a tad</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="7.37">let&amp;#39;s take a look at who they&amp;#39;re suing</text>

  <text start="274.14" dur="5.22">indictments and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="4.08">that that basically says like the Trump</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="3.93">campaign was conspiring with WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="5.07">to and the Russian government to trash</text>
  <text start="283.29" dur="4.86">the DNC and they caused us harm and we</text>

  <text start="288.15" dur="4.02">everything that was released is true</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="4.65">never mind the fact that the DNC didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.17" dur="4.86">help themselves because they&amp;#39;re scheming</text>
  <text start="294.39" dur="4.97">lying jerks never mind all that it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="305.37" dur="5.7">ba-ba-ba-ba-ba cover-ups all kinds of</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="6.36">stuff what it did for me though was it</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="7.11">reminded me of this video here when I</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="7.32">had my intro I covered the motion to</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="11.64">dismiss in this lawsuit back in October</text>
  <text start="321.54" dur="10.44">of 2017 on October 26th actually look I</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="4.61">had a patreon back then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.98" dur="2.45">interesting</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="6.13">this guy Roy Cockrum and a couple other</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="4.89">people were donors to the DNC and one of</text>
  <text start="342.48" dur="3.78">them worked for the dancing and they</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="4.17">claimed that because WikiLeaks published</text>
  <text start="346.26" dur="4.11">the information that they published and</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="5.07">Donald Trump worked with WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="4.8">somehow that Donald Trump&amp;#39;s campaign was</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="2.85">responsible for emotional grief because</text>
  <text start="355.17" dur="3.09">one of them had to come out of the</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="4.25">closet to his family and financial</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="5.52">losses and all kinds of other things</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="5.17">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very very it&amp;#39;s a very it was</text>
  <text start="363.78" dur="4.04">a very frivolous lawsuit that made a lot</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="8.4">of assertions and Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="8.65">campaign defended Donald Trump in this</text>
  <text start="373.95" dur="5.88">motion to dismiss by making the case</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="5.01">that WikiLeaks is is is a publisher as a</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="3.72">press as a press organization and</text>
  <text start="381.48" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re covered by the Free Press</text>
  <text start="383.55" dur="5.82">doctrine like they can actually go ahead</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="5.55">and publish this stuff without fear of</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="5.85">reprisal and why they basically made a</text>
  <text start="391.89" dur="5.37">really good case for WikiLeaks as part</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="4.44">of their answer to dismiss this lawsuit</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="3.36">and I covered it in this video it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.66" dur="2.61">about</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="3.24">eleven minutes long I don&amp;#39;t think I went</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="6.05">into great detail but I&amp;#39;m look I think</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="4.46">I&amp;#39;m going to now not today but soon</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="3.91">Trump is playing a game of five D chess</text>
  <text start="410.639" dur="3.391">and he&amp;#39;s winning remember all the things</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="3.45">that were different back then we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="414.03" dur="4.92">learned a lot since but this video was</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="5.34">pretty good so when I started I</text>
  <text start="418.95" dur="3.99">remembered that when I saw this DMC suit</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="3.24">come out and I looked back into pacer to</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="8.61">find this case and see what it was</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="10.02">happening with it and I found that it</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="6.06">was dismissed the lawsuit was dismissed</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="4.86">and I started reading this very briefly</text>
  <text start="437.61" dur="3.54">skimming over why it&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="4.52">jurisdictional reasons in this dismissal</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="5.43">in the opinion but there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="443.72" dur="4.96">precedent being set in here for folks to</text>
  <text start="446.58" dur="4.14">use moving forward of why they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="448.68" dur="3.9">responsible for these things in other</text>
  <text start="450.72" dur="3.81">words the plaintiffs couldn&amp;#39;t prove that</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="3.54">Roger stone was responsible for</text>
  <text start="454.53" dur="3.63">WikiLeaks taking the action of</text>
  <text start="456.12" dur="3.48">publishing the plaintiffs that the</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="3.96">plaintiffs could improve that Donald</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="5.46">Trump&amp;#39;s campaign was behind telling the</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="5.4">conspirators to so supposedly hack the</text>
  <text start="465.06" dur="4.29">servers the location jury the</text>
  <text start="467.52" dur="4.35">jurisdiction in terms of venue was</text>
  <text start="469.35" dur="4.95">incorrect all kinds of really amazing</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="5.19">stuff that makes me want to go back</text>
  <text start="474.3" dur="4.679">through this lawsuit and now this answer</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="4.38">and and pull out the points in this</text>
  <text start="478.979" dur="6.631">answer that that people facing this</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="6.24">right now can use this is a DC lawsuit</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="5.79">this would be great for counter points</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="6.87">against conspiracies on the left</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="6.36">look this court found a B and C so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="5.489">gonna definitely take take the time to</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="4.05">read through in detail this 45 page</text>
  <text start="500.039" dur="5.401">opinion from the court dismissing the</text>
  <text start="501.81" dur="6.12">lawsuit remember the motion to dismiss</text>
  <text start="505.44" dur="6.39">made the case that WikiLeaks is free to</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="6.09">publish interesting interesting dynamic</text>
  <text start="511.83" dur="7.37">they&amp;#39;re given what we see going on with</text>
  <text start="514.02" dur="7.98">WikiLeaks today of course right after</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="5.2">that dismissal not even a few days later</text>
  <text start="522" dur="5.25">these folks refiled their lawsuit in</text>
  <text start="524.4" dur="6">Virginia and I have yet to read through</text>
  <text start="527.25" dur="5.1">this complaint but I&amp;#39;ve saved it and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="4.05">going to read through it it&amp;#39;s about 64</text>
