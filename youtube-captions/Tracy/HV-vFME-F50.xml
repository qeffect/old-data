  <text start="0.03" dur="7.349">good afternoon it is Tuesday June 12</text>
  <text start="2.959" dur="7.18">2018 at 2:47 p.m. Eastern Time</text>
  <text start="7.379" dur="4.88">I wanted to start off this video firstly</text>
  <text start="10.139" dur="4.771">by talking about my video from yesterday</text>
  <text start="12.259" dur="5.651">one of the things that I absolutely love</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="5.22">is the constructive feedback from those</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="5.94">of you in the comment section who are</text>
  <text start="20.13" dur="7.8">very kind in praising me which always</text>
  <text start="23.85" dur="7.95">makes me kind of shy but um and also</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="6.18">very good at gently suggesting ways that</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="4.349">I can improve for you and I love that</text>
  <text start="34.11" dur="6.06">because I am learning and growing and</text>
  <text start="36.149" dur="7.111">you know doing things based off of you</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="4.74">yeah I&amp;#39;m kind of I know that I have</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="7.319">places where I need to improve and one</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="7.469">of them is is the sort of the</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="6.23">explanation of what I&amp;#39;m trying to tell</text>
  <text start="52.379" dur="8.311">you guys I get I&amp;#39;m very concerned with</text>
  <text start="56.809" dur="7.511">sourced information and and details and</text>
  <text start="60.69" dur="6.24">proven facts I feel like it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="4.95">that is severely lacking nowadays and</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="4.799">there&amp;#39;s too much trust me and not enough</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="4.32">here look for yourself and so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="4.111">obsessed with that almost to my own</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="4.8">detriment at times and and I&amp;#39;m fine</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="4.5">admitting that because I feel like I</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="4.26">need to change some things about how I</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="3.779">do my reporting there were some of you</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="3.87">in the comments who thought that I was</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="4.051">somehow in my report yesterday giving</text>
  <text start="86.52" dur="4.919">credence to the Russia hacked the</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="4.98">election theory and and at first I was</text>
  <text start="91.439" dur="3.841">offended by it and then I said wait a</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="3.66">second you know let me think about this</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="4.53">for a second and I can understand why</text>
  <text start="96.81" dur="6.66">that may have come across in addition I</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="5.79">can also sympathise with those of you</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="3.899">who who thought that I should maybe or</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="6.12">think that I should maybe summarize what</text>
  <text start="107.369" dur="6.271">what the story is first and then present</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="3.45">the facts to you after I summarize and</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="3.45">so that you know at least what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="3.21">listening for completely understandable</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="4.05">and I&amp;#39;m going to be making those changes</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="5.089">as we move on and I really appreciate it</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="4.47">because I&amp;#39;m here for you and if I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="123.469" dur="3.701">successfully conveying information to</text>
  <text start="125.61" dur="3.09">you in a way that makes you understand</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="4.44">what the point of the information is</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s kind of silly there are some times</text>
  <text start="131.61" dur="2.02">where the information I&amp;#39;m providing I</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="2.26">don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="4.95">even necessarily know what it means yet</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="4.71">but my instinct tells me I need to get</text>
  <text start="138.58" dur="4.17">this out there so at least these facts</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="4.53">are out there and then as the the</text>
  <text start="142.75" dur="3.87">details are like sort of peppered in as</text>
  <text start="144.64" dur="4.5">we move to the future we&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="4.77">go backwards and say okay on June 11th</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="3.9">we talked about gusoff er being in the</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="4.23">states at the same time as all this was</text>
  <text start="153.04" dur="4.2">going down with Papadopoulos now that we</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="5.33">have this piece of information that was</text>
  <text start="157.24" dur="6.09">released today it gives more sort of</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="5.71">more of an understanding of what was</text>
  <text start="163.33" dur="5.58">happening and why what I put out</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="4.2">yesterday regards to gusoff er I know is</text>
  <text start="168.91" dur="4.83">very important and I was just having a</text>
  <text start="170.86" dur="4.89">very hard time solidifying why and I</text>
  <text start="173.74" dur="3.87">really don&amp;#39;t like to throw theories out</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="4.74">there I don&amp;#39;t like to speculate too much</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="5.19">because you know especially in this case</text>
  <text start="180.49" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m not really sure I really am not sure</text>
  <text start="182.8" dur="3.45">but I know that it&amp;#39;s not a coincidence</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="3.81">that he was here that he was extradited</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="3.63">that he was sent back quickly that Peter</text>
  <text start="188.35" dur="3.99">struck and Lisa Paige had no idea what</text>
  <text start="189.88" dur="4.26">was going on that they didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="192.34" dur="4.41">the significance of him being in town</text>
  <text start="194.14" dur="4.32">given the tone of their text messages to</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="3.48">one another the fact that struck was</text>
  <text start="198.46" dur="4.2">running the Clinton email investigation</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="3.33">and didn&amp;#39;t understand that gusoff r1 was</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="3.45">in the States</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="8.27">being extradited by the FBI to interview</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="8.52">about the hack of of Blumenthal at all</text>
  <text start="211.83" dur="4.72">was telling to me and I didn&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="214.63" dur="4.38">know why I still don&amp;#39;t know why and and</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="4.62">I just I feel irresponsible you know</text>
  <text start="219.01" dur="3.66">saying well this is because maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="4.289">me I gave you some speculation at the</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="3.87">end but I&amp;#39;m like it just it doesn&amp;#39;t sit</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="8.041">right with me it makes me uncomfortable</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="8.37">to do people people you know people not</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="4.01">to make myself sound important but</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="5.43">people depend on on what I say to be</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="5.14">fact-based and very detailed and very</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="4.71">straightforward and so when I speculate</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="4.52">too too much it kind of it may just I</text>
  <text start="245.05" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t like to do it it&amp;#39;s just something</text>
  <text start="247.17" dur="4.48">see I&amp;#39;m explaining too much anyway all</text>
  <text start="249.67" dur="4.19">I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that I really</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="4.08">appreciate your comments and your kind</text>
  <text start="253.86" dur="3.73">compliments first of all and your</text>
  <text start="255.73" dur="3.24">constructive criticisms very much</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="3.66">because they really helped me to get</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="4.53">better and to do a better job for you</text>
  <text start="261.25" dur="6.24">which ultimately is the goal to do a</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="6.509">better job for you I will share a</text>
  <text start="267.49" dur="6.63">full of little speculative speculative</text>
  <text start="270.009" dur="5.491">kind of like hypotheses that I had when</text>
  <text start="274.12" dur="3.449">someone else that I very much respect</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="3.389">asked me these same questions that a lot</text>
  <text start="277.569" dur="3.44">of you guys were asking me yesterday in</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="5.34">the comments section</text>
  <text start="281.009" dur="5.801">somebody said am I suggesting meaning me</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="4.111">that gusoff er was muzzled by the FBI</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="3.479">and that Papadopoulos may have had a</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="4.59">role in creating gusoff or - who</text>
  <text start="290.289" dur="4.47">supported the DMC hack narrative know</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="3.75">that that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m saying not</text>
  <text start="294.759" dur="4.861">quite at all actually on the first part</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="5.31">it seems likely that it seems like</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s a chance that gusoff er one was</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="4.35">muzzled while he was in there here in</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="5.549">the country I think it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="5.46">that gusoff or two pops up while gusoff</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="6.571">or one is here in the states a couple</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="6.39">things that I thought could it be</text>
  <text start="315.55" dur="6.39">possible that they probed gusoff or one</text>
  <text start="318.19" dur="5.31">to be used as a you know to give tips so</text>
  <text start="321.94" dur="3.93">that they could use him as a cutout for</text>
  <text start="323.5" dur="4.289">gusoff or two and they have like more</text>
  <text start="325.87" dur="4.049">idea about how he talks more idea about</text>
  <text start="327.789" dur="4.41">what he did how how he did what he did</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="3.93">etc and then they just fashioned a</text>
  <text start="332.199" dur="4.761">cookie cutter gusoff or two out of the</text>
  <text start="333.849" dur="5.79">stuff that gusoff or one told them maybe</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="4.03">I think it&amp;#39;s coincidence very big</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="2.671">coincidence that they&amp;#39;re both here you</text>
  <text start="340.99" dur="3.47">know that that gusoff er one is here and</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="5.37">then goes over to pops up out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="6.13">I also think that it&amp;#39;s possible that</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="5.22">because of the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="4.02">leaked about the fact that gusoff er one</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="6.96">was here remember he leaked to Judge</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="7.41">Napolitano he he leaked - he leaked -</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="5.19">was a couple different news outlets that</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="4.769">di the intelligence community leaked to</text>
  <text start="365.05" dur="4.5">them that that&amp;#39;s how napalitano knew</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="6.841">this stuff about about Pagliano about</text>
  <text start="369.55" dur="6.69">gusoff er etc i think i think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.63" dur="4.349">possible that they realized that because</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="3.78">of those leaks they were gonna have to</text>
  <text start="377.979" dur="5.761">back fashioned some kind of an excuse</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="5.489">for it and so they you know you can look</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="4.799">at it from two angles is is this entire</text>
  <text start="385.509" dur="5.701">thing happening because they need to</text>
  <text start="388.539" dur="5.16">cover up the your they need to kind of</text>
  <text start="391.21" dur="4.65">cover up the fact that information was</text>
  <text start="393.699" dur="4.71">leaked from the DNC and from John</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="5.55">Podesta to WikiLeaks and DC leaks in</text>
  <text start="398.409" dur="5.251">order to cause this earth-shattering</text>
  <text start="401.41" dur="5.13">revelation that from burning supporters</text>
  <text start="403.66" dur="5.1">and others that the Clinton machine the</text>
  <text start="406.54" dur="3.75">DNC it&amp;#39;s all a big game and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="3.27">corrupt and it&amp;#39;s rigged in the meetings</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="3.51">in their pockets so they need to back</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="5.28">fashion something to get around that and</text>
  <text start="413.8" dur="5.55">so I&amp;#39;m the email server itself and cover</text>
  <text start="417.31" dur="3.57">it up and so because they needed to do</text>
  <text start="419.35" dur="3.06">that they came up with this</text>
  <text start="420.88" dur="3.48">counterintelligence investigation</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="3.69">against Trump that could be a</text>
  <text start="424.36" dur="3.36">possibility there are so many different</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="4.68">things that could be actually you know</text>
  <text start="427.72" dur="4.83">could be a reason here I also said to</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="4.23">this person there&amp;#39;s a back-and-forth</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="4.71">going on behind the scenes about whether</text>
  <text start="435.01" dur="5.34">or not it was black hats or white hats</text>
  <text start="437.26" dur="6.27">who were with gusoff er I have that</text>
  <text start="440.35" dur="4.71">question in my head anyway like who was</text>
  <text start="443.53" dur="3.36">with him if struck doesn&amp;#39;t realize what</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="3.41">the importance of gusoff or one is and</text>
  <text start="446.89" dur="4.65">doesn&amp;#39;t talk to Paige about it in a more</text>
  <text start="448.47" dur="4.9">significant way who&amp;#39;s talking to gusoff</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="3.78">or one the FBI agents that are doing</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="3.54">this investigation the the resources</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="3.39">involved in going out there to get him</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="4.52">and bring him back here all of that</text>
  <text start="458.71" dur="5.64">stuff is just in the air right now so</text>
  <text start="461.43" dur="5.56">that was kind of an open-ended thought</text>
  <text start="464.35" dur="4.56">stream from my head and the more I sit</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="3.6">down and focus on it the more I kind of</text>
  <text start="468.91" dur="3.87">round that out but we just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="4.41">enough information however I felt the</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="4.11">facts of that and the timeline of it</text>
  <text start="475" dur="6.48">were important to get out there on paper</text>
  <text start="476.89" dur="7.41">given that on Thursday we&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="5.22">first IG report and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="4.23">debate about this first IG report is it</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="3.57">going to be nothing is it gonna be a</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="4.86">just blame everything I&amp;#39;ll call me and</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="4.71">walk away what&amp;#39;s the deal with it and a</text>
  <text start="493.39" dur="3.48">lot of the frustration that people have</text>
  <text start="494.98" dur="4.1">felt up until now is because if you</text>
  <text start="496.87" dur="4.98">listen to some of the more well-known</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="5.17">pundits on our side of the aisle meaning</text>
  <text start="501.85" dur="6.51">our side truth side conservative side</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="7.919">Pro Trump side not establishment swamp</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="6.989">rat side you don&amp;#39;t hear anything about</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="5.641">Hoover who is the prosecutor working</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="4.5">with Michael Horowitz Sean Hannity is</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="3.75">ignored everybody seems to ignore this</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="3.451">guy and it&amp;#39;s been frustrating because</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="3.18">because they&amp;#39;re ignoring it the special</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="3.75">counsel the second special counsel</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="4.23">argument is put out there the you know</text>

  <text start="530.53" dur="3.74">be charged nothing&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="532.12" dur="3.95">that whole argument is predicated</text>
  <text start="534.27" dur="3.96">the fact that there&amp;#39;s no criminal</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="3.39">investigation going on and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="2.82">telling you and I&amp;#39;ve been telling you</text>

  <text start="541.95" dur="3.9">sessions appointed one he&amp;#39;s even better</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="3.21">than a special prosecutor in a lot of</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="3.96">ways because he&amp;#39;s got 400 people working</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="4.67">with him on this case you know the the</text>
  <text start="549.81" dur="5.16">power of that he&amp;#39;s outside of the swamp</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="4.93">there is a grand jury impaneled we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="573.99" dur="5.46">play well there to answer our question</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="4.41">so what happens now in terms of the</text>
  <text start="579.45" dur="4.32">referrals of criminal charges the last</text>
  <text start="581.61" dur="4.35">IG report from Michael Horowitz</text>
  <text start="583.77" dur="4.95">recommended criminal charges against</text>
  <text start="585.96" dur="5.7">Andrew McCabe the number two deputy</text>
  <text start="588.72" dur="5.01">director at the FBI this weekend</text>
  <text start="591.66" dur="4.41">Jim Comey has been taunting the</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="4.23">President on Twitter basically taking</text>
  <text start="596.07" dur="3.99">shots at him over the relationship</text>
  <text start="597.96" dur="5.15">between the US and Canada and we are</text>
  <text start="600.06" dur="5.46">expecting that there could be some real</text>
  <text start="603.11" dur="2.83">significant issues brought up about Jim</text>
  <text start="605.52" dur="3.12">Comey</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="4.35">in this upcoming IG report so what are</text>
  <text start="608.64" dur="4.41">your thoughts on that in terms of what</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="5.28">happens next well two things first of</text>
  <text start="613.05" dur="5.01">all the Attorney General Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="615.57" dur="5.58">did appoint United States Attorney Huber</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="4.74">from Utah to look into the matter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.15" dur="2.13">also being looked into by the inspector</text>
  <text start="622.8" dur="4.17">general</text>
  <text start="623.28" dur="7.23">he does have prosecutorial authority and</text>
  <text start="626.97" dur="4.62">he can make referrals for the inspector</text>
  <text start="630.51" dur="3.66">general can make referrals for</text>
  <text start="631.59" dur="5.16">prosecution so if there is evidence of</text>
  <text start="634.17" dur="4.77">criminal wrongdoing and I believe we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="636.75" dur="4.62">seen some already as you just referenced</text>
  <text start="638.94" dur="4.98">the Inspector General&amp;#39;s reference with</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="4.44">regard to Andrew McCabe we will see that</text>
  <text start="643.92" dur="3.75">happen but the question is who will</text>
  <text start="645.81" dur="4.5">actually do that prosecuting will it be</text>
  <text start="647.67" dur="4.65">mr. Hubert or do we need somebody who is</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="2.79">completely independent of the Department</text>
  <text start="652.32" dur="3.27">of Justice</text>
  <text start="653.1" dur="4.23">mr. Huber got the matter outside of what</text>
  <text start="655.59" dur="4.89">we call main justice outside of</text>
  <text start="657.33" dur="5.07">Washington DC but I think and many</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="3.81">others in the Congress continue to think</text>
  <text start="662.4" dur="3.87">that we need to have an independent</text>
  <text start="664.29" dur="4.53">special counsel</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="5.55">apart from the work that mr. Muller is</text>
  <text start="668.82" dur="4.74">doing to handle these potential criminal</text>
  <text start="671.82" dur="5.06">referrals and to look into this matter</text>
  <text start="673.56" dur="5.73">for the possibility of finding further</text>
  <text start="676.88" dur="4.21">matters beyond what the Inspector</text>
  <text start="679.29" dur="4.92">General does I will talk more about this</text>
  <text start="681.09" dur="4.89">once that IG report here so yeah he</text>
  <text start="684.21" dur="2.97">played the line with yeah I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="685.98" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;ll be enough but we don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="687.18" dur="3.48">yet we just don&amp;#39;t know yet so I think</text>
  <text start="689.55" dur="3.36">that they&amp;#39;re all playing it safe with</text>
  <text start="690.66" dur="3.75">that right now you know we need a second</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="2.97">special counsel just to look into this</text>
  <text start="694.41" dur="4.23">and what a nightmare that would be at</text>
  <text start="695.88" dur="4.77">this point if everything else fails then</text>
  <text start="698.64" dur="3.81">yeah I agree let&amp;#39;s get someone else in</text>
  <text start="700.65" dur="3.42">there let&amp;#39;s get a good person appointed</text>
  <text start="702.45" dur="4.2">to actually do the right thing here but</text>
  <text start="704.07" dur="4.41">as of right now I really want to see a</text>
  <text start="706.65" dur="3.18">lots gonna happen in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="708.48" dur="4.77">days we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="709.83" dur="5.22">get a lot there&amp;#39;s been some debate back</text>
  <text start="713.25" dur="4.56">and forth what&amp;#39;s gonna happen first is</text>
  <text start="715.05" dur="4.83">there going to be indictments first and</text>
  <text start="717.81" dur="4.02">then the ID reports released or are they</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="4.11">gonna do indictments after I think at</text>
  <text start="721.83" dur="4.47">this point it&amp;#39;s clear that that at least</text>
  <text start="723.99" dur="4.5">from good lads perspective he sees</text>
  <text start="726.3" dur="4.53">criminality he&amp;#39;s mentioning it as though</text>
  <text start="728.49" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s a given who&amp;#39;s gonna be the one to</text>
  <text start="730.83" dur="4.83">take the fall or one&amp;#39;s to take the fall</text>
  <text start="733.14" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;ve been confident in my gut this</text>
  <text start="735.66" dur="6.72">entire time there will be people going</text>
  <text start="737.49" dur="7.8">down for this for sure and we this is</text>
  <text start="742.38" dur="4.44">just the beginning of the reports that</text>
  <text start="745.29" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ll be getting out of this inspector</text>
  <text start="746.82" dur="5.94">general this is the mid-year exam</text>
  <text start="750.15" dur="3.84">although I was led to believe from some</text>
  <text start="752.76" dur="3.63">of the letters that went back and forth</text>
  <text start="753.99" dur="5.58">between Grassley and Rae and and McCabe</text>
  <text start="756.39" dur="5.4">etc that maybe there&amp;#39;s a little more in</text>
  <text start="759.57" dur="4.47">here than just the email investigation</text>
  <text start="761.79" dur="4.71">because remember he can investigate</text>
  <text start="764.04" dur="6.24">things that come up along his way and he</text>
  <text start="766.5" dur="6.54">can refer to the special prosecutor US</text>
  <text start="770.28" dur="4.26">Attorney I mean and say I need you you</text>
  <text start="773.04" dur="3.27">know here&amp;#39;s a tip that I have in my</text>
  <text start="774.54" dur="3.69">investigation you take this now and</text>
  <text start="776.31" dur="4.5">investigated and he you know who burr</text>
  <text start="778.23" dur="4.53">can bring in people that have left the</text>
  <text start="780.81" dur="5.73">government to testify before a grand</text>
  <text start="782.76" dur="5.67">jury to question etc there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="786.54" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s been going on behind the scenes I</text>
  <text start="788.43" dur="3.96">think it&amp;#39;s all going to start to be</text>
  <text start="789.87" dur="4.14">exposed I think we&amp;#39;re in for a hell of a</text>
  <text start="792.39" dur="3.69">couple weeks I know that there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="794.01" dur="3.96">of people very frustrated with the pace</text>
  <text start="796.08" dur="3.27">of things that have resigned themselves</text>
  <text start="797.97" dur="3.57">to you know</text>
  <text start="799.35" dur="5.04">nothing&amp;#39;s gonna happen I am I am of the</text>
  <text start="801.54" dur="5.16">opposite mindset and as always there is</text>
  <text start="804.39" dur="3.99">the chance that I could be wrong and I</text>
  <text start="806.7" dur="3.54">never stand up here and proclaim that</text>
  <text start="808.38" dur="2.49">I&amp;#39;m right about everything that&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="810.24" dur="4.02">damn sure</text>
  <text start="810.87" dur="4.98">but I will tell you that given the</text>
  <text start="814.26" dur="4.41">amount of time I spend doing the stuff</text>
  <text start="815.85" dur="5.46">and what I know and I know I know I I</text>
  <text start="818.67" dur="4.35">feel that we will definitely see some</text>
  <text start="821.31" dur="4.32">results out of this first</text>
