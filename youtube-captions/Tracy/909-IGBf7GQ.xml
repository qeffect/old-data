  <text start="13.49" dur="4.51">McCabe Oh IG report I had promised you</text>
  <text start="16.5" dur="4.92">guys that I was gonna circle back around</text>
  <text start="18" dur="5.25">and take care of the rebuttals and I</text>
  <text start="21.42" dur="6">think that that&amp;#39;s really important to do</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="6.24">now only because I want to show you what</text>
  <text start="27.42" dur="3.84">happens with the OIG report why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="29.49" dur="6.17">taking so long why the draft is taking</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="8.61">so long etc basically what happens is</text>
  <text start="35.66" dur="7.03">the Office of Inspector General writes</text>
  <text start="39.87" dur="4.529">the IG report they have to take all the</text>
  <text start="42.69" dur="3.209">details they have to source them they</text>
  <text start="44.399" dur="3.241">have to footnote them they have to make</text>
  <text start="45.899" dur="5.131">sure that they&amp;#39;re good and you know</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="5.939">correct and well sourced they write the</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="3.99">report they sent it in draft form to the</text>
  <text start="53.579" dur="2.73">powers that be that are gonna look it</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="4.469">over including the people mentioned</text>
  <text start="56.309" dur="4.89">within so in terms of the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="4.201">investigation report which is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="6.001">waiting for it&amp;#39;s been rumored now that</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s approximately 500 pages long and so</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="3.989">the people involved in that have to go</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="5.16">through that report and then they have</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="5.281">to submit their rebuttals about what</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="3.99">they found what what they can test in</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="5.46">there their own arguments usually with</text>
  <text start="78.33" dur="7.679">counsel this report was 35 pages long</text>
  <text start="81.93" dur="6.479">and it was masterfully done masterfully</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="4.531">well done I you know I detailed this I</text>
  <text start="88.409" dur="4.621">found the whole Loretta Lynch thing in</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="5.219">here it was detailed it was the</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="4.53">arguments were logical and strong and of</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="4.411">course McCabe was referred for criminal</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="6.839">prosecution off of this report for this</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="5.879">one leak to McKay to Barrett from the</text>
  <text start="104.399" dur="3.54">Wall Street Journal and I want to say</text>
  <text start="106.049" dur="5.07">again that this Oh a G report that came</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="6.481">out on McCabe was not a it was it was a</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="4.621">spinoff of what they were actually the</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="3.36">big things that they&amp;#39;re investigating</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="4.229">right now it was not part of the</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="4.199">original scope they were brought in</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="4.11">after the fact because the internal</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="4.68">investigative team within the FBI that</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="4.891">was looking into these leaks found when</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="4.561">Lisa Paige said will McCabe ordered me</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="5.2">to week that stuff to Barrett of the</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="5.11">Wall Street Journal they realized Oh</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="3.649">you know mccabe confirmed it it was him</text>
  <text start="136.33" dur="4.59">they can&amp;#39;t continue this investigation</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="5.291">they hand it over to the inspector</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="4.17">general at that point it just so</text>
  <text start="143.11" dur="4.02">happened that at the time the Inspector</text>
  <text start="145.09" dur="3.57">General was speaking to McCabe about the</text>
  <text start="147.13" dur="6">matters that they&amp;#39;re investigating under</text>
  <text start="148.66" dur="7.47">that January order on what they&amp;#39;re to be</text>
  <text start="153.13" dur="5.76">looking at in terms of FISA abuse and</text>
  <text start="156.13" dur="6.27">the Clinton email investigation and you</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="6.68">know the handling of that stuff so what</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="5.97">I want to do actually before we go on I</text>
  <text start="165.57" dur="5.22">want to show you what he&amp;#39;s investigating</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="4.68">this came out in January 12 2017</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="3.79">Department of Justice Inspector General</text>
  <text start="173.05" dur="2.85">Michael Horowitz announced today that in</text>

  <text start="201.79" dur="4.77">October 28th and November 6th of 2016</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="3.36">and that certain underlying</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="4.92">investigative decisions were based on</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="5.46">improper considerations allegations that</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="3.96">the FBI deputy director McCabe should</text>
  <text start="213.85" dur="2.99">have been recused from participating in</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="3.18">certain investigative matters</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="2.92">allegations that the Department&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="241" dur="5.01">FOIA documents on October 30th and</text>
  <text start="243.7" dur="3.84">November 1st and the use of a twitter</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="5.88">account to publicize the same were</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="6.09">influenced by improper considerations in</text>
  <text start="251.89" dur="4.23">addition we can add FISA abuse to this</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="4.44">so that was what he was tasked with in</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="5.789">January of last year so think we&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="7.2">18 months in now about anyway that being</text>
  <text start="261.909" dur="5.761">said that this o IG report about McCabe</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="6.12">was not involved in the</text>
  <text start="267.67" dur="5.58">original scope as outlined but they also</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="5.16">mention any other matters that may arise</text>
  <text start="273.25" dur="6.66">and that&amp;#39;s their job in a video on my</text>
  <text start="276.55" dur="6.18">channel I did I did a pretty good</text>
  <text start="279.91" dur="4.23">explanation of why it is that Horowitz</text>
  <text start="282.73" dur="3.39">has an axe to grind with the past</text>
  <text start="284.14" dur="3.66">administration and I&amp;#39;ll link it in the</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="3.45">description box below so you guys can</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="2.52">take a look at it and kind of see where</text>
  <text start="289.57" dur="3.56">I&amp;#39;m coming from</text>
  <text start="290.32" dur="6.87">if this report about McCabe is any</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="5.74">indication this there is no favoritism</text>
  <text start="297.19" dur="3">being played here and we went through</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="5.94">this report but what I want to show you</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="6.75">is the rebuttals only because they are</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="6.21">so important and that&amp;#39;s likely why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.94" dur="6.15">taking so much longer for the IG to</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="3.81">release this for or for the people to be</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="3.63">done with the report the draft</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="3.54">considerations to be put back into it</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="4.31">and then it should be released for</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="2.66">public consumption</text>
  <text start="322.65" dur="8.01">so let&amp;#39;s find one shall we so on page 22</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="6.22">starts the OIG s analysis and why and so</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="3.87">he goes through basically and says we</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="5.25">concluded that McCabe lacked candor and</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="5.67">then he&amp;#39;ll go in and say because XYZ and</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="5.43">factual information why then can&amp;#39;t comb</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="5.55">McCabe&amp;#39;s attorney responds and they put</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="6.78">a footnote in they put a footnote in to</text>
  <text start="350.62" dur="7.2">explain here this statement what the</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="5.06">attorney is alleging in the footnote</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="4.02">which will read is that Comey McCabe</text>
  <text start="359.64" dur="3.97">their perspectives on events are</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="3.45">different and why is the IG taking</text>
  <text start="363.61" dur="2.85">commis word over McCabe&amp;#39;s word was</text>
  <text start="365.29" dur="3.629">basically the brunt of it but what he</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="4.709">says here is this in comments submitted</text>
  <text start="368.919" dur="3.991">by his counsel in response to a draft of</text>
  <text start="371.169" dur="4.321">this report like we talked about earlier</text>
  <text start="372.91" dur="4.71">McCabe&amp;#39;s stated quote there is no</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="4.65">indication that any of director Comey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.62" dur="5.19">comments were referring to the pa da G</text>
  <text start="380.14" dur="4.83">call to the contrary says Horowitz as</text>
  <text start="382.81" dur="3.69">detailed in this report and made clear</text>
  <text start="384.97" dur="4.08">in the draft that was made available for</text>
  <text start="386.5" dur="4.83">mccabe and his counsels review the OIG</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="4.11">questioned Comey with specific reference</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="3.66">to the portion of the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="393.16" dur="6.33">Journal article that related to McCabe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="5.88">call on August 12th with PA da G there</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="3.54">is no ambiguity</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="4.079">Comey told us that at the time he was</text>
  <text start="403.03" dur="3.78">very concerned about the disclosure for</text>
  <text start="404.949" dur="4.44">a number of reasons including the impact</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="5.37">of this disclosure on FBI DOJ relations</text>
  <text start="409.389" dur="4.771">and Comey told us that mccabe led him to</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="3.66">believe that mccabe had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="414.16" dur="3.569">with the disclosure most likely by</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="3.78">stating that mccabe didn&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="417.729" dur="3.871">the disclosure came from and definitely</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="4.41">did not state to call me that he McCabe</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="4.71">authorized the disclosure so what the</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="3.75">disclosure is is that McCabe pretended</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="3.03">that he had no idea where the sleep came</text>
  <text start="427.78" dur="2.94">from when he talked to Comey and covered</text>
  <text start="429.34" dur="3.26">it up because McCabe was trying to make</text>
  <text start="430.72" dur="4.56">himself look better</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="8.5">well Comey said that&amp;#39;s not what he said</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="8.609">to me and his attorneys McCabe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.1" dur="5.7">attorneys allege that Comey never spoke</text>
  <text start="443.889" dur="4.261">with them with the OIG about the pa da G</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="3.03">call and McCabe&amp;#39;s attorneys are</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="3.989">blatantly you know cooked incorrect</text>
  <text start="449.83" dur="3.839">because it&amp;#39;s detailed in the report so</text>
  <text start="452.139" dur="4.65">that was a gentle one let&amp;#39;s find a</text>
  <text start="453.669" dur="5.791">little more let&amp;#39;s find a little bit more</text>
  <text start="456.789" dur="5.91">of a here we go here&amp;#39;s a good one</text>
  <text start="459.46" dur="6.8">it&amp;#39;s footnote 10 so it&amp;#39;s based off of</text>
  <text start="462.699" dur="6.541">this paragraph here and the paragraph is</text>
  <text start="466.26" dur="4.93">finally commis testimony that mccabe did</text>
  <text start="469.24" dur="3.06">not tell him that mccabe had authorized</text>
  <text start="471.19" dur="3.26">the disclosure to the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="5.22">Journal is entirely consistent with</text>
  <text start="474.45" dur="5.08">McCabe statement to the eye NSD which is</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="5.22">the internal FBI investigative body on</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="4.53">May 9th that he had quote no idea where</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="5.67">the disclosure came from</text>
  <text start="484.06" dur="7.2">so McCabe testified to the or spoke to I</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="5.28">think it was under oath - no it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="491.26" dur="4.11">under oath he spoke to the eye NSD which</text>
  <text start="493.69" dur="3.36">is the internal investigative unit</text>
  <text start="495.37" dur="3.87">within the FBI that was investigating</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="5.28">the leaks as a whole and this leaked and</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="4.53">he told them I have no idea where this</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="4.07">leak came from trying to cover his ass</text>
  <text start="503.77" dur="5.67">he also said the same thing to call me</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="5.86">McCabe&amp;#39;s attorney is arguing that commis</text>
  <text start="509.44" dur="5.67">lying the OIG in this footnote is coming</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="4.98">back and saying actually we know that</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s probably not true that he&amp;#39;s lying</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="5.609">call me because McCabe said the same</text>
  <text start="519.13" dur="6.329">thing to other parties in the i ns D so</text>
  <text start="522.849" dur="5.701">for Comey to be lying it wouldn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="525.459" dur="4.831">sense that McCabe would also tell the</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="4.17">people in the I n SD the same thing that</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="4.47">Comey is alleging he told Comey</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="4.169">so let&amp;#39;s read it again with that in mind</text>
  <text start="534.76" dur="4.92">an elaborate letter submitted walksler</text>
  <text start="536.889" dur="4.681">we were here finally commis to commis</text>

  <text start="541.57" dur="3.3">that mccabe had authorized the</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="2.82">disclosure to the Wall Street Journal is</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="4.17">entirely consistent with McCabe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.31" dur="4.769">statement 2i NS t on May nights that he</text>
  <text start="549.04" dur="4.919">had quote no idea where the disclosure</text>

  <text start="610.66" dur="5.85">you hide at that point so you see how</text>
  <text start="613.93" dur="5.399">logically this has worked out indeed</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="4.71">McCabe contacted the OIG on August 1st</text>
  <text start="619.329" dur="4.141">to attempt to correct his July 28th</text>
  <text start="621.22" dur="5.04">testimony only after he was made aware</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="4.979">on July 28th that the OIG had text</text>
  <text start="626.26" dur="4.68">messages from special counsel that would</text>
  <text start="628.449" dur="4.051">likely enable the OIG to soon learn the</text>

  <text start="632.5" dur="5.329">counsels actions special counsel Lisa</text>
  <text start="635.199" dur="8.461">page so McCabe is texting with Lisa page</text>
  <text start="637.829" dur="8.681">the IG where the Inspector General is</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="5.01">talking to Lisa page as well somebody</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="4.139">tells McCabe that they&amp;#39;ve got your text</text>
  <text start="648.67" dur="8.58">messages dude and then McCabe decides</text>
  <text start="650.649" dur="9.391">uh-oh I&amp;#39;m screwed McCabe is done now his</text>
  <text start="657.25" dur="4.079">lawyers refute this and I wanted you to</text>
  <text start="660.04" dur="3.299">listen I hope I did a good job</text>
  <text start="661.329" dur="4.831">explaining that but I want you to listen</text>
  <text start="663.339" dur="4.401">to what his lawyers saying how Horowitz</text>
  <text start="666.16" dur="5.05">destroys his attorneys hold</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="6.54">listen to what McCabe&amp;#39;s attorneys say</text>
  <text start="671.21" dur="6.79">this is like the last breaths of a</text>

  <text start="678" dur="5.64">by McCabe&amp;#39;s counsel after reviewing a</text>

  <text start="721.65" dur="5.37">not it is noteworthy that McCabe did not</text>

  <text start="727.02" dur="5.76">during any of four prior interviews and</text>

  <text start="784.35" dur="5.34">superiors wink and a nod okay it&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="786.96" dur="4.32">no problem so the fact that he didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="875.58" dur="2.22">attorney says well he was really</text>
  <text start="876.63" dur="4.62">distracted because he had all this other</text>
  <text start="877.8" dur="5.76">stuff going on the OIG responds given</text>
  <text start="881.25" dur="4.44">the significance of McCabe&amp;#39;s disclosure</text>
  <text start="883.56" dur="4.41">and the potential impact it had on FBI</text>
  <text start="885.69" dur="4.53">DOJ relations we have little doubt that</text>
  <text start="887.97" dur="3.93">no matter how focused Comey was on the</text>
  <text start="890.22" dur="4.11">Clinton email investigation or the</text>
  <text start="891.9" dur="5.01">Weiner laptop issues or other matters</text>
  <text start="894.33" dur="3.9">Comey would have recalled McCabe telling</text>
  <text start="896.91" dur="3.99">him that he had been the source of the</text>
  <text start="898.23" dur="5.21">disclosure if in fact McCabe had told Co</text>
  <text start="900.9" dur="5.4">me the truth now why is this important</text>
  <text start="903.44" dur="4.69">well James Comey throughout this entire</text>
  <text start="906.3" dur="4.979">report and every time he&amp;#39;s interviewed</text>
  <text start="908.13" dur="5.459">stresses that because McCabe leaked to</text>
  <text start="911.279" dur="3.75">The Wall Street Journal it revealed the</text>
  <text start="913.589" dur="4.921">existence of an ongoing investigation</text>
  <text start="915.029" dur="6.331">into the Clinton Foundation I believe it</text>
  <text start="918.51" dur="4.47">was and the FBI by principle does not</text>
  <text start="921.36" dur="3.69">confirm or deny investigations</text>
  <text start="922.98" dur="3.75">so by McCabe leaking they completely</text>
  <text start="925.05" dur="3.42">blew that policy out of the water and</text>
  <text start="926.73" dur="3.18">that was something that Comey felt very</text>
  <text start="928.47" dur="3.15">strongly about now say what you want</text>
  <text start="929.91" dur="3.419">about call me and this person in this</text>
  <text start="931.62" dur="2.079">instance we&amp;#39;re just looking at this one</text>
  <text start="933.329" dur="5.07">Lee</text>
  <text start="933.699" dur="7.92">this one bit of testimony from Comey so</text>
  <text start="938.399" dur="5.831">it was so harmful to the Department of</text>
  <text start="941.619" dur="5.791">Justice&amp;#39;s supposedly relationship with</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="5.339">the FBI that it would have been as such</text>
  <text start="947.41" dur="3.869">consequence that Comey definitely would</text>
  <text start="949.569" dur="3.661">have cared about it and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="951.279" dur="4.55">argument that the IG is making here to</text>
  <text start="953.23" dur="7.019">dispute McCabe&amp;#39;s attorneys point to</text>
  <text start="955.829" dur="6.82">finally mccabe argues that Comey quote</text>
  <text start="960.249" dur="4.38">would have every incentive to distance</text>
  <text start="962.649" dur="5.011">himself from this disclosure end quote</text>
  <text start="964.629" dur="5.13">due to McCabe&amp;#39;s belief that the OIG is</text>
  <text start="967.66" dur="5.729">reviewing commis disclosure of other</text>
  <text start="969.759" dur="5.31">information to the media so in other</text>
  <text start="973.389" dur="3.331">words Comey has every reason to cover</text>
  <text start="975.069" dur="3.32">this up that he knew because he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="976.72" dur="5.19">investigated for other leaks</text>
  <text start="978.389" dur="5.62">however mccabe provides no factual basis</text>

  <text start="1048.889" dur="4.841">here there&amp;#39;s one more we&amp;#39;ll go through</text>
  <text start="1051.21" dur="4.62">its a footnote on 11 which is this and</text>
  <text start="1053.73" dur="4.049">it&amp;#39;s all about all of his basically all</text>
  <text start="1055.83" dur="3.99">of McCabe&amp;#39;s or bottles are about Comey</text>
  <text start="1057.779" dur="4.65">which is interesting given that Comey</text>
  <text start="1059.82" dur="4.02">was just brought in to talk to the</text>
  <text start="1062.429" dur="2.37">people that are making the decision</text>
  <text start="1063.84" dur="3.66">whether or not they&amp;#39;re gonna charge</text>
  <text start="1064.799" dur="4.471">McCabe in this case just think about</text>
  <text start="1067.5" dur="3.6">that for a second now this reports been</text>
  <text start="1069.27" dur="3.63">out in the open Colby&amp;#39;s had a chance to</text>
  <text start="1071.1" dur="2.88">look at McCabe&amp;#39;s arguments Comey knows</text>
  <text start="1072.9" dur="3.27">that mccabe was trying to throw him</text>
  <text start="1073.98" dur="5.31">under the bus now they bring comeon to</text>
  <text start="1076.17" dur="5.19">talk to the US Attorney about whether or</text>
  <text start="1079.29" dur="5.01">not they should prosecute McCabe not</text>
  <text start="1081.36" dur="3.92">smart on McCabe&amp;#39;s part excuse me sorry</text>
  <text start="1084.3" dur="5.31">about that</text>
  <text start="1085.28" dur="6.97">so this this paragraph says Comey did</text>
  <text start="1089.61" dur="4.8">not testify that mccabe affirmatively</text>
  <text start="1092.25" dur="5.19">and explicitly denied having authorized</text>
  <text start="1094.41" dur="5.1">the disclosure but rather that mccabe in</text>
  <text start="1097.44" dur="4.05">former fashion led him to believe that</text>
  <text start="1099.51" dur="4.08">mccabe did not know how the Wall Street</text>

  <text start="1103.59" dur="4.62">definitely didn&amp;#39;t tell Co me that he</text>
  <text start="1105.45" dur="7.32">authorized it so in other words the call</text>
  <text start="1108.21" dur="6.78">was supposedly the PA d AG telling</text>
  <text start="1112.77" dur="4.26">McCabe to back off of the Clinton</text>

  <text start="1120.15" dur="3.6">was pushing back on me not to</text>
