  <text start="86.189" dur="7.441">a 1 minute and 19 seconds into this</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="6.72">interview I guess the easiest question</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="3.9">is why did you meet with Miss Sid you</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="3.87">had mentioned on Fox and Friends ed the</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="2.61">place you were working set up the</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="2.52">meeting I thought that was fascinating</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="4.83">you explain a little more about that</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="7.14">yeah yeah of course so yeah so professor</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="5.07">MIPS ed is a Maltese professor just so</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="2.009">everybody understands he&amp;#39;s not a Russian</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="3.57">okay</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="4.441">I was working at this organization in</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="3.359">London named a London Center for</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="3.959">international law practice that</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="4.29">unbeknownst to me at the time was</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="5.431">apparently some sort of shrugs group for</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="6.72">X Western diplomats and X Western</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="6.27">intelligence types of personalities as</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="5.98">well the legal counsel of the FBI is a</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="6.129">director the legal counsel for the eff</text>
  <text start="133.959" dur="5.161">I in the UK Arvinder Somme Bay just</text>
  <text start="136.989" dur="5.22">happens to also be a director at this</text>
  <text start="139.12" dur="6.449">organization I used to work for so so</text>
  <text start="142.209" dur="5.76">I&amp;#39;m gonna stop it there so he says he</text>
  <text start="145.569" dur="4.26">didn&amp;#39;t know that the organisation that</text>
  <text start="147.969" dur="3.69">he was working for was a front group for</text>
  <text start="149.829" dur="6.931">ex diplomats and ex-intelligence</text>
  <text start="151.659" dur="6.901">officers so my follow up would be so how</text>
  <text start="156.76" dur="6.209">were you working there when did you</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="7.41">start working there how did you happen</text>
  <text start="162.969" dur="4.77">upon this position George papadopolis</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="3.689">started at the Bend carpet Carson</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="4.14">campaign in December of 2015</text>
  <text start="169.659" dur="4.711">he left the Ben Carson campaign in</text>
  <text start="171.879" dur="4.711">February of 2016 he started with the</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="5.19">Trump campaign unofficially in March of</text>
  <text start="176.59" dur="5.64">2016 there&amp;#39;s a month between those two</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="4.62">jobs he somehow landed a job with the</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="4.02">London Centre or had he been there</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="3.929">previously so we&amp;#39;d need more</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="3.389">clarification on how he ended up there</text>
  <text start="188.109" dur="3.63">and what those early months sort of</text>
  <text start="189.639" dur="4.53">looked like because this is really gray</text>
  <text start="191.739" dur="3.84">and it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me so</text>
  <text start="194.169" dur="3.3">basically he went from relative</text>
  <text start="195.579" dur="3.66">obscurity to working on two major</text>
  <text start="197.469" dur="4.681">presidential campaigns in a period of</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="4.771">four months and he started working at an</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="2.94">organization that he later learned was</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="4.74">some sort of a front group for</text>
  <text start="205.09" dur="6.989">intelligence but he&amp;#39;s not any of those</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="4.709">things why would you be there surrounded</text>
  <text start="212.079" dur="3.931">by all of these people like is he the</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="4.02">only one has anyone ever asked that</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="3.929">question has he ever asked that question</text>
  <text start="217.479" dur="7.141">what hasn&amp;#39;t anyone else asked that</text>
  <text start="219.939" dur="6.241">question I just it&amp;#39;s just something that</text>
  <text start="224.62" dur="9.03">I think we need the answer to how did</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="9.63">you end up at the London Center in</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="3.839">addition to that Sam Clovis interviewed</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="3.569">Papadopoulos for the Trump campaign and</text>
  <text start="237.489" dur="4.5">Papadopoulos was living in London at the</text>
  <text start="239.379" dur="6.48">time so if he was communicating with him</text>
  <text start="241.989" dur="5.43">from London I&amp;#39;m curious if UK</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="3.15">intelligence could have been spying on</text>
  <text start="247.419" dur="3.84">that conversation with Clovis in the</text>
  <text start="249.009" dur="3.69">United States or vice versa</text>
  <text start="251.259" dur="4.32">at that time and I&amp;#39;m sure the answer to</text>
  <text start="252.699" dur="7.44">that question is yes so let&amp;#39;s continue</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="7.08">to listen to this I will just keep us I</text>
  <text start="260.139" dur="3.96">told this organization look I&amp;#39;m joining</text>
  <text start="262.659" dur="4.921">the Trump campaign I&amp;#39;m leaving I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="264.099" dur="5.521">back to the u.s. I&amp;#39;m leaving London</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="4.44">but they all of a sudden told me but</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="5.069">before you leave you really need to come</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="5.13">to Rome with us and we want to introduce</text>
  <text start="274.689" dur="3.841">you to some people there so I say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="3.6">fine you know I&amp;#39;ll go to Rome it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="4.939">three-day holiday before I get back to</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="4.169">Washington and they introduced me to</text>
  <text start="283.469" dur="4.271">Joseph Mifsud</text>
  <text start="284.919" dur="5.22">at this University in Rome called link</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="4.139">campus now this isn&amp;#39;t any Normal</text>
  <text start="290.139" dur="4.441">University in Rome I mean at the time I</text>
  <text start="291.879" dur="4.891">had no idea what this place was but</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="4.649">apparently it&amp;#39;s a training ground for</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="5.94">Western intelligence operatives in Rome</text>
  <text start="299.229" dur="4.891">the CIA has held symposiums there David</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="3.329">Ignatius from the Washington Post has</text>
  <text start="304.12" dur="4.229">actually written extensively about this</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="7.831">place and you know they have connections</text>
  <text start="308.349" dur="8.25">to the FBI and other groups okay so he</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="5.43">says all of a sudden they told me all of</text>
  <text start="316.599" dur="4.021">a sudden after he tells them that that</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="3.959">he&amp;#39;s going to be working for the Trump</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="4.32">campaign they all of a sudden tell him</text>
  <text start="323.259" dur="3.301">that before he leaves they really need</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="2.999">him to come to Rome and Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="3.96">agrees now it may seem like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="327.939" dur="3.84">nitpicking here but it really curious to</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="4.049">me who pays for the travel between</text>
  <text start="331.779" dur="4.98">London and Rome we know that Peter</text>
  <text start="334.569" dur="4.171">struck goes to Rome at some point to</text>
  <text start="336.759" dur="3.931">meet with the FBI folks Steele goes to</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="5.459">Rome at some point to meet with FBI</text>
  <text start="340.69" dur="7.89">folks we know that pre step goes to Rome</text>
  <text start="344.199" dur="6.421">to meet with FBI folks still goes to</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="3.989">Rome on July 5th a day after Clinton is</text>
  <text start="350.62" dur="3">interviewed by the FBI so this is</text>
  <text start="352.569" dur="2.761">obviously a few months after</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="3.75">Papadopoulos takes a position with the</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="3.66">campaign but it&amp;#39;s obvious here there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="3.359">something going on with FBI leads in</text>
  <text start="358.99" dur="5.039">Rome so it&amp;#39;s interesting to me that</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="6">Papadopoulos ends up in Rome after he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="364.029" dur="4.26">working for this intelligence group that</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="4.101">he doesn&amp;#39;t know as an intelligence group</text>
  <text start="368.289" dur="4.981">and they just say you got to go to Rome</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="4">and he starts at this intelligence group</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="5.759">before he starts working for the Trump</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="6.449">campaign he says he goes to link campus</text>
  <text start="379.029" dur="3.871">in Rome he meets with Mifsud there he</text>
  <text start="381.279" dur="3.781">says he didn&amp;#39;t have any idea this was a</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="3.78">training ground for Western Intel but</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="3.719">then he goes on to say that the CIA you</text>
  <text start="386.68" dur="3.78">held lectures there Ignatius from</text>
  <text start="388.779" dur="4.411">Washington Post has written written</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="5.129">extensively about about it I find that</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="4.529">interesting because the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="395.589" dur="3.3">as we learned in my last video is also</text>
  <text start="397.719" dur="3.511">the first outlet to talk about</text>
  <text start="398.889" dur="4.111">Papadopoulos and leak the page FISA</text>
  <text start="401.23" dur="5.25">so there are paying close attention to</text>
  <text start="403" dur="4.71">lean campus as well we&amp;#39;re gonna keep</text>
  <text start="406.48" dur="5.4">listening here because there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="6.03">thing at 2:59 I also saw many Italian</text>
  <text start="411.88" dur="3.93">diplomats there the ex Ford Minister of</text>
  <text start="413.74" dur="4.71">Italy was uh was the rector of this</text>
  <text start="415.81" dur="4.29">university so things started to pop in</text>
  <text start="418.45" dur="4.41">my mind that you know this isn&amp;#39;t just a</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="4.23">random event or a random meeting they</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="3.72">tell me it&amp;#39;s very important for you to</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="3.78">meet Joseph Mifsud I had no idea who</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="4.41">this person was he came up to me</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="6.24">presented himself as this mid-fifties a</text>
  <text start="430.99" dur="7.4">former diplomat who knew the world I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="7.02">gonna stop it there he mentions quote</text>
  <text start="438.39" dur="7.93">things started to pop in his mind that</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="7.38">you know this isn&amp;#39;t a random event no in</text>
  <text start="446.32" dur="3.93">the beginning of his answer he stated he</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="4.59">didn&amp;#39;t know at the time that this was a</text>
  <text start="450.25" dur="6.09">training ground for Western Intel he had</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="5.19">no idea Veni States he was able to</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="5.15">identify that the ex Ward Minister of</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="5.73">Italy was the rector at the University</text>
  <text start="461.49" dur="4.33">two things are possible either he did</text>
  <text start="464.26" dur="4.08">the research before he went to the</text>
  <text start="465.82" dur="4.47">University on the trip or he just knew</text>
  <text start="468.34" dur="3.72">that the ex Ward Minister of Italy was</text>
  <text start="470.29" dur="4.35">the rector and neither of them square</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="4.26">with his first statement so I know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.64" dur="4.08">only three minutes in and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="476.32" dur="5.58">kind of nitpicky I&amp;#39;m not trying to pick</text>
  <text start="478.72" dur="4.26">on Papadopoulos but these are really</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="2.82">important things that he&amp;#39;s speaking</text>
  <text start="482.98" dur="4.23">about and I think that we need to know</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="4.95">the answers to the questions blanket</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="5.64">statements here are unclear this is very</text>
  <text start="489.67" dur="4.89">very important in my opinion we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="492.85" dur="3.42">talk a little bit more about Mifsud now</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="3.03">and we go back to three minutes and</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="3.21">eight seconds and we&amp;#39;ll start from there</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="5.13">laws she came up to me presented himself</text>
  <text start="499.48" dur="6.75">as this mid-fifties a former diplomat</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="5.28">who knew the world you know yeah I</text>
  <text start="506.23" dur="4.8">noticed in your statement in the</text>
  <text start="508" dur="4.68">statement of offense that you seemed to</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="3.12">which which I find and I&amp;#39;m gonna get to</text>
  <text start="512.68" dur="4.38">this part later but you seem to believe</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="4.829">at the time that he was puffing people</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="4.289">up that he was a nothing and he was just</text>
  <text start="518.979" dur="3.961">now is that right I mean what what made</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="2.82">you believe that and and just to be</text>
  <text start="522.94" dur="2.52">clear I just want to reiterate something</text>
  <text start="524.169" dur="3.091">you said earlier so the audience is</text>
  <text start="525.46" dur="4.65">clear on this the place you&amp;#39;re working</text>

  <text start="568.57" dur="2.97">mentions that they want him to meet</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="4.26">Mifsud but they have no idea who Mifsud</text>
  <text start="571.54" dur="4.47">was however Mifsud was one of the leads</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="3.66">at the London Center which would lead me</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="4.079">to believe that Papadopoulos was</text>
  <text start="577.72" dur="4.59">brand-new there or he&amp;#39;s obscuring that</text>
  <text start="580.089" dur="4.051">he knew these people so Dan interrupts</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="3.33">him to clarify that Papadopoulos didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="584.14" dur="3.81">ask for the meeting for Mifsud and that</text>
  <text start="585.64" dur="4.05">the organization he&amp;#39;s working for with</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="4.32">the ties to Western intelligence dead</text>
  <text start="589.69" dur="5.22">and Papadopoulos agrees he talks about</text>
  <text start="592.27" dur="4.53">Sam Bay he says quote anyone could</text>
  <text start="594.91" dur="3.75">simply google this person and you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="596.8" dur="6.03">she has the legal counsel of the FBI in</text>
  <text start="598.66" dur="6.48">the UK so this strikes me here this</text>
  <text start="602.83" dur="4.56">struck me there&amp;#39;s an archived website</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="4.23">for the London center that shows Sam Bay</text>
  <text start="607.39" dur="4.5">as the head of international human</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="4.37">rights and criminal justice a position</text>
  <text start="611.89" dur="4.68">she shares with Martin Pauline</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="5.95">my question to Papadopoulos would be if</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="4.83">you started having red flags when you</text>
  <text start="619.69" dur="4.47">were invited to Rome which he himself</text>
  <text start="621.4" dur="4.71">states and you could find that Sam Bay</text>
  <text start="624.16" dur="4.83">as the legal counsel for the FBI in the</text>
  <text start="626.11" dur="5.31">UK with a simple Google search why</text>
  <text start="628.99" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t he begin to become more hesitant</text>
  <text start="631.42" dur="4.44">if it was so easy to figure out with a</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="3.78">simple Google search and his submit</text>
  <text start="635.86" dur="3.15">suspicions were already piqued because</text>
  <text start="637.54" dur="6.44">they wanted him to travel to Rome for</text>
  <text start="639.01" dur="7.65">some odd reason then why why did you</text>
  <text start="643.98" dur="5.5">understand what I&amp;#39;m saying in addition</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="4.77">Mifsud Stender at the London Center runs</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="4.29">somewhat parallel to Papadopoulos being</text>
  <text start="651.43" dur="4.61">appointed to Carson&amp;#39;s campaign so</text>
  <text start="653.77" dur="5.009">archived websites show that Mifsud</text>
  <text start="656.04" dur="4.96">started being announced as working with</text>
  <text start="658.779" dur="4.441">the London center in November of 2015</text>
  <text start="661" dur="4.02">just a few short months before</text>
  <text start="663.22" dur="4.02">Papadopoulos worked with Carson and</text>
  <text start="665.02" dur="3.509">again we need to know when Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="667.24" dur="3.719">started working for</text>
  <text start="668.529" dur="4.081">the London center he isn&amp;#39;t saying he</text>
  <text start="670.959" dur="3.511">attended their lectures or that he&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="672.61" dur="4.11">intern he&amp;#39;s saying he was literally</text>
  <text start="674.47" dur="4.349">employed by them and there&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="4.95">difference there he took a position as</text>
  <text start="678.819" dur="4.62">the head of the Center for international</text>
  <text start="681.67" dur="4.74">energy and national resources long</text>
  <text start="683.439" dur="4.5">Security Division do you guys do any</text>
  <text start="686.41" dur="3.33">research about a company that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="687.939" dur="3.931">gonna work for before you taking a</text>
  <text start="689.74" dur="3.959">position there like do you look and see</text>
  <text start="691.87" dur="2.279">like what is this company about what do</text>
  <text start="693.699" dur="3.75">they do</text>
  <text start="694.149" dur="5.13">who do they represent etc so the article</text>
  <text start="697.449" dur="5.45">on medium that I was able to find states</text>
  <text start="699.279" dur="10.261">that he joined LC ILP the London center</text>
  <text start="702.899" dur="10.24">immediately after he left the Carson</text>
  <text start="709.54" dur="5.909">campaign and there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a quote</text>
  <text start="713.139" dur="4.911">in here that says exactly how he got his</text>
  <text start="715.449" dur="4.411">job at LCI LP is still a mystery</text>
  <text start="718.05" dur="4.3">according to his own testimony</text>
  <text start="719.86" dur="4.62">Papadopoulos first met Mifsud honor</text>
  <text start="722.35" dur="4.5">about the 14th of March while travelling</text>
  <text start="724.48" dur="2.969">in Italy the obvious assumption is that</text>
  <text start="726.85" dur="3.539">Mifsud</text>
  <text start="727.449" dur="5.041">eased him into LC ILP but it&amp;#39;s unlikely</text>
  <text start="730.389" dur="3.57">to have been as a result of the 14th of</text>
  <text start="732.49" dur="4.139">March meeting which we know now is not</text>
  <text start="733.959" dur="5.341">the case an archived copy of the our</text>
  <text start="736.629" dur="4.68">team page on their website recorded on</text>
  <text start="739.3" dur="4.95">the same day shows the Papadopoulos was</text>
  <text start="741.309" dur="4.681">already in his post his LinkedIn profile</text>
  <text start="744.25" dur="6.899">which may or not be accurate says he</text>
  <text start="745.99" dur="7.019">joined LC ILP in February of 2016 just</text>
  <text start="751.149" dur="3.54">questions I would I would drill down a</text>
  <text start="753.009" dur="5.491">little bit more on that and get some</text>
  <text start="754.689" dur="5.64">more answers out of Papadopoulos so</text>
  <text start="758.5" dur="7.319">we&amp;#39;re gonna go to four minutes and 50</text>
  <text start="760.329" dur="6.93">seconds excuse me if you guys want to</text>
  <text start="765.819" dur="2.851">listen to this entire interview straight</text>
  <text start="767.259" dur="2.76">through this is not the place to do it</text>
  <text start="768.67" dur="7.709">so I&amp;#39;m jumping around I&amp;#39;m just letting</text>
  <text start="770.019" dur="7.74">you know I mean that I mean I think I</text>
  <text start="776.379" dur="4.111">think you&amp;#39;re absolutely right this guy</text>
  <text start="777.759" dur="6.541">just so everybody understands so this</text>
  <text start="780.49" dur="5.719">guy he presents himself as this insider</text>
  <text start="784.3" dur="3.68">to the world and then he says I know</text>
  <text start="786.209" dur="4.54">Moscow I know</text>
  <text start="787.98" dur="4.539">Vietnam I know London I mean you have to</text>
  <text start="790.749" dur="3.871">understand the type of personality this</text>
  <text start="792.519" dur="4.351">person was so I listened to him I said</text>
  <text start="794.62" dur="3.48">you know I already have contacts in the</text>
  <text start="796.87" dur="2.88">Middle East you know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="798.1" dur="3.51">need them for anything like that but</text>
  <text start="799.75" dur="2.76">let&amp;#39;s see what he has to offer a week</text>
  <text start="801.61" dur="3.51">later I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="802.51" dur="4.59">in London you know kind of preparing my</text>
  <text start="805.12" dur="3.57">life to move back to the US and he</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="4.08">emails me out of the blue and he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="808.69" dur="4.74">I need to introduce you to a very</text>
  <text start="811.18" dur="4.14">important girl and I said okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.43" dur="3.33">great who is this I go back to the</text>
  <text start="815.32" dur="3.12">London Center for international law</text>
  <text start="816.76" dur="4.02">practice and all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="818.44" dur="4.98">directors over there are telling me home</text>
  <text start="820.78" dur="5.66">guys this is Putin&amp;#39;s niece so they were</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="3.02">all in on this scam</text>
  <text start="826.84" dur="7.72">and Dan laughs at that but I have some</text>
  <text start="830.24" dur="6.12">questions about that so Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="834.56" dur="3.78">says he goes to Rome and he meets with</text>
  <text start="836.36" dur="5.55">the braggadocio Smith said a fellow</text>
  <text start="838.34" dur="5.01">director at the L CIE LP and he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="841.91" dur="3.66">need him for contacts in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="843.35" dur="3.66">but maybe he can use him elsewhere as</text>
  <text start="845.57" dur="3.65">basically what we get from Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="847.01" dur="4.41">a week later he&amp;#39;s back in London</text>
  <text start="849.22" dur="4.03">remember after he says the three-day</text>
  <text start="851.42" dur="3.81">trip because he has to go to the US and</text>
  <text start="853.25" dur="3.9">he gets an email from Mifsud</text>
  <text start="855.23" dur="5.49">which she either shares with the other</text>
  <text start="857.15" dur="7.11">directors working at there or who knows</text>
  <text start="860.72" dur="5.1">he receives it in other words either he</text>
  <text start="864.26" dur="3.77">shares the email with the directors the</text>
  <text start="865.82" dur="6.21">other directors at the London Center or</text>
  <text start="868.03" dur="5.62">they know he got this email somehow and</text>
  <text start="872.03" dur="3.39">we find out that everyone there tells</text>
  <text start="873.65" dur="3.3">Papadopoulos that this person that</text>
  <text start="875.42" dur="4.02">Mifsud is trying to introduce them to is</text>
  <text start="876.95" dur="4.11">Putin&amp;#39;s niece my immediate follow-up</text>
  <text start="879.44" dur="4.5">would have been this to him so George</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="6.33">what made Mifsud think that you wanted</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="5.22">to meet someone connected to Putin you</text>
  <text start="887.39" dur="3.15">had basically a conversation with Clovis</text>
  <text start="889.16" dur="2.82">about your role in the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="890.54" dur="4.14">and this person is now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="891.98" dur="4.47">attempting to introduce you to someone</text>
  <text start="894.68" dur="5.82">who&amp;#39;s presented to you as Putin&amp;#39;s niece</text>
  <text start="896.45" dur="6.3">why George did you share this email from</text>
  <text start="900.5" dur="4.41">anyone or with anyone from London centre</text>
  <text start="902.75" dur="3.45">if you didn&amp;#39;t share it how did they know</text>
  <text start="904.91" dur="3.54">he was trying to introduce you to</text>
  <text start="906.2" dur="3.84">Putin&amp;#39;s nice if you did share it</text>
  <text start="908.45" dur="3.84">what made you share it and what were</text>
  <text start="910.04" dur="3.81">those conversations like what did those</text>
  <text start="912.29" dur="3.54">people say to you how did you approach</text>
  <text start="913.85" dur="3.87">them why did they answer you the way</text>
  <text start="915.83" dur="3.57">they did what did you think when they</text>
  <text start="917.72" dur="3.12">did answer you that way and remember</text>
  <text start="919.4" dur="2.94">these things because they&amp;#39;re gonna come</text>
  <text start="920.84" dur="3.96">back in a little bit and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="922.34" dur="4.77">make a lot more sense so again I may be</text>
  <text start="924.8" dur="4.08">sounding nitpicky but to me that&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="927.11" dur="4.11">important detail of the story that is</text>
  <text start="928.88" dur="4.56">basically glazed over and I understand</text>
  <text start="931.22" dur="3.45">why I mean I&amp;#39;m not saying that damn ones</text>
  <text start="933.44" dur="3.48">you know didn&amp;#39;t do an absolutely</text>
  <text start="934.67" dur="4.65">fantastic job interviewing Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="936.92" dur="4.11">but if I could go back and interview</text>
  <text start="939.32" dur="3.45">Papadopoulos myself given that Dan has</text>
  <text start="941.03" dur="2.93">done this amazing interview these are</text>
  <text start="942.77" dur="5.25">some of the questions that I would ask</text>
  <text start="943.96" dur="6.16">so at 5:49 we get a little more so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="948.02" dur="4.8">gonna start playing here it was it it</text>
  <text start="950.12" dur="4.38">wasn&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t just Mifsud telling me</text>
  <text start="952.82" dur="4.26">that I&amp;#39;m introducing into Putin&amp;#39;s niece</text>
  <text start="954.5" dur="5.51">and it was the directors at this London</text>
  <text start="957.08" dur="5.37">centre for it wait this is big George so</text>
  <text start="960.01" dur="4.66">she&amp;#39;s not Putin&amp;#39;s niece which we know</text>
  <text start="962.45" dur="4.05">now but this person the Maltese</text>
  <text start="964.67" dur="4.47">professor Massoud introduces to you I</text>
  <text start="966.5" dur="4.56">believe she goes by Olga Vinogradova</text>
  <text start="969.14" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s a couple couple couple different</text>
  <text start="971.06" dur="4.83">names out there but the people at the</text>
  <text start="973.13" dur="4.89">London center seem to believe she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="975.89" dur="7.8">Putin&amp;#39;s niece - which seems odd because</text>
  <text start="978.02" dur="6.54">she&amp;#39;s not Putin&amp;#39;s well look that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="983.69" dur="3.66">exactly right</text>
  <text start="984.56" dur="5.58">I get there she&amp;#39;s just a young lady</text>
  <text start="987.35" dur="5.04">barely speaks English you know just kind</text>
  <text start="990.14" dur="4.59">of an obscure person sitting and smiling</text>
  <text start="992.39" dur="7.65">okay so I you know I felt her it I was a</text>
  <text start="994.73" dur="7.08">dupe at the time wait this is the so the</text>
  <text start="1000.04" dur="3.6">email to Papadopoulos says that Mifsud</text>
  <text start="1001.81" dur="3.6">wants to introduce him to putin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1003.64" dur="4.44">niece and we&amp;#39;ve covered why that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1005.41" dur="3.21">strange so Papadopoulos goes back to</text>
  <text start="1008.08" dur="1.95">London</text>
  <text start="1008.62" dur="3.69">takes the meeting with Mifsud and</text>
  <text start="1010.03" dur="3.99">supposedly Putin&amp;#39;s niece who he says</text>
  <text start="1012.31" dur="2.91">sits there and acts obscure and isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1014.02" dur="1.8">saying anything and doesn&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="2.88">English</text>
  <text start="1015.82" dur="4.62">and Papadopoulos states that he fell for</text>
  <text start="1018.1" dur="4.86">her scam and then Dan goes on to talk</text>
  <text start="1020.44" dur="4.14">about the honeypot theory that this girl</text>
  <text start="1022.96" dur="3.21">was there pretending not to speak any</text>
  <text start="1024.58" dur="3.51">English and actually listening to try</text>
  <text start="1026.17" dur="3.96">and get Papadopoulos to speak freely to</text>
  <text start="1028.09" dur="4.98">Mifsud while she&amp;#39;s taking in all of the</text>
  <text start="1030.13" dur="4.5">information we never learn what their</text>
  <text start="1033.07" dur="4.14">conversation was like what they talk</text>
  <text start="1034.63" dur="7.41">about we get a very surface level view</text>
  <text start="1037.21" dur="6.3">of that meeting we get a lot more it&amp;#39;s 6</text>
  <text start="1042.04" dur="4.26">minutes and 30 seconds here and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1183.909" dur="3.51">they couldn&amp;#39;t communicate these are just</text>
  <text start="1185.529" dur="4.02">questions I would ask who gave it to him</text>
  <text start="1187.419" dur="4.35">did he ask for it what&amp;#39;s the purpose</text>
  <text start="1189.549" dur="4.26">here again I&amp;#39;m not insinuating anything</text>
  <text start="1191.769" dur="3.48">these are just questions that I like</text>
  <text start="1193.809" dur="3.57">immediately thought of when listening to</text>
  <text start="1195.249" dur="3.75">this interview the first time I listened</text>
  <text start="1197.379" dur="3.091">to it not even the second or the third I</text>
  <text start="1198.999" dur="2.731">was just like hmm well if she couldn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1211.36" dur="4.35">could be possible we just don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1213.509" dur="5.86">we&amp;#39;re gonna skip forward here to 9</text>
  <text start="1215.71" dur="6.089">minutes and 19 seconds let me throw</text>
  <text start="1219.369" dur="4.14">something out at you George if a lot of</text>
  <text start="1221.799" dur="3.75">this statement of offense stuff and when</text>
  <text start="1223.509" dur="3.781">you read the investigative documents on</text>
  <text start="1225.549" dur="3.811">your case when I find fascinating</text>
  <text start="1227.29" dur="4.38">but someone suggested to me and I</text>
  <text start="1229.36" dur="4.32">believe they&amp;#39;re onto something is a lot</text>
  <text start="1231.67" dur="3.87">of these statements of offense alleging</text>
  <text start="1233.68" dur="4.95">you did this and George did that and</text>
  <text start="1235.54" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s all spoken from a bird&amp;#39;s-eye view</text>
  <text start="1238.63" dur="4.38">in other words if you stop me if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1241.72" dur="2.82">not following me George I explained this</text>
  <text start="1243.01" dur="2.99">Jo Jo knows already because I&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="1244.54" dur="4.08">had this conversation on the air with Jo</text>
  <text start="1246" dur="5.83">it&amp;#39;s spoken like there was a third</text>
  <text start="1248.62" dur="6.6">person there and I&amp;#39;m what I&amp;#39;m suggesting</text>
  <text start="1251.83" dur="4.74">to you is that I think Vinogradova may</text>
  <text start="1255.22" dur="4.23">have been working with Westar</text>
  <text start="1256.57" dur="5.91">intelligence as well because if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1259.45" dur="5.16">Massoud telling them that who is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1262.48" dur="3.39">not you in other words at some ports at</text>
  <text start="1264.61" dur="3.75">some points in the investigative</text>
  <text start="1265.87" dur="3.84">documents it says and and M if Sood</text>
  <text start="1268.36" dur="3.51">wasn&amp;#39;t interested in and he was</text>
  <text start="1269.71" dur="4.38">interested and it&amp;#39;s an N it says and</text>
  <text start="1271.87" dur="4.62">Papadopoulos seemed this way and he</text>
  <text start="1274.09" dur="4.56">seemed that way and it&amp;#39;s spoken from a</text>
  <text start="1276.49" dur="4.2">view that there was an informant there</text>
  <text start="1278.65" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s why basically what Dan is saying</text>
  <text start="1280.69" dur="4.2">here is that Olga is the informant and</text>
  <text start="1283.12" dur="2.94">she was informing back to the government</text>
  <text start="1284.89" dur="3.81">about what she thought about</text>
  <text start="1286.06" dur="4.08">Papadopoulos and Mifsud from her</text>
  <text start="1288.7" dur="3.78">perspective that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s getting out</text>
  <text start="1290.14" dur="4.14">here as to what the first time you met</text>
  <text start="1292.48" dur="4.11">we grit vinaigrette OVA because it says</text>
  <text start="1294.28" dur="4.53">to me that that was the same person</text>
  <text start="1296.59" dur="4.53">vinegar Innova she spoke English the</text>
  <text start="1298.81" dur="3.66">whole time and was likely working for</text>
  <text start="1301.12" dur="4.13">someone connected to Western</text>
  <text start="1302.47" dur="5.58">intelligence to maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="1305.25" dur="4.63">oversee that meeting and make sure they</text>
  <text start="1308.05" dur="3.48">had some kind of corroboration about</text>
  <text start="1309.88" dur="3.18">what happened it makes perfect sense</text>
  <text start="1311.53" dur="4.44">when you read some of the charging</text>
  <text start="1313.06" dur="6.96">documents because it&amp;#39;s written as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1315.97" dur="6.33">never seen it look I mean I look I agree</text>
  <text start="1320.02" dur="3.84">with with you on that and but also the</text>
  <text start="1322.3" dur="3.93">own actually we do know them if so it</text>
  <text start="1323.86" dur="4.23">has substantial connections now because</text>
  <text start="1326.23" dur="3.33">about a week ago his lawyer when public</text>
  <text start="1328.09" dur="2.97">and said that he was working for Western</text>
  <text start="1329.56" dur="4.44">intelligence right and under their</text>
  <text start="1331.06" dur="4.95">guidance of the FBI so unless this guy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1334" dur="4.2">lawyer and I&amp;#39;m represented by great</text>
  <text start="1336.01" dur="4.17">lawyers and they would never lie about</text>
  <text start="1338.2" dur="3.99">me publicly they wouldn&amp;#39;t slander me you</text>
  <text start="1340.18" dur="3.93">know that&amp;#39;s just not what lawyers do if</text>
  <text start="1342.19" dur="3.21">his lawyers telling the truth which</text>
  <text start="1344.11" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s no reason for him to be lying</text>
  <text start="1345.4" dur="3.48">especially given what we know about</text>
  <text start="1347.41" dur="3.96">myths its connection to Western</text>
  <text start="1348.88" dur="4.62">intelligence how my meeting with him was</text>
  <text start="1351.37" dur="4.08">obviously orchestrated and now he</text>
  <text start="1353.5" dur="4.23">actually really had no connections to</text>
  <text start="1355.45" dur="4.05">Russia I mean he introduced me to the</text>
  <text start="1357.73" dur="3.09">fakeness of Putin who as you said</text>
  <text start="1359.5" dur="1.65">probably was working with Western in</text>
  <text start="1360.82" dur="3.87">solid</text>
  <text start="1361.15" dur="5.159">and a low-level think-tank analyst in</text>
  <text start="1364.69" dur="4.5">Moscow who I&amp;#39;ve never met to this day</text>
  <text start="1366.309" dur="3.331">over email so it makes I mean perfect</text>
  <text start="1369.19" dur="4.77">sense</text>
  <text start="1369.64" dur="6.12">George if if okay so Papadopoulos talks</text>
  <text start="1373.96" dur="3.27">about how Mifsud attorney has come out</text>
  <text start="1375.76" dur="4.86">and stated that he worked for western</text>
  <text start="1377.23" dur="5.28">intelligence and the FBI Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="1380.62" dur="4.35">says it&amp;#39;s obvious he has no connections</text>
  <text start="1382.51" dur="4.29">in russia and he was lying and that he</text>
  <text start="1384.97" dur="4.11">introduced him to the fake news nice of</text>
  <text start="1386.8" dur="4.68">Putin and some low-level think-tank</text>
  <text start="1389.08" dur="4.89">analysts in Moscow who Dan doesn&amp;#39;t ask</text>
  <text start="1391.48" dur="5.07">more about but I would have asked hey</text>
  <text start="1393.97" dur="4.62">George how did you meet the new analyst</text>
  <text start="1396.55" dur="4.62">where they just added on to an email</text>
  <text start="1398.59" dur="5.219">chain did you ask to meet this person</text>
  <text start="1401.17" dur="3.48">how were they introduced to you you know</text>
  <text start="1403.809" dur="2.911">did Mifsud</text>
  <text start="1404.65" dur="4.02">offer this person up to you in response</text>
  <text start="1406.72" dur="4.07">to you asking him and this is gonna</text>
  <text start="1408.67" dur="4.68">circle back around in a few minutes two</text>
  <text start="1410.79" dur="6.01">interesting questions I just would love</text>
  <text start="1413.35" dur="5.4">to have the answers to at 13 minutes and</text>
  <text start="1416.8" dur="8.42">41 seconds we get a little bit more</text>
  <text start="1418.75" dur="6.47">juice this whole interview was fantastic</text>
  <text start="1425.34" dur="3.79">how does that make you feel that you may</text>
  <text start="1427.72" dur="4.11">be the centerpiece of the biggest</text>
  <text start="1429.13" dur="5.58">political scandal of our time</text>
  <text start="1431.83" dur="6.15">you know honestly it&amp;#39;s been harder on my</text>
  <text start="1434.71" dur="4.77">wife Katherine she&amp;#39;s uh no she moved</text>
  <text start="1437.98" dur="4.11">from Italy to be with me through this</text>
  <text start="1439.48" dur="4.56">entire saga she&amp;#39;s had my back she</text>
  <text start="1442.09" dur="4.05">supported me publicly we&amp;#39;re doing our</text>
  <text start="1444.04" dur="3.9">best but now that new information is out</text>
  <text start="1446.14" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s a reason that first of all</text>
  <text start="1447.94" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s a reason that my wife has been</text>
  <text start="1449.8" dur="3.84">public and vocal about me actually</text>
  <text start="1451.45" dur="3.96">rescinding my plea agreement because</text>
  <text start="1453.64" dur="3.87">she&amp;#39;s known Mifsud longer than everyone</text>
  <text start="1455.41" dur="3.84">she actually used to work at the</text>
  <text start="1457.51" dur="4.049">European Parliament he knows about his</text>
  <text start="1459.25" dur="4.16">ties he used to meander around the</text>
  <text start="1461.559" dur="4.081">European Parliament the European</text>
  <text start="1463.41" dur="3.96">institutions and she note and she knew</text>
  <text start="1465.64" dur="4.86">about his connections to the Clintons</text>
  <text start="1467.37" dur="5.5">too you know the Socialists in Europe</text>
  <text start="1470.5" dur="3.9">this guy was not connected at all to the</text>
  <text start="1472.87" dur="3.18">Russians as far as you know she was</text>
  <text start="1474.4" dur="2.73">telling me and that&amp;#39;s why she was like</text>
  <text start="1476.05" dur="3.629">what on earth are you pleading guilty</text>
  <text start="1477.13" dur="4.41">for when this guy obviously is setting</text>
  <text start="1479.679" dur="4.231">you up at the time of course I had no</text>
  <text start="1481.54" dur="4.41">idea who this person was but do you know</text>
  <text start="1483.91" dur="5.43">when it really struck me with a knife in</text>
  <text start="1485.95" dur="5.91">my my heart was when the FBI presented</text>
  <text start="1489.34" dur="4.71">their sentencing memorandum and they</text>
  <text start="1491.86" dur="3.19">said that I was responsible for helping</text>
  <text start="1494.05" dur="4.09">Mifsud this</text>
  <text start="1495.05" dur="4.83">and that I was the only one with the</text>
  <text start="1498.14" dur="3.57">impression that Mifsud was a Russian</text>
  <text start="1499.88" dur="5.16">agent but there&amp;#39;s actually no evidence</text>
  <text start="1501.71" dur="4.65">that was ever supporting that fantasy</text>
  <text start="1505.04" dur="3.51">that he was working with Russian</text>
  <text start="1506.36" dur="4.44">intelligence so just to summarize it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1508.55" dur="4.11">been horrifying but America has my back</text>
  <text start="1510.8" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;ve had my back since day one and</text>
  <text start="1512.66" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;re going to get through this rather</text>
  <text start="1514.04" dur="7.59">than ever okay</text>
  <text start="1515.63" dur="8.7">I find Papadopoulos interests I his</text>
  <text start="1521.63" dur="4.98">answer very interesting here&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1524.33" dur="4.74">he states that Simona has taken it</text>
  <text start="1526.61" dur="6.51">harder he states she&amp;#39;s known Mifsud</text>
  <text start="1529.07" dur="5.49">longer than everyone problem according</text>
  <text start="1533.12" dur="2.85">to media reports an interview she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1534.56" dur="3.6">given she only worked at the London</text>
  <text start="1535.97" dur="4.44">Center for a short time three months</text>
  <text start="1538.16" dur="4.65">before she decided to leave because she</text>
  <text start="1540.41" dur="4.5">figured that they were quote a front for</text>
  <text start="1542.81" dur="3.69">something else so where did she know him</text>
  <text start="1544.91" dur="4.17">from she worked at the European</text>
  <text start="1546.5" dur="4.89">Parliament Papadopoulos says he used to</text>
  <text start="1549.08" dur="5.36">quote meander the halls and she knew</text>
  <text start="1551.39" dur="5.64">about his connections to the Clintons so</text>
  <text start="1554.44" dur="6.19">there&amp;#39;s evidence out there that she knew</text>
  <text start="1557.03" dur="5.58">him from 2009 but let&amp;#39;s remember how</text>
  <text start="1560.63" dur="3.57">many videos I&amp;#39;ve done about Simona and</text>
  <text start="1562.61" dur="3.42">Papadopoulos and their change of tune</text>
  <text start="1564.2" dur="3.51">and let&amp;#39;s also set up some information</text>
  <text start="1566.03" dur="3.12">here that will come in handy towards the</text>
  <text start="1567.71" dur="5.4">end of the interview in part two</text>
  <text start="1569.15" dur="7.8">tomorrow here&amp;#39;s the skinny Simona says</text>
  <text start="1573.11" dur="5.52">in a Business Insider interview which</text>
  <text start="1576.95" dur="4.05">will be in the description box below</text>

  <text start="1683.84" dur="4.11">nonsense confirmed but I&amp;#39;d be remiss if</text>
  <text start="1686.21" dur="3.36">I didn&amp;#39;t ask you these are stupid</text>

  <text start="1714.17" dur="4.2">secondly I know this is dumb forgive me</text>
  <text start="1716.66" dur="4.11">for asking but there are a lot of wackos</text>
  <text start="1718.37" dur="3.75">out there and a lot of them on Twitter</text>
  <text start="1720.77" dur="4.2">who some of them were even a blue</text>
  <text start="1722.12" dur="5.82">checkmarks have alluded to the fact that</text>
  <text start="1724.97" dur="5.04">you may have in fact been working with</text>
  <text start="1727.94" dur="3.96">the intelligence community against the</text>
  <text start="1730.01" dur="4.02">Donald Trump team can you please just</text>
  <text start="1731.9" dur="4.5">address this stuff so we can get that</text>
  <text start="1734.03" dur="3.66">out there there&amp;#39;s nothing further from</text>
  <text start="1736.4" dur="3.63">the truth and that I had absolutely</text>
  <text start="1737.69" dur="4.98">nothing to do with intelligence</text>
  <text start="1740.03" dur="4.47">operations against Trump except the one</text>
  <text start="1742.67" dur="3.66">that obviously set me up to try and hurt</text>
  <text start="1744.5" dur="4.77">Trump himself so just to be clear about</text>
  <text start="1746.33" dur="4.44">that so Dan basically goes on to ask</text>
  <text start="1749.27" dur="3.51">about those conspiracy theories that</text>
  <text start="1750.77" dur="3.69">Simona is Russian and that Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="1752.78" dur="3.78">was working with Intel as well and he</text>
  <text start="1754.46" dur="4.02">calls the theory stupid even though we</text>
  <text start="1756.56" dur="4.14">do have some valid questions here guys I</text>
  <text start="1758.48" dur="3.42">mean in my opinion so George tells us</text>
  <text start="1760.7" dur="2.16">his wife isn&amp;#39;t Russia</text>
  <text start="1761.9" dur="3.48">and she didn&amp;#39;t work with any</text>
  <text start="1762.86" dur="4.23">Intelligence Agency against Trump and</text>
  <text start="1765.38" dur="3.81">neither did he like he would come out</text>
  <text start="1767.09" dur="3.71">and tell Dan if he did at this point to</text>
  <text start="1769.19" dur="4.47">be quite honest I mean I&amp;#39;m just saying</text>
  <text start="1770.8" dur="4.33">so there that wipes that&amp;#39;s it all</text>
  <text start="1773.66" dur="2.96">settled let&amp;#39;s just move on and not ask</text>
  <text start="1775.13" dur="4.92">any more questions about that right</text>
  <text start="1776.62" dur="6.52">listen am I crazy here I mean it could</text>
  <text start="1780.05" dur="5.43">be that I&amp;#39;m crazy it could quite likely</text>
  <text start="1783.14" dur="3.87">be am I the only one out there that has</text>
  <text start="1785.48" dur="4.02">these questions that I&amp;#39;m asking in this</text>
  <text start="1787.01" dur="4.5">interview here are they nonsense am I</text>
  <text start="1789.5" dur="4.11">wasting my time is this something that I</text>
  <text start="1791.51" dur="3.54">shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing because everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1793.61" dur="4.56">starting to get on this kick of if you</text>
  <text start="1795.05" dur="5.01">question the official story quote if you</text>
  <text start="1798.17" dur="3.54">start asking questions you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1800.06" dur="6.06">conspiracy theorist and you know you</text>
  <text start="1801.71" dur="7.2">have stupid theories i I think doing</text>
  <text start="1806.12" dur="4.41">that is bringing us backwards backwards</text>
  <text start="1808.91" dur="3.24">and I&amp;#39;m really kind of sick of it</text>
  <text start="1810.53" dur="3.27">because if we weren&amp;#39;t asking these</text>
  <text start="1812.15" dur="8.49">questions in the first place we never</text>
  <text start="1813.8" dur="12.63">would have gotten here here I don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="1820.64" dur="7.59">like I&amp;#39;m stupid or that that that the</text>
  <text start="1826.43" dur="3.78">thought that there was a chance that</text>
  <text start="1828.23" dur="3.78">Papadopoulos could be working as an</text>
  <text start="1830.21" dur="4.08">intelligence asset for the government is</text>
  <text start="1832.01" dur="4.02">so far out of the realm of possibility</text>
  <text start="1834.29" dur="4.38">given the information we&amp;#39;ve been handed</text>
  <text start="1836.03" dur="4.62">and just because he&amp;#39;s saying no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1838.67" dur="2.85">that&amp;#39;s certainly not true let&amp;#39;s just get</text>
  <text start="1840.65" dur="2.55">that out of the way</text>
  <text start="1841.52" dur="3.96">that could be he could be telling the</text>
  <text start="1843.2" dur="4.11">truth and I hope that he is I hope that</text>
  <text start="1845.48" dur="4.11">he is telling the truth and that is all</text>
  <text start="1847.31" dur="4.17">100% and there&amp;#39;s no reason to question</text>
  <text start="1849.59" dur="5.19">anything that he&amp;#39;s saying but</text>
  <text start="1851.48" dur="5.34">unfortunately I still have questions and</text>
  <text start="1854.78" dur="3.93">there I think legitimate questions that</text>
  <text start="1856.82" dur="3.21">need answers and for everyone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1858.71" dur="2.73">saying like stop there are a couple</text>
  <text start="1860.03" dur="3.87">people are like stop wasting your time</text>
  <text start="1861.44" dur="6.81">on Papadopoulos no Papadopoulos is the</text>
  <text start="1863.9" dur="7.05">key to this entire story straight up so</text>
  <text start="1868.25" dur="5.28">rant over and I apologize I just I need</text>
  <text start="1870.95" dur="3.87">to I need I need to believe him and I</text>
  <text start="1873.53" dur="4.77">want to believe that he&amp;#39;s telling the</text>
  <text start="1874.82" dur="5.1">truth about everything but I mean just</text>
  <text start="1878.3" dur="6.9">in the first 15 minutes we&amp;#39;ve glossed</text>
  <text start="1879.92" dur="8.64">over some major major red flags let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1885.2" dur="4.77">move on 18 minutes and 47 seconds and</text>
  <text start="1888.56" dur="3.45">not even red flags that prove he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1889.97" dur="3.45">guilty of something just like red flags</text>
  <text start="1892.01" dur="3.45">like whoa you just dropped a bombshell</text>
  <text start="1893.42" dur="10.889">there can we clarify some things</text>
  <text start="1895.46" dur="11.189">you know hold on okay</text>
  <text start="1904.309" dur="3.451">and I understand you know you say what</text>
  <text start="1906.649" dur="3.241">you&amp;#39;re comfortable with when you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1907.76" dur="4.62">no pressure at all but though I believe</text>
  <text start="1909.89" dur="4.08">there are transcripts it&amp;#39;s been alluded</text>
  <text start="1912.38" dur="3.24">to by members of the hill who have read</text>
  <text start="1913.97" dur="3.66">these documents what those transcripts</text>
  <text start="1915.62" dur="4.14">are of is still an open question to be</text>
  <text start="1917.63" dur="4.59">candid I believe there are transcripts</text>
  <text start="1919.76" dur="4.2">of that are those transcripts going to</text>
  <text start="1922.22" dur="3.54">be exculpatory I mean at any point</text>
  <text start="1923.96" dur="4.199">during that conversation about the</text>
  <text start="1925.76" dur="5.73">Russian emails or the Russian dirt from</text>

  <text start="1944.36" dur="4.949">they drop a bomb on you it&amp;#39;s as if you</text>
  <text start="1947.75" dur="3.809">know I didn&amp;#39;t know what he wanted to</text>
  <text start="1949.309" dur="4.62">talk about and he just said to me as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1951.559" dur="4.321">sitting there enjoying my omelets George</text>

  <text start="1973.429" dur="4.561">about it so you know I was just looking</text>
  <text start="1976.19" dur="4.229">at him like okay that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="1977.99" dur="3.96">this guy is validating rumors but how on</text>
  <text start="1980.419" dur="3.181">earth would he have this information</text>
  <text start="1981.95" dur="3.63">this was going in my mind how does he</text>
  <text start="1983.6" dur="3.72">have this information if he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1985.58" dur="3.839">even introduce me to anyone of substance</text>

  <text start="2009.25" dur="3.87">being recorded this part is the most</text>
  <text start="2011.77" dur="3.18">puzzling but one of the more puzzling</text>
  <text start="2013.12" dur="3.72">parts of the interview for me so</text>
  <text start="2014.95" dur="3.9">Papadopoulos meets with Mifsud in april</text>

  <text start="2170.17" dur="8.189">two more parts now that absolutely and</text>
  <text start="2176.41" dur="3.57">the question that you know that comes in</text>
  <text start="2178.359" dur="4.98">my mind is why are there transcripts</text>
  <text start="2179.98" dur="5.46">with missed&amp;#39; who why why why was he</text>
  <text start="2183.339" dur="4.53">recording me and who sent him to record</text>
  <text start="2185.44" dur="5.61">me and how do how does somebody in our</text>
  <text start="2187.869" dur="5.131">government have or not have access to</text>
  <text start="2191.05" dur="4.019">those transcripts so we already know</text>
  <text start="2193" dur="4.02">that stuff in Halper was recording me we</text>
  <text start="2195.069" dur="4.081">know that Alexander Downer was recording</text>
  <text start="2197.02" dur="4.98">me it makes complete sense and Mifsud</text>
  <text start="2199.15" dur="4.709">who is tied into this trifecta was</text>
  <text start="2202" dur="3.42">recording me and you know what if he was</text>
  <text start="2203.859" dur="3.391">recording me I really hope those</text>
  <text start="2205.42" dur="3.78">transcripts are public because it</text>
  <text start="2207.25" dur="4.589">completely exonerates me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2209.2" dur="6.389">exculpatory and I had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="2211.839" dur="5.52">at wanting emails finding emails or ever</text>
  <text start="2215.589" dur="3.78">disseminating emails I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="2217.359" dur="6.631">get as far away as possible from this</text>
  <text start="2219.369" dur="7.94">guy Mifsud okay again I have a bit of an</text>
  <text start="2223.99" dur="8.309">issue here so annoying</text>
  <text start="2227.309" dur="8.321">hold on so Dan asks him about the</text>
  <text start="2232.299" dur="8.07">transcripts and about Mifsud puffing</text>
  <text start="2235.63" dur="6.63">himself up Papadopoulos replies brings</text>
  <text start="2240.369" dur="4.531">in the fact that both downer and helper</text>
  <text start="2242.26" dur="5.01">also recorded him and he wants them the</text>
  <text start="2244.9" dur="4.29">the Mifsud transcripts public now</text>
  <text start="2247.27" dur="5.25">remember this meeting took place in</text>
  <text start="2249.19" dur="5.46">April of 2016 it&amp;#39;s obvious that</text>
  <text start="2252.52" dur="4.079">Papadopoulos was using Mifsud to try to</text>
  <text start="2254.65" dur="3.63">get connections even if he&amp;#39;s saying now</text>
  <text start="2256.599" dur="3.96">that he thought he was puffing himself</text>
  <text start="2258.28" dur="4.289">up and from his previous answer he</text>
  <text start="2260.559" dur="4.29">obviously asked him for Russian</text>
  <text start="2262.569" dur="6.29">connections so at the end of this answer</text>
  <text start="2264.849" dur="7.581">he says I had nothing to do with wanting</text>
  <text start="2268.859" dur="6.371">emails finding emails or ever</text>
  <text start="2272.43" dur="6.04">disseminating emails I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="2275.23" dur="5.49">get as far away as possible from this</text>
  <text start="2278.47" dur="4.68">guy Mifsud now he&amp;#39;s talking in</text>
  <text start="2280.72" dur="4.05">retrospect about the time in April he</text>
  <text start="2283.15" dur="4.38">states he wanted to get as far away from</text>
  <text start="2284.77" dur="5.13">Mifsud so I would ask the following</text>
  <text start="2287.53" dur="5.76">questions when did you realize you</text>
  <text start="2289.9" dur="4.709">wanted to get far away and why if you</text>
  <text start="2293.29" dur="2.91">realized it before</text>
  <text start="2294.609" dur="3.96">Broll why did you take another meeting</text>
  <text start="2296.2" dur="4.44">if you realized it afterwards what were</text>
  <text start="2298.569" dur="5.851">you thinking who did you think he was</text>
  <text start="2300.64" dur="5.79">why didn&amp;#39;t you tell anyone about it just</text>
  <text start="2304.42" dur="13.23">questions that I would love the answers</text>
  <text start="2306.43" dur="15.629">to 2409 do you think there was a FISA</text>
  <text start="2317.65" dur="7.139">warrant on you I do I think there was a</text>
  <text start="2322.059" dur="4.23">FISA warrant on me and probably you know</text>
  <text start="2324.789" dur="3.51">most of the listeners are gonna be</text>
  <text start="2326.289" dur="3.96">shocked I think the face I had to do</text>
  <text start="2328.299" dur="4.23">with my work in the energy business and</text>
  <text start="2330.249" dur="3.3">in Israel in particular I don&amp;#39;t I think</text>
  <text start="2332.529" dur="4.411">that&amp;#39;s actually what this is all about</text>
  <text start="2333.549" dur="5.851">including my case I think my case is all</text>
  <text start="2336.94" dur="4.26">about the Obama administration likely</text>

  <text start="2494.68" dur="4.83">sources one from a very influential</text>
  <text start="2497.14" dur="4.29">newspaper in this country and another</text>
  <text start="2499.51" dur="4.02">from one of the largest network TV</text>
  <text start="2501.43" dur="5.88">channels in this country reached out to</text>
  <text start="2503.53" dur="5.58">me on April 12 and April 13 2017 to meet</text>
  <text start="2507.31" dur="3.3">and what did they want to talk about</text>
  <text start="2509.11" dur="3.18">they wanted to tell me that they had</text>
  <text start="2510.61" dur="4.08">information that there was a fire on me</text>
  <text start="2512.29" dur="3.96">now when they told me this I laughed it</text>
  <text start="2514.69" dur="4.35">off because I hadn&amp;#39;t been arrested I</text>
  <text start="2516.25" dur="4.68">hadn&amp;#39;t been embroiled and what I I guess</text>
  <text start="2519.04" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;m in now so I was wondering that</text>
  <text start="2520.93" dur="4.29">myself how could I have a face on me</text>
  <text start="2522.94" dur="3.66">when I don&amp;#39;t know any Russians I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="2525.22" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t know any Russian government</text>
  <text start="2526.6" dur="4.31">officials I mean what could that</text>
  <text start="2527.95" dur="6.8">possibly be and after that that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="2530.91" dur="6.31">you know this weird guy gives me the</text>
  <text start="2534.75" dur="4.3">$10,000 and you know a lot of strange</text>
  <text start="2537.22" dur="4.08">things happen after I was told that and</text>
  <text start="2539.05" dur="3.53">what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s good okay we&amp;#39;re gonna stop</text>
  <text start="2541.3" dur="5.52">there and then we&amp;#39;re gonna get into the</text>
  <text start="2542.58" dur="6.04">$10,000 so Papadopoulos starts talking</text>
  <text start="2546.82" dur="3.09">about the FISA warrant he has on him and</text>
  <text start="2548.62" dur="2.76">we dug into this a little bit yesterday</text>
  <text start="2549.91" dur="3.18">and who it could have been for and who</text>
  <text start="2551.38" dur="3.42">had covered now it seems to me the</text>
  <text start="2553.09" dur="5.58">Papadopoulos is very focused on the</text>
  <text start="2554.8" dur="5.91">energy the energy focus of this entire</text>
  <text start="2558.67" dur="3.48">escapade that he had and an van der</text>
  <text start="2560.71" dur="3.54">steal did a really good job of kind of</text>
  <text start="2562.15" dur="3.78">breaking that down a little bit ago it</text>
  <text start="2564.25" dur="3.21">makes sense what are you saying makes</text>
  <text start="2565.93" dur="4.08">sense it could definitely be that they</text>
  <text start="2567.46" dur="4.56">were using him in terms of some sort of</text>
  <text start="2570.01" dur="7.11">an energy angle rather than the Spygate</text>
  <text start="2572.02" dur="7.08">angle maybe okay but he starts talking</text>
  <text start="2577.12" dur="3.78">about the FISA warrant he says that when</text>
  <text start="2579.1" dur="5.55">the journalist told him he laughed it</text>
  <text start="2580.9" dur="5.82">off the biggest journal the biggest</text>
  <text start="2584.65" dur="4.83">newspaper and the biggest television</text>
  <text start="2586.72" dur="5.75">station tell him we have Intel that you</text>
  <text start="2589.48" dur="5.52">have a FISA warrant on you at some point</text>
  <text start="2592.47" dur="5.35">he&amp;#39;d go on to read in the paper that day</text>
  <text start="2595" dur="4.35">that they had a fight on page also so he</text>
  <text start="2597.82" dur="2.76">says he laughed it off because nothing</text>
  <text start="2599.35" dur="5.22">had happened to him yet</text>
  <text start="2600.58" dur="5.43">I think that&amp;#39;s an odd response but I</text>
  <text start="2604.57" dur="3.81">suppose this is just an opinion</text>
  <text start="2606.01" dur="3.36">statement here that I&amp;#39;m about to make so</text>
  <text start="2608.38" dur="1.71">you see what&amp;#39;s happening in the media</text>

  <text start="3026.16" dur="4.47">Papadopoulos never says what that means</text>
  <text start="3027.93" dur="4.56">that Dan doesn&amp;#39;t ask him then he starts</text>
  <text start="3030.63" dur="4.29">saying he starts talking to Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="3032.49" dur="4.26">about something suspicious Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="3034.92" dur="3.33">never says what that is but make sure</text>
  <text start="3036.75" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s to tell us that he tells him that</text>
  <text start="3038.25" dur="3.84">people are listening then he asks them</text>
  <text start="3040.38" dur="3.93">to go take a picture with someone and he</text>
  <text start="3042.09" dur="4.32">obliges I don&amp;#39;t know about you but if</text>
  <text start="3044.31" dur="3.51">someone were to ask me to randomly go</text>
  <text start="3046.41" dur="4.14">and take a picture with someone I would</text>
  <text start="3047.82" dur="3.9">probably ask why and at this point after</text>
  <text start="3050.55" dur="3.36">being told that there was a fight a</text>
  <text start="3051.72" dur="4.44">warrant on me I&amp;#39;ve been subpoenaed by</text>
  <text start="3053.91" dur="5.76">Congress all of this wacky stuff has</text>
  <text start="3056.16" dur="5.01">been happening I would be a little</text>
  <text start="3059.67" dur="4.11">hesitant to jump into pictures with</text>
  <text start="3061.17" dur="4.02">people then he tells us every single</text>
  <text start="3063.78" dur="2.64">person he&amp;#39;s ever taken a picture with</text>
  <text start="3065.19" dur="3.84">has been some kind of intelligence</text>
  <text start="3066.42" dur="3.96">operative then he goes to Greece and he</text>
  <text start="3069.03" dur="4.05">references going with quote my</text>
  <text start="3070.38" dur="4.77">girlfriend at the time he says that is</text>
  <text start="3073.08" dur="4.89">several times from interviews we pick up</text>
  <text start="3075.15" dur="4.89">that this is Simona but he never says</text>
  <text start="3077.97" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s Simona he&amp;#39;s never asked if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3080.04" dur="3.15">Simona and maybe that&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3081.66" dur="4.52">supposed to know that his girlfriend at</text>
  <text start="3083.19" dur="5.25">the time is his wife now but I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3086.18" dur="4.12">maybe he says my girlfriend at the time</text>
  <text start="3088.44" dur="3.51">because he&amp;#39;s meaning that it&amp;#39;s his wife</text>
  <text start="3090.3" dur="3">and that&amp;#39;s just a frame of reference</text>
  <text start="3091.95" dur="3.45">that he uses and how he says that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3093.3" dur="5.28">possible it&amp;#39;s just a really weird way to</text>
  <text start="3095.4" dur="5.25">say it and it could be a cultural thing</text>
  <text start="3098.58" dur="4.35">so I&amp;#39;m gonna let that go but it&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="3100.65" dur="4.05">he says that several times then he says</text>
  <text start="3102.93" dur="3.06">that he&amp;#39;s being watched and the person</text>
  <text start="3104.7" dur="5.04">that he meets with in Greece thinks his</text>
  <text start="3105.99" dur="5.1">girlfriend is an intelligence asset well</text>
  <text start="3109.74" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s really odd because I thought the</text>
  <text start="3111.09" dur="5.16">same thing his girlfriend at the time</text>
  <text start="3115.23" dur="4.05">Simona</text>
  <text start="3116.25" dur="6.21">man Jonte I hope so otherwise he was</text>
  <text start="3119.28" dur="5.06">cheating on her we&amp;#39;re gonna stop for</text>
  <text start="3122.46" dur="6.63">today and I&amp;#39;m gonna do part two tomorrow</text>
  <text start="3124.34" dur="6.37">but those are pretty basic questions I</text>
  <text start="3129.09" dur="3.21">have after listening to this fantastic</text>
  <text start="3130.71" dur="3.87">interview the damn bungee no game with</text>
  <text start="3132.3" dur="4.86">Papadopoulos I mean we learned more in</text>
  <text start="3134.58" dur="4.2">this one hour I think and opened up more</text>
  <text start="3137.16" dur="2.49">doors than we could have ever hoped to</text>
  <text start="3138.78" dur="3.45">have imagined</text>
  <text start="3139.65" dur="4.5">if he hadn&amp;#39;t interviewed him and for</text>
  <text start="3142.23" dur="3.84">that I&amp;#39;m grateful I would really like to</text>
  <text start="3144.15" dur="3.419">get my hands on Papadopoulos for a frank</text>
  <text start="3146.07" dur="3.81">conversation</text>
