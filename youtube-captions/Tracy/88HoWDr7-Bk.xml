  <text start="70.439" dur="4.86">the story I mean I wrote a piece on the</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="3.331">story that makes a lot of sense I wrote</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="3.96">a piece on the topic which will be</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="3.54">linked in the description box below but</text>

  <text start="80.85" dur="6.659">things in here with you guys before I do</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="5.07">that actually will start the biggest</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="3.75">bombshell that everybody&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="4.85">inside of this lawsuit is basically I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="5.641">find it for you it&amp;#39;s the revelation that</text>
  <text start="93.77" dur="7.18">Ellen Ratner who is the sister of the</text>
  <text start="96.9" dur="5.82">now deceased Michael Ratner Michael</text>
  <text start="100.95" dur="3.57">Ratner was an attorney for WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="3.929">Assange a bunch of other different</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="5.36">people in the whistleblower space he</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="8.97">passed away and Ratner and Buttowski are</text>
  <text start="109.88" dur="8.86">friends and Ratner was overseas and on</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="4.671">her way back in 2016 stopped at the</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="4.909">Embassy to talk with Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="120.29" dur="6.13">Julian Assange allegedly as per Petoskey</text>
  <text start="123.649" dur="5.53">talked to her in the embassy for about</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="6.33">six hours and asked that she take the</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="4.741">information about seth rich and aaron</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="4.65">rich delivering the wig</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="6.3">week&amp;#39;s emails to WikiLeaks back to the</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="6.9">richest parents or you know Joel and</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="6.9">Joel rich to let them know that their</text>
  <text start="144.3" dur="4.47">son was involved in this and they may</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="4.32">that may be helpful information</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="4.48">information to them as they try to find</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="3.05">out who killed their son</text>
  <text start="153.25" dur="5.09">[Music]</text>
  <text start="154.49" dur="6.12">so Ratner didn&amp;#39;t do that she called ed</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="5.04">Buttowski and asked Edie to do it and</text>
  <text start="160.61" dur="4.36">Edie didn&amp;#39;t do it for a couple months</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="4.68">and then decided that now is the time</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="6">and went forward and started talking to</text>
  <text start="168.06" dur="4.83">the rich family shared the information</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="3.84">and so on and so forth</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="4.77">so in this lawsuit where they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="5.61">to explain how it is that ed Buttowski</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="6.84">even contacted the rich family at all</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s advancing that ellen ratner was the</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="3.81">one who dragged him into it</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="5.25">in the first place Alan Ratner is a</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="6.27">White House correspondent for talk media</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="6">news and an analyst for Fox News and she</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="5.249">has not made comments that I&amp;#39;ve seen on</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="4.59">this so far what&amp;#39;s really interesting to</text>
  <text start="199.829" dur="6.091">me that I gathered from our phone call</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="6.36">today is that Buttowski said last week</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="3.9">there was or not last week yeah last</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="4.86">week there was a piece that came out</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="6.24">from Yahoo News written by mr. Spygate</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="5.91">himself Michael Isikoff and Buttowski</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="4.739">told me that he reached out to Isikoff</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="3.329">initially because it appeared to him</text>
  <text start="220.799" dur="4.141">through interviews and stuff that he</text>
  <text start="222.269" dur="4.111">wanted to find the truth and Buttowski</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="4.26">sat on the phone with him explaining to</text>
  <text start="226.38" dur="5.94">him what was going on and the whole</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="5.16">story of how seth rich was really the</text>
  <text start="232.32" dur="6.21">one who took the emails and gave them to</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="6.15">WikiLeaks and izikoff didn&amp;#39;t believe him</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="4.56">and kept saying no it was Russia trying</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="4.65">to push the Russian narrative now to be</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="3.929">quite honest with you after getting this</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="3.81">information and seeing everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="4.681">outlined especially in the suit which</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="7.829">any good journalist would read okay is</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="7.74">Acuff still refused to believe ed</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="4.831">Buttowski so ed Buttowski said to essa&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="5.789">cough please keep this completely off</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="5.67">the record and do not repeat it this is</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="5.821">on this is off the record</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="6.75">he said ellen ratner came to me and told</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="5.16">me that she sat with julian assange and</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="5.85">julian assange asked her to tell the</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="6.419">rich family what was going on it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="279.9" dur="6.359">cough asked him if he could contact</text>
  <text start="282.629" dur="6.331">rettner Buttowski said no this is off</text>
  <text start="286.259" dur="7.321">the record he cannot contact rettner and</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="6.47">izikoff contacted her anyway still came</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="6.929">out with a story about the set the rich</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="8.229">conspiracy theory and also did so</text>
  <text start="300.509" dur="5.25">knowing that the entire russian</text>
  <text start="303.659" dur="4.111">narrative and the IRA and the hacking</text>
  <text start="305.759" dur="3.69">and all of that is falling apart in the</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="4.019">Concord Management case and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="309.449" dur="4.19">show you that now Concord management and</text>
  <text start="311.789" dur="4.56">consulting is one of the firms that</text>
  <text start="313.639" dur="7.5">robert muller charged with inter you</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="6.69">know charged with collusion whatever</text>
  <text start="321.139" dur="3.911">conspiring to defraud the United States</text>
  <text start="323.039" dur="3.63">by impairing the lawful functions of the</text>
  <text start="325.05" dur="3.5">FEC the Department of Justice the</text>
  <text start="326.669" dur="5.071">Department of State blah blah blah and</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="5.589">in the indictment it alleges that the</text>
  <text start="331.74" dur="4.649">defendants and their conspirators</text>
  <text start="334.139" dur="4.291">conducted quote an information warfare</text>
  <text start="336.389" dur="5.911">campaign on social media and at</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="8.22">political rallies to sow discord in this</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="8.25">lawsuit they&amp;#39;re also in this lawsuit in</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="5.519">this indictment they also allege they</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="3.089">don&amp;#39;t allege it in the indictment hold</text>
  <text start="352.169" dur="5.12">on a second let me just make just sure</text>
  <text start="353.639" dur="7.59">this is clear in the report they say</text>
  <text start="357.289" dur="7.24">Muller says that the IRA is linked to</text>
  <text start="361.229" dur="6.24">the Kremlin and the IRA is being charged</text>
  <text start="364.529" dur="5.311">with Concord so the judge is saying that</text>
  <text start="367.469" dur="3.931">they broke a rule by releasing</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="3.299">information to the public that is not</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="5.069">contained inside of the indictment and</text>
  <text start="373.139" dur="5.911">secondly they don&amp;#39;t prove nor can they</text>
  <text start="376.469" dur="5.31">to this point that the IRA and Concord</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="6.06">are linked to the Kremlin so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="381.779" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s tainting if they go to jury trial</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="4.529">its tainting the case so the judge ruled</text>
  <text start="387.509" dur="4.62">you can&amp;#39;t prove it so you can&amp;#39;t say it</text>
  <text start="389.639" dur="3.99">and that&amp;#39;s a massive blow to the entire</text>
  <text start="392.129" dur="2.94">Russian narrative and I&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="393.629" dur="4.29">on a piece on this in the background</text>
  <text start="395.069" dur="5.641">amongst everything else but even knowing</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="4.651">all of that stuff but</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="3.54">Michael Isikoff still went forward and</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="4.23">printed what he printed about the IRA</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="7.35">and everything else and Frank and I did</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="8.61">this big long discussion on this subject</text>
  <text start="411.6" dur="6.72">on the podcast last week and it was it</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="8.16">was telling it was a really good good</text>
  <text start="418.32" dur="8.49">talk so that&amp;#39;s the major bombshell in in</text>
  <text start="423.57" dur="5.07">this amended filing basically one of</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="3.33">them in my opinion there&amp;#39;s other stuff</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="5.55">in there that I think is equally as</text>
  <text start="430.14" dur="6.48">amazing and mind-blowing but the major</text>
  <text start="434.19" dur="3.63">bombshell is that ellen ratner fox news</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="3.45">contributor and white house</text>

  <text start="442.35" dur="8.61">met with met with Assange in the embassy</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="7.38">in in 2016 and Assange apparently told</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="4.29">her that it was Seth riche that gave</text>
  <text start="453.06" dur="4.44">them the information and that she should</text>
  <text start="455.25" dur="5.58">get that information back to the rich</text>

  <text start="515.85" dur="4.68">of the statements and allegations inside</text>
  <text start="518.28" dur="4.59">of this suit one of the things that</text>
  <text start="520.53" dur="5.25">Buttowski makes clear in here is that he</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="4.41">is not aware if the reason that he</text>
  <text start="525.78" dur="3.24">doesn&amp;#39;t have any proof that the reason</text>
  <text start="527.28" dur="3.69">that Seth was killed was because of what</text>
  <text start="529.02" dur="5.879">he did with WikiLeaks but they state</text>

  <text start="794.46" dur="4.65">as a practical matter</text>
  <text start="796.23" dur="4.62">Assange kim.com and WikiLeaks are beyond</text>
  <text start="799.11" dur="3.36">jurist jurisdiction for</text>
  <text start="800.85" dur="3.45">more they have shown that they will not</text>
  <text start="802.47" dur="3.51">be coerced into revealing the identity</text>
  <text start="804.3" dur="3.149">of their sources it&amp;#39;s for that reason</text>
  <text start="805.98" dur="4.2">that I&amp;#39;m asking your client to</text>

  <text start="814.56" dur="3.99">that I think the media and the public</text>
  <text start="816.24" dur="4.32">will find that very interesting there</text>
  <text start="818.55" dur="4.349">was no response the reason why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="820.56" dur="5.19">saying that is if he didn&amp;#39;t provide it</text>
  <text start="822.899" dur="4.771">he should have no problem signing a</text>
  <text start="825.75" dur="3.75">waiver saying hey go ahead release who</text>
  <text start="827.67" dur="4.83">the so you know I have no problem with</text>
  <text start="829.5" dur="5.13">you talking about who this was and it</text>
  <text start="832.5" dur="3.959">would be a moot point to be quite honest</text>
  <text start="834.63" dur="3.149">because if he had nothing to do with it</text>
  <text start="836.459" dur="2.161">his waiver would have nothing you know</text>
  <text start="837.779" dur="4.98">understand what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="838.62" dur="5.73">so basically after there was no response</text>
  <text start="842.759" dur="5.851">a day later Clevenger writes back and</text>
  <text start="844.35" dur="6.45">says as you know on the one hand rich</text>
  <text start="848.61" dur="4.02">boldly denies that he or his brother</text>
  <text start="850.8" dur="4.05">leaked the dancy emails to WikiLeaks on</text>
  <text start="852.63" dur="3.959">the other he refuses to authorize</text>
  <text start="854.85" dur="3.27">disclosures from the witnesses who were</text>
  <text start="856.589" dur="4.381">in the best position to know who leaked</text>
  <text start="858.12" dur="5.01">the emails that begs a question if your</text>
  <text start="860.97" dur="4.71">client has nothing to hide why is he</text>
  <text start="863.13" dur="6.05">hiding it they respond back in a</text>
  <text start="865.68" dur="5.82">five-page letter basically lambasted</text>
  <text start="869.18" dur="4.089">Clevenger and say that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="871.5" dur="4.889">subpoena wikileaks and all these people</text>
  <text start="873.269" dur="7.38">never do any of it that to me is another</text>
  <text start="876.389" dur="7.351">massive piece of this puzzle and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="880.649" dur="6.231">other stuff in here not major major</text>
  <text start="883.74" dur="7.89">stuff other than they accused McCabe</text>

  <text start="891.63" dur="5.309">release of information in the FOIA</text>
  <text start="893.699" dur="5.851">lawsuits like they specifically named</text>

  <text start="899.55" dur="7.529">involved in this and obstruct justice</text>
  <text start="901.139" dur="12.241">basically they also talked about the rod</text>

  <text start="913.38" dur="4.769">Fox News went with the story about rod</text>

  <text start="926.399" dur="5.281">truth day the Fox News was confident</text>
  <text start="928.319" dur="5.541">enough likely because of Ratner to move</text>
  <text start="931.68" dur="5.93">forward with the story and</text>
  <text start="933.86" dur="5.88">and it blew up and everybody keeps</text>
  <text start="937.61" dur="8.849">saying this is just some big conspiracy</text>
  <text start="939.74" dur="8.19">theory we&amp;#39;ll listen he that Clevenger</text>
  <text start="946.459" dur="4.531">and the suit is making some pretty</text>
  <text start="947.93" dur="6.599">pointed claims and pretty pointed fact</text>
  <text start="950.99" dur="5.13">statements and I asked him specifically</text>
  <text start="954.529" dur="5.011">about that I said you know this is a</text>
  <text start="956.12" dur="5.159">really well written complaint not that I</text>

  <text start="961.279" dur="4.531">attorney right but I&amp;#39;ve read hundreds</text>
  <text start="964.16" dur="6.179">and hundreds of complaints and this is a</text>
  <text start="965.81" dur="7.32">really well-done complaint I doubt that</text>
  <text start="970.339" dur="4.831">you would hope you know say any of that</text>
  <text start="973.13" dur="6.149">if you couldn&amp;#39;t prove it and and he</text>
  <text start="975.17" dur="5.7">affirmed for me they are willing to call</text>
  <text start="979.279" dur="5.101">witnesses and provide other evidence</text>
  <text start="980.87" dur="5.61">that proves all of these claims in</text>
  <text start="984.38" dur="5.28">addition to that they have included in</text>
  <text start="986.48" dur="4.77">here William Binney and VIPs and the</text>

  <text start="1117.63" dur="6.3">the NSA that sent everybody really into</text>
  <text start="1121.05" dur="5.79">a tizzy because it the response that the</text>
  <text start="1123.93" dur="6.45">NSA provided to tie Clevenger said that</text>
  <text start="1126.84" dur="6.74">there were 32 responsive records to this</text>
  <text start="1130.38" dur="5.31">FOIA and that they were top-secret and</text>
  <text start="1133.58" dur="3.88">everybody said oh my gosh that means</text>
