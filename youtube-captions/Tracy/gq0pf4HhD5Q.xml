  <text start="0.8" dur="5.41">Merry Christmas and in almost happy new</text>
  <text start="3.629" dur="3.96">year almost I&amp;#39;ve been sitting here</text>
  <text start="6.21" dur="3.57">trying to record this video a few times</text>
  <text start="7.589" dur="4.771">now I&amp;#39;m just going to try and make it as</text>
  <text start="9.78" dur="4.59">brief as I can I was going through</text>
  <text start="12.36" dur="5.7">Twitter and I found a tweet from Donald</text>
  <text start="14.37" dur="6.06">Trump where he basically says something</text>
  <text start="18.06" dur="3.719">regarding what Obama&amp;#39;s last move with</text>
  <text start="20.43" dur="2.519">Putin was and then I was reading the</text>
  <text start="21.779" dur="4.01">replies to the tweet and there were a</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="5.461">bunch of liberals very angry that the</text>
  <text start="25.789" dur="5.5">President of the United States in a few</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="7.559">weeks would speak out in this way</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="10.261">towards Russia because they&amp;#39;re after all</text>
  <text start="35.969" dur="7.201">they hacked our election now the whole</text>
  <text start="41.55" dur="3.57">reason for these sanctions and what</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;ve done is because the Russian</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="4.349">interference in the American electoral</text>
  <text start="47.07" dur="4.62">process which is not grounded in reality</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="5.641">and has never been proven and is</text>
  <text start="51.69" dur="7.74">basically just a way for the globalist</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="6.9">to now try and put the final nail in the</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="4.74">coffin and throw their baby temper</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="5.37">tantrum but what I find really</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="4.8">interesting is the following so the</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="3.5">democrats and obama and the</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="4.469">administration alleges that russia</text>
  <text start="70.88" dur="4.39">hacked into it&amp;#39;s not that they tampered</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="2.97">with our at the results of the election</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="2.52">it&amp;#39;s not that they tampered with the</text>
  <text start="76.409" dur="3">votes that were cast it&amp;#39;s not that they</text>
  <text start="77.79" dur="8.07">tampered with that in any way what they</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="9.811">did was pesky Russians they hacked John</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="4.98">Podesta gmail they hacked the server of</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="3.39">Hillary Clinton which was unsecured in</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="6.84">the basement I mean in a bathroom in her</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="6.509">house and they hacked the DNC and they</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="3.39">provided that information to WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="4.201">who in turn published the information</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="3.9">and therefore damaged Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="4.14">beyond repair in the court of public</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="4.8">opinion which in turn caused people not</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="5.6">to vote for her now WikiLeaks in a very</text>
  <text start="109.77" dur="6.209">unprecedented move has come out and said</text>
  <text start="113.06" dur="4.629">Russia is not our source and they have a</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="3.78">tenured track record of never getting it</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="4.14">wrong and there are people within the</text>
  <text start="119.759" dur="5.701">intelligence community that have come</text>
  <text start="121.829" dur="6.751">out and said it was us it was internal</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="4.529">we released the emails because we had to</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="5.75">stop these horrible people from doing</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="4.341">what they were going to do so</text>
  <text start="134.349" dur="4.39">we have everybody involved pointing</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="4.679">fingers and saying who actually did it</text>
  <text start="138.739" dur="4.89">except the current administration who is</text>
  <text start="142.129" dur="4.291">saying and very aligned with the</text>
  <text start="143.629" dur="4.321">globalists who&amp;#39;s saying no no none of</text>
  <text start="146.42" dur="2.819">the people taking responsibility are</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="4.44">actually the ones who did it was the</text>
  <text start="149.239" dur="6.631">Russians so the Democrats aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="152.39" dur="5.22">disputing the validity of the</text>
  <text start="155.87" dur="5.07">information contained within the lucky</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="4.53">leaks they&amp;#39;re not saying we didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="160.94" dur="3.18">any of this stuff this is all lies</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re not saying the informations</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="3.839">wrong they&amp;#39;re saying that you the</text>
  <text start="166.16" dur="5.909">American people shouldn&amp;#39;t have known</text>
  <text start="167.959" dur="5.851">about it and if you didn&amp;#39;t know about it</text>
  <text start="172.069" dur="3.991">then Hillary Clinton would have won and</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s why Russia medals in the election</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="5.94">even though like I said there&amp;#39;s no basis</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="6.69">in fact so Russia wasn&amp;#39;t responsible for</text>
  <text start="182" dur="3.569">rigging the Democratic primary so that</text>
  <text start="184.19" dur="4.95">Bernie Sanders couldn&amp;#39;t win and the</text>
  <text start="185.569" dur="7.01">outrageous outlandish horrible cheating</text>
  <text start="189.14" dur="5.58">and lying that went on with the process</text>
  <text start="192.579" dur="3.761">Russia is not responsible for</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="3.72">threatening Supreme Court judges over</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="6.89">decisions for colluding and paying the</text>
  <text start="198.44" dur="10.859">media for bribes for pay-for-play for</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="9.36">lying for a public persona and a private</text>
  <text start="209.299" dur="8.131">persona for giving private speeches to</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="6.85">diplomats for taking money for her</text>
  <text start="217.43" dur="4.35">campaign from foreign governments for</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="3.389">running illegal super PACs for any of</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="3.15">the other things that the WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="222.829" dur="6.421">actually showed the Democrats were</text>
  <text start="224.93" dur="7.07">responsible for that and in turn the</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="5.34">American people a majority of them said</text>
  <text start="232" dur="7.989">we can&amp;#39;t have this this is this is no</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="7.53">good so the entire thing is based on a</text>
  <text start="239.989" dur="7.11">farce so that the the liberals who are</text>
  <text start="242.12" dur="6.869">so upset about Russia tampering with the</text>
  <text start="247.099" dur="4.621">election should read the contents of the</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="6.421">WikiLeaks and they should Google uranium</text>
  <text start="251.72" dur="5.46">one because they&amp;#39;re darlings were in bed</text>
  <text start="255.41" dur="4.319">with Russia before they were against</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="6.12">Russia they were for it before they were</text>
  <text start="259.729" dur="7.351">against it Google uranium one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="8.239">what you should do that&amp;#39;s not hypocrisy</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="8.79">and these are the same people who</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="6.521">praised Castro after his death yet</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="11.49">they&amp;#39;re calling Putin a horrible</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="11.699">dictator it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense they</text>
