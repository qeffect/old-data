  <text start="6.56" dur="7.09">hopefully we can get through this video</text>
  <text start="8.49" dur="7.83">without sound issues I wanted to do and</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="6.539">it&amp;#39;s hard because I wanted to do a</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="5.64">Scientology video and I&amp;#39;ve been studying</text>
  <text start="20.189" dur="3.481">and studying and really looking in depth</text>
  <text start="21.96" dur="5.28">at that stuff and it&amp;#39;s so complicated</text>
  <text start="23.67" dur="6.029">and big but I wanted to pull out for you</text>
  <text start="27.24" dur="4.74">guys some of the stuff that really just</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="6.54">piqued my interest in terms of craziness</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="5.73">um so quickly abby&amp;#39;s and I know someone</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="3.871">had sent me on Twitter and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="37.71" dur="4.47">remember the name of the person that</text>
  <text start="40.11" dur="4.199">there is a connection between l ron</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="2.789">hubbard and alistair crowley wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="44.309" dur="3.27">surprised</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="6.421">I saw a print screen of a document that</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="6.061">she sent I&amp;#39;d have to find it before I</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="5.43">talk about that and I will and I will</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="6.09">credit the person that sent it to me so</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="6">I WikiLeaks released a ton of</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="7.62">information on Scientology in 2008 I</text>
  <text start="62.82" dur="8.159">believe and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s internal documents</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="5.43">from within the organization so this</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="3.331">isn&amp;#39;t an attack on a religion or</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="3.3">anything like that this is just</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="4.559">basically reading out what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="76.08" dur="4.679">shared and I&amp;#39;m gonna add some commentary</text>
  <text start="78.869" dur="3.721">but I know undoubtedly people will say</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="4.231">well you&amp;#39;re just reading well nobody</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="3.9">else has read this or not many people</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="2.76">have read it and if they have they</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="3.059">haven&amp;#39;t talked about it so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="3.21">dedicating the time to do so because I</text>
  <text start="89.549" dur="8.101">feel like it&amp;#39;s interesting and</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="9.24">newsworthy and there you go so let me</text>
  <text start="97.65" dur="6.2">just start by doing a brief beliefs</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="5.669">background this is from Wikipedia</text>
  <text start="103.85" dur="4.15">Scientology teaches that people are</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="4.921">immortal spiritual beings who have</text>
  <text start="108" dur="4.71">forgotten their true nature Scientology</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="3.8">central mythology developed around the</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="4.71">original notion of the seaton in</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="4.68">Scientology the thetan is the individual</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="4.979">expression of stata</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="6.099">described as the comics cosmic source</text>
  <text start="122.399" dur="5.73">and life force the satan is the true</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="5.461">human identity rendering humans as pure</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="4.901">spirit and godlike the religions</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="5.26">mythology holds the belief</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="5.91">that in the premortal past primordial</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="5.3">past Seaton&amp;#39;s applied their creative</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="4.65">abilities to form the physical universe</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="3.97">contrary to the biblical narrative that</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="4.83">shows that the universe was created by a</text>
  <text start="145.36" dur="4.709">divine soul creat creator Scientology</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="4.47">holds that the universe was created by</text>
  <text start="150.069" dur="8.581">the Seita in the form of individualized</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="8.849">expressions there is a method of</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="6.03">spiritual rehabilitation in a type of</text>
  <text start="161.739" dur="4.741">counseling known as auditing in which</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="3.42">practitioners aim to consciously</text>
  <text start="166.48" dur="4.02">re-experience painful or traumatic</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="5.419">events in their past in order to free</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="5.79">themselves of their limiting effects</text>
  <text start="173.519" dur="4.481">study materials and auditing courses are</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="4.88">made available to members and returned</text>
  <text start="178" dur="5.489">in return for specified donations</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="4.39">Scientology is legally recognized as a</text>
  <text start="183.489" dur="4.321">tax-exempt religion in the United States</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="4.259">and other countries and the Church of</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="3.99">Scientology emphasizes this as proof</text>
  <text start="189.819" dur="5.101">that it&amp;#39;s a bona fide religion this</text>
  <text start="191.8" dur="5.61">wasn&amp;#39;t always the case and there I have</text>
  <text start="194.92" dur="6.51">another detailed subset of this to do in</text>
  <text start="197.41" dur="6.15">regards to what happened with operation</text>
  <text start="201.43" dur="7.38">snow white where basically was one of</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="7.08">the largest infiltrations of the United</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="3.6">States government and the world actually</text>
  <text start="210.64" dur="3.81">like lots of institutions around the</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="4.59">world were infiltrated by Scientologists</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="4.44">because the IRS was basically targeting</text>
  <text start="217" dur="3.299">Scientology and the Scientologists</text>
  <text start="218.89" dur="2.67">didn&amp;#39;t like that very much so they</text>
  <text start="220.299" dur="4.47">literally went undercover and</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="5.61">infiltrated the IRS the CIA all kinds of</text>
  <text start="224.769" dur="5.401">stuff crazy eventually they were</text>
  <text start="227.17" dur="5.159">recognized as tax-exempt and I know</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s more to this so if you guys want</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="3.181">to chime in in the comments about it</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="4.29">please do but I just want to show you</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="6.39">how complicated this stuff really is and</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="9.9">it really is they have a dictionary of</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="8.13">terms such as auditor and tech and all</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="4.079">these different you know all of these</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="3.329">different meanings for words than what</text>
  <text start="251.769" dur="3.631">we usually use them for and there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="253.359" dur="5.041">huge dictionary six hundred sixty two</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="4.49">pages long of all these things so as I</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="4.65">was reading through some of this</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="4.839">information and material I had to refer</text>
  <text start="263.05" dur="3.26">back to this dictionary quite a few</text>
  <text start="264.729" dur="5.571">times to understand</text>
  <text start="266.31" dur="6">what they were talking about and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.38">really interesting is I&amp;#39;m trying to do</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="9.21">this with less tabs this time ah what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="11.81">really interesting is that there is some</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="4.97">marketing material that came out</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="9.13">basically this person received whoever</text>
  <text start="294.84" dur="6.329">did this leak received some marketing</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="7.799">from Scientology the Church of</text>
  <text start="301.169" dur="8.461">Scientology and goes through what it is</text>
  <text start="305.669" dur="5.641">and they write this um letter first the</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="3.99">document contains scans of three</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="4.109">brochures describing various packages of</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="3.15">Scientology books tapes and services</text>
  <text start="315.419" dur="5.22">which can be purchased from the church</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="5.1">all of them are dated at 2007 at least</text>
  <text start="320.639" dur="4.741">some of them are part of the Golden Age</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="4.56">of knowledge campaign the Golden Age of</text>
  <text start="325.38" dur="2.88">knowledge is another attempt by</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="3.78">Scientology to address the trouble that</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="3.84">many Scientologists have completing</text>
  <text start="330.21" dur="4.01">their courses and training it is a</text>
  <text start="332.1" dur="5.37">strongly held doctrine of the church</text>
  <text start="334.22" dur="6.34">that all Hubbard tech must be delivered</text>
  <text start="337.47" dur="5.94">and tech is knowledge information must</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="4.53">be delivered or administered exactly in</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="3.45">the form that Hubbard created it which</text>
  <text start="345.09" dur="4.05">in fact in effect means that all</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="4.59">manuscripts bulletins policy letters and</text>
  <text start="349.14" dur="4.95">recordings should be preserved in their</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="5.46">original form auditors who use the tech</text>
  <text start="354.09" dur="4.829">must not omit reinterpret or improvise</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="4.37">any part of it either and an auditor is</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="5.37">someone who&amp;#39;s basically indoctrinating</text>
  <text start="361.28" dur="5.62">the subject into the beliefs of</text>
  <text start="364.289" dur="4.651">Scientology and their own in you know</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="3.69">self introspection about wiping</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="3.78">themselves clean that it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="7.37">indoctrination of the highest order I</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="7.62">mean it just is it just is anyway</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="4.81">auditors who use the tech must not omit</text>
  <text start="380.34" dur="4.59">reinterpret or improvise any parts of it</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="3.959">either any deviation from its original</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="3.75">source form will prevent those who</text>
  <text start="386.729" dur="3.871">practice it from enjoying its benefits</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="3.63">in other words if you don&amp;#39;t become</text>
  <text start="390.6" dur="3.87">smarter feel healthier or develop</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="4.69">superpowers it&amp;#39;s not because the tech is</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="4.36">faulty it was just misapplied</text>
  <text start="397" dur="4.2">if you&amp;#39;re under having trouble</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="4.41">understanding a given piece of subject</text>
  <text start="401.2" dur="4.71">matter it&amp;#39;s probably because of a</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="4.14">misunderstood word you should and what</text>
  <text start="405.91" dur="4.26">did I say in the beginning right guys</text>
  <text start="407.38" dur="4.08">you should stop look up the definition</text>
  <text start="410.17" dur="3.36">and be sure you understand it fully</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="3.78">before moving on there are several</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="3.18">dictionaries and glossary of terms that</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="3.33">Scientologists are supposed to use for</text>
  <text start="416.71" dur="4.29">this person purpose in the course of</text>
  <text start="418.57" dur="4.26">their studies but apparently a large</text>
  <text start="421" dur="3.45">number of Scientologists we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="3.99">having trouble moving along the bridge</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="4.08">even though they looked up every</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="4.11">misunderstood word they could find in</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="4.95">reality this confusion works to the</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="4.65">science to Scientology&amp;#39;s advantage the</text>
  <text start="433.48" dur="4.92">more trouble people have with the tech</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="5.79">the more special handling they need</text>
  <text start="438.4" dur="4.71">auditing and the more fee Scientology</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="3.68">can charge and the more excuses they</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="4.32">have to get you to disconnect from</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="4.45">suppressive people who may be holding</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="3.84">you back but there comes a point when</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="3.81">even the most brainwash cultist might</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="3.84">become suspicious so the church had to</text>
  <text start="453.31" dur="4.86">explain these failures without losing</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="5.07">face and here are some of the brochures</text>
  <text start="458.17" dur="8.52">four thousand nine hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="460.18" dur="9.06">dollars for the full set then we have</text>
  <text start="466.69" dur="3.93">the basics acceleration package for four</text>
  <text start="469.24" dur="3.66">thousand two hundred and sixty eight</text>
  <text start="470.62" dur="4.77">dollars and twenty five cents and it</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="4.11">explains what this stuff is and so you</text>
  <text start="475.39" dur="2.97">know it&amp;#39;s a good it&amp;#39;s a good amount it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="3.3">a nice chunk of change if you want to</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="3.06">get started in the Church of Scientology</text>
  <text start="480.31" dur="4.86">and if you&amp;#39;re in the search of</text>
  <text start="481.42" dur="5.91">Scientology you&amp;#39;re spending big big</text>
  <text start="485.17" dur="2.93">bucks to move your way up the ladder big</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="2.79">bucks</text>
  <text start="488.1" dur="5.44">so another thing that I thought was</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="5.34">super interesting in this dump that I</text>
  <text start="493.54" dur="9.53">was looking through is their public</text>

  <text start="506.44" dur="9.71">internal memo that they released about</text>
  <text start="508.39" dur="11.58">how to handle the press and it is it is</text>
  <text start="516.15" dur="6.34">evil and manipulative and scary</text>
  <text start="519.97" dur="4.08">I mean I&amp;#39;m gonna read a couple of the</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="5.13">points in here that really just made me</text>

  <text start="1363.33" dur="4.86">help is actually in Jurists they often</text>
  <text start="1365.549" dur="6.151">seek transfers or wish to leave so if</text>
  <text start="1368.19" dur="6.119">you want to leave your psychotic do you</text>

  <text start="1374.309" dur="3.12">warfare with conflicts around them which</text>
  <text start="1375.87" dur="3.33">are invisible to others one wonders how</text>
