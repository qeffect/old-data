  <text start="0.03" dur="6.78">good evening it is 743 p.m. eastern time</text>
  <text start="3.12" dur="6.269">at on Tuesday May 22nd 2018</text>
  <text start="6.81" dur="3.63">ok so we&amp;#39;ve had a crazy week so far lots</text>
  <text start="9.389" dur="5.281">of news today</text>
  <text start="10.44" dur="7.53">absolutely stunning information so much</text>
  <text start="14.67" dur="5.519">I want to focus first on this Caputo</text>
  <text start="17.97" dur="3.69">interview from tonight if you guys were</text>
  <text start="20.189" dur="4.201">watching a couple weeks ago I did a</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="4.89">video talking about how his interviews</text>
  <text start="24.39" dur="4.77">that he did across the circuit were just</text>
  <text start="26.55" dur="5.52">very strange I told you that he had to</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="5.73">come to on Fox News to on CNN the CNN</text>
  <text start="32.07" dur="5.82">news interviews were for 20-30 minutes</text>
  <text start="34.89" dur="5.66">long and the Fox interviews were about 5</text>
  <text start="37.89" dur="5.79">minutes long just didn&amp;#39;t strike me</text>
  <text start="40.55" dur="4.9">didn&amp;#39;t sit right with me I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="4.649">really pinpoint why he kind of</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="5.129">disappeared and then today boom here he</text>
  <text start="48.329" dur="4.201">is again I want to go through this</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="3.631">entire interview with you guys I know it</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="3.119">might be a little bit redundant because</text>
  <text start="54.21" dur="3">you probably already heard it but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="3.84">really important that we listen to this</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="6.839">very carefully and I&amp;#39;m gonna show you</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="9.24">why I&amp;#39;m very very very suspicious of</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="7.291">what&amp;#39;s happening here off we go what</text>
  <text start="68.729" dur="4.111">about multiple informants that have</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="2.88">penetrated the Trump campaign in the</text>
  <text start="72.84" dur="4.139">fall of 2016</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="4.35">if it sounds incredible just hear the</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="3.721">reasoning behind this former trunk</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="3.63">campaign aide of course queried by</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="3.709">government authorities Michael Caputo</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="4.349">back with us Michael good to have you</text>
  <text start="84.409" dur="3.791">thanks for inviting me again yell so</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="5.491">you&amp;#39;re convinced there were more than</text>
  <text start="88.2" dur="6.09">just at least one individual absolutely</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="4.2">mostly because I was approached as well</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="4.74">but this time I I mean that what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="4.91">remarkable here to my approaches that</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="5.699">happened in the first week of May in</text>
  <text start="101.15" dur="5.59">2016 very far off the timeline that the</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="3.511">Muller investigation and others are</text>
  <text start="106.74" dur="3.629">trying to hold to as to when the</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="8.729">investigation into the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="8.881">actually began so okay what did he just</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="6">say that just is weird let&amp;#39;s listen very</text>
  <text start="119.25" dur="5.7">closely 27 off the timeline that the</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="3.481">Muller investigation and others are</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="3.66">trying to hold to as to when the</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="4.95">investigation into the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="4.8">actually began what does he mean there I</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="3.9">know it sounds like I&amp;#39;m nitpicking</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="5.07">I understand but there&amp;#39;s a reason for</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="4.68">this what does he mean very far before</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="3.69">the timeline that the Muller</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="6.3">investigation and others are trying to</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="8.6">hold as to when the investigation into</text>
  <text start="146.28" dur="7.17">the Trump team began what does that mean</text>
  <text start="150.77" dur="5.44">2016 we&amp;#39;re very far off the timeline</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="4.41">that the Muller investigation and others</text>
  <text start="156.21" dur="3.78">are trying to hold to as to when the</text>
  <text start="157.86" dur="4.35">investigation into the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="159.99" dur="4.35">actually began what is he talking about</text>
  <text start="162.21" dur="4.62">there I know I know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m nitpicking</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s a reason I don&amp;#39;t understand what</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="5.31">he means what is he talking about does</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="6">he does he mean does he mean when the</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="6.54">Russians tried to collude with the Trump</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="5.43">campaign or does he mean that it just</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="3.03">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense like could he be</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="3.66">saying that Muller is investigating when</text>
  <text start="181.71" dur="7.95">the intrusions into the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="8.13">started very weird it&amp;#39;s just a very</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="3.78">weird way to say it maybe it&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="3.96">but I don&amp;#39;t think so given the rest of</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="4.019">the interview let&amp;#39;s listen so when you</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="3.75">say May of 2016 what happened the</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="5.671">discovery of someone penetrating the</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="6.39">campaign or what actually I was</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="5.91">approached by an intermediary but who</text>
  <text start="205.83" dur="5.52">had been talking to a government</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="5.43">official of former government official</text>
  <text start="211.35" dur="5.82">who told him that they had Hillary</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="4.739">Clinton related emails at the at that</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="3.93">government organization and that they</text>
  <text start="219.209" dur="4.681">wanted to get them to the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="5.639">this was May 6 that he heard that and</text>
  <text start="223.89" dur="5.16">2016 I was told by the intermediary on</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="6.931">May 9th that they wanted to get them to</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="6.9">me so what he&amp;#39;s saying is that he was</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="4.11">dealing with an intermediary who was</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="4.89">dealing with someone who worked at a</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="7.47">government organization who told the</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="8.25">intermediary on May 6th of 2016 that he</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="10.38">had Clinton related emails and then the</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="8.579">intermediary told Caputo on May 9th this</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="5.13">conversation continued back-and-forth</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="5.281">for several days I was in Trump Tower at</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="3.99">the time whenever I got a call from the</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="3.24">intermediary I would walk outside of the</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="3.27">office I spent a lot of time</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="5.19">hallway outside of the fifth floor</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="4.98">office talking to this intermediary so</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="3.39">now we&amp;#39;ve established that he&amp;#39;s had a</text>
  <text start="273" dur="4.62">ton of conversations with this</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="5.28">intermediary lots of them he spent a lot</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="4.71">of time in the hallway outside of the</text>
  <text start="280.05" dur="9.72">rest of the campaign talking to this</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="10.26">intermediary in Trump Tower yes sir all</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="4.91">right so you&amp;#39;re a top campaign aide at</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="5.04">the time at this time in the spring of</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="6.55">2016 this intermediary what what is it</text>
  <text start="297.63" dur="6.06">intermediary mean it&amp;#39;s a friend of mine</text>
  <text start="301.23" dur="4.38">who is willing to go on the record at</text>
  <text start="303.69" dur="3.6">the right time I know we&amp;#39;re trying as</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="3.93">you know here on your show to be</text>
  <text start="307.29" dur="4.53">cautious about names of people and</text>
  <text start="309.54" dur="4.92">organizations but he wants to be on the</text>
  <text start="311.82" dur="4.56">record he&amp;#39;s willing to talk to Fox and</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="3.57">he and I were both kind of amazed that</text>
  <text start="316.38" dur="3.3">we were getting this kind of a contact</text>
  <text start="318.03" dur="3.66">from a government organization coming</text>
  <text start="319.68" dur="4.38">from who was talking to the intermediary</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="5.4">or what type of from what government</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="6.09">agency what could you say I can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="4.98">the names of government agency right but</text>
  <text start="330.15" dur="4.14">it was a former contractor for that</text>
  <text start="332.07" dur="5.73">agency who said that actual staff</text>
  <text start="334.29" dur="5.94">members of the agency had Hillary</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="4.05">Clinton&amp;#39;s related emails we believe that</text>
  <text start="340.23" dur="4.11">to mean at the time you remember that</text>
  <text start="341.85" dur="5.37">early in May Hillary Clinton had</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="4.77">revealed that she had deleted 30,000</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="5.91">emails and we had we believe that meant</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.68">that they had those 30,000 email hold on</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="5.789">a second</text>
  <text start="353.79" dur="8.4">so May of 2016 was when Clinton&amp;#39;s emails</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="6.271">were the IG report I guess came out</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="5.55">about the handling of the server and all</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="4.17">of that and and towards the end of May</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="2.69">they started talking about the deleted</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="3.99">emails</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="4.41">did he wear this this conversations</text>
  <text start="373.35" dur="7.04">happening in the beginning of May and</text>
  <text start="374.84" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;m trying to find the very first</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="5.2">reporting of that so that I can show it</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="5.91">to you can they even went to Cheryl</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="6.03">Atkinson&amp;#39;s timeline here because she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="5.82">got amazing time line and tried to find</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="7.62">anything in May of 2016 that referenced</text>
  <text start="395.7" dur="6.12">Hillary&amp;#39;s emails I don&amp;#39;t see anything</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="4.38">time line doesn&amp;#39;t sit right with me I</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="3.87">didn&amp;#39;t want to sit on this report and</text>
  <text start="404.28" dur="3.75">getting this out because I feel like</text>
  <text start="405.69" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ll get more information within the</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="3.72">next 24 to 48 hours and I needed this</text>
  <text start="410.16" dur="3.51">initial line of thinking to be out for</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="2.22">you guys that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m doing this right</text>
  <text start="413.67" dur="3.27">now</text>
  <text start="413.97" dur="5.61">let&amp;#39;s keep listening by the time the</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="4.29">16th of May came around I came to the</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="3.99">conclusion that I did not want to take</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="5.04">possession of these emails I thought</text>
  <text start="423.57" dur="5.37">they might be classified documents and I</text>
  <text start="426.27" dur="4.35">urged through the intermediary that the</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="3.45">people at the government organization do</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="4.44">it through a proper whistleblower</text>
  <text start="432.39" dur="5.04">process I never revealed this</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="4.29">conversation to anyone at the Trump</text>
  <text start="437.43" dur="5.61">campaign I was uncomfortable talking</text>
  <text start="439.35" dur="5.06">about it and I broke off contact with</text>
  <text start="443.04" dur="3.42">that government organization</text>
  <text start="444.41" dur="4.66">representative but you knew back then</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="5.07">that someone from the outside wanted to</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.73">connect with someone on the inside of</text>
  <text start="451.53" dur="5.88">the Trump campaign beginning with you</text>
  <text start="453.8" dur="5.98">that&amp;#39;s right and you know I left the</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="4.26">campaign on June 20th that same person</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="3.66">the former contractor for the government</text>
  <text start="461.67" dur="4.5">organization reached back out to the</text>
  <text start="463.44" dur="5.75">intermediary again at the end of July</text>
  <text start="466.17" dur="5.52">truck hold on a second</text>
  <text start="469.19" dur="4.2">so we basically worked for the campaign</text>
  <text start="471.69" dur="4.5">for a little over a month</text>
  <text start="473.39" dur="4.78">he was the communications director so</text>
  <text start="476.19" dur="8.19">when Caputo says top campaign aide</text>
  <text start="478.17" dur="7.68">unlike a June 20th that same person the</text>
  <text start="484.38" dur="3.27">former contractor for the government</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="4.53">organization reached back out to the</text>
  <text start="487.65" dur="5.28">intermediary again at the end of July</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="6.3">trying to get him interested again in</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="6.09">those emails but he again refused to</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="6.06">work with him on it what so what</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="6.69">happened then as per Caputo is after</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;d already left the Trump campaign he</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="4.83">I guess maintained contact with his</text>
  <text start="507.54" dur="8.22">intermediary the intermediary told him</text>
  <text start="510.54" dur="7.41">that in July the government source from</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="4.92">whatever government agency approached</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="5.22">him again trying to get the intermediary</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="5.01">to take possession of this Clinton</text>
  <text start="523.17" dur="3.96">related material what really disturbed</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="5.04">me at the time</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="5.16">Neel is it you know I you know I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="530.73" dur="3">want to be involved in bringing</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="3.03">this kind of information I thought it</text>
  <text start="533.73" dur="3.599">made me look kind of kooky on the first</text>
  <text start="535.32" dur="3.509">week when I came into the campaign to</text>
  <text start="537.329" dur="3.721">tell them I had access to Hillary</text>
  <text start="538.829" dur="4.5">Clinton&amp;#39;s deleted emails and then it</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="4.32">became very frightening for me I thought</text>
  <text start="543.329" dur="3.87">that it was you know it could be a crime</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="5.94">for me to take them into my own custody</text>
  <text start="547.199" dur="5.76">what later on I was I was I gave this</text>
  <text start="551.31" dur="4.17">information to the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="552.959" dur="4.05">Committee I gave this information for</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="3.96">the Senate Intelligence Committee two</text>
  <text start="557.009" dur="4.741">weeks ago and I gave this information to</text>
  <text start="559.44" dur="4.709">the Muller team and they never reached</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="9.99">out to the intermediary to check on it</text>
  <text start="564.149" dur="9.661">okay now he&amp;#39;s saying right here that he</text>
  <text start="571.74" dur="5.31">provided this stuff to the committee&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="5.91">have read every last bit of information</text>
  <text start="577.05" dur="7.289">to come out of these things there is not</text>
  <text start="579.72" dur="8.669">even a mention of this anywhere anywhere</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="6.69">not a mention of it now you&amp;#39;d think that</text>
  <text start="588.389" dur="4.32">if this were true if if and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="591.029" dur="4.23">doubting him I&amp;#39;m just saying if if</text>
  <text start="592.709" dur="5.011">Caputo did testify before let&amp;#39;s pretend</text>
  <text start="595.259" dur="4.02">the Senate Intelligence Committee or the</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="4.229">House Intelligence Committee which</text>
  <text start="599.279" dur="4.67">already issued their report which we</text>
  <text start="601.949" dur="5.07">went over if he would have testified</text>
  <text start="603.949" dur="5.471">that somebody approached him trying to</text>
  <text start="607.019" dur="5.281">get him information about Hillary</text>
  <text start="609.42" dur="4.469">Clinton&amp;#39;s emails don&amp;#39;t you think that</text>
  <text start="612.3" dur="4.74">they would have used that claim to</text>
  <text start="613.889" dur="5.82">buttress the whole you know collusion</text>
  <text start="617.04" dur="5.849">narrative or you guys are traveling down</text>
  <text start="619.709" dur="5.19">the path of thinking with me here or did</text>
  <text start="622.889" dur="5.371">they not use it because he mentioned</text>
  <text start="624.899" dur="5.31">that it was a government source who was</text>
  <text start="628.26" dur="3.48">giving them to him and they just refused</text>
  <text start="630.209" dur="4.68">to acknowledge that because it then</text>

  <text start="780.72" dur="5.729">there&amp;#39;s so much you can surmise from</text>

  <text start="1038.4" dur="4.32">for a really long time that the Podesta</text>
  <text start="1040.83" dur="3.78">emails did not come from the Russians I</text>
  <text start="1042.72" dur="3.57">think it&amp;#39;s pretty clear now I mean even</text>
  <text start="1044.61" dur="5.78">more so than what we proved about the</text>
  <text start="1046.29" dur="4.1">the memo the other day but</text>
  <text start="1051.1" dur="5.97">but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s stop for a second the</text>
  <text start="1055.03" dur="4.32">interview basically ends after that okay</text>
  <text start="1057.07" dur="3.84">I want to show you what he said a couple</text>
  <text start="1059.35" dur="3.24">weeks ago when he was out on the</text>
  <text start="1060.91" dur="3.24">talkshow circuit</text>
  <text start="1062.59" dur="3.66">sounds like a New Yorker for a second</text>
  <text start="1064.15" dur="5.01">there on the tour on the talk show</text>
  <text start="1066.25" dur="4.98">circuit complaining and saying how he</text>
  <text start="1069.16" dur="3.629">was going broke and looking for sympathy</text>
  <text start="1071.23" dur="3.99">he just made an appearance all of a</text>
  <text start="1072.789" dur="4.531">sudden he was all over the media for</text>
  <text start="1075.22" dur="4.05">everybody feeling bad for him you know</text>
  <text start="1077.32" dur="3.75">talking about how scared he was how he</text>
  <text start="1079.27" dur="4.769">couldn&amp;#39;t really talk very much but I</text>
  <text start="1081.07" dur="5.16">Annette I analyzed this and how scripted</text>
  <text start="1084.039" dur="4.14">he was and how weird it was it was just</text>
  <text start="1086.23" dur="3.24">weird and I didn&amp;#39;t have any reason for</text>
  <text start="1088.179" dur="3.271">it and everyone in the comments was like</text>
  <text start="1089.47" dur="3.9">why are you saying this now I understand</text>
  <text start="1091.45" dur="3.93">a little more why I flagged me in my gut</text>
  <text start="1093.37" dur="4.95">let&amp;#39;s listen to what he says about</text>
  <text start="1095.38" dur="5.94">WikiLeaks here let&amp;#39;s listen in this</text>
  <text start="1098.32" dur="5.91">email I mean in this some in this</text>
  <text start="1101.32" dur="4.739">interview he talks about the Muller</text>
  <text start="1104.23" dur="5.01">investigation and he talks about</text>
  <text start="1106.059" dur="5.581">WikiLeaks and in the interview you just</text>
  <text start="1109.24" dur="4.049">saw with Cavuto he says that Muller</text>
  <text start="1111.64" dur="3.87">wasn&amp;#39;t even interested in hearing about</text>
  <text start="1113.289" dur="3.841">what he had to say about those emails or</text>
  <text start="1115.51" dur="4.5">whatever it was he was trying to be</text>
  <text start="1117.13" dur="8.789">given so that contradicts very strongly</text>
  <text start="1120.01" dur="8.34">with what he&amp;#39;s saying here more about</text>
  <text start="1125.919" dur="4.851">the campaign than you detector a target</text>
  <text start="1128.35" dur="4.559">and afterward then that didn&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="1130.77" dur="3.909">but I think they were looking for an</text>
  <text start="1132.909" dur="4.351">opportunity to make me a subject in this</text>
  <text start="1134.679" dur="4.831">thing but at the same time now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1137.26" dur="4.08">talking about WikiLeaks and DC leaks and</text>

  <text start="1141.34" dur="10.65">still very easy news they knew more</text>
  <text start="1144.13" dur="9.57">about the camp okay there&amp;#39;s one he only</text>
  <text start="1151.99" dur="3.03">asked me about Russian collusion it</text>
  <text start="1153.7" dur="4.469">seemed to me very much that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1155.02" dur="5.46">still focused on it he talked about you</text>
  <text start="1158.169" dur="5.581">know the WikiLeaks and the VC leaks and</text>
  <text start="1160.48" dur="5.01">the and the goose&amp;#39; first stuff and they</text>

  <text start="1165.49" dur="3.9">can I ask were there specific people</text>
  <text start="1167.799" dur="3.12">they were asking you about because I</text>
  <text start="1169.39" dur="2.94">spoke to Sam Nunn Berg after he was</text>

  <text start="1235.82" dur="6.51">ignore you when you told them that you</text>
  <text start="1238.159" dur="7.11">had gotten WikiLeaks emails in May now</text>
  <text start="1242.33" dur="6.209">they could be ignoring that because they</text>

  <text start="1248.539" dur="3.031">because he&amp;#39;s not running a good you know</text>

  <text start="1261.009" dur="7.02">like what now I have to go back to</text>
  <text start="1264.679" dur="4.74">before the election on November 1st of</text>
  <text start="1268.029" dur="4.08">2016</text>
  <text start="1269.419" dur="6.06">everybody thought this was a kooky crazy</text>
  <text start="1272.109" dur="5.591">conspiracy theory at the time and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1275.479" dur="6.33">turned out to be absolutely true I</text>
  <text start="1277.7" dur="8.549">wanted you to listen to this again on</text>
  <text start="1281.809" dur="8.271">November 1 2016 Hillary and Bill Clinton</text>
  <text start="1286.249" dur="8.16">and their entourage of assistants</text>
  <text start="1290.08" dur="6.459">effected a civilian coup in contrast to</text>
  <text start="1294.409" dur="4.23">the usual concept of a coup where the</text>
  <text start="1296.539" dur="4.26">military is involved and takes over the</text>
  <text start="1298.639" dur="4.561">White House and communication centers</text>
  <text start="1300.799" dur="5.31">very much like the scenarios you see in</text>
  <text start="1303.2" dur="5.39">a movie this coup was done silently and</text>
  <text start="1306.109" dur="5.611">very effectively through two methods</text>
  <text start="1308.59" dur="5.079">corruption and co-optation the Clintons</text>
  <text start="1311.72" dur="6.27">have been involved in co-opting our</text>
  <text start="1313.669" dur="7.201">White House our judiciary our sea</text>
  <text start="1317.99" dur="5.49">a our Federal Bureau of Investigation</text>

  <text start="1326.15" dur="4.62">some time now what they&amp;#39;ve done is to</text>
  <text start="1328.58" dur="4.32">make sure that they were part and parcel</text>
  <text start="1330.77" dur="5.27">of a group of people who were</text>
  <text start="1332.9" dur="7.89">interrelated through political cronyism</text>
  <text start="1336.04" dur="6.94">however in order to stop this coup we in</text>
  <text start="1340.79" dur="4.62">the intelligence community and others</text>
  <text start="1342.98" dur="5.37">involved have informally gotten together</text>
  <text start="1345.41" dur="4.98">and with their permission I am beginning</text>
  <text start="1348.35" dur="5.67">to announce that we&amp;#39;ve initiated a</text>
  <text start="1350.39" dur="6.39">counter-coup through Julian Assange and</text>
  <text start="1354.02" dur="7.14">WikiLeaks what has happened in effect</text>
  <text start="1356.78" dur="7.77">when Co me had to open up the case of</text>
  <text start="1361.16" dur="6.149">Hillary Clinton and discuss the emails</text>
  <text start="1364.55" dur="5.879">that were involved with the Anthony</text>
  <text start="1367.309" dur="5.191">Weiner case it was not the case itself</text>
  <text start="1370.429" dur="4.981">that was as important as the fact that</text>
  <text start="1372.5" dur="5.13">this was the entree for many of us in</text>
  <text start="1375.41" dur="5.07">the counter coup to say to the</text>
  <text start="1377.63" dur="4.71">administration we have your number not</text>
  <text start="1380.48" dur="4.32">only do we have your number we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1382.34" dur="4.65">to stop you from making Hillary the</text>
  <text start="1384.8" dur="5.52">president of the United States and at</text>
  <text start="1386.99" dur="5.33">the same time we will convict and indict</text>
  <text start="1390.32" dur="4.65">the President of the United States</text>
  <text start="1392.32" dur="5.08">Loretta Lynch and many others who were</text>
  <text start="1394.97" dur="3.839">involved in the cover-up of the massive</text>
  <text start="1397.4" dur="3.92">corruption that occurred under the</text>
  <text start="1398.809" dur="6.091">Clinton Foundation now in both cases</text>
  <text start="1401.32" dur="7.39">their COO was silent in our count dooku</text>
  <text start="1404.9" dur="6.659">was silent and it was all a transgressed</text>
  <text start="1408.71" dur="4.89">or occurred on the Internet and this is</text>
  <text start="1411.559" dur="4.591">probably the first time in the history</text>
  <text start="1413.6" dur="5.25">of any country where a coup was</text>
  <text start="1416.15" dur="4.529">initiated on through the internet and a</text>
  <text start="1418.85" dur="4.56">counter-coup was initiated through the</text>
  <text start="1420.679" dur="4.741">internet I am just a small part of</text>
  <text start="1423.41" dur="4.41">something far bigger than myself</text>
  <text start="1425.42" dur="5.94">it was the brave men and women who were</text>
  <text start="1427.82" dur="6.78">in the FBI the CIA the director of</text>
  <text start="1431.36" dur="6.3">intelligence the military intelligence</text>
  <text start="1434.6" dur="5.19">and men and women in 15 other</text>
  <text start="1437.66" dur="4.71">intelligence organizations who were sick</text>
  <text start="1439.79" dur="3.63">and tired of seeing this corruption in</text>
  <text start="1442.37" dur="3.57">the White House and the Justice</text>
  <text start="1443.42" dur="4.77">Department and an intelligence system</text>
  <text start="1445.94" dur="3.93">and we decided that there was something</text>
  <text start="1448.19" dur="2.34">we had to do in order to save the</text>
  <text start="1449.87" dur="3.84">Republic</text>
  <text start="1450.53" dur="6.78">so we initiated a counter-coup through</text>
  <text start="1453.71" dur="7.65">Julian massage who&amp;#39;s been very brave and</text>
  <text start="1457.31" dur="6.9">really quite formidable in his and his</text>
  <text start="1461.36" dur="6.06">ability to come forth and provide all</text>
  <text start="1464.21" dur="5.91">the necessary emails that we gave to him</text>
  <text start="1467.42" dur="5.82">in order to undermine Hillary and Bill</text>
  <text start="1470.12" dur="5.61">Clinton again America we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1473.24" dur="4.56">through a major major transition and</text>
  <text start="1475.73" dur="5.19">quite frankly a second American</text>
  <text start="1477.8" dur="5.4">Revolution we do not have guns we do not</text>
  <text start="1480.92" dur="4.38">have weapons we do not have intend to</text>
  <text start="1483.2" dur="5.55">kill anybody we do not intend to harm</text>
  <text start="1485.3" dur="5.97">anybody but we the American public and</text>
  <text start="1488.75" dur="5.31">those of us who serve at veterans and in</text>
  <text start="1491.27" dur="5.85">an intelligence service like myself will</text>
  <text start="1494.06" dur="6.18">stop the Clintons from assuming power</text>
  <text start="1497.12" dur="5.51">that they don&amp;#39;t deserve at the same time</text>
  <text start="1500.24" dur="8.04">we will make certain that Obama leaves</text>
  <text start="1502.63" dur="8.98">without any trail of a pardon or any</text>
  <text start="1508.28" dur="5.88">other act of treason in effect we want a</text>
  <text start="1511.61" dur="5.87">peaceful transition in this great</text>

  <text start="1538.37" dur="6.78">sleep and breathe this stuff as I do now</text>
  <text start="1541.61" dur="7.29">it was so shocking to me so amazing to</text>
  <text start="1545.15" dur="5.97">hear this that it made me take pause so</text>
  <text start="1548.9" dur="5.67">we know now from if what Steve Botanic</text>
  <text start="1551.12" dur="6.99">is saying is true the emails went to</text>
  <text start="1554.57" dur="5.01">WikiLeaks from people inside of military</text>
  <text start="1558.11" dur="5.1">intelligence inside of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1559.58" dur="9.18">community etc so why would those people</text>
  <text start="1563.21" dur="8.55">I think what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is</text>
  <text start="1568.76" dur="8.49">basically it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense that it</text>
  <text start="1571.76" dur="7.2">would be black hats going to Caputo with</text>
  <text start="1577.25" dur="3.36">that information it just doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1578.96" dur="3.36">sense it would be black hats going to</text>
  <text start="1580.61" dur="3.6">him with it if it showed up in the</text>
  <text start="1582.32" dur="3.6">WikiLeaks emails later on</text>
  <text start="1584.21" dur="3.33">it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense that it would be a</text>
  <text start="1585.92" dur="4.77">black hat bringing it to him because</text>
  <text start="1587.54" dur="5.61">that information was deadly to Hillary</text>
  <text start="1590.69" dur="4.89">Clinton in terms of you know public</text>
  <text start="1593.15" dur="4.5">opinion and otherwise so it was a good</text>
  <text start="1595.58" dur="4.98">guy that brought that stuff if if it was</text>
  <text start="1597.65" dur="5.97">brought and if he&amp;#39;s telling the truth so</text>

  <text start="1603.62" dur="8.66">on our side or is he not it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
