  <text start="22.859" dur="4.891">you why we need to be careful because</text>
  <text start="24.89" dur="4.059">lord I know it&amp;#39;s so hard to trust</text>
  <text start="27.75" dur="2.97">anybody right now</text>
  <text start="28.949" dur="4.321">you don&amp;#39;t know what the hell they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="30.72" dur="5.12">capable of with all the leaks coming out</text>
  <text start="33.27" dur="7.109">nobody knows who the heck to trust it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="35.84" dur="6.7">it&amp;#39;s insane and I believe that me and</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="5.971">spangle vision were the first people to</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="6.199">debunk this but we held it because of</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="4.77">reasons that I swear I will get into</text>
  <text start="48.739" dur="5.201">there&amp;#39;s been some crazy stuff going on</text>
  <text start="51.12" dur="5.91">behind the scenes but with all that</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="7.189">being said this is from the Benison</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="6.27">Strategy Group they are directly tied to</text>
  <text start="61.129" dur="3.761">the WikiLeaks they&amp;#39;re all through the</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="2.999">WikiLeaks that the guy that runs the</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="3.479">companies and the WikiLeaks everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.299" dur="4.531">in the WikiLeaks the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="4.891">logos on here and this was done between</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="4.41">the 10th and the 13th and it looks</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="3.96">really legitimate right I mean this is</text>
  <text start="75.24" dur="4.62">definitely possible reading through it</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.469">I&amp;#39;m like wow this is pretty pretty cool</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="5.46">like you know let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s keep reading</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="8.401">and as I was reading this I started to</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="7.95">say to myself hold on a second looks</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="7.86">good looks good looks good looks good</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="9.33">then they started bringing this up looks</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="6.809">ok still right but then we get here and</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="4.35">I started reading it and I&amp;#39;m like wow</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="3.331">this could be a false flag for sure</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="11.12">what event they could pull for a</text>
  <text start="113.55" dur="8.82">false-flag and then I saw this now look</text>
  <text start="119.21" dur="7.24">and this isn&amp;#39;t the proof I&amp;#39;m using to</text>
  <text start="122.37" dur="6.27">debunk this but if you&amp;#39;re on the phone</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="4.59">with a pollster and you&amp;#39;re one of those</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="4.86">2,000 people are you gonna answer this</text>
  <text start="131.04" dur="4.83">question if they ask it to you</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.62">legitimately think to yourself if a</text>
  <text start="135.87" dur="4.89">pollster on the phone said which of</text>
  <text start="138.12" dur="6.36">these is most was most likely to stop</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="4.71">you from voting shooting warn</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="4.08">neighborhood okay</text>
  <text start="145.47" dur="6.56">maybe external invading force attacked</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="6.32">by extraterrestrials biblical event</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="6.36">would you would you say to yourself oh</text>
  <text start="154.88" dur="7.03">yeah definitely an alien invasion</text>
  <text start="158.39" dur="8.38">probably probably not and then it goes</text>
  <text start="161.91" dur="6.84">down and you know looks legit&amp;#39; again but</text>
  <text start="166.77" dur="10.29">then they start getting into the Zeke</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="9.93">apocalypse Sharia escalation unnatural</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="3.99">disaster and then they bring up this</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="5.07">machine now these things have been in</text>
  <text start="181.05" dur="4.62">conspiracy circles they have been looked</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="6.739">at people know about these programs that</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="9.63">exist but they&amp;#39;re telling you that</text>
  <text start="190.489" dur="9.491">they&amp;#39;re literally going to project 3d</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="10.47">alien craft into the sky to stop the</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="7.53">election and while like I said right now</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="6.54">it could be possible for anything to</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="7.29">happen this is quite unlikely this can</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="5.16">be used it comes out people share the</text>
  <text start="214.8" dur="5.7">heck out of it people are saying that</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="5.43">this was from WikiLeaks and and you know</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="6.06">I got the the comment Oh everybody</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="5.22">missed this trust me folks a it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.11">from WikiLeaks because WikiLeaks has</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="4.92">only released documents and emails</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="3.93">through March of this year and this was</text>
  <text start="233.04" dur="3">done just recently this month right</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s what it says on the date here</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="6.3">October 10 through 13</text>
  <text start="238.05" dur="7.87">well WikiLeaks doesn&amp;#39;t have stuff that</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="5.2">recent that they&amp;#39;ve released so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s just ridiculous it&amp;#39;s being used</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="4.74">to discredit WikiLeaks you guys have to</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="5.49">be so careful and I understand I do but</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="4.32">you know just some quick investigative</text>
  <text start="254.77" dur="4.05">work on this found something interesting</text>
  <text start="256.6" dur="4.47">and I&amp;#39;m gonna say again spangle vision</text>
  <text start="258.82" dur="3.599">you don&amp;#39;t follow his channel you follow</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="3.569">his channel right now because he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="323.09" dur="3.06">stuff like that but if you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="324.349" dur="3.061">discredit an entire group of people who</text>
  <text start="326.15" dur="3.18">are depending on WikiLeaks for</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="6.72">information and then you&amp;#39;re saying these</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="8.01">things came from WikiLeaks come on just</text>

  <text start="359.69" dur="4.289">view of things you know what I mean so I</text>
  <text start="362.599" dur="3.63">look for the state&amp;#39;s view of things</text>
