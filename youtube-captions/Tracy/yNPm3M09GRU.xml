  <text start="163.95" dur="5.52">able to get it done that fell apart and</text>
  <text start="166.819" dur="8.471">Don Jr I believe was working on that one</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="10.139">and then in 2015 incomes none other than</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="8.13">Felix aider again intelligence asset</text>
  <text start="179.609" dur="5.91">overt emails in the podcast yesterday we</text>

  <text start="185.519" dur="3.78">in and testify in front of the</text>
  <text start="187.049" dur="4.5">Intelligence Committee or I think it was</text>
  <text start="189.299" dur="4.261">the same committee that was that Cohen</text>
  <text start="191.549" dur="4.291">spoke in front of I think it was the I</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t know if the top of my head but I</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="4.259">he was scheduled to go in there after</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="5.339">Cohen and the day of Cohen&amp;#39;s hearing</text>
  <text start="200.099" dur="5.07">they spent all of this time saying how</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="5.58">Felix aider was a corrupt Russian</text>
  <text start="205.169" dur="6.271">mobster that he was a you know a crime</text>
  <text start="208.319" dur="6.39">boss working for Russia all kinds of</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="5.159">stuff and they were unable to</text>
  <text start="214.709" dur="6.06">well not unable to but they didn&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="216.599" dur="7.38">him in for questioning because he was I</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="5.55">guess they didn&amp;#39;t want the opposition</text>
  <text start="223.979" dur="4.801">side the Republicans to be able to</text>
  <text start="226.319" dur="4.14">question him on all of his connections</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="3.929">to US intelligence which he blew the</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="6.84">whistle on in the midst of all this</text>
  <text start="232.709" dur="6.39">craziness I&amp;#39;ve gone over our Seder quite</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="3.84">a bit on my channel for those of you who</text>
  <text start="239.099" dur="6.301">don&amp;#39;t know Felix seder is a lifelong</text>
  <text start="241.139" dur="5.371">friend of Michael Cohen&amp;#39;s they met when</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="5.28">they were younger</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="6.689">Felix Seder worked for the the</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="3.6">Department of Justice they covered for a</text>
  <text start="253.199" dur="3.301">bunch of crimes that he committed</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="4.28">Loretta Lynch was asked about Felix</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="4.47">aider in her confirmation questions and</text>
  <text start="258.56" dur="4.78">she was the US Attorney at the time that</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="4.919">all of the cover-up sort of happened so</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="4.18">she was responsible for basically</text>
  <text start="265.889" dur="3.28">allowing feel</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="3.78">sader to skate without going to jail and</text>
  <text start="269.169" dur="6.451">without having to pay restitution at</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="6.119">some point in 2017 Sater came out and</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="3.69">did an interview where he kind of let</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="3.571">the ball the cat of the bag that he had</text>
  <text start="279.31" dur="4.079">worked for the United States and an</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="4.32">intelligence capacity as an asset for</text>
  <text start="283.389" dur="4.641">several years was responsible for some</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="5.039">very very high-level information</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="6.25">traveling between the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="290.349" dur="5.371">and terrorists satellite phones nuclear</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="5.52">weapons I mean it was high-level stuff</text>
  <text start="295.72" dur="7.259">as per Seder so the Democrats in that</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="5.25">hearing tend to and then again here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="4.171">another one another intelligence asset</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="6.989">that somehow connected to the periphery</text>
  <text start="307.15" dur="7.71">and is sending over to jizz like our boy</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="5.1">Putin Putin can get our boy elected to</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="6.179">Michael Cohen Michael Cohen worked on</text>
  <text start="317.139" dur="6.421">this deal with sader which never</text>
  <text start="321.039" dur="7.651">ultimately became a deal and Cohen</text>
  <text start="323.56" dur="6.93">dropped so Donald Trump is basically</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="4.14">saying they&amp;#39;re trying to pin him on this</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="4.26">like saying he lied about something in</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="4.559">business and a letter of intent is not a</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="5.4">deal there&amp;#39;s no money exchanging hands</text>
  <text start="337.389" dur="4.921">there&amp;#39;s just negotiations and okay yes</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="3.569">we intend to move forward to try and get</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="3.51">this project done but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="343.719" dur="4.801">commitment that it will be done it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="8.55">just how you start off exploring a</text>
  <text start="348.52" dur="7.679">business deal on page 2 to 33 of the</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="4.609">report Muller states that the Russian</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="5.731">government told the press two days after</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="5.111">he had won the election that they had</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="5.7">contacts with Trump&amp;#39;s immediate</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="5.759">entourage during the campaign but if you</text>
  <text start="367.63" dur="4.98">remember when we talked about volume one</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="7.611">emails and texts obtained by the special</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="7.679">counsel directly they contradict that</text>
  <text start="377.46" dur="4.06">in other words hope Hicks and Jared</text>
  <text start="380.289" dur="2.701">Kushner we talked about had</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="2.97">correspondence indicating that they</text>
  <text start="382.99" dur="3.179">couldn&amp;#39;t even verify if contacts</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="3.419">emailing them were from the Russian</text>
  <text start="386.169" dur="4.05">government at all and then they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.909" dur="4.29">even speak to Putin at all until five</text>
  <text start="390.219" dur="5.401">days after the election they had no idea</text>
  <text start="392.199" dur="5.491">who the heck to get in touch with which</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="5.9">one is it your report contradicts itself</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="3.83">it sort of reminds me of the</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="10.1">of the dossier the discredited dossier</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="4.58">the opposition research I should say</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="7.54">both of these things can&amp;#39;t be true if as</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="3.85">indicated by hope Hicks and Jared</text>
  <text start="420.7" dur="3.39">Kushner&amp;#39;s messages to one another and</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m saying that as a</text>
  <text start="424.09" dur="3.45">statement of fact not because Muller has</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="3.66">it in the report but because they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="427.54" dur="5.31">text messages to back it up and they use</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="5.28">them at this point in time if if those</text>
  <text start="432.85" dur="3.24">things happen and Kirchner was like I</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t even know who the name of the</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="3.57">Russian ambassador and Hook Hicks is</text>
  <text start="438.46" dur="2.61">getting emails from people saying</text>
  <text start="439.66" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re in the Russian government and</text>
  <text start="441.07" dur="2.58">she has no idea who they are and they</text>
  <text start="442.48" dur="2.7">can&amp;#39;t figure it out and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="443.65" dur="4.59">to vet these people who are sending them</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="4.739">information and I&amp;#39;m sorry emails to get</text>
  <text start="448.24" dur="2.91">in touch with them they&amp;#39;re trying to vet</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="5.071">them they&amp;#39;re trying to find out if</text>
  <text start="451.15" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re real but Putin comes out or</text>
  <text start="454.99" dur="6.66">Russia Russian officials come out and</text>
  <text start="457.27" dur="6.42">say that they had a two days later</text>
  <text start="461.65" dur="3.15">Russians told the press the press the</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="2.52">Russian government had maintained</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="7.86">contacts with Trump&amp;#39;s immediate</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="7.709">entourage during the campaign and then</text>
  <text start="472.66" dur="2.67">hope picks comes out and gives a</text>
  <text start="473.919" dur="3.511">statement about that and says it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="5.13">true at the time because it wasn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="477.43" dur="5.52">Mahler proved it in section one so this</text>
  <text start="480.46" dur="7.47">is the thing this is why I I just get</text>
  <text start="482.95" dur="6.99">frustrated this is important on page 238</text>
  <text start="487.93" dur="3.96">of the report it&amp;#39;s talking about the</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="3.15">Flynn calls to kiss Lacan it states that</text>
  <text start="491.89" dur="3.87">members of the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="493.09" dur="5.579">were surprised that Russia didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="495.76" dur="5.25">retaliate well and they were surprised</text>
  <text start="498.669" dur="6.541">that Russia didn&amp;#39;t retaliate against the</text>
  <text start="501.01" dur="7.53">United States for issuing the sanctions</text>
  <text start="505.21" dur="4.82">they expected retaliation so because of</text>
  <text start="508.54" dur="4.2">that what the report says is that</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="6.129">analysts were looking further into why</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="5.13">Russia didn&amp;#39;t it well this is odd how</text>
  <text start="516.159" dur="10.001">come Russia didn&amp;#39;t do anything back to</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="12.35">us huh they use that as their excuse</text>
  <text start="526.16" dur="7.15">for finding general Flint&amp;#39;s call with</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="6.15">kiss lyac I think that&amp;#39;s very convenient</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="6.18">and most likely completely untrue and</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you why right now they</text>
  <text start="539.49" dur="4.349">state that they previously had an</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="5.76">investigation open into Flynn and that</text>
  <text start="543.839" dur="5.37">those calls that he made to kiss lyac</text>
  <text start="546.93" dur="6.12">after Trump is elected and during the</text>
  <text start="549.209" dur="6.75">transition period Trump Flynn makes two</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="5.58">calls to ambassador kis lyac one about</text>
  <text start="555.959" dur="7.741">the sanctions and other business as per</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="6.899">the special counsel and another call and</text>
  <text start="563.7" dur="6.02">I don&amp;#39;t remember exactly what that one</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="4.191">was about pardon me for that</text>
  <text start="571.22" dur="9.01">so McCord is stating that they had a</text>
  <text start="576.839" dur="6.511">previously an investigation open</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="11.16">previously and that these two calls</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="10.77">became a key component of the</text>
  <text start="591.39" dur="5.22">investigation the investigation they had</text>
  <text start="594.12" dur="7.62">opened previously is the one with a</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="9.21">Russian or a a scholar and author here</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="11.19">she is vet lana likova they say that vet</text>
  <text start="605.82" dur="9.57">lana likova was basically a Russian</text>
  <text start="612.93" dur="5.19">intelligence person who was trying to</text>
  <text start="615.39" dur="6.53">honeypot general Flynn at a dinner set</text>
  <text start="618.12" dur="7.469">up in 2015 I believe by none other than</text>
  <text start="621.92" dur="5.74">Stephan helper and that&amp;#39;s what they were</text>
  <text start="625.589" dur="4.531">trying to use to take down general Flynn</text>
  <text start="627.66" dur="8.72">the fact then that then and Svetlana has</text>
  <text start="630.12" dur="9.36">come out and said that that this is all</text>
  <text start="636.38" dur="7.18">untrue and that she&amp;#39;s been smeared and</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="6.479">that she&amp;#39;s been you know all kinds of</text>
  <text start="643.56" dur="7.139">stuff and she&amp;#39;s being very vocal right</text>
  <text start="645.959" dur="6.87">now about that you see and she just</text>
  <text start="650.699" dur="4.321">followed me and I followed her back so I</text>
  <text start="652.829" dur="3.391">will be reaching out to her to talk to</text>
  <text start="655.02" dur="2.66">her about her story and see what I can</text>
  <text start="656.22" dur="3.76">find out</text>
  <text start="657.68" dur="5.009">and so that was the that was the</text>

  <text start="762.86" dur="4.649">because as we talked about in the Friday</text>
  <text start="764.72" dur="4.38">video there were a gazillion leaks to</text>
  <text start="767.509" dur="2.52">the media in this special council</text>
  <text start="769.1" dur="5.219">investigation</text>
  <text start="770.029" dur="5.941">lots of them lots of them I also noted</text>
  <text start="774.319" dur="3">here once I figured out how I could take</text>
  <text start="775.97" dur="5.219">the print screen and get it to transfer</text>
  <text start="777.319" dur="7.14">over that Chris Christie was interviewed</text>
  <text start="781.189" dur="4.921">on the 13th of February 2019 I thought</text>
  <text start="784.459" dur="3.031">that was interesting that it was so late</text>
  <text start="786.11" dur="4.19">in the game that they interviewed</text>
  <text start="787.49" dur="4.82">Christie so late in the game and why</text>
  <text start="790.3" dur="4.65">heeey I didn&amp;#39;t like what they said about</text>
  <text start="792.31" dur="4.32">Christie&amp;#39;s testimony he was kind of</text>
  <text start="794.95" dur="3.2">stupid about it he was I mean I guess he</text>
  <text start="796.63" dur="5.61">was telling the truth</text>
  <text start="798.15" dur="6.37">apparently this Chris Christie tells</text>
  <text start="802.24" dur="5.28">them that the the the president asked if</text>
  <text start="804.52" dur="5.94">Christie could reach out to James Comey</text>
  <text start="807.52" dur="6.27">and kind of give him a pat on the back</text>
  <text start="810.46" dur="4.95">and say hey we really like you and Comey</text>
  <text start="813.79" dur="4.95">thought and Christie says he thought it</text>
  <text start="815.41" dur="5.46">was ridiculous now I&amp;#39;m starting to learn</text>
  <text start="818.74" dur="5.46">why Chris Christie never got into the</text>
  <text start="820.87" dur="6.54">administration and also you know think</text>
  <text start="824.2" dur="5.97">about this this entire thing just from a</text>
  <text start="827.41" dur="6.84">tonality and vibe standpoint makes out</text>
  <text start="830.17" dur="6.39">the president to be some idiot bumbling</text>
  <text start="834.25" dur="3.6">fool who has no idea what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="836.56" dur="2.73">doesn&amp;#39;t know what he should and</text>

  <text start="839.29" dur="6">tactful and what&amp;#39;s not has no idea how</text>
  <text start="842.08" dur="5.19">to portray you know what he shouldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="845.29" dur="5.1">what lines he shouldn&amp;#39;t cross just a</text>
  <text start="847.27" dur="5.61">just an idiot and it&amp;#39;s just completely</text>
  <text start="850.39" dur="4.71">ridiculous and untrue and we know that</text>
  <text start="852.88" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s untrue for several reasons one of</text>
  <text start="855.1" dur="10.77">which I&amp;#39;ll get to in a second but here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="857.11" dur="11.64">one of them it appears as though hope</text>
  <text start="865.87" dur="4.83">Hicks is confirming that Priebus like to</text>
  <text start="868.75" dur="3.48">leak and they&amp;#39;re talking about this in</text>
  <text start="870.7" dur="2.97">here and there they&amp;#39;re basically said I</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="4.17">never got to tweet the last thing I was</text>
  <text start="873.67" dur="6.51">gonna say sorry I just remembered it</text>
  <text start="876.4" dur="6.45">appears as though this is during the</text>
  <text start="880.18" dur="5.25">Trump Tower meeting with Don jr. and</text>
  <text start="882.85" dur="5.1">vessel nets kya and all those guys and</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="4.29">again the report fails to mention the</text>
  <text start="887.95" dur="4.62">connections between vessel nets kya and</text>
  <text start="889.72" dur="4.71">anyone that that really should be</text>
  <text start="892.57" dur="3.6">focused on in talking about this but we</text>
  <text start="894.43" dur="5.82">know it&amp;#39;s just a political hack job at</text>
  <text start="896.17" dur="6.78">this point so basically there were</text>
  <text start="900.25" dur="4.86">emails Don jr. ended up releasing those</text>
  <text start="902.95" dur="4.8">emails they were talking about how to</text>
  <text start="905.11" dur="4.05">handle the emails Trump didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="907.75" dur="3.12">see President Trump didn&amp;#39;t want to see</text>

  <text start="926.73" dur="2.789">of mind</text>
  <text start="927.33" dur="3.99">so that&amp;#39;s the way they kept it but hope</text>
  <text start="929.519" dur="3.711">Hicks was trying and he and and also</text>
  <text start="931.32" dur="4.019">President Trump was like convinced</text>
  <text start="933.23" dur="3.46">supposedly that these emails wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="935.339" dur="7.231">leak and that they&amp;#39;d be able to protect</text>
  <text start="936.69" dur="8.04">stuff right here it says a short while</text>
  <text start="942.57" dur="3.6">later while still on Air Force One Hicks</text>
  <text start="944.73" dur="3.39">learned the Priebus knew about the</text>
  <text start="946.17" dur="3.45">emails with which further convinced her</text>
  <text start="948.12" dur="4.26">that additional information about the</text>
  <text start="949.62" dur="4.23">June 9th meeting would leak and the</text>
  <text start="952.38" dur="5.76">White House should be proactive and get</text>
  <text start="953.85" dur="7.229">in front of the story now she&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="958.14" dur="5.37">insinuating that Priebus is a leaker and</text>

  <text start="963.51" dur="4.47">certainly going to leak it out or the</text>
  <text start="965.97" dur="3.929">fact that he did get the information</text>
  <text start="967.98" dur="3.479">means that somebody&amp;#39;s leaking that they</text>

  <text start="971.459" dur="3.781">it there is one thing that I learned in</text>

  <text start="1258.11" dur="9.37">maybe maybe because he was there maybe</text>
  <text start="1264.93" dur="4.8">because he didn&amp;#39;t have a reason to lie</text>
  <text start="1267.48" dur="3.81">maybe because a lot of the other things</text>
  <text start="1269.73" dur="3.66">in the interview that he said have been</text>
  <text start="1271.29" dur="3.77">corroborated in terms of the privileged</text>
  <text start="1273.39" dur="5.01">questions and all kinds of other things</text>
  <text start="1275.06" dur="6.87">but there is an assertion in this report</text>
  <text start="1278.4" dur="5.88">that Trump kind of like turned into a</text>
  <text start="1281.93" dur="4.09">had a temper tantrum and started cursing</text>
  <text start="1284.28" dur="6.03">it when he found out about the special</text>
  <text start="1286.02" dur="5.43">counsel and it asserts that more people</text>
  <text start="1290.31" dur="4.71">knew about the special counsel</text>
  <text start="1291.45" dur="6.93">appointments then what Dowd said to York</text>
  <text start="1295.02" dur="4.86">dad said to York that only one person or</text>
  <text start="1298.38" dur="2.76">two people were aware that there was</text>
  <text start="1299.88" dur="7.14">going to be a special counsel appointed</text>
  <text start="1301.14" dur="8.82">and that would be James Comey and rod</text>
  <text start="1307.02" dur="4.95">Rosenstein this report asserts that</text>
  <text start="1309.96" dur="4.68">there were more people that knew it also</text>
  <text start="1311.97" dur="7.08">asserts it John Dowd talks in his</text>
  <text start="1314.64" dur="6.81">interview about how only one person I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1319.05" dur="3.75">sorry John Dowd also talks in his</text>
  <text start="1321.45" dur="4.65">interview about how</text>
  <text start="1322.8" dur="5.88">sessions immediately offered his</text>
  <text start="1326.1" dur="4.11">resignation because he didn&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="1328.68" dur="3.54">the special council being appointed it</text>
  <text start="1330.21" dur="4.05">details an interaction where someone</text>
  <text start="1332.22" dur="3.9">went to rod Rosen Stein&amp;#39;s office and</text>
  <text start="1334.26" dur="3.18">complained and said what are you doing</text>
  <text start="1336.12" dur="3.87">man and he was afraid they were gonna</text>
  <text start="1337.44" dur="5.16">fire him you think that&amp;#39;s all made up I</text>
  <text start="1339.99" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t think so and as a matter of fact</text>
  <text start="1342.6" dur="4.56">Dowd was so adamant about it he went on</text>
  <text start="1344.91" dur="5.81">fox and said so and you if you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1347.16" dur="5.91">remember the Trump campaign or the Trump</text>
  <text start="1350.72" dur="3.52">the White House I&amp;#39;m trying to do two</text>
  <text start="1353.07" dur="3.6">things at once and that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="1354.24" dur="5.82">here my apologies the White House came</text>
  <text start="1356.67" dur="5.91">out and said by the way don&amp;#39;t trust any</text>
  <text start="1360.06" dur="4.89">of these so-called notes that may have</text>
  <text start="1362.58" dur="4.23">been written after the fact and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1364.95" dur="4.53">starting to wonder if we had a huge</text>
  <text start="1366.81" dur="4.71">massive leak problem or a setup or a</text>
  <text start="1369.48" dur="4.59">sting coming out of the White House</text>
  <text start="1371.52" dur="4.53">Counsel Don McGann because I would be</text>
  <text start="1374.07" dur="4.68">much more apt to believe Dowd than I</text>
  <text start="1376.05" dur="3.9">would be to believe him again and you</text>
  <text start="1378.75" dur="3.3">know there were all these Press reports</text>
  <text start="1379.95" dur="3.63">that he wants to fire Muller he wants to</text>
  <text start="1382.05" dur="4.14">fire Muller and they all centered around</text>
  <text start="1383.58" dur="4.14">Don Magan who wanted to leave and then</text>
  <text start="1386.19" dur="4.68">he didn&amp;#39;t leave and he stayed on it was</text>
  <text start="1387.72" dur="7.17">just a nightmare listen to this closely</text>
  <text start="1390.87" dur="6.87">I believe Dowd when did President Trump</text>
  <text start="1394.89" dur="4.74">say hey go out there and fire a molar he</text>
  <text start="1397.74" dur="4.83">never did you know I was there at the</text>
  <text start="1399.63" dur="6.63">same time that that the report says that</text>
  <text start="1402.57" dur="6.03">you know McGee and mentioned this and I</text>
  <text start="1406.26" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t was I was I was assigned to deal</text>
  <text start="1408.6" dur="4.29">with Muller and i briefed the president</text>
  <text start="1410.67" dur="5.85">every day and every week I saw a mother</text>
  <text start="1412.89" dur="5.67">or a Quarles for eight months great at</text>
  <text start="1416.52" dur="4.26">no time did the president ever say you</text>
  <text start="1418.56" dur="4.08">know John I&amp;#39;m gonna get rid of him John</text>
  <text start="1420.78" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s not going to do it it was just the</text>
  <text start="1422.64" dur="4.47">opposite here&amp;#39;s the message the</text>
  <text start="1424.5" dur="5.55">president had for Bob Mahler to me to</text>
  <text start="1427.11" dur="3.83">carry one you tell him I respect what</text>
  <text start="1430.05" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="1430.94" dur="5.23">number two you tell him he&amp;#39;s got my full</text>
  <text start="1433.41" dur="6.09">cooperation number three get it done as</text>
  <text start="1436.17" dur="7.17">quickly as possible and number at number</text>
  <text start="1439.5" dur="6.45">four whatever else you need yeah let me</text>
  <text start="1443.34" dur="4.71">know so that was always the message and</text>
  <text start="1445.95" dur="5.99">that&amp;#39;s exactly what we did and as you</text>
  <text start="1448.05" dur="6.759">know we produced everything without a</text>
  <text start="1451.94" dur="4.729">document missing sure not a lie</text>
  <text start="1454.809" dur="3.99">you imagine in Washington something that</text>
  <text start="1456.669" dur="6.07">a lot</text>
  <text start="1458.799" dur="6.521">there&amp;#39;s more there&amp;#39;s more yeah let me</text>
  <text start="1462.739" dur="4.68">know so that was always the message and</text>
  <text start="1465.32" dur="5.959">that&amp;#39;s exactly what we did and as you</text>
  <text start="1467.419" dur="6.81">know we produced everything without a</text>
  <text start="1471.279" dur="4.541">document miss ain&amp;#39;t sure about a lie can</text>
  <text start="1474.229" dur="4.17">you imagine it Washington something</text>
  <text start="1475.82" dur="3.929">about a lie but of course that was</text>
  <text start="1478.399" dur="3.27">behind the scenes the president on</text>
  <text start="1479.749" dur="3.691">Twitter and stuff was referring to it as</text>
  <text start="1481.669" dur="3.3">a witch-hunt so but that is separate</text>
  <text start="1483.44" dur="4.619">that&amp;#39;s right and I talked to Bob about</text>
  <text start="1484.969" dur="4.95">that and I said you understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1488.059" dur="3.72">when he saw I was political he has to do</text>
  <text start="1489.919" dur="3.81">that for political reasons right</text>
  <text start="1491.779" dur="3.09">and he said one time it early on he says</text>
  <text start="1493.729" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s one thing I&amp;#39;m worried about I</text>
  <text start="1494.869" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t want to scare off witnesses I said</text>
  <text start="1498.019" dur="4.16">well I&amp;#39;ll tell you what the president</text>
  <text start="1499.909" dur="5.671">and I will make sure we&amp;#39;ll say publicly</text>
  <text start="1502.179" dur="6.37">cooperate with Bob Moore and we did</text>
  <text start="1505.58" dur="6.36">early on so that was it I just I think</text>
  <text start="1508.549" dur="6.57">there was a misunderstanding with we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1511.94" dur="5.549">done McGann people forget it was</text>
  <text start="1515.119" dur="4.62">Rosenstein that ambushed the president</text>
  <text start="1517.489" dur="4.29">with the appointment of Mahler hmm so</text>
  <text start="1519.739" dur="4.951">the president never had a chance to</text>
  <text start="1521.779" dur="4.86">think about it having vetted are you</text>
  <text start="1524.69" dur="4.14">talking about the suggestion from the</text>
  <text start="1526.639" dur="5.28">report that Don McGee and the</text>
  <text start="1528.83" dur="6">president&amp;#39;s attorney was told they&amp;#39;d go</text>
  <text start="1531.919" dur="5.07">out and fire him yes that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1534.83" dur="4.559">report and I just don&amp;#39;t believe it</text>
  <text start="1536.989" dur="5.64">Amy now the president simply wanted</text>
  <text start="1539.389" dur="4.86">McGann to call Rosenstein and have him</text>
  <text start="1542.629" dur="3.811">vetted because the president believed</text>
  <text start="1544.249" dur="4.89">that Mahler did have some conflicts</text>
  <text start="1546.44" dur="4.559">whether he did or not the president has</text>
  <text start="1549.139" dur="3.811">the number one law enforcement officer</text>
  <text start="1550.999" dur="4.23">was entitled to ask Rosenstein to do</text>
  <text start="1552.95" dur="5.309">that yes is White House Counsel to do it</text>
  <text start="1555.229" dur="4.8">John real quick on a scale of one to ten</text>
  <text start="1558.259" dur="4.74">when you look at the mower report what</text>
  <text start="1560.029" dur="5.46">do you give it oh it&amp;#39;s an F complete F I</text>
  <text start="1562.999" dur="4.951">used to have a strike force iran cases</text>
  <text start="1565.489" dur="5.221">just like this it&amp;#39;s so poorly done there</text>
  <text start="1567.95" dur="5.729">are things missing there there are parts</text>
  <text start="1570.71" dur="5.219">of it as just aren&amp;#39;t right and I would</text>
  <text start="1573.679" dur="4.83">say they had a junior writer from the</text>
  <text start="1575.929" dur="4.05">New York Times to it it&amp;#39;s very poor we</text>
  <text start="1578.509" dur="3.061">got to have you come back and talk more</text>
  <text start="1579.979" dur="4.86">about it John dad they should have had</text>
  <text start="1581.57" dur="5.939">him on for a full hour that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="1584.839" dur="4.41">should have done that&amp;#39;s it this</text>
  <text start="1587.509" dur="4.411">basically explains it all here I have</text>
  <text start="1589.249" dur="8.701">some serious questions about</text>
  <text start="1591.92" dur="7.85">the especially part two of the report</text>
  <text start="1597.95" dur="3.96">part one</text>

  <text start="1604.16" dur="3.87">mean there looks like there are blatant</text>
