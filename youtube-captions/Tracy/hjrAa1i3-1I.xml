  <text start="7.649" dur="6.211">years ago on this day I was born so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="11.13" dur="4.44">in New York for the week and doing work</text>
  <text start="13.86" dur="3.3">lots and lots of work but I wanted to</text>
  <text start="15.57" dur="4.049">upload an episode of the podcast from</text>

  <text start="23.699" dur="4.83">podcasting platforms for some odd reason</text>
  <text start="26.119" dur="3.791">so I figured I would upload an episode</text>
  <text start="28.529" dur="2.82">for you guys today but first we have to</text>
  <text start="29.91" dur="2.79">talk about noble gold because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="3.21">sponsored this channel for quite some</text>
  <text start="32.7" dur="3.199">time now and it&amp;#39;s really a huge help to</text>
  <text start="34.559" dur="3.901">me and they&amp;#39;re great people over there</text>
  <text start="35.899" dur="5.471">back when the stock market collapsed in</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="6.689">2008 gold actually rose every single</text>
  <text start="41.37" dur="6.029">year 20% for three years after that and</text>
  <text start="45.149" dur="3.721">we&amp;#39;ve had an incredible bull run on the</text>
  <text start="47.399" dur="4.261">markets for ten years</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="4.74">JP Mart the JP Morgan co-chairman</text>
  <text start="51.66" dur="4.11">actually believes will have a new 40% in</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="3.48">the stock market by next year a lot of</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="2.789">investors aren&amp;#39;t aware they can actually</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="3.989">put their money into something different</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="6.151">besides the stock market for their IRA</text>
  <text start="61.079" dur="5.941">or old 401k no one can predict when and</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="3.87">if the next financial meltdown will hit</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="3.599">but it would be really smart to take a</text>
  <text start="68.58" dur="3.51">look at your options right now you can</text>
  <text start="70.619" dur="6.451">actually take your physical gold and</text>

  <text start="82.409" dur="4.651">or old 401k into physical gold for years</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="3.629">and they have a really easy three-step</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="3.9">process to get it done quickly and</text>
  <text start="88.829" dur="4.201">safely it&amp;#39;s not complicated it takes</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="3.6">less than 10 minutes to do and then you</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="3.199">can just relax knowing you&amp;#39;ve got</text>

  <text start="363.65" dur="6.629">was the bail hearing on Thursday and I</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="6.869">just read the whole entire opinion and</text>
  <text start="370.279" dur="6.651">it is very very very solid he the judge</text>
  <text start="373.699" dur="6.15">goes over every different aspect of why</text>
  <text start="376.93" dur="5.68">detention pretrial detention is mandated</text>
  <text start="379.849" dur="6.271">between the possible intimidation of</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="7.14">victims to the ability for Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="7.44">Epstein to flee to his unexplained</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="5.789">financial wealth all of the danger he</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="4.079">poses to the community the fact that he</text>
  <text start="395.539" dur="4.231">tried to obstruct justice in the 2008</text>
  <text start="397.639" dur="5.37">case all of it is covered in detail</text>
  <text start="399.77" dur="5.85">inside of this opinion on why he will be</text>
  <text start="403.009" dur="3.931">detained until trial I do want to</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="3">mention we&amp;#39;re going to get off into</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="2.069">conspiracy land a little bit today on</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="1.439">the show</text>
  <text start="409.009" dur="4.951">because there&amp;#39;s some really interesting</text>
  <text start="410.059" dur="6.45">stuff happening but this would follow</text>
  <text start="413.96" dur="5.039">suit sort of in the our Kelly case when</text>
  <text start="416.509" dur="4.8">the our Kelly decision in Chicago came</text>
  <text start="418.999" dur="4.82">down I thought to myself okay well this</text>
  <text start="421.309" dur="6.181">bodes well for the judge detaining</text>
  <text start="423.819" dur="6.25">Epstein and the victim spoke in court in</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="4.259">the Epstein case and both of the victims</text>
  <text start="430.069" dur="3.84">who spoke said that they fear for their</text>
  <text start="431.749" dur="4.32">safety which I don&amp;#39;t blame them do you</text>
  <text start="433.909" dur="5.22">Frank no and they released some</text>
  <text start="436.069" dur="6.81">paperwork some exhibits that accompanied</text>
  <text start="439.129" dur="6.72">the decision and I had read through them</text>
  <text start="442.879" dur="5.731">and they are basically they&amp;#39;re from from</text>
  <text start="445.849" dur="4.771">Adam villa fauna who was the US attorney</text>
  <text start="448.61" dur="4.289">down in Florida who was also working on</text>
  <text start="450.62" dur="4.109">this case with Acosta talking to</text>
  <text start="452.899" dur="3.811">Lefkowitz who is one of Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="3.69">attorneys and they&amp;#39;re basically going</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="3.81">back and forth trying to figure out the</text>
  <text start="458.419" dur="4.25">statutes they can use other than the</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="4.53">ones that he&amp;#39;s actually guilty of to</text>
  <text start="462.669" dur="3.851">slam them with something and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="5.19">going back and forth and I guess the</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="6.6">attorney asks hey you know which there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="4.409">no email in in other words we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="3.449">the email from the attorney to her</text>
  <text start="474.649" dur="4.86">asking about this but this is what the</text>
  <text start="476.569" dur="4.201">reply is about draft agreements that</text>
  <text start="479.509" dur="3.05">they&amp;#39;re working on I&amp;#39;m gonna read it in</text>
  <text start="480.77" dur="5.399">full because it made my stomach turn</text>
  <text start="482.559" dur="5.23">okay it says hi J who&amp;#39;s a lawyer for up</text>
  <text start="486.169" dur="3.99">scene I was hoping there would be things</text>
  <text start="487.789" dur="3.93">for me to read this morning but I&amp;#39;ll try</text>
  <text start="490.159" dur="3.03">to remain patient and I assume she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.719" dur="3.6">saying she was expecting something from</text>
  <text start="493.189" dur="3.57">him I believe there are only two types</text>
  <text start="495.319" dur="3.75">of agreements that would apply to this</text>
  <text start="496.759" dur="4.2">case one a plea agreement to a federal</text>
  <text start="499.069" dur="3.87">charge of charges and to a</text>
  <text start="500.959" dur="3.96">non-prosecution agreement which is</text>
  <text start="502.939" dur="3.421">really a deferred prosecution agreement</text>
  <text start="504.919" dur="3.39">because the defendant agrees that if he</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="4.349">violates the agreement the US can</text>
  <text start="508.309" dur="4.29">prosecute him a plea agreement is part</text>
  <text start="510.709" dur="3.75">of the court file it&amp;#39;s not accessible</text>
  <text start="512.599" dur="4.011">online via pacer but someone can go to</text>
  <text start="514.459" dur="4.32">the clerk&amp;#39;s office to obtain a copy a</text>
  <text start="516.61" dur="3.909">non-prosecution agreement would not be</text>
  <text start="518.779" dur="3.331">made public or filed with the court but</text>
  <text start="520.519" dur="3.541">it would remain part of our case file</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="3.81">and it probably would be subject to FOIA</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="3.6">but it&amp;#39;s not something that we would</text>
  <text start="525.92" dur="3.75">distribute without compulsory process</text>
  <text start="527.66" dur="4.47">meaning someone would have to sue to get</text>
  <text start="529.67" dur="4.169">it on the obstruction charges that which</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="3.24">I believe is against the law on the</text>
  <text start="533.839" dur="3.421">obstruction charge as many of the facts</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="3.63">I included in that first proffer we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="3.54">hapa hypothesized based on our</text>
  <text start="539" dur="3.13">discussions and the agents observations</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="3.43">of blank</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="3.93">redacted we will need to interview her</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="4.05">to confirm the accuracy of those facts</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="3.78">on a second count we could rely on the</text>
  <text start="548.28" dur="3.75">incident where mr. Epstein&amp;#39;s private</text>
  <text start="549.84" dur="4.5">investigators followed redacted &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="554.34" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s something more recently rated</text>
  <text start="555.69" dur="4.71">related to any redaction we would</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="5.34">consider that hope that helps the reason</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="5.64">why that&amp;#39;s important is because the US</text>
  <text start="563.13" dur="5.52">Attorney&amp;#39;s in Florida were trying to</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="4.43">charge him instead of the actual crimes</text>
  <text start="568.65" dur="4.2">with obstruction of justice and</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="4.27">intimidation and that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="572.85" dur="4.71">things that the judge in New York used</text>
  <text start="574.74" dur="4.56">just recently to say he was a danger to</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="3.27">the public if he was released because he</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="3.66">had tried witness intimidation in the</text>
  <text start="580.83" dur="4.05">fact in the past and they the proof that</text>
  <text start="582.96" dur="4.47">because he denied that in the current</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="5.52">case he denied that that was happening</text>
  <text start="587.43" dur="5.25">okay the the proof the judge was using</text>
  <text start="590.4" dur="3.72">to say well listen we have emails</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="3.18">between your attorneys and the US</text>
  <text start="594.12" dur="3.6">government talking about how you did</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="5.49">this and whether or not you&amp;#39;d use it as</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="6.87">a bolster for your plea agreement or</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="5.49">whatever so this is why this exhibit was</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="3.99">submitted with the bail memo because the</text>
  <text start="606.84" dur="4.53">judge was using it to prove obstruction</text>
  <text start="608.58" dur="5.49">and why that&amp;#39;s poignant in keeping him</text>
  <text start="611.37" dur="4.95">detained however what is overlooked in</text>
  <text start="614.07" dur="4.89">that I think is the disgusting way</text>
  <text start="616.32" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re negotiating his charges based on</text>
  <text start="618.96" dur="4.77">how he can hide them from the public so</text>
  <text start="621.45" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re talking about what&amp;#39;s accessible</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="4.47">and what&amp;#39;s not accessible and what&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="625.56" dur="4.35">public and what&amp;#39;s not in public and what</text>
  <text start="628.2" dur="4.14">might be the best way to go based on</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="4.29">that and I just think that&amp;#39;s gross yeah</text>
  <text start="632.34" dur="4.41">and this is the government attorney I</text>
  <text start="634.2" dur="4.55">mean this is just discussing yeah and</text>
  <text start="636.75" dur="5.46">have you have you been able to read</text>
  <text start="638.75" dur="6.07">outside of the coz I talked about the</text>
  <text start="642.21" dur="4.65">the the denying of bail last night a</text>
  <text start="644.82" dur="4.35">little bit and the reasons why and</text>
  <text start="646.86" dur="6.3">understand I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all</text>

  <text start="816.89" dur="4.17">at this a little bit and I find it</text>
  <text start="818.27" dur="6.09">really telling that the charges against</text>

  <text start="824.36" dur="5.789">do you think this is about because I</text>
  <text start="826.07" dur="7.11">have I&amp;#39;ve read very lightly that this is</text>

  <text start="835.04" dur="8.19">about to say ok nothing</text>
  <text start="839.95" dur="7.72">ok good I have been reading that this is</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="8.49">an example of a guy pretty much trying</text>
  <text start="847.67" dur="6.09">to trying to to clean up and try to make</text>

  <text start="861.35" dur="3.87">some deals it could be it could be I</text>
  <text start="863.66" dur="3.36">just found it interesting that the civil</text>
  <text start="865.22" dur="3.75">case was dropped against him and it</text>
  <text start="867.02" dur="3.39">appears to be quite honest with you now</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="3">let me go in I don&amp;#39;t have anything to</text>
  <text start="870.41" dur="3.38">back this up either other than the few</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="4.77">facts I&amp;#39;m about to share with you ok</text>
  <text start="873.79" dur="4.93">Kevin Spacey was was charged with this</text>
  <text start="876.74" dur="4.14">crime he comes out with the video that</text>
  <text start="878.72" dur="4.29">we did we play the video on the show no</text>
  <text start="880.88" dur="4.26">we didn&amp;#39;t but that&amp;#39;s that video was part</text>
  <text start="883.01" dur="4.53">of the part of the evidence that people</text>
  <text start="885.14" dur="4.8">are using like you know what cuz it was</text>
  <text start="887.54" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s odd what is he doing he&amp;#39;s not reply</text>
  <text start="889.94" dur="4.47">for reprising his role of Frank</text>
  <text start="891.86" dur="4.979">Underwood house of cards is done with</text>
  <text start="894.41" dur="5.07">but he was about to embark on all the</text>
  <text start="896.839" dur="4.561">legal chapters and the legal fights in</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="4.47">his life and then all of a sudden I</text>
  <text start="901.4" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s three minutes long I</text>
  <text start="903.95" dur="4.62">mean people might not have heard it and</text>
  <text start="905.9" dur="3.6">and playing it now in retrospect of what</text>
  <text start="908.57" dur="2.43">just happened</text>
  <text start="909.5" dur="3.3">well people got to see it too because</text>
  <text start="911" dur="4.68">now they&amp;#39;re pointing out little things</text>
  <text start="912.8" dur="4.74">about the mug yeah well yeah that the</text>
  <text start="915.68" dur="4.89">Queen and the mug and what it represents</text>
  <text start="917.54" dur="5.31">and who is like is he is he tipping is</text>
  <text start="920.57" dur="6.209">he telling is that video more so for the</text>
  <text start="922.85" dur="4.92">people who he is saying if I go down I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="926.779" dur="4.05">taking you with me</text>
  <text start="927.77" dur="5.25">you know what is this really who&amp;#39;s he</text>
  <text start="930.829" dur="3.691">really talking to now so look what I</text>
  <text start="933.02" dur="3.54">want to say is this this is like a</text>
  <text start="934.52" dur="3.93">theory that I&amp;#39;m poking around in my head</text>
  <text start="936.56" dur="3.57">and I don&amp;#39;t again this is loosely based</text>
  <text start="938.45" dur="3.48">on some things that I&amp;#39;m sure will get</text>
  <text start="940.13" dur="3.33">more but the</text>
  <text start="941.93" dur="3.36">problem with this case that was brought</text>
  <text start="943.46" dur="4.4">against him this this criminal case the</text>
  <text start="945.29" dur="6.6">reason why the case was dismissed is</text>
  <text start="947.86" dur="5.62">really uncommon it&amp;#39;s that there was a</text>
  <text start="951.89" dur="4.32">cellphone that contained supposed</text>
  <text start="953.48" dur="4.77">evidence on it from the victim right and</text>
  <text start="956.21" dur="4.83">it was one of the linchpins in the</text>
  <text start="958.25" dur="4.44">prosecution&amp;#39;s case and when the judge</text>
  <text start="961.04" dur="3.33">brought the witness up on the stand to</text>
  <text start="962.69" dur="5.19">talk about it and answer questions about</text>
  <text start="964.37" dur="5.76">it he pled the fifth now it came out</text>
  <text start="967.88" dur="4.59">that that phone was tampered with and is</text>
  <text start="970.13" dur="4.26">now missing so some of the things were</text>
  <text start="972.47" dur="3.929">edited some of the things were deleted</text>
  <text start="974.39" dur="3.99">the mother deleted text messages it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="976.399" dur="3.511">all it so it all suddenly came out in</text>
  <text start="978.38" dur="4.68">court that this key piece of evidence</text>
  <text start="979.91" dur="4.83">was messed with by the people who were</text>
  <text start="983.06" dur="3.42">charging him with the with the with the</text>
  <text start="984.74" dur="3.57">crime right the the process it brought</text>
  <text start="986.48" dur="4.47">by the victim they edited the</text>
  <text start="988.31" dur="5.01">information and the judge said there we</text>
  <text start="990.95" dur="4.29">can&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t charge this man when the</text>
  <text start="993.32" dur="4.38">evidence you use to bring these charges</text>
  <text start="995.24" dur="5.64">is now tampered with defunct and missing</text>
  <text start="997.7" dur="6.78">and they let him go which leads me to</text>
  <text start="1000.88" dur="6.87">believe or think or ponder or speculate</text>
  <text start="1004.48" dur="5.79">that these charges on Kevin Spacey may</text>
  <text start="1007.75" dur="5.55">not have been real at all that maybe</text>
  <text start="1010.27" dur="5.22">Kevin Spacey was you was was talking</text>
  <text start="1013.3" dur="4.14">before and they found out and</text>
  <text start="1015.49" dur="3.87">manufactured this against him and then</text>
  <text start="1017.44" dur="4.92">listening to the video and retrospect of</text>
  <text start="1019.36" dur="4.709">that it just makes more sense now again</text>
  <text start="1022.36" dur="3.81">that is complete and total speculation</text>
  <text start="1024.069" dur="4.26">on my part I&amp;#39;m just trying to put these</text>
  <text start="1026.17" dur="4.169">pieces together in this really odd story</text>
  <text start="1028.329" dur="3.36">and there is not even any evidence out</text>
  <text start="1030.339" dur="3.271">there to suggest that he&amp;#39;s tied to</text>
  <text start="1031.689" dur="4.02">epstein other than he flew on the planes</text>
  <text start="1033.61" dur="3.589">or that he had anything to do with this</text>
  <text start="1035.709" dur="4.201">or what was going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1037.199" dur="5.62">no evidence to support it it&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="1039.91" dur="4.59">timing of it all is just so odd is he</text>
  <text start="1042.819" dur="4.471">another one that just used the plane for</text>
  <text start="1044.5" dur="6.08">like a little in-country tag-along ride</text>
  <text start="1047.29" dur="3.29">or did he go to the island</text>
  <text start="1050.94" dur="7.45">Clinton 26 trips aboard traveling with</text>
  <text start="1054.76" dur="6.51">federal feather fell traveling with</text>

  <text start="1061.27" dur="6.12">Africa Africa all right well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1065.29" dur="3.87">know on that trip to Africa on the</text>
  <text start="1067.39" dur="5.039">manifest from that day I do know there</text>
  <text start="1069.16" dur="5.37">were younger women but if Kevin Spacey</text>
  <text start="1072.429" dur="3.811">is gay yeah I know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1074.53" dur="2.85">and all this yeah I mean he no one never</text>
  <text start="1076.24" dur="3.09">knew he was gay and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1077.38" dur="4.08">he was gay you know what I mean oh by</text>
  <text start="1079.33" dur="4.83">the way did I ever tell you guys that</text>
  <text start="1081.46" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;m gay I know after all these years and</text>
  <text start="1084.16" dur="3.15">everything I just all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1086.11" dur="3.48">decided I would let everybody know that</text>
  <text start="1087.31" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m gay you know but the timing is the</text>
  <text start="1089.59" dur="3.51">time is right the fighting time is</text>
  <text start="1091.15" dur="6.6">finally right time with him being</text>
  <text start="1093.1" dur="7.89">accused of being a pedophile craziest</text>
  <text start="1097.75" dur="5.37">thing oh my god why would you people</text>
  <text start="1100.99" dur="3.66">thought like you know people said he was</text>
  <text start="1103.12" dur="3.6">trying to get her in front of the</text>
  <text start="1104.65" dur="4.14">pedophilia charges by announcing he was</text>
  <text start="1106.72" dur="6.45">gay is some sort of like a sympathy card</text>
  <text start="1108.79" dur="6.36">yeah well I mean it was he facing any</text>
  <text start="1113.17" dur="6.54">kind of accusations from anybody younger</text>
  <text start="1115.15" dur="7.68">than 15 though yes okay he&amp;#39;s all Spacey</text>
  <text start="1119.71" dur="5.91">Spacey oh oh no not that I know of no</text>

  <text start="2634.98" dur="4.71">is being financed by a foreign</text>
  <text start="2637.14" dur="4.83">government and so that&amp;#39;s where this</text>
  <text start="2639.69" dur="5.43">whole fara thing comes into play for</text>
  <text start="2641.97" dur="6.39">Flynn and the turkey stuff he wrote an</text>
  <text start="2645.12" dur="5.49">op-ed where you know he basically it was</text>
  <text start="2648.36" dur="4.74">all about Gulen and trying to get him to</text>

  <text start="2653.1" dur="6.12">me so far so far okay it&amp;#39;s complicated</text>
  <text start="2656.04" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s really complicated so the attorneys</text>
  <text start="2659.22" dur="4.83">during the course of the plea you know</text>
  <text start="2661.65" dur="4.169">the the plea deal and everything the</text>
  <text start="2664.05" dur="5.25">government comes to Flynn and says look</text>
  <text start="2665.819" dur="5.671">we want to charge your business partner</text>
  <text start="2669.3" dur="3.99">and his and you know the other gentleman</text>

  <text start="2676.98" dur="4.71">cooperate with us as we try to do that</text>

  <text start="2681.69" dur="5.19">will cooperate with you and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="2684.63" dur="4.29">the sentencing has been subsequently</text>
  <text start="2686.88" dur="3.6">pushed back over time in the Flynn case</text>

  <text start="2927.24" dur="4.109">lie about this stuff he believed this</text>
  <text start="2929.19" dur="5.129">stuff was true which is a key component</text>
  <text start="2931.349" dur="5.19">in charging on fara violations just so</text>
  <text start="2934.319" dur="3.48">you know if you don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2936.539" dur="2.941">something that you&amp;#39;re putting like if</text>

  <text start="2955.89" dur="3.99">going on there</text>
  <text start="2956.819" dur="6.181">you don&amp;#39;t take the fall just because you</text>
  <text start="2959.88" dur="5.31">got looped in precisely okay that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2963" dur="2.609">these that&amp;#39;s little that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="2965.19" dur="3.359">interesting</text>
  <text start="2965.609" dur="6.45">so yeah so now what does the government</text>
  <text start="2968.549" dur="5.55">do basically threaten Sidney Powell the</text>
  <text start="2972.059" dur="4.111">government goes to court and says as a</text>
  <text start="2974.099" dur="5.071">matter of fact instead of making Flynn a</text>
  <text start="2976.17" dur="5.52">cooperating witness as we have glowingly</text>
  <text start="2979.17" dur="4.859">spoken of him this entire time saying</text>
  <text start="2981.69" dur="4.53">that we knew he wasn&amp;#39;t involved in the</text>
  <text start="2984.029" dur="4.471">conspiracy in court documents this is</text>
  <text start="2986.22" dur="4.859">said right the government has admitted</text>
  <text start="2988.5" dur="4.769">in court documents Flynn was unaware he</text>
  <text start="2991.079" dur="4.171">was not a part of the conspiracy all of</text>
  <text start="2993.269" dur="5.01">a sudden the government says he&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2995.25" dur="5.16">unindicted co-conspirator he did know</text>
  <text start="2998.279" dur="4.77">and he was a part of the conspiracy and</text>
  <text start="3000.41" dur="5.609">the judge says hold on a second hold the</text>
  <text start="3003.049" dur="5.55">boat right you can&amp;#39;t just change your</text>
  <text start="3006.019" dur="5.191">mind about this after everything we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3008.599" dur="5.341">been through so far so there&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="3011.21" dur="4.71">hubbub here now the judge Sullivan in</text>
  <text start="3013.94" dur="4.319">the other case is paying keen and close</text>
  <text start="3015.92" dur="4.56">attention to all of this because as you</text>
  <text start="3018.259" dur="4.441">know from that December hearing there</text>
  <text start="3020.48" dur="4.049">has been some craziness going on about</text>
  <text start="3022.7" dur="6.3">his plea whether he wants to withdraw it</text>
  <text start="3024.529" dur="8.58">all kinds of stuff right yeah so this</text>
  <text start="3029" dur="7.099">case is moving on there&amp;#39;s word that FBI</text>
  <text start="3033.109" dur="5.22">agents contacted Michael Flynn jr. and</text>
  <text start="3036.099" dur="3.75">attempted cuz Michael Flynn jr. was also</text>
  <text start="3038.329" dur="4.561">working with his father in the business</text>
  <text start="3039.849" dur="5.561">attempted to intimidate him ask him all</text>
  <text start="3042.89" dur="5.79">kinds of questions Michael Flynn jr. has</text>
  <text start="3045.41" dur="5.939">counsel okay Michael Flynn jr. says over</text>
  <text start="3048.68" dur="4.919">and over don&amp;#39;t talk to me talk to my</text>
  <text start="3051.349" dur="3.72">attorney stop coming to me directly I</text>
  <text start="3053.599" dur="3.631">won&amp;#39;t speak to you and they basically</text>
  <text start="3055.069" dur="3.171">harassed the dude until they finally</text>
  <text start="3057.23" dur="5.45">give up</text>
  <text start="3058.24" dur="6.47">then they&amp;#39;d they file a a document that</text>
  <text start="3062.68" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re going to call him as a witness</text>
  <text start="3064.71" dur="8.74">right this was filed doesn&amp;#39;t say the</text>
  <text start="3069.07" dur="6.84">date this was filed and they designate</text>
  <text start="3073.45" dur="4.919">his son as a material government witness</text>
  <text start="3075.91" dur="4.23">because now they can&amp;#39;t get Flynn so they</text>
  <text start="3078.369" dur="3.031">need to get his son to cooperate you</text>
  <text start="3080.14" dur="2.729">know his sons not been involved in this</text>
  <text start="3081.4" dur="3.719">the entire time but all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="3082.869" dur="3.951">here&amp;#39;s Mike Flynn jr. and then what</text>
  <text start="3085.119" dur="4.081">Margo Cleveland is saying if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3086.82" dur="5.86">misunderstanding it correctly today is</text>
  <text start="3089.2" dur="5.669">that is that Flynn jr. the prosecutors</text>
  <text start="3092.68" dur="3.93">today wrapped up the case against the</text>
  <text start="3094.869" dur="5.101">business partner they called all their</text>
  <text start="3096.61" dur="5.49">witnesses right and Flynn jr. was not</text>
  <text start="3099.97" dur="4.68">called as a witness which means that was</text>
  <text start="3102.1" dur="5.19">an intimidation tactic to try and get</text>
  <text start="3104.65" dur="3.98">Flynn to flip on his position and admit</text>
  <text start="3107.29" dur="4.32">he lied to something he didn&amp;#39;t lie about</text>
  <text start="3108.63" dur="4.87">so that they could get him as a witness</text>
  <text start="3111.61" dur="3.96">on the stand so they could do something</text>
  <text start="3113.5" dur="5.119">with their case and actually so they</text>
  <text start="3115.57" dur="7.32">tried they tried to twist his arm by</text>
  <text start="3118.619" dur="5.591">threatening to call Flynn jr. in and but</text>
  <text start="3122.89" dur="3.12">obviously he had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="3124.21" dur="5.01">anything because if he did he would have</text>
  <text start="3126.01" dur="5.01">been a key witness in addition in</text>
  <text start="3129.22" dur="4.17">addition there&amp;#39;s one other well what was</text>
  <text start="3131.02" dur="4.83">the what was the what was the</text>
  <text start="3133.39" dur="5.1">justification for even bringing Michael</text>
  <text start="3135.85" dur="6.48">Flynn jr. into it in the first place if</text>
  <text start="3138.49" dur="6.96">it was if he was so far removed from the</text>
  <text start="3142.33" dur="4.59">entire business itself wasn&amp;#39;t he was the</text>

  <text start="3322.19" dur="4.11">there I am pretty sure that I got that</text>
  <text start="3324.17" dur="4.71">all right but there&amp;#39;s a possibility that</text>
  <text start="3326.3" dur="3.78">some of it is is just a skewed just a</text>
  <text start="3328.88" dur="3.27">teeny bit I doubt it</text>
  <text start="3330.08" dur="4.2">but it&amp;#39;s a lot of data to hold inside</text>

  <text start="3336.29" dur="4.35">have a clear understanding or a clear</text>
  <text start="3338.99" dur="5.1">remembering I guess because you know the</text>
  <text start="3340.64" dur="5.13">other thing is - with the news cycle in</text>
  <text start="3344.09" dur="4.77">the way it is and where this all pivots</text>
  <text start="3345.77" dur="5.07">and how these things develop I it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3348.86" dur="3.9">almost like reading a book the book is</text>
  <text start="3350.84" dur="2.46">fresh in your head once you you&amp;#39;re done</text>

  <text start="3355.88" dur="4.92">be really good on all the details and</text>
  <text start="3357.74" dur="5.97">then you forget and and it when it comes</text>
  <text start="3360.8" dur="5.58">to Flynn the you started the whole thing</text>
  <text start="3363.71" dur="5.34">off talking about how you know he it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3366.38" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s one of those weird facts about this</text>
  <text start="3369.05" dur="4.44">whole thing is that he pled guilty to</text>
  <text start="3370.73" dur="4.35">lying about his the circumstances</text>
  <text start="3373.49" dur="3.66">surrounding his conversation with kiss</text>
  <text start="3375.08" dur="4.41">lyac but then we found out he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3377.15" dur="4.92">lying what is that can you really</text>
  <text start="3379.49" dur="4.53">quickly how did we find out that he was</text>
  <text start="3382.07" dur="6.27">not lying about what he had pled guilty</text>
  <text start="3384.02" dur="8.01">to doing okay the 302s</text>
  <text start="3388.34" dur="5.52">in the case that the FBI 302s of the</text>
  <text start="3392.03" dur="4.62">agents that interviewed him one was</text>
  <text start="3393.86" dur="5.67">struck were released Isaak sculpt Ettore</text>
  <text start="3396.65" dur="4.68">evidence and they say in there that he</text>
  <text start="3399.53" dur="4.14">they didn&amp;#39;t feel he was lying about his</text>
  <text start="3401.33" dur="4.77">conversation so then let me answer then</text>
  <text start="3403.67" dur="7.2">the bigger question from there and is</text>
  <text start="3406.1" dur="7.77">what does that imply that he was not</text>
  <text start="3410.87" dur="5.37">lying about something that he eventually</text>
  <text start="3413.87" dur="4.65">pled guilty to what is the strategy or</text>
  <text start="3416.24" dur="4.47">and the decision-making behind then</text>
  <text start="3418.52" dur="3.87">pleading guilty then one of the one of</text>
  <text start="3420.71" dur="4.62">the things that I&amp;#39;ve always pondered</text>
  <text start="3422.39" dur="4.56">like as a very like surface-level reason</text>
  <text start="3425.33" dur="3.84">is look what they&amp;#39;re doing to his family</text>
  <text start="3426.95" dur="5.88">and I think that there&amp;#39;s an intimidation</text>
  <text start="3429.17" dur="5.91">factor here Flynn didn&amp;#39;t know what was</text>
  <text start="3432.83" dur="5.07">going on in his business because he was</text>
  <text start="3435.08" dur="4.71">busy campaigning and because his</text>
  <text start="3437.9" dur="4.26">business ran amok and he doesn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="3439.79" dur="5.43">didn&amp;#39;t know what was going on they</text>
  <text start="3442.16" dur="6.39">probably held horrible you know treason</text>
  <text start="3445.22" dur="5.31">or FISA or fara violations against him</text>
  <text start="3448.55" dur="4.26">not only that but we&amp;#39;re gonna learn very</text>
  <text start="3450.53" dur="4.68">soon that there was a FISA on Flynn for</text>
  <text start="3452.81" dur="4.47">sure and that that&amp;#39;s how they knew all</text>
  <text start="3455.21" dur="4.08">stuff before you know what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="3457.28" dur="4.65">like there&amp;#39;s a lot of charges that so</text>
  <text start="3459.29" dur="4.47">then it wasn&amp;#39;t just incidental no no</text>
  <text start="3461.93" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re gonna learn there was a FISA on</text>
  <text start="3463.76" dur="5.609">Flynn at the same time and if you</text>
  <text start="3465.44" dur="7.83">remember what&amp;#39;s his name private rent</text>
  <text start="3469.369" dur="5.881">Reince Priebus and and others ask Jim</text>
  <text start="3473.27" dur="3.9">Comey if there was a fight on Flynn way</text>
  <text start="3475.25" dur="4.589">back in the day when the Comey memos</text>
  <text start="3477.17" dur="5.79">came out we learned that and you know I</text>
  <text start="3479.839" dur="6.301">was I said no he didn&amp;#39;t answer it did</text>
  <text start="3482.96" dur="6.27">not answer nope and and you know talking</text>
  <text start="3486.14" dur="5.88">about FISA and all that stuff you in and</text>
  <text start="3489.23" dur="4.65">the the reasons for applying for</text>
  <text start="3492.02" dur="4.56">surveillance warrants I will I wonder</text>
  <text start="3493.88" dur="4.95">what the reason to get one on Michael</text>
  <text start="3496.58" dur="3.9">Flynn was if they saw all the hoops they</text>
  <text start="3498.83" dur="3.48">had to jump through and all the nonsense</text>
  <text start="3500.48" dur="4.889">they had to create just to get one on</text>
  <text start="3502.31" dur="5.45">Carter page look the helper case the</text>
  <text start="3505.369" dur="4.621">helper thing comes into play immediately</text>
  <text start="3507.76" dur="4.75">remember he was at that dinner with</text>
  <text start="3509.99" dur="5.49">Stephan helper overseas and that woman</text>
  <text start="3512.51" dur="6.54">that we played on the show yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="3515.48" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s back in 2015 and I think that</text>
  <text start="3519.05" dur="4.049">that&amp;#39;s one of the major reasons why they</text>
  <text start="3521.48" dur="3.72">were able to go to the court for a FISA</text>
  <text start="3523.099" dur="4.921">application they tried to make it like</text>
  <text start="3525.2" dur="4.56">he was co-opted or honeypotted or</text>
  <text start="3528.02" dur="4.56">whatever was working on behalf of the</text>
  <text start="3529.76" dur="4.859">Soviet government because of a fake</text>
  <text start="3532.58" dur="4.65">story that was made up about his</text>
  <text start="3534.619" dur="5.551">relationship to assets of Atlanta makes</text>
  <text start="3537.23" dur="5.369">sense yeah the other thing is I just</text>
  <text start="3540.17" dur="4.77">want to we&amp;#39;ll end with this I got what</text>
  <text start="3542.599" dur="5.431">you were just saying about the book is</text>
  <text start="3544.94" dur="5.49">so true because I will tell you I with</text>
  <text start="3548.03" dur="5.64">preparing for Muller to come up and and</text>
  <text start="3550.43" dur="5.61">maybe testify next week on the 24th I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3553.67" dur="4.59">been working on you know a bunch of</text>
  <text start="3556.04" dur="3.72">different reports on what questions and</text>
  <text start="3558.26" dur="3.15">what questions won&amp;#39;t he answer and what</text>
  <text start="3559.76" dur="4.38">questions will he answer and all kinds</text>
  <text start="3561.41" dur="5.4">of stuff and I it took me a good minute</text>
  <text start="3564.14" dur="4.709">or 10 or 15 sitting in front of the</text>
  <text start="3566.81" dur="3.66">computer trying to remember all the</text>
  <text start="3568.849" dur="3.931">intricate details of this because it</text>
  <text start="3570.47" dur="4.83">hasn&amp;#39;t been at the forefront for a</text>
  <text start="3572.78" dur="5.13">really long time in news in a news</text>
  <text start="3575.3" dur="4.26">broadcast sense you know a lot of other</text>
  <text start="3577.91" dur="3.39">things kind of took over the media and</text>
  <text start="3579.56" dur="3.42">Spygate kind of shirked back because</text>
  <text start="3581.3" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s no frickin leaks coming out of</text>
  <text start="3582.98" dur="4.95">that investigation just saying</text>
  <text start="3585.56" dur="3.54">so Spygate kind of took us a back seat</text>
  <text start="3587.93" dur="2.73">while they&amp;#39;re doing all this invest</text>
  <text start="3589.1" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re waiting on the fives and stuff I</text>
  <text start="3590.66" dur="4.68">was like oh my gosh I need to get back</text>
  <text start="3593.3" dur="4.05">into this and refresh my memory on all</text>
  <text start="3595.34" dur="4.14">this stuff because I remembered some</text>
  <text start="3597.35" dur="4.89">stuff and then as I was writing it</text>
  <text start="3599.48" dur="4.02">started coming out but it really I was</text>
  <text start="3602.24" dur="2.91">like oh my god I can&amp;#39;t believe this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3603.5" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I consider myself very</text>
  <text start="3605.15" dur="3">well-versed in this topic and I&amp;#39;m having</text>
  <text start="3606.89" dur="4.74">a hard time remembering some of this</text>
  <text start="3608.15" dur="6.39">stuff ya know it gets it gets very very</text>
  <text start="3611.63" dur="6.45">sticky but review that&amp;#39;s why you got a</text>
  <text start="3614.54" dur="7.26">review it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s a task but</text>
  <text start="3618.08" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s really really gratifying when you</text>
  <text start="3621.8" dur="4.44">can put it all together and understand</text>
  <text start="3623.93" dur="4.68">that at some point yeah it is it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3626.24" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s like closing a chapter in a book or</text>
  <text start="3628.61" dur="5.46">like at least you know solidifying facts</text>
  <text start="3632.15" dur="3.93">in the book that you&amp;#39;re not getting from</text>
  <text start="3634.07" dur="4.11">many people you&amp;#39;re not hearing the story</text>
  <text start="3636.08" dur="4.71">for many people and you know I decided</text>
  <text start="3638.18" dur="5.28">like like I&amp;#39;m so sick and tired again of</text>
  <text start="3640.79" dur="4.5">assigning any value to anything people</text>
  <text start="3643.46" dur="5.24">in the legacy media say about anything</text>
  <text start="3645.29" dur="5.85">anymore it&amp;#39;s all like mixed up nonsense</text>
  <text start="3648.7" dur="3.76">magical nonsense that doesn&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="3651.14" dur="2.7">with that I mean it&amp;#39;s really ridiculous</text>
