  <text start="7.29" dur="4.05">I am back from an awesome trip to</text>
  <text start="9.45" dur="4.8">Washington DC where we had to walk away</text>
  <text start="11.34" dur="4.859">March weekend it was fantastic I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="14.25" dur="4.5">even know how to sum up the experience</text>
  <text start="16.199" dur="4.321">it was life-changing that&amp;#39;s for sure and</text>
  <text start="18.75" dur="3.449">I&amp;#39;m gonna do a video to kind of recap</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="3.509">all of that but I wanted to get back to</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="7.531">work for you you&amp;#39;re here for information</text>
  <text start="24.029" dur="8.07">and so here we are so I&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="29.73" dur="5.73">to catch up on George papadopolis tweets</text>
  <text start="32.099" dur="5.821">which are stellar and this one in</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="4.529">particular kind of struck me it says</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="4.35">well I can&amp;#39;t disclose the information</text>
  <text start="39.989" dur="4.771">publicly it&amp;#39;s a fact that both me and</text>
  <text start="42.27" dur="5.629">Congress know who the spy within the</text>
  <text start="44.76" dur="5.4">campaign was within the campaign</text>
  <text start="47.899" dur="4.361">Congress will likely included in a</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="5.25">report later on eyes were everywhere</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="4.68">during 2016 and I started thinking who</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="4.26">was within the campaign that could have</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="5.16">been a spy and a cast of characters came</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="4.229">before me Michael Cohen who was very</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="4.65">closely associated to Trump not as</text>
  <text start="63.899" dur="5.311">certainly in the campaign Manafort page</text>
  <text start="66.75" dur="6.81">then what there was Papadopoulos then</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="7.979">there was Clovis Roger stone connected</text>
  <text start="73.56" dur="5.52">to Michael Caputo and I just started</text>
  <text start="77.189" dur="3.511">going back and trying to dig through</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="4.26">some of these folks and figure out what</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="5.52">their deal was so I started with Sam</text>
  <text start="83.34" dur="4.59">Clovis and he was actually I did a</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="5.18">little bit on his history colonel in the</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="6.21">Air Force worked the Perry campaign</text>
  <text start="91.4" dur="5.35">before leaving in August 2015 to join</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="5.159">the cut the Trump campaign as a policy</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="4.17">adviser and then moved up to be like a</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="3.36">national communications director or</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="4.11">something like that I believe kind of</text>
  <text start="102.659" dur="7.861">very high up in the campaign and he</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="9.479">brought in Papadopoulos now let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="10.91">through a quick timeline on July 11th</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="6.921">2016 Carter page meet stefan hopper</text>
  <text start="124.39" dur="4.26">halper reaches out to Clovis through</text>
  <text start="127.97" dur="3.99">email</text>

  <text start="619.64" dur="5.78">Select Committee on Intelligence report</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="7.48">Clovis is mentioned not by name as</text>

  <text start="649.22" dur="3.96">it just doesn&amp;#39;t jive with me and I</text>
  <text start="651.53" dur="7.65">didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it in fact I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="747.29" dur="4.5">individuals who were trying to offer</text>
  <text start="749.48" dur="4.109">information to the campaign that would</text>
  <text start="751.79" dur="4.169">have jammed us up in some way shape or</text>
  <text start="753.589" dur="4.981">form I mean it&amp;#39;s very clear that salmon</text>

  <text start="862.829" dur="4.801">contacts with him in regards to people</text>
  <text start="864.66" dur="6.09">trying to infiltrate the campaign and he</text>
  <text start="867.63" dur="5.67">talks about an intelligence official who</text>
  <text start="870.75" dur="4.41">he thinks is one of those people and I</text>
  <text start="873.3" dur="3.3">gotta tell ya I covered this months ago</text>
  <text start="875.16" dur="3.299">and we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about it again</text>

  <text start="878.459" dur="3.87">talking about this was right in May</text>
  <text start="880.649" dur="3.841">right here he started coming out with</text>
  <text start="882.329" dur="4.891">this story hot and heavy about a</text>
  <text start="884.49" dur="5.61">government contractor who approached</text>
  <text start="887.22" dur="6.32">somebody that he knew and told them that</text>
  <text start="890.1" dur="7.08">they had Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s emails and</text>
  <text start="893.54" dur="5.65">tried to give them to him and then he</text>
  <text start="897.18" dur="4.11">basically got scared didn&amp;#39;t take them</text>
  <text start="899.19" dur="4.829">forgot about the whole thing and then</text>
  <text start="901.29" dur="4.35">all of a sudden in October saw that some</text>
  <text start="904.019" dur="5.25">of the things that this contractor had</text>
  <text start="905.64" dur="5.22">mentioned it to his intermediary came</text>
  <text start="909.269" dur="2.19">out in the WikiLeaks that had never been</text>
  <text start="910.86" dur="3.39">seen before</text>
  <text start="911.459" dur="4.711">which gave them validity to him but he</text>
  <text start="914.25" dur="3.69">still failed to mention it to the the</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="4.26">house when he testified in front of them</text>
  <text start="917.94" dur="4.11">at that point and there are many other</text>
  <text start="920.43" dur="4.07">things that Caputo&amp;#39;s forgotten to</text>
  <text start="922.05" dur="4.59">mention when he testifies like his</text>
  <text start="924.5" dur="5.829">interaction with Roger stone with a</text>
  <text start="926.64" dur="6.809">quote supposed Russian FBI agent in</text>
  <text start="930.329" dur="5.611">Florida where they asked stone to pay</text>
  <text start="933.449" dur="3.991">two million dollars for information</text>
  <text start="935.94" dur="3.78">about Hillary Clinton that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="937.44" dur="3.87">detrimental and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into</text>
  <text start="939.72" dur="3.479">this Caputo story now because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="941.31" dur="5.19">what the basis of this video is because</text>
  <text start="943.199" dur="5.431">page is fully documented Clovis is</text>
  <text start="946.5" dur="3.69">pretty well documented not that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="948.63" dur="2.94">not gonna be a new information that</text>
  <text start="950.19" dur="4.2">comes out but I&amp;#39;ll be honest it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="951.57" dur="4.53">okay but Caputo I don&amp;#39;t know what it is</text>
  <text start="954.39" dur="3.18">but every time I see Caputo I have all</text>
  <text start="956.1" dur="3.39">these questions that I just don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="957.57" dur="5.07">answers to and so we&amp;#39;re gonna revisit</text>
  <text start="959.49" dur="4.68">Michael Caputo and we&amp;#39;re gonna kind of</text>
  <text start="962.64" dur="4.47">go through the things that just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="964.17" dur="6.029">make sense the contradictions the weird</text>
  <text start="967.11" dur="5.28">happenings and I wish I had a firm</text>
  <text start="970.199" dur="6.57">conclusion for you guys at the end of</text>
  <text start="972.39" dur="8.04">this I don&amp;#39;t yet but there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="976.769" dur="6.331">weird going on in Kansas let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="980.43" dur="9.69">started so we&amp;#39;re gonna start on May 3rd</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="9.84">and May 3rd 2018 and this is a video</text>
  <text start="990.12" dur="3.18">that I did on May 22nd when he came out</text>
  <text start="992.94" dur="2.85">with this</text>
  <text start="993.3" dur="3.719">whole Wikileaks thing and what I did</text>
  <text start="995.79" dur="2.82">here and I&amp;#39;m not going to go through</text>
  <text start="997.019" dur="5.311">obviously the whole video I&amp;#39;m just going</text>
  <text start="998.61" dur="6.45">to show you some of it but basically on</text>
  <text start="1002.33" dur="5.22">May 30 came out and he told the world</text>
  <text start="1005.06" dur="4.529">that he had testified to Muller and he</text>
  <text start="1007.55" dur="3.719">went around saying that everything that</text>
  <text start="1009.589" dur="3.841">Muller is looking at is exactly what the</text>
  <text start="1011.269" dur="5.221">media is reporting and this is what he</text>
  <text start="1013.43" dur="6.69">said let&amp;#39;s listen in this email I mean</text>
  <text start="1016.49" dur="6.51">in this some in this interview he talks</text>
  <text start="1020.12" dur="5.55">about the Muller investigation and he</text>
  <text start="1023" dur="5.22">talks about WikiLeaks and in the</text>
  <text start="1025.67" dur="4.289">interview you just saw with Cavuto he</text>
  <text start="1028.22" dur="3.209">says that Muller wasn&amp;#39;t even interested</text>
  <text start="1029.959" dur="3.72">in hearing about what he had to say</text>
  <text start="1031.429" dur="4.231">about those emails or whatever it was he</text>
  <text start="1033.679" dur="4.351">was trying to be given so that</text>
  <text start="1035.66" dur="8.34">contradicts very strongly with what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1038.03" dur="8.19">saying here more about the campaign than</text>
  <text start="1044" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;d object or a target tie an</text>
  <text start="1046.22" dur="3.959">afterword minute that didn&amp;#39;t change but</text>
  <text start="1048.98" dur="3">I think they were looking for an</text>
  <text start="1050.179" dur="4.351">opportunity to make me a subject in this</text>
  <text start="1051.98" dur="4.8">thing but at the same time now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1054.53" dur="4.05">talking about WikiLeaks and DC leaks and</text>
  <text start="1056.78" dur="4.59">gusoff err and things like that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1058.58" dur="10.68">still very easy news they knew more</text>
  <text start="1061.37" dur="9.6">about the camp okay there&amp;#39;s one he only</text>
  <text start="1069.26" dur="3.03">asked me about Russian collusion it</text>
  <text start="1070.97" dur="4.65">seemed to me very much that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1072.29" dur="5.43">still focused on it he talked about you</text>
  <text start="1075.62" dur="5.37">know the WikiLeaks and the DC leaks and</text>
  <text start="1077.72" dur="5.04">the and the Gusev first stuff and they</text>
  <text start="1080.99" dur="3.929">asked me about a bunch of my friends</text>
  <text start="1082.76" dur="3.87">can I ask were there specific people</text>
  <text start="1084.919" dur="3.241">they were asking you about because I</text>
  <text start="1086.63" dur="2.94">spoke to Sam Nunn Berg after he was</text>
  <text start="1088.16" dur="2.67">interviewed by Muller steam he told me</text>
  <text start="1089.57" dur="3">that many of the questions were focused</text>
  <text start="1090.83" dur="3">on Roger stone I don&amp;#39;t know if you can</text>
  <text start="1092.57" dur="3.75">say but was that the case in your</text>
  <text start="1093.83" dur="5.55">interview as well I&amp;#39;m not going to act</text>
  <text start="1096.32" dur="5.43">like Sam Nunn Berg today on television I</text>
  <text start="1099.38" dur="3.929">don&amp;#39;t believe that the investigation</text>
  <text start="1101.75" dur="3.87">would appreciate me going into the</text>
  <text start="1103.309" dur="4.171">detail about everything that we read in</text>
  <text start="1105.62" dur="3.24">the paper you know and what we talked</text>
  <text start="1107.48" dur="3">about there there a little there are</text>
  <text start="1108.86" dur="3.18">some things that I hadn&amp;#39;t heard before</text>
  <text start="1110.48" dur="5.16">but what they&amp;#39;re focused on is what</text>
  <text start="1112.04" dur="6.84">people are covering and and I showed so</text>
  <text start="1115.64" dur="5.789">basically this is May 3rd which is like</text>
  <text start="1118.88" dur="4.14">a few weeks before he comes out with</text>
  <text start="1121.429" dur="4.171">this whole revelation which I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1123.02" dur="3.35">show you here at 3 minutes and 40</text>
  <text start="1125.6" dur="3.35">something</text>
  <text start="1126.37" dur="4.08">in the video that I did previously so</text>
  <text start="1128.95" dur="3.72">May 30 does a circuit</text>
  <text start="1130.45" dur="5.49">he&amp;#39;s got interview after interview on</text>

  <text start="1143.71" dur="5.76">time Roger stone associate and he he</text>
  <text start="1147.91" dur="3.06">basically says that Robert Muller is</text>
  <text start="1149.47" dur="3.45">really intensely looking into what</text>
  <text start="1150.97" dur="3.63">happened with WikiLeaks and then not</text>
  <text start="1152.92" dur="5.19">even two weeks later he comes out with</text>
  <text start="1154.6" dur="5.7">this story about how and and this story</text>
  <text start="1158.11" dur="6.21">comes out at the same time as Clovis&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1160.3" dur="6.36">help her connect and he says that an</text>
  <text start="1164.32" dur="5.72">intermediary came up to him with</text>
  <text start="1166.66" dur="3.38">information he got from someone else</text>
  <text start="1170.61" dur="6.1">actually I was approached by an</text>
  <text start="1173.02" dur="6.72">intermediary but who had been talking to</text>
  <text start="1176.71" dur="6.06">a government official a former</text>
  <text start="1179.74" dur="5.34">government official who told him that</text>
  <text start="1182.77" dur="4.83">they had Hillary Clinton related emails</text>

  <text start="1189.55" dur="5.49">Trump campaign this was May 6 that he</text>
  <text start="1192.429" dur="5.13">heard that and 2016 I was told by the</text>
  <text start="1195.04" dur="5.79">intermediary on May 9th that they wanted</text>
  <text start="1197.559" dur="6.75">to get them to me so what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="1200.83" dur="5.82">that he was dealing with an intermediary</text>
  <text start="1204.309" dur="5.491">who was dealing with someone who worked</text>
  <text start="1206.65" dur="7.529">at a government organization who told</text>

  <text start="1229.54" dur="3.69">Tower at the time whenever I got a call</text>
  <text start="1231.82" dur="3.12">from the intermediary I would walk</text>
  <text start="1233.23" dur="3.84">outside of the office I spent a lot of</text>
  <text start="1234.94" dur="3.93">time in the hallway outside of the fifth</text>

  <text start="1372.95" dur="4.8">revealed this conversation to anyone at</text>
  <text start="1375.47" dur="5.91">the Trump campaign I was uncomfortable</text>
  <text start="1377.75" dur="5.51">talking about it and I broke off contact</text>
  <text start="1381.38" dur="3.93">with that government organization</text>

  <text start="1414.03" dur="3.93">really just threw me for a loop and I</text>
  <text start="1416.34" dur="3">thought it made me look kind of kooky on</text>
  <text start="1417.96" dur="3.42">the first week when I came into the</text>
  <text start="1419.34" dur="3.93">campaign to tell them I had access to</text>

  <text start="1423.27" dur="4.59">then it became very frightening for me I</text>
  <text start="1425.79" dur="3.81">thought that it was you know it could be</text>
  <text start="1427.86" dur="6">a crime for me to take them into my own</text>

  <text start="1511.22" dur="6.21">say a word about it I find that super</text>
  <text start="1513.53" dur="6.81">super strange but I guess that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1517.43" dur="4.89">happened but I mean it seems like</text>
  <text start="1520.34" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s like little data being seeded on</text>
  <text start="1522.32" dur="4.14">all these little people whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1524.66" dur="3.75">involved in it or not it&amp;#39;s just a super</text>
  <text start="1526.46" dur="5.97">interesting thing and then the bombshell</text>
  <text start="1528.41" dur="10.11">for me with Caputo comes at the end of</text>
  <text start="1532.43" dur="8.01">this interview with Cavuto you raised</text>
  <text start="1538.52" dur="5.1">this issue with Muller&amp;#39;s team when they</text>

  <text start="1551.09" dur="3.03">mean you&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="1552.71" dur="3.39">possibility of someone from the outside</text>
  <text start="1554.12" dur="4.53">trying to penetrate the Trump</text>

  <text start="1577.19" dur="4.65">tell you Michael and they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1579.11" dur="3.809">interested at all in that well I was</text>
  <text start="1581.84" dur="2.309">really kind of Paul</text>
  <text start="1582.919" dur="3.661">up about this from the very beginning</text>
  <text start="1584.149" dur="4.38">because at first I didn&amp;#39;t even think</text>
  <text start="1586.58" dur="4.049">about it because when I was asked by the</text>

  <text start="1602.119" dur="8.341">offer me emails what yeah yeah and it</text>
  <text start="1608.359" dur="3.211">just gets better from there one more</text>
  <text start="1610.46" dur="1.74">little clip here and then we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1611.57" dur="2.91">get going</text>
  <text start="1612.2" dur="3.78">that there was at least one person who</text>
  <text start="1614.48" dur="3.529">was trying to penetrate the Trump</text>

  <text start="2237.66" dur="3.619">interesting thing about Caputo is the</text>
  <text start="2239.279" dur="4.861">reason why he left the campaign is</text>
  <text start="2241.279" dur="3.711">because he tweeted out something like</text>
