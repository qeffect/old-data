  <text start="3.51" dur="6.74">2nd 2017 at 10:28 a.m. Eastern Standard</text>
  <text start="6.66" dur="8.849">Time so a couple days ago I started</text>
  <text start="10.25" dur="7.18">posting that I had some concerns and</text>
  <text start="15.509" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of information and a lot</text>
  <text start="17.43" dur="7.88">of pretty solid information to suggest</text>
  <text start="20.039" dur="11.63">that the storm harvey the allah the</text>
  <text start="25.31" dur="9.67">hurricane was engineered in a way that</text>
  <text start="31.669" dur="9.521">caused it to be more deadly than normal</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="10.44">and that it was unnatural in its and its</text>
  <text start="41.19" dur="5.639">path in the way it strengthened etc and</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="3.209">there are several videos available</text>
  <text start="46.829" dur="4.221">online in regards to that that you guys</text>
  <text start="48.629" dur="6.66">can look at one including a nasa</text>
  <text start="51.05" dur="6.43">facility in texas seeding the clouds</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="5.04">with water vapor the day of the</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="5.489">hurricane making its appearance on the</text>
  <text start="60.329" dur="4.62">Texas coast and a number of other things</text>
  <text start="62.969" dur="2.641">but but what I found which was really</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="4.591">interesting</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="5.73">is that I had a number of people pretty</text>
  <text start="69.54" dur="4.41">much attack me and call me crazy for</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="3.599">suggesting even suggesting that there</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="4.05">could be such thing as weather</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="6.051">modification and that it could be used</text>
  <text start="78" dur="5.97">you know either for good or for evil and</text>
  <text start="80.99" dur="4.72">mocking me saying you know I was nuts so</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="2.85">I figured I would start to show you guys</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="3.39">that I&amp;#39;m not nuts</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="3.869">thank goodness for WikiLeaks again now</text>
  <text start="89.1" dur="4.019">I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of research today into</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="4.921">this and I&amp;#39;m gonna share with you some</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="5.04">tidbits that I found but anybody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="6.899">interested in really anything that you</text>
  <text start="98.159" dur="7.49">think might be a conspiracy theory can</text>
  <text start="102.509" dur="7.801">go to WikiLeaks and search the entire</text>
  <text start="105.649" dur="6.281">catalogue for terms that you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="3.18">for and I did it for a few terms</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="3.149">actually which kind of led me down a</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="3.75">tangent to find some other things and</text>
  <text start="115.079" dur="4.86">here we are with my search for weather</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="6.39">modification this exact phrase weather</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="8.811">modification and sure enough there are</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="8.89">like two thousand fifteen hundred or so</text>
  <text start="128.75" dur="6.26">1500 or so results</text>
  <text start="132.52" dur="5.46">and I&amp;#39;ve picked out some of the best</text>
  <text start="135.01" dur="7.17">ones here&amp;#39;s a cable from the public</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="9.59">library of US diplomacy from 1979 just</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="7.62">so think about that in 1979 they were</text>
  <text start="147.57" dur="5.95">contemplating the legal aspects of</text>
  <text start="149.8" dur="5.79">weather modification the reference</text>
  <text start="153.52" dur="5.25">meeting was held in Geneva of September</text>
  <text start="155.59" dur="5.73">17th to the 21st of 79 the following</text>
  <text start="158.77" dur="4.17">states were represented key agenda items</text>
  <text start="161.32" dur="4.47">included a review of the state of the</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="5.55">art water whether he agenda items</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="5.49">included review of the state of the art</text>
  <text start="168.49" dur="4.62">with of weather modification draft</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="3.09">principles of conduct for the guidance</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="3.51">of states concerning weather</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="5.46">modification experiments and operations</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="4.8">and most and they go through here and</text>
  <text start="179.83" dur="6.21">they they talked about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.42" dur="9.02">doing and whether or not it&amp;#39;s it you</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="8.94">know who owns the atmosphere above there</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="6.52">said nation states and what impact could</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="6.27">someone doing a weather modest parents</text>
  <text start="196.96" dur="5.97">in Washington have on kit Canada and and</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="3.69">who&amp;#39;s responsible and who takes care of</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="4.26">the you know the cost if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="5.16">problem and is it ethical to use this in</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="5.93">in terms of warfare and I cannot find</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="5.25">you know they talk about this very very</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="3.4">clearly in here they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="215.35" dur="3.39">determine whether or not they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="216.52" dur="3.84">to be using whether they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="218.74" dur="3.48">make a treaty to say you cannot use</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.77">weather modification as an act of war</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="4.29">but I can&amp;#39;t find that treaty so if</text>
  <text start="225.13" dur="5.67">anyone else can find it please let me</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="5.52">know basically here they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="230.8" dur="2.55">you know you need to give advance notice</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="5.96">when you&amp;#39;re going to be doing weather</text>
  <text start="233.35" dur="9.24">modification activities now this is 1979</text>
  <text start="237.99" dur="7.38">and if you think that they stopped doing</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="7.22">this in 1980 you&amp;#39;re out of your mind</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="4.44">hmm I looked up here to see who the</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="4.88">world</text>
  <text start="252.27" dur="7.11">meteorological congresses and it is a</text>
  <text start="255.83" dur="6.25">body that determines the policy of the</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="5.94">world mere meter meteorological</text>
  <text start="262.08" dur="4.59">organization each member seat and</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="3.54">territory is represented by a permanent</text>
  <text start="266.67" dur="4.14">representative with wmo when Congress</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="3.48">meets every four years Congress elects</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="3.48">the Presidents and vice presidents of</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="3.48">the organization and members of the</text>
  <text start="274.29" dur="3.36">Executive Council and appoints the</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="3.45">secretary-general how many of you guys</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="5.73">knew that there was basically a</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="18">governing body for the weather a global</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="17.34">governing body anyone that led me into</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="9.57">this one here the legal principles on</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="8.1">weather modification and they basically</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="7.41">go through the the guideline principles</text>
  <text start="308.82" dur="6.99">and states of the United States believes</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="3.42">that creation of an appropriate</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="3.6">international scientific framework for</text>
  <text start="317.67" dur="3.42">met weather modification could help to</text>
  <text start="319.41" dur="3.15">assist all countries to understand as</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="3.81">possibilities and limitations and to</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="3.78">coordinate and evaluate research efforts</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="3.72">in which interested countries could</text>
  <text start="326.34" dur="3.84">participate with regards to the draft</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="3.99">principles of conduct for the guidance</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="5.79">of states concerning whether mod we have</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="4.8">the following comments the United States</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="3.15">government in the past has notified</text>
  <text start="337.41" dur="3.81">countries which potentially may be</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="4.74">affected by major weather modification</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="4.23">activities it proposes to conduct the</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="3.54">United States would continue such</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="3.78">notification bilaterally wherever</text>
  <text start="347.4" dur="3.3">appropriate while complying also with</text>
  <text start="349.23" dur="4.8">principal force requirement to notify</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="6.57">the wmo which we just talked about so</text>
  <text start="354.03" dur="4.74">let me ask you a question it should be</text>
  <text start="357.27" dur="3.42">made clear that the principles apply to</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="3.93">modification activities conducted for</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="5.28">the purpose of rain and snow enhancement</text>
  <text start="362.7" dur="6.27">what fog dispersal or hurricane</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="5.01">amelioration for example and not to</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="3.45">inadvertent weather changes resulting</text>
  <text start="370.98" dur="4.02">from a high-altitude jet flights</text>
  <text start="372.42" dur="6.66">pollutants administrative forms emitted</text>
  <text start="375" dur="5.64">from small smokestacks etc now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="3.27">lot of interesting information in these</text>
  <text start="380.64" dur="3.96">things I&amp;#39;m just going to keep this as</text>
  <text start="382.35" dur="3.48">short as I can but I&amp;#39;m gonna link every</text>
  <text start="384.6" dur="1.47">single one of these below and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="6.68">going to</text>
  <text start="386.07" dur="9">get into these tabs just wait this one</text>
  <text start="392.51" dur="4.15">the primary objective of the subject</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="3.3">meeting was to consider whether the time</text>
  <text start="396.66" dur="2.85">was appropriate for adoption of a set of</text>
  <text start="398.37" dur="2.52">principles that would be followed by</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="5.43">States and carrying out weather</text>
  <text start="400.89" dur="5.55">modification activities the first</text>
  <text start="404.94" dur="3.66">meeting came to somewhat of a stalemate</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="3.78">because the scientist talking taking</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="4.23">part felt the scientific and technical</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="4.8">basis for whether mod was too insecure</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="3.81">to justify the formulation of specific</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="3.57">principles or restraints on such</text>
  <text start="416.64" dur="3.54">activities they felt it would be</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="3.63">difficult to define the prospects for</text>
  <text start="420.18" dur="3.81">and verification of weather modification</text>
  <text start="422.22" dur="5.31">activities that may be carried out</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="5.07">nevertheless the UNEP Secretariat in its</text>
  <text start="427.53" dur="3.24">follow-up of recommendations of</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="3.57">Stockholm felt it was important to keep</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="4.86">the subject under active discussion</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="9.6">they&amp;#39;re talking about this stuff this</text>
  <text start="435.63" dur="8.34">was Declassified in 2014 this provoked</text>
  <text start="442.23" dur="3.36">much discussion which revealed that such</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="3.42">a broad and general principle was not</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="3.51">readily applicable to the atmosphere and</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="3.48">could imply global responsibility over</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="4.08">the activities of any particular state</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="4.98">with respect to the atmosphere over its</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="4.98">territory so here they are arguing like</text>
  <text start="455.85" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re discussing anyway wealthy you know</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="4.86">if Russia engages in weather</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="4.74">modification that has some kind of a</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="4.56">consequence and who&amp;#39;s responsible for</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="4.23">taking care of the cost of that</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="5.49">consequence and you know as everything</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="6.18">goes they say in here you know we want</text>
  <text start="473.07" dur="6.33">to stop hurricanes we want to provide</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="6.47">rain to drought ridden areas but we all</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="3.59">know what happens next</text>
  <text start="483.23" dur="6.88">so I guess we&amp;#39;re getting clear now right</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="7.77">that weather</text>
  <text start="490.11" dur="4.71">is real and it exists so anyone who</text>
  <text start="493.74" dur="3">comes to you and says that you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="494.82" dur="4.43">crazy tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="6.72">theorists and yes we are gonna get into</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="5.62">chemtrails in a second anyone who says</text>
  <text start="503.46" dur="4.68">that you&amp;#39;re a crazy tinfoil hat wearing</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="5.61">conspiracy theorists can have their mind</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="4.26">blown by providing them a few of these</text>
  <text start="510.48" dur="8.1">links because if it didn&amp;#39;t exist they</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="10.08">want to be discussing policy here they</text>
  <text start="518.58" dur="12.66">are again detailing minutes of their</text>
  <text start="522.48" dur="9.99">meetings in private conversation half he</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="3.21">indicated that the Department of the</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="3.6">Environment had originally been excited</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="4.11">about proposed state of Washington</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="5.43">activities now this is oh this cable</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="5.88">here is in regards to Canada having a</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="5.31">discussion about some cloud seeding</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="6.3">weather mod activities that would be</text>
  <text start="546.81" dur="6">taking place in Washington State and how</text>
  <text start="550.74" dur="3.69">they would affect Canada and what they</text>
  <text start="552.81" dur="8.52">wanted to do in this it basically</text>
  <text start="554.43" dur="15.14">explains was they wanted to they wanted</text>
  <text start="561.33" dur="10.37">to you know cause rain but what</text>
  <text start="569.57" dur="3.48">so a natural weather system came by and</text>
  <text start="571.7" dur="3.63">they decided that they didn&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="3.75">it anymore because the natural my oh no</text>
  <text start="575.33" dur="5.4">they wanted to make snow my apologies</text>
  <text start="576.8" dur="5.43">the national model model ocation</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="2.97">activities took place so they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="5.69">need to do the weather mod anymore and</text>
  <text start="583.7" dur="10.389">it goes into a lot more detail in here</text>
  <text start="587.92" dur="18.05">next another can</text>
  <text start="594.089" dur="12.211">Canada Washington deal mmm this one here</text>
  <text start="605.97" dur="2.609">we go</text>
  <text start="606.3" dur="9.57">it&amp;#39;s about warfare this one I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="608.579" dur="9.091">read International Convention to</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="4.079">prohibit weather modification as a</text>

  <text start="623.61" dur="2.88">reach an early decision as to whether or</text>

  <text start="630.959" dur="4.44">we understand that NSC staff proposal on</text>
  <text start="633.72" dur="4.919">this subject was included in papers</text>
  <text start="635.399" dur="4.891">taken with you in your letter to Senator</text>
  <text start="638.639" dur="2.911">Pell of November 5th you repeated the</text>

  <text start="647.55" dur="5.19">be taking quote extremely seriously</text>
  <text start="649.649" dur="4.651">unquote you also assured him that you</text>
  <text start="652.74" dur="3.06">would look closely into this matter to</text>

  <text start="662.129" dur="2.94">an immediate decision to request an</text>

  <text start="668.73" dur="4.62">to your assurances to Senator Pell the</text>

  <text start="673.35" dur="4.289">a decision not to request an interagency</text>
