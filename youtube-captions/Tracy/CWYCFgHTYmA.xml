  <text start="113.579" dur="6.661">that the Department of Justice I think</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="5.79">that was run by John P Carlin and I</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="6.479">think think and I could be wrong his</text>

  <text start="130.56" dur="6.48">to move equipment over</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="6.33">and maybe were the people that requested</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="4.65">that they buy new equipment like it</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="3.89">looks like the Department of Justice</text>

  <text start="144.11" dur="9.1">Clinton&amp;#39;s team to buy new equipment for</text>
