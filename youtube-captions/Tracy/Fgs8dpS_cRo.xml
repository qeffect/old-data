  <text start="2.689" dur="8.971">2018 a 2:39 p.m. I am back after I took</text>
  <text start="8.73" dur="5.61">a few much-needed days kind of off</text>
  <text start="11.66" dur="4.869">disconnected from social media for the</text>
  <text start="14.34" dur="4.109">most part spend time with family kind of</text>
  <text start="16.529" dur="3.691">just recharged a little but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="18.449" dur="4.17">working for a while now on this piece</text>
  <text start="20.22" dur="4.08">about Papadopoulos because I really feel</text>
  <text start="22.619" dur="5.101">like and I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of time paying</text>
  <text start="24.3" dur="5.489">a lot of attention to Papadopoulos over</text>
  <text start="27.72" dur="3.389">the past year or so and I really feel</text>
  <text start="29.789" dur="2.811">like he&amp;#39;s a big piece of this puzzle</text>
  <text start="31.109" dur="3.931">given that the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="32.6" dur="5.01">investigation supposedly started in July</text>
  <text start="35.04" dur="6.03">based off Papadopoulos tis just</text>
  <text start="37.61" dur="6.57">Papadopoulos his discussions with joseph</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="7.28">Mifsud and Alexander Downer and</text>
  <text start="44.18" dur="7.71">undercover huber on Twitter did a</text>
  <text start="48.35" dur="6.97">masterful thread about Papadopoulos so</text>
  <text start="51.89" dur="5.29">yesterday I kind of scrapped where I was</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="3.6">and started like recalibrating</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="2.76">everything and I went down somewhat of a</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="2.58">rabbit hole that I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="4.679">documenting for all of you guys when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="61.5" dur="5.369">finished but I needed to stop and show</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="4.741">you something I found in the process of</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="5.04">me looking for other information I went</text>
  <text start="69.36" dur="4.65">into the page struck text messages to</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="5.85">look for something else and I stumbled a</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="5.46">I stumbled upon this message it is in</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="3.871">the I&amp;#39;ll put this link in the</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="3.75">description box for you guys I was going</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="4.919">through doing research yesterday in a</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="4.68">live stream for my patrons because a lot</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="4.14">of them were asking like what&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="87.9" dur="4.53">process how do you do things and if they</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="4.231">were watching that live stream yesterday</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="5.91">they saw that I kind of bounced around a</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="5.82">lot but and that&amp;#39;s why I found this so</text>
  <text start="98.34" dur="4.11">you know you open up one one container</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="3.36">and you go in there and then you find a</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="4.169">tunnel and you go through the tunnel and</text>
  <text start="104.1" dur="4.17">you end up you know somewhere else which</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="5.151">is why it takes so long to do this stuff</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="8.699">sometimes but I found this text message</text>
  <text start="111.77" dur="6.37">and I did a thread on it sometimes when</text>
  <text start="116.969" dur="3">you&amp;#39;re investigating one thing you end</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="3.409">up stumbling into something so big and</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="4.65">damning you have to pinch yourself</text>
  <text start="121.549" dur="6.28">inside of the struct page text messages</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="7.821">lies this little gem which was sent on</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="7.071">April 30th 2016 it&amp;#39;s right here</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="4.86">it says and now we&amp;#39;ve switched from the</text>
  <text start="134.9" dur="6.21">Patriot Act to a wire carrying current</text>
  <text start="137.3" dur="7.14">and then it&amp;#39;s redacted now I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s under this redaction I also know</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="6.39">just to kind of put this out there that</text>
  <text start="146.57" dur="6.33">the periods and the grammatical you know</text>
  <text start="150.83" dur="5.67">the way these people use words and</text>
  <text start="152.9" dur="5.01">grammatical Punk you know correctness if</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s what you want to call it it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="4.11">always right so it&amp;#39;s hard for me to</text>
  <text start="159.53" dur="3.75">discern if this is the end of a sentence</text>
  <text start="162.02" dur="4.5">while you&amp;#39;re carrying current or if</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s more but basically I say so now</text>
  <text start="166.52" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;ve switched from the Patriot Act to a</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="4.95">wire carrying current redacted hold the</text>
  <text start="170.96" dur="3.93">boat so the Patriot Act is the broad</text>
  <text start="173.18" dur="4.17">legislation that the government used to</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="5.06">conduct much of its eavesdropping via</text>
  <text start="177.35" dur="5.37">702 queries on the American public and</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="4.48">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s campaign so we know that</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="4.86">because of the valiant efforts of</text>
  <text start="184.43" dur="6.24">Admiral Rogers the 702 queries were</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="6.15">abruptly halted on April 18 2016</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="5.31">when widespread and suspicious abuse of</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="4.11">power was found abuse we have widely</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="5.55">attributed to contractors and others in</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="5.64">the Spygate scandal and here you say it</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="7.35">this is from within the two thousand</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="8.55">seventeen ninety nine page oversight</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="7.04">document into this problem that Admiral</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="6.75">Mike Rogers found when he was at the NSA</text>
  <text start="215.92" dur="4.81">it says here the FBI discontinued the</text>
  <text start="218.78" dur="6.51">above described access to raw FISA</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="6.509">information as of April 18 2016 and then</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="7.35">he began his audit to figure out what</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="8.311">was going on and we had the we had the</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="6.87">resignation of the Obama State the Obama</text>
  <text start="235.55" dur="5.88">appointee right after this so FISA</text>
  <text start="239.51" dur="4.199">searches can be conducted on any foreign</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="4.74">person without issue when a FISA search</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="5.161">returns data identifying a US citizen</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="6.15">everything changes those like changes</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="9.39">are the identifying term 702 a 702 is an</text>
  <text start="252.32" dur="7.169">American person so we know basically let</text>
  <text start="258.26" dur="2.67">me just keep reading this all US</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="2.881">citizens are protected by the Fourth</text>
  <text start="260.93" dur="3.9">Amendment against unlawful search and</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="3.69">seizure all searches of US people must</text>
  <text start="264.83" dur="3.059">have a valid reason</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.57">title three says any search for a</text>
  <text start="267.889" dur="4.201">potential criminal investigation must</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="4.17">have a warrant additionally any criminal</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="4.26">search of the FISA database must also</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="4.86">have a warrant any FISA searches of</text>
  <text start="276.35" dur="4.319">foreign subjects may need FISA court</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="5.87">approval if the returned data includes a</text>
  <text start="280.669" dur="7.131">u.s. subject or 702 so we know that</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="6.76">there was widespread abuse of this 702</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="7.15">system by what we were able to determine</text>
  <text start="291.29" dur="8.46">were government contractors as well as</text>
  <text start="294.95" dur="7.2">in you know the NSD in the FBI we were</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="4.59">able to figure that out using that April</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="4.98">report and there has been a lot of</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="5.43">speculation and and some concrete proof</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="5.64">that Fuzion GPS was a government</text>
  <text start="309.77" dur="5.43">contractor and it&amp;#39;s because in the 99</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="4.95">page report we have on page 83 the FBI</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="4.56">gave Ross section 702 acquired</text>
  <text start="317.72" dur="4.38">information to a private entity that was</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="4.08">not a federal agency and whose personnel</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="3.15">were not sufficiently supervised by a</text>
  <text start="323.84" dur="12.66">federal agency for compliance</text>
  <text start="325.25" dur="13.89">minimization procedures so what I</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="4.47">basically just read is an admission by</text>
  <text start="339.14" dur="4.77">struck that they were forced to stop</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="5.49">using the Patriot Act 702 and switched</text>
  <text start="343.91" dur="4.259">to using a wire carrying current now</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="3.209">originally I was thinking that was a</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="5.461">person which I still think it may be a</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="6">person a spying informant I say if this</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="3.45">is true it completely blows the entire</text>
  <text start="355.669" dur="3.541">Papadopoulos started the investigation</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="4.89">in July in July Theory out of the damn</text>
  <text start="359.21" dur="5.62">water the way I read this is the way I</text>
  <text start="361.97" dur="6.71">read the text is</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="7.53">basically they were using that</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="6.449">unfettered access to 7:02 data and then</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="4.929">Roger stopped it in April and then they</text>
  <text start="375.129" dur="4.951">were like crap there&amp;#39;s no way for us to</text>
  <text start="377.289" dur="4.111">spy anymore the whole process is halted</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="2.64">while they try to figure out what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="5.82">going on here because they found the</text>
  <text start="382.72" dur="6.15">abuse so they had to do something else</text>
  <text start="387.22" dur="4.5">to get their information and to get</text>
  <text start="388.87" dur="4.56">their you know data so what did they do</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="4.409">they either had to use a human source</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="4.139">they had to wiretap they had to whatever</text>
  <text start="396.129" dur="5.82">else they decided that they were gonna</text>
  <text start="397.569" dur="6.6">do to get inside and then they had to</text>
  <text start="401.949" dur="3.72">get something to back up their reasoning</text>
  <text start="404.169" dur="3.21">for doing this just in case in the</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="2.43">unlikely events that they were caught</text>
  <text start="407.379" dur="3.72">doing it</text>
  <text start="408.099" dur="5.19">hence steel and the dossier several</text>
  <text start="411.099" dur="5.28">different layers I&amp;#39;m working on a piece</text>
  <text start="413.289" dur="6.231">right now that is kind of showing the</text>
  <text start="416.379" dur="6.901">circle between the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="419.52" dur="6.399">Papadopoulos and how they used this</text>
  <text start="423.28" dur="3.93">information and this this story that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="425.919" dur="2.851">putting together is gonna be really big</text>
  <text start="427.21" dur="3.75">but it couples in here</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="3.6">so a lot of people have asked me</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="3.66">couldn&amp;#39;t they be talking about another</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="4.44">investigation I would have agreed with</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="4.169">that and it could but you know maybe</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s true but I doubt it because these</text>
  <text start="438.789" dur="6.6">text messages that I&amp;#39;m looking through</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="7.56">here were released by the OIG Michael</text>
  <text start="445.389" dur="4.291">Horowitz who has a very sort of a sort</text>
  <text start="448" dur="3.87">of narrow scope so if these are under</text>
  <text start="449.68" dur="4.47">the purview of his investigation then</text>
  <text start="451.87" dur="4.949">they have to do with Clinton Trump etc</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="5.15">so that&amp;#39;s where we got the insurance</text>
  <text start="456.819" dur="5.581">policy from that&amp;#39;s where we got the</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="4.419">hatred for Trump and the bias and a</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="2.54">couple of other people that I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="463.719" dur="3.42">to we&amp;#39;re working through some</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="4.719">information right now off of this same</text>
  <text start="467.139" dur="4.59">tangent that will kind of clarify some</text>
  <text start="469.659" dur="4.021">of this as well so I think that this is</text>
  <text start="471.729" dur="8.37">a really big deal again I just kind of</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="8.459">found it accidentally and in the text</text>
  <text start="480.099" dur="3.72">write you know a day after that they say</text>
  <text start="482.139" dur="3.39">by the way they&amp;#39;ve decided they&amp;#39;ve all</text>
  <text start="483.819" dur="3.991">decided in-person meetings are much</text>
  <text start="485.529" dur="7.23">better for us than blank and separate</text>
  <text start="487.81" dur="6.57">and dialing in so there&amp;#39;s a lot in here</text>
  <text start="492.759" dur="4.201">that I think because there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="494.38" dur="3.3">messages there&amp;#39;s 473 pages of these</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="1.86">things and like</text>
