  <text start="171.3" dur="6.84">one of the sharyl Attkisson series you</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="3.96">guys saw the introduction and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.14" dur="4.47">gonna do today is go through the</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="7.35">complaint now I had just recorded a 45</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="6.06">minute long video where I literally read</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="3.68">this entire complaint and through the</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="4.59">entire thing I was thinking to myself</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="5.38">people are gonna get so bored listening</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="3.84">to this it&amp;#39;s not boring but I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="3.6">that you guys want to hear me read for</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="4.95">45 minutes so what I decided to do</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="4.32">instead was a summary and especially so</text>
  <text start="202.05" dur="3.659">because as soon as I want to throw this</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="4.41">to kind of convert it for YouTube I</text>
  <text start="205.709" dur="4.471">realized that I was recording the wrong</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="3.33">monitor so you guys were seeing my notes</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="3.809">instead of what I was showing on screen</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="4.5">and that wouldn&amp;#39;t have been fun so I</text>
  <text start="213.989" dur="4.381">left I took a deep breath I went</text>
  <text start="215.97" dur="6.66">downstairs I relaxed for a second</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="7.29">cleared my head and here we are here we</text>
  <text start="222.63" dur="5.76">are again so I&amp;#39;m gonna summarize I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="6.72">read some points of it and the rest will</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="5.79">be summarized for you during all of this</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="3.42">all of the dates and stuff that she goes</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="5.13">through in this complaint about fast and</text>
  <text start="235.8" dur="6.39">furious and Benghazi and spying on her</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="5.73">the spying that happened to her she was</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="5.37">working for CBS News so they go through</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="5.25">a listing here of one her first report</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="6.6">aired which was on February 22nd 2011</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="8.419">and then they talked about how in 2011</text>
  <text start="254.16" dur="8.46">in the ATF an internal memo basically</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="6.911">came out where they instigated a</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="4.29">campaign against her including efforts</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="3.81">to discredit her report</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="6.09">and outlined a strategy for the ATF to</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="6.36">push quote positive stories to preempt</text>
  <text start="273" dur="4.98">negative reporting and I have that memo</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="10.43">here for you guys to read and look at</text>
  <text start="277.98" dur="11.46">which we will and here it is</text>
  <text start="286.22" dur="7.03">Cheryl writes the report here and in it</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="6.72">is this memo from Scott Thomason who is</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="4.68">the Public Affairs Division Chief and he</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="3.9">says make every effort for the next two</text>
  <text start="297.93" dur="4.2">weeks to maximize coverage of ATF</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="3.56">operations enforcement actions and</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="4.05">arrests at the local and regional level</text>
  <text start="303.62" dur="4.6">given the negative coverage by CBS</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="3.99">Evening News last week and upcoming</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="4.11">events this week the bureau should look</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="4.62">for every opportunity to push coverage</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="4.23">of good stories and fortunately the CBS</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="3.48">story has not sparked any follow up</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="4.08">coverage by mainstream media and seems</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="4.56">to have fizzled and it says here at the</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="4.17">bottom ATF needs to proactively push</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="4.77">positive stories this week in an effort</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="5.01">to preempt some negative reporting or at</text>
  <text start="327.6" dur="4.65">minimum lessen the coverage of such</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="6">stories in the news cycle by replacing</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="5.19">them with good stories about 80s the</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="3.15">more time we spend highlighting the</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="3.42">great work of the agents through press</text>
  <text start="338.97" dur="3.69">releases and various media outreaches in</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="2.46">the coming days and weeks the better off</text>
  <text start="342.66" dur="4.56">we will be</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="5.76">in other words propagandize let&amp;#39;s try</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="3.51">and drown out all of that stuff by</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="3.84">getting this stuff too friendly media</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="6.11">people and then we will be much better</text>
  <text start="352.92" dur="6.6">off but she persisted</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="5.32">she keeps reporting on fast and furious</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="5.46">and DOJ officials persist in their</text>
  <text start="362.16" dur="4.5">denial of the allegations and continued</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="4.53">efforts to unveil Masaka syns</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="4.83">confidential sources ATF sources told</text>
  <text start="369.51" dur="3.72">her the agency was actively seeking to</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="3.9">identify government insiders who were</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="5.76">providing her information or leaking to</text>
  <text start="375.39" dur="6.18">CBS also in September of 2011 she</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="4.5">reported on secret audio recordings that</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="3.51">implicated the FBI in an alleged</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="3.57">discrepancy in its accounting of</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="5.55">evidence in the Fast and Furious related</text>
  <text start="387.06" dur="5.88">murder of Brian Terry Brian Terry was</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="6.45">the border patrol agent he was killed</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="7.499">with a weapon that was run through the</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="5.819">bureau of through the ATF down to Mexico</text>
  <text start="400.439" dur="6.72">those weapons are now ending up all</text>
  <text start="402.899" dur="6">kinds of places it&amp;#39;s crazy so she</text>
  <text start="407.159" dur="3.3">actually had a whole bunch of secret</text>
  <text start="408.899" dur="6.181">recordings that she released but this</text>
  <text start="410.459" dur="6.27">one was one of the ones that um this one</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="3.239">was one of the ones that really kind of</text>
  <text start="416.729" dur="4.47">struck my fancy and one of the ones I</text>
  <text start="418.319" dur="4.981">found if I can ever get to it and if you</text>
  <text start="421.199" dur="4.47">read the excerpts that she gives here</text>
  <text start="423.3" dur="4.229">the audio recordings don&amp;#39;t seem to be</text>
  <text start="425.669" dur="4.17">available anymore but if you read the</text>
  <text start="427.529" dur="5.01">expert excerpts in this one particularly</text>
  <text start="429.839" dur="6.15">it is a dealer who participated in fast</text>
  <text start="432.539" dur="6.72">and furious talking to an FBI agent who</text>
  <text start="435.989" dur="5.16">also was participating in it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.259" dur="4.351">talking about hoping that there won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="441.149" dur="4.56">a subpoena for them from Grassley and</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re saying basically Grassley is</text>
  <text start="445.709" dur="3.2">only caring about this because he wants</text>
  <text start="447.209" dur="3.75">to make himself look better look</text>
  <text start="448.909" dur="3.58">Grassley has been in the Senate for god</text>
  <text start="450.959" dur="4.68">knows how long okay he doesn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="452.489" dur="4.74">make himself look better they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="455.639" dur="4.05">about how they can play politics it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.229" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s really I mean it&amp;#39;s damning and</text>
  <text start="459.689" dur="3.84">Cheryl is getting all this information</text>
  <text start="461.129" dur="6.9">she&amp;#39;s publishing it so the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.529" dur="6.48">really not happy she reports on those</text>
  <text start="468.029" dur="4.23">audio recordings she reports on the</text>
  <text start="470.009" dur="5.041">involvement of an FBI informant in the</text>
  <text start="472.259" dur="4.83">matter she reports on the continuing</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="3.719">controversy of the evidence accounting</text>
  <text start="477.089" dur="3.72">she reports on the evidence</text>
  <text start="478.769" dur="3.99">contradicting holders sworn testimony</text>
  <text start="480.809" dur="3.72">that he claimed that he had only heard</text>
  <text start="482.759" dur="5.34">of fast and furious for the first time</text>
  <text start="484.529" dur="7.081">in the past couple weeks and the memo</text>
  <text start="488.099" dur="5.82">that she puts out basically proves that</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="5.339">that&amp;#39;s not true this is from 2010</text>
  <text start="493.919" dur="6.75">November 1st it is a weekly report which</text>
  <text start="496.949" dur="6.54">was given to holder and in it they</text>
  <text start="500.669" dur="4.53">mentioned fast and furious by name the</text>
  <text start="503.489" dur="3.39">ceiling in this other case they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.199" dur="3.63">saying will last until another</text>
  <text start="506.879" dur="4.86">investigation Operation Fast and Furious</text>
  <text start="508.829" dur="4.471">is ready for takedown so the reason why</text>
  <text start="511.739" dur="3.691">I&amp;#39;m going through this is because the</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="5.07">complaint is seeking to establish that</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="4.589">Cheryl åkesson was releasing damning</text>

  <text start="561.569" dur="5.791">attempts or attempts over a period of a</text>
  <text start="563.759" dur="5.58">year in January of 2012 they contacted</text>
  <text start="567.36" dur="6.089">Verizon again about the ongoing problems</text>
  <text start="569.339" dur="5.791">and she had it because the the service</text>
  <text start="573.449" dur="2.791">was dropping off all the time and that</text>
  <text start="575.13" dur="3.81">was something that she had an experience</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="4.74">before and in response to that they sent</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="4.44">brand-new a brand new router out to her</text>
  <text start="580.98" dur="6.12">which was installed and that didn&amp;#39;t fix</text>
  <text start="583.38" dur="5.449">the problems either and then in 2012 is</text>
  <text start="587.1" dur="5.539">when things really start to get hairy an</text>

  <text start="646.11" dur="8.52">to show you guys what that is the SMB</text>
  <text start="649.949" dur="8.901">client is basically it&amp;#39;s a command line</text>

  <text start="661.62" dur="3.449">what it says here is all you&amp;#39;ll need to</text>
  <text start="663.149" dur="4.661">do it is a machine that can run SMB</text>

  <text start="729.389" dur="3.7">it was a government address that</text>

  <text start="733.089" dur="4.92">it wasn&amp;#39;t specifically the postal</text>

  <text start="738.009" dur="7.44">some detail about that technical detail</text>
  <text start="740.559" dur="7.14">and then they say that the address that</text>

  <text start="762.579" dur="5.461">this case the Intel corporation&amp;#39;s AMT</text>
  <text start="765.91" dur="4.969">software and so I did a little bit of</text>
  <text start="768.04" dur="6.69">digging on that and I was able to find</text>
  <text start="770.879" dur="5.71">several different things first I found</text>
  <text start="774.73" dur="5.19">an article just to give you guys</text>
  <text start="776.589" dur="7.23">reference on how zero-day exploits work</text>
  <text start="779.92" dur="6.509">and you can see they call it a zero-day</text>
  <text start="783.819" dur="4.471">exploit because developers have zero</text>
  <text start="786.429" dur="4.08">days to fix the problem that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="788.29" dur="4.32">exposed and that hackers probably could</text>
  <text start="790.509" dur="4.531">have already exploited that problem so</text>
  <text start="792.61" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s a immediate oh my gosh we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="795.04" dur="6.6">have time to fix this sort of a thing</text>
  <text start="796.3" dur="14.7">and then the intel amt vulnerable</text>
  <text start="801.64" dur="12.06">be how intel amt vulnerability allows to</text>
  <text start="811" dur="6.17">hack computers remotely and they go</text>
  <text start="813.7" dur="3.47">through it in this article how it works</text>
  <text start="817.3" dur="2.73">and what was interesting to me is</text>
  <text start="818.89" dur="4.59">something just kind of off the cuff that</text>
  <text start="820.03" dur="5.97">I remembered this was supposedly put on</text>
  <text start="823.48" dur="6.12">a chain by an Intel insider who talks</text>
  <text start="826" dur="4.95">about exactly how this is done he says I</text>
  <text start="829.6" dur="3.27">know exactly how it was done cuz I spent</text>
  <text start="830.95" dur="4.08">the last three years adding back doors</text>

  <text start="859.15" dur="5.94">thing that I found that really kind of</text>

  <text start="952.739" dur="5.85">April and May of 2012 the DOJ and FBI</text>
  <text start="955.619" dur="4.65">announced this new effort to expand</text>

  <text start="977.639" dur="4.62">was later revealed now what came into my</text>
  <text start="980.549" dur="4.171">mind immediately was an article that I</text>
  <text start="982.259" dur="5.07">read from John Solomon the other day in</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="4.919">it he talked us about how the Justice</text>

  <text start="992.549" dur="4.111">journalists for those leaks at the same</text>
  <text start="993.959" dur="8.55">time basically what he says in here is</text>
  <text start="996.66" dur="7.589">that as an investigative journalist for</text>

  <text start="1011.6" dur="4.62">robert muller the same one subpoenaed</text>
  <text start="1014.269" dur="4.59">his phone records without notifying him</text>
  <text start="1016.22" dur="4.44">or AP and then they delayed notifying</text>
  <text start="1018.859" dur="5.1">him so that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="1020.66" dur="6.749">report before Muller was confirmed as</text>
  <text start="1023.959" dur="6.84">FBI director now why is that important</text>
  <text start="1027.409" dur="6">because he was if you remember being</text>
  <text start="1030.799" dur="5.88">reconfirmed as FBI director outside of</text>
  <text start="1033.409" dur="5.91">the tenure he had already hit so that</text>
  <text start="1036.679" dur="4.441">was a big kind of to do and they</text>
  <text start="1039.319" dur="4.651">actually had to write new legislation</text>
  <text start="1041.12" dur="4.35">for it he said there was an outcry but</text>
  <text start="1043.97" dur="3.419">it didn&amp;#39;t stop justice from further</text>
  <text start="1045.47" dur="4.86">intrusion a few months after they took</text>
  <text start="1047.389" dur="6.871">his phone records they seized his mail</text>
  <text start="1050.33" dur="5.64">when FBI was the boss of the FBI they</text>
  <text start="1054.26" dur="3.539">didn&amp;#39;t use a subpoena or warrant for</text>
  <text start="1055.97" dur="3.87">that they used some concept known as</text>

  <text start="1076.82" dur="6.54">subpoena and when it didn&amp;#39;t arrive he</text>
  <text start="1081.02" dur="4.41">got suspicious and he proved that the</text>
  <text start="1083.36" dur="3.93">FBI took it illegally when they were</text>
  <text start="1085.43" dur="4.47">confronted they admitted they did it and</text>
  <text start="1087.29" dur="4.8">the DOJ and the AP lawyers worked</text>
  <text start="1089.9" dur="5.37">together to put rules in place to avoid</text>
  <text start="1092.09" dur="4.8">those types of abuses but his case he</text>
  <text start="1095.27" dur="3.87">says shows that even though rules are in</text>
  <text start="1096.89" dur="5.67">place the DOJ and the FBI have a means</text>
  <text start="1099.14" dur="6.48">and a motive to and a will to trample on</text>
  <text start="1102.56" dur="5.4">the rights of a free press and people in</text>

  <text start="1118.67" dur="4.31">about here and it was interesting to me</text>
  <text start="1120.71" dur="6.84">that Salomon just put that report out</text>
  <text start="1122.98" dur="6.37">they talked about how they refreshed the</text>

  <text start="1556.9" dur="4.14">you guys to listen to but I&amp;#39;ll listen</text>
  <text start="1558.61" dur="3.99">listen to the next part what James Rosen</text>
  <text start="1561.04" dur="3.69">is going through at Fox News right now</text>
  <text start="1562.6" dur="5.31">apparently well I don&amp;#39;t know details</text>
  <text start="1564.73" dur="5.819">have hit his you know I know only know</text>
  <text start="1567.91" dur="4.74">what I&amp;#39;ve read but I would say that I</text>
  <text start="1570.549" dur="5.221">think there could be some relationship</text>
  <text start="1572.65" dur="8.81">between these types of things and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1575.77" dur="9.99">happened to me you&amp;#39;ve been digging so</text>
  <text start="1581.46" dur="6.52">after that um in June the next month the</text>
  <text start="1585.76" dur="4.2">independent firm that CBS brought in to</text>
  <text start="1587.98" dur="3.87">take a look confirms that there was a</text>
  <text start="1589.96" dur="4.41">highly sophisticated and intrusion into</text>
  <text start="1591.85" dur="4.89">her computer as well as remote actions</text>
  <text start="1594.37" dur="4.88">to delete evidence of the intrusion</text>
  <text start="1596.74" dur="5.13">then on June 11th CBS News put out a</text>
  <text start="1599.25" dur="4.63">statement based on that report</text>
  <text start="1601.87" dur="4.29">confirming that her computer was</text>
  <text start="1603.88" dur="5.31">accessed by an unauthorized external</text>
  <text start="1606.16" dur="7.25">unknown party during 2012 and that they</text>
  <text start="1609.19" dur="10.23">used sophisticated methods and the</text>
  <text start="1613.41" dur="8.38">statement is here a cybersecurity firm</text>
  <text start="1619.42" dur="4.4">hired by CBS News has determined through</text>
  <text start="1621.79" dur="4.19">forensic analysis that sharyl Attkisson</text>
  <text start="1623.82" dur="4.359">computer was accessed by an unauthorized</text>
  <text start="1625.98" dur="5.44">external unknown party on multiple</text>
  <text start="1628.179" dur="5.13">occasions late in 2012 evidence suggests</text>
  <text start="1631.42" dur="3.93">this party performed all access from</text>
  <text start="1633.309" dur="3.571">Oatley using her accounts while no</text>
  <text start="1635.35" dur="3.63">malicious code was found forensic</text>
  <text start="1636.88" dur="3.57">analysis revealed an intruder had</text>
  <text start="1638.98" dur="4.05">executed commands that appeared to</text>
  <text start="1640.45" dur="4.5">involve search and exfiltration of data</text>
  <text start="1643.03" dur="4.2">this party also used sophisticated</text>
  <text start="1644.95" dur="4.53">methods to remove all possible</text>
  <text start="1647.23" dur="4.47">indications of an unauthorized activity</text>
  <text start="1649.48" dur="4.89">and alter system times to cause further</text>
  <text start="1651.7" dur="4.5">confusion CBS News is taking steps to</text>
  <text start="1654.37" dur="6">identify the responsible party and their</text>
  <text start="1656.2" dur="7.17">method of access so the IG asks for a</text>
  <text start="1660.37" dur="8.76">copy of that report and wants to examine</text>
  <text start="1663.37" dur="7.41">the laptop CBS says know what CBS says</text>
  <text start="1669.13" dur="7.25">no they don&amp;#39;t want they don&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="1670.78" dur="7.98">to and this is where I think CBS got</text>
  <text start="1676.38" dur="7.049">scolded and said do you better not play</text>
  <text start="1678.76" dur="8.28">ball here otherwise we&amp;#39;ll have problems</text>
  <text start="1683.429" dur="6.761">that&amp;#39;s where I think it happened so she</text>
  <text start="1687.04" dur="7.46">keeps going September she keeps working</text>
  <text start="1690.19" dur="4.31">on Benghazi she&amp;#39;s home in the evening</text>
  <text start="1694.65" dur="8.2">her MacBook Air is sitting in front of</text>
  <text start="1697.27" dur="7.62">her and she sees craziness this is the</text>
  <text start="1702.85" dur="4.11">video now she was attacked incessantly</text>
  <text start="1704.89" dur="5.16">for this video everybody&amp;#39;s saying how</text>
  <text start="1706.96" dur="6.03">stupid she was the delete key was just</text>
  <text start="1710.05" dur="4.59">stuck I just ran up the stairs you guys</text>
  <text start="1712.99" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t know that but I did I&amp;#39;m the delete</text>
  <text start="1714.64" dur="4.56">key was stuck she wasn&amp;#39;t able to you</text>
  <text start="1717.67" dur="4.17">know it&amp;#39;s just her it&amp;#39;s her own</text>
  <text start="1719.2" dur="5.87">craziness and Media Matters and everyone</text>
  <text start="1721.84" dur="3.23">went after her but let&amp;#39;s just watch</text>
  <text start="1784.81" dur="3.15">touching it</text>
  <text start="1793.15" dur="3.62">just deleting everything</text>
  <text start="1797.09" dur="3.049">I&amp;#39;m not touching it</text>
  <text start="1822.74" dur="4.6">so you can argue that that was just some</text>
  <text start="1825.87" dur="4.05">weird glitch that that was like</text>
  <text start="1827.34" dur="3.9">something odd it wasn&amp;#39;t really hackers I</text>
  <text start="1829.92" dur="3.36">mean you can make that argument I</text>
  <text start="1831.24" dur="3.09">probably not knowing any of the other</text>
  <text start="1833.28" dur="2.94">things that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="1834.33" dur="6.5">today I would say the same thing however</text>
  <text start="1836.22" dur="7.71">it just gets weirder from there so in</text>
  <text start="1840.83" dur="5.47">that month in June I&amp;#39;m sorry of 2013</text>
  <text start="1843.93" dur="4.47">they weren&amp;#39;t aware of it but the FBI had</text>
  <text start="1846.3" dur="4.89">started investigating her computer</text>
  <text start="1848.4" dur="7.59">intrusions under the auspices of some</text>
  <text start="1851.19" dur="7.14">national security inquiry or problem and</text>
  <text start="1855.99" dur="3.96">they didn&amp;#39;t contact her or interview any</text>
  <text start="1858.33" dur="4.05">of the people on the lawsuit they only</text>
  <text start="1859.95" dur="4.65">discovered it because they appealed a</text>
  <text start="1862.38" dur="6.72">denial of a FOIA request that they had</text>
  <text start="1864.6" dur="7.02">made and that investigation had been</text>
  <text start="1869.1" dur="4.89">circulated to the DOJ z-- national cyber</text>
  <text start="1871.62" dur="4.8">security group and included with a set</text>
  <text start="1873.99" dur="4.41">of cases opened in 2012 during the</text>
  <text start="1876.42" dur="3.96">expansion of the team and the</text>
  <text start="1878.4" dur="3.81">announcement of its intention to use new</text>
  <text start="1880.38" dur="5.76">tools in its arsenal</text>
  <text start="1882.21" dur="6.84">so again although CBS didn&amp;#39;t release the</text>
  <text start="1886.14" dur="6.03">the computer to the Inspector General or</text>
  <text start="1889.05" dur="5.4">the report miss åkesson agreed to</text>
  <text start="1892.17" dur="7.29">release her personal desktop computer to</text>
  <text start="1894.45" dur="8.49">the DOJ for video day id IG for analysis</text>
  <text start="1899.46" dur="5.61">and during that investigation they told</text>
  <text start="1902.94" dur="4.83">her like when when they went there and</text>
  <text start="1905.07" dur="4.89">started looking that they saw a lot of</text>
  <text start="1907.77" dur="4.2">suspicious activity on the computer but</text>
  <text start="1909.96" dur="3.99">as months went by they wouldn&amp;#39;t release</text>
  <text start="1911.97" dur="6.12">a report to her and they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1913.95" dur="6.3">respond to her FOIA requests on the</text>
  <text start="1918.09" dur="6.45">topic either and they finally released a</text>
  <text start="1920.25" dur="6.15">partial report when there was it was</text>
  <text start="1924.54" dur="3.75">basically the night before her</text>
  <text start="1926.4" dur="4.44">congressional testimony to a Senate</text>
  <text start="1928.29" dur="4.83">panel in early 2015 and I remember this</text>
  <text start="1930.84" dur="4.26">and they released the report and the</text>
  <text start="1933.12" dur="3.96">report is kind of a joke although the</text>
  <text start="1935.1" dur="3.81">summary notes a great deal of advanced</text>
  <text start="1937.08" dur="5.76">mode computer activity not attributable</text>
  <text start="1938.91" dur="5.85">to her they say it found no evidence of</text>
  <text start="1942.84" dur="5.1">intrusion in her personal Apple computer</text>
  <text start="1944.76" dur="5.94">and it was provided to the press the OIG</text>
  <text start="1947.94" dur="4.11">report was given to the press and here</text>
  <text start="1950.7" dur="3.03">it is and I&amp;#39;m not going to go through it</text>
  <text start="1952.05" dur="3.479">for you because it&amp;#39;s long</text>
  <text start="1953.73" dur="4.199">for no reason they basically go through</text>
  <text start="1955.529" dur="4.37">how the fact that CBS News didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1957.929" dur="4.441">provide the things they were asking for</text>
  <text start="1959.899" dur="7.451">really screwed them up in terms of them</text>
