  <text start="9" dur="5.099">mowing it&amp;#39;s that time of year springtime</text>
  <text start="12.179" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s good stuff I just want to put</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="4.561">something up here to kind of bolster</text>
  <text start="16.5" dur="3.449">what my last video said and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="2.97">something that was glossed over very</text>
  <text start="19.949" dur="4.651">quickly I didn&amp;#39;t hear this interview</text>
  <text start="21.63" dur="4.95">until today and it&amp;#39;s thanks to name</text>
  <text start="24.6" dur="4.38">redacted seven who retweeted the threat</text>
  <text start="26.58" dur="4.98">I did to couple with my last video</text>
  <text start="28.98" dur="3.93">Donna Willett at Miz Donna said good</text>
  <text start="31.56" dur="2.76">luck mentioned the grand jury was</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="4.829">impaneled yesterday in his radio</text>
  <text start="34.32" dur="5.97">interview with Sean Hannity so shut up</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="5.64">malware I found the radio interview</text>
  <text start="40.29" dur="8.28">thanks to some really good people on my</text>

  <text start="56.879" dur="3.241">please link it below and you guys came</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="4.891">through in stunning fashion so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="5.52">just play the section of the interview</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="3.63">where he mentions the grand jury and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="65.64" dur="3.5">going to mute this so you can actually</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="2.33">hear it</text>
  <text start="70.99" dur="6.519">this I think should be made available as</text>
  <text start="75.259" dur="4.65">soon as possible but I&amp;#39;m still hoping</text>
  <text start="77.509" dur="4.741">that we&amp;#39;ll see it by the before the end</text>
  <text start="79.909" dur="4.861">of April but it is a little later than</text>
  <text start="82.25" dur="3.99">we had hoped and it is important that</text>
  <text start="84.77" dur="2.76">the American people see this we have a</text>
  <text start="86.24" dur="3.75">lot of confidence in the inspector</text>
  <text start="87.53" dur="4.199">general but we won&amp;#39;t know what we have</text>
  <text start="89.99" dur="3.659">until he files his report but the</text>
  <text start="91.729" dur="4.021">Inspector General report goes well</text>
  <text start="93.649" dur="5.821">beyond the investigation into Hillary&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.75" dur="5.909">email server scandal correct it could he</text>
  <text start="99.47" dur="4.649">was just recently asked by the Attorney</text>
  <text start="101.659" dur="5.371">General to also look at the FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="104.119" dur="4.441">issue what we said about that was great</text>
  <text start="107.03" dur="3.81">we want you to look into that too but we</text>
  <text start="108.56" dur="5.099">also want a special counsel appointed</text>
  <text start="110.84" dur="4.589">because you can&amp;#39;t go beyond the</text>
  <text start="113.659" dur="4.02">Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="115.429" dur="3.451">you&amp;#39;ve got witnesses who&amp;#39;ve left the</text>
  <text start="117.679" dur="3.48">Department of Justice you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="118.88" dur="4.11">witnesses in other departments and you</text>
  <text start="121.159" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t have prosecutorial powers he can</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="4.949">refer for prosecution but he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="124.909" dur="4.71">prosecute himself so we think that a</text>
  <text start="127.939" dur="4.38">special counsel is needed and we also</text>
  <text start="129.619" dur="5.581">think that he should get this report out</text>
  <text start="132.319" dur="5.941">regarding regarding how the FBI handled</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="4.95">the Clinton email and related matters</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="4.229">out now and not wait until he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="4.559">done this other work on the FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="142.489" dur="4.801">we need the information out is there any</text>
  <text start="144.709" dur="7.11">doubt in your mind Hillary Clinton when</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="6.93">she used the outside server and we know</text>
  <text start="151.819" dur="5.311">there was classified top-secret special</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="5.34">access programming classification on</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="7.079">that hard drive and a mom-and-pop shop</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="7.23">that the early exoneration letters or</text>
  <text start="164.209" dur="4.831">exoneration statements of Comey instruct</text>
  <text start="166.79" dur="5.25">referred to the fact that foreign intel</text>
  <text start="169.04" dur="5.52">says had hacked into that and i imagine</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="5.849">that it was probably easy to do is there</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="5.79">any doubt that 18 USC 793 which says</text>
  <text start="177.889" dur="4.021">mishandling of classified information or</text>
  <text start="180.35" dur="4.35">one of the subsections that says</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="4.65">destroying classified information do you</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="4.02">have any doubt those those things were</text>
  <text start="186.56" dur="5.7">violated and is it obstruction of</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="5.97">justice if you delete subpoenaed emails</text>
  <text start="192.26" dur="4.77">then destroy the hard drive and destroy</text>
  <text start="194.69" dur="6.18">any devices that might have the emails</text>
  <text start="197.03" dur="6.84">you have whole series of issues that</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="5.64">were raised back when you</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="4.86">Komi went before the television cameras</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="4.259">to announce all the things she had done</text>
  <text start="208.73" dur="6.45">wrong and I was waiting to hear him say</text>
  <text start="210.769" dur="6.291">therefore instead I heard however and it</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="4.559">is inexplicable to me and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="3.94">chairman trey Gowdy of the oversight</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="4.741">number forum committee and I had</text>
  <text start="221" dur="5.879">launched an investigation into how the</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="5.009">FBI handled all of this starting last</text>
  <text start="226.879" dur="5.091">October that&amp;#39;s why we want the documents</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="7.321">which I finally issued a subpoena for</text>
  <text start="231.97" dur="6.46">last Thursday the Inspector General has</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="4.319">been looking through 1.2 million</text>

  <text start="245.48" dur="3.119">director of the FBI we have their</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="3.509">attention I think we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
