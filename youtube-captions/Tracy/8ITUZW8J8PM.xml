  <text start="230.8" dur="5.07">just nonsense and a lot of people had no</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="4.711">idea what&amp;#39;s happening so in the comments</text>

  <text start="268.09" dur="5.25">person with all I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="4.98">really not I&amp;#39;m just somebody who&amp;#39;s spent</text>
  <text start="273.34" dur="4.05">the majority of her adult life</text>
  <text start="275.14" dur="5.7">researching the heck out of everything</text>
  <text start="277.39" dur="6.51">and I&amp;#39;ve accumulated in my head a lot of</text>
  <text start="280.84" dur="6.81">knowledge about a lot of things and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="5.79">so enlightening and wonderful to see the</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="5.01">rest of the world start to catch up with</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="6.02">those of us who&amp;#39;ve been sort of pushed</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="6.9">away for so long by so many people and</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="6.73">I&amp;#39;m not bitter</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="5.64">I don&amp;#39;t harbor resentment towards people</text>
  <text start="302.44" dur="4.35">who have you know thought one way and</text>
  <text start="305.2" dur="4.35">learned something new and are now just</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="4.98">coming around and I think that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="7.17">really hard for those people to navigate</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="8.79">through all of the information out there</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="6.15">not knowing who to trust you know</text>
  <text start="320.56" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s people saying this is a PSYOP</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s a PSYOP this isn&amp;#39;t real that</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="3.66">isn&amp;#39;t real I mean if you&amp;#39;re just coming</text>
  <text start="326.2" dur="3.95">imagine you know those of us who are</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="4.53">like veterans of this coming into this</text>
  <text start="330.15" dur="5.68">you know however many years ago and</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="5.399">being flooded with lots of different</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="5.04">opinions on what&amp;#39;s true and what&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="338.169" dur="4.201">hiding you know what to trust and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="5.84">where I&amp;#39;m going with this long ramble</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="6.99">I&amp;#39;m basically going to this point I</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="6.55">present information lamma presents</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="5.91">information based on our intuition what</text>
  <text start="353.26" dur="3.57">we feel is legitimate what we feel is</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="5.67">actually going on and then obviously</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="6.68">it&amp;#39;s backed up by facts and I think that</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="4.979">people just really need to use their gut</text>
  <text start="363.51" dur="4.9">it&amp;#39;s something that the powers-that-be</text>
  <text start="365.919" dur="4.411">can&amp;#39;t control your intuition you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="368.41" dur="3.54">your sixth sense kind of way what you</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="5.01">know what tells you which direction you</text>
  <text start="371.95" dur="5.82">should be going in and if you get a bad</text>
  <text start="375.34" dur="5.31">feeling about someone do you have to go</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="5.13">on a campaign you know calling them out</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="5.25">no no just keep it in your back pocket</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="6.389">keep it in your toolkit as I say use</text>
  <text start="385.9" dur="5.13">that as you shape your opinions moving</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="3.69">forward if you&amp;#39;re in the middle of a</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="3.39">thread and you know you&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="3.421">bunch of infighting going</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="5.1">and you don&amp;#39;t really know who to believe</text>
  <text start="396.4" dur="5.61">just read everybody side and keep those</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="5.28">things in your toolkit and just know</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="6.6">that there are many of us out here who</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="6.15">really truly care about humanity as a</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="5.94">whole and really truly care about</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="7.2">helping you to understand what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="414.55" dur="6.6">on helping to give you a perspective</text>
  <text start="418.15" dur="4.83">that maybe you can relate to helping to</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="3.84">you know just be kind of like that</text>
  <text start="422.98" dur="4.38">friend that you can call and be like hey</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="4.83">listen to this and then you know bounce</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="6.95">ideas off of there&amp;#39;s a very good reason</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="9.72">why I spend hours trying very hard to</text>
  <text start="434.31" dur="8.71">answer all of my emails to comment back</text>
  <text start="439.54" dur="5.28">on every single comment to try and let</text>
  <text start="443.02" dur="3.33">people know like I&amp;#39;m just a real person</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="3.84">I can have a conversation with anyone</text>
  <text start="446.35" dur="5.34">you know I try so hard to go through all</text>

  <text start="504.37" dur="4.5">I will never jump on a bandwagon of</text>
  <text start="507.1" dur="4.95">calling someone out and saying that</text>
  <text start="508.87" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re you know not legitimate unless</text>
  <text start="512.05" dur="7.02">it&amp;#39;s really important and I really feel</text>
  <text start="515.44" dur="7.86">strongly about it I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="6.63">that that stuff is is helpful some</text>
