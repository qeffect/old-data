  <text start="108.899" dur="5.76">covered the dossier last on New Year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="3.81">Eve we covered how the dossier</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="3.931">discredits itself it&amp;#39;s like a debate</text>

  <text start="120.75" dur="5.49">implore you to watch it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="5.67">honestly like I literally discredit this</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="3.749">thing using itself there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="3.9">contradictions inside of it that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="2.891">able to tear it apart without even going</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="2.62">really out</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="4.32">side of it to pull from any information</text>
  <text start="134.8" dur="4.56">so if you were anybody reading this</text>
  <text start="137.2" dur="4.29">dossier and you had a half a brain in</text>
  <text start="139.36" dur="4.38">your head and you were actually after</text>
  <text start="141.49" dur="3.99">the truth and had some integrity you</text>
  <text start="143.74" dur="7.11">would figure out immediately that this</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="10.41">thing was a hunk of crap and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="150.85" dur="7.65">know why for certain Dianne Feinstein</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="5.12">decided or Feinstein however you</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="5.3">pronounce it I&amp;#39;m very very very</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="5.2">self-conscious about my pronunciations</text>
  <text start="163.8" dur="4.18">have to you guys in the comments section</text>
  <text start="166.21" dur="4.53">and reading through this this testimony</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="7.29">it hasn&amp;#39;t been fun because it&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="170.74" dur="10.89">Russian names but I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="175.27" dur="8.37">senator Feinstein flesh team decided to</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="4.74">release this it&amp;#39;s really really</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="4.92">ridiculous it blew me away yesterday I</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="5.04">was beside myself because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="6.27">middle of an ongoing investigation yes</text>
  <text start="191.41" dur="6.3">this testimony is an open court or an</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="5.7">open session or in closed session but it</text>
  <text start="197.71" dur="9.36">is it is not you know it&amp;#39;s sealed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="8.7">it&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s not under oath but he&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="207.07" dur="4.4">the same sort of rule structure that</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="4.74">Michael Flynn was under so if he lies to</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="6.37">investigators he&amp;#39;s can be charged</text>
  <text start="213.97" dur="7.44">criminally but it&amp;#39;s just very odd that</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="6.39">this would be released now and I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="221.41" dur="5.22">trying to put my finger on it but I have</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="4.229">to tell you something there have been a</text>
  <text start="226.63" dur="4.22">lot of articles written a lot of great</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="4.711">information picked out of this thing a</text>

  <text start="234.91" dur="3.69">some of it and show you some of it</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="5.79">actually as we move through here but</text>
  <text start="238.6" dur="8.43">this is a lot bigger than just this</text>
  <text start="242.23" dur="7.77">dossier this actually encompasses a lot</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="5.67">more history and a lot more substance</text>
  <text start="250" dur="6.209">than just the Christopher Steele dossier</text>
  <text start="252.7" dur="5.31">and I feel like maybe a lot of people</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="3.78">aren&amp;#39;t catching on to that or they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="258.01" dur="5.25">know the backstory about why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="6.18">important so I&amp;#39;m gonna try my best to</text>

  <text start="813.83" dur="5.04">the sky is blue and fusion GPS say okay</text>
  <text start="817.19" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m only gonna focus on why the sky is</text>
  <text start="818.87" dur="4.1">blue and I&amp;#39;m not gonna look at anything</text>
  <text start="820.58" dur="7.2">else they look at everything as a whole</text>
  <text start="822.97" dur="7.99">supposedly right they also as per Glenn</text>
  <text start="827.78" dur="6.27">Simpson have done a few presidential</text>
  <text start="830.96" dur="5.88">campaigns every few years not not one of</text>
  <text start="834.05" dur="11.25">their main focuses the company has 12</text>
  <text start="836.84" dur="11.4">staff 12 staff 12 but yet for some</text>
  <text start="845.3" dur="5.91">reason Glenn Simpson doesn&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="5.01">their names there&amp;#39;s two staff members he</text>
  <text start="851.21" dur="4.05">just can&amp;#39;t recall their names but later</text>
  <text start="853.25" dur="6.3">on in the in the testimony he&amp;#39;s able to</text>
  <text start="855.26" dur="5.76">speak to what they do you know nobody</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="3.33">knows how to speak Russian everybody</text>
  <text start="861.02" dur="4.23">knows how to do this it just it stinks</text>
  <text start="862.88" dur="5.15">it really does it really does stink and</text>
  <text start="865.25" dur="6.72">it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="868.03" dur="6.67">they fought for Russia with Preveza and</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="7.14">now they&amp;#39;re saying Russia&amp;#39;s bad with</text>
  <text start="874.7" dur="6.5">steel and so so Simpson goes through</text>
  <text start="879.11" dur="4.23">this testimony and he&amp;#39;s basically like</text>
  <text start="881.2" dur="6.49">contradicting himself because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="883.34" dur="5.46">saying fusion gb/s you know Russia has</text>

  <text start="896.39" dur="3.63">Russia and throughout the testimony you</text>
  <text start="898.31" dur="3.66">see them asking them questions about it</text>
  <text start="900.02" dur="3">like you know do you know that this</text>
  <text start="901.97" dur="2.22">person&amp;#39;s related to government</text>

  <text start="905.48" dur="5.79">intelligence do you know you know what</text>
  <text start="907.19" dur="7.53">I&amp;#39;m saying so he just can&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="911.27" dur="4.53">contradicts himself consistently 15</text>
  <text start="914.72" dur="3.32">minutes in and I haven&amp;#39;t even gotten</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="4.29">into</text>
  <text start="918.04" dur="2.8">I&amp;#39;m just gonna read this so you have a</text>
  <text start="920.09" dur="3.06">better idea</text>
  <text start="920.84" dur="4.35">in the interview Simpson said his work</text>
  <text start="923.15" dur="4.68">for the American law firm firm Baker</text>
  <text start="925.19" dur="4.83">Hostetler which was representing prison</text>

  <text start="930.02" dur="3.72">government accused of laundering money</text>
  <text start="931.67" dur="3.78">in T New York City real estate was</text>
  <text start="933.74" dur="3.9">focused on trying to get William Browder</text>

  <text start="937.64" dur="6.17">this case and his activities in Russia</text>
  <text start="939.65" dur="8.07">and you&amp;#39;d have to think that given</text>
  <text start="943.81" dur="5.86">Fuzion gps&amp;#39;s extensive work into this</text>
  <text start="947.72" dur="4.47">case with New York City real estate if</text>
  <text start="949.67" dur="5.01">Donald Trump was gonna have ties to a</text>
  <text start="952.19" dur="5.28">Russian holding company and business in</text>
  <text start="954.68" dur="4.62">Russia he would be a part of that market</text>
  <text start="957.47" dur="4.5">he would be a part of that transaction</text>
  <text start="959.3" dur="4.53">you know Donald Trump is New York City</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="4.76">real estate he would know of these</text>
  <text start="963.83" dur="5.07">people they would have tied him to them</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="5.67">do you understand what I&amp;#39;m saying you</text>
  <text start="968.9" dur="3.5">can&amp;#39;t answer me but I&amp;#39;m asking anyway</text>
  <text start="973.15" dur="5.11">Browder</text>
  <text start="974.66" dur="6.3">according to Simpson founder of fusion</text>
  <text start="978.26" dur="4.74">GPS had told the Justice Department that</text>
  <text start="980.96" dur="4.95">he&amp;#39;d laundered money that the laundered</text>
  <text start="983" dur="6.74">money was stolen from Russia as part of</text>
  <text start="985.91" dur="6.99">the 230 million dollar tax fraud scheme</text>
  <text start="989.74" dur="11.2">that Sergey Magnitsky his lawyer</text>
  <text start="992.9" dur="9.78">uncovered in 2008 Magnitsky was arrested</text>
  <text start="1000.94" dur="3.36">and imprisoned that year and Browder&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1002.68" dur="3.39">reputation has become inextricably</text>
  <text start="1004.3" dur="4.92">linked to the global human rights</text>
  <text start="1006.07" dur="6.6">campaign he launched after Magnitsky</text>
  <text start="1009.22" dur="5.28">died in prison in 2009 Browder and other</text>
  <text start="1012.67" dur="3.75">independent human rights organizations</text>
  <text start="1014.5" dur="3.96">have said Magnitsky was beaten to death</text>
  <text start="1016.42" dur="4.38">after he discovered the fraud scheme</text>
  <text start="1018.46" dur="7.379">which implicated high-level Kremlin</text>
  <text start="1020.8" dur="8.039">officials so again fusion GPS is working</text>
  <text start="1025.839" dur="8.25">with the lawyers at Baker Hostetler for</text>
  <text start="1028.839" dur="10.23">provision provision as per Browder and</text>

  <text start="1055.36" dur="3.96">Simpson told lawmakers in August that</text>
  <text start="1057.519" dur="3.721">Browder would not answer any of Baker</text>

  <text start="1691.13" dur="3.87">could point to something in particular</text>
  <text start="1692.84" dur="4.2">as a trigger I mean the basis for the</text>
  <text start="1695" dur="3.78">request was he had made a number of</text>
  <text start="1697.04" dur="3.45">trips to Russia and talked about doing a</text>
  <text start="1698.78" dur="3.51">number of business deals but never did</text>
  <text start="1700.49" dur="7.86">one and that struck me as a little bit</text>
  <text start="1702.29" dur="10.71">odd and calling for an explanation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1708.35" dur="6.54">never done business in Russia never he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1720.08" dur="9.06">I get confused because let me tell you</text>
  <text start="1723.44" dur="9.24">something okay he says that he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1729.14" dur="6.6">direct people in any one certain way he</text>
  <text start="1732.68" dur="5.07">doesn&amp;#39;t say he says earlier and this</text>
  <text start="1735.74" dur="3.42">just actually kind of hit me he says</text>
  <text start="1737.75" dur="3.3">earlier that he just directed</text>
  <text start="1739.16" dur="3.45">Christopher Steele to go over to Russia</text>
  <text start="1741.05" dur="3.53">and just figure out what Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1742.61" dur="5.85">doing with his business deals over there</text>
  <text start="1744.58" dur="6.64">or globally for that matter and then he</text>
  <text start="1748.46" dur="4.62">says you know what&amp;#39;s really strange he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1753.08" dur="5.189">Russia</text>
  <text start="1753.98" dur="5.909">that&amp;#39;s weird why would that be weird why</text>
  <text start="1758.269" dur="6.181">would you dig somewhere where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1759.889" dur="9.591">nothing it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense and</text>
  <text start="1764.45" dur="8.609">then and then we have you know the the</text>
  <text start="1769.48" dur="6.669">dossier coming back and saying the same</text>

  <text start="2055.09" dur="3.21">was doing business with so they either</text>
  <text start="2056.59" dur="2.88">he never told him this in quotes right</text>

  <text start="2065.11" dur="4.02">offer him anything you know the standard</text>
  <text start="2067.57" dur="3.599">sorts of things you would look at I</text>
  <text start="2069.13" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t think I ever gave him any specific</text>
  <text start="2071.169" dur="4.461">instructions beyond the general find</text>
  <text start="2072.94" dur="2.69">what he was up to</text>

  <text start="2087.99" dur="6.72">eighty-three eighty-nine let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="2091.72" dur="5.189">about this information for a minute guys</text>
  <text start="2094.71" dur="4.84">you want to hear about what it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2096.909" dur="11.761">for Glenn Simpson and Chris deal and</text>
  <text start="2099.55" dur="11.67">disinformation how about it ready so</text>
  <text start="2108.67" dur="4.44">question is with regard to selecting mr.</text>
  <text start="2111.22" dur="3.72">steel specifically to do the Russia to</text>
  <text start="2113.11" dur="3.6">do work on Kennedy Trump&amp;#39;s ties to</text>
  <text start="2114.94" dur="4.5">Russia which he&amp;#39;s already admitted that</text>
  <text start="2116.71" dur="4.38">Tom Trump doesn&amp;#39;t really have any do you</text>
  <text start="2119.44" dur="3.09">believe based on his experience and</text>
  <text start="2121.09" dur="2.94">background that mr. steel would have</text>
  <text start="2122.53" dur="2.97">been aware of the potential in his</text>
  <text start="2124.03" dur="4.71">discussions with these people that he</text>
  <text start="2125.5" dur="5.13">could be fed this information like aka</text>
  <text start="2128.74" dur="3.21">do you think he thought about the fact</text>
  <text start="2130.63" dur="8.58">that it could have been given to him</text>
  <text start="2131.95" dur="10.05">like disinfo and Glenn Simpson says very</text>
  <text start="2139.21" dur="5.7">definitively when Chris I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="2142" dur="4.8">it I know it when Chris briefs in a sort</text>
  <text start="2144.91" dur="3.75">of more formal setting which I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2146.8" dur="5.06">you know when he introduces himself you</text>
  <text start="2148.66" dur="5.58">know he was the lead Russia NIST for mi6</text>
  <text start="2151.86" dur="4.12">so the very so the first sort of</text>
  <text start="2154.24" dur="3.84">beginning of that is he says you know</text>
  <text start="2155.98" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;ve worked on this issue all my life</text>
  <text start="2158.08" dur="2.82">and when you&amp;#39;re trained in Russian</text>
  <text start="2159.31" dur="3.39">intelligence matters the fundamental</text>
  <text start="2160.9" dur="3.9">problem of your profession is disinfo</text>
  <text start="2162.7" dur="4.65">his information it&amp;#39;s the number one</text>
  <text start="2164.8" dur="4.62">issue in any collection of field you</text>
  <text start="2167.35" dur="3.3">know information from the field you</text>
  <text start="2169.42" dur="3.39">should assume that there will possibly</text>
  <text start="2170.65" dur="4.02">be some disinformation and that you know</text>
  <text start="2172.81" dur="3.84">as a professional whose dick had it</text>
  <text start="2174.67" dur="3.21">dedicated my life to this you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2176.65" dur="3.66">trained to spot</text>
  <text start="2177.88" dur="3.69">or likely disinformation so its front</text>
  <text start="2180.31" dur="4.46">and center Center when you gather</text>
  <text start="2181.57" dur="3.2">information in Russia</text>
  <text start="2185.61" dur="24.7">aha 93 and question is ready listen to</text>
  <text start="2208.09" dur="4.53">this and he talked a bit about prior</text>
  <text start="2210.31" dur="4.41">work and and mr. Steele&amp;#39;s performance in</text>
  <text start="2212.62" dur="4.14">prior work and being satisfied by that</text>
  <text start="2214.72" dur="3.63">work did you do anything to kind of test</text>
  <text start="2216.76" dur="6.77">and make sure the information he was</text>
  <text start="2218.35" dur="5.18">giving you was accurate in the dossier</text>
  <text start="2224.01" dur="5.89">answer so in the sort of I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2227.74" dur="4.14">repeating myself but generally we do</text>
  <text start="2229.9" dur="3.54">public records work so we deal in</text>
  <text start="2231.88" dur="3.93">documents and things that are very hard</text>
  <text start="2233.44" dur="4.5">and that are useful in court or you know</text>
  <text start="2235.81" dur="4.26">other kinds of proceedings Chris deals</text>
  <text start="2237.94" dur="3.96">in a very different kind of information</text>
  <text start="2240.07" dur="4.92">which is human intelligence human</text>
  <text start="2241.9" dur="4.14">information so by its very nature the</text>
  <text start="2244.99" dur="3.63">question of whether something is</text>
  <text start="2246.04" dur="4.14">accurate isn&amp;#39;t really asked the question</text>
  <text start="2248.62" dur="4.2">that is asked generally is whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2250.18" dur="5.37">credible human intelligence isn&amp;#39;t good</text>
  <text start="2252.82" dur="4.44">for you know filing lawsuits it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="2255.55" dur="3.57">for making decisions and trying to</text>
  <text start="2257.26" dur="3.57">understand what&amp;#39;s going on and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2259.12" dur="4.65">really valuable thing but it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="2260.83" dur="5.13">same thing so when you evaluate human</text>
  <text start="2263.77" dur="4.5">intelligence human reporting field</text>
  <text start="2265.96" dur="3.42">reporting source reporting you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2268.27" dur="2.37">just sort of like when you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="2269.38" dur="3.11">journalist and you&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="2270.64" dur="4.05">out who&amp;#39;s telling the truth right</text>
  <text start="2272.49" dur="4.39">you don&amp;#39;t really decide who&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="2274.69" dur="3.84">the truth you decide whether the person</text>
  <text start="2276.88" dur="2.85">is credible right whether they know what</text>
  <text start="2278.53" dur="2.55">they&amp;#39;re talking about whether there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2279.73" dur="3.06">other reasons to believe that what</text>
  <text start="2281.08" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re saying whether anything they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2282.79" dur="4.23">said factually matches up with something</text>
  <text start="2285.16" dur="3.48">in the public record so you know we</text>
  <text start="2287.02" dur="3.03">would evaluate his memos based on</text>
  <text start="2288.64" dur="2.91">whether he told us something we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2290.05" dur="3.72">know from somewhere else that we were</text>
  <text start="2291.55" dur="4.68">then able to run down so you know for</text>
  <text start="2293.77" dur="4.41">example he you know wrote a memo about a</text>
  <text start="2296.23" dur="4.35">trump campaign advisor named Carter page</text>
  <text start="2298.18" dur="6.32">and his mysterious trip to Moscow and</text>
  <text start="2300.58" dur="3.92">then he stops he stops them</text>
  <text start="2305.65" dur="4.199">he just relied on the fact that</text>
  <text start="2308.289" dur="3.691">Christopher Steele was supposedly a</text>
  <text start="2309.849" dur="5.641">competent you know established</text>
  <text start="2311.98" dur="5.97">investigative guy with mi6 ties he</text>
  <text start="2315.49" dur="4.259">didn&amp;#39;t vet the information he just took</text>
  <text start="2317.95" dur="4.169">it and tried to piece something together</text>
  <text start="2319.749" dur="8.461">he wasn&amp;#39;t all that interested about</text>
  <text start="2322.119" dur="9.031">facts and and and all that and he says</text>
  <text start="2328.21" dur="6.48">all this now and then later on in the</text>
  <text start="2331.15" dur="7.32">document in the testimony they talked</text>
  <text start="2334.69" dur="5.099">about how he was Pro out now at this</text>
  <text start="2338.47" dur="2.819">point in time that this testimony is</text>
  <text start="2339.789" dur="3.121">happening he knows what&amp;#39;s in the entire</text>
  <text start="2341.289" dur="2.881">dossier so they&amp;#39;re asking him these</text>
  <text start="2342.91" dur="3.929">questions and he knows what&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="2344.17" dur="6.54">dossier and later on in the testimony</text>
  <text start="2346.839" dur="5.73">they ask him you know he basically</text>
  <text start="2350.71" dur="6.539">volunteers that he took it to the FBI</text>
  <text start="2352.569" dur="6.151">that Steele helped him so you just</text>
  <text start="2357.249" dur="3.741">basically say you can&amp;#39;t rely on this</text>
  <text start="2358.72" dur="4.68">sort of thing for information</text>
  <text start="2360.99" dur="6.24">you know that&amp;#39;s credible and for a</text>
  <text start="2363.4" dur="6.659">lawsuits but you take it to the FBI and</text>
  <text start="2367.23" dur="6.069">that really bothers me I just I just</text>
  <text start="2370.059" dur="6.901">don&amp;#39;t people don&amp;#39;t people why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2373.299" dur="6.901">people I&amp;#39;m asking stupid questions I</text>
  <text start="2376.96" dur="4.95">know why I know why but it&amp;#39;s just really</text>
  <text start="2380.2" dur="4.71">frustrating like I&amp;#39;m not even halfway</text>
  <text start="2381.91" dur="7.649">through this thirty nine minutes he</text>
  <text start="2384.91" dur="6.679">didn&amp;#39;t vet the information he goes into</text>
  <text start="2389.559" dur="9.3">the lobbying with William Browder and</text>
  <text start="2391.589" dur="9.581">then he goes into trying to the</text>
  <text start="2398.859" dur="8.851">questioner trying to establish a</text>
  <text start="2401.17" dur="7.589">connection between between fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="2407.71" dur="3.059">and Preveza</text>
  <text start="2408.759" dur="3.901">because I think what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2410.769" dur="3.75">do is establish whether or not fusion</text>
  <text start="2412.66" dur="5.31">GPS was behind setting up the meeting</text>
  <text start="2414.519" dur="5.85">between vessel Nets Kyah and the Trump</text>
  <text start="2417.97" dur="3.96">campaign and I think it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2420.369" dur="2.94">important there because there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="2421.93" dur="3.419">work going on behind the scenes in</text>
  <text start="2423.309" dur="7.851">regards to match Netsky Magnitsky</text>
  <text start="2425.349" dur="9.031">imagine it&amp;#39;s key so this is big again so</text>
  <text start="2431.16" dur="4.959">the question is and was any of the</text>
  <text start="2434.38" dur="3.449">information you provided to the media</text>
  <text start="2436.119" dur="3.15">information that wasn&amp;#39;t the result of</text>
  <text start="2437.829" dur="3.42">your own research but</text>
  <text start="2439.269" dur="7.26">had been passed along to you by Baker</text>
  <text start="2441.249" dur="8.1">Hostetler or Preveza and he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="2446.529" dur="5.49">trying to see if fusion GPS is being</text>
  <text start="2449.349" dur="8.281">used as a funnel to taint a media</text>
  <text start="2452.019" dur="7.55">perception about something then he</text>
  <text start="2457.63" dur="6.75">starts asking about the translators</text>
  <text start="2459.569" dur="8.11">which I find really interesting because</text>
  <text start="2464.38" dur="5.25">I did that video on the translator from</text>
  <text start="2467.679" dur="5.28">Meridian I keep bringing it up I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2469.63" dur="6.599">know why I&amp;#39;m telling you for some reason</text>
  <text start="2472.959" dur="5.91">that thing has haunted me ever since I</text>
  <text start="2476.229" dur="4.411">did it it bothers me to no end that that</text>
  <text start="2478.869" dur="5.88">translator was in there no one&amp;#39;s paying</text>
  <text start="2480.64" dur="6">attention to it I&amp;#39;ve been screaming it</text>
  <text start="2484.749" dur="5.61">from the rooftops the translator from</text>
  <text start="2486.64" dur="8.099">meridian and hillary it&amp;#39;s so important</text>
  <text start="2490.359" dur="6.9">in my opinion just saying the translator</text>
  <text start="2494.739" dur="6.75">from meridian and hillary I&amp;#39;ll put it in</text>
  <text start="2497.259" dur="9.21">the description box below so they start</text>
  <text start="2501.489" dur="6.36">asking about the translators was there</text>
  <text start="2506.469" dur="3.33">any other support from russian-speaking</text>
  <text start="2507.849" dur="4.08">individuals and reviewing the documents</text>
  <text start="2509.799" dur="3.62">and the answer is not in my company at</text>
  <text start="2511.929" dur="3.75">least that not not that I can recall</text>
  <text start="2513.419" dur="4.45">there were other Russian speakers I</text>
  <text start="2515.679" dur="5.76">think were engaged by Baker Hostetler in</text>
  <text start="2517.869" dur="4.86">various situations like translators do</text>
  <text start="2521.439" dur="6.3">you remember the names of any of those</text>
  <text start="2522.729" dur="6.48">people and he named some then they talk</text>
  <text start="2527.739" dur="7.49">about his interactions with the press a</text>
  <text start="2529.209" dur="8.97">little more in here in this testimony</text>
  <text start="2535.229" dur="6.63">Simpson makes sure to paint Browder as a</text>
  <text start="2538.179" dur="10.26">self aggregate like a self promoting</text>
  <text start="2541.859" dur="9.31">self obsessed media whore basically is</text>
  <text start="2548.439" dur="5.55">what he does very interesting the the</text>
  <text start="2551.169" dur="4.5">the vitriol coming from him at Browder</text>
  <text start="2553.989" dur="5.24">now I&amp;#39;m not saying Browder&amp;#39;s a good guy</text>
  <text start="2555.669" dur="3.56">I&amp;#39;m just saying think of the sides</text>
  <text start="2560.7" dur="5.71">I&amp;#39;m cutting this down a little bit they</text>
  <text start="2563.56" dur="4.41">go into on this is important I think so</text>
  <text start="2566.41" dur="9.59">I&amp;#39;m gonna read through it my voice is</text>

  <text start="2644.83" dur="3.69">this was the person who hired them who</text>

  <text start="2661.96" dur="5.18">into like serious like serious stuff and</text>
  <text start="2670.26" dur="9.82">then at one point on page 140 and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2676.6" dur="7.23">not even dipping into this a one-part on</text>
  <text start="2680.08" dur="6.6">page 140 they&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="2683.83" dur="4.14">dossier and the question is can you just</text>
  <text start="2686.68" dur="2.97">explain to us so we understand the</text>
  <text start="2687.97" dur="3.27">document it has a heading company</text>
  <text start="2689.65" dur="2.04">intelligence report I&amp;#39;m just looking at</text>
  <text start="2691.24" dur="2.7">the first</text>
  <text start="2691.69" dur="3.96">Paige that one says company intelligence</text>
  <text start="2693.94" dur="4.56">report what would that have signified</text>
  <text start="2695.65" dur="4.26">and then he says a company intelligence</text>
  <text start="2698.5" dur="3.66">report is just a way of saying it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2699.91" dur="3.9">a government document in the event that</text>
  <text start="2702.16" dur="3.39">someone stole that her leak did or there</text>
  <text start="2703.81" dur="3.33">was some sort of breach they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2705.55" dur="2.85">gonna have their own name on it but they</text>
  <text start="2707.14" dur="3.479">want to make sure that no one mistakes</text>
  <text start="2708.4" dur="4.77">it for a government document and then he</text>
  <text start="2710.619" dur="4.98">says zero eight zero is their internal</text>
  <text start="2713.17" dur="4.409">numbering system for you know their</text>
  <text start="2715.599" dur="5.581">production of memoranda and the reason</text>
  <text start="2717.579" dur="5.941">it jumps from 80 to 86 is I never</text>
  <text start="2721.18" dur="4.26">actually asked him but there aren&amp;#39;t five</text>
  <text start="2723.52" dur="3.809">memos in between this so the</text>
  <text start="2725.44" dur="4.2">interpretation is that it&amp;#39;s in an</text>
  <text start="2727.329" dur="4.921">internal numbering system for maybe</text>
  <text start="2729.64" dur="4.86">Russia stuff or maybe it&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2732.25" dur="8.79">sorry I don&amp;#39;t know what the internal</text>
  <text start="2734.5" dur="9.81">numbering system is maybe Russia stuff</text>
  <text start="2741.04" dur="5.94">what does that mean I would have asked</text>
  <text start="2744.31" dur="4.559">him as a follow-up question when you</text>
  <text start="2746.98" dur="3.42">were just answering us you said that the</text>
  <text start="2748.869" dur="3.571">interpretation that it&amp;#39;s an internal</text>
  <text start="2750.4" dur="5.49">numbering system from maybe Russia stuff</text>
  <text start="2752.44" dur="13.26">what did you mean by Russia stuff follow</text>
  <text start="2755.89" dur="12.3">up ask a question now he mentions in</text>
  <text start="2765.7" dur="4.23">here metaphor to McCain and ties to</text>
  <text start="2768.19" dur="5.129">Russia and that he&amp;#39;d done a lot of work</text>
  <text start="2769.93" dur="6.74">and to Paul Matta fort in the past and</text>
  <text start="2773.319" dur="7.5">I&amp;#39;m gonna just do one more for tonight</text>
  <text start="2776.67" dur="5.439">it&amp;#39;s really sad I think page 154 and 155</text>
  <text start="2780.819" dur="6.391">is where I really started getting</text>
  <text start="2782.109" dur="6.901">excited oh goodness I&amp;#39;m not covering</text>
  <text start="2787.21" dur="5.55">things in here that everybody else has</text>
  <text start="2789.01" dur="5.16">covered so that&amp;#39;s good I you&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="2792.76" dur="4.23">you could point out things that I miss</text>
  <text start="2794.17" dur="4.59">but likely I know them already because</text>
  <text start="2796.99" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;ve done hours of research into this</text>
  <text start="2798.76" dur="6.63">now so likely I know them already but</text>
  <text start="2801.25" dur="9.51">here we go 140 to read page about what</text>
  <text start="2805.39" dur="6.87">they were looking at ah okay what was</text>
  <text start="2810.76" dur="4.26">what what use did you make of these</text>
  <text start="2812.26" dur="4.859">memos is the question the answer these</text>
  <text start="2815.02" dur="4.11">memos I mean I guess I&amp;#39;d like to back up</text>
  <text start="2817.119" dur="3.931">a little bit and explain you know what</text>
  <text start="2819.13" dur="3.87">led to the memos which was as I said I</text>
  <text start="2821.05" dur="3.45">mean you know we started looking at</text>
  <text start="2823" dur="2.46">first we started looking at Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2824.5" dur="2.91">business affairs</text>
  <text start="2825.46" dur="4.35">generally with some of the emphasis on</text>
  <text start="2827.41" dur="4.47">associations with organized crime and in</text>
  <text start="2829.81" dur="4.049">particular Russian organized crime and</text>
  <text start="2831.88" dur="5.16">as the project progressed towards the</text>
  <text start="2833.859" dur="4.831">end of 2015 and into 2016 we became</text>
  <text start="2837.04" dur="3.059">interested in his overseas business</text>
  <text start="2838.69" dur="3.69">dealings particularly because they were</text>
  <text start="2840.099" dur="3.481">so opaque and seemed to involve you know</text>
  <text start="2842.38" dur="7.2">to say the least</text>
  <text start="2843.58" dur="9.33">colorful characters he&amp;#39;s saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2849.58" dur="8.1">looking through Latin America several in</text>
  <text start="2852.91" dur="7.199">the former Soviet Union they began to</text>
  <text start="2857.68" dur="7.56">exhaust the public record and didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2860.109" dur="7.651">find anything so we just wanted to get</text>
  <text start="2865.24" dur="3.84">human source so the purpose was to see</text>
  <text start="2867.76" dur="3.24">if we could learn more about his</text>
  <text start="2869.08" dur="3.84">business dealings in Russia which he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2871" dur="3.39">already said he has done and then they</text>
  <text start="2872.92" dur="3.179">say what came back was something you</text>
  <text start="2874.39" dur="3.63">know very different and obviously more</text>
  <text start="2876.099" dur="3.75">alarming which had to do with you know</text>
  <text start="2878.02" dur="3.99">which outlined a political conspiracy</text>
  <text start="2879.849" dur="3.421">and a much broader set of issues than</text>
  <text start="2882.01" dur="4.589">the ones we basically went looking for</text>
  <text start="2883.27" dur="8.73">you mean we didn&amp;#39;t know what to do with</text>
  <text start="2886.599" dur="7.141">this initially and then he starts saying</text>
  <text start="2892" dur="4.94">how they said they start saying like</text>
  <text start="2893.74" dur="5.82">debbie Wasserman Schultz was hacked and</text>
  <text start="2896.94" dur="4.27">the emails were released and it was like</text>
  <text start="2899.56" dur="4.74">nothing they&amp;#39;d ever seen before and they</text>
  <text start="2901.21" dur="5.04">were getting this intelligence you know</text>
  <text start="2904.3" dur="3.87">about what was going on with Trump and</text>
  <text start="2906.25" dur="3.99">Russia over a period of months and they</text>
  <text start="2908.17" dur="5.31">decide they need to go and report it to</text>
  <text start="2910.24" dur="9.18">the FBI we&amp;#39;re leaving this story off on</text>
  <text start="2913.48" dur="11.85">page 155 for now he talks about Matta</text>
  <text start="2919.42" dur="8.28">fort Trump&amp;#39;s people here we go one of</text>
  <text start="2925.33" dur="4.86">the key lines here in the second</text>
  <text start="2927.7" dur="4.23">paragraph in the dossier says however he</text>
  <text start="2930.19" dur="3.84">and his inner circle have accepted a</text>
  <text start="2931.93" dur="4.29">regular flow of intelligence from the</text>
  <text start="2934.03" dur="5.49">Kremlin including on his Democratic and</text>
  <text start="2936.22" dur="4.8">other political rivals and then he says</text>
  <text start="2939.52" dur="4.05">so the issue with the Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="2941.02" dur="4.349">meeting as I understand it is that the</text>
  <text start="2943.57" dur="3.21">Trump people were eager to accept</text>
  <text start="2945.369" dur="4.051">intelligence from a foreign government</text>
  <text start="2946.78" dur="4.23">about their political rivals and that is</text>
  <text start="2949.42" dur="3.84">you know I would say a form of</text>
  <text start="2951.01" dur="4.079">interference if you&amp;#39;re getting help from</text>
  <text start="2953.26" dur="3.96">a foreign government and your help is</text>
  <text start="2955.089" dur="3.981">intelligence then the father the foreign</text>
  <text start="2957.22" dur="4.26">governments interfering</text>
  <text start="2959.07" dur="3.52">well I&amp;#39;ve got a few problems with that</text>
  <text start="2961.48" dur="3.39">mr. Simpson</text>
  <text start="2962.59" dur="5.52">shall we start at the beginning number</text>
  <text start="2964.87" dur="5.82">one you have been getting intelligence</text>
  <text start="2968.11" dur="4.11">from a foreign government if in fact</text>
  <text start="2970.69" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re saying that that&amp;#39;s what Donald</text>
  <text start="2972.22" dur="4.23">Trump jr. was getting because vessel</text>
  <text start="2974.11" dur="4.56">Nets Kyah as per your testimony</text>
  <text start="2976.45" dur="4.56">throughout the entire document so far is</text>
  <text start="2978.67" dur="4.5">not connected to the Russian government</text>
  <text start="2981.01" dur="4.44">in any way shape or form so who&amp;#39;s lying</text>
  <text start="2983.17" dur="5.43">you can&amp;#39;t have it one way and then the</text>
  <text start="2985.45" dur="5.04">other either vessel Metz kaya is an</text>
  <text start="2988.6" dur="4.14">intelligence agent and you are also</text>
  <text start="2990.49" dur="4.05">guilty of working with her as an</text>
  <text start="2992.74" dur="4.38">intelligence agent from another company</text>
  <text start="2994.54" dur="4.41">from another country without authority</text>
  <text start="2997.12" dur="5.16">to do so and without registering</text>
  <text start="2998.95" dur="5.88">properly or everything that you just</text>
  <text start="3002.28" dur="3.87">said is a lie and you deserve to be in</text>
  <text start="3004.83" dur="3.42">prison well actually either way you</text>
  <text start="3006.15" dur="7.52">should be criminally charged with</text>
  <text start="3008.25" dur="7.17">perjury at this point either way because</text>
  <text start="3013.67" dur="4">what you&amp;#39;re doing is completely</text>
  <text start="3015.42" dur="4.71">ridiculous do you guys understand I</text>
  <text start="3017.67" dur="5.73">think you do I keep asking you like</text>
  <text start="3020.13" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re sitting here in front of me the</text>
  <text start="3023.4" dur="2.76">Trump people were eagle too eager to</text>
  <text start="3024.87" dur="2.76">accept intelligence from a foreign</text>
  <text start="3026.16" dur="3.15">government about their political rivals</text>
  <text start="3027.63" dur="3.78">and that is you know I would say a form</text>
  <text start="3029.31" dur="3.93">of interference they were eager to</text>
  <text start="3031.41" dur="4.41">accept and they did accept are two</text>
  <text start="3033.24" dur="4.68">different things first of all okay they</text>
  <text start="3035.82" dur="3.24">didn&amp;#39;t accept crap at that meeting they</text>
  <text start="3037.92" dur="3.33">didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong</text>
