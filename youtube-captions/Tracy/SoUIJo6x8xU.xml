  <text start="0" dur="6.21">wrong hey guys sorry about that last</text>
  <text start="4.44" dur="4.56">video I started a video and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="6.21" dur="5.009">work out I had to fix things alright so</text>
  <text start="9" dur="3.99">I literally have about 15 minutes which</text>
  <text start="11.219" dur="4.201">isn&amp;#39;t long enough but I&amp;#39;m gonna do my</text>
  <text start="12.99" dur="5.25">best and if I need to come up come back</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="4.47">on later then I&amp;#39;ll do that I released</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="3.449">the story yesterday and I titled it</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="7.26">coming into focus and I was joking</text>
  <text start="21.689" dur="7.711">around that there we go now I&amp;#39;m louder</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="3.719">I was joking around that I never should</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="3.69">have titled it at that because it opened</text>
  <text start="30.869" dur="4.651">up a lot of questions about what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="33.09" dur="6.36">on and a lot of people were confused and</text>
  <text start="35.52" dur="5.699">that&amp;#39;s never my intention ever and I</text>
  <text start="39.45" dur="3.179">understand it was confusing in the way</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="3.121">that I presented it may not have been</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="4.941">the best and I appreciate everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="44.34" dur="5.69">constructive criticism about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.57" dur="4.57">needed to make things better okay</text>
  <text start="50.03" dur="3.939">alright so let me just address a bunch</text>
  <text start="52.14" dur="5.16">of different things as fast as I</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="5.73">possibly can now I did a thread</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="5.189">yesterday and I introduced the fact that</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="4.981">officer Pantaleo who was the one who put</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="4.411">Eric garner in the hold that led</text>
  <text start="64.68" dur="4.11">illegible or apparently led to his death</text>
  <text start="66.9" dur="3.99">was fired from the New York Police</text>
  <text start="68.79" dur="3.6">Department by the commissioner and a lot</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="3.99">of people were confused as to why I</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="4.799">thought that was so important and so</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="5.93">what I did was I pulled the story back</text>
  <text start="77.189" dur="6.75">from April of 2018 that I had done to</text>
  <text start="80.81" dur="5.77">explain why it was important that a the</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="4.951">Department of Justice did decline to</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="4.77">charge this gentleman criminally after</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="5.939">five years and a day before the statute</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="5.309">of limitations on it expired and be why</text>
  <text start="94.829" dur="3.691">I thought it was even more telling that</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="5.731">he was fired from the police department</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="5.669">now as you guys know I if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.14">here for any length of time I am NOT a</text>
  <text start="104.189" dur="6.271">one to throw information out there</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="6.21">without being nearly nearly certain that</text>
  <text start="110.46" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s enough to back it up that it</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="4.409">makes sense I&amp;#39;m not interested in</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="4.259">conspiracy theories but the reaction the</text>
  <text start="117.149" dur="3.301">reaction that I got on my thread was</text>
  <text start="118.829" dur="5.101">quite stunning there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="4.83">people that didn&amp;#39;t believe that I or</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="2.61">didn&amp;#39;t believe that that was my</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="2.67">intention there were a lot of people</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="3.089">that thought I was just making all of</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="5.33">this up and that&amp;#39;s not the case at all</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="5.301">so just a triple and quadruple check</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="4.56">make sure that I was and absolutely out</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="5.43">of my mind I circled back I reread the</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="4.53">mid-year exam report I reread the IG</text>
  <text start="140.36" dur="3.72">report from McCabe and I found some</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="3.78">other reporting that corroborated what I</text>
  <text start="144.08" dur="3.989">was talking about so that I could throw</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="4.61">it back to you guys and explain why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="148.069" dur="6.181">saying what I&amp;#39;m saying it&amp;#39;s a big deal</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="6.88">Andrew McCabe and Loretta Lynch during</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="6.18">the time where anthony weiner&amp;#39;s laptop</text>
  <text start="157.64" dur="5.21">was discovered got on the phone with the</text>
  <text start="160.43" dur="4.68">New York field office of the FBI and</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="4.27">Andrew McCabe said that Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="165.11" dur="5.129">used some of the strongest language he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.12" dur="5.61">ever seen to admonish the NYPD the New</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="4.681">York field office of the FBI for leaking</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="3.75">one of the cases that was brought up was</text>
  <text start="174.92" dur="5.7">the Eric garner case that they were</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="6.479">leaking in the Eric garner case okay it</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="5.369">was very odd to me that in the middle of</text>
  <text start="182.959" dur="4.981">this IG report on McCabe leaking to the</text>
  <text start="185.989" dur="4.711">Wall Street Journal about the Clinton</text>
  <text start="187.94" dur="5.16">Foundation investigation they would</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="3.63">randomly mention a conference call with</text>
  <text start="193.1" dur="3.15">the Attorney General of the United</text>
  <text start="194.33" dur="3.96">States in the New York field office and</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="5.06">the fact that they were admonished them</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="6.27">about leaking in the Eric garner case</text>
  <text start="201.31" dur="6.88">but it flagged my memory because I</text>
  <text start="204.56" dur="6.92">thought back to October of 2016 or Nova</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="5.69">early November when Eric Prince who is</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="5.14">somebody who worked with the campaign</text>
  <text start="213.88" dur="4.84">was involved in the Muller report got an</text>
  <text start="216.62" dur="4.83">immunity agreement in the investigation</text>
  <text start="218.72" dur="6.78">into Muller or an Muller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="221.45" dur="6.42">into Trump would be you know he did this</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="3.989">Breitbart interview where he stated in</text>
  <text start="227.87" dur="4.67">the interview what they found on the</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="6.12">laptop was absolutely horrific that</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="6.4">there were crimes about money laundering</text>
  <text start="235.609" dur="5.551">crimes about crimes about the Clinton</text>
  <text start="238.94" dur="4.29">Foundation all kinds of political things</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="4.889">and corruption involving Democrat</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="5.039">politicians this is Eric prints saying</text>
  <text start="246.049" dur="5.521">this and as he&amp;#39;s saying this to</text>
  <text start="248.269" dur="5.551">Breitbart while he&amp;#39;s explaining why</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="7.02">Comey reopens the the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="6.63">investigation he says and the pushback</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="4.199">on this they said they were gonna go</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="3.87">public with it with the information they</text>
  <text start="262.789" dur="3.331">found on the laptop because they were</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="2.48">upset that nothing was being done about</text>
  <text start="266.12" dur="2.329">it</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="4.079">so this is back in November Eric Prince</text>
  <text start="268.449" dur="4.261">is saying that the NYPD and his sources</text>
  <text start="270.879" dur="3.211">are telling him that they&amp;#39;re so upset</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="3.15">that there&amp;#39;s nothing being done about</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="3.72">this information they found on weiners</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="5.429">laptop that they were gonna go public</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="7.44">with the information and Eric Prince</text>
  <text start="281.289" dur="6.63">says in November of 2016 remember that</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="4.919">look the DOJ was pushing back on them in</text>
  <text start="287.919" dur="3.661">the New York field office so hard that</text>
  <text start="290.169" dur="5.331">they were threatening them with</text>
  <text start="291.58" dur="7.679">prosecution in the Eric garner case</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="5.199">everybody let that go nobody talked</text>
  <text start="299.259" dur="3.63">about it really any more it was</text>
  <text start="300.699" dur="4.801">relegated to conspiracy land and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.889" dur="6.99">why it was relegated to conspiracy land</text>
  <text start="305.5" dur="7.53">because Eric Prince mentions epstein</text>
  <text start="309.879" dur="5.22">Island he says that on the laptop as per</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="4.02">her seize his sources there was</text>
  <text start="315.099" dur="3.421">information about epstein Island and the</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="3.66">fact that Hillary Clinton went there</text>
  <text start="318.52" dur="4.889">around six times and Bill Clinton went</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="5.63">there over 20 times this is what Eric</text>
  <text start="323.409" dur="5.611">Prince says in November of 2016</text>
  <text start="326.34" dur="4.12">again it was relegated to conspiracy</text>
  <text start="329.02" dur="3.69">world because nobody could corroborate</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="4.44">what was going on in the interview he</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="3.9">also mentions that Huma Abedin and</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="3.359">Anthony Weiner have flipped we will get</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="3.179">back to that probably in a stream that I</text>
  <text start="338.259" dur="5.46">do after this interview that I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="339.789" dur="7.141">and people just push it away this was on</text>
  <text start="343.719" dur="6.48">Breitbart okay people just pushed it</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="5.37">away and it went away until Michael</text>
  <text start="350.199" dur="4.321">Horowitz while he was doing the</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="3.919">investigation into how the FBI handled</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="3.57">the mid-year exam which was the</text>
  <text start="356.219" dur="7.06">investigation into Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="7.949">email server he found also that McCabe</text>
  <text start="363.279" dur="5.1">had leaked on October 23rd to the Wall</text>
  <text start="366.039" dur="4.44">Street Journal he had leaked about the</text>
  <text start="368.379" dur="5.521">investigation into the Clinton</text>
  <text start="370.479" dur="5.37">Foundation and you can say that Eric</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="4.139">Prince isn&amp;#39;t trustworthy or you can say</text>
  <text start="375.849" dur="4.591">that he&amp;#39;s no good it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="4.74">and here&amp;#39;s why it doesn&amp;#39;t matter when</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="6.08">Michael Horowitz did the investigation</text>
  <text start="382.779" dur="6.811">into McCabe&amp;#39;s leak McCabe told Horowitz</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="5.17">that they had called the New York field</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="4.379">office he was trying to pawn the leaks</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="4.17">off onto the New York office he called</text>
  <text start="393.969" dur="6.06">the New York office and he complained to</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="4.75">them that that there were leaks going on</text>
  <text start="400.029" dur="2.23">he was</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="3.57">Monning them for the leeks he was trying</text>
  <text start="402.259" dur="3.87">to pin the leeks that he had made on the</text>
  <text start="404.18" dur="4.229">New York field office and Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="406.129" dur="4.59">was on the call with him and McCabe says</text>
  <text start="408.409" dur="4.921">she had made the most strong comments</text>
  <text start="410.719" dur="4.861">he&amp;#39;d ever heard in direction to the New</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="5.489">York field office of the FBI in regards</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="6.42">to the Eric garner case again Eric</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="6">Prince had mentioned the Eric garner</text>
  <text start="422" dur="6.479">case and the pushback from the DOJ back</text>
  <text start="424.819" dur="7.801">in November of 2016 here we are in April</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="5.97">of 2018 getting corroboration that the</text>
  <text start="432.62" dur="4.319">Attorney General of the United States of</text>
  <text start="434.449" dur="4.891">America was pushing on the New York</text>
  <text start="436.939" dur="5.641">field office of the FBI and using the</text>
  <text start="439.34" dur="5.22">Eric garner case I took that and I said</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="3.66">well there&amp;#39;s corroboration of what Eric</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="5.49">Prince was saying because he obviously</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="5.489">knew that they had talked that the DOJ</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="4.56">had talked to the field office because</text>
  <text start="451.729" dur="5.011">he reported the same thing years earlier</text>
  <text start="454.61" dur="4.44">that Horowitz was now putting out to the</text>
  <text start="456.74" dur="4.229">public and an IG report so I wanted to</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="4.889">look a little more closely at all of it</text>
  <text start="460.969" dur="5.25">and when I did I found that Loretta</text>
  <text start="463.939" dur="4.561">Lynch had swapped out the team</text>
  <text start="466.219" dur="4.471">investigating the Eric garner case on</text>
  <text start="468.5" dur="5.879">the federal level days before this call</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="6.029">and there&amp;#39;s reporting about this Justice</text>
  <text start="474.379" dur="5.76">Department shakes up inquiry into garner</text>
  <text start="476.719" dur="6.48">chokehold case this was right before the</text>
  <text start="480.139" dur="5.52">call to the field office in the New York</text>
  <text start="483.199" dur="5.28">office that McCabe and Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="485.659" dur="4.53">made so here we have reports from Eric</text>
  <text start="488.479" dur="3.03">prints that Loretta Lynch and the DOJ</text>
  <text start="490.189" dur="3.78">are threatening the New York field</text>
  <text start="491.509" dur="4.41">office in the garner case and then right</text>
  <text start="493.969" dur="4.051">before that call we have Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="495.919" dur="4.8">taking the investigative team that was</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="6.299">doing that investigation off of the case</text>
  <text start="500.719" dur="7.591">and completely replacing the team from</text>
  <text start="504.319" dur="5.611">New York with new agents so in other</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="3.539">words let me get agents that I know are</text>
  <text start="509.93" dur="5.489">friendly to me into the situation so</text>
  <text start="511.849" dur="5.43">that they can then go ahead and do what</text>
  <text start="515.419" dur="4.651">they were you know what I need them to</text>
  <text start="517.279" dur="4.861">do he held it over them as leverage and</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="4.079">I&amp;#39;ve spoken to a lot of police officers</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="4.11">who&amp;#39;s you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re the bond</text>
  <text start="524.149" dur="4.291">here these are murder charges that are</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="4.17">looking to be dropped down and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.44" dur="4.74">just go and you know no police officer</text>
  <text start="530.42" dur="3.78">wants their brother to be indicted for a</text>
  <text start="533.18" dur="3.33">murder they didn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="534.2" dur="5.46">it was it was a very bad situation to be</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="4.949">in okay so so what what does this have</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="3.869">to do with anything that I said</text>
  <text start="541.459" dur="4.801">yesterday to rehash the story very</text>
  <text start="543.529" dur="5.43">quickly all it has to deal with is that</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="4.56">there was never a decision made in that</text>
  <text start="548.959" dur="4.07">criminal case a you know in Criminal</text>

  <text start="665.66" dur="2.229">do this quick when the suicide started</text>
  <text start="667.55" dur="2.319">back</text>
  <text start="667.889" dur="3.69">the day like months ago I started</text>
  <text start="669.869" dur="5.22">investigating their precincts in their</text>
  <text start="671.579" dur="5.7">locations and I was unable to tie them</text>
  <text start="675.089" dur="3.9">at all in any way shape or form to the</text>
  <text start="677.279" dur="4.74">Weiner laptop and at the time I</text>
  <text start="678.989" dur="5.07">described how big the justice department</text>
  <text start="682.019" dur="4.62">is I mean the New York Police Department</text>
  <text start="684.059" dur="4.61">is how many boroughs it encompasses the</text>

  <text start="688.669" dur="5.35">there is a former NYPD detective who</text>
  <text start="692.249" dur="5.791">also stepped up and said the same thing</text>

  <text start="703.019" dur="3.63">so forth so I don&amp;#39;t feel and I will not</text>
  <text start="705.389" dur="3.69">report by any stretch of the imagination</text>
  <text start="706.649" dur="4.201">at all I would not encourage anyone else</text>
  <text start="709.079" dur="5.67">to be doing so either because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="710.85" dur="6.62">evidence that these officer suicides as</text>
  <text start="714.749" dur="9.601">tragic as they are have anything to do</text>
  <text start="717.47" dur="8.469">with the Eric the the Weiner laptop what</text>
  <text start="724.35" dur="3.329">am I trying to tell you about bar and</text>
  <text start="725.939" dur="3.12">this is for some reason very confusing I</text>

  <text start="729.059" dur="3.541">job here I&amp;#39;m not trying to tell anyone</text>
  <text start="730.919" dur="4.26">that Barra is a black hat to the</text>
  <text start="732.6" dur="4.889">contrary if Barr was a black hat he</text>
  <text start="735.179" dur="5.64">would have pressed charges against the</text>
  <text start="737.489" dur="5.75">officer in the Eric garner case and he</text>
  <text start="740.819" dur="5.07">would have never had ups teen arrested</text>
