  <text start="6.299" dur="4.05">thank you guys for being here today I</text>
  <text start="8.13" dur="3.75">just wanted to say something I had taken</text>
  <text start="10.349" dur="3.74">that video down yesterday that I did</text>
  <text start="11.88" dur="5.79">about the whole debacle and drama</text>
  <text start="14.089" dur="5.171">surrounding that email about Q that was</text>
  <text start="17.67" dur="3.18">just complete lies that I&amp;#39;d never</text>
  <text start="19.26" dur="4.5">addressed in public before at least not</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="4.679">vocally I took it down to do a small</text>
  <text start="23.76" dur="3.839">edit to it because there was something</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="4.621">that I needed to visually remove from it</text>
  <text start="27.599" dur="5.601">and in the interim after I took it down</text>
  <text start="30.15" dur="6.36">I started getting emails from people</text>
  <text start="33.2" dur="5.32">people in the mainstream media asking me</text>
  <text start="36.51" dur="3.959">for comment about my video and I started</text>
  <text start="38.52" dur="4.65">thinking to myself overnight I slept on</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="4.051">it and I you know I well I want to be</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="2.52">able to communicate with you guys and</text>

  <text start="45.69" dur="3.42">explain to you what&amp;#39;s going on at the</text>
  <text start="47.61" dur="3.929">same time I feel like I&amp;#39;m causing more</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="4.32">of a problem that I&amp;#39;m stopping by doing</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="4.231">that because I first of all I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="4.83">completely I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m not interested</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="4.74">in in in any article or speaking to</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="4.349">anybody or anything mainstream press</text>

  <text start="72" dur="4.38">them at respectfully decline I think</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="3.899">that we should all start focusing on</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s really important here and I&amp;#39;m not</text>

  <text start="84.75" dur="3.93">how it&amp;#39;s beneficial it made me feel</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="3.12">better for a moment because my</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="4.92">reputation was being slandered and I</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="4.829">didn&amp;#39;t do anything but in the greater</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="4.14">good I don&amp;#39;t think that it helps our</text>

  <text start="164.46" dur="4.32">with this stuff today let&amp;#39;s get back to</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="5.37">work let&amp;#39;s get back to business this is</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="3.99">interesting to me John Solomon has been</text>
  <text start="171.3" dur="2.97">a very interesting character over the</text>
  <text start="172.77" dur="5.58">past several months with the stories</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="6.03">that he&amp;#39;s been putting out he released a</text>
  <text start="178.35" dur="4.14">story yesterday in regards to Bruce or</text>
  <text start="180.3" dur="5.94">and Christopher steel and from a forty</text>
  <text start="182.49" dur="6.27">thousand from a forty thousand foot view</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="4.23">what most are taking from this is what</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="2.13">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about for a long time</text>
  <text start="190.47" dur="4.62">now</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s Christopher steel had relation</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="5.04">had a relationship with Bruce or above</text>
  <text start="197.28" dur="4.08">and beyond the time that Bruce or I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="2.51">sorry that Christopher steel had been</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="4.74">fired from the FBI</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="5.32">meaning the FBI terminated him as a</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="4.97">confidential human source because he had</text>
  <text start="207.96" dur="6.48">contact with the media in Isikoff and</text>
  <text start="211.07" dur="5.08">then Bruce or decided that he would be</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="4.77">the person to launder that information</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="5.94">inside to the FBI and regards to what</text>
  <text start="219.21" dur="6">steel was giving him he met with him</text>
  <text start="222.09" dur="6.51">after the election and I&amp;#39;d also like to</text>
  <text start="225.21" dur="4.47">throw in here as well that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.6" dur="2.93">interesting to me because I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="4.74">following this BuzzFeed lawsuit and</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="4.57">BuzzFeed is desperately trying to prove</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="6.48">that the dossier is actually a real</text>
  <text start="236.1" dur="7.11">thing and BuzzFeed is now asking members</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="4.77">of the call me and other members of the</text>
  <text start="243.21" dur="3.96">FBI former members the FBI they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="3.93">asking them all kinds of questions to</text>
  <text start="247.17" dur="5.16">validate the dossier such as did Barack</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="4.56">Obama know about the dossier and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.33" dur="4.29">all declining to comment on it just like</text>
  <text start="254.16" dur="4.5">the DNC refused to give the server to</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="4.95">them and the judge is ordered that they</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="5.55">need to answer the questions so BuzzFeed</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.92">is accidentally helping to disprove the</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.16">dossier and breakup Spygate I think</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="8.69">that&amp;#39;s a beautiful beautiful and ironic</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="10.5">cap to this whole thing anyway</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="7.93">so basically Bruce or and his wife</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="6.03">Nellie who worked for fusion GPS are</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="4.83">involved with his dossier after the FBI</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="3.9">had already said that Bruce that that</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="3.599">Christopher Steele was no good</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="3.69">Christopher Steele&amp;#39;s telling things to</text>
  <text start="291.539" dur="4.051">Bruce or Bruce or is laundering those</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="3.54">things back into the FBI his wife and</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="4.23">him are sitting with him for breakfast</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="4.979">all kinds of other things he was he was</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="4.379">demoted he&amp;#39;s still working at the FBI</text>
  <text start="302.009" dur="3.84">but I want to make sure that a couple</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="3.9">things are pointed out here just</text>
  <text start="305.849" dur="3.721">recently Nunez started talking about how</text>
  <text start="308.099" dur="3.901">important Bruce or is going to become</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="3.93">and what I&amp;#39;m seeing happening is as</text>
  <text start="312" dur="3.479">these people are being vetted</text>
  <text start="313.5" dur="4.47">investigated used whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="315.479" dur="4.231">call them the public is starting to get</text>
  <text start="317.97" dur="3.569">drips and leaks of information about</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="3.959">what their real deal is and what they</text>
  <text start="321.539" dur="4.321">actually have on them and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.669" dur="4.65">being done as little chapters and</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="4.799">sections of this investigation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.319" dur="4.44">going on with Hoover and whoever else is</text>
  <text start="330.659" dur="6.63">doing it are being closed and the</text>
  <text start="332.759" dur="7.021">information is safe so why is this</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="7.22">important this broad view of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.78" dur="8.99">going on right now is important because</text>
  <text start="344.509" dur="7.391">it speaks in here about the FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="5.05">it appears that that the fact that Bruce</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="3.509">ORS confidential human source was</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="9">Christopher Steele was not revealed to</text>
  <text start="355.409" dur="8.611">the FISA Court FBI officials now admit</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="3.48">they continue to receive information</text>
  <text start="364.02" dur="3.899">from Steele through or identifying more</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="4.919">than a half dozen times its agents</text>
  <text start="367.919" dur="5.671">interviewed or in late 2016 and 2017 to</text>
  <text start="371.219" dur="4.141">learn what Steele was saying that</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="3.569">continued reliance on Steele after his</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="3.75">termination is certain to raise interest</text>
  <text start="377.159" dur="9.031">in Congress about whether the FBI broke</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="11">its own rules it did it did but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="3.92">more there&amp;#39;s more</text>
