  <text start="53.16" dur="4.59">you our open source meaning anybody can</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="3.871">find them and the only reason why I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="963.47" dur="7.49">the hearing was rescheduled without</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="7.44">Hoover then meadow says I find it very</text>
  <text start="970.96" dur="4.18">coincidental that on November 30th a few</text>
  <text start="973.49" dur="3.84">days before the hearing and after they</text>
  <text start="975.14" dur="3.78">had been noticed that we wanted them to</text>
  <text start="977.33" dur="4.38">come and testify all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="978.92" dur="6.03">start following up who burr ultimately</text>
  <text start="981.71" dur="6.03">balked at the invitation he was just in</text>
  <text start="984.95" dur="4.65">ok he balked at the invitation</text>
  <text start="987.74" dur="3.33">reportedly because he would have to</text>
  <text start="989.6" dur="3.87">appear with the ignored whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="991.07" dur="4.05">and then Amanda Gonzalez Thompson from</text>
  <text start="993.47" dur="4.41">the House Oversight Committee says he</text>
  <text start="995.12" dur="4.65">was never scheduled to testify which is</text>
  <text start="997.88" dur="7.41">it he was scheduled to testify on</text>
  <text start="999.77" dur="9.06">December 5th and he balked at testifying</text>
  <text start="1005.29" dur="6.18">the next time he was scared let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1008.83" dur="6.24">unpack this people ok he was scheduled</text>
  <text start="1011.47" dur="11.01">to descend to testify December 5th he</text>
  <text start="1015.07" dur="10.44">didn&amp;#39;t testify because George HW Bush</text>
  <text start="1022.48" dur="6.17">passed away so that was postponed then</text>
  <text start="1025.51" dur="7.41">they rescheduled another hearing and</text>
  <text start="1028.65" dur="6.43">they didn&amp;#39;t invite him now why am I even</text>
  <text start="1032.92" dur="4.23">bringing this up a couple things if if</text>
  <text start="1035.08" dur="4.32">let&amp;#39;s take the test we&amp;#39;ll take this from</text>
  <text start="1037.15" dur="7.08">two separate ways if John Hoover is not</text>
  <text start="1039.4" dur="6.36">doing anything then he wouldn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1044.23" dur="3.15">testify because he wouldn&amp;#39;t want to let</text>
  <text start="1045.76" dur="3.48">on that he&amp;#39;s not doing anything but he</text>
  <text start="1047.38" dur="3.18">was scheduled to testify December 5th</text>
  <text start="1049.24" dur="3.48">and I&amp;#39;m gonna make a very important</text>
  <text start="1050.56" dur="4.68">point here in a second he was scheduled</text>
  <text start="1052.72" dur="4.02">to testify December 5th he was not</text>
  <text start="1055.24" dur="6.569">to come to us to fight the next one</text>
  <text start="1056.74" dur="7.38">remember this if he was doing ongoing</text>
  <text start="1061.809" dur="4.351">investigations into anything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1064.12" dur="4.95">tasked with he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to say</text>
  <text start="1066.16" dur="5.13">anything anyway and I made the point</text>
  <text start="1069.07" dur="4.65">several times that if Hoover was brought</text>
  <text start="1071.29" dur="4.5">in and actually sat down in front of</text>
  <text start="1073.72" dur="4.89">this committee to talk I was gonna be</text>
  <text start="1075.79" dur="4.47">very disappointed because that would</text>
  <text start="1078.61" dur="3.33">mean that things were winding down and</text>
  <text start="1080.26" dur="3.06">he wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything and he was done</text>
  <text start="1081.94" dur="2.91">and there had been no indictments and</text>
  <text start="1083.32" dur="4.32">now he&amp;#39;s out blabbing to oversight</text>
  <text start="1084.85" dur="4.41">committees about what what is what is</text>
  <text start="1087.64" dur="3">the policy of the FBI and in the</text>
  <text start="1089.26" dur="3.2">Department of Justice they can never</text>
  <text start="1090.64" dur="4.38">confirm or deny an ongoing investigation</text>
  <text start="1092.46" dur="3.4">so if you&amp;#39;ve got John Huber sitting in</text>
  <text start="1095.02" dur="4.38">front of an oversight committee</text>
  <text start="1095.86" dur="5.61">testifying about what is every question</text>
  <text start="1099.4" dur="3.39">response gonna be I can&amp;#39;t confirm or</text>
  <text start="1101.47" dur="3.69">deny the existence of an ongoing</text>
  <text start="1102.79" dur="4.38">investigation or is he gonna say we</text>
  <text start="1105.16" dur="4.32">looked into that we found nothing so</text>
  <text start="1107.17" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s where my concern was with Hoover</text>
  <text start="1109.48" dur="3.27">sitting in front of these guys and</text>
  <text start="1110.65" dur="6.69">everybody else was like oh Hooper&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1112.75" dur="7.5">there this is all a sham no no not in my</text>
  <text start="1117.34" dur="5.46">opinion anyway so I want everyone to use</text>
  <text start="1120.25" dur="6.75">discernment here and not emotion when</text>
  <text start="1122.8" dur="6.84">you react to what people are saying now</text>
  <text start="1127" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s go over some of the things that</text>
  <text start="1129.64" dur="11.88">were actually said in this hearing</text>
  <text start="1132.07" dur="11.52">instead of this instead of this here we</text>
  <text start="1141.52" dur="3.51">go and I&amp;#39;m gonna unpack this I should</text>
  <text start="1143.59" dur="3">have done this back then and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1145.03" dur="3">and I&amp;#39;m very disappointed that I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1146.59" dur="3.06">do it back then but things are so busy</text>
  <text start="1148.03" dur="4.97">but let&amp;#39;s get into it right now so this</text>
  <text start="1149.65" dur="6.779">is the actual hearing of the</text>
  <text start="1153" dur="4.87">whistleblowers quote from the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1156.429" dur="2.971">Foundation now let&amp;#39;s make a distinction</text>
  <text start="1157.87" dur="3.75">about the whistleblowers the</text>
  <text start="1159.4" dur="4.25">whistleblowers are not internal Clinton</text>
  <text start="1161.62" dur="4.559">Foundation whistleblowers they are IRS</text>
  <text start="1163.65" dur="4.81">whistleblowers or outside whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="1166.179" dur="3.75">meaning they did an investigation into</text>
  <text start="1168.46" dur="3.18">the Clinton Foundation spoke to</text>
  <text start="1169.929" dur="4.741">witnesses they have 6,000 pages of</text>
  <text start="1171.64" dur="5.19">information and then they blew the</text>
  <text start="1174.67" dur="4.05">whistle on the corruption on behalf of</text>
  <text start="1176.83" dur="3.69">you know the themselves because they</text>
  <text start="1178.72" dur="4.14">have a financial interest in recovering</text>
  <text start="1180.52" dur="4.77">the money but they also discovered a</text>

  <text start="1185.29" dur="5.08">gets very interesting for me and why</text>
  <text start="1187.43" dur="5.67">I think that dismissing just the ho</text>
  <text start="1190.37" dur="5.13">birthing it technically in this case</text>
  <text start="1193.1" dur="5.91">doesn&amp;#39;t matter and it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="1195.5" dur="6.48">people just want something to talk about</text>
  <text start="1199.01" dur="4.95">in terms of nothing&amp;#39;s happening let&amp;#39;s go</text>

  <text start="1209.12" dur="3.45">seconds I&amp;#39;m gonna go to here and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1210.98" dur="11.04">going to talk about this little</text>
  <text start="1212.57" dur="12.87">interesting exchange here informed me as</text>

  <text start="1225.44" dur="5.61">we presented it so it is incredibly</text>
  <text start="1229.25" dur="6.2">important we&amp;#39;re gonna get back to that</text>
  <text start="1231.05" dur="4.4">and we need the information here we go</text>
  <text start="1239.14" dur="4.78">step out I know some of my concerns and</text>
  <text start="1241.73" dur="5.55">questions have no doubt already been</text>
  <text start="1243.92" dur="4.85">covered but I do want to just bring up a</text>
  <text start="1247.28" dur="3.9">couple of things from my own</text>
  <text start="1248.77" dur="4.63">satisfaction and understanding and I</text>
  <text start="1251.18" dur="4.44">will reiterate the necessity of the</text>
  <text start="1253.4" dur="4.07">documents to be very honest with you I</text>
  <text start="1255.62" dur="5.76">was a little hesitant coming into this</text>
  <text start="1257.47" dur="7.06">second panel here because I feel like</text>
  <text start="1261.38" dur="5.34">you&amp;#39;re using us for your own benefit and</text>
  <text start="1264.53" dur="4.28">we need the information so that we can</text>

  <text start="1294.59" dur="7.26">that interesting why is this interesting</text>
  <text start="1297.17" dur="7.08">because it is portrayed everywhere as</text>
  <text start="1301.85" dur="4.86">though these guys went to this committee</text>
  <text start="1304.25" dur="6.66">as a last-ditch effort to try to get</text>

  <text start="1393.21" dur="4.679">these documents to the FBI</text>
  <text start="1395.399" dur="4.35">yes do you believe that they have opened</text>
  <text start="1397.889" dur="6.03">up an investigation on it based on your</text>
  <text start="1399.749" dur="6.481">conversations with the FBI yes yes so</text>
  <text start="1403.919" dur="5.46">you believe that there is an open</text>

  <text start="1412.379" dur="3.99">office</text>
  <text start="1414.749" dur="3.721">so you believe out of Little Rock</text>

  <text start="1433.559" dur="4.681">in the case fashion in which we</text>
  <text start="1435.48" dur="5.789">presented it all right so that that is</text>
  <text start="1438.24" dur="4.5">incredibly important if you&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="1441.269" dur="3.99">me there&amp;#39;s an open criminal</text>
  <text start="1442.74" dur="4.919">investigation maybe that under maybe</text>
  <text start="1445.259" dur="6.11">that makes sense why mr. Huber was not</text>
  <text start="1447.659" dur="5.791">here because if he wait a second</text>
  <text start="1451.369" dur="4.721">now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1453.45" dur="6.18">not gonna sit here and make wild</text>
  <text start="1456.09" dur="4.11">speculative claims about this lady makes</text>
  <text start="1459.63" dur="3.899">me laugh</text>

  <text start="1463.529" dur="6.201">Meadows is saying that or what he knows</text>
  <text start="1465.48" dur="7.289">or doesn&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;m just gonna say</text>
  <text start="1469.73" dur="6.159">these guys are saying there is an open</text>
  <text start="1472.769" dur="4.681">ongoing investigation criminally into</text>
  <text start="1475.889" dur="6.15">the Clinton Foundation out of Little</text>
  <text start="1477.45" dur="8.4">Rock Arkansas would it make sense in</text>
  <text start="1482.039" dur="11.64">your opinion for John Huber to be</text>
  <text start="1485.85" dur="11.1">mirroring that investigation would it</text>
  <text start="1493.679" dur="10.38">make more sense that the FBI has got it</text>
  <text start="1496.95" dur="9.479">so John Hoover doesn&amp;#39;t have to forget</text>
  <text start="1504.059" dur="5.1">Hoover for a second listen to what these</text>
  <text start="1506.429" dur="4.74">guys are saying there is an active</text>
  <text start="1509.159" dur="4.65">ongoing criminal investigation into the</text>
  <text start="1511.169" dur="4.35">the Clinton Foundation being run at a</text>

  <text start="1515.519" dur="4.02">get into more details into this little</text>
  <text start="1517.26" dur="5.1">unpacking here that I&amp;#39;m gonna go through</text>
  <text start="1519.539" dur="6.301">with you that exemplify just how serious</text>
  <text start="1522.36" dur="5.069">that investigation is and it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1525.84" dur="3.329">care what Hoover&amp;#39;s doing if what these</text>
  <text start="1527.429" dur="3.181">gentlemen are saying is true because he</text>
  <text start="1529.169" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re already investigating it and I</text>
  <text start="1530.61" dur="6.449">can&amp;#39;t see for the life of me why if</text>
  <text start="1533.039" dur="6.27">Hoover why would he do the same</text>
  <text start="1537.059" dur="4.561">investigation he works he&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="1539.309" dur="4.11">Special Counsel remember he&amp;#39;s a US</text>
  <text start="1541.62" dur="3.57">Attorney acting as sort of a special</text>
  <text start="1543.419" dur="3.571">counsel but he&amp;#39;s not a special counsel</text>
  <text start="1545.19" dur="4.17">which means he&amp;#39;s underneath the umbrella</text>
  <text start="1546.99" dur="4.289">of the DOJ which means if the DOJ is</text>
  <text start="1549.36" dur="3.299">already running a criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="1551.279" dur="3.99">into something we&amp;#39;re gonna find out when</text>
  <text start="1552.659" dur="4.051">they started at least when these guys</text>
  <text start="1555.269" dur="3.39">know they were working on it</text>
  <text start="1556.71" dur="4.829">why would Hooper also be doing that</text>
  <text start="1558.659" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s my question it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="1561.539" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m just saying so let&amp;#39;s get into more</text>
  <text start="1563.789" dur="4.02">of this hearing now and more of the gems</text>
  <text start="1565.559" dur="4.23">in here when everybody said like oh no</text>
  <text start="1567.809" dur="4.951">things going on no things oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="1569.789" dur="6.211">really please I understand the want and</text>
  <text start="1572.76" dur="5.58">need for some some folks to just crave</text>
  <text start="1576" dur="4.47">the bad news and the fear porn and the</text>
  <text start="1578.34" dur="3.209">drama I get it and I&amp;#39;m one of those you</text>
  <text start="1580.47" dur="3.15">know I&amp;#39;m one of those people that</text>
  <text start="1581.549" dur="3.961">understands the frustration I have feel</text>
  <text start="1583.62" dur="3.56">it too and if you have any doubt about</text>
  <text start="1585.51" dur="4.88">that just take a look at the interview I</text>
  <text start="1587.18" dur="5.34">just did on I just did an interview on</text>
  <text start="1590.39" dur="4.92">the sharpening report with where I</text>
  <text start="1592.52" dur="5.25">basically talked about my frustrations</text>
  <text start="1595.31" dur="5.1">for an hour so I&amp;#39;m one of you guys</text>
  <text start="1597.77" dur="4.29">telling I&amp;#39;m but I look at the facts here</text>
  <text start="1600.41" dur="3.69">and we&amp;#39;re gonna hear so much in this</text>
  <text start="1602.06" dur="4.89">testimony that indicates something</text>
  <text start="1604.1" dur="4.53">serious is going on people okay in terms</text>
  <text start="1606.95" dur="3.54">of the Clinton Foundation and I just</text>
  <text start="1608.63" dur="5.04">showed you an open case against a guy</text>
  <text start="1610.49" dur="7.5">high up in the uranium one scandal so</text>
  <text start="1613.67" dur="6.27">let&amp;#39;s just take a breath now I want you</text>
  <text start="1617.99" dur="2.52">to listen to what the whistleblowers say</text>
  <text start="1619.94" dur="2.82">next</text>
  <text start="1620.51" dur="4.29">ongoing investigation perhaps that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1622.76" dur="3.81">you didn&amp;#39;t show up that&amp;#39;s why we want</text>
  <text start="1624.8" dur="3.48">you to you as the committee to come to</text>
  <text start="1626.57" dur="4.86">your own logical conclusions and not</text>

  <text start="1635.72" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;ve got in front of you and come to a</text>
  <text start="1636.95" dur="19.2">logical conclusion about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1638.81" dur="21.81">happening some of my concerns did have</text>
  <text start="1656.15" dur="6.39">you been in contact with attorney Huber</text>
  <text start="1660.62" dur="5.76">or anyone on his investigative State</text>
  <text start="1662.54" dur="6.99">team we we sent all of our information</text>
  <text start="1666.38" dur="5.97">and documents to Salt Lake City Utah in</text>
  <text start="1669.53" dur="7.13">early April we provided subsequent</text>

  <text start="1676.66" dur="6.73">then again in mid to late October</text>

  <text start="1683.39" dur="4.77">Attorney&amp;#39;s Office out of Salt Lake was</text>
  <text start="1685.81" dur="3.63">late November I guess was two weeks ago</text>
  <text start="1688.16" dur="4.64">all right so you have it</text>
  <text start="1689.44" dur="7.36">so remember listen to what he said and</text>
  <text start="1692.8" dur="6.39">could he have misspoke yes he said they</text>
  <text start="1696.8" dur="5.4">sent information in April they said</text>
  <text start="1699.19" dur="7.06">subsequent information again twice</text>
  <text start="1702.2" dur="5.55">meaning more so they sent their initial</text>
  <text start="1706.25" dur="4.2">stuff and then they sent more and then</text>
  <text start="1707.75" dur="5.73">they sent more and then he got contacted</text>
  <text start="1710.45" dur="5.25">by Huber&amp;#39;s office just recently now that</text>
  <text start="1713.48" dur="4.41">seems to possibly be indicative of the</text>
  <text start="1715.7" dur="3.54">case that of the fact that Hoover had no</text>
