  <text start="126.93" dur="5.16">expecting a report on how the FBI</text>

  <text start="165.4" dur="5.13">just wanted to explain to everyone what</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="4.83">this is this is an audit the Inspector</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="3.96">General for the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="4.83">went into the FBI and audited their</text>
  <text start="174.49" dur="4.85">program or their policies their</text>
  <text start="176.59" dur="5.16">procedure and how they handle</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="4.63">confidential human sources within the</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="5.04">FBI that could be any human source</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="5.19">whether it&amp;#39;s in the gang division or</text>
  <text start="186.79" dur="4.08">whether it&amp;#39;s in the intelligence like in</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="5.13">an intelligence investigation like we</text>
  <text start="190.87" dur="6.17">saw with Spygate Christopher Steele was</text>
  <text start="194.29" dur="6.42">a excuse me a confidential human source</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="5.97">for the FBI he was what is known as per</text>
  <text start="200.71" dur="6.81">the guidelines inside this report as a</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="8.05">as a long-term confidential human source</text>
  <text start="207.52" dur="5.82">so you&amp;#39;re not going to see criminal</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="6.84">referrals in here because there are no</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="7.68">laws being broken this is people within</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="6.96">the bureau widespread across the entire</text>
  <text start="221.02" dur="9.89">FBI literally who are not follow that</text>
  <text start="224.86" dur="10.56">following policy and procedure at all</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="7.42">every every what this report found is</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="5.55">that in every single area of the</text>
  <text start="238.33" dur="5.04">confidential human source apparatus or</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="5.3">program the FBI did not follow</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="5.13">established norms and guidelines</text>
  <text start="246.27" dur="4.06">completely ignored them I&amp;#39;m gonna try</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="5.25">and make this bigger I think that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="250.33" dur="5.909">it should be my whole screen now they</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="4.56">went into this looking to evaluate the</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="3.841">FBI&amp;#39;s confidential human source program</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="6.9">policies and procedures including its</text>
  <text start="260.08" dur="7.29">validation procedures it sought to</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="2.76">assess the FBI&amp;#39;s policy and procedures</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="2.4">for the use of</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="4.23">non attributable communications between</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="4.98">agents and confidential human sources</text>
  <text start="272.2" dur="4.62">and examine the FBI&amp;#39;s ability to</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="3.72">identify and fill gaps in the alignment</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="5.45">of its sources with the nation&amp;#39;s highest</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="3.8">priority threats and intelligence needs</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="7.3">between 2012 and 2008 een the FBI spent</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="6.18">an average of forty two million dollars</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="9.06">per year paying its confidential human</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="8.04">sources as of May of this year as of May</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="5.16">of this year nearly twenty percent of</text>
  <text start="302.44" dur="4.58">the FBI is confidential human source</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="4.77">base met its definition of a long-term</text>
  <text start="307.02" dur="5.17">confidential human source so I read</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="4.47">through this entire report it goes</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="4.1">through everything the FBI did wrong</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="6.81">which is literally everything from</text>
  <text start="316.29" dur="5.86">taking the policies and procedures and</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="3.24">lumping and you know making the</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="4.019">requirements for following up with this</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="5.1">stuff lay on the shoulders of just a</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="4.711">handful of people if that too completely</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="3.6">ignoring Justice Department guidelines</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="4.5">on how to manage these these</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="5.28">confidential sources to swapping out the</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="5.34">handlers for long term confidential</text>
  <text start="337.84" dur="4.47">sources after a certain length of time</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="4.56">because they&amp;#39;ve been there for too long</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="6.29">like you don&amp;#39;t want your handler to may</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="6.449">you know become close and friends with</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="5.319">their source in a lot of cases these</text>
  <text start="351.729" dur="4.171">sources are criminal occasionally</text>
  <text start="353.919" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re really bad like in one instance</text>
  <text start="355.9" dur="4.41">that they notice they recognize that one</text>
  <text start="358.57" dur="5.52">of these confidential human sources</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="6.33">being used was a pedophile for example</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="4.23">we found that the HS r c-- requested a</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="4.62">confidential human source be closed</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="5.4">because the source was a child sex</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="4.74">offender and they did not believe that</text>
  <text start="373.72" dur="4.14">the benefits of using a child sex</text>
  <text start="376" dur="7.11">offender as a source outweighed the</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="7.29">risks that to me I&amp;#39;m just guessing I</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="5.07">want to be very very clear about this</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="5.54">that I&amp;#39;m guessing it just to me raised</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="5.28">suspicions like I&amp;#39;m like Oh George Nader</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="4.75">but like again this could be any of the</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="4.35">hundreds of confidential human sources</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="4.979">that the FBI is using at any given time</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="3.93">however given that this is run in</text>
  <text start="400.419" dur="4.441">parallel with the invest</text>
  <text start="401.74" dur="7.02">into FISA abuse and that the majority of</text>
  <text start="404.86" dur="6.24">the FISA abuses were were based on</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="5.52">information from a confidential human</text>
  <text start="411.1" dur="8.58">source and that in this report they</text>
  <text start="414.28" dur="7.41">detail on page 15 this because it did</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="4.26">not allocate sufficient resources to</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="4.2">validate all long-term confidential</text>
  <text start="423.94" dur="4.89">human sources in accordance with the AG</text>
  <text start="425.89" dur="4.95">guidelines the FBI increased its risk of</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="3.87">missing warning signs especially for</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="5.9">questionable confidential human sources</text>
  <text start="432.7" dur="6.6">we recommend the FBI does it dedicated</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="4.63">sources resources to ensure that</text>
  <text start="439.3" dur="4.17">long-term validations including</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="3.6">backlogged ones are conducted in</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="4.35">accordance with the requirements of the</text>
  <text start="444.97" dur="4.38">AG guidelines they had turnover in</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="3.42">leadership it was a whole bunch of stuff</text>
  <text start="449.35" dur="7.83">but what I&amp;#39;m really looking to show you</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="13.38">was a specific page hold on I could have</text>
  <text start="457.18" dur="9.06">sworn it was 15 it was pages 15 to 16</text>
  <text start="464.62" dur="4.08">when I was looking at it on my phone not</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="5.25">of the actual report but AB of the F</text>
  <text start="468.7" dur="6.57">maybe it&amp;#39;s this one yeah here we go in</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="6.15">addition this is important in addition</text>
  <text start="475.27" dur="4.14">we found that the long term confidential</text>
  <text start="477.64" dur="4.35">human source validation report this is</text>
  <text start="479.41" dur="5.1">what they used to validate their sources</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="4.05">and to determine whether or not they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="2.73">providing valid information and whether</text>
  <text start="486.04" dur="2.7">or not they&amp;#39;re gonna be using this</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="3.9">source moving forward is this a valid</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="4.5">source there is I&amp;#39;m gonna say this again</text>
  <text start="491.14" dur="6.21">nobody&amp;#39;s going to jail as a comment that</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="7.19">just floated by this is not a report</text>
  <text start="497.35" dur="5.79">that would ever refer someone to prison</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="6.49">you guys have to think about it like</text>
  <text start="503.14" dur="5.31">this like the IG does do reports like</text>
  <text start="506.92" dur="3.96">the FISA report that&amp;#39;ll be in coming</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="5.16">where there is the potential to identify</text>
  <text start="510.88" dur="5.7">law breaking this reports specifically</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="5.85">was an audit it was an internal audit it</text>
  <text start="516.58" dur="5.91">was an IG audit of policy and procedure</text>
  <text start="519.46" dur="6.81">implemented by the FBI for them to</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="5.67">follow within the bureau while the IG</text>
  <text start="526.27" dur="4.17">was investigating and auditing this he</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="4.77">would not have found criminality because</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="4.68">there are no laws involved when they</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="2.56">they there are no laws that form the</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="2.41">base</text>
  <text start="535.49" dur="4.71">of how the FBI deals with their</text>
  <text start="537.53" dur="5.64">confidential human sources it is not in</text>
  <text start="540.2" dur="4.62">that realm so no there&amp;#39;s no criminal</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="4.14">referrals there&amp;#39;s no one going to jail</text>
  <text start="544.82" dur="4.53">based off of this because this does not</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="4.5">identify any crimes committed there are</text>
  <text start="549.35" dur="6.36">no there are tons of guidelines broken</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="8.19">actually all of them but there are no</text>
  <text start="555.71" dur="5.55">laws broken even if what I sent what I</text>
  <text start="560" dur="1.71">saw and I&amp;#39;m going to show you in a</text>
  <text start="561.26" dur="3.87">minute</text>
  <text start="561.71" dur="6.63">happens with Brady material being</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="5.55">withheld because district offices so let</text>
  <text start="568.34" dur="4.68">me before I read the sentence the way</text>
  <text start="570.68" dur="4.44">that they decided and and and the FBI</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="4.23">for a large part under James Comey</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="5.1">decided to handle their confidential</text>
  <text start="577.25" dur="5.82">human sources was to to basically</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="4.8">delegate the responsibility for those</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="4.11">sources to the field offices and then</text>
  <text start="585.02" dur="5.04">take that information that the field</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="5.28">offices compiled and report it back to</text>
  <text start="590.06" dur="3.03">the the main to the Washington office to</text>
  <text start="592.46" dur="3.3">the main office</text>
  <text start="593.09" dur="4.26">where then the team there of people it</text>
  <text start="595.76" dur="3.75">should have been about 20 or something</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="3.87">people from what I&amp;#39;m reading they would</text>
  <text start="599.51" dur="3.72">get together and then determine based</text>
  <text start="601.22" dur="3.42">off that information whether or not the</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="4.11">sources they were using could remain</text>
  <text start="604.64" dur="5.1">sources what risk level they possessed</text>
  <text start="607.34" dur="5.01">or you know what risk level they</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="5.1">presented to be continued being used as</text>
  <text start="612.35" dur="5.37">a source etcetera so on and so forth one</text>
  <text start="614.84" dur="5.76">of the points that is made here is that</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="5.1">a lot of the field offices wouldn&amp;#39;t send</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="4.62">back reporting on certain sources</text>
  <text start="622.82" dur="4.47">because they assessed them to be of a</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="4.32">higher risk level and they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="627.29" dur="4.2">to lose out on their information so they</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="4.22">just didn&amp;#39;t send information on that</text>
  <text start="631.49" dur="5.55">source and because there was absolutely</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="5.23">no oversight of this even though they</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="3.45">had a system in place called Delta that</text>
  <text start="638.99" dur="4.05">was supposed to take care of all of this</text>
  <text start="640.49" dur="6.27">for them there was no oversight into any</text>
  <text start="643.04" dur="6.78">of this so nobody knew the better so the</text>
  <text start="646.76" dur="5.46">people that are in field offices all</text>
  <text start="649.82" dur="3.93">over the country if they&amp;#39;ve got a risky</text>
  <text start="652.22" dur="3.66">source and they don&amp;#39;t want the Maine</text>
