  <text start="390.969" dur="5.67">on SSRI medication now this was a lawyer</text>
  <text start="395.289" dur="4.691">and usually if you want to find out</text>
  <text start="396.639" dur="5.771">truth talk to a lawyer because you know</text>
  <text start="399.98" dur="4.53">they might they might be people that go</text>

  <text start="598.62" dur="7.32">know that within a week that was one of</text>
  <text start="602.28" dur="4.86">the new warnings on the commercials</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="4.05">because back then they had commercials</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="4.44">true this was what 15 years ago they had</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="3.54">commercials then she was all off with a</text>
  <text start="611.58" dur="5.16">little blue pill you know jumping up and</text>
  <text start="613.53" dur="6.03">down and they now added to it may cause</text>

  <text start="627.36" dur="3.6">real they put them there because they</text>
  <text start="629.19" dur="3.78">have to loose their real side effects</text>
  <text start="630.96" dur="4.02">when they say may cause death it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.97" dur="3.18">because someone died when they say may</text>
  <text start="634.98" dur="2.79">close a heart attack it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="636.15" dur="6.24">someone got a heart attack so every one</text>
  <text start="637.77" dur="7.95">of those is real and this is this is</text>
  <text start="642.39" dur="6.18">important to know that our kids are</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="4.47">being given drugs for perks our kids are</text>

  <text start="802.45" dur="3.39">trying to take away our rights so I</text>
  <text start="804.43" dur="3.78">started something called Liberty</text>
  <text start="805.84" dur="5.55">candidates where I had in the first year</text>
  <text start="808.21" dur="7.1">I stood behind I think it was 500</text>
  <text start="811.39" dur="6.389">candidates running for office who were</text>

  <text start="824.5" dur="5.64">factor of them being awake chew liberty</text>
  <text start="827.5" dur="6.06">and freedom and that was the point of it</text>
  <text start="830.14" dur="6.33">well let&amp;#39;s fast-forward again I did that</text>
  <text start="833.56" dur="6.06">for five years and then Sandy Hook</text>
  <text start="836.47" dur="5.19">happens and I will never forget the day</text>
  <text start="839.62" dur="6.86">that i sat there on the computer on</text>
  <text start="841.66" dur="7.77">Facebook watching this take place and</text>
  <text start="846.48" dur="6.49">finding out about the kid who did the</text>
  <text start="849.43" dur="5.4">shooting and I actually was friends</text>
  <text start="852.97" dur="4.2">through my daughter of someone who was</text>
  <text start="854.83" dur="4.56">friends with the brother of this kid who</text>
  <text start="857.17" dur="3.57">did the shooting and she thought it was</text>
  <text start="859.39" dur="3.27">him we all thought it was him as meth</text>
  <text start="860.74" dur="3.39">effects in the beginning they thought it</text>
  <text start="862.66" dur="6.6">was the brother they&amp;#39;re doing it for the</text>
  <text start="864.13" dur="8.61">first couple of hours so we know he had</text>
  <text start="869.26" dur="6.71">autism we were never really told for a</text>
  <text start="872.74" dur="6.27">long time that he was on medication but</text>
  <text start="875.97" dur="4.45">what really bothered me whether he was I</text>
  <text start="879.01" dur="4.11">mean I still don&amp;#39;t know but he was on</text>
  <text start="880.42" dur="4.29">medication but I mean I I&amp;#39;m gonna assume</text>
  <text start="883.12" dur="4.41">because usually kids who are autistic</text>
  <text start="884.71" dur="5.04">have some sort of medication anyway</text>
  <text start="887.53" dur="7.14">the point of it was that I lived in New</text>
  <text start="889.75" dur="6.78">York State and right away right in the</text>
  <text start="894.67" dur="3.39">middle of the night it was like December</text>
  <text start="896.53" dur="5.67">15th when it happened I think that was</text>
  <text start="898.06" dur="5.67">the day again not a few weeks later they</text>
  <text start="902.2" dur="4.23">come up with something called in New</text>
  <text start="903.73" dur="4.26">York SAFE Act which was a complete</text>
  <text start="906.43" dur="3.779">infringement on the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="907.99" dur="5.55">because again they were blaming it on</text>
  <text start="910.209" dur="6.031">guns and they push this through in the</text>
  <text start="913.54" dur="4.56">middle of the night nobody even read the</text>
  <text start="916.24" dur="4.11">bill it was you and I fighting that</text>
  <text start="918.1" dur="5.55">remember we were just sitting there in</text>

  <text start="927.82" dur="4.46">the hole in</text>
  <text start="929.19" dur="5.72">fire assembly and sinning of New York</text>

  <text start="943.83" dur="6.33">assemblyman from upstate and he stood up</text>
  <text start="946.2" dur="6.09">and he said do you think that maybe we</text>
  <text start="950.16" dur="4.91">should talk about the fact that a lot of</text>
  <text start="952.29" dur="6.27">the school shootings are done by kids on</text>
  <text start="955.07" dur="6.04">medication and he said that my heart</text>
