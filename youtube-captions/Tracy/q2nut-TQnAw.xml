  <text start="0.03" dur="6.51">good morning it is Thursday February 14</text>
  <text start="3.57" dur="5.94">2009 teen at 11:12 a.m. Eastern Time</text>
  <text start="6.54" dur="5.79">happy Valentine&amp;#39;s Day and a very big</text>
  <text start="9.51" dur="4.86">warm and loving welcome to everybody who</text>
  <text start="12.33" dur="3.599">is here from Seth Abramson&amp;#39;s Twitter</text>
  <text start="14.37" dur="4.829">account I hope you learned something</text>
  <text start="15.929" dur="6.211">while you&amp;#39;re here and that you find some</text>
  <text start="19.199" dur="4.92">new little nuggets of knowledge for my</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="5.639">channel it&amp;#39;s good to have you</text>
  <text start="24.119" dur="6.871">we&amp;#39;re gonna go over the oral arguments</text>
  <text start="27.779" dur="6.721">from the appeal of the sharyl Attkisson</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="5.01">case about the government spying just to</text>
  <text start="34.5" dur="3.3">summarize quickly if you haven&amp;#39;t caught</text>
  <text start="36" dur="4.68">my other parts to this basically what</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="4.68">happened is there&amp;#39;s clear and compelling</text>
  <text start="40.68" dur="4.62">forensic evidence that&amp;#39;s sharyl</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="4.8">Attkisson was hacked and spied upon by</text>
  <text start="45.3" dur="5.43">the government on her electronic devices</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="5.97">including one from CBS news the court</text>
  <text start="50.73" dur="5.399">case was going through the motions but</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="5.489">the problem came in because there were</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="4.651">John Doe defendants listed on the suit</text>
  <text start="58.739" dur="4.71">because Cheryl and her attorneys were</text>
  <text start="60.78" dur="5.129">unable to identify who the agents were</text>
  <text start="63.449" dur="5.46">that were doing physically doing this</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="5.941">act they had a very very short window of</text>
  <text start="68.909" dur="6.691">discovery at which during which they</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="7.62">were completely sidetracked and and and</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="6.21">you know objection after objection after</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="3.899">stall tactic after stall tactic and that</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="5.12">comes up in this hearing as well will</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="7.581">you&amp;#39;ll hear in the oral arguments and</text>
  <text start="86.93" dur="6.91">basically they were never able to get</text>
  <text start="90.95" dur="4.419">the information that they would need to</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="6.09">then be able to make the determination</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="6.511">of who the John Doe defendants are which</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="3.96">is why they&amp;#39;re why this lawsuit was</text>
  <text start="101.88" dur="3.36">dismissed basically the judge said you</text>
  <text start="103.89" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t even know who these people are you</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="4.769">can&amp;#39;t possibly make an argument you know</text>
  <text start="108.72" dur="3.39">for sue someone you don&amp;#39;t know who they</text>
  <text start="110.009" dur="5.43">are you we gave you discovery couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="6.03">figure it out it&amp;#39;s over the attorney for</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.231">a sharyl Attkisson as well as the</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="4.68">parties to the lawsuit disagree with</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="5.489">that wholeheartedly hence the appeal so</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="4.46">in an appeal hearing an applet hearing</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="4.531">basically what happens is each each</text>
  <text start="127.28" dur="4.47">counsel gets a certain allotted amount</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="5.09">of time to argue</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="5.91">first we hear Sheryl Atkins attorney</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="4.83">arguing their side the judges stop and</text>
  <text start="137.66" dur="4.14">ask questions and make points and things</text>
  <text start="139.61" dur="3.69">of that nature then after that the</text>
  <text start="141.8" dur="3.9">lawyer for the government comes up and</text>
  <text start="143.3" dur="7.47">does their argument very very a lot</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="8.79">shorter and then there&amp;#39;s also a a named</text>
  <text start="150.77" dur="5.25">unnamed I forget the exact name of what</text>
  <text start="154.49" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s called one there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="3.84">escaping me there&amp;#39;s a defendant where</text>
  <text start="158.36" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s a party on the lawsuit was not</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="4.2">accused of wrongdoing per se or is not</text>
  <text start="162.32" dur="4.29">being sued but they&amp;#39;re a party to the</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="4.62">suit Verizon so Verizon has their</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="4.77">attorney there as well and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="5.04">interesting quandary because the lawyer</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="6.03">for the government speaks up and tries</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="5.85">to make a defense on behalf of the John</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="4.11">Doe defendants even though the attorney</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="4.74">for the government is not representing</text>
  <text start="181.52" dur="6.03">said John Doe defendants and the judges</text>
  <text start="184.31" dur="5.4">in this case say you know you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="187.55" dur="3.78">that you you can&amp;#39;t argue for them you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.71" dur="2.58">not representing them and the government</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="4.83">says you know what you&amp;#39;re absolutely</text>
  <text start="192.29" dur="6.9">right I can&amp;#39;t all all in all it really</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="6.84">it&amp;#39;s a lot better if you listen to this</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="6.15">on your own but basically the judges</text>
  <text start="203" dur="4.2">that are asking the questions here are</text>
  <text start="205.34" dur="3.899">they I don&amp;#39;t want to say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.2" dur="3.78">sympathetic I think that they see what</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="4.141">the problem is here and why there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="5.31">issue they do criticize the attorney</text>
  <text start="213.38" dur="4.77">that was in charge of Cheryl&amp;#39;s case who</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="4.86">is not the arguing attorney in this</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="5.55">appeal they criticize him for or the the</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="4.2">team for not doing a more robust</text>
  <text start="223.7" dur="4.259">discovery in the length of time that</text>
  <text start="225.35" dur="4.47">they had and the one female judge you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="227.959" dur="4.611">hear on the tape is kind of responsible</text>
  <text start="229.82" dur="6.06">for that but I think their role is to be</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="5.02">difficult ish or challenging to the case</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="5.97">I mean they&amp;#39;re trying to determine why</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="6.42">it is they should reverse a ruling done</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="5.609">by by another court and that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="6.63">deal so appeals are important because</text>
  <text start="247.459" dur="4.711">you know there are things that happen in</text>
  <text start="250.64" dur="3.84">court cases all the time that just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="5.34">seem fair so an appellate court serves a</text>
  <text start="254.48" dur="6.3">very important function I want to ask</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="5.07">everybody again to please go to Cheryl</text>

  <text start="403.76" dur="6.51">Attkisson and her family i in this</text>
  <text start="406.67" dur="6.18">matter the actus ins complaint in this</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="5.22">case must be allowed to proceed to a</text>
  <text start="412.85" dur="5.22">full discovery process at least with</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="4.53">regard to the actual governmental agents</text>
  <text start="418.07" dur="3.69">alleged to have hacked into their</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="4.02">computer systems</text>
  <text start="421.76" dur="4.05">if the factual allegations in this case</text>
  <text start="424.04" dur="3.75">are not sufficient at least to go to</text>
  <text start="425.81" dur="5.19">discovery against those John Doe</text>
  <text start="427.79" dur="5.79">defendants it&amp;#39;s difficult to see how any</text>
  <text start="431" dur="4.61">citizen will ever be able to challenge</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="3.96">warrantless government surveillance</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="4.75">absent an actual government</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="4.83">whistleblowers with regard to those John</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="3.81">Doe agents there&amp;#39;s been almost no</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="3.66">argument put forth either by the</text>
  <text start="444.17" dur="4.13">district court or the government as to</text>
  <text start="446.03" dur="6.27">why the actions claims are insufficient</text>
  <text start="448.3" dur="6.91">they are just the Bivens case for the</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="5.63">electronic age is suit seeking monetary</text>
  <text start="455.21" dur="5.25">damages for a single individual</text>
  <text start="457.93" dur="5.41">unconstitutional search they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="460.46" dur="5.07">indisputably within the Electronic</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="4.02">Communications Privacy Act because as to</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="4.56">the John does we don&amp;#39;t have to interpret</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="4.92">procurer liability as I understand it</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="5.45">the district court dismissed the John</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="6.63">Doe action because it couldn&amp;#39;t specify</text>
  <text start="475.54" dur="4.78">but it seems like to me I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="478.91" dur="4.08">understand that you didn&amp;#39;t have a chance</text>
  <text start="480.32" dur="4.41">I guess that would be your argument does</text>
  <text start="482.99" dur="4.53">that was B by argument we have not had a</text>
  <text start="484.73" dur="5.16">chance it&amp;#39;s undisputed that although</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="6.23">there was a brief window of discovery</text>
  <text start="489.89" dur="7.02">granted during that discovery because of</text>
  <text start="493.75" dur="6.25">motions for protective orders and</text>
  <text start="496.91" dur="5.52">renewed motions to dismiss there hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500" dur="5.16">really been any actual discovery there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="4.47">been one a grand total of one deposition</text>
  <text start="505.16" dur="2.8">there were subpoenas that were there</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="3.31">were documents that were</text>
  <text start="507.96" dur="5.249">quested of the government which we never</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="6.84">received and so effectively there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="513.209" dur="8.241">no discovery and so the we review for</text>
  <text start="517.05" dur="9.33">abuse of discretion right you review the</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="8.53">district court&amp;#39;s decision termination of</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="6.39">how to run the trial process for abuse</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="7.47">of discretion but in this case she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="6.84">dismissing on Twombly and Iqbal I was</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="6.21">referring back to the question my</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="6.419">colleague which was about the john doe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="5.67">and whether or not you had a chance</text>
  <text start="546.029" dur="7.701">that&amp;#39;s a discovery question right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="6.69">not the ultimate question well so</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="5.62">presumably it&amp;#39;s a little bit unclear but</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="7.5">presumably she is dismissing against the</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="8.25">john doe&amp;#39;s because the complaint as it</text>
  <text start="563.52" dur="6.48">stands doesn&amp;#39;t state sufficient factual</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="4.47">allegations against them under the</text>
  <text start="570" dur="4.68">Twombly and Iqbal standard so we would</text>
  <text start="572.07" dur="4.92">submit that that is not an abuse of</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="4.529">discretion question if we want to</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="7.62">challenge the way the district court</text>
  <text start="579.209" dur="7.141">managed the course of the discovery that</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="4.95">strikes me as a different question</text>
  <text start="586.35" dur="7.049">I think it&amp;#39;s undisputed well if you had</text>
  <text start="589.56" dur="6.87">time to come up with the names which she</text>
  <text start="593.399" dur="4.921">seemed to think you did then that is a</text>
  <text start="596.43" dur="3.599">discovery question whether or not you</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="4.2">did and whether or not she abused her</text>
  <text start="600.029" dur="5.161">discretion because I think that I think</text>
  <text start="602.52" dur="4.68">that that&amp;#39;s a hard issue too but it</text>
  <text start="605.19" dur="4.05">seemed to me that we were sort of stuck</text>
  <text start="607.2" dur="4.8">with abuse of discretion with respect</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="7.49">again three months got some extra time</text>
  <text start="612" dur="7.77">you got some more extra time you know I</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="4.83">so we would submit that it&amp;#39;s also an</text>
  <text start="619.77" dur="4.259">abuse of discretion because there was no</text>
  <text start="621.56" dur="5.23">actual time for discovery because</text>
  <text start="624.029" dur="5.491">although there were three months during</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="7.109">that period most of the time was spent</text>
  <text start="629.52" dur="6.12">litigating the question did you put all</text>
  <text start="633.899" dur="4.321">that to the district judge say we really</text>
  <text start="635.64" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t have three months I</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="3.81">so I just didn&amp;#39;t read the record that</text>
  <text start="639.66" dur="3.33">way and so you know I know but things</text>
  <text start="642.03" dur="3.39">are different when you&amp;#39;re in the trough</text>
  <text start="642.99" dur="4.74">board you&amp;#39;re going a mile a minute but</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="5.52">still what we have is the record so what</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="7.05">the what the trial counsel did is to try</text>
  <text start="650.94" dur="7.02">Esper Utley to respond to the district</text>
  <text start="654.78" dur="8.73">court&amp;#39;s order that he tried to come up</text>
  <text start="657.96" dur="8.91">with names for defendants he did end up</text>
  <text start="663.51" dur="4.92">trying to add Verizon as a name because</text>
  <text start="666.87" dur="4.35">that was the only one that he was able</text>
  <text start="668.43" dur="5.04">to come up with but during that time</text>
  <text start="671.22" dur="4.86">there was no opportunity no true</text>
  <text start="673.47" dur="5.04">discovery opportunity to come up with</text>
  <text start="676.08" dur="6.53">names and it seems to me that it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="678.51" dur="7.14">be the case that this kind of discovery</text>
  <text start="682.61" dur="5.26">matched with Twombly and Iqbal should</text>
  <text start="685.65" dur="5.27">effectively be allowed to overrule</text>
  <text start="687.87" dur="8.87">Bivens remember Bivens is against six</text>
  <text start="690.92" dur="8.29">unnamed officers right though that case</text>
  <text start="696.74" dur="4.3">went up to the Supreme Court and the</text>
  <text start="699.21" dur="5.34">Supreme Court didn&amp;#39;t say well you</text>
  <text start="701.04" dur="5.19">haven&amp;#39;t named the people therefore we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="704.55" dur="5.22">not going to allow this case to go</text>
  <text start="706.23" dur="6.27">forward and so I think on either an</text>
  <text start="709.77" dur="5.76">abuse of discretion standard or on the</text>
  <text start="712.5" dur="5.52">de novo review of Twombly and Iqbal it</text>
  <text start="715.53" dur="5.79">seems to me that this claim at least</text>
  <text start="718.02" dur="5.82">with regard to the john doe&amp;#39;s has to go</text>
  <text start="721.32" dur="6.45">forward otherwise the government can</text>
  <text start="723.84" dur="7.17">effectively use their refusal to engage</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="5.88">in discovery their motions for</text>
  <text start="731.01" dur="6.84">protective orders and Twombly and Iqbal</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="7.08">to create absolute immunity in a</text>
  <text start="737.85" dur="5.28">surveillance case because the evidence</text>
  <text start="740.73" dur="5.55">is always going to be had in the hands</text>
  <text start="743.13" dur="4.02">of the government there&amp;#39;s no way for the</text>
  <text start="746.28" dur="3.78">actus ins</text>
  <text start="747.15" dur="5.85">to know who the people are who might</text>
  <text start="750.06" dur="4.89">have engaged in this activity you were</text>
  <text start="753" dur="7.32">not trial counsel is that correct I was</text>
  <text start="754.95" dur="10.31">not trial counsel no the it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="760.32" dur="4.94">to recognize it seems to me that the</text>
  <text start="765.74" dur="4.349">allegations that were in the complaint</text>
  <text start="767.91" dur="3.4">were not sort of fly-by-night</text>
  <text start="770.089" dur="3.771">allegations</text>
  <text start="771.31" dur="5.07">they weren&amp;#39;t allegations oh well my</text>
  <text start="773.86" dur="24.09">computer shut down and I think the</text>
  <text start="776.38" dur="23.73">government might have done it I would</text>
  <text start="797.95" dur="4.35">say it&amp;#39;s a little bit confusing exactly</text>
  <text start="800.11" dur="4.65">how the court handled this case well I</text>
  <text start="802.3" dur="5.729">think the answer to that yes and they</text>
  <text start="804.76" dur="7.22">also denied leave to amend so they they</text>
  <text start="808.029" dur="6.81">deny so that the district court denied a</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="6.19">granted the 12 B 6 motion so in that</text>
  <text start="814.839" dur="5.361">sense it was on a 12 B 6 the footnote</text>
  <text start="818.17" dur="4.38">having to do with the John Doe</text>
  <text start="820.2" dur="4.93">defendants specifically I would say is</text>
  <text start="822.55" dur="6.99">ambiguous as to what the basis is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="825.13" dur="11.54">don&amp;#39;t like footnote 2 page 4 I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="829.54" dur="12.78">about footnote 3 in joint appendix 669</text>
  <text start="836.67" dur="9.01">page 6 and in that footnote she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="842.32" dur="6.99">really say under what basis I would say</text>
  <text start="845.68" dur="6.09">my argument would be that it was joined</text>
  <text start="849.31" dur="6.15">to the 12 B 6 motion and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="851.77" dur="7.02">explaining why she is also granting the</text>
  <text start="855.46" dur="5.25">Twombly iqbal 12 B 6 motion with regard</text>
  <text start="858.79" dur="3.69">to the John Doe defend the rationale is</text>
  <text start="860.71" dur="3.36">that you haven&amp;#39;t identified anybody and</text>
  <text start="862.48" dur="3.18">as I say then you have to go back and</text>
  <text start="864.07" dur="3.9">look at the record and see how much time</text>
  <text start="865.66" dur="3.09">you had and say what and I know it</text>
  <text start="867.97" dur="2.76">wasn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="868.75" dur="4.92">what representations were made to the</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="5.04">district court like we do they the</text>
  <text start="873.67" dur="5.16">discovery request that your side made</text>
  <text start="875.77" dur="4.59">were extremely broad I mean I I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="878.83" dur="4.44">really faulting you I&amp;#39;m just saying that</text>
  <text start="880.36" dur="5.94">if you don&amp;#39;t lay it out it&amp;#39;s not there</text>
  <text start="883.27" dur="5.16">so the trial counsel tried to make</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="5.01">discovery requests that were informed</text>
  <text start="888.43" dur="8.67">specifically by David scantling who was</text>
  <text start="891.31" dur="9.57">the forensic expert that the plaintiff</text>
  <text start="897.1" dur="5.54">had hired and David scantling again is</text>
  <text start="900.88" dur="4.88">not a fly-by-night person he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.64" dur="6.3">work for the NSA he&amp;#39;s a major forensic</text>
  <text start="905.76" dur="6.39">analysts and he filed a or the the</text>
  <text start="908.94" dur="5.76">plaintiff filed an affidavit saying the</text>
  <text start="912.15" dur="5.04">requests we are making are the minimum</text>
  <text start="914.7" dur="5.13">requests we need to do the forensic</text>
  <text start="917.19" dur="6.42">analysis that would determine the</text>
  <text start="919.83" dur="6.75">factual basis for our complaint remember</text>
  <text start="923.61" dur="6.06">on a motion to dismiss we&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="926.58" dur="5.79">take all of the factual allegations in</text>
  <text start="929.67" dur="5.25">the complaint as true now if the legal</text>
  <text start="932.37" dur="5.01">conclusions but here we&amp;#39;ve got a huge</text>
  <text start="934.92" dur="4.92">number of factual allegations that are</text>
  <text start="937.38" dur="5.91">far more specific than in Twombly for</text>
  <text start="939.84" dur="5.73">example where it was just you know that</text>
  <text start="943.29" dur="3.84">we think that there was a conspiracy but</text>
  <text start="945.57" dur="3.09">we don&amp;#39;t know when we don&amp;#39;t know under</text>
  <text start="947.13" dur="5.04">what circumstances and we don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="948.66" dur="7.7">details here there&amp;#39;s a specific</text>
  <text start="952.17" dur="8.1">timeframe there&amp;#39;s evidence connected to</text>
  <text start="956.36" dur="6.6">or there&amp;#39;s allegations connected to why</text>
  <text start="960.27" dur="7.5">the Justice Department might have been</text>
  <text start="962.96" dur="6.94">interested in MS Atkeson and there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="967.77" dur="4.65">forensic analysis that was done that</text>
  <text start="969.9" dur="4.71">indicates both that her computer was</text>
  <text start="972.42" dur="4.5">hacked into and that it was from a</text>
  <text start="974.61" dur="5.19">government IP address now there may be</text>
  <text start="976.92" dur="4.65">answers to that there may be answers the</text>
  <text start="979.8" dur="4.53">government could give though they</text>
  <text start="981.57" dur="7.08">haven&amp;#39;t answered anything yet there may</text>
  <text start="984.33" dur="6.39">be challenges to mr. Scantlin or the</text>
  <text start="988.65" dur="4.62">other forensic analysis but that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="990.72" dur="7.13">discovery and trial is for and we</text>
  <text start="993.27" dur="7.8">haven&amp;#39;t had any of that in this case and</text>
  <text start="997.85" dur="5.23">hello was this lawsuit pending the</text>
  <text start="1001.07" dur="5.73">lawsuit has been pending for quite a</text>
  <text start="1003.08" dur="5.31">long time many years but it&amp;#39;s not always</text>
  <text start="1006.8" dur="4.56">in front of this district court correct</text>
  <text start="1008.39" dur="4.14">it was originally filed in Washington it</text>
  <text start="1011.36" dur="4.98">got transferred</text>
  <text start="1012.53" dur="7.32">it&amp;#39;s sat for years literally filed in</text>
  <text start="1016.34" dur="7.609">February of 2015 that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="1019.85" dur="8.16">what about dismissed in May of 2018</text>
  <text start="1023.949" dur="7.331">correct but during that entire time the</text>
  <text start="1028.01" dur="5.67">only window of discovery was during</text>
  <text start="1031.28" dur="4.75">those a couple of months that we talked</text>
  <text start="1033.68" dur="4.87">about earlier and during that pier</text>
  <text start="1036.03" dur="7.89">again most of that time was spent</text>
  <text start="1038.55" dur="7.68">litigating the challenges by the</text>
  <text start="1043.92" dur="4.86">defendants to the scope of the discovery</text>
  <text start="1046.23" dur="4.8">request themselves so in actual fact</text>
  <text start="1048.78" dur="7.32">there&amp;#39;s been one deposition and no</text>
  <text start="1051.03" dur="7.08">documents and given the seriousness of</text>
  <text start="1056.1" dur="4.56">the of the complaint and the factual</text>
  <text start="1058.11" dur="4.56">allegations in the complaint it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1060.66" dur="5.61">the plaintiffs fault that this case has</text>
  <text start="1062.67" dur="5.78">been sitting for so long there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="1066.27" dur="4.71">whole set obviously of complicated</text>
  <text start="1068.45" dur="4.78">you&amp;#39;re right there&amp;#39;s a lot of this is</text>
  <text start="1070.98" dur="4.68">not their fault but once you get in</text>
  <text start="1073.23" dur="4.68">front of this district judge and then</text>
  <text start="1075.66" dur="4.65">you have these these disputes about what</text>
  <text start="1077.91" dur="5.79">is to be given and you have a hearing on</text>
  <text start="1080.31" dur="6.86">January 12 right and then the court the</text>
  <text start="1083.7" dur="6.21">district judge is the magistrate is</text>
  <text start="1087.17" dur="7.35">unhappy with the progress that is being</text>
  <text start="1089.91" dur="9.59">made and tells your predecessor to focus</text>
  <text start="1094.52" dur="8.5">and yet you didn&amp;#39;t focus he did it for</text>
  <text start="1099.5" dur="6.61">16 days elapsed after the hearing in</text>
  <text start="1103.02" dur="4.98">which he didn&amp;#39;t do anything so my</text>
  <text start="1106.11" dur="5.58">understanding is that trial counsel</text>
  <text start="1108" dur="6.21">during that time a filed document</text>
  <text start="1111.69" dur="7.17">requests of the government and be tried</text>
  <text start="1114.21" dur="10.95">to get depositions of the defendants in</text>
  <text start="1118.86" dur="9.84">this case and that&amp;#39;s the same broad</text>
  <text start="1125.16" dur="5.7">requests it didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t focus I</text>
  <text start="1128.7" dur="3.57">mean maybe ultimately he&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="1130.86" dur="2.88">all this evidence but he&amp;#39;s gotten a</text>
  <text start="1132.27" dur="2.88">pretty clear indication from the</text>
  <text start="1133.74" dur="4.38">magistrate judge look as it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1135.15" dur="4.8">pending a long time not purpose in front</text>
  <text start="1138.12" dur="4.86">of them that court but in the federal</text>
  <text start="1139.95" dur="5.49">court and I take totally take your point</text>
  <text start="1142.98" dur="4.5">that a lot of that predecessor was not</text>
  <text start="1145.44" dur="4.14">your fault but you&amp;#39;ve gotten an</text>
  <text start="1147.48" dur="5.27">indication to go do something and you</text>
  <text start="1149.58" dur="5.82">you don&amp;#39;t limit what you&amp;#39;re asking for</text>
  <text start="1152.75" dur="3.88">you know I get III know maybe we</text>
  <text start="1155.4" dur="3.03">wouldn&amp;#39;t none of us would have ruled</text>
  <text start="1156.63" dur="4.02">that way but I just think that that</text>
  <text start="1158.43" dur="6.99">since what you&amp;#39;re doing now is focusing</text>
  <text start="1160.65" dur="6.72">on the the doe defendants it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="1165.42" dur="3.63">hard to say there&amp;#39;s an abuse of</text>
  <text start="1167.37" dur="5.29">discretion here</text>
  <text start="1169.05" dur="5.77">so again I think that the the because</text>
  <text start="1172.66" dur="4.92">the district court dismissed this on a</text>
  <text start="1174.82" dur="5.97">twelve B six motion it&amp;#39;s not an abuse of</text>
  <text start="1177.58" dur="5.28">discretion review okay she dismissed the</text>
  <text start="1180.79" dur="4.11">John Doe defendants and we would argue</text>
  <text start="1182.86" dur="5.7">she&amp;#39;s dismissed the John Doe defendants</text>
  <text start="1184.9" dur="5.16">in a contravention to clear legal</text>
  <text start="1188.56" dur="4.11">principles and essentially is using</text>
  <text start="1190.06" dur="5.94">Trombley and Iqbal to overrule Bivens so</text>
  <text start="1192.67" dur="4.68">we have to find that this is a that</text>
  <text start="1196" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re not going on your piece of</text>
  <text start="1197.35" dur="6.36">discretion that I think ordinarily</text>
  <text start="1199.42" dur="6.69">applies to a discovery dispute I think</text>
  <text start="1203.71" dur="4.59">this also would satisfy abuse of</text>
  <text start="1206.11" dur="4.59">discretion standard in this particular</text>
  <text start="1208.3" dur="4.41">case because given the kind of</text>
  <text start="1210.7" dur="4.41">allegations these are hard allegations</text>
  <text start="1212.71" dur="5.46">to prove there&amp;#39;s no question right we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1215.11" dur="5.13">got forensic issues we don&amp;#39;t have we we</text>
  <text start="1218.17" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t know who the defendants are it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1220.24" dur="5.07">hard to figure out exactly what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1222.58" dur="5.25">looking for and so you know the requests</text>
  <text start="1225.31" dur="4.65">have to be relatively broad we have to</text>
  <text start="1227.83" dur="3.66">try to find who in the government might</text>
  <text start="1229.96" dur="5.04">have authorized this or might be</text>
  <text start="1231.49" dur="6.48">responsible depositions were tried to be</text>
  <text start="1235" dur="5.85">scheduled but the scheduling ended up</text>
  <text start="1237.97" dur="7.32">happening in mid to late February which</text>
  <text start="1240.85" dur="9.39">was after the deadline so he tried I</text>
  <text start="1245.29" dur="7.59">think to make that tiny little period of</text>
  <text start="1250.24" dur="6.03">which again the first two months were</text>
  <text start="1252.88" dur="7.53">spent litigating the scope and to make</text>
  <text start="1256.27" dur="7.83">that the basis for a 12 B 6 dismissal in</text>
  <text start="1260.41" dur="5.91">a case of this import with these kinds</text>
  <text start="1264.1" dur="4.89">of factual allegations where we really</text>
  <text start="1266.32" dur="5.64">have not just a random fishing</text>
  <text start="1268.99" dur="5.01">expedition but we have true factual</text>
  <text start="1271.96" dur="4.41">allegations that go on to pages and</text>
  <text start="1274" dur="4.89">pages that are built on actual forensic</text>
  <text start="1276.37" dur="5.37">analysis I think that would satisfy an</text>
  <text start="1278.89" dur="4.8">abuse of discretion as well but I also</text>
  <text start="1281.74" dur="5.52">think that because she dismissed it on a</text>
  <text start="1283.69" dur="5.61">12 B 6 motion it should not be reviewed</text>
  <text start="1287.26" dur="7.34">for abuse of discretion it should be</text>
  <text start="1289.3" dur="8.57">reviewed de novo now I also think that</text>
  <text start="1294.6" dur="4.75">the claims against holder and Donahoe</text>
  <text start="1297.87" dur="6.76">should</text>
  <text start="1299.35" dur="7.86">it should be reviewed it meaning the</text>
  <text start="1304.63" dur="4.35">district court&amp;#39;s dismissal of each of</text>
  <text start="1307.21" dur="5.01">the various claims including the John</text>
  <text start="1308.98" dur="5.7">Doe defendants on the government&amp;#39;s 12 B</text>
  <text start="1312.22" dur="5.22">6 motion and that that should be</text>
  <text start="1314.68" dur="13.02">reviewed de novo as with any 12 B 6</text>
  <text start="1317.44" dur="13.11">motion so if you if your honors wish to</text>
  <text start="1327.7" dur="5.46">think of this in terms of whether the</text>
  <text start="1330.55" dur="5.67">district court provided a sufficient</text>
  <text start="1333.16" dur="24.18">discovery period for claims of this</text>
  <text start="1336.22" dur="33.33">magnitude and this type the court didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1357.34" dur="15.09">because I don&amp;#39;t see those issues apply</text>
  <text start="1369.55" dur="6.69">you got to deal with that first</text>
  <text start="1372.43" dur="6.18">an abuse of discretion standard seems to</text>
  <text start="1376.24" dur="5.13">me and you acknowledge that in your</text>
  <text start="1378.61" dur="4.92">brief page 2 did the district court</text>
  <text start="1381.37" dur="3.63">abused its discretion in denying the</text>
  <text start="1383.53" dur="3.39">atkinson&amp;#39;s leave to amend their</text>
  <text start="1385" dur="3.81">complaint to drag the rise in defendants</text>
  <text start="1386.92" dur="4.56">giving the extent of the rise ins</text>
  <text start="1388.81" dur="4.68">involvement was only covered uncovered</text>
  <text start="1391.48" dur="4.02">through the limited discovery permitted</text>
  <text start="1393.49" dur="3.66">by the court and given the federal we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1395.5" dur="3.45">all similar procedure dictates the court</text>
  <text start="1397.15" dur="3.27">should be freely leave to amend so so</text>
  <text start="1398.95" dur="3.36">you&amp;#39;re only dealing with Verizon yeah so</text>
  <text start="1400.42" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s so where are you dealing in the</text>
  <text start="1402.31" dur="7.26">statement of issues presented for review</text>
  <text start="1404.5" dur="8.61">and your so standard of review you know</text>

  <text start="1414.91" dur="4.23">to review so where do you tell us what</text>
  <text start="1416.8" dur="4.71">the standard review is so what we said</text>
  <text start="1419.14" dur="4.53">the standard of review was for with</text>
  <text start="1421.51" dur="6.96">regard to whether we can amend the</text>
  <text start="1423.67" dur="7.83">complaint to add Verizon discretion</text>
  <text start="1428.47" dur="6.839">regard to the dismissals we treat the</text>
  <text start="1431.5" dur="6.51">dismissals as 12 B 6 dismissal and as 12</text>
  <text start="1435.309" dur="4.831">B 6 dismissal z&amp;#39; our argument on the</text>

  <text start="1440.14" dur="5.7">novo review by this Court</text>
  <text start="1442.99" dur="6.21">using Twombly and Iqbal and we think</text>
  <text start="1445.84" dur="5.969">that this complaint easily satisfies the</text>
  <text start="1449.2" dur="5.49">Twombly and Iqbal standard because it</text>
  <text start="1451.809" dur="5.281">has numerous factual allegations which</text>
  <text start="1454.69" dur="4.77">have to be taken as true at this stage</text>
  <text start="1457.09" dur="4.05">they can be tested during discovery and</text>
  <text start="1459.46" dur="4.56">trial that they have to be taken as true</text>
  <text start="1461.14" dur="5.7">as true at this stage and therefore it</text>
  <text start="1464.02" dur="5.09">satisfies probably an ik fault certainly</text>
  <text start="1466.84" dur="11.13">with regard to the John Doe defendants</text>
  <text start="1469.11" dur="10.6">because on those well I just want to</text>
  <text start="1477.97" dur="3.959">make sure the court understands that</text>
  <text start="1479.71" dur="4.949">regardless of what you do with regard to</text>
  <text start="1481.929" dur="5.581">holder Donahoe and Verizon there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1484.659" dur="6.061">really essentially no argument that has</text>
  <text start="1487.51" dur="5.52">been made for why the case should not</text>
  <text start="1490.72" dur="4.62">continue against the John Doe defendants</text>
  <text start="1493.03" dur="7.11">because any of the arguments to be made</text>
  <text start="1495.34" dur="7.05">about either Bivens or the Electronic</text>
  <text start="1500.14" dur="5.49">Communications Privacy Act wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1502.39" dur="6.36">apply to the John Doe defendants and so</text>
  <text start="1505.63" dur="6.539">with regard to at least them we think</text>
  <text start="1508.75" dur="6.27">that it satisfies 12 B 6 now I can also</text>
  <text start="1512.169" dur="5.731">argue for why I think with regard to</text>
  <text start="1515.02" dur="7.35">holder and Donahoe it satisfies 12 B 6</text>
  <text start="1517.9" dur="8.61">because a an operation of this magnitude</text>
  <text start="1522.37" dur="8.039">again assuming the facts are true would</text>
  <text start="1526.51" dur="6.81">have almost certainly have to have had</text>
  <text start="1530.409" dur="7.441">the involvement of high-level people</text>
  <text start="1533.32" dur="7.109">within the relevant agencies and so we</text>
  <text start="1537.85" dur="5.88">think that it is plausible and therefore</text>
  <text start="1540.429" dur="6.271">satisfies the 12 B 6 standard to also</text>
  <text start="1543.73" dur="6.179">bring in the claims against holder and</text>
  <text start="1546.7" dur="5.4">Donahoe but if the court wanted to</text>
  <text start="1549.909" dur="5.13">remand with just the John Doe defendants</text>
  <text start="1552.1" dur="4.53">and later we found evidence that holder</text>
  <text start="1555.039" dur="4.101">or Donahoe were involved we could have</text>
  <text start="1556.63" dur="5.08">presumably add them</text>
  <text start="1559.14" dur="5.61">which gets to the Verizon point which is</text>
  <text start="1561.71" dur="5.65">you don&amp;#39;t want plaintiffs to sue people</text>
  <text start="1564.75" dur="5.16">upfront for whom they don&amp;#39;t have</text>

  <text start="1771.39" dur="4.11">um we have no control of that of course</text>
  <text start="1773.43" dur="3.99">okay my only point</text>
  <text start="1775.5" dur="4.86">judge King and just to turn back to</text>
  <text start="1777.42" dur="4.38">judge when to your question is that we</text>
  <text start="1780.36" dur="4.11">think that the district court here</text>
  <text start="1781.8" dur="6.27">reasonably exercised its case management</text>
  <text start="1784.47" dur="10.8">function in the absence of any party or</text>
  <text start="1788.07" dur="12.66">counsel but before it yes George win</text>
  <text start="1795.27" dur="9.12">that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s right now was done</text>
  <text start="1800.73" dur="5.49">so to turn up some ange you could be</text>
  <text start="1804.39" dur="7.2">represented sounds like to me some of</text>
  <text start="1806.22" dur="7.8">those that once they identified you may</text>
  <text start="1811.59" dur="4.41">be representative so just when you have</text>
  <text start="1814.02" dur="4.41">an interest in that perspective so judge</text>
  <text start="1816" dur="4.68">when I think that there&amp;#39;s a process in</text>
  <text start="1818.43" dur="4.11">place to make a representation decision</text>
  <text start="1820.68" dur="4.09">about anybody if anyone&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="1822.54" dur="4">identified youth indeed as I say they</text>
  <text start="1824.77" dur="3.78">even exist we don&amp;#39;t know the answers to</text>
  <text start="1826.54" dur="3.99">any of those questions and I think this</text>
  <text start="1828.55" dur="3.57">is relevant to plaintiffs argument that</text>
  <text start="1830.53" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s been some kind of concession and</text>
  <text start="1832.12" dur="4.56">even to plaintiffs argument that there</text>
  <text start="1834.31" dur="4.08">was a 12 B 6 motion which there was not</text>
  <text start="1836.68" dur="3.84">with respect to those defendants because</text>
  <text start="1838.39" dur="3.69">they were not before the court that that</text>
  <text start="1840.52" dur="4.14">was again the district court&amp;#39;s case</text>
  <text start="1842.08" dur="4.83">management function reasonably exercised</text>
  <text start="1844.66" dur="4.11">judgments I think you raised well but</text>
  <text start="1846.91" dur="3.54">you don&amp;#39;t have any position to tell us</text>
  <text start="1848.77" dur="3.54">about it being reasonably exercised I</text>
  <text start="1850.45" dur="5.25">mean there is a long history of this</text>
  <text start="1852.31" dur="6.11">case there you need I wasn&amp;#39;t there so I</text>
  <text start="1855.7" dur="8.37">can&amp;#39;t tell you whether it was government</text>
  <text start="1858.42" dur="9.04">recalcitrants or lack of pursuing the</text>
  <text start="1864.07" dur="5.16">case on the plaintiffs part but we have</text>
  <text start="1867.46" dur="3.18">this long period and then we have three</text>
  <text start="1869.23" dur="3.62">and a half months in front of this</text>
  <text start="1870.64" dur="5.73">district judge in the rocket docket and</text>
  <text start="1872.85" dur="4.78">we have maybe there are 16 days when</text>
  <text start="1876.37" dur="4.5">they didn&amp;#39;t do what they were supposed</text>
  <text start="1877.63" dur="5.28">to do but I&amp;#39;m not sure that that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1880.87" dur="4.83">just not you and we don&amp;#39;t have anybody</text>
  <text start="1882.91" dur="4.71">defending that right now because you</text>
  <text start="1885.7" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t have a client right just months my</text>
  <text start="1887.62" dur="4.74">client is the United States and the FBI</text>
  <text start="1889.78" dur="5.15">is in addition to the two named Bivens</text>
  <text start="1892.36" dur="5">defendants and we did the government did</text>
  <text start="1894.93" dur="5.11">go before the magistrate judge in</text>
  <text start="1897.36" dur="5.08">plaintiffs motions to compel which you</text>
  <text start="1900.04" dur="4.08">were referring to earlier yes you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1902.44" dur="4.26">right yes that&amp;#39;s right judge King so</text>
  <text start="1904.12" dur="4.71">this the government does have a stake in</text>
  <text start="1906.7" dur="4.17">this in terms of defending the discovery</text>
  <text start="1908.83" dur="4.83">this was discovery at government</text>
  <text start="1910.87" dur="4.8">agencies and and this discovery dispute</text>
  <text start="1913.66" dur="4.98">was between the plaintiff&amp;#39;s counsel and</text>
  <text start="1915.67" dur="6.39">the government defendants counsel so it</text>
  <text start="1918.64" dur="5.46">is absolutely fair to say that the</text>
  <text start="1922.06" dur="4.38">government had a stake in this litigated</text>
  <text start="1924.1" dur="4.85">this question about the adequacy of the</text>
  <text start="1926.44" dur="6.05">discovery before the magistrate judge</text>
  <text start="1928.95" dur="6.82">and and so it is it&amp;#39;s not true that</text>
  <text start="1932.49" dur="6.16">somehow I maybe misunderstood your first</text>
  <text start="1935.77" dur="4.95">your ear entry before us because I</text>
  <text start="1938.65" dur="3.87">thought you were saying to us that all</text>
  <text start="1940.72" dur="4.62">may be true in front of the magistrate</text>
  <text start="1942.52" dur="6.48">judge but as we are in this Court</text>
  <text start="1945.34" dur="7.26">you represent the two individuals yes</text>
  <text start="1949" dur="7.11">and since and maybe these agencies yes I</text>
  <text start="1952.6" dur="5.13">guess you represent them but you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1956.11" dur="2.14">represent the John Doe people because</text>
  <text start="1957.73" dur="5.29">you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1958.25" dur="6.929">that&amp;#39;s right judge he needs so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1963.02" dur="3.48">know what we do at that so have you</text>
  <text start="1965.179" dur="3.811">thought about this before the oral</text>
  <text start="1966.5" dur="5.73">argument yes my deal</text>
  <text start="1968.99" dur="5.22">and so fight sorry for judge King so so</text>
  <text start="1972.23" dur="3.449">what did you when you were thinking</text>
  <text start="1974.21" dur="5.219">about this before all argument what</text>
  <text start="1975.679" dur="6.23">happy cases or authority do you have to</text>
  <text start="1979.429" dur="4.801">tell us about this so as I was just</text>
  <text start="1981.909" dur="3.4">trying to explain Judge mundt&amp;#39;s I think</text>
  <text start="1984.23" dur="3.569">the fact that the government has a</text>

  <text start="2051.49" dur="4.109">sorry I just came for a final order yes</text>
  <text start="2053.889" dur="3.27">I think there is the district court</text>
  <text start="2055.599" dur="3.27">dismissed the complaint in its entirety</text>
  <text start="2057.159" dur="5.641">in November of 2017</text>
  <text start="2058.869" dur="5.371">leaving um without prejudice solely with</text>
  <text start="2062.8" dur="3.66">respect to leave the plaintiffs the</text>
  <text start="2064.24" dur="3.78">opportunity to identify the what the</text>
  <text start="2066.46" dur="4.199">court called John Doe defendants as you</text>
  <text start="2068.02" dur="5.01">say the complaint identifies as an</text>
  <text start="2070.659" dur="5.281">unidentified named AJ you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2073.03" dur="4.71">uphold the entirety of the order we are</text>
  <text start="2075.94" dur="2.76">explaining that we think the district</text>
  <text start="2077.74" dur="3.03">court&amp;#39;s order was reasonable your honor</text>
  <text start="2078.7" dur="4.61">yes it was certainly within the courts</text>
  <text start="2080.77" dur="5.819">exercise of discretion um</text>
  <text start="2083.31" dur="5.65">turning back judge mots to your question</text>
  <text start="2086.589" dur="4.02">which I now apologize I have food this</text>
  <text start="2088.96" dur="2.54">is all of the thinking that you&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="2090.609" dur="3.441">about this maybe</text>
  <text start="2091.5" dur="4.679">about this issue so so it is a</text>
  <text start="2094.05" dur="4.799">challenging problem because ultimately</text>
  <text start="2096.179" dur="5.311">the district court here was faced with a</text>
  <text start="2098.849" dur="5.221">difficult question what to do with these</text>
  <text start="2101.49" dur="5.25">John Doe defendants and had to make a</text>
  <text start="2104.07" dur="4.41">decision about how to manage the docket</text>
  <text start="2106.74" dur="3.72">before it we think that decision was</text>
  <text start="2108.48" dur="4.05">within the exercise of its discretion</text>
  <text start="2110.46" dur="3.48">certainly took account of the</text>
  <text start="2112.53" dur="4.23">government&amp;#39;s interest in defending the</text>
  <text start="2113.94" dur="4.32">discovery that was the dispute that went</text>
  <text start="2116.76" dur="3.66">before the magistrate judge for example</text>
  <text start="2118.26" dur="6.45">but I don&amp;#39;t even know that you have any</text>
  <text start="2120.42" dur="7.23">right to make that argument now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2124.71" dur="5.07">stand on it um and and I&amp;#39;m happy to</text>
  <text start="2127.65" dur="11.01">defer I would just point out that this</text>
  <text start="2129.78" dur="10.17">is quite a different so judge when I was</text>
  <text start="2138.66" dur="3.42">merely trying to respond to the</text>
  <text start="2139.95" dur="3.75">plaintiffs opening argument which as I</text>
  <text start="2142.08" dur="3.6">say did not focus principally on the</text>
  <text start="2143.7" dur="4.649">issues addressed in the bulk of our</text>
  <text start="2145.68" dur="4.64">brief but we think did implicate a</text>
  <text start="2148.349" dur="5.281">significant concern for the government</text>
  <text start="2150.32" dur="5.23">this is though unlike a typical case</text>
  <text start="2153.63" dur="3.84">involving John Doe defendants where</text>
  <text start="2155.55" dur="5.7">there was an incident you could say a</text>
  <text start="2157.47" dur="5.85">particular FBI agent was present at an</text>
  <text start="2161.25" dur="3.39">arrest and that individual could be</text>
  <text start="2163.32" dur="3.93">identified the plaintiffs have not</text>
  <text start="2164.64" dur="4.8">provided even that degree of detail that</text>
  <text start="2167.25" dur="4.56">would allow identification in the</text>
  <text start="2169.44" dur="4.74">ordinary course course this was done</text>
  <text start="2171.81" dur="4.49">surreptitiously I mean they they say</text>
  <text start="2174.18" dur="5.189">that you shouldn&amp;#39;t be knowing this</text>
  <text start="2176.3" dur="5.23">except that we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t know well</text>
  <text start="2179.369" dur="5.961">you know who would be the agents for</text>
  <text start="2181.53" dur="7.86">these names of to the high officials oh</text>
  <text start="2185.33" dur="6.88">you could trace it down so that actually</text>
  <text start="2189.39" dur="4.5">judge must goes to the the very reason</text>
  <text start="2192.21" dur="3.6">that the district court correctly</text>
  <text start="2193.89" dur="3.15">dismissed the Bivens claims against the</text>
  <text start="2195.81" dur="5.25">Attorney General and Postmaster General</text>
  <text start="2197.04" dur="8.04">they were not linked in any way to the</text>
  <text start="2201.06" dur="24.09">allegations of intrusion or interception</text>
  <text start="2205.08" dur="37.59">of electronic information but also in</text>
  <text start="2225.15" dur="20.64">the sense of there&amp;#39;s no defense if you</text>
  <text start="2242.67" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t allow to get into it and find out</text>
  <text start="2245.79" dur="5.1">I mean this is a I mean this could be</text>
  <text start="2247.74" dur="4.74">done by anybody but more or less from</text>
  <text start="2250.89" dur="3.81">the government&amp;#39;s perspective they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2252.48" dur="4.71">going to give you names unless you</text>
  <text start="2254.7" dur="4.44">unless you get into it to try to find</text>
  <text start="2257.19" dur="5.19">out to name who it is that&amp;#39;s doing it</text>
  <text start="2259.14" dur="5.49">what what is alleged here clearly and by</text>
  <text start="2262.38" dur="4.41">experts there&amp;#39;s no question that</text>
  <text start="2264.63" dur="4.62">computers were being compromised there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2266.79" dur="4.38">no question that there&amp;#39;s there those who</text>
  <text start="2269.25" dur="3.96">can testify evidence is sufficient in</text>
  <text start="2271.17" dur="4.71">the light most favorable is coming from</text>
  <text start="2273.21" dur="5.159">the United States government is going in</text>
  <text start="2275.88" dur="4.8">our house compromising computers phones</text>
  <text start="2278.369" dur="4.171">everything that you can name up and and</text>
  <text start="2280.68" dur="3.6">securing information I guess in an</text>
  <text start="2282.54" dur="3.48">effort whatever effort to get the</text>
  <text start="2284.28" dur="5.01">confidential formula so all this is</text>
  <text start="2286.02" dur="5.819">happening and and yet now we&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="2289.29" dur="5.7">conundrum because you&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="2291.839" dur="4.681">the mechanics of the court and it seems</text>
  <text start="2294.99" dur="3.69">that oh the government has played this</text>
  <text start="2296.52" dur="5.25">thing pretty well I mean you kept it at</text>
  <text start="2298.68" dur="6.63">bay and allowed limited discovery in</text>
  <text start="2301.77" dur="5.069">certain areas here and I understand for</text>
  <text start="2305.31" dur="4.049">great purpose cuz these securities and</text>
  <text start="2306.839" dur="4.951">other reasons but the idea is that you</text>
  <text start="2309.359" dur="4.591">have a citizen whose rights have been</text>
  <text start="2311.79" dur="3.299">compromised and the law doesn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="2313.95" dur="3.6">for a remedy</text>
  <text start="2315.089" dur="4.951">someone once said one of those justices</text>
  <text start="2317.55" dur="4.74">probably there&amp;#39;s in the Bivens case that</text>
  <text start="2320.04" dur="5.25">you know there is a should be some</text>
  <text start="2322.29" dur="5.25">remedy for every wrong it&amp;#39;s like this so</text>
  <text start="2325.29" dur="4.319">so what do you do with this case you say</text>
  <text start="2327.54" dur="7.71">you don&amp;#39;t represent this doe defendant</text>
  <text start="2329.609" dur="7.591">but still your Argan for what so judge</text>
  <text start="2335.25" dur="4.619">win I think you&amp;#39;ve identified a</text>
  <text start="2337.2" dur="4.83">challenge for some plaintiffs but these</text>
  <text start="2339.869" dur="4.021">plaintiffs identified the</text>
  <text start="2342.03" dur="3.42">very little I&amp;#39;m sorry if I may interrupt</text>
  <text start="2343.89" dur="5.04">just for a moment I don&amp;#39;t want to take</text>
  <text start="2345.45" dur="5.46">time that that is allocated to the</text>
  <text start="2348.93" dur="3.33">Verizon defendant so II want to wrap up</text>
  <text start="2350.91" dur="3.24">and make sure they have an opportunity</text>
  <text start="2352.26" dur="4.95">to address the issues raised with</text>
  <text start="2354.15" dur="4.74">respect to their clients the that the</text>
  <text start="2357.21" dur="3.99">plaintiffs here identified very little</text>
  <text start="2358.89" dur="3.69">you pointed to the complaint where they</text>
  <text start="2361.2" dur="3.21">said there was something about a</text>
  <text start="2362.58" dur="3.87">government fingerprint on software</text>
  <text start="2364.41" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s that doesn&amp;#39;t offer any</text>
  <text start="2366.45" dur="5.61">opportunity to go further and try to</text>
  <text start="2369.57" dur="3.87">identify any John Doe defendants they</text>
  <text start="2372.06" dur="3.6">said something about a government IP</text>
  <text start="2373.44" dur="4.35">address again there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not a lot</text>
  <text start="2375.66" dur="4.17">of information to go on here but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2377.79" dur="5.46">a challenge that that many plaintiffs</text>
  <text start="2379.83" dur="5.36">face your honor and it&amp;#39;s not one that</text>
  <text start="2383.25" dur="4.2">should allow the kind of over broad</text>
  <text start="2385.19" dur="4.81">discovery that the magistrate judge here</text>
  <text start="2387.45" dur="4.29">rejected and as judgments as you pointed</text>
  <text start="2390" dur="4.2">out in your questioning of opposing</text>
  <text start="2391.74" dur="4.2">counsel the plaintiffs failed to focus</text>
  <text start="2394.2" dur="3.24">after that as the magistrate judge and</text>
  <text start="2395.94" dur="4.35">the district court required them to do</text>
  <text start="2397.44" dur="4.77">as I say I do don&amp;#39;t want to intrude on</text>
  <text start="2400.29" dur="2.88">time allocated to the Verizon defendant</text>
  <text start="2402.21" dur="6.08">so if the court has no further questions</text>
  <text start="2403.17" dur="5.12">we&amp;#39;d urge you to thank you thank you</text>
  <text start="2424.42" dur="4.15">mourners may it please the court my name</text>
  <text start="2426.44" dur="3.42">is read file and I represent the Verizon</text>
  <text start="2428.57" dur="3.66">defendants who are the appellees in this</text>
  <text start="2429.86" dur="4.2">case I think it&amp;#39;s worth just taking a</text>
  <text start="2432.23" dur="3.6">few minutes to talk about what the</text>
  <text start="2434.06" dur="3.6">district court was presented with and</text>
  <text start="2435.83" dur="3.99">why the district court did appropriately</text>
  <text start="2437.66" dur="6.24">exercise it so you took up a little bit</text>
  <text start="2439.82" dur="5.64">sorry your honor first of all the real</text>
  <text start="2443.9" dur="3.69">question before the court is whether the</text>
  <text start="2445.46" dur="4.44">district court properly interpreted its</text>
  <text start="2447.59" dur="4.02">own orders what the district court found</text>
  <text start="2449.9" dur="4.65">before it dismissed the first amended</text>
  <text start="2451.61" dur="4.32">consolidated complaint was that the</text>
  <text start="2454.55" dur="3.87">plaintiffs engaged in multiple</text>
  <text start="2455.93" dur="4.62">violations of court orders they failed</text>
  <text start="2458.42" dur="3.69">to take or promptly pursue discovery of</text>
  <text start="2460.55" dur="3.21">the John Doe defendants which the court</text>
  <text start="2462.11" dur="3.77">had Mohnish them to take at the time of</text>
  <text start="2463.76" dur="4.65">the dismissal of the United States and</text>
  <text start="2465.88" dur="11.68">Attorney General Holder and Postmaster</text>
  <text start="2468.41" dur="10.38">General Donahue they failed to name no</text>
  <text start="2477.56" dur="2.63">your honor but I can defend the</text>
  <text start="2478.79" dur="4.32">dismissal of the complaint because</text>
  <text start="2480.19" dur="4.87">Verizon defendants were named in it and</text>
  <text start="2483.11" dur="3.99">so to the extent the district court was</text>
  <text start="2485.06" dur="6.24">exercising proper discretion over case</text>
  <text start="2487.1" dur="6.57">management that affects my clients yes</text>
  <text start="2491.3" dur="3.93">your honor but my point is is that the</text>
  <text start="2493.67" dur="2.97">district court at the time she dismissed</text>
  <text start="2495.23" dur="3.9">the first amended complaint as to</text>
  <text start="2496.64" dur="4.71">Verizon found multiple violations of its</text>
  <text start="2499.13" dur="5.25">prior orders the failure did identify</text>
  <text start="2501.35" dur="4.41">John Doe defendants by name the failure</text>
  <text start="2504.38" dur="3.6">to take discovery of the John Doe</text>
  <text start="2505.76" dur="4.05">defendants the addition of three new</text>
  <text start="2507.98" dur="3.42">corporate defendants plus adding back</text>
  <text start="2509.81" dur="4.26">the United States and the FBI without</text>
  <text start="2511.4" dur="3.51">permission and adding back counts four</text>
  <text start="2514.07" dur="2.09">seven and eight</text>
  <text start="2514.91" dur="3.96">that had been dismissed with prejudice</text>
  <text start="2516.16" dur="4.3">then on top of that to avoid unfairness</text>
  <text start="2518.87" dur="10.92">to make sure that there was no</text>
  <text start="2520.46" dur="11.73">unfairness to the plaintiffs less rare</text>
  <text start="2529.79" dur="4.33">cases you find exceptional surface a</text>
  <text start="2532.19" dur="5.14">list of factors there</text>
  <text start="2534.12" dur="5.01">so what are those well the factors here</text>
  <text start="2537.33" dur="4.08">your honor is they never moved that</text>
  <text start="2539.13" dur="5.28">plaintiffs never moved under Rule 15 or</text>
  <text start="2541.41" dur="5.22">rule 16 before the district court to ask</text>
  <text start="2544.41" dur="4.2">leave to add the Verizon defendants</text>
  <text start="2546.63" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s just a rule of procedure that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2548.61" dur="3.69">prerequisite to even hitting the</text>
  <text start="2551.25" dur="3.27">question whether exceptional</text>
  <text start="2552.3" dur="11.13">circumstances exist and the district</text>
  <text start="2554.52" dur="10.86">court found that the entire case was</text>
  <text start="2563.43" dur="4.46">dismissed the final instruction was</text>
  <text start="2565.38" dur="2.51">perfect court</text>
  <text start="2570.09" dur="3.39">I believe Verizon was dismissed with</text>
  <text start="2572.31" dur="3.12">prejudice your honor if I read the</text>
  <text start="2573.48" dur="3.39">courts it&amp;#39;s not in the order but if you</text>
  <text start="2575.43" dur="3.21">look at the footnote it&amp;#39;s an instruction</text>

  <text start="2584.58" dur="4.2">assume would mean with prejudice but</text>
  <text start="2586.86" dur="3.69">critically here Your Honor plaintiffs</text>
  <text start="2588.78" dur="4.59">took the position before the district</text>
  <text start="2590.55" dur="4.59">court that naming the Verizon defendants</text>
  <text start="2593.37" dur="4.05">was in compliance with the courts prior</text>
  <text start="2595.14" dur="4.98">orders the court interpreted her orders</text>
  <text start="2597.42" dur="4.5">and said that that was wrong and as part</text>
  <text start="2600.12" dur="4.14">of that presentation because we moved to</text>
  <text start="2601.92" dur="3.69">dismiss under Rule 15 the plaintiffs</text>
  <text start="2604.26" dur="3.77">took the position that it was</text>
  <text start="2605.61" dur="4.77">unnecessary to comply with rule 15 and</text>
  <text start="2608.03" dur="4.42">specifically they said that the court</text>
  <text start="2610.38" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t need to address the circumstances</text>
  <text start="2612.45" dur="2.99">your honor identified under Rule 15 in</text>
  <text start="2614.28" dur="3.36">the foam in case in the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="2615.44" dur="4.54">because adding the Verizon defendants</text>
  <text start="2617.64" dur="3.99">was consistent with the courts existing</text>
  <text start="2619.98" dur="3.9">orders the court was well within its</text>
  <text start="2621.63" dur="4.89">jurisdiction to find that that with it</text>
  <text start="2623.88" dur="4.64">I&amp;#39;m sorry was properly exercised its</text>
  <text start="2626.52" dur="4.92">discretion to find that that wasn&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="2628.52" dur="4.08">so for the plaintiffs now to claim that</text>
  <text start="2631.44" dur="4.02">there was an abuse of that discretion</text>
  <text start="2632.6" dur="4.36">for failing to grant leave under Rule 15</text>

  <text start="2662.39" dur="5.1">is no and then you give us the reason</text>
  <text start="2665.33" dur="4.68">why I didn&amp;#39;t need to perhaps she did not</text>
  <text start="2667.49" dur="4.77">consider there was a little argument</text>
  <text start="2670.01" dur="4.11">there was an opinion that dismissed the</text>

  <text start="2674.12" dur="4.71">went through very carefully in canvassed</text>
  <text start="2676.67" dur="3.78">her prior orders looked at the merits of</text>
  <text start="2678.83" dur="3.78">the claims under Twombly Nick fellows to</text>
  <text start="2680.45" dur="3.87">the Verizon defendants found that there</text>
  <text start="2682.61" dur="3.9">had been ample opportunity for discovery</text>

  <text start="2686.51" dur="4.26">its inherent authority to manage its</text>
  <text start="2688.49" dur="3.63">docket and for case management dismissed</text>
  <text start="2690.77" dur="3.57">the complaint because enough was enough</text>
  <text start="2692.12" dur="4.11">and on top of that when you look at</text>
  <text start="2694.34" dur="4.31">exactly what was in that first amended</text>
  <text start="2696.23" dur="5.37">complaint the district court had had a</text>

  <text start="2714.74" dur="3.54">be a regression of the litigation she</text>
  <text start="2717.17" dur="3.45">was trying to move the litigation</text>
  <text start="2718.28" dur="3.6">forward the next thing the plaintiffs</text>
  <text start="2720.62" dur="4.23">did was filed a separate complaint</text>

  <text start="2736.31" dur="3.36">Verizon defendants was consistent with</text>
  <text start="2738.08" dur="3.93">her prior orders what she found was</text>
  <text start="2739.67" dur="4.14">wholesale violations of past orders of</text>
  <text start="2742.01" dur="9.23">which adding the Verizon defendants</text>
  <text start="2743.81" dur="11.4">without lead well I think the court had</text>
  <text start="2751.24" dur="5.53">careful thoughtful adjudication of all</text>
  <text start="2755.21" dur="3.27">the various claims including for Verizon</text>
  <text start="2756.77" dur="3.93">one other point just because I think</text>
  <text start="2758.48" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s important the plaintiffs did have</text>
  <text start="2760.7" dur="3.93">opportunity to take discovery On January</text>
  <text start="2762.29" dur="4.62">12th a magistrate judge ordered Verizon</text>
  <text start="2764.63" dur="4.77">to make the technician who went to miss</text>
  <text start="2766.91" dur="4.53">Atkinson&amp;#39;s home and did the service call</text>
  <text start="2769.4" dur="4.11">and a rule 30 B 6 to talk about the</text>
  <text start="2771.44" dur="3.39">various IP addresses and Verizon was</text>
  <text start="2773.51" dur="2.94">prepared to have that discovery go</text>
  <text start="2774.83" dur="3.66">forward and plaintiffs never noticed it</text>
  <text start="2776.45" dur="5.1">in addition Verizon had provided</text>
  <text start="2778.49" dur="4.32">discovery on a voluntary basis prior to</text>
  <text start="2781.55" dur="3.54">that so they had information from</text>
  <text start="2782.81" dur="3.9">horizon about the IP addresses and what</text>
  <text start="2785.09" dur="3.72">the court found was there had been</text>
  <text start="2786.71" dur="3.72">months of potential discovery and the</text>
  <text start="2788.81" dur="2.91">plaintiffs didn&amp;#39;t take advantage of the</text>
  <text start="2790.43" dur="3.48">discovery opportunities</text>
  <text start="2791.72" dur="4.139">had and that was part of what informed</text>
  <text start="2793.91" dur="8.88">her overall decision to dismiss the</text>
  <text start="2795.859" dur="8.76">complaint unless the court has further</text>
  <text start="2802.79" dur="2.78">questions all thank you very much thank</text>
  <text start="2804.619" dur="4.861">you</text>
  <text start="2805.57" dur="7.24">mr. Berman you have some rebuttal you</text>
  <text start="2809.48" dur="6.45">had three minutes thank you your honor</text>
  <text start="2812.81" dur="7.47">the conduct of the oral arguments so far</text>
  <text start="2815.93" dur="7.41">I think demonstrates the incredible</text>
  <text start="2820.28" dur="6.089">difficulty with which the actus ins</text>
  <text start="2823.34" dur="5.1">have had in pursuing this suit the</text>
  <text start="2826.369" dur="4.951">government claims it doesn&amp;#39;t represent</text>
  <text start="2828.44" dur="4.77">the John Doe defendants it can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2831.32" dur="3.69">accept service of process for the John</text>
  <text start="2833.21" dur="3.63">Doe defendants I note that would have</text>
  <text start="2835.01" dur="4.32">been true of Bivens itself so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2836.84" dur="5.66">little bit odd but it shows how</text>
  <text start="2839.33" dur="6.66">difficult it has been at every single</text>
  <text start="2842.5" dur="7.18">procedural step in this case for the</text>
  <text start="2845.99" dur="5.43">actus ins to pursue this case even to</text>
  <text start="2849.68" dur="4.32">the point of the government filing an</text>
  <text start="2851.42" dur="4.08">answer which they haven&amp;#39;t done because</text>
  <text start="2854" dur="5.94">they say they don&amp;#39;t represent the John</text>
  <text start="2855.5" dur="6.78">Doe defendants and so for a claim of</text>
  <text start="2859.94" dur="5.159">this magnitude with this amount of</text>
  <text start="2862.28" dur="6.86">specificity for the government to at</text>
  <text start="2865.099" dur="6.661">every stage avoid even responding</text>
  <text start="2869.14" dur="4.449">strikes me as not something that this</text>
  <text start="2871.76" dur="5.099">Court should countenance this Court</text>
  <text start="2873.589" dur="4.741">should at the very least send the case</text>
  <text start="2876.859" dur="4.891">back so that there can be a full</text>
  <text start="2878.33" dur="6.509">discovery process to see to test whether</text>
  <text start="2881.75" dur="5.88">the plaintiffs claims really have</text>
  <text start="2884.839" dur="5.941">evidentiary validity we have no idea at</text>
  <text start="2887.63" dur="5.459">this stage and if these claims with</text>
  <text start="2890.78" dur="5.88">forensic analysis and detailed</text>
  <text start="2893.089" dur="6.241">allegations isn&amp;#39;t good enough to go</text>
  <text start="2896.66" dur="4.86">forward I can&amp;#39;t imagine any surveillance</text>
  <text start="2899.33" dur="3.75">claim that could ever be made against</text>
  <text start="2901.52" dur="3.95">the government which means we have</text>
  <text start="2903.08" dur="5.91">essentially created an absolute immunity</text>
  <text start="2905.47" dur="9.129">just because the government is able to</text>
  <text start="2908.99" dur="7.8">avoid defending the case now I also want</text>
  <text start="2914.599" dur="5.071">to say with regard to the question of</text>
  <text start="2916.79" dur="5.88">whether the district court could dismiss</text>
  <text start="2919.67" dur="5.24">fully just because of failure to comply</text>
  <text start="2922.67" dur="4.34">with discovery orders</text>
  <text start="2924.91" dur="5.52">assuming that that were even true I</text>
  <text start="2927.01" dur="5.01">would be happy to it&amp;#39;s true I mean there</text>
  <text start="2930.43" dur="5.91">is case law that you can dismiss the</text>
  <text start="2932.02" dur="5.94">complaint for lack of suing is true what</text>
  <text start="2936.34" dur="4.26">I meant is assuming it&amp;#39;s true in this</text>
  <text start="2937.96" dur="5.07">case that the plaintiffs that really did</text>
  <text start="2940.6" dur="5.73">fail to comply with the discovery orders</text>
  <text start="2943.03" dur="6.06">I would be happy to present supplemental</text>
  <text start="2946.33" dur="5.16">briefing on the question of whether the</text>
  <text start="2949.09" dur="5.25">dismissal if it were for failure to</text>
  <text start="2951.49" dur="5.37">comply is appropriate in this case we</text>
  <text start="2954.34" dur="4.5">would argue that that&amp;#39;s not really how</text>
  <text start="2956.86" dur="5.76">the district court seemed to dismiss the</text>
  <text start="2958.84" dur="5.79">case though I admit it&amp;#39;s ambiguous as to</text>
  <text start="2962.62" dur="5.34">how they did it with regard to Verizon</text>
  <text start="2964.63" dur="5.04">Verizon was added because finally after</text>
  <text start="2967.96" dur="3.33">one deposition</text>
  <text start="2969.67" dur="4.77">there actually was additional</text>
  <text start="2971.29" dur="5.88">information that was found and the</text>
  <text start="2974.44" dur="6.87">forensic experts looking at the Byram</text>
  <text start="2977.17" dur="6.33">deposition determined that there was</text>
  <text start="2981.31" dur="4.53">more information that they had that they</text>
  <text start="2983.5" dur="4.95">didn&amp;#39;t have earlier and that it directly</text>
  <text start="2985.84" dur="5.01">implicated Verizon so it seems to me</text>
  <text start="2988.45" dur="4.56">again it&amp;#39;s appropriate to add Verizon at</text>
  <text start="2990.85" dur="5.34">that stage because that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="2993.01" dur="8.4">evidence suggested that challenging</text>
  <text start="2996.19" dur="7.32">Verizon was appropriate and that there</text>
  <text start="3001.41" dur="8.88">was a sufficient factual predicate for</text>
  <text start="3003.51" dur="11.3">doing so thank you and there you go</text>
  <text start="3010.29" dur="9.24">interesting stuff I swear I I just</text>
  <text start="3014.81" dur="6.97">something about this process and you</text>
  <text start="3019.53" dur="5.39">know skilled attorneys and how they</text>
  <text start="3021.78" dur="7.89">craft their arguments and and you know I</text>
  <text start="3024.92" dur="8.68">just I&amp;#39;m so interested in it and if I</text>
  <text start="3029.67" dur="6.54">had tons of time I would probably go to</text>
  <text start="3033.6" dur="4.5">law school I always wanted to be a</text>
  <text start="3036.21" dur="3.48">lawyer since I was little I would</text>
  <text start="3038.1" dur="3.99">probably go to law school really</text>
  <text start="3039.69" dur="4.5">interesting do you understand how this</text>
  <text start="3042.09" dur="6">works now see the Verizon attorney was</text>
  <text start="3044.19" dur="6.36">very testy very very testy basically the</text>
  <text start="3048.09" dur="5.21">court is supposed to assume that</text>
  <text start="3050.55" dur="8.67">everything alleged in a complaint is</text>
  <text start="3053.3" dur="7.36">true so there&amp;#39;s no question of you know</text>
  <text start="3059.22" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re supposed to just assume it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3060.66" dur="3.18">true even if it&amp;#39;s not they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="3061.83" dur="4.82">supposed to assume it&amp;#39;s true and rule</text>
  <text start="3063.84" dur="5.97">and make decisions based around that and</text>
  <text start="3066.65" dur="5.98">a lot of times like we saw for example</text>
  <text start="3069.81" dur="5.51">in the Montgomery clayman case that I</text>
  <text start="3072.63" dur="5.22">talked about a few weeks ago the</text>
  <text start="3075.32" dur="4.6">argument was they surveilled us and</text>
  <text start="3077.85" dur="3.87">here&amp;#39;s why we think so but we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="3079.92" dur="4.14">any specificity here there was no</text>
  <text start="3081.72" dur="5.43">specificity was very broad with little</text>
  <text start="3084.06" dur="6.39">evidence in this case which is what our</text>
  <text start="3087.15" dur="5.52">attorneys arguing the specificity of the</text>
  <text start="3090.45" dur="5.22">complaint the forensic detail provided</text>
  <text start="3092.67" dur="6.48">the fact that it&amp;#39;s undisputed that it</text>
  <text start="3095.67" dur="7.38">happened if that&amp;#39;s not good enough for a</text>
  <text start="3099.15" dur="8.34">citizen to bring a case for illegal</text>
  <text start="3103.05" dur="8.31">surveillance against a constitutional</text>
  <text start="3107.49" dur="6.3">protected freedom then there will never</text>
  <text start="3111.36" dur="5.43">be a case that we&amp;#39;ll be able to move</text>
  <text start="3113.79" dur="4.77">forward the government can just say well</text>
  <text start="3116.79" dur="4.44">we don&amp;#39;t represent the John Doe so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3118.56" dur="5.1">not cooperating when you need the john</text>
  <text start="3121.23" dur="4.47">doe&amp;#39;s information from the government so</text>
  <text start="3123.66" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s really a very interesting case that</text>
  <text start="3125.7" dur="3.6">Cheryl has going on here and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="3127.38" dur="3.6">bring it to you guys I hope that that</text>
