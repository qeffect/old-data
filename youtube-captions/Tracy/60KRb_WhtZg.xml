  <text start="12.71" dur="3.61">don&amp;#39;t know if any of you guys have heard</text>
  <text start="14.7" dur="3.329">but I&amp;#39;ve been kind of talking about the</text>
  <text start="16.32" dur="3.57">story a lot and it&amp;#39;s really it gets me</text>
  <text start="18.029" dur="5.67">really passionate for some reason I just</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="6.27">having a really hard time with how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="23.699" dur="6.961">played out it&amp;#39;s Eddie Gallagher is a</text>
  <text start="26.16" dur="7.23">Navy SEAL he is a very decorated Navy</text>
  <text start="30.66" dur="4.829">SEAL who was on his eighth combat tour</text>
  <text start="33.39" dur="7.95">in Iraq</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="8.761">he actually had been given several</text>
  <text start="41.34" dur="5.149">awards and for his service here in the</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="4.739">Bronze Star with V for valor twice a</text>
  <text start="46.489" dur="4.66">Meritorious Unit Commendation and a trio</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="4.951">of Navy and Marine Corps achievement</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="7.971">medals amongst other awards this was</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="8.82">like your war hero a Torres wife family</text>
  <text start="59.12" dur="7.2">was in Iraq was going to retire after he</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="7.17">got home and is accused of war crimes</text>
  <text start="66.32" dur="7.99">when he got home he was arrested for</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="10.74">murdering a an Iraqi terrorist</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="7.77">amongst other things and since the</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="3.96">beginning he&amp;#39;s maintained his innocence</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="3.75">and there&amp;#39;s video evidence now that</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="4.379">proves that he&amp;#39;s been telling the truth</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="5.039">the entire time what it appears happened</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="4.051">is for some reason and I still can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="4.831">figure out why the Navy went after this</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="5.22">guy and this story is absolutely insane</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="5.129">and I credit his brother and his wife</text>
  <text start="98.28" dur="4.589">for the consistency in which they&amp;#39;ve put</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="3.9">themselves out there for getting this</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="3.721">the attention that it deserved in order</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="4.051">to keep him as high-profile as it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="4.05">in order to keep this abuse that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="7.439">gone through and I&amp;#39;ll explain it over</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="9.18">the past couple years at bay and the</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="6.121">media hasn&amp;#39;t helped so he&amp;#39;s a commander</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="4.619">he&amp;#39;s got people underneath them</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="4.349">and he&amp;#39;s hard on him this this guy is</text>
  <text start="124.439" dur="6.781">hard on his squad right</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="5.91">I think it&amp;#39;s SEAL Team six and they get</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="3.12">a little bit resentful they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="5.761">it they don&amp;#39;t want him to succeed they</text>
  <text start="134.34" dur="6.679">don&amp;#39;t want him to move up in ranks they</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="5.31">don&amp;#39;t like the way he treats them in</text>
  <text start="141.019" dur="5.44">combat or how much they make him he</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="7.02">makes him them work what happens is they</text>
  <text start="146.459" dur="5.851">bomb the terrorist facility every single</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="5.82">person inside the terrorist facility</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="7.44">dies except one guy looks to be between</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.67">the ages of 15 and 17 years old the</text>
  <text start="159.75" dur="4.38">Iraqi forces get him first they</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="5.25">interrogate him for two hours he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="6.93">badly wounded then the United States the</text>
  <text start="167.43" dur="5.94">Navy SEALs get him and the story is that</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="5.31">the prosecution would like you to</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="9">believe is that seals were rendering</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="8.61">medical aid to this wounded terrorists</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="6.089">and that Eddie Gallagher walked up to</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="5.37">them and stabbed this terrorist killing</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="3.09">him in front of all the people that were</text>
  <text start="190.35" dur="6.199">standing around there trying to give him</text>
  <text start="191.549" dur="7.5">aid what the video actually shows is</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="4.601">that he was attempting to perform</text>
  <text start="199.049" dur="6.72">medical procedures on this man to save</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="7.26">his life there seems to have been a</text>
  <text start="205.769" dur="5.22">witch hunt after this guy and it appears</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="4.53">from what I&amp;#39;m reading that a number of</text>
  <text start="210.989" dur="4.59">the people in his squad that spoke out</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="5.49">against him there are inconsistencies in</text>
  <text start="215.579" dur="5.701">their stories there are missing bits of</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="5.97">footage there are fudged text messages</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="5.1">there are all kinds of inconsistent</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="3.959">claims things that debunk one another a</text>
  <text start="226.38" dur="4.229">lot of them don&amp;#39;t want to speak anymore</text>
  <text start="228.359" dur="4.081">there&amp;#39;s rumblings that the people that</text>
  <text start="230.609" dur="6.391">spoke out and whistle blew against him</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="6.81">in quotes originally have now been they</text>
  <text start="237" dur="4.56">basically are they want to recant their</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="4.38">story and they want to tell the truth</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="6.59">but they can&amp;#39;t because the prosecution</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="4.52">will hold them in contempt for perjury</text>
  <text start="248.389" dur="3.641">I&amp;#39;m gonna play a couple videos for you</text>
  <text start="250.86" dur="3.719">right now</text>
  <text start="252.03" dur="3.429">or in a minute but he comes back home</text>
  <text start="254.579" dur="3.571">there</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="6.93">them for these war crimes he goes to a</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="7.269">prison or a military facility where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.389" dur="3.931">being held away from his family as all</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="3">of this unrolls</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="3.45">and proclaiming his innocence the entire</text>
  <text start="268.419" dur="4.291">time</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="5.489">the real shenanigans come in where we</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="8.19">start getting closer to when the trial</text>
  <text start="275.259" dur="8.69">is going to happen there are so so many</text>
  <text start="280.9" dur="9.54">details here but basically in a nutshell</text>
  <text start="283.949" dur="9.391">they they have video of the event their</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="6.09">video of it and it was eventually</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="5.44">grabbed and shown to Congress and the</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="4.47">video exonerates Eddie Gallagher for the</text>
  <text start="298.78" dur="3.96">entire charge of murder that he&amp;#39;s up for</text>
  <text start="301" dur="3.509">there&amp;#39;s other crimes on there but</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re very very weak charges they</text>
  <text start="304.509" dur="3.511">can&amp;#39;t support them with evidence it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="4.26">like the prosecutors on this case we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="5.01">just good after him just after him for</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="8.909">some reason the tape exonerates him he</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="9.99">wasn&amp;#39;t the New York Times does a story</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="7.201">where they basically say that this man</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="6.48">is a war criminal I think I have it Holt</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="4.35">pulled up here hold on the New York</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="3.84">Times wrote a story from the prosecutors</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="5.61">angle saying all these horrible things</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="7.319">about Gallagher towards the end of the</text>
  <text start="336.76" dur="5.58">article saying that his um his fellow</text>
  <text start="340.659" dur="3.151">soldiers would like mess with his sniper</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="2.579">to make it less accurate because they</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="4.74">didn&amp;#39;t want him killing random people</text>
  <text start="344.919" dur="5.49">all kinds of stuff they say that he</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="4.109">intimidated witnesses to not speak out</text>
  <text start="350.409" dur="3.961">about what he did again a lie because</text>
  <text start="352.659" dur="3.181">there&amp;#39;s video evidence that disproves</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="3.96">the entire story that he was murdering</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="4.859">anybody the last thing they close out</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="4.619">this article with was his prosecutor the</text>
  <text start="360.699" dur="5.181">Navy prosecutor going after him I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="362.949" dur="6.06">say his last name Sapp Lac I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="6.46">saying that the chief had done damage</text>
  <text start="369.009" dur="5.011">beyond murder and his quote does the</text>
  <text start="372.34" dur="3.48">public still believe we are the good</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="3.42">guys because chief Gallagher decided to</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="3.9">act like the monster the terrorist</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="4.8">accused of being he handed Isis</text>
  <text start="379.72" dur="4.71">propaganda manna from heaven his actions</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="4.429">are everything Isis says we are this is</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="4.889">the prosecutor</text>
  <text start="386.669" dur="5.851">again video evidence disputes the fact</text>
  <text start="389.319" dur="5.581">that he killed anybody okay</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="3.7">eventually this video somehow gets to</text>
  <text start="394.9" dur="2.94">Congress and they look at it and they</text>
  <text start="396.22" dur="3.569">come out and say listen this video</text>
  <text start="397.84" dur="3.78">exonerate Eddie Gallagher</text>
  <text start="399.789" dur="4.261">president Trump starts to take notice</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="6.12">and he moves him to a medical facility</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="6.089">instead of where he was staying the</text>
  <text start="407.74" dur="4.14">prosecution is ridiculously angry that</text>
  <text start="410.139" dur="4.411">this information about the video is</text>
  <text start="411.88" dur="5.819">leaking out outside of the confines of</text>
  <text start="414.55" dur="5.22">the trial so they decide that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.699" dur="4.56">gonna try the prosecution is gonna try</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="6.869">to figure out who&amp;#39;s leaking so what do</text>
  <text start="422.259" dur="7.261">they do they put tracking mechanisms</text>
  <text start="426.639" dur="6.391">inside of the emails they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="6.69">spying on the defense and a reporter for</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="6.569">the Navy Times and 11 other people the</text>
  <text start="436.21" dur="5.82">prosecution is spying on the defense I</text>
  <text start="439.599" dur="4.591">want to say that again the prosecution</text>
  <text start="442.03" dur="6.87">in this case is spying on the defense</text>
  <text start="444.19" dur="8.069">literally spying then there was a</text>
  <text start="448.9" dur="7.199">lie-detector test which Eddie Gallagher</text>
  <text start="452.259" dur="5.94">passed and I can&amp;#39;t even believe I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="456.099" dur="6.901">saying this this is a decorated war hero</text>
  <text start="458.199" dur="6.541">and the prosecution didn&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="463" dur="3.539">results because they refuted the fact</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="3.03">that he killed anyone he was being</text>
  <text start="466.539" dur="5.37">truthful when he said he didn&amp;#39;t murder</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="6.869">anybody or murder any terrorists anyway</text>
  <text start="471.909" dur="5.13">and they kept they withheld those</text>
  <text start="474.639" dur="7.351">results from both the defense and the</text>
  <text start="477.039" dur="7.111">judge finally last week the judge tossed</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="3.87">off the the prosecutor that made this</text>
  <text start="484.15" dur="6.72">quote in the New York Times off the case</text>
  <text start="485.86" dur="7.109">and freed Eddie Gallagher to go home to</text>
  <text start="490.87" dur="9.21">be with his family while he awaits trial</text>
  <text start="492.969" dur="9.54">as sort of a reprobate for having to go</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="5.66">through this horrible escapade they have</text>
  <text start="502.509" dur="5.46">not appointed a new prosecutor yet but</text>
  <text start="505.74" dur="3.94">the fact that they dismissed the</text>
  <text start="507.969" dur="3.331">attorneys that were prosecuting the case</text>
  <text start="509.68" dur="3.659">should tell you everything you need to</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="5.82">know we&amp;#39;re gonna listen quickly to two</text>
  <text start="513.339" dur="5.371">videos might be three the first is going</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="3.93">to be his brother explaining</text>
  <text start="518.71" dur="4.11">story it&amp;#39;s about six minutes long but I</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="5.22">want to play it this is from Newsmax</text>
  <text start="522.82" dur="4.62">fair use under copyright I&amp;#39;m gonna put</text>
  <text start="526.27" dur="3.21">the link to it in the description box</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="5.94">below you can always go over there and</text>
  <text start="529.48" dur="6.48">go ahead and play the interview yourself</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="9.03">but here is his brother and talking</text>
  <text start="535.96" dur="8.34">about the story it ain&amp;#39;t never knew the</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="4.14">answer to why in the world with the Navy</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="4.23">and navy lawyers and prosecutors ever</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="3.69">take a case like this and I want to</text>
  <text start="548.53" dur="2.61">state from the outset you know one of</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="2.19">the things that our family has learned</text>
  <text start="551.14" dur="3.12">in this process and my brother</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="4.11">unfortunately is on the crap end of is</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="4.11">that prosecutors in this case Navy</text>
  <text start="556.54" dur="3.48">lawyers who&amp;#39;ve never seen combat who</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="3.12">never shot downrange never seen the</text>
  <text start="560.02" dur="3.36">likes of battle that my brothers had</text>
  <text start="561.49" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s been on eight tours eight combat</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="3.51">tours to Iraq and Afghanistan they sit</text>
  <text start="565.99" dur="1.98">there and they Monday Morning</text>
  <text start="566.89" dur="3.39">Quarterback something that actually</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="3.48">never even happened and so what I want</text>
  <text start="570.28" dur="3.36">to state from the outset on this whole</text>
  <text start="571.45" dur="5.04">thing is the premise is that my brother</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="4.47">a chief of platoon in front of around</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="3.87">thirty people stabbed to death an</text>
  <text start="578.11" dur="5.84">already dying Isis fighter this incident</text>
  <text start="580.36" dur="6.09">never happened there&amp;#39;s mounds of video</text>
  <text start="583.95" dur="4.75">eyewitness testimony in picture evidence</text>
  <text start="586.45" dur="3.96">that clear Eddie that we you know our</text>
  <text start="588.7" dur="3.51">lawyers have transcribed to us and so</text>
  <text start="590.41" dur="3.66">from the beginning of this we have said</text>
  <text start="592.21" dur="3.27">the premise of this is absurd why is</text>
  <text start="594.07" dur="3.36">this even happening in the first place</text>
  <text start="595.48" dur="3.6">and why in the world would the Navy</text>
  <text start="597.43" dur="3.3">actually take this line so yeah answer</text>
  <text start="599.08" dur="3.21">your question is why in the world is</text>
  <text start="600.73" dur="3.21">this happening but unfortunately my</text>
  <text start="602.29" dur="3">brother and this should make a lot of</text>
  <text start="603.94" dur="3.66">your viewers and Americans around the</text>
  <text start="605.29" dur="3.81">world just incensed is that Eddie has</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="4.77">been for four and a half months now</text>
  <text start="609.1" dur="4.38">behind bars awaiting trial so what&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="612.37" dur="2.49">they do to you in the military is that</text>
  <text start="613.48" dur="2.82">they accuse you of something and they</text>

  <text start="624.31" dur="3.87">whole bunch of false accusations and</text>
  <text start="626.29" dur="3.54">finally get to the bottom of this yeah</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="3.06">you know what bothered me is that one of</text>

  <text start="679.86" dur="4.98">problem in search of a question right</text>
  <text start="682.08" dur="4.95">where prosecutors want to do these types</text>
  <text start="684.84" dur="3.6">of things one of the the unfortunate</text>
  <text start="687.03" dur="3.12">tragedies that we&amp;#39;re experiencing as a</text>
  <text start="688.44" dur="3.57">family and Eddie is experiencing as this</text>
  <text start="690.15" dur="3.9">decorated war hero is that there are</text>

  <text start="695.94" dur="4.85">their achievements come in taking the</text>
  <text start="697.89" dur="5.46">scalp yeah so what what happens is that</text>
  <text start="700.79" dur="4.12">prosecutors make careers out of</text>
  <text start="703.35" dur="2.61">convictions and so they look at</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="3.03">something like this and they get a whiff</text>
  <text start="705.96" dur="3.93">of who may be a Navy SEAL did something</text>
  <text start="707.94" dur="4.02">wrong in combat I&amp;#39;m gonna prosecute him</text>
  <text start="709.89" dur="3.39">for it and so you know the listener</text>
  <text start="711.96" dur="3.96">should listen to exactly what you just</text>

  <text start="766.29" dur="4.35">into my brother&amp;#39;s compound on a Humvee</text>

  <text start="772.38" dur="2.49">fighter not out of the goodness of their</text>
  <text start="773.85" dur="2.16">hearts they don&amp;#39;t want to save them</text>
  <text start="774.87" dur="2.94">because they like them they want to save</text>
  <text start="776.01" dur="3.87">them so that they can interrogate him to</text>
  <text start="777.81" dur="4.89">find valuable intelligence sure the Isis</text>
  <text start="779.88" dur="4.83">fighter dies this is the scenario and</text>
  <text start="782.7" dur="2.999">then suddenly Eddie a year after he gets</text>
  <text start="784.71" dur="2.969">back is</text>
  <text start="785.699" dur="3.3">said well you killed the guy which you</text>
  <text start="787.679" dur="2.49">shouldn&amp;#39;t have done which is insane at</text>
  <text start="788.999" dur="2.971">the outset when you&amp;#39;re talking about a</text>
  <text start="790.169" dur="3.45">Navy SEAL who just literally was engaged</text>
  <text start="791.97" dur="3.269">in a firefight with the enemy one of</text>

  <text start="809.339" dur="4.02">you know you can imagine the outrage</text>
  <text start="811.679" dur="5.07">that our family feels you can imagine</text>

  <text start="850.169" dur="3.66">so much evidence on our side that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="851.939" dur="3.45">insane that it would actually start in</text>

  <text start="855.389" dur="4.11">is just what you said they try to paint</text>
