  <text start="223.54" dur="4.11">but then we kind of move into what we</text>
  <text start="225.55" dur="4.59">find is a concerning thing that we see</text>

  <text start="350.589" dur="5.94">laid out exactly how this started and</text>
  <text start="353.229" dur="6.451">how the Clinton campaign paid for a</text>
  <text start="356.529" dur="4.621">dirty dossier which was then penetrated</text>
  <text start="359.68" dur="3.989">throughout our government throughout the</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="3.93">media to keep this narrative alive and</text>
  <text start="363.669" dur="5.851">put a cloud under a duly elected</text>

  <text start="371.589" dur="3.991">really just what we already know but</text>
  <text start="373.509" dur="5.55">laid out very simply with a heavy focus</text>
  <text start="375.58" dur="5.729">on Nellie or Bruce or steel and the</text>
  <text start="379.059" dur="3.991">dossier basically informed this entire</text>
  <text start="381.309" dur="4.83">thing he is paying very close attention</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="6.81">to the dossiers still but we&amp;#39;ll learn</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="5.34">some more in a second yeah and I would</text>
  <text start="389.86" dur="4.739">also say this is kind of a strange</text>
  <text start="391.479" dur="6.391">situation where you have McCarthyism</text>
  <text start="394.599" dur="6.271">like new McCarthyism that merged with</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="5.19">Watergate one of these thing you had</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="4.289">unbelievable leaks that occurred across</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="4.139">all levels of our government you had all</text>
  <text start="405.159" dur="4.44">sorts of reporters 90% of the press</text>
  <text start="407.199" dur="5.34">essentially was was in on this it</text>
  <text start="409.599" dur="4.461">started by by dirtying up a presidential</text>
  <text start="412.539" dur="4.59">candidate and then it went on to</text>
  <text start="414.06" dur="5.499">dirtying up a president and you had a</text>
  <text start="417.129" dur="3.81">bunch I think people within FBI DOJ we</text>
  <text start="419.559" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t know exactly where but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.939" dur="3.66">like though want to be the next deep</text>
  <text start="422.649" dur="6.81">throat the person who&amp;#39;s leaking</text>
  <text start="424.599" dur="6.9">classified information for now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="429.459" dur="4.8">know exactly where he said we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="431.499" dur="5.551">exactly where DOJ inside the</text>
  <text start="434.259" dur="4.83">intelligence go this is my thought</text>
  <text start="437.05" dur="3.69">honestly I I don&amp;#39;t know that he knows</text>
  <text start="439.089" dur="2.82">exactly where they are but I know that</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="3.06">he knows that there are these leak</text>
  <text start="441.909" dur="3.211">investigations ongoing and I know that</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="3.299">he knows that they&amp;#39;re finding things</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="3.719">because we know that McCabe and Baker</text>
  <text start="447.099" dur="3.6">are both sitting in front of grand</text>
  <text start="448.839" dur="3">juries for goodness knows how long now</text>
  <text start="450.699" dur="4.351">what else they found while they were</text>
  <text start="451.839" dur="5.521">doing that so we know that Devon Nunez</text>
  <text start="455.05" dur="4.5">knows pretty much who these people are</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="2.549">in my opinion I think he knows who they</text>
  <text start="459.55" dur="1.859">are</text>
  <text start="459.909" dur="2.451">you know he&amp;#39;ll go into a little bit more</text>
  <text start="461.409" dur="4.01">in a minute about</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="5.369">why he can&amp;#39;t really pinpoint who they</text>
  <text start="465.419" dur="4.05">are but but he&amp;#39;ll give us some ideas the</text>
  <text start="467.729" dur="3.541">betterment of all society but in this</text>
  <text start="469.469" dur="4.41">case it just got completely out of hand</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="4.32">and we&amp;#39;ve had unbelievable disclosures</text>
  <text start="473.879" dur="3.991">of classified information and this is</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="4.65">why we&amp;#39;ve been working so hard for</text>
  <text start="477.87" dur="4.049">two-and-a-half years waiting for a real</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="3.209">Attorney General which we have now and</text>

  <text start="574.44" dur="4.86">about this list of referrals and about</text>
  <text start="576.81" dur="3.93">the referral of criminal conduct that</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="5.07">you are about to release sir</text>
  <text start="580.74" dur="6.539">I love how Bartiromo just gets to the</text>
  <text start="584.37" dur="5.76">point she just gets to the point like</text>
  <text start="587.279" dur="4.141">I&amp;#39;m not doing right now so we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="590.13" dur="3.93">working on this for two-and-a-half years</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="5.4">compiling information right</text>
  <text start="594.06" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;ve continued this investigation we</text>
  <text start="596.82" dur="3.57">couldn&amp;#39;t really send these criminal</text>
  <text start="598.5" dur="8.28">referrals over without an attorney</text>
  <text start="600.39" dur="9.24">general in place we&amp;#39;ve been talking on</text>
  <text start="606.78" dur="5.25">this channel for the past goodness knows</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="4.98">how long and more so the past couple</text>
  <text start="612.03" dur="5.79">weeks about how these investigations</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="4.32">have been ongoing for two years we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="617.82" dur="3.45">been talking about that</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;s just clarifying that for us again</text>
  <text start="621.27" dur="3.42">and he&amp;#39;s also saying if we would have</text>
  <text start="623.28" dur="3.81">sent these criminal referrals over</text>
  <text start="624.69" dur="4.65">before nothing would have ever happened</text>
  <text start="627.09" dur="6.02">with them now it&amp;#39;s safe to go ahead and</text>
  <text start="629.34" dur="7.11">do so because we have Barr in office</text>
  <text start="633.11" dur="5.35">color me shocked in a way because I was</text>
  <text start="636.45" dur="3.51">definitely on the fence about him but it</text>
  <text start="638.46" dur="3.48">seems like all these people think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="639.96" dur="4.14">going to really go ahead and take action</text>
  <text start="641.94" dur="3.78">against these conspirators so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="3.24">prepared this week to notify the</text>
  <text start="645.72" dur="5.49">Attorney General that we&amp;#39;re prepared to</text>
  <text start="647.34" dur="5.97">sit to send those referrals over and</text>
  <text start="651.21" dur="3.81">brief him if he wishes to be briefed we</text>
  <text start="653.31" dur="4.35">think they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re pretty clear</text>
  <text start="655.02" dur="5.07">but as of right now this is this may not</text>
  <text start="657.66" dur="4.98">be all of them but this cleans up quite</text>
  <text start="660.09" dur="4.86">a bit we have eight referrals that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.64" dur="4.02">prepared to send over to the Attorney</text>
  <text start="664.95" dur="3.15">General this week all right so you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="3.93">got eight referrals that you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="668.1" dur="4.41">send over to the AG this week go through</text>
  <text start="670.59" dur="4.25">those referrals these are criminal</text>
  <text start="672.51" dur="4.74">referrals two of them I know are about</text>
  <text start="674.84" dur="4.51">conspiracy what can you tell us tell us</text>
  <text start="677.25" dur="4.11">as much as you can in terms of breaking</text>
  <text start="679.35" dur="4.59">this news this morning that you are</text>
  <text start="681.36" dur="4.53">prepared to send over eight criminal</text>
  <text start="683.94" dur="6.15">referrals next week what are the</text>
  <text start="685.89" dur="6.18">congressmen so I would say that first of</text>
  <text start="690.09" dur="3.84">all all of these are classified or</text>
  <text start="692.07" dur="3.15">sensitive and so because the a lot of</text>
  <text start="693.93" dur="4.17">them could contain sensitive or</text>
  <text start="695.22" dur="4.68">classified information five of them are</text>
  <text start="698.1" dur="4.14">what I would call straight-up referrals</text>
  <text start="699.9" dur="4.59">so just referrals that are that names</text>
  <text start="702.24" dur="5.7">someone and name the specific crimes</text>
  <text start="704.49" dur="5.58">those crimes are lying to Congress</text>
  <text start="707.94" dur="5.61">misleading Congress leaking classified</text>
  <text start="710.07" dur="6.72">information so five of them are are</text>
  <text start="713.55" dur="4.77">those types there are three that I think</text>
  <text start="716.79" dur="4.2">are more complicated so you mentioned</text>
  <text start="718.32" dur="4.44">conspiracies so the question on</text>
  <text start="720.99" dur="4.11">conspiracy is is what you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="722.76" dur="3.66">the conspiracy statute and then what did</text>
  <text start="725.1" dur="2.5">they what do they need to look at under</text>
  <text start="726.42" dur="3.64">that statute so</text>
  <text start="727.6" dur="4.62">hold on a second people I want to show</text>
  <text start="730.06" dur="4.02">you something I just wanted to show you</text>
  <text start="732.22" dur="6.15">this because I think it&amp;#39;s funny and a</text>
  <text start="734.08" dur="6">little bit ironic Paul Manafort was</text>
  <text start="738.37" dur="4.23">indicted for conspiracy against the</text>
  <text start="740.08" dur="6.06">United States and they go through here</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="6.54">now there are many different subsections</text>
  <text start="746.14" dur="5.1">of the conspiracy statute and their</text>
  <text start="749.14" dur="3.66">penalties range depending on the</text>
  <text start="751.24" dur="4.23">severity of the offense and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>

  <text start="764.83" dur="5.46">conspiracy it&amp;#39;s a congress created</text>
  <text start="767.64" dur="3.97">statute meaning that Congress was the</text>
  <text start="770.29" dur="2.76">one who said this is a crime we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="771.61" dur="4.2">putting it on the books it is a</text>
  <text start="773.05" dur="5.16">wide-ranging statute it implicates many</text>
  <text start="775.81" dur="4.53">people it even implicates actions that</text>
  <text start="778.21" dur="4.44">are taken after the conspiracy is</text>
  <text start="780.34" dur="3.96">identified and even anybody who does</text>
  <text start="782.65" dur="3.81">anything in relation to this moving</text>
  <text start="784.3" dur="4.23">forward is then wrapped into this so</text>
  <text start="786.46" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s bigger than you think and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="788.53" dur="3.96">why Devin eNOS is saying what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="789.88" dur="5.1">saying here never mind it a little</text>
  <text start="792.49" dur="5.28">Congress misleading Congress leaking</text>
  <text start="794.98" dur="6.78">classified information so five of them</text>
  <text start="797.77" dur="5.28">are are those types there are three that</text>
  <text start="801.76" dur="4.29">I think are more complicated so you</text>
  <text start="803.05" dur="4.8">mentioned conspiracy so the question on</text>
  <text start="806.05" dur="4.14">conspiracy is is what you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.85" dur="3.66">the conspiracy statute and then what did</text>
  <text start="810.19" dur="4.5">they what do they need to look at under</text>
  <text start="811.51" dur="4.95">that statute so on the first one is FISA</text>
  <text start="814.69" dur="3.48">abuse and other matters we believe there</text>
  <text start="816.46" dur="4.38">was a conspiracy to lie to the FISA</text>
  <text start="818.17" dur="5.09">Court and its lead the FISA Court by</text>
  <text start="820.84" dur="5.85">numerous individuals that all need to be</text>
  <text start="823.26" dur="5.35">investigated and looked at that and we</text>
  <text start="826.69" dur="5.21">believe the statute is the conspiracy</text>
  <text start="828.61" dur="5.61">statute the second conspiracy one is</text>
  <text start="831.9" dur="5.83">involving manipulation of intelligence</text>
  <text start="834.22" dur="6.84">that also could in Sonora many Americans</text>
  <text start="837.73" dur="5.16">and we are so that&amp;#39;s kind of the second</text>
  <text start="841.06" dur="3.48">one as you know we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of</text>
  <text start="842.89" dur="5.06">concerns with the way intelligence was</text>
  <text start="844.54" dur="5.75">used so the population of intelligence</text>
  <text start="847.95" dur="4.71">manipulation of intelligence</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="5.74">manipulation of intelligence could be</text>
  <text start="852.66" dur="7.77">taking certain information and changing</text>
  <text start="856.03" dur="4.4">it to suit your needs it could be</text>
  <text start="860.529" dur="3.031">leaking bits and pieces of things that</text>
  <text start="862.569" dur="5.911">aren&amp;#39;t the whole picture</text>
  <text start="863.56" dur="7.23">it could be weaponizing certain pieces</text>
  <text start="868.48" dur="2.88">of information against others it gets a</text>
  <text start="870.79" dur="2.279">little Shady</text>
  <text start="871.36" dur="4.159">there&amp;#39;s no specific statute that would</text>
  <text start="873.069" dur="4.38">be kind of the two conspiracy</text>
  <text start="875.519" dur="4.69">recommendations referrals that were that</text>
  <text start="877.449" dur="7.32">we&amp;#39;re making the third is what I would</text>
  <text start="880.209" dur="8.25">call a global leak referral so there are</text>
  <text start="884.769" dur="6.391">about a dozen highly sensitized highly</text>
  <text start="888.459" dur="4.891">sensitive classified information leaks</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="5.39">that were given to only a few reporters</text>
  <text start="893.35" dur="5.609">over the last two and a half plus years</text>
  <text start="896.55" dur="4.029">so you know we don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="898.959" dur="5.521">actually been any leak investigations</text>
  <text start="900.579" dur="6.151">that have been open yes you do that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="904.48" dur="3.93">twice he stated he didn&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="906.73" dur="3.12">there&amp;#39;s been any leak investigations</text>
  <text start="908.41" dur="3">that have been open but we do believe</text>
  <text start="909.85" dur="4.32">that we&amp;#39;ve got pretty good information</text>
  <text start="911.41" dur="4.979">and a pretty good idea of who could be</text>
  <text start="914.17" dur="3.539">behind these leaks it doesn&amp;#39;t mean we</text>
  <text start="916.389" dur="2.7">know all the people are behind the leaks</text>
  <text start="917.709" dur="2.37">is because you know when you read these</text>
  <text start="919.089" dur="3.6">a lot of these there are always</text>
  <text start="920.079" dur="4.921">anonymous sources and they always say</text>
  <text start="922.689" dur="7.14">something to the effect of current and</text>
  <text start="925" dur="7.319">and former senior officials so we think</text>
  <text start="929.829" dur="4.021">we&amp;#39;ve got a pretty good idea of who some</text>
  <text start="932.319" dur="3.661">of the sources are behind this these</text>
  <text start="933.85" dur="3.779">leaks we don&amp;#39;t know if the Department of</text>
  <text start="935.98" dur="2.64">Justice has been looking at these but</text>
  <text start="937.629" dur="2.671">you know there&amp;#39;s just many times</text>
  <text start="938.62" dur="4.31">precedented things have happened and all</text>
  <text start="940.3" dur="6.45">this closed closed with this you had</text>
  <text start="942.93" dur="6.82">conversations with the President and the</text>
  <text start="946.75" dur="7.17">Prime Minister of Australia leaked you</text>
  <text start="949.75" dur="5.939">had leaks of the president talking</text>
  <text start="953.92" dur="4.409">president Trump talking to the Mexican</text>
  <text start="955.689" dur="4.561">president leaked we all know the</text>
  <text start="958.329" dur="4.081">travesty of general Flynn</text>
  <text start="960.25" dur="5.069">nobody knows where those supposed to</text>
  <text start="962.41" dur="4.89">transcripts came from so those are just</text>
  <text start="965.319" dur="4.051">you know kind of three examples that are</text>
  <text start="967.3" dur="4.079">that are absolutely horrific but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="969.37" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s things that are even worse that</text>
  <text start="971.379" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re leaked and there&amp;#39;s only a couple</text>
  <text start="972.91" dur="5.729">of two or three reporters involved in</text>
  <text start="975.129" dur="5.87">this and so hmm there are things that</text>
  <text start="978.639" dur="4.89">are even worse that were leaked</text>
  <text start="980.999" dur="5.38">surrounding three reporters ignatius</text>
  <text start="983.529" dur="4.441">maybe corn who who do you think it is</text>
  <text start="986.379" dur="3.69">sound off in the comments below about</text>
  <text start="987.97" dur="5.099">who you think the reporters behind this</text>
  <text start="990.069" dur="4.351">are and if we ever get to see fusion</text>
  <text start="993.069" dur="2.881">gps&amp;#39;s bank records</text>
  <text start="994.42" dur="3.75">who&amp;#39;s on the payroll it wouldn&amp;#39;t be hard</text>
  <text start="995.95" dur="3.84">to get to the bottom of but you&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="998.17" dur="4.86">so you know we&amp;#39;re prepared to make those</text>
  <text start="999.79" dur="7.02">eight referrals this week so the two on</text>
  <text start="1003.03" dur="5.52">conspiracy the one on global leaks and</text>
  <text start="1006.81" dur="4.92">then five that are more specific online</text>
  <text start="1008.55" dur="5.85">leaking and misleading Congress explain</text>
  <text start="1011.73" dur="4.32">to our audience what criminal referral</text>
  <text start="1014.4" dur="3.99">means because you know we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1016.05" dur="4.65">talking about this as well for two years</text>
  <text start="1018.39" dur="5.79">and our audience wants to know where the</text>
  <text start="1020.7" dur="5.7">accountability is she knows her audience</text>
  <text start="1024.18" dur="6.6">very well you already know that there</text>
  <text start="1026.4" dur="6.9">was a criminal referral to Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="1030.78" dur="4.38">the number two guy at the FBI so where</text>
  <text start="1033.3" dur="4.02">does that stand what does that mean that</text>
  <text start="1035.16" dur="4.41">he was criminally referred he&amp;#39;s out on a</text>
  <text start="1037.32" dur="3.33">book tour so you know viewers are saying</text>
  <text start="1039.57" dur="2.82">well okay</text>
  <text start="1040.65" dur="3.45">he was criminally referred but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1042.39" dur="5.49">still on his book tour so what does that</text>
  <text start="1044.1" dur="5.37">really mean for accountability I think</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s a great question because people get</text>
  <text start="1049.47" dur="3.75">so frustrated you know as I am all over</text>
  <text start="1051.33" dur="4.41">a you know go around the United States</text>
  <text start="1053.22" dur="3.9">of America and in my district people are</text>
  <text start="1055.74" dur="3.09">frustrated they&amp;#39;re like why can&amp;#39;t you do</text>
  <text start="1057.12" dur="2.67">anything people have to understand</text>
  <text start="1058.83" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s three branches of government</text>
  <text start="1059.79" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re the legislative branch we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="1062.43" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t strap on guns and bring handcuffs</text>
  <text start="1064.32" dur="4.8">out to the crime scene all we can do is</text>
  <text start="1066.63" dur="5.67">investigate we can take information from</text>
  <text start="1069.12" dur="4.59">folks we can interview people and as you</text>
  <text start="1072.3" dur="3.66">as everyone knows that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1073.71" dur="4.77">doing for two-and-a-half years but we</text>
  <text start="1075.96" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t have the power to arrest or</text>
  <text start="1078.48" dur="4.86">convict so we have to to take these</text>
  <text start="1081.42" dur="3.39">criminal referrals to the Department of</text>
  <text start="1083.34" dur="3.08">Justice with all of our all the</text>
  <text start="1084.81" dur="4.71">information all the work that we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="1086.42" dur="4.57">ask the Department of Justice to take</text>
  <text start="1089.52" dur="3.27">these up and look maybe the Department</text>
  <text start="1090.99" dur="8.46">of Justice already has investigations</text>
  <text start="1092.79" dur="8.76">open and maybe they don&amp;#39;t um what do you</text>
  <text start="1099.45" dur="4.74">see what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s leading us down</text>
  <text start="1101.55" dur="3.96">a road see I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1104.19" dur="2.76">talking about this I don&amp;#39;t know if they</text>
  <text start="1105.51" dur="3.75">might be looking at this I&amp;#39;m not sure if</text>
  <text start="1106.95" dur="4.8">they see this is what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1109.26" dur="4.02">but they are the investigative arm now</text>
  <text start="1111.75" dur="3.33">it gets more complicated because you</text>
  <text start="1113.28" dur="4.29">have the top officials in the Department</text>
  <text start="1115.08" dur="4.65">of Justice and the FBI that are likely</text>
  <text start="1117.57" dur="6.06">involved in the referrals that work that</text>
  <text start="1119.73" dur="7.11">we&amp;#39;re going to make so with that do you</text>
  <text start="1123.63" dur="5.18">hear what he just said he just gave you</text>
  <text start="1126.84" dur="4.74">a big hint</text>
  <text start="1128.81" dur="7.57">we&amp;#39;re about to make criminal referrals</text>

  <text start="1177.54" dur="4.38">decides to to look at that information</text>

  <text start="1204.27" dur="7.08">criminal investigation yeah I think look</text>
  <text start="1208.77" dur="3.87">I think it&amp;#39;s impossible to ignore you</text>
  <text start="1211.35" dur="2.94">know some of these are very straight up</text>
  <text start="1212.64" dur="3.33">I mean you I mean if they&amp;#39;re busting</text>
  <text start="1214.29" dur="4.02">people you know if the Moller team was</text>
  <text start="1215.97" dur="5.67">busting people for lying to the FBI I</text>
  <text start="1218.31" dur="6.24">mean there&amp;#39;s some pretty simple times</text>
  <text start="1221.64" dur="4.53">when people lied to Congress misled</text>
  <text start="1224.55" dur="4.2">Congress you know for the sole companies</text>
  <text start="1226.17" dur="3.9">of obstructing our investigation and</text>
  <text start="1228.75" dur="2.7">remember what we were what we were</text>
  <text start="1230.07" dur="3.12">trying to get to the bottom of that was</text>
  <text start="1231.45" dur="4.26">that the Dupree name that justice end</text>
  <text start="1233.19" dur="4.8">the FBI and the Clinton campaign were</text>
  <text start="1235.71" dur="4.56">essentially taking information from</text>
  <text start="1237.99" dur="4.31">Russians you know the very thing they</text>
  <text start="1240.27" dur="4.35">were looking at the Trump campaign force</text>
  <text start="1242.3" dur="5.08">what he&amp;#39;s basically saying is there</text>
  <text start="1244.62" dur="6.03">because the Russian Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="1247.38" dur="6.33">supposedly used Russian sources they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1250.65" dur="5.49">taking information from Russians just</text>
  <text start="1253.71" dur="4.98">like they were accusing the president of</text>
  <text start="1256.14" dur="5.34">doing that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s saying I&amp;#39;m clear</text>
  <text start="1258.69" dur="4.739">as day so I would be surprised if</text>
  <text start="1261.48" dur="3.42">they don&amp;#39;t if they don&amp;#39;t take this some</text>
  <text start="1263.429" dur="4.051">of these up that are very just cut and</text>
  <text start="1264.9" dur="4.529">dry very simple could be prosecuted in a</text>
  <text start="1267.48" dur="4.89">short amount of time how many people is</text>
  <text start="1269.429" dur="7.831">this capped there could be prosecuted in</text>
  <text start="1272.37" dur="8.1">a short amount of time I would submit</text>
  <text start="1277.26" dur="5.82">that this has been ongoing this entire</text>
  <text start="1280.47" dur="4.26">time it&amp;#39;s going to appear as though</text>
  <text start="1283.08" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re prosecuted in a short amount of</text>
  <text start="1284.73" dur="4.62">time when these criminal referrals are</text>
  <text start="1286.559" dur="4.711">handed over but I will tell you that my</text>
  <text start="1289.35" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ve been saying this this has been</text>
  <text start="1291.27" dur="3.87">going on for a very long time they</text>
  <text start="1293.37" dur="4.049">needed the public sentiment to be there</text>
  <text start="1295.14" dur="7.44">the public the public perception or</text>
  <text start="1297.419" dur="8.64">what&amp;#39;s the word I&amp;#39;m looking for it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1302.58" dur="6.3">escaping me darn it they need the public</text>

  <text start="1311.97" dur="3.78">bother me all day damn it anyway they</text>
  <text start="1314.58" dur="2.94">need that to be there for them to be</text>
  <text start="1315.75" dur="3.299">able to move forward with the</text>
  <text start="1317.52" dur="2.789">convictions and the indictments and all</text>
  <text start="1319.049" dur="3.361">that and now it&amp;#39;s here</text>

  <text start="1324.12" dur="3.63">referrals over and all of a sudden voila</text>
  <text start="1326.46" dur="3.24">look how straightforward and easy it was</text>
  <text start="1327.75" dur="2.48">to prosecute these leakers think about</text>
  <text start="1329.7" dur="2.88">it</text>
  <text start="1330.23" dur="4.689">churring you&amp;#39;ve got eight referrals</text>
  <text start="1332.58" dur="4.86">several people lied to Congress several</text>
  <text start="1334.919" dur="4.321">people also apparently misled the FISA</text>
  <text start="1337.44" dur="3.69">Court and I want you to explain how they</text>
  <text start="1339.24" dur="4.02">misled the FISA Court but first tell us</text>
  <text start="1341.13" dur="3.84">how many people is this capturing can</text>
  <text start="1343.26" dur="5.19">you give us any names on this list in</text>
  <text start="1344.97" dur="4.8">terms of your referrals well I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1348.45" dur="3.03">prepared to give any names but I think</text>
  <text start="1349.77" dur="3.93">most people that have followed Russia</text>
  <text start="1351.48" dur="3.96">Gate for a long time they know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1353.7" dur="4.26">the names but there&amp;#39;s five that are</text>
  <text start="1355.44" dur="4.44">straight up five names then there are</text>
  <text start="1357.96" dur="3.42">when you when you get to the leaks we</text>
  <text start="1359.88" dur="2.7">don&amp;#39;t know we think there&amp;#39;s only a few</text>
  <text start="1361.38" dur="3.06">people behind these leaks but there</text>
  <text start="1362.58" dur="4.17">could be multiple people so on the leak</text>
  <text start="1364.44" dur="5.609">the global leak referral there could be</text>
  <text start="1366.75" dur="4.74">there could be several individuals when</text>
  <text start="1370.049" dur="3.841">you look at the conspiracy I mean that</text>
  <text start="1371.49" dur="4.41">could get up to a dozen two dozen people</text>
  <text start="1373.89" dur="4.05">so you know for example we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1375.9" dur="3.75">all the people that are involved look we</text>
  <text start="1377.94" dur="2.79">know struck and page and we know their</text>
  <text start="1379.65" dur="2.73">involvement because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1380.73" dur="3.689">interviewed but you know there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="1382.38" dur="3.99">people that were above struck and Veloz</text>
  <text start="1384.419" dur="4.38">rock that have not been interviewed so</text>
  <text start="1386.37" dur="4.26">we don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re involved in</text>
  <text start="1388.799" dur="3.331">this conspiracy or not but you know one</text>
  <text start="1390.63" dur="3.81">of the things that&amp;#39;s been great if we as</text>

  <text start="1404.03" dur="4.3">investigation that we&amp;#39;ve undertaken but</text>
  <text start="1406.68" dur="3.33">I think one that has been quite fruitful</text>
  <text start="1408.33" dur="3.87">so that we can put the United States on</text>

  <text start="1517.89" dur="8.97">zero doubt we will see accountability</text>

  <text start="1560.82" dur="5.67">years he said the president committed</text>
  <text start="1561.99" dur="7.34">treason yeah well look what I would say</text>
  <text start="1566.49" dur="6.45">about about all of these former</text>
  <text start="1569.33" dur="5.079">intelligence heads is that you know this</text>
  <text start="1572.94" dur="2.79">is just not appropriate I think some</text>
  <text start="1574.409" dur="3.27">point Congress is going to have to look</text>
  <text start="1575.73" dur="4.679">at these laws and decide you know do we</text>

  <text start="1683.24" dur="3.57">the insurance policy was just the</text>
  <text start="1685.28" dur="3.66">overall investigation of the Trump</text>
  <text start="1686.81" dur="5.19">campaign it&amp;#39;s actually much more</text>
  <text start="1688.94" dur="4.62">conspiratorial than that that&amp;#39;s left</text>
  <text start="1692" dur="3.06">behind there there was a scope Ettore</text>
  <text start="1693.56" dur="6.72">information we&amp;#39;ve talked about it on</text>
  <text start="1695.06" dur="8.94">your on your show many times so what</text>
  <text start="1700.28" dur="7.79">don&amp;#39;t we know what don&amp;#39;t we know if the</text>
  <text start="1704" dur="9.42">FISA warrant was the insurance policy</text>
  <text start="1708.07" dur="6.7">what don&amp;#39;t we know we&amp;#39;ve been going on</text>
  <text start="1713.42" dur="3.54">this whole time thinking like Devon</text>
  <text start="1714.77" dur="4.05">Nunez said the insurance policy was</text>
  <text start="1716.96" dur="3.24">opening this investigation into Trump to</text>
  <text start="1718.82" dur="6.57">dirty him up so that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="1720.2" dur="7.2">to successfully govern and or to stop</text>
  <text start="1725.39" dur="4.98">him from governing and or to get him</text>
  <text start="1727.4" dur="5.61">impeached what don&amp;#39;t we knit was really</text>
  <text start="1730.37" dur="5.37">that the FISA abuse was the insurance</text>
  <text start="1733.01" dur="6.18">policy what the hell was the main</text>
  <text start="1735.74" dur="7.86">conspiracy for goodness sakes holy moley</text>
  <text start="1739.19" dur="6.6">that sentence is important look Maria if</text>
  <text start="1743.6" dur="4.29">you take what the Democrats have said</text>
  <text start="1745.79" dur="3.63">throughout the last two and a half years</text>
  <text start="1747.89" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s only one thing that you can be</text>
  <text start="1749.42" dur="5.43">certain of and that is whatever they</text>
  <text start="1751.7" dur="5.49">tell you is wrong or a lie or they</text>
  <text start="1754.85" dur="5.63">actually mean the opposite should the</text>
  <text start="1757.19" dur="5.19">mullah report be made public congressman</text>
  <text start="1760.48" dur="3.19">well what I&amp;#39;ve said about the mole I</text>
  <text start="1762.38" dur="2.79">think I was one of the first members of</text>
  <text start="1763.67" dur="4.02">Congress to actually say that the molar</text>
  <text start="1765.17" dur="4.26">report should be made public but not</text>
  <text start="1767.69" dur="4.14">just the molar report because remember</text>
  <text start="1769.43" dur="5.19">many people that are on the team the</text>
  <text start="1771.83" dur="5.85">molar team are involved in a lot of</text>
  <text start="1774.62" dur="6.09">these conspiracies right so you have you</text>
  <text start="1777.68" dur="5.99">have the the leader on the team as the</text>
  <text start="1780.71" dur="5.55">deputy supposedly and another top lawyer</text>
  <text start="1783.67" dur="7.2">we&amp;#39;re both involved in the chain of</text>
  <text start="1786.26" dur="4.61">custody of the Steele dossier the dinner</text>
  <text start="1792.6" dur="5.68">do you remember the other day I did the</text>
  <text start="1796.39" dur="3.33">thing where I said that Horowitz was</text>
  <text start="1798.28" dur="7.7">going to be investigating the special</text>
  <text start="1799.72" dur="8.91">council I think that were passed that he</text>
  <text start="1805.98" dur="6.85">just basically implicated and your</text>
  <text start="1808.63" dur="7.29">Weissman at least Andrew Weissman in one</text>
  <text start="1812.83" dur="8.58">of the conspiracy referrals think about</text>
  <text start="1815.92" dur="8.04">that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s big Murat op the</text>
  <text start="1821.41" dur="4.17">Democratic Auto dirt it is impossible</text>
  <text start="1823.96" dur="4.23">for me to believe that those two lawyers</text>
  <text start="1825.58" dur="6.15">very smart lawyers didn&amp;#39;t know in the</text>
  <text start="1828.19" dur="5.61">middle of 2016 that that information was</text>
  <text start="1831.73" dur="4.59">dirt coming from the Democrats it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1833.8" dur="4.53">impossible the other two you had two FBI</text>
  <text start="1836.32" dur="4.17">agents struck in Page who were kicked</text>
  <text start="1838.33" dur="4.38">off the Moller team so they&amp;#39;re done the</text>
  <text start="1840.49" dur="3.99">underlying their tension because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1842.71" dur="3.33">believe I think the indictments that</text>
  <text start="1844.48" dur="3.66">were made by the Moller team I think</text>
  <text start="1846.04" dur="4.35">some are very questionable and I think</text>
  <text start="1848.14" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s pieces of them that always read</text>
  <text start="1850.39" dur="4.74">like Russian spy novels that was done on</text>
  <text start="1852.4" dur="4.59">purpose to create a narrative to make</text>
  <text start="1855.13" dur="3.81">the American people think as they were</text>
  <text start="1856.99" dur="3.9">indicted these people that somehow this</text>
  <text start="1858.94" dur="5.19">had to do with collusion between the</text>
  <text start="1860.89" dur="5.25">Trump campaign and Russia and and so</text>
  <text start="1864.13" dur="3.3">what do I want about the Moller point I</text>
  <text start="1866.14" dur="2.88">don&amp;#39;t care what&amp;#39;s in the molar report</text>
  <text start="1867.43" dur="3.66">matter of fact I call it the molar</text>
  <text start="1869.02" dur="5.73">dossier yeah what I want is the</text>
  <text start="1871.09" dur="4.98">information underlying the report so</text>
  <text start="1874.75" dur="3.39">that we can actually look into it</text>
  <text start="1876.07" dur="4.35">because every time we we peel back the</text>
  <text start="1878.14" dur="5.91">onion in this case what do we find we</text>
  <text start="1880.42" dur="5.82">find out that somehow level officials</text>
  <text start="1884.05" dur="5.45">within the DOJ and FBI were misleading</text>
  <text start="1886.24" dur="6.87">the American people and the courts yeah</text>
  <text start="1889.5" dur="7.48">what he basically said was that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1893.11" dur="5.43">going to find more conspiracy using the</text>
  <text start="1896.98" dur="4.62">underlying information of the Muller</text>
  <text start="1898.54" dur="4.83">report so basically what they&amp;#39;ll push</text>
  <text start="1901.6" dur="3.96">off in the report as something</text>
  <text start="1903.37" dur="4.65">detrimental against the Trump team or</text>
  <text start="1905.56" dur="9.72">against Trump is in actuality still the</text>
  <text start="1908.02" dur="8.88">conspiracy against Trump so what the</text>
  <text start="1915.28" dur="3.84">left would look at on the underlying</text>
  <text start="1916.9" dur="3.6">information not the blabber of the</text>
  <text start="1919.12" dur="3.24">report itself with the underlying</text>
  <text start="1920.5" dur="3.33">information like the Seth Abramson&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="1922.36" dur="3.09">the world and take that to mean that</text>
  <text start="1923.83" dur="4.949">there&amp;#39;s all this horrible stuff</text>
  <text start="1925.45" dur="4.89">going on around the you know it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1928.779" dur="3.541">this horrible stuff going on around the</text>
  <text start="1930.34" dur="3.42">Trump campaign but those people with the</text>
  <text start="1932.32" dur="3.18">underlying information that connections</text>
  <text start="1933.76" dur="3.419">between them what they&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1935.5" dur="4.2">all trickle back down into this</text>
  <text start="1937.179" dur="5.46">conspiracy that Nunez is talking about</text>
