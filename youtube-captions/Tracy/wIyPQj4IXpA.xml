  <text start="212.37" dur="5.04">D closed in Federal disclosed in federal</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="4.53">court that he obtained a copy of the</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="3.9">report in December he says that his</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="5.099">source allowed him to take photographs</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="6.239">of the dossier the identity of the</text>
  <text start="224.819" dur="6.151">source is significant for two reasons</text>
  <text start="227.549" dur="5.421">it is a central question in a lawsuit</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="4.65">filed against the media outlet by</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="5.379">Gubarev a Russian tech executive named</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="6.149">in the dossier he&amp;#39;s identified by name</text>
  <text start="238.349" dur="5.371">and steals December 13th memo in it he</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="5.041">alleges that Gubarev was recruited under</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="4.68">duress by the FSB and that he used his</text>
  <text start="246.81" dur="3.03">companies to infiltrate the computer</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="3.72">systems of the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="4.59">Committee and the video that will</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="3.78">immediately follow this one will</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="5.089">give you some more information in</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="5.66">regards to that whole shenanigan okay</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="4.451">lots work today</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="4.359">gubarev attorneys have said they want to</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="3.72">find out if BuzzFeed source provided any</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="3.331">warnings or qualifications about the</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="4.83">allegations made in the dossier</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="5.31">if so lawyers are likely to argue that</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="5.97">BuzzFeed was negligent and careless in</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="9.06">publishing it BuzzFeed&amp;#39;s apologized to</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="6.69">him and but defended its decision to</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="4.079">publish noting that its article</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="6.109">unveiling Steel&amp;#39;s memos explicitly state</text>
  <text start="287.699" dur="3.59">that the memos had not been cooperating</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="6.67">anyway there&amp;#39;s a lot more in this</text>
  <text start="297.84" dur="4.44">article but I started thinking to myself</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="5.429">who is this dude and how does he know</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="4.47">McCain and what is his history and what</text>
