  <text start="38.399" dur="4.73">it&amp;#39;s like dude just stop you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="5.941">anything valuable here at all but I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="51" dur="7.32">she talks really low like this and it</text>
  <text start="54.89" dur="6.099">wasn&amp;#39;t right so one of the things that</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ve been doing at Twitter is signaling</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="3.75">to all the people on the left that the</text>
  <text start="62.67" dur="5.39">only way we know that something&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="64.739" dur="7.021">wrong is if we&amp;#39;re alerted to it by users</text>
  <text start="68.06" dur="5.65">so yeah please report things yeah they</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="4.53">all have they all have the research and</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="4.409">you know they make themselves they make</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="5.009">themselves into the meme of the of the</text>

  <text start="82.68" dur="4.799">Jack Dorsey the little man with a really</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="4.74">great idea who now has to figure out how</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="5.1">to perfect human interaction you know</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="5.4">let people talk if it&amp;#39;s a death threat</text>
  <text start="92.579" dur="5.281">we know about it if it&amp;#39;s just people who</text>
  <text start="95.49" dur="3.989">are are annoyed by those around them who</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="4.049">don&amp;#39;t see the world the same way you</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="4.201">created a block option you created a new</text>
  <text start="101.909" dur="4.111">option which is like a light-blocking</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="4.799">what why why are we getting into this</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="4.95">why they put so much importance on them</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.401">and they mask all of their bias with all</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="6.84">this technical crap well the funny thing</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="8.19">is too is that like I feel like Jack was</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="6.36">Jack was utter like right I feel like</text>
  <text start="122.07" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s a puppet and he has a bunch of</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="4.709">people with strings holding him up and</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="6.06">he wants to do certain things that he</text>
  <text start="128.879" dur="5.761">can&amp;#39;t do or he just is really that night</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="3.75">to the fact that their platform has he</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="4.71">even said that they have been</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="4.91">responsible for creating bubbles and the</text>
  <text start="139.35" dur="5.37">research that they&amp;#39;ve done has shown</text>
  <text start="141.08" dur="5.62">that people on the Left will really only</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="4.68">follow people on the right on the left</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="5.31">but people on the right follow everybody</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="5.1">yeah it may create because they keep</text>
  <text start="152.01" dur="6.03">creating these new these new algorithms</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="5.4">and these new they keep I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="5.279">putting all these new practices into</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="5.4">play that really do keep people on their</text>
  <text start="163.319" dur="4.621">side of the gym unless they go and try</text>
  <text start="165.3" dur="6.36">to seek out willfully seek out they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="8.64">never stop stumble upon anything that is</text>
  <text start="171.66" dur="7.53">not within their normal their normal</text>
  <text start="176.58" dur="4.439">tastes there that&amp;#39;s just the whole thing</text>
  <text start="179.19" dur="3.87">there that they create these bubbles and</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="4.201">it just goes shows it just goes to show</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="4.38">the willingness of people on the right</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="5.16">not Republicans just people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="5.28">identify with this crazy progressive</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="4.889">nonsense it just goes to show the</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="4.65">willingness of people and try to see the</text>
  <text start="195.269" dur="5.701">full story and see what really shakes</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="5.459">out in the the arena of common sense you</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="4.5">know you don&amp;#39;t have to be a PhD</text>
  <text start="202.829" dur="5.13">yeah that&amp;#39;s conversations yeah and you</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="4.2">know healthy debate without you know</text>
  <text start="207.959" dur="3.931">basically what what I was getting at is</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="3.599">that they were basically dog whistling</text>
  <text start="211.89" dur="3.629">to the left throughout this entire</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="4.291">interview that if enough people report</text>
  <text start="215.519" dur="4.411">something they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re taking action</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="3.66">on it regardless right and like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="2.79">what they were basically saying and</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="2.549">nobody picked up on the fact that they</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="2.519">kept saying well they broke they</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="3.631">reported it it was a reported it was a</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="4.47">reported it was reported and what they</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="4.35">keep saying they keep saying that what</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="4.081">we were trying to do is targeted attacks</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="3.72">and they wanted to to make sure that</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="3.69">dogpiling didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="4.14">telling people as long as you dog pile</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="4.17">on somebody I will take action right</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="3.83">exactly the exact opposite and she you</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="4.26">know the ones that learned to code so</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="4.389">one of the things that we noticed when</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="3.93">we were doing the research is that there</text>
  <text start="247.829" dur="4.671">was learned to code there were death</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="6.389">threats they were veiled threats and</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="6.489">then there was learn to code nope they</text>
  <text start="256.229" dur="5.161">none none of what she she used</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="5.671">she used she referenced that day of the</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="4.38">Rope thing which is which is for anybody</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="4.11">to say</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="5.13">- even it&amp;#39;s so disingenuous to go out</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="5.25">there and say that people were putting</text>
  <text start="270.9" dur="5.16">out veiled death threats of people who</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="4.92">were jug to journalists who had just</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="5.49">lost their jobs no day of the rope is a</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="5.67">reference of the to their poet their</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.709">professional demise like when when you</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.69">have over the course of a couple of</text>
  <text start="286.259" dur="4.921">weeks all these publications and all</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="5.07">these websites shutting down sizing down</text>

  <text start="316.199" dur="3.75">axe for the rest of your life now you</text>
  <text start="317.849" dur="3.901">are at the other end of it and they went</text>
