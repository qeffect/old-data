  <text start="148.519" dur="5.381">understand that I started this out this</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="3.84">morning by doing a thread about what I</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="4.35">thought would be coming in this report</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="5.34">today and explaining a few different</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="4.019">things that I found important and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="5.4">scrolling through to try and find them</text>
  <text start="162.269" dur="7.201">now I&amp;#39;m gonna go here this okay because</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="5.609">I wanted to kind of set the expectation</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="5.01">from my perspective listen I I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="172.049" dur="4.291">some know-it-all okay I&amp;#39;m really not I</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="4.349">don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not some know-it-all I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="4.489">some of authority for you to bow down</text>
  <text start="178.829" dur="4.081">and listen to I&amp;#39;m just one person</text>
  <text start="180.829" dur="4.75">sharing their perspective on this who</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="6.389">happens to spend nearly 24 hours of</text>
  <text start="185.579" dur="5.311">their day doing this and so you know I</text>
  <text start="189.299" dur="5.761">take that for what it&amp;#39;s worth to you</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="4.56">honestly like I&amp;#39;m not trying to I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.06" dur="2.399">know</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="3.75">scold anybody or yell at anyone or</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="2.941">anything like that just understand that</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="5.67">you know just like you guys have a</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="5.94">motion so do I I say here many have said</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;re getting the IG report today on</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="3.54">James Comey and his leaking and I wanted</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="5.91">to do a quick thread to share some</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="5.97">expectations from my perspective Hannity</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="3.54">mentions the report will be 65 pages it</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="6.3">was a little over 80 but it was kind of</text>
  <text start="217.35" dur="6.84">65 juice pages so to speak it this is</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="7.679">this is basically a spin off report</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="7.109">about the memos just the memos and I</text>
  <text start="229.829" dur="3.06">kind of point to the fact that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.299" dur="5.28">always little things in these reports</text>
  <text start="232.889" dur="6.541">hidden in footnotes in one sentence here</text>
  <text start="236.579" dur="4.47">or one sentence there that give you a</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="5.389">much broader perspective on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="8.011">happening and even uncover crazy stories</text>
  <text start="244.819" dur="6.7">so I I mention here that my big thread</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="5.64">on on the Weiner laptop came from one</text>
  <text start="251.519" dur="7.81">sentence in the Andrew McCabe woe IG</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="6.819">report so</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="5.251">I say kind of where the legacy rubble</text>
  <text start="261.519" dur="4.531">media will tell you guys the basics just</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="3.089">pay attention to the details because</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re really important and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="5.131">lot of history out there that&amp;#39;s based on</text>
  <text start="269.889" dur="4.891">lies and it&amp;#39;s frustrating for me to see</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="4.019">because if we&amp;#39;re gonna get upset about</text>
  <text start="274.78" dur="4.05">something and be frustrated and angry</text>
  <text start="276.819" dur="3.451">about it or you know there&amp;#39;s one crowd</text>
  <text start="278.83" dur="2.79">that just kind of wipes their hands and</text>
  <text start="280.27" dur="3.359">says oh well who gives a shit and walks</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="3.359">away and then there&amp;#39;s another crowd that</text>
  <text start="283.629" dur="4.201">kind of says like I can&amp;#39;t believe this</text>
  <text start="284.979" dur="4.771">but it&amp;#39;s based on untruths and some of</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="4.32">the more reputable people that I know</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="4.889">are doing it and it&amp;#39;s really annoying</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;m like you know at least tell people</text>
  <text start="294.639" dur="5.071">what&amp;#39;s happening don&amp;#39;t make crap up like</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="5.459">making stuff up at this point in time is</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="6">not helpful to anybody anyway so I say</text>
  <text start="302.919" dur="4.861">in here that Solomon had a few weeks ago</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="6.54">John Solomon came out and told us that</text>
  <text start="307.78" dur="6.84">the the that AG bar and the DOJ decided</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="5.129">not to indict Comey or pursue criminal</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="7.289">charges over his leaking of the memos</text>
  <text start="317.379" dur="6.871">over his taking of the memos off-site</text>
  <text start="321.909" dur="3.54">etc so on and so forth and in this IG</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="3.479">report today we learn a lot of things</text>
  <text start="325.449" dur="4.051">number one is that James Comey has</text>
  <text start="327.729" dur="5.071">several skiffs inside of his house</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s number one and it lends into a</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="3.149">whole bunch of other things we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="4.109">talk about when we go through the report</text>
  <text start="335.949" dur="6.27">but before we get to the report I need</text>
  <text start="338.289" dur="6.72">to talk about other things so there is a</text>
  <text start="342.219" dur="6.781">an article here opinion completely</text>
  <text start="345.009" dur="9.571">automatically by Solomon where he</text>
  <text start="349" dur="8.069">explains why it is that they decided not</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="5.369">to charge Comey with these crimes and I</text>
  <text start="357.069" dur="5.371">was furious when they first announced it</text>
  <text start="359.949" dur="4.44">and I said hold on let me take a breath</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="3.689">for a second and understand the legal</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="5.971">ramifications here of what this means</text>
  <text start="366.129" dur="8.551">and why and I&amp;#39;ll be honest with you it</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="5.609">makes sense hate me throw arrows at my I</text>
  <text start="374.68" dur="7.769">mean I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>

  <text start="397.58" dur="11.55">i&amp;#39;ma sing to you while I wait here we go</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="6.76">call me skates on the leaking of</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="6.3">classified information quote we found no</text>
  <text start="426.42" dur="3.51">evidence that Comey Ora&amp;#39;s attorneys</text>
  <text start="428.25" dur="4.29">released any of the classified</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="5.34">information contains in any of the memos</text>
  <text start="432.54" dur="4.68">two members of the media since this is</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="5.25">the key phrase Comey has latched on to</text>
  <text start="437.22" dur="6.39">I&amp;#39;ll explain Comey leaked the contents</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="5.85">of a classified memo to his attorneys</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="6.21">the dinner to trump one which was the</text>
  <text start="446.37" dur="6.63">second memo in the IG report one of</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="5.4">those attorneys which was Richmond then</text>
  <text start="453" dur="4.68">leaked the contents of the memo to the</text>
  <text start="455.22" dur="4.82">New York Times but didn&amp;#39;t leak the</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="5.91">classified portions which were also</text>
  <text start="460.04" dur="5.23">redacted he&amp;#39;s not skating I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="463.59" dur="3.98">that word I want you guys to listen very</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="4.43">carefully here as we explain this</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="6.66">Richmond had a security clearance</text>
  <text start="469.7" dur="8.26">between 2015 and 2017 top secret</text>
  <text start="474.23" dur="6.52">security clearance he quit the FBI in</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="6.24">February of 2017 but wasn&amp;#39;t quote read</text>
  <text start="480.75" dur="5.28">out until July of that year meaning he</text>
  <text start="484.2" dur="3.86">technically had a clearance when Comey</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="5.21">leaked the classified dinner memo to him</text>
  <text start="488.06" dur="7.03">so Richmond didn&amp;#39;t have a need to know</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="7.21">wasn&amp;#39;t working for the FBI but did have</text>
  <text start="495.09" dur="5.4">a clearance that hadn&amp;#39;t lapped yet so</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="4.14">Comey just about gets away with giving</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="3.78">him classified information he retained</text>
  <text start="502.59" dur="2.76">his clearance until he was quote read</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="2.37">out which means like they kind of</text>
  <text start="505.35" dur="1.68">finalized things and say goodbye you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.64" dur="3.81">on your way</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="4.52">Comey gave him this memo during the time</text>
  <text start="510.45" dur="4.58">where he had his clearance</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="7.53">since memo to was actually</text>
  <text start="515.03" dur="6.58">retrospectively classified by the FBI</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="4.509">Comey couldn&amp;#39;t have known which part</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="4.53">were classified when he leaked it to</text>
  <text start="523.589" dur="6.981">Richmond and Richmond wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="526.14" dur="8.54">known either so the FBI in July of 2017</text>
  <text start="530.57" dur="6.579">went back to these memos and and then</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="6.87">reclassified them the right way</text>
  <text start="537.149" dur="9.961">so when Comey did the action of leaking</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="8.61">this memo to Richmond it technically was</text>
  <text start="547.11" dur="7.5">not classified the same way as it was</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="6.58">when the FBI went back around the small</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="5.78">group we&amp;#39;ll talk about and reclassified</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="7.589">everything so mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="5.98">despite skating on the crime technically</text>
  <text start="564.329" dur="6.091">not committing the crime and I want you</text>
  <text start="566.37" dur="7.52">guys to understand let&amp;#39;s pretend the DOJ</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="7.14">said you know what screw it</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="4.689">facts be damned the success of the case</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="3.81">be damned</text>
  <text start="578.579" dur="4.471">everything else be damned everybody out</text>
  <text start="581.37" dur="3.81">there in America wants us to indict</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="4.82">somebody so we&amp;#39;re gonna slap the cuffs</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="5.399">on Jim Comey for a leaking criminal</text>
  <text start="587.87" dur="4.36">classified information even though when</text>
  <text start="590.579" dur="3.51">it comes down to it and we get in front</text>
  <text start="592.23" dur="3.51">of the judge in the court of law they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="594.089" dur="3.601">gonna be able to prove that he had no</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="5.4">idea it was classified when he leaked it</text>
  <text start="597.69" dur="5.85">because he considered it personal by</text>
  <text start="601.14" dur="5.309">golly he even kept it in a personal safe</text>
  <text start="603.54" dur="5.609">the dude was smart about what he did I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="606.449" dur="6.301">sorry but I&amp;#39;m not sorry it is what it is</text>
  <text start="609.149" dur="5.851">this is how Comey conducted himself he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="5.279">a doofus but he&amp;#39;s not okay and they</text>
  <text start="615" dur="5.61">didn&amp;#39;t have a strong enough case so they</text>
  <text start="618.029" dur="5.131">indict Comey for Klat leaking classified</text>
  <text start="620.61" dur="6.99">information they haul him into court and</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="6.9">then he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s found innocent by a jury</text>
  <text start="627.6" dur="4.169">of his peers in Washington DC where</text>
  <text start="630.06" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re all clamoring for an innocent</text>
  <text start="631.769" dur="5.791">verdict how first of all what a waste</text>

  <text start="655.5" dur="7.38">right now clearly how does that set up</text>
  <text start="659.16" dur="5.82">the Justice Department indicted on a</text>

  <text start="1254.08" dur="3.99">found inside the report so my next step</text>
  <text start="1256.21" dur="5.63">investigatively is to take a step back</text>
  <text start="1258.07" dur="7.11">and then begin to loop in timelines okay</text>
  <text start="1261.84" dur="5.08">like when was you know Finch in the</text>

  <text start="1338.83" dur="5.64">show in the very beginning of the IG</text>
  <text start="1340.3" dur="5.58">report here you see on footnote 4 which</text>
  <text start="1344.47" dur="4.35">is where you find a lot of really good</text>
  <text start="1345.88" dur="5.13">information it says 11 months after koma</text>
  <text start="1348.82" dur="4.29">disclose the contents of memo 4 to the x</text>

  <text start="1361.66" dur="5.28">blah blah blah separately in 2017 a</text>
  <text start="1365.17" dur="3.45">Freedom of Information Act lawsuit was</text>
  <text start="1366.94" dur="3.6">brought by a media organization in the</text>
  <text start="1368.62" dur="5.04">United States in the US District Court</text>
  <text start="1370.54" dur="5.31">for DC in an effort to obtain copies of</text>
  <text start="1373.66" dur="3.6">the memos and this is the lawsuit that a</text>
  <text start="1375.85" dur="4.41">lot of us have been talking about lately</text>
  <text start="1377.26" dur="4.14">techno fog etc where it states you know</text>
  <text start="1380.26" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re gonna release certain memos</text>
  <text start="1381.4" dur="8.16">unredacted and when and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="1383.71" dur="8.28">so in 2018 the Court determined that the</text>
  <text start="1389.56" dur="5.1">memos were not subject to release at the</text>
  <text start="1391.99" dur="5.64">time due to the department&amp;#39;s ongoing</text>
  <text start="1394.66" dur="6.5">criminal investigation after the</text>

  <text start="1401.16" dur="3.52">after the conclusion of the criminal</text>
  <text start="1403.21" dur="3.74">investigation the Court determined that</text>
  <text start="1404.68" dur="9.29">the memo should be released but</text>
  <text start="1406.95" dur="10.41">permitted a limited number of redactions</text>
  <text start="1413.97" dur="5.95">so basically what I&amp;#39;m saying here is</text>
  <text start="1417.36" dur="6.76">sometimes when documents aren&amp;#39;t released</text>
  <text start="1419.92" dur="8.82">under FOIA especially now you can kind</text>
  <text start="1424.12" dur="6.12">of back engineer your way into why and</text>
  <text start="1428.74" dur="4.08">a lot of the times figure out like I</text>
  <text start="1430.24" dur="11.15">went over in my FOIA review that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1432.82" dur="8.57">being used in ongoing investigations so</text>
  <text start="1442.83" dur="5.83">put that in perspective as we kind of</text>
  <text start="1446.08" dur="6.87">move along here about why documents are</text>
  <text start="1448.66" dur="6.87">sometimes withheld in these suits Andrew</text>
  <text start="1452.95" dur="8.82">McCabe was the one who referred this to</text>
  <text start="1455.53" dur="9.12">the IG for a review in 2017 after they</text>
  <text start="1461.77" dur="4.409">determined that Comey gave his memos to</text>
  <text start="1464.65" dur="3.659">his attorneys that had classified</text>
  <text start="1466.179" dur="3.841">information so they go through the</text>
  <text start="1468.309" dur="4.771">classification as a small group its</text>
  <text start="1470.02" dur="4.68">McCabe page struck sound familiar pre</text>
  <text start="1473.08" dur="4.74">step I believe was involved we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="1474.7" dur="5.25">into that in a second they all sit down</text>
  <text start="1477.82" dur="3.81">they work with some other folks they</text>
  <text start="1479.95" dur="3.72">look through the classifications and</text>
  <text start="1481.63" dur="4.26">they decide whether they&amp;#39;re gonna up</text>
  <text start="1483.67" dur="3.9">classify things or down classify things</text>
  <text start="1485.89" dur="3.33">and they decide that they are going to</text>
  <text start="1487.57" dur="4.56">add classification to some things that</text>
  <text start="1489.22" dur="4.89">were not and after that during the time</text>
  <text start="1492.13" dur="3.33">where James Comey is in Congress and</text>
  <text start="1494.11" dur="3.42">he&amp;#39;s sitting in front of Congress and</text>
  <text start="1495.46" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s testifying forget which committee</text>
  <text start="1497.53" dur="4.2">it was under he says that he gave these</text>
  <text start="1499.99" dur="3">things to his attorneys and everybody</text>
  <text start="1501.73" dur="3.06">looks at each other and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1502.99" dur="4.05">what because supposedly</text>
  <text start="1504.79" dur="5.19">they had no idea that he had also given</text>
  <text start="1507.04" dur="6.33">these to other people so they run at</text>
  <text start="1509.98" dur="5.79">that point and they say all right well</text>
  <text start="1513.37" dur="6.23">now we need an IG investigation because</text>
  <text start="1515.77" dur="10.73">now we have these classifications and</text>
  <text start="1519.6" dur="11.13">this stuff here we go</text>
  <text start="1526.5" dur="7.23">let me just see something really quickly</text>
  <text start="1530.73" dur="3">okay</text>
  <text start="1534.12" dur="5.83">so in the beginning when I was reviewing</text>
  <text start="1538.06" dur="3.63">this there&amp;#39;s a timeline in here and it</text>
  <text start="1539.95" dur="4.95">goes through and it says when things</text>
  <text start="1541.69" dur="5.55">were done and it says on May 14th he</text>
  <text start="1544.9" dur="6.21">sent scanned copies to his attorneys and</text>
  <text start="1547.24" dur="6.69">they knew that these copies were</text>
  <text start="1551.11" dur="5.31">forwarded to other attorneys David Kelly</text>
  <text start="1553.93" dur="4.71">and Richmond and I picked that out</text>
  <text start="1556.42" dur="5.19">immediately because to me I thought to</text>
  <text start="1558.64" dur="7.53">myself okay how does the IG which is a</text>
  <text start="1561.61" dur="6.54">government-run entity how do they know</text>
  <text start="1566.17" dur="3.06">what Richmond forwarded because</text>
  <text start="1568.15" dur="3.6">Richmond&amp;#39;s not a government employee</text>
  <text start="1569.23" dur="3.93">anymore what he for what what these</text>
  <text start="1571.75" dur="3.06">attorneys forwarded to one another</text>
  <text start="1573.16" dur="5.31">unless they&amp;#39;re working with some kind of</text>
  <text start="1574.81" dur="5.37">prosecutorial or DOJ arm to come to</text>
  <text start="1578.47" dur="3.6">those conclusions and subpoena the</text>
  <text start="1580.18" dur="4.38">emails or however they figure it out and</text>
  <text start="1582.07" dur="5.25">I immediately said in my brief reading</text>
  <text start="1584.56" dur="5.79">of this right now I&amp;#39;m thinking that this</text>
  <text start="1587.32" dur="4.86">is because they&amp;#39;re working with the I</text>
  <text start="1590.35" dur="4.35">would they&amp;#39;re working with a US attorney</text>
  <text start="1592.18" dur="4.86">I was wrong it&amp;#39;s not because of that so</text>
  <text start="1594.7" dur="4.83">this this beginning part here where I</text>
  <text start="1597.04" dur="4.71">say that just disregard because it ends</text>
  <text start="1599.53" dur="7.23">up that the FBI themselves are the ones</text>
  <text start="1601.75" dur="7.89">that figure this out so another quasi</text>
  <text start="1606.76" dur="6">entrapment here this really bothered me</text>
  <text start="1609.64" dur="5.19">a lot and made me kind of Angry Baker</text>
  <text start="1612.76" dur="3.45">and McCabe told the OIG they raised and</text>
  <text start="1614.83" dur="3.21">discussed with Comey a number of</text>
  <text start="1616.21" dur="4.02">concerns about Comey meeting alone with</text>
  <text start="1618.04" dur="3.75">the president Baker and McCabe said they</text>
  <text start="1620.23" dur="3.9">agreed about the briefing needing to be</text>
  <text start="1621.79" dur="5.85">one of one-on-one so Comey could present</text>
  <text start="1624.13" dur="5.4">the quote salacious information in the</text>
  <text start="1627.64" dur="5.46">most discreet and least embarrassing way</text>
  <text start="1629.53" dur="5.94">at the same time we were told they did</text>
  <text start="1633.1" dur="4.38">not want the president-elect to perceive</text>
  <text start="1635.47" dur="3.96">a one-on-one briefing as an effort to</text>
  <text start="1637.48" dur="6.96">hold information over him like a Hoover</text>
  <text start="1639.43" dur="7.83">esque type of plot that may be fine but</text>
  <text start="1644.44" dur="4.95">listen to the next sentence witnesses</text>
  <text start="1647.26" dur="4.26">interviewed by the OIG also said that</text>
  <text start="1649.39" dur="3.86">they discuss Trump&amp;#39;s potential responses</text>
  <text start="1651.52" dur="4.11">to being told about the information</text>
  <text start="1653.25" dur="3.97">including that Trump might make</text>
  <text start="1655.63" dur="5.13">statements about or provide information</text>
  <text start="1657.22" dur="6.18">of value to the pending Russian</text>
  <text start="1660.76" dur="5.56">interference investigation in other</text>
  <text start="1663.4" dur="5.5">words it may make sense</text>
  <text start="1666.32" dur="4.71">for you to interview him alone because</text>
  <text start="1668.9" dur="3.83">he may say something we can use in our</text>
  <text start="1671.03" dur="6.15">other investigation</text>
  <text start="1672.73" dur="6.52">it gets worse than that they were</text>
  <text start="1677.18" dur="7.82">basically setting Trump up by informing</text>
  <text start="1679.25" dur="8.16">him about this multiple FBI witnesses</text>
  <text start="1685" dur="4.12">recalled agreeing ahead of time that</text>
  <text start="1687.41" dur="3.24">Comey should memorialize his meeting</text>
  <text start="1689.12" dur="3.96">with Trump immediately after it occurred</text>
  <text start="1690.65" dur="4.65">Comey told the IG that in his view it</text>
  <text start="1693.08" dur="4.53">was important for FBI executive managers</text>
  <text start="1695.3" dur="4.86">to be able to share in his recall of the</text>
  <text start="1697.61" dur="5.07">quote salient details of those</text>
  <text start="1700.16" dur="4.38">conversations Comey also said that an</text>
  <text start="1702.68" dur="3.96">additional concern shared by the members</text>
  <text start="1704.54" dur="3.81">of his management team was that if the</text>
  <text start="1706.64" dur="3.9">briefing briefing became a source of</text>
  <text start="1708.35" dur="5.61">controversy it would be important to</text>
  <text start="1710.54" dur="5.49">have a clear cont clear contemporaneous</text>
  <text start="1713.96" dur="3.63">record because Trump might miss reserve</text>
  <text start="1716.03" dur="6.69">list represents</text>
  <text start="1717.59" dur="6.93">I need to lower my air conditioning</text>

  <text start="1724.52" dur="4.04">to the wall standby</text>
  <text start="1734.789" dur="5.311">my apologies sorry about that</text>
  <text start="1741.24" dur="5.5">note that um in in this next section</text>
  <text start="1744.37" dur="5.25">Comey doesn&amp;#39;t create a memo about the</text>
  <text start="1746.74" dur="4.919">call he had with with Donald Trump where</text>
  <text start="1749.62" dur="8.76">he&amp;#39;s concerned about the media reports</text>
  <text start="1751.659" dur="11.031">of the dossier he engineered those media</text>
  <text start="1758.38" dur="6.87">leaks so if he would have had</text>
  <text start="1762.69" dur="5.41">memorialized Trump&amp;#39;s being worried about</text>
  <text start="1765.25" dur="5.1">them it wouldn&amp;#39;t have looked good for</text>
  <text start="1768.1" dur="5.039">the set of memos that he had created for</text>
  <text start="1770.35" dur="4.86">a very specific purpose and they talked</text>
  <text start="1773.139" dur="3.721">about that here Trump calls them and say</text>
  <text start="1775.21" dur="4.439">hey you know these leaks are pretty bad</text>
  <text start="1776.86" dur="4.26">we got to get a we got to get a we got</text>
  <text start="1779.649" dur="3.51">to get a handle on these things guys</text>
  <text start="1781.12" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;d better get our arms around this can</text>
  <text start="1783.159" dur="9.12">you please stop these leaks James Comey</text>
  <text start="1785.08" dur="9.829">at the FBI hmm again this has been in</text>
  <text start="1792.279" dur="5.13">the memos which we&amp;#39;ve gone off over</text>
  <text start="1794.909" dur="4.571">several times but it says a portion of</text>
  <text start="1797.409" dur="4.201">memo 2 summarizes a discussion between</text>
  <text start="1799.48" dur="4.679">Trump and Comey concerning the quote</text>
  <text start="1801.61" dur="3.9">salacious material and Trump wondering</text>
  <text start="1804.159" dur="3.061">whether he should ask Comey to</text>
  <text start="1805.51" dur="2.31">investigate the whole thing to prove it</text>
  <text start="1807.22" dur="2.73">was a lie</text>
  <text start="1807.82" dur="3.719">in other words Comey would you do me a</text>
  <text start="1809.95" dur="3.18">favor please investigate this damn</text>
  <text start="1811.539" dur="4.77">dossier because none of this stuff is</text>
  <text start="1813.13" dur="5.22">true especially not the fact that I went</text>
  <text start="1816.309" dur="5.511">to some hotel in Moscow and had people</text>
  <text start="1818.35" dur="6.47">pee on the same bed that Obama slept in</text>
  <text start="1821.82" dur="3">ok</text>
  <text start="1826.649" dur="6.78">why wouldn&amp;#39;t James Comey want to do that</text>
  <text start="1829.33" dur="6.209">why wouldn&amp;#39;t James Comey want to</text>
  <text start="1833.429" dur="5.951">investigate the dossier to make sure it</text>
  <text start="1835.539" dur="5.791">was true he says no no no no no mr.</text>
  <text start="1839.38" dur="3.87">president we don&amp;#39;t want to make the</text>

  <text start="1857.23" dur="6.24">Komi doesn&amp;#39;t leaked memo 3 because it</text>
  <text start="1860.75" dur="5.58">contains damning information for him and</text>
  <text start="1863.47" dur="8.709">others at the FBI regarding a FISA on</text>
  <text start="1866.33" dur="7.709">Flynn he considered it to be classified</text>

  <text start="1878.269" dur="4.951">the memo itself when he wrote it to</text>
  <text start="1880.639" dur="4.861">classify it he printed two originals</text>
  <text start="1883.22" dur="4.62">from an FBI printer and this is</text>
  <text start="1885.5" dur="4.919">important because sometimes he prints</text>
  <text start="1887.84" dur="5.85">them at home sometimes he prints them in</text>
  <text start="1890.419" dur="5.49">in the FBI sometimes he puts them in a</text>
  <text start="1893.69" dur="3.78">safe sometimes he it depends right it</text>
  <text start="1895.909" dur="5.671">all depends on what commis feeling like</text>
  <text start="1897.47" dur="7.02">that day so he prints two originals from</text>
  <text start="1901.58" dur="4.439">an FBI printer initials them list very</text>
  <text start="1904.49" dur="5.429">important here I want you to remember</text>
  <text start="1906.019" dur="8.28">this okay he keeps one original in his</text>
  <text start="1909.919" dur="7.081">desk at the FBI and gives the other</text>
  <text start="1914.299" dur="5.071">original to Ryba key with instructions</text>
  <text start="1917" dur="5.519">to show it to McCabe and Baker then take</text>
  <text start="1919.37" dur="5.309">it and keep it Comey tells the OIG other</text>
  <text start="1922.519" dur="4.53">than providing the original to Ryba key</text>
  <text start="1924.679" dur="4.62">to show mccabe and baker he did not give</text>
  <text start="1927.049" dur="4.561">it to anyone else he considered it to be</text>
  <text start="1929.299" dur="5.281">classified so he didn&amp;#39;t store it at home</text>

  <text start="1941.45" dur="4.559">was alarmed locked and approved for</text>
  <text start="1943.49" dur="6.23">quote open storage so he would never</text>
  <text start="1946.009" dur="6.061">have to put away classified information</text>
  <text start="1949.72" dur="3.73">this is important to remember for</text>
  <text start="1952.07" dur="6.329">several reasons which we&amp;#39;re gonna get to</text>
  <text start="1953.45" dur="6.449">very shortly but it&amp;#39;s very important he</text>

  <text start="2081.629" dur="7.891">I was never okay it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard to</text>
  <text start="2087.659" dur="4.321">explain this sessions did a lot of</text>

  <text start="2112.58" dur="7.83">not the right video not the right video</text>
  <text start="2117.41" dur="3">so</text>
  <text start="2123.48" dur="5.44">here he says Attorney General Sessions</text>
  <text start="2127.18" dur="3.8">will likely recuse himself from</text>
  <text start="2128.92" dur="5.129">involvement in the russia-related of</text>
  <text start="2130.98" dur="6">investigations and then the IG puts in</text>
  <text start="2134.049" dur="4.891">he did so two weeks later</text>
  <text start="2136.98" dur="4.629">actually that was Comey that wrote that</text>
  <text start="2138.94" dur="4.079">so in June Comey writes a statement to</text>
  <text start="2141.609" dur="3.031">the SSCI</text>
  <text start="2143.019" dur="4.201">and he says he discussed with the libra</text>
  <text start="2144.64" dur="5.31">leadership team at the FBI on his</text>
  <text start="2147.22" dur="4.74">February 14 2017 interaction with the</text>
  <text start="2149.95" dur="3.809">president he says he and the leadership</text>
  <text start="2151.96" dur="4.25">team decided not to report the</text>
  <text start="2153.759" dur="5.701">conversation to the AG or the DEA Jay</text>
  <text start="2156.21" dur="4.69">because sessions would likely recuse</text>
  <text start="2159.46" dur="4.109">himself from involvement in Russia</text>
  <text start="2160.9" dur="4.32">related investigations now I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2163.569" dur="2.911">how they knew that maybe it was common</text>
  <text start="2165.22" dur="3.599">sense saying well he was on the campaign</text>
  <text start="2166.48" dur="3.72">so he&amp;#39;ll after accuse himself maybe it</text>
  <text start="2168.819" dur="4.141">was because sessions had told some</text>
  <text start="2170.2" dur="5.399">people I I don&amp;#39;t know the president says</text>
  <text start="2172.96" dur="3.99">he didn&amp;#39;t know after discussing the</text>
  <text start="2175.599" dur="4.291">matter they decided to keep it very</text>
  <text start="2176.95" dur="4.889">closely held and not tell anyone but Jim</text>
  <text start="2179.89" dur="3.959">Comey knew two weeks before that he was</text>
  <text start="2181.839" dur="5.94">probably gonna do it so there&amp;#39;s more to</text>
  <text start="2183.849" dur="5.52">investigate they&amp;#39;re all Comey ever says</text>
  <text start="2187.779" dur="6.06">is that he wants to protect himself and</text>
  <text start="2189.369" dur="11.69">protect the FBI and it&amp;#39;s really annoying</text>
  <text start="2193.839" dur="9.72">because the FBI is not like some</text>
  <text start="2201.059" dur="4.24">separate government that operates above</text>
  <text start="2203.559" dur="6.901">the rest of the government it&amp;#39;s a part</text>
  <text start="2205.299" dur="7.621">of a branch of the executive so this</text>
  <text start="2210.46" dur="4.95">culture of like protecting the bureau</text>
  <text start="2212.92" dur="4.77">like even ray is guilty of is sick</text>
  <text start="2215.41" dur="3.839">enough is enough with that nonsense I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2217.69" dur="3.51">done with it I don&amp;#39;t want to hear anyone</text>
  <text start="2219.249" dur="4.381">say that they&amp;#39;re protecting the FBI ever</text>
  <text start="2221.2" dur="5.879">again clearly the people protecting the</text>
  <text start="2223.63" dur="5.729">FBI are not good people and they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="2403.91" dur="8.159">to official business translation of that</text>
  <text start="2407.72" dur="6.75">is basically we really shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2412.069" dur="4.05">doing this because it&amp;#39;s Shady so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2414.47" dur="3.3">gonna keep it a big secret because if we</text>

  <text start="2426.38" dur="3.209">that I called it regarding the dossier</text>

  <text start="2678.8" dur="4.32">world that there&amp;#39;s an investigation into</text>
  <text start="2680.33" dur="6.87">Flynn and so it basically like it kind</text>
  <text start="2683.12" dur="6.12">of its cuts down Jim Comey&amp;#39;s excuses</text>
  <text start="2687.2" dur="3.33">about why he leaked the memos it just</text>

  <text start="2916.41" dur="6.51">provides these memos to the IG hmm I</text>
  <text start="2920.959" dur="5.741">really think that pre step</text>

  <text start="2951" dur="4.079">is like again I&amp;#39;m gonna say this again</text>
  <text start="2952.89" dur="3.6">like one of the things that I think I</text>
  <text start="2955.079" dur="3.601">keep stressing a lot and I want people</text>
  <text start="2956.49" dur="3.69">to understand is why it is important for</text>
  <text start="2958.68" dur="3.3">the public to have this information and</text>
  <text start="2960.18" dur="4.26">why is it important for the public to</text>
  <text start="2961.98" dur="4.619">use this information to educate others</text>
  <text start="2964.44" dur="4.919">and why is it important for independent</text>
  <text start="2966.599" dur="4.95">media like epic times and uncover DC and</text>
  <text start="2969.359" dur="3.781">you know all of these other outlets to</text>
  <text start="2971.549" dur="3.331">report what we&amp;#39;re talking about here</text>
  <text start="2973.14" dur="3.6">because it spurs on congressional</text>
  <text start="2974.88" dur="4.409">investigations and when this stuff is</text>
  <text start="2976.74" dur="5.16">public guess what else it does it</text>
  <text start="2979.289" dur="4.951">removes leverage and these people have</text>
  <text start="2981.9" dur="4.29">literally zero loyalty to anybody about</text>
  <text start="2984.24" dur="4.079">themselves the only thing that keeps</text>
  <text start="2986.19" dur="4.02">them in line is what somebody else has</text>
  <text start="2988.319" dur="4.5">to hang over their head and when you</text>
  <text start="2990.21" dur="4.559">remove all of those things there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2992.819" dur="4.081">more leverage and everybody&amp;#39;s flailing</text>
  <text start="2994.769" dur="3.57">around like little bugs on their backs</text>
  <text start="2996.9" dur="5.49">trying to figure out how to save</text>
  <text start="2998.339" dur="5.821">themselves all of the FBI senior leaders</text>
  <text start="3002.39" dur="3.35">interviewed by the IG stated that the</text>
  <text start="3004.16" dur="4.619">memos were official government records</text>
  <text start="3005.74" dur="4.72">for example McCabe described the set of</text>
  <text start="3008.779" dur="3.06">memos as a record of commis official</text>
  <text start="3010.46" dur="3.72">engagement with the president that was</text>
  <text start="3011.839" dur="5.101">created as in his role as the FBI</text>
  <text start="3014.18" dur="5.099">director Baker told us they were</text>
  <text start="3016.94" dur="3.81">relevant to related to official business</text>
  <text start="3019.279" dur="2.401">and discussed in the office in</text>
  <text start="3020.75" dur="3.809">connection with official</text>
  <text start="3021.68" dur="5.7">responsibilities ryebeck he told the IG</text>
  <text start="3024.559" dur="4.681">that since commis removal he had treated</text>
  <text start="3027.38" dur="3.57">the memos as FBI records</text>
  <text start="3029.24" dur="3.869">he also said he could never remember</text>
  <text start="3030.95" dur="4.47">Comey indicating to him that he viewed</text>
  <text start="3033.109" dur="4.23">the memos as personal papers pre-snap</text>
  <text start="3035.42" dur="3.96">characterized the memos as documents</text>
  <text start="3037.339" dur="5.091">quote produced by the director in his</text>
  <text start="3039.38" dur="8.1">capacity as director FBI work product</text>
  <text start="3042.43" dur="7.27">they all flipped on Comey they threw</text>
  <text start="3047.48" dur="4.559">Comey onto the bus faster than you can</text>
  <text start="3049.7" dur="4.169">even blink in this one paragraph they</text>
  <text start="3052.039" dur="4.32">completely wiped their hands of Comey</text>
  <text start="3053.869" dur="2.741">right there who wants to be connected to</text>
  <text start="3056.359" dur="4.211">call</text>
  <text start="3056.61" dur="5.22">me anyone not me not me that&amp;#39;s personal</text>
  <text start="3060.57" dur="4.61">these were these were government</text>
  <text start="3061.83" dur="15.09">documents personal are you kidding me</text>
  <text start="3065.18" dur="14.25">that&amp;#39;s everybody at the FBI now this</text>
  <text start="3076.92" dur="5.76">part is interesting to me</text>
  <text start="3079.43" dur="4.57">so if Comey retained his group of</text>
  <text start="3082.68" dur="5.99">attorneys which it says in the report</text>
  <text start="3084" dur="4.67">very shortly after his termination and</text>
  <text start="3089.54" dur="3.52">then called me tells us that the article</text>
  <text start="3092.13" dur="2.82">in the New York Times</text>
  <text start="3093.06" dur="3.54">regarding the loyalty that that the</text>
  <text start="3094.95" dur="4.35">president supposedly requested from</text>
  <text start="3096.6" dur="3.18">Comey wasn&amp;#39;t sanctioned for a leak by</text>
  <text start="3099.3" dur="2.49">him</text>
  <text start="3099.78" dur="3.23">wouldn&amp;#39;t that be considered a breach of</text>
  <text start="3101.79" dur="4.35">attorney-client privilege</text>
  <text start="3103.01" dur="5.02">like Comey brings his attorneys on board</text>
  <text start="3106.14" dur="3.96">and then one of his attorneys leaks the</text>
  <text start="3108.03" dur="3.75">contents of a memo without commis</text>
  <text start="3110.1" dur="4.71">direction isn&amp;#39;t that a breach of</text>
  <text start="3111.78" dur="5.4">privilege I just that doesn&amp;#39;t make much</text>
  <text start="3114.81" dur="4.08">sense to me something&amp;#39;s off there like I</text>
  <text start="3117.18" dur="5.28">know Comey throughout this report says</text>
  <text start="3118.89" dur="5.4">that he&amp;#39;s not intending on on enforcing</text>
  <text start="3122.46" dur="7.65">like his privilege he&amp;#39;s not intending on</text>
  <text start="3124.29" dur="9.6">invoking privilege in his um in his you</text>
  <text start="3130.11" dur="6.93">know working with his attorneys all four</text>
  <text start="3133.89" dur="4.32">of them but Comey stated that Richman</text>

  <text start="3143.18" dur="6.64">then on the 12th after that comes out</text>
  <text start="3147.53" dur="4.06">President Trump released a tweet stating</text>
  <text start="3149.82" dur="3.93">Comey better hope there are no tapes of</text>
  <text start="3151.59" dur="5.64">the conversation I remember that day I</text>
  <text start="3153.75" dur="6">really do then like there&amp;#39;s this one</text>
  <text start="3157.23" dur="5.28">very dramatic part of the report where</text>
  <text start="3159.75" dur="13.17">James Comey says at 2:00 a.m. he shot up</text>
  <text start="3162.51" dur="15.03">in bed like oh my god my god I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3172.92" dur="6.63">believe this if he&amp;#39;s got tapes we need</text>

  <text start="3179.55" dur="6.23">what I&amp;#39;m saying is true enough enough</text>
  <text start="3190.03" dur="8.38">there is a whistleblower who had all of</text>
  <text start="3193.55" dur="6.809">the memos shortly after commis removal a</text>
  <text start="3198.41" dur="4.199">set of the seven memos was provided to</text>

  <text start="3450.02" dur="5.22">better go back and cover our tracks now</text>
  <text start="3452.079" dur="5.2">because otherwise we&amp;#39;ve got problems</text>
  <text start="3455.24" dur="4.349">and he had a nice conversation with</text>
  <text start="3457.279" dur="4.05">James Comey and they worked it all out</text>
  <text start="3459.589" dur="5.311">and then all of a sudden I&amp;#39;m right Bicky</text>

  <text start="3464.9" dur="4.649">I thought you only wanted what was</text>
  <text start="3466.67" dur="5.01">inside of his office not what the stuff</text>
  <text start="3469.549" dur="9.661">is that we have outside here that has to</text>
  <text start="3471.68" dur="9.179">do with him throughout this entire thing</text>
  <text start="3479.21" dur="4.05">call me states that the special counsel</text>
  <text start="3480.859" dur="6.93">he wants is to find out if there were</text>
  <text start="3483.26" dur="6.029">tapes into like he wanted to find out if</text>
  <text start="3487.789" dur="3.27">there were actually tapes of what he</text>
  <text start="3489.289" dur="5.78">said so we was trying to spur on a</text>
  <text start="3491.059" dur="4.01">special counsel to find these tapes</text>
  <text start="3496.76" dur="7.92">I think that&amp;#39;s bull did you why does he</text>
  <text start="3502.28" dur="5.64">care so much about tapes why does he</text>
  <text start="3504.68" dur="5.34">care so much about the tapes what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3507.92" dur="4.02">big deal if he haves tapes they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3510.02" dur="3.15">say both ends of the conversation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3511.94" dur="3.24">not like he&amp;#39;s gonna be able to be like</text>
  <text start="3513.17" dur="4.26">Trump&amp;#39;s gonna be like I have tapes and</text>
  <text start="3515.18" dur="7.29">they only have James Cole meet half of</text>
  <text start="3517.43" dur="6.21">the conversation it&amp;#39;s ridiculous now</text>
  <text start="3522.47" dur="3.68">this part of it</text>
  <text start="3523.64" dur="5.49">this is their excuse for everything</text>
  <text start="3526.15" dur="7.06">unfortunately their version of what our</text>
  <text start="3529.13" dur="6.57">country should look like is one where</text>
  <text start="3533.21" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s authoritarianism and socialism</text>
  <text start="3535.7" dur="4.8">and and it&amp;#39;s a dictatorship where</text>
  <text start="3538.01" dur="4.05">unelected bureaucrats run the show and</text>
  <text start="3540.5" dur="3.33">get to make decisions about what the</text>
  <text start="3542.06" dur="4.5">rest of us minions get to do with</text>
  <text start="3543.83" dur="7.41">ourselves that&amp;#39;s really not the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3546.56" dur="6.06">supposed to work Comey told us he needed</text>
  <text start="3551.24" dur="6.27">to do this because it was something he</text>
  <text start="3552.62" dur="7.11">which meaning leaked he was quote unit</text>
  <text start="3557.51" dur="4.86">uniquely situated to do because he was a</text>
  <text start="3559.73" dur="4.59">private citizen by speaking out or</text>
  <text start="3562.37" dur="5.03">enabling someone else to it would quote</text>
  <text start="3564.32" dur="5.07">change the game and create quote</text>
  <text start="3567.4" dur="5.68">extraordinary pressure on the leadership</text>
  <text start="3569.39" dur="5.67">of the DOJ which Comey did not trust to</text>
  <text start="3573.08" dur="6.96">appoint someone who the country could</text>
  <text start="3575.06" dur="6.57">trust to get the tapes when asked</text>
  <text start="3580.04" dur="2.7">whether he considered the disclosure of</text>
  <text start="3581.63" dur="4.62">this information would significantly</text>
  <text start="3582.74" dur="5.7">affect FBI equities he told the IG that</text>
  <text start="3586.25" dur="4.73">he would quote I would frame it</text>
  <text start="3588.44" dur="4.86">differently as an issue of quote</text>
  <text start="3590.98" dur="6.46">incredible importance to the nation as a</text>
  <text start="3593.3" dur="5.94">whole the tapes Comey said he took the</text>
  <text start="3597.44" dur="4.38">actions he took because quote he was</text>
  <text start="3599.24" dur="4.47">doing something I had to do if I love</text>
  <text start="3601.82" dur="5.72">this country and if I love the</text>
  <text start="3603.71" dur="3.83">Department of Justice and I love the FBI</text>
  <text start="3607.66" dur="5.47">just gonna it just makes more Navami</text>
  <text start="3611.05" dur="5.46">like who the hell do you think you are</text>
  <text start="3613.13" dur="3.38">dude you&amp;#39;re know what</text>
  <text start="3622.92" dur="4.899">there&amp;#39;s more but I don&amp;#39;t even want to</text>
  <text start="3625.089" dur="4.5">remember I don&amp;#39;t even want to read it so</text>
  <text start="3627.819" dur="3.03">we now know even by commis admission</text>
  <text start="3629.589" dur="3.811">that the president didn&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="3630.849" dur="4.531">there was an investigation into Flynn so</text>
  <text start="3633.4" dur="3.929">this is all nonsense this whole May</text>
  <text start="3635.38" dur="3.78">article is complete nonsense okay</text>
  <text start="3637.329" dur="4.891">doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything</text>
  <text start="3639.16" dur="8.879">he didn&amp;#39;t this is just political</text>
  <text start="3642.22" dur="8.49">posturing about please let Flynn Flynn</text>
  <text start="3648.039" dur="6.33">go this is this whole thing was a</text>
  <text start="3650.71" dur="5.909">political stunt by James Comey during</text>
  <text start="3654.369" dur="4.68">all of this during all of this next part</text>
  <text start="3656.619" dur="6.811">here I want you guys to remember that</text>
  <text start="3659.049" dur="7.111">that James Comey still has memos in his</text>
  <text start="3663.43" dur="8.06">safe at home personal memos that he has</text>
  <text start="3666.16" dur="11.1">not told anybody about this is during</text>
  <text start="3671.49" dur="8.049">2017 after that FBI the may 16th article</text>
  <text start="3677.26" dur="4.589">in The New York Times about Flynn is</text>
  <text start="3679.539" dur="4.651">published the FBI receives number a</text>
  <text start="3681.849" dur="5.361">number of congressional inquiries and</text>
  <text start="3684.19" dur="6.27">requests for copies of these memos in</text>
  <text start="3687.21" dur="6.79">the same time frame a lot of committees</text>
  <text start="3690.46" dur="6.48">are asking the Comey to come in and</text>
  <text start="3694" dur="5.46">testify and Comey says that he agreed to</text>
  <text start="3696.94" dur="4.23">testify and he told the FBI about it and</text>
  <text start="3699.46" dur="4.52">the hearing was scheduled for June 8th</text>
  <text start="3701.17" dur="5.609">2017 I remember it like it was yesterday</text>
  <text start="3703.98" dur="4.78">unfortunately because the hearing would</text>
  <text start="3706.779" dur="3.54">be open the FBI needed to make a clear</text>
  <text start="3708.76" dur="3.21">determination whether there was any</text>
  <text start="3710.319" dur="4.891">classified information in the memos</text>
  <text start="3711.97" dur="5.819">before he testified and Comey requested</text>
  <text start="3715.21" dur="4.379">that the FBI allow him to review the</text>
  <text start="3717.789" dur="3.961">memos prior to the hearing so he could</text>
  <text start="3719.589" dur="6.301">prepare a written statement and refresh</text>
  <text start="3721.75" dur="7.74">his recollection he has them all he has</text>

  <text start="3732.7" dur="3.99">them to him at his home stand there and</text>
  <text start="3734.89" dur="5.81">watch him read them on his back porch</text>
  <text start="3736.69" dur="4.01">and then hand them back</text>
  <text start="3747.799" dur="5.711">here they state that they relied on</text>
  <text start="3750.329" dur="4.29">their classification experience from the</text>
  <text start="3753.51" dur="2.64">Clinton email case to make</text>
  <text start="3754.619" dur="3.75">determinations on what the memos were</text>
  <text start="3756.15" dur="3.899">like what I mean what what</text>
  <text start="3758.369" dur="3.301">classifications need to go into these</text>
  <text start="3760.049" dur="4.081">memos so just to give you a quick</text>
  <text start="3761.67" dur="4.439">timeline refresh Comey gets fired</text>
  <text start="3764.13" dur="4.59">he&amp;#39;s already stored all these quote</text>

  <text start="3815.97" dur="3.66">these people are requesting these memos</text>
  <text start="3817.41" dur="4.47">so they go and they the small group sits</text>

  <text start="3916.11" dur="4.25">not the director or former director</text>
  <text start="3921.08" dur="9.37">really gross as the group deliberated</text>
  <text start="3928.98" dur="2.97">how much they wanted to protect Comey in</text>
  <text start="3930.45" dur="3.03">terms of classification they also</text>

  <text start="3936" dur="3.42">all when they were sitting in there</text>

  <text start="3946.53" dur="4.29">all that stuff because it&amp;#39;s a huge story</text>
  <text start="3948.68" dur="3.64">and then I started to talk about Paige</text>

  <text start="3965.21" dur="14.77">Robert Muller asked for personal memos</text>
  <text start="3967.89" dur="14.46">that oh here we go this one now nobody</text>
  <text start="3979.98" dur="4.47">at the FBI knew that James Comey had</text>
  <text start="3982.35" dur="5.85">these memos in his safe nobody knew</text>
  <text start="3984.45" dur="6.72">about it they figured it out when they</text>
  <text start="3988.2" dur="5.91">sat down to watch him testify on</text>
  <text start="3991.17" dur="9">television and then they were like oh my</text>
  <text start="3994.11" dur="8.04">god no I&amp;#39;m wrong they figured out that</text>
  <text start="4000.17" dur="4.74">he had given the memos to his attorneys</text>
  <text start="4002.15" dur="5.04">when they watched television and saw him</text>
  <text start="4004.91" dur="3.96">testifying and then they ran to the</text>
  <text start="4007.19" dur="2.49">attorney and they were like whoa dude</text>
  <text start="4008.87" dur="6.06">you&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="4009.68" dur="7.95">memos or a memo and as a matter of fact</text>
  <text start="4014.93" dur="4.05">even in here call me remarks like they</text>
  <text start="4017.63" dur="2.82">asked him why didn&amp;#39;t you tell them about</text>
  <text start="4018.98" dur="3.629">the rest of the memos that you had given</text>
  <text start="4020.45" dur="4.83">to people and he goes well they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4022.609" dur="4.171">ask they didn&amp;#39;t ask it&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="4025.28" dur="7.11">questions in these hearings are so</text>
  <text start="4026.78" dur="7.26">important the SSA told the IO IG that</text>
  <text start="4032.39" dur="3.419">call me didn&amp;#39;t indicate that he had</text>
  <text start="4034.04" dur="3.45">shared the memos outs with anyone</text>
  <text start="4035.809" dur="3.361">outside of the FBI or that there may be</text>
  <text start="4037.49" dur="4.47">an unauthorized disclosure of classified</text>
  <text start="4039.17" dur="5.25">information the special supervisor</text>
  <text start="4041.96" dur="4.109">Supervisory Special Agent also said the</text>
  <text start="4044.42" dur="3.03">Comey didn&amp;#39;t indicate that he considered</text>
  <text start="4046.069" dur="3.601">the memos to be his personal property</text>
  <text start="4047.45" dur="3.99">when asked whether the FBI&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4049.67" dur="3.87">classification markings raised any</text>
  <text start="4051.44" dur="4.95">concerns for Col me about his storage</text>
  <text start="4053.54" dur="6.42">and transmission of the memos Comey said</text>
  <text start="4056.39" dur="5.07">sure yeah two things ran through my mind</text>
  <text start="4059.96" dur="2.849">immediately it&amp;#39;s like could I be wrong</text>
  <text start="4061.46" dur="3.81">which is something I&amp;#39;m always trying to</text>
  <text start="4062.809" dur="3.51">ask myself and if they&amp;#39;re classified</text>
  <text start="4065.27" dur="2.67">what are the implications for that</text>
  <text start="4066.319" dur="3.99">because I stored and transmitted yeah</text>
  <text start="4067.94" dur="3.78">Comey told the idea that he understood</text>
  <text start="4070.309" dur="2.941">the FBI would likely conduct an</text>
  <text start="4071.72" dur="2.82">investigation concerning the</text>
  <text start="4073.25" dur="3.48">unauthorized disclosure of classified</text>
  <text start="4074.54" dur="4.85">information and he thought that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4076.73" dur="5.22">totally reasonable</text>
  <text start="4079.39" dur="5.469">however Comey told the IG that he</text>
  <text start="4081.95" dur="5.52">voluntarily gave his signed originals of</text>
  <text start="4084.859" dur="5.041">memos two four six and seven to the SSA</text>
  <text start="4087.47" dur="3.899">at his house that day not because he had</text>
  <text start="4089.9" dur="4.439">concerns they contained classified</text>
  <text start="4091.369" dur="11.43">information but because quote Special</text>
  <text start="4094.339" dur="11.52">Counsel Robert Muller asked for them how</text>
  <text start="4102.799" dur="5.79">did he know about them nobody knew about</text>
  <text start="4105.859" dur="6.181">these personal memos that he kept in his</text>
  <text start="4108.589" dur="6.201">safe nobody knew about them but Muller</text>
  <text start="4112.04" dur="5.46">did how didn&amp;#39;t Muller know about them</text>

  <text start="4117.5" dur="6.12">another time I have to take this and go</text>
  <text start="4121.339" dur="4.531">into the the Muller report and try and</text>
  <text start="4123.62" dur="4.98">look in the footnotes for when Jim Comey</text>
  <text start="4125.87" dur="8.369">spoke to when the 302 for James Comey</text>
  <text start="4128.6" dur="9.9">was task somebody figure out when the</text>
