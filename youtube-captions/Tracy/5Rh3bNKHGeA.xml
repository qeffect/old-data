  <text start="0.03" dur="6.36">hey guys so WikiLeaks 23 is out and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4.29" dur="6.09">going through and I had to stop to make</text>
  <text start="6.39" dur="6.3">this video because I do have several</text>
  <text start="10.38" dur="4.169">emails to go over with you but this one</text>
  <text start="12.69" dur="5.94">just really struck me to the core this</text>
  <text start="14.549" dur="6.301">this guy Brent Podolski has been</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="7.8">peppered through giving the most sane</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="11.159">albeit sort of skewed advice because he</text>
  <text start="26.43" dur="7.26">is a liberal to Podesta and others on</text>
  <text start="32.009" dur="3.421">Clinton staff from the very beginning of</text>
  <text start="33.69" dur="5.79">these dumps he&amp;#39;s been reaching out and</text>
  <text start="35.43" dur="7.559">he writes for the hill the progressive</text>
  <text start="39.48" dur="7.13">House Pilat of power he is intermingled</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="6.361">with tons of really important people and</text>
  <text start="46.61" dur="4.719">I&amp;#39;m gonna read this we got at the</text>
  <text start="49.35" dur="3.84">beginning of this I believe in a</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="4.681">previous dump but I&amp;#39;m literally gonna</text>
  <text start="53.19" dur="5.389">read this entire email almost verbatim</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="9.329">I&amp;#39;ll summarize a little bit because this</text>
  <text start="58.579" dur="10.481">who okay mm-hmm on September 8th he</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="5.07">wrote to Podesta I have no comment about</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="3.09">today&amp;#39;s New York Times story about the</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="4.051">new Hillary being discussed as the new</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="4.35">Koch just assume the worst about my view</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="4.199">and multiply times to I&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="76.5" dur="3.659">write about the following soon and I</text>
  <text start="78.659" dur="4.35">need to add in here personally this is</text>
  <text start="80.159" dur="6.121">Tracy speaking that he threatens to do</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="3.93">this quite a lot I&amp;#39;m not sure that he</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="3.42">always does</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="3.961">but anyway why has Bill Clinton been the</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="3.09">Invisible Man for Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="4.079">campaigns in the last six weeks I can</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="4.68">only think of two possible explanations</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="4.441">which are first that bill does not fully</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="4.89">believe in Hillary&amp;#39;s candidacy all are</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="4.83">tenets or alternatively that her staff</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="4.049">does not believe a more visible Bill</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="3.81">Clinton would be helpful to her which I</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="4.771">would consider campaign management</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="5.879">malpractice well I mean I would disagree</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="4.229">with him personally but okay from bills</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="3.151">vantage point one would like to think</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="3.121">that nothing is more important to him</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="2.94">than spending every waking hour trying</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="3.689">to make his wife the next president and</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="4.199">from Hillary&amp;#39;s vantage point in an age</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="4.141">where virtually all political insiders</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="5.28">have negative ratings comparable to the</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="4.73">bird flu bill remains a towering figure</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="4.241">of popularity and presidential</text>
  <text start="131.09" dur="5.21">credibility why is he hiding or</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="6.51">hidden closed door money solicitations</text>
  <text start="136.3" dur="5.52">do not count regarding the time story</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="2.67">how about the campaign telling voters in</text>
  <text start="141.82" dur="2.85">media that she believes in something</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="3.15">more powerful inspirational and</text>
  <text start="144.67" dur="4.5">visionary than what television</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="5.15">interviews she plans to him appear on to</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="5.85">improve her negative trust ratings and</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="5.59">Podesta writes back plan has been from</text>
  <text start="155.02" dur="3.42">the beginning to start using him in the</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="3.15">late fall that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="3.78">both wanted and still want and I think</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="3.96">that sound chelsea starts her book tour</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="3.42">on september 15th which runs through</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="3.12">early november then she&amp;#39;ll be out more</text>
  <text start="165.64" dur="3.48">to although she will certainly get</text>
  <text start="167.05" dur="3.75">questions on the book tour don&amp;#39;t get me</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="3.03">started on the new york times story in</text>
  <text start="170.8" dur="6.98">other words i was frustrated about it</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="12.36">too now he writes back a novel and it is</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="9.85">blistering so here we go late fall is</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="5.43">much too late bill should have begun</text>
  <text start="187.63" dur="4.47">early summer in stages a periodic but</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="4.59">reinforcing present escalating late fall</text>
  <text start="192.1" dur="3.99">not beginning late fall if it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="3.48">important enough for him to do compared</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="4.709">to other things he&amp;#39;s doing shame on him</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="5.46">if it was a staff generated plan shame</text>
  <text start="200.799" dur="4.5">on them high probability i write a very</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="3.239">strong column very soon about these</text>
  <text start="205.299" dur="3.901">things i have been very aggressive</text>
  <text start="206.709" dur="4.681">defending her and avoiding any criticism</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="4.53">while she was under attack but this is</text>
  <text start="211.39" dur="4.2">now going very wrong and when I read the</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="4.77">New York Times story that we confirms my</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="5.34">view never publicly stated that some of</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="4.5">the people around her not you but others</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="3.75">are dumber than bird when it comes</text>
  <text start="223" dur="4.98">to modern public opinion in modern</text>
  <text start="224.68" dur="5.25">politics I will tell you I was an early</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="3.69">Obama supporter in oh seven and oh eight</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="3.39">which was a mistake but I was in the</text>
  <text start="231.67" dur="3.69">inner loop going in meetings with Kerry</text>
  <text start="233.32" dur="4.229">sitting on my right and Tom Daschle on</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="4.59">my left and exchanging ideas with the</text>
  <text start="237.549" dur="5.071">top Obama people and DC and Chicago by</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="4.259">speakerphone they had then and carried</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="3.81">with them into the White House an</text>
  <text start="244.209" dur="4.921">unbridled contempt for Bill and Hillary</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="5.19">Clinton some of them who are now visible</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="4.53">for Hillary said or wrote things to me</text>
  <text start="251.62" dur="3.81">when I suggested possible contributions</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="4.259">by one of the Clintons that were so</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="3.989">dripping with contempt that I told them</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="3.06">that if they ever do that again in my</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="3.991">presence I would treat it as on the</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="3.681">record write it and name them that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="3.23">bad it was</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="4.02">there are some people now working for</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="3.57">her who consider her a profit center for</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="3.36">their income and not a cause or a</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="3.69">mission that they believe in they almost</text>
  <text start="272.04" dur="4.2">certainly carry with them an incredible</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="4.86">jealousy that Obama has always harbored</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="4.43">towards Bill Clinton and a condescending</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="4.17">attitude towards Hillary Clinton that</text>
  <text start="280.67" dur="4.27">attitude shines through The Times story</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="6.57">today that treats her a commodity to be</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="6.75">sold and not a leader of the nation it</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="4.71">treats her as a calculating tactician</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="4.95">who is changing her maneuvers about how</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="5.01">to sell herself to manipulate voters and</text>
  <text start="296.64" dur="5.19">not as a putative president with a heart</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="5.13">and a soul and a passion about why she</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="5.97">wants to be President and what she would</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="6.54">do if she is an inauthentic strategy to</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="5.31">make her look authentic is absurd this</text>
  <text start="310.89" dur="5.85">guy knows what he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="5.34">and by the way Biden&amp;#39;s populist act on</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="3.51">Labor Day with his rhetoric of being</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="4.23">indignant about the unfairness of the</text>
  <text start="320.25" dur="4.5">economy makes a mockery of his four</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="4.05">decades of carrying water for banks of</text>
  <text start="324.75" dur="4.29">their de facto lobbyists in the Senate</text>
  <text start="326.73" dur="4.41">from Delaware he won&amp;#39;t take one vote</text>
  <text start="329.04" dur="3.45">from Bernie when people focus is the</text>
  <text start="331.14" dur="2.88">best thing that could happen to Bernie</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="3.33">and will come in third behind Hillary</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="4.02">and Bernie taking votes from Hillary</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="4.65">that will give Bernie&amp;#39;s percentage more</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="4.26">delegates and clout the solution for</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="4.14">Hillary to be more authentically</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="4.89">populist not as far as Bernie but so</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="4.59">much more so than she has been and give</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="4.56">her candidacy some heart and soul and</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="6.03">bite that is not her nature and not her</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="5.52">staffs which may be her undoing I could</text>
  <text start="355.23" dur="3.66">write a column listing one by one the</text>
  <text start="357.27" dur="3.39">corporate clients of many of Hillary&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="4.68">closest advisors and dem and many</text>

  <text start="406.81" dur="4.05">in 2016 I beg to differ but this guy&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="409.54" dur="3.87">liberal so he&amp;#39;s biased</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="4.16">he gives the closest indicator of the</text>

  <text start="415.02" dur="6.1">completely wrong which is a huge plus</text>
  <text start="418.42" dur="4.17">and on selected populist issues where</text>
  <text start="421.12" dur="4.68">she could distinguish herself that would</text>
  <text start="422.59" dur="5.13">be a big plus to instead all we watch is</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="3.48">a tactical discussion about why she is</text>
  <text start="427.72" dur="4.2">not doing well because of how much she</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="4.65">has distrusted by voters and suggestions</text>
  <text start="431.92" dur="2.97">she is dispatching surrogate politicians</text>
