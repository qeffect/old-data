  <text start="164.519" dur="8.94">year this november 19th of last year was</text>

  <text start="185.25" dur="8.01">pleasant one but this has been a two and</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="6.419">a half year stretch of reading about FBI</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="4.86">raids on offices or coordinated raids</text>
  <text start="196.109" dur="3.571">with the media on people&amp;#39;s private</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="5.339">residences at five o&amp;#39;clock in the</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="7.35">morning and it seems to have been very</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="5.701">very normal normal stuff but being the</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="3.45">subject of one of those raids you know</text>
  <text start="209.16" dur="4.02">can you give us a little bit of</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="3.69">perspective on on that experience right</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="4.139">there what&amp;#39;s going through your mind</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="4.98">especially since you had been going</text>
  <text start="217.319" dur="3.871">through all all proper whistleblower</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="5.309">channels to bring all this to light</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="4.74">correct yes okay so don&amp;#39;t throw all the</text>
  <text start="224.459" dur="2.641">channels you were going through tell us</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="4.23">what&amp;#39;s going through your mind the day</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="4.7">that this this violent incursion is</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="4.67">going on</text>
  <text start="231.8" dur="5.96">well let me let me preface in this whole</text>
  <text start="234.83" dur="6.66">thing with just a couple of statements</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="6.1">so I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of distrust</text>
  <text start="241.49" dur="3.78">right now for government and a lot of</text>
  <text start="243.86" dur="2.52">people are upset and angry and</text>
  <text start="245.27" dur="4.23">rightfully so</text>
  <text start="246.38" dur="4.53">at the FBI but there&amp;#39;s a lot of good</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="4.59">people that are out there there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="250.91" dur="5.6">of good people in the agency do you know</text>
  <text start="254.09" dur="5.34">very very important things you know for</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="6.31">you know for us they&amp;#39;re out there you</text>
  <text start="259.43" dur="6.63">know catching you know these pedophile</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="5.7">rings are out there you know catch an</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.78">ms-13 and these you know criminals that</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="3.66">are coming across the you know the</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="3.66">border with drugs and they do a lot of</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="3.87">important work and there&amp;#39;s a lot of good</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="3.99">people there and through this whole</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="4.83">experience I&amp;#39;ve actually got to meet a</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="6.87">couple of them you know one other one</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="5.52">who was a whistleblower who ended up you</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="5.55">know having problems of her own</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="5.88">robbing grits and you know so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="5.61">want this at all to be like defamatory</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="5.28">you know towards the bureau and I think</text>
  <text start="295.52" dur="4.56">that they play an important role but</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s clearly some issues up at the</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="4.86">top and you know some of that has been</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="4.65">dealt with you know people have been</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="4.59">fired I&amp;#39;m praying and hoping that</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="4.77">eventually certain individuals will be</text>
  <text start="309.53" dur="4.68">prosecuted and so what I&amp;#39;m about to</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="6.21">share with you is going to kind of</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="6.57">reveal the basis of the complaint that I</text>
  <text start="318.29" dur="5.28">made and the circumstances that</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="6.15">surrounded it and kind of provided me an</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="4.62">opportunity to also clear some up some</text>
  <text start="326.93" dur="2.7">things up that questions that people</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="3.09">have had that you know of course I</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="7.5">haven&amp;#39;t felt comfortable answering until</text>
  <text start="331.28" dur="10.11">now so so I&amp;#39;ll start with that so when I</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="7.53">when I blew the whistle I knew that the</text>
  <text start="341.39" dur="5.52">likelihood of their coming a day when my</text>
  <text start="344.66" dur="5.55">home you know would be raided was</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="6.42">potentially high so I went into this</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="6.27">knowing that I I knew that you know</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="5.97">there could be reprisal I knew that I</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="5.1">could lose my job I you know I had to</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="3.19">make those decisions consciously in to</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="3.67">count the cost</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="6.39">before doing this I have a family and</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="7.669">I&amp;#39;m the sole provider for and so this</text>
  <text start="368.88" dur="8.789">was an extremely scary thing to do and</text>
  <text start="372.919" dur="10.361">very stressful last few years I would</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="6.661">say so the kind of toys I&amp;#39;ll start with</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="3.12">the raid and then I&amp;#39;ll kind of work</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="3.959">backwards and talk about like what led</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="4.739">up to it or what led up to my</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="7.201">whistleblowing so that on the day array</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="7.68">I had already left the FBI and right</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="6.09">after I blew the whistle you know I I</text>
  <text start="398.819" dur="6.451">left I didn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable or safe</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="7.5">being in there so I ended up leaving and</text>
  <text start="405.27" dur="6.48">and I got a job with a with a as was a</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="7.019">contractor had a contract with the VA</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="7.47">and it was a really great job it gave me</text>
  <text start="416.099" dur="4.861">an opportunity to work from home the</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="3.24">people that I worked with were awesome</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="5.73">the company that I worked with was a</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="7.199">great company and and I loved it and but</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="5.52">it allowed me to work from home 24/7</text>
  <text start="429.659" dur="4.861">well 24/7 365 days a year</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="4.47">and I only had to go in I think like</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="5.16">twice a year and what I do is cyber</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="4.68">security related work so because their</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="3.93">network wasn&amp;#39;t classified I was able to</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="7.619">do what I needed to do remotely which</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="8.609">was you know bright but so my office</text>
  <text start="448.979" dur="6.571">sits on the you know on the second story</text>
  <text start="452.219" dur="6.361">of my house and I have a view directly</text>
  <text start="455.55" dur="4.47">down my driveway and I have a very long</text>
  <text start="458.58" dur="4.889">driveway I live kind of out in the</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="6.36">country and which incidentally is kind</text>
  <text start="463.469" dur="6.211">of you know when you work for the FBI</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="5.159">and you read all of these you know these</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="3.78">reports that they send to you about all</text>
  <text start="471.539" dur="4.261">the terrorist activity around the you</text>
  <text start="473.46" dur="3.41">know the u.s. the last place you want to</text>
  <text start="475.8" dur="3.63">live in the city</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="6.88">so I kind of chose this place you know</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="6.75">out here because you know I felt safe</text>
  <text start="483.75" dur="4.05">out here it felt like a place where I</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="4.409">could kind of retreat to get away from</text>
  <text start="487.8" dur="4.739">you know all the stress but sitting in</text>
  <text start="490.589" dur="3.291">my office looking down you know my</text>
  <text start="492.539" dur="4.521">driveway</text>
  <text start="493.88" dur="4.86">I saw a car you know come down and it</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="4.68">was just kind of like a plain old white</text>
  <text start="498.74" dur="6">sedan so I knew like right off the bat</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="6.42">I&amp;#39;m like oh this is not good and I saw</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="5.88">three people get out you know - two men</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="4.71">and and I think one of them was a woman</text>
  <text start="510.62" dur="6.51">and there was you know they had like</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="7.83">very clean-cut you know FBI regulation</text>
  <text start="517.13" dur="5.34">haircuts so I knew like the moment they</text>
  <text start="520.7" dur="4.08">stepped out of the car I was looking</text>
  <text start="522.47" dur="4.59">down I knew I&amp;#39;m like oh shit</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="5.76">you know this is the day you know this</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="5.04">is this is happening and so I went</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="5.13">downstairs so they knocked on the door</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="5.1">it was not you know when new stories</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="3.51">come out and especially when a new story</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="4.41">comes out secondhand there&amp;#39;s some facts</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="5.79">I get you know that that come out wrong</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="4.65">and and that&amp;#39;s just the way it is the</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="5.82">story of the original story that came</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="7.17">out was was my lawyer sharing the the</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="7.89">you know the the information I related</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="8.64">to him to you know to a reporter and you</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="5.25">know and that was you know so wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="3.33">directly from me so there wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="4.32">really you know a chance for me to kind</text>
  <text start="565.4" dur="4.47">of clarify things but you know it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="568.25" dur="3.57">like they didn&amp;#39;t come in here guns</text>
  <text start="569.87" dur="3.84">blazing they didn&amp;#39;t you know kick down</text>
  <text start="571.82" dur="5.16">my door or you know anything like that</text>
  <text start="573.71" dur="6.78">thank God it was definitely not a Roger</text>
  <text start="576.98" dur="5.37">stone you know type raid and so I want</text>
  <text start="580.49" dur="3.63">to clarify that you know cuz a lot of</text>
  <text start="582.35" dur="4.62">people I think suspect that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="6.69">not the case three people show that they</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="5.34">knocked at the door I open the door you</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="4.11">know they asked if they could come in</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="4.5">and speak with me and and you know and</text>
  <text start="594.92" dur="5.7">they told me they were with the FBI I</text>
  <text start="596.81" dur="6.39">asked to see the badges and they show</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="5.66">their badges so I let him in and we went</text>
  <text start="603.2" dur="7.62">in the living room and we sat down and</text>
  <text start="606.28" dur="6.72">you know the guy leading the special</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="5.19">agent-in-charge basically said he said</text>
  <text start="613" dur="5.17">you know I I&amp;#39;m just gonna cut to the</text>
  <text start="616.01" dur="5.04">chase we&amp;#39;re here about a missing thumb</text>
  <text start="618.17" dur="6.11">drive and I knew I knew what they were</text>
  <text start="621.05" dur="6.12">here about and so I immediately you know</text>
  <text start="624.28" dur="6.97">you know basically said yeah it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="627.17" dur="6.9">I took a thumb drive and the reason why</text>
  <text start="631.25" dur="5.279">I did is because I&amp;#39;m a protective</text>
  <text start="634.07" dur="4.199">whistleblower under the intelligence</text>
  <text start="636.529" dur="4.591">community Whistleblower Protection Act</text>

  <text start="641.12" dur="5.58">know the story of you know what you know</text>
  <text start="644.779" dur="6.391">what I what I did and why I did it</text>
  <text start="646.7" dur="6.389">and you know it was I&amp;#39;m sure my lawyer</text>
  <text start="651.17" dur="4.229">was furious with me later because you</text>
  <text start="653.089" dur="4.591">guys they say don&amp;#39;t ever say anything</text>
  <text start="655.399" dur="6.93">without your legal representation</text>

  <text start="701.81" dur="3.089">know they they and they asked me several</text>
  <text start="703.279" dur="4.201">questions you know they asked me if I</text>
  <text start="704.899" dur="4.771">had you know given that information you</text>
  <text start="707.48" dur="3.84">know to any foreign nationals which of</text>
  <text start="709.67" dur="4.77">course the answer is no they asked me if</text>
  <text start="711.32" dur="6.42">I sold the information I said no you</text>
  <text start="714.44" dur="5.7">know they they asked me you know a whole</text>
  <text start="717.74" dur="3.959">lot of questions and I answered them to</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="3.689">the best of my ability but to be honest</text>
  <text start="721.699" dur="3.961">with you you&amp;#39;re sitting on a couch and</text>
  <text start="723.829" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;ve got three agents sitting across</text>
  <text start="725.66" dur="5.789">from you and you know they&amp;#39;ve got guns</text>
  <text start="727.699" dur="7.561">and you know it&amp;#39;s very intimidating to</text>
  <text start="731.449" dur="6.211">say the least and you know so and you</text>
  <text start="735.26" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t you know of course you guys know</text>
  <text start="737.66" dur="5.88">that the information that I blew the</text>
  <text start="740.75" dur="5.19">whistle on was related to Hillary</text>
  <text start="743.54" dur="5.13">Clinton and the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="745.94" dur="6.089">uranium one and there was other things</text>
  <text start="748.67" dur="5.039">too that it was related to as well some</text>
  <text start="752.029" dur="3.571">of that I can talk about if it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="753.709" dur="4.471">generalized some of it I can&amp;#39;t get into</text>
  <text start="755.6" dur="4.83">it all because nearly everything that</text>
  <text start="758.18" dur="8.67">that I hand it over</text>
  <text start="760.43" dur="9.09">the IG was classified so but but anyway</text>
  <text start="766.85" dur="3.72">so they they asked these questions you</text>
  <text start="769.52" dur="4.05">know I answered in the best of my</text>
  <text start="770.57" dur="6.48">ability and then and I thought that was</text>
  <text start="773.57" dur="4.98">you know gonna be it I had this nagging</text>
  <text start="777.05" dur="3.599">suspicion in the background that they</text>
  <text start="778.55" dur="3.3">had a search warrant and but I had hoped</text>
  <text start="780.649" dur="3.091">that you know by telling my</text>
  <text start="781.85" dur="2.97">whistleblower that that might delay</text>
  <text start="783.74" dur="2.88">things or at least give me an</text>
  <text start="784.82" dur="3.72">opportunity to call my lawyer and all</text>
  <text start="786.62" dur="4.17">that and you know as soon as they</text>
  <text start="788.54" dur="4.2">finished asking their questions he pulls</text>
  <text start="790.79" dur="3.299">out a search warrant says well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="792.74" dur="4.469">here we have a search warrant we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.089" dur="6.961">gonna search your house and and then you</text>
  <text start="797.209" dur="6.271">know several other agents entered my</text>
  <text start="801.05" dur="4.38">house and came down my driveway so they</text>
  <text start="803.48" dur="3.75">must have been parked around the corner</text>
  <text start="805.43" dur="5.159">or something and I think I&amp;#39;m told it was</text>
  <text start="807.23" dur="5.7">around 19 agents I have a neighbor who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="810.589" dur="7.111">always kind of can see my house from up</text>
  <text start="812.93" dur="5.94">on the hill and she was kind of you know</text>
  <text start="817.7" dur="2.579">she&amp;#39;s always kind of sitting by our</text>
  <text start="818.87" dur="2.37">window and so she was counting them as</text>
  <text start="820.279" dur="3.601">they were coming and that&amp;#39;s how I know</text>
  <text start="821.24" dur="6.03">how many there were because she told me</text>
  <text start="823.88" dur="4.98">later but like my drive was really long</text>
  <text start="827.27" dur="5.09">and it was packed full of cars it looked</text>
  <text start="828.86" dur="10.22">like we were having a party here and so</text>
  <text start="832.36" dur="11.95">but they they all came in there was a I</text>
  <text start="839.08" dur="9.25">was basically forced to sit on my couch</text>
  <text start="844.31" dur="8.36">while they searched every room of my</text>
  <text start="848.33" dur="7.83">house my property my barn my garage my</text>
  <text start="852.67" dur="8.289">you know not just my room and office but</text>
  <text start="856.16" dur="7.38">my my children&amp;#39;s rooms you know they</text>
  <text start="860.959" dur="5.311">they went through everything I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="5.52">tell you prior to this I don&amp;#39;t think I</text>
  <text start="866.27" dur="6.36">ever you know realized how that kind of</text>
  <text start="869.06" dur="6.649">experience is but for having gone</text>
  <text start="872.63" dur="5.34">through it it&amp;#39;s a very violating feeling</text>
  <text start="875.709" dur="4.75">because I couldn&amp;#39;t even be there to see</text>
  <text start="877.97" dur="3.809">what they&amp;#39;re looking at and then once</text>
  <text start="880.459" dur="3">they wanted to search the liver and they</text>
  <text start="881.779" dur="5.37">moved me upstairs so that I couldn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="883.459" dur="8.271">them searching you know the the living</text>
  <text start="887.149" dur="7.581">room and you know but it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="891.73" dur="5.65">you know you you think about</text>
  <text start="894.73" dur="6.04">you know everything that is personal to</text>

  <text start="900.77" dur="6.08">your your private space they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="903.74" dur="6.72">through there they&amp;#39;re looking at my wife</text>

  <text start="910.46" dur="5.15">and you know I&amp;#39;ve never even looked at</text>
  <text start="913.58" dur="6.36">them because they&amp;#39;re hers you know and</text>
  <text start="915.61" dur="6.25">FBI was going through these things so it</text>
  <text start="919.94" dur="6.47">was not just a feeling of being violated</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="6.42">to me personally but but also to</text>
  <text start="926.41" dur="3.88">everybody else in my family</text>
  <text start="928.28" dur="5.07">excuse me if I get a little choked up</text>

  <text start="997.76" dur="3.42">autistic</text>
  <text start="998.39" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s high-functioning autistic but he he</text>
  <text start="1001.18" dur="4.74">notices things that most people would</text>
  <text start="1003.19" dur="6.78">never noticed he noticed that these</text>
  <text start="1005.92" dur="6.6">agents you know had guns and holsters he</text>
  <text start="1009.97" dur="5.58">noticed that their holsters had the</text>
  <text start="1012.52" dur="6.24">buttons unsnapped on him and he noticed</text>
  <text start="1015.55" dur="5.82">you know a couple of them had safeties</text>
  <text start="1018.76" dur="4.5">off you know at least in I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1021.37" dur="2.48">that&amp;#39;s accurate if that&amp;#39;s his mind you</text>
  <text start="1023.26" dur="3.199">know imagine</text>
  <text start="1023.85" dur="6.66">things but but that&amp;#39;s how he perceived</text>
  <text start="1026.459" dur="6.12">things and so my son has looked at me as</text>
  <text start="1030.51" dur="4.23">like his protector you know his whole</text>
  <text start="1032.579" dur="3.931">life and and this is stuff that my wife</text>
  <text start="1034.74" dur="3.689">shared the Essure with his counselor</text>
  <text start="1036.51" dur="5.87">he&amp;#39;s looked at me as me and his</text>
  <text start="1038.429" dur="7.051">protectors whole life in he saw them</text>
  <text start="1042.38" dur="5.5">confiscate all of my guns you know and I</text>
  <text start="1045.48" dur="4.35">keep my guns locked in a safe but they</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="3.75">asked to see them and so I had to unlock</text>
  <text start="1049.83" dur="5.07">the safe I had to pull every single one</text>
  <text start="1051.63" dur="4.98">of my rifles and shotguns out clear the</text>
  <text start="1054.9" dur="4.11">Chamber&amp;#39;s they you know removed the</text>
  <text start="1056.61" dur="4.049">bolts they put zip ties through they</text>
  <text start="1059.01" dur="4.919">wrote down all the you know serial</text>
  <text start="1060.659" dur="4.741">numbers and and and you know my son the</text>
  <text start="1063.929" dur="4.86">way he described it was he said he felt</text>
  <text start="1065.4" dur="5.909">like these strangers were in our home</text>
  <text start="1068.789" dur="4.561">with guns and we had no way to protect</text>
  <text start="1071.309" dur="5.37">ourselves and that I couldn&amp;#39;t protect</text>
  <text start="1073.35" dur="5.13">him and that you know our Second</text>
  <text start="1076.679" dur="3.451">Amendment was being violated at that</text>
  <text start="1078.48" dur="4.319">moment even if just for a short period</text>
  <text start="1080.13" dur="5.549">of time and it&amp;#39;s true so you know you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1082.799" dur="6.081">go through these these experiences and</text>
  <text start="1085.679" dur="8.191">these these feelings of having zero</text>
  <text start="1088.88" dur="6.19">control and no control over anything you</text>
  <text start="1093.87" dur="4.14">know because whether you know whether</text>
  <text start="1095.07" dur="8.13">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re innocent or guilty or</text>
  <text start="1098.01" dur="8.1">whether you have handcuffs on or</text>
  <text start="1103.2" dur="5.49">anything like that you are in a sense</text>
  <text start="1106.11" dur="4.74">you know arrested at the time that you</text>
  <text start="1108.69" dur="4.229">know that they are forcing you to sit in</text>
  <text start="1110.85" dur="5.87">one place and you know removing your</text>
  <text start="1112.919" dur="8.461">guns from you and things like that so um</text>
  <text start="1116.72" dur="6.49">so that happened my son you know he</text>
  <text start="1121.38" dur="3.659">ended up he couldn&amp;#39;t handle the stress</text>
  <text start="1123.21" dur="4.199">of everybody being here so I gave him</text>
  <text start="1125.039" dur="4.26">permission to go go skateboarding and</text>
  <text start="1127.409" dur="4.171">you know just be safe where your home</text>
  <text start="1129.299" dur="5.071">and all that kind of stuff he he ended</text>
  <text start="1131.58" dur="4.65">up falling and getting pretty scratched</text>
  <text start="1134.37" dur="5.07">up so he comes back all bloodied up and</text>
  <text start="1136.23" dur="4.77">you know these pora this one agent who I</text>
  <text start="1139.44" dur="3.479">think she has some children of her own</text>
  <text start="1141" dur="4.08">she was kind enough to bandage him up</text>
  <text start="1142.919" dur="5.041">and everything and you know but it was</text>
  <text start="1145.08" dur="4.349">it was not a pleasant experience by any</text>
  <text start="1147.96" dur="3.089">means I mean they were professional and</text>
  <text start="1149.429" dur="3.75">I think these guys are just doing their</text>
  <text start="1151.049" dur="3.931">job you know they didn&amp;#39;t order this raid</text>
  <text start="1153.179" dur="4.231">they&amp;#39;re just following orders and so I</text>
  <text start="1154.98" dur="8.43">don&amp;#39;t have any malice towards them</text>
  <text start="1157.41" dur="7.89">but but yeah it is a circumstance that</text>
  <text start="1163.41" dur="3.9">no innocent person should ever have to</text>
  <text start="1165.3" dur="6.33">go through it&amp;#39;s horrible</text>
  <text start="1167.31" dur="6.18">and it is a violating feeling you know</text>
  <text start="1171.63" dur="4.56">especially you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to go</text>
  <text start="1173.49" dur="4.44">through when you you&amp;#39;ve done something</text>
  <text start="1176.19" dur="4.53">at great risk that you know you think</text>
  <text start="1177.93" dur="7.26">you know this is you know for the sake</text>
  <text start="1180.72" dur="6.87">of your country so powerful like what</text>
  <text start="1185.19" dur="6.12">you&amp;#39;re saying I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1187.59" dur="5.55">even imagine I don&amp;#39;t know are you gonna</text>
  <text start="1191.31" dur="3.84">let let&amp;#39;s get into what you actually</text>
  <text start="1193.14" dur="3.72">what actually happened like what you</text>
  <text start="1195.15" dur="4.56">what you how the whole thing came about</text>

  <text start="1227.07" dur="4.44">surprised when I told him that so I</text>
  <text start="1228.87" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t know that they knew that in it and</text>
  <text start="1231.51" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s possible they didn&amp;#39;t I think</text>
  <text start="1232.74" dur="5.04">somebody knew and I think somebody you</text>
  <text start="1235.92" dur="3.78">know definitely put the order out there</text>
  <text start="1237.78" dur="6.15">for you know for the search warrant you</text>
  <text start="1239.7" dur="8.43">know based on some knowledge but but I</text>
  <text start="1243.93" dur="6.57">when I did the whistle I used a code</text>

  <text start="1272.58" dur="10.56">safe revealing my my identity and so I</text>
  <text start="1277.68" dur="7.23">wanted to maintain my anonymity and you</text>
  <text start="1283.14" dur="5.55">know and there there are reasons for</text>
  <text start="1284.91" dur="5.4">that so I knew so here&amp;#39;s a new piece of</text>

  <text start="1291.24" dur="11.28">with you guys so the initial complaint</text>
  <text start="1296.57" dur="12.55">it was was filed on each tier the</text>
  <text start="1302.52" dur="8.84">initial complaint June 13 2008 teen you</text>
  <text start="1309.12" dur="6.18">know was when things got sent out and in</text>
  <text start="1311.36" dur="6.43">formalized and it&amp;#39;s not a very long</text>
  <text start="1315.3" dur="4.8">process it&amp;#39;s not like a quick thing that</text>
  <text start="1317.79" dur="4.7">happens I didn&amp;#39;t know how to even deal</text>
  <text start="1320.1" dur="5.37">with this I didn&amp;#39;t know who to go to</text>
  <text start="1322.49" dur="4.84">part of the reason for that was I had</text>
  <text start="1325.47" dur="7.65">two ways of going I could go through the</text>
  <text start="1327.33" dur="9.349">the DOJ Inspector General or I could go</text>
  <text start="1333.12" dur="6.51">through the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="1336.679" dur="5.651">Inspector General so those are my two</text>
  <text start="1339.63" dur="4.5">routes I only have one option in terms</text>
  <text start="1342.33" dur="3.93">of whistleblower protection and that was</text>
  <text start="1344.13" dur="3.69">the intelligence community Whistleblower</text>
  <text start="1346.26" dur="3.87">Protection Act and that&amp;#39;s due to the</text>
  <text start="1347.82" dur="5.16">fact that the whistleblower protection</text>
  <text start="1350.13" dur="8.16">act the regular just WPA does not</text>
  <text start="1352.98" dur="8.94">protect contractors okay the IC WPA does</text>
  <text start="1358.29" dur="7.23">but it clearly does not it states it in</text>
  <text start="1361.92" dur="5.58">there that it does not protect with</text>
  <text start="1365.52" dur="4.289">subcontractor whistleblowers against</text>
  <text start="1367.5" dur="4.17">reprisal so you know you&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="1369.809" dur="4.62">screwed if you&amp;#39;re a contractor you</text>
  <text start="1371.67" dur="4.8">basically only have one Whistleblower</text>
  <text start="1374.429" dur="3.841">Protection Act and that&amp;#39;s the ICC WPA</text>
  <text start="1376.47" dur="5.04">and it states in there that it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1378.27" dur="6.72">protect you against reprisal so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1381.51" dur="6.65">really you know more or less a a I guess</text>
  <text start="1384.99" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s there to protect you give you some</text>
  <text start="1388.16" dur="6.28">prosecutorial protections I guess you</text>
  <text start="1390.63" dur="5.97">know against that but you know but it</text>
  <text start="1394.44" dur="3.78">was it was scary and I don&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="1396.6" dur="3.75">navigate these waters but part of the</text>
  <text start="1398.22" dur="5.43">problem was is I had named you know</text>
  <text start="1400.35" dur="7.98">people in this complaint so in the</text>
  <text start="1403.65" dur="9.6">complaint were named the the former FBI</text>
  <text start="1408.33" dur="8.55">director in Special Counsel Robert</text>
  <text start="1413.25" dur="6.6">Mueller the of course James Comey you</text>
  <text start="1416.88" dur="9.799">know the the you know the former FBI</text>
  <text start="1419.85" dur="6.829">director that the deputy</text>
  <text start="1426.749" dur="7.74">former deputy chief and acting chief of</text>
  <text start="1431.629" dur="5.98">the fraud and public corruption section</text>
  <text start="1434.489" dur="5.51">who at that time and still is currently</text>
  <text start="1437.609" dur="6.981">the intelligence community Inspector</text>
  <text start="1439.999" dur="10.48">General my problem</text>
  <text start="1444.59" dur="8.469">exactly exactly and and also rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="1450.479" dur="7.32">Stein who was the deputy attorney</text>
  <text start="1453.059" dur="7.911">general at times so and and and who also</text>
  <text start="1457.799" dur="6.031">in everything related to you know Russia</text>
  <text start="1460.97" dur="5.559">was handling because Jeff Sessions had</text>
  <text start="1463.83" dur="5.429">recused himself saw him going what what</text>
  <text start="1466.529" dur="7.49">in the hell am I gonna do so you know I</text>
  <text start="1469.259" dur="9.331">saw I saw counsel I I found a really</text>
  <text start="1474.019" dur="7.301">excellent attorney who you know was</text>
  <text start="1478.59" dur="4.62">willing to represent me and they</text>
  <text start="1481.32" dur="6.029">represented you know some some other</text>
  <text start="1483.21" dur="7.709">people who were whistleblowers and so he</text>
  <text start="1487.349" dur="5.731">knew the law really well and that&amp;#39;s Mike</text>
  <text start="1490.919" dur="5.76">Wolfe you know Michael Sekar so so I</text>
  <text start="1493.08" dur="6.929">ended up we end up filing this through</text>
  <text start="1496.679" dur="5.58">through we decided we consulted with</text>
  <text start="1500.009" dur="4.35">other attorneys we consulted with you</text>
  <text start="1502.259" dur="4.29">know some other attorneys that were</text>
  <text start="1504.359" dur="4.38">criminal you know attorneys to make sure</text>
  <text start="1506.549" dur="4.71">that you know there was no criminal</text>
  <text start="1508.739" dur="4.8">liability and to get some advice as to</text>
  <text start="1511.259" dur="4.26">what what did we think was the best way</text>
  <text start="1513.539" dur="4.98">to handle this should we go to a US</text>
  <text start="1515.519" dur="5.27">attorney and you know basically offer</text>
  <text start="1518.519" dur="4.29">this information to them you know and in</text>
  <text start="1520.789" dur="5.32">you know</text>
  <text start="1522.809" dur="6.21">you know asking for protection or you</text>
  <text start="1526.109" dur="5.581">know should we take this information to</text>
  <text start="1529.019" dur="5.13">the inspector general and obviously we</text>
  <text start="1531.69" dur="4.02">couldn&amp;#39;t go to Michael Atkinson so they</text>
  <text start="1534.149" dur="5.791">take it to you the idea is to take it to</text>
  <text start="1535.71" dur="5.579">the DOJ IG but we would have to they</text>
  <text start="1539.94" dur="3.869">would have to agree to allow me</text>
  <text start="1541.289" dur="6.63">anonymity because of the people involved</text>
  <text start="1543.809" dur="6.031">and so we made the decision after you</text>
  <text start="1547.919" dur="3.661">know getting some counsel from a couple</text>
  <text start="1549.84" dur="3.63">of other attorneys they&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="1551.58" dur="5.13">prominent not ready to say who they were</text>
  <text start="1553.47" dur="3.94">yet but but you know determination was</text>
  <text start="1556.71" dur="5.16">made at best</text>
  <text start="1557.41" dur="7.02">route the goal is through the DOJ IG</text>
  <text start="1561.87" dur="5.68">Horowitz had already proven himself to</text>
  <text start="1564.43" dur="6.96">be an honorable man even though he was</text>
  <text start="1567.55" dur="5.31">appointed by Obama he had you know come</text>
  <text start="1571.39" dur="3.78">out with a pretty scathing you know</text>
  <text start="1572.86" dur="6.15">report about some of the wrongdoings in</text>
  <text start="1575.17" dur="5.97">the FBI and and that told me at least</text>
  <text start="1579.01" dur="3.87">that you know he was a man at least that</text>
  <text start="1581.14" dur="6.36">was by the book and that was important</text>
  <text start="1582.88" dur="8.52">to me so so my lawyer made the initial</text>
  <text start="1587.5" dur="7.38">contact with them he was always my go</text>
  <text start="1591.4" dur="6.27">between he made the you know the</text>
  <text start="1594.88" dur="7.98">communication with them and and formed</text>
  <text start="1597.67" dur="7.5">them that you know that I had this</text>
  <text start="1602.86" dur="4.17">information that he had not seen it</text>
  <text start="1605.17" dur="3.45">because he was not cleared to see it but</text>
  <text start="1607.03" dur="6.42">that I intended to bring this</text>
  <text start="1608.62" dur="6.42">information to to the the house</text>
  <text start="1613.45" dur="3.51">permanent Select Committee on</text>
  <text start="1615.04" dur="4.14">Intelligence and the Senate Select</text>
  <text start="1616.96" dur="4.98">Committee on Intelligence and the reason</text>
  <text start="1619.18" dur="5.61">for wanting to bring it to them is both</text>
  <text start="1621.94" dur="5.22">of those committees in Congress they</text>
  <text start="1624.79" dur="5.49">have oversight authority over the</text>
  <text start="1627.16" dur="5.37">intelligence community and these since</text>
  <text start="1630.28" dur="4.77">these were intelligence community</text>
  <text start="1632.53" dur="4.41">related matters you know it was I felt</text>
  <text start="1635.05" dur="5.16">it was important for them to know what</text>
  <text start="1636.94" dur="6.72">was going on and I felt that it was also</text>
  <text start="1640.21" dur="5.28">important that get into the hands of</text>
  <text start="1643.66" dur="4.05">especially I felt it was important to</text>
  <text start="1645.49" dur="3.06">get into the hands of the hypsi because</text>
  <text start="1647.71" dur="4.32">at the time</text>
  <text start="1648.55" dur="6.15">Devin Nunez was doing he was running</text>
  <text start="1652.03" dur="5.04">some investigations and there had been</text>
  <text start="1654.7" dur="5.55">you know news reports that he was</text>
  <text start="1657.07" dur="7.56">getting stonewalled for information from</text>
  <text start="1660.25" dur="7.89">the the FBI on matters related to</text>
  <text start="1664.63" dur="10.77">uranium one and the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="1668.14" dur="11.58">so so the the complaint basically was</text>
  <text start="1675.4" dur="7.77">that the named individuals between the</text>
  <text start="1679.72" dur="6.72">period of January 1st 2009 to the</text>
  <text start="1683.17" dur="5.43">present had failed to enforce multiple</text>
  <text start="1686.44" dur="4.41">United States criminal laws and other</text>
  <text start="1688.6" dur="4.2">laws as well as counter-intel</text>
  <text start="1690.85" dur="4.77">in foreign investments policies and</text>
  <text start="1692.8" dur="5.16">directives against Hillary Rodham</text>
  <text start="1695.62" dur="5.19">Clinton and persons associated or acting</text>
  <text start="1697.96" dur="4.92">in concert with her against an</text>
  <text start="1700.81" dur="8.28">investments by Rosa Tong State</text>
  <text start="1702.88" dur="9.36">Corporation a Oh Ottoman or ottoman urge</text>
  <text start="1709.09" dur="6.9">a prom I&amp;#39;m probably butchering the name</text>
  <text start="1712.24" dur="7.68">of that an arm&amp;#39;s uranium holding company</text>
  <text start="1715.99" dur="6.18">in uranium one and the fact that those</text>
  <text start="1719.92" dur="3.57">persons had you know held senior</text>
  <text start="1722.17" dur="2.82">positions of high trust and</text>
  <text start="1723.49" dur="2.76">responsibility in the Department of</text>
  <text start="1724.99" dur="5.07">Justice and elsewhere in the government</text>
  <text start="1726.25" dur="5.49">and that their failure to act I had not</text>
  <text start="1730.06" dur="4.26">been reversed by the Department of</text>
  <text start="1731.74" dur="5.52">Justice to date that I felt it was an</text>
  <text start="1734.32" dur="6.87">urgent concern as defined in the the</text>
  <text start="1737.26" dur="6.9">icwp a so that that was and I&amp;#39;m quoting</text>
  <text start="1741.19" dur="7.95">it almost exactly but that was the gist</text>
  <text start="1744.16" dur="7.17">of the complaint and and they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1749.14" dur="4.2">documents sores maybe about four hundred</text>
  <text start="1751.33" dur="4.68">I want to say four hundred and</text>
  <text start="1753.34" dur="3.87">fifty-eight and I&amp;#39;m probably wrong you</text>
  <text start="1756.01" dur="3.75">know I didn&amp;#39;t wait all have a copy of it</text>
  <text start="1757.21" dur="4.05">stuff that&amp;#39;s like I can&amp;#39;t tell you for</text>
  <text start="1759.76" dur="3.15">certain but it was I know it was over</text>
  <text start="1761.26" dur="2.7">four hundred and it was I think was</text>
  <text start="1762.91" dur="6.9">either four hundred twenty eight or four</text>
  <text start="1763.96" dur="8.04">hundred fifty eight total pages and you</text>
  <text start="1769.81" dur="6.51">know and it was a lot of stuff related</text>
  <text start="1772" dur="6.66">to that and some other things and but</text>
  <text start="1776.32" dur="4.29">what initially caused me to come across</text>
  <text start="1778.66" dur="3.36">this stuff and and that&amp;#39;s another part</text>
  <text start="1780.61" dur="6.18">of the story that I had never really</text>
  <text start="1782.02" dur="9.3">shared with anybody was um I overheard a</text>
  <text start="1786.79" dur="7.68">conversation in the office dad at you</text>
  <text start="1791.32" dur="4.74">know there was some stuff that had been</text>
  <text start="1794.47" dur="4.86">discovered by some people at the bureau</text>
  <text start="1796.06" dur="5.34">and in that there were people talking</text>
  <text start="1799.33" dur="4.32">the throwing words around like treason</text>
  <text start="1801.4" dur="4.35">and things like that and that they were</text>
  <text start="1803.65" dur="3.45">afraid that this is the kind of thing</text>
  <text start="1805.75" dur="3.9">that could bring down governments and</text>
  <text start="1807.1" dur="5.64">that they didn&amp;#39;t want to they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1809.65" dur="6.27">know what to do about it and that raised</text>
  <text start="1812.74" dur="6.06">as a huge red flag to me because if</text>
  <text start="1815.92" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s that dangerous</text>
  <text start="1818.8" dur="6.3">to national security it should never be</text>
  <text start="1821.59" dur="6.059">ignored or just buried it needs to be</text>
  <text start="1825.1" dur="4.62">with even if it means you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1827.649" dur="4.291">gonna be some pain it&amp;#39;s better to deal</text>
  <text start="1829.72" dur="7.339">with these issues and to ignore them and</text>
  <text start="1831.94" dur="8.69">so so I had access to non</text>
  <text start="1837.059" dur="6.58">compartmentalised areas within the FBI</text>
  <text start="1840.63" dur="5.86">net is what they called it a network</text>
  <text start="1843.639" dur="5.311">inside I did a couple of searches and I</text>
  <text start="1846.49" dur="5.069">found some things that I found very</text>
  <text start="1848.95" dur="4.469">disturbing because it showed to me that</text>
  <text start="1851.559" dur="5.881">there was clear evidence that the FBI</text>
  <text start="1853.419" dur="6.301">had in their possession and and case my</text>
  <text start="1857.44" dur="6.359">case files associated with that</text>
  <text start="1859.72" dur="5.97">information analyst notes associated</text>
  <text start="1863.799" dur="7.171">with that information that showed a</text>
  <text start="1865.69" dur="6.75">credibility of criminal behavior and you</text>
  <text start="1870.97" dur="4.47">know so the first one I saw it I thought</text>
  <text start="1872.44" dur="5.04">okay good they&amp;#39;re investigating this it</text>
  <text start="1875.44" dur="5.43">just hasn&amp;#39;t come out yet so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1877.48" dur="5.699">gonna just hang tight and let the you</text>
  <text start="1880.87" dur="7.37">know let let the let these guys do their</text>
  <text start="1883.179" dur="5.061">job and then it was shortly thereafter</text>
  <text start="1889.83" dur="8.04">shortly thereafter that D Jimmy J Cohen</text>
  <text start="1895.69" dur="6.239">he goes out in front of the cameras and</text>
  <text start="1897.87" dur="7.059">he totally exonerates Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1901.929" dur="5.041">it&amp;#39;s from the world and while none of</text>
  <text start="1904.929" dur="5.941">this stuff that I was dealing with had</text>
  <text start="1906.97" dur="6">anything to do with the the the email</text>
  <text start="1910.87" dur="4.439">server or any of that was not related to</text>
  <text start="1912.97" dur="5.22">that my thought was how can you</text>
  <text start="1915.309" dur="6.901">exonerate this lady knowing what you</text>
  <text start="1918.19" dur="7.53">know know having the evidence that you</text>
  <text start="1922.21" dur="7.589">certainly know about and you basically</text>
  <text start="1925.72" dur="6.659">just told the you know the the United</text>
  <text start="1929.799" dur="4.651">States voters that it&amp;#39;s perfectly</text>
  <text start="1932.379" dur="5.52">acceptable to vote for this woman who is</text>
  <text start="1934.45" dur="5.219">actually under criminal investigation um</text>
  <text start="1937.899" dur="3.15">my thought was you know if he should</text>
  <text start="1939.669" dur="3.901">have said nothing he should have</text>
  <text start="1941.049" dur="3.811">basically if he felt that you know she</text>
  <text start="1943.57" dur="4.319">should be exoneree he should have told</text>
  <text start="1944.86" dur="4.919">that you know to the Attorney General or</text>
  <text start="1947.889" dur="3.331">the Deputy Attorney General if he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1949.779" dur="3.061">feel comfortable saying it to the</text>
  <text start="1951.22" dur="4.14">Attorney General because she had recused</text>
  <text start="1952.84" dur="5.51">herself there was other things that he</text>
  <text start="1955.36" dur="4.76">couldn&amp;#39;t have done but what he did to me</text>
  <text start="1958.35" dur="5.25">indicated to me that he was part of some</text>
  <text start="1960.12" dur="5.88">sort of cover-up operation and I could</text>
  <text start="1963.6" dur="6.99">not sit by and see that happen and not</text>
  <text start="1966" dur="7.169">do something about it so I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="1970.59" dur="4.91">lie to you I was completely scared out</text>
  <text start="1973.169" dur="8.671">of my wits I did not know what to do and</text>
  <text start="1975.5" dur="9.72">I prayed I am a Christian and I believe</text>
  <text start="1981.84" dur="6.589">in in prayer and I believe in God and I</text>
  <text start="1985.22" dur="7">prayed I prayed a lot and I asked God</text>
  <text start="1988.429" dur="6.641">you know to give me a way out of this or</text>
  <text start="1992.22" dur="4.799">show me what to do and the only thing I</text>
  <text start="1995.07" dur="4.05">kept coming back to is I needed to blow</text>
  <text start="1997.019" dur="4.321">the whistle but I know it happens to</text>

  <text start="2092.63" dur="4.65">tighten the belt a little bit you know</text>
  <text start="2094.88" dur="4.47">overall you know it was manageable and</text>
  <text start="2097.28" dur="4.86">so I realized I said this is my</text>
  <text start="2099.35" dur="8.61">opportunity so I I jumped on it and and</text>
  <text start="2102.14" dur="11.18">I ended up leading so when I when I took</text>
  <text start="2107.96" dur="10.29">the information to to the IG we agreed</text>
  <text start="2113.32" dur="10.18">to meet at st. John&amp;#39;s Church across from</text>
  <text start="2118.25" dur="7.32">the White House and and it was I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2123.5" dur="5.43">remember the exact date but it was on</text>
  <text start="2125.57" dur="8.67">the day when Horowitz was giving</text>
  <text start="2128.93" dur="9.63">testimony on Capitol Hill on one of his</text>
  <text start="2134.24" dur="8.61">latest reports I remember that and so</text>
  <text start="2138.56" dur="6.69">you know was a a kind of a memory</text>
  <text start="2142.85" dur="5.49">remember of all day in that sense but I</text>
  <text start="2145.25" dur="5.04">went in and my boy we went into the</text>
  <text start="2148.34" dur="4.26">church ahead of time we got out on our</text>
  <text start="2150.29" dur="3.81">knees and we prayed together that God</text>
  <text start="2152.6" dur="5.88">would keep me safe and that you know</text>
  <text start="2154.1" dur="7.86">this everything would go smoothly he the</text>
  <text start="2158.48" dur="4.65">IG sent his deputy I think it was when</text>
  <text start="2161.96" dur="4.2">his deputy one of the guys from his</text>
  <text start="2163.13" dur="4.77">office see it was my lawyer my lawyer</text>
  <text start="2166.16" dur="3.87">walked him in i sat in the front queue</text>
  <text start="2167.9" dur="4.92">with a hoodie and sunglasses on and the</text>
  <text start="2170.03" dur="3.75">package double-wrap following you know</text>
  <text start="2172.82" dur="3.09">they wanted me to print out the</text>
  <text start="2173.78" dur="3.84">documents they wanted me to double seal</text>
  <text start="2175.91" dur="3.3">it you know follow certain rules in</text>
  <text start="2177.62" dur="3.93">regards to handling classified</text>
  <text start="2179.21" dur="5.01">information again and then I you know</text>
  <text start="2181.55" dur="4.98">handed it over my left shoulder to him</text>
  <text start="2184.22" dur="6.18">so he never saw my face never knew my</text>
  <text start="2186.53" dur="5.9">name and and that was it and you know</text>
  <text start="2190.4" dur="4.2">and then we walked out afterwards and</text>
  <text start="2192.43" dur="4.24">Karla bays and and that was you know</text>
  <text start="2194.6" dur="4.59">kind of things went quiet for a very</text>
  <text start="2196.67" dur="3.77">long time we did get some confirmations</text>
  <text start="2199.19" dur="5.31">back from my lawyer</text>
  <text start="2200.44" dur="5.74">talking to different people talking both</text>
  <text start="2204.5" dur="4.41">to the AG&amp;#39;s office and then also he was</text>
  <text start="2206.18" dur="8.88">interfacing with some people at the the</text>
  <text start="2208.91" dur="8.01">hypocricy and and we found out that that</text>
  <text start="2215.06" dur="4.86">so it goes through a process when you go</text>
  <text start="2216.92" dur="5.61">through whistleblowing um I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2219.92" dur="6.21">if this is the case through when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2222.53" dur="5.67">the IC IG but witness the DOJ IG any</text>
  <text start="2226.13" dur="5.31">documents that are submitted have to be</text>
  <text start="2228.2" dur="6.53">reviewed and so that redactions can be</text>
  <text start="2231.44" dur="5.31">made and if necessary</text>
  <text start="2234.73" dur="5.74">you know this stuff that I had was all</text>
  <text start="2236.75" dur="5.34">secret none of it was top secret and but</text>
  <text start="2240.47" dur="3.03">it goes up and there&amp;#39;s a period of time</text>
  <text start="2242.09" dur="3.54">that they have I think it&amp;#39;s like either</text>
  <text start="2243.5" dur="4.71">14 or 21 days I don&amp;#39;t know if the top my</text>
  <text start="2245.63" dur="4.83">head that&amp;#39;s why we have lawyers but they</text>
  <text start="2248.21" dur="7.98">had a period of time that they had to</text>
  <text start="2250.46" dur="10.71">review everything it went up to general</text>
  <text start="2256.19" dur="8.79">Jeff Sessions office review and you know</text>
  <text start="2261.17" dur="7.35">get sent back down he decided not to</text>
  <text start="2264.98" dur="6.48">make any reductions and and I think</text>
  <text start="2268.52" dur="5.69">basically he you know he basically just</text>
  <text start="2271.46" dur="7.53">didn&amp;#39;t want to really deal with it and</text>
  <text start="2274.21" dur="6.58">but it went back down and and so at that</text>
  <text start="2278.99" dur="3.69">point because we&amp;#39;ve indicated in our</text>
  <text start="2280.79" dur="5.52">letter we intended fully to bring this</text>
  <text start="2282.68" dur="5.61">information the committee&amp;#39;s we were told</text>
  <text start="2286.31" dur="4.95">that we could proceed with no redactions</text>
  <text start="2288.29" dur="4.35">and so we reached out to connect to</text>
  <text start="2291.26" dur="4.77">these mile or reach out to these</text>
  <text start="2292.64" dur="5.94">committees and and they did not want to</text>
  <text start="2296.03" dur="4.77">accept anything from us because I was</text>
  <text start="2298.58" dur="5.15">not you know because I had a code name</text>
  <text start="2300.8" dur="5.3">because I was they didn&amp;#39;t know who I was</text>
  <text start="2303.73" dur="5.1">so we went back to the writing</text>
  <text start="2306.1" dur="4.93">explaining the problem he ended up</text>
  <text start="2308.83" dur="3.52">agreeing that the information was</text>
  <text start="2311.03" dur="3.44">important enough that it needed to go</text>
  <text start="2312.35" dur="4.35">before the committee&amp;#39;s and he agreed to</text>
  <text start="2314.47" dur="3.67">on our behalf take the information</text>
  <text start="2316.7" dur="3.03">directly to the committee&amp;#39;s and the</text>
  <text start="2318.14" dur="4.65">committee&amp;#39;s agreed to accept that if it</text>
  <text start="2319.73" dur="5.51">came from him so so that&amp;#39;s what we did</text>
  <text start="2322.79" dur="4.41">we went back on the I G&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="2325.24" dur="5.77">hand-delivered the information to both</text>
  <text start="2327.2" dur="7.17">committee piece and we found out later</text>
  <text start="2331.01" dur="5.46">that some security officer are put the</text>
  <text start="2334.37" dur="5.37">sissy that&amp;#39;s the the Senate Select</text>
  <text start="2336.47" dur="5.85">Committee on Intelligence basically and</text>
  <text start="2339.74" dur="6.27">I say this with air quotes conveniently</text>
  <text start="2342.32" dur="6.54">misplaced the entire packet in is</text>
  <text start="2346.01" dur="5.39">classified safe so the Senate committee</text>
  <text start="2348.86" dur="5.19">far as I know never even saw it</text>
  <text start="2351.4" dur="4">however we got confirmation from the hip</text>
  <text start="2354.05" dur="1.74">see that they did see it and if they</text>
  <text start="2355.4" dur="2.07">were</text>
  <text start="2355.79" dur="4.02">reviewing it the problem is is that</text>
  <text start="2357.47" dur="4.8">there had just been well there was an</text>
  <text start="2359.81" dur="5.25">election shortly thereafter and the</text>
  <text start="2362.27" dur="4.5">house lost control or the Republican has</text>
  <text start="2365.06" dur="3.84">lost control of the house which meant</text>
  <text start="2366.77" dur="5.76">that Adam Schiff was now gonna be this</text>
  <text start="2368.9" dur="6.27">charming of the of the hypsi and I think</text>
  <text start="2372.53" dur="3.78">we all know he&amp;#39;s not gonna want to do</text>
  <text start="2375.17" dur="4.86">anything with any of the information</text>
  <text start="2376.31" dur="6.39">that I provided so it basically as far</text>
  <text start="2380.03" dur="7.29">as the Congress&amp;#39;s concern I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2382.7" dur="6.6">anything ever happened from it well Nate</text>
  <text start="2387.32" dur="5.34">I got a I got a question for you on this</text>
  <text start="2389.3" dur="4.68">I have to interject William Campbell I</text>
  <text start="2392.66" dur="2.25">mean well first of all there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="2393.98" dur="3.87">things that you&amp;#39;re saying right now</text>
  <text start="2394.91" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s really getting mean just from the</text>
  <text start="2397.85" dur="5.1">the predicament of being a good American</text>
  <text start="2400.55" dur="4.77">having guns knowing how to use them</text>
  <text start="2402.95" dur="5.82">being safe but then being faced with</text>
  <text start="2405.32" dur="6.39">that choice of well you know if I even</text>
  <text start="2408.77" dur="5.85">go near them at this point I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m done</text>
  <text start="2411.71" dur="4.98">so and having your whole life splayed</text>
  <text start="2414.62" dur="3.87">out in front of you at that point what</text>
  <text start="2416.69" dur="3.36">the hell is even matter if you ever had</text>
  <text start="2418.49" dur="6.39">your right to defend yourself and you</text>
  <text start="2420.05" dur="5.76">ever took it seriously well you know</text>
  <text start="2424.88" dur="2.58">it&amp;#39;s like when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="2425.81" dur="3.42">that position what does it matter that</text>
  <text start="2427.46" dur="3.75">you took that right to defend yourself</text>
  <text start="2429.23" dur="4.38">seriously at one point because if you</text>
  <text start="2431.21" dur="4.88">even consider it it&amp;#39;s all over and you</text>
  <text start="2433.61" dur="5.57">don&amp;#39;t want it to be it all over so um</text>
  <text start="2436.09" dur="5.32">look at the what was at the Bundy ranch</text>
  <text start="2439.18" dur="7.72">we know what happens when you try to</text>
  <text start="2441.41" dur="7.8">defend yourself oh yeah yeah and you</text>
  <text start="2446.9" dur="5.52">know others and so I was not going down</text>
  <text start="2449.21" dur="5.34">that road I know and that&amp;#39;s just one of</text>
  <text start="2452.42" dur="5.07">those things were you it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sad that</text>
  <text start="2454.55" dur="4.38">you have to pray that if you ever you if</text>
  <text start="2457.49" dur="4.77">you ever have to defend yourself it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2458.93" dur="5.4">against you know just a common criminal</text>
  <text start="2462.26" dur="4.74">and not the government you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2464.33" dur="4.47">your government no it&amp;#39;s not you know so</text>
  <text start="2467" dur="3.87">now let me let me ask you I want to move</text>
  <text start="2468.8" dur="3.87">on to the other thing that I the biggest</text>
  <text start="2470.87" dur="3.33">thing I wanted to say is that well we</text>
  <text start="2472.67" dur="3.57">all know and Tracy and I talk about this</text>
  <text start="2474.2" dur="4.53">all the time we we know what happens to</text>
  <text start="2476.24" dur="4.92">actual whistleblowers and I I think that</text>
  <text start="2478.73" dur="3.99">we all do at this point even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2481.16" dur="4.56">just watching what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="2482.72" dur="5.07">country in a very the mediocre or</text>
  <text start="2485.72" dur="3.49">rudimentary sense it&amp;#39;s so easy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2487.79" dur="3.55">destroyed they have to</text>
  <text start="2489.21" dur="4.05">the country at sometimes or they&amp;#39;re sooo</text>
  <text start="2491.34" dur="3.06">merrily ignored and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2493.26" dur="3.75">right now with this sanctimonious</text>
  <text start="2494.4" dur="4.59">behavior over this impeachment farce it</text>
  <text start="2497.01" dur="3.93">D legitimizes the whole thing outright</text>
  <text start="2498.99" dur="3.39">because if if these whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="2500.94" dur="3.3">really had any information that was</text>
  <text start="2502.38" dur="6.81">going to leave the world in a better</text>
  <text start="2504.24" dur="10.34">place they&amp;#39;d be smeared to no end and so</text>
  <text start="2509.19" dur="7.98">I and and and to be honest with you I</text>
  <text start="2514.58" dur="6.55">was perfectly content just keeping my</text>
  <text start="2517.17" dur="6.81">mouth shut and but this nonsense going</text>
  <text start="2521.13" dur="4.14">on right now in Congress it kind of got</text>
  <text start="2523.98" dur="3.8">to me and I was like you know what I</text>
  <text start="2525.27" dur="6.33">can&amp;#39;t just keep my mouth shut anymore</text>
  <text start="2527.78" dur="5.56">enough is enough this is BS what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2531.6" dur="3.51">happening here is completely BS I mean</text>
  <text start="2533.34" dur="4.59">two of the big things that bothered me</text>
  <text start="2535.11" dur="6.51">in the situation was one of the people</text>
  <text start="2537.93" dur="8.04">who was in my complaint was the IC IG</text>
  <text start="2541.62" dur="7.89">and the IC IG was involved in approving</text>
  <text start="2545.97" dur="7.05">the change of a form and backdating it</text>
  <text start="2549.51" dur="5.73">so that this current whistleblower you</text>
  <text start="2553.02" dur="4.35">know could could go ahead and you know</text>
  <text start="2555.24" dur="7.08">blow the whistle was secondhand in from</text>
  <text start="2557.37" dur="8.24">secondhand information that clearly to</text>
  <text start="2562.32" dur="7.8">me that is very very suspicious</text>
  <text start="2565.61" dur="8.53">especially in light of you know this guy</text>
  <text start="2570.12" dur="6.03">being named in my my my complaint and</text>
  <text start="2574.14" dur="3.66">you know I named him in my complaint not</text>
  <text start="2576.15" dur="4.41">because I necessarily thought he was</text>
  <text start="2577.8" dur="5.7">deep state it was just because I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2580.56" dur="4.98">know you know he he was he was the head</text>
  <text start="2583.5" dur="4.05">of you know he was running basically a</text>
  <text start="2585.54" dur="5.58">department within the you know within</text>
  <text start="2587.55" dur="7.23">the or division within the FBI really</text>
  <text start="2591.12" dur="5.67">the public corruption at the time public</text>
  <text start="2594.78" dur="4.5">corruption was going on and the FBI knew</text>
  <text start="2596.79" dur="4.58">about it in regards to you know the</text>
  <text start="2599.28" dur="5.22">Clinton Foundation in uranium one and so</text>
  <text start="2601.37" dur="4.84">his to me his eyes would have been all</text>
  <text start="2604.5" dur="5.76">over a lot of this information that I</text>
  <text start="2606.21" dur="5.55">had you know and so I had concerns and</text>
  <text start="2610.26" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s why we chose not to do it but but</text>
  <text start="2611.76" dur="3.14">when this stuff happened with the</text>
  <text start="2613.47" dur="5.07">current whistleblower</text>
  <text start="2614.9" dur="5.35">it really made me believe that this guy</text>
  <text start="2618.54" dur="3.46">was potentially deep State and maybe</text>
  <text start="2620.25" dur="4.42">part of the</text>
  <text start="2622" dur="4.95">what I call soft coup attempt against</text>
  <text start="2624.67" dur="4.14">our president it&amp;#39;s gotta be and but but</text>
  <text start="2626.95" dur="3.98">but let me ask you one last thing or</text>
  <text start="2628.81" dur="4.44">bring up one last thing William Campbell</text>
  <text start="2630.93" dur="5.8">he was working undercover with the FBI</text>
  <text start="2633.25" dur="6.18">on this on this uranium one thing there</text>
  <text start="2636.73" dur="5.16">- he was paid to go and check it all out</text>
  <text start="2639.43" dur="4.89">and once again smeared by some of these</text>
  <text start="2641.89" dur="4.38">same committees and then after maybe a</text>
  <text start="2644.32" dur="5.01">couple of weeks of light coverage</text>
  <text start="2646.27" dur="5.73">ignored summarily by the media so from</text>
  <text start="2649.33" dur="4.35">what you have been able to uncover how</text>
  <text start="2652" dur="3.6">much could you corroborate of William</text>
  <text start="2653.68" dur="4.92">Campbell because he found bribery</text>
  <text start="2655.6" dur="6.81">extortion kickbacks everything and we</text>
  <text start="2658.6" dur="6.42">stopped hearing from him all of it so so</text>
  <text start="2662.41" dur="6.54">a lot of a lot of a lot of the</text>
  <text start="2665.02" dur="7.11">information a lot of the information was</text>
  <text start="2668.95" dur="5.43">related to you know financial</text>
  <text start="2672.13" dur="4.41">transactions and that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="2674.38" dur="3.87">say about that and then a lot of the</text>
  <text start="2676.54" dur="3.81">information was related to intelligence</text>
  <text start="2678.25" dur="5.28">you know that we had from you know</text>
  <text start="2680.35" dur="5.1">sources and so you know I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2683.53" dur="3.42">listened to all of William Campbell&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2685.45" dur="3.3">tests to me so I should rephrase that</text>
  <text start="2686.95" dur="4.29">when I say all of it I just mean that in</text>
  <text start="2688.75" dur="7.98">terms of the whole thing that went down</text>
  <text start="2691.24" dur="8.73">with 10x and Russert on all of that yeah</text>
  <text start="2696.73" dur="6.57">that all that about all that and they</text>
  <text start="2699.97" dur="6.899">had Bates this is the crazy thing they</text>
  <text start="2703.3" dur="8.01">had documents okay that were dated to</text>
  <text start="2706.869" dur="7.261">before the cynthia&amp;#39;s committee&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2711.31" dur="5.549">decision to approve the uranium one</text>
  <text start="2714.13" dur="5.729">purchase the FBI director at that time</text>
  <text start="2716.859" dur="5.791">was Robert Mueller so he would have</text>
  <text start="2719.859" dur="5.611">known about all the stuff that that had</text>
  <text start="2722.65" dur="6.87">gone down related to what William</text>
  <text start="2725.47" dur="6.03">Campbell was talking about and one of</text>
  <text start="2729.52" dur="6.24">his duties as the FBI directors to</text>
  <text start="2731.5" dur="7.5">provide advice to the stiffest committee</text>
  <text start="2735.76" dur="7.05">and there there&amp;#39;s the the Committee on</text>
  <text start="2739" dur="7.65">Foreign Investment I know I&amp;#39;m probably</text>
  <text start="2742.81" dur="5.46">slaughtering this and basically they</text>
  <text start="2746.65" dur="3.959">prove anything that could affect</text>
  <text start="2748.27" dur="4.02">national security it has to go through</text>
  <text start="2750.609" dur="3.871">this group and then they got to approve</text>
  <text start="2752.29" dur="4.62">it and you know so too</text>
  <text start="2754.48" dur="4.14">me I found that very troubling you know</text>
  <text start="2756.91" dur="5.66">to say the least and that&amp;#39;s why his name</text>
  <text start="2758.62" dur="6.69">was in there was because he had a</text>
  <text start="2762.57" dur="5.26">responsibility to inform this epheus</text>
  <text start="2765.31" dur="5.1">that you know maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="2767.83" dur="5.43">the Russians to buy a company that will</text>
  <text start="2770.41" dur="4.62">have control over 20% of the uranium you</text>
  <text start="2773.26" dur="4.95">know our uranium supply chain you know</text>
  <text start="2775.03" dur="7.95">just saying you know but that did not</text>
  <text start="2778.21" dur="7.98">happen okay rah-rah roses find the</text>
  <text start="2782.98" dur="8.21">reason he he was named was because he</text>
  <text start="2786.19" dur="9.36">was I think the state&amp;#39;s attorney that</text>
  <text start="2791.19" dur="5.5">was involved in that case and was</text>
  <text start="2795.55" dur="4.02">involved in that because the case</text>
  <text start="2796.69" dur="5.85">happened in Maryland and and and the</text>
  <text start="2799.57" dur="5.52">problem is is that obviously nothing</text>
  <text start="2802.54" dur="5.82">happened for very long time I think they</text>
  <text start="2805.09" dur="8.04">just just this year indicted the guy</text>
  <text start="2808.36" dur="6.57">involved in it and he lives in he lives</text>
  <text start="2813.13" dur="6.96">down there not too far for me actually</text>
  <text start="2814.93" dur="7.68">in Mount Airy and they just indicted him</text>
  <text start="2820.09" dur="6.54">this year I mean this is like many many</text>
  <text start="2822.61" dur="5.78">years after the fact still ongoing Nate</text>
  <text start="2826.63" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s still going on that 10x case</text>
  <text start="2828.39" dur="4.75">exactly I think that I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="2830.92" dur="5.13">surprised you know but I think what man</text>
  <text start="2833.14" dur="4.95">happened was I think it got well there</text>
  <text start="2836.05" dur="3.9">are there are some people who have come</text>
  <text start="2838.09" dur="4.26">out and have said that basically that</text>
  <text start="2839.95" dur="5.4">case got you know the brakes put on it</text>
  <text start="2842.35" dur="5.73">and they were told to ignore it and you</text>
  <text start="2845.35" dur="4.56">know and you know and I think now that</text>
  <text start="2848.08" dur="5.31">we have a new administration we have a</text>
  <text start="2849.91" dur="5.33">new Attorney General we have a new FBI</text>
  <text start="2853.39" dur="5.37">director I think they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2855.24" dur="6.36">correct some of these things and at</text>
  <text start="2858.76" dur="6.63">least that&amp;#39;s my hope and you know and</text>
  <text start="2861.6" dur="6.73">but but basically yeah they you know</text>
  <text start="2865.39" dur="4.92">many years go by and then all of a</text>
  <text start="2868.33" dur="5.94">sudden now something&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="2870.31" dur="7.38">happen so I don&amp;#39;t know you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2874.27" dur="6.48">I was not part of law enforcement and so</text>
  <text start="2877.69" dur="6.39">a good person asked on how these things</text>

  <text start="3268.75" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s what I see</text>
  <text start="3271.33" dur="4.05">quite frankly with the media is a just</text>
  <text start="3273.73" dur="3.24">an arrogance and a hatred and I</text>

  <text start="3301.31" dur="6.84">people like you do you guys and others</text>
  <text start="3304.43" dur="6.15">and you know the alternative media have</text>
  <text start="3308.15" dur="4.95">have a great role to play in trying to</text>
  <text start="3310.58" dur="4.74">stop that by helping people to get read</text>

  <text start="3324.14" dur="3.09">you know conversations and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3325.94" dur="2.97">certainly not gonna happen in the</text>

  <text start="3516.22" dur="6.49">happened to Donald Trump with this you</text>
  <text start="3519.079" dur="6">know Mueller investigation that was a</text>
  <text start="3522.71" dur="4.17">farce true justice takes a long time</text>
  <text start="3525.079" dur="3.78">because they have to build evidence they</text>
  <text start="3526.88" dur="4.949">have to get proper warrants they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3528.859" dur="6.271">just you know spy on people unwarranted</text>
  <text start="3531.829" dur="5.25">and and so we&amp;#39;d have to be patient</text>
  <text start="3535.13" dur="4.05">because if they are truly investigating</text>
  <text start="3537.079" dur="4.231">it&amp;#39;s just gonna take time and if it&amp;#39;s as</text>
  <text start="3539.18" dur="4.32">big as in widespread as I think it is</text>
  <text start="3541.31" dur="4.91">it&amp;#39;s a lot of people involved in</text>

  <text start="3728.59" dur="5.29">starting out the day listening to these</text>
  <text start="3731.9" dur="5.37">opening statements from these career</text>
  <text start="3733.88" dur="5.7">bureaucrats who they they have nothing</text>

  <text start="3765.29" dur="4.68">gets me is how these folks come up with</text>
  <text start="3767.75" dur="5.07">you know they&amp;#39;ll come up with new stuff</text>
  <text start="3769.97" dur="6.96">like every every a lot of the witnesses</text>
  <text start="3772.82" dur="6.81">so far they&amp;#39;ll testify behind closed</text>
  <text start="3776.93" dur="5.19">doors and what I like to call the the</text>
  <text start="3779.63" dur="4.23">audition right and then after the</text>
  <text start="3782.12" dur="5.79">audition goes through if if they think</text>
  <text start="3783.86" dur="6.24">that it&amp;#39;s good they will bring in these</text>
  <text start="3787.91" dur="5.22">guys to testify in front of you know the</text>
