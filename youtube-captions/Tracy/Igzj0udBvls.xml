  <text start="6.99" dur="3.54">I wanted to go over something with you</text>
  <text start="9.09" dur="3.839">guys I&amp;#39;ve been working on for a little</text>
  <text start="10.53" dur="7.23">while now and this came out too very</text>
  <text start="12.929" dur="6.781">much fun fanfare on the 22nd and of</text>
  <text start="17.76" dur="3.81">course conservative treehouse one of my</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="4.95">favorite go-to places for news and</text>
  <text start="21.57" dur="7.35">Sundance aka the last refuge two on</text>
  <text start="24.66" dur="10.41">Twitter came out and said this subpoena</text>
  <text start="28.92" dur="8.159">to rod rosin seen from Goodlatte is not</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="3.899">what we should really be looking at but</text>
  <text start="37.079" dur="5.281">what we should be looking at is the DOJ</text>
  <text start="38.969" dur="6.331">response and basically the DOJ response</text>
  <text start="42.36" dur="5.07">confirms that there is a grand jury and</text>
  <text start="45.3" dur="4.169">that they have to filter through</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="4.199">information that has been presented to</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="3.991">the grand jury etc so on and so forth</text>
  <text start="51.629" dur="3.75">and here in this article</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="4.259">Sundance says however it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="55.379" dur="4.471">subpoena that should make the news pay</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="7.23">close attention to the DOJ response and</text>
  <text start="59.85" dur="6.9">the DOJ response is DOJ on House</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="3.571">Judiciary Committee subpoenas we are</text>
  <text start="66.75" dur="3.51">individually reviewing the remaining</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="3.84">documents to ensure that they do not</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="4.14">include grand jury information</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="4.079">information about ongoing law</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="4.289">enforcement actions involving American</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="8.011">citizens or privileged attorney-client</text>
  <text start="78.689" dur="7.981">communications and basically Sundance</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="4.32">comes back and says what&amp;#39;s that yeah the</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="3.36">DOJ has to review the demand for</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="3.12">evidence because release of those</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.83">documents might conflict with ongoing</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="4.939">grand jury information / evidence yes</text>
  <text start="94.86" dur="5.61">that means a grand jury is impaneled</text>
  <text start="96.829" dur="5.11">exactly as we expected and inside of oh</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="2.85">and he says yes and this also means</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="3.301">there are law enforcement actions</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="3.96">currently ongoing as a result of the</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="3.96">prosecutor assigned to reviewing the</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="6.57">evidence discovered by inspector general</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="7.86">Horowitz and we know again Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="7.44">appointed a special prosecutor to work</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="6.239">with Horowitz on the investigation into</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="3.96">all kinds of things that he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="5.21">working on for a year now that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.25" dur="7.05">expecting within the next I would say</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="5.261">fifteen to thirty forty days they have</text>
  <text start="132.3" dur="2.52">to make sure everything&amp;#39;s ready to go</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="2.88">they have to make sure that the</text>
  <text start="134.82" dur="4.2">indictments roll out they have to there</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="6.59">are indictments and but what I wanted to</text>
  <text start="139.02" dur="6.57">get to here is that in this in this</text>
  <text start="143.24" dur="4.6">article he says we shouldn&amp;#39;t be paying</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="4.5">attention to the subpoena and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="4.26">say I paid a lot of attention to the</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="4.62">subpoena because and in here he also</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="4.17">insinuates that they don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="154.71" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s criminal stuff got with criminal</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="7.35">investigations going on I&amp;#39;m gonna say I</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="7.29">I took a lot of time digging up as many</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="8.01">congressional and other subpoenas as I</text>
  <text start="166.35" dur="6.54">possibly could to compare them because a</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="4.38">lot of people were saying well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="5.19">cand language in the subpoena that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="4.32">canned language that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="3.9">they put in every subpoena that they</text>
  <text start="180.33" dur="4.11">send out and we shouldn&amp;#39;t be paying</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="4.71">attention to that and I wanted to see if</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="4.86">that was true and I&amp;#39;ll tell ya it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="7.26">really really hard to find these</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="7.29">subpoenas but I found one two three four</text>

  <text start="386.19" dur="7.8">when the court made the decision to</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="9.449">impanel a grand jury so let&amp;#39;s see if</text>
  <text start="393.99" dur="5.22">this is canned language right this is a</text>
  <text start="397.289" dur="3.361">draft subpoena I&amp;#39;m about to show you</text>
  <text start="399.21" dur="6.57">four</text>
  <text start="400.65" dur="7.76">Michael Flynn and the I believe I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="2.63">gonna look at this</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="7.78">no thank you</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="10.79">um here it is there are no footnotes in</text>
  <text start="417.18" dur="8.03">this this was June 2nd I believe the</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="9.309">special counsel was the special counsel</text>
  <text start="425.21" dur="7.47">impaneled in June I believe it was there</text>
  <text start="430.919" dur="4.231">was a special counsel in June</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="4.12">let me just triple check that I&amp;#39;m nearly</text>
  <text start="435.15" dur="4.17">certain all these seats they get all</text>
  <text start="436.8" dur="4.02">confused in my head yes this was a month</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="4.349">after the special counsel was impaneled</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="4.56">I just checked it and basically they</text>
  <text start="443.669" dur="3.661">request all the documents but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="3.72">desk they don&amp;#39;t say anything about grand</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="5.42">jury in here and Muller was</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="7.62">investigating so that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="5.53">mm-hmm so they you know you know Muller</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="3.89">has to have a grand jury impaneled why</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="6.509">not put it in the Flynn document as well</text>
  <text start="460.61" dur="5.92">so I&amp;#39;ll link this below see we got no</text>
  <text start="464.789" dur="6">footnotes that talk about grand jury in</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="7.29">here then I found another one from ASA</text>
  <text start="470.789" dur="12.091">or two is uh from the Committee on</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="11.909">Oversight and reform what I know you</text>
  <text start="482.88" dur="4.89">guys hate when I do this sorry okay here</text>
  <text start="485.729" dur="6.18">it is it&amp;#39;s hard to see it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="487.77" dur="7.38">see making it bigger for you but</text>
  <text start="491.909" dur="5.911">basically this isn&amp;#39;t in terms of the ATF</text>
  <text start="495.15" dur="6.449">end project fast and furious etc and</text>
  <text start="497.82" dur="6.36">again there is nothing in footnotes</text>
  <text start="501.599" dur="4.56">about a grand jury proceeding and we can</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="3.57">do this again and again again for a</text>
  <text start="506.159" dur="5.281">bunch of different subpoenas that I</text>
  <text start="507.75" dur="7.529">found what I&amp;#39;m basically trying to say</text>
  <text start="511.44" dur="5.58">is that this is this is a this is not</text>
  <text start="515.279" dur="5.281">normal this is not something that always</text>
  <text start="517.02" dur="6.449">happens this is definitely specific to</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="5.34">this case here is somebody suing Andrew</text>
  <text start="523.469" dur="4.711">Breitbart again obviously the the</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="3.99">context is not necessarily the same but</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="4.529">here&amp;#39;s the subpoena asking for what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="4.98">asking for and at the bottom you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="532.709" dur="4.291">there are no</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s nothing about a grand jury in</text>
  <text start="537" dur="4.5">here and this goes on and on and on for</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="5.31">the several examples I found which means</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="4.47">that even though Sundance is absolutely</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="4.85">a hundred percent correct the DOJ</text>
  <text start="545.97" dur="7.28">response is definitely very interesting</text>
  <text start="549.29" dur="7.09">the subpoena is important as well</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="4.36">because he asserts in here that the good</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="3.81">lot should not know about any</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="4.77">investigations or etc I feel like he he</text>
  <text start="560.19" dur="3.96">may and I feel like this subpoena was</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="3.81">kind of an odd that he does and of</text>
  <text start="564.15" dur="4.62">course they keep these things cept you</text>
  <text start="566.19" dur="5.31">know secret many times so it&amp;#39;s hard for</text>
  <text start="568.77" dur="5.49">us to see them so it was hard for me to</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="4.98">find this but I found it I found a lot</text>
  <text start="574.26" dur="4.8">of things took me a while what I found a</text>
  <text start="576.48" dur="5.7">lot of things anyway short video on that</text>
  <text start="579.06" dur="5.28">very short but they&amp;#39;re definitely from</text>
  <text start="582.18" dur="3.87">all and from all things that we can see</text>
  <text start="584.34" dur="5.16">outwardly were forced to pick through</text>
  <text start="586.05" dur="7.55">there is most almost certainly a grand</text>
  <text start="589.5" dur="6.84">jury impaneled in the IG investigation</text>
  <text start="593.6" dur="6.67">especially in regards to Clinton&amp;#39;s email</text>
  <text start="596.34" dur="6.48">server which would envelop McCabe and</text>
  <text start="600.27" dur="4.53">then we&amp;#39;re looking at FISA and the</text>
