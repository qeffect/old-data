  <text start="87.96" dur="4.019">Hannity tonight we have a short opening</text>
  <text start="89.79" dur="3.75">monologue now Democrats they continue to</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="4.261">make the claim that the Russian</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="4.95">government is directly tied to the 2016</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="4.5">election hacking and with weeks to go</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="4.379">before he leaves office President Obama</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="3.839">announced sanctions against Russia and</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="3.75">also the FBI in the Department of</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="4.921">Homeland Security they released a</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="4.371">coinciding report supposedly containing</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="4.11">evidence that the Russian government</text>
  <text start="110.99" dur="5.589">coordinated all these cyber attacks but</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="6.24">that report gives very few details and a</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="5.011">massive big disclaimer now Democrats</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="4.14">were also pointing a finger at the group</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="4.86">WikiLeaks claiming that Russian hackers</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="4.71">provided them with thousands of emails</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="4.74">from the DNC and from Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="4.93">campaign chairman John Podesta now these</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="5.62">emails contained explosive detail</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="5.79">exposing corruption Media collusion with</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="5.37">the Clinton campaign and downright dirty</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="4.44">politics all the way around so in light</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="3.3">of all these new developments well I</text>
  <text start="143.86" dur="4.32">decided to go straight to the source</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="4.83">over this ongoing controversy so</text>
  <text start="148.18" dur="3.78">yesterday I traveled to London to sit</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="4.29">down with WikiLeaks founder Julian</text>
  <text start="151.96" dur="5.1">Assange in an attempt to set the record</text>
  <text start="154.6" dur="4.8">straight now he rarely does these</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="4.77">exclusive long-form interviews given the</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="3.87">nature of his current situation now for</text>
  <text start="161.83" dur="4.38">four and a half years he has been</text>
  <text start="163.27" dur="5.01">confined at the Ecuadorian Embassy where</text>
  <text start="166.21" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;s not seen the light of day and all</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="3.75">that time so Assange of course he</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="3.93">founded the group WikiLeaks that was</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="4.65">back in 2006 and in the years following</text>
  <text start="174.49" dur="3.84">he made international headlines after</text>
  <text start="176.68" dur="3.69">releasing hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="178.33" dur="4.8">classified US government documents and</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="5.16">in 2010 he was detained in England after</text>
  <text start="183.13" dur="4.71">Swedish officials issued an arrest</text>
  <text start="185.53" dur="4.8">warrant over allegations that he may</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="4.47">have sexually assaulted two women as a</text>
  <text start="190.33" dur="3.51">charge which he will respond to later in</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="4.53">this program tonight in this interview</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="5.13">now in 2012 he was granted asylum in the</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="4.65">Ecuadorian Embassy in the City of London</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="5.64">you know he&amp;#39;s been living there ever</text>
  <text start="201.49" dur="5.31">since in very very confined tiny</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="3.87">quarters so in this wide-ranging</text>
  <text start="206.8" dur="2.79">interview which we will show for the</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="3.6">entire hour tonight</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="5.49">Assange told me what drives him to</text>
  <text start="212.08" dur="5.79">expose government and media corruption</text>
  <text start="215.08" dur="6.63">take a look let me start with the</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="6.9">American elections and from your</text>
  <text start="221.71" dur="5.91">perspective how big a role do you feel</text>
  <text start="224.77" dur="4.14">WikiLeaks had in the outcome of the</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="2.13">election you didn&amp;#39;t think Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="2.88">was gonna win</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="5.25">I didn&amp;#39;t think Donald Trump would win I</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="6.87">thought the are the establishment water</text>
  <text start="235" dur="6.03">one of a better word would see Hillary</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="4.86">Clinton losing and then we&amp;#39;d pile in</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="4.679">more money and more energy in various TV</text>
  <text start="243.52" dur="5.37">networks or on her side and make sure</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="4.411">that she won I think that analysis was</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="5.61">still correct but it missed something</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="5.97">fundamental which is that the amount of</text>
  <text start="254.5" dur="5.39">investment to the Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="5.09">campaign was in proportion to the degree</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="3.44">that the</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="5.4">garnishment thought that she would lose</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="5.35">and she was aggressively for projecting</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="4.95">that she would be the inevitable winner</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="5.75">and was above you know five ten points</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="6.24">in the appian point so she only got a</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="6.4">billion and a half directed into her</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="5.28">campaign if they thought she was going</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.08">to lose maybe she would have gotten five</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="3.989">billion we&amp;#39;d see a different result it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="3.379">very interesting post-election and it</text>
  <text start="287.039" dur="5.431">didn&amp;#39;t even really happen immediately</text>
  <text start="288.289" dur="6.671">but the narrative has begun that in fact</text>
  <text start="292.47" dur="5.91">the US government is accusing WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="5.88">of having received materials from Russia</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="4.8">and Russia cyber criminals with the</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="4.56">political agenda of influencing the</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="6.06">election and obviously they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="7.53">not just about the John Podesta emails</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="5.13">the DNC emails but in other ways I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="5.489">asked you before I&amp;#39;ll ask you again</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="6.329">today did Russia give you this</text>
  <text start="318.419" dur="6.151">information or anybody associated with</text>
  <text start="320.699" dur="8.601">Russia our source is not a state party</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="7.56">so the answer for our interactions is no</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="4.39">but if we look at the most recent</text>
  <text start="332.13" dur="5.279">statement by the u.s. column which is on</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="5.46">the 29th of December okay we had five</text>
  <text start="337.409" dur="7.281">different branches of government</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="10.85">Treasury DHS FBI White House presenting</text>
  <text start="344.69" dur="7.39">their accusations to underpin Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350" dur="5.199">throwing out thirty five Russian</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="6.149">diplomats what was missing from all of</text>
  <text start="355.199" dur="4.681">those statements the word WikiLeaks it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="4.771">very strange</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="6.15">now my interpretation is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363" dur="4.979">either not surprisingly a problem they</text>
  <text start="366.03" dur="3.12">feel with the evidence as far as</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="3.69">WikiLeaks is concerned</text>
  <text start="369.15" dur="4.259">well James clapper said we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="3.691">how WikiLeaks got this information we</text>
  <text start="373.409" dur="6.63">don&amp;#39;t know when WikiLeaks got this</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="8.19">information but let&amp;#39;s imagine that they</text>
  <text start="380.039" dur="5.671">are saying okay the problem here is that</text>
  <text start="383.55" dur="5.73">WikiLeaks published information</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="7.47">now what are they saying WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="5.669">published true information to the</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="5.459">American public read that information</text>
  <text start="394.949" dur="6.511">was the words of Hillary Clinton and her</text>
  <text start="398.639" dur="5.191">campaign manager John Podesta and other</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="4.679">people in her campaign and the American</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="5.52">public read that information true</text>
  <text start="406.139" dur="8.551">information and said we don&amp;#39;t like these</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="7.319">people and then voted accordingly that</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="6.03">is not sustainable so what they want to</text>
  <text start="416.669" dur="8.761">do instead is conflate our publication</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="7.919">of true information with say hacking or</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="6.6">rather alleged hacking of us vote</text>
  <text start="428.639" dur="5.46">counting machines and even Obama&amp;#39;s had</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="4.74">to admit that there has been no hacking</text>
  <text start="434.099" dur="6.271">of us but no evidence for that so but</text>
  <text start="436.77" dur="6.06">the main focus for most Americans they</text>
  <text start="440.37" dur="4.139">are being told by Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="4.619">campaign by the President of the United</text>
  <text start="444.509" dur="4.951">States there are the Department of</text>
  <text start="447.449" dur="2.97">Homeland Security the author Office of</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="6.72">the Director of National Intelligence</text>
  <text start="450.419" dur="8.401">etc that in fact WikiLeaks was working</text>
  <text start="456.18" dur="5.549">with the Russian government to influence</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="4.86">the election is that true in any way</text>
  <text start="461.729" dur="4.56">shape matter reform no that&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="463.68" dur="4.83">false and if you read their statements</text>
  <text start="466.289" dur="5.94">carefully you&amp;#39;ll see they don&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="468.51" dur="6.36">say that they kind of mentioned one fact</text>
  <text start="472.229" dur="7.111">here and one fact there and nothing else</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="7.59">in the most up-to-date information and</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="5.28">the 29th of December where the FBI DHS</text>
  <text start="482.46" dur="4.65">White House successor made a statement</text>
  <text start="484.62" dur="6.299">what is completely absent from all those</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="7.049">statements is WikiLeaks totally absent</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="7.231">so what&amp;#39;s going on well I believe two</text>
  <text start="494.159" dur="6.361">things are going on number one they</text>
  <text start="498.15" dur="4.949">don&amp;#39;t have the evidence that WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="4.59">is involved in that way now why am i</text>
  <text start="503.099" dur="5.011">confident about that well because there</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="5.19">is one person in the world and I think</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="6.41">it&amp;#39;s actually only one who knows exactly</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="6.47">what is going on with our publications</text>
  <text start="514.52" dur="3.3">and that&amp;#39;s me can you say to the</text>
  <text start="516.77" dur="4.56">American people</text>
  <text start="517.82" dur="6.9">unequivocally that you did not get this</text>
  <text start="521.33" dur="4.92">information about the DNC John Podesta</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="3.75">see males can you tell the American</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="3.839">people a thousand percent you did not</text>
  <text start="528.47" dur="5.25">get it from Russia or everybody</text>
  <text start="530.089" dur="6.631">associated with Russia we can say we</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="7.26">have said repeatedly over the last two</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="7.14">months that our sauce is not the Russian</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="5.669">government and it is not a state party</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="5.19">there was one report in The Daily Mail</text>
  <text start="546.649" dur="4.861">that suggested somebody that you are</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="5.34">friendly with actually was handed the</text>
  <text start="551.51" dur="6.36">documents at American University in a</text>
  <text start="554.39" dur="7.699">wooded area by a disgruntled Democrat</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="6.589">who felt betrayed because they the</text>
  <text start="562.089" dur="5.681">revelations showed that Bernie Sanders</text>
  <text start="564.459" dur="5.261">had been betrayed and they didn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="567.77" dur="3.78">the corruption of the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="569.72" dur="3.78">can you confirm or deny that is that</text>
  <text start="571.55" dur="6.03">story well that statement came from</text>
  <text start="573.5" dur="6.74">Craig Murray he sounded a friend of mine</text>
  <text start="577.58" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s been being hit several times but</text>
  <text start="580.24" dur="5.41">WikiLeaks is a source protection</text>
  <text start="581.9" dur="6">organization we are famous for never</text>
  <text start="585.65" dur="5.16">having exposed one of our sources over</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="6.78">10 years that&amp;#39;s why sources trust us and</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="7.71">they come to us so I can&amp;#39;t comment on</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="7.5">other people&amp;#39;s statements about our</text>
  <text start="598.52" dur="6.87">sources except to say what we have said</text>
  <text start="602.18" dur="5.19">which is that our sources are not a</text>
  <text start="605.39" dur="5.46">state party and ask you this have you</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="5.61">ever talked to Vladimir Putin no have</text>
  <text start="610.85" dur="4.23">you ever talked to any of his surrogates</text>
  <text start="612.98" dur="5.94">no have you ever talked to Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="5.22">know any of his surrogates no not one it</text>
  <text start="618.92" dur="3.12">was seven report that you might have</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="3.75">talked to somebody who was not</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="4.56">associated with the campaign Roger stone</text>
  <text start="624.05" dur="7.19">no that&amp;#39;s false I think where this Roger</text>
  <text start="626.6" dur="9.239">stone claim is coming from is there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="631.24" dur="7.27">radio guy on WBAI which is a mutual</text>
  <text start="635.839" dur="4.201">friend who was who wanted to come and</text>
  <text start="638.51" dur="4.35">see me to see if I would set up a radio</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="4.77">show on WVIA that he</text>
  <text start="642.86" dur="4.17">he did come to London but he didn&amp;#39;t meet</text>
  <text start="644.81" dur="4.05">with me so if the US government is</text>
  <text start="647.03" dur="4.5">accusing wikileaks of having received</text>
  <text start="648.86" dur="5.13">these materials from russia and you say</text>
  <text start="651.53" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s false it did not come from russia</text>
  <text start="653.99" dur="4.05">and the president of the united states</text>
  <text start="656.3" dur="3.9">is advancing the narrative is the</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="5.07">President of the United States lying to</text>
  <text start="660.2" dur="5.28">the American people well he&amp;#39;s acting</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="4.86">like a lawyer if you look at most of his</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="6.57">statements he doesn&amp;#39;t say that he</text>
  <text start="667.97" dur="6.09">doesn&amp;#39;t say WikiLeaks obtained its</text>
  <text start="672.05" dur="4.35">information from Russia worked with</text>

  <text start="943.6" dur="5.07">stupid maneuver it&amp;#39;s the same reason why</text>
  <text start="946.21" dur="5.61">they lost the election which is instead</text>
  <text start="948.67" dur="5.25">of focusing on substance they focus on</text>

  <text start="956.86" dur="4.53">little comment by Trump here and here</text>
  <text start="959.23" dur="5.64">and there for example all this attempt</text>
  <text start="961.39" dur="5.58">to say that that how outrageous it is</text>
  <text start="964.87" dur="4.17">that the American public received true</text>

  <text start="978.07" dur="5.52">equally release that yes absolutely it</text>
