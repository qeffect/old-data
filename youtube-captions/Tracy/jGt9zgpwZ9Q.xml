  <text start="321.06" dur="5.25">11:00</text>
  <text start="321.66" dur="8.91">I think the 11 o&amp;#39;clock or the 12 Z I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="337.82" dur="5.83">there we are 66 hours there we are 72 so</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="3.63">you can see the storms basically riding</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="5.1">up the coast there it is on South</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="6.93">Carolina and basically fully and then it</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="6.78">hits there 84 hours and then it just</text>
  <text start="352.71" dur="4.08">kind of goes through it clips New Jersey</text>
  <text start="355.53" dur="3.87">and it looks like it&amp;#39;s gonna hit the</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="5.22">Virginia the Outer Banks and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="6.21">gonna kind of grab the end of Long</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="5.67">Island and it&amp;#39;s gonna fly off there so a</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="4.32">Miss and a hard right turn would be</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="3.9">fantastic</text>
  <text start="369.93" dur="4.739">but I said in the podcast today like</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="5.94">honestly you know it living on the coast</text>
  <text start="374.669" dur="5.371">is actually beautiful and you take a</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="4.62">risk when you do and you know the risk</text>
  <text start="380.04" dur="5.09">when you move there and so that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="4.83">something that you have to deal with</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="4.42">it&amp;#39;s just something that you got to deal</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="5.36">with and you know to be honest like here</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="7.89">it is again this is the GE PS the</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="7.269">ensemble and here is the storm on our 42</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="4.67">so about two days from now and then it</text>
  <text start="399.599" dur="2.511">takes it up</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="6.759">that way uh let&amp;#39;s just look at the</text>
  <text start="406.61" dur="8.529">European think this is the European and</text>
  <text start="409.139" dur="8.31">the GE uh GFS together and same thing</text>
  <text start="415.139" dur="3.75">here basically and there is the center</text>

  <text start="439.169" dur="6.631">like this model here because I listen to</text>
  <text start="442.349" dur="5.97">Levi and he&amp;#39;s so good he teaches you why</text>
  <text start="445.8" dur="4.23">things happen and this one this model</text>
  <text start="448.319" dur="3.78">which measures like the depth of the</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="6">vortex better than many cuz it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="452.099" dur="7.141">hurricane model this one had the storm</text>
  <text start="456.03" dur="6.24">coming onshore in Florida until this</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="5.22">morning&amp;#39;s run because in the 11 p.m.</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="3.869">last night it still had it coming</text>
  <text start="464.46" dur="3.9">onshore going into Central Florida but</text>
  <text start="466.139" dur="6.84">this one does not and these are more</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="6.179">accurate because we are closer to time</text>
  <text start="472.979" dur="3.66">of impact and right now they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="474.539" dur="4.291">waiting for this high to move to let</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="4.5">this thing make the turn the sooner that</text>
  <text start="478.83" dur="4.23">happens the sooner it&amp;#39;ll make the turn</text>
  <text start="481.139" dur="3.721">so that&amp;#39;s what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="483.06" dur="3.72">but anyway here it is the eyewall</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="5.399">staying off the coast on this model and</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="4.889">then scrolling up it hits right around</text>
  <text start="490.259" dur="4.5">Charleston it looks like in South</text>
  <text start="491.669" dur="5.34">Carolina and then it moves up the coast</text>
  <text start="494.759" dur="6.571">through Myrtle Beach and into North</text>
  <text start="497.009" dur="9.931">Carolina and then off so there&amp;#39;s that</text>
