  <text start="0.5" dur="7.9">good morning it is 1106 a.m. on 415 2018</text>
  <text start="5.73" dur="5.46">I&amp;#39;m really sorry about the sound I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="8.4" dur="3.84">know why it cut off I&amp;#39;m not sure I know</text>
  <text start="11.19" dur="2.73">that there&amp;#39;s a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="12.24" dur="5.58">commenting that the sound I said again</text>
  <text start="13.92" dur="5.4">was my sound uh so sorry about that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="17.82" dur="2.879">gonna do a quick video just to sum</text>
  <text start="19.32" dur="3.51">summarize what I said at the end</text>
  <text start="20.699" dur="5.281">basically I said what is going on with</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="5.67">this Oh IG report what is going on with</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="5.49">with what happened on that laptop it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="5.1">been radio silence and some of the some</text>
  <text start="31.47" dur="4.589">of the train of thought that I have and</text>
  <text start="33.6" dur="3.9">I I&amp;#39;m always an eternal optimist so I</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="3.601">hate to be like they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="37.5" dur="3.629">anything about this I really think that</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a good chance that this</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="4.981">investigation is ongoing we know that</text>
  <text start="44.1" dur="3.81">they have a grand jury impaneled in New</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="4.17">York based off of other things that we</text>
  <text start="47.91" dur="6.149">see coming out of Congress and stuff so</text>
  <text start="50.28" dur="6.689">my thought is that the OIG report here</text>
  <text start="54.059" dur="5.52">mentions Eric garner very specifically</text>
  <text start="56.969" dur="5.25">for this reason and it sounds crazy but</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="4.591">that could be possibly true that the OIG</text>
  <text start="62.219" dur="3.571">report mentions Eric garner because</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="3.809">they&amp;#39;re gonna come and circle around to</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="3.06">this later and they can&amp;#39;t mention it</text>
  <text start="67.979" dur="3.841">because there&amp;#39;s an ongoing investigation</text>
  <text start="68.85" dur="5.97">I don&amp;#39;t understand why it would take two</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="5.4">full years now for them to get back to</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="5.04">this obviously it&amp;#39;s clear there was a</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="6.66">bunch of horrible horrific nasty stuff</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="8.25">found on that laptop you know weiners</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="8.4">got a less than justified sentence in</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.939">the whole deal and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s frustrating</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="4.01">if nothing comes to this if nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.049" dur="5.041">prosecuted for this stuff it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="96.29" dur="4.18">really disappointing and you know</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="2.7">there&amp;#39;s gonna come a time and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="2.609">discussing this with a lot of people</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="3.21">where we&amp;#39;re gonna need to get a little</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="3.871">louder if we don&amp;#39;t start to see some</text>
  <text start="105" dur="3.869">indictments I am up the firm belief that</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="5.099">we&amp;#39;re going to see these indictments</text>
  <text start="108.869" dur="4.89">I really am I follow my instincts quite</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.231">a bit and I know you guys notice that</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="5.701">throughout my reporting and I always try</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="4.92">to look at things objectively and come</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="4.17">at them very objectively trying to</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="5.01">disprove my original theory that I have</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="5.04">so I set out saying you&amp;#39;re wrong Traci</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="4.22">find why you&amp;#39;re wrong and then I try to</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="4.17">poke holes in it and happen sometimes</text>
  <text start="130.43" dur="3.25">sometimes my initial thought gets blown</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="2.129">out of the water and</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="2.46">come back around then it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="134.969" dur="3.781">completely different than I thought I</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="4.26">was looking for in the beginning a lot</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="3.329">of times that doesn&amp;#39;t happen a lot of</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="4.44">the times I&amp;#39;m right and I will tell you</text>
  <text start="142.079" dur="5.071">with everything inside of me I fully</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="5.61">believe that we&amp;#39;re going to see people</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="6.809">go down for this stuff I really do</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="6.629">honestly I don&amp;#39;t see any other way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost like when I was I was</text>
  <text start="157.079" dur="3.39">voting for Donald Trump and the</text>
  <text start="158.28" dur="3.81">president&amp;#39;s for the presidency and</text>
  <text start="160.469" dur="3.3">everyone said there&amp;#39;s no way he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="3.36">win there&amp;#39;s no way he&amp;#39;s gonna win this</text>
  <text start="163.769" dur="5.011">isn&amp;#39;t gonna happen blah blah blah and I</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="6.239">just knew in my heart the entire time</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="5.489">that there&amp;#39;s only so long that evil can</text>
  <text start="171.689" dur="5.101">kind of rule the day and that time is</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="4.92">coming to an end and I just feel it I</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="3.839">know that&amp;#39;s not good enough I know</text>
  <text start="179.189" dur="2.821">that&amp;#39;s not good enough I know that I</text>
  <text start="180.629" dur="3.42">need to show you guys and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="182.01" dur="4.17">showing you why I feel that this is true</text>
  <text start="184.049" dur="5.31">with factual information with court</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="4.649">documents with testimony with proving</text>
  <text start="189.359" dur="3.36">the grand jury before it was out in</text>
  <text start="190.829" dur="5.011">public you know all those things that we</text>
  <text start="192.719" dur="4.77">do and I have no doubt in my mind that</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="4.59">there is still something cooking about</text>
  <text start="197.489" dur="6.03">this I really I really believe it I</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="5.399">can&amp;#39;t show you it right now so you know</text>
  <text start="203.519" dur="5.4">trust me is never a good thing to say as</text>
  <text start="205.829" dur="3.541">always I implore you guys to do your own</text>
  <text start="208.919" dur="3.301">research</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="5.19">backchecked me rip me apart if you can</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="3.84">with facts and I&amp;#39;ll admit MIT if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="2.009">wrong somewhere and I&amp;#39;ll clarify it for</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="3.329">everyone</text>
  <text start="216.569" dur="4.89">never afraid to do that I have a lot</text>
  <text start="219.389" dur="5.041">more stuff coming up I am so busy I</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="4.98">spent a good I would say in total 24</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="4.35">hours breaking down that oh I G report</text>
  <text start="226.439" dur="4.591">because I just knew there was going to</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="4.47">be something in there that was gonna</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="5.34">blow our minds and I spent so much time</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="7.5">on it and I found it this is massive in</text>
  <text start="236.37" dur="5.88">my opinion very very big and so um I</text>
  <text start="240.75" dur="4.829">have a lot of stuff I&amp;#39;m working on right</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="6.03">now the Kohen thing is not what it</text>
  <text start="245.579" dur="4.4">appears on the surface I am Telling You</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="6.06">I&amp;#39;m gonna show you I&amp;#39;m gonna break down</text>
  <text start="249.979" dur="6.341">the Kohen quote raid for you guys so</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="4.319">that you can see in no uncertain terms</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="5.25">there is a lot more going on with that</text>
  <text start="258.659" dur="6.241">than what we&amp;#39;re being told it is not the</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="5.279">FBI rated Michael Cohen&amp;#39;s office and</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="2.64">they took privileged information there</text>
  <text start="266.849" dur="3.901">was a</text>
  <text start="267.54" dur="5.13">an injunction made by the President to</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="4.71">stop that information whatever it may</text>
  <text start="272.67" dur="4.65">have been between Cohen and him from</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="4.56">being used it was granted that is not an</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="4.62">on issue anymore it&amp;#39;s a very hot topic a</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="4.71">lot of people are pissed off that you</text>
  <text start="281.94" dur="5.52">know attorney-client privilege was</text>
  <text start="284.73" dur="6.69">breached my argument to that is honestly</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="5.67">if of course I&amp;#39;m a massive Trump support</text>
  <text start="291.42" dur="3.33">this is nothing to do with that this is</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="3.9">just an objective look at the facts if</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s the case and the FBI can never</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="2.82">look at anything that an attorney is</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="3.3">doing because of attorney-client</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="4.26">privilege then every intern attorney</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="4.71">walking this this earth can commit</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="4.29">horrible atrocities and hide them inside</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="3.75">of attorney-client privilege so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="3.09">got to be a line drawn somewhere so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="3">working on that for you guys</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="4.44">and then the next thing I&amp;#39;m working on</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="5.49">is a legitimate look from both sides</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="5.58">completely objectively no emotion</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="4.89">involved just laying it out there Muller</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="5.46">as a white hat Mueller as a black hat</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="6.09">both sides and there&amp;#39;s a really good</text>
  <text start="326.97" dur="4.89">case for both there&amp;#39;s a really good case</text>
  <text start="329.79" dur="3.69">for the fact that Mueller is going after</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="3.42">Trump this is a shitshow of an</text>
  <text start="333.48" dur="4.35">investigation it&amp;#39;s gone roll gets all</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="4.41">over the place they&amp;#39;re doing nothing to</text>
  <text start="337.83" dur="4.35">help Trump it&amp;#39;s gonna be like Dan bond</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="4.17">Geno always says they&amp;#39;re investigating a</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="3.51">person not a crime it&amp;#39;s not gonna end</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="3.96">right and then there&amp;#39;s a really good</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="4.17">case for the fact that that may not be</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="4.23">what&amp;#39;s going on at all and I think that</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s only fair to present both</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="3.72">sides to you guys so you guys can make</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="3.72">the determination for yourselves we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="3.84">never gonna know until we start seeing</text>
  <text start="357.18" dur="3.93">the wrap-up of this thing and I know</text>
  <text start="359.61" dur="3.21">that I&amp;#39;m going out on a limb and people</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="4.17">think I&amp;#39;m absolutely crazy for even</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="5.34">leaning towards the white hat theory but</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="6.06">I can&amp;#39;t ignore what I&amp;#39;m seeing and I</text>
  <text start="368.16" dur="4.98">can&amp;#39;t ignore what I just can&amp;#39;t and you</text>
