  <text start="152.29" dur="5.339">what you may call a like normal American</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="4.47">and despite what I do for a living he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.629" dur="4.351">actually far less involved in the</text>
  <text start="159.61" dur="4.17">minutia of what&amp;#39;s going on around the</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="4.02">country than I am and he started talking</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="4.079">about impeachment and he stressed that</text>
  <text start="166" dur="3.299">he&amp;#39;s worried about the direction the</text>
  <text start="167.859" dur="4.561">country&amp;#39;s headed what the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="5.731">gonna do etc so here&amp;#39;s a profile of my</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="5.49">husband he considered himself a Democrat</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="5.4">for years voted for Barack Obama in in</text>
  <text start="177.91" dur="5.639">past elections he was disaffected with</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="6.059">the Republican Party pro-choice anti-war</text>
  <text start="183.549" dur="4.83">more accepting of government regulation</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="3.771">and intervention and he really couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="188.379" dur="4.821">bring himself to like vibe with</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="4.96">Republicans having someone of the same</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="4.27">stereotypical view many younger people</text>
  <text start="195.22" dur="4.829">have like stuffy old white men who got</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="4.919">rich off of Warren oil and not thinking</text>
  <text start="200.049" dur="5.581">about the little guy and so eight years</text>
  <text start="202.389" dur="5.28">of Obama kind of woke him up as he came</text>
  <text start="205.63" dur="4.199">to understand how bad Obama care was for</text>
  <text start="207.669" dur="4.5">everyday Americans how poorly we were</text>
  <text start="209.829" dur="3.601">doing economically while still handing</text>
  <text start="212.169" dur="4.111">over most of our money to the government</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.07">for these programs that did a lot to</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="5.099">help the poor but nothing to help a</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="5.819">struggling middle class paying for it</text>
  <text start="221.379" dur="4.531">all so he held his nose in 2016 and he</text>
  <text start="224.319" dur="4.98">voted for Donald Trump and after</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="7.62">watching the crazy incessant attacks and</text>
  <text start="229.299" dur="6.361">extremism from the left over the past</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="5.45">three years or so four years since</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="6.389">campaign he&amp;#39;s become more and more</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="5.11">frightened of the party that he once</text>
  <text start="242.049" dur="4.291">considered himself a part of so he now</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="5.22">considers himself a quote conservative</text>
  <text start="246.34" dur="5.31">or quote Republican even though he</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="4.35">doesn&amp;#39;t agree with some of the positions</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="4.589">the party holds just because he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="4.829">imagine like ever aligning himself with</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="4.441">what the left has become the party that</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="3.781">he once knew is gone and what has</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="3.299">replaced it is something that he</text>
  <text start="262.27" dur="5.28">couldn&amp;#39;t imagine in his wildest</text>
  <text start="263.979" dur="5.28">nightmares and to be honest</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="3.51">I think this is true of a lot of people</text>
  <text start="269.259" dur="4.44">that were at least moderate or</text>
  <text start="271.06" dur="7.41">considered themselves more like JFK</text>
  <text start="273.699" dur="7.53">Democrats pence walk away you know blogs</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="4.289">it etc all these movements where people</text>
  <text start="281.229" dur="5.43">are getting together to walk away from</text>
  <text start="282.759" dur="6.481">what the left he&amp;#39;s a moderate everyday</text>
  <text start="286.659" dur="5.19">American disagrees with presidents</text>
  <text start="289.24" dur="4.889">tweets sometimes disagrees with what he</text>
  <text start="291.849" dur="3.871">doesn&amp;#39;t says how he acts sometimes so</text>
  <text start="294.129" dur="2.76">this morning when he expressed concern</text>
  <text start="295.72" dur="3">about the impeachment of a president</text>
  <text start="296.889" dur="3.84">over an issue he really doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="298.72" dur="4.65">have all the details about but</text>
  <text start="300.729" dur="3.87">understands fundamentally isn&amp;#39;t true it</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="3.87">allowed us to have this great</text>
  <text start="304.599" dur="4.261">conversation about what the landscape is</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="3.269">here in America as a whole and how</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="4.2">important this time in history is and</text>
  <text start="310.509" dur="4.291">sort of how we got to where we are so I</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="3.15">knew I needed to start with the</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="4.23">background first and that&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.65">what I did I just listened to this</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="4.68">amazing interview on American salt</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="5.04">leaders where yawn is interviewing</text>
  <text start="323.71" dur="4.769">Victor Davis Hanson who is a historian</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="5.16">and just a amazing wealth of knowledge</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="3.831">and I heard him basically confirm all of</text>
  <text start="331.06" dur="4.8">the things that I had already</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="5.59">contemplated and he even mentioned this</text>
  <text start="335.86" dur="7.339">I decided it would be best to start at</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="10.109">explaining the 16 year plan so the</text>
  <text start="343.199" dur="6.52">progressives the Socialists etc have</text>
  <text start="348.009" dur="4.02">been working for decades to</text>
  <text start="349.719" dur="3.931">fundamentally shape the way the country</text>
  <text start="352.029" dur="3.69">thinks and conducts its business and</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="5.129">they did it using the education system</text>
  <text start="355.719" dur="5.67">colleges and universities Culture Media</text>
  <text start="358.779" dur="6.54">Hollywood and music technology social</text>
  <text start="361.389" dur="7.161">media and a big tech monopoly and they</text>
  <text start="365.319" dur="6.47">were able to form a comparatively small</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="6.669">but very vocal and active sort of</text>
  <text start="371.789" dur="5.59">extremist wing within the Democrat Party</text>
  <text start="375.219" dur="3.991">and they did this through a variety of</text>
  <text start="377.379" dur="4.38">means but mostly through identity</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="5.069">politics some other tactics but it was</text>
  <text start="381.759" dur="4.981">mostly through identity politics and in</text>
  <text start="384.279" dur="3.841">the beginning the identity politics game</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="4.229">worked for them because they were able</text>
  <text start="388.12" dur="6">to create many oppressed classes of</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="5.401">people and all of them needed support</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="4.65">and were victims and ultimately that</text>
  <text start="396.37" dur="4.56">support came through force and when I</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="4.619">say force in this instance it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="6.35">Devine defined as like taxation</text>
  <text start="403.389" dur="7.471">regulation even even public shaming and</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="6.04">this progressed for years and we saw it</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="4.679">percolating in each potential you know</text>
  <text start="413.32" dur="4.14">political race where a Democrat</text>
  <text start="415.539" dur="4.771">candidate and the media would call a</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="4.65">Republican Kennedy a racist or sexist or</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="3.449">bigoted and the Republican candidate</text>
  <text start="422.11" dur="4.529">would kind of cower away in shame</text>
  <text start="423.759" dur="4.651">despite in most cases those allegations</text>
  <text start="426.639" dur="4.971">being completely false and this is a</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="9.06">tactic that has been refined and used</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="7.3">much more so you know now as we&amp;#39;ve as</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="6.479">we&amp;#39;ve been moving on through the past</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="6.39">several years so given the power that</text>
  <text start="443.949" dur="4.551">had been granted to them by their</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="5.76">co-opting and by you know tacit approval</text>
  <text start="448.5" dur="4.599">by the institutions that we listed just</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="5.25">a second ago they were able to actually</text>
  <text start="453.099" dur="5.731">run roughshod over competition they were</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="4.199">able to take a stronger foothold over</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="4.41">the body politic and this didn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="460.509" dur="5.22">that they changed the minds of most</text>
  <text start="463.24" dur="6.239">Americans it meant that those Americans</text>
  <text start="465.729" dur="7.291">grew silent in a sort of self-inflicted</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="5.611">gag order that they placed over</text>
  <text start="473.02" dur="3.66">themselves and that stopped him from</text>
  <text start="475.09" dur="4.259">really fighting against what they knew</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="4.109">was morally wrong for feel fear of</text>
  <text start="479.349" dur="6.871">alienating their friends their family</text>
  <text start="480.789" dur="8.461">for being ridiculed etc so when Barack</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="6.509">Obama was elected it began what came to</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="5.55">be known now as the sixteen year plan so</text>
  <text start="492.729" dur="4.171">for decades and even under Republican</text>
  <text start="494.8" dur="4.29">leadership this is not just a Democrat</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="4.799">thing the country was inching towards</text>
  <text start="499.09" dur="6.24">this more globalist view of the world</text>
  <text start="501.699" dur="5.611">and the goal was to make that you know</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="3.959">the end result that was to make it so</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="3.81">because the institution still had</text>
  <text start="509.289" dur="4.201">control of the populace as thought</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="5.28">patterns through television and movies</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="5.159">etc the media they were able to even use</text>
  <text start="516.4" dur="4.879">Republicans who were very very willing</text>
  <text start="518.649" dur="5.221">and able to advance these goals</text>
  <text start="521.279" dur="4.421">Republicans and Democrats over the past</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="3.93">few decades they presented themselves as</text>
  <text start="525.7" dur="4.02">different from one another in actuality</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="4.65">guys they were very much aligned with</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="4.62">many of the same goals we need to be</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="3.72">richer give us more control</text>
  <text start="534.34" dur="3.48">over you we&amp;#39;re gonna say what you want</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="3.09">to hear but we&amp;#39;re gonna do something</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="3.32">completely different and your first</text>
  <text start="539.26" dur="5.28">forced to deal with that you&amp;#39;re forced</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="6.01">it&amp;#39;s a big club and you ain&amp;#39;t in it this</text>
  <text start="544.54" dur="5.88">is just the way it is however when Obama</text>
  <text start="547.15" dur="5.3">was elected we actually the country here</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="4.71">really began this fundamental shift</text>
  <text start="552.45" dur="5.47">towards this more quote globalist</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="5.04">mindset so well so while so many people</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="4.17">even moderates included thought when he</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="4.62">was elected that Obama would mark this</text>
  <text start="562.09" dur="5.46">shift towards a more racially and</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="5.13">culturally accepting America we saw the</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="4.35">exact opposite on the country became</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="5.4">more polarized the rhetoric surrounding</text>
  <text start="571.9" dur="5.64">race and gender became more divisive we</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="4.44">began to see this new wave of feminists</text>
  <text start="577.54" dur="4.68">who had been quietly growing in the</text>
  <text start="579.76" dur="5.07">background began to take hold of a more</text>
  <text start="582.22" dur="5.58">powerful megaphone on television college</text>
  <text start="584.83" dur="4.62">campuses etc and this shift took many of</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="4.32">the moderate Americans who were more</text>
  <text start="589.45" dur="4.74">silent and sort of spawned the Tea Party</text>
  <text start="592.12" dur="3.39">there yeah that was a conservative</text>
  <text start="594.19" dur="3.03">movement but there were a lot of folks</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="4.38">in the Tea Party it was a revolution</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="4.23">they were sick of being forced to allow</text>
  <text start="599.89" dur="3.48">the government more control over their</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="4.02">lives they were sick of the endless wars</text>
  <text start="603.37" dur="4.71">they were sick of entitlements that did</text>
  <text start="605.47" dur="4.14">nothing to help most families but took</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="3.72">money from them and enslaved an</text>
  <text start="609.61" dur="4.2">ever-growing entitlement class they were</text>
