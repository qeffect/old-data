  <text start="169.7" dur="6.17">they do it doesn&amp;#39;t take this long but</text>
  <text start="171.799" dur="8.521">anyway I digress so yesterday we had a</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="9.19">ridiculously insane interview from the</text>
  <text start="180.32" dur="6.479">former CEO of overstock.com and so I was</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="3.36">pulling together clips on this to try</text>
  <text start="186.799" dur="4.171">and walk it walk through it with you</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="4.349">guys he did an interview on Fox and he</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="5.01">did an interview on CNN with Chris Cuomo</text>
  <text start="192.769" dur="5.19">and I came across a video where the</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="5.7">title of it was Alison Cammarata your</text>
  <text start="197.959" dur="5.821">favorite person Frank yeah she reacts</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="5.1">crazy to the interview with overstock</text>
  <text start="203.78" dur="4.17">CEO Byrne and so I wanted to just play</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="3.66">the beginning of it because it has</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="3.99">nothing to do with burn but I just</text>
  <text start="210.44" dur="3.6">wanted to go through this logic with</text>
  <text start="211.94" dur="4.549">everybody there talking with I think</text>
  <text start="214.04" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s cuccinelli about the immigration</text>
  <text start="216.489" dur="6.931">the Flores decision yeah the Flores</text>
  <text start="220.85" dur="4.4">decision is the thing that stopped them</text>
  <text start="223.42" dur="4.17">detaining families for longer than</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="5.91">twenty days and now that&amp;#39;s been reversed</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="5.369">so they can retain the families until</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="3.27">their hearing not indefinitely until</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="3.511">their hearing I just want to make that</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="4.65">clear she has a really long spot with</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="10.11">with him but let&amp;#39;s just listen listen to</text>
  <text start="239.08" dur="9.45">it - this took about 50 days that is not</text>
  <text start="246.58" dur="8.82">how it that is not how it worked when</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="9">this was being conducted was that thirty</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="3.899">percent of the children in the pilot</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="3.69">programs we were finding were being</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="6.151">recycled they&amp;#39;re being trafficked this</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="6.3">became a ticket to your bring children</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="3.51">became a ticket to get into the United</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="3">States because you had to be released</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="5.94">within 20 days I guess like relax</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="6.48">children I mean okay on one level of</text>
  <text start="274.9" dur="4.2">stress children but it also exposes them</text>
  <text start="277" dur="6.11">to the overcrowding I mean here&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="5.22">of the be wrong so Allison oh you Oh</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="5.46">Allison</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="7.28">Oh Allison you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re so smart</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="6.099">do you believe the logic that there</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="6.069">there is no logic she has to try to find</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="5.131">a way to navigate shits Creek that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.669" dur="4.62">what she&amp;#39;s trying to do she has to get</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="6.239">from point A to point B without actually</text>
  <text start="302.289" dur="7.231">using logic she like literally basically</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="5.791">just said that like saving kids from</text>
  <text start="309.52" dur="3.93">being trafficked what she admits is on</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="3.899">par with them having to be in a</text>
  <text start="313.45" dur="5.279">detention facility because their parents</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="5.371">broke the law like or the adults that</text>
  <text start="318.729" dur="4.771">dragged them along the desert broke the</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="4.2">law right it doesn&amp;#39;t not even a case I</text>
  <text start="323.5" dur="3.539">know what pilot program he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="4.739">about there I covered it on the show</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="4.621">that they they were just in I figure out</text>
  <text start="330.039" dur="2.581">what the sample size was it was the</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="3.45">swabbing right</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="5.19">yeah just small yeah they did a cheek</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="4.65">swab and what they did was they saw that</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="4.35">from just the people that they had</text>
  <text start="339.76" dur="4.469">piloted this program to make sure that</text>
  <text start="342.16" dur="5.7">children were with their actual parents</text>
  <text start="344.229" dur="6.901">that over 30 percent of those that they</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="5.73">swab Brandon Lee were not with a family</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="4.32">members yeah so so when Allison is</text>
  <text start="353.59" dur="4.169">confronted by this her first thing of</text>
  <text start="355.45" dur="5.01">all she can&amp;#39;t say she was she go</text>
  <text start="357.759" dur="5.37">say that that&amp;#39;s not good that were this</text>
  <text start="360.46" dur="4.769">could be a protective measure for kids</text>
  <text start="363.129" dur="4.051">that are being used by those who want to</text>
  <text start="365.229" dur="3.96">break the law and sneak into the country</text>
  <text start="367.18" dur="4.289">no she can&amp;#39;t come out and say that she</text>
  <text start="369.189" dur="6.181">knows how bad it is and she defaults to</text>
  <text start="371.469" dur="6.361">a weaker position of well but that still</text>
  <text start="375.37" dur="5.159">subjects them to detainment well don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="5.459">come I knew that would get your blood</text>
  <text start="380.529" dur="4.7">flowing it&amp;#39;s almost like you know what</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="4.5">it is it&amp;#39;s almost like with the whole</text>
  <text start="385.229" dur="5.65">deficit spending nonsense where you</text>
  <text start="387.789" dur="5.61">can&amp;#39;t cut taxes the deficit is going to</text>
  <text start="390.879" dur="6.051">explode the debt is going to explode</text>
  <text start="393.399" dur="7.561">because they can never consider to stop</text>
  <text start="396.93" dur="8.219">spending they&amp;#39;ll never consider that an</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="7.439">open flow of just just hoards of people</text>
  <text start="405.149" dur="5.35">coming from third-world countries with</text>
  <text start="408.399" dur="4.44">no prospects with no wiggle with low</text>
  <text start="410.499" dur="4.53">literacy rates but in completely</text>
  <text start="412.839" dur="5.22">skirting our immigration system they</text>
  <text start="415.029" dur="5.431">have there&amp;#39;s no considering that that</text>
  <text start="418.059" dur="5.4">needs to be in incent D incentivized</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="5.069">because they benefit from it if they</text>
  <text start="423.459" dur="7.08">didn&amp;#39;t benefit they would not be</text>
  <text start="425.529" dur="7.11">protecting it it&amp;#39;s yeah yeah nothing</text>
  <text start="430.539" dur="4.17">else to add to that that&amp;#39;s for sure they</text>
  <text start="432.639" dur="2.7">benefit in many different ways many</text>

  <text start="539.13" dur="6.899">mean so so look we get we get Patrick</text>
  <text start="544.14" dur="3.54">Byrne Sarah Carter a couple weeks ago</text>
  <text start="546.029" dur="3.091">came out with this story about Patrick</text>
  <text start="547.68" dur="3.779">Byrne and it was a little hard to follow</text>
  <text start="549.12" dur="5.52">and it was quickly put together where</text>
  <text start="551.459" dur="7.561">she said that he was working with the</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="8.67">FBI to kind of keep an eye on and</text>
  <text start="559.02" dur="8.04">eventually entrap um so he thought Maria</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="6.42">Bettina the Russian gun activist who was</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="5.85">arrested for failing to register as a</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="5.94">foreign agent and and convicted her case</text>
  <text start="572.91" dur="4.86">was ridiculous because they accused her</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="5.28">of being a prostitute they had to</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="6.27">withdraw that it was a big controversial</text>
  <text start="580.95" dur="5.16">case she got sentenced to 18 18 months</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="4.71">she&amp;#39;s out this October apparently I</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="5.43">guess because of time served or whatever</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="4.5">I don&amp;#39;t know so he comes forward to</text>
  <text start="591.54" dur="3.75">Sarah Carter and tells his story and it</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="3.6">kind of takes everybody by surprise did</text>
  <text start="595.29" dur="4.14">you get a chance to read the initial</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="4.41">story she wrote by chance uh no the only</text>
  <text start="599.43" dur="3.57">thing about this I have seen because</text>
  <text start="601.26" dur="7.439">everything else had just been tagged in</text>
  <text start="603" dur="7.89">was a really awful badly recorded cell</text>
  <text start="608.699" dur="3.901">phone to the television to cell phone</text>
  <text start="610.89" dur="4.29">recordings of what it was said last</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="6.27">night on Fox or wherever the hell he was</text>
  <text start="615.18" dur="5.24">but the original one I had heard was him</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="3.86">from Monday night the old</text>

  <text start="828.37" dur="3.48">those running the operation were not</text>

  <text start="833.91" dur="3.73">familiar with the possible backlash</text>

  <text start="861.64" dur="5.1">yes and everyone&amp;#39;s like oh my God he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="863.41" dur="5.25">CFR he&amp;#39;s bought off and paid for he you</text>
  <text start="866.74" dur="3.99">know what I mean um everybody assumed</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="3.33">that because I don&amp;#39;t even remember that</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="3.81">especially because of his personal</text>
  <text start="871.99" dur="5.7">politics isn&amp;#39;t he isn&amp;#39;t he a Democrat</text>
  <text start="874.54" dur="4.799">donor Buffett I think I believe so I</text>
  <text start="877.69" dur="3.089">don&amp;#39;t think that really much matters</text>
  <text start="879.339" dur="3.481">because he&amp;#39;s one of the purse-string</text>
  <text start="880.779" dur="3.691">holders right he&amp;#39;s one of the control</text>
  <text start="882.82" dur="2.73">he&amp;#39;s one of those names that you hear</text>
  <text start="884.47" dur="3.12">when you think about global</text>
  <text start="885.55" dur="4.53">in the lead etc so on and so forth like</text>
  <text start="887.59" dur="6.69">like the Koch brothers oh yes like</text>
  <text start="890.08" dur="6.45">likely now now passed on David Koch yeah</text>
  <text start="894.28" dur="4.41">who died today or yesterday or whenever</text>
  <text start="896.53" dur="3.78">he did yeah I didn&amp;#39;t look into it but I</text>
  <text start="898.69" dur="4.5">just got an email I got a text message</text>
  <text start="900.31" dur="4.8">about it prior to go on live mmhmm yeah</text>
  <text start="903.19" dur="5.37">so Buffett tells them to come forward</text>
  <text start="905.11" dur="4.89">with all this stuff um they sat with him</text>
  <text start="908.56" dur="3.12">apparently a bunch of journalists sat</text>
  <text start="910" dur="3.48">with him in New York City it was about</text>
  <text start="911.68" dur="4.29">three hours long completely on the</text>
  <text start="913.48" dur="5.76">record and videotaped the story that</text>
  <text start="915.97" dur="6.24">Byrne told was in seven parts and Sara</text>
  <text start="919.24" dur="4.71">Carter brought this to the FBI the FBI</text>
  <text start="922.21" dur="4.56">doesn&amp;#39;t comment on any of the</text>
  <text start="923.95" dur="4.92">allegations he made he says he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="926.77" dur="6.99">come further forward sooner because he</text>
  <text start="928.87" dur="6.42">was worried that he was worried that the</text>
  <text start="933.76" dur="3.27">people that were in charge there were</text>
  <text start="935.29" dur="3.63">not good guys and once Barr was</text>
  <text start="937.03" dur="3.45">confirmed he waited for justice to play</text>
  <text start="938.92" dur="3.36">out a little bit realized he was on</text>
  <text start="940.48" dur="3.48">strong footing with you know getting</text>
  <text start="942.28" dur="5.4">some results and went forward with the</text>
  <text start="943.96" dur="6.21">information um I&amp;#39;m reading I&amp;#39;m reading</text>
  <text start="947.68" dur="3.99">it says and so basically he this is a</text>
  <text start="950.17" dur="5.13">long article which I will put in the</text>
  <text start="951.67" dur="7.68">show notes below this but basically the</text>
  <text start="955.3" dur="5.94">FBI who burned the Kleins to say or the</text>
  <text start="959.35" dur="3.39">FBI he says it wasn&amp;#39;t the FBI it makes</text>
  <text start="961.24" dur="4.17">me sick to even say that because these</text>
  <text start="962.74" dur="4.02">guys we called men in black and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="965.41" dur="4.11">gonna get into the significance of that</text>
  <text start="966.76" dur="5.13">in a second but he basically says that</text>
  <text start="969.52" dur="4.2">they came to him and asked him to have</text>
  <text start="971.89" dur="4.41">sex with this woman to get information</text>
  <text start="973.72" dur="4.32">and when he went to them telling them</text>
  <text start="976.3" dur="3.12">this isn&amp;#39;t what you guys are saying it</text>
  <text start="978.04" dur="3.96">is you know just cuz she&amp;#39;s from Russia</text>
  <text start="979.42" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s not like she&amp;#39;s not like a spy or</text>
  <text start="982" dur="5.28">anything this is not that they declined</text>
  <text start="984.85" dur="4.56">to take any action on her when she was</text>
  <text start="987.28" dur="5.07">meeting with conservatives so they</text>
  <text start="989.41" dur="4.44">basically weaponized Maria Bettina to be</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="4.11">something she wasn&amp;#39;t and let the</text>
  <text start="993.85" dur="6.42">activity occur because it would look bad</text>
  <text start="996.46" dur="5.79">for the right and now going into the the</text>
  <text start="1000.27" dur="5.88">later chapters of the story with the</text>
  <text start="1002.25" dur="7.2">overstock CEO I am what I am gathering</text>
  <text start="1006.15" dur="5.07">here is that he pretty much went on to</text>
  <text start="1009.45" dur="6.03">explain that he was asked to introduce</text>
  <text start="1011.22" dur="6.07">the Russian agent into Trump circles so</text>
  <text start="1015.48" dur="4.029">that Trump could be taken down and</text>
  <text start="1017.29" dur="3.9">Peter Straub gave the orders and then</text>
  <text start="1019.509" dur="4.621">also the other thing that was confusing</text>
  <text start="1021.19" dur="4.44">me is that they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re the the whole</text>
  <text start="1024.13" dur="4.77">the claim here is that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1025.63" dur="5.579">is also being made to look like a victim</text>
  <text start="1028.9" dur="4.559">even I don&amp;#39;t want any I want everybody</text>
  <text start="1031.209" dur="3.75">to stop there okay that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1033.459" dur="2.941">common narrative that&amp;#39;s out there right</text>
  <text start="1034.959" dur="3.421">now that this guy can&amp;#39;t be trusted</text>
  <text start="1036.4" dur="4.47">because he&amp;#39;s making a case to be</text>
  <text start="1038.38" dur="4.41">sympathetic to Hillary and I</text>
  <text start="1040.87" dur="3.78">I didn&amp;#39;t take it this way that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1042.79" dur="6.03">what I thought the way I took what he</text>
  <text start="1044.65" dur="5.64">said was that they needed blackmail on</text>
  <text start="1048.82" dur="3.72">Hillary Clinton and everybody&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1050.29" dur="3.66">well why why don&amp;#39;t they have any they</text>
  <text start="1052.54" dur="3.99">have so much blackmail on Hillary</text>
  <text start="1053.95" dur="4.44">Clinton and I say to that yeah they they</text>
  <text start="1056.53" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t have very much blackmail on</text>
  <text start="1058.39" dur="4.59">Hillary Clinton and here&amp;#39;s why all of it</text>
  <text start="1060.46" dur="5.07">involves them if you go to Obama it</text>
  <text start="1062.98" dur="4.199">involves the email server uranium one</text>
  <text start="1065.53" dur="3.93">they can&amp;#39;t go after that it involves</text>
  <text start="1067.179" dur="4.5">people you understand what I mean all of</text>
  <text start="1069.46" dur="4.98">the things that they have on quote</text>
  <text start="1071.679" dur="5.281">Hillary Clinton involved the people that</text>
  <text start="1074.44" dur="4.29">work would be if she had like a Deadman</text>
  <text start="1076.96" dur="4.29">switch or some information or whatever</text>
  <text start="1078.73" dur="5.52">they would be implicated as well so</text>
  <text start="1081.25" dur="6.059">here&amp;#39;s my thought not the FBI</text>
  <text start="1084.25" dur="5.37">not necessarily even just the CIA but</text>
  <text start="1087.309" dur="4.62">when you think of men and black what do</text>
  <text start="1089.62" dur="4.679">you think about I think about aliens</text>
  <text start="1091.929" dur="4.291">well you think about aliens the men in</text>
  <text start="1094.299" dur="4.201">black that operate kind of above the</text>
  <text start="1096.22" dur="4.68">government right that aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1098.5" dur="4.409">government people they&amp;#39;re this agency</text>
  <text start="1100.9" dur="3.39">that is yes under the cloak of the</text>
  <text start="1102.909" dur="4.231">government but is not accountable to</text>
  <text start="1104.29" dur="4.95">anybody but themselves and in the movies</text>
  <text start="1107.14" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re portrayed as good guys but</text>
  <text start="1109.24" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re never usually good guys as per</text>
  <text start="1111.58" dur="3.86">somebody that I know in real life when</text>
  <text start="1113.53" dur="5.43">you refer to somebody as a men in black</text>
  <text start="1115.44" dur="5.77">um this to me before we play the clips</text>
  <text start="1118.96" dur="3.57">Frank feeds into the larger story here</text>
  <text start="1121.21" dur="4.17">that everybody is afraid to talk about</text>
  <text start="1122.53" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s really necessary it almost makes</text>
  <text start="1125.38" dur="5.789">it seem as though like what Zack was</text>
  <text start="1128.47" dur="4.5">saying on Monday about the heads of</text>
  <text start="1131.169" dur="4.171">these tech companies being controlled by</text>
  <text start="1132.97" dur="3.48">something other than you know what I</text>
  <text start="1135.34" dur="3.959">mean mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1136.45" dur="4.56">this is the shadow operation even</text>
  <text start="1139.299" dur="3.481">sitting above the government that</text>
  <text start="1141.01" dur="6.72">controls everything with their puppet</text>
  <text start="1142.78" dur="7.66">strings well it it&amp;#39;s a it really speaks</text>
  <text start="1147.73" dur="4.75">to the you know an axe</text>
  <text start="1150.44" dur="6.75">if you want to get into men in black and</text>
  <text start="1152.48" dur="5.37">and actual aliens and all that other</text>
  <text start="1157.19" dur="4.199">stuff</text>
  <text start="1157.85" dur="6.059">the off-the-book stuff the reason why</text>
  <text start="1161.389" dur="5.701">that your you see all this migration of</text>
  <text start="1163.909" dur="5.76">Defense Intelligence and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="1167.09" dur="4.74">going into private contractors in the</text>

  <text start="1733.67" dur="3.78">recourse at this point is to get out</text>
  <text start="1735.59" dur="4.95">there and start talking about this stuff</text>
  <text start="1737.45" dur="4.95">because if he gets you know very</text>
  <text start="1740.54" dur="4.139">depressed all of a sudden or if he ends</text>

  <text start="1751.79" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;m saying now as far as the other two</text>
  <text start="1754.91" dur="5.16">names he brought up Brennan and clapper</text>

  <text start="1770.3" dur="4.65">when he started saying x y&amp;amp;z frito Cuomo</text>
  <text start="1773.27" dur="3.36">had no idea what he was talking about</text>
  <text start="1774.95" dur="3.75">like he was just being a lunatic using</text>
  <text start="1776.63" dur="5.929">letters of the alphabet like usual what</text>
  <text start="1778.7" dur="8.76">is this law an actual person named X</text>
  <text start="1782.559" dur="6.731">exactly so does he sound crazy yeah but</text>
  <text start="1787.46" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s clear he&amp;#39;s been operating with</text>
  <text start="1789.29" dur="4.08">people that are at a very high level of</text>
  <text start="1791.45" dur="5.13">covert intelligence here for a very long</text>
  <text start="1793.37" dur="5.01">time and he&amp;#39;s in that world I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1796.58" dur="3.42">believe it was only three times that he</text>
  <text start="1798.38" dur="2.91">worked with them I really don&amp;#39;t I think</text>
  <text start="1800" dur="2">there was a lot more to it than that</text>
  <text start="1801.29" dur="3.86">because</text>
  <text start="1802" dur="5.52">as flabbergasted as he is and on unable</text>
  <text start="1805.15" dur="5.13">to kind of coherently explain what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1807.52" dur="4.77">trying to explain it&amp;#39;s probably because</text>
  <text start="1810.28" dur="3.63">he&amp;#39;s got so much in the vault that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1812.29" dur="3.6">not supposed to talk about and that</text>
  <text start="1813.91" dur="5.22">could jeopardize an investigation that</text>
  <text start="1815.89" dur="5.19">to save his own to say to possibly save</text>
  <text start="1819.13" dur="3.96">his own life he&amp;#39;s got a talk but he</text>
  <text start="1821.08" dur="4.05">can&amp;#39;t say certain things or else they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1823.09" dur="3.66">never get accountability and at the same</text>
  <text start="1825.13" dur="3.75">time he&amp;#39;s trying to figure out and</text>
  <text start="1826.75" dur="4.14">compartmentalize for himself which</text>
  <text start="1828.88" dur="3.09">things were too secret for him to talk</text>
  <text start="1830.89" dur="3.72">about you don&amp;#39;t understand what I mean</text>
  <text start="1831.97" dur="4.68">you think there&amp;#39;s anybody telling you is</text>

  <text start="1856.72" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;ll stop before to play that one um</text>
  <text start="1858.96" dur="4.9">this is what I think it is I think it is</text>
  <text start="1861.52" dur="4.2">that he really wanted to state say</text>
  <text start="1863.86" dur="4.53">something in the public and was unsure</text>
  <text start="1865.72" dur="4.11">if he should do so goodness knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1868.39" dur="2.97">happening to him behind the scenes he</text>
  <text start="1869.83" dur="4.77">had to step down from his company he</text>
  <text start="1871.36" dur="5.4">loves he started he it&amp;#39;s a disastrous</text>

  <text start="1876.76" dur="6.36">old bachelor right so he wanted to do it</text>

  <text start="1883.12" dur="4.5">it was okay and Warren Buffett told him</text>
  <text start="1885.43" dur="3.72">it was okay so he decided he was gonna</text>
  <text start="1887.62" dur="2.94">say to himself inside well Warren</text>
  <text start="1889.15" dur="3.06">Buffett said to do it to make himself</text>
  <text start="1890.56" dur="3.63">feel better about doing it does that</text>
  <text start="1892.21" dur="3.81">make sense yeah I can see that being the</text>
  <text start="1894.19" dur="3.93">case so I don&amp;#39;t think it was like</text>

  <text start="2201.01" dur="2.31">like I&amp;#39;m having a hard time</text>
  <text start="2201.91" dur="2.88">understanding why that&amp;#39;s hard to believe</text>
  <text start="2203.32" dur="3.18">that someone would want a black male</text>
  <text start="2204.79" dur="5.31">Hillary with something other than what</text>
  <text start="2206.5" dur="6.42">they were all also involved in I guess</text>

  <text start="2212.92" dur="4.44">implication as to what that black male</text>
  <text start="2214.63" dur="6.63">was he doesn&amp;#39;t say because they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2217.36" dur="6.3">all they&amp;#39;re all so I confused at the hip</text>
  <text start="2221.26" dur="5.43">even if they had something on her that</text>
  <text start="2223.66" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t involve them she she could still</text>
  <text start="2226.69" dur="7.8">take them down while taking herself down</text>
  <text start="2229.03" dur="6.99">even worse mutually insured destruction</text>
  <text start="2234.49" dur="3.18">hey that that&amp;#39;s the reason why you have</text>
  <text start="2236.02" dur="3.3">it which is why I don&amp;#39;t know why they</text>
  <text start="2237.67" dur="3">would even shred into those waters think</text>
  <text start="2239.32" dur="3.69">about Hillary Clinton and what a</text>

  <text start="2256.66" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m in with the limited information we</text>
  <text start="2258.16" dur="5.04">have she would not be able to use</text>
  <text start="2261.04" dur="4.14">leverage on someone else that also</text>
  <text start="2263.2" dur="3.51">involved her because she would be outing</text>
  <text start="2265.18" dur="5.85">herself and I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;d as she&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2266.71" dur="6.78">rather die than do that otherwise she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2271.03" dur="4.23">had enemies before what happens to them</text>

  <text start="2649.229" dur="5.64">bigger part of the story than he is or</text>
  <text start="2651.439" dur="5.11">there is a lot more that he has not said</text>
  <text start="2654.869" dur="4.89">yet and I think it&amp;#39;s a combination of</text>
  <text start="2656.549" dur="6.56">both he the Hollywood thing is</text>
  <text start="2659.759" dur="6.03">interesting to me what do you think I</text>
  <text start="2663.109" dur="4.75">don&amp;#39;t know I just first the Hollywood</text>
  <text start="2665.789" dur="4.08">thing I mean you remember when Moby came</text>
  <text start="2667.859" dur="4.8">out and said that the CIA came up to him</text>
  <text start="2669.869" dur="5.521">and told them to help help out with the</text>
  <text start="2672.659" dur="4.981">Russian narrative I do let me find that</text>
  <text start="2675.39" dur="4.469">hold on isn&amp;#39;t there a clip of that is</text>
  <text start="2677.64" dur="5.099">there Clippers that that was just I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2679.859" dur="5.97">only ever read it in articles I mean so</text>
  <text start="2682.739" dur="5.43">as far as the recruitment of Hollywood</text>
  <text start="2685.829" dur="6.061">and celebrity voices to bolster an</text>
  <text start="2688.169" dur="6.06">official state narrative is is I mean</text>
  <text start="2691.89" dur="6.599">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not fantasy at all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2694.229" dur="7.08">just common practice but I as far as</text>
  <text start="2698.489" dur="5.13">this being misattributed and weaponized</text>
  <text start="2701.309" dur="6.27">and not concocted out of nowhere I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2703.619" dur="7.531">pretty shy I know that there is a</text>
  <text start="2707.579" dur="6.14">there&amp;#39;s a contingent I I know that</text>
  <text start="2711.15" dur="4.679">there&amp;#39;s a plan therefore the the</text>
  <text start="2713.719" dur="4.99">intelligence community to go and use</text>
  <text start="2715.829" dur="4.62">this stuff but aside from that the the</text>
  <text start="2718.709" dur="4.59">Russian narrative itself it had been</text>
  <text start="2720.449" dur="5.25">very slowly nurtured in public we</text>
  <text start="2723.299" dur="4.71">actually watched the genesis of the</text>
  <text start="2725.699" dur="5.37">Russian narrative and how it was passed</text>
  <text start="2728.009" dur="4.481">along and and applied to the Trump</text>
  <text start="2731.069" dur="3.161">campaign that was a</text>
  <text start="2732.49" dur="4.05">that was nurtured that was birthed in</text>
  <text start="2734.23" dur="5.22">public but we were seeing that not only</text>
  <text start="2736.54" dur="5.79">the President himself Barack Obama but</text>
  <text start="2739.45" dur="5.58">Robby Mook John Podesta that we we</text>
  <text start="2742.33" dur="7.35">actually can we can track the timeline</text>
  <text start="2745.03" dur="6.72">of when this this excuse was assigned to</text>
  <text start="2749.68" dur="4.26">President Trump especially after the</text>
  <text start="2751.75" dur="3.99">election election night is when MOOC and</text>
  <text start="2753.94" dur="3.42">Podesta said well okay well we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2755.74" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re going with the Russian</text>
  <text start="2757.36" dur="5.37">interference angle so yeah perhaps there</text>
  <text start="2760.33" dur="4.65">there is and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised I</text>
  <text start="2762.73" dur="5.31">mean counterintelligence programs since</text>
  <text start="2764.98" dur="6.6">the 1950s you know what was going on</text>
  <text start="2768.04" dur="6.95">within the FBI to to break up feminist</text>
  <text start="2771.58" dur="6">organizations the Ku Klux Klan social</text>
  <text start="2774.99" dur="4.51">you know civil rights leaders all that</text>
  <text start="2777.58" dur="4.68">stuff our intelligence communities have</text>
  <text start="2779.5" dur="5.369">been involved with tinkering with the</text>
  <text start="2782.26" dur="4.32">culture and stifling movements or</text>
  <text start="2784.869" dur="5.911">creating movements whenever they thought</text>
  <text start="2786.58" dur="8.28">it could be advantageous to their their</text>
  <text start="2790.78" dur="6.329">overall plan for the country and that I</text>
  <text start="2794.86" dur="5.19">mean that&amp;#39;s right there their overall</text>
  <text start="2797.109" dur="5.551">plan for the country it&amp;#39;s not about what</text>
  <text start="2800.05" dur="5.43">the people want so it always comes down</text>
  <text start="2802.66" dur="7.98">to their control and a clandestine hand</text>
  <text start="2805.48" dur="8.16">too so I never discount their there will</text>
  <text start="2810.64" dur="6.6">in any of this stuff but as far as that</text>
  <text start="2813.64" dur="5.969">this being is not being a concoction we</text>
  <text start="2817.24" dur="4.32">watched it and we also have the money we</text>
  <text start="2819.609" dur="4.681">have the the the money trail from</text>
  <text start="2821.56" dur="4.98">Perkins Coie to the DNC and I mean even</text>
  <text start="2824.29" dur="4.319">the Obama administration was giving</text>
  <text start="2826.54" dur="4.02">money for that dossier yeah but why do</text>
  <text start="2828.609" dur="5.421">they have to be why can&amp;#39;t they be</text>
  <text start="2830.56" dur="6.48">mutually exclusive of one another like I</text>
  <text start="2834.03" dur="5.47">he&amp;#39;s the he&amp;#39;s denying I was at least</text>
  <text start="2837.04" dur="6.51">unless I heard him wrong that one half</text>
  <text start="2839.5" dur="6.48">of that is wrong I&amp;#39;m saying well it may</text>
  <text start="2843.55" dur="5.61">be their intelligence community was work</text>
  <text start="2845.98" dur="6.09">it was living operating with autonomy</text>
  <text start="2849.16" dur="4.62">and their own intentions there but so</text>
  <text start="2852.07" dur="3.69">was the other there that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2853.78" dur="4.71">discount the other thing there is mutual</text>
  <text start="2855.76" dur="4.62">exclusivity at the very least yeah</text>
  <text start="2858.49" dur="3.9">several several different buckets of it</text>
  <text start="2860.38" dur="4.11">several different which makes it all the</text>
  <text start="2862.39" dur="3.72">more crazy like when your turn</text>
  <text start="2864.49" dur="4.11">explain this to everyday people out</text>
  <text start="2866.11" dur="5.12">there it like to try and even get them</text>
  <text start="2868.6" dur="6.42">to wrap their head around how absolutely</text>
  <text start="2871.23" dur="6.19">horrible this is well look Tracy anybody</text>
  <text start="2875.02" dur="4.05">who turns on Chris Cuomo every night to</text>
  <text start="2877.42" dur="3.24">get the news and they actually believe</text>
