  <text start="4.02" dur="7.77">2018 a 1213 p.m. Eastern Standard Time I</text>
  <text start="8" dur="6.36">have attempted to do a few things first</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="5.9">of all this is going to be fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="14.36" dur="6.91">testimony from Glenn Simpson part two</text>
  <text start="17.69" dur="6.04">fusing the story very illuminating I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="21.27" dur="5.849">not gonna really try to speculate too</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="5.67">much about why these things are</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="4.471">happening although I will put some of my</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="4.77">input in this is really just to go</text>
  <text start="31.59" dur="3.899">through the testimony for somebody who</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="6.299">doesn&amp;#39;t want to read through the whole</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="6.811">thing I have definitely picked out very</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="3.991">important parts of this testimony and</text>
  <text start="42.3" dur="3.239">explained very important parts of</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="2.97">information about it</text>
  <text start="45.539" dur="6.41">in case you don&amp;#39;t want to read through</text>

  <text start="51.949" dur="7.781">secondly I have now attempted to zoom my</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="5.97">screen in to make it larger for people</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="3.84">because a lot of people in the comments</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.38">were saying they couldn&amp;#39;t read along</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="4.95">with me and this is basically the best</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="6.509">I&amp;#39;m gonna be able to do I&amp;#39;m using a</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="6.9">screen recorder so this is now 40 times</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="5.82">the size as it should be on my screen so</text>

  <text start="108.45" dur="6.5">it gives us a very very good look into</text>
  <text start="111.299" dur="8.1">what&amp;#39;s going on behind the scenes here</text>
  <text start="114.95" dur="7.33">so off we go okay we&amp;#39;re gonna start we</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="6.301">left off on page 154 so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="8.22">start back up on la on page 154 and in</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="7.14">here he&amp;#39;s talking about the dossier and</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="3.03">he&amp;#39;s answering a question that was posed</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="5.22">to him</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="8.75">about why he thinks that why he thinks</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="7.08">that the the Trump campaign is accepting</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="4.81">information from from Russian the</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="3.929">Russian government so he answers and he</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="3.33">says I mean and and just to let you guys</text>
  <text start="149.069" dur="3.091">know because a lot of people come into</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="4.53">this as well if I&amp;#39;m reading the words</text>
  <text start="152.16" dur="4.77">you know or saying you know it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s in his testimony I&amp;#39;m reading it</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="5.01">verbatim and so you&amp;#39;ll hear me say you</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="3.57">know you know you know because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="4.23">what he&amp;#39;s saying and I want to give you</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="4.59">the most um you know very unfiltered</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="4.02">look into what is coming out of his</text>
  <text start="167.85" dur="5.34">mouth as best as I can so it&amp;#39;s not me</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="6.63">using filler words no it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="5.64">Glenn Simpson using filler words so he</text>
  <text start="176.82" dur="4.32">says I mean one of the key lines here in</text>
  <text start="178.83" dur="4.35">the second paragraph says quote however</text>
  <text start="181.14" dur="3.84">he and his inner circle have accepted a</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="4.05">regular flow of intelligence from the</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="5.07">Kremlin including on his Democratic and</text>
  <text start="187.23" dur="4.53">other political rivals end quote so the</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="3.78">issue with the Trump Tower meeting as I</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="4.14">understand it is that the Trump people</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="3.51">were eager to accept intelligence from a</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="4.2">foreign government about their political</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="5.25">rivals and that is you know I would say</text>
  <text start="200.1" dur="4.199">a form of interference if you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="3.66">help from a foreign government and your</text>
  <text start="204.299" dur="4.381">help is intelligence then the foreign</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="4.38">governments interfering I mean you know</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="3.779">I think that also of course in</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="3.54">retrospect we now know that this was</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="6.391">pretty right on target in terms of what</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="7.47">it says so anyway and then the question</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="4.83">is asked in reference to you think that</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="3.39">particular sentence and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.68" dur="4.5">written wrong it&amp;#39;s not transcribed</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="6">correctly he answers I mean it clearly</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="5.399">refers to you know them being interested</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="5.16">in and willing to it depicts them as</text>
  <text start="233.579" dur="4.291">accepting information what we have seen</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="3.419">to date with the disclosures this year</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="3.649">is that they were at a minimum super</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="6.151">interested in getting information and</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="6.131">then the question is asked and when</text>
  <text start="245.76" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re referencing the disclosures this</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="3.899">year could you just be as specific about</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="4.77">that and he answers the Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="4.44">meeting and then the question is asked</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="5.519">so with reference to the June 9th Trump</text>
  <text start="255.989" dur="6.93">Tower meeting and he says yes yes now</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="4.501">the dossier says they were accepting</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="4.68">information</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="5.22">they never accepted any information so</text>
  <text start="267.599" dur="3.451">he&amp;#39;s basically contradicting himself in</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="4.35">his testimony right here he also</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="4.41">testifies throughout this that he had no</text>
  <text start="273.87" dur="4.229">idea that that that meeting even</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="4.53">happened until way after the fact just</text>
  <text start="278.099" dur="4.741">recently when we all found out I find</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="5.79">that very very very hard to believe</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="7.38">very hard to believe so we&amp;#39;ve got that</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="7.319">little sort of mess there then I say to</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="4.77">go to line 156 and and by the way they</text>
  <text start="293.099" dur="3.511">my speculation is that they were</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="3.269">involved in setting that meeting up or</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="4.5">Christopher Steele was definitely in</text>
  <text start="298.259" dur="4.981">mice I&amp;#39;m speculating involved in setting</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="3.51">that up somehow whether or not that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="3.63">fact as of right now we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="4.289">tangible facts to back that up my</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="4.039">speculation is that that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="308.909" dur="7.141">happened</text>
  <text start="310.909" dur="7.271">156 lines 13 through 23 they&amp;#39;re asking a</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="4.079">question and they say so you had</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="3.84">testified a little earlier at the point</text>
  <text start="320.129" dur="3.901">in time in which you received this first</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="4.049">memo he used it a little more as a</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="4.65">background to inform your thinking on it</text>
  <text start="326.069" dur="4.831">but you didn&amp;#39;t take discrete steps had</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="6.9">you were you involved in editing this</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="7.29">memo in any way and he says no and then</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="4.8">they asked did you give mr. Steele any</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="4.86">specific direction on you know next</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="6.06">steps based on this memo and he says not</text>
  <text start="343.05" dur="7.229">that I can recall no but we can look</text>
  <text start="346.44" dur="5.699">back at page 78 in the testimony and the</text>
  <text start="350.279" dur="2.75">banging is the keyboard I apologize for</text>
  <text start="352.139" dur="6.721">that</text>
  <text start="353.029" dur="8.801">78 in the testimony on line one through</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="5.339">six where he says we were at a point</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="3.57">where you know we we&amp;#39;ve done a lot of</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="5.641">reading and research and we were</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="7.35">drilling down on specific areas and he</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="4.979">basically says I would say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="3.659">broadly what I asked him to see if we</text>
  <text start="374.819" dur="3.32">could find out about Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.409" dur="8.1">business activities in Russia and he</text>
  <text start="378.139" dur="8.051">says that I mean the bit he says I mean</text>
  <text start="384.509" dur="3.15">the basis for the request was that he</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="2.909">had made a number of trips to Russia and</text>
  <text start="387.659" dur="3.57">talked about doing a number of business</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="3.93">deals but never did one and that struck</text>
  <text start="391.229" dur="4.47">me as a little bit odd in calling for an</text>
  <text start="393.029" dur="4.531">explanation so he&amp;#39;s basically saying he</text>
  <text start="395.699" dur="2.611">talked to Christopher Steele he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="2.28">this</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="3.09">and he said you know he doesn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="4.62">built business dealings in rush I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="6.03">to figure out why that&amp;#39;s direction that</text>
  <text start="404.46" dur="4.11">is direction so he every time he says he</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="3.66">was open-ended he didn&amp;#39;t give him</text>
  <text start="408.57" dur="5.25">direction he&amp;#39;s lying he&amp;#39;s lying because</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="5.85">he stated that very clearly a few times</text>
  <text start="413.82" dur="5.4">actually not just on that page so I just</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="7.95">wanted to point that out to people 158</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="10.08">line 15 through 163 line 17 so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.89" dur="9.09">gonna go through all of this so we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="429.3" dur="7.14">page 158 line 15 and the question is how</text>
  <text start="433.98" dur="4.23">did you kind of use this information and</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="2.94">he&amp;#39;s talking about the end for me the</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="3.72">questioner is talking about the</text>
  <text start="439.38" dur="4.38">information in the memo and Glenn</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="3.3">Simpson answers and I&amp;#39;m gonna read this</text>
  <text start="443.76" dur="7.53">entire answer because I wrote it down</text>
  <text start="445.23" dur="8.67">and there&amp;#39;s a good reason for it well I</text>
  <text start="451.29" dur="4.77">think the context of external invent</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="3.96">events is important here I believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="3.96">my recollection that what prompted this</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="4.44">memo was in fact in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="4.29">public reporting on the hack I think</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="4.65">what is the date again yeah it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="4.23">26th of July so by this time Debbie</text>
  <text start="466.95" dur="3.69">wasserman-schultz has been the subject</text>
  <text start="468.54" dur="4.77">of a very aggressive hacking campaign</text>
  <text start="470.64" dur="5.37">weaponized hack the likes of which you</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="5.43">know have never really been seen now</text>
  <text start="476.01" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s probably a leak it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="4.17">definitely a leak anyway he wiki</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="4.14">continues we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve seen hacking in</text>
  <text start="482.91" dur="4.59">politics before but this kind of you</text>
  <text start="484.98" dur="4.23">know masked theft of email and then to</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="4.05">dump it all into you know the public</text>
  <text start="489.21" dur="4.59">sphere was extraordinary and it was</text>
  <text start="491.55" dur="3.87">criminal so the question by now of</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="2.97">whether this was Russia and whether this</text>
  <text start="495.42" dur="3.21">might have something to do with the</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="4.29">other information that we&amp;#39;d received was</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="6.09">you know the immediate question and I</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="5.61">think that this is also by the time this</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="4.14">memo was written chris has already met</text>
  <text start="506.67" dur="4.02">with the FBI about the first memo so</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="3.869">he&amp;#39;s if I can interpret a little bit</text>
  <text start="510.69" dur="3.57">here in his mind he is oh this is</text>
  <text start="512.729" dur="3.541">already a criminal matter there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="4.08">already a potential national national</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="3.63">security matter here I mean this is</text>
  <text start="518.34" dur="3.329">basically about a month later and</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s a lot of events that occurred in</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="3.931">between you know after the first memo</text>
  <text start="523.83" dur="3.51">you know Chris said he was very</text>
  <text start="525.6" dur="3.99">concerned about whether this represented</text>
  <text start="527.34" dur="4.59">a national security threat and said he</text>
  <text start="529.59" dur="3.72">wanted to he said he thought we were</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="5.599">obligated to tell someone in government</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="4.219">in our government about this information</text>
  <text start="537.71" dur="4.99">he thought from a perspective there was</text>
  <text start="540.27" dur="3.96">an issue a security issue about whether</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="4.47">a presidential candidate was being</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="4.59">blackmailed from my perspective there</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="2.94">was a law enforcement issue about</text>
  <text start="548.82" dur="3.81">whether there was an illegal conspiracy</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="3.81">to violate campaign laws and then</text>
  <text start="552.63" dur="3.75">somewhere in this time the whole issue</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="4.53">of hacking has also surfaced so he</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="4.23">proposed to he said we should tell the</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="4.44">FBI at the national security issue</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="4.14">I didn&amp;#39;t originally disagree or agree I</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="2.759">just put it off and said that I needed</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="3.6">to think about it</text>
  <text start="565.649" dur="4.801">correction I didn&amp;#39;t originally agree or</text>
  <text start="568.35" dur="4.23">disagree I just put it off and said I</text>
  <text start="570.45" dur="4.29">needed to think about it then he raised</text>
  <text start="572.58" dur="4.47">it again with me I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="574.74" dur="4.23">exact sequence of these events but my</text>
  <text start="577.05" dur="3.599">recollection is that I questioned how we</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="3.09">would do that because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="580.649" dur="3.481">anyone there that I could report</text>
  <text start="582.06" dur="3.779">something like this to and be believed</text>
  <text start="584.13" dur="3.42">and I didn&amp;#39;t really think it was</text>
  <text start="585.839" dur="3.75">necessarily appropriate for me to do</text>

  <text start="982.519" dur="3.63">like to explain is what I knew at the</text>
  <text start="983.929" dur="4.62">time and what I know now it was</text>
  <text start="986.149" dur="3.78">September and obviously the controversy</text>
  <text start="988.549" dur="3.33">was really front and center now in the</text>
  <text start="989.929" dur="3.6">election I can&amp;#39;t remember whether the</text>
  <text start="991.879" dur="3.87">intelligence community had come out with</text>
  <text start="993.529" dur="3.9">their statement but you know there was a</text>
  <text start="995.749" dur="3.39">lot of concern in Washington and in the</text>
  <text start="997.429" dur="4.02">US about whether there was a Kremlin</text>
  <text start="999.139" dur="4.32">operation to interfere with our election</text>
  <text start="1001.449" dur="4.05">there was you were perpetrating it dude</text>
  <text start="1003.459" dur="3.57">and there was a lot of debate throughout</text>
  <text start="1005.499" dur="3.18">this period about whether they were just</text>
  <text start="1007.029" dur="3.631">trying to help Trump or just trying to</text>
  <text start="1008.679" dur="3.87">cause trouble there wasn&amp;#39;t much debate</text>
  <text start="1010.66" dur="7.199">about whether they were up to something</text>
  <text start="1012.549" dur="7.111">so you know I&amp;#39;m dealing with I&amp;#39;m dealing</text>
  <text start="1017.859" dur="3.78">with Chris on the underlying reporting</text>
  <text start="1019.66" dur="4.049">and by this time my concern you know was</text>
  <text start="1021.639" dur="3.78">I was very concerned because Chris had</text>
  <text start="1023.709" dur="4.23">delivered a lot of information and by</text>
  <text start="1025.419" dur="4.701">this time we had and by this time we had</text>
  <text start="1027.939" dur="4.291">you know stood up a good bit of it</text>
  <text start="1030.12" dur="3.909">various things he had written about in</text>
  <text start="1032.23" dur="3.449">his memos correspondent quite closely</text>
  <text start="1034.029" dur="4.02">with other events and I began you know</text>
  <text start="1035.679" dur="4.081">TV was reporting in this case as you</text>
  <text start="1038.049" dur="4.98">know really serious and really credible</text>
  <text start="1039.76" dur="6.72">well what about before what about before</text>
  <text start="1043.029" dur="5.191">you brought it to the FBI before this</text>
  <text start="1046.48" dur="3.929">and you didn&amp;#39;t think it was really</text>
  <text start="1048.22" dur="6.439">serious and really credible you brought</text>
  <text start="1050.409" dur="6.541">it before this with the very first memo</text>
  <text start="1054.659" dur="9.141">when was it really serious and really</text>
  <text start="1056.95" dur="9.04">credible to you so anyway he says</text>
  <text start="1063.8" dur="4.05">we were working on all of that and then</text>
  <text start="1065.99" dur="3.21">he said hey I heard back from the FBI</text>
  <text start="1067.85" dur="2.67">and they want me to come talk to them</text>
  <text start="1069.2" dur="3.96">and they said they want everything I</text>
  <text start="1070.52" dur="4.77">have to which I said okay he said he had</text>
  <text start="1073.16" dur="4.05">to go to Rome and I said okay he went to</text>
  <text start="1075.29" dur="3.33">Rome then afterwards he came back and</text>
  <text start="1077.21" dur="3.63">said you know I gave them a full</text>
  <text start="1078.62" dur="4.2">briefing I&amp;#39;ll add because I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1080.84" dur="3.57">consider this to be you know there was</text>
  <text start="1082.82" dur="2.19">no objective here politically because</text>
  <text start="1084.41" dur="2.91">you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1085.01" dur="3.93">in an ordinary election I know from my</text>
  <text start="1087.32" dur="3.3">decades of dealing with US elections</text>
  <text start="1088.94" dur="3.75">that you can&amp;#39;t expect the government or</text>
  <text start="1090.62" dur="5.04">the FBI to be of any use in a campaign</text>
  <text start="1092.69" dur="4.8">because the DoD has rules again DOJ has</text>
  <text start="1095.66" dur="4.14">rules against law enforcement getting</text>
  <text start="1097.49" dur="4.95">involved in investigations in the middle</text>
  <text start="1099.8" dur="6.8">of a campaign and this was obviously you</text>
  <text start="1102.44" dur="4.16">know this obviously became a huge issue</text>
  <text start="1108.22" dur="4.18">anyway because it wasn&amp;#39;t really part of</text>
  <text start="1110.42" dur="3.3">the project in my mind and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1112.4" dur="3.48">really ask a lot of questions about</text>
  <text start="1113.72" dur="3.84">these meetings I didn&amp;#39;t ask who he met</text>
  <text start="1115.88" dur="3.54">with I didn&amp;#39;t ask you know much of</text>
  <text start="1117.56" dur="4.56">anything but he did tell me that he gave</text>
  <text start="1119.42" dur="4.65">and they interrupt him and they say</text>
  <text start="1122.12" dur="3.63">before we get to that which I do want to</text>
  <text start="1124.07" dur="4.92">hear I just want to get a sense of</text>
  <text start="1125.75" dur="6.39">chronology and he answers sure the</text>
  <text start="1128.99" dur="5.13">question is so when did that you you had</text>
  <text start="1132.14" dur="4.14">said the FBI then came back and</text>
  <text start="1134.12" dur="3.27">contacted mr. steel and the answer is</text>
  <text start="1136.28" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s my understanding</text>
  <text start="1137.39" dur="4.8">and the question is when did that to the</text>
  <text start="1140.15" dur="4.17">best of your knowledge take place and</text>
  <text start="1142.19" dur="4.71">the answer is mid to late September and</text>
  <text start="1144.32" dur="4.83">the question then is so in that</text>
  <text start="1146.9" dur="4.59">intervening time period mr. steel</text>
  <text start="1149.15" dur="4.77">continues his research he also continues</text>
  <text start="1151.49" dur="6.63">to bribe provide you with memos answer</text>
  <text start="1153.92" dur="6.3">yes question at no point in time between</text>
  <text start="1158.12" dur="3.99">July the first week of July when he</text>
  <text start="1160.22" dur="3.9">first met with the FBI and then meant</text>
  <text start="1162.11" dur="3.57">too late September did you suggest to</text>
  <text start="1164.12" dur="4.56">him that he should go back to the FBI</text>
  <text start="1165.68" dur="5.19">and the answer is not that I recall what</text>
  <text start="1168.68" dur="4.35">I would what I would believe I may have</text>
  <text start="1170.87" dur="4.41">said was have you heard anything from</text>
  <text start="1173.03" dur="6.06">the FBI because by then it was obvious</text>
  <text start="1175.28" dur="5.55">there was a crime in progress so I was</text>
  <text start="1179.09" dur="4.59">just curious whether he&amp;#39;d heard back a</text>
  <text start="1180.83" dur="4.65">question and when you say it was obvious</text>
  <text start="1183.68" dur="4.4">that there was a crime in progress what</text>

  <text start="1687.85" dur="5.76">smiling as he asks the question oh</text>
  <text start="1689.65" dur="5.39">because this is this is so so funny this</text>
  <text start="1693.61" dur="14.72">is so funny</text>
  <text start="1695.04" dur="17.519">so funny page 185 during this testimony</text>
  <text start="1708.33" dur="7.12">he&amp;#39;s trying to basically defend himself</text>
  <text start="1712.559" dur="4.331">by saying that he relies on other folks</text>
  <text start="1715.45" dur="3.479">to be credible based off of their</text>
  <text start="1716.89" dur="4.5">history or and reputation so he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1718.929" dur="4.771">qualify a lot of these things himself he</text>
  <text start="1721.39" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t work with integrity he basically</text>
  <text start="1723.7" dur="4.08">just accept things as truth because</text>
  <text start="1725.89" dur="3.57">somebody used to be true in the past so</text>
  <text start="1727.78" dur="3.66">they must be truthful now which is</text>
  <text start="1729.46" dur="4.59">exactly what I tell you guys never to do</text>
  <text start="1731.44" dur="4.32">we search everything everything that</text>

  <text start="1741.22" dur="6.75">mistakes</text>
  <text start="1743.46" dur="13.51">however in Simpson&amp;#39;s case he has no</text>
  <text start="1747.97" dur="10.89">standard no journalistic integrity and</text>
  <text start="1756.97" dur="3.36">he basically says provision was</text>

  <text start="1781.3" dur="2.64">some extent whenever you enter a new</text>
  <text start="1782.77" dur="3.18">case that&amp;#39;s part of what you&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1783.94" dur="4.2">hired to determine is whether the</text>

  <text start="1807.91" dur="6.93">their clients are involved in criminal</text>
  <text start="1809.35" dur="7.29">activity so Simpsons basically</text>
  <text start="1814.84" dur="4.68">contradicting what he testified to</text>
  <text start="1816.64" dur="4.32">originally that is part of our job to</text>

  <text start="1829.84" dur="3.84">accept that because someone&amp;#39;s a lawyer</text>

  <text start="1935.84" dur="5.61">seems to me to be to establish that</text>
  <text start="1938.93" dur="4.23">fusion would have known that the FBI</text>

  <text start="1943.16" dur="4.41">was in the dossier as more hard fact</text>

  <text start="1971.27" dur="5.88">would probably have shrugged it off but</text>
  <text start="1972.95" dur="6.03">because they used steel so in other</text>

  <text start="2131.96" dur="4.57">Orbis does and steel does that</text>
  <text start="2135.54" dur="2.85">everything was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="2136.53" dur="5.16">confidential and not given to media and</text>
  <text start="2138.39" dur="5.31">that the questioner is trying to ask</text>
  <text start="2141.69" dur="3.06">Simpson whether or not they had an</text>

  <text start="2144.75" dur="4.17">confidential they&amp;#39;re basically trying to</text>
  <text start="2147.03" dur="3.45">establish here if Simpson could have</text>
  <text start="2148.92" dur="4.38">given information to the press and</text>
  <text start="2150.48" dur="4.609">whether he was aware that by doing so he</text>
  <text start="2153.3" dur="4.35">would breach a confidentiality agreement</text>
  <text start="2155.089" dur="5.74">but Speak what but but still won&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2157.65" dur="6.449">sorry but Simpson he won&amp;#39;t talk about</text>
  <text start="2160.829" dur="4.441">contracts with his clients and da etc so</text>
  <text start="2164.099" dur="3.691">it&amp;#39;s really hard to get that information</text>
  <text start="2165.27" dur="5.329">out of him so basically they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="2167.79" dur="5.7">to figure out if if Steele acted or</text>
  <text start="2170.599" dur="5.681">Simpson acted outside of any NDA or</text>
  <text start="2173.49" dur="4.379">contract they had because from from what</text>
  <text start="2176.28" dur="6.38">I can gather from reading this it</text>
  <text start="2177.869" dur="8.311">appears as though or bik&amp;#39;s Orbis is</text>
  <text start="2182.66" dur="5.98">trying to throw the book at fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="2186.18" dur="6.02">and make them the fall guy for anything</text>
  <text start="2188.64" dur="3.56">that happened in regards to the press</text>
  <text start="2195.23" dur="9.19">page 201 he&amp;#39;s asked directly about his</text>

  <text start="2235.71" dur="3.69">what I&amp;#39;d like to say is that we had</text>
  <text start="2237.42" dur="4.919">discussions about you know information</text>
  <text start="2239.4" dur="4.56">as opposed to memos and you know at</text>

  <text start="2243.96" dur="4.08">about the Trump Russia connection you</text>
  <text start="2245.73" dur="2.92">know things those discussions would be</text>
  <text start="2248.04" dur="3.039">informed</text>
  <text start="2248.65" dur="4.409">by what&amp;#39;s in the memos and mr. foster</text>
  <text start="2251.079" dur="3.75">says so are you saying that you may have</text>
  <text start="2253.059" dur="3.48">provided information to the memo from</text>

  <text start="2264.579" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m saying is we discussed it I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="2266.23" dur="3.27">we discussed generally the wisdom of</text>
  <text start="2267.819" dur="3.841">answering questions from reporters about</text>
  <text start="2269.5" dur="3.93">different matters what we could say and</text>
  <text start="2271.66" dur="4.199">what we couldn&amp;#39;t say so he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="2273.43" dur="4.5">saying I talked to the media about the</text>
  <text start="2275.859" dur="3.601">memorandum the dossier without letting</text>
  <text start="2277.93" dur="9.24">the media know where I was pulling that</text>
  <text start="2279.46" dur="10.079">information from and on line 17 here he</text>
  <text start="2287.17" dur="4.32">answers and says I think what I said was</text>
  <text start="2289.539" dur="3.03">I had spoken with reporters over the</text>
  <text start="2291.49" dur="2.849">course of the summer and through the</text>

  <text start="2301.869" dur="3.631">and the Russians some of what was</text>
  <text start="2303.7" dur="3.51">discussed and wasn&amp;#39;t some of what we</text>
  <text start="2305.5" dur="4.17">discussed was informed by Chris&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2307.21" dur="3.93">reporting so whether that was I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2309.67" dur="4.77">think there&amp;#39;s any sense that that was an</text>
  <text start="2311.14" dur="5.429">unauthorized thing to do now he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2314.44" dur="4.23">interestingly selective about when he</text>
  <text start="2316.569" dur="3.48">says alleged and when he doesn&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="2318.67" dur="3.929">he&amp;#39;s trying to appear as though he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2320.049" dur="5.03">unbiased he&amp;#39;s clearly biased at this</text>
  <text start="2322.599" dur="5.281">point we know he&amp;#39;s a bias gentleman okay</text>
  <text start="2325.079" dur="4.96">so what he&amp;#39;s trying to do is</text>
  <text start="2327.88" dur="4.649">differentiate himself from making a</text>
  <text start="2330.039" dur="3.721">statement of fact about something that</text>
  <text start="2332.529" dur="4.05">could come back to bite him in the</text>

  <text start="2338.529" dur="5.58">few hours 10 hours he forgets to use the</text>
  <text start="2341.17" dur="4.56">word alleged a lot and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2344.109" dur="9.93">interesting when he does choose to use</text>

  <text start="2491.05" dur="4.23">purpose was to talk to the media about</text>
  <text start="2492.58" dur="6.87">things and they didn&amp;#39;t give orders to</text>
  <text start="2495.28" dur="7.17">one another so basically in here</text>
  <text start="2499.45" dur="4.29">Simpsons saying I never told Christopher</text>
  <text start="2502.45" dur="3.57">Steele to go talk to the media</text>
  <text start="2503.74" dur="3.78">Christopher Steele and I don&amp;#39;t work -</text>
  <text start="2506.02" dur="3.63">you know in that way it wasn&amp;#39;t like a</text>
  <text start="2507.52" dur="4.5">master-servant type of relationship</text>
  <text start="2509.65" dur="4.29">Glenn Simpson is trying to separate</text>
  <text start="2512.02" dur="4.44">himself from the interviews that still</text>
  <text start="2513.94" dur="5.13">gave and make them individuals not boss</text>
  <text start="2516.46" dur="7.37">an employee so even though Steele was a</text>
  <text start="2519.07" dur="4.76">subcontractor taking direction from</text>
  <text start="2525.12" dur="6.28">Simpson and in terms of you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2529.96" dur="3.63">interesting that in that he&amp;#39;s attempting</text>
  <text start="2531.4" dur="3.57">to do that because it insinuates without</text>
  <text start="2533.59" dur="4.38">him coming out and saying it that Steele</text>
  <text start="2534.97" dur="4.47">was working for someone else so it does</text>
  <text start="2537.97" dur="4.08">a few things and let me clarify this for</text>
  <text start="2539.44" dur="4.14">you guys it asserts that that</text>
  <text start="2542.05" dur="3">Christopher Steele was taking direction</text>
  <text start="2543.58" dur="4.98">from someone else without saying it</text>
  <text start="2545.05" dur="4.83">because he&amp;#39;s saying I didn&amp;#39;t tell him to</text>
  <text start="2548.56" dur="4.83">do that somebody else must have told him</text>
  <text start="2549.88" dur="5.34">to do it it also attempts to put a wall</text>
  <text start="2553.39" dur="3.54">between Christopher steel and Glenn</text>
  <text start="2555.22" dur="14.72">Simpson and the actions they took in</text>
  <text start="2556.93" dur="15.78">regards to the media but he&amp;#39;s retained</text>
  <text start="2569.94" dur="5.08">you know Christopher a Glenn Simpson is</text>
  <text start="2572.71" dur="5.61">paying Christopher Steele he&amp;#39;s paying</text>
  <text start="2575.02" dur="5.63">him to do this and so are a lot of other</text>
  <text start="2578.32" dur="5.49">people do you understand what I mean</text>
  <text start="2580.65" dur="5.2">very interesting it really is this is a</text>
  <text start="2583.81" dur="3.96">very very there&amp;#39;s a lot more even in</text>
  <text start="2585.85" dur="4.23">just like reading like several these</text>
  <text start="2587.77" dur="3.69">paragraphs I had several trains of</text>
  <text start="2590.08" dur="3.84">thought that I went through about what</text>
  <text start="2591.46" dur="4.83">this all could mean so I&amp;#39;m just trying</text>
  <text start="2593.92" dur="8.12">to give it to you as basic as I can from</text>
  <text start="2596.29" dur="8.28">what my brain was doing 211 and 212 I</text>
  <text start="2602.04" dur="5.079">tell myself in my notes to read this</text>
  <text start="2604.57" dur="14.219">page completely</text>
  <text start="2607.119" dur="15.12">mr. Davis asks actually the answer I&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="2622.239" dur="3.6">Christopher steel and he says that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2624.249" dur="3.33">difficult question to answer because I</text>

  <text start="2650.799" dur="4.01">approve and then the question is</text>
  <text start="2660.19" dur="3.96">the answer to that question might</text>
  <text start="2662.049" dur="3.601">implicate boat Andrea little doesn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="2664.15" dur="8.33">filing say he did not well our letter to</text>

  <text start="2746.44" dur="4.26">are you talking about reimbursements</text>
  <text start="2748.5" dur="3.91">well we&amp;#39;re talking about fees or</text>
  <text start="2750.7" dur="3.93">reimbursements in this context and</text>
  <text start="2752.41" dur="4.74">Simpson says well we&amp;#39;ve learned that we</text>
  <text start="2754.63" dur="4.229">know that now in fact it was and the</text>
  <text start="2757.15" dur="4.8">questioner interrupts and says learned</text>
  <text start="2758.859" dur="4.621">what and the witness says Simpson says</text>
  <text start="2761.95" dur="3.45">well we learned sometimes after the</text>
  <text start="2763.48" dur="3.45">sometime after the election we learned</text>
  <text start="2765.4" dur="3.51">that Chris had discussed working for the</text>
  <text start="2766.93" dur="5.55">FBI on these matters after the election</text>
  <text start="2768.91" dur="4.98">and that that didn&amp;#39;t happen so Simpson</text>
  <text start="2772.48" dur="4.2">says he learned that Steele may be on</text>
  <text start="2773.89" dur="4.74">the FBI payroll after the fact and</text>
  <text start="2776.68" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t know beforehand I find that very</text>
  <text start="2778.63" dur="4.59">hard to believe all of a sudden as they</text>
  <text start="2781.18" dur="5.129">begin trying to ascertain the answer to</text>
  <text start="2783.22" dur="5.97">that question Simpson gets really tired</text>
  <text start="2786.309" dur="6.901">and he begins to yawn and this is in the</text>
  <text start="2789.19" dur="4.8">record and they take a break the witness</text>
  <text start="2793.21" dur="3.75">is yawning</text>
  <text start="2793.99" dur="4.2">take a break and they break off and then</text>
  <text start="2796.96" dur="8.07">that line of questioning stops</text>
  <text start="2798.19" dur="8.19">completely so they never get back to</text>
  <text start="2805.03" dur="2.94">what happened with the FBI and whether</text>
  <text start="2806.38" dur="14.82">or not he knew that he was on the FBI</text>
  <text start="2807.97" dur="15.96">payroll page 219 through 221 three pages</text>
  <text start="2821.2" dur="8.79">of reading they&amp;#39;re talking about McCain</text>
  <text start="2823.93" dur="7.71">and Kramer okay if you want to know the</text>
  <text start="2829.99" dur="5.25">rest of the story I&amp;#39;m happy to walk you</text>
  <text start="2831.64" dur="5.88">through it sure we can do that so after</text>
  <text start="2835.24" dur="4.17">the election obviously we were as</text>
  <text start="2837.52" dur="4.47">surprised as everyone else about what</text>
  <text start="2839.41" dur="4.5">and Chris and I were mutually concerned</text>
  <text start="2841.99" dur="4.5">about whether the United States has just</text>
  <text start="2843.91" dur="5.19">elected someone who was compromised by a</text>
  <text start="2846.49" dur="4.89">hostile foreign power now let me just</text>
  <text start="2849.1" dur="5.85">stop we were as surprised as everyone</text>
  <text start="2851.38" dur="6.229">else I wasn&amp;#39;t surprised deplorable &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2854.95" dur="7.89">were you guys surprised that Trump won</text>
  <text start="2857.609" dur="8.291">who was surprised the left I thought you</text>
  <text start="2862.84" dur="6.12">were mayest Simpson who was surprised</text>
  <text start="2865.9" dur="7.55">the left you&amp;#39;re on the left you&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="2868.96" dur="4.49">outed yourself just want to say that</text>
  <text start="2873.6" dur="4">Chris and I were mutually concerned</text>
  <text start="2875.92" dur="3.6">about whether the United States had just</text>
  <text start="2877.6" dur="4.74">elected someone who was compromised by a</text>
  <text start="2879.52" dur="4.95">hostile foreign power more in my case</text>
  <text start="2882.34" dur="3.93">whether the election had been tainted by</text>
  <text start="2884.47" dur="4.86">an intervention by Russian intelligence</text>
  <text start="2886.27" dur="5.339">services and we worm you know unsure</text>
  <text start="2889.33" dur="3.63">what to do initially we didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="2891.609" dur="3.331">anything other than to discuss our</text>
  <text start="2892.96" dur="4.95">concerns but we were gravely concerned</text>
  <text start="2894.94" dur="5.01">at some point a few weeks after the</text>
  <text start="2897.91" dur="4.02">election Chris called me and said that</text>
  <text start="2899.95" dur="6.21">he had received an inquiry from David</text>
  <text start="2901.93" dur="7.91">Kramer who was a longtime advisor to</text>
  <text start="2906.16" dur="6.39">Senator McCain and that according to</text>
  <text start="2909.84" dur="4.66">Kramer told Chris that he had run into</text>
  <text start="2912.55" dur="4.92">Sir Andrew wood at a security conference</text>
  <text start="2914.5" dur="5.19">in Halifax Nova Scotia and that Kramer</text>
  <text start="2917.47" dur="4.29">was accompanying Senator McCain to this</text>
  <text start="2919.69" dur="3.87">conference and that the three of them</text>
  <text start="2921.76" dur="3.66">had an unscheduled or unplanned</text>
  <text start="2923.56" dur="3.46">encounter where the issue of this</text>
  <text start="2925.42" dur="4.78">research was discussed</text>
  <text start="2927.02" dur="5.13">and the essence of it I guess was</text>
  <text start="2930.2" dur="4.05">conveyed to Senator McCain and to Cramer</text>
  <text start="2932.15" dur="3.93">from wood I don&amp;#39;t remember whether</text>
  <text start="2934.25" dur="3.33">Andrew woods name was specifically given</text>
  <text start="2936.08" dur="4.29">to me by Christopher Steele at the time</text>
  <text start="2937.58" dur="4.2">it was later given to me it later became</text>
  <text start="2940.37" dur="3.33">an accepted fact that Chris had</text>
  <text start="2941.78" dur="4.38">mentioned him to me I believe he</text>
  <text start="2943.7" dur="3.9">probably mentioned it but anyway he did</text>
  <text start="2946.16" dur="3.27">say someone that he worked with in the</text>
  <text start="2947.6" dur="4.29">past he was a former UK government</text>
  <text start="2949.43" dur="4.23">official with experience in Russia had</text>
  <text start="2951.89" dur="4.02">had this conversation with David Cramer</text>
  <text start="2953.66" dur="4.71">and John McCain and that Senator McCain</text>
  <text start="2955.91" dur="4.16">had followed up on it as to what more</text>
  <text start="2958.37" dur="7.23">there was to know about these Olivia</text>
  <text start="2960.07" dur="7.63">allegations so Chris asked me do you</text>
  <text start="2965.6" dur="4.71">know David Kramer and I said yes I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2967.7" dur="3.96">known David Kramer for a long time David</text>
  <text start="2970.31" dur="2.61">Kramer is part of a small group of</text>
  <text start="2971.66" dur="3.69">people that I&amp;#39;m sort of loosely</text>
  <text start="2972.92" dur="4.17">affiliated with we&amp;#39;ve all worked on</text>
  <text start="2975.35" dur="3.63">Russia and are very concerned about</text>
  <text start="2977.09" dur="3.77">kleptocracy and human rights in the</text>
  <text start="2978.98" dur="4.08">police state that Russia has become in</text>
  <text start="2980.86" dur="3.58">particular the efforts of the Russians</text>
  <text start="2983.06" dur="6.03">to corrupt him mess with our political</text>
  <text start="2984.44" dur="5.73">system so he shared this concern going</text>
  <text start="2989.09" dur="3.57">back to when I was at The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="2990.17" dur="3.96">Journal and that&amp;#39;s how I met David he</text>
  <text start="2992.66" dur="3.21">was working at the State Department as</text>
  <text start="2994.13" dur="4.23">an assistant secretary for Human Rights</text>
  <text start="2995.87" dur="4.56">and I was reporting on human rights and</text>
  <text start="2998.36" dur="4.74">corruption in Russia and Tracy&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="3000.43" dur="3.93">step in here and say listen to the next</text>
  <text start="3003.1" dur="4.02">thing this is how everybody&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="3004.36" dur="5.01">their business so I told Chris he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3007.12" dur="3.69">legit David is someone I&amp;#39;ve known for a</text>
  <text start="3009.37" dur="3.21">long time and he knows a lot about these</text>
  <text start="3010.81" dur="3.36">issues and he&amp;#39;s very concerned about</text>
  <text start="3012.58" dur="3.72">Putin and the Kremlin and the rise of</text>
  <text start="3014.17" dur="4.77">the new Russia and criminality and</text>
  <text start="3016.3" dur="4.74">kleptocracy so he said well can we trust</text>
  <text start="3018.94" dur="4.41">him and I said yeah I think we can trust</text>
  <text start="3021.04" dur="4.35">him and he said he wants information to</text>
  <text start="3023.35" dur="3.81">give to Senator McCain so that Senator</text>
  <text start="3025.39" dur="5.25">McCain can ask questions about it at the</text>
  <text start="3027.16" dur="5.31">FBI with the leadership of the FBI that</text>
  <text start="3030.64" dur="3.42">was essentially all we sort of wanted</text>
  <text start="3032.47" dur="4.71">was for the government to do its job</text>
  <text start="3034.06" dur="3.6">me too Simpson there&amp;#39;s something we</text>
  <text start="3037.18" dur="2.64">agree on</text>
  <text start="3037.66" dur="4.14">and we were concerned about whether the</text>
  <text start="3039.82" dur="3.87">information we provided previously had</text>
  <text start="3041.8" dur="4.53">ever you know risen to the leadership</text>
  <text start="3043.69" dur="4.89">level of the FBI we simply just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3046.33" dur="4.47">know it was our belief that director</text>
  <text start="3048.58" dur="3.84">Comey if he was aware if he was a made</text>
  <text start="3050.8" dur="7.49">aware of this information would treat it</text>
  <text start="3052.42" dur="5.87">seriously again</text>
  <text start="3058.51" dur="6.33">he says at this time you know while we</text>
  <text start="3062.95" dur="4.32">believed we had very credible reporting</text>
  <text start="3064.84" dur="4.53">here you know what we really we just</text>
  <text start="3067.27" dur="3.95">wanted people in official positions to</text>
  <text start="3069.37" dur="6.06">ascertain whether it was accurate or not</text>
  <text start="3071.22" dur="8.14">we felt it was our obligation you know</text>
  <text start="3075.43" dur="6.21">we just felt it was our obligation so it</text>
  <text start="3079.36" dur="6.93">was accurate enough for you to take to</text>
  <text start="3081.64" dur="6.24">the FBI about sexual impropriety the</text>
  <text start="3086.29" dur="5.4">loosest of your allegations in the</text>
  <text start="3087.88" dur="5.76">dossier in my opinion but it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3091.69" dur="3.45">accurate enough that you knew you could</text>
  <text start="3093.64" dur="5.82">depend on it because you needed the FBI</text>
  <text start="3095.14" dur="6.56">to tell you which is hurt I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="3099.46" dur="2.24">frustrated</text>
  <text start="3101.73" dur="4.06">they say McCain&amp;#39;s at the meeting with</text>

  <text start="3311.979" dur="4.681">shows that steel broke off with the FBI</text>
  <text start="3313.929" dur="4.8">he broke off with them likely cuz they</text>

  <text start="3330.039" dur="4.74">around the time when Rogers began</text>
  <text start="3332.529" dur="5.4">objecting to the unmasking issue and he</text>

  <text start="3351.849" dur="4.531">because he just decides that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3354.219" dur="4.921">one on his side there or because he</text>
  <text start="3356.38" dur="6.75">realizes that Admiral Rogers is on to</text>

  <text start="3370.18" dur="8.49">that&amp;#39;s being done the timing kind of</text>
  <text start="3373.989" dur="6.81">matches up there again on page 234 he</text>
  <text start="3378.67" dur="11.549">admits he does not verify what&amp;#39;s inside</text>
  <text start="3380.799" dur="10.621">the dossier on page 235 we get into</text>
  <text start="3390.219" dur="7.08">Carter page</text>
  <text start="3391.42" dur="7.53">Carter page line 25 in any event Simpson</text>
  <text start="3397.299" dur="3.45">says what I would loosely call the</text>
  <text start="3398.95" dur="4.649">Carter page mammal came before this</text>
  <text start="3400.749" dur="4.71">conspiracy memo so with the caveat I can</text>
  <text start="3403.599" dur="4.2">say we were investigating just based on</text>
  <text start="3405.459" dur="4.201">open sources and you know other methods</text>
  <text start="3407.799" dur="4.081">more public information</text>
  <text start="3409.66" dur="4.23">Carter pages trip to Russia we watch</text>
  <text start="3411.88" dur="4.109">tapes of it we did background work on</text>
  <text start="3413.89" dur="3.99">Carter page I did research on his</text>
  <text start="3415.989" dur="4.23">business dealings and in the course of</text>
  <text start="3417.88" dur="4.29">trying to analyze you know this is some</text>
  <text start="3420.219" dur="3.33">new detail here about the operation is</text>
  <text start="3422.17" dur="3.569">working in the Kremlin and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3423.549" dur="4.29">trying to use influence and it comports</text>
  <text start="3425.739" dur="4.08">with my knowledge and Chris&amp;#39;s knowledge</text>
  <text start="3427.839" dur="3.841">of how the Kremlin does this which is</text>
  <text start="3429.819" dur="4.5">they offer people business deals as a</text>
  <text start="3431.68" dur="4.799">way to compromise them and in fact you</text>
  <text start="3434.319" dur="4.29">know to my knowledge this is much bigger</text>
  <text start="3436.479" dur="3.72">issue than personal indiscretions when</text>
  <text start="3438.609" dur="3.18">it comes to the way the Kremlin operates</text>
  <text start="3440.199" dur="4.231">and this is something I know a fair bit</text>
  <text start="3441.789" dur="4.68">about so we looked into Carter page and</text>
  <text start="3444.43" dur="4.559">we also looked into Igor Sechin and</text>
  <text start="3446.469" dur="4.35">whether Sergey Ivanov was in a position</text>
  <text start="3448.989" dur="5.01">to be managing the election operation</text>
  <text start="3450.819" dur="5.04">and we determined he was and I</text>
  <text start="3453.999" dur="4.941">independently verified he does have a</text>
  <text start="3455.859" dur="6.96">deputy who&amp;#39;s very obscure named Igor</text>
  <text start="3458.94" dur="6.389">Divya Khan and then they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="3462.819" dur="6.811">about which memo they&amp;#39;re looking at and</text>
  <text start="3465.329" dur="6.88">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is one of</text>
  <text start="3469.63" dur="4.29">the ways that the Russians compromised</text>
  <text start="3472.209" dur="3.54">people is by offering them business</text>
  <text start="3473.92" dur="3.359">deals and we know that this is true</text>
  <text start="3475.749" dur="3.151">because inside the dossier which</text>
  <text start="3477.279" dur="3.601">discredits itself which we&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="3478.9" dur="4.169">that other video one of the points I</text>
  <text start="3480.88" dur="6.3">make is that in the beginning they say</text>
  <text start="3483.069" dur="5.94">that they have offered Trump several</text>
  <text start="3487.18" dur="5.129">business deals which he&amp;#39;s refused to</text>
  <text start="3489.009" dur="5.79">take so he&amp;#39;s refused their blackmail by</text>
  <text start="3492.309" dur="4.23">their own admission and then later down</text>
  <text start="3494.799" dur="5.371">they say he was desperate for business</text>
  <text start="3496.539" dur="5.601">and Russia then why wouldn&amp;#39;t he accept</text>
  <text start="3500.17" dur="8.1">the blackmail</text>
  <text start="3502.14" dur="7.6">it&amp;#39;s just blaring so he says they</text>
  <text start="3508.27" dur="3.45">compromised by business deals and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3509.74" dur="3.9">why they&amp;#39;re looking into Paige in the</text>
  <text start="3511.72" dur="3.87">dossier they say and in the testimony</text>
  <text start="3513.64" dur="3.74">again that Trump was offered deals to</text>
  <text start="3515.59" dur="3.87">compromise him and he didn&amp;#39;t take them</text>
  <text start="3517.38" dur="3.61">interesting that he wouldn&amp;#39;t take a deal</text>
  <text start="3519.46" dur="5.1">and yet they&amp;#39;re saying he was still</text>
  <text start="3520.99" dur="5.51">compromised Trump and that this is one</text>
  <text start="3524.56" dur="6.6">of the massive red flags in the dossier</text>
  <text start="3526.5" dur="7.39">also red flag Simpson mentions the lack</text>
  <text start="3531.16" dur="8.19">of business in Russia what gives what is</text>
  <text start="3533.89" dur="11.67">it lack thereof or that he took them he</text>
  <text start="3539.35" dur="7.7">didn&amp;#39;t take any on page 239 he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3545.56" dur="3.63">covering for Steele and disinformation</text>
  <text start="3547.05" dur="4.21">basically saying yo you get a lot of</text>
  <text start="3549.19" dur="3.9">disinformation but he&amp;#39;s trained to sniff</text>
  <text start="3551.26" dur="4.11">out the disinformation and I trust his</text>
  <text start="3553.09" dur="3.6">judgment so they went to the FBI with</text>
  <text start="3555.37" dur="9.9">something that they couldn&amp;#39;t be sure was</text>
  <text start="3556.69" dur="10.74">true on page 242 he talks about how</text>
  <text start="3565.27" dur="3.9">Carter page is actually a perfect target</text>
  <text start="3567.43" dur="3.84">for being compromised because he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3569.17" dur="4.14">lightweight and these business deals</text>
  <text start="3571.27" dur="2.79">that he supposedly engaged in how</text>
  <text start="3573.31" dur="3.42">important they are</text>
  <text start="3574.06" dur="4.11">but Simpson reveals that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3576.73" dur="3.72">even keep notes and records on this</text>
  <text start="3578.17" dur="3.72">because it was just widely accepted so</text>
  <text start="3580.45" dur="3.3">the people questioning Steele in this</text>
  <text start="3581.89" dur="3.48">section asked him can you provide us</text>
  <text start="3583.75" dur="4.05">your research on what you did on Carter</text>
  <text start="3585.37" dur="4.46">page and he says no well you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3587.8" dur="9.08">why they know it I don&amp;#39;t have that stuff</text>
  <text start="3589.83" dur="9.25">what talk about a standard in their work</text>
  <text start="3596.88" dur="4.75">where is the standard for your work</text>
  <text start="3599.08" dur="4.92">product oh it&amp;#39;s just widely known we</text>
  <text start="3601.63" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t have any research on it but you go</text>
  <text start="3604" dur="11.73">through crucifying Carter page to the</text>

  <text start="3615.73" dur="8.41">was one close to my heart</text>
  <text start="3618.89" dur="6.78">line 16 to 23 most importantly the</text>

  <text start="3641.029" dur="5.28">what to say he says it&amp;#39;s political</text>

  <text start="3663.22" dur="8.879">I&amp;#39;m sorry page 272 he again talks about</text>

  <text start="3735.799" dur="4.101">they&amp;#39;ve been involved in illicit</text>
  <text start="3736.88" dur="5.699">activity so that&amp;#39;s what I focused on</text>
  <text start="3739.9" dur="8.429">you&amp;#39;re involved in illicit activity mr.</text>
  <text start="3742.579" dur="5.75">Simpson talked about pot calling kettle</text>
  <text start="3748.839" dur="6.46">and then he goes on to say we deal in</text>
  <text start="3753.47" dur="3.629">factual information and over the course</text>
  <text start="3755.299" dur="3.48">of this project we gained lots we</text>
  <text start="3757.099" dur="4.92">gathered lots of facts about Trump</text>
  <text start="3758.779" dur="5.04">Donald Trump if you deal in factual</text>
  <text start="3762.019" dur="3.84">information and that&amp;#39;s what you deal in</text>
  <text start="3763.819" dur="4.05">how are you using open-source human</text>
  <text start="3765.859" dur="14.281">intelligence would you yourself admit is</text>
  <text start="3767.869" dur="13.771">not factual hmm hmm and then he</text>
  <text start="3780.14" dur="3.03">basically goes through and he says there</text>
  <text start="3781.64" dur="2.909">were fraudulent business practices</text>
  <text start="3783.17" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s nothing I can really point to</text>
  <text start="3784.549" dur="3.871">about his taxes his integrity wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3786.5" dur="5.43">good you know some other business</text>
  <text start="3788.42" dur="6.09">associate studies had nothing about he</text>
  <text start="3791.93" dur="4.53">says on page 301 I&amp;#39;m sorry two</text>
  <text start="3794.51" dur="3.69">ninety-nine he says nothing about his</text>
  <text start="3796.46" dur="3.78">taxes inferred a relationship with the</text>
  <text start="3798.2" dur="4.8">Russian government so then why are you</text>
  <text start="3800.24" dur="4.77">still investigating because you have an</text>
  <text start="3803" dur="5.069">agenda and you&amp;#39;re probably being paid</text>
  <text start="3805.01" dur="9.779">and hired to do this probably being paid</text>
  <text start="3808.069" dur="8.79">and hired on page 301 he goes more into</text>
  <text start="3814.789" dur="4.47">what he found out about golf properties</text>
  <text start="3816.859" dur="4.23">as a whole and the only thing that he</text>
  <text start="3819.259" dur="4.05">says he found was that they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3821.089" dur="3.841">profitable he couldn&amp;#39;t point to anything</text>
  <text start="3823.309" dur="4.8">else just that they weren&amp;#39;t profitable</text>
  <text start="3824.93" dur="4.56">and he doesn&amp;#39;t really remember you know</text>
  <text start="3828.109" dur="4.7">because why would you keep stuff like</text>
  <text start="3829.49" dur="8.609">that why would you keep stuff like that</text>

  <text start="3842.45" dur="4.47">looked into a Russian businessman that</text>
  <text start="3844.789" dur="4.621">Donald Trump had done a deal with in</text>
  <text start="3846.92" dur="4.889">Florida probably if you remember my</text>
  <text start="3849.41" dur="5.159">video about the painting that was sold</text>

  <text start="3856.43" dur="10.109">sold his home to and they were able to</text>
  <text start="3860.69" dur="8.849">find that Michael Cohen was connected to</text>
  <text start="3866.539" dur="4.5">him on Twitter and Facebook and it</text>
  <text start="3869.539" dur="4.76">brings up an interesting point for me</text>

  <text start="3885.049" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s because of something like this</text>
