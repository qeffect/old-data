  <text start="308.259" dur="6.19">specifically that they needed help in</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="5.37">this compliance hearing because they</text>
  <text start="314.449" dur="5.161">didn&amp;#39;t have any true auditors in that</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="5.01">area and they wanted me to come in and</text>

  <text start="359.659" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s right I didn&amp;#39;t have anything</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="7.439">juicy at my background I&amp;#39;m pretty boring</text>
  <text start="363.979" dur="8.55">guy so and then they they send you to I</text>
  <text start="369.379" dur="6.72">don&amp;#39;t know whether I did the polygraph</text>
  <text start="372.529" dur="6.301">before after that visit but anyway I had</text>
  <text start="376.099" dur="4.5">to go up I wasn&amp;#39;t living in Wichita at</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="3.809">the time and I had to drive to Kansas</text>
  <text start="380.599" dur="4.68">City no by the way they don&amp;#39;t reimburse</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="4.65">you for mileage to go to do the</text>
  <text start="385.279" dur="7.17">polygraph which I thought was fairly</text>
  <text start="387.289" dur="9.3">cheap yes the government so I drove up</text>
  <text start="392.449" dur="6.101">to Kansas City and went in and did the</text>
  <text start="396.589" dur="4.871">polygraph and passed it</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="6.3">first time and interestingly on my EOD</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="8.22">the interim debtor on duty is what that</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="8.61">is my eld date they stated that only 5%</text>
  <text start="409.68" dur="6.93">of the people who go to the polygraph</text>
  <text start="413.46" dur="4.8">actually pass it the first time which</text>
  <text start="416.61" dur="3.84">indicated they actually give people a</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="4.98">second and third time apparently to try</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="4.95">to pass it which what are they asking</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="2.61">you on the polygraph like what kind of</text>

  <text start="449.31" dur="6.93">you pray you the best position required</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="5.98">and I think most of the FBI positions</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="4.92">require a top-secret security clearance</text>

  <text start="690.47" dur="6.45">and you know there that he was</text>
  <text start="694.16" dur="6.03">universally despised I had four staff in</text>
  <text start="696.92" dur="8.04">Winchester and I had eight staff in</text>
  <text start="700.19" dur="7.53">Washington DC so I realized immediately</text>
  <text start="704.96" dur="5.82">that you know one of the biggest issues</text>
  <text start="707.72" dur="7.07">that I was going to have to deal with</text>
  <text start="710.78" dur="5.91">was you know getting their trust</text>
  <text start="714.79" dur="3.49">understanding who they are and what</text>
  <text start="716.69" dur="5.13">their what their strengths weaknesses</text>
  <text start="718.28" dur="5.37">were because the unit chief was</text>
  <text start="721.82" dur="4.83">basically over the whole unit there are</text>
  <text start="723.65" dur="4.71">really kind of two teams one was my team</text>
  <text start="726.65" dur="4.58">which was a compliance team and the</text>
  <text start="728.36" dur="6.08">other team was the was the else for</text>
  <text start="731.23" dur="8.04">operations with electronic surveillance</text>
  <text start="734.44" dur="4.83">yes electronic surveillance wiretaps</text>
  <text start="739.78" dur="7.27">kind of mainly title three but they also</text>
  <text start="742.79" dur="5.01">work with on the consensual wiretap side</text>
  <text start="747.05" dur="3.45">as well</text>
  <text start="747.8" dur="5.22">what&amp;#39;s a consensual wiretap well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.5" dur="5.43">when that&amp;#39;s what an FBI agent goes to</text>
  <text start="753.02" dur="7.8">somebody and says hey I know that you</text>
  <text start="755.93" dur="8.31">know this person over here and we need</text>
  <text start="760.82" dur="6.769">you to record you know we want you to</text>
  <text start="764.24" dur="7.02">talk to them on the phone and in my view</text>
  <text start="767.589" dur="6.071">entrap them but try to get them to say</text>
  <text start="771.26" dur="7.47">something that will incriminate them so</text>
  <text start="773.66" dur="6.81">we can basically a warrant on someone</text>
  <text start="778.73" dur="3.39">where they don&amp;#39;t have to you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="3.27">to go in and get a warrant because</text>
  <text start="782.12" dur="3.12">you&amp;#39;ve got basically an informant</text>
  <text start="783.74" dur="5.849">working to record a conversation with</text>
  <text start="785.24" dur="6.72">that person right it varies by state to</text>
  <text start="789.589" dur="4.561">some degree but typically</text>
  <text start="791.96" dur="4.32">most states if one person knows that</text>
  <text start="794.15" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s being recorded the whole</text>
  <text start="796.28" dur="4.77">conversation can be recorded there are</text>
  <text start="798.89" dur="6.03">some there are some two party states out</text>
  <text start="801.05" dur="6.54">there in it so that&amp;#39;s really a state</text>
  <text start="804.92" dur="5.64">level issue but that that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="807.59" dur="5.1">really like to do is to get they and</text>
  <text start="810.56" dur="6.2">they consensual can also be an</text>
  <text start="812.69" dur="6.36">undercover undercover person right so</text>
  <text start="816.76" dur="5.05">you don&amp;#39;t and those don&amp;#39;t require a</text>
  <text start="819.05" dur="7.26">court order you go to a judge and say</text>
  <text start="821.81" dur="6.27">I&amp;#39;m gonna do a consensual because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="826.31" dur="3.51">using the existing why the existing</text>
  <text start="828.08" dur="4.02">recording laws or a party consent laws</text>
  <text start="829.82" dur="3.63">to get what you want anyway from and it</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="3.48">saves a lot of time you don&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="833.45" dur="3.54">court it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just a good way for for</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="4.55">agents to get their cases done without</text>
  <text start="836.99" dur="3.14">having to worry about the technicalities</text>
  <text start="841.93" dur="6.55">you know because what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="844.61" dur="5.7">and what what they like to do is go to</text>
  <text start="848.48" dur="3.78">that person and say hey listen if you</text>
  <text start="850.31" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t cooperate with us we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="852.26" dur="4.92">arrest you right and they also like to</text>
  <text start="855.44" dur="3.87">say oh by the way here&amp;#39;s a picture of</text>
  <text start="857.18" dur="4.11">your kids and here&amp;#39;s a picture of your</text>

  <text start="864.32" dur="6.57">where they live and don&amp;#39;t you really</text>
  <text start="867.5" dur="10.62">want to help us now yeah or juice you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="870.89" dur="9.36">seen that happen well I have heard FBI</text>
  <text start="878.12" dur="5.4">agents brag about it okay</text>
  <text start="880.25" dur="4.89">fair enough don&amp;#39;t ever say obviously you</text>
  <text start="883.52" dur="3.03">know not to say anything you can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="885.14" dur="2.76">or anything like that if I ask you a</text>
  <text start="886.55" dur="3.6">question and you can&amp;#39;t answer it to say</text>
  <text start="887.9" dur="4.5">Ken fair enough well I am you know this</text>
  <text start="890.15" dur="6.24">whole issue that I&amp;#39;m involved with there</text>
  <text start="892.4" dur="7.14">is no classified information there is</text>
  <text start="896.39" dur="5.1">yes you know through my form 12 which</text>
  <text start="899.54" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;ll talk about a little bit later this</text>
  <text start="901.49" dur="6.11">has all been laid bare it&amp;#39;s in it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="903.8" dur="6.48">the public yep it&amp;#39;s not classified so</text>
  <text start="907.6" dur="6.67">you know they may they may not like the</text>
  <text start="910.28" dur="6.45">fact that we&amp;#39;re talking about it oh so</text>
  <text start="914.27" dur="5.99">both of them hopefully that free speech</text>
  <text start="916.73" dur="5.75">thing still works and we hope so yeah</text>
  <text start="920.26" dur="3.84">yeah so you go you get there the first</text>
  <text start="922.48" dur="3.84">thing that you need to do probably is</text>
  <text start="924.1" dur="4.47">kind of take a look at what&amp;#39;s there and</text>
  <text start="926.32" dur="4.98">then come up with your ID you&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="928.57" dur="4.53">know basically your questions and what</text>
  <text start="931.3" dur="3.66">you&amp;#39;re gonna ask and how you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="933.1" dur="3.96">perform your duties and did they give</text>
  <text start="934.96" dur="5.64">you like was it like a contract period</text>
  <text start="937.06" dur="8.13">or were you to be there forever oh I was</text>
  <text start="940.6" dur="6.87">I was an FBI employee the FBI and most</text>
  <text start="945.19" dur="6.51">federal agencies have a one-year</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="6.45">probationary period and so I was you</text>
  <text start="951.7" dur="4.53">know I was hoping I was there forever I</text>
  <text start="953.92" dur="5.04">didn&amp;#39;t want to move my family halfway</text>
  <text start="956.23" dur="5.04">across the United States and have to</text>
  <text start="958.96" dur="5.01">move in so I was hoping that I would be</text>
  <text start="961.27" dur="4.83">there forever so you noticed pretty</text>
  <text start="963.97" dur="5.55">quickly that there&amp;#39;s some kind of that</text>
  <text start="966.1" dur="7.32">there&amp;#39;s gonna be issues right what</text>
  <text start="969.52" dur="10.35">happends tell us what happened well the</text>
  <text start="973.42" dur="11.31">the unit chief was he was very very</text>
  <text start="979.87" dur="6.75">socially awkward his day consisted of</text>
  <text start="984.73" dur="4.8">coming in in the morning and shutting</text>
  <text start="986.62" dur="4.11">his office door and occasionally he</text>
  <text start="989.53" dur="4.5">would come out and say inappropriate</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="5.25">things to you know the staff and go back</text>
  <text start="994.03" dur="3.42">into his office they&amp;#39;d go to lunch and</text>
  <text start="995.98" dur="4.35">come back and showed us the war and that</text>
  <text start="997.45" dur="8.03">he be in his office all day and then</text>
  <text start="1000.33" dur="7.47">leave so he he never had any input he</text>
  <text start="1005.48" dur="4.42">didn&amp;#39;t understand how to me he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1007.8" dur="5.01">understand compliance he didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1009.9" dur="4.92">understand the ELSA program and that the</text>
  <text start="1012.81" dur="4.77">program managers Realtors</text>
  <text start="1014.82" dur="4.11">working for so I just want to say again</text>
  <text start="1017.58" dur="2.94">just so that everybody knows and from</text>
  <text start="1018.93" dur="3.21">here on out it&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;ll share is</text>
  <text start="1020.52" dur="2.67">electronic surveillance that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1022.14" dur="3.51">talking about the electronic</text>
  <text start="1023.19" dur="5.52">surveillance program right right and and</text>
  <text start="1025.65" dur="7.32">the supervisor over that group actually</text>
  <text start="1028.71" dur="7.29">yadi with me she she came she was came</text>
  <text start="1032.97" dur="5.94">from the Navy and very sharp very soon</text>
  <text start="1036" dur="4.46">we got along very well and we we worked</text>
  <text start="1038.91" dur="3.99">well together</text>
  <text start="1040.46" dur="5.38">you know I&amp;#39;m technically auditing that</text>
  <text start="1042.9" dur="6.69">program but our audits were concentrated</text>
  <text start="1045.84" dur="5.19">on the field offices okay so they</text>
  <text start="1049.59" dur="4.74">already had</text>
  <text start="1051.03" dur="5.79">what they called QAR Zwicker Quality</text>
  <text start="1054.33" dur="4.14">Assurance reviews they already have</text>
  <text start="1056.82" dur="3.63">those written they had been written for</text>
  <text start="1058.47" dur="6.03">years they&amp;#39;ve been used over and over</text>
  <text start="1060.45" dur="6.36">and over again same one same one same</text>
  <text start="1064.5" dur="5.46">one yeah yeah and that&amp;#39;s not right</text>
  <text start="1066.81" dur="5.82">no no and and there&amp;#39;s actually I was</text>
  <text start="1069.96" dur="7.44">actually oh did two areas one was L sure</text>
  <text start="1072.63" dur="8.13">and one was records management for you</text>
  <text start="1077.4" dur="4.8">know everything everything yeah but you</text>
  <text start="1080.76" dur="5.46">know obviously most of the records</text>
  <text start="1082.2" dur="4.85">renewal offices okay so both of those QA</text>
  <text start="1086.22" dur="4.5">hours</text>
  <text start="1087.05" dur="8.28">Quality Assurance reviews were focused</text>
  <text start="1090.72" dur="9.54">on compliance within the field offices</text>
  <text start="1095.33" dur="7.51">not so much in the overall records</text>
  <text start="1100.26" dur="5.73">management department division that</text>
  <text start="1102.84" dur="4.86">focused on field offices so that makes</text>
  <text start="1105.99" dur="2.94">sense because that&amp;#39;s where all the works</text>
  <text start="1107.7" dur="3.42">being done basically in all the</text>
  <text start="1108.93" dur="4.08">different field offices so you&amp;#39;re your</text>
  <text start="1111.12" dur="4.86">director of the FBI at this time is</text>
  <text start="1113.01" dur="5.61">robert muller you&amp;#39;re traveling around to</text>
  <text start="1115.98" dur="4.26">different field offices are you tasked</text>
  <text start="1118.62" dur="4.59">with the entire country or just certain</text>
  <text start="1120.24" dur="6.9">offices no we do all we did do all the</text>
  <text start="1123.21" dur="7.38">domestic field offices as well as the</text>
  <text start="1127.14" dur="5.25">what they call ras which are resident</text>
  <text start="1130.59" dur="5.19">and I&amp;#39;m not sure what stance a little</text>
  <text start="1132.39" dur="5.6">bit like Tulsa is is an RA okay the</text>
  <text start="1135.78" dur="4.59">actual field offices in Oklahoma City</text>
  <text start="1137.99" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s like satellite offices based</text>
  <text start="1140.37" dur="4.71">satellite offices yeah resident</text>
  <text start="1142.76" dur="6.52">association or resident area or</text>
  <text start="1145.08" dur="5.67">something but those are you know and</text>
  <text start="1149.28" dur="5.46">there are I don&amp;#39;t remember how they</text>
  <text start="1150.75" dur="7.35">there are there 60 or something of field</text>
  <text start="1154.74" dur="5.91">offices plus the RAS we did not do any</text>
  <text start="1158.1" dur="6.75">of what what are called lis gas which</text>
  <text start="1160.65" dur="6.86">are form offices we did not although we</text>
  <text start="1164.85" dur="6.99">were talking about needing to do those</text>
  <text start="1167.51" dur="6.73">and expanding this we had not expanded</text>
  <text start="1171.84" dur="4.86">that at the time that I have left Steve</text>
  <text start="1174.24" dur="5.04">and I really do need to be in part of it</text>
  <text start="1176.7" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;ve got records right yeah and they</text>
  <text start="1179.28" dur="5.46">need to follow the rules and</text>
  <text start="1181.57" dur="5.25">but most of them probably aren&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="1184.74" dur="3.43">well I don&amp;#39;t know this because we really</text>
  <text start="1186.82" dur="4.8">get into I don&amp;#39;t know how much</text>
  <text start="1188.17" dur="6.54">electronic surveillance is being done in</text>
  <text start="1191.62" dur="5.88">these foreign offices of course each</text>
  <text start="1194.71" dur="4.62">country is going to have some law that</text>
  <text start="1197.5" dur="5.28">they have to follow to do those sorts of</text>
  <text start="1199.33" dur="5.64">things sorts of things so we were really</text>
  <text start="1202.78" dur="5.73">concentrating more on what are called</text>
  <text start="1204.97" dur="5.73">title three wiretap that&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1208.51" dur="5.28">have to go get a court order or the</text>
  <text start="1210.7" dur="6.89">consensual in domestically</text>
  <text start="1213.79" dur="3.8">I need encompass device as well correct</text>
  <text start="1217.62" dur="8.35">there were there there was a slice a</text>
  <text start="1220.39" dur="9.14">piece to it we didn&amp;#39;t the the program&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1225.97" dur="7.35">the QA ours that we had really only</text>
  <text start="1229.53" dur="7.48">concentrated on title three however okay</text>
  <text start="1233.32" dur="5.91">right so we had some discussions</text>
  <text start="1237.01" dur="5.67">internally that it really did need to</text>
  <text start="1239.23" dur="9.3">include slicer but there seemed to be</text>
  <text start="1242.68" dur="7.32">some resistance let&amp;#39;s get let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="1248.53" dur="3.21">meat and potatoes now you start to do</text>
  <text start="1250" dur="3.87">your work and immediately you notice</text>
  <text start="1251.74" dur="4.5">that there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s issues what what</text>
  <text start="1253.87" dur="4.14">are you fine - well you know the first</text>
  <text start="1256.24" dur="5.22">thing we try to do is make it less</text>
  <text start="1258.01" dur="7.67">labor-intensive ok and so we had some</text>
  <text start="1261.46" dur="7.53">very sharp people working for me and we</text>
  <text start="1265.68" dur="5.86">put that into Excel and made it you know</text>
  <text start="1268.99" dur="4.26">conditional programming in the cells so</text>
  <text start="1271.54" dur="4.2">if you answer this then it does this and</text>
  <text start="1273.25" dur="6.15">answer them so we tried to automate it</text>
  <text start="1275.74" dur="8.73">we got actually I personally in my</text>
  <text start="1279.4" dur="8.58">department my section we actually got</text>
  <text start="1284.47" dur="5.16">you know kudos from the Inspection</text>
  <text start="1287.98" dur="6.03">Division because we had to work closely</text>
  <text start="1289.63" dur="6.21">with the Inspection Division and they</text>
  <text start="1294.01" dur="4.02">had to kind of approve everything that</text>
  <text start="1295.84" dur="5.4">we did as well kind of a dotted line</text>
  <text start="1298.03" dur="5.91">over the Inspection Division and so Amy</text>
  <text start="1301.24" dur="5.7">Lyons who was the ad or inspection</text>
  <text start="1303.94" dur="5.19">actually sent me a note that said and</text>
  <text start="1306.94" dur="5.07">this is really impressive you know we</text>
  <text start="1309.13" dur="6.09">really thank you so much for you know</text>
  <text start="1312.01" dur="5.25">making this easier because these QA RS</text>
  <text start="1315.22" dur="5.19">are actually filled out by the field</text>
  <text start="1317.26" dur="5.01">office okay it&amp;#39;s kind of they go down</text>
  <text start="1320.41" dur="3.66">through and check the boxes we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1322.27" dur="3.78">this week doing that and they&amp;#39;re worse</text>
  <text start="1324.07" dur="4.65">but we can go back and kind of do some</text>
  <text start="1326.05" dur="7.17">sampling of the questions to make sure</text>
  <text start="1328.72" dur="6.48">so it wasn&amp;#39;t a true true audit because</text>
  <text start="1333.22" dur="5.31">they the field offices were actually</text>
  <text start="1335.2" dur="5.79">doing kind of examining themselves but</text>
  <text start="1338.53" dur="3.92">we were trying to design this so that we</text>
  <text start="1340.99" dur="3.72">could go back and do a little bit more</text>
  <text start="1342.45" dur="4.63">quality assurance that they were truly</text>
  <text start="1344.71" dur="5.03">answering the questions what kind of</text>
  <text start="1347.08" dur="6.78">questions are you asking them well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1349.74" dur="6.31">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s about the process you</text>
  <text start="1353.86" dur="5.4">know the FBI has a process if you want</text>
  <text start="1356.05" dur="6.44">to do a title three wiretap here are the</text>
  <text start="1359.26" dur="6.45">things that you have to do right so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1362.49" dur="4.96">you know you have to get a court order</text>
  <text start="1365.71" dur="6.8">you have to do all those sorts of things</text>
  <text start="1367.45" dur="9.06">you have to query the the wiretap system</text>
  <text start="1372.51" dur="6.67">and this were we maybe we should take a</text>
  <text start="1376.51" dur="5.37">little rabbit trail down on the pile of</text>
  <text start="1379.18" dur="5.61">three yep there&amp;#39;s a couple thing to</text>
  <text start="1381.88" dur="4.38">build a title three wiretap obviously</text>
  <text start="1384.79" dur="5.06">you have to go to a federal judge and</text>
  <text start="1386.26" dur="6.14">you have to say a couple things one</text>
  <text start="1389.85" dur="6.82">we&amp;#39;ve tried to get this information</text>
  <text start="1392.4" dur="7.06">every other way we we&amp;#39;ve you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1396.67" dur="4.68">done this this and this and we we</text>
  <text start="1399.46" dur="5.55">believe me the only way to get this</text>
  <text start="1401.35" dur="6.33">information is to an essence violate</text>
  <text start="1405.01" dur="4.23">this person&amp;#39;s privacy okay that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1407.68" dur="4.2">what a wiretap is and that&amp;#39;s why you</text>
  <text start="1409.24" dur="4.74">have to go to a judge yep yep you have</text>
  <text start="1411.88" dur="6.3">to get the judge to waive their civil</text>
  <text start="1413.98" dur="6.12">rights to privacy okay so you have to</text>
  <text start="1418.18" dur="3.27">say we can&amp;#39;t get this any other way we</text>
  <text start="1420.1" dur="4.65">tried consensual</text>
  <text start="1421.45" dur="6.42">we&amp;#39;ve tried this we&amp;#39;ve tried this the</text>
  <text start="1424.75" dur="5.16">only way we&amp;#39;re gonna get information to</text>
  <text start="1427.87" dur="5.04">help us prosecute this individuals if we</text>
  <text start="1429.91" dur="6.06">work out and then the second thing you</text>
  <text start="1432.91" dur="8.06">have to tell them is whether or not you</text>
  <text start="1435.97" dur="7.5">have ever wiretap that person previously</text>
  <text start="1440.97" dur="5.5">wiretaps are only good for 30 days</text>
  <text start="1443.47" dur="5.31">unless you can get an extension okay</text>
  <text start="1446.47" dur="4.17">okay so you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1448.78" dur="5.4">they build is someone go in and wiretap</text>
  <text start="1450.64" dur="5.37">somebody and then you know 30 days past</text>
  <text start="1454.18" dur="3.63">then you wait 30 days and you go back in</text>
  <text start="1456.01" dur="4.65">and say I need this wiretap and you go</text>
  <text start="1457.81" dur="5.85">to a different judge and got it okay so</text>
  <text start="1460.66" dur="8.28">you have the FBI has to tell the judge</text>
  <text start="1463.66" dur="8.67">whether well what I found in actually</text>
  <text start="1468.94" dur="5.7">through the help of Kim Kandel who will</text>
  <text start="1472.33" dur="4.68">talk about later a 40-year veteran of</text>
  <text start="1474.64" dur="5.73">the FBI was not a special agent but he</text>
  <text start="1477.01" dur="5.7">worked there for 40 years he had</text>
  <text start="1480.37" dur="6.66">discovered this a number of years prior</text>
  <text start="1482.71" dur="10.92">had actually written a memo on it and</text>
  <text start="1487.03" dur="10.59">was told to not index it into the system</text>
  <text start="1493.63" dur="6.24">which means nobody could see it in</text>
  <text start="1497.62" dur="4.8">essence right it covered up so the white</text>
  <text start="1499.87" dur="4.2">paper that he writes doesn&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1502.42" dur="4.86">want it anywhere near anywhere official</text>
  <text start="1504.07" dur="4.59">so he gets thrown under the table and it</text>
  <text start="1507.28" dur="5.94">gets put in a box</text>
  <text start="1508.66" dur="6.72">it literally is put in a box they have</text>
  <text start="1513.22" dur="5.91">since there that they have indexed I</text>
  <text start="1515.38" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t know whether they have see if you</text>
  <text start="1519.13" dur="4.41">could get a FOIA on that but in any</text>
  <text start="1521.29" dur="5.84">event the the biggest issue there were</text>
  <text start="1523.54" dur="7.71">two issues that that that I found and I</text>
  <text start="1527.13" dur="8.17">what&amp;#39;s Kim sit next to me right here</text>
  <text start="1531.25" dur="5.67">right right to my left in a cubicle we</text>
  <text start="1535.3" dur="3.57">could see each other the walls were</text>
  <text start="1536.92" dur="4.29">lowered if I could look over and talk to</text>
  <text start="1538.87" dur="4.5">England he starts to feed me information</text>
  <text start="1541.21" dur="5.34">he actually works for the elephant</text>
  <text start="1543.37" dur="4.68">program so he&amp;#39;s like finally we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1546.55" dur="5.79">some fresh meat we can actually maybe</text>
  <text start="1548.05" dur="5.82">get something done here and so he you</text>
  <text start="1552.34" dur="5.45">know through the process of listening</text>
  <text start="1553.87" dur="10.16">how I work with people you know how I</text>
  <text start="1557.79" dur="10.05">interact and you know I guess he he</text>
  <text start="1564.03" dur="9.7">reads me as someone who has integrity</text>
  <text start="1567.84" dur="9.25">okay that&amp;#39;s the only thing I can think</text>
  <text start="1573.73" dur="5.28">of I like to eat he was very smart a lot</text>
  <text start="1577.09" dur="4.43">of fun I still be still talk every</text>
  <text start="1579.01" dur="4.66">couple months on the phone</text>
  <text start="1581.52" dur="6.53">he&amp;#39;s cut me with some other things but</text>
  <text start="1583.67" dur="8.65">and he starts to confide in me about</text>
  <text start="1588.05" dur="8.95">problems he actually shows me this memo</text>
  <text start="1592.32" dur="6.75">that he wrote and dinner so you know</text>
  <text start="1597" dur="6.72">over the course of several months were</text>
  <text start="1599.07" dur="6.72">talking and I&amp;#39;m like oh my god you know</text>
  <text start="1603.72" dur="7.95">this is a real problem and the QA ours</text>
  <text start="1605.79" dur="7.41">don&amp;#39;t address these problems all yeah so</text>
  <text start="1611.67" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t know about it or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1613.2" dur="3.45">pretending not to know about it what is</text>
  <text start="1615.09" dur="3.089">the problem that we&amp;#39;ve never even gotten</text>
  <text start="1616.65" dur="3.48">there so look what are you what is his</text>
  <text start="1618.179" dur="4.531">white paper say well the section chief</text>
  <text start="1620.13" dur="4.35">did know about it not just the unit</text>
  <text start="1622.71" dur="3.96">chief the section chief and the section</text>
  <text start="1624.48" dur="5.1">chief was the one that told him they sit</text>
  <text start="1626.67" dur="6.15">on section chief you know you got you</text>
  <text start="1629.58" dur="7.37">too chief I&amp;#39;m supervisor unit chief</text>
  <text start="1632.82" dur="7.59">section chief so pretty high up yep</text>
  <text start="1636.95" dur="7.69">reports to the ad section chief reports</text>
  <text start="1640.41" dur="8.64">to the ad of record so three down from</text>
  <text start="1644.64" dur="10.05">the director so two main issues that we</text>
  <text start="1649.05" dur="7.68">find the first is that when you get when</text>
  <text start="1654.69" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re searching to see and this is done</text>
  <text start="1656.73" dur="7.41">in the field offices the L short acts</text>
  <text start="1659.61" dur="6.81">are in the field offices and the special</text>
  <text start="1664.14" dur="4.14">agent is saying hey we need you know we</text>
  <text start="1666.42" dur="6.63">need to we&amp;#39;re gonna go get a court order</text>
  <text start="1668.28" dur="7.83">to attack Bob Jones so I need you to see</text>
  <text start="1673.05" dur="6">if we have ever tapped Bob Jones&amp;#39;s phone</text>
  <text start="1676.11" dur="5.94">everyone before and so the else your</text>
  <text start="1679.05" dur="6.78">tech types Bob Jones into the search and</text>
  <text start="1682.05" dur="6.3">by the way their searches were not you</text>
  <text start="1685.83" dur="4.349">had to type them exactly if you</text>
  <text start="1688.35" dur="3.78">misspelled it it doesn&amp;#39;t give you a</text>
  <text start="1690.179" dur="4.021">suggestion of a hey did you really mean</text>
  <text start="1692.13" dur="5.429">to spell it this way or did you really</text>
  <text start="1694.2" dur="5.06">mean this if you have a extra space in</text>
  <text start="1697.559" dur="3.661">there it&amp;#39;s not going to match so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1699.26" dur="4.06">terrible it was a terrible terrible</text>
  <text start="1701.22" dur="4.8">systems in that perspective but even so</text>
  <text start="1703.32" dur="5.28">even if you wrote Bob you know well</text>
  <text start="1706.02" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s a Bob Smith end in there it will</text>
  <text start="1708.6" dur="3.569">cut it&amp;#39;s supposed to come back and say</text>
  <text start="1710.37" dur="3.87">either yes or no</text>
  <text start="1712.169" dur="5.201">we have wiretap</text>
  <text start="1714.24" dur="4.27">okay well somewhere along the way people</text>
  <text start="1717.37" dur="3.42">would look at Hill</text>
  <text start="1718.51" dur="5.48">I put Bob Smith in here and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1720.79" dur="7.889">pretty common name and I got a negative</text>
  <text start="1723.99" dur="6.64">okay and that doesn&amp;#39;t seem right they</text>
  <text start="1728.679" dur="4.651">would reach down and turn the computer</text>
  <text start="1730.63" dur="7.11">off turn it back on</text>
  <text start="1733.33" dur="8.79">I&amp;#39;m not lying you know the first rule of</text>
  <text start="1737.74" dur="6.3">PC repair right turn it off and restart</text>
  <text start="1742.12" dur="4.38">the computer they did that they would</text>
  <text start="1744.04" dur="8.22">put Bob Smith in and they would get a</text>
  <text start="1746.5" dur="9.39">hit well maybe a really common name like</text>
  <text start="1752.26" dur="6.63">Bob Smith you might think about turning</text>
  <text start="1755.89" dur="5.81">the computer off and turn it back on but</text>
  <text start="1758.89" dur="6.3">what what what if it&amp;#39;s June soon work</text>
  <text start="1761.7" dur="6.729">yeah are you going to say well I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1765.19" dur="5.869">get a hit on that should I go to the</text>
  <text start="1768.429" dur="6.781">trouble of rebooting my machine and</text>
  <text start="1771.059" dur="5.411">researching why was that happening did</text>
  <text start="1775.21" dur="4.469">they ever determine what the technical</text>
  <text start="1776.47" dur="7.82">glitch was or was it on purpose or yeah</text>
  <text start="1779.679" dur="7.221">they the systems at the FBI were so old</text>
  <text start="1784.29" dur="5.62">the languages that they were written in</text>
  <text start="1786.9" dur="6.63">you know for people in the United States</text>
  <text start="1789.91" dur="6.39">could still program in that language</text>
  <text start="1793.53" dur="6.399">even the main sister main indexing</text>
  <text start="1796.3" dur="5.85">system which was called ACS like say</text>
  <text start="1799.929" dur="6.241">there was like two people in the whole</text>
  <text start="1802.15" dur="7.35">FBI that can even try to fix stuff in it</text>
  <text start="1806.17" dur="6.78">right so I don&amp;#39;t know that there&amp;#39;s any</text>
  <text start="1809.5" dur="8.91">definitive determination what it was you</text>
  <text start="1812.95" dur="7.64">know it just and they knew about it but</text>
  <text start="1818.41" dur="5.01">they didn&amp;#39;t try to fix it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1820.59" dur="5.56">when I say they lied to federal judges</text>
  <text start="1823.42" dur="4.62">about this it&amp;#39;s probably more omission</text>
  <text start="1826.15" dur="4.23">than Commission at least at the field</text>
  <text start="1828.04" dur="5.49">office level but the field office knew</text>
  <text start="1830.38" dur="4.77">it right and and you don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1833.53" dur="3.6">kind of extra steps they might have</text>
  <text start="1835.15" dur="4.37">taken to try to make sure that they will</text>
  <text start="1837.13" dur="5.94">really get in the proper information so</text>
  <text start="1839.52" dur="7.03">and that was probably we&amp;#39;re guessing for</text>
  <text start="1843.07" dur="3.87">ten years possibly this system has been</text>
  <text start="1846.55" dur="1.469">bro</text>
  <text start="1846.94" dur="5.159">so it wasn&amp;#39;t just something that</text>
  <text start="1848.019" dur="5.551">happened this month right the month and</text>
  <text start="1852.099" dur="3.57">I happened to be looking at this right</text>
  <text start="1853.57" dur="6.299">this was a couple years before I even</text>
  <text start="1855.669" dur="5.82">arrived when Kim found this issue so</text>
  <text start="1859.869" dur="6.99">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the first issue</text>
  <text start="1861.489" dur="8.221">okay keep going yeah so he gets even</text>
  <text start="1866.859" dur="5.39">better so the other thing that that that</text>
  <text start="1869.71" dur="8.339">someone had programmed into the system</text>
  <text start="1872.249" dur="8.56">was the ability to hide records so if</text>
  <text start="1878.049" dur="4.891">someone determined that they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1880.809" dur="5.67">us to know that Bob Smith had been</text>
  <text start="1882.94" dur="6.719">wiretap before they could go into the</text>
  <text start="1886.479" dur="6.63">system and annotate in check a box or do</text>
  <text start="1889.659" dur="9.38">something and say there&amp;#39;s someone if</text>
  <text start="1893.109" dur="11.64">anybody searches for Bob Smith hiding</text>
  <text start="1899.039" dur="8.411">okay why people did that I that seems</text>
  <text start="1904.749" dur="3.87">pretty malicious in my opinion I know I</text>
  <text start="1907.45" dur="3.809">don&amp;#39;t see why there would be a</text>
  <text start="1908.619" dur="2.971">legitimate reason for doing that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1911.259" dur="2.64">either</text>
  <text start="1911.59" dur="5.009">yeah and I was never I didn&amp;#39;t I was</text>
  <text start="1913.899" dur="6.301">never able to go and ask the people who</text>
  <text start="1916.599" dur="5.341">did those files just find out why they</text>
  <text start="1920.2" dur="4.409">did it we were just we just knew that</text>
  <text start="1921.94" dur="5.809">they were there and that therefore any</text>
  <text start="1924.609" dur="6.87">searches were not 100%</text>
  <text start="1927.749" dur="8.86">now the FBI said there were only only</text>
  <text start="1931.479" dur="7.83">six files right they admitted it in the</text>
  <text start="1936.609" dur="4.831">form twelve investigation they did</text>
  <text start="1939.309" dur="5.43">surprisingly even though they said I</text>
  <text start="1941.44" dur="6.78">wasn&amp;#39;t right they admitted that yes in</text>
  <text start="1944.739" dur="8.51">fact there were records hidden well</text>
  <text start="1948.22" dur="9.299">that&amp;#39;s six cases that the sheriff was</text>
  <text start="1953.249" dur="5.74">discovery was incomplete not only</text>
  <text start="1957.519" dur="4.201">incomplete but they&amp;#39;re even if they</text>
  <text start="1958.989" dur="5.52">committed a crime on the second warrant</text>
  <text start="1961.72" dur="5.009">which was really in the judges eyes the</text>
  <text start="1964.509" dur="3.811">first warrant that&amp;#39;s a problem for the</text>
  <text start="1966.729" dur="5.16">case as a whole and for that person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1968.32" dur="5.4">rights guilty or not all right so the</text>
  <text start="1971.889" dur="3.331">whole legal the whole legal process is</text>
  <text start="1973.72" dur="2.53">basically blown to smithereens when you</text>
  <text start="1975.22" dur="4.959">do things like that</text>
  <text start="1976.25" dur="8.13">yeah yeah it the you are you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1980.179" dur="9.951">providing false information you know</text>
  <text start="1984.38" dur="8.1">someone in the FBI knows they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1990.13" dur="6.1">when did you discover this stuff like</text>
  <text start="1992.48" dur="5.67">when did did your compadre and in your</text>
  <text start="1996.23" dur="3.84">cubicle next to you start telling you</text>
  <text start="1998.15" dur="6.029">this and how long were you allowed to</text>
  <text start="2000.07" dur="9.66">continue to look before everything went</text>
  <text start="2004.179" dur="7.62">south well it&amp;#39;s been a lot of years I</text>
  <text start="2009.73" dur="5.99">don&amp;#39;t remember the exact timing it was</text>
  <text start="2011.799" dur="7.051">later you know I started in March I</text>
  <text start="2015.72" dur="6.64">received my excellent and outstanding</text>
  <text start="2018.85" dur="5.61">performance rating and you know for the</text>
  <text start="2022.36" dur="4.92">fiscal year which is in in September I</text>
  <text start="2024.46" dur="4.949">got that in late October I&amp;#39;m thinking it</text>
  <text start="2027.28" dur="5.279">was in that kind of in that time period</text>
  <text start="2029.409" dur="8.161">year I was really starting to uncover</text>
  <text start="2032.559" dur="7.201">you know an understanding in and you</text>
  <text start="2037.57" dur="5.01">know just seeing things that I was</text>
  <text start="2039.76" dur="5.52">uncomfortable with so you start in March</text>
  <text start="2042.58" dur="4.89">you work for about six months or so they</text>
  <text start="2045.28" dur="4.41">give you a glowing review with like</text>

  <text start="2093.82" dur="3.72">you do that and then you start to</text>
  <text start="2095.71" dur="3.42">uncover things because it takes I would</text>
  <text start="2097.54" dur="3.059">have to say to onboard yourself and get</text>
  <text start="2099.13" dur="3.42">familiar with processes and procedures</text>
  <text start="2100.599" dur="3.781">you&amp;#39;re not an FBI guy you&amp;#39;re just coming</text>
  <text start="2102.55" dur="3.24">into this from the beginning so it takes</text>
  <text start="2104.38" dur="2.94">a while to acclimate yourself to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2105.79" dur="2.91">going on get to know the people and all</text>
  <text start="2107.32" dur="2.42">the stuff we talked about and now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2108.7" dur="2.659">starting to really</text>
  <text start="2109.74" dur="3.81">peel back the layers of the onion and</text>
  <text start="2111.359" dur="7.051">see the kind of dirty that you&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="2113.55" dur="6.93">to supposedly there to fix right yeah</text>
  <text start="2118.41" dur="4.83">and you&amp;#39;ve asked me well why would they</text>
  <text start="2120.48" dur="6.21">hire you to fix it if they really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2123.24" dur="7.47">want to fix it I think I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2126.69" dur="7.56">they thought that I was gonna find I</text>
  <text start="2130.71" dur="6.09">mean quite frankly you know until I got</text>
  <text start="2134.25" dur="4.52">there and then you know I started doing</text>
  <text start="2136.8" dur="4.02">these things and make improving things</text>
  <text start="2138.77" dur="3.849">and I think there was actually some</text>
  <text start="2140.82" dur="3.33">jealousy from this you know chief that I</text>
  <text start="2142.619" dur="4.141">was actually getting in love with the</text>
  <text start="2144.15" dur="4.92">staff and they were confiding in me and</text>
  <text start="2146.76" dur="4.77">we were working well together and we</text>
  <text start="2149.07" dur="4.769">were making a lot of progress he hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2151.53" dur="5.54">been able to do any of that so I think I</text>
  <text start="2153.839" dur="6.601">think he was probably upset about that</text>
  <text start="2157.07" dur="5.44">you know we had we also had the sexual</text>
  <text start="2160.44" dur="5.07">and verbal harassment issue with one of</text>
  <text start="2162.51" dur="6">my staff yep that we haven&amp;#39;t gone into a</text>
  <text start="2165.51" dur="6.81">lot here I think that&amp;#39;s part of it too</text>
  <text start="2168.51" dur="7.23">I mean I think there&amp;#39;s a you know I</text>
  <text start="2172.32" dur="5.31">think I just got under his skin because</text>
  <text start="2175.74" dur="5.52">I was doing my job and he was getting</text>
  <text start="2177.63" dur="6.93">pushback for management especially on</text>
  <text start="2181.26" dur="6.089">this record-keeping QAR that they asked</text>
  <text start="2184.56" dur="5.85">us to write and we got respect on that</text>
  <text start="2187.349" dur="5.631">we can cover that as well but you know I</text>
  <text start="2190.41" dur="5.4">think I think and then you know then the</text>
  <text start="2192.98" dur="6.76">sexual harassment thing with my staff</text>
  <text start="2195.81" dur="9.12">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t I wouldn&amp;#39;t support him in</text>
  <text start="2199.74" dur="8.94">the way that he acted torture and I</text>
  <text start="2204.93" dur="7.32">tried to she had T dy DT dy duh</text>

  <text start="2212.25" dur="5.7">another little area in Winchester and</text>
  <text start="2214.619" dur="5.701">got away from him for a month or two and</text>
  <text start="2217.95" dur="5.54">then she wanted to stay away she wanted</text>
  <text start="2220.32" dur="7.73">to permit transfer</text>
  <text start="2223.49" dur="6.09">and he was gonna have none of it and and</text>
  <text start="2228.05" dur="3.45">this went through this particular</text>
  <text start="2229.58" dur="3.42">complaint which we&amp;#39;ll get into at the</text>
  <text start="2231.5" dur="2.88">end if we have time because she was one</text>
  <text start="2233" dur="4.2">of the witnesses that signed an</text>
  <text start="2234.38" dur="5.34">affidavit if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken yes um she</text>
  <text start="2237.2" dur="5.1">she actually filed a formal complaint</text>
  <text start="2239.72" dur="4.26">about him this is on the books this was</text>
  <text start="2242.3" dur="3">not some just like he said she said</text>

  <text start="2257.119" dur="6.481">complaint they told the section chief</text>
  <text start="2260.56" dur="7.69">and then the section chief told the unit</text>
  <text start="2263.6" dur="6.33">chief and you achieve confronted her so</text>
  <text start="2268.25" dur="4.85">this is common we&amp;#39;ve seen this happen</text>
  <text start="2269.93" dur="6.21">several times with especially female</text>
  <text start="2273.1" dur="5.35">employees of the FBI Robyn being one of</text>
  <text start="2276.14" dur="5.55">them that this sort of a thing happens</text>
  <text start="2278.45" dur="4.83">and so I&amp;#39;m not one of those women who</text>
  <text start="2281.69" dur="3.45">are like oh my gosh women they&amp;#39;re held</text>
  <text start="2283.28" dur="6.03">down it&amp;#39;s always about that&amp;#39;s not how I</text>

  <text start="2298.94" dur="9.09">this was after I left because of this of</text>
  <text start="2303.56" dur="8.61">the stress coming to work each day so it</text>
  <text start="2308.03" dur="7.77">was very wouldn&amp;#39;t just a you know he</text>

  <text start="2322.369" dur="7.471">wasn&amp;#39;t a sexual issue but it was a his</text>
  <text start="2326.24" dur="6.26">tone in his the way he spoke to her was</text>
  <text start="2329.84" dur="5.31">unprofessional uncalled for</text>
  <text start="2332.5" dur="6.85">after we came out I actually apologized</text>
  <text start="2335.15" dur="10.65">to her and I you know I think because I</text>
  <text start="2339.35" dur="9.96">wouldn&amp;#39;t I wouldn&amp;#39;t fall behind him and</text>

  <text start="2349.31" dur="6.03">was part of it as well and I even I even</text>

  <text start="2391.72" dur="3.869">sessions with her and that he kind of</text>
  <text start="2393.64" dur="4.32">refused to do any more so I think there</text>

  <text start="2413.53" dur="6.809">text messages correct yeah well you know</text>
  <text start="2416.38" dur="5.489">the there was always the question of if</text>

  <text start="2421.869" dur="7.98">management side what is a record okay</text>
  <text start="2427.15" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s a fundamental question what do we</text>
  <text start="2429.849" dur="8.041">consider a record of course this you</text>
  <text start="2433.21" dur="9.3">know again this is 2010 2011 you know</text>
  <text start="2437.89" dur="6.87">social media is kind of starting you</text>
  <text start="2442.51" dur="4.47">know of course we have text messages we</text>
  <text start="2444.76" dur="7.92">have things like that but the position</text>
  <text start="2446.98" dur="9.089">of section chief was that the only</text>
  <text start="2452.68" dur="6.57">record is a piece of anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2456.069" dur="6.51">printed out on a piece of paper so that</text>
  <text start="2459.25" dur="5.369">means in terms of FOIA responsiveness in</text>
  <text start="2462.579" dur="3.631">terms of anything the only thing that a</text>
  <text start="2464.619" dur="4.111">wreck was considered a record was</text>
  <text start="2466.21" dur="5.31">something that was physical on a piece</text>
  <text start="2468.73" dur="4.77">of paper so any emails that were sent or</text>
  <text start="2471.52" dur="5.069">messages that were sent or anything done</text>
  <text start="2473.5" dur="5.819">on an electronic device is not included</text>

  <text start="2486.039" dur="7.181">upper level management well like like</text>
  <text start="2490.88" dur="4.29">I think that yeah I think they look to</text>

  <text start="2528.08" dur="5.94">right of course there there&amp;#39;s two email</text>
  <text start="2530.99" dur="6.6">systems at the FBI there&amp;#39;s an external</text>
  <text start="2534.02" dur="6.09">email system which means if you if you</text>
  <text start="2537.59" dur="6.12">find somebody&amp;#39;s email and email them</text>
  <text start="2540.11" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;ll get it on this one machine okay</text>
  <text start="2543.71" dur="5.61">and then internal like land internal and</text>
  <text start="2546.8" dur="4.77">those boxes have to be like five feet</text>
  <text start="2549.32" dur="4.02">apart and you know there&amp;#39;s all sorts of</text>
  <text start="2551.57" dur="4.53">security issues that you have to worry</text>
  <text start="2553.34" dur="6.74">about but that&amp;#39;s external and there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2556.1" dur="8.25">interval system okay the external system</text>
  <text start="2560.08" dur="7.57">is well both of them can produce records</text>
  <text start="2564.35" dur="6.03">and they do an email is a record look at</text>
  <text start="2567.65" dur="8.52">the the you know the federal Records Act</text>
  <text start="2570.38" dur="8.43">of 1963 or whatever year it is it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2576.17" dur="5.1">very specific as to what a record is and</text>
  <text start="2578.81" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s been you know there&amp;#39;s case law</text>
  <text start="2581.27" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s been other things later that</text>
  <text start="2582.98" dur="8.12">have come back and said an email is a</text>
  <text start="2585.92" dur="7.47">record a text is a record but the FBI</text>
  <text start="2591.1" dur="3.91">unfortunately thinks that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2593.39" dur="3.84">really need to play by the same rules</text>
  <text start="2595.01" dur="4.44">and they&amp;#39;re pretty they&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="2597.23" dur="6.33">upfront about it I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="2599.45" dur="6.18">right I mean all the recent stuff is you</text>
  <text start="2603.56" dur="3.27">know I don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m gonna play by that</text>
  <text start="2605.63" dur="6.18">rule I&amp;#39;m gonna do it my way</text>
  <text start="2606.83" dur="8.19">so it&amp;#39;s that and we&amp;#39;ve talked about it</text>
  <text start="2611.81" dur="4.65">the agents are first go through military</text>
  <text start="2615.02" dur="6.15">training at Quantico</text>
  <text start="2616.46" dur="6.48">okay you make may think it&amp;#39;s just a you</text>
  <text start="2621.17" dur="3.39">know a month at Quantico no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2622.94" dur="4.38">military training</text>
  <text start="2624.56" dur="5.82">and they break you down and you tow the</text>
  <text start="2627.32" dur="6.2">line and the FBI is everything and the</text>
  <text start="2630.38" dur="7.68">FBI nobody in the FBI ever makes inspect</text>
  <text start="2633.52" dur="7.24">you&amp;#39;ll never hear an FBI agent admit</text>
  <text start="2638.06" dur="6">that they made a mistake I challenge you</text>
  <text start="2640.76" dur="6.24">to try to go find a quote I&amp;#39;m an FBI</text>
  <text start="2644.06" dur="3.51">agent or an official that ever says I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2647" dur="4.89">sorry</text>
  <text start="2647.57" dur="7.83">maybe they can&amp;#39;t yes they can it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2651.89" dur="7.89">drilled into you know you can&amp;#39;t it just</text>
  <text start="2655.4" dur="6.63">so it sits no that&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="2659.78" dur="3.63">this conversation because this is the</text>
  <text start="2662.03" dur="3.93">sort of thing you&amp;#39;re dealing with even</text>
  <text start="2663.41" dur="4.83">so you find you find the records issue</text>
  <text start="2665.96" dur="4.29">and then you stated in the rebuttal</text>
  <text start="2668.24" dur="4.14">report that you wrote in response to the</text>
  <text start="2670.25" dur="4.74">FBI&amp;#39;s quote investigation and remember</text>
  <text start="2672.38" dur="4.38">you you mentioned that we you had to</text>
  <text start="2674.99" dur="3.87">work very closely with the Inspection</text>
  <text start="2676.76" dur="5.94">Division right would you come in handy</text>
  <text start="2678.86" dur="5.13">in a minute they when they leave am i</text>
  <text start="2682.7" dur="3.78">reading this correctly in your stuff</text>
  <text start="2683.99" dur="5.04">when they read when they leave if an</text>
  <text start="2686.48" dur="5.49">agent leaves they&amp;#39;re then responsible</text>

  <text start="2703.85" dur="7.53">into the ACS system and the ACS of them</text>
  <text start="2707.41" dur="10.6">was very rudimentary by the way it had</text>
  <text start="2711.38" dur="10.64">one field to index so you can index a</text>
  <text start="2718.01" dur="9.03">name the license plate and address</text>

  <text start="2727.04" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s an as we talked about it&amp;#39;s a risk</text>
  <text start="2729.32" dur="4.71">is it still in existence or did they</text>
  <text start="2731.9" dur="4.56">swap it do you know well you know they</text>
  <text start="2734.03" dur="5.28">when I was there they were trying to I</text>
  <text start="2736.46" dur="5.72">think they called it Sentinel or they</text>
  <text start="2739.31" dur="7.92">had some name for it they were trying to</text>
  <text start="2742.18" dur="9.66">modernize that system but it was really</text>
  <text start="2747.23" dur="7.41">just a 1/2 billion dollar GUI interface</text>
  <text start="2751.84" dur="5.29">ok it was still using this base</text>
  <text start="2754.64" dur="3.54">information over here but they were</text>
  <text start="2757.13" dur="4.29">trying to tap</text>
  <text start="2758.18" dur="5.1">some like work flow kind of stuff you</text>
  <text start="2761.42" dur="4.32">know I&amp;#39;m gonna write a memo and then I</text>
  <text start="2763.28" dur="4.05">can send it billy-bob over here to read</text>
  <text start="2765.74" dur="5.58">it and approve and then I can send it up</text>
  <text start="2767.33" dur="6.26">here right but the base information was</text>
  <text start="2771.32" dur="4.98">still in this our cake</text>
  <text start="2773.59" dur="5.35">unknown language I know it might have</text>
  <text start="2776.3" dur="6.24">been you know you know Sanskrit for all</text>
  <text start="2778.94" dur="5.76">I know but it was oh right and it was</text>
  <text start="2782.54" dur="4.65">you when you did a search you had to</text>
  <text start="2784.7" dur="4.98">type it in exactly it didn&amp;#39;t give you</text>
  <text start="2787.19" dur="3.9">any they did you really mean to search</text>
  <text start="2789.68" dur="3.72">on this yeah we wouldn&amp;#39;t give you</text>
  <text start="2791.09" dur="4.32">everything from like ABC forward it</text>
  <text start="2793.4" dur="4.74">would tell you like you need ABCDE if</text>
  <text start="2795.41" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s what the name is yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="2798.14" dur="3.5">I&amp;#39;d have to imagine that this has</text>
  <text start="2799.52" dur="5.64">changed a little bit because we get</text>
  <text start="2801.64" dur="6.19">homey responsive records we get you know</text>
  <text start="2805.16" dur="4.32">we get struck in page so they had to</text>
  <text start="2807.83" dur="4.86">have indexed their email system at some</text>
  <text start="2809.48" dur="5.42">point hi doggy you said this was gonna</text>
  <text start="2812.69" dur="2.21">happen</text>
  <text start="2818.65" dur="6.19">don&amp;#39;t get on that porch that&amp;#39;s funny so</text>
  <text start="2822.41" dur="3.81">you know I have to assume that at some</text>
  <text start="2824.84" dur="4.02">point they were able to upgrade to you</text>
  <text start="2826.22" dur="4.35">you find all this and then you offer by</text>
  <text start="2828.86" dur="4.35">the way you can go there have been</text>
  <text start="2830.57" dur="4.89">there&amp;#39;s been Senate in congressional</text>
  <text start="2833.21" dur="4.86">testimony on this system that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2835.46" dur="4.56">been trying to do because as with</text>
  <text start="2838.07" dur="6.15">anything government does they&amp;#39;ve had to</text>
  <text start="2840.02" dur="6.96">go back and ask for more money I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2844.22" dur="5.1">followed it that that be you know</text>
  <text start="2846.98" dur="4.74">anybody wants to go out look I think it</text>
  <text start="2849.32" dur="4.83">was called Sentinel but I might be wrong</text>
  <text start="2851.72" dur="5.61">but there was this system that they were</text>
  <text start="2854.15" dur="6.15">trying to do I don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2857.33" dur="4.23">done and where they finished it you know</text>
  <text start="2860.3" dur="3.54">I don&amp;#39;t know how many millions of</text>
  <text start="2861.56" dur="5.16">records are in the old system and not in</text>
  <text start="2863.84" dur="6.9">any one not in the new one whether they</text>
  <text start="2866.72" dur="5.13">tried to feed it over I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="2870.74" dur="2.43">be it might be another really</text>
  <text start="2871.85" dur="4.17">interesting thing to looking at me</text>
  <text start="2873.17" dur="4.86">because when I was there in 2000 2010 11</text>
  <text start="2876.02" dur="4.53">I think they were up to half a billion</text>
  <text start="2878.03" dur="5.34">dollars on this thing and all they</text>
  <text start="2880.55" dur="6.66">really had was this GUI interface that</text>
  <text start="2883.37" dur="5.88">had a little bit of work flow and</text>
  <text start="2887.21" dur="3.96">half a billion dollars for that yeah you</text>
  <text start="2889.25" dur="3.27">know it&amp;#39;s crazy but like again corporate</text>
  <text start="2891.17" dur="3.389">America would have treated that half a</text>
  <text start="2892.52" dur="7.039">billion and had like the most high-tech</text>
  <text start="2894.559" dur="8.52">amazing system in the world and then</text>
  <text start="2899.559" dur="5.8">when I asked them about that system and</text>
  <text start="2903.079" dur="5.581">I said because there&amp;#39;s some DoD</text>
  <text start="2905.359" dur="6.331">regulations that they need to follow on</text>
  <text start="2908.66" dur="9.959">how you build these kind of systems and</text>
  <text start="2911.69" dur="13.02">when I asked that question does this</text>
  <text start="2918.619" dur="9.591">meet this new standard they would not in</text>
  <text start="2924.71" dur="6.74">the ANSI standards you can see reading</text>
  <text start="2928.21" dur="5.8">you know they would look at me like even</text>
  <text start="2931.45" dur="4.6">mirrors what do you what are you talking</text>
  <text start="2934.01" dur="3.54">about I said we&amp;#39;ll all right we&amp;#39;ll try</text>
  <text start="2936.05" dur="2.94">to explain to them that there were these</text>
  <text start="2937.55" dur="6.45">things that they probably needed to</text>
  <text start="2938.99" dur="11.16">consider so the other thing that you</text>
  <text start="2944" dur="8.4">found in your travels yeah well this</text>
  <text start="2950.15" dur="4.38">next one really blew my mind in terms of</text>
  <text start="2952.4" dur="3.78">evidence cataloging this was physical</text>
  <text start="2954.53" dur="4.47">evidence if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken that was</text>
  <text start="2956.18" dur="4.35">being bulk categorized so each evidence</text>
  <text start="2959" dur="4.02">each piece of evidence is supposed to</text>
  <text start="2960.53" dur="4.769">have its own number unique kind of in</text>
  <text start="2963.02" dur="4.11">you know identifier and they were</text>
  <text start="2965.299" dur="5.79">basically throwing pieces of evidence in</text>
  <text start="2967.13" dur="6.87">a box and cataloging the box and then</text>
  <text start="2971.089" dur="5.46">losing evidence to explain that well</text>
  <text start="2974" dur="7.02">when I was there they they were moving</text>
  <text start="2976.549" dur="8.131">there the 9/11 investigation was</text>
  <text start="2981.02" dur="7.11">actually done at headquarters it was not</text>
  <text start="2984.68" dur="6.389">done at the field office there have been</text>
  <text start="2988.13" dur="7.26">some other ones since then that are have</text>
  <text start="2991.069" dur="6.601">been quote in headquarters cases and</text>
  <text start="2995.39" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re usually big you know big cases</text>
  <text start="2997.67" dur="5.04">you know people want to be able to get</text>
  <text start="2999.68" dur="4.409">out for the camera and be all important</text>
  <text start="3002.71" dur="3.659">and everything so it goes to</text>
  <text start="3004.089" dur="6.601">headquarters but anyway they had it so</text>
  <text start="3006.369" dur="7.411">they had a every every location every</text>
  <text start="3010.69" dur="6.59">field office that does any type of L</text>
  <text start="3013.78" dur="6.98">sure worked as a</text>
  <text start="3017.28" dur="6.45">a file room with secure foundry ok</text>
  <text start="3020.76" dur="4.38">locked and you know you know access</text>
  <text start="3023.73" dur="4.32">control world a whole bit</text>
  <text start="3025.14" dur="4.8">and one at headquarters they wanted to</text>
  <text start="3028.05" dur="5.19">move it was down in the basement and</text>
  <text start="3029.94" dur="5.67">they were for one reason or another date</text>
  <text start="3033.24" dur="4.32">they wanted to move it by well to do</text>
  <text start="3035.61" dur="5.1">that you have to be too inventories you</text>
  <text start="3037.56" dur="6.75">do one before the move and you do one</text>
  <text start="3040.71" dur="7.44">after the move okay so the first the</text>
  <text start="3044.31" dur="6.78">first one myself and the supervisor over</text>
  <text start="3048.15" dur="9.14">the ultra program we with headquarters</text>
  <text start="3051.09" dur="8.58">and then you know did an inventory and</text>
  <text start="3057.29" dur="4.27">most of them mostly most of the</text>
  <text start="3059.67" dur="4.32">inventory was properly done it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="3061.56" dur="5.79">piece of evidence it&amp;#39;s one you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3063.99" dur="7.08">one entry in the inventory has a barcode</text>
  <text start="3067.35" dur="5.46">on it so you can inventory it pretty</text>
  <text start="3071.07" dur="3.72">quickly with a scanner and those sorts</text>
  <text start="3072.81" dur="3.63">of things but there were I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3074.79" dur="8.18">how many there were there were three are</text>
  <text start="3076.44" dur="10.59">full of boxes that big and that was one</text>
  <text start="3082.97" dur="6.58">record in the inventory and when I asked</text>
  <text start="3087.03" dur="5.25">myself what&amp;#39;s in this box is typically</text>
  <text start="3089.55" dur="8.01">there it&amp;#39;s just an envelope I know as a</text>
  <text start="3092.28" dur="8.19">CD unit that&amp;#39;s a piece of evidence well</text>
  <text start="3097.56" dur="4.83">why do have the you know obviously has</text>
  <text start="3100.47" dur="4.8">more than one CD in it because it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="3102.39" dur="5.52">this box and so I asked myself what&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="3105.27" dur="5.34">here that the else protect is over that</text>
  <text start="3107.91" dur="7.43">and she goes well that&amp;#39;s those are those</text>
  <text start="3110.61" dur="9.53">are you know 100 CDs of evidence that</text>
  <text start="3115.34" dur="8.47">you know it has to do with 9/11 I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="3120.14" dur="6.58">why is it why is it in a box why aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3123.81" dur="5.64">those individuals faint she really did</text>
  <text start="3126.72" dur="5.4">she really didn&amp;#39;t have any any real</text>
  <text start="3129.45" dur="7.26">answer than that other then that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="3132.12" dur="6.03">wait is were you able to fix it no no I</text>
  <text start="3136.71" dur="3.18">didn&amp;#39;t want to open it because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3138.15" dur="4.58">sealed so I didn&amp;#39;t want to go through</text>
  <text start="3139.89" dur="5.4">the process and stealing evidence</text>
  <text start="3142.73" dur="6.08">you have to be in front of a judge you</text>
  <text start="3145.29" dur="7.24">get you know all sorts of issues there</text>
  <text start="3148.81" dur="5.61">so I didn&amp;#39;t do it but as part of that</text>
  <text start="3152.53" dur="6.03">initial inventory</text>
  <text start="3154.42" dur="8.01">I had to write what&amp;#39;s called EC it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3158.56" dur="7.89">memo electronic communication EC so I</text>
  <text start="3162.43" dur="8.25">wrote an EC with my findings for the</text>
  <text start="3166.45" dur="7.35">inventory and the findings were there</text>
  <text start="3170.68" dur="5.73">was bulk filed evidence and then there</text>
  <text start="3173.8" dur="5.46">were and I again I don&amp;#39;t know this is</text>
  <text start="3176.41" dur="5.43">all in the EC which the FBI was unable</text>
  <text start="3179.26" dur="5.07">to find that when they they did the</text>
  <text start="3181.84" dur="6.15">investigation they couldn&amp;#39;t find you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3184.33" dur="9.78">supposed to be cataloged isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="3187.99" dur="8.4">ironic and I know yes because one of my</text>
  <text start="3194.11" dur="4.02">staff what it is so in other words they</text>
  <text start="3196.39" dur="3.27">say all the time that they do not</text>
  <text start="3198.13" dur="3.33">catalogue anything unless it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3199.66" dur="3.78">physical piece of paper you had them</text>
  <text start="3201.46" dur="4.02">follow that procedure to make sure it</text>
  <text start="3203.44" dur="3.93">was catalogs and then the people doing</text>
  <text start="3205.48" dur="5.9">the investigation into why these things</text>
  <text start="3207.37" dur="4.01">were happening said we can&amp;#39;t find him</text>
  <text start="3214.35" dur="7.84">and I wrote a memo after the news what</text>
  <text start="3218.74" dur="4.83">happened after so well me so let me give</text>
  <text start="3222.19" dur="3.99">you that what the exceptions were one</text>
  <text start="3223.57" dur="5.46">was the bulk filing yep the other one</text>
  <text start="3226.18" dur="6.15">was they were I&amp;#39;m saying two or three</text>
  <text start="3229.03" dur="5.25">pieces of evidence that were checked out</text>
  <text start="3232.33" dur="7.38">okay</text>
  <text start="3234.28" dur="8.01">I asked two because they&amp;#39;ve been checked</text>
  <text start="3239.71" dur="5.4">out for quite some time I said I would</text>
  <text start="3242.29" dur="7.56">like to know that those pieces of</text>
  <text start="3245.11" dur="9.35">evidence are actually still in they you</text>
  <text start="3249.85" dur="6.6">know the special agents possession right</text>
  <text start="3254.46" dur="4.51">apparently no one had ever asked that</text>
  <text start="3256.45" dur="4.5">before so they take these two pieces of</text>
  <text start="3258.97" dur="4.04">evidence from a case goodness knows why</text>
  <text start="3260.95" dur="5.31">it could be for any reason whatsoever</text>
  <text start="3263.01" dur="4.83">right a long long time ago and nobody</text>
  <text start="3266.26" dur="4.05">knows if that person still has them</text>
  <text start="3267.84" dur="7.03">right because the the people who had</text>
  <text start="3270.31" dur="6.45">checked it out had retired so we go back</text>
  <text start="3274.87" dur="5.01">to the section where those people had</text>
  <text start="3276.76" dur="5.45">worked and we basically said this does</text>
  <text start="3279.88" dur="6.17">anyone this was checked out by</text>
  <text start="3282.21" dur="7.14">Jane Doe Special Agent working in your</text>
  <text start="3286.05" dur="7.13">section does anyone have that piece of</text>
  <text start="3289.35" dur="6.3">evidence and the response back was</text>
  <text start="3293.18" dur="8.86">nobody has that piece of evidence in</text>
  <text start="3295.65" dur="9.87">this section so that&amp;#39;s gone and there</text>
  <text start="3302.04" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s no real there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3305.52" dur="3.87">indication of oh well we probably ought</text>
  <text start="3307.5" dur="3.63">to call so and so we know he is retired</text>
  <text start="3309.39" dur="4.46">but we need to call him and kind of find</text>
  <text start="3311.13" dur="5.85">out it they just said we don&amp;#39;t have it</text>
  <text start="3313.85" dur="5.98">I&amp;#39;m like okay what do we do now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3316.98" dur="4.74">the process they said you just wait for</text>
  <text start="3319.83" dur="3.27">them to bring it back yeah you just have</text>
  <text start="3321.72" dur="6.35">them sign a piece of paper that they</text>
  <text start="3323.1" dur="8.58">don&amp;#39;t have it okay that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="3328.07" dur="5.17">so yeah you&amp;#39;re like what is this</text>
  <text start="3331.68" dur="3.33">attorney for this person who was</text>
  <text start="3333.24" dur="3.3">convicted or not using this evidence</text>
  <text start="3335.01" dur="3.06">let&amp;#39;s pretend they what if they come</text>
  <text start="3336.54" dur="6.03">back and say you know what we&amp;#39;d really</text>
  <text start="3338.07" dur="7.08">like to see the brush with the hair the</text>
  <text start="3342.57" dur="4.38">DNA sample that or whatever the CD with</text>
  <text start="3345.15" dur="3.57">this conversation on what happens to</text>
  <text start="3346.95" dur="5.79">their conviction if it comes back that</text>
  <text start="3348.72" dur="6.99">this evidence is missing bingo that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3352.74" dur="7.02">the best of all the oh all this records</text>

  <text start="3370.83" dur="4.05">get to the evidence that&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="3372.24" dur="4.41">right and if you&amp;#39;re the person that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3374.88" dur="4.05">being charged with a crime and you may</text>

  <text start="3526.3" dur="6.39">find this person who gave you this this</text>
  <text start="3530.32" dur="4.56">recording so in other words somebody</text>

  <text start="3539.07" dur="4.84">recorded something while they were there</text>
  <text start="3541.21" dur="4.86">right then the FBI would have to find</text>
  <text start="3543.91" dur="3.29">the person who made the recording and</text>
  <text start="3546.07" dur="7.46">give it back to them</text>
  <text start="3547.2" dur="6.96">right can you imagine can they keep it</text>
  <text start="3553.53" dur="2.7">forever</text>
  <text start="3554.16" dur="4.98">well you know some of this stuff is</text>
  <text start="3556.23" dur="4.53">probably destroying itself you know if</text>
  <text start="3559.14" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s a cassette tape</text>
  <text start="3560.76" dur="5.22">real tape you said basically the</text>
  <text start="3563.73" dur="3.96">environmental conditions for storing</text>
  <text start="3565.98" dur="5.069">this sort of a thing we&amp;#39;re completely so</text>
  <text start="3567.69" dur="5.76">they could have MLK tapes in in the</text>
  <text start="3571.049" dur="4.141">field offices and not catalogued and</text>
  <text start="3573.45" dur="3.659">nobody will ever be the wiser because</text>
  <text start="3575.19" dur="5.22">they because of what you&amp;#39;re identifying</text>
  <text start="3577.109" dur="8.361">basically they&amp;#39;re technically required</text>
  <text start="3580.41" dur="8.63">to do a physical inventory annually yeah</text>
  <text start="3585.47" dur="6.07">well they do it on the bark they well</text>
  <text start="3589.04" dur="5.71">sometimes they do it on the barn coated</text>
  <text start="3591.54" dur="4.62">stuff I mean that was part of the things</text>
  <text start="3594.75" dur="4.2">we were going to be looking at is are</text>
  <text start="3596.16" dur="4.35">you doing annual inventory so ah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3598.95" dur="4.2">where this kind of unraveled what I</text>
  <text start="3600.51" dur="4.5">started asking questions about how do we</text>
  <text start="3603.15" dur="6.48">know whether they&amp;#39;ve done annual</text>
  <text start="3605.01" dur="7.109">inventories and they say well we we do</text>
  <text start="3609.63" dur="4.11">it on the barcode it&amp;#39;s tough but guess</text>
  <text start="3612.119" dur="4.341">what out of the field offices we have</text>
  <text start="3613.74" dur="6.39">millions of pieces that have never been</text>
  <text start="3616.46" dur="6.099">actually put into the system and to</text>
  <text start="3620.13" dur="6.3">where we could match it up it won&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="3622.559" dur="5.671">years it would take years to do an</text>
  <text start="3626.43" dur="5.85">annual audit what&amp;#39;s stopping these</text>
  <text start="3628.23" dur="5.609">people from taking current day evidence</text>
  <text start="3632.28" dur="3.87">and putting it in with the other stuff</text>
  <text start="3633.839" dur="3.78">and nobody will know the why nobody will</text>
  <text start="3636.15" dur="3.51">be the wiser because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3637.619" dur="5.551">cataloging or looking or inventory and</text>
  <text start="3639.66" dur="5.55">the other stuff nothing I guess that</text>
  <text start="3643.17" dur="5.429">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s usually one person who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3645.21" dur="6.839">in charge of the evidence room there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3648.599" dur="8.131">no double-checking there&amp;#39;s no dual</text>
  <text start="3652.049" dur="7.411">control so what you need to do is get to</text>
  <text start="3656.73" dur="4.139">that person in one way shape or form and</text>
  <text start="3659.46" dur="3.119">they&amp;#39;ll do basically whatever you want</text>
  <text start="3660.869" dur="3.061">and there&amp;#39;s no one supervising them to</text>
  <text start="3662.579" dur="3.391">tell them whether or not they should be</text>
  <text start="3663.93" dur="3.33">doing it or double-checking their work</text>
  <text start="3665.97" dur="3.3">or making sure they&amp;#39;re doing their job</text>
  <text start="3667.26" dur="3.51">correctly and you said records</text>
  <text start="3669.27" dur="3">management is a very boring thing and</text>
  <text start="3670.77" dur="3.77">nobody cares about it so I guess it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3672.27" dur="6.809">not a high priority</text>
  <text start="3674.54" dur="6.009">it&amp;#39;s petrifying yeah terrifying okay so</text>

  <text start="4023.7" dur="3.359">happened because to me that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="4025.41" dur="2.909">is about and that&amp;#39;s kind of the linchpin</text>
  <text start="4027.059" dur="3.901">of it yeah</text>
  <text start="4028.319" dur="4.441">given the timing is very fuzzy I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4030.96" dur="4.859">remember exactly what it was I believe</text>
  <text start="4032.76" dur="5.88">it was I believe was you know after that</text>
  <text start="4035.819" dur="5.911">that review in that time period</text>
  <text start="4038.64" dur="6.209">and we were it was a very innocuous I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4041.73" dur="5.55">in there and the other supervisor the</text>
  <text start="4044.849" dur="5.161">ELSA program supervisor was in that</text>
  <text start="4047.28" dur="8.069">meeting as well and we were talking</text>
  <text start="4050.01" dur="7.14">about we were talking about you know</text>
  <text start="4055.349" dur="5.431">reporting of issues how people can</text>
  <text start="4057.15" dur="6.659">report issues and there was a policy on</text>
  <text start="4060.78" dur="6.15">that if they had in this book and I you</text>
  <text start="4063.809" dur="5.021">know and I casually said of course he</text>
  <text start="4066.93" dur="4.78">said I grabbed the</text>
  <text start="4068.83" dur="7.14">vulgar from his hand and I was upset and</text>
  <text start="4071.71" dur="6.57">I was boisterous and I said you know</text>
  <text start="4075.97" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re it&amp;#39;s a casual conversation there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4078.28" dur="5.15">three of us talking and I said well is</text>
  <text start="4079.9" dur="7.68">there anything in that policy about an</text>
  <text start="4083.43" dur="8.4">anonymous reporting system I said</text>
  <text start="4087.58" dur="7.77">because yeah the basis of a good quote</text>
  <text start="4091.83" dur="6.16">whistleblower truth-telling</text>
  <text start="4095.35" dur="5.58">system is to have a way for people to</text>
  <text start="4097.99" dur="7.05">report things anonymously and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4100.93" dur="8.97">an FCC registered company you have to</text>
  <text start="4105.04" dur="6.509">under under the law right yeah so I said</text>
  <text start="4109.9" dur="6.3">you know is there anything in that</text>
  <text start="4111.549" dur="6.661">booklet about you know about that about</text>
  <text start="4116.2" dur="5.13">anonymous reporting and how you would do</text>
  <text start="4118.21" dur="7.25">there and he kind of thrusts it at me</text>
  <text start="4121.33" dur="7.65">like that and he says well I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="4125.46" dur="7.149">yes I okay well that was kind of the end</text>
  <text start="4128.98" dur="8.549">of well no he knows that you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="4132.609" dur="7.801">try and out all this I&amp;#39;m assuming well</text>
  <text start="4137.529" dur="5.281">you know this is also kind of at the</text>
  <text start="4140.41" dur="8.429">same time when they had asked me to</text>
  <text start="4142.81" dur="8.37">write a another QAR for overall records</text>
  <text start="4148.839" dur="9.121">management we already have one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4151.18" dur="9.09">focused on the field offices okay but</text>
  <text start="4157.96" dur="5.19">there are a whole lot more records that</text>
  <text start="4160.27" dur="5.339">aren&amp;#39;t at the field office okay</text>
  <text start="4163.15" dur="5.31">in fact there&amp;#39;s been and there&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4165.609" dur="5.011">called the arc the AR see down in</text>
  <text start="4168.46" dur="3.18">Alexandria that he has millions of</text>
  <text start="4170.62" dur="4.26">pieces of evidence</text>
  <text start="4171.64" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s rat-infested and mold-infested in</text>
  <text start="4174.88" dur="7.02">itself absolutely worst place to ever</text>
  <text start="4177.94" dur="7.32">want to work which also violates the</text>
  <text start="4181.9" dur="5.879">federal records laws that the archivist</text>
  <text start="4185.26" dur="4.98">is that but in a team it so they asked</text>
  <text start="4187.779" dur="6.841">me to write that overall records</text>
  <text start="4190.24" dur="8.03">management QA are all these review yes -</text>
  <text start="4194.62" dur="6.399">no I said well you know each day each</text>
  <text start="4198.27" dur="5.539">FBI DOJ</text>
  <text start="4201.019" dur="5.79">you know Agriculture Department they all</text>
  <text start="4203.809" dur="5.491">have somebody in there that has been</text>
  <text start="4206.809" dur="5.73">designated as the federal records</text>
  <text start="4209.3" dur="6.089">officer and that federal records officer</text>
  <text start="4212.539" dur="6.12">has a dotted line to the archivist of</text>
  <text start="4215.389" dur="6.75">the US ok archivists of the US is the</text>
  <text start="4218.659" dur="6.27">woman who sets the regulations on what a</text>
  <text start="4222.139" dur="5.67">record is how long you have to keep it</text>
  <text start="4224.929" dur="4.411">how you can dispose of when you need to</text>
  <text start="4227.809" dur="5.011">send it to them when you don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="4229.34" dur="5.069">send it to them everything ok so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4232.82" dur="5.04">the person that decides not the</text>
  <text start="4234.409" dur="6.48">department FBI thinks they should but</text>
  <text start="4237.86" dur="5.549">they do but so they asked me to write</text>
  <text start="4240.889" dur="4.951">this and I said well the best way to</text>
  <text start="4243.409" dur="4.77">look at records management is to see if</text>
  <text start="4245.84" dur="5.929">that federal records officer is</text>
  <text start="4248.179" dur="6.601">following the law and so I go to the CFR</text>
  <text start="4251.769" dur="5.741">that describes the duties of the federal</text>
  <text start="4254.78" dur="5.91">records officer you need to make sure</text>
  <text start="4257.51" dur="5.31">that microfiche is stored properly you</text>
  <text start="4260.69" dur="2.849">need to make sure that maps are stored</text>
  <text start="4262.82" dur="4.319">properly</text>
  <text start="4263.539" dur="6.39">so there&amp;#39;s you know ten requirements</text>
  <text start="4267.139" dur="4.56">that this is what you as a federal</text>
  <text start="4269.929" dur="4.32">records officer required to make sure</text>
  <text start="4271.699" dur="5.761">are occurring in your department to</text>
  <text start="4274.249" dur="5.341">comply with the law okay sounds like a</text>
  <text start="4277.46" dur="5.039">pretty good compliance program to me</text>
  <text start="4279.59" dur="5.609">yeah that&amp;#39;s pretty simple too right yeah</text>
  <text start="4282.499" dur="5.16">it wasn&amp;#39;t hard it was you know and so we</text>
  <text start="4285.199" dur="5.971">put that together but you know I put it</text>
  <text start="4287.659" dur="7.141">together I let my staff review it and we</text>
  <text start="4291.17" dur="6.179">give that to the unit chief don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="4294.8" dur="4.29">anything back from me for a while and</text>
  <text start="4297.349" dur="6.031">then eventually he comes back and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4299.09" dur="9.569">pushing back on these questions and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4303.38" dur="7.949">like what&amp;#39;s the concern and well I just</text>
  <text start="4308.659" dur="5.34">you know we just don&amp;#39;t know in quite</text>
  <text start="4311.329" dur="5.971">frankly I knew of those ten probably a</text>
  <text start="4313.999" dur="4.711">doe and they would fail because I I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4317.3" dur="2.879">been around enough and I&amp;#39;ve talked to</text>
  <text start="4318.71" dur="3.599">enough people that I know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4320.179" dur="4.621">not doing their I mean the microfiche</text>
  <text start="4322.309" dur="5.451">you know two rows over from me as a</text>
  <text start="4324.8" dur="7.489">bucket is a container of microfiche</text>
  <text start="4327.76" dur="4.529">sitting out in the open under a skylight</text>
  <text start="4333.57" dur="5.77">okay as you guys as you know probably a</text>
  <text start="4337.659" dur="5.58">lot of people don&amp;#39;t know what microfilm</text>
  <text start="4339.34" dur="6.48">yeah when you you don&amp;#39;t leave it in the</text>
  <text start="4343.239" dur="4.17">sunlight now it bleaches it out to where</text>
  <text start="4345.82" dur="4.41">you can&amp;#39;t actually read it it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="4347.409" dur="4.591">like a negative it is it is and you put</text>
  <text start="4350.23" dur="5.009">it on a little machine and you breathe</text>
  <text start="4352" dur="6">it in but eventually if you&amp;#39;re exposed</text>
  <text start="4355.239" dur="6.141">to UV light it deteriorates</text>
  <text start="4358" dur="7.8">through you can&amp;#39;t read it so I know that</text>
  <text start="4361.38" dur="7.81">they aren&amp;#39;t following it right so anyway</text>
  <text start="4365.8" dur="7.169">so he starts pushing back I&amp;#39;m like why</text>
  <text start="4369.19" dur="8.239">are you so concerned about this well we</text>
  <text start="4372.969" dur="8.101">showed it to the federal records officer</text>
  <text start="4377.429" dur="6.661">who happened to be the a be over records</text>
  <text start="4381.07" dur="7.169">management which is in essence my boss</text>
  <text start="4384.09" dur="9.549">you know three or four levels up they</text>
  <text start="4388.239" dur="9.69">don&amp;#39;t really they don&amp;#39;t really want and</text>
  <text start="4393.639" dur="6.391">I&amp;#39;m like well here&amp;#39;s the deal what</text>
  <text start="4397.929" dur="6.781">you&amp;#39;re talking about is one of the</text>
  <text start="4400.03" dur="8.25">biggest problems in auditing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4404.71" dur="5.759">called scope limitation if you have the</text>
  <text start="4408.28" dur="4.109">target of an audit or compliance review</text>
  <text start="4410.469" dur="3.69">come to you and say I don&amp;#39;t want you to</text>
  <text start="4412.389" dur="5.511">look at this over here do not look at</text>
  <text start="4414.159" dur="6.841">this don&amp;#39;t look at this</text>
  <text start="4417.9" dur="5.29">that&amp;#39;s called scope limitation and if</text>
  <text start="4421" dur="4.23">you were in private industry as an</text>
  <text start="4423.19" dur="4.38">auditor you&amp;#39;d probably have to resign</text>
  <text start="4425.23" dur="4.619">the engagement because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4427.57" dur="4.529">attempting to hide things from you yeah</text>
  <text start="4429.849" dur="3.841">and your job is to make sure that yeah I</text>
  <text start="4432.099" dur="5.511">mean it&amp;#39;s the antithesis of what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4433.69" dur="7.739">tasked with right yeah so you know</text>
  <text start="4437.61" dur="7.54">needless to say and that was that was</text>
  <text start="4441.429" dur="7.201">very close to the end of my career with</text>
  <text start="4445.15" dur="6.089">the FBI so needless to say that that was</text>
  <text start="4448.63" dur="5.73">never implemented while I was there it</text>

  <text start="5367.64" dur="6.84">said I&amp;#39;ve had multiple discussions with</text>

  <text start="5374.48" dur="5.1">you don&amp;#39;t have any reason whatsoever to</text>
  <text start="5377.54" dur="4.139">be questioning me on what I wrote in a</text>
  <text start="5379.58" dur="6.289">form 12 because there have been many</text>
  <text start="5381.679" dur="7.46">other discussions clarifications right</text>
  <text start="5385.869" dur="5.46">you just need to drop it yeah he was</text>
  <text start="5389.139" dur="4.53">like they basically try to strong-arm</text>
  <text start="5391.329" dur="6.66">you and the process becomes the the</text>
  <text start="5393.669" dur="6.72">punishment basically yes yeah again they</text>
  <text start="5397.989" dur="6.121">do no wrong</text>
  <text start="5400.389" dur="8.13">FBI does no wrong and when you read</text>
  <text start="5404.11" dur="8.19">through again their investigation you</text>
  <text start="5408.519" dur="7.97">can see that he&amp;#39;s got us but they merely</text>
  <text start="5412.3" dur="6.899">mouth it yeah you know but but you know</text>
  <text start="5416.489" dur="5.05">yeah but yeah but you have it yeah right</text>
  <text start="5419.199" dur="5.52">oh yes</text>
  <text start="5421.539" dur="5.071">it won&amp;#39;t do that thing and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="5424.719" dur="3.93">who I don&amp;#39;t know what it is I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5426.61" dur="3.779">talk to enough people like you know</text>
  <text start="5428.649" dur="4.53">obviously that wasn&amp;#39;t very good auditor</text>
  <text start="5430.389" dur="5.04">or wasn&amp;#39;t this yeah the whole character</text>
  <text start="5433.179" dur="4.38">assassination the problem with this and</text>
  <text start="5435.429" dur="3.72">why I found it so poignant today is</text>
  <text start="5437.559" dur="4.17">because of what we&amp;#39;re dealing with in</text>
  <text start="5439.149" dur="4.59">terms of all of the illegal wiretap and</text>
  <text start="5441.729" dur="4.56">you know or allegedly illegal wild</text>
  <text start="5443.739" dur="4.561">wiretap and all of the electronic</text>
  <text start="5446.289" dur="4.321">surveillance that&amp;#39;s been done and you</text>
  <text start="5448.3" dur="4.139">know allegations that this stuff was</text>
  <text start="5450.61" dur="2.489">done behind people&amp;#39;s backs with no</text>
  <text start="5452.439" dur="2.31">warrants</text>
  <text start="5453.099" dur="5.07">you know people tape recording people</text>
  <text start="5454.749" dur="6.031">and I&amp;#39;m like this basically bolsters the</text>
  <text start="5458.169" dur="7.71">fact that this has been a culture at the</text>
  <text start="5460.78" dur="7.859">FBI for you can wiretap in the FBI can</text>
  <text start="5465.879" dur="5.03">wiretap anybody without a warrant all</text>
  <text start="5468.639" dur="4.92">they got to do is walk into a skiff and</text>
  <text start="5470.909" dur="6.371">put a phone number in a computer and</text>
  <text start="5473.559" dur="5.491">they&amp;#39;re wiretapping so what they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="5477.28" dur="4.139">supposed to be able to do is use that</text>
  <text start="5479.05" dur="5.669">information in a case as part of the</text>
  <text start="5481.419" dur="4.98">case but you not both know if you get a</text>
  <text start="5484.719" dur="3.541">little hint that somebody&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="5486.399" dur="3.75">and kind of doing this you can do</text>
  <text start="5488.26" dur="4.619">something else over here and get it</text>
  <text start="5490.149" dur="5.07">consensual you get a consensual or get</text>
  <text start="5492.879" dur="3.211">you know it can it can point you in the</text>
  <text start="5495.219" dur="3.51">right direction</text>
  <text start="5496.09" dur="5.609">yep right and you can do a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="5498.729" dur="5.131">to get there and you got it off of it</text>
  <text start="5501.699" dur="4.621">well illegal wiretap but as long as you</text>
  <text start="5503.86" dur="5.069">don&amp;#39;t mention that wiretap and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5506.32" dur="3.48">tie it to that water cap they can do</text>
  <text start="5508.929" dur="2.641">anything they want</text>
  <text start="5509.8" dur="3.509">does that why your tap go into the</text>
  <text start="5511.57" dur="5.069">system or do they just completely throw</text>
  <text start="5513.309" dur="4.951">that one away if you know that then</text>
  <text start="5516.639" dur="2.791">that&amp;#39;s something I think that has</text>
  <text start="5518.26" dur="6.27">changed since I was</text>
  <text start="5519.43" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re they they have that supervisor</text>
  <text start="5524.53" dur="4.56">that I do deep with she eventually</text>
  <text start="5526.72" dur="6.54">transferred that that program</text>
  <text start="5529.09" dur="5.76">transferred into out to Quantico and I</text>
  <text start="5533.26" dur="3.81">think it was under the umbrella of the</text>
  <text start="5534.85" dur="6.12">land of the FBI laboratory</text>
  <text start="5537.07" dur="6.21">and they&amp;#39;ve redone that to where those</text>
  <text start="5540.97" dur="6.39">recordings I think are now going into a</text>
  <text start="5543.28" dur="6.06">central location so they probably and</text>
  <text start="5547.36" dur="3.75">she was really really good she she</text>
  <text start="5549.34" dur="5.07">understood that the Pops of these</text>
  <text start="5551.11" dur="5.43">problems and she&amp;#39;s no longer there I</text>
  <text start="5554.41" dur="6.42">think she&amp;#39;s working at another another</text>
  <text start="5556.54" dur="8.07">agency right now but I would imagine if</text>
  <text start="5560.83" dur="5.04">she was able to do what she knew needed</text>
  <text start="5564.61" dur="4.41">to be done that they&amp;#39;ve put some</text>
  <text start="5565.87" dur="5.13">additional controls on that but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5569.02" dur="3.36">know they&amp;#39;re you know that&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="5571" dur="4.74">those things that you have you&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="5572.38" dur="5.28">to understand what system you know when</text>
  <text start="5575.74" dur="4.29">did they stop using that system that had</text>
  <text start="5577.66" dur="5.55">all the problems or did they stop it and</text>
  <text start="5580.03" dur="4.65">just try to band-aid it right and you</text>
  <text start="5583.21" dur="4.35">know are they still using that but on</text>
  <text start="5584.68" dur="6.62">the recording side is it going into you</text>
  <text start="5587.56" dur="6.27">know you know one central location now</text>
  <text start="5591.3" dur="4.66">you know she has staff that would that</text>
  <text start="5593.83" dur="4.71">would review the applications just to</text>
  <text start="5595.96" dur="4.74">make sure that eyes are dotted and t&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5598.54" dur="3.93">were crossed right so I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="5600.7" dur="4.41">much that&amp;#39;s been on Maidan since then</text>
  <text start="5602.47" dur="5.04">because it was it was somewhat manual at</text>
  <text start="5605.11" dur="5.28">that point so a lot of questions that</text>
  <text start="5607.51" dur="5.51">need to be asked about you know what</text>
  <text start="5610.39" dur="5.94">you&amp;#39;re talking about though is you know</text>
  <text start="5613.02" dur="4.81">but the difficulty is nobody really</text>
  <text start="5616.33" dur="2.52">knows what was said in front of the</text>
  <text start="5617.83" dur="2.97">Flies insurance</text>
  <text start="5618.85" dur="4.02">yeah well issues that you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="5620.8" dur="3.78">about you&amp;#39;ve had the application they</text>
  <text start="5622.87" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t know what was said in the court I</text>
  <text start="5624.58" dur="4.49">understood I I get that I but we also</text>
  <text start="5627.64" dur="3.36">understand and from our experience</text>
  <text start="5629.07" dur="4.24">understand that there are some FBI</text>
  <text start="5631" dur="6.36">agents that will do anything to get a</text>
  <text start="5633.31" dur="5.94">case law and here&amp;#39;s the issue when</text>
  <text start="5637.36" dur="6.71">you&amp;#39;re an FBI agent in a field office</text>
  <text start="5639.25" dur="8.46">you get resources dependent on how</text>
  <text start="5644.07" dur="6.94">successful you are in people going to</text>
  <text start="5647.71" dur="6.779">trial and getting convictions</text>
  <text start="5651.01" dur="6.51">so you have an incentive to get people</text>
  <text start="5654.489" dur="4.891">convicted especially if you&amp;#39;re the if</text>
  <text start="5657.52" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;re special agent in charge of a</text>
  <text start="5659.38" dur="3.72">field office and you&amp;#39;d like to have more</text>
  <text start="5661.15" dur="4.11">agents you&amp;#39;d like to have more money</text>
  <text start="5663.1" dur="5.58">you&amp;#39;d like to buy more equipment guess</text>
  <text start="5665.26" dur="5.61">how you get that by putting people in</text>
  <text start="5668.68" dur="5.61">jail that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s a 95 percent</text>
  <text start="5670.87" dur="5.369">conviction rate because there one way or</text>
  <text start="5674.29" dur="6.54">another they&amp;#39;re gonna convict you yeah</text>
  <text start="5676.239" dur="8.661">and so the whole culture you know people</text>
  <text start="5680.83" dur="7.26">ask us all the time what&amp;#39;s the fix right</text>
  <text start="5684.9" dur="7.41">my personal opinion is there the culture</text>
  <text start="5688.09" dur="7.11">has to completely change the FBI</text>
  <text start="5692.31" dur="6.34">hierarchy in structure was designed by a</text>
  <text start="5695.2" dur="6.87">person who was born in 1873 or something</text>
  <text start="5698.65" dur="6.27">whenever who was born right born two</text>
  <text start="5702.07" dur="6.45">centuries ago and we&amp;#39;re still using that</text>
  <text start="5704.92" dur="4.98">structure that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s wrong I</text>
  <text start="5708.52" dur="5.55">think there needs to be some changes</text>
  <text start="5709.9" dur="5.4">yeah the whole idea that they are and</text>
  <text start="5714.07" dur="3.12">you hear it all the time when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5715.3" dur="4.4">talking or the preeminent law</text>
  <text start="5717.19" dur="5.25">enforcement agency in the world right</text>
  <text start="5719.7" dur="5.5">norman&amp;#39;s would never do anything yep I</text>
  <text start="5722.44" dur="5.01">say to you an article last night about</text>
  <text start="5725.2" dur="4.8">an agent that tampering with evidence so</text>
  <text start="5727.45" dur="4.41">we know that&amp;#39;s not right yeah not to say</text>
  <text start="5730" dur="4.73">they&amp;#39;re all bad I you know they really</text>
  <text start="5731.86" dur="6.9">get there but they&amp;#39;re very they are very</text>
  <text start="5734.73" dur="6.19">that there&amp;#39;s an FBI that we see and</text>
  <text start="5738.76" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s an FBI as as an operation so</text>
  <text start="5740.92" dur="5.67">that FBI&amp;#39;s and operates is controlled by</text>
  <text start="5742.9" dur="5.46">the agents they would have people in the</text>
  <text start="5746.59" dur="4.8">most important position so they can</text>
  <text start="5748.36" dur="6.48">drive that organization and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5751.39" dur="5.849">you&amp;#39;re either an agent or you&amp;#39;re not and</text>
  <text start="5754.84" dur="4.26">they only want to be around agents</text>
  <text start="5757.239" dur="3.571">everybody else is just there to help</text>
  <text start="5759.1" dur="4.8">them do whatever it is they want to do</text>
  <text start="5760.81" dur="9.69">and you know people get put it told you</text>

  <text start="5860.46" dur="3.929">to take from this and I might even cut</text>
  <text start="5862.8" dur="4.53">it into some highlights to throw out</text>
