  <text start="135.92" dur="4.59">a court that this investigation began on</text>
  <text start="138.02" dur="4.74">July 31st and if the fact that you</text>
  <text start="140.51" dur="4.68">cannot tell me definitively that before</text>
  <text start="142.76" dur="4.41">July 31st there was not intelligence</text>
  <text start="145.19" dur="3.269">collected on the Trump campaign but that</text>

  <text start="347.22" dur="4.86">director ray can explain it too sir</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="5.15">my responsibility at that time was to</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="5.339">approve the filing of FISA applications</text>
  <text start="355.1" dur="3.88">because only three people the department</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="3.241">authorized to be the final sign-off the</text>
  <text start="358.98" dur="2.76">Attorney General the deputy and the</text>

  <text start="365.97" dur="6.72">I have fortunately been relieved of that</text>
  <text start="368.01" dur="6.6">responsibility director Ray still does</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="4.44">it every day and I don&amp;#39;t know exactly</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.44">what his process is sir but we sit down</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="3.36">with a team of attorneys from the</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="3.08">Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="3.29">all of whom review that</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="4.59">provide a briefing for us about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="5.19">in it and sir I&amp;#39;ve reviewed that one in</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="3.63">some detail and I can tell you sir that</text>
  <text start="388.97" dur="3.42">the information that&amp;#39;s public about that</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="5.7">doesn&amp;#39;t match with my understanding of</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="5.19">the one that I signed okay but I think</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="2.37">it&amp;#39;s appropriate to let the Inspector</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="4.2">General complete that investigation</text>
  <text start="398.42" dur="5.25">these are serious allegations and I</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t do the investigation I&amp;#39;m not the</text>
  <text start="403.67" dur="3.99">affiant I&amp;#39;m reviewing the finished</text>
  <text start="405.98" dur="5.12">product sir are they investigate your</text>
  <text start="407.66" dur="3.44">general finds that I did something wrong</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="3.85">then I&amp;#39;ll respect that judgment but I</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="6.12">think it&amp;#39;s highly highly unlikely sir</text>
  <text start="416.39" dur="6.72">given the way the process works okay so</text>
  <text start="420.77" dur="3.9">a lot of people are taking that as he</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="3.72">didn&amp;#39;t read it and he said something</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="5.04">very specific and he was merging that</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="4.67">review that is his sir time the position</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="4.05">was they filing a FISA application</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="3.88">because only three people the department</text>

  <text start="473.45" dur="5.88">renewal of the FISA warrant from June</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m sorry July of 2017 after Trump had</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="6.78">been office already in six for six</text>
  <text start="480.95" dur="8.31">months or so and sir I&amp;#39;ve reviewed that</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="4.53">one in some detail and I can tell you</text>
  <text start="489.26" dur="2.97">sir that the information that&amp;#39;s public</text>

  <text start="492.23" dur="3.96">understanding of the one that I signed</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="3.72">now one of the things that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="5.16">theorizing for a really long time now</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="6.06">and is indicated in the letter is that</text>
  <text start="501.35" dur="5.1">Robert Muller is taking over the</text>
  <text start="504.08" dur="5.04">counterintelligence operation formerly</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="5.16">known as crossfire hurricane and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="4.65">what his special counsels becoming given</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="3.719">what we have heard from Horowitz so far</text>
  <text start="513.77" dur="4.079">given this</text>
  <text start="515.329" dur="4.62">murk and a nod that Rosenstein has right</text>
  <text start="517.849" dur="4.77">now I&amp;#39;m gonna be probably one of the</text>
  <text start="519.949" dur="5.1">only people to say that I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="522.619" dur="4.2">that Pfizer renewal from July had</text>
  <text start="525.049" dur="3.811">anything to do with Carter page and</text>
  <text start="526.819" dur="3.57">probably or if it did have anything to</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="3.99">do with Carter page it&amp;#39;s not in the way</text>
  <text start="530.389" dur="6.12">that we are assuming that it that it did</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="5.729">and I know that judge Ellis came out</text>
  <text start="536.509" dur="5.76">with an answer the other day and he</text>
  <text start="538.579" dur="5.781">basically said judge Ellis is over over</text>
