  <text start="0.03" dur="5.94">good afternoon everyone it is Thursday</text>
  <text start="2.49" dur="5.88">August 30th 2018 at 2:17 p.m. Eastern</text>
  <text start="5.97" dur="5.129">Time today I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about Bruce or</text>
  <text start="8.37" dur="4.5">on Sean Hannity the other night we had</text>
  <text start="11.099" dur="4.83">an interview with the congressman where</text>
  <text start="12.87" dur="5.249">he invoked the name John Huber who is</text>
  <text start="15.929" dur="3.871">the special prosecutor or the US</text>
  <text start="18.119" dur="4.111">Attorney I&amp;#39;m sorry who&amp;#39;s been working in</text>
  <text start="19.8" dur="5.67">conjunction with Michael Horowitz since</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="4.889">November of last year I and many others</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="5.149">have been talking about Michael Huber or</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="7.291">John Huber for a very very long time and</text>
  <text start="30.619" dur="6.431">and we&amp;#39;ve been saying that he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="4.05">with Horowitz to interview people that</text>
  <text start="37.05" dur="2.91">are not able to be interviewed because</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="3.39">Horowitz doesn&amp;#39;t have the power to bring</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="3.24">them in to identify whether or not</text>
  <text start="41.85" dur="3.029">another special counsel will be</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="3.929">necessary or things can be handled</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="3.241">within the Justice Department this was a</text>
  <text start="47.129" dur="3.36">big secret</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="5.22">Huber&amp;#39;s existence was a big secret for a</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="4.771">very long time until one day and Jeff</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="3.78">Sessions came out with it and basically</text>
  <text start="55.26" dur="3.779">just said you know we have a special</text>
  <text start="57.12" dur="3.81">prosecutor or a special US attorney</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="6.291">outside of Washington DC who&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="60.93" dur="6.78">on these matters with Michael Horowitz</text>
  <text start="65.33" dur="5.44">the reason why I know that there is a</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="6.54">grand jury impaneled with John Huber is</text>
  <text start="70.77" dur="5.58">because Goodlatte did an interview with</text>
  <text start="74.25" dur="2.61">Hannity several months ago where he said</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="3.39">so</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="5.91">hold on I&amp;#39;ll show you so this is a clip</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="8.669">of the sean hannity show from March 27th</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="7.44">2018 where he&amp;#39;s talking to good luck and</text>
  <text start="88.409" dur="3.931">you don&amp;#39;t have prosecutorial powers he</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="5.13">can refer for prosecution but he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="4.709">prosecute himself so we think that a</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="4.2">special counsel is needed and we also</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="4.621">think that he should get this a report</text>
  <text start="99.54" dur="5.759">out regarding regarding how the FBI</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="5.64">handled the Clinton email and related</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="4.081">matters out now and not wait until he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="4.32">also done this other work on the FISA</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="4.529">warrant we need the information out is</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="4.23">there any doubt in your mind Hillary</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="3.03">Clinton when she we already know what</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="3.48">he&amp;#39;s gonna say that I&amp;#39;m gonna skip</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="4.591">forward a little bit hold on secret</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="5.4">special access praana raishin here&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="216.09" dur="3.69">these types of things didn&amp;#39;t happen in</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="6.45">the Justice Department where I worked</text>

  <text start="231.3" dur="3.63">hard job especially people that don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="4.32">on witch hunts and they believe in equal</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="5.279">justice under the law is there anybody</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="5.43">that could do what happened here that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="5.941">watching this show tonight that could</text>
  <text start="242.85" dur="5.13">omit purposely key information in an</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="4.89">application to get a warrant to spy on</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="5.31">in this case an opposition party</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="4.979">campaign associate in the lead-up to an</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="5.37">election and not be arrested and put in</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="5.161">jail those people that put their name on</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="4.35">those FISA warrant applications aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="4.109">they swearing by the truthfulness the</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="3.75">veracity of those applications and if</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="3.151">they knowingly withhold them for</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="6.03">Meishan in those applications aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="6.93">they really pre isn&amp;#39;t this premeditated</text>
  <text start="272.79" dur="5.76">sorry I gotta stop this really quickly</text>
  <text start="275.37" dur="5.43">I can&amp;#39;t watch Hannity anymore he just</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="3.99">doesn&amp;#39;t stop talking I mean he has these</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="4.17">amazing guests sitting here next to him</text>
  <text start="282.54" dur="6.66">that have information and he just won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="6.27">stop talking fraud on a court everybody</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="7.14">that signed them did they commit fraud</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="7.05">on a court my opinion on this is Shawn</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="5.25">that there&amp;#39;s a guy named John Huber</text>
  <text start="298.29" dur="5.67">who&amp;#39;s been he&amp;#39;s the US Attorney for Utah</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="5.7">who&amp;#39;s been tasked by Jeff Sessions to</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="5.22">investigate well where&amp;#39;s he use well my</text>
  <text start="307.29" dur="4.8">recommendation to mr. Huber would be</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="5.25">would be for him to contact my office</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="4.41">and ask for a copy of the transcript of</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="2.58">Bruce or and I&amp;#39;ll make his job a lot</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="3.3">easier</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="3.57">can I can I have a copy of it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="5.46">what he said</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="8.16">that&amp;#39;s what he said now when I saw this</text>
  <text start="325.26" dur="7.14">I took it to mean here&amp;#39;s his testimony</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="6.15">in front of us maybe you can use this he</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="4.35">lied consistently whenever it was you</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="2.61">know you want he could have been caught</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="2.88">in perjury</text>
  <text start="337.5" dur="6.48">god only knows but that&amp;#39;s what he said</text>
  <text start="339.63" dur="6.9">that&amp;#39;s all he said fast forward a few</text>
  <text start="343.98" dur="6.54">minutes and we&amp;#39;ve got Joe to Geneva out</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="7.23">of seemingly nowhere picking up what he</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="7.77">said and turning it into John Huber</text>
  <text start="353.76" dur="6.92">never interviews Bruce or let&amp;#39;s go there</text>
  <text start="358.29" dur="4.71">and take a look and I gotta be honest</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="4.78">I&amp;#39;ve said this before I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="363" dur="5.85">breakdowns of these to Victoria and Joe</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="4.62">and I&amp;#39;ve wondered like what did what is</text>
  <text start="368.85" dur="2.75">their purpose what are they doing now</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="5.54">they&amp;#39;re bad guys but what are they doing</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="6.82">like why are they out here on television</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="4.6">she&amp;#39;s done some legal work for me he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.42" dur="3.57">it very expensive but he&amp;#39;s really worth</text>
