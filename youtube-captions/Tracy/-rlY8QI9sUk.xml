  <text start="48.89" dur="6.839">anybody ever however um hey I just got</text>
  <text start="53.269" dur="4.411">off the phone with a good friend who</text>
  <text start="55.729" dur="3.451">helped me calm down a little bit but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="57.68" dur="3.269">a little scared and I wanted to kind of</text>
  <text start="59.18" dur="4.53">like give my thoughts and some hurricane</text>
  <text start="60.949" dur="5.971">preparedness tips for those of you guys</text>
  <text start="63.71" dur="5.549">who might be in the path of this</text>
  <text start="66.92" dur="5.339">hurricane or a hurricane coming within</text>
  <text start="69.259" dur="7.981">the next month or so until the season is</text>
  <text start="72.259" dur="8.61">done so I am in I am on the coast on the</text>
  <text start="77.24" dur="7.32">east coast of South Carolina and so as</text>
  <text start="80.869" dur="8.011">the forecast changes every 12 hours</text>
  <text start="84.56" dur="5.93">I watch it intently and hope for the</text>
  <text start="88.88" dur="8.76">best</text>
  <text start="90.49" dur="9.76">so um this monster storm is headed</text>
  <text start="97.64" dur="5.88">towards the United States in the next</text>
  <text start="100.25" dur="7.469">day or two and there are things that you</text>
  <text start="103.52" dur="7.139">guys can do to get yourselves ready</text>
  <text start="107.719" dur="5.25">hopefully you want to start doing that</text>
  <text start="110.659" dur="3.901">at least a week before war a month</text>
  <text start="112.969" dur="4.951">before with some of the stuff that</text>
  <text start="114.56" dur="5.909">doesn&amp;#39;t go some of the stuff that</text>
  <text start="117.92" dur="4.4">doesn&amp;#39;t go bad but you need you know you</text>
  <text start="120.469" dur="7.44">need to have a generator you need</text>
  <text start="122.32" dur="8.97">preferably to get a hybrid generator</text>
  <text start="127.909" dur="5.851">propane and gas that way you can use</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="4.539">propane to fuel your generator and then</text>
  <text start="133.76" dur="3.72">when when and if you happen to possibly</text>
  <text start="135.829" dur="4.74">run out of propane you also have a guest</text>
  <text start="137.48" dur="7.65">reserve and storage yes doesn&amp;#39;t last</text>
  <text start="140.569" dur="7.071">forever so you know you can you can buy</text>
  <text start="145.13" dur="5.97">stabilizer and stuff to put in gas tanks</text>
  <text start="147.64" dur="6.429">but your gas will last about six months</text>
  <text start="151.1" dur="5.07">on the safe side if you don&amp;#39;t use it</text>
  <text start="154.069" dur="6.54">because put in your car so that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="6.51">but get a gas hybrid generator so that</text>
  <text start="160.609" dur="3.85">this way you could run it off propane</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="4.929">you want to have</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="6.211">at least two gallons of water per day</text>
  <text start="167.609" dur="4.231">per person in your house you want to</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="4.399">make sure that you get the right weight</text>
  <text start="171.84" dur="8.97">of oil for your generate generator</text>
  <text start="175.069" dur="9.971">you know propane I got my propane filled</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="6.929">at a place near here for $12 a tank and</text>
  <text start="185.04" dur="8.75">I you know I made sure that I had enough</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="6.051">to last me for close to 15 or 16 days</text>
  <text start="194.629" dur="11.351">quickly I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys can see</text>
  <text start="199.889" dur="10.41">and here this is just a storm this is</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="6.239">not a hurricane I&amp;#39;m just sitting in a</text>
  <text start="210.299" dur="5.791">thunderstorm which I love nature and</text>
  <text start="212.219" dur="5.61">weather and this but not when it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="216.09" dur="5.119">category if I&amp;#39;m gonna get wet not when</text>
  <text start="217.829" dur="5.99">it&amp;#39;s a category 5 that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="5.081">destroy people&amp;#39;s homes and livelihood</text>
  <text start="223.819" dur="11.31">this is crazy what&amp;#39;s coming through here</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="8.839">right now well it is nonsense ah hold on</text>
  <text start="236.93" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s like a monsoon out there hold on I</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="5.94">like to sit outside and do my live</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="3.56">streams and that&amp;#39;s not happening today</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="8.65">anyway so enough water to gallons per</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="6.451">person per hat per day bottled water or</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="6.72">you know jug water make sure you fill up</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="8.43">your bathtub with water so that you can</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="5.88">flush your toilet if you&amp;#39;re stuck for</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="3.51">some reason like someone saying too late</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="5.84">no water no gas no gas containers none</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="6.21">of that stuff that&amp;#39;s unfortunate and</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="4.18">what I always like to do and what I did</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.32">in this instance is I got my community</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="5.67">together we made a community plan I got</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="5.72">all my neighbors and we kind of huddled</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="6.96">up and said okay you know who has what</text>
  <text start="294.41" dur="7.06">who is you know who can ration what chef</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="6.36">boyardee mac and cheese you can boil</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="7.62">water on your grill if you have to you</text>
  <text start="305.07" dur="5.76">know and just try and prepare as best</text>
  <text start="309.09" dur="3.329">you can because if you get stuck like</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="3.18">you can see what happens in Florida they</text>
  <text start="312.419" dur="4.261">said oh my gosh we&amp;#39;re so screwed and</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="7.35">everybody ran out and crank radio is yes</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="6.93">Maureen everybody ran out and bought up</text>
  <text start="321.36" dur="4.98">all the gas and there&amp;#39;s lines and Costco</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="5.97">and everybody is you know freaking out</text>
  <text start="326.34" dur="5.25">and you don&amp;#39;t have anything it&amp;#39;s no good</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="2.4">so I actually started preparing for</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="2.13">hurricane</text>
  <text start="331.98" dur="4.71">Irma when it came off the coast of</text>

  <text start="356.97" dur="4.85">the next model that high that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="6.389">down from Canada on the jet stream high</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="5.869">pushes that out more to sea and this</text>
  <text start="365.729" dur="5.131">becomes a non-issue for the</text>
  <text start="367.689" dur="6.57">east coast of the United States and</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="8.259">nobody should be upset with anybody if</text>
  <text start="374.259" dur="8.19">that happens nobody should be upset with</text>
  <text start="379.119" dur="5.19">anybody I actually have a in terms of</text>
  <text start="382.449" dur="3.57">like the rest like the the advanced</text>
  <text start="384.309" dur="4.53">preparedness and how the government sort</text>
  <text start="386.019" dur="5.341">of saying like you know this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="388.839" dur="4.26">a serious deal evacuations are mandatory</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="3.299">like people get mad when it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="2.85">happen but I don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.659" dur="3.451">necessarily the way that you should be</text>
  <text start="395.949" dur="8.19">doing it yes I did hear about the solar</text>
