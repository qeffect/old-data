  <text start="186.45" dur="4.38">hat tip to Byron New York and John Dowd</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="5.78">on this absolutely stunning interview</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="6.71">which we&amp;#39;re going to analyze today so</text>
  <text start="194.57" dur="6.669">we&amp;#39;re gonna start at the two minute and</text>
  <text start="197.54" dur="6.75">forty second mark and this clip that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="201.239" dur="6.571">about to play for you is about when</text>
  <text start="204.29" dur="5.23">doubt is is asked about the conclusions</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="3.42">of the Special Counsel investigation and</text>
  <text start="209.52" dur="2.939">what they are and what do you thinks</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="2.52">about them and he says a couple very</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="3.75">interesting things that aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="3.87">poked into here which is fine I also</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="3.361">want to point out too as we listen to</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="4.32">this that you&amp;#39;re going to hear sometimes</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="5.1">that byron york speaks over John Dowd</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s not on purpose and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="4.56">the doubt is able to immediately hear</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="3.9">Byron York so that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="2.7">some of the you know people are stepping</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="3.75">on each other a little bit</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="5.63">and that&amp;#39;s evident as it goes on there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="4.949">a delay so just bear with that and</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="3.13">understand that there&amp;#39;s no one being</text>
  <text start="239.459" dur="2.611">rude here it&amp;#39;s just some sort of a</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="6.9">technical glitch and doubt it&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="242.07" dur="15.66">phone let&amp;#39;s begin Attorney General boy</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="13.619">he&amp;#39;s a remarkable and so well let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="257.73" dur="4.97">it everybody wants to see the whole</text>
  <text start="261.209" dur="4.641">point but</text>
  <text start="262.7" dur="6.78">very complicated subject when you other</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="7.02">departmental rules and the law governing</text>
  <text start="269.48" dur="5.49">privacy and privilege etc to thread this</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.58">needle and get it out I thought he did a</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="6.35">terrific job a very short time and kept</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="7.02">his word to be as they like to say</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="8.32">transparent so I was really pleased well</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="8.33">he quoted just two lines from the Muller</text>
  <text start="289.64" dur="6.69">report on the issue of conspiracy or</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="5.59">coordination what we refer to as</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="4.59">collusion the word term is collusion and</text>
  <text start="299.39" dur="3.87">he said that the investigation and this</text>
  <text start="300.92" dur="5.16">is this is bar quoting Mulder</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="4.62">the investigation did not establish that</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="3.33">members of the Trump campaign conspired</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="3.57">or coordinated with the Russian</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="4.41">government in its election interference</text>
  <text start="311.45" dur="4.59">activities and he also said again</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="3.81">quoting the Muller report the evidence</text>
  <text start="316.04" dur="3.6">does not establish that the president</text>
  <text start="317.63" dur="5.58">was involved in an underlying crime</text>
  <text start="319.64" dur="5.67">related to Russian election interference</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="4.65">and what you&amp;#39;re seeing already are a</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="4.02">number of Democrats who who say well he</text>
  <text start="327.86" dur="4.2">didn&amp;#39;t say there was no evidence of</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="5.25">collusion this is not definitive we</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t know what the real story here is I</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="20.72">mean what can you add to what those two</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="25.38">sentences of Muller&amp;#39;s are produced</text>
  <text start="355.3" dur="8.46">there&amp;#39;s no coercion conspiracy joint</text>
  <text start="362.24" dur="5.7">venture whatever you want to call it</text>
  <text start="363.76" dur="7.63">with the Russians and apparently as I</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="5.91">understand it they tried like lasers and</text>
  <text start="371.39" dur="4.53">they tried to penetrate the Trump</text>
  <text start="373.85" dur="7.05">Organization what devil were able to dis</text>
  <text start="375.92" dur="6.33">also you know it&amp;#39;s when you say they</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="3.65">tried like blazes who you&amp;#39;re referring</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="2.3">to</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="3.1">we&amp;#39;re gonna start this back up in a</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="5.42">second but I wanted to point out a</text>
  <text start="390.2" dur="7.4">couple things here he says apparently</text>
  <text start="394.51" dur="5.25">so apparently they tried to and then</text>
  <text start="397.6" dur="4.56">Byron says who who tried to the Russians</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="5.79">and they also mentioned in here that</text>
  <text start="402.16" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the Trump Organization not</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="5.16">just necessarily the campaign it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.92" dur="4.71">interesting here he&amp;#39;s really transparent</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="3.42">throughout this interview very very</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="3.21">transparent you&amp;#39;ll hear that you&amp;#39;ll hear</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="3.51">the authenticity in his voice so was use</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="3.78">of that word means to me that either he</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="4.08">knows and that&amp;#39;s all a ruse he knows</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="4.29">about the plants the attempted contact I</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t think that the Muller report is</text>
  <text start="423.91" dur="4.73">going to show that I think the Muller</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="4.92">reports going to say that these were</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="5.95">Russian connected individuals or</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="5.28">Russians that attempted to walk into the</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="3.72">campaign or the Trump Organization but</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="6.42">in actuality they were really plants</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="6.42">everybody knows that most people know or</text>
  <text start="443.02" dur="3.9">understand that it wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="5.94">Russians trying to impede the election</text>
  <text start="446.92" dur="7.95">that it was a huge coup that was put on</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="7.2">here and so there may be information</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="5.19">inside the Moller report about what</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="4.32">Muller quote found during his</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="3.51">investigation and then in a second he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="3.57">going to also confirm the entire</text>
  <text start="463.57" dur="4.08">investigation was a ruse that call me</text>
  <text start="465.76" dur="4.41">and others admitted the investigation</text>
  <text start="467.65" dur="3.45">began without a predicate for a crime</text>
  <text start="470.17" dur="7.74">which is something that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="471.1" dur="11.18">talking about for a while everyone</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="9.51">associated with the president in his</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="11.62">campaign did not take any date or get</text>
  <text start="487.42" dur="9.09">engaged or whatever I think just</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="3.12">watching how the president what he liked</text>
  <text start="496.51" dur="4.47">him</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="6.03">was it off he an aide in helping you</text>
  <text start="500.98" dur="4.14">know he carried carry the load Brewer</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="5.75">effectively so you know it was a</text>
  <text start="505.12" dur="8.25">terrible ruse to be as the whole</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="6.49">investigation and the allegations were</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="5.85">without basis from the beginning of this</text>
  <text start="515.29" dur="6.33">now but admitted by quarry and by the</text>
  <text start="519.22" dur="5.97">counter intelligence colleagues in the</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.26">FBI they had nothing when they started</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="4.47">this and</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="5.01">special counsel so it&amp;#39;s probably the</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="3.87">greatest fraud</text>
  <text start="530.89" dur="6.27">I will committed against the people of</text>
  <text start="533.53" dur="5.64">the United States and you know it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="3.96">frustrating for the president and it</text>
  <text start="539.17" dur="10.26">actually did interfere with his ability</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="10.74">to do his job so I can add anymore is</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="3.81">entirely correct based of my knowledge I</text>
  <text start="551.86" dur="4.83">mean I know what the evidence says</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="6.27">because along with others we produce it</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="4.47">we produced a special counsel we know</text>
  <text start="559.51" dur="5.88">what the testimony was we know the</text>
  <text start="561.16" dur="7.08">document showing cetera so you know as</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="5.94">an outsider what you saw was this kind</text>
  <text start="568.24" dur="6">of cycle of excitement there would be a</text>
  <text start="571.33" dur="4.95">new story about say the Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="574.24" dur="3.93">meeting the first when that whenever</text>
  <text start="576.28" dur="5.4">that was first reported that June 8th</text>
  <text start="578.17" dur="5.43">June 9th 2016 meeting in trouble</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re just I&amp;#39;m stopping it cuz we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.6" dur="3.78">gonna take this now as a separate</text>
  <text start="585.28" dur="3.84">section to analyze so start listening</text>
  <text start="587.38" dur="3.03">from now putting what we just heard</text>
  <text start="589.12" dur="3.21">aside for a second we&amp;#39;ll start to</text>
  <text start="590.41" dur="4.59">analyze this section right here listen</text>
  <text start="592.33" dur="4.74">closely tower everybody would get</text>
  <text start="595" dur="3.81">extremely excited about it and it would</text>
  <text start="597.07" dur="3.6">up be talk this is proof of collusion or</text>
  <text start="598.81" dur="5.19">then they would be talk about well</text>
  <text start="600.67" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s a report that the Roger stone</text>
  <text start="604" dur="3.63">has been in touch with WikiLeaks and</text>
  <text start="606.19" dur="3.9">everybody to get very excited about that</text>
  <text start="607.63" dur="5.88">this is collusion did you know all this</text>
  <text start="610.09" dur="6.09">stuff the whole time you were the</text>
  <text start="613.51" dur="4.29">president&amp;#39;s lawyer and it felt confident</text>
  <text start="616.18" dur="4.32">about the evidence involving that at</text>
  <text start="617.8" dur="4.89">that time so basically what he&amp;#39;s asking</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="3.93">is do all these Press reports that came</text>
  <text start="622.69" dur="3.87">out about the meeting and all kinds of</text>
  <text start="624.43" dur="4.56">other things that happened as his lawyer</text>
  <text start="626.56" dur="6.09">were you aware of these events at the</text>
  <text start="628.99" dur="5.31">time before they maybe even were</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="6.78">reported at all and were you ready</text>
  <text start="634.3" dur="8.46">basically to talk about those okay so</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="6.42">you were not you were not surprised when</text>
  <text start="642.76" dur="6">some press report came out reporting</text>
  <text start="645.85" dur="10.5">some previously publicly unknown event</text>
  <text start="648.76" dur="9.39">such as the Trump Tower meeting due at</text>
  <text start="656.35" dur="2.979">the time I found out very quickly that</text>
  <text start="658.15" dur="4.869">there was just no base</text>
  <text start="659.329" dur="8.25">just to it but you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="663.019" dur="8.01">homework had been done that the public</text>
  <text start="667.579" dur="5.85">saw we&amp;#39;re all done by a very very evil</text>
  <text start="671.029" dur="6.951">counsel across the board including the</text>
  <text start="673.429" dur="6.65">Trump Organization there&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="677.98" dur="4.509">quite a group of lawyers that</text>
  <text start="680.079" dur="4.45">represented people in organizations in</text>
  <text start="682.489" dur="3.75">this and they did their work and they</text>
  <text start="684.529" dur="6.381">were beautifully organized and prepared</text>
  <text start="686.239" dur="8.85">so you were no surprises and you know I</text>
  <text start="690.91" dur="7.209">you know I I had to put out I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="695.089" dur="5.131">how many fake news Flyers but the</text>
  <text start="698.119" dur="5.07">hysteria was beyond anything I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="700.22" dur="4.619">seen and sometimes you could tell them</text>
  <text start="703.189" dur="3.63">that it&amp;#39;s wrong and didn&amp;#39;t matter they</text>
  <text start="704.839" dur="8.1">printed it anyway or published it anyway</text>
  <text start="706.819" dur="7.95">and and it was one of the sorriest</text>
  <text start="712.939" dur="7.77">chapters I&amp;#39;ve ever witnessed in this</text>
  <text start="714.769" dur="7.62">country so now we have uh okay he says</text>
  <text start="720.709" dur="4.261">the heat that they either knew at the</text>
  <text start="722.389" dur="4.5">time of when those Press reports were</text>
  <text start="724.97" dur="4.529">put out or they quickly internally</text>
  <text start="726.889" dur="3.57">investigated it to find out that there</text>
  <text start="729.499" dur="4.17">was nothing to it</text>
  <text start="730.459" dur="5.28">a lot in there to unpack so this means</text>
  <text start="733.669" dur="4.35">we were absolutely there were absolutely</text>
  <text start="735.739" dur="4.41">completely fake stories coming out in</text>
  <text start="738.019" dur="4.29">the media which begs the question who</text>
  <text start="740.149" dur="4.8">was leaking the fake info was it done on</text>
  <text start="742.309" dur="4.25">purpose was it done with reporters</text>
  <text start="744.949" dur="4.95">thinking they had accurate information</text>
  <text start="746.559" dur="5.291">was it a case of the leaks are real but</text>
  <text start="749.899" dur="4.201">the news is fake and another interesting</text>
  <text start="751.85" dur="4.679">part of this is that Trump had a team of</text>
  <text start="754.1" dur="4.529">investigators and lawyers who did their</text>
  <text start="756.529" dur="5.16">own work and were quote beautifully</text>
  <text start="758.629" dur="4.89">prepared there were no surprises Dowd</text>
  <text start="761.689" dur="3.601">says he had to put out a ton of fires</text>
  <text start="763.519" dur="3.391">the media printed things that they knew</text>
  <text start="765.29" dur="3.209">weren&amp;#39;t true or was shown weren&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="766.91" dur="6.419">did it matter to them anyway they</text>
  <text start="768.499" dur="7.53">printed them anyway the fact that Rudy</text>
  <text start="773.329" dur="4.081">Giuliani has been on the news media</text>
  <text start="776.029" dur="3.18">several times in several interviews</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="4.469">saying they had their own investigation</text>
  <text start="779.209" dur="4.081">they did they had a team of lawyers as</text>
  <text start="781.879" dur="4.32">per Dowd that were doing this owned</text>
  <text start="783.29" dur="5.129">their own investigation probably during</text>
  <text start="786.199" dur="3.39">the course of preparing these witnesses</text>
  <text start="788.419" dur="4.16">who were going to learn throughout the</text>
  <text start="789.589" dur="2.99">course of this investor</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="3.36">freely made available everybody you</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="4.471">could possibly think of to the Muller</text>
  <text start="796.79" dur="5.22">investigation they started doing their</text>
  <text start="800" dur="3.63">own homework to write their own report</text>
  <text start="802.01" dur="3.93">which is what Rudy Giuliani has</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="4.86">referenced several times and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.94" dur="4.649">basically what we&amp;#39;ve done here in the in</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="3.81">the journalism space that at least</text>
  <text start="810.589" dur="3.991">actually people that were actually doing</text>
  <text start="812.3" dur="5.22">a good job the Chuck Ross is the Jeff</text>
  <text start="814.58" dur="4.04">Carlson to the world the dan von Geno&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.52" dur="4.5">of the world</text>
  <text start="818.62" dur="5.65">trying to tell this real the actual real</text>
  <text start="822.02" dur="5.46">story they had their own team of</text>
  <text start="824.27" dur="6">brilliant attorneys doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="4.71">at the same time so there&amp;#39;s the end of</text>
  <text start="830.27" dur="3.48">that segment analysis we&amp;#39;ll move on to</text>
  <text start="832.19" dur="6.269">the next segment analysis which actually</text>
  <text start="833.75" dur="7.56">picks up at about eight minutes which is</text>
  <text start="838.459" dur="4.171">four seconds from now and again I I kept</text>
  <text start="841.31" dur="3.42">saying I&amp;#39;m gonna separate this into</text>
  <text start="842.63" dur="3.45">bunches but it just the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="844.73" dur="4.109">great so let&amp;#39;s just play through we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="846.08" dur="4.47">gonna go from eight it&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="848.839" dur="3.87">minutes here of talk and there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="850.55" dur="3.93">to unpack in that too so here we go we</text>
  <text start="852.709" dur="2.791">had some reports that the president</text>
  <text start="854.48" dur="4.5">spoke to some members of Congress</text>
  <text start="855.5" dur="6.54">recently after the release of the bar</text>
  <text start="858.98" dur="7.44">summary and he described the Moller</text>
  <text start="862.04" dur="6.33">investigation as quote two years of and</text>
  <text start="866.42" dur="6.09">I believe that probably does summarizes</text>
  <text start="868.37" dur="8.9">his attitude or his opinion of it but at</text>
  <text start="872.51" dur="7.68">the time you were advising him</text>
  <text start="877.27" dur="7.6">consistently to cooperate with Muller</text>
  <text start="880.19" dur="7.11">isn&amp;#39;t that what happened okay so he</text>
  <text start="884.87" dur="4.86">thinks this is a an investigation but</text>
  <text start="887.3" dur="5.82">under the advice on the advice of you</text>
  <text start="889.73" dur="5.67">and others he is turning over lots of</text>
  <text start="893.12" dur="5.73">materials and doing other things and as</text>
  <text start="895.4" dur="5.58">that cooperation involves well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="898.85" dur="4.59">right and for a very good reason buyer</text>
  <text start="900.98" dur="4.67">it&amp;#39;s a good point you raise and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="903.44" dur="5.91">subject I discussed with Mullen and</text>
  <text start="905.65" dur="6.129">particularly judge of course is his</text>
  <text start="909.35" dur="4.44">deputy who I dealt was most of the time</text>
  <text start="911.779" dur="6.87">and that is a lot of people never</text>
  <text start="913.79" dur="6.72">understood that the president has a</text>
  <text start="918.649" dur="3.801">chief law enforcement officer he was</text>
  <text start="920.51" dur="4.91">well aware that he was</text>
  <text start="922.45" dur="5.25">so he had to support that conducting an</text>
  <text start="925.42" dur="5.22">investigation and it was important that</text>
  <text start="927.7" dur="5.85">he respect the fact of that</text>
  <text start="930.64" dur="6.21">investigation in the inquiry and thus</text>
  <text start="933.55" dur="5.85">his response on a factual basis even</text>
  <text start="936.85" dur="8.31">though constitutional and legally they</text>
  <text start="939.4" dur="7.47">had annoyed to do the inquiry where we</text>
  <text start="945.16" dur="5.1">made a decision with the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.87" dur="6.21">full agreement we would respect it in</text>
  <text start="950.26" dur="5.85">honoring and we told him all of that and</text>
  <text start="953.08" dur="5.46">you know everybody would call it a hoax</text>
  <text start="956.11" dur="4.59">etcetera well he had to deal with the</text>
  <text start="958.54" dur="3.6">political side of that and while all of</text>
  <text start="960.7" dur="3.63">the study was dealing with the political</text>
  <text start="962.14" dur="5.01">side of it but what I was worried about</text>
  <text start="964.33" dur="5.19">was am I gonna get cooperation and we</text>
  <text start="967.15" dur="4.53">made sure he did we encouraged and the</text>
  <text start="969.52" dur="7.8">president publicly encouraged people to</text>
  <text start="971.68" dur="9.98">fully cooperate and I as say hundreds of</text>
  <text start="977.32" dur="8.49">times I tailor to anyone to find a</text>
  <text start="981.66" dur="7.83">president that was so fully cooperative</text>
  <text start="985.81" dur="9.05">and transparent and I must say</text>
  <text start="989.49" dur="10.12">particularly the intimate notes of his</text>
  <text start="994.86" dur="8.32">counsel and other senior staff that we</text>
  <text start="999.61" dur="6.89">produced I mean any dollars notes who</text>
  <text start="1003.18" dur="7.23">takes the 15 hours to read form and they</text>
  <text start="1006.5" dur="6.76">there&amp;#39;s a real-time comments and</text>
  <text start="1010.41" dur="5.46">thoughts of the president in conference</text>
  <text start="1013.26" dur="6.51">with Don Verdean and other lawyers etc</text>
  <text start="1015.87" dur="6.6">and previous times and his chief of</text>
  <text start="1019.77" dur="4.59">staff previous and other people so I</text>
  <text start="1022.47" dur="3.51">mean it was remarkable that that</text>
  <text start="1024.36" dur="4.14">material was produced that we could</text>
  <text start="1025.98" dur="5.79">produce it under executive privilege</text>
  <text start="1028.5" dur="4.74">because Bob or his team were not only</text>
  <text start="1031.77" dur="4.29">cleared but they were within the</text>
  <text start="1033.24" dur="9.05">executive so we can share it and protect</text>
  <text start="1036.06" dur="9.5">it and that&amp;#39;s the tricky thing that so</text>
  <text start="1042.29" dur="5.98">we made a decision internally they say</text>
  <text start="1045.56" dur="4.66">that we would respect an honor Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1048.27" dur="3.72">position and Muller was worried that</text>
  <text start="1050.22" dur="4.35">they wouldn&amp;#39;t get cooperation but they</text>
  <text start="1051.99" dur="4.11">made sure that he got cooperation he</text>
  <text start="1054.57" dur="3.75">says quote I challenge any</text>
  <text start="1056.1" dur="5.069">to find a president so cooperative and</text>
  <text start="1058.32" dur="5.79">transparent sharing intimate notes of</text>
  <text start="1061.169" dur="4.651">his council and senior staff real-time</text>
  <text start="1064.11" dur="3.23">comments and thoughts of the President</text>
  <text start="1065.82" dur="5.37">of the United States</text>
  <text start="1067.34" dur="6.28">this means that Muller and his team have</text>
  <text start="1071.19" dur="5.22">all of that information which could be</text>
  <text start="1073.62" dur="6.72">it could be looked at as a positive or a</text>
  <text start="1076.41" dur="6.48">negative these were like detailed</text>
  <text start="1080.34" dur="5.25">detailed notes taking taken during</text>
  <text start="1082.89" dur="4.89">conference at the highest levels between</text>
  <text start="1085.59" dur="7.56">the attorney for the president and the</text>
  <text start="1087.78" dur="7.47">president in the United States so think</text>
  <text start="1093.15" dur="4.92">about this Muller if he&amp;#39;s out to get</text>
  <text start="1095.25" dur="4.44">Trump is likely to have taken parts and</text>
  <text start="1098.07" dur="4.08">pieces of those notes and stuffed them</text>
  <text start="1099.69" dur="3.57">somewhere in his report specifically</text>
  <text start="1102.15" dur="3.21">unlikely when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="1103.26" dur="3.69">obstruction portion of things and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1105.36" dur="4.26">one of those concerns that I have about</text>
  <text start="1106.95" dur="4.55">transparency and that these are not good</text>
  <text start="1109.62" dur="4.77">people</text>
  <text start="1111.5" dur="5.62">they&amp;#39;re not good people that are helping</text>
  <text start="1114.39" dur="4.89">the DOJ with doing these redactions</text>
  <text start="1117.12" dur="6.059">inside the Muller report so barse has</text>
  <text start="1119.28" dur="5.67">said repeatedly that he has Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1123.179" dur="6.091">team helping him to redact information</text>
  <text start="1124.95" dur="5.49">within the report they could</text>
  <text start="1129.27" dur="3.5">purposefully leave something</text>
  <text start="1130.44" dur="5.82">embarrassing or not so perfect in there</text>
  <text start="1132.77" dur="5.769">and someone might not catch it or if</text>
  <text start="1136.26" dur="5.399">we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re coming up in crouching upon</text>
  <text start="1138.539" dur="5.071">privilege and this is released does it</text>
  <text start="1141.659" dur="3.841">then fundamentally kind of change the</text>
  <text start="1143.61" dur="5.46">thoughts about presidential privilege</text>
  <text start="1145.5" dur="5.159">and set a precedent moving forward in</text>
  <text start="1149.07" dur="4.83">terms of that so would that be a good</text>
  <text start="1150.659" dur="4.951">thing or a bad thing a bad thing and as</text>
  <text start="1153.9" dur="3.3">I was writing this little section I</text>
  <text start="1155.61" dur="3.36">stopped it right where I just stopped it</text>
  <text start="1157.2" dur="3.66">and then I pressed play again and I</text>
  <text start="1158.97" dur="6">noticed that doubt addresses this very</text>
  <text start="1160.86" dur="9.42">thing which is great that Tiger bar now</text>
  <text start="1164.97" dur="12.51">has to deal with is how you know unwind</text>
  <text start="1170.28" dur="10.59">that without invading you know some very</text>
  <text start="1177.48" dur="9.42">intimate conversations they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1180.87" dur="7.7">incriminating it&amp;#39;s just you want to be</text>
  <text start="1186.9" dur="5.75">careful not to say</text>
  <text start="1188.57" dur="6.06">the historical precedent that will prey</text>
  <text start="1192.65" dur="4.71">upon another president and this</text>
  <text start="1194.63" dur="6.48">president was always concerned about</text>
  <text start="1197.36" dur="7.53">them the historical aspect of how he</text>
  <text start="1201.11" dur="5">acted but the last element of this</text>
  <text start="1204.89" dur="7.71">cooperation</text>
  <text start="1206.11" dur="7.6">Byron was - okay so there&amp;#39;s that segment</text>
  <text start="1212.6" dur="2.94">and now we&amp;#39;re going to move into the</text>
  <text start="1213.71" dur="2.49">next segment we&amp;#39;re gonna unpack as a</text>
  <text start="1215.54" dur="2.46">standalone</text>
  <text start="1216.2" dur="4.14">this is about the length of the</text>
  <text start="1218" dur="4.89">investigation how they worked with the</text>
  <text start="1220.34" dur="4.86">Special Counsel and what they had to say</text>
  <text start="1222.89" dur="3.93">about that and and this again</text>
  <text start="1225.2" dur="3.18">stunning interview I mean it&amp;#39;s just such</text>
  <text start="1226.82" dur="5.19">a stunning look inside this will be</text>
  <text start="1228.38" dur="5.85">probably chronicled for years and years</text>
  <text start="1232.01" dur="3.78">and years to come as one of the first</text>
  <text start="1234.23" dur="2.43">kind of open interviews about what</text>
  <text start="1235.79" dur="4.71">happened with the Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="1236.66" dur="8.16">investigation get the job done as fast</text>
  <text start="1240.5" dur="8.16">as we could and I had a deal worked out</text>
  <text start="1244.82" dur="8.22">said that Mike Boeing was with me when</text>
  <text start="1248.66" dur="7.59">we first met with Bob and quarrels and</text>
  <text start="1253.04" dur="6.51">another colleague of Bob&amp;#39;s and when I</text>
  <text start="1256.25" dur="5.39">first began push began and Bob we made a</text>
  <text start="1259.55" dur="7.44">deal that we would put aside our</text>
  <text start="1261.64" dur="8.47">objections constitutional conflicts etc</text>
  <text start="1266.99" dur="6.45">so we put told us aside and fully</text>
  <text start="1270.11" dur="6.36">cooperate and get him every document he</text>
  <text start="1273.44" dur="6.6">requested and every witness he requested</text>
  <text start="1276.47" dur="5.1">and with the you know asking to with us</text>
  <text start="1280.04" dur="4.92">to the extent that he could with the</text>
  <text start="1281.57" dur="5.16">brace of counsel to cooperate and he</text>
  <text start="1284.96" dur="4.41">said that he would not with any grass</text>
  <text start="1286.73" dur="5.19">grow and room and he would not he would</text>
  <text start="1289.37" dur="4.32">go about it as fast as he could and</text>
  <text start="1291.92" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s probably my greatest</text>
  <text start="1293.69" dur="6.27">disappointment is he didn&amp;#39;t and I mean</text>
  <text start="1296.84" dur="6.45">he had by early December he had</text>
  <text start="1299.96" dur="8.52">exhausted all of the evidence and the</text>
  <text start="1303.29" dur="7.8">witnesses best December of 2017 7 2007</text>
  <text start="1308.48" dur="5.73">armed but that&amp;#39;s what the president the</text>
  <text start="1311.09" dur="6.3">key is that the president you know made</text>
  <text start="1314.21" dur="5.5">those decisions on our recommendations</text>
  <text start="1317.39" dur="4.96">to get it done and we thought</text>
  <text start="1319.71" dur="7.83">a good chance of getting this thing</text>
  <text start="1322.35" dur="6.93">wrapped up by you know Thanksgiving or</text>
  <text start="1327.54" dur="5.97">early December</text>
  <text start="1329.28" dur="5.94">you know many witnesses were so listen</text>
  <text start="1333.51" dur="3.15">that that that&amp;#39;s just stunning so</text>
  <text start="1335.22" dur="3.68">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is there</text>
  <text start="1336.66" dur="4.8">was sort of like a gentlemen&amp;#39;s agreement</text>
  <text start="1338.9" dur="4.24">that they would everybody would put</text>
  <text start="1341.46" dur="3.42">aside their objection so like if Muller</text>
  <text start="1343.14" dur="4.76">were to come to the T Trump team and say</text>
  <text start="1344.88" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;d like to interview Ivanka 30 times</text>
  <text start="1347.9" dur="7.6">within reason of course they would say</text>
  <text start="1350.16" dur="6.84">okay it wasn&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t any pushback</text>
  <text start="1355.5" dur="3.54">from the White House at all they dumped</text>
  <text start="1357" dur="4.62">over everything because the thought was</text>
  <text start="1359.04" dur="3.9">between the two the special counsel in</text>
  <text start="1361.62" dur="2.58">the White House that if they provided</text>
  <text start="1362.94" dur="3.54">everything they&amp;#39;d get it done as quickly</text>
  <text start="1364.2" dur="9.84">as possible now lately we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1366.48" dur="10.86">hearing a lot about a lot about when</text>
  <text start="1374.04" dur="5.16">Muller knew the rat the investigation</text>
  <text start="1377.34" dur="4.08">was wrapped up or when he knew that</text>
  <text start="1379.2" dur="4.29">collusion was a hoax and Dan von Geno&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1381.42" dur="4.23">been doing a lot of work into it I</text>
  <text start="1383.49" dur="4.05">actually have been poking around here as</text>
  <text start="1385.65" dur="3.83">well we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for a</text>
  <text start="1387.54" dur="5.76">really long time it appears as though</text>
  <text start="1389.48" dur="5.89">they they had exhausted all of the</text>
  <text start="1393.3" dur="7.26">witnesses and all of the evidence that</text>
  <text start="1395.37" dur="7.2">was provided by December of 2017 and the</text>
  <text start="1400.56" dur="4.41">president made the decisions to provide</text>
  <text start="1402.57" dur="3.75">everything so that they&amp;#39;d be able to get</text>
  <text start="1404.97" dur="3.69">this investigation wrapped up quickly</text>
  <text start="1406.32" dur="3.96">and one of the greatest disappointments</text>
  <text start="1408.66" dur="5.52">as per doubt is that Muller didn&amp;#39;t stick</text>
  <text start="1410.28" dur="5.37">to his word they didn&amp;#39;t need to the the</text>
  <text start="1414.18" dur="3.18">special counsel didn&amp;#39;t need to ask for</text>
  <text start="1415.65" dur="3.9">subpoenas didn&amp;#39;t need to get paperwork</text>
  <text start="1417.36" dur="4.23">done to get any information the Trump</text>
  <text start="1419.55" dur="4.32">team handed it all over they were lied</text>
  <text start="1421.59" dur="5.46">on each other&amp;#39;s integrity and Dowd says</text>
  <text start="1423.87" dur="5.49">he&amp;#39;s very very let down that the Special</text>
  <text start="1427.05" dur="2.73">Counsel didn&amp;#39;t follow their end of the</text>
  <text start="1429.36" dur="3">bargain</text>
  <text start="1429.78" dur="7.68">and and trailed this thing out as long</text>
  <text start="1432.36" dur="10.97">as they did we are going to start to get</text>
  <text start="1437.46" dur="9.57">into now around the 14-minute mark the</text>
  <text start="1443.33" dur="5.17">topic of the special counsel talking to</text>
  <text start="1447.03" dur="3.51">the President of the United States and</text>
  <text start="1448.5" dur="4.799">what the idea or what the thinking was</text>
  <text start="1450.54" dur="6.9">behind that and it again more really</text>
  <text start="1453.299" dur="6.09">amazing information in here you have to</text>
  <text start="1457.44" dur="5.04">ask the president that you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1459.389" dur="4.17">gotten the answer to already and you</text>
  <text start="1462.48" dur="4.199">know we went through a couple of</text>
  <text start="1463.559" dur="6.031">iterations I did with belongingness the</text>
  <text start="1466.679" dur="5.49">subsequent team do another where we give</text>
  <text start="1469.59" dur="5.279">me yes all of us over again referring to</text>
  <text start="1472.169" dur="6.38">the very testimony in documents he</text>
  <text start="1474.869" dur="6.961">already had and so we put it to them</text>
  <text start="1478.549" dur="5.23">then what&amp;#39;s the question you you have to</text>
  <text start="1481.83" dur="5.039">ask the president that you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1483.779" dur="4.14">gotten the answer to already and you</text>
  <text start="1486.869" dur="3.39">know we went through a couple of</text>
  <text start="1487.919" dur="5.73">iterations I did the belongingness</text>
  <text start="1490.259" dur="4.89">the subsequent team do another but only</text>
  <text start="1493.649" dur="3.421">get away yes and all their questions</text>
  <text start="1495.149" dur="6.12">over again referring to the very</text>
  <text start="1497.07" dur="6.299">testimony in documents he already had so</text>
  <text start="1501.269" dur="6.301">you know okay you want to be careful</text>
  <text start="1503.369" dur="8.28">you&amp;#39;ll do it again but he won so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1507.57" dur="13.559">that&amp;#39;s you know where we were with more</text>
  <text start="1511.649" dur="13.561">and let me ask my we&amp;#39;re in March 2019</text>
  <text start="1521.129" dur="6.12">yes let me ask you about something you</text>
  <text start="1525.21" dur="4.23">just mentioned and that&amp;#39;s about the</text>
  <text start="1527.249" dur="4.951">degree of cooperation when the president</text>
  <text start="1529.44" dur="5.599">talked to Don McGann who was during all</text>
  <text start="1532.2" dur="5.609">this period his White House Counsel</text>
  <text start="1535.039" dur="6.58">about this and other issues there was a</text>
  <text start="1537.809" dur="5.85">person there Annie Donaldson which is I</text>
  <text start="1541.619" dur="4.17">think it was McGann&amp;#39;s chief of staff a</text>
  <text start="1543.659" dur="4.65">person who&amp;#39;s taking detailed notes all</text>
  <text start="1545.789" dur="4.291">this time right okay in the notes say</text>
  <text start="1548.309" dur="2.25">what the president said and what</text>
  <text start="1550.08" dur="3.479">McGann&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1550.559" dur="7.651">what other people said excuse me Barbie</text>
  <text start="1553.559" dur="7.32">was there or the meeting with the</text>
  <text start="1558.21" dur="8.789">president and dictate to her that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1560.879" dur="7.831">it just occurred okay so okay so in</text>
  <text start="1566.999" dur="4.86">there are many pages of these notes</text>
  <text start="1568.71" dur="8.039">right all right and the and the White</text>
  <text start="1571.859" dur="7.14">House turns them over to Muller here did</text>
  <text start="1576.749" dur="3.27">you think about turning him over saying</text>
  <text start="1578.999" dur="3.091">that you know he&amp;#39;s talking with the</text>
  <text start="1580.019" dur="5.16">White House Counsel this is this could</text>
  <text start="1582.09" dur="6.969">be under executive privilege</text>
  <text start="1585.179" dur="6.61">yes we did but we made we had an</text>
  <text start="1589.059" dur="4.98">agreement with Bob that it was under</text>
  <text start="1591.789" dur="5.551">executive privilege and if he ever</text>
  <text start="1594.039" dur="5.431">wanted to use it publicly he had to come</text>
  <text start="1597.34" dur="6.089">back to the White House for permission</text>
  <text start="1599.47" dur="6.75">to use it and that&amp;#39;s where you know</text>
  <text start="1603.429" dur="5.07">Bilborough finds himself today bonding</text>
  <text start="1606.22" dur="4.169">it in a report released publicly what</text>
  <text start="1608.499" dur="6.471">would that include using another report</text>
  <text start="1610.389" dur="8.88">that is released publicly yes okay yeah</text>
  <text start="1614.97" dur="7.809">that&amp;#39;s one of the challenges that the</text>
  <text start="1619.269" dur="6.87">Attorney General has as to what to</text>
  <text start="1622.779" dur="7.561">release and if it&amp;#39;s was that the</text>
  <text start="1626.139" dur="6.24">executive privilege pipeline then he has</text>
  <text start="1630.34" dur="8.219">to go back to White House Counsel and</text>
  <text start="1632.379" dur="10.861">the president to get a waiver now okay a</text>
  <text start="1638.559" dur="6.931">couple things here the topic of</text>
  <text start="1643.24" dur="4.139">executive privilege Dowd States they had</text>
  <text start="1645.49" dur="3.179">an agreement with Muller they ever want</text>
  <text start="1647.379" dur="3.481">to use any of these notes content</text>
  <text start="1648.669" dur="3.99">contemporaneous or otherwise publicly</text>
  <text start="1650.86" dur="3.529">they&amp;#39;d have to come back to the White</text>
  <text start="1652.659" dur="3.811">House and ask permission</text>
  <text start="1654.389" dur="5.11">here&amp;#39;s an interesting thought for</text>
  <text start="1656.47" dur="5.61">everybody Barr has stated several times</text>
  <text start="1659.499" dur="4.441">now that he is not going to the White</text>
  <text start="1662.08" dur="3.929">House for anything in regards to the</text>
  <text start="1663.94" dur="3.599">Muller report and the reasons for that</text>
  <text start="1666.009" dur="3.15">are many one of which being that the</text>
  <text start="1667.539" dur="3.301">White House doesn&amp;#39;t want the accusation</text>
  <text start="1669.159" dur="3.9">out there that they had any influence on</text>
  <text start="1670.84" dur="4.529">the release of the information etc but</text>
  <text start="1673.059" dur="4.411">again I sort of worry about this</text>
  <text start="1675.369" dur="5.01">gentleman&amp;#39;s kind of agreement going on</text>
  <text start="1677.47" dur="4.5">here because what if Muller like slips</text>
  <text start="1680.379" dur="3.18">some of that in and what if there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1681.97" dur="2.61">oversight on the part of Barr what</text>
  <text start="1683.559" dur="4.681">happens then right</text>
  <text start="1684.58" dur="6.059">or is Barr saying unequivocally none of</text>
  <text start="1688.24" dur="5.039">this stuff is going in there and is he</text>
  <text start="1690.639" dur="4.561">triple checking to make sure that none</text>
  <text start="1693.279" dur="5.64">of that stuff is going in there because</text>
  <text start="1695.2" dur="5.13">they have the ability to look through</text>
  <text start="1698.919" dur="3.36">all of this evidence and all of this</text>
  <text start="1700.33" dur="2.91">stuff before they put the report out and</text>
  <text start="1702.279" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s just something that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1703.24" dur="4.86">going to even go near and include just</text>
  <text start="1705.639" dur="4.62">really interesting there to think about</text>
  <text start="1708.1" dur="4.319">this again this interview is blowing my</text>
  <text start="1710.259" dur="3.78">mind really is the whole thing is so</text>
  <text start="1712.419" dur="4.26">great we&amp;#39;re only at 16 minutes I hope</text>
  <text start="1714.039" dur="4.351">you guys are sticking with me all right</text>
  <text start="1716.679" dur="3.991">so now we&amp;#39;re gonna pick up</text>
  <text start="1718.39" dur="4.08">talk a little bit about people grand</text>
  <text start="1720.67" dur="11.64">jury stuff etc there&amp;#39;s some interesting</text>
  <text start="1722.47" dur="13.98">things here - 17 minutes people who</text>
  <text start="1732.31" dur="9.38">cooperated and exposing them you know to</text>
  <text start="1736.45" dur="9.12">public scrutiny and attack which we live</text>
  <text start="1741.69" dur="8.86">in an atmosphere of hate right down this</text>
  <text start="1745.57" dur="11.97">is the hater of America and I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1750.55" dur="8.34">anybody if they start releasing I talked</text>
  <text start="1757.54" dur="3.03">about this on the Hagman report also</text>
  <text start="1758.89" dur="4.5">they start releasing grand jury</text>
  <text start="1760.57" dur="5.49">testimony and let&amp;#39;s say in the course of</text>
  <text start="1763.39" dur="4.68">the investigation they said we need to</text>
  <text start="1766.06" dur="5.82">witness interview witness Joe and</text>
  <text start="1768.07" dur="5.85">witness Joe gets on the stand and they</text>
  <text start="1771.88" dur="3.84">in the course of looking into everything</text>
  <text start="1773.92" dur="5.49">had found that witness Joe was having an</text>
  <text start="1775.72" dur="6.92">affair or witness Joe likes to pick his</text>
  <text start="1779.41" dur="3.23">nose outside the tree in the backyard</text>
  <text start="1783.18" dur="5.68">witness Joe did nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="1785.5" dur="5.37">but on releasing this information would</text>
  <text start="1788.86" dur="4.68">cause witness Joe to become the Thar a</text>
  <text start="1790.87" dur="5.34">target when witness Joe was just doing</text>
  <text start="1793.54" dur="5.55">his you know due diligence as a citizen</text>
  <text start="1796.21" dur="5.19">testifying in front of a grand jury so</text>
  <text start="1799.09" dur="3.63">if what what doubt is basically saying</text>
  <text start="1801.4" dur="3.36">is it&amp;#39;s like if you think that the media</text>
  <text start="1802.72" dur="4.01">and the the partisans and the crazy</text>
  <text start="1804.76" dur="4.86">extremists are not going to latch on to</text>
  <text start="1806.73" dur="4.69">some of these people and exploit some of</text>
  <text start="1809.62" dur="3.06">these personal things or other things</text>
  <text start="1811.42" dur="2.88">that may come out in the course of the</text>
  <text start="1812.68" dur="3.06">testimony being released you&amp;#39;re out of</text>
  <text start="1814.3" dur="3.54">your mind and we need to be really</text>
  <text start="1815.74" dur="3.69">careful to protect those people not to</text>
  <text start="1817.84" dur="3.24">mention that the Democrats are demanding</text>
  <text start="1819.43" dur="3.48">all of this information be released and</text>
  <text start="1821.08" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s against the law to release it in</text>
  <text start="1822.91" dur="3.81">all of the other special counsel</text>
  <text start="1824.41" dur="3.93">investigations they had to go to a court</text>
  <text start="1826.72" dur="3.9">and get the permission of a judge to</text>
  <text start="1828.34" dur="3.84">release the grand jury testimony I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1830.62" dur="3.81">think we should have the grand jury</text>
  <text start="1832.18" dur="4.5">testimony released because I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1834.43" dur="3.84">too dangerous and it sets a precedent</text>
  <text start="1836.68" dur="4.79">that we don&amp;#39;t want to continue I mean I</text>
  <text start="1838.27" dur="3.2">wouldn&amp;#39;t want that to continue</text>
  <text start="1841.5" dur="4.84">what the case information be public but</text>
  <text start="1844.24" dur="4.83">the grand jury testimony is just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1846.34" dur="3.33">just it&amp;#39;s not supposed to be that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1849.07" dur="2.32">my opinion</text>
  <text start="1849.67" dur="3.1">anyway</text>
  <text start="1851.39" dur="4.14">the next segment we&amp;#39;re going to go into</text>
  <text start="1852.77" dur="6.18">here doubt says that there were actually</text>
  <text start="1855.53" dur="6.33">three obstacles to releasing the</text>
  <text start="1858.95" dur="4.77">information here to the public now this</text>
  <text start="1861.86" dur="5.9">is really really really important that</text>
  <text start="1863.72" dur="6.839">you listen and listen to quick closely</text>
  <text start="1867.76" dur="5.2">from 17 minutes and 55 seconds it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1870.559" dur="4.201">couple minutes long make sure you you</text>
  <text start="1872.96" dur="3.21">tune in you you know tune in here and</text>
  <text start="1874.76" dur="4.49">pay close attention to what he says and</text>
  <text start="1876.17" dur="6.66">we&amp;#39;ll go over it as soon as he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1879.25" dur="6.49">report it sounds like there are really</text>
  <text start="1882.83" dur="6.089">three obstacles one is the grand jury</text>
  <text start="1885.74" dur="5.91">material which doesn&amp;#39;t strike me as a</text>
  <text start="1888.919" dur="5.13">huge obstacle because Muller and Barr</text>
  <text start="1891.65" dur="4.35">could asking a court to approve the</text>
  <text start="1894.049" dur="5.461">release of the grand jury material in</text>
  <text start="1896" dur="6.72">the report and beyond that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1899.51" dur="6.45">classified material and then beyond that</text>
  <text start="1902.72" dur="4.589">there is a material covered by what you</text>
  <text start="1905.96" dur="3.51">were just discussing which is the</text>
  <text start="1907.309" dur="5.941">executive privilege issue which do you</text>
  <text start="1909.47" dur="8.11">think is the most consequential of those</text>

  <text start="1921.22" dur="5.5">don&amp;#39;t know I think probably the</text>
  <text start="1924.59" dur="4.8">executive privilege but I&amp;#39;d be surprised</text>
  <text start="1926.72" dur="4.62">if a court would ever release the Korean</text>

  <text start="1986.55" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;m gonna show you more but the</text>
  <text start="1988.56" dur="4.2">implications of that alone are very very</text>
  <text start="1990.48" dur="3.81">great Don jr. was never in front of in</text>

  <text start="2004.52" dur="5.25">the White House provided as witnesses to</text>
  <text start="2007.61" dur="4.44">the Moller investigation never one in</text>
  <text start="2009.77" dur="5.67">front of a grand jury to testify anyway</text>
  <text start="2012.05" dur="5.49">which would mean that if they release</text>
  <text start="2015.44" dur="3.72">the grand jury testimony there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="2017.54" dur="6.84">from anybody really close to the White</text>
  <text start="2019.16" dur="8.1">House of the president there so who was</text>
  <text start="2024.38" dur="3.81">in front of the grand jury interesting</text>
  <text start="2027.26" dur="3.72">stuff</text>
  <text start="2028.19" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re gonna go to 20 minutes in 54</text>
  <text start="2030.98" dur="5.22">seconds Byron York asks what Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2034.43" dur="4.29">like and we start to get an interesting</text>
  <text start="2036.2" dur="4.77">look into the interactions between doubt</text>
  <text start="2038.72" dur="5.04">and Muller directly including what</text>
  <text start="2040.97" dur="4.92">became the most talked-about clip from</text>
  <text start="2043.76" dur="7.41">this interview about subpoenaing the</text>
  <text start="2045.89" dur="9.12">president and this goes on for about</text>
  <text start="2051.17" dur="6.15">five or six minutes and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="2055.01" dur="4.05">thinking maybe we&amp;#39;ll go to 28 minutes</text>
  <text start="2057.32" dur="3.33">yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna play to 28 minutes</text>
  <text start="2059.06" dur="5.33">about ten minutes of interview here but</text>
  <text start="2060.65" dur="7.4">listen very closely it&amp;#39;s important and</text>
  <text start="2064.39" dur="6.7">we also know that Don McGann himself</text>
  <text start="2068.05" dur="4.63">talked to Muller for a long long time</text>
  <text start="2071.09" dur="5.61">well did you know that were you</text>
  <text start="2072.68" dur="7.17">surprised to find that out no because it</text>
  <text start="2076.7" dur="6.36">covered a lot of area yeah you think</text>
  <text start="2079.85" dur="4.8">about God&amp;#39;s position and the subjects</text>
  <text start="2083.06" dur="5.97">that they wanted to cover he killed a</text>
  <text start="2084.65" dur="11.58">lot of acreage so I was surprised but I</text>
  <text start="2089.03" dur="9.96">think I think I think home but it was</text>
  <text start="2096.23" dur="5.25">also firing because of his schedule too</text>
  <text start="2098.99" dur="4.44">so I don&amp;#39;t think they could go you know</text>
  <text start="2101.48" dur="5.04">for like a whole day with God I mean</text>
  <text start="2103.43" dur="7.02">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s still White House Counsel so I</text>
  <text start="2106.52" dur="7.94">think they broke it up to serve it was</text>
  <text start="2110.45" dur="7.92">they were always very very polite and</text>
  <text start="2114.46" dur="6.61">very generous was understanding people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2118.37" dur="6.09">schedules particularly senior members of</text>
  <text start="2121.07" dur="23.85">all the White House what was what was</text>
  <text start="2124.46" dur="26.16">Muller like almost stoic person you know</text>
  <text start="2144.92" dur="9.86">how he&amp;#39;s disciplined and focused I had I</text>
  <text start="2150.62" dur="5.6">think three or four bees with him I</text>
  <text start="2154.78" dur="4.51">[Music]</text>
  <text start="2156.22" dur="6.16">would say the first and the last for the</text>
  <text start="2159.29" dur="4.83">most animated mainly because I was I was</text>
  <text start="2162.38" dur="3.33">trying to bring it to a halt I mean</text>
  <text start="2164.12" dur="5.85">trying to end it trying to persuade him</text>
  <text start="2165.71" dur="6.63">to stop and this business of</text>
  <text start="2169.97" dur="4.17">interviewing the president gotten away</text>
  <text start="2172.34" dur="6.87">which I didn&amp;#39;t think he had any right to</text>
  <text start="2174.14" dur="9.33">do and you know I don&amp;#39;t know why but I</text>
  <text start="2179.21" dur="5.91">think ultimately agreed couldn&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="2183.47" dur="4.89">under the rule and by the way that rule</text>
  <text start="2185.12" dur="6.18">applies to you barbarism as a reporter</text>
  <text start="2188.36" dur="6.18">and planned commentator only you have</text>
  <text start="2191.3" dur="6.33">your own confidential privileges from</text>
  <text start="2194.54" dur="7.92">people you talk to and it&amp;#39;s what we call</text>
  <text start="2197.63" dur="8.85">our expanded rule 17 a privilege and</text>
  <text start="2202.46" dur="7.14">under SP you have to show that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2206.48" dur="5.49">serious crime and you know that you have</text>
  <text start="2209.6" dur="6.18">it and you could show a court in a we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2211.97" dur="5.63">got a crime here they had no crime and I</text>
  <text start="2215.78" dur="4.29">just read the paper the other day that</text>
  <text start="2217.6" dur="4.15">Marty and Jane Raskin went over there</text>
  <text start="2220.07" dur="3.9">would to Rudy and said you know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2221.75" dur="4.71">the crime because if you can&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="2223.97" dur="5.43">perd first base then you you can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="2226.46" dur="5.43">you can&amp;#39;t go any further let me have to</text>
  <text start="2229.4" dur="4.41">show no one else could answer this</text>
  <text start="2231.89" dur="4.26">question let&amp;#39;s dig into that I think I</text>
  <text start="2233.81" dur="5.28">put that to Bob for a part time is it</text>
  <text start="2236.15" dur="5.76">Bob what is the question that you have</text>
  <text start="2239.09" dur="5.71">not received an answer to what he say no</text>
  <text start="2241.91" dur="6.78">we backed off we did the 16 areas</text>
  <text start="2244.8" dur="9.39">the 49 questions etc but they were all</text>
  <text start="2248.69" dur="7.03">repetitions why real quick he asked</text>
  <text start="2254.19" dur="3.12">somewhat Muller&amp;#39;s like we get an</text>
  <text start="2255.72" dur="4.68">interesting look into the interactions</text>
  <text start="2257.31" dur="4.53">between doubt and Muller correctly they</text>
  <text start="2260.4" dur="3.39">couldn&amp;#39;t prove to the court there was</text>
  <text start="2261.84" dur="4.92">any crime so they couldn&amp;#39;t subpoena him</text>
  <text start="2263.79" dur="4.41">again Muller told him that which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2266.76" dur="2.97">gonna hear in a second every witness was</text>
  <text start="2268.2" dur="5.25">full complete and truthful meaning no</text>
  <text start="2269.73" dur="5.22">one lied and Byron is trying to get to</text>
  <text start="2273.45" dur="3.69">the root of the matter that the 49</text>
  <text start="2274.95" dur="4.11">topics the 12 the 12 topics the 49</text>
  <text start="2277.14" dur="3.93">questions what doubt is referencing is I</text>
  <text start="2279.06" dur="3.84">believe what was answered in writing and</text>
  <text start="2281.07" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re gonna get a little bit intricate</text>
  <text start="2282.9" dur="3.39">here into the the inner workings of how</text>
  <text start="2284.58" dur="4.14">things went in terms of them trying to</text>
  <text start="2286.29" dur="4.23">basically what everybody said get the</text>
  <text start="2288.72" dur="3.45">president into a perjury trap but they</text>
  <text start="2290.52" dur="3.96">had no legal grounds to stand upon</text>
  <text start="2292.17" dur="8.04">because they admitted that there was no</text>
  <text start="2294.48" dur="10.74">crime here I still think it was more</text>
  <text start="2300.21" dur="7.89">sensible practical yes to take the you</text>
  <text start="2305.22" dur="4.92">know take the notes and the interviews</text>
  <text start="2308.1" dur="4.83">with the people who took the notes which</text>
  <text start="2310.14" dur="4.2">they had done and I suggest that if you</text>
  <text start="2312.93" dur="4.26">wanted to know what was in the</text>
  <text start="2314.34" dur="6.06">president&amp;#39;s mind those are those who</text>
  <text start="2317.19" dur="6.18">knows for real time and you had very</text>
  <text start="2320.4" dur="5.52">calm you know very educated competent</text>
  <text start="2323.37" dur="4.5">witnesses who were very full of their</text>
  <text start="2325.92" dur="5.04">testimony by the way barb told me that</text>
  <text start="2327.87" dur="5.85">every witness was full complete and</text>
  <text start="2330.96" dur="10.65">truthful which has got to be a record</text>
  <text start="2333.72" dur="10.5">for any white house so I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="2341.61" dur="4.47">I didn&amp;#39;t take it I when I first asked of</text>
  <text start="2344.22" dur="4.62">why you wanted to say what a square is</text>
  <text start="2346.08" dur="4.05">corns which is the marine term I said</text>
  <text start="2348.84" dur="4.68">well this you know it&amp;#39;s public relations</text>
  <text start="2350.13" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not a good reason to</text>
  <text start="2353.52" dur="4.98">get up you the president and you know we</text>
  <text start="2356.07" dur="5.91">our discussions were wide open with them</text>
  <text start="2358.5" dur="5.76">I mean we talked about history and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2361.98" dur="5.49">a rather schedule of the president of</text>
  <text start="2364.26" dur="5.86">preparing the president but they had to</text>
  <text start="2367.47" dur="5.65">be under SB which is a good rule</text>
  <text start="2370.12" dur="5.22">this falls out of US v Nixon you know</text>
  <text start="2373.12" dur="6.3">they just cannot take the time of the</text>
  <text start="2375.34" dur="6.09">chief executive unless you have a very</text>
  <text start="2379.42" dur="4.86">good reason auntie McCarthy has written</text>
  <text start="2381.43" dur="5.37">about this extensively and other people</text>
  <text start="2384.28" dur="4.92">have too is a very very important role</text>
  <text start="2386.8" dur="5.49">so this president was also worried about</text>
  <text start="2389.2" dur="7.11">John what about the next guy 20 years</text>
  <text start="2392.29" dur="9.63">from now you know my putting him in a</text>
  <text start="2396.31" dur="7.2">position to where you know they use for</text>
  <text start="2401.92" dur="7.2">this as question when they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="2403.51" dur="10.32">good reason so that was that was about</text>
  <text start="2409.12" dur="7.17">it on that subject so he was he was</text>
  <text start="2413.83" dur="4.77">pretty hardcore though on the need to</text>
  <text start="2416.29" dur="5.13">talk to the president even as you were</text>
  <text start="2418.6" dur="5.99">making this case on SP he was still said</text>
  <text start="2421.42" dur="4.35">he needed to talk to the president right</text>
  <text start="2424.59" dur="6.01">okay</text>
  <text start="2425.77" dur="7.56">one of the things that has been a real</text>
  <text start="2430.6" dur="4.23">question in this is one Muller decided</text>
  <text start="2433.33" dur="3.66">to conclude his investigation rise</text>
  <text start="2434.83" dur="5.01">report without talking to the president</text>
  <text start="2436.99" dur="4.32">and he never he never subpoenaed the</text>
  <text start="2439.84" dur="5.16">president you know the speculation in</text>
  <text start="2441.31" dur="6.15">the press about that and so one of the</text>
  <text start="2445" dur="7.02">things is the conversation I had with</text>
  <text start="2447.46" dur="10.44">March 5th he dropped that on the table</text>
  <text start="2452.02" dur="8.85">and you know I I reacted very strongly I</text>
  <text start="2457.9" dur="5.49">said go ahead yes right there this</text>
  <text start="2460.87" dur="4.08">president was a subpoena and his</text>
  <text start="2463.39" dur="4.64">doubtful whether the office of legal</text>
  <text start="2464.95" dur="7.44">counsel would have a pool such estate</text>
  <text start="2468.03" dur="7.75">some speculate that you cannot you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2472.39" dur="4.95">have a subordinate employee a grand jury</text>
  <text start="2475.78" dur="4.14">subpoena just the president but beside</text>
  <text start="2477.34" dur="6.06">that I said well go ahead I want to hear</text>
  <text start="2479.92" dur="5.79">but you tell the court as your basis to</text>
  <text start="2483.4" dur="4.62">do it when you don&amp;#39;t have a crime you</text>
  <text start="2485.71" dur="7.05">just told me this kind of have any</text>
  <text start="2488.02" dur="6.48">exposure okay so what are you going to</text>
  <text start="2492.76" dur="4.88">tell a US district judge because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2494.5" dur="6.739">going to hook the cautiously and</text>
  <text start="2497.64" dur="5.909">Jay Sekulow his team were ready to do it</text>
  <text start="2501.239" dur="4.38">I mean it tremendous Constitution Wars</text>
  <text start="2503.549" dur="3.871">we&amp;#39;re ready to do it you want to do it</text>
  <text start="2505.619" dur="3.781">so he dropped it then he backed off he</text>
  <text start="2507.42" dur="3.8">said no don&amp;#39;t talk it upside you know</text>
  <text start="2509.4" dur="4.619">I&amp;#39;ll you know I said look</text>
  <text start="2511.22" dur="5.44">yeah what basis he has them we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2514.019" dur="4.35">afraid of a grand jury subpoena you want</text>
  <text start="2516.66" dur="3.929">to do it you&amp;#39;ve got you&amp;#39;ve got yourself</text>
  <text start="2518.369" dur="4.74">a war and you&amp;#39;re gonna lose it and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2520.589" dur="4.02">way he could win that I think he</text>
  <text start="2523.109" dur="4.051">concluded that even with all the</text>
  <text start="2524.609" dur="4.321">firepower he had on inside I think they</text>
  <text start="2527.16" dur="3.99">knew they couldn&amp;#39;t do it and I thought</text>
  <text start="2528.93" dur="4.429">that they thought they like you know</text>
  <text start="2531.15" dur="4.98">scare us he&amp;#39;ll just we&amp;#39;re not coming</text>
  <text start="2533.359" dur="5.14">they&amp;#39;re not going to go there so it</text>
  <text start="2536.13" dur="5.52">wasn&amp;#39;t something that was discussed and</text>
  <text start="2538.499" dur="6.171">of course the you know members of the</text>
  <text start="2541.65" dur="3.02">media were promoting it</text>
  <text start="2546.23" dur="7.74">so Muller says he needs to know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2550.44" dur="7.38">in the President&amp;#39;s head we&amp;#39;re again</text>
  <text start="2553.97" dur="5.8">three 518 this is all likely about</text>
  <text start="2557.82" dur="3.72">obstruction now furthering the thoughts</text>
  <text start="2559.77" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;ve had bang Gino myself and others</text>
  <text start="2561.54" dur="3.75">that this investigation was likely</text>
  <text start="2563.07" dur="4.56">wrapped up in early in terms of</text>
  <text start="2565.29" dur="4.14">collusion this is all things that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2567.63" dur="3.33">been saying lately bond Gino has been</text>
  <text start="2569.43" dur="2.91">really on top of this I got to give him</text>
  <text start="2570.96" dur="3.12">a hot tip I mean it&amp;#39;s been really fun to</text>
  <text start="2572.34" dur="3.21">listen to his show over the past week</text>
  <text start="2574.08" dur="3.57">and a half two weeks and hear this stuff</text>
  <text start="2575.55" dur="4.38">but when this first came out I said</text>
  <text start="2577.65" dur="4.38">immediately like oh goodness there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2579.93" dur="3.69">way that they were going on and on about</text>
  <text start="2582.03" dur="2.91">this it was definitely about the</text>
  <text start="2583.62" dur="2.88">obstruction and I bet the bulk of the</text>
  <text start="2584.94" dur="3.57">report is about the obstruction as well</text>
  <text start="2586.5" dur="5.94">or lack thereof there was no obstruction</text>
  <text start="2588.51" dur="5.88">but it&amp;#39;s interesting how there was sort</text>
  <text start="2592.44" dur="4.29">of a sparring going on between the</text>
  <text start="2594.39" dur="4.11">president&amp;#39;s legal team and Muller and if</text>
  <text start="2596.73" dur="4.02">you look up some of the reporting around</text>
  <text start="2598.5" dur="5.7">the time somebody leaked this this out</text>
  <text start="2600.75" dur="5.01">about this subpoena somebody did because</text>
  <text start="2604.2" dur="3.05">it was all over the news about Donald</text>
  <text start="2605.76" dur="4.11">Trump it&amp;#39;s gonna be subpoenaed by Muller</text>
  <text start="2607.25" dur="4.12">motors going to subpoena then Giuliani</text>
  <text start="2609.87" dur="3.39">was on the news talking about the</text>
  <text start="2611.37" dur="4.1">written answers and all kinds of things</text>
  <text start="2613.26" dur="4.47">and it just went crazy right around here</text>

  <text start="3630.97" dur="3.42">know they were whacked out of shape</text>
  <text start="3632.47" dur="5.51">because the president was so public and</text>
  <text start="3634.39" dur="6.42">you know they&amp;#39;re dying into some of the</text>

  <text start="3697.48" dur="3.18">Muller</text>
  <text start="3698.25" dur="5.04">thinks about this so although we do know</text>
  <text start="3700.66" dur="4.76">apparently not to reach time</text>
  <text start="3703.29" dur="3.96">one of the rules of the department</text>

  <text start="3721.98" dur="7.29">point to anything now we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="3725.85" dur="5.04">into if you guys listen to the video I</text>
  <text start="3729.27" dur="3.33">put up yesterday where I analyzed some</text>
  <text start="3730.89" dur="4.29">of president Trump&amp;#39;s interview with Sean</text>
  <text start="3732.6" dur="4.26">Hannity you&amp;#39;ll see that I talked about</text>
  <text start="3735.18" dur="3.81">the Lester Holt interview and how they</text>
  <text start="3736.86" dur="3.99">they took his words out of context and</text>
  <text start="3738.99" dur="5.43">down is gonna talk about that again</text>
  <text start="3740.85" dur="7.05">right now here and basically say at 47</text>
  <text start="3744.42" dur="6">minutes how obvious it was if you had</text>
  <text start="3747.9" dur="4.14">the full transcript which they did that</text>
  <text start="3750.42" dur="2.82">there was no such thing as obstruction</text>
  <text start="3752.04" dur="2.58">when it came to that and that all you</text>
  <text start="3753.24" dur="3.09">needed to do was listen to it and that</text>
  <text start="3754.62" dur="7.16">the media went off with it and and</text>
  <text start="3756.33" dur="8.25">mischaracterized what was being said I</text>
  <text start="3761.78" dur="5.89">forego babies you have to break the hold</text>
  <text start="3764.58" dur="6.12">interview down and that&amp;#39;s what the media</text>
  <text start="3767.67" dur="5.61">says it said he&amp;#39;s not what he said but</text>
  <text start="3770.7" dur="5.55">you have to read it carefully as to why</text>
  <text start="3773.28" dur="5.01">he looked why he let it go but it</text>
  <text start="3776.25" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t matter I mean he could say I</text>
  <text start="3778.29" dur="5.79">don&amp;#39;t like the way he parted his hair he</text>
  <text start="3780.78" dur="6">could fire him so but the worst of all</text>
  <text start="3784.08" dur="6.74">interview just has to be read carefully</text>
  <text start="3786.78" dur="7.2">I haven&amp;#39;t got it in front of me so I can</text>
  <text start="3790.82" dur="7.45">recited to you but it was not difficult</text>
  <text start="3793.98" dur="8.22">to support which we did in several</text>
  <text start="3798.27" dur="5.97">letters too so you and the special</text>
  <text start="3802.2" dur="7.02">counsels office went back and forth</text>
  <text start="3804.24" dur="10.29">about the Lester Holt interview there</text>
  <text start="3809.22" dur="9.51">was I can recall a couple of discussions</text>
  <text start="3814.53" dur="6.41">and we we we then gave a letter laying</text>
  <text start="3818.73" dur="5.19">it out and taking it apart gave him the</text>
  <text start="3820.94" dur="5.08">entire transcript the media was running</text>
  <text start="3823.92" dur="3.69">with just a partial they weren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="3826.02" dur="5.46">weren&amp;#39;t running the whole and if you</text>
  <text start="3827.61" dur="6.39">read the whole it&amp;#39;s clear you know so</text>
  <text start="3831.48" dur="3.49">the president wasn&amp;#39;t firing because in</text>
  <text start="3834" dur="2.17">Russia well I could</text>
  <text start="3834.97" dur="3.12">understand the media going off</text>
  <text start="3836.17" dur="3.84">half-cocked but what I&amp;#39;m trying to guess</text>
  <text start="3838.09" dur="4.23">figure out I guess is did the Muller</text>
  <text start="3840.01" dur="5.91">people believe that the Lester Holt</text>
  <text start="3842.32" dur="6.9">interview in toto showed the president</text>
  <text start="3845.92" dur="5.73">trying to obstruct come on</text>
  <text start="3849.22" dur="5.01">okay so that was ultimately not in your</text>
  <text start="3851.65" dur="7.32">view a big problem with the with the</text>
  <text start="3854.23" dur="6.48">Mahler people Muller didn&amp;#39;t really care</text>
  <text start="3858.97" dur="5.27">about the Lester Holt interview in terms</text>
  <text start="3860.71" dur="5.88">of obstruction as per John Dowd now</text>

  <text start="4166.19" dur="3.69">ever asked rod Rosen Stein where this</text>
  <text start="4167.99" dur="4.17">idea to appoint a special counsel even</text>
  <text start="4169.88" dur="4.44">came from to this day nobody asks them</text>
  <text start="4172.16" dur="4.17">now there&amp;#39;s two different options here</text>
  <text start="4174.32" dur="4.14">Roger Rosen Stein went behind the</text>
  <text start="4176.33" dur="3.9">president&amp;#39;s back and worked with Jim</text>
  <text start="4178.46" dur="4.59">Comey to appoint a special counsel to</text>

  <text start="4183.05" dur="4.08">them were in that meeting talking about</text>
  <text start="4184.67" dur="4.11">something and then there was a special</text>
  <text start="4187.13" dur="7.29">counsel investigation launched it is</text>
  <text start="4188.78" dur="7.44">still a great area hearing Dowd talk</text>
  <text start="4194.42" dur="3.09">about how Jeff Sessions was sitting</text>
  <text start="4196.22" dur="3.06">there and immediately offered his</text>
  <text start="4197.51" dur="3.75">resignation because he had no idea this</text>
  <text start="4199.28" dur="3.81">was going on everybody was basically</text>
  <text start="4201.26" dur="3.02">gobsmacked by the fact that there was</text>
  <text start="4203.09" dur="3.72">gonna be a Special Counsel investigation</text>
  <text start="4204.28" dur="5.14">none of the normal official channels</text>
  <text start="4206.81" dur="4.98">were fought were followed in terms of</text>
  <text start="4209.42" dur="3.66">you know letting people know that there</text>
  <text start="4211.79" dur="2.94">was gonna be a special counsel or</text>
  <text start="4213.08" dur="4.23">anything like that none of that happened</text>
  <text start="4214.73" dur="4.8">none of it I would suggest that</text>
  <text start="4217.31" dur="4.35">everybody rewind that because I did I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4219.53" dur="4.5">listened to that section four times now</text>
  <text start="4221.66" dur="4.59">it is stunning</text>
  <text start="4224.03" dur="3.84">to this day nobody&amp;#39;s asked rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="4226.25" dur="3.48">Stein why he started a special council</text>
  <text start="4227.87" dur="2.52">investigation there was no crime we</text>
  <text start="4229.73" dur="2.4">don&amp;#39;t know if it was a</text>
  <text start="4230.39" dur="4.29">counterintelligence investigation or a</text>
  <text start="4232.13" dur="5.18">criminal investigation and his memo or a</text>
  <text start="4234.68" dur="6.12">scope memo doesn&amp;#39;t outline it either</text>
  <text start="4237.31" dur="5.92">where was the allegation of a crime I am</text>
  <text start="4240.8" dur="4.38">just not even going to lend my</text>
  <text start="4243.23" dur="5.19">perspective on which two of those</text>
  <text start="4245.18" dur="8.07">scenarios I think are more likely I just</text>
  <text start="4248.42" dur="6.18">don&amp;#39;t all we could do is take all this</text>
  <text start="4253.25" dur="4.2">data put it together and come up with</text>
  <text start="4254.6" dur="4.83">her own conclusions so I&amp;#39;m not a fan of</text>
  <text start="4257.45" dur="3.93">rod Rosen Stein I you know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="4259.43" dur="6.81">of people who are fans of him I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="4261.38" dur="6.33">not one of those people so that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="4266.24" dur="2.82">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s a bad guy he</text>
  <text start="4267.71" dur="3.78">could have been doing some good stuff</text>
  <text start="4269.06" dur="3.96">behind the scenes this entire time you</text>
  <text start="4271.49" dur="4.02">know people will argue with me that Dana</text>
  <text start="4273.02" dur="3.99">boned a sign defies a renewal too and</text>
  <text start="4275.51" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ll say yeah and I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="4277.01" dur="3.72">greatest of guys either and I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4279.41" dur="7.74">it&amp;#39;s just my opinion</text>
  <text start="4280.73" dur="10.23">I mean it&amp;#39;s raining two more segments</text>
  <text start="4287.15" dur="8.66">here actually we&amp;#39;re just going to do one</text>
  <text start="4290.96" dur="9.35">at 57 minutes another sort of flag on</text>
  <text start="4295.81" dur="10.33">Rosenstein steam Frankenstein steam</text>
  <text start="4300.31" dur="9.79">somebody gave me that you mentioned very</text>
  <text start="4306.14" dur="6.96">briefly a FISA situation and you know</text>
  <text start="4310.1" dur="4.8">how what a huge role in terms of the</text>
  <text start="4313.1" dur="5.4">public discussion of the Trump Russia</text>
  <text start="4314.9" dur="5.49">affair that the whole dossier play has</text>
  <text start="4318.5" dur="3.72">played in this public debate and the FBI</text>
  <text start="4320.39" dur="4.8">certainly made a big deal of it and and</text>
  <text start="4322.22" dur="8.85">James Comey briefed the president-elect</text>
  <text start="4325.19" dur="8.13">on it in January 2017 and did you have</text>
  <text start="4331.07" dur="4.47">ever had the impression that the Muller</text>
  <text start="4333.32" dur="4.65">people were investigating these</text>
  <text start="4335.54" dur="7.52">allegations in the dossier or that they</text>
  <text start="4337.97" dur="9.39">had reached any conclusions about them I</text>
  <text start="4343.06" dur="7.54">didn&amp;#39;t know one way or another but I had</text>
  <text start="4347.36" dur="7.74">and Mike Bowie and I had incasa was</text>
  <text start="4350.6" dur="6.08">wrote a letter to Bob to investigate</text>
  <text start="4355.1" dur="7.25">Tony and</text>
  <text start="4356.68" dur="7.83">his preterius testimony before in our</text>
  <text start="4362.35" dur="5.58">opinion his false false testimony before</text>
  <text start="4364.51" dur="6.33">the Senate Intelligence and traditionary</text>
  <text start="4367.93" dur="6.09">committees and that and that it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="4370.84" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s just his whole bizarre conduct I</text>
  <text start="4374.02" dur="4.98">mean in my experience of my lifetime</text>
  <text start="4376.18" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;ve dealt with a lot of directors FBI</text>
  <text start="4379" dur="6.87">and senior officials department justice</text>
  <text start="4381.91" dur="9.18">I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything attend to what</text>
  <text start="4385.87" dur="6.54">was going on with Coley Gates it just</text>
  <text start="4391.09" dur="11.16">didn&amp;#39;t look like the Department of</text>
  <text start="4392.41" dur="11.49">Justice to me and and I or the dossier I</text>
  <text start="4402.25" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t know what they would have gotten</text>
  <text start="4403.9" dur="7.32">to it but what alarmed me was that he</text>
  <text start="4407.68" dur="5.34">was not investigating call me and I</text>
  <text start="4411.22" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t understand that in every</text>
  <text start="4413.02" dur="5.16">investigation that I&amp;#39;ve had the apply</text>
  <text start="4415.72" dur="5.37">your came to me and was an accuser or</text>
  <text start="4418.18" dur="4.98">made witness you know I would not all</text>
  <text start="4421.09" dur="4.47">the interview several times but I&amp;#39;d find</text>
  <text start="4423.16" dur="4.32">out everything I could about you taking</text>
  <text start="4425.56" dur="4.23">up you know if I gotta use as a witness</text>
  <text start="4427.48" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;ve got to make sure you know you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4429.79" dur="5.94">have any clacey or any problems etc so</text>
  <text start="4432.25" dur="6.57">it was calming to presenting himself as</text>
  <text start="4435.73" dur="4.86">the main accuser and pushing the person</text>
  <text start="4438.82" dur="4.65">pushing other people but hurt his</text>
  <text start="4440.59" dur="4.71">presence I don&amp;#39;t understand why more</text>
  <text start="4443.47" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t take a look at him and I took it</text>
  <text start="4445.3" dur="5.58">up the Rosenstein and they didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="4447.79" dur="6.69">just blew it on you mean you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4450.88" dur="6.12">suggesting rosen sky I don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="4454.48" dur="5.58">I don&amp;#39;t understand Rosenstein at all I</text>
  <text start="4457" dur="6.66">just thought I mean he was good if</text>
  <text start="4460.06" dur="6.27">anybody you know the chief witness for</text>
  <text start="4463.66" dur="3.36">the defense or the instruction case with</text>

  <text start="4470.53" dur="5.58">call me and that&amp;#39;s what President did so</text>

  <text start="4496.66" dur="3.12">me call me Zout in the media saying this</text>
  <text start="4498.25" dur="3.09">was happened because of me I thought</text>
  <text start="4499.78" dur="3.51">that this would spur on the appointment</text>
  <text start="4501.34" dur="4.98">of a special counsel Muller doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="4503.29" dur="6.39">talk to him at least that Dowd knows of</text>
  <text start="4506.32" dur="7.22">and I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;d know unless he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
