  <text start="46.559" dur="5.82">all of that for you and put together a</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="6.209">nice round unbiased piece about this man</text>

  <text start="56.85" dur="5.549">at least a good idea of what he&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="59.37" dur="4.98">about and then also you have a reference</text>
  <text start="62.399" dur="4.65">point to start your own research from</text>
  <text start="64.35" dur="4.74">before that day I don&amp;#39;t want to go off</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="4.621">of what other people say I started this</text>
  <text start="69.09" dur="4.29">out from a very clean slate so where am</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="4.8">I going with this video where am I going</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="8.989">with it well I&amp;#39;ll tell you do you guys</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="5.899">remember back in November that rhymes</text>
  <text start="83.119" dur="8.741">back in November I did a thread about</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="5.7">Julian Assange and that indictment that</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="8.49">came out so long story short Julian</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="7.68">Assange was basically they filed papers</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="4.71">in a case and somebody who was reading</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="5.28">that case noticed that they accidentally</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="6.72">included a page with information about</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="6.18">Assange inside of it and it was making</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="4.439">the case for why Julian Assange&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.44">indictment should be sealed and this</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="3.241">came out and everybody freaked out and</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="2.61">it was a huge mistake I&amp;#39;m just gonna go</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="3.449">through the threat for you guys really</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="4.409">quickly Julian Assange supposedly</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="4.231">indicted someone working on a motion to</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="3.78">seal in an unrelated case accidentally</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.75">slipped in language about Assange and</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="3.931">Assange indictment as a bullet point</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="5.67">huge mistake and here</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="5.16">it was filed on August 22nd 2018 let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="5.49">see what was in the news around this</text>
  <text start="137.85" dur="6.42">time and I find that he&amp;#39;s considering to</text>
  <text start="142.05" dur="3.81">testify before the Senate and all kinds</text>
  <text start="144.27" dur="2.7">of things like that and then I say now</text>
  <text start="145.86" dur="2.49">let&amp;#39;s take a look at where this could</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="3.09">have come from I&amp;#39;m uploading a video</text>
  <text start="148.35" dur="3.93">that demonstrates how the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="150.06" dur="4.47">has argued strongly for WikiLeaks right</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="3.42">to publish and civil litigation I have a</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="3.15">hard time believing this would be a</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="4.14">trump sanctioned thing call me crazy</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.22">and then I talked about the case in</text>
  <text start="159.84" dur="4.95">which Trump&amp;#39;s attorneys argue in favor</text>
  <text start="162.9" dur="4.2">of WikiLeaks First Amendment protections</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.23">to publish the case was ultimately</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="3.75">dismissed without prejudice on those</text>
  <text start="169.02" dur="3.36">very jurisdictional issues which are in</text>
  <text start="170.85" dur="3.3">here but that isn&amp;#39;t the point it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="3.84">seem to me that Trump would be actively</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="4.35">looking to prosecute Assange while also</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="4.14">supporting his right to publish there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="3.24">a line in there about actions that cause</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="7.95">state harm in extraordinary</text>
  <text start="181.74" dur="8.91">circumstances and I just go through some</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="4.08">background on and I apologize so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="4.38">what I think is more likely note who</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="7.26">signed the government&amp;#39;s motion z-g</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="7.23">Zachary terwilliger Terwilliger and if</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="4.23">you guys remember during my video I was</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="3.36">pronouncing it wrong and I tried to</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="3.84">bring it up on like Google you know</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="5.07">pretend pronunciation and it became a</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="4.5">running joke and in the comments you</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="3.47">guys were all explaining to me how to</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="5.61">say it like this one person here says</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="5.46">Terwilliger to her Williger I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="217.83" dur="2.97">why I have such a hard time with it</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="5.86">anyway</text>
  <text start="220.8" dur="6.3">back to the thread so this name because</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="3.33">I had such a hard time pronouncing it</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="4.68">stuck in my head let&amp;#39;s go through the</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="5.19">thread more terwilliger I did it was</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="4.38">appointed by Trump July 13th confirmed</text>
  <text start="234" dur="4.01">in August and formally confirmed just</text>
  <text start="236.16" dur="4.74">this November 9th</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="4.75">terwilliger nominated as US attorney for</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="4.46">high-profile Eastern Virginia district</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="5.46">and then I put the confirmation here</text>
  <text start="245.36" dur="8.95">terwilliger formally formally installed</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="8.25">as US attorney in Virginia previously he</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="3.929">served as a top adviser to Rosenstein in</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="3.449">his remarks he noted he also helped</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="3.87">Shepard Rosen Stein&amp;#39;s confirmation</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="4.25">through the Senate now why is this</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="2.06">interesting</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="4.69">Terwilliger also drew laughs as he noted</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="3.18">that Rosenstein now a lightning rod for</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="3.06">critics of Special Counsel Robert</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="7.35">Mueller&amp;#39;s Russian investigation was</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="7.29">confirmed easily that&amp;#39;s great but who is</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="3.15">that and then I say who is the US</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="4.77">attorney who actually signs the motion</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="4.56">and it&amp;#39;s Dwyer and then I go into stuff</text>
  <text start="285.74" dur="4.74">about that but that&amp;#39;s not important in</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="3.98">this what&amp;#39;s important in this is a few</text>
  <text start="290.48" dur="3.48">things</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="4.84">Terwilliger his connection to Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="4.17">Rosenstein very close if you guys</text>
  <text start="296.03" dur="4.05">remember yesterday we got news that</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="3.96">rosen Stein was gonna step down when</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="3.96">Barr became the AG and then of course</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="4.68">fudge drool in full effect I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="304.04" dur="4.379">mention a word about it Rosen Stein came</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="3.57">out and walked that back later on in the</text>
  <text start="308.419" dur="5.881">day and I believed him and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="5.91">explain to you why I&amp;#39;m doing all this</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="3.78">research on Barr as you can see I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="4.05">reading his opinions I&amp;#39;m trying to get</text>
  <text start="318.08" dur="4.29">an idea of how his mind works I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="3.81">research into iran-contra which pardons</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="3.66">was he actually responsible for all</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="3.69">kinds of stuff right but one of the</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="3.33">documents that&amp;#39;s taken me a very long</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="4.23">time to get through is this presidential</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="5.79">oral history interview that was given by</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="5.37">UVA Miller center as you can see I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="4.44">here and we still have all of this to go</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="3.75">down here but I just came across this</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="4.829">and I wanted to bring it to you guys</text>
  <text start="341.15" dur="5.01">quickly I was up on the hill bar says</text>
  <text start="344.419" dur="4.021">talking to the House Republican caucus</text>
  <text start="346.16" dur="3.78">and I got a call that the president</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="3.45">wanted to see me before a cabinet</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="4.02">meeting but I couldn&amp;#39;t get down there in</text>
  <text start="351.89" dur="4.649">time it turned out I got down for the</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="4.05">cabinet meeting and Sununu said quote he</text>
  <text start="356.539" dur="4.081">wants to see you after the cabinet</text>
  <text start="358.01" dur="3.9">meeting this is it Sununu I think could</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="3.33">be interested in helping me become</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="3.75">Attorney General so at the end of the</text>
  <text start="363.95" dur="3.779">cabinet meeting I went in and Sununu</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="3.9">said okay he&amp;#39;s going to offer you the</text>
  <text start="367.729" dur="4.021">Attorney General position but you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="3.6">a very high-profile political guy so</text>
  <text start="371.75" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re not getting much political mileage</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="3.9">out of putting you there so we may want</text>
  <text start="375.41" dur="3.69">to name your deputy someone we could get</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="5.01">some political benefit from is that a</text>
  <text start="379.1" dur="5.46">problem with you so your Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="382.07" dur="6.599">General is a very important person in</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="5.79">terms of appointment Bush is saying</text>
  <text start="388.669" dur="2.911">you&amp;#39;re not a high profile political guy</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="2.58">I&amp;#39;m not going to gain any political</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="4.41">capital so I want to use a political</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="4.41">tool in the deputy to spot and Barr says</text>

  <text start="583.66" dur="9.08">think that Rosen Stein will stay on</text>
  <text start="585.339" dur="7.401">board because there&amp;#39;s connections here</text>
  <text start="593.01" dur="5.92">there&amp;#39;s connections here and the more I</text>
  <text start="596.56" dur="4.2">research this the more disgusting I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="3.21">starting to feel about the whole thing</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;m trying to give it to your unbiased</text>
  <text start="602.14" dur="3.12">so I&amp;#39;m gonna give you the good the bad</text>
  <text start="603.85" dur="3.15">and the ugly look there&amp;#39;s some good</text>
  <text start="605.26" dur="4.62">stuff I mean there&amp;#39;s some good stuff out</text>
  <text start="607" dur="5.01">of him he&amp;#39;s not just a complete you know</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="4.35">you he&amp;#39;s very smart and his positions on</text>
  <text start="612.01" dur="4.35">things are very very well defined and</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="5.37">well known as a matter of fact I still</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="6.15">have to get through reading his last</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="4.26">confirmation hearing so again I know I</text>
  <text start="622.51" dur="4.44">haven&amp;#39;t had a video out in a couple days</text>
  <text start="623.86" dur="5.729">but like legitimately it has been days</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="5.16">of me just reading and consuming as much</text>
  <text start="629.589" dur="6.601">as I could possibly consume about him</text>
  <text start="632.11" dur="7.56">from the conspiracy crazy theories some</text>
  <text start="636.19" dur="5.639">of which are true to the mundane policy</text>
  <text start="639.67" dur="4.14">opinions written while at the Department</text>
  <text start="641.829" dur="4.711">of Justice I I mean I&amp;#39;m really trying</text>
  <text start="643.81" dur="7.529">hard here to give give everybody a very</text>
  <text start="646.54" dur="6.75">round view of this man I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.339" dur="4.321">really interesting though the Rosen</text>
  <text start="653.29" dur="5.52">Stein rumors and how this all rolled out</text>
  <text start="655.66" dur="6.27">but anyway anywho ten minutes and 56</text>
  <text start="658.81" dur="4.68">seconds maybe I&amp;#39;ll give you one more one</text>
  <text start="661.93" dur="2.49">a little tidbit I&amp;#39;m gonna put it in the</text>
  <text start="663.49" dur="4.74">big video too</text>
  <text start="664.42" dur="5.84">but there are stand-alones here maybe</text>
  <text start="668.23" dur="6.8">I&amp;#39;ll give you one more hold on</text>
  <text start="670.26" dur="7.45">you know how in history it&amp;#39;s like you</text>
  <text start="675.03" dur="4.06">you know one action feeds another action</text>
  <text start="677.71" dur="6.24">feeds another action feeds another</text>
  <text start="679.09" dur="7.44">action interestingly enough that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="683.95" dur="6.03">case here too and I found this super</text>
  <text start="686.53" dur="6.12">super like intriguing for many reasons</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="4.5">like if it weren&amp;#39;t for bar this never</text>
  <text start="692.65" dur="3.6">would have happened and we&amp;#39;re gonna not</text>
  <text start="694.48" dur="2.18">at least not this way so let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="696.25" dur="2.88">it</text>
  <text start="696.66" dur="4.12">young one of the interview says could</text>
  <text start="699.13" dur="4.29">you talk a little bit about how much you</text>
  <text start="700.78" dur="5.22">were involved with you know appointing</text>
  <text start="703.42" dur="4.11">justices talking about circuit judges</text>
  <text start="706" dur="4.44">and stuff like what Trump is -</text>
  <text start="707.53" dur="4.77">attempting to finish now and bar says</text>
  <text start="710.44" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s a very important function and I</text>
  <text start="712.3" dur="3.09">think President Bush had a firm view of</text>
  <text start="714.04" dur="2.73">putting good judges on the court who</text>
  <text start="715.39" dur="3.75">reflected his philosophy and our</text>
  <text start="716.77" dur="3.72">philosophy but I personally didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="719.14" dur="2.85">involved in it too much because it was</text>
  <text start="720.49" dur="3.39">so time-consuming and he had to be able</text>
  <text start="721.99" dur="4.77">to help people so much I basically let</text>
  <text start="723.88" dur="4.62">others do it apart from the Supreme</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="4.23">Court which hands is handled differently</text>
  <text start="728.5" dur="5.76">on other appointments for example and in</text>
  <text start="730.99" dur="6.87">New York we had this deal incidentally</text>
  <text start="734.26" dur="6.2">before I go on bar bar was responsible</text>
  <text start="737.86" dur="4.92">for putting forth Clarence Thomas anyway</text>
  <text start="740.46" dur="3.79">apart from the Supreme Court which is</text>
  <text start="742.78" dur="3.42">handled in a different way on other</text>
  <text start="744.25" dur="3.87">appointments in New York we had this</text>
  <text start="746.2" dur="3.69">deal where the Democrat gets to name one</text>
  <text start="748.12" dur="4.56">out of every three or something like</text>
  <text start="749.89" dur="4.98">that isn&amp;#39;t that sick they have deals to</text>
  <text start="752.68" dur="3.99">name judges we were requesting that each</text>
  <text start="754.87" dur="4.14">member of Congress give us three names</text>
  <text start="756.67" dur="4.08">for every position we were saying that</text>
  <text start="759.01" dur="3.21">they couldn&amp;#39;t dictate a particular</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="4.44">candidate they had to come up with three</text>
  <text start="762.22" dur="4.44">names and then we would choose now most</text>
  <text start="765.19" dur="3.48">people complied with that but there were</text>
  <text start="766.66" dur="3.78">a few who tried to dictate exactly who</text>
  <text start="768.67" dur="4.05">was gonna get it Daniel Patrick Moynihan</text>
  <text start="770.44" dur="4.35">came up with two names for two slots</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="4.05">somehow he had a sense he was entitled</text>
  <text start="774.79" dur="5.03">to propose to people so he had submitted</text>
  <text start="776.77" dur="5.67">two names he put a hold on all judicial</text>
  <text start="779.82" dur="4.21">confirmations for weeks and weeks no</text>
  <text start="782.44" dur="3.69">judicial confirmations were being done</text>
  <text start="784.03" dur="4.14">because he wanted his two people of</text>
  <text start="786.13" dur="3.93">course it reached an impasse and this is</text>
  <text start="788.17" dur="4.77">when I was AG and I said okay I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="790.06" dur="4.5">interview his candidates directly so I</text>
  <text start="792.94" dur="3.36">interviewed both of these people he was</text>
  <text start="794.56" dur="3.209">insisting upon and I picked the one that</text>
  <text start="796.3" dur="4.319">I thought hey we could</text>
  <text start="797.769" dur="5.61">with this one it was Sonia Sotomayor</text>
  <text start="800.619" dur="5.94">who&amp;#39;s now on the second circuit this was</text>
  <text start="803.379" dur="4.62">for a district court I said okay we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="806.559" dur="3.301">tell you what we&amp;#39;ll do we&amp;#39;ll do Sonia</text>
  <text start="807.999" dur="3.63">Sotomayor but not the other one the</text>
  <text start="809.86" dur="3.839">other one was just one we couldn&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="811.629" dur="3.96">on from our perspective</text>
  <text start="813.699" dur="5.69">I broke the logjam that way but we lost</text>
  <text start="815.589" dur="7.1">weeks and weeks with this kind of in</text>
  <text start="819.389" dur="6.461">other words if it weren&amp;#39;t for bar</text>
  <text start="822.689" dur="5.911">picking Sotomayor from those two that</text>
  <text start="825.85" dur="5.519">Moynihan put in front of him she likely</text>
  <text start="828.6" dur="7.049">probably may not have made it to Supreme</text>
  <text start="831.369" dur="10.95">Court justice amazing anyway am i dork</text>
