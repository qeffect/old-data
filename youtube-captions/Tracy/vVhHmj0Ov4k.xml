  <text start="93.09" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;ve been on over the past couple days</text>
  <text start="94.729" dur="6.221">which is that John Durham was doing a</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="5.939">criminal investigation a year at least</text>

  <text start="123.42" dur="6.05">all on the web site uncovered ec calm</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="5.04">and then there&amp;#39;s a whole media section</text>
  <text start="129.47" dur="3.909">I&amp;#39;ve been doing interviews about the</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="2.37">general Flynn case because it is</text>
  <text start="133.379" dur="3.181">something</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="6.06">that I have studied very closely as well</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="5.61">as the story that I broke about William</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="5.31">Taylor being connected to George Soros</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="4.14">in Ukraine and we&amp;#39;re gonna take a look</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="4.11">at a whole bunch of other stuff as well</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="5.46">but I wanted to first talk about the</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="7.67">Flynn case general Flynn&amp;#39;s case now I</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="8.4">know that I&amp;#39;ve done this several several</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="4.78">reviews of this where I&amp;#39;ve gone over</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="3.78">what happened and what had happened I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="5.4">done on the podcast several times too so</text>
  <text start="163.95" dur="5.52">I just want to start the calendar from</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="7.8">when Sidney Powell the amazing</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="7.65">powerhouse attorney just did her filing</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="4.65">her first filing where she asked for the</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="4.89">Brady material that she claims she</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="4.29">wasn&amp;#39;t provided so she puts a filing out</text>
  <text start="182.01" dur="4.98">where there&amp;#39;s a list of I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s probably like 45 or so things that</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="5.07">she wants that the government hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="5.85">given her or Flynn or general Flynn and</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="4.71">so the government responds by the</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="4.04">deadline and says we&amp;#39;re not giving you</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="3.689">any of that stuff you don&amp;#39;t deserve it</text>
  <text start="198.77" dur="3.91">you pled guilty</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="5.221">I want you pled guilty you no longer</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="5.76">have claim to this besides we already</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="5.55">showed you guys everything you needed to</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="6.09">see before general Flynn pled guilty and</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="4.2">you just didn&amp;#39;t you didn&amp;#39;t care you you</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="3.29">know you didn&amp;#39;t take it into</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="5.25">consideration whatever and supposedly</text>
  <text start="217.82" dur="5.08">they had showed general Flynn and his</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="6.96">counsel the text messages from Peter</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="9.6">struck and Lisa page and those text</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="7.98">messages showed the bias between you</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="7.8">know struck and page now listen here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="6.63">the deal in this I don&amp;#39;t want to skip</text>
  <text start="240.3" dur="3.6">ahead but in this latest filing mrs.</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="4.26">Powell saying that that never happened</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="4.74">if you remember the government bragged</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.29">about how they provided twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="248.64" dur="4.56">pages of information to counsel and</text>
  <text start="250.8" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s extensive the Brady</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="4.14">production will newest flash when you</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="4.65">provide twenty thousand pages to</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="4.079">somebody nine times out of ten it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="3.06">because you&amp;#39;re trying to give them</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="4.201">everything it&amp;#39;s because you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="4.5">give them everything that doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="5.37">so that they are</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="5.07">down in this overwhelming document</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="6.02">production and can&amp;#39;t find things that</text>
  <text start="272.67" dur="9.81">they need typical tactic in discovery</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="7.93">Oren Brady even and so the government</text>
  <text start="282.48" dur="4.77">responds and says Oh too bad so sad</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="5.7">you&amp;#39;re not allowed to have any of that</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="7.41">stuff sorry that ship has sailed you are</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="6.06">just completely out of luck and then a</text>
  <text start="294.66" dur="5.07">couple days went by and Sydney Powell</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="5.34">gets to respond and she does and when</text>
  <text start="299.73" dur="4.02">she does she responds with all of the</text>
  <text start="302.04" dur="4.83">bombshell new information that we</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="6.57">covered in our thread the other day let</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="6.53">me see which I know I&amp;#39;m on the right</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="7.79">track with because I was honored that</text>
  <text start="313.4" dur="7.15">mrs. Powell herself retweeted it so um</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="4.9">I&amp;#39;m just gonna look for it right now but</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="5.91">there was a halt here though there was a</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="5.01">an entirely it was stunning this this</text>
  <text start="326.46" dur="3.45">brief was stunning there was so much</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="6.21">information in here we learned so many</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="7.76">things we learned that the 302s were</text>
  <text start="334.23" dur="5.91">edited now very carefully here because</text>
  <text start="337.67" dur="5.13">Sydney Powell&amp;#39;s not asserting that it</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="7.38">was Lisa page who changed the context of</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="6.91">these 302s it was Lisa page who texted</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="3.72">Peter struck and recently obtained text</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="3.57">messages that had not been available</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="5.4">previously and were not provided by the</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="7.65">government it was it was uncovered that</text>
  <text start="356.64" dur="6.99">Lisa page did in fact edit the 302s of</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="4.89">Peter struck because she was asked to do</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="3.81">it by Peter struck Sydney Powell doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="3.96">make the claim that she edited it to</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="4.92">take the words out to change the context</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="5.04">to change the meaning she just says Lisa</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="6.2">page is admitting to editing these in</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="5.97">this filing there is a massive</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="3.7">attachment section where there are</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="4.11">several attachments one of the</text>
  <text start="382.26" dur="6.27">attachments is a 302 from an interview</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="5.97">in October of 2018 where Lisa page is</text>
  <text start="388.53" dur="4.95">being interviewed about this and she</text>
  <text start="390.87" dur="3.96">pretends that she has well she says she</text>
  <text start="393.48" dur="2.67">doesn&amp;#39;t remember doing anything like</text>
  <text start="394.83" dur="3.12">that she&amp;#39;s confronted with the</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="3.36">information and Sheeran eggs and says oh</text>
  <text start="397.95" dur="3.39">yeah it was probably just for Grammer</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="4.59">and blah blah blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="4.89">I found more telling was that in 2018 in</text>
  <text start="404.1" dur="4.59">October she was being interviewed by the</text>
  <text start="406.23" dur="4.89">FBI and there&amp;#39;s a documented 302 of her</text>
  <text start="408.69" dur="6.21">interview so that was something for me</text>
  <text start="411.12" dur="5.64">to keep in mind outside of that the</text>
  <text start="414.9" dur="5.19">claim is made in this filing by Miss</text>
  <text start="416.76" dur="6.3">Powell who asks the court to dismiss the</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="4.35">charges outright and also to hold these</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="4.5">attorneys from the government in</text>
  <text start="424.44" dur="5.4">criminal contempt of court that the memo</text>
  <text start="427.56" dur="3.93">that Andrew McCabe claims to you know he</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="4.68">wrote a memo after he got off the phone</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="4.679">with general Flynn asking for the FBI</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="3.81">agents to come over and interview him</text>
  <text start="436.169" dur="4.651">this is the same meeting that James</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="5.899">Comey bragged about on television which</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="6.75">is also included in this filing as well</text>
  <text start="444.229" dur="4.841">when that happens Andrew McCabe writes a</text>
  <text start="447.57" dur="6.659">memo as soon as he gets off the phone</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="8.67">and in his memo he tells whoever&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="454.229" dur="4.861">be reading these things that he had told</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="2.28">general Flynn that he doesn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="2.4">worry about getting the White House</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="3">Counsel involved it&amp;#39;s not gonna be all</text>
  <text start="461.49" dur="4.41">that serious it&amp;#39;s just gonna be a quick</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="4.47">phone call or an interview well what</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="5.76">Sidney Powell&amp;#39;s saying is that that</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="7.08">never happened he was lying lying in</text>
  <text start="471.66" dur="8.43">that memo he was lying</text>
  <text start="474.57" dur="8.219">I&amp;#39;m not surprised actually I&amp;#39;m color me</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="5.85">shocked would be sarcasm but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.789" dur="5.671">another thing so not only did that not</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="5.52">happen but again general Flynn was</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="5.73">completely entrapped into this interview</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="4.74">when Peter struck and the other agent</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="4.38">who we know is Joseph piensa who was</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="5.31">also involved in the mid-year exam as</text>
  <text start="498.57" dur="4.62">well as the he was the handler I believe</text>
  <text start="501.51" dur="3.779">for Bruce or dealing with Christopher</text>
  <text start="503.19" dur="4.5">Steele so his name is still being</text>
  <text start="505.289" dur="4.5">redacted from all of this stuff when</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="3.96">they took their notes of the interview</text>
  <text start="509.789" dur="3.541">with general Flynn the notes said we</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t think that he&amp;#39;s lying we you know</text>
  <text start="513.33" dur="4.23">we have the notes now they&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="514.74" dur="4.919">filing we can look at them they say he</text>
  <text start="517.56" dur="5.49">doesn&amp;#39;t remember calling three or four</text>
  <text start="519.659" dur="7.321">times to kiss lyac they&amp;#39;re very clear</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="8.43">and they&amp;#39;re handwritten and then the</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="7.17">3:02 say that he denies calling kis lyac</text>
  <text start="531.48" dur="3.51">three or four times complete material</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="3.6">change</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="4.83">in what general Flynn said to the agents</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="4.73">because we know because the agents wrote</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="5.55">this down in handwriting at the time</text>
  <text start="542.48" dur="4.63">completely different than what they said</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="4.71">in their original handwritten notes and</text>
  <text start="547.11" dur="5.36">ended up in the 302s that the FBI uses</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="4.77">as an official record now</text>
  <text start="552.47" dur="4.45">Sidney Powell brought on a handwriting</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="4.02">expert to be able to take a look at</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="3.71">these handwritten notes to see when they</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="4.02">possibly were written who wrote them</text>
  <text start="560.63" dur="4.06">whether or not there were things added</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="5.34">on to them after the fact by looking at</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="5.31">the ink etc that was inconclusive and</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s also attached to the filing only</text>
  <text start="570" dur="7.26">because they didn&amp;#39;t have another</text>
  <text start="572.39" dur="9.79">handwriting sample to be able to to be</text>
  <text start="577.26" dur="6.72">able to compare to so hold on there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.18" dur="6.12">something going on here in the comments</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="5.37">on YouTube apparently I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m</text>
