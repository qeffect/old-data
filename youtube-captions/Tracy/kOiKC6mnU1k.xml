  <text start="0.74" dur="9.13">hello it&amp;#39;s me Tracy this is probably not</text>
  <text start="8.61" dur="3.359">the way that I wanted to introduce</text>
  <text start="9.87" dur="5.519">myself to all you guys that are new to</text>
  <text start="11.969" dur="9.001">my channel because I look like crap but</text>
  <text start="15.389" dur="7.351">outside of that hi I had a really long</text>
  <text start="20.97" dur="4.92">day at work today I didn&amp;#39;t get a chance</text>
  <text start="22.74" dur="7.109">to do much of anything besides stand on</text>
  <text start="25.89" dur="5.25">my feet however I have been reading and</text>
  <text start="29.849" dur="4.951">trying to respond to all of your</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="5.75">questions and I do have two videos plans</text>
  <text start="34.8" dur="5.64">that will be coming out within the next</text>
  <text start="36.89" dur="5.05">24 to 48 hours depending one of them is</text>
  <text start="40.44" dur="4.29">regarding a bunch of the questions that</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="4.65">I got on my WikiLeaks some video I</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="3.36">wanted to go into some more detail about</text>
  <text start="46.59" dur="3.33">that for you folks because I kind of</text>
  <text start="48.09" dur="4.26">just threw the big enchilada out and did</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="4.59">not go over a bunch of the background</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="5.759">and I feel like that&amp;#39;s really important</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="6.09">I do try to keep my videos very concise</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="4.651">and to the point but you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="5.43">people don&amp;#39;t have time to sit and watch</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="6.57">a 20 minute long video and just want the</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="5.4">information really fast so I will be</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="4.89">going through some of the background</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="5.34">information on what those photos mean</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="4.71">that WikiLeaks has been tweeting what my</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="3.69">perspective is about what I think is</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="4.11">going on and of course that&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="5.88">more than my opinion based on what I</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="5.07">know and what I&amp;#39;ve researched and you</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="4.709">know I&amp;#39;ll still get people yelling at me</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="5.16">for sharing my opinion I&amp;#39;ll still get</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="3.811">people yelling at me that I&amp;#39;m incorrect</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="6.3">and I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="94.86" dur="6.99">that&amp;#39;s okay and then I also have another</text>
  <text start="99.57" dur="4.07">video it&amp;#39;s part two to my pedo gate an</text>

  <text start="115.77" dur="3.78">that you guys are seeing and you&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="3.63">very well researched and well-read folks</text>

  <text start="136.5" dur="7.88">on I believe right now what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.29" dur="9.33">seeing in those tweets is more a an</text>
  <text start="144.38" dur="5.89">inside a sort of a threat towards the</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="2.79">powers that be that are holding some</text>
  <text start="150.27" dur="3.39">information they should have released</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="5.37">years ago one question I saw come up</text>

  <text start="178.34" dur="8.92">will be to revoke Assange is asylum so</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="4.319">he&amp;#39;s basically I feel like between a</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="3.99">rock and a hard place right now he</text>

  <text start="269.1" dur="3.75">everything I say</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="5.78">that&amp;#39;s okay you also may find times</text>
  <text start="272.85" dur="5.34">where I made a mistake I try super hard</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="5.35">super hard to get it right all the time</text>
  <text start="278.19" dur="5.81">but I&amp;#39;m a human and I do make mistakes</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="7.5">I will typically call it out when I do</text>
  <text start="284" dur="7.62">one mistake it seems that I made is on</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="9.06">the Donald Trump inside a reddit thread</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="7.72">posting that he was affirming that there</text>
  <text start="297.63" dur="3.63">would be arrests this week it appears</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="5.63">that those comments are now gone and</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="7.23">that the AMA was directed towards the</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="5.26">pizza gate question however there is</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="4.2">some speculation that that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="310.23" dur="7.32">case only because it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="6.93">for the opie to respond to I guess we</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="4.19">have our answer by omission because the</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="4.2">answer would have been omission so</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="4.03">there&amp;#39;s still a little bit going into</text>
  <text start="323.82" dur="4.2">that but anyway five minutes I know your</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="4.08">attention spans typically less between</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="3.75">three and six minutes hopefully I kept</text>
