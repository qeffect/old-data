  <text start="129.34" dur="3.84">linked to the Russian government are</text>
  <text start="131.08" dur="4.32">again exploiting Twitter and Facebook</text>
  <text start="133.18" dur="5.28">platforms in an effort to manipulate</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="4.88">public opinion these recent Russian</text>
  <text start="138.46" dur="4.47">efforts are intended to influence</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="4.12">congressional action and undermine</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="4.08">special councilor Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.4" dur="4.95">investigation which has already resulted</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="4.59">in the indictments of two Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="5.07">officials and guilty pleas from to</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="8.31">others who are both now cooperating with</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="9.72">prosecutors first of all I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="159.91" dur="12.72">I can make this bigger how&amp;#39;s that is</text>
  <text start="164.14" dur="10.89">that better okay first of all why does</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="6.71">Mark Zuckerberg or do Mark Zuckerberg</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="4.31">and Jack Dorsey give two craps about</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="3.52">special counsel Mueller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="182.2" dur="4.74">and how many people have been indicted</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="6.36">in it they don&amp;#39;t or they may personally</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="7.68">but their company shouldn&amp;#39;t write their</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="5.88">companies shouldn&amp;#39;t care about that it</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="4.05">has something to do with their company</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="5.01">at all the government has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="3.45">with Twitter supposedly right the</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="5.279">government doesn&amp;#39;t have much to do with</text>
  <text start="202.12" dur="6.27">Facebook either supposedly right right</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="4.56">so why is it that this is written more</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="4.319">like a horrible smear piece on page five</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="6.151">in New York top of the you know the</text>
  <text start="212.709" dur="7.651">Enquirer or you know Star Magazine then</text>
  <text start="216.67" dur="5.879">a letter that would technically like</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.65">typically go to some kind of a governor</text>
  <text start="222.549" dur="6.091">a letter from government to you in a</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="6.479">private corporation that just it</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="4.8">infuriated me anyway and I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="3.841">having a hard time with this because</text>
  <text start="233.44" dur="5">there&amp;#39;s so much wrong with this it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.25">even funny this is like Nazi Germany on</text>
  <text start="238.44" dur="3.69">sterile</text>
  <text start="239.58" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s coming from these two folks it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="247.53" dur="5.54">allowed to proceed without interference</text>
  <text start="250.11" dur="5.55">from inside or outside the United States</text>

  <text start="2414.869" dur="3.571">about and I&amp;#39;m trying to help people and</text>
  <text start="2416.579" dur="5.28">there are a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="2418.44" dur="5.669">getting upset because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2421.859" dur="4.111">not they&amp;#39;re thinking inside of the box</text>
  <text start="2424.109" dur="3.571">and they&amp;#39;re upset when when someone</text>
  <text start="2425.97" dur="4.05">tells them something that may take them</text>
  <text start="2427.68" dur="4.649">outside of their box and that&amp;#39;s natural</text>
  <text start="2430.02" dur="4.5">and normal and it&amp;#39;s to be on Dino it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2432.329" dur="6.091">to be expected but we need to be very</text>
  <text start="2434.52" dur="4.68">vigilant and very sort of straight we</text>
  <text start="2438.42" dur="2.76">need to be on the straight and narrow</text>
  <text start="2439.2" dur="2.619">when it comes to information like this</text>
  <text start="2441.18" dur="5.399">and a big</text>
  <text start="2441.819" dur="4.76">outlet like Infowars should know better</text>

  <text start="2458.709" dur="7.34">make more than more than more than most</text>
  <text start="2461.349" dur="7.081">people but there&amp;#39;s a difference between</text>
  <text start="2466.049" dur="4.15">making a mistake and being malicious</text>
  <text start="2468.43" dur="4.169">about trying to deceive people and</text>
  <text start="2470.199" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s where the line is drawn for me</text>
  <text start="2472.599" dur="4.17">when when there&amp;#39;s an perceived</text>
