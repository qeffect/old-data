  <text start="43.59" dur="4.32">scratched my head about it but I knew in</text>

  <text start="47.91" dur="5.25">in for some really in-depth research</text>
  <text start="50.129" dur="6.061">into Felix aider because Felix a turd</text>

  <text start="716.88" dur="3.899">the rest of my thread goes as follows</text>
  <text start="718.639" dur="4.75">Cohen and satyr were childhood friends</text>
  <text start="720.779" dur="4.531">Muller investigating Cohen would explain</text>
  <text start="723.389" dur="3.93">why he referred something he found to</text>
  <text start="725.31" dur="3.93">the FBI because it was outside of the</text>
  <text start="727.319" dur="3.51">scope of his investigation Muller</text>
  <text start="729.24" dur="5.719">investigating Seder and Deripaska</text>
  <text start="730.829" dur="7.831">doesn&amp;#39;t bode well for the deep state</text>
  <text start="734.959" dur="7.541">Deripaska is here in this answer in this</text>
  <text start="738.66" dur="5.97">court document open source reporting</text>
  <text start="742.5" dur="3.449">also has described business arrangements</text>

  <text start="761.04" dur="3.63">covered Seder in detail in the week</text>
  <text start="762.42" dur="4.56">prior in that video I questioned Cohen</text>
  <text start="764.67" dur="4.019">and I explained why if Muller is deep</text>
  <text start="766.98" dur="3.479">inside investigating Cohen and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="768.689" dur="4.32">know that publicly because it did not</text>

  <text start="775.439" dur="3.57">that Rosenstein has to approve what</text>
  <text start="777.18" dur="3.899">Muller looks at that is why rod</text>
  <text start="779.009" dur="5.081">Rosenstein is involved here the only</text>
  <text start="781.079" dur="5.081">reason Muller investigates Cohen is be</text>
  <text start="784.09" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s looking at seder and seder from</text>
  <text start="786.16" dur="5.04">everything I&amp;#39;ve researched has ties to</text>
