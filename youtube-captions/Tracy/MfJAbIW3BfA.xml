  <text start="3.57" dur="9.649">11th 2018 at 2:02 p.m. Eastern Time</text>
  <text start="8.37" dur="9.419">I thought I quite have had quite a few</text>
  <text start="13.219" dur="6.341">amazing days since last Wednesday and I</text>
  <text start="17.789" dur="3.631">really should do like just like a vlog</text>
  <text start="19.56" dur="5.7">video to catch you guys up I am still</text>
  <text start="21.42" dur="6.48">waiting for the good sound and filming</text>
  <text start="25.26" dur="6.089">on the Papadopoulos interview because my</text>
  <text start="27.9" dur="6.96">goal is to go through that interview and</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="5.46">then basically critique myself where I</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="3.24">fell short I think that&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="36.809" dur="3.421">because like kind of thinking through</text>
  <text start="38.1" dur="4.74">things I have more questions and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="4.259">sure that I can reach out to George</text>
  <text start="42.84" dur="3.69">papadopolis and ask him those questions</text>
  <text start="44.489" dur="6.59">and he&amp;#39;ll answer them for me so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="7.049">going to do that too interesting story</text>
  <text start="51.079" dur="5.471">the more I listen to the interview the</text>
  <text start="53.579" dur="6.21">more kind of like Bing Bing Bing but in</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="5.04">retrospect I I was blessed to be able to</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="3.211">sit down and talk to the two of them and</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="3.99">get some of those questions out there</text>
  <text start="63" dur="4.29">and I know that that video is poor and I</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="4.56">apologize for that I just wanted some of</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="4.619">that information to get out quickly a</text>
  <text start="70.14" dur="3.24">lot of people asking who the guy is</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="4.381">walking in front of the camera all the</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="5.37">time that&amp;#39;s the actual cameraman who</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="4.95">filmed the interview so I picked the</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="7.2">best place possible to stick my phone to</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="6.6">grab this that&amp;#39;s where it was it was my</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="5.16">first sit-down interview like that in</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="4.919">person with anyone and it was it was</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="3.829">really interesting and it was exciting</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="4.5">and I want to do it again over and over</text>
  <text start="94.939" dur="5.381">hopefully I&amp;#39;ll have the opportunity to</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="6.421">do so I am catching up on everything</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="6">that I have been missing sort of over</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="3.39">the past couple days I read the entire</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="5.88">Comey</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="7.589">transcript I am through the Michael</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="4.919">Cohen sentencing guidelines and now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="6.151">in the sentencing memo and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="5.671">throw out a for sentencing</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="4.89">recommendation I&amp;#39;m sorry I wanted to</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="4.59">throw out a couple things here inside of</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="4.38">this that are really super interesting</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="5.939">and I don&amp;#39;t understand like Dola I do</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.97">understand what am I saying so much</text>
  <text start="133.319" dur="4.031">going on</text>
  <text start="134.05" dur="10.02">the the the mainstream media in all of</text>
  <text start="137.35" dur="9.9">their feverish crazy is the tempting to</text>
  <text start="144.07" dur="5.43">make this document some sort of a nail</text>
  <text start="147.25" dur="5.16">in the coffin for President Trump and in</text>
  <text start="149.5" dur="5.13">actuality it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s exactly the opposite</text>
  <text start="152.41" dur="4.86">of that it is an exoneration of</text>
  <text start="154.63" dur="6.33">President Trump and you know it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="157.27" dur="4.92">because I don&amp;#39;t know where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.96" dur="3.24">pulling some of this stuff from</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="3.84">basically in here they give us a lot</text>
  <text start="164.2" dur="3.6">more detail about the charges brought</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="3.54">against Michael Cohen there are four</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="5.22">different subsections and things that</text>
  <text start="169.57" dur="5.61">Cohen did and their tax evasion there</text>
  <text start="173.02" dur="4.71">the taxi medallions it&amp;#39;s the mortgage</text>
  <text start="175.18" dur="4.32">and it&amp;#39;s the payments they touch on the</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="3.69">Russia thing a little bit in here and</text>
  <text start="179.5" dur="4.05">remember this is the southern just the</text>
  <text start="181.42" dur="5.97">United States District Court and sdn why</text>
  <text start="183.55" dur="6.63">not the special counsel and so Cohen had</text>
  <text start="187.39" dur="5.25">asked for no jail time and in reference</text>
  <text start="190.18" dur="4.35">in regards to all of these now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="3.63">interesting inside of the sentencing or</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="4.14">inside of the statement here they</text>
  <text start="196.27" dur="5.13">mentioned that he Cohen even though in</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="4.08">in he filed something basically saying</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="2.91">you know please don&amp;#39;t give me any jail</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="5.01">time and here&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m a cooperating</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="5.34">witness blah blah blah well in here they</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="3.33">say he&amp;#39;s not a cooperating witness as a</text>
  <text start="209.65" dur="4.29">matter of fact he refused to cooperate</text>
  <text start="211.09" dur="5.01">and he refused to cooperate in that he</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="4.8">refused to give all the information</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="4.26">available about his previous crimes or</text>
  <text start="218.74" dur="4.2">any previous crimes that he knew about</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.98">and what they meant and what they were</text>
  <text start="222.94" dur="3.9">so basically there is the chance here</text>
  <text start="225.34" dur="3.33">that Cohen was involved in a lot more</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="4.02">criminality than he was willing to let</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="3.96">on and in here they talk about how he</text>
  <text start="230.86" dur="4.98">started off as an attorney where he was</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="5.09">making only $75,000 a year and then all</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="4.14">of a sudden he was able to negotiate</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="3.91">some sort of a deal with some tenants</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="3.39">inside of a building he lived in and</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="3.21">Donald Trump brought him on and paid him</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="3.54">five hundred thousand dollars a year and</text>
  <text start="244.84" dur="4.53">he lived the good life but that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="6.48">enough and Michael Cohen&amp;#39;s greed for</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="7.71">power and money basically caused him to</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="7.02">go rogue and do all kinds of all kinds</text>
  <text start="257.08" dur="8.22">of things that were illegal inside of</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="5.1">this statement excuse me no sorry about</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="2.1">that</text>
  <text start="265.51" dur="2.4">inside of this statement they basically</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="5.12">talk</text>
  <text start="267.91" dur="8.78">how he after it was like he wanted a</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="6.82">position on the camp on the</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="5.35">administration when he was denied one he</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="5.22">used his access in quotes to the</text>
  <text start="282.04" dur="5.79">President to almost like a pay-for-play</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="6.15">to land consulting contracts with large</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="4.98">upfront payments promising access to the</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="5.52">president and they say in here</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="5.46">none of them materialized meaning he was</text>
  <text start="296.23" dur="3.84">lying he was saying I&amp;#39;ve got access I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="4.11">got access and then he never was able to</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="4.05">provide anything likely because the</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="5.84">president didn&amp;#39;t communicate with him</text>
  <text start="304.12" dur="6.39">any longer here it says on page 27</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="4.33">Cohen&amp;#39;s criminal violations of the</text>
  <text start="310.51" dur="3.69">federal election laws were also stirred</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="3.45">like his other crimes by his own</text>
  <text start="314.2" dur="3.95">ambition and greed and we&amp;#39;re gonna touch</text>
  <text start="316" dur="4.53">on this in a second I&amp;#39;ll get to it</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="3.79">during and after the campaign Cohen</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="2.67">privately told friends and colleagues</text>
  <text start="321.94" dur="3.81">including him seized</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="4.5">text messages that he expected to be</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="3.96">given a prominent role and title in the</text>
  <text start="327.7" dur="3.93">new administration when that did not</text>
  <text start="329.71" dur="3.81">materialize Cohen found a way to</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="3.33">monetize his relationship with and</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="3.84">access to the president</text>
  <text start="334.96" dur="4.32">Cohen successfully convinced numerous</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="4.32">major corporations to retain him as a</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="5.07">consultant who could provide unique</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="4.65">insights about and access to the new</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="3.63">administration some of these</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="4.02">corporations were then stuck making</text>
  <text start="347.98" dur="4.439">large upfront or periodic payments to</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="4.44">Cohen even though he provided little or</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="4.711">no real services under these contracts</text>
  <text start="354.79" dur="6.3">bank records reflect that Cohen made</text>
  <text start="357.13" dur="7.289">more than four million dollars before</text>
  <text start="361.09" dur="5.82">the contracts were terminated now we</text>
  <text start="364.419" dur="6.181">talked about how Trump told him step</text>
  <text start="366.91" dur="5.64">down from Trump International will give</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="5.27">you a position inside the administration</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="7.97">he stepped down they didn&amp;#39;t hire him</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="4.65">they didn&amp;#39;t hire him back either</text>
  <text start="380.699" dur="4.931">also of interest in here something that</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="4.5">we already spoke about when he was first</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="3.3">charged about these campaign finance</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="2.28">violations and I kind of told everybody</text>
  <text start="388.93" dur="3.69">to calm down</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="6.72">so Cohen undertook all of this on his</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="5.4">own and he basically made a bunch of</text>
  <text start="396.46" dur="3.69">shell companies to filter this money</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="3.72">from took money from his home equity</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="4.23">line of credit to pay stormy Daniels</text>
  <text start="401.74" dur="6.36">there&amp;#39;s others in here as well and then</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="7.05">provided invoices to Trump international</text>
  <text start="408.1" dur="4.59">listing a retainer cost for the for the</text>
  <text start="411.43" dur="3.45">money that they were giving him in</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="5.13">installments it ended up being somewhere</text>
  <text start="414.88" dur="7.14">around $400,000 he got monthly payments</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="8.31">of $35,000 and the organization paid him</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="6.119">as a retainer fee and he provided the</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="7.349">bill to them as a retainer fee for past</text>
  <text start="428.139" dur="8.4">work not current work so nowhere in here</text>
  <text start="433.479" dur="5.31">do they even allege or assert that the</text>
  <text start="436.539" dur="3.871">organization Trump International knew</text>
  <text start="438.789" dur="4.921">that Michael Cohen didn&amp;#39;t perform legal</text>
  <text start="440.41" dur="7.71">services for that money it&amp;#39;s as if he</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="6.57">basically he Cohen basically said to</text>
  <text start="448.12" dur="3.9">them here&amp;#39;s my retainer bill and they</text>
  <text start="450.28" dur="3.389">paid it and they were there is no</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="3.51">assertion in here whatsoever that the</text>
  <text start="453.669" dur="4.47">company knew that what they were paying</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="3.93">was not a real invoice so that was</text>
  <text start="458.139" dur="4.111">another important thing that came out</text>
  <text start="459.46" dur="6.209">here I&amp;#39;m gonna go to the end where they</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="7.289">again talk about they talk about his</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="10.821">basically his his lying his lust for his</text>
  <text start="469.539" dur="10.19">lust for power etc is what caused him to</text>
  <text start="476.49" dur="6.58">do all of these things outside of</text>
  <text start="479.729" dur="5.321">outside of the anybody knowing and</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="4.23">anybody can you know contributing to it</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="8.6">it was it was basically it was basically</text>
  <text start="487.3" dur="6.35">just him using Trump to get money</text>
  <text start="494.78" dur="3.82">Koen did not need to commit the crimes</text>
  <text start="497.069" dur="3.481">he did yet he committed them for</text>
  <text start="498.6" dur="4.08">personal gain he was motivated in part</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="4.41">by greed and the desire to live in</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="4.56">opulent and lavish lifestyle and for all</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="5.19">of Cohen&amp;#39;s outward rectitude he has</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="5.58">lived a double life which weighs heavily</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="4.259">against a variance while Cohen has</text>
  <text start="512.82" dur="3.18">submitted letters describing his good</text>
  <text start="514.409" dur="2.731">nature the evidence collected and</text>
  <text start="516" dur="2.909">witnesses interviewed in this</text>
  <text start="517.14" dur="3.69">investigation paint a decidedly</text>
  <text start="518.909" dur="3.841">different picture a picture of someone</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="4.43">who was threatening and abusive when he</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="3.75">wanted to get his way for instance in</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="3.22">2015</text>
  <text start="526.5" dur="3.63">Cohen threatened a journalist for</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="4.62">investigating a negative story about</text>
  <text start="530.13" dur="4.11">Trump telling him I&amp;#39;ll make sure you and</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="2.549">I meet one day while we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="534.24" dur="3.24">courthouse and I&amp;#39;ll take you for every</text>
  <text start="535.649" dur="3.331">penny you still don&amp;#39;t have and I&amp;#39;ll come</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="3.479">after your employer and everyone else</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="6.06">that you possibly know so I&amp;#39;m warning</text>
  <text start="540.959" dur="5.731">you tread very like lightly because what</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="4.7">I&amp;#39;m gonna do to you is gonna be effing</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="5.459">disgusting do you understand me on</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="5.05">another call which Cohen secretly</text>
  <text start="552.149" dur="4.471">recorded with bankers from bank two with</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="3.75">whom Cohen was seeking to renegotiate</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="4.589">his medallion debt on terms more</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="4.68">favorable Cohen threatened I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="561.209" dur="3.481">teach the bank a lesson they&amp;#39;d never</text>
  <text start="563.22" dur="3">seen before in their life because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="2.94">gonna hit everybody up with the lawsuit</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s gonna spin everyone&amp;#39;s head and</text>
  <text start="567.63" dur="3.899">I&amp;#39;m looking forward to that by the way</text>
  <text start="569.25" dur="4.79">and I&amp;#39;m not saying that as a threat it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.529" dur="2.511">a fact</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="11.59">basically what they&amp;#39;re alleging here is</text>
  <text start="577.67" dur="11.28">that Cohen was nasty dude and kept it</text>
  <text start="585.69" dur="5.67">from everybody kept it from everybody</text>
  <text start="588.95" dur="6.389">and again they say in here a lot about</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="5.82">his greed and his you know his</text>
  <text start="595.339" dur="3.931">pay-for-play attempt that never</text>
  <text start="597.18" dur="5.219">materialized because it never happened</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="4.75">because he had no access anymore</text>
  <text start="602.399" dur="4.741">they basically destroy him in this they</text>
  <text start="604.02" dur="7.74">want him to do they want him to do at</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="6.889">least 43 months in prison 43 to 52</text>
  <text start="611.76" dur="5.25">months in prison and a $500,000</text>
  <text start="614.029" dur="5.021">forfeiture for you know he owes a</text>
  <text start="617.01" dur="3.75">million dollars in taxes and then there</text>
  <text start="619.05" dur="6.149">is this special counsel sentencing which</text>
  <text start="620.76" dur="5.67">is kind of the same thing which I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="625.199" dur="7.741">get to yet</text>

  <text start="700.5" dur="3.81">the people who propagated stories that</text>
  <text start="702.54" dur="4.2">Seth rich was murdered by folks within</text>
  <text start="704.31" dur="4.26">the DNC or any other Democratic</text>

  <text start="710.85" dur="3.06">pizza gate thing</text>
  <text start="711.87" dur="6.38">did you ever investigate the people that</text>
  <text start="713.91" dur="6.57">started those conspiratorial stories</text>
  <text start="718.25" dur="4.209">meaning did you investigate people</text>
  <text start="720.48" dur="3.39">normal everyday said and sentence on the</text>
  <text start="722.459" dur="2.761">internet that we&amp;#39;re putting two to two</text>

  <text start="733.339" dur="6.131">holy-moly people Wow</text>
  <text start="736.38" dur="5.67">and James Comey responds I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="4.71">remember I don&amp;#39;t remember investigations</text>
  <text start="742.05" dur="3.96">on those topics I remember at one point</text>
  <text start="744.18" dur="3.84">receiving an email from someone a</text>
  <text start="746.01" dur="4.639">private citizen to my personal account</text>
  <text start="748.02" dur="5.1">raising issues about the is it ping-pong</text>
  <text start="750.649" dur="4.271">whatever pizza place that was involved</text>
  <text start="753.12" dur="3.57">in some conspiracy theories I remembered</text>
  <text start="754.92" dur="3.72">are sending it to myself saying make</text>
  <text start="756.69" dur="3.569">sure this gets the appropriate place but</text>
  <text start="758.64" dur="3.9">I don&amp;#39;t remember whether there were in</text>
  <text start="760.259" dur="3.6">stations and right after that comes out</text>
  <text start="762.54" dur="3.419">out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="763.859" dur="4.111">I mean they&amp;#39;re talking about Russia that</text>
  <text start="765.959" dur="4.05">comes out next thing you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="767.97" dur="4.649">but it&amp;#39;s almost like as though like they</text>
  <text start="770.009" dur="8.12">stepped out of the room talk it&amp;#39;s so out</text>
  <text start="772.619" dur="7.71">of place it&amp;#39;s so weird so weird the next</text>
  <text start="778.129" dur="3.91">the next part of the conversation goes</text>
  <text start="780.329" dur="5.01">right back into the flow of what was</text>
  <text start="782.039" dur="6.8">being spoken about previously but then</text>
  <text start="785.339" dur="6.631">two days later we get the John Podesta</text>
  <text start="788.839" dur="6.19">article about what happened with Pizza</text>
  <text start="791.97" dur="5.25">game it&amp;#39;s just really curious this would</text>
  <text start="795.029" dur="3.45">be randomly mentioned in commis</text>
  <text start="797.22" dur="3.089">interview and then the media would write</text>
  <text start="798.479" dur="6">a profile on Podesta in regards to it</text>
  <text start="800.309" dur="5.73">and inside of this testimony was also</text>
  <text start="804.479" dur="4.5">another snippet about leaks from the</text>
  <text start="806.039" dur="4.89">field office in New York which lends a</text>
  <text start="808.979" dur="3.54">lot more credence again to the Loretta</text>
  <text start="810.929" dur="4.83">Lynch story that I broke in regards to</text>
  <text start="812.519" dur="7.62">McCabe and Eric prints and that&amp;#39;s later</text>
  <text start="815.759" dur="6.12">on here on the thread in 62 to 63 Nadler</text>
  <text start="820.139" dur="3.39">zas &amp;#39;king Comey about how well he knows</text>
  <text start="821.879" dur="3.45">Muller and commis responding that he</text>
  <text start="823.529" dur="3.6">really doesn&amp;#39;t know him at all he</text>
  <text start="825.329" dur="3.151">doesn&amp;#39;t know Muller at all he&amp;#39;s had</text>
  <text start="827.129" dur="3.031">dinner with him one time they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="828.48" dur="3.75">friends they don&amp;#39;t hug and kiss whatever</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="4.979">and then he goes on to say he was</text>
  <text start="832.23" dur="5.509">supervisor well he was Muller supervisor</text>
  <text start="835.139" dur="5.19">while he was the deputy attorney general</text>
  <text start="837.739" dur="3.91">so commis asking us to believe that he</text>
  <text start="840.329" dur="2.91">only went to dinner with him once and</text>
  <text start="841.649" dur="4.321">barely had any interaction with him</text>
  <text start="843.239" dur="6.87">while he was his direct supervisor as</text>
  <text start="845.97" dur="6.059">the d IG whoa that&amp;#39;s like saying rod</text>
  <text start="850.109" dur="5.491">Rosenstein and christopher rea don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="852.029" dur="6.66">talk to one another ever do you guys</text>
  <text start="855.6" dur="4.889">believe that for a second when Democrats</text>
  <text start="858.689" dur="4.291">ask questions Comey as the memory of a</text>
  <text start="860.489" dur="4.14">20 year old when Republicans asked them</text>
  <text start="862.98" dur="5.49">he turns into a ninety nine year old man</text>
  <text start="864.629" dur="4.89">in diapers mr. Comey um was asked how do</text>
  <text start="868.47" dur="3.809">you want to call him mister</text>
  <text start="869.519" dur="10.32">he was asked about a memo that he wrote</text>
  <text start="872.279" dur="9.39">and a meeting and Jackson Lee tells him</text>
  <text start="879.839" dur="4.2">it was the 27th and he knows immediately</text>
  <text start="881.669" dur="4.62">nope that was the 14th that meeting was</text>
  <text start="884.039" dur="4.5">on the 14th without even being prompted</text>
  <text start="886.289" dur="5.311">he remembers that little detail but like</text>
  <text start="888.539" dur="4.761">huge massive things like who was given</text>
  <text start="891.6" dur="7.73">immunity in the mid-year exam</text>
  <text start="893.3" dur="9.599">remember Sheila jackson-lee also says</text>
  <text start="899.33" dur="5.16">that the the FBI is an independent</text>
  <text start="902.899" dur="3.841">agency as though it&amp;#39;s an independent</text>
  <text start="904.49" dur="4.26">branch of government and I just want to</text>
  <text start="906.74" dur="5.63">remind her if she takes a civics class</text>
  <text start="908.75" dur="3.62">that it falls under the executive branch</text>
  <text start="913.3" dur="6.039">here James Comey bolsters the criminal</text>
  <text start="917.18" dur="4.32">complaint against Robert Muller by</text>
  <text start="919.339" dur="3.75">saying in investigating any false</text>
  <text start="921.5" dur="3.66">statement case you want to understand</text>
  <text start="923.089" dur="3.481">did the defendant or the subject know</text>
  <text start="925.16" dur="3">they were making a false statement</text>
  <text start="926.57" dur="3.93">because you aren&amp;#39;t prosecuted for</text>
  <text start="928.16" dur="4.95">accidents slips of memory things like</text>
  <text start="930.5" dur="4.019">that so in any false statement case it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="933.11" dur="4.409">important to understand what&amp;#39;s the proof</text>
  <text start="934.519" dur="7.081">they knew what they were saying was</text>
  <text start="937.519" dur="7.19">false very important and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="941.6" dur="5.96">some back and forth back and forth</text>
  <text start="944.709" dur="5.741">between Gowdy and Comey</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="5.35">where they&amp;#39;re talking about hearsay and</text>
  <text start="950.45" dur="4.23">like Jim Jim Comey is basically saying</text>
  <text start="952.91" dur="3.75">that you know that the source of the</text>
  <text start="954.68" dur="3.96">dossier there were several different</text>
  <text start="956.66" dur="3.06">sources and third and fourth sources</text>
  <text start="958.64" dur="3.36">that were given Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="959.72" dur="4.8">information and they were unable to</text>
  <text start="962" dur="5.22">verify any of them and then gaudi&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="964.52" dur="4.559">asking him what hearsay is because as</text>
  <text start="967.22" dur="4.26">soon as Jim Comey identifies what</text>
  <text start="969.079" dur="4.5">hearsay is Gaddy will be able to say is</text>
  <text start="971.48" dur="8.4">it admissible in court and then when Jim</text>
  <text start="973.579" dur="10.711">called me says no he basically blows the</text>
  <text start="979.88" dur="6.6">dossier out of the water but instead the</text>
  <text start="984.29" dur="3.45">attorney for Gowdy uh for Comey jumps in</text>
  <text start="986.48" dur="2.64">and says this is ridiculous I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="987.74" dur="5.9">know why we&amp;#39;re going down this road yes</text>
  <text start="989.12" dur="4.52">you do sir yes you do you certainly do</text>
  <text start="993.73" dur="5.469">then he argues back and forth whether or</text>
  <text start="996.41" dur="7.23">not the DA see the the FISA application</text>
  <text start="999.199" dur="6.091">has the word verified on it he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1003.64" dur="3.389">basically trying to give themselves an</text>
  <text start="1005.29" dur="3.989">out saying they don&amp;#39;t have to verify the</text>
  <text start="1007.029" dur="5.93">information in a FISA warrant which is</text>
  <text start="1009.279" dur="6.06">disgusting and and and quite frankly</text>
  <text start="1012.959" dur="5.981">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s frightening</text>
  <text start="1015.339" dur="6.091">I mean shilling this warrant is one of</text>
  <text start="1018.94" dur="4.139">the most invasive and anti Fourth</text>
  <text start="1021.43" dur="5.31">Amendment your privacy rights are</text>
  <text start="1023.079" dur="6.36">completely stripped from you completely</text>
  <text start="1026.74" dur="10.02">and they&amp;#39;re trying to skirt around it</text>
  <text start="1029.439" dur="8.701">it&amp;#39;s um what else</text>
  <text start="1036.76" dur="3.149">he doesn&amp;#39;t know who steel is then he</text>
  <text start="1038.14" dur="3.87">does he lies he lies I&amp;#39;ll put this</text>

  <text start="1042.01" dur="5.399">you guys to also look through it to see</text>
  <text start="1045.25" dur="5.13">the 23 points that I picked out of it</text>

  <text start="1050.38" dur="10.89">gonna be another one of these on the</text>

  <text start="1072.37" dur="6.419">this meeting today by Donald Trump and</text>

  <text start="1078.789" dur="2.851">masterful</text>

  <text start="1088.779" dur="3.931">they don&amp;#39;t want to basically show their</text>
  <text start="1090.159" dur="5.49">hands like basically they&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="1092.71" dur="4.829">negotiate with Trump behind closed doors</text>
  <text start="1095.649" dur="3.301">so that their radical base doesn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1097.539" dur="3.99">what they&amp;#39;re doing but if they had to</text>
  <text start="1098.95" dur="4.349">say it to people to the people they</text>
  <text start="1101.529" dur="3.27">would be too ashamed to do so which</text>

  <text start="1104.799" dur="3.51">know about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck</text>
