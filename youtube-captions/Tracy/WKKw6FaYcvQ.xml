  <text start="14.849" dur="5.671">people trying to get out in front of</text>
  <text start="16.47" dur="10.889">stories for example there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="10.2">reporter she&amp;#39;s a blogger</text>

  <text start="30.72" dur="7.35">she&amp;#39;s saying she went to the FBI with a</text>
  <text start="34.92" dur="5.639">tip that she got from a source of hers</text>

  <text start="44.66" dur="5.95">she&amp;#39;s basically coming out and saying I</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="3.66">believe that there was a serious crime</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="4.26">being committed here there was harm that</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="4.23">could be possible to other people and I</text>
  <text start="54.87" dur="4.739">could help the investigation if I came</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="4.71">forward with the information there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="59.609" dur="3.871">threat here I&amp;#39;ll link below I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="4.23">gonna focus that video on the the video</text>

  <text start="65.4" dur="4.259">here because we&amp;#39;re seeing this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="5.94">seeing political pick up the ball and</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="9.151">kind of also cover for them talking</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="9.33">about how Russia goes after journalists</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="6.33">that out their sources basically what</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;re saying is that Flynn they got a</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="5.46">leak in quotes that Flynn was supposed</text>
  <text start="87.299" dur="5.161">to talk to Bashar from Syria at the</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="4.62">behest of Russia somehow because their</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="4.979">allies none of that&amp;#39;s proven at all but</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="3.87">um the journalist that I was just</text>
  <text start="97.439" dur="2.79">referencing the blogger she says if</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="3.06">something happens to me if someone</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="3.75">releases stolen information about me or</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="4.2">knocks me off tomorrow everyone will</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="4.35">know why and who likely did it and then</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="3.54">the writer of this post Washington Post</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="3.75">piece says overly dramatic</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="3.96">not really the Russians do have a</text>
  <text start="112.079" dur="3.871">pinched a penchant for disposing of</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="3.99">people they find threatening like just</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="4.68">the assumption that this is a Russian</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="5.819">Russian operation of some kind it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s so outside of of journalism it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="6.63">not even funny it just it&amp;#39;s snoops it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="4.5">just it&amp;#39;s ridiculous but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="3.631">people that now that we have the John</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="2.01">Solomon</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="3.84">that gives us a lot more information</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="4.29">that we went over on Friday now that we</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="4.32">have Devon Nunez coming out and saying</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="4.17">you know he&amp;#39;s got these 43 different</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="2.85">people on this list that he wants</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="3.36">everyone to be interviewed in open</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="4.05">hearings now that we have the calls</text>
  <text start="147" dur="5.13">coming from legislators to declassify</text>
  <text start="148.98" dur="5.13">and release documents on you know on the</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="3.689">path on the part of Donald Trump we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="5.76">starting to see like a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="155.819" dur="6.331">frenzy and so it kind of flagged me to</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="4.71">the next thread that I&amp;#39;m gonna do and</text>
  <text start="162.15" dur="5.669">and this is the angle that I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="5.489">show you that I zeroed in on but there</text>
  <text start="167.819" dur="4.441">are other possibilities with this text</text>
  <text start="170.069" dur="3.691">messages this text message other than</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="2.88">what I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you now okay so</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="3.63">let&amp;#39;s just get that out of the way</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="4.8">this is the one that I think is most</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="4.14">likely as well as somebody on my thread</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="4.98">who happens to be a former US Attorney</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="5.7">who agreed with me on it there is a text</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="4.71">message between struck and page on May</text>

  <text start="230.88" dur="2.85">all kinds of things but I found this</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="3.419">really interesting because it fits into</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="5.67">the timeline let me show you this is a</text>
  <text start="235.769" dur="5.041">media subpoena the approval the approval</text>

  <text start="249.54" dur="8.36">agrees to provide the material sought</text>
  <text start="252.829" dur="8.71">and then it referenced as a statute and</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="6.329">it goes through what needs to be in this</text>
  <text start="261.539" dur="2.69">application</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="5.71">let&amp;#39;s take a look at the statute here as</text>
  <text start="267.28" dur="5.49">noted in in the form above and here it</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="4.05">is the department views the use of</text>

  <text start="374.44" dur="6.48">relating to personnel not involved in</text>
  <text start="376.54" dur="5.88">news gathering activities we&amp;#39;ll come</text>
  <text start="380.92" dur="4.56">back to that very important distinction</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="5.16">in a moment however in the interim let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.48" dur="3.99">examine how rare and frowned upon it was</text>
  <text start="387.58" dur="5.49">to subpoena a member of the media</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="6.12">there&amp;#39;s legislation passed in 2015 there</text>
  <text start="393.07" dur="4.14">is a reporter shield measure passed this</text>
  <text start="395.59" dur="1.979">is not something that occurs often and</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="2.519">when it</text>
  <text start="397.569" dur="3.72">it usually comes with much scrutiny it</text>
  <text start="399.729" dur="3.24">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like strucken company are</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="4.38">that concerned about it in the text</text>
  <text start="402.969" dur="5.82">messages and there are some excerpts</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="4.83">here as a matter of fact it&amp;#39;s taken so</text>
  <text start="408.789" dur="3.18">seriously this website here has a</text>
  <text start="410.499" dur="3.271">tracker that keeps track of all the</text>
  <text start="411.969" dur="2.37">horrific instances of journalists being</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="4.229">subpoenaed</text>
  <text start="414.339" dur="7.62">I searched from May through July of 2016</text>
  <text start="417.999" dur="7.14">and I got zero and then I just for</text>
  <text start="421.959" dur="6.21">giggles did a search January twentieth</text>
  <text start="425.139" dur="9.26">through today and there were a hundred</text>
  <text start="428.169" dur="9.08">and seventy five not surprising given</text>
  <text start="434.399" dur="7.39">the attack on the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="437.249" dur="6.521">so here it is to issue subpoenas to the</text>
  <text start="441.789" dur="3.75">news media entities for purely</text>
  <text start="443.77" dur="4.109">commercial financial administrative</text>
  <text start="445.539" dur="4.59">technical or other information unrelated</text>
  <text start="447.879" dur="3.63">to news gathering activities or for</text>
  <text start="450.129" dur="3.51">information or records relating to</text>
  <text start="451.509" dur="6.9">personnel not involved in news gathering</text>
  <text start="453.639" dur="6.601">activities that says basically that a</text>
  <text start="458.409" dur="3.84">subpoena can be issued without Ag</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="4.109">approval to a member of the media to ask</text>
  <text start="462.249" dur="4.17">about personnel not involved in news</text>
  <text start="464.349" dur="4.65">gathering activities we&amp;#39;re well over</text>
  <text start="466.419" dur="4.83">aware of the connection that the media</text>
  <text start="468.999" dur="6.48">has with the intelligence community on</text>
  <text start="471.249" dur="7.38">every level from CIA to FBI so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.479" dur="5.97">happening at around May 12 2016 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.629" dur="5.07">interesting and this is why I focused in</text>
  <text start="481.449" dur="3.9">on this angle for starters</text>
  <text start="483.699" dur="6.33">Christopher Steele started working with</text>
  <text start="485.349" dur="6.3">fusion GPS I could source you know what</text>
  <text start="490.029" dur="3.2">day he started working with fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="491.649" dur="4.05">thousand more times we know the timeline</text>
  <text start="493.229" dur="5.56">fusion began their work with the DNC in</text>
  <text start="495.699" dur="6.661">April here&amp;#39;s a letter from Perkins Coie</text>
  <text start="498.789" dur="5.4">that states that to assist in its</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="3.929">preparation of the DNC and Hillary for</text>
  <text start="504.189" dur="5.09">America Perkins Coie engaged fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="506.289" dur="2.99">in April of 2016</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="7.199">so in April Perkins Coie hires fusion</text>
  <text start="516.159" dur="4.711">GPS to do Oppo research in May</text>
  <text start="518.699" dur="4.51">Christopher Steele was hired to compile</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="4.409">the now-infamous dossier and in May</text>
  <text start="523.209" dur="4.221">Peter struck issues some sort of</text>
  <text start="525.279" dur="5.031">subpoena to a member of the media and no</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="4.32">knows about it this is my theory okay</text>
  <text start="530.31" dur="3">there&amp;#39;s several different things this</text>
  <text start="531.75" dur="3.6">could be this is where I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="4.469">focusing I think it&amp;#39;s entirely plausible</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="5.31">that because contractors like fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="537.779" dur="5.071">and in turn struck in Page as referenced</text>
  <text start="540.66" dur="4.32">by the prior text message we found in</text>
  <text start="542.85" dur="4.679">terms of a wire carrying current instead</text>
  <text start="544.98" dur="4.2">of the Patriot Act I think they were</text>
  <text start="547.529" dur="3.541">stripped because they were stripped of</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="4.44">their ability to complete those NSA</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="5.01">queries in April they needed some other</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="5.31">way to get the information from steel to</text>
  <text start="556.08" dur="4.56">the FBI my thought is there is a chance</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="4.92">that struck could have subpoenaed Glenn</text>
  <text start="560.64" dur="4.8">Simpson to use the technicality above to</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="4.13">be able to legally obtain the</text>
  <text start="565.44" dur="4.92">information from Christopher steel I</text>
  <text start="567.98" dur="4.09">can&amp;#39;t see it being a reporter connected</text>
  <text start="570.36" dur="3.75">to the mid-year exam because that would</text>
  <text start="572.07" dur="4.53">have been in the IG report and there</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="4.47">wouldn&amp;#39;t been so many leaks what other</text>
  <text start="576.6" dur="3.51">investigations were going on that also</text>
  <text start="578.58" dur="3.06">had a journalist connect now we know</text>
  <text start="580.11" dur="3.599">there are three other investigations</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="5.449">going on at this time outside of the</text>
  <text start="583.709" dur="11.191">major exam I mean outside of operation</text>
  <text start="587.089" dur="9.431">crossfire hurricane so is there a</text>
  <text start="594.9" dur="3.689">possibility that there was a subpoena</text>
  <text start="596.52" dur="4.439">issued to a member of the media that</text>
  <text start="598.589" dur="3.69">member may be being Glenn Simpson so</text>
  <text start="600.959" dur="3.691">that he could funnel Steele&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.279" dur="6.891">information back to struck without</text>
  <text start="604.65" dur="8.22">having to worry about FISA and about</text>
  <text start="609.17" dur="4.71">wire carrying currents and about oh gosh</text>
  <text start="612.87" dur="4.56">knows what else</text>
  <text start="613.88" dur="6.1">yes however it would be room it would be</text>
  <text start="617.43" dur="6.529">very short-sighted of me to not talk to</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="3.979">you guys about what else the PS EU does</text>
