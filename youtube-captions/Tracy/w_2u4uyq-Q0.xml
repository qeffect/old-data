  <text start="218.25" dur="6">does do out of all the people on the</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="5.49">news the best job of getting this story</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="4.05">out there and talking to people is there</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="6.989">anything about a baby that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="8.84">like you know it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="233.489" dur="6.301">years ago I wasn&amp;#39;t a big fan of his and</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="6.49">I don&amp;#39;t know what it is maybe because I</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="7.199">I do support Trump and I like that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="5.73">I don&amp;#39;t know I I just like his take on</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="3.72">it I just feel he&amp;#39;s completely brutally</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="3.09">honest I think that&amp;#39;s what I like about</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="4.411">him the most but as as far as what I</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t like about him I don&amp;#39;t think there</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="4.83">is really anything that I can come up</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="5.64">with no cool all right well that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="5.43">I like Kennedy too and the one thing</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="4.79">I&amp;#39;ll say is I sometimes get a little bit</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="5.75">frustrated with how repetitive he is</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="5.34">I agree yeah other than that though I</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="3.27">mean I I mean I could hear about the</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="3.03">Bleach bit and the Hammers all day long</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="7.02">if he&amp;#39;s gonna get to some substance in</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="6.93">the middle so okay let&amp;#39;s do this cuz</text>
  <text start="281.42" dur="3.45">this is basically gonna be about Spygate</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="4.05">because I feel like this story like I</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="4.5">have a podcast and my co-host he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="4.5">you know he always says you know this is</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="5.31">so in the weeds and people are just</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="4.74">losing what&amp;#39;s happening and you know why</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="2.52">it&amp;#39;s important and I wanted to have a</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="3.33">conversation with someone who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="297.2" dur="3.96">know the weeds at all and maybe doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="4.77">understand why the weeds are important</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="4.86">and just see where it goes so where are</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="3.42">you like what is the basic understanding</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="7.44">of what happened with Donald Trump in</text>
  <text start="307.64" dur="7.77">the 2016 election he was attacked from</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="3.63">the get-go I mean the guy didn&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="315.41" dur="4.2">stand a chance it seemed like you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="3.84">I mean like the odds were stacked up</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="3.78">against him I just felt like it was</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="3.989">completely unfair how everyone treated</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="3.12">him and you&amp;#39;re talking about from the</text>
  <text start="324.919" dur="5.551">media perspective of like what they did</text>
  <text start="326.51" dur="5.73">everything right yes yes yes so so when</text>
  <text start="330.47" dur="5.07">it comes to the political operation</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="6.33">against him mm-hmm what is what is your</text>
  <text start="335.54" dur="4.71">basic understanding of that that they</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="3.78">spied on him I don&amp;#39;t know much other</text>
  <text start="340.25" dur="4.65">than that you know I mean I know that</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="4.5">they did but I don&amp;#39;t know the details of</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="3.62">it okay and that&amp;#39;s something that you</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="5.85">feel like you could benefit from knowing</text>
  <text start="348.52" dur="6.01">absolutely awesome okay cool so what my</text>
  <text start="352.7" dur="3.81">goal is here is to go through this</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="4.29">conversation about the story of Spygate</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="4.29">with you and give you some of that</text>
  <text start="358.82" dur="3.54">backbone that filler stuff that you</text>
  <text start="360.8" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t really know right now and</text>
  <text start="362.36" dur="4.59">hopefully this can help other people who</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="4.14">are in your same shoes which i think is</text>
  <text start="366.95" dur="5.279">a majority of the country at this point</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="6.81">I agree yeah so let&amp;#39;s start from the</text>
  <text start="372.229" dur="4.44">beginning okay um how do we do this best</text>

  <text start="589.079" dur="4.861">so they exhaust open source intelligence</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="3.57">and I&amp;#39;m getting this information from</text>

  <text start="626.31" dur="8.13">Russia and he finds that very curious</text>
  <text start="628.44" dur="7.95">Glenn Simpson does so they start</text>
  <text start="634.44" dur="5.899">investigating him to find out why he</text>
  <text start="636.39" dur="7.199">doesn&amp;#39;t have business deals in Russia</text>
  <text start="640.339" dur="8.291">now in reputable right in retrospect</text>
  <text start="643.589" dur="7.411">that sounds insane I mean right but he</text>
  <text start="648.63" dur="4.92">doesn&amp;#39;t move on you would think well you</text>
  <text start="651" dur="4.29">would but not not but we&amp;#39;ll get into why</text>
  <text start="653.55" dur="3.149">this did they didn&amp;#39;t move on because I</text>
  <text start="655.29" dur="3.57">think that that&amp;#39;s a false premise I</text>
  <text start="656.699" dur="5.76">think that that&amp;#39;s bull but that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="658.86" dur="6.63">he says so so he brings in none other</text>
  <text start="662.459" dur="3.511">than Christopher Steele and Christopher</text>
  <text start="665.49" dur="2.37">say</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="4.349">has all these contacts in Russia because</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="5.399">he had been doing Russian and you know</text>
  <text start="670.319" dur="4.38">he had been doing work for mi6 and he</text>
  <text start="673.259" dur="2.971">was a rush of specialists and so Glenn</text>
  <text start="674.699" dur="3.961">Simpson brings in Christopher Steele and</text>
  <text start="676.23" dur="4.95">Christopher Steele ends up writing this</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="5.31">whole like a series of memos I believe</text>
  <text start="681.18" dur="7.44">there are 16 of them that constitute</text>
  <text start="683.97" dur="7.02">what we now call the steel dossier okay</text>
  <text start="688.62" dur="5.67">riddled inside of the dossier are</text>
  <text start="690.99" dur="6.589">basically um I got this information from</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="7.5">so-and-so who got it from so-and-so that</text>
  <text start="697.579" dur="8.2">Michael Cohen went to Prague and he was</text>
  <text start="701.79" dur="5.76">basically paying off the Russians to</text>
  <text start="705.779" dur="3.54">print dirt about Hillary to help hack</text>
  <text start="707.55" dur="3.209">the election okay I&amp;#39;m not even against</text>
  <text start="709.319" dur="3.091">the minutiae of it it&amp;#39;s not all that</text>
  <text start="710.759" dur="3.151">important for this conversation but</text>
  <text start="712.41" dur="3.659">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff in there to the</text>
  <text start="713.91" dur="4.89">point where I actually did a video the</text>
  <text start="716.069" dur="4.71">dossier verse the dossier where I used</text>
  <text start="718.8" dur="4.829">the dossier to debunk itself because</text>
  <text start="720.779" dur="4.951">there are so many copies yes I hope to</text>
  <text start="723.629" dur="5.551">work out to reoffer to watch that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="725.73" dur="6.299">quick so okay basically the document</text>
  <text start="729.18" dur="4.709">debunks itself but that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="732.029" dur="4.74">really important what&amp;#39;s really important</text>
  <text start="733.889" dur="4.88">is at the same time as fusion GPS is</text>
  <text start="736.769" dur="5.67">working with Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="738.769" dur="9.94">Christopher Steele is also talking to</text>
  <text start="742.439" dur="8.09">the US government so what basically will</text>
  <text start="748.709" dur="5.1">happen is Christopher steel will leaked</text>
  <text start="750.529" dur="5.17">to the media information that&amp;#39;s in his</text>
  <text start="753.809" dur="3.57">dossier not the whole dossier just</text>
  <text start="755.699" dur="4.08">little bits and Tibbets of information</text>
  <text start="757.379" dur="3.63">so that the media can begin to run with</text>
  <text start="759.779" dur="2.881">this Russia story throughout the</text>
  <text start="761.009" dur="4.351">election and throughout you know the</text>
  <text start="762.66" dur="5.369">transition basically and he&amp;#39;ll drop that</text>
  <text start="765.36" dur="5.039">stuff to them and then they&amp;#39;ll take the</text>
  <text start="768.029" dur="4.29">media reports and they&amp;#39;ll circle back</text>
  <text start="770.399" dur="5.87">around and use the media reports as</text>
  <text start="772.319" dur="6.901">another level of justification for</text>
  <text start="776.269" dur="5.471">launching investigations into president</text>
  <text start="779.22" dur="4.169">Trump so it&amp;#39;s basically third wheel</text>
  <text start="781.74" dur="4.589">circled information do you understand</text>
  <text start="783.389" dur="4.471">what I mean yes so like I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="786.329" dur="3.3">something you&amp;#39;ll leak it to someone else</text>
  <text start="787.86" dur="3.779">that personal say oh I heard this and</text>
  <text start="789.629" dur="4.08">then you&amp;#39;ll reuse that as like another</text>
  <text start="791.639" dur="3.411">proof that what you originally said was</text>
  <text start="793.709" dur="6.011">true but it&amp;#39;s the same thing just</text>
  <text start="795.05" dur="7.79">whitewashed unbelievable so this is how</text>
  <text start="799.72" dur="8.85">this is what the US government used to</text>
  <text start="802.84" dur="6.84">get the FISA warrant on Carter page do</text>
  <text start="808.57" dur="7.26">you know what the Feist a warrant on</text>
  <text start="809.68" dur="10.05">Carter pages and no exactly so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="815.83" dur="7.32">fine that&amp;#39;s all right so the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="819.73" dur="5.79">is a very very very very powerful Court</text>
  <text start="823.15" dur="4.53">in the United States they are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="825.52" dur="3.33">run by I think it&amp;#39;s nine judges and</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="3.21">everyone out there who knows the story</text>
  <text start="828.85" dur="4.29">already don&amp;#39;t criticize me for the small</text>
  <text start="830.89" dur="3.93">little details um but it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="833.14" dur="4.02">number of judges that sit on this this</text>
  <text start="834.82" dur="6.09">court and what they do is they grant</text>
  <text start="837.16" dur="5.82">very powerful surveillance warrants when</text>
  <text start="840.91" dur="4.58">they suspect that somebody in a cellie</text>
  <text start="842.98" dur="5.46">and and and if they suspect a citizen is</text>
  <text start="845.49" dur="4.18">basically engaging in a hostile action</text>
  <text start="848.44" dur="4.26">against the United States with the</text>
  <text start="849.67" dur="5.16">foreign government they will issue a</text>
  <text start="852.7" dur="6.03">warrant that grants the government the</text>
  <text start="854.83" dur="7.08">power to look into every last drop of</text>
  <text start="858.73" dur="5.82">your personal information everything</text>
  <text start="861.91" dur="5.37">like name something they&amp;#39;ve got it</text>
  <text start="864.55" dur="7.2">credit card records bank records phone</text>
  <text start="867.28" dur="6.6">calls emails anything your travel you</text>
  <text start="871.75" dur="4.44">know whatever it is they&amp;#39;ve got access</text>
  <text start="873.88" dur="4.89">to it in the government not only that it</text>
  <text start="876.19" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t stop with that one person if you</text>
  <text start="878.77" dur="5.1">talk just like sits let&amp;#39;s say you talk</text>
  <text start="881.56" dur="4.83">to your husband and email him and then</text>
  <text start="883.87" dur="4.65">your husband emails his friend this</text>
  <text start="886.39" dur="8.76">warrant allows them to spy on your</text>
  <text start="888.52" dur="11.4">husband and also his friend Wow Wow</text>
  <text start="895.15" dur="7.11">so what they did was Carter page was a</text>
  <text start="899.92" dur="4.47">was a fleeting sort of person on the</text>
  <text start="902.26" dur="5.67">Trump campaign right he was a foreign</text>
  <text start="904.39" dur="5.9">policy analyst he was a volunteer he got</text>
  <text start="907.93" dur="4.95">he got to the Trump campaign because he</text>
  <text start="910.29" dur="4.78">basically like the Trump campaign was</text>
  <text start="912.88" dur="4.17">pushed out of the circuit in terms of</text>
  <text start="915.07" dur="4.71">bringing on good high quality analysts</text>
  <text start="917.05" dur="4.71">to the team mm-hm you know he was being</text>
  <text start="919.78" dur="5.34">blackballed by everybody right who she</text>
  <text start="921.76" dur="5.16">was right so he had no pickins in terms</text>
  <text start="925.12" dur="4.02">of the people he wanted to bring on</text>
  <text start="926.92" dur="6.18">board so he was forced to pick a</text>
  <text start="929.14" dur="4.47">Papadopoulos a Carter paid you know the</text>
  <text start="933.1" dur="2.46">coffee</text>
  <text start="933.61" dur="3.06">they call Papadopoulos so they picked</text>
  <text start="935.56" dur="2.7">they pick Carter Paige they picked</text>
  <text start="936.67" dur="3.87">Papadopoulos and a few other people to</text>
  <text start="938.26" dur="3.51">be their team because it&amp;#39;s coming time</text>
  <text start="940.54" dur="4.2">where they&amp;#39;ve got to have some kind of</text>
  <text start="941.77" dur="5.82">foreign policy advisors right right</text>
  <text start="944.74" dur="4.44">otherwise you know nope no advisers on a</text>
  <text start="947.59" dur="6.06">break yeah bad news so they bring these</text>
  <text start="949.18" dur="7.44">guys on so conveniently Christopher</text>
  <text start="953.65" dur="4.59">Steele&amp;#39;s dossier he&amp;#39;s writing includes a</text>
  <text start="956.62" dur="4.65">whole bunch of information about how</text>
  <text start="958.24" dur="6.93">Carter Page is a foreign spy working</text>
  <text start="961.27" dur="6.99">with the Russians so Christopher steel</text>
  <text start="965.17" dur="6.72">leaks the information to the media the</text>
  <text start="968.26" dur="5.1">US government as well the US government</text>
  <text start="971.89" dur="3.39">has the information from Christopher</text>
  <text start="973.36" dur="3.81">steel the media has the information from</text>
  <text start="975.28" dur="6.39">Christopher steel and then the US</text>
  <text start="977.17" dur="6.99">government the FBI uses the information</text>
  <text start="981.67" dur="4.2">from the media to bolster the</text>
  <text start="984.16" dur="3.84">information that they got from</text>
  <text start="985.87" dur="3.96">Christopher steel meanwhile it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="988" dur="5.4">the same information and it&amp;#39;s still not</text>
  <text start="989.83" dur="6.45">true they bring this to the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="993.4" dur="9.33">and they get a FISA warrant on Carter</text>
  <text start="996.28" dur="8.22">page it is then renewed four times the</text>
  <text start="1002.73" dur="3.21">FISA warrant last for 90 days so they</text>
  <text start="1004.5" dur="2.97">get 90 days of surveillance and then</text>
  <text start="1005.94" dur="4.71">they have to go back in and prove again</text>
  <text start="1007.47" dur="6.63">why they need it again four times four</text>
  <text start="1010.65" dur="5.85">times all the way through 2017 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1014.1" dur="4.29">spying on Carter page and we know from</text>
  <text start="1016.5" dur="3.93">reporting that Carter page throughout</text>
  <text start="1018.39" dur="3.72">this time maintains contact with people</text>
  <text start="1020.43" dur="6">that are in the periphery of Donald</text>
  <text start="1022.11" dur="6.33">Trump so if Carter page emails Sam</text>
  <text start="1026.43" dur="5.07">Clovis who is one of the people on</text>
  <text start="1028.44" dur="6.149">Trump&amp;#39;s campaign and then Sam Clovis</text>
  <text start="1031.5" dur="4.8">emails Jeff Sessions who was also on</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="5.941">Trump&amp;#39;s campaign team who are they</text>
  <text start="1036.3" dur="5.73">spying on us sitting u.s. senator Wow so</text>
  <text start="1040.53" dur="3.9">they use this Faisal warrant to get all</text>
  <text start="1042.03" dur="4.59">this information and spy on the Trump</text>
  <text start="1044.43" dur="5.01">campaign while at the same time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1046.62" dur="6.27">doing that they&amp;#39;re setting up other</text>
  <text start="1049.44" dur="8.7">members of his team do you know anything</text>
  <text start="1052.89" dur="7.11">about Papadopoulos no okay I mean I know</text>
  <text start="1058.14" dur="4.08">who he is I&amp;#39;ve seen him but I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1060" dur="3.69">much about it okay so George papadopolis</text>
  <text start="1062.22" dur="3.15">was another one of those staffers that</text>
  <text start="1063.69" dur="2.25">came on board very interesting character</text>
  <text start="1065.37" dur="3.48">I have my</text>
  <text start="1065.94" dur="5.54">thoughts about but the basic story is he</text>
  <text start="1068.85" dur="5.19">goes over overseas and he&amp;#39;s interviewed</text>
  <text start="1071.48" dur="4.78">he works at this company called the link</text>
  <text start="1074.04" dur="4.58">the London Center for international law</text>
  <text start="1076.26" dur="4.8">practice they bring him in there and</text>
  <text start="1078.62" dur="4.06">there&amp;#39;s some discrepancy over whether or</text>
  <text start="1081.06" dur="3.21">not he goes there on his own volition or</text>
  <text start="1082.68" dur="3.99">they contact him first it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1084.27" dur="4.62">matter but he gets there and and what</text>
  <text start="1086.67" dur="4.23">this place actually is is basically like</text>
  <text start="1088.89" dur="3.5">a training ground for intelligence</text>
  <text start="1090.9" dur="4.32">assets and spies</text>
  <text start="1092.39" dur="5.2">so Papadopoulos is over there working on</text>
  <text start="1095.22" dur="3.93">you know whatever he&amp;#39;s working on also</text>
  <text start="1097.59" dur="4.83">with the Trump campaign and this</text>
  <text start="1099.15" dur="6.93">gentleman called Joseph Mifsud meets</text>
  <text start="1102.42" dur="6.18">with him and Joseph Mifsud supposedly</text>
  <text start="1106.08" dur="5.85">tells Papadopoulos that the Russians</text>
  <text start="1108.6" dur="10.23">have thousands of emails of Hillary</text>
  <text start="1111.93" dur="9.96">Clinton&amp;#39;s oh okay Papadopoulos is thrust</text>
  <text start="1118.83" dur="5.16">into a meeting with Alexander Downer who</text>
  <text start="1121.89" dur="6.3">is the he&amp;#39;s a a very he used to be the</text>
  <text start="1123.99" dur="6.03">Prime Minister of Australia and he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1128.19" dur="4.17">big donor to the Clinton Foundation and</text>
  <text start="1130.02" dur="4.41">he has a conversation with Alexander</text>
  <text start="1132.36" dur="3.9">Downer where he tells Alexander Downer</text>
  <text start="1134.43" dur="3.96">supposedly now he denies that this</text>
  <text start="1136.26" dur="4.14">conversation happened that the Russians</text>
  <text start="1138.39" dur="5.25">have dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form</text>
  <text start="1140.4" dur="5.31">of thousands of emails and this one</text>
  <text start="1143.64" dur="3.78">little conversation is enough for</text>
  <text start="1145.71" dur="3.57">Alexander Downer to send one of his</text>
  <text start="1147.42" dur="4.23">minions to the State Department in the</text>
  <text start="1149.28" dur="3.81">United States and say I think that that</text>
  <text start="1151.65" dur="6.24">the Trump campaign is working with</text>
  <text start="1153.09" dur="7.11">Russia this is what the FBI says started</text>
  <text start="1157.89" dur="4.74">their entire investigation into Trump</text>
  <text start="1160.2" dur="4.62">the fact that George papadopolis met</text>
  <text start="1162.63" dur="4.83">with Alexander Downer and told him that</text>
  <text start="1164.82" dur="5.84">someone told him that the Russians have</text>
  <text start="1167.46" dur="5.91">thousands of Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s emails</text>
  <text start="1170.66" dur="3.22">you&amp;#39;re kidding me that&amp;#39;s where this all</text>
  <text start="1173.37" dur="3.12">started</text>
  <text start="1173.88" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s what the FBI says started a</text>
  <text start="1176.49" dur="4.17">counterintelligence investigation into</text>
  <text start="1178.41" dur="5.19">the Trump team Wow</text>
  <text start="1180.66" dur="4.62">so so and this is legitimately what</text>
  <text start="1183.6" dur="3.66">happened so as a person who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1185.28" dur="4.14">understand you know or doesn&amp;#39;t know much</text>
  <text start="1187.26" dur="6.75">of this yet what does that say how do</text>
  <text start="1189.42" dur="7.68">you feel about that that&amp;#39;s crazy I just</text>
  <text start="1194.01" dur="5.37">I had no idea that that&amp;#39;s where it all</text>
  <text start="1197.1" dur="5.31">started or supposedly started right</text>
  <text start="1199.38" dur="5.549">so that&amp;#39;s what they say but my question</text>
  <text start="1202.41" dur="6.42">is is there these email do these emails</text>
  <text start="1204.929" dur="5.641">really exist no or do we no no they</text>
  <text start="1208.83" dur="3.63">haven&amp;#39;t they haven&amp;#39;t been found and</text>
  <text start="1210.57" dur="5.43">nobody has ever been able to find them</text>
  <text start="1212.46" dur="4.74">and right now where we&amp;#39;re at so so once</text>
  <text start="1216" dur="2.73">we get into Muller and everything</text>
  <text start="1217.2" dur="4.8">Papadopoulos went to jail</text>
  <text start="1218.73" dur="7.05">sure 14 days right I didn&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="1222" dur="8.37">okay so he went to jail because in his</text>
  <text start="1225.78" dur="7.08">words he misremembered dates of when he</text>
  <text start="1230.37" dur="5.01">spoke to this Mifsud the one who told</text>
  <text start="1232.86" dur="4.98">him about the Russian emails now it</text>
  <text start="1235.38" dur="5.58">would be really interesting if Mifsud</text>
  <text start="1237.84" dur="5.4">were a Russian intelligence asset like</text>
  <text start="1240.96" dur="4.98">Muller and and everyone have made him</text>
  <text start="1243.24" dur="4.11">out to be saying that he&amp;#39;s connected to</text>
  <text start="1245.94" dur="3.81">the Russians he works for the Russians</text>
  <text start="1247.35" dur="4.11">and he went to Papadopoulos and so</text>
  <text start="1249.75" dur="4.919">Papadopoulos was conspiring with this</text>

  <text start="1372.929" dur="4.021">continue to do because it would look</text>
  <text start="1375" dur="3.72">really bad so they fire him but they</text>

  <text start="1455.49" dur="5.76">you and what does the FBI do they hire</text>
  <text start="1458.76" dur="5.4">or they put in what&amp;#39;s called a handler</text>
  <text start="1461.25" dur="4.53">for Bruce or so they put someone in</text>
  <text start="1464.16" dur="2.67">place that has to take the information</text>
  <text start="1465.78" dur="3.45">from Bruce</text>
  <text start="1466.83" dur="7.68">then filter it back through him into the</text>

  <text start="1484.769" dur="3.121">they&amp;#39;re still using it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1486.45" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;ve got this fight a warrant on</text>
  <text start="1487.89" dur="3.96">Carter page where they can spy on Carter</text>
  <text start="1489.809" dur="4.531">page and make sure that they have tabs</text>
  <text start="1491.85" dur="4.709">on him and there&amp;#39;s even talk now that</text>
  <text start="1494.34" dur="5.219">there was a FISA warrant on George</text>

  <text start="1511.22" dur="7">representative Sheila jackson-lee in her</text>
  <text start="1513.84" dur="9.179">testimony of Loretta Lynch the former</text>
  <text start="1518.22" dur="6.959">attorney general was they basically she</text>
  <text start="1523.019" dur="4.111">said we know that there were four fives</text>
  <text start="1525.179" dur="3.811">of warrants on and said it and and the</text>
  <text start="1527.13" dur="3.23">lawyer for a loretta lynch was like well</text>
  <text start="1528.99" dur="3.179">you guys can&amp;#39;t say that you know</text>
  <text start="1530.36" dur="3.52">classified information we can&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="1532.169" dur="3.63">about that here and Sheila jackson-lee</text>
  <text start="1533.88" dur="6.779">isn&amp;#39;t the brightest bulb so she keeps on</text>
  <text start="1535.799" dur="6.99">going on with these folks I think not</text>
  <text start="1540.659" dur="4.14">the brightest bulbs right no</text>
  <text start="1542.789" dur="3.901">so like we&amp;#39;ll get more into detail about</text>
  <text start="1544.799" dur="3.811">Spygate in a second but I kind of wanted</text>
  <text start="1546.69" dur="7.469">to ask you if you knew why they would</text>
  <text start="1548.61" dur="10.49">need to fabricate some huge huge global</text>
  <text start="1554.159" dur="4.941">spying operation on a political campaign</text>
  <text start="1560.84" dur="5.829">because they because they had to have</text>
  <text start="1564.48" dur="3.27">Hillary win that&amp;#39;s very good I think</text>
  <text start="1566.669" dur="3.48">they yep</text>
  <text start="1567.75" dur="4.919">I think that it was very critical to</text>
  <text start="1570.149" dur="5.191">them that she be the winner you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1572.669" dur="5.191">hundred percent right um there was</text>
  <text start="1575.34" dur="6.87">another mechanism available for these</text>
  <text start="1577.86" dur="9">folks to use before they needed fiesel</text>
  <text start="1582.21" dur="6.089">warrants and it&amp;#39;s called a 702 query and</text>
  <text start="1586.86" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s gonna sound really complicated but</text>
  <text start="1588.299" dur="5.181">i&amp;#39;m gonna do my best to explain it the</text>
  <text start="1590.19" dur="6.06">NSA do you know much about the NSA I</text>
  <text start="1593.48" dur="5.319">mean I know a little bit about them but</text>
  <text start="1596.25" dur="4.799">the general things so they basically</text>
  <text start="1598.799" dur="3.781">have the power to spy on</text>
  <text start="1601.049" dur="4.71">everything that every American citizen</text>
  <text start="1602.58" dur="4.919">does there&amp;#39;s a powerful Intelligence</text>
  <text start="1605.759" dur="6.12">Agency in my opinion because they can</text>
  <text start="1607.499" dur="5.88">grab bank records and and your you know</text>
  <text start="1611.879" dur="4.081">your phone calls everything that you</text>
  <text start="1613.379" dur="4.561">possibly you know want to keep dear</text>
  <text start="1615.96" dur="3.719">under under your constitutional rights</text>
  <text start="1617.94" dur="4.41">they they have access to and can pull</text>
  <text start="1619.679" dur="4.23">out at any point in time and it has been</text>
  <text start="1622.35" dur="3.72">abused in the past as a matter of fact</text>
  <text start="1623.909" dur="4.291">Brennan and clapper were on Capitol Hill</text>
  <text start="1626.07" dur="3.75">testifying to the fact that they abused</text>
  <text start="1628.2" dur="3.679">this system lying about it of course</text>
  <text start="1629.82" dur="5.429">that&amp;#39;s it came out so they did abuse it</text>
  <text start="1631.879" dur="6.191">and so there were protections put in</text>
  <text start="1635.249" dur="6.99">place and there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a way that</text>
  <text start="1638.07" dur="8.099">that people can query that the the</text>
  <text start="1642.239" dur="6.601">database using specific terms and words</text>
  <text start="1646.169" dur="4.59">and things to find intelligence about</text>
  <text start="1648.84" dur="3.299">people and and you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1650.759" dur="4.14">rules about you know making sure that</text>
  <text start="1652.139" dur="4.201">people stay hidden when you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="1654.899" dur="3.21">at intelligence if they&amp;#39;re in United</text>
  <text start="1656.34" dur="5.189">States citizens and there&amp;#39;s all kinds of</text>
  <text start="1658.109" dur="7.5">rules and regulations but Mike Rogers</text>
  <text start="1661.529" dur="7.201">was the head of the NSA during the Obama</text>
  <text start="1665.609" dur="6.15">administration and at some point I</text>
  <text start="1668.73" dur="4.889">believe it was in April of well it was</text>
  <text start="1671.759" dur="4.29">it was before that he see he finds that</text>
  <text start="1673.619" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s like an overwhelming abuse of</text>
  <text start="1676.049" dur="4.86">this database of information it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="1678.779" dur="3.541">the 702 database it&amp;#39;s got all of the</text>
  <text start="1680.909" dur="3.33">information that you could possibly ever</text>
  <text start="1682.32" dur="5.25">want to know about anybody in it and he</text>
  <text start="1684.239" dur="8.76">finds that that what like Snowden I seen</text>
  <text start="1687.57" dur="6.949">the movies Snowden yes with it okay yep</text>
  <text start="1692.999" dur="3.961">your yep just like that</text>
  <text start="1694.519" dur="3.551">yeah that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s why clapper and</text>
  <text start="1696.96" dur="3.26">Brennan were forced to come out and</text>
  <text start="1698.07" dur="6.27">testify because of the Snowden stuff oh</text>
  <text start="1700.22" dur="6.819">okay okay yeah that makes sense okay so</text>
  <text start="1704.34" dur="4.559">so so what what Mike Rogers realizes</text>
  <text start="1707.039" dur="3.301">Admiral Mike Rogers realizes like this</text>
  <text start="1708.899" dur="5.071">is in the middle of the campaign very</text>
  <text start="1710.34" dur="6.059">early on is that people are abusing this</text>
  <text start="1713.97" dur="3.959">database and just doing unfettered</text>
  <text start="1716.399" dur="4.081">searches and looking in there without</text>
  <text start="1717.929" dur="5.43">anybody you know stopping them and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1720.48" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s contractors that are working for</text>
  <text start="1723.359" dur="5.31">the FBI and it&amp;#39;s the FBI itself just</text>
  <text start="1726.48" dur="6.269">just ferreting through this information</text>
  <text start="1728.669" dur="6.341">willy-nilly without any regard for law</text>
  <text start="1732.749" dur="4.691">rules anything</text>
  <text start="1735.01" dur="3.99">and so he takes a look and he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1737.44" dur="4.2">whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on a</text>
  <text start="1739" dur="4.89">second this is not right he goes to the</text>
  <text start="1741.64" dur="3.87">FISA Court and he says you guys need to</text>
  <text start="1743.89" dur="5.79">take a look at what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="1745.51" dur="6.03">I am halting any inquiries into this</text>
  <text start="1749.68" dur="3.53">database until we could figure out</text>
  <text start="1751.54" dur="6.39">what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1753.21" dur="8.38">so the speculative thought is that</text>
  <text start="1757.93" dur="7.05">fusion GPS is one of those government</text>
  <text start="1761.59" dur="7.89">contractors that was having unfettered</text>
  <text start="1764.98" dur="5.04">access to the 702 database am I making</text>
  <text start="1769.48" dur="3">sense</text>
  <text start="1770.02" dur="6.12">is there anything can you yes yes no</text>
  <text start="1772.48" dur="5.67">totally okay so fusion GPS is using this</text>
  <text start="1776.14" dur="3.42">database allegedly now we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1778.15" dur="3.39">proof of this yet but we have really</text>
  <text start="1779.56" dur="2.97">good circumstantial evidence to prove it</text>
  <text start="1781.54" dur="3.72">and I&amp;#39;ll tell you what that is in a</text>
  <text start="1782.53" dur="5.43">second but basically the thought is that</text>
  <text start="1785.26" dur="5.49">they are one of the contractors who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1787.96" dur="4.5">inside of that database fishing for all</text>
  <text start="1790.75" dur="4.8">kinds of information and then what are</text>
  <text start="1792.46" dur="5.16">they doing with it they are giving it to</text>
  <text start="1795.55" dur="5.4">the Clinton campaign and Democratic</text>
  <text start="1797.62" dur="10.52">operatives when that becomes impossible</text>
  <text start="1800.95" dur="10.5">for them they need another way enter</text>
  <text start="1808.14" dur="7.42">steel the steel dossier the FISA</text>
  <text start="1811.45" dur="5.67">warrants do you understand so like they</text>
  <text start="1815.56" dur="2.76">have unfettered access to look at all</text>
  <text start="1817.12" dur="3.81">this stuff and then all of a sudden one</text>
  <text start="1818.32" dur="4.47">day it&amp;#39;s gone they&amp;#39;re like wait we got</text>
  <text start="1820.93" dur="3.3">to stop this right yeah we have no</text>
  <text start="1822.79" dur="6.12">choice we can&amp;#39;t get information anymore</text>
  <text start="1824.23" dur="6.63">what are we going to do right now Peter</text>
  <text start="1828.91" dur="4.04">struck and Lisa Paige you know who those</text>

  <text start="1873.73" dur="8.13">carrying current which basically</text>
  <text start="1876.64" dur="6.39">references old school warrants so you</text>
  <text start="1881.86" dur="4.86">know when the cops need to get a warrant</text>
  <text start="1883.03" dur="5.34">to look at your phone mm-hmm right they</text>
  <text start="1886.72" dur="3.449">have to go to the court get a warrant</text>
  <text start="1888.37" dur="3">and then they can look at your phone and</text>
  <text start="1890.169" dur="2.821">in order to get the warrant they have to</text>
  <text start="1891.37" dur="5.07">give probable cause of why they need to</text>
  <text start="1892.99" dur="5.16">search your phone right with the NSA</text>
  <text start="1896.44" dur="3.359">database the way they had it they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1898.15" dur="5.72">need a warrant all they needed were some</text>
  <text start="1899.799" dur="4.071">keywords and and the ability to abuse it</text>
  <text start="1904.44" dur="11.109">that is so scary isn&amp;#39;t it yeah so the</text>
  <text start="1910.6" dur="9.03">very disturbing it&amp;#39;s horrifying so the</text>
  <text start="1915.549" dur="5.281">people one of the reasons why this is</text>
  <text start="1919.63" dur="2.22">gonna be interesting to you and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1920.83" dur="4.74">kind of all over the place here so</text>
  <text start="1921.85" dur="5.04">please tell me I know it&amp;#39;s a big story</text>
  <text start="1925.57" dur="2.82">and you know this is just the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1926.89" dur="3.51">going so if you have any questions stop</text>
  <text start="1928.39" dur="6.06">me I&amp;#39;m talking a lot so just stop me if</text>
  <text start="1930.4" dur="6.779">you need to okay all right one of the</text>
  <text start="1934.45" dur="4.77">reasons why we think that fusion GPS and</text>
  <text start="1937.179" dur="5.341">Christopher Steele had access to the NSA</text>
  <text start="1939.22" dur="4.77">database is because if you remember or</text>
  <text start="1942.52" dur="3.84">maybe you don&amp;#39;t even know I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1943.99" dur="4.59">making assumptions because that&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="1946.36" dur="4.559">with me but do you remember the story</text>
  <text start="1948.58" dur="6.12">where they accused Michael Cohen of</text>
  <text start="1950.919" dur="9">going to Prague yes and he never went to</text>
  <text start="1954.7" dur="7.41">Prague right and he proved it yes</text>
  <text start="1959.919" dur="4.14">through all of his lying that he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1962.11" dur="3.75">and everything else the one thing that</text>
  <text start="1964.059" dur="5.281">he and his attorney who was a Hillary</text>
  <text start="1965.86" dur="7.26">Clinton attorney by the way have said is</text>
  <text start="1969.34" dur="6.329">that he never went to Prague and the</text>
  <text start="1973.12" dur="4.53">Prague piece of this story is really the</text>
  <text start="1975.669" dur="4.5">backbone of the entire dossier and the</text>
  <text start="1977.65" dur="5.19">entire Russian narrative because it</text>
  <text start="1980.169" dur="4.711">alleges that his campaign manager went</text>
  <text start="1982.84" dur="3.66">to Prague to arrange a financial</text>
  <text start="1984.88" dur="3.21">agreement between him and the Russians</text>
  <text start="1986.5" dur="5.85">to dump this information on Hillary</text>
  <text start="1988.09" dur="9.809">Clinton that&amp;#39;s basically the backbone of</text>
  <text start="1992.35" dur="7.77">the entire spy gate case the pride and</text>
  <text start="1997.899" dur="3.78">it never happened it never happened but</text>
  <text start="2000.12" dur="2.52">one of the reasons why we think it was</text>
  <text start="2001.679" dur="2.611">fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="2002.64" dur="3.93">working with Christopher Steele and the</text>
  <text start="2004.29" dur="5.12">FBI that the corrupt people at the top</text>
  <text start="2006.57" dur="5.64">of the FBI is because if you go in to</text>
  <text start="2009.41" dur="7.93">how how common of a name do you think</text>
  <text start="2012.21" dur="7.26">Michael Cohen is fairly common I would</text>
  <text start="2017.34" dur="4.339">think so if you go in to the NSA</text>
  <text start="2019.47" dur="7.44">database and you search up Michael Cohen</text>
  <text start="2021.679" dur="7.181">and it spits out three or four Michael</text>
  <text start="2026.91" dur="3.389">Cohen&amp;#39;s and you&amp;#39;re not the brightest</text>
  <text start="2028.86" dur="4.11">bulb like most of these people weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2030.299" dur="4.711">and you pick one one Michael Cohen say</text>
  <text start="2032.97" dur="6.9">AHA he went to Prague build the story</text>
  <text start="2035.01" dur="8.76">around it and it was the wrong Michael</text>
  <text start="2039.87" dur="5.88">Cohen no cheese do you understand what I</text>
  <text start="2043.77" dur="3.39">mean yeah I do</text>
  <text start="2045.75" dur="3.419">you&amp;#39;ve got a box full of slips of paper</text>
  <text start="2047.16" dur="3.63">and you know five of them are Michael</text>
  <text start="2049.169" dur="3.75">Cohen&amp;#39;s and you pick up one of those</text>
  <text start="2050.79" dur="3.48">slips of paper and you look at it aha</text>
  <text start="2052.919" dur="3.75">this is what we need he traveled</text>
  <text start="2054.27" dur="4.56">overseas on these dates perfect work</text>
  <text start="2056.669" dur="4.98">your story around this but oops his</text>
  <text start="2058.83" dur="9.96">birthday is not the same it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="2061.649" dur="9.331">same guy so they made a fatal error they</text>
  <text start="2068.79" dur="5.96">didn&amp;#39;t do their due diligence on what</text>
  <text start="2070.98" dur="3.77">Michael Cohen they picked out of the box</text>
  <text start="2077.6" dur="7.12">so there&amp;#39;s been work done by the good</text>
  <text start="2082.98" dur="4.26">guys in government right now to try and</text>
  <text start="2084.72" dur="6.72">figure out if fusion GPS was in fact on</text>
  <text start="2087.24" dur="6.24">the FBI&amp;#39;s payroll at the same time as</text>
  <text start="2091.44" dur="7.82">they were being paid by Hillary</text>
  <text start="2093.48" dur="10.26">Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign Wow</text>
  <text start="2099.26" dur="11.32">yeah I know yeah yeah yep saying it out</text>
  <text start="2103.74" dur="10.56">loud like this so this is what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2110.58" dur="6.69">on behind the scenes with Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="2114.3" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re spying on him they&amp;#39;re breaking</text>
  <text start="2117.27" dur="5.37">every every rule that we have on the</text>
  <text start="2119.91" dur="5.94">books all in the hopes of being able to</text>
  <text start="2122.64" dur="4.86">somehow either Durell his campaign</text>
  <text start="2125.85" dur="3.78">completely with these allegations of</text>
  <text start="2127.5" dur="5.46">spying and these allegations of Russian</text>
  <text start="2129.63" dur="5.67">collusion or if he wins render him</text>
  <text start="2132.96" dur="3.69">politically inept so that he loses the</text>
  <text start="2135.3" dur="7.2">the the you know</text>
  <text start="2136.65" dur="9.45">the people and they can impeach him Wow</text>
  <text start="2142.5" dur="8.16">I see no way my husband&amp;#39;s upset you</text>
  <text start="2146.1" dur="5.88">understand and I know you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="2150.66" dur="3.66">people that are gonna listen to this</text>
  <text start="2151.98" dur="4.41">follow this story closely like I am and</text>
  <text start="2154.32" dur="4.68">with that like I do and report on it and</text>
  <text start="2156.39" dur="4.2">so I&amp;#39;m glossing over quite a bunch of</text>
  <text start="2159" dur="4.56">detail here you know there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="2160.59" dur="5.07">good stuff but sure for the for the on a</text>
  <text start="2163.56" dur="4.67">30,000 foot level this is basically</text>
  <text start="2165.66" dur="5.04">what&amp;#39;s happened now where it comes</text>
  <text start="2168.23" dur="4">contention comes in is because you think</text>
  <text start="2170.7" dur="3.09">about it so they have this FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="2172.23" dur="4.2">on Carter page which is based on this</text>
  <text start="2173.79" dur="6.11">nonsense that we&amp;#39;ve gone over it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2176.43" dur="6.09">even real information and I guess it was</text>
  <text start="2179.9" dur="5.89">2017 I might have been early 2018 my</text>
  <text start="2182.52" dur="4.38">years are molding together remember I</text>
  <text start="2185.79" dur="2.88">don&amp;#39;t know if you remember there was a</text>
  <text start="2186.9" dur="8.19">big hubbub about this memo that was</text>
  <text start="2188.67" dur="8.1">gonna be released by Devin Nunez yes the</text>
  <text start="2195.09" dur="3.36">memo was yes I do remember that you do</text>
  <text start="2196.77" dur="3.72">okay so do you do you have any you do</text>
  <text start="2198.45" dur="3.21">remember and you might not cuz it you</text>
  <text start="2200.49" dur="3.36">might not but do you remember what it</text>
  <text start="2201.66" dur="5.25">was about no okay</text>
  <text start="2203.85" dur="4.74">no the memo was Devin Nunez who has been</text>
  <text start="2206.91" dur="6.51">read into this entire story the whole</text>
  <text start="2208.59" dur="7.59">time giving the public a an overview of</text>
  <text start="2213.42" dur="7.23">how that FISA warrant on Carter page was</text>
  <text start="2216.18" dur="5.94">obtained and why it was a fraudulent you</text>
  <text start="2220.65" dur="3.54">know there was a fraudulent information</text>
  <text start="2222.12" dur="4.98">behind getting the warned in the first</text>
  <text start="2224.19" dur="6.3">place and why that was important okay</text>
  <text start="2227.1" dur="5.7">the Democrats did not want that memo</text>
  <text start="2230.49" dur="4.65">released they had to vote on it because</text>
  <text start="2232.8" dur="5.22">it contained intelligence that they were</text>
  <text start="2235.14" dur="10.23">saying would damage national security if</text>
  <text start="2238.02" dur="8.7">it was so they released this memo they</text>
  <text start="2245.37" dur="2.58">released a memo they vote on it the</text>
  <text start="2246.72" dur="2.49">Republicans have the majority at that</text>
  <text start="2247.95" dur="3.27">time they vote on it they release the</text>
  <text start="2249.21" dur="5.85">memo the Democrats come out with their</text>
  <text start="2251.22" dur="9.4">own memo saying that the Republicans</text>
  <text start="2255.06" dur="7.33">memo was all lies but</text>
  <text start="2260.62" dur="3.66">now that we&amp;#39;ve got all this more</text>
  <text start="2262.39" dur="3.69">information going back that I did</text>
  <text start="2264.28" dur="3.72">another video where I debunked shifts</text>
  <text start="2266.08" dur="3.51">memo Schiff is the one who put his memo</text>
  <text start="2268" dur="4.08">out and it&amp;#39;s all lies</text>
  <text start="2269.59" dur="5.91">but they were worried about that getting</text>
  <text start="2272.08" dur="9.18">out because from there we started to see</text>
  <text start="2275.5" dur="8.01">the FISA warrant itself what was in</text>
  <text start="2281.26" dur="3.57">there what what was in the actual fight</text>
  <text start="2283.51" dur="3.66">a warrant they brought to the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="2284.83" dur="5.52">and we were also able to see from that</text>
  <text start="2287.17" dur="5.49">who signed those FISA warrants who</text>
  <text start="2290.35" dur="3.99">signed them because when you sign a FISA</text>
  <text start="2292.66" dur="4.71">warrant you&amp;#39;re saying everything in this</text>
  <text start="2294.34" dur="4.89">warrant is true there&amp;#39;s something called</text>
  <text start="2297.37" dur="4.05">the woods procedure where you have to go</text>
  <text start="2299.23" dur="3.63">through this procedure to validate that</text>
  <text start="2301.42" dur="7.73">the information that you have in there</text>
  <text start="2302.86" dur="9.63">is true otherwise the FBI could say Jo</text>
  <text start="2309.15" dur="5.89">robbed a bank and is working with you</text>
  <text start="2312.49" dur="4.35">know Kazakhstan to launder American</text>
  <text start="2315.04" dur="4.83">dollars out of this bank to Kazakhstan</text>
  <text start="2316.84" dur="4.86">because we said so but meanwhile all the</text>
  <text start="2319.87" dur="3.96">information inside the warrant to get to</text>
  <text start="2321.7" dur="7.74">spy on this person this American citizen</text>
  <text start="2323.83" dur="7.77">is is false so only the very upper</text>
  <text start="2329.44" dur="4.05">echelon of the FBI and the Justice</text>
  <text start="2331.6" dur="7.5">Department are allowed to sign off on</text>
  <text start="2333.49" dur="10.11">these warrants and they all did rod</text>
  <text start="2339.1" dur="7.35">Rosenstein Andrew McCabe James Comey all</text>
  <text start="2343.6" dur="5.94">of them signed off signed off on it</text>
  <text start="2346.45" dur="5.04">yes well all of them and then they</text>
  <text start="2349.54" dur="3.96">signed off on the renewals over and over</text>
  <text start="2351.49" dur="5.28">again the people who signed the last</text>
  <text start="2353.5" dur="5.19">renewal rod Rosenstein and this guy</text>
  <text start="2356.77" dur="7.71">named Dana bhante was one of them - he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2358.69" dur="7.98">still there - but rod Rosenstein who</text>
  <text start="2364.48" dur="4.41">started the special counsel signed off</text>
  <text start="2366.67" dur="6.03">on a FISA warrant do you trust rod</text>
  <text start="2368.89" dur="11.73">Rosenstein no did you trust him before</text>
  <text start="2372.7" dur="10.59">you knew that maybe rod Rosen Stein was</text>
  <text start="2380.62" dur="4.53">the Deputy Attorney General he took over</text>
  <text start="2383.29" dur="3.27">for Jeff sessions when Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="2385.15" dur="6.45">recused himself from the Russian</text>
  <text start="2386.56" dur="7.53">investigation mm-hmm am I losing you no</text>
  <text start="2391.6" dur="6.72">okay no no no I knew I knew that part</text>
  <text start="2394.09" dur="6.15">okay so now you&amp;#39;ve got now now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2398.32" dur="3.21">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of information that</text>
  <text start="2400.24" dur="2.58">goes either way on rod Rosen side</text>
  <text start="2401.53" dur="3.18">whether he&amp;#39;s a good guy or a bad guy</text>
  <text start="2402.82" dur="2.4">what his real role in the whole story</text>
  <text start="2404.71" dur="2.49">was</text>
  <text start="2405.22" dur="4.08">but the biggest contention for a lot of</text>
  <text start="2407.2" dur="4.08">folks is that he signed this FISA</text>
  <text start="2409.3" dur="4.59">warrant and anyone who&amp;#39;s asked about it</text>
  <text start="2411.28" dur="5.34">says well I just I thought that it was</text>
  <text start="2413.89" dur="7.11">verified I didn&amp;#39;t know it wasn&amp;#39;t but if</text>
  <text start="2416.62" dur="7.65">I figured it out and I&amp;#39;m just a 38 year</text>
  <text start="2421" dur="10.38">old woman from you know how did they not</text>
  <text start="2424.27" dur="9.66">figure it out right so now we get into</text>
  <text start="2431.38" dur="3.78">today and there&amp;#39;s been a lot more that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2433.93" dur="4.29">happened with the story like for example</text>
  <text start="2435.16" dur="4.92">we know now that it looks very likely</text>
  <text start="2438.22" dur="4.44">that Papadopoulos was set up from the</text>
  <text start="2440.08" dur="4.17">very beginning and that all the people</text>
  <text start="2442.66" dur="4.77">that were coming to him work from</text>
  <text start="2444.25" dur="4.95">Brennan CIA that worked for the CIA John</text>
  <text start="2447.43" dur="5.25">Brennan is not innocent in this either</text>
  <text start="2449.2" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s done a lot of things like he um he</text>
  <text start="2452.68" dur="4.38">basically took the steel information and</text>
  <text start="2454.75" dur="5.43">he now CIA is not supposed to operate on</text>
  <text start="2457.06" dur="4.5">US soil they&amp;#39;re not a domestic</text>
  <text start="2460.18" dur="5.01">intelligence agency they&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="2461.56" dur="5.19">be only overseas right but they take</text>
  <text start="2465.19" dur="4.32">Steel&amp;#39;s information he brings it to</text>
  <text start="2466.75" dur="3.84">Harry Reid who was a senator in the gang</text>
  <text start="2469.51" dur="6.26">of eight do you know what the gang of</text>
  <text start="2470.59" dur="8.19">eight is no it&amp;#39;s eight members who are</text>
  <text start="2475.77" dur="4.57">in the intelligence community or in the</text>
  <text start="2478.78" dur="4.98">intelligence committees who have very</text>
  <text start="2480.34" dur="5.22">very very high-level clearance and are</text>
  <text start="2483.76" dur="4.19">briefed on matters of like the most</text>
  <text start="2485.56" dur="6.48">sensitive matters of national security</text>
  <text start="2487.95" dur="7.57">okay so Brennan the director of the CIA</text>
  <text start="2492.04" dur="5.13">takes this to Harry Reid and tells him</text>
  <text start="2495.52" dur="3.48">you better write a letter to the FBI to</text>
  <text start="2497.17" dur="6">have them start looking into this again</text>
  <text start="2499" dur="5.79">another whitewash of information so at</text>
  <text start="2503.17" dur="4.68">the same time as Christopher steel is</text>
  <text start="2504.79" dur="5.64">tainting the FBI left and right John</text>
  <text start="2507.85" dur="4.8">Brennan is tainting the Congress and the</text>
  <text start="2510.43" dur="4.29">Senate trying to get them to go back to</text>
  <text start="2512.65" dur="3.54">the FBI so they have more foundation to</text>
  <text start="2514.72" dur="4.92">do what they&amp;#39;re doing it was basically</text>
  <text start="2516.19" dur="6.06">one big cover-up operation and a way to</text>
  <text start="2519.64" dur="6.39">maintain gathering intelligence to try</text>
  <text start="2522.25" dur="5.44">and stop Donald Trump Wow</text>
  <text start="2526.03" dur="5.519">I mean it just doesn&amp;#39;t stop</text>

  <text start="3651.509" dur="4.05">entertain the 25th amendment at all and</text>
  <text start="3653.4" dur="4.679">thought it was absolutely abhorrent that</text>
  <text start="3655.559" dur="3.871">McCabe could even be talking about it so</text>
  <text start="3658.079" dur="2.551">there&amp;#39;s no doubt the 25th amendment</text>
  <text start="3659.43" dur="4.079">conversation happened</text>
  <text start="3660.63" dur="6.989">it&amp;#39;s just whose side of the story is</text>
  <text start="3663.509" dur="8.25">true now why am i bringing this up</text>
  <text start="3667.619" dur="8.101">well rod Rosenstein decided all on his</text>
  <text start="3671.759" dur="7.8">own from what we understand to appoint a</text>
  <text start="3675.72" dur="7.589">special counsel in robert muller he</text>
  <text start="3679.559" dur="5.46">decided to take the operation crossfire</text>
  <text start="3683.309" dur="5.151">hurricane investigation that McCabe was</text>
  <text start="3685.019" dur="5.55">doing and the obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="3688.46" dur="5.079">investigation that McCabe started and</text>
  <text start="3690.569" dur="7.111">moved them to the Special Counsel and</text>
  <text start="3693.539" dur="6.33">out of the FBI some people say that he</text>
  <text start="3697.68" dur="5.339">did that because he was worried that</text>
  <text start="3699.869" dur="4.561">McCabe had gone rogue and didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3703.019" dur="4.711">what he would possibly deal with these</text>
  <text start="3704.43" dur="5.369">investigations and that sort of power so</text>
  <text start="3707.73" dur="4.799">he said I&amp;#39;m gonna move these to an</text>
  <text start="3709.799" dur="6.78">independent counsel that is not you know</text>
  <text start="3712.529" dur="8.22">under the command of a Mad King Andrew</text>

  <text start="3729.9" dur="3.55">there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3730.66" dur="4.86">no way that he was acting genuinely by</text>
  <text start="3733.45" dur="5.52">appointing the special counsel because</text>
  <text start="3735.52" dur="6.39">there was clearly nothing there and it</text>
  <text start="3738.97" dur="8.25">was just meant to stifle his presidency</text>
  <text start="3741.91" dur="8.82">for as long as humanly possible so that</text>
  <text start="3747.22" dur="5.36">they could build political capital for</text>
  <text start="3750.73" dur="7.2">impeachment</text>
  <text start="3752.58" dur="8.56">now Robert Muller and rod Rosenstein met</text>
  <text start="3757.93" dur="4.83">with President Trump the day before rod</text>
  <text start="3761.14" dur="5.55">Rosenstein appointed him the special</text>
  <text start="3762.76" dur="8.7">counsel and they met for several hours</text>
  <text start="3766.69" dur="7.76">and the whole story is that Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="3771.46" dur="6.63">sat with him because he was considering</text>
  <text start="3774.45" dur="5.41">appointing him FBI director the problem</text>
  <text start="3778.09" dur="3.69">with that is their ever after Hoover</text>
  <text start="3779.86" dur="4.32">they put laws and rules in place to keep</text>
  <text start="3781.78" dur="4.62">FBI directors from from having 10 years</text>
  <text start="3784.18" dur="5.19">that long and and Robert Muller had</text>
  <text start="3786.4" dur="5.28">already gotten one exemption from that</text>
  <text start="3789.37" dur="4.26">rule they had to pass a law in Congress</text>
  <text start="3791.68" dur="4.35">to allow it so the thought that they do</text>
  <text start="3793.63" dur="3.87">that again for him after what happened</text>
  <text start="3796.03" dur="4.59">with Jay I don&amp;#39;t know if you know about</text>
  <text start="3797.5" dur="5.16">Hoover&amp;#39;s FBI and how crazy they got they</text>

  <text start="3816.37" dur="5.67">horrible disgusting things you could</text>
  <text start="3817.99" dur="7.17">possibly ever think on the on the about</text>
  <text start="3822.04" dur="5.13">the FBI here and the FBI and he just</text>
  <text start="3825.16" dur="3.87">corrupted the entire organization and he</text>
  <text start="3827.17" dur="3.21">had a tenure there for years and years</text>
  <text start="3829.03" dur="3.45">and years and years seemingly never</text>
  <text start="3830.38" dur="4.11">ending tenure so once they were able to</text>
  <text start="3832.48" dur="3.78">get him out of there they decided that</text>
  <text start="3834.49" dur="3.99">they were gonna put rules on the books</text>
  <text start="3836.26" dur="5.61">to stop FBI directors from becoming</text>
  <text start="3838.48" dur="5.3">entrenched for decades inside of the FBI</text>
  <text start="3841.87" dur="3.63">so that they would stop that corruption</text>
  <text start="3843.78" dur="4.27">good good</text>
  <text start="3845.5" dur="6.06">right right so Robert Muller was the FBI</text>
  <text start="3848.05" dur="5.4">director he did his term and then 9/11</text>
  <text start="3851.56" dur="3.66">happened and BER and they said you know</text>
  <text start="3853.45" dur="4.17">what let&amp;#39;s give him an extension so that</text>
  <text start="3855.22" dur="4.23">we can get some sort of normalcy back to</text>
  <text start="3857.62" dur="4.11">the FBI we can get through 9/11 and all</text>
  <text start="3859.45" dur="3.57">that stuff and kind of okay you know and</text>
  <text start="3861.73" dur="2.93">so they gave him an extension and they</text>
  <text start="3863.02" dur="5.94">kept Bob Muller on</text>
  <text start="3864.66" dur="8.29">okay they made a special exception to do</text>
  <text start="3868.96" dur="6.12">that now we sure we have him in front of</text>
  <text start="3872.95" dur="3.57">Donald Trump again and Donald Trump is</text>
  <text start="3875.08" dur="6.39">saying you know he wanted to be FBI</text>
  <text start="3876.52" dur="6.54">director again I don&amp;#39;t know if that</text>
  <text start="3881.47" dur="2.94">jives so people have questions about</text>
  <text start="3883.06" dur="3.66">what they were really talking about in</text>
  <text start="3884.41" dur="4.11">that meeting but he points him in</text>
  <text start="3886.72" dur="5.13">special counsel and he hires all the</text>
  <text start="3888.52" dur="6.78">Democrats to be his attorneys and then</text>
  <text start="3891.85" dur="6.99">he spends two years investigating a</text>
  <text start="3895.3" dur="6.87">non-existent crime of collusion and</text>
  <text start="3898.84" dur="9.24">obstruction of justice and the question</text>
  <text start="3902.17" dur="7.47">is really when did when did robert</text>
  <text start="3908.08" dur="4.11">muller know there was no collusion</text>
  <text start="3909.64" dur="8.1">because if robert muller can&amp;#39;t debunked</text>
  <text start="3912.19" dur="7.86">the dossier which steele wrote then</text>
  <text start="3917.74" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s no collusion investigation</text>
