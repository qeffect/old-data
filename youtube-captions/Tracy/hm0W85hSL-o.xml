  <text start="87.81" dur="2.73">light-hearted episode of dark to light</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="5.4">yesterday but what I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="6.96">lot is everybody&amp;#39;s talking about how</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="6.299">Mike Rogers former NSA director Mike</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="5.61">Rogers is cooperating with Durham in his</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="5.551">investigation and we&amp;#39;ve known about</text>
  <text start="103.11" dur="5.67">Rogers forever we talked years ago about</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="4.59">how he went up to Trump Tower and then</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="4.019">in the transition and a couple days</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="3.75">later of course heard the day a day</text>
  <text start="112.799" dur="4.801">later Trump moved to Bedminster New</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="5.27">Jersey and this stuff is coming up more</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="4.35">and more as we get more information</text>
  <text start="119.99" dur="6.129">dripping out of this Durham</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="6.419">investigation I don&amp;#39;t think like many</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="4.95">people have said there will be a report</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="6.081">I do however think that there will be</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="3.381">indictments coming out of this</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="4.21">William bar has been very clear on what</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re looking at and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="4.2">finding for the most part they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="4.41">careful not to give things away I find</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="4.05">it interesting that this investigation</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="4.56">is being talked about a lot more now</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;ve gone through on the channel before</text>
  <text start="149.58" dur="4.35">when this actually started and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="5.07">shown you the transcript from the</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="4.95">hearing with James Baker in front of Jim</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="3.42">Jordan and Mark meadows where he</text>
  <text start="158.88" dur="4.08">mentions when he&amp;#39;s asked about David</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="3.96">corn of Mother Jones who&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="162.96" dur="6.03">first people to print the dossier</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="6.18">related material he&amp;#39;s asked about David</text>
  <text start="168.99" dur="2.67">corn and Baker&amp;#39;s not able to answer and</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="2.82">he says he&amp;#39;s under criminal</text>
  <text start="171.66" dur="3.87">investigation there&amp;#39;s a criminal</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="4.77">investigation ongoing right now into</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="5.179">this and he&amp;#39;s asked by who</text>
  <text start="178.35" dur="5.16">you mean Horowitz and he goes no no</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="5.201">Durham and then Jordan or meadows I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="5.1">not Shores like wait wait you mean who</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="6.15">Burr and he goes no Durham and this was</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="4.71">October 3rd I believe of 2018 they make</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="3.24">him repeated a couple times</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="6.21">shortly thereafter there&amp;#39;s a letter</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="8.88">written by by Jim Jordan asking what</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="5.37">this Durham is doing and that again like</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="3">him or hate him</text>
  <text start="204.9" dur="3.69">Durham was appointed by sessions to do</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="3.059">those things and some people are like</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="5.7">well he was only appointed to take a</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="7.081">look at the leaks to which I say US</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="6.72">Attorney&amp;#39;s are not like Inspector</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="5.91">General&amp;#39;s US Attorney&amp;#39;s if they find</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="5.37">evidence of another crime don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="6.569">stop and not look at that they continue</text>
  <text start="226.38" dur="5.639">digging so if he&amp;#39;s interviewing corn</text>
  <text start="229.799" dur="4.261">who&amp;#39;s talking about the dossier or he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.019" dur="4.801">interviewing Baker who was involved in</text>
  <text start="234.06" dur="8.22">all of this malfeasance he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="236.82" dur="8.88">discover other things which means in you</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="6.26">know just to follow that means that the</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="5.55">Spygate investigation what Durham</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="6.34">supposedly started doing in May of this</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="5.85">year when allegedly William bar first</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="5.609">appointed him he&amp;#39;s been doing for for</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="7.069">much much longer than that at the very</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="6.961">very least October of 2018 but again</text>
  <text start="264.169" dur="4.841">Baker mentions this has been ongoing so</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="4.56">could have been months earlier than that</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="5.49">this has been going on a lot longer than</text>
  <text start="272.01" dur="6.03">most people are letting you know US</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="5.79">attorneys don&amp;#39;t write reports to throw</text>
  <text start="278.04" dur="3.03">out into the public sphere that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="280.29" dur="2.73">their job</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="3.87">so everybody&amp;#39;s saying that there will be</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="4.32">some report at the end of this I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="4.65">understand that I have done research</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="4.2">upon research to try and figure out if</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="3.9">this is actually the case are there</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="4.02">reports written by US attorneys special</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="4.38">counsels maybe he&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s a US</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="4.59">attorney this is not a special counsel</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="4.98">investigation very big distinction</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="4.11">unless we find out later on that this is</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="4.77">some special counsel that&amp;#39;s been ongoing</text>
  <text start="304.26" dur="4.86">that we had no idea was ongoing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="4.98">think there&amp;#39;ll be any report at the end</text>
  <text start="309.12" dur="7.2">of this so anyway I digress Mike Rogers</text>
  <text start="312.6" dur="5.16">has been meeting with Durham apparently</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="4.95">and has met multiple times with him</text>
  <text start="317.76" dur="5.37">again Mike Rogers why I&amp;#39;m doing this</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="6.3">right now is because I want to go over a</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="8.37">summary report that I did back in the</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="7.35">beginning of 2019 this was supposed to</text>
  <text start="331.5" dur="5.25">January 31st 2019 and I&amp;#39;ve gone over</text>
  <text start="334.92" dur="9.42">this with you guys a couple times but</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="9.45">again it it&amp;#39;s worth repeating I would be</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="5.91">remiss if I didn&amp;#39;t thank Jeff Carlson</text>
  <text start="346.2" dur="7.68">from epoch times now for his work that</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="7.65">that he did into the 702 mouth you know</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="6.93">Wow criminality that went on during the</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="7.08">Obama administration a large part of</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="6.96">what I do in this report is taken taking</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="5.76">his research and kind of melding it in</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="4.46">which is what we do in this little crew</text>
  <text start="370.74" dur="6.36">that we&amp;#39;ve got going on here</text>
  <text start="372.23" dur="6.1">but um you know this is crucial and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="377.1" dur="2.88">just gonna go through it step-by-step</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="2.13">because a lot of people don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="379.98" dur="3.03">read</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="5.91">I wrote this this is my work on</text>
  <text start="383.01" dur="5.93">uncovered EC on January 29th of 2019 the</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="5.52">Office of Inspector General Horowitz</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="5.05">released an investigative summary which</text>
  <text start="391.89" dur="4.89">implicates high-ranking members of the</text>
  <text start="393.99" dur="6.24">FBI in violation of something known as</text>
  <text start="396.78" dur="4.349">the Federal Acquisition regulation he</text>
  <text start="400.23" dur="4.29">doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="404.52" dur="7.139">they&amp;#39;re too current senior FBI officials</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="5.579">and one retired so when this came out</text>
  <text start="411.659" dur="3.6">nobody understood what this meant</text>
  <text start="413.129" dur="6.15">neither did I it was super complicated</text>
  <text start="415.259" dur="7.2">here is the report this was a summary</text>
  <text start="419.279" dur="4.38">report that he released Horowitz he&amp;#39;s in</text>

  <text start="425.639" dur="4.74">report people immediately been begin</text>
  <text start="428.699" dur="2.4">looking at it some people missed it some</text>
  <text start="430.379" dur="2.85">people saw it</text>
  <text start="431.099" dur="4.201">it says findings of misconduct by two</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="3.81">current senior FBI officials and one</text>
  <text start="435.3" dur="5.219">retired FBI official while providing</text>
  <text start="437.039" dur="6.6">oversight on an FBI contract the DOJ o</text>
  <text start="440.519" dur="5.69">IG initiated this investigation upon</text>
  <text start="443.639" dur="4.68">receipt of information from the FBI</text>
  <text start="446.209" dur="5.56">concerning multiple allegations</text>
  <text start="448.319" dur="9.03">involving an FBI contractor and three</text>

  <text start="457.349" dur="6.57">officials one retired FBI or official</text>
  <text start="460.769" dur="5.46">official the OIG found that this is</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="4.56">where it gets murky and mucky okay he</text>
  <text start="466.229" dur="4.47">says the OIG found that as a result of</text>
  <text start="468.479" dur="4.7">conduct by two current senior FBI</text>
  <text start="470.699" dur="6.39">officials and one retired FBI official</text>
  <text start="473.179" dur="6.7">the FBI contractor engaged in certain</text>
  <text start="477.089" dur="5.18">inherent governmental activities in</text>
  <text start="479.879" dur="3.74">contravention of Federal Acquisition</text>
  <text start="482.269" dur="4.33">regulations</text>
  <text start="483.619" dur="6.13">additionally the OIG found that these</text>
  <text start="486.599" dur="6">three FBI officials did not adhere to</text>
  <text start="489.749" dur="6.23">OMB policy while managing the contractor</text>
  <text start="492.599" dur="6.06">further the IG found that the FBI</text>
  <text start="495.979" dur="6.48">contractor failed to adhere to personal</text>
  <text start="498.659" dur="6.72">conflict of interest rules under the far</text>
  <text start="502.459" dur="4.75">the OIG has completed its investigation</text>
  <text start="505.379" dur="4.13">and provided its report to the FBI for</text>
  <text start="507.209" dur="6.99">appropriate action</text>
  <text start="509.509" dur="6.64">now we&amp;#39;re gonna unpack this whole thing</text>
  <text start="514.199" dur="3.96">it is very poignant and relevant to</text>
  <text start="516.149" dur="4.231">today but I want you guys to understand</text>
  <text start="518.159" dur="4.98">one thing real quick this last sentence</text>
  <text start="520.38" dur="5.97">had troubled me because I&amp;#39;m like this</text>
  <text start="523.139" dur="4.89">fits really well with a certain somebody</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ll get into in a second and we&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="528.029" dur="4.23">into it very very carefully and in</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="4.229">detail because this is important now</text>
  <text start="532.259" dur="2.651">preface thing before we get into the</text>
  <text start="534.209" dur="4.901">details</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="6.57">hmm do I know that this is a hundred</text>
  <text start="539.11" dur="5.28">thousand percent true that that what no</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="5.94">this is my best guess based on the facts</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="5.31">given so don&amp;#39;t you know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="6.36">personally pretty sure I know who this</text>
  <text start="549.7" dur="5.82">is but I don&amp;#39;t have documentation to</text>
  <text start="553.78" dur="4.77">prove it so I&amp;#39;m just throwing that out</text>
  <text start="555.52" dur="5.31">there for you guys before we begin we</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="4.98">know that the IG at the time was</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="9.24">investigating the FISA process which we</text>
  <text start="563.53" dur="9.12">just got the report for the IG states in</text>
  <text start="570.07" dur="6.78">that summary that as a result of conduct</text>
  <text start="572.65" dur="6.33">by these officials an FBI contractor</text>
  <text start="576.85" dur="5.01">engaged in inherent governmental</text>
  <text start="578.98" dur="5.82">activities what is an inherent</text>
  <text start="581.86" dur="4.61">governmental activity as per the OMB in</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="4.35">clarifying the Federal Acquisition</text>
  <text start="586.47" dur="5.8">regulations and inherent government</text>
  <text start="589.15" dur="5.01">activity is defined as amongst many</text>
  <text start="592.27" dur="4.32">other things and I linked to the</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="4.17">documents here quote the direction and</text>
  <text start="596.59" dur="5.04">control of intelligence and</text>
  <text start="598.33" dur="6.18">counterintelligence operations the rest</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="6.03">of the stuff that is in these none of it</text>
  <text start="604.51" dur="9.21">really fits so this is the one that fit</text>
  <text start="607.66" dur="10.77">as Jeff Carlson reported back in 2018</text>
  <text start="613.72" dur="7.44">on April 18 2016 Admiral Mike Rogers he</text>
  <text start="618.43" dur="6.24">shut down all outside contractor access</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="5.99">to raw FISA information specifically</text>
  <text start="624.67" dur="5.7">outside contractors working for the FBI</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="6.28">the discovery that outside contractors</text>
  <text start="630.37" dur="4.89">were accessing rafasa data is probably</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="4.98">the event that precipitated Rogers</text>
  <text start="635.26" dur="6.27">ordering a full compliance review this</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="6.3">is 702 queries of raw intelligence data</text>
  <text start="641.53" dur="5.46">that FBI contractors had access to and</text>
  <text start="644.71" dur="5.34">were abusing it&amp;#39;s revealed throughout</text>
  <text start="646.99" dur="6.06">the FISA Court investigation and then in</text>
  <text start="650.05" dur="5.7">a report issued in April of 2017 by them</text>
