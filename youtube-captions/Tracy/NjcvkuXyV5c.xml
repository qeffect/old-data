  <text start="169.06" dur="7.86">to sell to women coming into our</text>

  <text start="238.16" dur="6.62">we are all God&amp;#39;s children from the</text>
  <text start="241.7" dur="3.08">moment of conception</text>
  <text start="251" dur="7.04">I think a smile of the right-to-life at</text>
  <text start="254.99" dur="5.76">26 weeks it&amp;#39;s just as heinous as</text>
  <text start="258.04" dur="6.64">depriving a child of the right to life</text>
  <text start="260.75" dur="7.86">at six weeks at eight weeks there was a</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="8.73">time in society when I think we were</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="8.16">sort of ignorance to what an unborn</text>

  <text start="276.77" dur="4.86">people said well it&amp;#39;s just a clump of</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="5.43">cells it&amp;#39;s just a massive tissue that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="7.92">what people really believed many years</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="7.25">ago that was the ignorance that caused</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="6.41">us to pass row v Wade and Doe v Bolton</text>
  <text start="292" dur="6.64">but now we know we have medical science</text>

  <text start="312.47" dur="7.74">we have stuck to a new flow a new level</text>
  <text start="316.64" dur="6.029">of depravity in our society when we are</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="6">willing to look at that unborn human</text>
