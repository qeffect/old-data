  <text start="144.29" dur="5.25">this story is so big and if you go back</text>
  <text start="146.96" dur="4.11">on my channel for years now you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="3.09">that I as I talked about I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="151.07" dur="5.61">covering gusta for too I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="6.15">covering the DNC leaks not hack leaks</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="3.84">and it&amp;#39;s the cornerstone of the entire</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="4.59">Russia collusion story and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="160.52" dur="4.32">finding so refreshing is that even</text>
  <text start="163.37" dur="3.75">though we&amp;#39;re years down the road now</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="5.07">things are coming out that we had</text>
  <text start="167.12" dur="5.13">reported much earlier it is a fantastic</text>
  <text start="169.91" dur="5.67">thing it is awesome I&amp;#39;m not upset by it</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="5.01">at all I think it&amp;#39;s great and there are</text>
  <text start="175.58" dur="3.75">a lot of people that are newer to my</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="4.59">channel and my work and so it never</text>
  <text start="179.33" dur="5.21">hurts to do refreshes of this stuff for</text>
  <text start="181.85" dur="4.68">folks and it&amp;#39;s really really important</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="3.82">one of the things that absolutely</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="3.78">stunned me was hearing Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="5.099">admit in his own hearing that he had</text>
  <text start="190.31" dur="4.86">gotten this dossier from McCain even</text>
  <text start="193.459" dur="3.691">though we knew it and he&amp;#39;d said it once</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="4.11">or twice before hearing him say it and</text>
  <text start="197.15" dur="5.58">admit and acknowledge the fact that it</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="6.959">is just nonsense was great I did a video</text>
  <text start="202.73" dur="6.39">on New Year&amp;#39;s Eve two years ago that</text>
  <text start="206.239" dur="6.03">used the dossier to debunk itself it was</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="7.67">a debate the dossier versa dossier they</text>
  <text start="212.269" dur="9.151">competed with one another nobody won so</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="5.38">so it was nonsense and the FISA report</text>
  <text start="221.42" dur="3.66">from Horowitz</text>
  <text start="222.17" dur="6.08">was kind of like not the end but the</text>
  <text start="225.08" dur="6.27">beginning the beginning of what would be</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="5.47">what will be the uncovering of a ton of</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="3.48">information that we&amp;#39;ve been looking for</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="3.9">again</text>
  <text start="234.83" dur="5.939">the entire Russia hoax is hinged on the</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="4.14">fact of the DNC server no matter how</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="3.421">much they want to take your attention</text>
  <text start="241.76" dur="5.46">away from it that leak of that</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="6.63">information was what made this entire</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="6.84">narrative come come about they needed an</text>
  <text start="250.82" dur="6.84">excuse for it this is how it all started</text>
  <text start="254.06" dur="5.39">so I put this threat together back in</text>
  <text start="257.66" dur="3.44">May of 2018</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="3.57">because this threat is from May of 2018</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="4.98">doesn&amp;#39;t mean the information is old</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="5.88">recycled or whatever it&amp;#39;s important as</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="3.51">heck there was a lawsuit going on in the</text>

  <text start="1018.93" dur="3.18">it appears that select folks in the</text>
  <text start="1020.58" dur="4.68">intelligence community who had used the</text>
  <text start="1022.11" dur="5.13">unverified dossier already to get FISA</text>

  <text start="1034.98" dur="6.3">December memo details how the hacking</text>
  <text start="1036.87" dur="5.67">happened and then CrowdStrike uses it to</text>
  <text start="1041.28" dur="3.72">come to their conclusion about how the</text>
  <text start="1042.54" dur="5.48">hacking happened knowing now that this</text>
  <text start="1045" dur="7.34">is all bull is it safe to say that</text>
  <text start="1048.02" dur="4.32">CrowdStrike has some explaining to do</text>
  <text start="1053.09" dur="3">hmm</text>
  <text start="1058.99" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s crazy this is crazy the December</text>
  <text start="1062.89" dur="3.5">memo sound formed some of the basis of</text>
  <text start="1065.47" dur="4.319">the CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="1066.39" dur="10.029">explanation for the quote hack of the</text>
  <text start="1069.789" dur="9.781">DNC server I have a video here I can</text>
  <text start="1076.419" dur="5.13">lake link but the Senate Intel committee</text>
  <text start="1079.57" dur="3.329">knows that that&amp;#39;s nonsense</text>
  <text start="1081.549" dur="6.63">and still says there&amp;#39;s Russian</text>
  <text start="1082.899" dur="10.171">interference nonsense nonsense all of it</text>
  <text start="1088.179" dur="9.901">nonsense again piecing this together</text>
  <text start="1093.07" dur="7.17">from May of 2018 so what I&amp;#39;m going to do</text>
  <text start="1098.08" dur="5.4">is put the thread in the chat in the</text>
  <text start="1100.24" dur="4.77">description box below and I&amp;#39;ll put the</text>
  <text start="1103.48" dur="5.85">other video in the description box below</text>
  <text start="1105.01" dur="7.25">and guys like seriously what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1109.33" dur="4.56">now is all this stuff is coming out now</text>
  <text start="1112.26" dur="4.33">which is great</text>
  <text start="1113.89" dur="6.33">again it&amp;#39;s fantastic but it all boils</text>
  <text start="1116.59" dur="6.63">down to this server and if you go to my</text>
  <text start="1120.22" dur="6.089">channel and you scroll back you will see</text>
  <text start="1123.22" dur="6.6">a number of videos many many videos on</text>
  <text start="1126.309" dur="8.041">gusoff or two I I implore you guys to</text>
  <text start="1129.82" dur="7.56">watch them I really do they go in detail</text>
  <text start="1134.35" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re very in-depth they explain the</text>
  <text start="1137.38" dur="5.399">forensics behind everything I have one</text>
  <text start="1140.02" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s called gusoff or to sums up</text>
  <text start="1142.779" dur="6.301">everything that&amp;#39;s like a big summary of</text>
  <text start="1145.36" dur="5.429">everything that is is really full of</text>
  <text start="1149.08" dur="5.579">information that I think is really</text>
  <text start="1150.789" dur="5.88">important it to be honest it may make</text>
  <text start="1154.659" dur="7.291">sense for me to just do all of this over</text>
