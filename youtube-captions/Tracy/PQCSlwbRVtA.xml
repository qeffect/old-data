  <text start="2.639" dur="6.17">August 18th 2018 at 142 p.m. Eastern</text>
  <text start="6.93" dur="4.65">Time</text>
  <text start="8.809" dur="5.381">I&amp;#39;ve been going over the statement of a</text>
  <text start="11.58" dur="4.229">fence or the charging documents I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="14.19" dur="4.679">sorry the sentencing recommendations</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="5.041">that Muller&amp;#39;s office filed with the</text>
  <text start="18.869" dur="4.381">court yesterday in regards to</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="4.65">Papadopoulos and it&amp;#39;s a very interesting</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="6.33">document and I&amp;#39;ve been like you know</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="7.62">Papadopoulos story is a twisted tangled</text>
  <text start="29.58" dur="6.24">web of he-said he-said she-said and you</text>
  <text start="33.12" dur="5.33">know all kinds of other nonsense like</text>
  <text start="35.82" dur="5.07">supposedly the whole crossfire hurricane</text>
  <text start="38.45" dur="5.379">counterintelligence operations started</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="5.7">because of Papadopoulos talking to</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="6">Alexander Downer in a London bar about</text>
  <text start="46.59" dur="5.34">what Professor Mifsud said to him in</text>
  <text start="49.829" dur="4.111">regards to the Russians having dirt on</text>
  <text start="51.93" dur="9.99">Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="9.48">of emails the problem is that it said</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="4.17">that the professor never said that</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="4.379">downer says that he never told that</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="4.2">Papadopoulos never told him that but</text>
  <text start="67.799" dur="4.491">downers contact with the State</text>
  <text start="70.29" dur="5.04">Department it will is what caused</text>
  <text start="72.29" dur="6.28">supposedly the entire crossfire</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="5.579">hurricane operation to begin and we know</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="4.53">from what we&amp;#39;ve been learning over time</text>
  <text start="80.909" dur="4.441">that it&amp;#39;s probably not the case that</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="3.9">Papadopoulos was the cause of this they</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="3.21">kind of flip back and forth between it</text>
  <text start="87" dur="3.54">was Papadopoulos his fault it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="3.84">Papadopoulos his fault but the</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="3.78">sentencing memorandum came out yesterday</text>
  <text start="92.4" dur="3.359">and there are a number of interesting</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="3.99">things inside of it and we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="5.161">over it together here a little bit and</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="5.07">talk about some of those things key</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="5.129">points to keep a lookout for simona</text>

  <text start="106.049" dur="3.57">this we&amp;#39;re gonna go into her in a little</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="4.379">bit more detail today we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="3.78">into some discrepancies between the</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.291">statement of offense in george</text>
  <text start="113.399" dur="5.07">papadapolis case and the sentencing memo</text>

  <text start="126.299" dur="3.981">take a look at the last page of this</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="4.11">thing which has a very interesting</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="3.64">random statement on it that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="4.16">literally chuckling about</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="5.7">because it just can&amp;#39;t get more weird now</text>

  <text start="166.739" dur="4.711">found as well and you know I could sit</text>
  <text start="169.83" dur="4.469">here and read these things to you but</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="5.25">like you really have to get up to speed</text>
  <text start="174.299" dur="5.94">on Papadopoulos story if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="5.069">there yet it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so important and</text>
  <text start="180.239" dur="4.731">I&amp;#39;ve maintained since the beginning that</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="5.761">this dude is is I&amp;#39;m nearly I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="184.97" dur="5.11">leaning towards him being also a plant</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="4.05">inside of the Trump campaign and a lot</text>
  <text start="190.08" dur="4.35">of people disagree with me on that but</text>
  <text start="191.58" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s evidence to show that that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="194.43" dur="4.13">case let&amp;#39;s start on this statement of a</text>
  <text start="196.89" dur="4.17">sense shall we</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="4.679">why do I keep saying that let&amp;#39;s start on</text>
  <text start="201.06" dur="10.04">the sentencing recommendation I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="7.861">hey yeah yeah okay so on page 2 of this</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="5.02">under offense conduct it says although</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="3.87">the defendants principal offense conduct</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="3.899">is set forth in a statement of the fence</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s why I keep saying it and the</text>
  <text start="220.799" dur="4.351">pre-sentence investigative investigation</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="3.39">report PSR the government notes there</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="4.679">are particular facts to underscore for</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="9.27">purposes of sentencing now the PSR is is</text>
  <text start="229.829" dur="11.461">unavailable it is it is being held under</text>
  <text start="235.92" dur="9.629">seal so we can&amp;#39;t see it but we know that</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="8.279">the other day a motion was filed for</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="5.701">discovery in the case I reported on that</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="6.6">on my channel and then now we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="7.07">this so he goes on to say a bunch of</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="4.181">things in here but most importantly</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="4.53">second</text>
  <text start="260.35" dur="4.09">before answering questions the defendant</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="3.72">was expressly warned that it&amp;#39;s a crime</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="3.93">to lie to federal investigators the</text>
  <text start="266.57" dur="3.33">agents told the defendant the only thing</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="2.85">we ask from you is that you&amp;#39;re truthful</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="3.03">with us and the only way you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="3.96">in trouble today is if you do lie to us</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="4.769">the agents told the defendant that they</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="5.51">were both FBI agents and that means</text>
  <text start="277.699" dur="5.31">lying to us as a federal offense before</text>
  <text start="280.69" dur="3.64">proceeding with substantive questions</text>
  <text start="283.009" dur="3.75">the agents stressed again that the</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="7.2">interview was completely voluntary told</text>
  <text start="286.759" dur="6.151">the defendant if he ever became</text>
  <text start="291.53" dur="3.24">uncomfortable they would take a break</text>
  <text start="292.91" dur="3.36">and re-emphasize the only thing we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="4.829">want is disinformation because it would</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="7.89">make our job a lot harder if we go down</text>
  <text start="299.599" dur="6.69">to the last paragraph here the defendant</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="3.93">lied about his contacts with Russian and</text>
  <text start="306.289" dur="3.69">Russian intermediaries during the course</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="3.27">of the campaign to minimize his own role</text>
  <text start="309.979" dur="3.361">as a witness and the extent of the</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="4.38">campaign&amp;#39;s knowledge of his contacts as</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="5.07">described in detail in the statement of</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="5.13">offense and the PSR while serving as a</text>
  <text start="318.41" dur="4.53">policy advisor to the Trump campaign the</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="5.37">defendant met a professor of diplomacy</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="5.82">in London Mifsud who introduced the</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="4.26">defendant to a Russian woman and a</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="3.68">Russian national connected to the</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="4.05">Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs the</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="4.87">professor told the defendant that the</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="5.64">Russian had dirt on Hillary Clinton in</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="4.44">the form of thousands of emails and the</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="3.24">defendant had a series of communications</text>
  <text start="341.75" dur="2.34">over a period of months with the</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="3.269">professor</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="4.62">the female Russian Air National and the</text>
  <text start="346.699" dur="4.201">Russia an mfa connection in which they</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.87">discussed a reading a meeting between</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="7.65">Russian officials in the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="6.85">the problem here is that and I&amp;#39;ll cite</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="8.28">some articles that you can look to for</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="8.479">these details below he never talks to</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="10.35">the campaign at all anywhere ever</text>
  <text start="369.909" dur="10.661">mentions never these emails as a staffer</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="4.89">on the Trump campaign one would expect</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="3.75">that he would run to the campaign and</text>
  <text start="382.07" dur="4.52">say hey guys we&amp;#39;ve got dirt on Clinton</text>
  <text start="384.32" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ve got her emails there available</text>
  <text start="386.59" dur="5.77">that never happens</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="5.04">never he never mentions it once what</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="3.48">does he do he talks</text>
  <text start="394.1" dur="3.96">to Memphis it about it and then he tries</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="3.99">to set up meetings with the Trump</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="6">campaign and Russian officials which</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="10.08">never go through so this is interesting</text>
  <text start="404.06" dur="7.44">to me this next paragraph rather than</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="3.48">acknowledging these contacts and</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="4.44">communications the defendant concealed</text>
  <text start="413.39" dur="5.46">them from the FBI he lied about their</text>
  <text start="415.94" dur="5.4">timing extent and nature with respect to</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="4.11">timing the defendant acknowledged that</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="3.42">the professor had told him about the</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="4.47">Russians possessing quote dirt on</text>
  <text start="424.76" dur="4.77">Clinton but stated multiple times that</text>
  <text start="427.43" dur="4.47">this occurred before he joined the Trump</text>
  <text start="429.53" dur="4.2">campaign and that it was a very strange</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="4.11">coincidence to be told of the dirt</text>
  <text start="433.73" dur="5.43">before he started working for the</text>
  <text start="436.01" dur="5.04">campaign as the defendant well knew this</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="4.05">account was false the defendant met the</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="5.31">professor for the first time on ER about</text>
  <text start="443.21" dur="4.59">March 14 2016 after the defendant had</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="3.9">already learned he would be a foreign</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="4.32">policy adviser for the Trump campaign he</text>
  <text start="450.26" dur="3.69">showed interest only after learning of</text>
  <text start="452.12" dur="3.78">his role on the campaign and the</text>
  <text start="453.95" dur="3.72">professor told the defendant about the</text>
  <text start="455.9" dur="4.65">Russians possessing dirt on Clinton in</text>
  <text start="457.67" dur="7.05">late April 2016 a month after the</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="6.03">defendant had joined the campaign so</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="4.56">Papadopoulos is claiming that this</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="4.5">contact occurred in February it seems to</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="4.86">me the Special Counsel is placing a very</text>
  <text start="471.08" dur="6.3">strong a very strong focus on this</text>
  <text start="474.14" dur="6.15">in-person meeting which to me basically</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="4.83">like discounts any possible electronic</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="3.33">correspondence they could have had or or</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="12.29">doesn&amp;#39;t pay attention to it I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>

  <text start="627.54" dur="4.92">between the campaign staffers are</text>
  <text start="630.3" dur="4.41">like basically upset the Papadopoulos is</text>
  <text start="632.46" dur="4.23">taking all of this initiative on his own</text>
  <text start="634.71" dur="3.87">to go on all these trips and bla bla bla</text>
  <text start="636.69" dur="4.17">bla bla and he goes to the campaign and</text>
  <text start="638.58" dur="5.04">asks for reimbursement on them and the</text>
  <text start="640.86" dur="4.41">campaign says sorry you didn&amp;#39;t ask</text>
