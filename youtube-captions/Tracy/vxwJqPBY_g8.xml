  <text start="65.159" dur="5.701">if we don&amp;#39;t continue to put pressure and</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="4.44">demand and then take things wherever</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="4.77">they logically go depending you know who</text>

  <text start="84.45" dur="4.59">my job is to give you the information</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="5.88">and begin to formulate a plan but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="4.259">gonna bring you the information and so</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="4.799">let&amp;#39;s just summarize what happened to</text>
  <text start="93.299" dur="4.741">general Flynn in January of 2017</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="3.75">during the transition Flynn was on</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="4.17">vacation in the Dominican Republic the</text>
  <text start="100.259" dur="4.951">Obama administration had just levied</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="5.1">horribly horribly restrictive sanctions</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="5.85">on the unit on on Russia for interfering</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="5.489">in the United States election the Trump</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="3.83">administration didn&amp;#39;t have any intention</text>
  <text start="112.799" dur="3.991">of continuing to carry those out so</text>
  <text start="114.89" dur="3.88">Michael Flynn got on the phone with</text>
  <text start="116.79" dur="3.509">Sergey kis lyac who&amp;#39;s the ambassador to</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="4.349">the United States of America from Russia</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="4.741">and basically asked him if he could hold</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="3.871">off on retaliation of those sanctions</text>
  <text start="125.04" dur="4.589">because when the new administration took</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="4.91">took over in a few days they were going</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="4.171">to have a different tact about it</text>
  <text start="131.9" dur="4.78">perfectly legal</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="4.59">conversation nothing wrong there is a</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="3.36">discrepancy about whether or not he</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="3.3">talked to Mike Pence about the right</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="3.18">thing Mike Pence went on the media and</text>
  <text start="141.69" dur="2.07">said one thing that&amp;#39;s not what really</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="2.46">happened</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s why general Flynn was let go</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="5.1">because of that discrepancy I&amp;#39;m not here</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="3.66">to get into the semantics of why he was</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="5.09">fired I personally don&amp;#39;t think he should</text>
  <text start="152.52" dur="7.29">have been but hey it is what it is so</text>
  <text start="155.87" dur="7.75">after that phone call general Flynn was</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="6.5">unmasked illegally by Sally Yates and</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="5.19">that phone call was leaked to the media</text>
  <text start="166.31" dur="4.81">that&amp;#39;s illegal I&amp;#39;m just letting you guys</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="4.83">know again another illegal thing that</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="6.15">they did the media reports on the</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="5.82">conversation they and this is another</text>
  <text start="177.27" dur="4.11">case of the government leaking things to</text>
  <text start="179.46" dur="4.02">the media to bolster the credibility of</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="5.28">what&amp;#39;s going on it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a circular</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="5.1">relationship the media is the propaganda</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="4.05">arm of the United States government we</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="5.7">saw a gazillion times where the dossier</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="6.27">was further substantiated quote by the</text>
  <text start="194.28" dur="5.459">media and then used that substantiate</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="4.14">circular reference basically to then go</text>
  <text start="199.739" dur="3.031">in front of the FISA Court to get a FISA</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="3.72">warrant because hey the media reported</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="2.79">it - but the source is the same you guys</text>
  <text start="204.84" dur="2.57">understand</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="3.929">so they&amp;#39;re basically layering on</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="4.06">justification and validation because the</text>
  <text start="209.489" dur="3.901">media is reporting on it when meanwhile</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="3.63">the media are just puppets on the string</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="4.83">parroting whatever it is the government</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="4.29">wants them to parrot it&amp;#39;s gross in my</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="3.12">speech at the American priority</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="4.02">conference I talked about operation</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="4.32">Mockingbird and the CIA&amp;#39;s infiltration</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="3.6">of the United States media and how</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ve been they&amp;#39;ve been using the</text>
  <text start="227.01" dur="3.9">media as a propaganda arm of</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="7.44">intelligence for decades now since the</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="7.079">late early 50&amp;#39;s so back to Flynn that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="5.25">illegal so it all comes out in the media</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="5.401">I did a thread at the time where I</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="3.57">talked about the fact that Flynn read</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="3.9">about his own conversation in the media</text>
  <text start="245.1" dur="5.73">before these FBI agents went to question</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="8.16">him so disgraced FBI deputy director</text>
  <text start="250.83" dur="6.06">McCabe directs directs his basically</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="4.44">working with Comey we&amp;#39;ve now found</text>
  <text start="256.89" dur="5.07">direct the agents to the he calls Flynn</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="3.63">he talks to Flynn and he says there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.96" dur="3.3">something I got to talk to you about we</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="2.22">got to send some agents over to talk to</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="1.76">you</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="3.2">I don&amp;#39;t even recommend</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="3.359">bring an attorney they don&amp;#39;t have to get</text>
  <text start="268.94" dur="3.15">the Justice Department involved and</text>
  <text start="270.379" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;ll be a whole big process I just have</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="4.74">a couple questions and Flynn replies to</text>
  <text start="274.039" dur="5.451">him and says you guys had my call with</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="5.16">kis lyac you know what I said in there</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="4.419">so general Flynn knows they have the</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="4.32">transcript of what was said he knows</text>
  <text start="283.909" dur="4.111">they have it he knows not only that the</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="3.169">media&amp;#39;s reported that they have it and</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="4.92">that he&amp;#39;s been cleared of any wrongdoing</text>
  <text start="289.479" dur="4.961">so Flynn accepts the FBI agents to come</text>
  <text start="292.94" dur="3.18">inside and have a talk with them he</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="2.969">talks to him the FBI agents which were</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="3.389">Peter struck and patanki</text>
  <text start="297.409" dur="4.44">I believe you pronounce his name go back</text>
  <text start="299.509" dur="4.5">they write up their 302s in January and</text>
  <text start="301.849" dur="4.41">they say no there&amp;#39;s no visual clue that</text>
  <text start="304.009" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s lying even though you know we</text>
  <text start="306.259" dur="3.121">didn&amp;#39;t tell him that he shouldn&amp;#39;t lie to</text>
  <text start="307.729" dur="2.94">us and we didn&amp;#39;t tell him why we were</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="3.509">there and we told him he shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="310.669" dur="4.381">an attorney and we kind of tried to jog</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="4.471">his memory by using the exact words that</text>
  <text start="315.05" dur="4.41">he used in the transcript to jog his</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="3.6">memory about what he said I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="3.739">he was we don&amp;#39;t think that he was</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="7.44">purposefully lying to us about anything</text>
  <text start="323.199" dur="7.631">we don&amp;#39;t think that James Comey</text>
  <text start="328.4" dur="4.38">apparently says you know what we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="330.83" dur="4.29">need to follow any process here let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="4.319">just send these FBI agents over to Flynn</text>
  <text start="335.12" dur="5.639">because this administration is in such</text>
  <text start="337.099" dur="6.241">disarray that we don&amp;#39;t need we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="340.759" dur="3.871">need to have a process followed here we</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="3.329">can sneak him right through the front</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="4.8">door and nobody will look and he kind of</text>
  <text start="346.669" dur="4.231">has his cocky grin on his face when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="2.489">talking about this and I know you guys</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="2.489">in the comments right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.919" dur="7.11">furiously typing away about how</text>
  <text start="353.389" dur="7.381">disgusting this entire situation is so</text>
  <text start="359.029" dur="4.73">Comey brags about it on TV the other day</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="6.869">I&amp;#39;m sure you guys have all seen the clip</text>
  <text start="363.759" dur="5.41">when Flynn has his sentencing has been</text>
  <text start="367.639" dur="3.481">postponed for goodness knows how long</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="3.631">and from the dawn of time Nick cell</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="4.079">Comey Finch</text>
  <text start="372.8" dur="4.229">we used to be named redacted stellt Jeff</text>
  <text start="375.199" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ve all been talking about these 302s</text>
  <text start="377.029" dur="3.961">and how important they are and if you</text>
  <text start="379.039" dur="4.62">listen to the dark to light podcast</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="4.44">yesterday I talked about an article from</text>
  <text start="383.659" dur="3.63">Jeff at the markets work where before</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="4.44">these documents were submitted by the</text>
  <text start="387.289" dur="7.38">government he came up with a brilliant</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="8.25">brilliant theory so Flynn submits his</text>
  <text start="394.669" dur="5.851">sentencing response and inside of it he</text>
  <text start="398.12" dur="2.88">casually drops this information I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="3.3">just shared</text>
  <text start="401" dur="6.39">with you about mccabe and the 302s what</text>
  <text start="403.82" dur="9.09">he&amp;#39;s referencing inside of there is a</text>
  <text start="407.39" dur="8.82">302 from August August 17th and the way</text>
  <text start="412.91" dur="7.43">the 302 is written is not as though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="8.13">a 302 of the destruct petanque a--</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="5.83">interview with flynn it&amp;#39;s written as</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="5.58">though it&amp;#39;s a 302 of somebody</text>
  <text start="426.17" dur="17.55">interviewing them and it turns out that</text>
  <text start="429.92" dur="15.9">that&amp;#39;s true so for some reason we get</text>
  <text start="443.72" dur="6.06">this in the government&amp;#39;s response to</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="8.04">these struck was interviewed on July 19</text>
  <text start="449.78" dur="5.61">2017 in relation to other matters not as</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="3.48">part of the investigation of the</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="4.59">defendant or any investigation of strux</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="4.62">conduct so the basically saying struck</text>
  <text start="459.98" dur="4.8">was was just being interviewed as a</text>
  <text start="461.96" dur="6.84">process now judge Emmett Sullivan is</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="6.6">known for prosecuting the government for</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="4.619">going after senator Ted Stevens in in a</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="5.25">completely disgusting aberration of</text>
  <text start="473.419" dur="4.471">justice and basically throwing his case</text>
  <text start="476.63" dur="3.48">out because the government didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="477.89" dur="3.96">provide exculpatory evidence to him</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="3.9">disculpa Tory meaning evidence that</text>
  <text start="481.85" dur="3.93">could clear him of wrongdoing and so now</text>
  <text start="484.01" dur="5.159">he starts every case with a mandate a</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="5.61">Brady Brady mandate that the government</text>
  <text start="489.169" dur="5.31">provide any exculpatory evidence to a</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="4.71">defendant in the beginning so he&amp;#39;s put a</text>
  <text start="494.479" dur="3.721">couple of these orders on make sure you</text>
  <text start="496.1" dur="5.19">give this defendant exculpatory evidence</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="4.83">about his case now everybody&amp;#39;s asking</text>
  <text start="501.29" dur="3.45">how come judge Sullivan hasn&amp;#39;t seen this</text>
  <text start="503.03" dur="4.11">well the reason why is because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="3.57">plea and my thought is and then I know</text>
  <text start="507.14" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s a ton of attorneys in the</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="5.52">audience is that they did the the since</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="5.22">Michael Glenn was pleading guilty for</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="4.98">some reason since he was pleading guilty</text>
  <text start="516.77" dur="3.389">he didn&amp;#39;t need to see the judge didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="3.57">need to see the exculpatory evidence</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="3.451">that the defendant did in order to know</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="3.24">whether or not he should plead innocent</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="4.2">or guilty and I think it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="525.62" dur="3.96">telling that that governor general</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="4.44">Flynn&amp;#39;s attorneys in general and waited</text>
  <text start="529.58" dur="3.99">till the last minute until after the</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="2.34">government showed their hand and said</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="2.73">this guy&amp;#39;s been really</text>
  <text start="534.59" dur="5.52">cooperative he doesn&amp;#39;t deserve any jail</text>
  <text start="536.3" dur="4.74">time here it is we don&amp;#39;t want him to</text>
  <text start="540.11" dur="3.18">have any jail time he&amp;#39;s been an</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="4.32">excellent cooperative witness with the</text>
  <text start="543.29" dur="5.31">government and Flynn Wallops the court</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="4.98">with this Wallops them because in here</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="4.38">the government admits that that he</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="4.65">wasn&amp;#39;t lying he they admitted they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="552.98" dur="4.32">charging him with lying they created</text>
  <text start="554.99" dur="4.41">this crime just by virtue of talking to</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="4.95">him in the first place it&amp;#39;s a circular</text>
