  <text start="159.37" dur="5.59">not this not this it was this so the</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="2.93">first thing that I wanted to talk to you</text>
  <text start="164.96" dur="4.32">about was giving you a little tutorial</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="5.17">possibly in case you don&amp;#39;t know let me</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="5.4">pull up my chat window again in case you</text>
  <text start="171.71" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t know of how these FOIA releases</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="4.29">work and what all of this stuff means I</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys are aware so I</text>
  <text start="178.97" dur="5.31">might as well just tell you what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="6.27">going to do is tell you what sections of</text>
  <text start="184.28" dur="4.86">what what what reasons are given for the</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="5.1">redactions in the places where things</text>
  <text start="189.14" dur="4.8">are redacted and you can take a look at</text>
  <text start="192.38" dur="3.48">the form that they give on the front and</text>
  <text start="193.94" dur="3.42">then they give you a table in most of</text>
  <text start="195.86" dur="4.77">these FOIA releases that Judicial Watch</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="6.05">releases with the reasons and sometimes</text>
  <text start="200.63" dur="5.55">if you sit and you study these documents</text>
  <text start="203.41" dur="5.56">the reasons that they withhold</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="5.67">information can tell a story all in in</text>
  <text start="208.97" dur="5.07">and of themselves so if they say this</text>
  <text start="211.85" dur="5.51">this little redaction like let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="214.04" dur="6.63">here this is the 300 choose of Bruce or</text>
  <text start="217.36" dur="6.099">they say this is redacted for like b6</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="4.8">you can look back up at the chart at b6</text>
  <text start="223.459" dur="3.75">and say personnel and medical files and</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="3.15">similar files the disclosure of which</text>
  <text start="227.209" dur="4.591">would constitute a clearly unwarranted</text>
  <text start="228.62" dur="5.07">invasion of personal privacy and then</text>
  <text start="231.8" dur="4.23">they give you further detail in there so</text>
  <text start="233.69" dur="6.74">you can kind of like narrow down what</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="6.3">the heck is going on and figure out</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="4.12">whether or not there&amp;#39;s an ongoing</text>
  <text start="242.33" dur="6.77">investigation or whether or not</text>
  <text start="244.55" dur="4.55">something is being looked at still etc</text>
  <text start="250.33" dur="6.279">hi from New York hi New York and</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="6.3">Oklahoma so okay we&amp;#39;ve got that out of</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="4.561">the way I&amp;#39;m still working on this so</text>
  <text start="258.98" dur="4.89">there may be more to come or maybe not</text>
  <text start="261.17" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m not sure yet but you could see</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s a ton of redactions in here</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="7.56">believe it or not the redactions in here</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="6.99">are not really all that important some</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="3.42">of the things that they read act just</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="3.87">are just like you know what they are</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="3.75">already you know sometimes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.99" dur="3.179">redacting stuff that&amp;#39;s already been</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="3.78">previously released it doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="3.841">sense there&amp;#39;s no rhyme or reason I think</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="4.17">that in and of itself is a complete</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="4.95">issue that we need to look into in terms</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.31">of why it is that the FBI or the DOJ is</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="4.38">releasing documents to people redacting</text>
  <text start="293.69" dur="4.47">things that we already know that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="4.98">released in other documents for example</text>
  <text start="298.16" dur="5.82">there have been a lot of things that</text>
  <text start="300.32" dur="6.39">have been released in the in the page</text>
  <text start="303.98" dur="4.92">and struck text messages there was one</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="4.8">page instruct text message released from</text>
  <text start="308.9" dur="4.98">the IG there was one page instruct text</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="4.469">message release from the comma the</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="5.25">committees I believe and some of them</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="10.621">crossed over as a matter of fact I might</text>
  <text start="319.13" dur="15.41">as well show you this right now I shout</text>
  <text start="326.6" dur="7.94">it out Nick wheel well that&amp;#39;s not good</text>

  <text start="342.89" dur="7.529">things with you guys kind of on the fly</text>

  <text start="350.419" dur="5.011">making it all like you know serious and</text>
  <text start="352.669" dur="5.481">stuff that&amp;#39;s why there we go so this is</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="6.56">a website that I&amp;#39;ve used several times</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="6.61">it is really really well done</text>
  <text start="361.99" dur="4.929">this is called the spy gate project org</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="4.02">and as you can see I just went to Nick&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.919" dur="4.921">Twitter here he&amp;#39;s the one who</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="5.699">contributed to creating this website and</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="4.74">I have found lots of value in this if</text>
  <text start="374.479" dur="5.011">it&amp;#39;s a resource you guys can all use</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="5.52">that you might may enjoy using because</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="5.52">what you can do is literally search the</text>
  <text start="382.1" dur="6.87">struck and Lisa page text messages bind</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="6.27">by words so and by date there&amp;#39;s a slider</text>
  <text start="388.97" dur="5.93">up here if you can see this and you can</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="8.31">slide to narrow down a date range here</text>
  <text start="394.9" dur="7.03">and you can see text between that date</text>
  <text start="399.59" dur="3.9">so for example I was going through the</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="5.7">Bruce or files that were about to go</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="7.05">through together and I was able to</text>
  <text start="407.63" dur="5.67">narrow down the page struck text</text>
  <text start="410.54" dur="4.5">messages to a date range and find things</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="3.81">in there that I needed and also some</text>

  <text start="527.05" dur="10.05">so bear with me we got we got an article</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="6.5">the other day where it was admitted in</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="6.93">the in the Hillary Clinton mid-year exam</text>
  <text start="540.54" dur="7.12">release that the Inspector General put</text>
  <text start="544.03" dur="4.98">together the report and then testified</text>
  <text start="547.66" dur="5.58">in front of the committees and that was</text>
  <text start="549.01" dur="5.82">all oh gosh you&amp;#39;re right clown that was</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a second that</text>
  <text start="554.83" dur="4.62">was all you know that was all put out</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="3.6">there they released it all the other</text>
  <text start="559.45" dur="3.12">night Grassley had that letter and then</text>
  <text start="561.22" dur="3.78">everything was attached to it and then</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="4.26">we got the the the possible Chinese</text>
  <text start="565" dur="3.57">connection and all of that stuff there</text>
  <text start="566.83" dur="3.93">was an article written about it where it</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="4.77">was said that an investigation was</text>
  <text start="570.76" dur="3.21">started because of what was reported in</text>
  <text start="573.34" dur="2.88">the media</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="4.74">and so I did a thread at the time on</text>
  <text start="576.22" dur="5.07">Twitter where I explained how important</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="5.54">it is that the media is honest and has</text>
  <text start="581.29" dur="7.82">integrity because if it doesn&amp;#39;t then</text>
  <text start="584.25" dur="7.72">investigations are started into bull</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="4.66">rather than for real reasons and you</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="3">know that the circular reporting happens</text>
  <text start="593.77" dur="3.54">all the time and they&amp;#39;re investigating</text>
  <text start="594.97" dur="3.78">this as well where somebody will then in</text>
  <text start="597.31" dur="3.18">the intelligence community will leak</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="3.27">something to the media the media will</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="3.81">report on it this happened in the Carter</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="4.92">page FISA and then they&amp;#39;ll wrap it in</text>
  <text start="604.3" dur="4.23">again and they&amp;#39;ll use that to bolster</text>
  <text start="606.94" dur="5.28">the evidence that they were the ones</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="7.53">originally leaking so it&amp;#39;s circular sort</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="6.15">of a circular bolster of whatever sad</text>
  <text start="616.06" dur="4.68">fact pattern they had put for it forward</text>
  <text start="618.37" dur="4.29">to begin with so it&amp;#39;s important that</text>
  <text start="620.74" dur="4.14">even though there have been no arrests</text>
  <text start="622.66" dur="4.83">yet that does not mean by any stretch of</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="4.92">the imagination that we stopped talking</text>
  <text start="627.49" dur="4.53">about this that we stop yelling about it</text>
  <text start="629.8" dur="5.43">that we give up that we wipe our hands</text>
  <text start="632.02" dur="5.61">that we you know walk away that we get</text>
  <text start="635.23" dur="3.84">frustrated yeah we want justice and we</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="3.66">want people to be held accountable</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="3.51">I am still not in a place where I am</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="3">ready to say that I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="3.39">that will happen I do think it will</text>
  <text start="644.29" dur="5.3">happen so I&amp;#39;m not going to be one of</text>
  <text start="645.97" dur="4.97">those people yet however that even if we</text>
  <text start="649.59" dur="2.76">to a point and they start saying they</text>
  <text start="650.94" dur="4.23">declined prosecution they declined</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="5.429">prosecution that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we</text>
  <text start="655.17" dur="4.32">give up and we just say oh well you know</text>
  <text start="657.779" dur="2.641">nothing&amp;#39;s ever gonna happen nothing is</text>
  <text start="659.49" dur="3.3">ever gonna change</text>
  <text start="660.42" dur="4.83">that means that we continue to share</text>
  <text start="662.79" dur="4.59">information and it and teach people</text>
  <text start="665.25" dur="6.12">what&amp;#39;s going on so that we get to a</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="6.36">critical mass where they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="671.37" dur="5.25">choice but to respond and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="673.74" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s all about and that&amp;#39;s why again the</text>
  <text start="676.62" dur="4.98">media is important and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="678.45" dur="5.88">legacy media is a heme a pile of burning</text>
  <text start="681.6" dur="6.33">rubble right now and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="684.33" dur="6.63">taking their place so that&amp;#39;s all I have</text>
  <text start="687.93" dur="4.74">to say about that but anyway the 302s</text>
  <text start="690.96" dur="5.16">came out I explained to you a little bit</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="5.4">about how the redactions are done and or</text>
  <text start="696.12" dur="4.65">why they&amp;#39;re done and what they mean in</text>
  <text start="698.07" dur="4.86">the this document really little or</text>
  <text start="700.77" dur="5.49">nothing there are a few that I wish I</text>
  <text start="702.93" dur="4.92">knew the answer to and I have my thread</text>
  <text start="706.26" dur="6.65">here which I think I&amp;#39;m just gonna pull</text>
  <text start="707.85" dur="7.83">up and show you this way oops</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="5.35">bear with me this is new for me</text>
  <text start="715.68" dur="8.43">again I&amp;#39;ll get used to it eventually so</text>
  <text start="718.26" dur="9.05">here we are there are some really</text>
  <text start="724.11" dur="5.94">important things in here</text>
  <text start="727.31" dur="4.18">Cadillac as we know Kathleen Cadillac</text>
  <text start="730.05" dur="2.85">worked for the State Department and</text>
  <text start="731.49" dur="4.74">Christopher steel was in touch with her</text>
  <text start="732.9" dur="6.66">with his information and John Solomon</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="6.63">reported that Christopher steel in there</text>
  <text start="739.56" dur="6.33">were memos between the FBI and the State</text>
  <text start="742.86" dur="5.37">Department where Jonathan Winer works so</text>
  <text start="745.89" dur="4.08">Christopher steel told Kathleen Cadillac</text>
  <text start="748.23" dur="3.84">about the Russian consulate in Miami</text>
  <text start="749.97" dur="4.77">about Michael Cohen going to Prague and</text>
  <text start="752.07" dur="4.32">all of that stuff and Kubelik must have</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="3.719">run through and checked that stuff out</text>
  <text start="756.39" dur="7.11">and basically doubted the validity of</text>
  <text start="758.459" dur="11.491">Steele&amp;#39;s information okay so because of</text>
  <text start="763.5" dur="8.43">that we know that Cadillac doubted the</text>
  <text start="769.95" dur="4.68">credibility of Christopher steel now</text>
  <text start="771.93" dur="4.529">what what other actions she took or</text>
  <text start="774.63" dur="6.54">didn&amp;#39;t take or if she was in on it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="776.459" dur="6.811">not positive of yet but this release</text>
  <text start="781.17" dur="3.59">here was a big deal so this page</text>
  <text start="783.27" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s very hard to see like this</text>
  <text start="784.76" dur="4.9">basically says or advised Kathleen</text>
  <text start="788.22" dur="3.45">Cadillac Deputy Assistant Secretary</text>
  <text start="789.66" dur="4.44">Bureau of European and Eurasian affairs</text>
  <text start="791.67" dur="4.47">that the u.s. Department of State would</text>
  <text start="794.1" dur="3.57">be meeting blank representatives in</text>
  <text start="796.14" dur="3.45">order to discuss potential Russian</text>
  <text start="797.67" dur="5.04">influence in their upcoming presidential</text>
  <text start="799.59" dur="5.55">elections and I personally feel that</text>
  <text start="802.71" dur="5.22">there is a country underneath that</text>
  <text start="805.14" dur="7.05">redaction and I think that it possibly</text>
  <text start="807.93" dur="7.89">is the United Kingdom because black</text>
  <text start="812.19" dur="10.71">brexit was going on at this time so this</text>
  <text start="815.82" dur="9.69">is what I think it goes on in another</text>
  <text start="822.9" dur="4.53">kind of bombshell way or reminded the</text>
  <text start="825.51" dur="3.99">interviewing agents that Kubelik did</text>
  <text start="827.43" dur="4.02">speak with Steele several times prior to</text>
  <text start="829.5" dur="4.26">the election and believed Steele&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="831.45" dur="7.23">reporting to have generated from mainly</text>
  <text start="833.76" dur="7.38">blank now if we take Bruce ORS testimony</text>
  <text start="838.68" dur="3.75">where he talks about the fact that he</text>
  <text start="841.14" dur="3.15">didn&amp;#39;t know whether or not the</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="3.27">information was verified he didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="844.29" dur="4.11">whether or not the information was</text>
  <text start="845.7" dur="4.68">legitimate excetra and we couple it with</text>
  <text start="848.4" dur="3">what he&amp;#39;s telling them here in February</text>
  <text start="850.38" dur="3.84">of 2017</text>
  <text start="851.4" dur="7.65">that&amp;#39;s a date on this 302 we can surmise</text>
  <text start="854.22" dur="9.87">that I think that she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="859.05" dur="7.26">disinformation or some kind of negative</text>
  <text start="864.09" dur="5.31">mainly bad sources mainly disinformation</text>
  <text start="866.31" dur="4.77">mainly bad intelligence something to</text>
  <text start="869.4" dur="3.69">that effect is underneath this redaction</text>
  <text start="871.08" dur="6.33">here that&amp;#39;s what I really feel like it</text>
  <text start="873.09" dur="6.9">is I want to see it I don&amp;#39;t know why we</text>
  <text start="877.41" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t see it yet if I investigated these</text>
  <text start="879.99" dur="3.8">redaction notes I probably would be able</text>
  <text start="881.64" dur="8.04">to find out but I haven&amp;#39;t gotten there</text>
  <text start="883.79" dur="8.2">Christopher steel in this is again in in</text>
  <text start="889.68" dur="5.22">February of 2017 before the special</text>
  <text start="891.99" dur="7.59">counsel was appointed but and before Jim</text>
  <text start="894.9" dur="9.47">Comey was fired but hey Christopher</text>
  <text start="899.58" dur="4.79">steel says here that</text>
  <text start="906.06" dur="11.19">he thinks that he&amp;#39;s gonna be working</text>
  <text start="910.71" dur="8.49">with the FBI even after he&amp;#39;s been canned</text>
  <text start="917.25" dur="4.62">as a source and his business is tanking</text>
  <text start="919.2" dur="5.61">because the the dossier was released by</text>
  <text start="921.87" dur="5.13">BuzzFeed in January so here it says</text>
  <text start="924.81" dur="5">steals company is continuing to work for</text>
  <text start="927" dur="5.97">both blank another attorney for blank</text>
  <text start="929.81" dur="4.24">however or explained steals beginning to</text>
  <text start="932.97" dur="3.72">worry about his business and was</text>
  <text start="934.05" dur="5.22">preparing a blank contract I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="936.69" dur="6.39">to broker a business relationship with</text>
  <text start="939.27" dur="6.26">the FBI Steele advised or quote you may</text>
  <text start="943.08" dur="6.72">see Miriam urge in a couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="945.53" dur="7.03">well for goodness sakes in February of</text>
  <text start="949.8" dur="4.77">2017 listen this is what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="952.56" dur="4.47">about why I don&amp;#39;t understand I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="954.57" dur="4.77">little bit confused about why this</text>
  <text start="957.03" dur="4.89">hasn&amp;#39;t gotten more attention because</text>
  <text start="959.34" dur="4.11">this is after the dossier is published</text>
  <text start="961.92" dur="3.24">this is after people start doing the</text>
  <text start="963.45" dur="3.6">research until what it says and the fact</text>
  <text start="965.16" dur="4.32">that it&amp;#39;s complete disinformation this</text>
  <text start="967.05" dur="4.38">is after as much of a fraud as he is</text>
  <text start="969.48" dur="3.93">Cohen says I was never in Prague look at</text>
  <text start="971.43" dur="5.82">my passport kind of turn on my light</text>
  <text start="973.41" dur="6.33">here and here Christopher Steele is</text>
  <text start="977.25" dur="5.13">talking to Bruce or saying hey I might</text>
  <text start="979.74" dur="4.35">actually be working again with the with</text>
  <text start="982.38" dur="3.72">the FBI just and you&amp;#39;ll see me in a</text>
  <text start="984.09" dur="4.25">little bit Stan law it&amp;#39;ll be fine it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="986.1" dur="2.24">be fine</text>
  <text start="989.48" dur="6.31">remember this is also during the time</text>
  <text start="992.28" dur="7.41">period where he is</text>
  <text start="995.79" dur="7.02">um Steele is working with Adam Waldman</text>
  <text start="999.69" dur="7.08">the attorney who represented Deripaska</text>
  <text start="1002.81" dur="7.53">and Assange and is Waldman is talking to</text>
  <text start="1006.77" dur="9.05">Mark Warner vice-chairman on the Senate</text>
  <text start="1010.34" dur="8.13">Judiciary Committee at the time about a</text>
  <text start="1015.82" dur="5.02">back-channel to have Steele talk off the</text>
  <text start="1018.47" dur="5.4">record and not being putting things in</text>
  <text start="1020.84" dur="4.92">writing and this is also I think around</text>
  <text start="1023.87" dur="4.05">the time that James Comey is trying to</text>
  <text start="1025.76" dur="4.2">broker the immunity deal with Assange</text>
  <text start="1027.92" dur="3.6">and then Assange says he wants to you</text>
  <text start="1029.96" dur="4.65">know kind of provide all his evidence</text>
  <text start="1031.52" dur="4.62">about Russia and then Comey says I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1034.61" dur="3.27">care if you release the vault seven</text>
  <text start="1036.14" dur="2.819">files I don&amp;#39;t you know none of that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1037.88" dur="5.1">coming out</text>
  <text start="1038.959" dur="6.811">Oh somebody in the chat is right now</text>
  <text start="1042.98" dur="5.49">asking why they why is Bruce or still</text>
  <text start="1045.77" dur="4.86">working because if he&amp;#39;s cooperating</text>
  <text start="1048.47" dur="3.689">which I think that he probably is and</text>
  <text start="1050.63" dur="6.24">I&amp;#39;ll explain why I believe that in a</text>
  <text start="1052.159" dur="8.431">moment it is much easier for him or for</text>
  <text start="1056.87" dur="5.85">them to keep him in occupation paying</text>
  <text start="1060.59" dur="5.04">him under the rules of the Justice</text>
  <text start="1062.72" dur="5.069">Department in some position somewhere he</text>
  <text start="1065.63" dur="4.289">still has constitutional rights so they</text>
  <text start="1067.789" dur="5.281">can&amp;#39;t stop him from pleading the fifth</text>
  <text start="1069.919" dur="5.101">but there&amp;#39;s a lot easier it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1073.07" dur="5.099">easier for the inspector general and</text>
  <text start="1075.02" dur="5.759">other government you know inspector or</text>
  <text start="1078.169" dur="4.831">government investigators to get</text>
  <text start="1080.779" dur="4.53">information from him by using his job as</text>
  <text start="1083" dur="4.08">leverage or pressure so if he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="1085.309" dur="4.051">to keep himself out of trouble and they</text>
  <text start="1087.08" dur="4.589">want to keep him talking it is likely</text>
  <text start="1089.36" dur="5.88">that they have him still working for</text>
  <text start="1091.669" dur="5.791">that reason there&amp;#39;s that so this part</text>
  <text start="1095.24" dur="6.12">really blows me away and I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1097.46" dur="5.43">to this day understand why why no not</text>
  <text start="1101.36" dur="4.169">more people are talking about the fact</text>
  <text start="1102.89" dur="5.07">that it appears from Bruce ores 302s</text>
  <text start="1105.529" dur="4.441">that Christopher steel was negotiating a</text>
  <text start="1107.96" dur="10.5">contract to work with the FBI as late as</text>
  <text start="1109.97" dur="14.1">February of 2017 I&amp;#39;m just waiting for</text>

  <text start="1237.21" dur="9.51">was was still working with Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="1242.61" dur="7.89">as per this 302 as late as May 10th 2017</text>
  <text start="1246.72" dur="6.329">and why is that important let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="1250.5" dur="4.32">about it for a second first of all there</text>
  <text start="1253.049" dur="6.421">was a lawsuit that went on overseas</text>
  <text start="1254.82" dur="7.53">because there was a gentleman whose name</text>
  <text start="1259.47" dur="6.329">is escaping me right now who sued for</text>
  <text start="1262.35" dur="5.069">defamation because steel had talked</text>
  <text start="1265.799" dur="4.681">about I think it was in the December</text>
  <text start="1267.419" dur="5.341">memo steel had basically said that he by</text>
  <text start="1270.48" dur="4.53">name was guilty of working with the FSB</text>
  <text start="1272.76" dur="3.69">and he had owned a lot of companies and</text>
  <text start="1275.01" dur="3.06">he lost a lot of business so he sued</text>
  <text start="1276.45" dur="3.3">steel for defamation both here in the</text>
  <text start="1278.07" dur="3.719">United States and BuzzFeed by the way</text>
  <text start="1279.75" dur="6.419">both here in the United States as well</text>
  <text start="1281.789" dur="6.211">as overseas so the issue here is that in</text>
  <text start="1286.169" dur="5.49">the testimony that he gave under oath to</text>
  <text start="1288" dur="5.88">both the UK and and the they then took</text>
  <text start="1291.659" dur="4.351">that UK testimony and used it here in</text>
  <text start="1293.88" dur="5.82">the States in that court case as well it</text>
  <text start="1296.01" dur="5.82">states that there was another memo that</text>
  <text start="1299.7" dur="5.01">came out in the dossier that was written</text>
  <text start="1301.83" dur="7.82">December of 2016 after the election had</text>

  <text start="1570.149" dur="8.63">to show you it now it was released on</text>

  <text start="1596.059" dur="5.37">summary at least the past three or four</text>
  <text start="1597.919" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ve gotten it&amp;#39;s the subject was</text>
  <text start="1601.429" dur="6.031">referred for criminal prosecution and</text>
  <text start="1603.679" dur="5.61">the DOJ declined to prosecute right well</text>
  <text start="1607.46" dur="4.11">on this one that&amp;#39;s not what it says it</text>
  <text start="1609.289" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t say that at all it actually just</text>
  <text start="1611.57" dur="3.809">says the OIG has completed its</text>
  <text start="1613.309" dur="6.271">investigation and provided its report to</text>
  <text start="1615.379" dur="7.02">the FBI for appropriate action that was</text>
  <text start="1619.58" dur="6.029">interesting to me what it says is the</text>
  <text start="1622.399" dur="5.88">OIG found that as a result of conduct by</text>
  <text start="1625.609" dur="5.94">two current senior FBI officials as of</text>
  <text start="1628.279" dur="5.85">January and one retired FBI official the</text>

  <text start="1636.789" dur="3.931">contravention of the Federal Acquisition</text>
  <text start="1638.96" dur="3.99">regulations which is the far</text>
  <text start="1640.72" dur="4.449">additionally the OIG found that these</text>
  <text start="1642.95" dur="3.959">three FBI officials didn&amp;#39;t in he oh he</text>
  <text start="1645.169" dur="3.271">adhere to Office of Management and</text>
  <text start="1646.909" dur="3.99">Budget policy while managing the</text>

  <text start="1652.759" dur="7.8">conflict of interest rules under the far</text>
  <text start="1654.499" dur="8.04">now I did a lot of work I&amp;#39;d done a lot</text>
  <text start="1660.559" dur="4.291">of research and I think I nailed down</text>
  <text start="1662.539" dur="5.551">what this means and it has to do with</text>
  <text start="1664.85" dur="5.399">fusion GPS being a government contractor</text>
  <text start="1668.09" dur="5.399">and performing what is an inherent</text>
  <text start="1670.249" dur="7.14">governmental function operating in a</text>

  <text start="1682.58" dur="4.76">I was able to able to further validate</text>

  <text start="2234.79" dur="6">no idea um another points that I make in</text>
  <text start="2238.54" dur="5.73">this thread is that they did not redact</text>
  <text start="2240.79" dur="6.12">Glenn Simpson&amp;#39;s name in one place which</text>
  <text start="2244.27" dur="6.3">was telling to me it either means that</text>

  <text start="2254.32" dur="3.98">another reason for it I don&amp;#39;t know which</text>

  <text start="2273.55" dur="6.3">provided and and they were in a list</text>
  <text start="2276.01" dur="9">from Grassley here to the FBI asking for</text>
  <text start="2279.85" dur="8.85">them the dates are all provided they go</text>

  <text start="2288.7" dur="6.78">stop and Bruce or had testified that he</text>
  <text start="2291.25" dur="5.79">did sit with agents after that but he</text>
  <text start="2295.48" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t even know apparently</text>
  <text start="2297.04" dur="6.12">they were taking these 302s at all which</text>
  <text start="2299.17" dur="5.76">is really interesting to me I think he</text>
  <text start="2303.16" dur="4.98">was stunned that they documented this</text>
  <text start="2304.93" dur="4.41">given what they were doing which if you</text>
  <text start="2308.14" dur="3.45">think about that for a minute it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2309.34" dur="4.8">pretty amazing and it answers the</text>
  <text start="2311.59" dur="4.98">question in Bruce ORS testimony in the</text>

  <text start="2323.74" dur="6.18">place yourself into the chain of custody</text>
  <text start="2325.96" dur="5.88">here what makes you think that that was</text>
  <text start="2329.92" dur="8.31">a possibly something that you should do</text>
  <text start="2331.84" dur="8.25">as a you know as a career prosecutor and</text>
  <text start="2338.23" dur="3">he has no answer he doesn&amp;#39;t really have</text>
  <text start="2340.09" dur="2.58">any answer I just wanted to get the</text>
  <text start="2341.23" dur="3.12">information I just wanted to get the</text>
  <text start="2342.67" dur="4.2">information I wanted to make sure they</text>
  <text start="2344.35" dur="4.62">got the information I think that that he</text>
  <text start="2346.87" dur="4.26">didn&amp;#39;t realize that he was being</text>
  <text start="2348.97" dur="5.34">documented at the time and there have</text>
  <text start="2351.13" dur="5.76">been a lot of assumptions about who it</text>
  <text start="2354.31" dur="4.83">is that took these 302s down with people</text>
  <text start="2356.89" dur="3.66">saying it was Gaeta people saying was PN</text>
  <text start="2359.14" dur="4.68">qey because they were assigned as his</text>
  <text start="2360.55" dur="5.76">handlers but there are no there are no</text>
  <text start="2363.82" dur="4.47">names on here we don&amp;#39;t know which</text>
  <text start="2366.31" dur="3.84">special agents took these</text>
  <text start="2368.29" dur="4.68">oh I&amp;#39;m not making any assumptions about</text>
  <text start="2370.15" dur="4.89">that yet just because it&amp;#39;s not clear it</text>
  <text start="2372.97" dur="4.61">could have been other ones that he said</text>
  <text start="2375.04" dur="7.53">that he talked to outside of those two</text>
  <text start="2377.58" dur="6.73">PN Co was the same agent that went and</text>
  <text start="2382.57" dur="3.24">interviewed Flynn which we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="2384.31" dur="5.31">Michael Oh general Flynn at the end of</text>
  <text start="2385.81" dur="18.72">this am i boring anybody or are we all</text>
  <text start="2389.62" dur="17.43">good is everyone good okay the other</text>
  <text start="2404.53" dur="8.24">thing interesting that these dates</text>
  <text start="2407.05" dur="9.48">stopped v 1517 because what happened</text>
  <text start="2412.77" dur="9.43">it&amp;#39;s just a few days later the special</text>
  <text start="2416.53" dur="8.55">counsel was appointed I love you guys I</text>
  <text start="2422.2" dur="4.71">really do with a team like this I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2425.08" dur="7.26">see how we lose you guys are fantastic</text>
  <text start="2426.91" dur="6.9">so the special counsel starts and all of</text>
  <text start="2432.34" dur="3.99">a sudden the rest of the 302s aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2433.81" dur="4.08">included anymore that&amp;#39;s super</text>
  <text start="2436.33" dur="3.63">interesting too because then we know</text>
  <text start="2437.89" dur="4.35">that or may have been working with the</text>
  <text start="2439.96" dur="4.08">special counsel or the agents that were</text>
  <text start="2442.24" dur="3.24">working this were transferred to the</text>
  <text start="2444.04" dur="3.33">special counsel when Peter struck took</text>
  <text start="2445.48" dur="3.39">over at the special counsel which then</text>
  <text start="2447.37" dur="5.1">kind of allows us to thread that needle</text>
  <text start="2448.87" dur="6.06">a little bit better okay there we go</text>
  <text start="2452.47" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s that the other really</text>
  <text start="2454.93" dur="4.05">interesting thing about these 302</text>
  <text start="2456.85" dur="6.2">releases and the other sets of flint of</text>
  <text start="2458.98" dur="4.07">or documents that Judicial Watch got</text>
  <text start="2464.67" dur="4.39">Judicial Watch was able to settle this</text>
  <text start="2467.5" dur="4.23">lawsuit with the government what usually</text>
  <text start="2469.06" dur="4.35">happens in cases like like what Judicial</text>
  <text start="2471.73" dur="3.36">Watch does day in and day out every day</text>
  <text start="2473.41" dur="3.72">is a FOIA the government for information</text>
  <text start="2475.09" dur="5.49">what usually happens as they send the</text>
  <text start="2477.13" dur="4.83">FOIA request in and that the government</text>
  <text start="2480.58" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t answer it or they take forever</text>
  <text start="2481.96" dur="4.5">to answer or they deny the FOIA request</text>
  <text start="2484.27" dur="3.96">and then Judicial Watch has to sue them</text>
  <text start="2486.46" dur="3.57">so yes they have to take them to court</text>
  <text start="2488.23" dur="3.33">and they go through this long thing and</text>
  <text start="2490.03" dur="2.88">then the judge has to rule that they</text>
  <text start="2491.56" dur="3.75">have to produce it and then there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2492.91" dur="4.08">production schedule put into place and</text>
  <text start="2495.31" dur="4.95">it takes forever and that&amp;#39;s how a lot of</text>
  <text start="2496.99" dur="5.33">this stuff goes down so in this case at</text>
  <text start="2500.26" dur="8.37">this particular time</text>
  <text start="2502.32" dur="11.23">um what happens actually is that the</text>
  <text start="2508.63" dur="7.8">government hold on I&amp;#39;m sorry guys the</text>
  <text start="2513.55" dur="7.62">government settles with Judicial Watch</text>
  <text start="2516.43" dur="6.15">and says you know what yeah we&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="2521.17" dur="3.45">these we&amp;#39;re ready to give these to you</text>
  <text start="2522.58" dur="4.04">guys we&amp;#39;re ready to give you all the</text>
  <text start="2524.62" dur="4.65">documents I&amp;#39;m gonna settle with you guys</text>
  <text start="2526.62" dur="4.69">and you know here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2529.27" dur="5.49">giving you with as minimal redactions as</text>
  <text start="2531.31" dur="6.36">possible and the fact that they settled</text>
  <text start="2534.76" dur="6.51">this rather than it having to be forced</text>
  <text start="2537.67" dur="8.12">out of them given what happened the</text>
  <text start="2541.27" dur="11.73">declassification is really really super</text>
  <text start="2545.79" dur="9.01">poignant to me now the last thing in</text>
  <text start="2553" dur="4.77">these 300 choose that I was able to</text>
  <text start="2554.8" dur="5.19">figure out is that it appears and we</text>
  <text start="2557.77" dur="5.57">searched I mean it could be out there</text>
  <text start="2559.99" dur="6.42">somewhere but I don&amp;#39;t think it is I</text>
  <text start="2563.34" dur="6.37">spend hours and friends of mine spent</text>
  <text start="2566.41" dur="7.19">hours trying to find reporting of this</text>

  <text start="2867.53" dur="4.32">as some corner so I&amp;#39;m sort of like</text>
  <text start="2869.57" dur="5.49">smoking gun that Trump is connected to</text>
  <text start="2871.85" dur="4.53">Russia is is nonsense if you read</text>

  <text start="2893.51" dur="3.45">through my youtube channel and find it</text>
  <text start="2895.07" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;ve done several threads on</text>
  <text start="2896.96" dur="5.01">Felix Eider the fact that he was an</text>
  <text start="2899.75" dur="5.339">intelligence asset very high-level</text>
  <text start="2901.97" dur="6.81">intelligence asset he was shielded by</text>
  <text start="2905.089" dur="6.03">Loretta Lynch when she was at the FBI or</text>
  <text start="2908.78" dur="4.2">was a US Attorney I&amp;#39;m sorry it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="2911.119" dur="4.681">long story but basically he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2912.98" dur="4.35">working for the government as were many</text>
  <text start="2915.8" dur="5.46">of the of the other people that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2917.33" dur="7.83">come across in this escapade and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2921.26" dur="10.32">mentioned in here often as sort of a tie</text>
  <text start="2925.16" dur="8.13">back to Trump but it&amp;#39;s not it he it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2931.58" dur="4.259">almost like he was there on purpose just</text>
  <text start="2933.29" dur="3.75">to have the plausible deniability like</text>
  <text start="2935.839" dur="4.471">always friends with this person so</text>
  <text start="2937.04" dur="5.01">obviously then this person oh well and</text>
  <text start="2940.31" dur="3.87">this you know he he&amp;#39;s worked with this</text>
  <text start="2942.05" dur="3.87">Russian so then obviously by extension</text>
  <text start="2944.18" dur="3.179">because he you know has talked to Trump</text>
  <text start="2945.92" dur="7.05">than Trump is guilty of working with</text>
  <text start="2947.359" dur="7.23">this person too so if you read through</text>
  <text start="2952.97" dur="5.04">and you just do a search for sader I</text>
  <text start="2954.589" dur="5.851">found at least 16 in the unspread sheet</text>
  <text start="2958.01" dur="4.23">here where she refers to who the person</text>
  <text start="2960.44" dur="3.84">from Russia is what their Russian name</text>
  <text start="2962.24" dur="4.5">is who they&amp;#39;re you know who would</text>
  <text start="2964.28" dur="2.85">implicate and then I&amp;#39;ll be honest with</text>
  <text start="2966.74" dur="1.74">you</text>
  <text start="2967.13" dur="3.12">looking through the spreadsheet and</text>
  <text start="2968.48" dur="3.869">seeing how she does her work and seeing</text>
  <text start="2970.25" dur="4.32">how she digs her info this is what you</text>
  <text start="2972.349" dur="6.661">guys are doing on a daily basis but like</text>
  <text start="2974.57" dur="6.87">yours is much better like this is how</text>
  <text start="2979.01" dur="6.21">when I research a piece I lay things out</text>
  <text start="2981.44" dur="6.51">and this is supposedly a professional so</text>
  <text start="2985.22" dur="5.879">you guys are doing fantastic fantastic</text>
  <text start="2987.95" dur="6.81">just keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="2991.099" dur="7.981">bay rock is Felix taters company and Bay</text>
  <text start="2994.76" dur="5.82">Rock is an entire animal that we could</text>
  <text start="2999.08" dur="2.94">get into in another video that would</text>
  <text start="3000.58" dur="5.1">just take a really long time to explain</text>
  <text start="3002.02" dur="7.91">but they have a lot of issues let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="3005.68" dur="9.96">say that and Trump basically completely</text>
  <text start="3009.93" dur="7.87">disowned or pushed aside Seder years ago</text>
  <text start="3015.64" dur="4.229">when he was caught up into some gross</text>
  <text start="3017.8" dur="3.99">stuff and Trump got wind of it and said</text>
  <text start="3019.869" dur="4.411">no more say his exact quote was</text>
  <text start="3021.79" dur="4.62">something like sometimes you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3024.28" dur="3.39">somebody until you know them and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3026.41" dur="3.209">want anything to do with that guy</text>
  <text start="3027.67" dur="2.57">anymore and then from there on out it</text>
  <text start="3029.619" dur="1.641">was</text>
  <text start="3030.24" dur="2.7">always like I don&amp;#39;t know who you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3031.26" dur="3.9">talking about Seder I don&amp;#39;t know him at</text>
  <text start="3032.94" dur="3.54">all like and that might be true because</text>
  <text start="3035.16" dur="3.3">I think a lot of the times when Trump</text>
  <text start="3036.48" dur="12.21">says that it means this person&amp;#39;s dead to</text>
  <text start="3038.46" dur="12.21">me so you can get all this stuff on</text>
  <text start="3048.69" dur="3.9">judicial watch&amp;#39;s website and you can dig</text>
  <text start="3050.67" dur="3.99">through it and you can take a look at</text>
  <text start="3052.59" dur="3.51">what what she&amp;#39;s saying and I could sit</text>
  <text start="3054.66" dur="2.97">here and go through all of her research</text>
  <text start="3056.1" dur="4.62">you guys would probably fall asleep and</text>
  <text start="3057.63" dur="5.4">it doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t I just don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="3060.72" dur="4.17">read it all I read it all and while</text>
  <text start="3063.03" dur="6.03">there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s open source research there</text>
  <text start="3064.89" dur="5.97">are there are assumptions in here and</text>
  <text start="3069.06" dur="4.26">speculations in here but when you do</text>
  <text start="3070.86" dur="5.07">open source research here you have to</text>
  <text start="3073.32" dur="4.56">you have to sort of try and weave</text>
  <text start="3075.93" dur="4.7">together the information in some sort of</text>
  <text start="3077.88" dur="7.05">a way she just chose to do it this way</text>
  <text start="3080.63" dur="7.87">Nellie or did and so like reading</text>
  <text start="3084.93" dur="5.04">through it if I were doing her work the</text>
  <text start="3088.5" dur="4.38">way she did it and it&amp;#39;s sitting in her</text>
  <text start="3089.97" dur="5.28">chair let&amp;#39;s just pretend I would not</text>
  <text start="3092.88" dur="5.55">have been able to move forward to prove</text>
  <text start="3095.25" dur="5.1">the like they said look at what you can</text>
  <text start="3098.43" dur="4.32">find about Trump&amp;#39;s ties to Russia and</text>
  <text start="3100.35" dur="5.4">then I did all this work that&amp;#39;s detailed</text>
  <text start="3102.75" dur="4.68">out here with Felix aider and all that</text>
  <text start="3105.75" dur="3.54">stuff and all these pictures and the</text>

  <text start="3298.619" dur="4.051">policy and procedure anymore what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3300.42" dur="4.77">like to be there at Bo P and I&amp;#39;m hearing</text>
  <text start="3302.67" dur="5.01">all this rumor and I have this account</text>
  <text start="3305.19" dur="5.01">on my website here from this guy Scott</text>
  <text start="3307.68" dur="4.23">who was a great man to talk to and I</text>
  <text start="3310.2" dur="3.03">credit him for putting his name out</text>
  <text start="3311.91" dur="3.869">there he showed me his credentials he</text>
  <text start="3313.23" dur="5.099">proved himself that he&amp;#39;s legit and then</text>
  <text start="3315.779" dur="6.661">we have you know I have someone else</text>
  <text start="3318.329" dur="8.52">that I know personally who I was asking</text>
  <text start="3322.44" dur="5.609">these questions to separately and didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3326.849" dur="3.301">know that I had heard he done this</text>
  <text start="3328.049" dur="3.841">because it wasn&amp;#39;t up yet and answered</text>
  <text start="3330.15" dur="6">the same exact way for the most part</text>
  <text start="3331.89" dur="6.75">okay so I know that the information is</text>
  <text start="3336.15" dur="6.09">good because I&amp;#39;ve gotten to confirmed</text>
  <text start="3338.64" dur="6.179">now twice with that being said I still</text>
  <text start="3342.24" dur="4.65">have a gazillion questions about what</text>
  <text start="3344.819" dur="4.53">happened to Jeffrey Epstein I think like</text>
  <text start="3346.89" dur="4.229">all of you do you do and I&amp;#39;m not ready</text>
  <text start="3349.349" dur="4.381">to come to any sort of a conclusion yet</text>
  <text start="3351.119" dur="5.16">on what that might be but I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="3353.73" dur="3.089">to stop trying to find out he was alone</text>
  <text start="3356.279" dur="2.971">in his cell</text>
  <text start="3356.819" dur="4.351">Scott Lyon said that they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3359.25" dur="3.9">like doing that for specifically the</text>
  <text start="3361.17" dur="4.23">reason of self-harm so they really</text>
  <text start="3363.15" dur="6.29">always try to partner people up inside</text>
  <text start="3365.4" dur="8.03">of their cell when you&amp;#39;re a pedophile it</text>
  <text start="3369.44" dur="7.8">is not easy to pair you with somebody</text>
  <text start="3373.43" dur="7.119">because it&amp;#39;s frowned upon in prison</text>
  <text start="3377.24" dur="6.01">culture basically or dynamics as he</text>
  <text start="3380.549" dur="4.26">called them prison dynamics you know you</text>
  <text start="3383.25" dur="3.24">can&amp;#39;t group certain groups together</text>
  <text start="3384.809" dur="3.841">because one group doesn&amp;#39;t like the other</text>
  <text start="3386.49" dur="8.22">group or there&amp;#39;s racism or there&amp;#39;s or</text>
  <text start="3388.65" dur="8.25">whatever it is you can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="3394.71" dur="4.74">certain people together because the risk</text>
  <text start="3396.9" dur="3.899">of the fighting is worse than or the</text>
  <text start="3399.45" dur="3.389">killing that or the murder that way is</text>
  <text start="3400.799" dur="5.52">worse than the suicide risk I asked him</text>
  <text start="3402.839" dur="5.76">how long how many prisoners do they know</text>
  <text start="3406.319" dur="4.74">or does he know that were taken off of</text>
  <text start="3408.599" dur="5.541">suicide watch so quickly after a and</text>
  <text start="3411.059" dur="8.161">attempted suicide as they told us right</text>
  <text start="3414.14" dur="8.919">and he told me that it&amp;#39;s very common he</text>
  <text start="3419.22" dur="6.18">said probably 80% of the time he said</text>
  <text start="3423.059" dur="3.961">that a lot of the times these people are</text>
  <text start="3425.4" dur="3.6">not trying to commit suicide to kill</text>
  <text start="3427.02" dur="3.99">themselves</text>
  <text start="3429" dur="9.03">they&amp;#39;re just doing it for attention to</text>
  <text start="3431.01" dur="17.55">be moved to you know to change their</text>
  <text start="3438.03" dur="13.589">circumstances etc he he also said that</text>
  <text start="3448.56" dur="5.22">you need to get into that facility to</text>
  <text start="3451.619" dur="4.291">get into the hallway you have to open</text>
  <text start="3453.78" dur="3.329">the door from both sides so like there</text>
  <text start="3455.91" dur="2.4">needs to be an agent on the inside of</text>
  <text start="3457.109" dur="2.341">the hallway and one on the outside of</text>
  <text start="3458.31" dur="3.09">the hallway and both of them need to</text>
  <text start="3459.45" dur="3.51">open the door his cell door would have</text>
  <text start="3461.4" dur="3.66">been locked so nobody would have been</text>
  <text start="3462.96" dur="3.57">able to enter without the key and then</text>
  <text start="3465.06" dur="3.21">there were immediate reports that the</text>
  <text start="3466.53" dur="3.329">cameras weren&amp;#39;t working that nothing was</text>
  <text start="3468.27" dur="4.26">being seen on them except razón and so</text>
  <text start="3469.859" dur="5.941">forth and that the logs were falsified</text>
  <text start="3472.53" dur="5.43">and what he told me is there that</text>
  <text start="3475.8" dur="5.48">there&amp;#39;s it would would not be uncommon</text>
  <text start="3477.96" dur="5.88">for these cameras to be malfunctioning</text>
  <text start="3481.28" dur="3.9">because of the budget constraints and</text>
  <text start="3483.84" dur="5.97">things like that that they have however</text>
  <text start="3485.18" dur="6.82">he is sure pretty sure if the reporting</text>
  <text start="3489.81" dur="4.5">was correct that that was not the case</text>
  <text start="3492" dur="4.71">in the cameras were functioning only</text>
  <text start="3494.31" dur="3.99">because they knew that these agents were</text>
  <text start="3496.71" dur="3.81">sleeping on the job and they knew that</text>
  <text start="3498.3" dur="4.35">they falsified the logs and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3500.52" dur="3.75">allowed to have a camera on the cell</text>
  <text start="3502.65" dur="3.9">because of a law called the Prison Rape</text>
  <text start="3504.27" dur="4.319">Enforcement Act which stops you from</text>
  <text start="3506.55" dur="5.069">taping inside of cells so they can only</text>
  <text start="3508.589" dur="4.111">camera the hallway and if the cameras</text>
  <text start="3511.619" dur="2.73">weren&amp;#39;t working there would have been</text>
  <text start="3512.7" dur="3.12">absolutely no way for them to know that</text>
  <text start="3514.349" dur="2.881">these guards fell asleep and that they</text>
  <text start="3515.82" dur="4.74">falsified the Lobb saying that they</text>
  <text start="3517.23" dur="5.67">weren&amp;#39;t theirs that what does that mean</text>
  <text start="3520.56" dur="4.41">it means that unless somebody had the</text>
  <text start="3522.9" dur="3.75">credentials the key whatever to get into</text>
  <text start="3524.97" dur="3.389">these places then there&amp;#39;s no way for</text>
  <text start="3526.65" dur="3.6">them to have been able to do it which</text>
  <text start="3528.359" dur="3.871">eliminates for me the possibility of</text>
  <text start="3530.25" dur="3.75">somebody who was not working there and</text>
  <text start="3532.23" dur="4.17">Scott might get upset with me because</text>
  <text start="3534" dur="3.93">Scott voiced to me that he doesn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3536.4" dur="3.24">that there&amp;#39;s anything that he thinks</text>
  <text start="3537.93" dur="3.57">that the Jeffrey Epstein really killed</text>
  <text start="3539.64" dur="3.99">himself that&amp;#39;s what scott lyon believes</text>
  <text start="3541.5" dur="4.23">from the b o p he doesn&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3543.63" dur="4.709">anything nefarious going on in terms of</text>
  <text start="3545.73" dur="5.4">that he thinks what happens is he told</text>
  <text start="3548.339" dur="4.891">me that he thinks that Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="3551.13" dur="4.83">wasn&amp;#39;t expecting to kill himself and</text>
  <text start="3553.23" dur="5.97">timed his attempt to be when the guards</text>
  <text start="3555.96" dur="4.8">were walking by and then they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3559.2" dur="8.97">walk by</text>
  <text start="3560.76" dur="9.45">and he just went too far um in terms of</text>
  <text start="3568.17" dur="5.76">the broken neck and what Frank said on</text>
  <text start="3570.21" dur="5.28">my on the podcast Frank said that he has</text>
  <text start="3573.93" dur="3.33">a friend that was inside the jail who</text>
  <text start="3575.49" dur="4.14">would have taken custody of Epstein if</text>
  <text start="3577.26" dur="4.29">Epstein had lived and he said that his</text>
  <text start="3579.63" dur="3.78">entire neck was broken all the way</text>
  <text start="3581.55" dur="3.39">around like I forgot the exact words he</text>
  <text start="3583.41" dur="4.41">used it&amp;#39;s on the podcast from yesterday</text>
  <text start="3584.94" dur="5.01">you guys can go and listen to it which</text>
  <text start="3587.82" dur="4.86">adds a whole nother dynamic to this</text>
  <text start="3589.95" dur="4.29">story so there&amp;#39;s that um the one other</text>
  <text start="3592.68" dur="2.01">thing that I wanted to finish up with</text>
  <text start="3594.24" dur="3.15">you</text>
  <text start="3594.69" dur="5.16">Oh the guard not a guard thing let me</text>
  <text start="3597.39" dur="5.01">clear that up as well I asked him if he</text>
  <text start="3599.85" dur="4.8">actually offered that information up</text>
  <text start="3602.4" dur="4.2">very quick very very quickly he said he</text>
  <text start="3604.65" dur="4.86">wanted to clear that up every single</text>
  <text start="3606.6" dur="6.27">employee inside a BLP facility is</text>
  <text start="3609.51" dur="6.47">trained as a correction officer first so</text>
  <text start="3612.87" dur="5.43">even if they end up in the kitchen or in</text>
  <text start="3615.98" dur="8.77">infirmary or wherever they end up they</text>
  <text start="3618.3" dur="10.14">are Donna de lle oh I&amp;#39;m watching they</text>
  <text start="3624.75" dur="8.94">are trained to be a corrections officer</text>

  <text start="3633.69" dur="4.04">like what you would call a normal every</text>
  <text start="3636.06" dur="6.69">day on the job</text>
  <text start="3637.73" dur="7.45">corrections officer it&amp;#39;s still there</text>
  <text start="3642.75" dur="4.95">still trained that way in terms of the</text>
  <text start="3645.18" dur="6.84">jumpsuit the orange jumpsuit that I kind</text>
  <text start="3647.7" dur="6.18">of okay Donna I&amp;#39;m not I can&amp;#39;t stop my</text>

  <text start="3662.55" dur="3.81">policy and procedure on the website you</text>
