  <text start="9.269" dur="5.131">the chair outside but I&amp;#39;m doing one</text>
  <text start="11.519" dur="10.651">today I&amp;#39;m just gonna wait until I see</text>
  <text start="14.4" dur="10.369">some people don&amp;#39;t see any people yet all</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="6.29">right well maybe I&amp;#39;ll just start instead</text>
  <text start="24.769" dur="8.861">social media today was a complete mess</text>
  <text start="28.46" dur="10.029">Twitter basically Bend a lot of people</text>
  <text start="33.63" dur="6.749">for BOTS like activity the follower</text>
  <text start="38.489" dur="3.84">count of so many was diminished by</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="4.081">hundreds of that you know thousands I</text>
  <text start="42.329" dur="6.271">lost three thousand people maybe a</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="7.079">little bit less I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="48.6" dur="5.43">very high up in the subscriber counts on</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="5.311">Twitter lost people lots of people lost</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="5.4">people YouTube rolled out a brand new</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="6.24">set of monetization rules and platform</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="7.1">community platform rules medium deleted</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="10.62">the accounts of several right-leaning</text>
  <text start="66.53" dur="10.93">bloggers that write there and a lot of</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="9.12">this is based on a couple different</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="9.42">things one of them one of the principles</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="7.859">they say is you know hate speech hate</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="8.82">speech well who determines what hate</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="6.421">speech is one day it could be somebody</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="5.82">who agrees with everything that you</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="6.66">think and thinks that basically speech</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="6.419">is free and you should be able to use it</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="8.01">as you feel and you know words don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="9.811">necessarily hurt somebody and the next</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="8.659">day it could be someone like Nancy</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="2.689">Pelosi or</text>
  <text start="121.33" dur="13.72">Adam Schiff or Dianne Feinstein and then</text>
  <text start="130.51" dur="9.25">you couldn&amp;#39;t say anything without being</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="7.68">banned it&amp;#39;s a very slippery slope to go</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="7.92">down right it&amp;#39;s really slippery the</text>
  <text start="142.73" dur="9.98">other one that really flagged me was the</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="9.47">one that says disinformation</text>
  <text start="152.71" dur="6.85">disinformation what is disinformation</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="5.2">well if you talk to some of the</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="6.54">mainstream media people disinformation</text>
  <text start="162.35" dur="9.35">is anything that counters what they say</text>
  <text start="166.1" dur="8.01">and what they say are a bunch of lies</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="4.03">but they&amp;#39;ll determine what</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="5.31">disinformation is so the people that are</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="6.09">running a platform will determine what</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="5.67">is disinformation what standard is</text>
  <text start="181.82" dur="5.55">placed on that how do you as a user of</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="5.46">the platform can test something like</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="7.25">that do you have to plead a case do you</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="7.83">have to present evidence is there any</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="5.49">applet process or is this just a blanket</text>
  <text start="198.38" dur="7.32">statement that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="9.22">you know for a very long time I&amp;#39;ll use a</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="7.5">different example the photo of the</text>
  <text start="209.33" dur="6.659">inauguration right the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="6.12">posted it and there was like no on there</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="4.53">and then all of a sudden we find out</text>
  <text start="219.32" dur="6.06">that that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="6.271">that was disinformation who is going to</text>
  <text start="225.38" dur="4.68">keep those people who&amp;#39;s going to hold</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="6.15">those people accountable nobody because</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="6.6">the quote establishment view right now</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="6.81">on all of these platforms leans in the</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="4.95">favor of those people who are making the</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="6.56">claims that it&amp;#39;s disinformation even</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="4.7">though it&amp;#39;s true even though it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="246.82" dur="9.089">this is why I always stress that</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="10.389">giving more power to a central</text>
  <text start="255.909" dur="10.141">government or to a company or to any</text>
  <text start="262.449" dur="6.181">institution is never a good idea because</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="8.16">while there may be people in power that</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="7.47">you agree with right now tomorrow there</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="3.929">may be people in power that you do not</text>
  <text start="276.1" dur="4.05">agree with and then they will take your</text>
  <text start="278.139" dur="4.381">rules that you just so happily signed</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="4.19">onto and they will flip them around and</text>
  <text start="282.52" dur="4.95">they will shove them back in your face</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="7.53">so it&amp;#39;s a problem it&amp;#39;s a problem now</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="4.4">let&amp;#39;s talk about YouTube for a second</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="6.88">every single video that I do every one</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="6.86">of them is be monetized immediately</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="5.31">within the first 15 to 20 minutes</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="5.02">sometimes a little bit longer it all</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="5.63">depends but it gets D monetized I have</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="5.37">to submit the video for a manual review</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="5.889">once the manual review submit goes and</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="7.589">it takes I don&amp;#39;t know 12 to 24 hours</text>
  <text start="315.699" dur="6.72">sometimes a day or two to have some</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="4.081">person sit there and listen to every</text>
  <text start="322.419" dur="4.56">single video that every single word of</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="6.5">my video determine that it isn&amp;#39;t hate</text>
  <text start="326.979" dur="8.611">speech or discriminatory or</text>
  <text start="330.75" dur="8.889">disinformation god forbid or whatever</text>
  <text start="335.59" dur="7.799">and then approve it for monetization</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="6.021">again because they say this is suitable</text>
  <text start="343.389" dur="4.381">for advertisers you&amp;#39;re good to go</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="5.08">congratulations your video passes the</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="4.74">test and nine times out of ten nine</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="4.679">times out of ten there are videos I have</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="5.939">that are not monetized my videos go</text>
  <text start="355.419" dur="6.151">through because I&amp;#39;m using their</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="5.671">information so if they D monetize me and</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="4.469">say that it&amp;#39;s disinformation there then</text>
  <text start="364.12" dur="8.329">saying that their information is</text>
  <text start="366.039" dur="10.261">disinformation and they can&amp;#39;t do that so</text>
  <text start="372.449" dur="5.771">how do we beat this well yes I have I</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="4.89">have my stuff on other platforms I have</text>
  <text start="378.22" dur="5.31">my videos most on on bit shoot I will</text>
  <text start="381.19" dur="4.32">have all my videos on D tube and steam</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="5.03">it but I&amp;#39;m going to keep you too</text>
  <text start="385.51" dur="6.69">and people are like why why why well</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s because you guys chances are are</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="6.75">not gonna travel over to steam it to</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="8.94">watch me and I&amp;#39;m going to lose my reach</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="5.67">with you folks it would literally take</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="4.29">for all of you</text>
  <text start="404.62" dur="6.3">to say I&amp;#39;m not ever going to youtube</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.89">again I&amp;#39;m really sorry but I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="410.92" dur="2.97">another platform and I just don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="2.94">that happening it and as soon as people</text>
  <text start="413.89" dur="4.65">start to say I&amp;#39;m not gonna watch you if</text>
  <text start="415.48" dur="7.02">you&amp;#39;re there then I&amp;#39;ll move solely over</text>
  <text start="418.54" dur="5.67">to another platform but I did a</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="3.42">periscope a little earlier where was</text>
  <text start="424.21" dur="3.72">kind of being very hopeful for people</text>
  <text start="425.92" dur="6.81">about this because I was going over the</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="6.96">hypocrisy of sort of the more</text>
  <text start="432.73" dur="3.75">left-leaning blue checkmark to</text>
  <text start="434.89" dur="3.45">individuals who are saying basically</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="4.8">like if you support the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="438.34" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;re against children if you support</text>
  <text start="441.28" dur="4.32">the NRA you&amp;#39;re a murderer</text>
  <text start="442.75" dur="5.25">we should go kill the NRA people because</text>
  <text start="445.6" dur="7.29">love Trump&amp;#39;s hate after all right love</text>
  <text start="448" dur="7.38">Trump&amp;#39;s hate and I&amp;#39;m just reveling in</text>
  <text start="452.89" dur="3.72">the hypocrisy because they are standing</text>
  <text start="455.38" dur="3.18">in the middle of the street with the</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="5.49">pink hat on their head shaped like a</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="5.1">vagina talking about how they want to</text>
  <text start="462.1" dur="3.03">make sure that women can kill their</text>
  <text start="463.66" dur="5.22">children while they&amp;#39;re still in the womb</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="5.43">and to me it&amp;#39;s hypocritical you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="5.09">care about kids if you&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="7.2">kill them while they&amp;#39;re in your belly</text>
  <text start="473.97" dur="6.49">it&amp;#39;s just pretty obvious to me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.76" dur="6.93">obvious another hypocritical point I was</text>
  <text start="480.46" dur="9.03">talking about ah you can&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="484.69" dur="9.69">children when you&amp;#39;re openly allowing</text>

  <text start="525.25" dur="8.19">normalized in society but yet they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.77" dur="4.17">screaming at Americans who appreciate</text>

  <text start="534.94" dur="9.57">and want to maintain it and keep it for</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="8.67">the reasons it was put forth which are</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="6.84">to fight against them leaders in</text>
