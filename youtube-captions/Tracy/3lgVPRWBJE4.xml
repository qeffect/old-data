  <text start="452.15" dur="3.24">where we had heard it coming from so we</text>
  <text start="453.89" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t know if it was around us or</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="7.23">inside we didn&amp;#39;t know okay so people</text>
  <text start="458.66" dur="5.22">kind of started moving cuz the hallways</text>

  <text start="471.89" dur="6.66">and then we saw people that had gotten</text>
  <text start="474.86" dur="5.79">off the elevator and my husband decided</text>

  <text start="480.65" dur="6.96">back to our room and we got in the</text>
  <text start="484.82" dur="4.68">elevator went all the way down went</text>
  <text start="487.61" dur="3.9">immediately across to the other elevator</text>
  <text start="489.5" dur="4.32">because there&amp;#39;s rooms such-and-such</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="6.48">through such-and-such so we got to where</text>
  <text start="493.82" dur="6.03">we were and didn&amp;#39;t really notice anybody</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="3.81">around there except for the security</text>
  <text start="499.85" dur="3.9">that if people were gonna come through I</text>

  <text start="511.87" dur="5.56">mm-hmm um we had heard the sirens so</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="2.97">immediately we turned on the TV thinking</text>

  <text start="592.69" dur="5.31">my husband is extremely well trained and</text>
  <text start="595.9" dur="3.6">knowing where and when and how after</text>
  <text start="598" dur="5.01">almost 23 years in the Marine Corps</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="6.27">where things are and for him who he does</text>
  <text start="603.01" dur="5.82">not scare easily to literally take me</text>
  <text start="605.77" dur="5.93">and put me down under the table and to</text>
  <text start="608.83" dur="7.44">cover me there was the direct threat and</text>
  <text start="611.7" dur="6.28">and we were we were just waiting for</text>
  <text start="616.27" dur="4.29">them and they didn&amp;#39;t say anything nope</text>
  <text start="617.98" dur="4.68">nobody was saying anything so we sat</text>
  <text start="620.56" dur="4.29">there for a little while longer and my</text>
  <text start="622.66" dur="4.71">husband said okay we&amp;#39;re just gonna go</text>
  <text start="624.85" dur="4.14">you just stay right with me so we went</text>
  <text start="627.37" dur="3.48">we went to go down and that&amp;#39;s when I</text>
  <text start="628.99" dur="3.51">started the video because all these</text>
  <text start="630.85" dur="5.22">people were down there we tried to go</text>
  <text start="632.5" dur="5.07">out and we were all blocked off the</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="4.23">security had blocked it you couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="637.57" dur="5.7">down the corridor into the casino or</text>
  <text start="640.3" dur="5.22">into the lobby so when we were in the</text>
  <text start="643.27" dur="4.17">lobby when we had initially dropped</text>
  <text start="645.52" dur="3.569">before the security came down as people</text>
  <text start="647.44" dur="4.17">kind of started to look up you could see</text>
  <text start="649.089" dur="4.441">all the glass and people&amp;#39;s shoes and</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="5.61">purses I mean people just dropped and</text>
  <text start="653.53" dur="6.9">ran and so there there was broken glass</text>
  <text start="657.22" dur="5.4">there and there was chaos and you know</text>
  <text start="660.43" dur="4.83">damage and things like that yeah there</text>
  <text start="662.62" dur="5.82">was even the glass partition things that</text>
  <text start="665.26" dur="4.74">say like what show is going on there</text>
  <text start="668.44" dur="3.78">you know where to go eat that kind of</text>
  <text start="670" dur="4.2">thing those things were trampled over</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="6.51">people didn&amp;#39;t run around things they ran</text>
  <text start="674.2" dur="6.06">through them and over them so um so</text>
  <text start="678.73" dur="3.57">another question about the glass was the</text>
  <text start="680.26" dur="3.87">glass that was broken in the front of</text>
  <text start="682.3" dur="3.36">the building from the doors of the hotel</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="2.85">or from other things that were broken</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="3">through the trampled</text>
  <text start="686.98" dur="4.32">we couldn&amp;#39;t or do you not know there was</text>
  <text start="688.66" dur="4.799">I we could not see and that was why when</text>
  <text start="691.3" dur="4.289">we went to go down we thought well are</text>
  <text start="693.459" dur="4.771">they fixing the doors what does this</text>
  <text start="695.589" dur="4.081">look like it is basically what it was</text>
  <text start="698.23" dur="2.58">and when we were held back and then I</text>
  <text start="699.67" dur="3.24">saw these people</text>
  <text start="700.81" dur="3.839">I just told Daniel I&amp;#39;m like okay if</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="3.69">people are still walking around out</text>
  <text start="704.649" dur="3.831">there we could see them cleaning up we</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="5.19">could see the crews in there cleaning up</text>
  <text start="708.48" dur="4.63">but we couldn&amp;#39;t get to them so I we</text>
  <text start="711.79" dur="2.97">started walking the other way down the</text>
  <text start="713.11" dur="2.849">hall and that&amp;#39;s when I started filming</text>
  <text start="714.76" dur="3.449">and I&amp;#39;m like this is where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="715.959" dur="3.931">we&amp;#39;re at the Bellagio Hotel and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="718.209" dur="3.841">trapped and I was also doing that</text>
  <text start="719.89" dur="4.68">because if there was something else</text>
  <text start="722.05" dur="5.7">going on I wanted people to know where</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="4.86">we all were that this is like okay I</text>
  <text start="727.75" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s in their rooms or who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="729.43" dur="4.59">but there&amp;#39;s actually people in here you</text>
  <text start="732.31" dur="3.96">know yeah so you were trying to warn</text>
  <text start="734.02" dur="4.319">people which I was when we were talking</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="4.35">before I said that what for thought that</text>
  <text start="738.339" dur="4.5">was so smart of you to do it wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="740.62" dur="4.08">necessarily to because at this point</text>
  <text start="742.839" dur="5.011">you&amp;#39;re still I&amp;#39;m sure kind of like what</text>
  <text start="744.7" dur="5.79">the hell is going on yeah so you you</text>
  <text start="747.85" dur="4.739">recorded for about eight minutes okay I</text>
  <text start="750.49" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t even know in the first in the</text>
  <text start="752.589" dur="4.201">video I saw where you actually walk down</text>
  <text start="754.63" dur="4.92">and you end up talking to hotel staff</text>
  <text start="756.79" dur="5.52">what what happened there so we had</text>
  <text start="759.55" dur="4.529">walked down one way and my husband was</text>
  <text start="762.31" dur="3.029">trying to get the layout as far as kind</text>
  <text start="764.079" dur="3.391">of where we were when we went to go walk</text>
  <text start="765.339" dur="3.931">outside and that&amp;#39;s where you see the one</text>
  <text start="767.47" dur="4.17">police officer or security person that</text>
  <text start="769.27" dur="4.679">says no this is all blocked off you</text>
  <text start="771.64" dur="3.66">can&amp;#39;t come out here so we thanked him</text>
  <text start="773.949" dur="2.961">and said okay we turned around that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.3" dur="4.38">when we went back up to the hotel staff</text>

  <text start="787" dur="4.35">room here to go back up to your room and</text>
  <text start="789.089" dur="4.891">that&amp;#39;s when I walked up to the other</text>

  <text start="2645.18" dur="7.98">on the TV and they were like what the</text>
  <text start="2647.88" dur="7.53">what what and so Denise was literally I</text>
  <text start="2653.16" dur="4.5">mean kind of filling us into what they</text>
  <text start="2655.41" dur="4.35">had already been watching because we</text>
  <text start="2657.66" dur="3.42">hadn&amp;#39;t gotten to the room yet and joy</text>
  <text start="2659.76" dur="3.3">had no idea anything else was even</text>
  <text start="2661.08" dur="3.9">happening no we had no idea that all</text>
  <text start="2663.06" dur="3.63">this had already that had happened</text>
  <text start="2664.98" dur="4.68">prior to what was going on there and</text>

  <text start="2679.11" dur="3.99">far as any kind of takeaway from the</text>
  <text start="2681.24" dur="4.74">Mandalay Bay because that above and</text>
  <text start="2683.1" dur="5.97">beyond is the main focus and I get that</text>
  <text start="2685.98" dur="4.92">my my thing was the fact that there were</text>
  <text start="2689.07" dur="4.2">other people that were still at risk and</text>
  <text start="2690.9" dur="5.16">it could have been really really bad</text>
  <text start="2693.27" dur="6.72">mm-hmm that&amp;#39;s all that it was about and</text>
  <text start="2696.06" dur="6.87">my last question for you is just one</text>
  <text start="2699.99" dur="4.71">other question someone had was did any</text>
  <text start="2702.93" dur="3.5">other media besides the people that you</text>
  <text start="2704.7" dur="4.53">had mentioned directly that you know</text>

  <text start="2709.23" dur="4.14">have witnessed or have you just seen</text>
  <text start="2711.99" dur="2.79">people using that video and not</text>
  <text start="2713.37" dur="1.98">questioning you were asking you for</text>
  <text start="2714.78" dur="2.22">comment</text>
  <text start="2715.35" dur="3.36">yeah just that&amp;#39;s the way I&amp;#39;ve seen it I</text>
  <text start="2717" dur="3.15">just seen him like all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="2718.71" dur="4.2">somebody will say hey Renee I saw this</text>
  <text start="2720.15" dur="4.08">on such-and-such and I was like you know</text>
  <text start="2722.91" dur="2.67">I know they put it out there but then</text>
  <text start="2724.23" dur="4.2">like I said when they add their own</text>
  <text start="2725.58" dur="5.1">narrative to it I&amp;#39;m kind of like come on</text>
  <text start="2728.43" dur="4.74">people you know at least stay with what</text>
  <text start="2730.68" dur="4.41">I said even me heightened in all of the</text>
  <text start="2733.17" dur="3.54">stuff I was like in the bullets and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2735.09" dur="3.39">like did I see any bullets no I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2736.71" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s why my husband wrote what he</text>
  <text start="2738.48" dur="6.03">wrote to clarify as far as you know I</text>
  <text start="2741.72" dur="4.74">heat like I said he&amp;#39;s very very calm I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2744.51" dur="5.31">I was much more excitable I was very</text>
  <text start="2746.46" dur="4.74">very scared and very shaky and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2749.82" dur="3.78">why he wrote what he wrote so when these</text>
  <text start="2751.2" dur="4.41">people are even putting other words and</text>
