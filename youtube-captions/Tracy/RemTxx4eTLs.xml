  <text start="2.52" dur="3.48">interview at 1:20 that I have to do so</text>
  <text start="4.319" dur="4.831">that gives me ten minutes I expected to</text>
  <text start="6" dur="4.23">have 40 sorry about that interruption if</text>
  <text start="9.15" dur="4.29">you guys are coming in now you</text>
  <text start="10.23" dur="6.66">understand technology technology doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="13.44" dur="5.55">work sometimes however I was saying</text>
  <text start="16.89" dur="4.17">basically that the FBI main office</text>
  <text start="18.99" dur="3.84">delegated to the field offices that they</text>
  <text start="21.06" dur="4.2">were in charge of reporting back their</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="6.06">confidential human sources the FBI</text>
  <text start="25.26" dur="6.359">offices at the field level that had</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="6.8">controversial confidential confidential</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="6.181">human sources that didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="35.69" dur="3.99">accountable for them and wanted to be</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="5.25">able to continue using those sources</text>
  <text start="39.68" dur="5.44">instead didn&amp;#39;t report those sources to</text>
  <text start="43.05" dur="3.15">the FBI so if you had a confidential</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="3.99">human source in the New York field</text>
  <text start="46.2" dur="5.699">office that told you that so-and-so a</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="4.91">committed a bank robbery and you knew</text>
  <text start="51.899" dur="8.18">that that confidential human source had</text>
  <text start="54.02" dur="9.24">legal issues or problems or whatever you</text>
  <text start="60.079" dur="9.131">wouldn&amp;#39;t report the use of that source</text>
  <text start="63.26" dur="7.66">to Maine you know FBI Maine because</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;d want to continue using it in</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="9.8">addition the file you compile on that</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="12.11">confidential human source is provided in</text>
  <text start="80.72" dur="7.71">circumstances of Brady in other words if</text>
  <text start="86.06" dur="7.21">the confidential human source had</text>
  <text start="88.43" dur="6.46">motivations that were contrary in other</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="3.239">words they didn&amp;#39;t like you or they hated</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="4.32">you or they wanted you go to prison or</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="4.981">you ratted them out or whatever the</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="4.799">information about that is technically</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="6.57">available for the public or for any</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="8.341">defendant under Brady exculpatory</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="6.71">information is being hidden by the FBI</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="4.89">in cases of confidential human sources</text>
  <text start="114.77" dur="5.349">so that it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be disclosed</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="9.69">when the people the FBI is going after</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="11.821">are indicted it sounds similar it sounds</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="12.84">like general Flynn&amp;#39;s case just saying</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="10.89">if there was a if there was a conflict</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="6.45">or a dangerous source or a shady source</text>
  <text start="142.83" dur="6.81">or a a you know Shh</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="5.01">I don&amp;#39;t know conflicted source the FBI</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="3.87">field offices who had been designated</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="3.81">control of that stuff under policy and</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="4.41">procedure that was never approved by the</text>
  <text start="155.04" dur="4.59">FBI or the DOJ they just made their own</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="3.45">policy didn&amp;#39;t put it through the proper</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="2.88">channels and decided that that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="8.31">they would do and then didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="9.42">follow that policy then they just with</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="3.96">withheld that stuff and so tons of Brady</text>
  <text start="171.93" dur="4.08">material was never given to some of the</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="5.7">people that did the FBI prosecuted which</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="4.74">to me is is crazy but anyway all I was</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="3.45">trying to say with this before I have to</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="3.72">jump off I&amp;#39;ll probably come back on and</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="2.43">go through some more details I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="3.33">sorry about this</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="3.18">I really am again I have an interview in</text>
  <text start="187.8" dur="4.98">ten minutes</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="7.53">um but the it&amp;#39;s lesson ten now the the</text>
  <text start="192.78" dur="6.929">point here is that the FBI as a whole</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="5.46">did not follow any of the DOJ guidelines</text>
  <text start="199.709" dur="4.771">when it came to managing their sources</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="5.67">especially not their long-term sources</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="3.9">their long-term sources are sources they</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="3.39">use for five or more years</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="3.87">Christopher steel fits right in there I</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="3.87">wanted to just go through some of the</text>
  <text start="212.25" dur="4.11">questions on this because I want to show</text>
  <text start="214.32" dur="6.96">you really quickly I&amp;#39;m gonna have to</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="9.05">jump off but here on my thread where I</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="4.13">announced that this has been released</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="7.95">someone said I really hope there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="9.699">someone said it&amp;#39;s super broad this is</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="5.43">nothing from what I can tell why is it</text>
  <text start="241.459" dur="6.481">taking so long to release the Pfizer</text>
  <text start="242.69" dur="8.629">report I&amp;#39;m just trying to find some more</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="6.269">where are the indictment recommendations</text>
  <text start="251.319" dur="4.991">in other words no arrests no criminal</text>
  <text start="254.209" dur="6.391">charges will be filed as a result of</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="6.33">these findings the IG report exonerates</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="4.47">the bad guys and department by keeping</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="5.4">problems in-house they protect their own</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="4.89">but someone else says any indictments</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="5.43">are just more declined to prosecute so</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="6.54">again not a lot of people understand</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="6">what this is this is an audit of</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="6.12">internal FBI procedure it is an audit</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="5.64">that must be completed it is necessary</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="3.96">this isn&amp;#39;t just some you know oh well</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="3.66">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything nothing is</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="4.64">ever gonna come of this like that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="5.1">the purpose of this was to identify the</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="5.13">shortcomings of the FBI in handling</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="6.42">their confidential human sources and</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="5.5">they did they don&amp;#39;t follow any policy or</text>
  <text start="300.29" dur="4.17">procedure when it comes to handling</text>
  <text start="301.85" dur="5.31">you&amp;#39;re confident there are confidential</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="4.95">human sources when there are four or</text>
  <text start="307.16" dur="4.319">five sources confidential human sources</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="5.009">being used by the FBI and the Spygate</text>
  <text start="311.479" dur="5.041">scandal you can sort of understand why</text>
  <text start="314.419" dur="3.181">the IG would look into how they handle</text>
  <text start="316.52" dur="3.57">their sources and if they follow</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="5.189">guidelines if none of the guidelines for</text>
  <text start="320.09" dur="4.86">sources are followed including whether</text>
  <text start="322.789" dur="4.681">or not the source is viable in providing</text>
  <text start="324.95" dur="6.9">valid and valuable information which</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="6.54">didn&amp;#39;t happen then that goes to the</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="3.54">credibility of your source which then</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="4.2">goes to the credibility of their</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="6.18">information which was used to obtain a</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="5.61">FISA warrant on a US citizen by the FBI</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="5.96">when there are no processes and</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="3.71">procedures being followed by the FBI</text>
  <text start="348.1" dur="6.129">that&amp;#39;s all so that&amp;#39;s basically what this</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="4.95">is goes to incompetence but nothing</text>
  <text start="354.229" dur="5.101">criminal don&amp;#39;t see recommendations to</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="5.449">prosecute no mention of FISA so this</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="4.079">isn&amp;#39;t the report we&amp;#39;ll be waiting for</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="3.191">this appears to be nothing more</text>
  <text start="363.409" dur="6.54">than what bar wants to get their</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="8.279">attention the fbi&amp;#39;s of the FBI back this</text>
  <text start="369.949" dur="5.94">does not get the FBI&amp;#39;s reputation back</text>
  <text start="372.889" dur="5.52">it actually excoriates the FBI for being</text>
  <text start="375.889" dur="5.18">completely and confident so I just</text>
  <text start="378.409" dur="4.86">wanted to make that point um</text>
  <text start="381.069" dur="6.36">Christopher&amp;#39;s let me say I&amp;#39;m just you</text>
  <text start="383.269" dur="4.16">know everybody nobody really gets it</text>
  <text start="388.119" dur="6.25">it&amp;#39;s supposed to be 500 pages why aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.979" dur="5.31">people talking about 63 pages there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.369" dur="4.44">nothing in it other than recommendations</text>
  <text start="396.289" dur="4.77">on how to handle confidential human</text>
  <text start="398.809" dur="5.43">sources more probably properly very</text>
  <text start="401.059" dur="5.04">boring their reasons for this thing like</text>
  <text start="404.239" dur="3.48">people need to understand like I know</text>
  <text start="406.099" dur="3.33">everybody&amp;#39;s waiting for this bombshell</text>
  <text start="407.719" dur="2.88">fights a report to say everybody</text>
  <text start="409.429" dur="5.1">committed a crime it needs to go to jail</text>
  <text start="410.599" dur="6.06">right but this this is important what we</text>
  <text start="414.529" dur="4.29">just read is is important what we just</text>
  <text start="416.659" dur="5.37">talked about is important and it&amp;#39;s 111</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="9.96">just saying every everything in there is</text>
  <text start="422.029" dur="8.91">important um I still have to read the</text>
  <text start="428.779" dur="5.461">last part so somebody found this but</text>
  <text start="430.939" dur="5.73">anyway I&amp;#39;m just saying like wanted to</text>
  <text start="434.24" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s a nothing burger when do we get</text>
  <text start="436.669" dur="6.03">indictments deep breaths this has to</text>
  <text start="440.3" dur="5.039">come out first John Solomon said first</text>
  <text start="442.699" dur="4.71">this then the Pfizer report there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="445.339" dur="4.56">hearing date set for December 11th on</text>
  <text start="447.409" dur="4.8">Sean Hannity last night there was a</text>
  <text start="449.899" dur="3.93">guest who was in Congress I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.209" dur="6.57">remember who it was that said it was</text>
  <text start="453.829" dur="8.67">close to a thousand pages it is not 500</text>
  <text start="458.779" dur="6.42">pages long buck de Hawkes it is actually</text>
  <text start="462.499" dur="5.43">a not the Pfizer report it&amp;#39;s 63 pages</text>
  <text start="465.199" dur="5.64">long it is their report on confidential</text>
  <text start="467.929" dur="5.04">human sources not the Pfizer report it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.839" dur="7.23">the report on how the FBI handled</text>
  <text start="472.969" dur="6.18">confidential human sources just trying</text>
  <text start="478.069" dur="2.91">to see if there&amp;#39;s anything else in here</text>
  <text start="479.149" dur="5.16">this report is what&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="480.979" dur="5.04">foundation it raises concern of all CHS</text>
  <text start="484.309" dur="6.11">assets used in this time frame and their</text>
  <text start="486.019" dur="6.781">reliability yes precisely</text>
  <text start="490.419" dur="7.08">the FBI has handled everything and</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="4.699">followed no guidelines yes precisely</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="7.6">and nothing will come of it okay if the</text>
  <text start="504.639" dur="3.361">FBI wasn&amp;#39;t vetting CIS then what becomes</text>
  <text start="506.44" dur="6.95">of all the prosecutions they were used</text>
  <text start="508" dur="9.599">in very good question very good question</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="6.759">our analysts read through the entire 63</text>
  <text start="517.599" dur="4.74">pages their initial impression is this</text>
  <text start="520.149" dur="5.071">is typical of a Horowitz report meaning</text>
  <text start="522.339" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s a big nothing burger your analysts</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="5.309">I&amp;#39;m sorry to say should probably take</text>
  <text start="527.709" dur="5.091">some more time with this report there</text>
  <text start="530.529" dur="4.531">are no allegations of wrongdoing and no</text>
  <text start="532.8" dur="3.39">recommendations to the DOJ for</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="8.149">prosecution</text>
  <text start="536.19" dur="10.839">so why the hype this right here is how</text>
  <text start="543.209" dur="7.211">disinformation gets spread because</text>
  <text start="547.029" dur="5.641">whoever the Institute for Logitech logic</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="6.15">and politics is doesn&amp;#39;t understand what</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re reading so so they obviously</text>
  <text start="556.57" dur="4.86">would say that there wouldn&amp;#39;t be again</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="4.56">any recommendations to the DOJ to</text>
  <text start="561.43" dur="7.26">prosecute based off this report it is an</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="7.86">audit this is typical of a Horace report</text>
  <text start="568.69" dur="6.089">he reviewed thousands of pages of</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="4.92">documentation and came to dozens of</text>
  <text start="574.779" dur="4.621">conclusions all of which say that the</text>
  <text start="576.64" dur="4.53">FBI is not following the proper</text>
  <text start="579.4" dur="6.9">procedures and protocols and they need</text>
  <text start="581.17" dur="7.74">to change their their act I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="586.3" dur="4.32">what else to say to Institute for logic</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="3.869">and politics but I&amp;#39;ll respond to them on</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="4.38">Twitter because that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="592.779" dur="5.851">this is like someone will read this and</text>
