  <text start="112.59" dur="3.54">out looking pretty the EU has already</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="3.72">suffered in my mind tremendous</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="3.96">reputational damage in the last week the</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="4.079">faulty design of the euro is now plainly</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="4.979">evident to everyone as opposed to being</text>
  <text start="122.429" dur="5.101">some theoretical purely academic debate</text>
  <text start="125.069" dur="4.44">without full banking and fiscal Union</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="3.78">member states can only stay within a</text>

  <text start="137.849" dur="4.051">government that says differently if</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="4.109">Jeffrey Sachs or Joe Stiglitz had been</text>
  <text start="141.9" dur="3.72">the Greek finance minister instead of</text>
  <text start="143.579" dur="3.69">Vera focus they would have been treated</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="4.29">no more kindly had they insisted on a</text>
  <text start="147.269" dur="7.021">policy of ending austerity in other</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="7.71">words we know that this is a big mess</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="4.8">and it&amp;#39;s nonsense and everybody knows it</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="3.42">now and that was just the beginning I</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="9.53">mean it got much much much worse this</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="7.58">was from July 5th of 2015 next</text>
  <text start="168.829" dur="4.871">Washington Post story - sorry to write</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="6.72">this on a Saturday this was February</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="11.55">22nd 2015 this was really interesting</text>
  <text start="177.75" dur="9.959">because this email right here is about</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="5.13">this is from Benenson who was from that</text>
  <text start="187.709" dur="4.711">Benenson Strategy Group that did that</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="4.919">supposed document about the alien</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="4.98">invasion this is by far the most</text>
  <text start="195.299" dur="3.81">damaging story and most damaging type of</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="5.94">story we can have I&amp;#39;m not quite sure</text>
  <text start="199.109" dur="6.261">what they&amp;#39;re talking about I did try to</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="6.929">do a little research to figure this out</text>
  <text start="205.37" dur="6.25">and look into what they may have been</text>
  <text start="210.269" dur="2.791">saying and I just paused the video</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="3.959">because I was able to find something and</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="4.649">I just remembered it so in the National</text>
  <text start="215.579" dur="4.171">Review this story came out today on that</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="3.541">day the bill Hillary Chelsea and His</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="3.88">Royal Highness King Salman of Saudi</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="3.85">Arabia Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s not just that Hillary&amp;#39;s corrupt</text>
  <text start="225.1" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s that she&amp;#39;s also clueless so</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="3.18">basically this is a hit piece on the</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="3.39">Clinton Foundation which we know was a</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="5.46">huge problem I will link this in the</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="5.22">description as well I think we need a</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="3.42">paradigm shift in how this world</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="4.5">operates we have to convince Hillary and</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="4.74">probably bill that her meeting with 200</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="3.45">people doesn&amp;#39;t help her hiring corporate</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="3.51">wizards has never been a successful</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="4.08">strategy in campaigns and anyone whose</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="3.21">name is in the paper 48 hours after they</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="6.36">meet with her needs to be cut off</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="7.41">completely from her campaign now we</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="6.6">scroll up we get a response I generally</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="11.67">agree we need a strategy this is from</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="14.52">from John Podesta to Joel basically</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="8.17">saying nobody&amp;#39;s talking we can try to</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="2.68">shut</text>
  <text start="277.91" dur="2.37">somebody blabbing from the inside and</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="7.56">here&amp;#39;s where it starts to get</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="8.67">interesting this is from Joel again I do</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="3.51">believe that this starts with alignment</text>
  <text start="288.95" dur="3.33">on our campaign culture and a paradigm</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="3.36">shift in the old Clinton MO I know</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="3.06">Hilary believes the more people you talk</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="4.2">to the better but it simply isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="4.2">especially for her we really need to</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="3.48">tighten who she talks to and make sure</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="3.54">that looma and schedulers were out most</text>
  <text start="301.61" dur="3.27">people through high-level folks on the</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="4.77">campaign so they are being listened to</text>
  <text start="304.88" dur="4.11">I think Robbie&amp;#39;s right Robbie rightly</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="4.53">says a lot of our leaks are coming</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="5.1">through job searches I think we have to</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="3.51">make examples now of people who have</text>
  <text start="314.09" dur="4.59">violated the trust and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="315.89" dur="5.52">team people need going forward need to</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="4.56">know there&amp;#39;s diff consequences for</text>
  <text start="321.41" dur="2.76">leaking self-promotion unauthorized</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="3.03">talking with the press</text>
  <text start="324.17" dur="4.26">no one literally no one talked to the</text>
  <text start="326.27" dur="4.76">press and either Obama campaign without</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="5.94">clearing it with the brass first and</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="4.75">there&amp;#39;s more Podesta writes agree and</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="3.45">this is like almost the most I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="335.78" dur="4.38">seen Podesta write in an email through</text>
  <text start="337.82" dur="3.99">all these things I&amp;#39;ve been doing Podesta</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="3.27">rates agree happy to talk to the David&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="2.97">call me crazy but I think if we can</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="3.03">survive the next month it&amp;#39;ll be possible</text>
  <text start="344.78" dur="3.12">maybe even straight forward to get our</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="3.69">arms around this once there&amp;#39;s an actual</text>
  <text start="347.9" dur="4.23">campaign I&amp;#39;m definitely for maybe an</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="5.519">example of a suspected leaker whether or</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="6.87">not we have any real basis for it super</text>
  <text start="355.669" dur="4.711">interesting we&amp;#39;re going to punish</text>
  <text start="359" dur="2.73">whoever it is that opens their mouth</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="4.97">because we can&amp;#39;t deal with the truth</text>
