  <text start="394.74" dur="3.99">here</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="5.37">to be clear this is not to suggest that</text>
  <text start="398.73" dur="4.95">in similar circumstances a person who</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="3.9">engaged in this activity would face no</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="3.51">consequence Oh</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="3.36">in other words someone else who did this</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="2.88">would be tarred and feathered but</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="4.32">Hillary Clinton can do it and we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.07" dur="5.13">do anything about it how how do you say</text>

  <text start="421.35" dur="4.47">deciding now now of course of course</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="4.62">that as a result although the Department</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="3.96">of Justice makes final decisions on</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="4.65">matters like this we are expressing to</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="5.97">justice our view that no charges are</text>
  <text start="432.24" dur="5.13">appropriate in this case ha I know there</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="3.27">will be intense public debate in the</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="4.32">wake of this recommendation as there was</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="5.13">throughout the investigation what I can</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="5.72">assure the American people is that this</text>
  <text start="444.15" dur="5.16">investigation was done honestly</text>
