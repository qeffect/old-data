  <text start="154.92" dur="4.11">this letter important because the</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="3.659">Special Counsel investigation was a</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="4.44">complete fraud I mean what they did with</text>
  <text start="161.099" dur="5.881">this report and even Barr had made some</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="8.79">comments about it and you know what they</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="7.08">did with this was disgusting they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="6.39">come to a conclusion on obstruction and</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="6.69">it is such a catastrophic failure that</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="3.419">it is setting precedent and so the White</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="2.819">House special that special counsel to</text>

  <text start="188.099" dur="6.961">things are going to be basically the</text>
  <text start="191.459" dur="5.701">history moving forward so like these</text>
  <text start="195.06" dur="4.29">letters the letters from Congress the</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="4.5">letters from the Senate the letters from</text>

  <text start="206.13" dur="5.85">be in the history books later on as you</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="5.79">know the kind of defining stamp of</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="5.159">approval official moments of this</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="9.389">debacle and this letter is very</text>
  <text start="217.139" dur="8.311">important in here you know what let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="2.911">just go through it I write on behalf of</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="4.65">the office of the President to</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="5.01">memorialize concerns relating to the</text>
  <text start="230.1" dur="3.93">form of the special counsel&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.19">report and to address executive</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="5.179">privilege issues associated with its</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="4.829">release because the left has gone insane</text>
  <text start="239.209" dur="4.451">even worse than before I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.709" dur="5.701">absolutely stunning what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="7.47">witnessing right now he starts with the</text>
  <text start="247.41" dur="5.22">stated conclusion on obstruction the</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="3.66">Special Counsel concluded that the</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="4.74">evidence prevented it from conclusively</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="6.419">determining that no criminal conduct</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="6">occurred the way it&amp;#39;s written is</text>
  <text start="261.209" dur="5.21">misleading but conclusively determining</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="3.049">that no credible credible</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="7.69">criminal conduct occurred was not the</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="5.88">task of the Special Counsel because</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="5.49">making conclusive determinations of</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="6.48">innocence is never the task of the</text>
  <text start="279.79" dur="4.44">federal prosecutor prosecutors are</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="3.93">supposed to complete an investigation</text>
  <text start="284.23" dur="4.59">and either ask the grand jury to return</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="4.16">an indictment or decline to charge the</text>
  <text start="288.82" dur="4.59">case when prosecutors declined to charge</text>
  <text start="291" dur="4.66">they make that decision because they</text>
  <text start="293.41" dur="4.89">have quote conclusively determined that</text>
  <text start="295.66" dur="5.1">no criminal conduct not because they</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="5.04">have quote conclusively determined that</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="4.41">no criminal conduct occurred but rather</text>
  <text start="303.34" dur="3.9">because they don&amp;#39;t believe that the</text>
  <text start="305.17" dur="4.26">investigated conduct constitutes a crime</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="4.02">for which all of the elements can be</text>
  <text start="309.43" dur="3.57">proven to the satisfaction of a jury</text>
  <text start="311.26" dur="4.02">beyond a reasonable doubt in other words</text>
  <text start="313" dur="4.17">they don&amp;#39;t do it because they found no</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="4.05">evidence that a crime was ever committed</text>
  <text start="317.17" dur="3.54">and and this bothered me when I was</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="3.09">reading it like oh well that means</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s still some possibility of guilt</text>
  <text start="322.42" dur="7.2">there but I&amp;#39;ll get to why it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="7.56">in a second they don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;d be able to prove the case beyond</text>
  <text start="331.96" dur="5.85">a reasonable doubt which is the standard</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="8.07">not that it it definitely happened but</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="6.99">beyond a reasonable doubt prosecutors</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="5.31">are not in the business of establishing</text>
  <text start="344.8" dur="5.9">innocence any more than they are in the</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="5.7">business of quote exonerating</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="5.7">investigative persons investigated</text>
  <text start="353.77" dur="8.19">persons in the American justice system</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="8.5">innocence is presumed what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="6.18">is you&amp;#39;re innocent by default you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="5.33">presumed to be innocent completely</text>
  <text start="368.14" dur="4.97">innocent</text>
  <text start="370.23" dur="5.68">so there&amp;#39;s no need for them to</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="7.15">conclusively determine it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="375.91" dur="6.24">already presumed so important people are</text>
  <text start="380.26" dur="5.01">not missing this and I think this letter</text>
  <text start="382.15" dur="5.64">is really great because of this you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="5.09">already presumed to be innocent they go</text>
  <text start="387.79" dur="6.12">at you as though you didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;re investigating to try and affirm</text>
  <text start="393.91" dur="5.69">that innocence or prove beyond a</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="3.53">reasonable doubt that you were guilty</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="5.26">our country would be such a very</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="3.66">different and dangerous place if</text>
  <text start="405.64" dur="4.35">prosecutors applied the Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="5.37">standard and citizens were obliged to</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="5.1">prove conclusively that no criminal</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="3.35">conduct occurred because they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="421.39" dur="4.92">statements can only be understood as</text>

  <text start="429.46" dur="9.78">not use the words exonerate or the</text>
  <text start="436.63" dur="7.77">proofs excuse me the proof standard that</text>
  <text start="439.24" dur="9.57">we just talked about above about up here</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="6.12">about determining that no conclusively</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="9.45">determining that no criminal conduct</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="10.11">occurred because those are not in our</text>

  <text start="498.22" dur="6.48">closing its investigation they had only</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="5.46">one job to provide the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="504.7" dur="4.71">with a confidential report explaining</text>
