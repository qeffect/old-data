  <text start="9.51" dur="4.169">definitely yesterday during my</text>
  <text start="11.61" dur="6.3">livestream I kind of speculated that I</text>
  <text start="13.679" dur="8.041">would and mused about doing a video</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="5.279">proving the memo using the mainstream</text>
  <text start="21.72" dur="3.78">media because people are saying this</text>

  <text start="29.73" dur="4.349">saying this is all lies it&amp;#39;s all lies</text>
  <text start="31.619" dur="4.861">well I took some time today and I went</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="4.921">through and I found several reports that</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="4.32">back up the entire memo here outside of</text>
  <text start="39" dur="4.14">what is obviously confidential to us</text>
  <text start="40.8" dur="8.16">like what was in the face so application</text>
  <text start="43.14" dur="7.439">but the rest of it is is basically you</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="3.45">know justified by the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="50.579" dur="3.96">itself so I&amp;#39;m gonna go through those</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="4.23">articles very quickly with you point by</text>

  <text start="63.3" dur="3.87">to please stay here because it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="4.469">interesting it&amp;#39;s an it&amp;#39;s a question that</text>
  <text start="67.17" dur="5.39">I&amp;#39;d love you guys to think about and</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="6.841">give me a perspective on so off we go</text>
  <text start="72.56" dur="6.97">point 1 media reports that fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="5.519">paid Christopher Steele so here we have</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="5.729">0.1 the dossier was compiled by</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="5.581">Christopher Steele and the DNC and the</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="3.871">Clinton campaign formed an essential</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="4.559">part of the kite Carter Page feist</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="4.529">application steele was a source who was</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="4.89">paid over 160 thousand dollars by the</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="7.14">DNC and the Clinton campaign via perkins</text>
  <text start="96.689" dur="5.97">coie and fusion gps so I have a lunch of</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="4.35">stuff here I have one article here for</text>
  <text start="102.659" dur="7.401">him one article from Reuters I think</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="4.911">pretty much sums it up shall we</text>
  <text start="110.84" dur="12.819">X British spy paid 160 thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="11.779">for Trump dossier and we can see the</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="2.96">money paid to Orbis</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="8.52">where am i finding it where am i finding</text>
  <text start="130.789" dur="7.651">it sorry about that</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="6.03">fusion GPS a statement said it had told</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="6.299">Congress about how 168,000 was paid last</text>
  <text start="142.01" dur="5.01">year to Orbis which is steals company</text>
  <text start="144.739" dur="4.861">the money paid to Orbis was taken from</text>
  <text start="147.02" dur="4.98">1.2 million it received from Perkins</text>
  <text start="149.6" dur="4.68">Coie the law firm that represented the</text>
  <text start="152" dur="4.98">DNC and Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s presidential</text>
  <text start="154.28" dur="3.81">campaign there we go I think that pretty</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="7.41">much clears that up</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="8.19">we&amp;#39;re gonna go to point B which is the</text>
  <text start="164.39" dur="3.9">initial FISA application notes Steele</text>
  <text start="166.28" dur="4.65">was working for a named us person but</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="6.24">does not name GPS and Simpson who paid</text>
  <text start="170.93" dur="5.4">Perkins Coie representing the DNC the</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="4.08">application does not mention Steele was</text>
  <text start="176.33" dur="5.34">ultimately working on behalf of them or</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="5.52">that the FBI had separately authorized</text>
  <text start="181.67" dur="6.06">payment to steal now what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="8.19">about this is the original FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="187.73" dur="8.16">was issued in October of 2016 it needs</text>
  <text start="192.32" dur="6.78">to be renewed every 90 days right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="5.939">what they say so my question would be if</text>
  <text start="199.1" dur="5.1">as we know they&amp;#39;re relying on a yahoo</text>
  <text start="201.829" dur="8.431">news report to bolster the application</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="8.7">for FISA why wouldn&amp;#39;t they equally as be</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="4.89">equally as reliant on the media to</text>
  <text start="212.9" dur="4.17">counteracts and show them who&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="4.5">on this dossier like did the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="5.4">judge just read selectively things that</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="4.76">were handed to them because these</text>
  <text start="222.47" dur="4.769">reports I&amp;#39;m about to show you</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="5.919">reporting on DNC ties in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="4.62">came out before the FISA warrant would</text>
  <text start="230.329" dur="7.171">have needed to be reviewed renewed the</text>
  <text start="231.859" dur="7.561">first time like this one for example the</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="6.57">making of the bombshell trump dossier</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="6.21">that was January 12 2017 nine days</text>
  <text start="244.07" dur="5.789">before the FISA warrant would have need</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="6.75">to be renewed nine days in this article</text>
  <text start="249.859" dur="8.121">basically just bolsters the whole DNC</text>
  <text start="252.38" dur="5.6">you know Christopher Steele connection</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="7.62">and fusion GPS and that&amp;#39;s again just</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="7.32">some I&amp;#39;m sorry January 12 2017 before</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="6.75">Trump is even inaugurated let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="7.41">this one from Business Insider explosive</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="5.76">memo suggests that a trump Russia quid</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="5.25">pro quo was at the heart of the gops</text>
  <text start="278.64" dur="6.18">dramatic shift on Ukraine an unverified</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="4.62">dossier alleges that Donald Trump agreed</text>

  <text start="290.49" dur="4.92">stole from prominent Democrat inboxes to</text>
  <text start="292.89" dur="4.74">WikiLeaks and here we go I believe this</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="6.63">was the article where they talk about</text>
  <text start="297.63" dur="7.05">how the FBI is paying the Christopher</text>

  <text start="406.32" dur="6.63">from BBC and is that the first article</text>
  <text start="410.79" dur="5.96">that I could find the earliest one that</text>
