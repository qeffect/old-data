  <text start="61.12" dur="6.66">know when they figured you out and how</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="9.25">yeah so I was planning on laying low</text>
  <text start="67.78" dur="8.25">after the first undercover story that</text>
  <text start="72.85" dur="7.379">was done by Project Veritas where I came</text>
  <text start="76.03" dur="6.72">out anonymously and told the world that</text>
  <text start="80.229" dur="5.581">Google was not what people thought that</text>
  <text start="82.75" dur="8.009">it was that it was a biased company that</text>
  <text start="85.81" dur="8.73">was bent on interfering with elections</text>
  <text start="90.759" dur="10.081">and so I returned back to San Francisco</text>
  <text start="94.54" dur="8.429">and I was you know going forward with my</text>
  <text start="100.84" dur="3.87">life and then what happened is that</text>
  <text start="102.969" dur="5.01">Google was able to figure out that it</text>
  <text start="104.71" dur="7.049">was me uh their law firm sent me a</text>
  <text start="107.979" dur="9.841">letter that wanted to grab like my</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="9.39">laptop my all my data my backups and go</text>
  <text start="117.82" dur="7.649">through it and shortly after that an</text>
  <text start="121.149" dur="7.771">online Insider trolled me and outed me</text>
  <text start="125.469" dur="5.221">on a low comment threat and so at that</text>
  <text start="128.92" dur="1.979">point I realized oh no they know who I</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="3">am</text>
  <text start="130.899" dur="4.891">and they&amp;#39;re going to be you know coming</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="4.62">after me and the attorneys that I talked</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="4.5">to told me that the letter that they had</text>
  <text start="138.31" dur="4.59">sent me was the first step and Google</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="6.36">ruining my life and that they would pull</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="7.199">Oh stops in order to financially ruin me</text>
  <text start="146.65" dur="6.3">that they would lie in courts saying</text>
  <text start="150.099" dur="5.191">that I had hacked their systems in order</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="4.41">to grab their documents which is not</text>

  <text start="157.36" dur="7.409">publicly available to every full-time</text>
  <text start="160.379" dur="6.97">employee inside of the company and so I</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="5.101">decided that I was going to let Google</text>

  <text start="251.29" dur="6.979">the door and the police decided to</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="5.91">escalate they called in a bomb threat</text>

  <text start="272.349" dur="7.531">diaper snipers on the opposing rooftops</text>
  <text start="276.46" dur="6.03">and I didn&amp;#39;t know any of this was</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="6.42">happening until I started hearing a</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="6.84">helicopter circling around my house at</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="4.5">this time my best friend was concerned</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="3.78">that something might be going down</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="5.52">because police had come to his house</text>
  <text start="293.11" dur="6.03">before they came to mine and so he</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="6.78">arrived in San Francisco he noticed that</text>
  <text start="299.14" dur="6.69">the police had three blocks blocked off</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="3.51">so they had blocked off you know from</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="4.74">20th</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="5.82">down to 22nd and there&amp;#39;s like a block</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s like a street in between let me</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="4.17">stop you for one second you mentioned</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="3.36">your friend here and he was in a</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="4.44">different state and they went to his</text>
  <text start="318.04" dur="4.98">house as well is it because he was in a</text>
  <text start="321.04" dur="5.73">different city so he lived in Richmond I</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="7.53">lived in San Francisco and I had listed</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="4.5">his house as my address too as it as a</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="4.32">decoy</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="5.61">ah well poor guy yeah so the police</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="3.45">first came to his house and wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="4.29">leave him alone they were really trying</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="4.56">to get a get at me so he actually called</text>
  <text start="341.17" dur="3.69">me at first before the police came to my</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="6.18">house and said you know the police just</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="5.85">came by and they really really want to</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="4.53">talk to you and I think there I think</text>
  <text start="350.71" dur="4.47">they want to arrest you and so I was</text>
  <text start="353.59" dur="3.96">like huh well I wonder if that means</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re gonna be at my house next and 30</text>
  <text start="357.55" dur="6.06">minutes later knock knock knock at my</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="4.89">house you know Tracy and I mean it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="363.61" dur="5.16">prayer and everybody else listening to</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="5.34">the whole swatting thing it is it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="368.77" dur="3.9">of those it&amp;#39;s for some people it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="370.42" dur="4.71">Internet prank where especially it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="4.92">being it&amp;#39;s done to live streamers where</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="5.07">you want to swat somebody you report</text>
  <text start="377.59" dur="5.07">them to the police for some really</text>
  <text start="380.2" dur="5.85">egregious crimes so that they send over</text>
  <text start="382.66" dur="5.52">a SWAT unit so that hopefully you can</text>
  <text start="386.05" dur="4.35">catch on screen while somebody is</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="3.96">streaming a video game or something the</text>
  <text start="390.4" dur="4.98">door is kicked down and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="392.14" dur="7.38">the the problem is that people die this</text>
  <text start="395.38" dur="6.63">way yeah so to think about this and also</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="5.37">hear mr. Voorhees here talking about</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="5.22">just preparing himself for possible</text>
  <text start="404.89" dur="4.71">death I mean this is this is some</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="4.8">serious stuff</text>
  <text start="409.6" dur="5.22">that end up like you know when when this</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="5.07">was after the anonymous report so they</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="3.75">figured you out somehow somehow I mean</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="4.17">you know whatever so they figure you out</text>
  <text start="418.57" dur="6.09">and then this happens when a month after</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="7.17">a week after how a person after me they</text>
  <text start="424.66" dur="10.79">sent me a letter and then this happened</text>
  <text start="428.44" dur="10.74">about a week later so they yeah so</text>
  <text start="435.45" dur="5.77">that&amp;#39;s the way it is the thing is is</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="3.54">that so there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="3.51">backstory here and the back story is</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="5.07">that you know when they sent me a letter</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="6.69">asking to get all my data I responded</text>
  <text start="447.79" dur="7.71">saying that&amp;#39;s I had retained their data</text>
  <text start="451.42" dur="6.12">I had sent it to the Department of</text>
  <text start="455.5" dur="6">Justice you know because they had</text>
  <text start="457.54" dur="5.61">committed a crime and so they knew that</text>
  <text start="461.5" dur="3.45">they didn&amp;#39;t know that I was the leaker</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="3.54">but they knew that I had that I had</text>
  <text start="464.95" dur="5.46">retained some of their files and I had</text>
  <text start="466.69" dur="5.1">sent it to law enforcement and so the</text>
  <text start="470.41" dur="3.21">fact that they were able to put teeth</text>
  <text start="471.79" dur="3.69">you know put two and two together and</text>
  <text start="473.62" dur="4.77">realized that I was the project Veritas</text>
  <text start="475.48" dur="4.5">there ah you know I was like okay well</text>
  <text start="478.39" dur="5.07">they they figured me out at this point</text>
  <text start="479.98" dur="6.15">so so when did they let you go from the</text>
  <text start="483.46" dur="5.4">company then I actually resigned I</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="6.75">resigned I put on my resignation letter</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="6.93">I think June 14th and I was and my</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="6.72">official resignation date was June 28th</text>
  <text start="495.79" dur="6.87">but they accepted my resignation within</text>
  <text start="499.6" dur="6.12">24 hours and said there&amp;#39;s no need to</text>
  <text start="502.66" dur="3.81">come into work anymore hey Zack let me</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="3.75">ask you something</text>
  <text start="506.47" dur="6.3">because I think the first real the first</text>
  <text start="509.47" dur="7.17">real round of all of this these Expos</text>
  <text start="512.77" dur="6.899">a&amp;#39;s and of the it&amp;#39;s just pretty much</text>
  <text start="516.64" dur="4.95">exposing what&amp;#39;s going on at google</text>
  <text start="519.669" dur="4.831">weather or just whether it be things</text>
  <text start="521.59" dur="4.8">that are technically ripping into the</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="3.99">foundation of how they do things or</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="5.28">whether it just be like how james</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="7.14">d&amp;#39;amour showed us the the the the very</text>
  <text start="531.67" dur="6.66">rigid culture there where they were it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="6.48">impossible for these people to even look</text>
  <text start="538.33" dur="4.38">at the biological facts of nature and</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="3.02">they</text>
  <text start="542.71" dur="5.79">they want to be able to just steamroll</text>
  <text start="545.13" dur="5.05">humanity and in some way in a cultural</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="4.11">way and within the culture within the</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="5.01">company so we know that you you bring</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="4.229">that mindset of the world and you bring</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="3.54">it together with the technical know-how</text>
  <text start="556.839" dur="3.991">to actually shape the way that</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="3.96">technology is used there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="4.8">problems there and here you are pretty</text>
  <text start="562.69" dur="7.399">much providing the most in-depth look</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="7.5">into how that worldview has pretty much</text>
  <text start="570.089" dur="5.711">permeated the way that the via the</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="5.22">technology is designed and implemented</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="4.59">what are your are you looking at this</text>
  <text start="578.35" dur="4.35">when you started seeing and putting all</text>
  <text start="580.39" dur="6.24">the two and two together and collecting</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="6.87">all of this this awful information that</text>
  <text start="586.63" dur="5.22">you know is was just off is that just a</text>
  <text start="589.57" dur="3.69">matter of you saying hey I want to live</text>
  <text start="591.85" dur="5.4">in this country and have it be free and</text>
  <text start="593.26" dur="6.03">open or is it is there any kind of you</text>
  <text start="597.25" dur="4.38">know what&amp;#39;s your personal politics I</text>
  <text start="599.29" dur="4.98">should I should say okay so I consider</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="5.76">myself to be a liberal I went to Barack</text>
  <text start="604.27" dur="7.97">Obama&amp;#39;s 2008 inauguration in Washington</text>
  <text start="607.39" dur="9.36">DC and I became very disillusioned as</text>
  <text start="612.24" dur="6.82">Barack Obama like started toppling like</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="4.23">country after country I think he won a</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="4.529">Nobel Peace Prize right before he</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="5.04">destroyed Libya and so I started to</text>
  <text start="623.589" dur="3.75">becoming disillusioned and I was like</text>
  <text start="626.02" dur="3">what&amp;#39;s going on here what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="627.339" dur="3.69">here I don&amp;#39;t understand it and for me</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="3.689">like I&amp;#39;ve got this obsessive quality</text>
  <text start="631.029" dur="3.361">that I have to understand something it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.709" dur="7.5">what makes me a really great engineer</text>
  <text start="634.39" dur="7.41">and so you know Google had this you know</text>
  <text start="640.209" dur="3.171">they had this front where they were like</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="4.56">hey we&amp;#39;re all about self-expression</text>
  <text start="643.38" dur="5.079">expressing yourself through you know</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="3.06">this open platform that we&amp;#39;ve given you</text>
  <text start="648.459" dur="3.211">know everyone it&amp;#39;s reason why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="649.42" dur="6.63">called you know YouTube and not our tube</text>
  <text start="651.67" dur="8.34">and so you know as a liberal I thought</text>
  <text start="656.05" dur="6">that Google was aligned with my value</text>
  <text start="660.01" dur="4.11">system you know that&amp;#39;s the reason why I</text>
  <text start="662.05" dur="4.83">you know joined Google I thought that</text>
  <text start="664.12" dur="4.35">they were ideologically aligned with you</text>
  <text start="666.88" dur="3.42">know what I thought was important and I</text>
  <text start="668.47" dur="4.29">think what most people think you know</text>
  <text start="670.3" dur="5.039">it&amp;#39;s important because everyone loves</text>
  <text start="672.76" dur="3.9">freedom and so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="675.339" dur="4.11">political alignment</text>
  <text start="676.66" dur="5.13">the reason why you know so I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="679.449" dur="5.731">important to understand exactly what</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="6.419">happened at Google what happened at</text>
  <text start="685.18" dur="6.449">Google is that they did a complete 180</text>
  <text start="688.209" dur="5.55">degree change right after Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="691.629" dur="4.111">won the election this was my next</text>
  <text start="693.759" dur="5.43">question so you&amp;#39;re very smart man keep</text>
  <text start="695.74" dur="5.61">doing and what happened was you know</text>
  <text start="699.189" dur="6.541">right after Donald Trump had his</text>
  <text start="701.35" dur="7.799">surprise win the company had this like</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="6.93">moment where I mean I think I remember</text>
  <text start="709.149" dur="5.49">it as TGIF which is a weekly meeting</text>
  <text start="712.66" dur="4.469">that they have for the entire company</text>
  <text start="714.639" dur="6.831">and at this TGIF</text>
  <text start="717.129" dur="8.161">the company talked about how racism</text>
  <text start="721.47" dur="7.419">sexism and misogyny were the reason why</text>
  <text start="725.29" dur="6">Donald Trump got elected and that you</text>
  <text start="728.889" dur="8.161">know clearly like fake information was</text>
  <text start="731.29" dur="8.489">used to do that big news and also Russia</text>
  <text start="737.05" dur="6.18">hacked the election mm-hmm and this is</text>
  <text start="739.779" dur="6.42">really weird because you know this this</text>
  <text start="743.23" dur="5.58">narrative was being countered with real</text>
  <text start="746.199" dur="5.13">information you know such as you were</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="4.68">providing Tracy and and America owes you</text>
  <text start="751.329" dur="4.831">a debt of gratitude for that thank you</text>
  <text start="753.49" dur="5.19">but as the facts are coming out it</text>
  <text start="756.16" dur="6.15">turned out that the Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="758.68" dur="5.37">narrative was fake news and that it was</text>
  <text start="762.31" dur="5.25">all made up it was all bought in by the</text>
  <text start="764.05" dur="6.45">deep state in order to try to get rid of</text>
  <text start="767.56" dur="4.56">Donald Trump and so what happened is the</text>
  <text start="770.5" dur="6.24">company went from this really great</text>
  <text start="772.12" dur="6.63">company to clown world and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="776.74" dur="4.949">really seem like any of the facts for</text>
  <text start="778.75" dur="4.889">reaching the executives oh do you think</text>
  <text start="781.689" dur="3.811">that they were getting this directive</text>
  <text start="783.639" dur="3.69">from elsewhere that they just made an</text>
  <text start="785.5" dur="3.389">internal decision that this is what they</text>
  <text start="787.329" dur="3.51">were going to do because it obviously</text>
  <text start="788.889" dur="4.711">flies in the face of everything logical</text>
  <text start="790.839" dur="4.711">so that&amp;#39;s my weirdness and I know you</text>
  <text start="793.6" dur="5.089">we&amp;#39;ve got CrowdStrike alignment here too</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="5.849">so I&amp;#39;m curious about that as well yeah</text>
  <text start="798.689" dur="4.96">at this point like I&amp;#39;ve done enough</text>
  <text start="801.399" dur="4.41">digging with the different social media</text>
  <text start="803.649" dur="4.68">companies that I don&amp;#39;t have my</text>
  <text start="805.809" dur="4.591">suspicions that the executives really</text>
  <text start="808.329" dur="5.781">aren&amp;#39;t in control of the company</text>
  <text start="810.4" dur="7.02">that they are more like shaker heads</text>
  <text start="814.11" dur="5.41">delivering on a narrative from the</text>
  <text start="817.42" dur="3.96">controllers that sit above them and kind</text>
  <text start="819.52" dur="4.02">of operate from the shadows that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="821.38" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s the if you apply Occam&amp;#39;s razor</text>
  <text start="823.54" dur="6">and that&amp;#39;s the conclusion that one would</text>
  <text start="827.05" dur="5.1">come to I mean I I&amp;#39;m with that one I</text>
  <text start="829.54" dur="4.08">mean hey you just saw the New York Times</text>
  <text start="832.15" dur="4.5">I was gonna cover a little bit on this</text>
  <text start="833.62" dur="6">with tonight&amp;#39;s show but the New York</text>
  <text start="836.65" dur="4.53">Times that that audio that that</text>
  <text start="839.62" dur="4.11">information coming out of there were</text>
  <text start="841.18" dur="6">they pretty much said we retooled and</text>
  <text start="843.73" dur="6.57">repurposed our entire paper to covering</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="5.37">this Russia collusion nonsense and now</text>
  <text start="850.3" dur="4.289">that that is completely been disproven</text>
  <text start="852.55" dur="4.08">and they were able to get themselves all</text>
  <text start="854.589" dur="4.621">these awards for their stupid coverage</text>
  <text start="856.63" dur="5.79">along the way now they have to switch</text>
  <text start="859.21" dur="5.64">and completely refocus on trying to sell</text>
  <text start="862.42" dur="5.34">racism so you tell me that is that is</text>
  <text start="864.85" dur="5.7">that even a newspaper or is it just some</text>
  <text start="867.76" dur="6.66">kind of a propagandistic booster club</text>
  <text start="870.55" dur="5.76">night and now I&amp;#39;m propped up yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="874.42" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m applying that to everything you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="876.31" dur="4.26">saying right now with Google what makes</text>
  <text start="878.95" dur="3.21">you what did you I don&amp;#39;t if you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="880.57" dur="3.87">answer this that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fine but what</text>
  <text start="882.16" dur="4.29">what did you see maybe not specifically</text>
  <text start="884.44" dur="3.98">that makes you believe that from the</text>
  <text start="886.45" dur="4.5">inside and also if you could clarify</text>
  <text start="888.42" dur="5.05">what you you know you&amp;#39;re a senior</text>
  <text start="890.95" dur="4.32">engineer you were you up higher than</text>
  <text start="893.47" dur="7.5">most did you have a staff under you</text>
  <text start="895.27" dur="9">explain that as well yeah so there was a</text>
  <text start="900.97" dur="5.28">meeting for the company now I want to</text>
  <text start="904.27" dur="4.47">clarify that you know I work for Google</text>
  <text start="906.25" dur="4.14">and Google owns YouTube and right and</text>
  <text start="908.74" dur="4.5">when I left I was a senior software</text>
  <text start="910.39" dur="5.55">engineer for YouTube hmm but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="913.24" dur="4.32">with Google for eight years I started</text>
  <text start="915.94" dur="4.05">off with that with Google Earth so if</text>
  <text start="917.56" dur="4.2">anyone has any you know questions about</text>
  <text start="919.99" dur="3.45">that you know I started off working for</text>
  <text start="921.76" dur="3.81">Google and I ended up working for</text>
  <text start="923.44" dur="4.43">YouTube for the last three years got it</text>
  <text start="925.57" dur="5.33">okay</text>
  <text start="927.87" dur="6.28">YouTube had an event called steam and</text>
  <text start="930.9" dur="7.71">the steam event is for employees and</text>
  <text start="934.15" dur="7.92">some insiders within the industry and</text>
  <text start="938.61" dur="5.05">Susan wachowski the CEO of YouTube went</text>
  <text start="942.07" dur="4.709">on stage</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="6.33">and she delivered the speech about how</text>
  <text start="946.779" dur="6.151">Google was going to change the</text>
  <text start="949.99" dur="5.219">definition or they were going to start D</text>
  <text start="952.93" dur="5.13">ranking fake news they were going to</text>
  <text start="955.209" dur="8.281">start boosting authoritative content and</text>
  <text start="958.06" dur="8.459">the video was was so horrifying and so</text>
  <text start="963.49" dur="5.73">baffling that I recorded it and</text>
  <text start="966.519" dur="4.74">disclosed as part of the dump and if</text>
  <text start="969.22" dur="3.539">someone just wants to see the video</text>
  <text start="971.259" dur="4.101">without going through the dump they can</text>
  <text start="972.759" dur="5.76">go to my Twitter perpetual maniac and</text>
  <text start="975.36" dur="6.31">they can see it as one of the last I</text>
  <text start="978.519" dur="4.951">think 15 posts when you walk into this</text>
  <text start="981.67" dur="4.05">event do they confiscate your cell</text>
  <text start="983.47" dur="4.71">phones or are they so brazen that they</text>
  <text start="985.72" dur="4.5">assume every single person there is a</text>
  <text start="988.18" dur="5.279">mindless zombie who agrees with them the</text>
  <text start="990.22" dur="5.94">latter Wow are you ever see that picture</text>
  <text start="993.459" dur="4.711">where like everyone is like saluting to</text>
  <text start="996.16" dur="4.289">the Nazis and there&amp;#39;s like that one guy</text>
  <text start="998.17" dur="4.409">with his hands like underneath I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="1000.449" dur="6.45">I&amp;#39;m not gonna participate in that that</text>
  <text start="1002.579" dur="6.721">guy&amp;#39;s me literally so so pulling</text>
  <text start="1006.899" dur="5.67">yourself aside though would how would</text>
  <text start="1009.3" dur="5.7">you estimate what kind of a contingent</text>
  <text start="1012.569" dur="4.08">of people inside of Google I guess in</text>
  <text start="1015" dur="4.259">any department and in all departments</text>
  <text start="1016.649" dur="4.771">what contingent out there is thinking</text>
  <text start="1019.259" dur="5.07">like you what no matter their political</text>
  <text start="1021.42" dur="4.95">their personal political views well how</text>
  <text start="1024.329" dur="4.201">many people like you are starting to</text>
  <text start="1026.37" dur="6.689">starting to see that company practice</text>
  <text start="1028.53" dur="6.33">actually runs it runs contrary to the</text>
  <text start="1033.059" dur="5.581">desire to actually live in a free nation</text>
  <text start="1034.86" dur="6.689">right so I would separate people into</text>
  <text start="1038.64" dur="5.789">like the three groups most of the people</text>
  <text start="1041.549" dur="4.65">are true believers and that&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="1044.429" dur="5.73">little quote true believers that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1046.199" dur="6.811">term meaning no matter what the company</text>
  <text start="1050.159" dur="5.871">does they&amp;#39;ll believe in it then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1053.01" dur="7.32">like these this middle layer which is</text>
  <text start="1056.03" dur="7.72">can I guess the next you know next block</text>
  <text start="1060.33" dur="5.43">which is they they are like this is kind</text>
  <text start="1063.75" dur="4.83">of weird entirely understanding but</text>
  <text start="1065.76" dur="4.799">there&amp;#39;s a lot of smart people you know</text>
  <text start="1068.58" dur="3.9">that believe in this so I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="1070.559" dur="4.081">sort of go along with that but this is</text>
  <text start="1072.48" dur="4.949">really weird and and that&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="1074.64" dur="7.119">next sizable you know majority</text>
  <text start="1077.429" dur="6.671">and then there&amp;#39;s some minority of people</text>
  <text start="1081.759" dur="5.28">that are like this is really really</text>
  <text start="1084.1" dur="6.51">messed up they are you know controlled</text>
  <text start="1087.039" dur="6.51">by someone above the executive level and</text>
  <text start="1090.61" dur="6.629">they&amp;#39;re trying to overthrow America but</text>
  <text start="1093.549" dur="5.161">you know we you know and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1097.239" dur="3.15">sort of waiting around trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1098.71" dur="4.589">out what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on some of them</text>
  <text start="1100.389" dur="4.77">are organizing you know I</text>
  <text start="1103.299" dur="7.11">there was a small Patriot Network that I</text>
  <text start="1105.159" dur="6.99">was part of Wow and and we were all just</text>
  <text start="1110.409" dur="3.96">like okay I guess I guess they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1112.149" dur="4.74">try to push this into communism again</text>
  <text start="1114.369" dur="4.321">and those are the ones that you know</text>
  <text start="1116.889" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of these dystopian</text>
  <text start="1118.69" dur="5.819">novels like 1984 you know brave new</text>
  <text start="1121.059" dur="5.521">world and have you know understand the</text>
  <text start="1124.509" dur="6">horrors of communism and so we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1126.58" dur="6.99">this pattern before and we know what the</text>
  <text start="1130.509" dur="5.91">steps are that will deliver sort of like</text>
  <text start="1133.57" dur="4.799">a communist revolution and so we&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1136.419" dur="4.44">ones looking in at this going okay well</text>
  <text start="1138.369" dur="5.571">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re clearly going for an</text>
  <text start="1140.859" dur="5.25">overthrow a move of the governments and</text>
  <text start="1143.94" dur="4.059">every single time they advance that</text>
  <text start="1146.109" dur="3.211">agenda we&amp;#39;re like okay this is another</text>
  <text start="1147.999" dur="6.15">step this is the way that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1149.32" dur="6.689">and what I realized is that as one of</text>
  <text start="1154.149" dur="3.75">these people one of these minority</text>
  <text start="1156.009" dur="4.23">people that that new history knew what</text>
  <text start="1157.899" dur="5.01">they were doing I had the unique ability</text>
  <text start="1160.239" dur="5.101">to provide the evidence that they were</text>
  <text start="1162.909" dur="5.1">doing this and I also had the that the</text>
  <text start="1165.34" dur="6.209">know-how or the the mindset to capture</text>
  <text start="1168.009" dur="6.9">this and because people you know in this</text>
  <text start="1171.549" dur="5.25">company are so indoctrinated I mean</text>
  <text start="1174.909" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;ve got internal classes that they</text>
  <text start="1176.799" dur="5.13">have to doctrine eight people by telling</text>
  <text start="1178.509" dur="5.971">them that they&amp;#39;re racist and that test</text>
  <text start="1181.929" dur="4.921">was called the implicit association test</text>
  <text start="1184.48" dur="4.559">and it was developed at Stanford and</text>
  <text start="1186.85" dur="4.829">then it was so discredited that Google</text>
  <text start="1189.039" dur="5.58">stopped making it mandatory for their</text>
  <text start="1191.679" dur="6.511">employees and so tests like this is how</text>
  <text start="1194.619" dur="5.25">they doctrine ate their employees to to</text>
  <text start="1198.19" dur="2.959">think that they&amp;#39;re you know bad people</text>
  <text start="1199.869" dur="4.02">and that they need to atone for</text>
  <text start="1201.149" dur="5.681">themselves by eliminating bias from the</text>
  <text start="1203.889" dur="5.101">search results oh my gosh this is my</text>
  <text start="1206.83" dur="3.25">fuck all right god no it&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1208.99" dur="3.49">fine we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re free</text>
  <text start="1210.08" dur="6.54">on this podcast um trust me Frank is</text>
  <text start="1212.48" dur="6.03">here that&amp;#39;s all so no I mean this is</text>
  <text start="1216.62" dur="3.63">scary it really is like we went through</text>
  <text start="1218.51" dur="3.33">some of these documents can we can we</text>
  <text start="1220.25" dur="8.399">like maybe touch on a couple of things</text>
  <text start="1221.84" dur="8.85">that you were just please do so so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1228.649" dur="4.291">in the mindset of doing what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1230.69" dur="3.93">that they&amp;#39;re moving towards like this</text>
  <text start="1232.94" dur="3.27">communist revolution and that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1234.62" dur="4.2">like ramping up racism and all this</text>
  <text start="1236.21" dur="5.189">other stuff to destabilize America and</text>
  <text start="1238.82" dur="4.41">so what I realize is that well since</text>
  <text start="1241.399" dur="3.15">these people are indoctrinated they have</text>
  <text start="1243.23" dur="4.14">no idea that the things that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1244.549" dur="6.211">saying are just absolutely extreme and</text>
  <text start="1247.37" dur="5.13">as a result all of this information like</text>
  <text start="1250.76" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ve just said it and they just put</text>
  <text start="1252.5" dur="5.519">their design documents on the public</text>
  <text start="1254.99" dur="5.909">internal Internet and it was just there</text>
  <text start="1258.019" dur="4.29">for everyone so I grabbed it I grabbed</text>
  <text start="1260.899" dur="3.601">everything that I could find</text>
  <text start="1262.309" dur="4.171">I would download a paper I would read it</text>
  <text start="1264.5" dur="5.82">I would find the keywords and then I</text>
  <text start="1266.48" dur="6.329">would go and grab the related papers and</text>
  <text start="1270.32" dur="4.349">over I just repeated this over and over</text>
  <text start="1272.809" dur="4.411">and over again until I had you know over</text>
  <text start="1274.669" dur="5.581">a thousand pages of documents that I</text>
  <text start="1277.22" dur="5.13">could you know deliver to the media and</text>
  <text start="1280.25" dur="4.049">to the law enforcement you know and to</text>
  <text start="1282.35" dur="3.689">the trouble administration and say here</text>
  <text start="1284.299" dur="4.38">you go here&amp;#39;s all the evidence you need</text>
  <text start="1286.039" dur="4.801">in order to do discovery in a judicial</text>
  <text start="1288.679" dur="4.531">setting so that&amp;#39;s where we are today</text>
  <text start="1290.84" dur="3.689">I mean what you&amp;#39;ve done here is we</text>
  <text start="1293.21" dur="3.27">started like I said we were looking</text>
  <text start="1294.529" dur="3.9">through some of this stuff to the I</text>
  <text start="1296.48" dur="4.26">guess basically like the lists that</text>
  <text start="1298.429" dur="4.261">would trigger a oh yeah the suppression</text>
  <text start="1300.74" dur="5.789">terms like yeah well triggering out an</text>
  <text start="1302.69" dur="6.27">applet or a a a little program or</text>
  <text start="1306.529" dur="5.12">whatever you want to call it um - it was</text>
  <text start="1308.96" dur="7.05">called the twiddle I believe yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="1311.649" dur="5.89">suppress blacklisted phrases yeah so I</text>
  <text start="1316.01" dur="2.909">have a couple questions about that and</text>
  <text start="1317.539" dur="2.73">maybe you can lend some insight now</text>
  <text start="1318.919" dur="2.73">obviously what I found really</text>
  <text start="1320.269" dur="4.04">interesting was of course there were a</text>
  <text start="1321.649" dur="4.74">bunch of conservative or truth based</text>
  <text start="1324.309" dur="3.73">outlets on there but you know who else</text>
  <text start="1326.389" dur="3.78">was on there Media Matters</text>
  <text start="1328.039" dur="5.431">yeah so you&amp;#39;re talking about the Google</text>
  <text start="1330.169" dur="4.711">now blacklist yeah Media Matters was on</text>
  <text start="1333.47" dur="3.209">there but I mean Media Matters is pretty</text>
  <text start="1334.88" dur="3.99">extreme but most of the people that were</text>
  <text start="1336.679" dur="2.85">blacklisted were conservative sites on</text>
  <text start="1338.87" dur="3.21">that list</text>
  <text start="1339.529" dur="4.321">mm-hmm yeah and explain how that works</text>
  <text start="1342.08" dur="3.06">if somebody searches for that</text>
  <text start="1343.85" dur="2.55">I mean you just released a medium</text>
  <text start="1345.14" dur="2.31">article this morning that will link in</text>
  <text start="1346.4" dur="3.659">the show notes for people as well</text>
  <text start="1347.45" dur="5.19">showing how they mess with autocomplete</text>
  <text start="1350.059" dur="4.74">and they use basically they use they use</text>
  <text start="1352.64" dur="3.51">they say that&amp;#39;s because nobody&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1354.799" dur="2.88">searching for that but then if you</text>
  <text start="1356.15" dur="4.8">compare it to Google Trends which is</text>
  <text start="1357.679" dur="4.351">available that&amp;#39;s not the case and they</text>
  <text start="1360.95" dur="3.69">get it&amp;#39;s basically like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1362.03" dur="4.649">operating a plain site here you&amp;#39;re you</text>
  <text start="1364.64" dur="3.659">can check them and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="1366.679" dur="3.511">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re screaming into a</text>
  <text start="1368.299" dur="4.561">forest and no one hears you do you agree</text>
  <text start="1370.19" dur="4.619">I do I do and they&amp;#39;ve been slandering</text>
  <text start="1372.86" dur="4.11">everyone that points it out as a</text>
  <text start="1374.809" dur="4.23">conspiracy theorist and it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1376.97" dur="4.26">matter if you&amp;#39;re like you know the chief</text>
  <text start="1379.039" dur="4.291">editor of Psychology Today that&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="1381.23" dur="4.14">a credible study on the bias they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1383.33" dur="4.2">gonna call him it&amp;#39;s just like I you know</text>
  <text start="1385.37" dur="8.37">which in fact person&amp;#39;s name is Jeffrey</text>

  <text start="1393.74" dur="4.049">gonna bring him up yeah so they</text>
  <text start="1395.69" dur="5.969">slandered Robert Epstein as a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="1397.789" dur="5.431">theorist and it&amp;#39;s just like they&amp;#39;re it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1401.659" dur="3.991">like everyone&amp;#39;s pointing out that the</text>
  <text start="1403.22" dur="4.62">zebra has stripes and Google is saying</text>
  <text start="1405.65" dur="3.84">no no it&amp;#39;s a white horse and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1407.84" dur="3.36">ridiculous right it&amp;#39;s just that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1409.49" dur="4.65">trying to tell us something that we all</text>
  <text start="1411.2" dur="4.26">know to be true is not true and so I</text>
  <text start="1414.14" dur="3.12">want to talk about the about the</text>
  <text start="1415.46" dur="4.589">blacklist that Google now blacklist so</text>
  <text start="1417.26" dur="5.419">Google now is a product that was kind of</text>
  <text start="1420.049" dur="5.25">fusion of different Google services and</text>
  <text start="1422.679" dur="4.841">one of the things that did was it had</text>
  <text start="1425.299" dur="5.76">news so it sure you liked what you</text>
  <text start="1427.52" dur="5.37">wanted to see but they had a blacklist</text>
  <text start="1431.059" dur="3.87">on it and so when people were searching</text>
  <text start="1432.89" dur="5.49">for news or if people want to just</text>
  <text start="1434.929" dur="7.261">browse news certain sites that Google</text>
  <text start="1438.38" dur="7.799">had deemed undesirable did not make it</text>
  <text start="1442.19" dur="7.59">to Google now search bar and this this</text>
  <text start="1446.179" dur="7.561">Google now I think it it exists on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1449.78" dur="6">built into Android and it exists it on</text>
  <text start="1453.74" dur="3.96">iPhone if you wanted to download it but</text>
  <text start="1455.78" dur="4.62">that was the blacklist and there&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="1457.7" dur="5.19">think a total of eleven blacklist now</text>
  <text start="1460.4" dur="4.8">that have been identified Robert Epstein</text>
  <text start="1462.89" dur="4.38">has identified nine in his research and</text>
  <text start="1465.2" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;ve released two black lists the</text>
  <text start="1467.27" dur="5.31">YouTube query Twitter blacklist and then</text>
  <text start="1469.4" dur="5.61">the Google now blacklist now on the</text>
  <text start="1472.58" dur="2.62">YouTube one and you know me doing a lot</text>
  <text start="1475.01" dur="2.35">of</text>
  <text start="1475.2" dur="3.63">my work up until recently on YouTube I</text>
  <text start="1477.36" dur="4.289">have obviously experienced</text>
  <text start="1478.83" dur="6.42">ridiculousness but what really struck me</text>
  <text start="1481.649" dur="5.581">was the like hundreds of Vegas related</text>
  <text start="1485.25" dur="4.44">blacklisted terms that I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1487.23" dur="4.35">understand the overkill why do you I</text>
  <text start="1489.69" dur="4.65">mean we don&amp;#39;t want to get into a Vegas</text>
  <text start="1491.58" dur="4.319">discussion but why that one topic over</text>
  <text start="1494.34" dur="3.719">so many of the other things that if</text>
  <text start="1495.899" dur="3.27">there was over 12 pages of Vegas terms</text>
  <text start="1498.059" dur="4.201">it was weird</text>
  <text start="1499.169" dur="5.521">yeah and there&amp;#39;s another bug report that</text>
  <text start="1502.26" dur="6.659">I put in there that shows a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="1504.69" dur="8.099">of additional fake news related to the</text>
  <text start="1508.919" dur="5.461">Vegas shooting and you&amp;#39;ll see if people</text>
  <text start="1512.789" dur="4.23">go through they&amp;#39;ll see pages and pages</text>
  <text start="1514.38" dur="5.039">and pages of black listing terms for</text>
  <text start="1517.019" dur="5.731">Steven paddock and different</text>
  <text start="1519.419" dur="5.85">misspellings of his name and also black</text>
  <text start="1522.75" dur="5.37">listing how Steven paddock was</text>
  <text start="1525.269" dur="6.38">anti-trump yeah it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1528.12" dur="7.71">bizarre how all these false flow like oh</text>
  <text start="1531.649" dur="6.01">oh no that&amp;#39;s fine okay so you know a lot</text>
  <text start="1535.83" dur="3.24">of these things that people allege are</text>
  <text start="1537.659" dur="3.9">false flag shootings</text>
  <text start="1539.07" dur="5.16">all of all of them end up in this</text>
  <text start="1541.559" dur="5.161">blacklist over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="1544.23" dur="6.09">and you can see that Google is clearly</text>
  <text start="1546.72" dur="7.679">suppressing people searching for you</text>
  <text start="1550.32" dur="6.81">know David hog crisis actor and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1554.399" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like why does Google have you</text>
  <text start="1557.13" dur="4.35">know a dog in this fight</text>
  <text start="1558.539" dur="4.921">yep yeah you know I was thinking about</text>
  <text start="1561.48" dur="3.569">this before too and I want and I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="1563.46" dur="4.17">you brought up doctor Robert Epstein</text>
  <text start="1565.049" dur="4.74">because even going back to the whole New</text>
  <text start="1567.63" dur="4.529">York Times thing where we know how they</text>
  <text start="1569.789" dur="5.071">retooled their entire paper but the</text>
  <text start="1572.159" dur="5.37">thing with New York Times is they cater</text>
  <text start="1574.86" dur="4.169">to a very small group of people and with</text>
  <text start="1577.529" dur="2.971">the New York Times you have to go out</text>
  <text start="1579.029" dur="3.03">there you have to buy a paper you have</text>
  <text start="1580.5" dur="3.6">to go to their website you have to seek</text>
  <text start="1582.059" dur="4.951">out what they are writing that&amp;#39;s totally</text>
  <text start="1584.1" dur="4.65">up to you and when a search engine is</text>
  <text start="1587.01" dur="4.11">engaged in this stuff though or these</text>
  <text start="1588.75" dur="5.549">technology companies are engaged in this</text>
  <text start="1591.12" dur="4.74">this stuff it is able to impact the way</text>
  <text start="1594.299" dur="4.651">that people see the world in very</text>
  <text start="1595.86" dur="5.669">unsuspecting ways and one thing that you</text>
  <text start="1598.95" dur="4.079">know prior to dr. Robert Epstein showing</text>
  <text start="1601.529" dur="6.331">up before the Senate Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="1603.029" dur="6.091">I had spent a maybe a going back to at</text>
  <text start="1607.86" dur="4.71">least 2040</text>
  <text start="1609.12" dur="5.07">fifteen looking into the early studies</text>
  <text start="1612.57" dur="4.68">that were being done into search engine</text>
  <text start="1614.19" dur="5.55">manipulation effect and how it can it</text>
  <text start="1617.25" dur="5.43">could impact the voting habits of</text>
  <text start="1619.74" dur="5.97">certain demographics in excess of</text>
  <text start="1622.68" dur="4.29">60-percent sometimes and though and the</text>
  <text start="1625.71" dur="3.87">worst thing about all this that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1626.97" dur="5.55">learned is that in 75 percent at a time</text>
  <text start="1629.58" dur="4.47">the people who are being manipulated by</text>
  <text start="1632.52" dur="3.63">these schemes don&amp;#39;t even know that</text>
  <text start="1634.05" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re being affected whether it be by</text>
  <text start="1636.15" dur="6.029">peripheral headline flashing suggested</text>
  <text start="1640.2" dur="5.46">things along the side everybody we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1642.179" dur="6.931">already very very accustomed to taking</text>
  <text start="1645.66" dur="6.149">it talked about this is super super</text>
  <text start="1649.11" dur="3.96">super important yeah because and let me</text>
  <text start="1651.809" dur="3.721">did you keep one more thing in mind when</text>
  <text start="1653.07" dur="4.95">you do it&amp;#39;s about or Epstein he said</text>
  <text start="1655.53" dur="4.8">that between three to ten million votes</text>
  <text start="1658.02" dur="5.52">may have been impacted for 2016 if</text>
  <text start="1660.33" dur="5.76">you&amp;#39;re saying that Google really tighten</text>
  <text start="1663.54" dur="4.68">the screws after Donald Trump won what</text>
  <text start="1666.09" dur="4.589">the hell could possibly be in the works</text>
  <text start="1668.22" dur="4.77">for 2020 yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="1670.679" dur="5.821">so I think that people need to</text>
  <text start="1672.99" dur="8.31">understand how Google was manipulating</text>
  <text start="1676.5" dur="8.52">people and an important piece of</text>
  <text start="1681.3" dur="6.509">background study is the psychology study</text>
  <text start="1685.02" dur="3.96">known as the ash experiment the way that</text>
  <text start="1687.809" dur="4.051">the ash experiment worked</text>
  <text start="1688.98" dur="5.61">is you get a volunteer to participate in</text>
  <text start="1691.86" dur="4.77">a psychology experiment they go into a</text>
  <text start="1694.59" dur="3.36">room and they think that there are a</text>
  <text start="1696.63" dur="2.76">bunch and they see a bunch of other</text>
  <text start="1697.95" dur="3.69">people and they think that there are</text>
  <text start="1699.39" dur="4.85">also volunteers for this psych</text>
  <text start="1701.64" dur="5.1">experiment but in reality everyone else</text>
  <text start="1704.24" dur="5.35">is an actor okay</text>
  <text start="1706.74" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s very important there is an</text>
  <text start="1709.59" dur="5.73">instructor who goes to the chalkboard</text>
  <text start="1711.48" dur="6.9">and he takes his chalk and he writes a</text>
  <text start="1715.32" dur="7.1">line and then he writes a larger line</text>
  <text start="1718.38" dur="6.78">and he asks the classroom which line is</text>
  <text start="1722.42" dur="6.79">larger now here&amp;#39;s the important thing</text>
  <text start="1725.16" dur="7.47">every single actor gives the wrong</text>
  <text start="1729.21" dur="6.57">answer so you know what the true</text>
  <text start="1732.63" dur="4.94">volunteer does changing he changes his</text>
  <text start="1735.78" dur="5.01">answer he also gives the wrong answer</text>
  <text start="1737.57" dur="6.64">and this study has been replicated over</text>
  <text start="1740.79" dur="8.07">and over and over again but it has one</text>
  <text start="1744.21" dur="7.83">tiny weak point if one of the other</text>
  <text start="1748.86" dur="6.53">actors is assigned to give the correct</text>
  <text start="1752.04" dur="6.21">answer the Asch experiment effect is</text>
  <text start="1755.39" dur="5.92">almost completely broken so it just</text>
  <text start="1758.25" dur="8.31">takes one other person takes one Wow and</text>
  <text start="1761.31" dur="8.69">so what&amp;#39;s out is that if they can</text>
  <text start="1766.56" dur="6.42">manipulate just the search suggestions</text>
  <text start="1770" dur="5.2">then they can change a lot of people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1772.98" dur="4.53">minds now why why the search suggestions</text>
  <text start="1775.2" dur="4.35">well what Google stated is that these</text>
  <text start="1777.51" dur="4.14">search suggestions or search predictions</text>
  <text start="1779.55" dur="4.04">that you get when you&amp;#39;re typing in a</text>
  <text start="1781.65" dur="6.57">search query into the Google bar are</text>
  <text start="1783.59" dur="6.52">generated from user data so you see what</text>
  <text start="1788.22" dur="5.82">other people are searching for and that</text>
  <text start="1790.11" dur="5.7">autocompletes your search and so when</text>
  <text start="1794.04" dur="3.69">people go and they search for something</text>
  <text start="1795.81" dur="3.63">if they see other things pop up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1797.73" dur="4.56">like well this is what everybody else is</text>
  <text start="1799.44" dur="5.03">thinking and so you know this relates to</text>
  <text start="1802.29" dur="6">the medium article that I posted today</text>
  <text start="1804.47" dur="6.31">Google went in and deleted political</text>
  <text start="1808.29" dur="4.53">content so that it wouldn&amp;#39;t autocomplete</text>
  <text start="1810.78" dur="5.13">and specifically when someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1812.82" dur="5.25">searching for for example Clinton</text>
  <text start="1815.91" dur="4.62">body-count because there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1818.07" dur="3.96">people that have died around Clinton so</text>
  <text start="1820.53" dur="4.11">when they when they search for Clinton</text>
  <text start="1822.03" dur="5.88">body count it used to autocomplete well</text>
  <text start="1824.64" dur="4.98">now they&amp;#39;ve removed it and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1827.91" dur="4.47">removed it such that when you type in</text>
  <text start="1829.62" dur="6.21">Clinton body it just doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1832.38" dur="5.67">auto complete and you know this was this</text>
  <text start="1835.83" dur="5.13">has been going on you know for a while</text>
  <text start="1838.05" dur="5.58">but they&amp;#39;ve started to put the that</text>
  <text start="1840.96" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;ve started to ramp up this this</text>
  <text start="1843.63" dur="5.34">effect and they&amp;#39;ve started make it</text>
  <text start="1846.39" dur="5.94">started getting really reckless with the</text>
  <text start="1848.97" dur="5.88">bias so that it&amp;#39;s no longer even has a</text>
  <text start="1852.33" dur="4.77">veil of possible deniability so for</text>
  <text start="1854.85" dur="5.67">example you go into Google and you type</text>
  <text start="1857.1" dur="8.12">in men can and it will auto suggest men</text>
  <text start="1860.52" dur="8.79">can have babies and can have periods and</text>
  <text start="1865.22" dur="6.35">these weird social justice terms and you</text>
  <text start="1869.31" dur="4.599">know people that you know are kind of</text>
  <text start="1871.57" dur="3.63">asleep still I&amp;#39;ll think well that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1873.909" dur="3.15">what other people are searching for</text>
  <text start="1875.2" dur="4.62">because I hear it all over into the</text>
  <text start="1877.059" dur="4.47">media and I can disprove that because</text>
  <text start="1879.82" dur="4.739">there&amp;#39;s other Google services that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1881.529" dur="6.181">have this bias so if people go to trends</text>
  <text start="1884.559" dur="5.58">Google comm that service will show you</text>

  <text start="2097.65" dur="4.5">of their pain another interesting thing</text>
  <text start="2099.96" dur="6.36">about this paper is that they said that</text>
  <text start="2102.15" dur="7.59">under certain stressors people&amp;#39;s buying</text>
  <text start="2106.32" dur="6.27">habits increases and so one of the</text>
  <text start="2109.74" dur="8.28">things that they explored was how train</text>
  <text start="2112.59" dur="6.96">crowding caused ad sales to increase Wow</text>

  <text start="2127.86" dur="4.71">Wow and so part of this paper one of</text>

  <text start="2175.319" dur="5.79">turn right you know and what you start</text>
  <text start="2179.13" dur="3.84">seeing these papers you read enough of</text>
  <text start="2181.109" dur="4.95">them you start realizing that Google</text>
  <text start="2182.97" dur="5.129">thinks of us as units that they that we</text>
  <text start="2186.059" dur="4.02">could be programmed yeah and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2188.099" dur="4.5">actually stated it twice and two</text>
  <text start="2190.079" dur="4.98">different major you know internal</text>
  <text start="2192.599" dur="4.921">publications I want to call them where</text>
  <text start="2195.059" dur="4.951">they say that like news media is like</text>
  <text start="2197.52" dur="4.11">aggregated and filtered and yada yada</text>
  <text start="2200.01" dur="5.099">yada and the end result is that people</text>
  <text start="2201.63" dur="8.04">like us are programmed I beg to differ</text>
  <text start="2205.109" dur="9.17">yeah well I mean I mean this blank slate</text>
  <text start="2209.67" dur="7.56">they&amp;#39;re very taken to the extreme so</text>
  <text start="2214.279" dur="4.84">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s get into I&amp;#39;m obviously a</text>
  <text start="2217.23" dur="5.46">little bit curious about what did you do</text>
  <text start="2219.119" dur="6.21">at YouTube so I was a senior software</text>
  <text start="2222.69" dur="5.52">engineer at YouTube and I worked on the</text>
  <text start="2225.329" dur="4.97">embedded YouTube app and so I brought</text>

  <text start="2230.299" dur="7.721">PlayStation 4 intend to switch an Xbox</text>
  <text start="2234.079" dur="5.95">and so Xbox one and it was obviously it</text>
  <text start="2238.02" dur="4.38">wasn&amp;#39;t just me there&amp;#39;s a whole team</text>
  <text start="2240.029" dur="4.77">I also did infrastructure so automated</text>
  <text start="2242.4" dur="4.5">testing of those game consoles and how</text>
  <text start="2244.799" dur="3.691">do you have a host machine you know</text>
  <text start="2246.9" dur="3.78">connect over a network connection and</text>
  <text start="2248.49" dur="5.19">and operate the machine so it can load</text>
  <text start="2250.68" dur="4.29">in a new version of the program and run</text>
  <text start="2253.68" dur="4.59">all the tests and make sure that</text>
  <text start="2254.97" dur="5.369">everything was working just fine so that</text>
  <text start="2258.27" dur="5.61">was my role that&amp;#39;s a big that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="2260.339" dur="5.551">deal it really is a big deal I mean our</text>
  <text start="2263.88" dur="4.26">product was responsible for 10 percent</text>
  <text start="2265.89" dur="4.05">of YouTube&amp;#39;s total traffic yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2268.14" dur="3.54">huge I mean that should be I mean you</text>
  <text start="2269.94" dur="4.47">know how many people are watching</text>
  <text start="2271.68" dur="7.31">my family watches YouTube on gaming</text>
  <text start="2274.41" dur="4.58">console so what you designed every day</text>
  <text start="2280.64" dur="7.63">pretty crazy so you know YouTube became</text>
  <text start="2284.81" dur="5.44">almost based off that video that you</text>
  <text start="2288.27" dur="3.93">showed everyone and I still can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2290.25" dur="4.01">believe the hubris of how they just left</text>
  <text start="2292.2" dur="4.92">this stuff up there thinking that nobody</text>
  <text start="2294.26" dur="4.51">would possibly do what you did and take</text>
  <text start="2297.12" dur="3.51">initiative to actually blow the whistle</text>
  <text start="2298.77" dur="3.48">on this stuff it is that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="2300.63" dur="3.21">things that like they&amp;#39;re just so cocky</text>
  <text start="2302.25" dur="3.03">and I have one more question on that</text>
  <text start="2303.84" dur="3.56">vein first let&amp;#39;s stop there and then</text>
  <text start="2305.28" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;ll go to YouTube what do you think</text>
  <text start="2307.4" dur="5.95">would be a solution to this like how</text>
  <text start="2310.56" dur="4.26">would anybody other than I mean is it</text>
  <text start="2313.35" dur="3.15">obviously this is criminal because it</text>
  <text start="2314.82" dur="4.02">has to do with you know election and</text>
  <text start="2316.5" dur="3.81">propaganda and all that stuff but do you</text>
  <text start="2318.84" dur="2.79">think that a rest would even change</text>
  <text start="2320.31" dur="3.72">anything at this point</text>
  <text start="2321.63" dur="4.59">arrests like if someone if people at</text>
  <text start="2324.03" dur="5.1">Google got arrested for interfering in</text>
  <text start="2326.22" dur="5.16">elections or whatever yeah would that</text>
  <text start="2329.13" dur="6.45">change anything there at all I mean</text>

  <text start="2338.58" dur="5.82">the United States but also in Ireland</text>
  <text start="2340.74" dur="6.27">and also in Brazil and it looks like we</text>
  <text start="2344.4" dur="4.73">had a hand in overthrowing Egypt because</text>
  <text start="2347.01" dur="7.17">the guy who did it was a Google employee</text>
  <text start="2349.13" dur="6.94">and these they&amp;#39;re these people have some</text>
  <text start="2354.18" dur="4.38">explaining to do the executives need to</text>
  <text start="2356.07" dur="5.4">be held responsible for their election</text>

  <text start="2361.47" dur="5.07">this to the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="2362.73" dur="7.17">Antitrust Division is that the law</text>

  <text start="2858.38" dur="5.04">is that people on the ground</text>
  <text start="2860.57" dur="5.37">approve of these of this horrible</text>
  <text start="2863.42" dur="5.28">behavior now in in in numbers that we</text>
  <text start="2865.94" dur="5.04">cannot ignore the culture that you have</text>
  <text start="2868.7" dur="4.26">described over there at Google is the</text>
  <text start="2870.98" dur="4.5">culture that is created and perpetuated</text>
  <text start="2872.96" dur="5.49">on college campuses that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2875.48" dur="5.67">largely on on social media and elsewhere</text>

  <text start="2883.46" dur="4.71">the the overall culture that I think is</text>
  <text start="2885.95" dur="8.61">allowing this to go on with such</text>
  <text start="2888.17" dur="8.58">impunity you know there&amp;#39;s a big change</text>
  <text start="2894.56" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s happening right now I think we</text>
  <text start="2896.75" dur="7.68">all see it there is you know whenever</text>
  <text start="2901.28" dur="4.65">you look at communist revolutions you</text>
  <text start="2904.43" dur="5.07">see the same pattern of political</text>
  <text start="2905.93" dur="5.49">correctness and what one has to realize</text>
  <text start="2909.5" dur="3.39">is that this isn&amp;#39;t just something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2911.42" dur="4.47">organic this is something that is</text>
  <text start="2912.89" dur="5.43">planned with an agenda and it&amp;#39;s clear to</text>
  <text start="2915.89" dur="5.16">me that that agenda has been broken at</text>
  <text start="2918.32" dur="6.57">the highest level and that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="2921.05" dur="6.18">towards a new world globalism is is</text>
  <text start="2924.89" dur="4.2">fracturing and what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="2927.23" dur="6.27">that we&amp;#39;re going to instead have a</text>
  <text start="2929.09" dur="6.269">multipolar regional world and as a</text>
  <text start="2933.5" dur="3.75">result the people that were in control</text>

  <text start="2955.07" dur="5.76">happened is that there&amp;#39;s been that</text>
  <text start="2959.06" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a new sheriff in town and that</text>

  <text start="3128.04" dur="3.36">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re more amenable to saying</text>
  <text start="3129.9" dur="3.96">you know what yeah you know I&amp;#39;m feeling</text>
  <text start="3131.4" dur="6.15">you know maybe it&amp;#39;s possible that but</text>
  <text start="3133.86" dur="6.18">you I am of the just in terms of what I</text>
  <text start="3137.55" dur="6.18">feel and how I gauge what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="3140.04" dur="5.82">what I see am I in your camp um as well</text>
  <text start="3143.73" dur="4.44">with the positive changes that are</text>
  <text start="3145.86" dur="4.11">happening um listen let&amp;#39;s talk about a</text>
  <text start="3148.17" dur="6.57">couple things real quick before we wrap</text>
  <text start="3149.97" dur="6.9">what&amp;#39;s next for you um according to the</text>
  <text start="3154.74" dur="5.69">whistleblower networks I need to stay in</text>
  <text start="3156.87" dur="5.91">the spotlight for my safety</text>
  <text start="3160.43" dur="6.67">whistleblowers tend to die under</text>
  <text start="3162.78" dur="9.84">mysterious circumstances and so my goal</text>
  <text start="3167.1" dur="8.73">is to stay in in the light and to talk</text>
  <text start="3172.62" dur="5.46">about what Google has done and you know</text>
  <text start="3175.83" dur="4.23">because the important thing is that we</text>
  <text start="3178.08" dur="3.78">leave a world for our collective</text>
  <text start="3180.06" dur="3.78">children and give them the same</text>
  <text start="3181.86" dur="4.56">opportunities that were passed to us and</text>
  <text start="3183.84" dur="5.22">if we don&amp;#39;t fight for that then we</text>
  <text start="3186.42" dur="5.34">deserve to lose it and I believe that</text>
  <text start="3189.06" dur="6.72">America deserves to have as much freedom</text>
  <text start="3191.76" dur="5.91">and sovereignty as possible and so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3195.78" dur="4.62">going to continue that mission and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3197.67" dur="5.25">going to continue that outreach and</text>
  <text start="3200.4" dur="6.629">and it&amp;#39;s really resonating with America</text>
  <text start="3202.92" dur="6.119">and and that&amp;#39;s a great thing and I think</text>
  <text start="3207.029" dur="4.861">that we&amp;#39;ve got a really bright future</text>
  <text start="3209.039" dur="4.8">ahead of us that&amp;#39;s fantastic well listen</text>
  <text start="3211.89" dur="4.74">hey Frank you got a last question before</text>
  <text start="3213.839" dur="4.351">we go no I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m happy that people like</text>
  <text start="3216.63" dur="4.349">Zack are out there because I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="3218.19" dur="6.359">in in in this new war and this new</text>
  <text start="3220.979" dur="6.84">Renaissance because I always I said I</text>
  <text start="3224.549" dur="7.02">want if I can do anything and say that</text>
  <text start="3227.819" dur="6.03">in 20 in the 2050s 20 60s when we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="3231.569" dur="5.79">retiring and getting ready to transition</text>
  <text start="3233.849" dur="5.94">into into the next life I hope that we</text>
  <text start="3237.359" dur="5.76">can all look back and say I was I was a</text>
  <text start="3239.789" dur="6.54">at least a part of what was a new</text>
  <text start="3243.119" dur="5.1">Renaissance a new enlightenment in some</text>
  <text start="3246.329" dur="4.41">in some way and I and I believe that</text>
  <text start="3248.219" dur="6.691">everybody&amp;#39;s doing their part and people</text>
  <text start="3250.739" dur="5.61">like Zack are very very very important</text>
  <text start="3254.91" dur="3.3">right now especially just on the</text>
  <text start="3256.349" dur="3.601">engineering the technical the technology</text>
  <text start="3258.21" dur="4.17">and people who are actually able to give</text>
  <text start="3259.95" dur="4.74">us the explanations for everything that</text>
  <text start="3262.38" dur="7.02">maybe people like you and I Tracy aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3264.69" dur="6.299">as equipped to explaining but we can</text>
  <text start="3269.4" dur="2.099">still feel on our guts that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3270.989" dur="4.201">not right</text>
  <text start="3271.499" dur="7.29">like for example Zack leading up to 2016</text>
  <text start="3275.19" dur="6.24">nobody can tell me that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="3278.789" dur="5.25">and the Democrat Party had momentum or</text>
  <text start="3281.43" dur="5.73">enthusiasm on their side but on the</text>
  <text start="3284.039" dur="6.361">other hand because of their control in</text>
  <text start="3287.16" dur="5.669">media and control and social media and</text>
  <text start="3290.4" dur="4.379">and within their own party and and the</text>
  <text start="3292.829" dur="4.23">electoral process for the Democratic</text>
  <text start="3294.779" dur="5.49">primaries they were able to pull one</text>
  <text start="3297.059" dur="5.04">over people&amp;#39;s eyes and after they stole</text>
  <text start="3300.269" dur="3.931">the primaries they told the rest of the</text>
  <text start="3302.099" dur="3.66">country it was a 98 percent chance that</text>
  <text start="3304.2" dur="4.23">hillary was gonna win the general and</text>
  <text start="3305.759" dur="4.98">then of course came the big slap in the</text>
  <text start="3308.43" dur="5.099">face and after that i think that was</text>
  <text start="3310.739" dur="4.5">really that that that watershed moment</text>
  <text start="3313.529" dur="3.51">where we were able to start it was</text>
  <text start="3315.239" dur="4.35">almost like clipping the end of a cigar</text>
  <text start="3317.039" dur="4.141">in a very bad way and then all of a</text>
  <text start="3319.589" dur="4.2">sudden the cigar starts flaking apart</text>
  <text start="3321.18" dur="4.589">and you start realizing what the cigar</text>
  <text start="3323.789" dur="6.03">was the entire time it was a cheap piece</text>
  <text start="3325.769" dur="7.691">of shit and and i&amp;#39;ll tell you what you</text>
  <text start="3329.819" dur="6.071">have provided is a better run</text>
  <text start="3333.46" dur="4.649">standing of what people like Tracy</text>
  <text start="3335.89" dur="4.89">myself and a lot of people who listen</text>
  <text start="3338.109" dur="4.141">only could ever have gone off of a</text>
  <text start="3340.78" dur="3.569">feeling in our guts to say that</text>
  <text start="3342.25" dur="4.02">something wasn&amp;#39;t right thank you for</text>
  <text start="3344.349" dur="4.981">that thanks for having the courage to</text>
