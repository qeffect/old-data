  <text start="94.439" dur="6.011">have so much evidence and I&amp;#39;ve just been</text>
  <text start="99.13" dur="3.599">letting people figure it out on their</text>
  <text start="100.45" dur="4.04">own but I guess since you asked I should</text>
  <text start="102.729" dur="4.081">show everybody what do you guys think</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="6.369">Jay show everyone the evidence of why</text>
  <text start="106.81" dur="5.43">why we reacted so strongly on the data</text>
  <text start="110.859" dur="5.55">that they drop should I show everybody</text>
  <text start="112.24" dur="5.549">the evidence hard evidence does</text>
  <text start="116.409" dur="5.911">everybody want to see it do you guys</text>
  <text start="117.789" dur="7.951">want real evidence of why George Webb is</text>
  <text start="122.32" dur="4.859">is that Jason Goodman I mean I really</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="2.82">honestly believe that Jason is a good</text>
  <text start="127.179" dur="2.881">guy who&amp;#39;s just sucked into this</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="4.04">craziness and doesn&amp;#39;t realize what the</text>
  <text start="130.06" dur="2.54">hell&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="9.16">the only video I made the only video I</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="6.419">made where I mentioned these folks was</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="6.8">the one where I showed the the data that</text>
  <text start="147.459" dur="5.671">they said was DMZ van seth rich files</text>
  <text start="150.39" dur="4.3">that they wanted crowd-sourced and the</text>
  <text start="153.13" dur="4.5">only reason why I did that is because I</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="7.35">had reached out personally the day that</text>
  <text start="157.63" dur="6.78">they dropped it the day after to tell</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="3.63">them that this is not new information</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="3.15">that you know I know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="5.399">acknowledged that now that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="6.12">matter anymore right but I wanted to</text>
  <text start="171.069" dur="4.411">show them this was new info was it new</text>
  <text start="173.68" dur="4.139">info and I wanted to show them why it</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="4.8">was a problem and I stress again and</text>
  <text start="177.819" dur="3.811">again and again that the reason why it</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="6.3">was a problem is because it validates</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="7.32">gusoff or two and gusoff or two is the</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="4.86">key to the DNC Russia hacked the</text>
  <text start="188.95" dur="3.03">election strategy and that&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="2.519">for me</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="4.02">so I wanted to show them why if they</text>
  <text start="193.959" dur="4.861">validate the data they validate gusoff</text>
  <text start="196" dur="4.38">or to being a real thing so I did that</text>
  <text start="198.82" dur="4.71">in a number of different ways</text>
  <text start="200.38" dur="8.49">I spoke with I never said any of this</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="7.65">stuff because I don&amp;#39;t really care about</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="4.11">getting viewers through them I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="211.18" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t you guys are here because you like</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="5.729">what I do I don&amp;#39;t need him to boost my</text>
