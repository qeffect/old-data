  <text start="378.469" dur="3.06">think there&amp;#39;s a good chance that he</text>

  <text start="383.419" dur="3.03">recommended him what the ties were back</text>

  <text start="397.099" dur="5.071">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s WikiLeaks related</text>
  <text start="399.68" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re using that maybe to kind of</text>
  <text start="402.17" dur="3.87">shield things or maybe they are looking</text>

  <text start="406.04" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m telling you is that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s nothing you know on the on the</text>
  <text start="410.57" dur="2.85">stone front we don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="3.45">information yet for me to make any</text>
  <text start="413.42" dur="4.31">decision on it I&amp;#39;m just telling you what</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="4.83">I know from like what research I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="417.73" dur="3.94">I&amp;#39;ve been screaming about that since I</text>
  <text start="420.2" dur="8.13">started digging into metaphor a long</text>
  <text start="421.67" dur="12.18">time ago why is Muller using Oleg</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="8.15">Deripaska is he really investigating</text>
  <text start="433.85" dur="6.51">Trump Russia like Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="444.53" dur="5.37">cross investigations going on another</text>
  <text start="447.29" dur="4.59">thing they let us know is that the</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="3.51">Ukraine indictment had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="6.09">with Trump at all they make it very</text>
  <text start="453.41" dur="7.11">clear in here that those matters that he</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="5.25">was indicted on don&amp;#39;t have anything to</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="4.95">do with the Trump campaign and we know</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="4.2">that because they say as discussed above</text>
  <text start="465.47" dur="3.96">a matter can arise directly from an</text>
  <text start="467.42" dur="4.02">investigation when the original</text>
  <text start="469.43" dur="4.2">investigation leads naturally to the</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="4.68">discover discovery of factually related</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="3.84">conduct that should be explored to</text>
  <text start="476.12" dur="4.8">develop a full picture of the</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="6.24">individuals activities now the letter</text>
  <text start="480.92" dur="9.18">from Rosenstein is telling to me because</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="9.18">he knew back in August of 2017 about the</text>

  <text start="497.93" dur="6.33">right around the time Matt affort was</text>
  <text start="499.82" dur="8.58">indicted and what&amp;#39;s going on with gates</text>
