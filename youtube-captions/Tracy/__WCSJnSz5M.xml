  <text start="628.17" dur="7.72">me there may be scant evidence for this</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="6.57">theory says the New York Times all</text>
  <text start="635.89" dur="5.31">through September 2016 through December</text>
  <text start="638.5" dur="5.22">of 2017 when that New York Time article</text>
  <text start="641.2" dur="5.16">appeared Paige told the same story I was</text>
  <text start="643.72" dur="4.38">set up as a patsy by the FBI so they</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="3.84">could spy on Trump&amp;#39;s campaign on behalf</text>
  <text start="648.1" dur="3.51">of the Clinton campaign when he first</text>
  <text start="650.2" dur="3.09">started saying that he was branded a</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="2.19">lunatic babbling anything to save</text>
  <text start="653.29" dur="3.21">himself</text>
  <text start="653.8" dur="4.29">since hey the FBI caught him sure this</text>
  <text start="656.5" dur="5.73">Russian spy will say anything to make</text>
  <text start="658.09" dur="6.15">himself look good by December 2017 when</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="4.65">that article appeared the babbling did</text>
  <text start="664.24" dur="4.17">it look so lunatic after all did it the</text>
  <text start="666.88" dur="3.51">public was told about the Hillary</text>
  <text start="668.41" dur="4.32">campaign DNC funding of the dossier in</text>
  <text start="670.39" dur="5.55">October then around December 12th</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="5.01">horowitz investigation surfaced it&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="675.94" dur="3.78">clearer than ever that Carter page had</text>
  <text start="677.74" dur="4.41">it right he was trying to alert people</text>
  <text start="679.72" dur="4.44">as early as September 2016 to what was</text>
  <text start="682.15" dur="4.78">really going on but it&amp;#39;s taken more than</text>
  <text start="684.16" dur="5.08">a year for the evidence to surface</text>
  <text start="686.93" dur="5.46">back him up of course a lot of what he</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="5.55">had done from 2013 to 2016 as an</text>
  <text start="692.39" dur="3.15">undercover FBI employee is likely still</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="3.15">classified</text>
  <text start="695.54" dur="4.29">so one handicap page has always had in</text>
  <text start="697.94" dur="3.51">trying to tell a story is the fact that</text>
  <text start="699.83" dur="4.59">he can&amp;#39;t talk much about his undercover</text>
  <text start="701.45" dur="4.62">work then he also faced the handicap of</text>
  <text start="704.42" dur="3.87">the Democrats and the DNC media</text>
  <text start="706.07" dur="4.29">constantly framing his story as some</text>
  <text start="708.29" dur="4.14">dilettante attention whore who loves</text>
  <text start="710.36" dur="3.84">Russia very much and was recruited to be</text>
  <text start="712.43" dur="4.98">a spy by Russia just a few years ago</text>

  <text start="724.16" dur="5.22">actually is an undercover FBI employee</text>
  <text start="726.529" dur="5.911">who spent two years posing as something</text>
  <text start="729.38" dur="5.31">he wasn&amp;#39;t to help the FBI take out a</text>
  <text start="732.44" dur="6.39">Russian spy ring he was their key</text>
  <text start="734.69" dur="6.45">witness so he basically worked for two</text>
  <text start="738.83" dur="4.62">years bore the FBI helping them to take</text>
  <text start="741.14" dur="3.87">down a Russian spy ring and now the FBI</text>
  <text start="743.45" dur="5.1">is trying to claim that he&amp;#39;s a Russian</text>
  <text start="745.01" dur="6">spy all the news reports you&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="748.55" dur="4.53">since September of 2016 casting page as</text>
  <text start="751.01" dur="4.23">some idiot hapless businessmen who</text>
  <text start="753.08" dur="4.199">Russians tried to recruit as a spy but</text>
  <text start="755.24" dur="3.99">thank God the FBI caught the Russians</text>
  <text start="757.279" dur="5.211">first before page could say yes and</text>
  <text start="759.23" dur="6.54">start spying for them they&amp;#39;re not true</text>
  <text start="762.49" dur="6.88">Paige was an undercover FBI employee for</text>
  <text start="765.77" dur="6.09">two years was strung along Oh Paige was</text>
  <text start="769.37" dur="5.58">an undercover FBI employee for who for</text>
  <text start="771.86" dur="5.61">two years strung along a trio of Russian</text>
  <text start="774.95" dur="5.639">SVR agents until enough evidence had</text>
  <text start="777.47" dur="4.98">been amassed to prosecute FBI DOJ</text>
  <text start="780.589" dur="3.811">officials then callously turned on him</text>
  <text start="782.45" dur="5.04">and claimed he was a Russian spy to the</text>
  <text start="784.4" dur="5.34">FISA Court if we are just figuring this</text>
  <text start="787.49" dur="4.65">out now you can bet Trump sessions</text>
  <text start="789.74" dur="5.25">Horowitz Rosenstein Muller and all the</text>
  <text start="792.14" dur="5.1">people involved knew it long ago this</text>
  <text start="794.99" dur="4.05">being rolled out now because the IG</text>
  <text start="797.24" dur="3.539">investigation is done and the report is</text>
  <text start="799.04" dur="3.72">being written and much of the evidence</text>
  <text start="800.779" dur="3.87">has been released to Congress this is</text>
  <text start="802.76" dur="5.25">just another radical plot twist in this</text>
  <text start="804.649" dur="6.451">story of unbelievable corruption inside</text>
  <text start="808.01" dur="4.639">of the FBI and the DOJ right after the</text>
  <text start="811.1" dur="3.6">release of the memo we learned the FBI</text>
  <text start="812.649" dur="4.301">knew all along</text>
  <text start="814.7" dur="5.73">Carter Paige was not any kind of a</text>
  <text start="816.95" dur="4.17">foreign agent for Russia the entire FISA</text>
  <text start="820.43" dur="2.849">warrant was</text>
  <text start="821.12" dur="4.29">based on a huge lie and the people who</text>
  <text start="823.279" dur="4.861">took it to the FISA Court knew it was a</text>
  <text start="825.41" dur="5.16">huge lie so if you&amp;#39;re keeping score</text>
  <text start="828.14" dur="3.96">the FBI proffered no credible that</text>
  <text start="830.57" dur="5.34">verified evidence to the court that</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="5.61">Carter page was a foreign agent and the</text>
  <text start="835.91" dur="3.81">FBI knew Carter page was their own</text>
  <text start="837.71" dur="4.379">undercover employee who just helped them</text>
  <text start="839.72" dur="4.14">take out a Russian spy ring so the FBI</text>
  <text start="842.089" dur="3.301">knew the guy they were offering to the</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="3.75">FISA Court as a foreign agent</text>
  <text start="845.39" dur="3.57">was it really a foreign agent and they</text>
  <text start="847.61" dur="5.419">knew all the evidence they were showing</text>
  <text start="848.96" dur="8.16">to the court to prove this was bogus so</text>
  <text start="853.029" dur="6.791">when I read this is all factually</text>
  <text start="857.12" dur="4.53">accurate everything in here is true this</text>
