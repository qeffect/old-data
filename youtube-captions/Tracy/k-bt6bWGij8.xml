  <text start="347.59" dur="7.05">head around that that thing Nick was</text>
  <text start="353.23" dur="5.43">talking about the other day that Planned</text>
  <text start="354.64" dur="6.84">Parenthood won&amp;#39;t donate to us oh I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="358.66" dur="3.93">understand why I don&amp;#39;t give up I think</text>
  <text start="361.48" dur="2.91">it&amp;#39;s the same with like Obama not</text>
  <text start="362.59" dur="5.52">endorsing any red state Democrats it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="6.12">so like it&amp;#39;s so that the Democrat isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.11" dur="5.61">coming off as to like leftist</text>
  <text start="370.51" dur="5.9">establishment so basically basically</text>
  <text start="373.72" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re just gonna lie to everybody and</text>
  <text start="376.41" dur="3.46">pretend that we&amp;#39;re something we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="378.28" dur="3.21">because we can&amp;#39;t get elected if we</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="4.62">actually act like what we are is</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="4.65">basically the is basically the mantra</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="3.36">here and we&amp;#39;ve seen this over and over</text>
  <text start="386.14" dur="3.45">and over again and I did that big threat</text>
  <text start="387.85" dur="3.42">about it and it&amp;#39;s just clear</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="3.54">that this is there means this is how</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="3.57">their this is what they&amp;#39;re doing this is</text>
  <text start="393.13" dur="3.75">what they&amp;#39;re doing to try and get around</text>
  <text start="394.84" dur="3.81">the fact that they are so far out of the</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="3.57">mainstream that if anybody knew what</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="4.55">they really stood for they wouldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="400.45" dur="7.8">elected and I think that&amp;#39;s really sad</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="7.33">but in this vein I decided that I would</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="4.44">start doing some investigative work of</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="4.59">my own and so yesterday I wrote this</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="5.13">thread and I look to see what first of</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="4.44">all what is Emily&amp;#39;s list and of course I</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="3.45">found that Emily&amp;#39;s list is an American</text>
  <text start="419.56" dur="3.39">political action committee that aims to</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="3.84">help pro-choice Democratic female</text>
  <text start="422.95" dur="5.28">candidates to office it was founded by</text>
  <text start="425.11" dur="4.2">Ellen Malcolm in 1985 according to the</text>
  <text start="428.23" dur="2.88">Washington Examiner</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="4.38">Emily&amp;#39;s list is the nation&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="4.77">influential pro-choice political action</text>
  <text start="433.69" dur="7.04">committee I went to the FEC to check</text>
  <text start="435.88" dur="4.85">them out here&amp;#39;s what I found</text>
  <text start="442.17" dur="5.41">here&amp;#39;s Emily&amp;#39;s list on the FEC website</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="4.68">and anybody can do this and I looked and</text>
  <text start="447.58" dur="4.29">I searched and I found that not only is</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="5.31">Claire McCaskill a recipient of funds</text>
  <text start="451.87" dur="5.6">from the pack she&amp;#39;s also giving to them</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="6.06">she&amp;#39;s donating them money as well</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="5.74">contribute a name McCaskill for Missouri</text>
  <text start="460.96" dur="3.63">is on the bottom donating ten thousand</text>
  <text start="463.21" dur="3.87">nine hundred seventy six dollars and</text>
  <text start="464.59" dur="4.35">ninety three cents cinema is on here</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s a bunch of different candidates</text>
  <text start="468.94" dur="4.2">on here that are giving act blue is</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="4.14">giving thirty five thousand six hundred</text>
  <text start="473.14" dur="3.87">dollars and then another twenty seven</text>
  <text start="475.54" dur="3.33">thousand dollars so this is like a</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="4.29">funnel and this is the way it works</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="4.8">super PACs are a funnel for all the you</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="3.6">know than the dollars and from other</text>
  <text start="483.67" dur="3.9">places and then that organization</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="5.28">donates to a campaign nobody knows what</text>
  <text start="487.57" dur="6.99">Emily&amp;#39;s list is nobody looks it up but</text>
  <text start="490.18" dur="6">it turns out Emily&amp;#39;s list is absolutely</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="3.48">one of the top contributors to Claire</text>
  <text start="496.18" dur="3.54">McCaskill&amp;#39;s campaign at six hundred</text>
  <text start="498.04" dur="3.03">thirty thousand dogs six hundred thirty</text>
  <text start="499.72" dur="2.75">thousand seven hundred and forty five</text>
  <text start="501.07" dur="3.93">dollars</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="4.75">women&amp;#39;s issues two million six hundred</text>
  <text start="505" dur="3.57">sixty three dollars and sixty two I keep</text>
  <text start="507.22" dur="2.97">reading that wrong two million six</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="6.03">hundred thirty three sixty two dollars</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="6.05">and she spent twenty six million of her</text>
  <text start="514.6" dur="5.61">money or twenty seven million almost</text>
  <text start="516.24" dur="5.53">that&amp;#39;s through 2002 through 2013 through</text>
  <text start="520.21" dur="5.01">2018</text>
  <text start="521.77" dur="6.45">so I got a little bit sick to my belly</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="5.73">when I started looking through the FEC</text>
  <text start="528.22" dur="5.07">filings and I stopped but I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="3.57">you if you take a look at through here</text>
  <text start="533.29" dur="4.41">and you all you have to do is go to the</text>
  <text start="534.52" dur="6.06">FEC website throw in her name and take a</text>
  <text start="537.7" dur="3.329">look at what she&amp;#39;s doing it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="540.58" dur="4.5">else</text>
  <text start="541.029" dur="5.221">it really is that&amp;#39;s the McCaskill</text>
  <text start="545.08" dur="2.879">scoring story</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="3.45">oh and now she&amp;#39;s come out today and</text>
  <text start="547.959" dur="5.281">basically tried to ask for an</text>
  <text start="549.7" dur="5.37">investigation into Project Veritas and</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="3.599">how they got into her office saying</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="4.709">basically it&amp;#39;s like having a competitor</text>
  <text start="556.839" dur="5.301">come in and steal your secrets and I</text>
  <text start="559.779" dur="5.041">want to know why it is that McCaskill&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="5.139">staff wasn&amp;#39;t able to successfully vet</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="6.18">their volunteers because that to me is</text>
  <text start="567.279" dur="6.68">more what the problem is is that they</text>
  <text start="571" dur="5.7">didn&amp;#39;t vet or they did vet and</text>
  <text start="573.959" dur="4.57">undercover journalist for Project</text>
  <text start="576.7" dur="5.13">Veritas or the bomb which is probably</text>
  <text start="578.529" dur="11.81">more likely they don&amp;#39;t go away</text>
  <text start="581.83" dur="11.22">they don&amp;#39;t go away okay next ah yes</text>
  <text start="590.339" dur="8.381">Think Progress came out with a video or</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="7.349">an article yesterday pro-trump walk away</text>
  <text start="598.72" dur="6.09">March has all the signs of a grifting</text>

  <text start="615.91" dur="5.28">wasn&amp;#39;t amplified by Russian BOTS but</text>
  <text start="618.19" dur="4.74">represents real people between the poor</text>
  <text start="621.19" dur="3.69">organizing and the clear attempts to</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="3.659">turn the rally into a grifting operation</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="6.8">the March is shaping up to be another</text>
  <text start="626.589" dur="5.091">thing entitle entirely a resounding flop</text>
  <text start="633.209" dur="9.521">amazing let me just say there is no</text>
  <text start="637.24" dur="8.01">grifting going on and I can probably</text>
  <text start="642.73" dur="5.22">speak very clearly to the fact that</text>
  <text start="645.25" dur="5.76">there has been no poor organization it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="4.35">been organized quite well and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="651.01" dur="2.37">complete lie there&amp;#39;s a lot of other</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="2.719">things in this article that are a</text>
  <text start="653.38" dur="6.149">complete lie also</text>
  <text start="655.019" dur="7.24">so sarah palin tweeted us which was</text>
  <text start="659.529" dur="4.471">great and then they say basically like a</text>

  <text start="942.529" dur="5.191">past polls now because we have numbers</text>
  <text start="944.449" dur="5.82">actual numbers a poll is a sample of</text>
  <text start="947.72" dur="4.35">opinions that costs nothing to give for</text>
  <text start="950.269" dur="4.021">example before a horse race you can pull</text>
  <text start="952.07" dur="4.019">everyone including jockeys owners</text>
  <text start="954.29" dur="3.989">betters whomever but it&amp;#39;s just an</text>
  <text start="956.089" dur="3.69">opinion moreover you have to know that</text>
  <text start="958.279" dur="4.711">in a political poll you have correct the</text>
  <text start="959.779" dur="5.761">correct sample most don&amp;#39;t the sample</text>
  <text start="962.99" dur="4.44">anymore is impossible the simple anymore</text>
  <text start="965.54" dur="3.84">is impossible to get and certainly you</text>

  <text start="969.38" dur="4.319">get it by self reporting so far only</text>
  <text start="971.63" dur="3.569">Peabody news and traffic are have a</text>
  <text start="973.699" dur="3.33">track record of really getting likely</text>
  <text start="975.199" dur="7.32">voters in the proper sample sizes</text>
  <text start="977.029" dur="10.31">I don&amp;#39;t do polls I examine ballot</text>
  <text start="982.519" dur="7.44">requests and ballot returns by party in</text>
  <text start="987.339" dur="4.451">2016 party ID was the single best</text>
  <text start="989.959" dur="4.591">predictor of a vote according to Pew</text>
  <text start="991.79" dur="5.43">very very few party switchers but those</text>
  <text start="994.55" dur="4.71">that were by two-to-one went from dem to</text>
  <text start="997.22" dur="3.809">Republican but then you need to compare</text>
  <text start="999.26" dur="3.9">the current numbers to something the</text>
  <text start="1001.029" dur="3.81">rule of thumb is that you never compare</text>
  <text start="1003.16" dur="2.91">a midterm with the presidential election</text>
  <text start="1004.839" dur="3.211">because the turnout for the latter is</text>
  <text start="1006.07" dur="4.74">supposed to be so much higher guess what</text>
  <text start="1008.05" dur="5.13">I did I compared it anyway just out of</text>
  <text start="1010.81" dur="4.11">intuition so in four sample states where</text>
  <text start="1013.18" dur="4.62">we are already seeing a large number of</text>
  <text start="1014.92" dur="5.37">ballot requests Arizona Florida Ohio and</text>
  <text start="1017.8" dur="6.09">Iowa and which all have very different</text>
  <text start="1020.29" dur="5.22">voting patterns I found that so far the</text>
  <text start="1023.89" dur="5.159">Republicans are exceeding their numbers</text>
  <text start="1025.51" dur="5.789">from 2016 a presidential election not</text>
  <text start="1029.049" dur="4.231">supposed to happen in other words not</text>
  <text start="1031.299" dur="3.361">more Republicans are not supposed to</text>
  <text start="1033.28" dur="3">come out and vote than they did in the</text>
  <text start="1034.66" dur="4.07">presidential election during a midterm</text>
  <text start="1036.28" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s been spoken about ad nauseam right</text>
  <text start="1038.73" dur="4.209">moreover with the help of free purse</text>
  <text start="1040.99" dur="2.699">ravi and speedy in Texas and Ohio and</text>
  <text start="1042.939" dur="2.911">the Aikau</text>
  <text start="1043.689" dur="4.35">than others I found that the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1045.85" dur="4.47">are falling behind their 2016</text>
  <text start="1048.039" dur="4.561">performance one would not be surprised</text>
  <text start="1050.32" dur="4.229">that the Dems are lagging behind 2016 a</text>
  <text start="1052.6" dur="4.049">presidential election year but it is</text>
  <text start="1054.549" dur="4.97">surprising that ours are not only</text>
  <text start="1056.649" dur="5.671">running ahead of 2014 a midterm but also</text>
  <text start="1059.519" dur="5.351">2016 just in case there was some weird</text>
  <text start="1062.32" dur="4.469">statewide tilt to these numbers we also</text>
  <text start="1064.87" dur="5.34">looked at four key Florida counties</text>
  <text start="1066.789" dur="6.75">Hillsboro miami-dade Lea and Broward and</text>
  <text start="1070.21" dur="6.689">in all four counties even the blue ones</text>
  <text start="1073.539" dur="6">Dee&amp;#39;s are underperforming 2016 and ours</text>
  <text start="1076.899" dur="5.551">are over performing the same is true in</text>
  <text start="1079.539" dur="5.85">Iowa EPS absentee s&amp;#39; Dee&amp;#39;s always lead</text>
  <text start="1082.45" dur="5.189">in total absence he&amp;#39;s in Iowa but again</text>
  <text start="1085.389" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re behind the 2016 election and in</text>
  <text start="1087.639" dur="6.451">2016 the DS had fallen behind their 2012</text>
  <text start="1090.19" dur="6.63">numbers in Iowa but the Republicans are</text>
  <text start="1094.09" dur="3.959">up from 2016 so we looked at a key</text>
  <text start="1096.82" dur="3.39">district no one is watching</text>

  <text start="1261.35" dur="4.02">what do you think the single biggest</text>
  <text start="1262.97" dur="4.8">issue motivating the people in the last</text>
  <text start="1265.37" dur="4.74">three weeks was if you said justice</text>

  <text start="1272.51" dur="5.04">was the most motivating voter event of</text>
  <text start="1274.7" dur="5.61">the last ten years so let me ask you</text>
  <text start="1277.55" dur="4.68">this if 5,000 more Iowans in a single</text>
  <text start="1280.31" dur="3.9">district requested absentee ballots at</text>

  <text start="1284.21" dur="3.72">who do you think what do you think</text>
  <text start="1285.98" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;d be voting on and let me put it</text>
  <text start="1287.93" dur="5.25">this way if 50,000 a Florida ballots had</text>
  <text start="1291.29" dur="3.66">already been returned what was the</text>
  <text start="1293.18" dur="3.78">biggest issue when those people were in</text>
  <text start="1294.95" dur="3.54">the middle of voting and since we know</text>
  <text start="1296.96" dur="3.57">that Republicans have about a 7 percent</text>
  <text start="1298.49" dur="3.75">lead in those returned ballots would it</text>
  <text start="1300.53" dur="4.29">not be safe to assume that they were all</text>
  <text start="1302.24" dur="3.99">voting on issues related to just sky I</text>
  <text start="1304.82" dur="3.33">think so</text>
  <text start="1306.23" dur="4.32">those are touchdowns already scored</text>
  <text start="1308.15" dur="3.13">can&amp;#39;t take them off the board so in all</text>
  <text start="1310.55" dur="2.44">those areas</text>
  <text start="1311.28" dur="3.24">mentioned the DS have less time in a</text>
  <text start="1312.99" dur="4.77">much smaller voter pool from which to</text>
  <text start="1314.52" dur="5.22">now recover that 7% lead or those 5,000</text>
  <text start="1317.76" dur="5.28">votes see how that works</text>
  <text start="1319.74" dur="5.34">finally my assumption could be wrong is</text>
  <text start="1323.04" dur="4.38">that a river carries all boats the same</text>
  <text start="1325.08" dur="4.26">way I&amp;#39;ve asked a historical genius on</text>

  <text start="1336.09" dur="7.17">none therefore when I see data not polls</text>
  <text start="1340.05" dur="4.95">but ballots all going the same way then</text>
  <text start="1343.26" dur="4.02">I don&amp;#39;t care what the polls are experts</text>
  <text start="1345" dur="4.65">say the voters are saying something</text>
  <text start="1347.28" dur="3.96">different and this was exactly how I</text>

  <text start="1498.809" dur="5.921">basically what happened was there was an</text>
  <text start="1502.299" dur="6.921">indictment brought down on this woman</text>
  <text start="1504.73" dur="6.93">who worked for fintan Vinson is a</text>

  <text start="1513.82" dur="5.46">bank and they deposit ten thousand</text>
  <text start="1515.65" dur="5.73">dollars or more the bank will flag that</text>
  <text start="1519.28" dur="4.26">as a suspicious transaction depending on</text>
  <text start="1521.38" dur="4.47">the user&amp;#39;s account history and what</text>
  <text start="1523.54" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve done in the past so they&amp;#39;ll flag</text>
  <text start="1525.85" dur="3.69">it as sort of like a suspicious</text>
  <text start="1527.62" dur="3.36">transaction like if this was basically</text>
  <text start="1529.54" dur="2.97">implemented to take a look at terrorism</text>
  <text start="1530.98" dur="3.87">and things like that so that people</text>
  <text start="1532.51" dur="4.289">couldn&amp;#39;t come and deposit wads of cash</text>

  <text start="1540.73" dur="4.17">dollars is flagged for a later review</text>
  <text start="1542.98" dur="4.41">there was an employee that worked with</text>
  <text start="1544.9" dur="4.019">FinCEN and if you recall there were a</text>

  <text start="1611.049" dur="3.721">status type stuff</text>
  <text start="1613.12" dur="5.16">it goes through in this indictment all</text>
  <text start="1614.77" dur="5.46">of the important things about the case</text>
  <text start="1618.28" dur="3.389">obviously and and it gives us enough</text>
  <text start="1620.23" dur="2.91">information that we can pull up the</text>
  <text start="1621.669" dur="2.851">articles and that&amp;#39;s why some people were</text>
  <text start="1623.14" dur="3.51">able to take the titles of these</text>
  <text start="1624.52" dur="3.6">articles and do a reverse search and</text>
  <text start="1626.65" dur="4.23">find out that Jason Leopold from</text>
  <text start="1628.12" dur="3.8">BuzzFeed wrote the articles what else is</text>
  <text start="1630.88" dur="2.75">interesting is that</text>
  <text start="1631.92" dur="4.44">all of the things that were leaked to</text>
  <text start="1633.63" dur="4.59">them had to do with the special counsels</text>
  <text start="1636.36" dur="3.78">office I&amp;#39;m gonna go through a thread</text>
  <text start="1638.22" dur="4.29">that Rex did a second ago when I add it</text>
  <text start="1640.14" dur="4.47">to to talk to you guys about what that</text>
  <text start="1642.51" dur="4.56">looks like but before you do that I want</text>
  <text start="1644.61" dur="7.47">everybody to remember about BuzzFeed</text>
  <text start="1647.07" dur="8.52">about BuzzFeed BuzzFeed has been</text>
  <text start="1652.08" dur="5.79">instrumental in several different sort</text>
  <text start="1655.59" dur="5.4">of reports in quotes over the past</text>
  <text start="1657.87" dur="5.58">several months and years they were the</text>
  <text start="1660.99" dur="3.93">ones who leaked the dossier they were</text>
  <text start="1663.45" dur="4.41">the ones who were being sued they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1664.92" dur="4.83">ones who sued the DNC they&amp;#39;ve been kind</text>
  <text start="1667.86" dur="3.99">of central in this whole Spygate story</text>
  <text start="1669.75" dur="4.92">so it&amp;#39;s interesting to me how this all</text>
  <text start="1671.85" dur="12.9">ended up happening and how BuzzFeed is</text>
  <text start="1674.67" dur="12.48">involved here we go three questions Rex</text>
  <text start="1684.75" dur="4.38">wants answered did Muller special</text>
  <text start="1687.15" dur="3.93">counsel use fin sensors evidence to</text>

  <text start="1691.08" dur="5.91">they obtain it if it wasn&amp;#39;t done legally</text>
  <text start="1693.15" dur="5.76">how was it obtained SARS our continued</text>
  <text start="1696.99" dur="3.84">considered to be extremely confidential</text>
  <text start="1698.91" dur="4.16">the only way Muller special counsel</text>
  <text start="1700.83" dur="5.67">could get mad afford SARS is from a</text>
  <text start="1703.07" dur="5.44">subpoena to FinCEN direct banks aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1706.5" dur="4.17">permitted to share them there is no</text>

  <text start="1710.67" dur="3.39">the news hasn&amp;#39;t reported on FinCEN being</text>
  <text start="1712.59" dur="2.76">subpoenaed which is odd as they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1714.06" dur="3.33">reported on just about every other</text>
  <text start="1715.35" dur="3.63">subpoena but Muller has issued that</text>
  <text start="1717.39" dur="3.51">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they weren&amp;#39;t they may have</text>

  <text start="1729.69" dur="4.56">FinCEN why read the initial indictment</text>
  <text start="1732.27" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s all based on suspicious activity</text>
  <text start="1734.25" dur="3.72">money laundering and movement of funds</text>
  <text start="1735.75" dur="5.54">across different jurisdictions what gets</text>
