  <text start="21.3" dur="5.639">and he reviews the memo and he is</text>
  <text start="23.97" dur="5.94">stunned by what he finds Monday morning</text>
  <text start="26.939" dur="4.111">McCabe doesn&amp;#39;t come into work he had</text>
  <text start="29.91" dur="5.7">already announced he was going to be</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="6.9">retiring in March however it&amp;#39;s rumored</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="5.129">and of course there was a spin on this</text>
  <text start="37.95" dur="5.34">too but the media comes out and says you</text>
  <text start="40.739" dur="3.931">know he was fired Trump fired him going</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="4.289">down the whole obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="44.67" dur="4.59">nonsense rabbit hole turns out that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="3.451">not true the White House had nothing to</text>
  <text start="49.26" dur="3.38">do with it&amp;#39;s our sander says that at a</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="3.689">press conference they go back and forth</text>
  <text start="52.64" dur="3.52">nobody knows what the real story is</text>
  <text start="54.719" dur="3.36">anymore because the media isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="5.219">competent in doing their very best to</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="6.54">spin everything into a tailspin so we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="61.379" dur="4.861">got source a source B source Peter sort</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="3.241">you know whatever they call them you</text>
  <text start="66.24" dur="4.41">know sources of a source the cousin</text>
  <text start="67.86" dur="4.95">source comes out and says this is what</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="6.32">happened the cousins brothers stepfather</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="5.34">Sons sister comes in you get the picture</text>
  <text start="76.97" dur="5.469">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="6.45">so McCabe decides he&amp;#39;s gonna go on</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="3.601">basically what he&amp;#39;s doing is he&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="3.39">all of his sick time and accumulated</text>
  <text start="86.04" dur="4.02">time he&amp;#39;s gonna use that until he</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="4.26">retires in march and everybody says well</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="3.989">why not just fire him why not just fire</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="4.38">him and I got to give a hat tip to Dan</text>
  <text start="94.049" dur="7.801">bond Gino who I&amp;#39;ve been listening to on</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="7.169">a binge lately dan bond Gino explains</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="4.14">having the you know Secret Service</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="3.93">experience that there&amp;#39;s like sort of an</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="5.22">administrative protocol when you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="5.731">the payroll at the FBI or than in the</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="4.14">Justice or anywhere in the government in</text>
  <text start="113.46" dur="3.449">terms of intelligence or any department</text>
  <text start="115.35" dur="3.449">and there&amp;#39;s malfeasance or something</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="4.111">that goes on within that department you</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="3.631">still retain your Fifth Amendment right</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="5.669">to non incriminating to</text>
  <text start="122.43" dur="7.139">self-incrimination but they can fire you</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="4.621">and what happens if you&amp;#39;re fired you</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="2.721">don&amp;#39;t get your pension you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="5.3">your retirement</text>
  <text start="132.29" dur="8.16">so it is almost strategically better as</text>
  <text start="136.61" dur="6.93">stupid as it sounds for the government</text>
  <text start="140.45" dur="5.28">to keep these folks hired because it</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="3.95">gives them a lot more leverage over the</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="4.32">person and what they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="147.49" dur="4.45">forced to testify about because they</text>
  <text start="150.05" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t want to lose that money McCabe is</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="4.8">not a billionaire he&amp;#39;s not a millionaire</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="4.2">either he needs his pension it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="156.74" dur="3.18">come it&amp;#39;s not gonna help him much if</text>
  <text start="157.82" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;s in jail but that&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="4.32">basically he&amp;#39;s trying real hard to hang</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="5.37">on for his dan says the five weeks he</text>
  <text start="164.24" dur="6.57">needs to hang on for until he can retire</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="6.48">and get his pension so that&amp;#39;s Dan bungee</text>
  <text start="170.81" dur="5.97">no spin on it so he leaves you know</text>
  <text start="174.02" dur="5.4">everybody&amp;#39;s in a flurry about it the</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="5.46">left is gone crazy when I say left I</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t mean normal everyday liberals who</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t know what the hell is going on or</text>

  <text start="209.6" dur="3.93">throughout this not because I&amp;#39;m relying</text>
  <text start="211.82" dur="4.68">solely on them but because they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="5.16">everything director a we&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="216.5" dur="5.28">today through media reporting of Andrew</text>

  <text start="233" dur="3.57">helping to restore public trust and</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="4.23">confidence in the FBI after the</text>
  <text start="236.57" dur="2.75">significant disruption of the past two</text>
  <text start="238.7" dur="3.12">years</text>
  <text start="239.32" dur="4.389">McCabe&amp;#39;s decision to step down comes at</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="3.87">a time where a confluence of events and</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="4.771">reporting shows serious irregularities</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="4.5">in the FBI and DOJ his investigation of</text>

  <text start="291.61" dur="6.239">for folks so the Republicans Nunez comes</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="5.729">out he drafts a four-page memo</text>
  <text start="297.849" dur="5.19">based on classified information that is</text>
  <text start="300.909" dur="5.19">available I believe through the</text>
  <text start="303.039" dur="4.201">inspector general report the 1.5 million</text>
  <text start="306.099" dur="3.301">documents that everybody&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="5.82">clamoring for which will be public very</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="5.37">soon memo is written based off of all</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="3.12">that information based off of what he</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="2.94">saw back in the day when he went into</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="3.93">the skiff and came out and did a press</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="5.789">conference right after and then you know</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.829">was basically accused being corrupt and</text>
  <text start="323.499" dur="4.801">investigated and cleared and then he</text>
  <text start="324.939" dur="7.681">came back so much this guy&amp;#39;s had to deal</text>
  <text start="328.3" dur="6.329">with so he writes this memo which is</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="4.59">safe enough to release to the public</text>
  <text start="334.629" dur="4.53">without identifying without damaging</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="4.109">national security which is what the</text>
  <text start="339.159" dur="4.171">Democrats are all up in arms about he</text>
  <text start="341.319" dur="3.991">makes the memo available for people to</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="5.88">read before they decide if it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="5.639">be released for 12 Democrats and you</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="3.6">know hundreds of Republicans read it I</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="4.14">think that&amp;#39;s telling in and of itself I</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t have to explain why I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
