  <text start="416.509" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve missed and this morning when I woke</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="7.91">up I jumped right into the saddle here</text>
  <text start="421.069" dur="7.38">so like 4 o&amp;#39;clock in the morning I</text>
  <text start="426.46" dur="3.549">jumped right into the saddle and I</text>
  <text start="428.449" dur="6.321">started researching some stuff and I</text>
  <text start="430.009" dur="8.4">wanted to look into the the referral to</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="6.22">attorney general bar from the Republican</text>
  <text start="438.409" dur="7.051">oversight the members of the Republican</text>
  <text start="440.99" dur="6">Oversight Committee and I wanted to look</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="4.23">into what they were actually saying and</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="4.41">from there I just on a whim for some</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.469">reason super early this morning went</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="4.769">into pacer and I did a search and I came</text>
  <text start="454.159" dur="5.341">up with a lawsuit</text>
  <text start="456.169" dur="6.481">that was just filed against Felix Sater</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="4.86">is a name that you will find very</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="4.889">familiar if you&amp;#39;ve been hanging out on</text>
  <text start="464.36" dur="6.899">my channel for any length of time he was</text>
  <text start="467.539" dur="5.88">invoked quite significantly on Wednesday</text>
  <text start="471.259" dur="5.011">during Michael Cohen&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="473.419" dur="5.011">testimony they left calling him a</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="4.38">convicted Russian mobster while</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="4.919">conveniently leaving out of the equation</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="7.739">that he was a very well regarded and</text>
  <text start="483.349" dur="7.32">used used and used intelligence asset</text>
  <text start="488.389" dur="5.161">for the US government for many many many</text>
  <text start="490.669" dur="6.87">many many many years they left that out</text>
  <text start="493.55" dur="6.149">conveniently and so I was listening to</text>
  <text start="497.539" dur="4.951">this and and I did a search for a Felix</text>
  <text start="499.699" dur="5.011">aiders name I don&amp;#39;t know why but up pops</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="7.229">this lawsuit that was just filed today</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="8.55">in court by the former manager for</text>
  <text start="509.719" dur="7.171">Mariah Carey this timeline can&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="7.05">more strange hold on her name is Stella</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="6.36">bulatnikova Stolper she goes by Stella</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="4.74">Stolper I spent time reading this</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="4.529">complaint that she filed and inside the</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="4.31">complaint it&amp;#39;s basically accusing Felix</text>
  <text start="527.779" dur="7.37">aider and</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="9.51">is assistant of installing backdoors</text>
  <text start="535.149" dur="8.041">onto her electronics and computers in</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="6.24">order to spy on her and she&amp;#39;s suing him</text>
  <text start="543.19" dur="3.81">for damages because she manages</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="3.21">entertainment now and she does all kinds</text>
  <text start="547" dur="4.11">of stuff in the entertainment world and</text>
  <text start="548.32" dur="4.769">she had known him through her sister</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="4.53">when when they were younger and just</text>
  <text start="553.089" dur="4.771">recently hooked back up with him in 2017</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="3.75">and they were spending a lot of time</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="4.71">together and he was spending a lot of</text>
  <text start="559.39" dur="6.8">time in her house and so I guess it went</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="7.17">sour and they had been spying on her and</text>
  <text start="566.19" dur="7.87">she&amp;#39;s suing them now in court about it</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="7.469">now I&amp;#39;m like why would Sater want to spy</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="5.67">on this woman it&amp;#39;s just really really</text>
  <text start="577.209" dur="9.031">weird until I started digging into her a</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="10.13">little bit more and realized that she</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="7.92">was a real estate person back in the day</text>
  <text start="589.86" dur="6.58">now I&amp;#39;m trying to pin down some things</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="4.739">on her right now but she was in the real</text>
  <text start="596.44" dur="4.259">estate business and I started thinking</text>
  <text start="598.899" dur="3.81">about it why would Felix say or be</text>
  <text start="600.699" dur="5.731">wanting to spy on her business contacts</text>
  <text start="602.709" dur="6.24">as she says in her lawsuit well my mind</text>
  <text start="606.43" dur="6.51">jumped immediately to michael Cohen&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="608.949" dur="10.32">testimony on Wednesday because in it and</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="8.55">in this perjury issue the the</text>
  <text start="619.269" dur="5.31">Republicans were questioning Michael</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="6.69">Cohen about a a a financial arrangement</text>
  <text start="624.579" dur="6.26">he made with a kazakhstani bank that he</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="5.88">neglected to inform them about on the</text>
  <text start="630.839" dur="4.421">paperwork and he was basically hired for</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="4.8">a few million dollars by this</text>
  <text start="635.26" dur="8.22">Kazakhstani bank to try and find funds</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="10.229">from BTA Bank that were laundered by the</text>
  <text start="643.48" dur="8.37">former CEO of the bank and as I started</text>
  <text start="649.089" dur="5.25">digging I&amp;#39;m like wait a second that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.85" dur="5.28">interesting because you know who else is</text>
  <text start="654.339" dur="3.831">dealing with BTA Bank at a very high</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="5.39">level right now</text>
  <text start="658.17" dur="9.3">Felix seder Felix aider</text>
  <text start="662.52" dur="8.36">was tied to this guy that used to run</text>
  <text start="667.47" dur="6.989">this Bank and he was taking</text>
  <text start="670.88" dur="6.48">he&amp;#39;s loosely tied to taking this money</text>
  <text start="674.459" dur="6.061">and using it on projects and assisting</text>
  <text start="677.36" dur="6.22">allegedly this laundering of all these</text>
  <text start="680.52" dur="6.42">stolen billions of dollars from BTA Bank</text>
  <text start="683.58" dur="5.28">and so in the lawsuit they&amp;#39;ve been kind</text>
  <text start="686.94" dur="4.53">of going after him for discovery</text>
  <text start="688.86" dur="7.65">so the lawsuit is that BTA Bank is suing</text>
  <text start="691.47" dur="6.57">the former CEO to try and grab this</text>
  <text start="696.51" dur="4.56">money that was laundered back all these</text>
  <text start="698.04" dur="6.39">losses 3.1 million dollars of those</text>
  <text start="701.07" dur="7.29">losses were used to buy three condos in</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="6">Trump Soho which Bay rock group was the</text>
  <text start="708.36" dur="5.46">developer for and those condos were</text>
  <text start="710.43" dur="5.37">purchased and sold rapidly and there are</text>
  <text start="713.82" dur="4.139">other there are other deals not Trump</text>
  <text start="715.8" dur="3.93">related that Bay rock group was involved</text>
  <text start="717.959" dur="5.82">in insajder was involved in tied to this</text>
  <text start="719.73" dur="6.18">money and there are a web of interesting</text>
  <text start="723.779" dur="4.441">connections that I&amp;#39;ve been finding as</text>
  <text start="725.91" dur="5.28">I&amp;#39;m researching this interesting little</text>
  <text start="728.22" dur="5.25">tie here because as we know Cohen and</text>
  <text start="731.19" dur="4.2">Sater are childhood friends and as we</text>
  <text start="733.47" dur="4.859">know I&amp;#39;ve been detailing for a very long</text>
  <text start="735.39" dur="5.699">time that I feel that Cohen was dirty</text>
  <text start="738.329" dur="5.88">and was working with Seder as a plant</text>
  <text start="741.089" dur="5.19">inside of the of the Trump campaign and</text>
  <text start="744.209" dur="6.391">Trump sphere and I said that back in</text>
  <text start="746.279" dur="10.081">April of 2018 probably a little bit</text>
  <text start="750.6" dur="9.6">earlier than that and the issue here is</text>
  <text start="756.36" dur="5.91">that I was able to dig and dig and dig</text>
  <text start="760.2" dur="3.78">and I&amp;#39;m not done yet which is why you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="762.27" dur="4.879">not getting this presented to you today</text>
  <text start="763.98" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;ll probably be late tomorrow if not</text>
  <text start="767.149" dur="4.18">Thursday because Wednesday and well I</text>
  <text start="770.19" dur="2.519">mean I have a bunch of appointments</text>
  <text start="771.329" dur="3.181">coming up so I&amp;#39;m really trying to get</text>
  <text start="772.709" dur="4.041">this stuff out but I&amp;#39;m gonna get it out</text>
  <text start="774.51" dur="5.1">to you as soon as I can</text>
  <text start="776.75" dur="5.64">who is the common thread here believe it</text>
  <text start="779.61" dur="6.93">or not with all of this</text>
  <text start="782.39" dur="7.449">Glenn Simpson from fusion GPS Glenn</text>
  <text start="786.54" dur="6.96">Simpson from fusion GPS mentions in his</text>
  <text start="789.839" dur="5.791">testimony this entire thing and he talks</text>
  <text start="793.5" dur="4.74">about the connection to Rinat</text>
  <text start="795.63" dur="6.3">and he also talks about his connection</text>
  <text start="798.24" dur="6.06">to the owner of prison who is mentioned</text>
  <text start="801.93" dur="4.529">in all sorts of articles as tied to</text>
  <text start="804.3" dur="4.2">Seder and Cohen that I had never seen</text>
  <text start="806.459" dur="3.69">before today and I&amp;#39;m just starting to</text>
  <text start="808.5" dur="5.009">put it all together because of bTW a</text>
  <text start="810.149" dur="4.92">bank so there&amp;#39;s connections there now</text>
  <text start="813.509" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s important to note and I&amp;#39;ll show you</text>
  <text start="815.069" dur="5.971">in in black and white that Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="818.399" dur="4.981">and his testimony basically says Trump</text>
  <text start="821.04" dur="4.049">was definitely not implicated in any of</text>
  <text start="823.38" dur="4.439">this it&amp;#39;s just interesting that Felix</text>
  <text start="825.089" dur="4.86">Sater is and the reason why he knows</text>
  <text start="827.819" dur="6.741">that is because he worked on a story</text>
  <text start="829.949" dur="6.81">about this with Reena back in the day so</text>
  <text start="834.56" dur="4.69">Glenn Simpson and Preveza</text>
  <text start="836.759" dur="4.351">again rearing their ugly head in regards</text>
  <text start="839.25" dur="4.23">to the Trump campaign and spying and</text>
  <text start="841.11" dur="3.899">possible spying on the campaign which at</text>
  <text start="843.48" dur="4.289">this point I think it&amp;#39;s impossible to</text>
  <text start="845.009" dur="7.38">deny and I just find it very interesting</text>
  <text start="847.769" dur="7.411">that this BTA Bank is now paying Michael</text>
  <text start="852.389" dur="5.671">Cohen severed their arrangement</text>
  <text start="855.18" dur="5.07">obviously a little bit in into it not</text>
  <text start="858.06" dur="4.62">not too far into it but but but why</text>
  <text start="860.25" dur="4.079">Michael Cohen is all of a sudden working</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="4.29">for Beatty a bank to try and recover</text>
  <text start="864.329" dur="4.95">money there are so many different ways</text>
  <text start="866.97" dur="4.38">this could go and I&amp;#39;m not positive on it</text>
  <text start="869.279" dur="4.56">yet I&amp;#39;m floating around up top on it</text>
  <text start="871.35" dur="4.38">right now actually like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="873.839" dur="3.631">bothering me I feel very unsettled</text>
  <text start="875.73" dur="3.51">because they don&amp;#39;t have the answer but</text>
  <text start="877.47" dur="3.96">after 12 hours I&amp;#39;ve got to call it quits</text>
  <text start="879.24" dur="4.079">for the day and kind of get some rest so</text>
  <text start="881.43" dur="3.329">I&amp;#39;m gonna continue working on the story</text>
  <text start="883.319" dur="3.301">for you starting first thing in the</text>
  <text start="884.759" dur="3.841">morning and I&amp;#39;m gonna hopefully be able</text>
  <text start="886.62" dur="3.63">to present something very tangible to</text>
  <text start="888.6" dur="4.77">you guys by the end of the day but this</text>
  <text start="890.25" dur="6.209">is definitely definitely interesting</text>
  <text start="893.37" dur="6.48">especially given that on March 14th we</text>
  <text start="896.459" dur="5.82">will be treated to a Felix aider hearing</text>
  <text start="899.85" dur="4.26">in front of in front of the same</text>
  <text start="902.279" dur="4.29">committee that we were listening to the</text>
  <text start="904.11" dur="4.89">last time I believe and I&amp;#39;m sure the</text>
  <text start="906.569" dur="5.01">convicted Russian mobster will have a</text>
  <text start="909" dur="5.22">field day answering Democrat questions</text>
  <text start="911.579" dur="5.851">which completely ignore the fact that he</text>
  <text start="914.22" dur="5.58">was working as per Loretta Lynch as a US</text>
  <text start="917.43" dur="4.409">intelligence asset and if you guys want</text>
  <text start="919.8" dur="5.37">you can look at the you New Yorker and</text>
  <text start="921.839" dur="5.791">you can find the story where Felix aider</text>
  <text start="925.17" dur="3.57">details his intelligence work you can</text>
  <text start="927.63" dur="3.78">also find video</text>
  <text start="928.74" dur="4.05">with Saders name in the title on my</text>
  <text start="931.41" dur="8.64">channel that you can use to catch</text>
  <text start="932.79" dur="9.12">yourselves up it doesn&amp;#39;t end so my</text>
  <text start="940.05" dur="3.57">thought is that there&amp;#39;s a possibility</text>
  <text start="941.91" dur="3.57">and I have not proven this yet so this</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="4.86">is complete and utter speculation on my</text>
  <text start="945.48" dur="5.25">part but because satyr has now flipped</text>
  <text start="948.48" dur="4.08">and is working with the government to</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="3.51">try and recover this money there were</text>
  <text start="952.56" dur="5.04">he&amp;#39;s working with the Southern District</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="10.41">of New York hmm that sounds familiar</text>
  <text start="957.6" dur="9.09">I feel like maybe he was trying maybe</text>
  <text start="964.65" dur="6.23">this woman was part of the because she</text>
  <text start="966.69" dur="6.87">worked for a real estate firm called um</text>
  <text start="970.88" dur="4.33">it&amp;#39;s a big firm so this is why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="973.56" dur="4.59">saying this is speculation Douglas</text>
  <text start="975.21" dur="4.59">Elliman she worked with Douglas Elliman</text>
  <text start="978.15" dur="3.66">and I&amp;#39;m trying and she lived in New York</text>
  <text start="979.8" dur="4.35">and I&amp;#39;m trying to pin down whether or</text>
  <text start="981.81" dur="5.07">not she was involved with some of the</text>
  <text start="984.15" dur="5.51">condos being sold inside of Trump Soho</text>
  <text start="986.88" dur="6.15">and so she might have information</text>
  <text start="989.66" dur="5.11">regarding this money that Felix aider</text>
  <text start="993.03" dur="3.6">figured it would be easy to get if he</text>
  <text start="994.77" dur="5.16">took her if he took her information from</text>
  <text start="996.63" dur="5.25">the information from her you know her</text>
  <text start="999.93" dur="3.69">laptop or whatever communication she was</text>
  <text start="1001.88" dur="3.63">having in terms of iMessage or anything</text>
  <text start="1003.62" dur="3.51">like that and so she&amp;#39;s been out of the</text>
  <text start="1005.51" dur="4.44">real estate market apparently for a</text>
  <text start="1007.13" dur="5.52">while but I&amp;#39;m not done with that yet</text>
  <text start="1009.95" dur="4.53">still more to go anyway</text>
