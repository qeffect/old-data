  <text start="46.11" dur="3.81">install is ideal for supply chain</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="4.471">because the first boot state is</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="4.529">preserved and an unsuspecting user would</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="4.29">think that the OS has never been used in</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="3.991">other words the user will be welcomed by</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="3.93">all the first time settings when first</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="4.02">turning the computer on this can also be</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="3.989">used if the root password is not known</text>
  <text start="62.46" dur="3.6">on the target to conduct this install</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="4.56">the hard drive must be mounted without</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="5.28">using the host OS thereby avoiding the</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="5.61">initial startup sequence or the user</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="6.06">login screen to do this boot the OS from</text>
  <text start="74.729" dur="4.89">the OS X install CD by holding option on</text>

  <text start="91.47" dur="7.59">target vs OS I&amp;#39;m sorry for example in</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="5.279">the terminal type a command string note</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="3.629">the installer script will delete itself</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="4.471">upon execution at this time the only way</text>
  <text start="102.689" dur="6.241">to detect assists X a successful install</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="9.09">is to ensure that the log file structure</text>
  <text start="108.93" dur="6.479">exists CP will remain on the system</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="4.369">unless one of the following conditions</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="5.49">are met the hard drive is reformatted an</text>

  <text start="138.9" dur="4.23">securely delete itself and all tools</text>
  <text start="140.94" dur="4.38">from the file system as an option an</text>
  <text start="143.13" dur="4.26">operator can specify that a tool be left</text>

  <text start="151.47" dur="5.31">failsafe app the failsafe app will</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="4.47">persist through reboot and will act in</text>
  <text start="156.78" dur="4.58">much the same manner as any of the other</text>
