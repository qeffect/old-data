  <text start="8.26" dur="5.49">everyone I don&amp;#39;t do livestreams very</text>
  <text start="11.44" dur="6.44">often so I just wanted to wait until a</text>
  <text start="13.75" dur="8.76">few people join before I start talking</text>
  <text start="17.88" dur="4.63">[Music]</text>
  <text start="22.84" dur="8.359">one person&amp;#39;s here three people are here</text>
  <text start="27.33" dur="6.61">so basically let me just set this camera</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="6.731">basically I just listened to the most</text>
  <text start="33.94" dur="7.14">amazing amazing interview or not</text>
  <text start="37.93" dur="6.99">interview diet like long hour-long</text>
  <text start="41.08" dur="7.17">segments on the Sean Hannity show and I</text>
  <text start="44.92" dur="8.13">shared it on my Twitter and Sean Hannity</text>
  <text start="48.25" dur="8.339">basically broke down every single piece</text>
  <text start="53.05" dur="5.91">of this like every single piece of the</text>
  <text start="56.589" dur="4.231">Seth rich investigation from how it</text>
  <text start="58.96" dur="5.25">destroys the Russian narrative to the</text>
  <text start="60.82" dur="5.369">Julian Assange interview every piece of</text>
  <text start="64.21" dur="3.54">every piece of this investigation he</text>
  <text start="66.189" dur="3.121">just broke it down everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="67.75" dur="4.979">been sharing everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="69.31" dur="4.08">doing all of it he literally spent over</text>
  <text start="72.729" dur="3.061">an hour</text>
  <text start="73.39" dur="5.339">basically like gearing up for this</text>
  <text start="75.79" dur="4.56">kim.com thing and you know I have to say</text>
  <text start="78.729" dur="5.371">the one thing that kind of bothered me</text>
  <text start="80.35" dur="6.089">was that he said that he didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="84.1" dur="4.799">share everything he knew and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="86.439" dur="4.56">know if that&amp;#39;s because he&amp;#39;s waiting for</text>
  <text start="88.899" dur="5.731">tomorrow or if it&amp;#39;s just stuff he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="90.999" dur="5.521">share yet but basically the people the</text>
  <text start="94.63" dur="4.019">folks that he had on his show have also</text>
  <text start="96.52" dur="4.94">been doing investigations of their own</text>
  <text start="98.649" dur="6.21">and he had a detective on a show who</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="4.96">said the same thing that this you know</text>
  <text start="104.859" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re all saying it&amp;#39;s a robbery it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="106.42" dur="4.29">robbery it&amp;#39;s a robbery it&amp;#39;s robbery well</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="3">first of all he was shot and killed so</text>
  <text start="110.71" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s a murder</text>
  <text start="111.31" dur="4.53">end of story and it should be treated as</text>
  <text start="114.13" dur="3.689">a murder investigation especially since</text>
  <text start="115.84" dur="5.61">they didn&amp;#39;t take anything which we all</text>
  <text start="117.819" dur="8.01">know so it was really telling to watch</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="7.14">and or to listen to and it was it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.829" dur="5.011">almost like what timeline are we because</text>
  <text start="128.59" dur="6.92">for Sean Hannity to put himself out</text>
  <text start="130.84" dur="8.28">there like this on such a huge story is</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="5.79">beyond fantastic and I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="139.12" dur="4.83">surprised about it to be honest with you</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="4.019">the other thing that I wanted to say is</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="6.679">if you haven&amp;#39;t checked</text>
  <text start="145.319" dur="7.691">Jimmy&amp;#39;s llama calm her blog has another</text>
  <text start="150.629" dur="3.021">another update where she&amp;#39;s got some more</text>
  <text start="153.01" dur="5.11">information</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="6.21">and a lot of it points back to kind of</text>
  <text start="158.12" dur="4.199">what and we credit him to what George</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="4.32">Webb is saying and I have gotten some</text>
  <text start="162.319" dur="3.631">feedback from some folks that I know</text>
  <text start="164.18" dur="6.119">that are kind of echoing the same thing</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="6.149">that Seth Richardson that the reason why</text>
  <text start="170.299" dur="5.731">he had those bruises is because he was</text>
  <text start="172.099" dur="5.521">roughed up during an interrogation so</text>
  <text start="176.03" dur="3.09">Jimmy&amp;#39;s llama and I have been kind of</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="5.13">working together to piece that together</text>
  <text start="179.12" dur="5.789">and get out some new details information</text>
  <text start="182.75" dur="4.459">I know there&amp;#39;s another um there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.909" dur="5.311">another post from her coming very soon</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="5.741">so keep your eyes peeled for that she</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="5.669">works so hard so hard</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="5.73">stupid stand is not working anyway she</text>
  <text start="195.889" dur="4.591">works really hard on her blog and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="3.869">got some really detailed stuff in there</text>
  <text start="200.48" dur="6.75">and it does all tie back into Shawn</text>
  <text start="202.549" dur="8.461">Lucas the DMC lawsuit if this piece gets</text>
  <text start="207.23" dur="5.759">out and it&amp;#39;s exposed and let&amp;#39;s say cam</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="4.309">calm actually does have the information</text>
  <text start="212.989" dur="5.071">that he&amp;#39;s claiming that he has it</text>
  <text start="215.319" dur="4.661">destroys the Trump Russian narrative</text>
  <text start="218.06" dur="4.019">completely destroys the Russia hack the</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="4.379">election narrative it destroys it and</text>
  <text start="222.079" dur="4.921">then the rest of everything else comes</text>
  <text start="224.359" dur="4.821">tumbling down afterwards so I think a</text>
  <text start="227" dur="6.269">key part of this that people are</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="6.429">overlooking is the part where in my</text>
  <text start="233.269" dur="6.78">first in my video about Seth rich I</text>
  <text start="235.609" dur="8.94">shared the Infowars interview with his</text>
  <text start="240.049" dur="8.78">attorney who&amp;#39;s a Republican lobbyist an</text>
  <text start="244.549" dur="7.65">attorney and in that interview he</text>
  <text start="248.829" dur="6.25">basically says I got and this is back in</text>
  <text start="252.199" dur="5.551">August I got two phone calls from people</text>
  <text start="255.079" dur="5.641">close to this who say that they have</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="7.74">sources that told them that Seth rich</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="7.8">was murdered by Russian KGB like</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="4.32">operatives and milli Weaver I believe is</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="3.179">the one who&amp;#39;s doing the interview and</text>
  <text start="269.81" dur="4.62">she&amp;#39;s like that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="271.699" dur="4.861">there&amp;#39;s no reason why Russia would want</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="3.51">to kill Seth rich for like it just</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="3.62">didn&amp;#39;t make any sense they were already</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.19">trying to tie this to rush it then in</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="4.81">August so this narrative has been going</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="3.119">on for quite a long time and there are</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="5.459">quite a few</text>
  <text start="286.249" dur="6.3">there are quite a few blog timelines out</text>
  <text start="290.449" dur="4.5">there that people have graces graciously</text>
  <text start="292.549" dur="3.93">shared with me and and Jimmy&amp;#39;s llama</text>
  <text start="294.949" dur="3.21">does the same thing in her newest blog</text>
  <text start="296.479" dur="4.29">entry where she goes through basically</text>
  <text start="298.159" dur="6.66">times and dates etc and so on and so</text>
  <text start="300.769" dur="6.51">forth and all of the timelines line up</text>
  <text start="304.819" dur="6.33">to that one email from Podesta where he</text>
  <text start="307.279" dur="5.64">says I&amp;#39;m up for making an example of an</text>
  <text start="311.149" dur="4.92">of a suspected leak or whether there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.919" dur="5.25">any basis for it or not and there was</text>
  <text start="316.069" dur="4.92">also another tidbit of information that</text>
  <text start="318.169" dur="4.92">came across where there were two people</text>
  <text start="320.989" dur="5.22">killed in Myrtle Beach South Carolina</text>
  <text start="323.089" dur="6.57">and we&amp;#39;re kind of debunking that at this</text>
  <text start="326.209" dur="4.83">point because it&amp;#39;s an editable field</text>
  <text start="329.659" dur="3.78">that you can edit with employment</text>
  <text start="331.039" dur="9.21">updates etc so on and so forth I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="333.439" dur="8.82">going to pull over here hold on um that</text>
  <text start="340.249" dur="4.62">you can you know kind of edit with</text>
  <text start="342.259" dur="8.75">updates and stuff so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="344.869" dur="9.18">necessarily it&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text>
  <text start="351.009" dur="6.851">legitimate so we&amp;#39;re kind of debunking</text>
  <text start="354.049" dur="5.19">that as we go here also also because I</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="4.319">want to look at you guys because I love</text>
  <text start="359.239" dur="5.85">you all so what we&amp;#39;re finding which is</text>
  <text start="362.179" dur="4.86">is not new for us at all but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.089" dur="4.92">getting just worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="367.039" dur="5.64">and worse and it&amp;#39;s annoying and I have</text>
  <text start="370.009" dur="5.7">to call it out is that there are people</text>
  <text start="372.679" dur="7.5">in this movement with huge names huge</text>
  <text start="375.709" dur="6.57">names right and I personally have</text>
  <text start="380.179" dur="4.44">reached out to them to get a story out</text>
  <text start="382.279" dur="5.22">when I don&amp;#39;t have as large of a reach as</text>
  <text start="384.619" dur="4.98">they do wanting to get information</text>
  <text start="387.499" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s very valid and very valuable out</text>
  <text start="389.599" dur="4.43">to a large amount of people and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="392.419" dur="3.99">noticed that it&amp;#39;s been ignored</text>
  <text start="394.029" dur="4.15">constantly consistently it was ignored</text>
  <text start="396.409" dur="4.5">nobody answered me back everybody</text>
  <text start="398.179" dur="5.4">you know maybe they get too many DMS who</text>
  <text start="400.909" dur="4.17">knows but when you start to see now I</text>
  <text start="403.579" dur="3.09">haven&amp;#39;t done this in a long time but</text>
  <text start="405.079" dur="3">when you start to see there are other</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="4.17">folks that are pulling the same</text>
  <text start="408.079" dur="4.26">information that you had that really no</text>
  <text start="410.839" dur="5.67">one else has been covering and claiming</text>
  <text start="412.339" dur="6.3">it was their own it gets frustrating so</text>
  <text start="416.509" dur="3.571">you&amp;#39;ve seen a bunch of that going on</text>
  <text start="418.639" dur="4.53">over the past couple days</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;m not looking just that I guess it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.169" dur="3.99">like if you were to go to work and then</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="5.009">your co-workers stole the work that</text>
  <text start="427.159" dur="7.681">you&amp;#39;d worked on for like 48 hours</text>
  <text start="430.099" dur="6.181">straight and then said sorry you know</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="3.329">this is what I did look what I uncovered</text>
  <text start="436.28" dur="5.849">and then use it for themselves and then</text>
  <text start="438.169" dur="6.9">made tons of money off of it it just</text>
  <text start="442.129" dur="7.231">feels like that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s frustrating</text>
  <text start="445.069" dur="5.641">and it&amp;#39;s annoying and it&amp;#39;s said and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="2.7">been approached by a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="4.98">that have had this happen to them as</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="4.949">well so I&amp;#39;m just going to keep going and</text>
  <text start="455.69" dur="3.18">hopefully you guys will keep sharing</text>
  <text start="457.009" dur="3.78">stuff so that people get the information</text>
  <text start="458.87" dur="3.539">because it seems like when I reach out</text>
  <text start="460.789" dur="4.111">to certain people that have a lot of</text>
  <text start="462.409" dur="5.611">following with some really good info</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="5.509">it&amp;#39;s ignore it until later on as far as</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="5.489">kim.com goes it&amp;#39;s Tuesday in New Zealand</text>
  <text start="470.409" dur="6.82">about five hours ago or three hours ago</text>
  <text start="473.509" dur="8.011">it was Tuesday I&amp;#39;m assuming that he</text>
  <text start="477.229" dur="7.861">meant Tuesday in the United States and I</text>
  <text start="481.52" dur="8.009">I differ with people and that I trust</text>

  <text start="489.529" dur="7.471">come out with some some juice so I think</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s going to be it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="497" dur="5.43">exciting to watch and I think that</text>
  <text start="499.94" dur="6.089">George Webb is really doing some amazing</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="6.269">work amazing work um I I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="506.029" dur="4.44">watch a lot of what he does believe it</text>
  <text start="508.699" dur="3.241">or not because it seems like we&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="510.469" dur="3.69">investigating the same stuff at the same</text>
  <text start="511.94" dur="4.889">time and I need to start watching him a</text>
