  <text start="101.52" dur="4.349">lot of things that are going on right</text>
  <text start="103.2" dur="5.37">now in terms of the crypto world there</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="5.371">is a split that will be happening with</text>

  <text start="150.38" dur="6.3">Bitcoin to buy some Bitcoin is basically</text>
  <text start="154.1" dur="4.77">the gold standard of crypto so</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="3.6">everything basically converts back to</text>

  <text start="160.28" dur="5.31">alternative crypto you buy Bitcoin you</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="3.96">use the Bitcoin to buy the crypto and</text>
