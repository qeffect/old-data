  <text start="2.879" dur="5.941">privileged to join with Brandon Straka</text>
  <text start="5.97" dur="5.49">here who is going to talk to us about</text>
  <text start="8.82" dur="4.949">this amazing viral ridiculously awesome</text>
  <text start="11.46" dur="4.95">so passionate campaign called the</text>
  <text start="13.769" dur="5.131">walkaway movement and thank you for</text>
  <text start="16.41" dur="4.699">giving me some of your time you are busy</text>

  <text start="21.109" dur="3.91">thank you for having me it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="23.16" dur="3.3">great to be here but there&amp;#39;s one thing I</text>
  <text start="25.019" dur="4.141">asked right out of the gate I have to</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="4.95">say it&amp;#39;s the hashtag walkaway campaign</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="4.07">and the reason why I need to make sure</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="5.309">to clarify that is because we have</text>
  <text start="33.23" dur="5.98">imposters and somebody on Facebook has</text>
  <text start="36.719" dur="4.321">created a copycat page which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="39.21" dur="4.349">calling the walkway movement that is not</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="6.39">us yes you&amp;#39;re experiencing a lot of that</text>
  <text start="43.559" dur="5.91">now huh yes so we&amp;#39;re gonna get into</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="4.08">everything behind this and how you came</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="4.551">up with it but I want to first talk</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="6">about you</text>
  <text start="54.02" dur="5.44">you know you&amp;#39;ve kind of ventured right</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="4.979">into the belly of the beast however you</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="5.159">do have the experience of kind of being</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="3.63">inside that machine too because you were</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="3.271">a part of the party you were part of the</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="5.731">philosophy for a little while so explain</text>
  <text start="67.89" dur="7.89">to me how all this has been for you well</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve been so busy I haven&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="4.26">really had all that much time to process</text>
  <text start="78" dur="3.93">it and that&amp;#39;s on both ends I&amp;#39;ve I</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="5.31">haven&amp;#39;t had an enormous amount of time</text>
  <text start="81.93" dur="5.189">to sulk at the negative and I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="3.57">added that much time to celebrate the</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="3.811">positive it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s kind of just</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="4.86">been like trying to keep up with a</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="4.74">locomotive that&amp;#39;s like in motion but I</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="3.18">mean that being said it&amp;#39;s incredible</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="4.26">first of all I&amp;#39;m so excited</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="6.18">that people are responding to walk away</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="5.1">and that it seems to be you know what</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="4.019">it&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t really even know which</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="3.54">is better that the people on the Left</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="4.801">who are reaching out to me and saying</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="7.159">thank you so much for kind of creating</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="6.63">this this platform for us to feel</text>
  <text start="115.729" dur="5.201">embraced and encouraged to do something</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="4.139">we&amp;#39;ve wanted to do for a long time or or</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="3.75">maybe even just recently which is walk</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="4.291">away there are the people on the right</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="4.109">who are reaching out to me and like on a</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="4.56">daily basis giving me these messages</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="5.011">that say I haven&amp;#39;t had hope in eight</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="4.74">years I haven&amp;#39;t had hope in 10 years</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="5.31">and I finally have hope again I mean</text>
  <text start="136.32" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s incredible just I covered a</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="3.36">bunch of this on my podcast like the</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="3.78">stories and stuff they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="4.59">inspirational and and you know I think</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not even that you can clarify</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="4.59">this for me but for me looking at this</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s not even a case of you need to walk</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="3.72">away and be a trump supporter or you</text>
  <text start="153.84" dur="4.83">need to walk away and be a conservative</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="5.67">even just walk away from this garbage</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="3.9">that we&amp;#39;re seeing right I mean what was</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="3.18">your thought when you did it was it was</text>
  <text start="162.57" dur="2.25">it be a conservative or was it just get</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="3.15">out of there</text>
  <text start="164.82" dur="4.5">just get out of there um you know a lot</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="4.28">of people are asked well not a lot of</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="4.41">people that thankfully it&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="171.65" dur="3.91">minority of people are reaching out to</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="4.83">me and saying yeah walk away but what do</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="4.14">we walk to and I have to tell them you</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="3.03">got to figure that out that&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="4.56">journey like ah I&amp;#39;m not starting a</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="4.89">religion I&amp;#39;m not starting a cult and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;m not planning to start a new</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="5.19">political party although a lot of people</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="6.24">like hey but no that&amp;#39;s not the plan but</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s literally it&amp;#39;s I mean in fact</text>
  <text start="194.46" dur="4.2">for me to tell anyone what to do is</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="4.77">completely counterintuitive really to</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="4.68">what the campaign is about because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="4.11">walking away from the groupthink I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="4.56">walking away from the tribal mentality</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m walking toward and now I happen to</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="4.23">find myself walking to the Republican</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="4.19">Party that&amp;#39;s what I did and that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="5.22">happen overnight I mean that was after</text>
  <text start="214.37" dur="7.42">months of intense introspection and</text>
  <text start="217.35" dur="6.57">months of research and and it was not a</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="6.03">decision that I came by easily I mean it</text>
  <text start="223.92" dur="6.06">was I I really had to have like a lot of</text>
  <text start="227.82" dur="3.87">reckoning with myself because I used to</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="3.84">have very negative opinions about the</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="3.24">Republican Party so it wasn&amp;#39;t just sort</text>
  <text start="233.82" dur="2.79">of like I was like I&amp;#39;m not a Democrat</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="4.2">anymore now I&amp;#39;m Republican I mean it was</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="4.26">it was a lot of thoughts and I could</text>
  <text start="239.13" dur="4.74">never in a million years expect someone</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="4.29">else to just make the same decision I</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="3.36">did without going through that same</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="3.63">journey in process and I encourage</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="3.69">people to have that journey and have</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="3.89">that process but you don&amp;#39;t have to end</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="3.93">up in the same place and quite frankly</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="4.059">even if you have that journey in that</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="3.84">process and you say no I think the</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="4.351">Democrat Party is where I belong I think</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s really great great that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="4.889">but it&amp;#39;s like you know stop just going</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="3.39">along with the anger and the rage</text>
  <text start="265.979" dur="5.071">narrative and the</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="4.95">hostility and that all this crap that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="3.66">going on on the left right now that</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="4.2">honestly I most of people I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="3.96">even realize most people don&amp;#39;t even I</text>
  <text start="276.72" dur="3.36">really am I look I don&amp;#39;t think that most</text>
  <text start="278.67" dur="4.95">people even realize what it is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="5.16">upset about they&amp;#39;re just upset and and</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="6.3">so much of what they&amp;#39;re upset about is</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="7.02">based off of false media narratives yeah</text>
  <text start="289.92" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s been like a massive you know</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="4.89">programming campaign and I&amp;#39;ve always yes</text>
  <text start="294.84" dur="4.05">yeah I&amp;#39;ve always said that like you know</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="3.39">some people you just have to leave</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="2.82">behind because they&amp;#39;re not gonna make it</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="3.27">to the next step it&amp;#39;s just not gonna</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="4.8">happen but there are people like you and</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="4.83">I think anybody who values liberty and</text>
  <text start="306.51" dur="4.11">freedom whether they are classic liberal</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="3.78">or they thought they were a Democrat or</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re on the right a libertarian a</text>
  <text start="312.42" dur="5.04">conservative whatever it is they they</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="5.07">have this sort of internal yearning for</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="5.22">truth and freedom and to get to the</text>
  <text start="319.92" dur="4.29">point after all of this rhetoric to be</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="3.12">able to do what you did takes a lot of</text>
  <text start="324.21" dur="2.97">courage and again like you said self</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="2.73">introspection because you have to admit</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="2.73">that you were wrong about things and</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s not easy for letting people to do</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="4.41">so what was the trigger for you like</text>
  <text start="331.92" dur="4.5">trigger what was the moment where you</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="3.11">were like okay something&amp;#39;s not right</text>
  <text start="336.42" dur="4.23">here</text>
  <text start="337.43" dur="5.44">well I mean I think where things really</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="4.77">started like my eyes really started to</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="4.23">be open was when a friend of mine sent</text>
  <text start="345.42" dur="3.45">me you know after the election you know</text>
  <text start="347.1" dur="5.04">I was going on Facebook and going on</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="5.55">these long rants about how because I</text>
  <text start="352.14" dur="5.4">grew up in Nebraska and I grew up in a</text>
  <text start="354.42" dur="4.77">small farm community and so I knew that</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="6.3">most of the people that I grew up with</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="5.91">will probably Trump supporters and so I</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="2.64">just couldn&amp;#39;t figure out what had</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="3.21">happened because there I disagreed with</text>
  <text start="366.48" dur="4.23">them politically and had for most of my</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="4.46">life I didn&amp;#39;t think of them as evil</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="4.44">horrible people you know I just thought</text>
  <text start="372.77" dur="4.15">we had political differences and I think</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="3.48">that and I thought that you know and a</text>
  <text start="376.92" dur="4.02">lot of those differences they were very</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="4.77">misguided but this was next level</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="4.5">because I was you know very much</text>
  <text start="383.4" dur="3.48">believing what the left-wing media was</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="4.08">putting out I mean we were talking about</text>
  <text start="386.88" dur="4.92">things like having a Nazi in the White</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="4.68">House I mean we were talking about a man</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="7.32">who was staffing his administration with</text>
  <text start="394.2" dur="6.809">KKK supporters and neo-nazis and I mean</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="4.109">I feel like an idiot</text>
  <text start="401.009" dur="3.9">but I believed it I did I totally</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="5.071">believed it the reason why I believed it</text>
  <text start="404.909" dur="5.04">is because throughout his campaign they</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="4.319">would you know they would go to his</text>
  <text start="409.949" dur="4.62">rallies they would when they say they I</text>
  <text start="412.619" dur="4.26">mean the the left-wing media they would</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="3.99">frame-up shots where there were no</text>
  <text start="416.879" dur="3.09">people of color in the shots even though</text>
  <text start="418.559" dur="3.06">there were people of color at the</text>
  <text start="419.969" dur="3.331">rallies but you know they would find a</text>
  <text start="421.619" dur="4.32">nice little section of white people and</text>
  <text start="423.3" dur="6.869">frame in on them and then they would</text>
  <text start="425.939" dur="7.831">take a 10 a 15 second soundbite from his</text>
  <text start="430.169" dur="5.31">elect from his campaign and twist it</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="4.139">into something that it wasn&amp;#39;t and one of</text>
  <text start="435.479" dur="5.881">those things was that he mocked a</text>
  <text start="437.909" dur="4.861">reporter&amp;#39;s disability now that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="2.82">looked like because they took that</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="3">little moment they put a banner</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="4.349">underneath it saying trump marks</text>
  <text start="445.77" dur="4.769">reporter&amp;#39;s disability and those of us on</text>
  <text start="448.529" dur="4.47">the left watch that and we said oh my</text>
  <text start="450.539" dur="4.081">god what a monster and then we saw all</text>
  <text start="452.999" dur="3.39">the people behind them cheering and</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="3.539">laughing you know at the spectacle of</text>
  <text start="456.389" dur="4.53">making fun of somebody who has a</text>
  <text start="458.159" dur="5.13">handicap now that&amp;#39;s what we believed so</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="5.191">I&amp;#39;m on social media you know writing my</text>
  <text start="463.289" dur="4.891">long rant about how the people of middle</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="4.26">America had lost their their soul and</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="4.5">their their conscience and you know that</text>
  <text start="470.37" dur="5.069">there was a crisis of conscience and you</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="4.829">know although the red states and a</text>
  <text start="475.439" dur="3.45">friend of mine from social media who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.509" dur="2.88">been a conservative her whole life</text>
  <text start="478.889" dur="5.09">reached out to me and she presented me</text>
  <text start="480.389" dur="6.15">with a youtube video which was labeled</text>
  <text start="483.979" dur="4.87">debunking that Trump mocked the disabled</text>
  <text start="486.539" dur="4.77">reporter now I saw this title and I was</text>
  <text start="488.849" dur="4.951">enraged just at the title before I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="491.309" dur="4.44">even seen it much like people are</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="3.419">enraged by the new Supreme Court nominee</text>
  <text start="495.749" dur="2.69">without even knowing who he is or</text>
  <text start="497.219" dur="3.6">anything about him</text>
  <text start="498.439" dur="3.82">but I read this title and I just</text>
  <text start="500.819" dur="3.93">instantly thought well this is going to</text>
  <text start="502.259" dur="4.821">be a propaganda video this is going to</text>
  <text start="504.749" dur="5.01">be full of lies and so I was already</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="4.839">gearing up for the fight so I watched</text>
  <text start="509.759" dur="4.71">the video and what it showed me was it</text>
  <text start="511.919" dur="4.381">was many minutes long and it showed a</text>
  <text start="514.469" dur="4.38">compilation of footage going back many</text>
  <text start="516.3" dur="4.469">years of Donald Trump even before the</text>
  <text start="518.849" dur="4.201">campaign just when he was Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="520.769" dur="4.38">citizen and moments in the campaign</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="5.13">where he was using that exact same voice</text>
  <text start="525.149" dur="5.101">and that exact same gesture multiple</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="3.63">times every time he was making fun of</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="3.029">somebody who was caught in a lie</text>
  <text start="531.81" dur="2.91">or somebody who had does something shady</text>
  <text start="533.279" dur="3.511">or somebody who had was robbed</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="3.989">like it quickly became apparent that</text>

  <text start="538.709" dur="3.841">man&amp;#39;s disability whatsoever it was an</text>
  <text start="540.839" dur="3.69">unfortunate coincidence that that man</text>

  <text start="546.959" dur="4.021">I was watching this and it was like a</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="3.989">light bulb went on but also it was</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="3.57">mind-blowing because it&amp;#39;s like my brain</text>
  <text start="552.899" dur="5.071">couldn&amp;#39;t even really accept it because I</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="6.06">thought wait a minute it&amp;#39;s almost as if</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="6.03">the media wasn&amp;#39;t being honest right here</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="5.25">like that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense so I</text>

  <text start="565.86" dur="3.089">will you watch this video what do you</text>
  <text start="567.48" dur="4.169">think about this now a lot of them would</text>
  <text start="568.949" dur="4.291">become angry at me even suggesting that</text>
  <text start="571.649" dur="3.031">they watch it you know why would we</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="3.329">watch that I mean what would it prove I</text>

  <text start="578.16" dur="3.81">good guy just maybe he didn&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="3.75">one thing but you know and I would I</text>
  <text start="581.97" dur="5.64">would started becoming obvious to me was</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="5.579">that these people didn&amp;#39;t even want to be</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="3.99">presented with any information that</text>
  <text start="589.319" dur="6.181">would make it harder for them to hate</text>

  <text start="595.5" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;ve been doing is screaming and</text>

  <text start="607.079" dur="3.331">thing that could possibly happen Here I</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="3.419">am presenting you with something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.41" dur="3.299">saying hey maybe things aren&amp;#39;t as bad as</text>
  <text start="612.209" dur="3.87">they seem maybe we don&amp;#39;t actually have</text>

  <text start="619.379" dur="3.21">you just want to be angry and I sort of</text>
  <text start="621.36" dur="2.37">started going on this mission then to</text>
  <text start="622.589" dur="3.36">find out more like what else was the</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="4.049">press dishonest about and I started see</text>
  <text start="625.949" dur="5.43">seeking answers to that what I found</text>
  <text start="627.779" dur="6.06">were this this trove of evidence that</text>
  <text start="631.379" dur="5.161">they had just completely created a</text>
  <text start="633.839" dur="4.411">narrative but you know none of this was</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="3.81">ever supposed to happen he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="638.25" dur="4.019">supposed to win she was supposed to win</text>
  <text start="640.35" dur="5.4">and they had counted on getting away</text>
  <text start="642.269" dur="5.641">with all of this the idea was you know</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="4.529">people on the left are triggered by</text>
  <text start="647.91" dur="4.83">social injustice people on the Left are</text>
  <text start="650.279" dur="4.35">triggered by racism and homophobia so</text>
  <text start="652.74" dur="3.779">they thought to themselves will be very</text>
  <text start="654.629" dur="3.21">clever and what we&amp;#39;re gonna do is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.519" dur="3.841">gonna find these little soundbites</text>
  <text start="657.839" dur="5.131">anywhere we can isolate them and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="660.36" dur="4.349">gonna spin it as Trump makes racist</text>
  <text start="662.97" dur="3.43">statement Trump makes homophobic</text>
  <text start="664.709" dur="3.881">statement Trump makes river and</text>
  <text start="666.4" dur="4.86">people on the left will go crazy and</text>
  <text start="668.59" dur="5.67">people on the right will be so ashamed</text>
  <text start="671.26" dur="4.89">that they&amp;#39;re following a bigot that they</text>
  <text start="674.26" dur="3.15">will be willing to vote for him that was</text>
  <text start="676.15" dur="1.86">the plan well that didn&amp;#39;t work out so</text>
  <text start="677.41" dur="4.86">well</text>
  <text start="678.01" dur="5.73">it backfired spectacularly except the</text>
  <text start="682.27" dur="4.65">people on the left never figured it out</text>
  <text start="683.74" dur="5.61">I did and a few other people are you</text>
  <text start="686.92" dur="4.98">know the sleep mask is coming off and</text>
  <text start="689.35" dur="5.58">the Sun is coming out and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="691.9" dur="5.82">starting to figure it out but you know</text>
  <text start="694.93" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s they really and then what I think</text>
  <text start="697.72" dur="3.6">happened next was he got elected they</text>
  <text start="700.12" dur="5.46">didn&amp;#39;t expect that and they thought to</text>
  <text start="701.32" dur="6.33">themselves Oh F now we have to find a</text>
  <text start="705.58" dur="4.56">way to make everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="707.65" dur="3.6">saying for the last 18 months true you</text>
  <text start="710.14" dur="2.73">know I mean like we&amp;#39;ve just spent the</text>
  <text start="711.25" dur="2.94">last 18 months saying that this is a</text>
  <text start="712.87" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ve got a Nazi a bigot a racist</text>
  <text start="714.19" dur="4.92">whatever what do we do now now we just</text>
  <text start="717.22" dur="3.81">have to like double down and really go</text>
  <text start="719.11" dur="3.63">for it because otherwise we have to</text>
  <text start="721.03" dur="5.52">admit we were lying for the last 18</text>
  <text start="722.74" dur="6.27">months and they made it like 30 times</text>
  <text start="726.55" dur="4.26">bigger now and in fact having even worse</text>
  <text start="729.01" dur="3.3">of an effect I mean you know I watched</text>
  <text start="730.81" dur="5.52">your video when it first came out and I</text>
  <text start="732.31" dur="5.97">was like oh not because he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="736.33" dur="3.69">because you had the guts to do that did</text>
  <text start="738.28" dur="3.42">you expect this I know these are very</text>
  <text start="740.02" dur="2.82">cliche questions but this is the first</text>
  <text start="741.7" dur="3.6">time I&amp;#39;m kind of really speaking to you</text>
  <text start="742.84" dur="6.18">so did you did you expect this to happen</text>
  <text start="745.3" dur="5.28">like what did you expect here&amp;#39;s how I</text>
  <text start="749.02" dur="2.97">haven&amp;#39;t asked that question before but</text>
  <text start="750.58" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s not the easiest question to answer</text>
  <text start="751.99" dur="5.85">because what it is is when I made it I</text>
  <text start="754.66" dur="5.07">dreamed that this would happen but I did</text>
  <text start="757.84" dur="5.25">not expect that it would happen I</text>
  <text start="759.73" dur="6.3">thought because it was I felt like this</text>
  <text start="763.09" dur="5.82">was so dangerous what I was doing and it</text>
  <text start="766.03" dur="6.06">had such a potential to be like a powder</text>
  <text start="768.91" dur="6.18">keg that would just blow up in my face</text>
  <text start="772.09" dur="4.5">and and potentially ruin my life you</text>
  <text start="775.09" dur="3.18">know I mean I fully prepared myself for</text>
  <text start="776.59" dur="3.57">the possibility that I may release this</text>
  <text start="778.27" dur="4.53">video and it may be watched by a sum</text>
  <text start="780.16" dur="5.16">total of 50 people and those 50 people</text>
  <text start="782.8" dur="4.29">may all be the 50 people who maybe at</text>
  <text start="785.32" dur="3.9">some point in charge of whether or not I</text>
  <text start="787.09" dur="3.93">get a job you know like people that I</text>
  <text start="789.22" dur="3.33">may be interviewing for in the future</text>
  <text start="791.02" dur="3.3">for employment and they&amp;#39;re like oh</text>
  <text start="792.55" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re that Nazi guy from that video</text>
  <text start="794.32" dur="4.38">that that&amp;#39;s 50 people watched sorry</text>
  <text start="796.6" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re not giving out any jobs today</text>
  <text start="798.7" dur="3.93">you know I saw</text>
  <text start="799.84" dur="6.2">I prepared myself for that but I dreamed</text>
  <text start="802.63" dur="7.38">that this would happen and so I am</text>
  <text start="806.04" dur="5.74">grateful to God that it&amp;#39;s being received</text>
  <text start="810.01" dur="3.24">the way that it&amp;#39;s being received yeah I</text>
  <text start="811.78" dur="3.78">mean you really took a leap of faith I</text>
  <text start="813.25" dur="3.84">mean you know just let me ask a</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="3.15">difficult question and you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="4.14">answer if you don&amp;#39;t want to did you ever</text>
  <text start="818.71" dur="4.56">participate in like the rallies and the</text>

  <text start="929.29" dur="3.09">really important about what you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="930.88" dur="2.12">you&amp;#39;re a normal person right you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="932.38" dur="2.27">normal person</text>
  <text start="933" dur="6.18">your celebrity now but you are a normal</text>
  <text start="934.65" dur="5.91">person before you became one and I think</text>
  <text start="939.18" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people and I keep</text>
  <text start="940.56" dur="3.57">saying this the media asked for that</text>
  <text start="942.84" dur="2.88">question for a reason because I wanted</text>
  <text start="944.13" dur="4.35">you to say exactly what you said the</text>
  <text start="945.72" dur="4.95">media amplifies those negative hateful</text>
  <text start="948.48" dur="4.11">crazies to make them look like the</text>
  <text start="950.67" dur="6.15">majority and scare not only the people</text>
  <text start="952.59" dur="5.79">within your former movement into silence</text>
  <text start="956.82" dur="3.87">to think that they&amp;#39;re a minority but</text>
  <text start="958.38" dur="4.08">also to scare the other side from</text>
  <text start="960.69" dur="3.75">approaching these people and make them</text>
  <text start="962.46" dur="4.62">feel like their minority so what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="964.44" dur="4.68">doing is saying no no we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="967.08" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s something inherently wrong about</text>
  <text start="969.12" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s going on here and we need to join</text>
  <text start="971.4" dur="4.14">together regardless of what that means</text>
  <text start="973.17" dur="5.43">my question to you is a little bit like</text>
  <text start="975.54" dur="5.25">I always wondered this now did you are</text>
  <text start="978.6" dur="4.29">you inherently a political person or was</text>
  <text start="980.79" dur="4.88">it always like an activism standpoint</text>
  <text start="982.89" dur="6.03">for you growing up and and now now I</text>
  <text start="985.67" dur="6.4">would say that I was more of an activist</text>
  <text start="988.92" dur="5.4">than a fully rounded political person</text>
  <text start="992.07" dur="4.05">because you know I was a big like Obama</text>
  <text start="994.32" dur="4.74">supporter and I was a big Hillary</text>
  <text start="996.12" dur="7.469">supporter but really what it stemmed</text>
  <text start="999.06" dur="6.12">from was like like one issue kind of</text>
  <text start="1003.589" dur="4.051">like gay rights I was a big like gay</text>
  <text start="1005.18" dur="4.08">rights advocate and in that respect I</text>
  <text start="1007.64" dur="2.73">was very involved in the thing you know</text>
  <text start="1009.26" dur="5.73">and to see the thing is that hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1010.37" dur="7.83">changed my feelings on gay rights gay</text>
  <text start="1014.99" dur="7.32">community marriage equality have not</text>
  <text start="1018.2" dur="6.389">changed and will not change and and what</text>
  <text start="1022.31" dur="5.029">I find is really cool about being on the</text>
  <text start="1024.589" dur="5.131">right is that there are people who are</text>
  <text start="1027.339" dur="3.73">you know maybe we don&amp;#39;t agree on all</text>
  <text start="1029.72" dur="5.25">that stuff particularly when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1031.069" dur="6.931">say marriage but it&amp;#39;s fine like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1034.97" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s really fine like we can because you</text>
  <text start="1038" dur="6.72">know the way I look at it at this point</text>
  <text start="1039.23" dur="8.91">is we the gay community I feel has won</text>
  <text start="1044.72" dur="5.13">that battle I mean we marriage equality</text>
  <text start="1048.14" dur="3">is the law of the land it was over you</text>
  <text start="1049.85" dur="4.65">know that that was the decision by the</text>
  <text start="1051.14" dur="5.61">Supreme Court and it was never important</text>
  <text start="1054.5" dur="4.86">to me even in my liberal days I was</text>
  <text start="1056.75" dur="5.25">never a liberal who needed to fight for</text>
  <text start="1059.36" dur="5.01">everybody liking me or approving of me</text>
  <text start="1062" dur="4.33">or celebrating me I always just wanted</text>
  <text start="1064.37" dur="4.929">equality under the law that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="1066.33" dur="5.61">I used to say as long as I have the</text>
  <text start="1069.299" dur="4.681">legal right to go to City Hall and marry</text>
  <text start="1071.94" dur="4.38">the person I love I don&amp;#39;t care if</text>

  <text start="1232.33" dur="3.54">something saying we understand that a</text>
  <text start="1234.25" dur="4.11">lot of people are not going to like or</text>
  <text start="1235.87" dur="4.11">approve of our decision to go with this</text>
  <text start="1238.36" dur="4.56">but we really think it&amp;#39;s a more</text>

  <text start="1266.26" dur="4.8">us it was the word that we heard right</text>
  <text start="1268.54" dur="4.14">before a fist came flying at our face or</text>

  <text start="1272.68" dur="3.54">with people kicking us or hitting us</text>
  <text start="1274.27" dur="4.71">with a pole you know so it&amp;#39;s like I</text>
  <text start="1276.22" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t want to be called queer like I</text>
  <text start="1278.98" dur="5.28">would like to have a say in this as a</text>

  <text start="1334.9" dur="4.11">it now but I have to tell you it hurt me</text>
  <text start="1336.82" dur="4.85">so badly to hear that from people within</text>
  <text start="1339.01" dur="5.34">my own community and I thought to myself</text>
  <text start="1341.67" dur="5.74">I&amp;#39;m not even gonna fight this because I</text>
  <text start="1344.35" dur="5.28">thought for I fought for gay rights for</text>

  <text start="1367.39" dur="3.06">victims they perpetually need victims</text>
  <text start="1369.19" dur="3.81">and something that you realized</text>

  <text start="1640.93" dur="3.12">I was literally just putting everything</text>
  <text start="1642.1" dur="4.29">on my credit cards and I&amp;#39;m a guy who</text>
  <text start="1644.05" dur="4.77">lives week to week paycheck to paycheck</text>
  <text start="1646.39" dur="4.44">you know so I was literally you know</text>
  <text start="1648.82" dur="3.78">putting the cost of you know the website</text>
  <text start="1650.83" dur="3.96">and hiring a lawyer to trademark and</text>
  <text start="1652.6" dur="3.93">copyright things in which I&amp;#39;m so glad I</text>
  <text start="1654.79" dur="3.42">did because now I have a million</text>
  <text start="1656.53" dur="3.3">copycats who are springing up trying to</text>
  <text start="1658.21" dur="3.54">use my picture trying to use our</text>
  <text start="1659.83" dur="3.78">branding for walk away and say that</text>
  <text start="1661.75" dur="3.51">their walk away so I&amp;#39;m very glad I did</text>
  <text start="1663.61" dur="3.06">all of that but it&amp;#39;s like I was just</text>
  <text start="1665.26" dur="4.02">putting that stuff on my credit cards</text>
  <text start="1666.67" dur="3.75">and then I opened a GoFundMe and people</text>
  <text start="1669.28" dur="2.91">within the movement have made</text>
  <text start="1670.42" dur="2.76">contributions I have a patreon and a</text>
  <text start="1672.19" dur="2.91">GoFundMe and they&amp;#39;ve been very helpful</text>
  <text start="1673.18" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;ll talk about those real quick before</text>
  <text start="1675.1" dur="3.72">you go on to the next statement tell</text>
  <text start="1676.15" dur="4.65">people what they are sure um if you</text>
  <text start="1678.82" dur="3.63">actually if the easiest thing they could</text>
  <text start="1680.8" dur="3.12">do at this point is go to walk away</text>
  <text start="1682.45" dur="4.38">campaign com</text>
  <text start="1683.92" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s our website and eventually we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1686.83" dur="3.39">gonna try to move as much content from</text>
  <text start="1688.78" dur="3.81">Facebook which is where the campaign</text>
  <text start="1690.22" dur="3.99">currently resides and it will always be</text>
  <text start="1692.59" dur="3.24">there to some degree until the day that</text>
  <text start="1694.21" dur="4.8">Facebook shuts us down which is</text>
  <text start="1695.83" dur="4.83">inevitable but until that happens on the</text>
  <text start="1699.01" dur="4.5">majority of the activity will reside on</text>
  <text start="1700.66" dur="5.28">Facebook but we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1703.51" dur="4.41">to be transferring all of the content if</text>
  <text start="1705.94" dur="4.47">possible over to the website but on the</text>
  <text start="1707.92" dur="4.2">website there&amp;#39;s a tab called sponsorship</text>
  <text start="1710.41" dur="3.87">if you click on that you&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="1712.12" dur="4.02">multiple sponsorship options one of them</text>
  <text start="1714.28" dur="3.36">is a GoFundMe you just click on the</text>
  <text start="1716.14" dur="3.45">GoFundMe and you can make a one-time</text>
  <text start="1717.64" dur="5.1">donation and I mean literally if you can</text>
  <text start="1719.59" dur="5.46">contribute $5 it helps if you&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="1722.74" dur="4.05">do more than that it helps even more and</text>
  <text start="1725.05" dur="3.93">then there&amp;#39;s the patreon and for people</text>
  <text start="1726.79" dur="4.35">who aren&amp;#39;t familiar with patreon it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1728.98" dur="4.23">the same sort sort of thing it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1731.14" dur="3.24">a crowdfunding source</text>
  <text start="1733.21" dur="3.24">but what that is is a monthly</text>
  <text start="1734.38" dur="4.769">subscription so for people who are able</text>
  <text start="1736.45" dur="3.93">to donate five dollars a month you give</text>
  <text start="1739.149" dur="3.15">them your information and they&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="1740.38" dur="3.48">pull out five dollars once a month which</text>
  <text start="1742.299" dur="2.88">will go towards the campaign and then</text>
  <text start="1743.86" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s different options going clear up</text>
  <text start="1745.179" dur="3.12">to a thousand dollars a month if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1747.01" dur="5.399">somebody who&amp;#39;s in a position to be able</text>
  <text start="1748.299" dur="5.431">to be that helpful that&amp;#39;s amazing and so</text>
  <text start="1752.409" dur="2.581">I would really encourage people to help</text>
  <text start="1753.73" dur="3">us out because we don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="1754.99" dur="4.26">sponsorship at this point we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1756.73" dur="5.64">any major funding hopefully at some</text>
  <text start="1759.25" dur="5.97">point some Betty will come riding in on</text>
  <text start="1762.37" dur="5.07">a white horse with their purse or their</text>
  <text start="1765.22" dur="4.559">checkbook and they will say what do you</text>
  <text start="1767.44" dur="4.41">need to really blow this thing the roof</text>
  <text start="1769.779" dur="3.87">off of this thing when that happens what</text>
  <text start="1771.85" dur="3.689">I would ultimately like to do is create</text>
  <text start="1773.649" dur="3.721">kind of branches throughout the country</text>
  <text start="1775.539" dur="2.88">I would like to go around speaking on</text>
  <text start="1777.37" dur="4.47">college campuses</text>
  <text start="1778.419" dur="6.331">I would like to organize a speaking</text>
  <text start="1781.84" dur="4.319">circuit lectures throughout the country</text>
  <text start="1784.75" dur="4.409">and what I&amp;#39;d really like to do too is</text>
  <text start="1786.159" dur="5.601">produce amazing content and by that I</text>
  <text start="1789.159" dur="4.65">mean first of all I would love to do</text>
  <text start="1791.76" dur="5.44">almost like PSAs</text>
  <text start="1793.809" dur="6.09">of really great walkaway stories that we</text>
  <text start="1797.2" dur="5.55">can you know blast out even on</text>
  <text start="1799.899" dur="5.791">television if possible but what I really</text>
  <text start="1802.75" dur="9.08">want to do too is you know so much of my</text>
  <text start="1805.69" dur="9.45">red pill experience was um what was was</text>
  <text start="1811.83" dur="7.03">so much of my red pill experience</text>
  <text start="1815.14" dur="5.88">happened because I discovered how the</text>
  <text start="1818.86" dur="5.4">media was dishonest the ways in which</text>
  <text start="1821.02" dur="6.21">they spun stories and so I would like to</text>
  <text start="1824.26" dur="5.779">create kind of analytical content that</text>
  <text start="1827.23" dur="6.059">shows a story that say and as MSNBC or</text>
  <text start="1830.039" dur="4.99">CNN comes out with and shows this is</text>
  <text start="1833.289" dur="3.931">what they&amp;#39;re telling you but this is</text>
  <text start="1835.029" dur="4.65">what actually happened so that people</text>
  <text start="1837.22" dur="6.63">can start to become critical and</text>
  <text start="1839.679" dur="5.37">analytical we&amp;#39;re all reading I mean even</text>
  <text start="1843.85" dur="3.209">the pieces they&amp;#39;ve done on me and</text>
  <text start="1845.049" dur="3.421">they&amp;#39;re been every left-wing source</text>
  <text start="1847.059" dur="2.941">that&amp;#39;s come out about me is trying to</text>
  <text start="1848.47" dur="4.47">say that the walkway movement is Russian</text>
  <text start="1850" dur="4.799">thoughts yeah not what not one of these</text>
  <text start="1852.94" dur="3.69">sources has called me on the phone to</text>
  <text start="1854.799" dur="3.391">talk to me they haven&amp;#39;t contacted me in</text>
  <text start="1856.63" dur="3.09">any way shape or form and when they</text>
  <text start="1858.19" dur="3.839">write about the walkway campaign they</text>
  <text start="1859.72" dur="4.439">put lots of words in quotation marks and</text>
  <text start="1862.029" dur="3.451">so it&amp;#39;s like little things like that but</text>
  <text start="1864.159" dur="2.74">the average person isn&amp;#39;t paying</text>
  <text start="1865.48" dur="3.189">attention to but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1866.899" dur="3.72">little tells there&amp;#39;s a little you know</text>
  <text start="1868.669" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s little you know you can call</text>
  <text start="1870.619" dur="3.48">their bluff if you know what to look for</text>
  <text start="1872.419" dur="2.88">once you&amp;#39;re able to see what words</text>
  <text start="1874.099" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re using and the words they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1875.299" dur="4.29">putting into quotation marks then you</text>
  <text start="1877.159" dur="4.68">can see ah this is one of the bad guys</text>
  <text start="1879.589" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re not on my side they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1881.839" dur="4.56">trick me but it&amp;#39;s like and tell you what</text>
  <text start="1884.629" dur="3.66">once you see it you can&amp;#39;t unsee it but a</text>
  <text start="1886.399" dur="3.51">lot of people aren&amp;#39;t seeing it yet so</text>
  <text start="1888.289" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s like I would love to create content</text>
  <text start="1889.909" dur="5.1">that teaches people how to engage in</text>
  <text start="1892.879" dur="3.93">critical thinking when they&amp;#39;re reading</text>
  <text start="1895.009" dur="3.33">the news or watching the news I mean</text>
  <text start="1896.809" dur="4.23">these are critical steps to opening</text>
  <text start="1898.339" dur="4.71">people&amp;#39;s eyes I agree it&amp;#39;s like you just</text>
  <text start="1901.039" dur="3.48">mapped out my dream on a piece of you</text>

  <text start="1904.519" dur="3.561">is exactly oh it&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1906.589" dur="3.991">it&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m trying to do too I mean</text>
  <text start="1908.08" dur="3.909">one thing I think and I wonder what your</text>
  <text start="1910.58" dur="3.329">thoughts are on this</text>
  <text start="1911.989" dur="3.841">something grassroots like this something</text>
  <text start="1913.909" dur="5.73">organic like this is always so strong</text>
  <text start="1915.83" dur="5.909">and so so important when you talk about</text>
  <text start="1919.639" dur="4.47">someone coming in for funding if you</text>
  <text start="1921.739" dur="4.26">could like let&amp;#39;s say you have grassroots</text>
  <text start="1924.109" dur="3">fundraising coming in and then you have</text>
  <text start="1925.999" dur="3.6">someone coming in saying here&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="1945.049" dur="8.07">and I it feels pretty clear to me what</text>
  <text start="1949.7" dur="5.88">the implication of that would be I will</text>
  <text start="1953.119" dur="4.35">be I will entertain any offer from</text>
  <text start="1955.58" dur="4.38">anyone who comes to me and says look I</text>

  <text start="2509.63" dur="5.34">it grows so you know when it first once</text>
  <text start="2512.66" dur="4.349">upon a time when this all started I was</text>
  <text start="2514.97" dur="4.23">now I was running everything</text>
  <text start="2517.009" dur="4.29">I was the group moderator I was like</text>

  <text start="2521.299" dur="4.171">and press and something I was literally</text>
  <text start="2522.98" dur="5.46">a one-man band and when I was moderating</text>
  <text start="2525.47" dur="6.75">the group it was um it was growing by</text>
  <text start="2528.44" dur="4.29">about probably 400 people a day which</text>
  <text start="2532.22" dur="2.07">are</text>

  <text start="2540.62" dur="4.44">four thousand members this is incredible</text>
  <text start="2542.69" dur="6.03">yeah yeah and then it got to the point</text>
  <text start="2545.06" dur="6.96">where my my press inquiries were</text>
  <text start="2548.72" dur="5.73">becoming so much that I could no longer</text>
  <text start="2552.02" dur="4.53">handle moderating the group so I had to</text>
  <text start="2554.45" dur="5.36">take on a team of moderators and now at</text>
  <text start="2556.55" dur="5.88">this point the group is growing by</text>
  <text start="2559.81" dur="5.02">anywhere from five to ten thousand a day</text>
  <text start="2562.43" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;d say and we are last I checked we</text>

  <text start="2668.609" dur="3.24">gazillions of people but that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2669.869" dur="4.531">project in and of itself just managing</text>
  <text start="2671.849" dur="3.901">the volunteers and then I have one more</text>
  <text start="2674.4" dur="3.06">interesting question for you that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2689.76" dur="6.78">need more volunteers and I I would no</text>
  <text start="2693.54" dur="5.19">longer am able to handle that because as</text>

  <text start="2709.109" dur="6.541">moderator and she is fantastic which is</text>
  <text start="2713.22" dur="4.94">yet another reason why I am so anxious</text>
  <text start="2715.65" dur="5.28">to get some sort of significant</text>
  <text start="2718.16" dur="5.439">sponsorship because some of these people</text>
  <text start="2720.93" dur="4.35">need to move into paying roles and they</text>
  <text start="2723.599" dur="2.611">did this needs to be their job I mean</text>
  <text start="2725.28" dur="3.51">because they are literally working</text>
  <text start="2726.21" dur="6.06">full-time this is a foot I mean this is</text>
  <text start="2728.79" dur="5.85">like a startup and and they are managing</text>
  <text start="2732.27" dur="4.92">a start-up on a voluntary basis it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2734.64" dur="4.439">it&amp;#39;s thank god they have hearts of gold</text>
  <text start="2737.19" dur="3.33">and they keep telling me when the</text>
  <text start="2739.079" dur="3.02">funding comes the funding comes you</text>
  <text start="2740.52" dur="4.349">don&amp;#39;t worry about it I&amp;#39;m here for you I</text>
  <text start="2742.099" dur="5.74">don&amp;#39;t like people working that hard for</text>
  <text start="2744.869" dur="4.5">no money so we&amp;#39;ve got to get some</text>
  <text start="2747.839" dur="4.111">funding in place but for the time being</text>
  <text start="2749.369" dur="3.841">I do have a head moderator and then I</text>
  <text start="2751.95" dur="4.23">thought we&amp;#39;re kind of like a you know</text>

  <text start="2786.53" dur="3.88">so so you know if you want to be a</text>
  <text start="2789.15" dur="2.49">moderator and you reach out to her and</text>
  <text start="2790.41" dur="2.04">she doesn&amp;#39;t get back to you in nine</text>

  <text start="2818.059" dur="2.911">one thing I guess we can close out with</text>
  <text start="2819.68" dur="3.329">this comment even though I could talk to</text>
  <text start="2820.97" dur="4.2">you for like eight hours I know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2823.009" dur="4.411">very busy and that&amp;#39;s kind of where this</text>
  <text start="2825.17" dur="5.31">is going one thing that I&amp;#39;ve absolutely</text>
  <text start="2827.42" dur="5.099">loved about you from watching from afar</text>
  <text start="2830.48" dur="4.829">is that you&amp;#39;re here talking to little me</text>
  <text start="2832.519" dur="4.56">right I&amp;#39;m just little Tracy and you were</text>
  <text start="2835.309" dur="4.891">on laura ingraham like last week and you</text>
  <text start="2837.079" dur="5.04">were on all these big shows how are you</text>
  <text start="2840.2" dur="4.74">like I think it&amp;#39;s beautiful that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2842.119" dur="6.331">prioritizing you know small independence</text>
  <text start="2844.94" dur="6.149">as long as well as the bigger mainstream</text>
  <text start="2848.45" dur="4.44">media how are you managing that and what</text>
  <text start="2851.089" dur="3.98">are your thoughts about that and why did</text>
  <text start="2852.89" dur="7.35">you choose to keep doing it this way</text>
  <text start="2855.069" dur="6.911">well a number of reasons first of all</text>
  <text start="2860.24" dur="3.42">with first of all I would not refer to</text>
  <text start="2861.98" dur="4.049">you as little and I think that you&amp;#39;re I</text>
  <text start="2863.66" dur="6.99">totally think you&amp;#39;re a big deal again I</text>
  <text start="2866.029" dur="6.121">do know and and see I actually love</text>
  <text start="2870.65" dur="3.629">doing interviews with people like you</text>
  <text start="2872.15" dur="4.53">because we get to take a lot of time we</text>
  <text start="2874.279" dur="4.71">get to take a very relaxed pace and I</text>
  <text start="2876.68" dur="3.899">don&amp;#39;t have to feel like I have three</text>
  <text start="2878.989" dur="2.661">minutes to try to say everything that</text>
  <text start="2880.579" dur="3.48">needs to be said</text>
  <text start="2881.65" dur="5.379">doing something like say Fox is a</text>
  <text start="2884.059" dur="4.68">wonderful opportunity because they have</text>
  <text start="2887.029" dur="2.941">a banner on the screen that says my name</text>
  <text start="2888.739" dur="3.12">they have a banner on the screen that</text>
  <text start="2889.97" dur="6.089">says walk away campaign and they usually</text>
  <text start="2891.859" dur="6.75">have some sort of social media handle on</text>
  <text start="2896.059" dur="4.77">there and basically what I count on is</text>
  <text start="2898.609" dur="3.45">going on Fox and people getting on their</text>
  <text start="2900.829" dur="2.91">computers and looking up the</text>
  <text start="2902.059" dur="3.54">informations in the banner because the</text>
  <text start="2903.739" dur="3.661">truth is you go on Fox you get anywhere</text>
  <text start="2905.599" dur="3.24">from two to three minutes they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2907.4" dur="2.849">ask you questions that have nothing to</text>
  <text start="2908.839" dur="4.53">do with what you actually want to talk</text>
  <text start="2910.249" dur="4.74">about and about a big bada bing boom</text>
  <text start="2913.369" dur="3">you&amp;#39;re in you&amp;#39;re out and you&amp;#39;re like wow</text>
  <text start="2914.989" dur="3.84">I didn&amp;#39;t say a single thing that I</text>
  <text start="2916.369" dur="4.62">intended to say opportunities like this</text>
  <text start="2918.829" dur="3.96">I think are invaluable because I got to</text>
  <text start="2920.989" dur="3.75">say so many things to your listeners</text>
  <text start="2922.789" dur="3.931">many of whom I&amp;#39;m sure have never heard</text>
  <text start="2924.739" dur="3.451">of me now they have and now they know</text>
  <text start="2926.72" dur="3.21">more about me than they would know if</text>
  <text start="2928.19" dur="3.399">they caught me on fox or two minutes and</text>
  <text start="2929.93" dur="6.189">then the other</text>
  <text start="2931.589" dur="8.16">part of that answer is that I love being</text>
  <text start="2936.119" dur="5.22">in a position whatever that is because</text>
  <text start="2939.749" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s not like I don&amp;#39;t you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2941.339" dur="4.95">think I&amp;#39;m Madonna but you know I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="2943.739" dur="5.13">I right now somebody who some people</text>
  <text start="2946.289" dur="5.101">have heard of and I have maybe a maybe a</text>
  <text start="2948.869" dur="5.25">tiny bit of leverage I love being in a</text>
  <text start="2951.39" dur="5.79">position to help elevate other people</text>
  <text start="2954.119" dur="6.271">that I think just haven&amp;#39;t yet gotten</text>
  <text start="2957.18" dur="5.339">that break yeah and and I feel like I</text>
  <text start="2960.39" dur="5.099">have a really good intuition and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2962.519" dur="5.641">had people reach out to me who have</text>
  <text start="2965.489" dur="4.86">little pod paths or they have a radio</text>
  <text start="2968.16" dur="4.23">show that&amp;#39;s heard by a couple hundred</text>
  <text start="2970.349" dur="3.63">people but I think to myself this</text>
  <text start="2972.39" dur="3.54">person&amp;#39;s awesome because they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="2973.979" dur="3.6">passionate about walk away they took the</text>
  <text start="2975.93" dur="3.299">time to write to me this amazing letter</text>
  <text start="2977.579" dur="3.841">about what I&amp;#39;m doing and how much it</text>
  <text start="2979.229" dur="4.23">means to them and if me going on their</text>
  <text start="2981.42" dur="4.289">show is going to be a really big deal</text>
  <text start="2983.459" dur="4.59">that ends up like you know maybe a major</text>
  <text start="2985.709" dur="4.88">newspaper will put that radio show in</text>
  <text start="2988.049" dur="6.3">the news I want to help that person</text>
