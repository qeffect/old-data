  <text start="118.5" dur="3.6">like I&amp;#39;ve been saying during the past</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="4.14">couple videos that accountability is</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="4.83">right around the corner literally around</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="4.98">the corner we talked about in the</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="4.74">podcast and on this channel over the</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="3.78">past couple days that even though it</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="5.58">appears as though this</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="6.3">stuff is about to this stuff is about to</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="5.64">begin it likely has been going on for a</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="4.53">really long time and or we we were</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="3.72">pretty sure it&amp;#39;s been going on at least</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="4.53">for a year and now they&amp;#39;re able to have</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="4.2">the public cover to be able to roll</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="4.65">things out the way they want to roll</text>
  <text start="150.81" dur="5.19">them out so I&amp;#39;m going to do an analysis</text>

  <text start="160.02" dur="3.93">the points inside of here and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="4.26">definitely gonna come nearly certain</text>
  <text start="163.95" dur="4.14">that I&amp;#39;ll get a copyright strike on this</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="4.86">video and what does that mean that means</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="6.68">that Fox will take all of my ad revenue</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="6.63">but it also means that you need to</text>
  <text start="174.77" dur="5.29">retweet or tweet this out share it with</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="6.12">your friends share it on social media</text>

  <text start="206.76" dur="4.02">Schiff saying this congressman Adam</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="4.53">Schiff who spent two years knowingly and</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="4.17">unlawfully lying and leaking should be</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="3.75">forced to resign from Congress the</text>

  <text start="224.4" dur="4.619">is someday going to be hailed as a great</text>
  <text start="226.35" dur="5.72">American hero they tried to destroy that</text>
  <text start="229.019" dur="5.671">man because he spoke up for for good and</text>
  <text start="232.07" dur="4.6">just and all of the things that you have</text>
  <text start="234.69" dur="4.079">to speak up for but most people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="3.81">have the courage to do it he will be</text>
  <text start="238.769" dur="5.28">someday hailed as a great American hero</text>
  <text start="240.48" dur="4.83">what he did I would argue we are doing</text>
  <text start="244.049" dur="4.591">that right now and it should continue</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="4.92">because it&amp;#39;s absolutely true and join me</text>

  <text start="257.16" dur="5.1">taking a victory lap I know better than</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="4.68">anybody because we did this every Sunday</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="3.07">on my Sunday morning futures program on</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="3.729">Fox News how</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="6.209">came out for two years and said Maria</text>
  <text start="267.849" dur="5.94">this is not true this is a lie this is</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="4.831">what really happened and you educate our</text>
  <text start="273.789" dur="4.35">viewers so thank you for that well thank</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="3.78">you Maria it was really critical to have</text>
  <text start="278.139" dur="3.9">a show like yours because we could go on</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="3.569">on Sunday morning and we could really</text>
  <text start="282.039" dur="3.84">talk to the American people with a large</text>
  <text start="283.719" dur="3.66">audience and be able to stay on a long</text>
  <text start="285.879" dur="2.76">time and I think that made a big</text>
  <text start="287.379" dur="3.481">difference because we could get down</text>
  <text start="288.639" dur="4.891">into the details of what is now known as</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="4.679">Russia gate Fiasco but you&amp;#39;re right I</text>
  <text start="293.53" dur="5.16">mean we talked about this for many many</text>
  <text start="295.539" dur="5.97">well I guess dating back to about two</text>
  <text start="298.69" dur="7.08">years ago yeah I really really respect</text>
  <text start="301.509" dur="6.63">Devon Nunez you can totally see in my</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="6.209">opinion anyway that this he&amp;#39;s a good guy</text>
  <text start="308.139" dur="6.691">and he is being mercilessly attacked on</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="4.771">social media from those cow accounts and</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="6.959">all the trolls and it is it is really</text>
  <text start="316.75" dur="7.139">painful painful for me to say he really</text>
  <text start="321.789" dur="4.68">needs our support like I would recommend</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="6.12">sending a bouquet of flowers or like</text>
  <text start="326.469" dur="4.861">some sort of a present for everything</text>
  <text start="330.009" dur="4.141">that he&amp;#39;s going through and everything</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="4.649">he&amp;#39;s done so thanks for thanks for</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="3.15">making yourself available and your show</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="2.16">he played a big part and getting to the</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="2.31">bottom of all this</text>
  <text start="338.139" dur="2.971">but we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re not finished yet</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="3.45">though I think we have to remember that</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="3.479">I want to talk about that and you&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="4.289">reason and John Radcliffe is the reason</text>
  <text start="344.589" dur="4.89">that I was so sure of the story as well</text>
  <text start="347.349" dur="3.961">and why I was able to communicate to</text>
  <text start="349.479" dur="3.481">viewers that there is a much bigger</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="3.419">story in fact it&amp;#39;s the biggest scandal</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="3.84">of our time in terms of what the other</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="4.11">side was trying to do to a duly elected</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="3.959">president let&amp;#39;s talk about what happens</text>
  <text start="358.839" dur="3.241">next now congressman because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="360.759" dur="4.59">good op-ed today in the journal</text>
  <text start="362.08" dur="5.519">basically saying look if Muller did not</text>
  <text start="365.349" dur="3.72">look at the perpetrators you know if you</text>
  <text start="367.599" dur="3.361">don&amp;#39;t get to the perpetrators the fact</text>
  <text start="369.069" dur="4.291">that they started an investigation into</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="4.379">Donald Trump based on nothing based on</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="5.339">no predicate so where does this go now</text>
  <text start="375.339" dur="5.971">you are looking to make criminal</text>
  <text start="378.699" dur="4.801">referrals in the next week yeah so I</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="3.9">would start with this the mainstream</text>
  <text start="383.5" dur="3.479">media continues to ignore I would say</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="3.959">the people who have been on the Russia</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="5.881">Gate Fiasco for many more the entire</text>
  <text start="389.169" dur="5.521">time I think they&amp;#39;re listening but what</text>
  <text start="392.86" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;ve said my major concern now is is</text>
  <text start="394.69" dur="4.25">that the FBI and DOJ falsely claimed</text>
  <text start="397.18" dur="5.39">that this investigation didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.94" dur="5.91">again until late July we now know for</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="4.95">certain that that&amp;#39;s not true we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="4.44">trying to get to the bottom of that of</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="5.79">course there&amp;#39;s still documents that need</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="6.45">to come out but we are prepared and are</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="4.38">now drafting a criminal referral as I</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="4.35">think I said on your show a few weeks</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="4.56">ago we wanted to wait until the Moller</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="3.6">report came out so that we could just if</text>
  <text start="422.25" dur="4.8">there was anything in there that might</text>
  <text start="423.69" dur="6.09">be of interest but I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="5.16">prepared now to at least submit our our</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="4.29">first criminal referral we think it will</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="2.82">grab everybody that we need to grab to</text>
  <text start="434.07" dur="3.93">make sure that there&amp;#39;s a proper</text>
  <text start="435.03" dur="5.25">investigation done or at least it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438" dur="3.9">our referral over to DOJ we can&amp;#39;t force</text>
  <text start="440.28" dur="3.99">them to do an investigation but we think</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="4.41">we will give them the appropriate names</text>
  <text start="444.27" dur="4.35">and some of the crimes there may be more</text>
  <text start="446.31" dur="3.78">that have been committed and then after</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="3.81">we as we continue to get more</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="2.85">information as more information comes to</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="2.58">light</text>
  <text start="452.94" dur="4.26">we may have to supplement that down the</text>
  <text start="455.01" dur="5.19">road but but we think by in the end of</text>
  <text start="457.2" dur="3.96">next week we&amp;#39;ll have this out well so by</text>
  <text start="460.2" dur="3.74">the end of next week</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="6.48">Devon Nunez is going to provide a</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="7.08">criminal referral to the Department of</text>
  <text start="467.64" dur="6.029">Justice on who they think should be</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="4.27">prosecuted and for what crimes and we</text>
  <text start="473.669" dur="5.011">have to remember there they did this</text>
  <text start="475.29" dur="5.82">with Christopher Steele years ago - gosh</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s so weird saying gears let&amp;#39;s keep</text>
  <text start="481.11" dur="5.07">watching well why do you think people</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="5.07">missed this so so much let&amp;#39;s go back and</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="4.41">talk about what went on here congressman</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="4.95">because the FBI started investigating</text>
  <text start="490.59" dur="5.91">Donald Trump as early as the end of 2015</text>
  <text start="493.35" dur="5.18">right and into - 16 2016 they put</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="4.41">informants in there they really tried -</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="5.17">now this is important and I stopped it</text>
  <text start="500.91" dur="6.27">because as early as the end of 2015</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="5.79">floats and jives exactly with what I was</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="4.53">showing you guys in terms of the Nick</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="4.83">Falco discovery inside of the struct</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="5.16">page text messages about OCONUS lures</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="6.839">which then ties back into the Muller</text>
  <text start="516.87" dur="7.55">report quotes that William bar shows to</text>
  <text start="521.159" dur="5.971">include in his summary about multiple</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="4.69">characters or people affiliated with</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="4.28">Russia attempting to make contact with</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="5.13">Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="4.539">trip him up as much as they could as</text>
  <text start="534.24" dur="4.56">they were watching him connect with the</text>
  <text start="535.949" dur="5.76">American people that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s right I</text>
  <text start="538.8" dur="4.44">would say this about about you know what</text>
  <text start="541.709" dur="3.36">some of the biggest challenges that we</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="3.99">had is because they used our</text>
  <text start="545.069" dur="4.291">counterintelligence capabilities these</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="3.63">secret capabilities that are really only</text>
  <text start="549.36" dur="4.199">supposed to be used to go after</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="3.99">terrorists and other other bad guys they</text>
  <text start="553.559" dur="3.72">actually turned it on a political</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="5.669">campaign and that&amp;#39;s where they first</text>
  <text start="557.279" dur="5.04">went wrong now my estimation is they</text>
  <text start="560.519" dur="3.48">used what&amp;#39;s called counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="562.319" dur="4.471">because they could keep it</text>
  <text start="563.999" dur="4.801">siloed and hidden from the American</text>
  <text start="566.79" dur="3.93">people and from the rest of FBI and DOJ</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="4.019">that&amp;#39;s why they used the</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="4.349">counterintelligence they opened up a</text>
  <text start="572.819" dur="5.43">counterintelligence investigation into</text>
  <text start="575.069" dur="6.12">the Trump campaign because they can use</text>
  <text start="578.249" dur="4.44">these secret capabilities then of course</text>
  <text start="581.189" dur="3.181">we all know the story about how they</text>
  <text start="582.689" dur="4.681">went and they they went to the FISA</text>
  <text start="584.37" dur="5.969">Court they misled the FISA Court lied to</text>
  <text start="587.37" dur="5.129">the FISA Court in order to get a warrant</text>
  <text start="590.339" dur="3.901">on a trump campaign associate so that</text>
  <text start="592.499" dur="3.601">they then could get a bunch of emails</text>
  <text start="594.24" dur="3.899">and phone calls and records into the</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="4.82">campaign I&amp;#39;m really just really just</text>
  <text start="598.139" dur="6.961">unprecedented if you go back a year ago</text>
  <text start="600.92" dur="8.019">the the fact that that anyone over at</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="6.899">FBI our DOJ would think it&amp;#39;s okay to run</text>
  <text start="608.939" dur="6.111">one informant 20 informants whatever the</text>
  <text start="611.999" dur="4.731">number is into a political campaign</text>
  <text start="615.05" dur="4.99">under a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="5.979">investigation is out of their mind and</text>
  <text start="620.04" dur="4.739">it&amp;#39;s DOJ run amok yeah anyone who thinks</text>
  <text start="622.709" dur="5.011">that they can pay they can take US</text>
  <text start="624.779" dur="5.16">taxpayer dollars and pay people in the</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="5.609">campaign in order to get information oh</text>
  <text start="629.939" dur="7.471">it&amp;#39;s DOJ and FBI run amok that&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="633.329" dur="4.68">one that&amp;#39;s a new one let&amp;#39;s listen to</text>
  <text start="637.41" dur="2.969">that again</text>
  <text start="638.009" dur="5.341">Thanks that they can pay they can take</text>
  <text start="640.379" dur="4.981">US taxpayer dollars and pay people in</text>
  <text start="643.35" dur="6.839">the campaign in order to get information</text>
  <text start="645.36" dur="7.11">that&amp;#39;s DOJ and FBI run amok and copy it</text>
  <text start="650.189" dur="4.861">seems like they weren&amp;#39;t necessarily only</text>
  <text start="652.47" dur="5.52">placing spies inside the campaign but</text>
  <text start="655.05" dur="6.42">they were also paying people who were on</text>
  <text start="657.99" dur="5.69">the campaign to funnel information back</text>
  <text start="661.47" dur="5.58">to them</text>
  <text start="663.68" dur="4.26">hmm well that&amp;#39;s an interesting one isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.05" dur="3.54">it</text>
  <text start="667.94" dur="4.72">Congress should not tolerate it American</text>
  <text start="670.59" dur="4.05">people should not tolerate the Democrats</text>
  <text start="672.66" dur="4.8">should not tolerate it but in all of</text>
  <text start="674.64" dur="5.19">this the biggest culprit has been the</text>
  <text start="677.46" dur="5.13">mainstream media the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="679.83" dur="5.67">non-stop was reporting on this on this</text>
  <text start="682.59" dur="4.11">phony issue yeah taking garbage and they</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="3.84">were in on it from the beginning let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.7" dur="5.76">not forget there were many people in the</text>
  <text start="689.34" dur="4.5">media who were involved in this from the</text>
  <text start="692.46" dur="4.77">very beginning they were working</text>
  <text start="693.84" dur="5.61">directly with the Clinton Fusion GPS the</text>
  <text start="697.23" dur="4.59">Clinton campaign arm the dirty ops arm</text>
  <text start="699.45" dur="3.81">of the Clinton campaign many people in</text>
  <text start="701.82" dur="3.78">the media were working directly with</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="4.65">them they&amp;#39;ve known for a long time that</text>
  <text start="705.6" dur="4.64">that dossier existed and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="707.91" dur="4.53">no one you know none of the major media</text>
  <text start="710.24" dur="5.5">organizations would go with the dossier</text>
  <text start="712.44" dur="5.73">information because it was so salacious</text>
  <text start="715.74" dur="5.25">right now why do I say salacious because</text>
  <text start="718.17" dur="4.83">that was the former FBI directors term</text>
  <text start="720.99" dur="3.54">for it yeah he said Jim Comey said it</text>
  <text start="723" dur="2.28">was unverified and salacious that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.53" dur="3">absolutely right</text>
  <text start="725.28" dur="4.47">yeah so if you if you go back and look</text>
  <text start="727.53" dur="4.74">at so no predicate so we&amp;#39;re done area</text>
  <text start="729.75" dur="3.14">what to think of the most power I lost</text>
  <text start="732.27" dur="3.93">it</text>
  <text start="732.89" dur="4.99">long story short I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="736.2" dur="4.02">think that the reason why they didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="737.88" dur="4.62">with the dossier is because it was too</text>
  <text start="740.22" dur="4.83">salacious although it may have looked</text>
  <text start="742.5" dur="4.65">absolutely ridiculous published out the</text>
  <text start="745.05" dur="4.2">way BuzzFeed published it out I think</text>
  <text start="747.15" dur="5.52">there were a lot more agreements here</text>
  <text start="749.25" dur="5.88">for the journalists to drip this out</text>
  <text start="752.67" dur="4.89">over a period of time and sort of use it</text>
  <text start="755.13" dur="4.53">to continue to bolster the intelligence</text>
  <text start="757.56" dur="5.7">community to continue these</text>
  <text start="759.66" dur="6.63">investigations into trump by using the</text>
  <text start="763.26" dur="5.16">media so circular again circular so</text>
  <text start="766.29" dur="4.2">dripping evidence out there that is</text>
  <text start="768.42" dur="3.99">unsubstantiated using the media to give</text>
  <text start="770.49" dur="3.6">it another layer of credibility using</text>
  <text start="772.41" dur="3">another media outlet to add a little</text>
  <text start="774.09" dur="3.75">tidbit to it and give it some more</text>
  <text start="775.41" dur="5.31">credibility you hear it in hearings all</text>
  <text start="777.84" dur="4.92">the time in committee hearings or where</text>
  <text start="780.72" dur="2.4">anyone&amp;#39;s testifying in front of a</text>
  <text start="782.76" dur="3.18">committee</text>
  <text start="783.12" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;ll take like oh do you de New York</text>
  <text start="785.94" dur="5.01">Times report it on January 7th blah blah</text>
  <text start="789.03" dur="3.33">and this is what they said in this and</text>
  <text start="790.95" dur="5.8">it&amp;#39;s not sure I mean it&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="792.36" dur="5.89">reporting it&amp;#39;s gross</text>
  <text start="796.75" dur="3.839">he said it was unverified and salacious</text>
  <text start="798.25" dur="4.649">that&amp;#39;s absolutely right yeah so if you</text>
  <text start="800.589" dur="3.54">if you go back and look at this how is</text>
  <text start="802.899" dur="4.13">it possible you have something so</text>
  <text start="804.129" dur="6.661">salacious you have the most powerful</text>
  <text start="807.029" dur="4.75">investigative unit in the world which</text>
  <text start="810.79" dur="2.7">would be our counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="811.779" dur="4.531">capabilities with the Federal Bureau</text>
  <text start="813.49" dur="4.829">Bureau of Investigation and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="816.31" dur="3.029">telling me that you get a dossier you</text>
  <text start="818.319" dur="2.911">know and I&amp;#39;ve looked at lots of</text>
  <text start="819.339" dur="3.93">intelligence reports over the years when</text>
  <text start="821.23" dur="2.49">I first saw that dossier I mean what a</text>
  <text start="823.269" dur="1.86">joke</text>
  <text start="823.72" dur="2.58">nobody would believe that that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="825.129" dur="3.601">New York Times The Washington Post</text>
  <text start="826.3" dur="5.69">wouldn&amp;#39;t run that dossier yeah the</text>
  <text start="828.73" dur="7.169">Clinton the Clinton campaign dirt I</text>
  <text start="831.99" dur="8.11">watched were read that dossier for the</text>
  <text start="835.899" dur="7.261">first time and then I actually did a</text>
  <text start="840.1" dur="5.19">video debunking how I I debated the</text>
  <text start="843.16" dur="5.489">dossier versus the dossier and it</text>
  <text start="845.29" dur="5.039">actually debunks itself just standing it</text>
  <text start="848.649" dur="3.48">up next to one another that the</text>
  <text start="850.329" dur="5.041">contradictions within it are just really</text>
  <text start="852.129" dur="6.181">stunning that was one of the more</text>
  <text start="855.37" dur="6.42">exciting exercises I&amp;#39;ve ever done on the</text>
  <text start="858.31" dur="5.1">channel to be honest in my opinion let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="861.79" dur="3.93">get into Donald Trump&amp;#39;s interview and</text>
  <text start="863.41" dur="5.119">keep in the back of our head that we now</text>
  <text start="865.72" dur="5.729">know that it appears as though the</text>
  <text start="868.529" dur="5.05">intelligence community was paying people</text>
  <text start="871.449" dur="3.81">already on Team Trump for information</text>
  <text start="873.579" dur="3.151">and I just want to let you know too</text>
  <text start="875.259" dur="2.82">before I get into this I just did a</text>
  <text start="876.73" dur="3.089">threat I read through the nellie or</text>
  <text start="878.079" dur="4.23">testimony that was released today by</text>
  <text start="879.819" dur="5.101">Doug Collins inside of the nellie or</text>
  <text start="882.309" dur="7.02">testimony they asked her about the ham</text>
  <text start="884.92" dur="6.959">radio and she lies about the date she</text>
  <text start="889.329" dur="4.171">received that ham radio license and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="891.879" dur="2.971">link the thread in the description box</text>
  <text start="893.5" dur="5.309">below so that you guys can check it out</text>
  <text start="894.85" dur="6.029">on your own and off we go okay here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="898.809" dur="4.19">the first one minute into the interview</text>
  <text start="900.879" dur="5.76">he begins</text>
  <text start="902.999" dur="9.19">so Sean just went through a bunch about</text>
  <text start="906.639" dur="7.771">the FISA warrant well when I said there</text>
  <text start="912.189" dur="5.67">could be somebody spying on my campaign</text>
  <text start="914.41" dur="5.609">a lot of things happened it was like it</text>
  <text start="917.859" dur="3.66">went wild out there they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="920.019" dur="4.41">believe that I could say such a thing</text>
  <text start="921.519" dur="5.79">and as it turned out that was small</text>
  <text start="924.429" dur="4.801">potatoes compared to what went on when</text>
  <text start="927.309" dur="3.69">you look at what happened and when it</text>
  <text start="929.23" dur="3.87">happened and the money that was spent</text>
  <text start="930.999" dur="4.83">the millions and millions on the phony</text>
  <text start="933.1" dur="6.179">dossier and then they used the dossier</text>
  <text start="935.829" dur="6.271">to start things and there was no truth</text>
  <text start="939.279" dur="4.381">whatsoever was a fraud and paid for by</text>
  <text start="942.1" dur="4.709">Hillary Clinton and paid for by the</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="5.009">Democrats in the DNC it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="946.809" dur="3.87">believe if you wrote this as a novel</text>
  <text start="948.669" dur="3.121">nobody would buy it it would be a</text>
  <text start="950.679" dur="2.22">failure because it would be too</text>
  <text start="951.79" dur="3.329">unbelievable</text>
  <text start="952.899" dur="5.1">nobody would believe it&amp;#39;s possible the</text>
  <text start="955.119" dur="4.89">things that went on and we&amp;#39;re getting to</text>
  <text start="957.999" dur="4.5">the bottom of it and it&amp;#39;s got to be I</text>
  <text start="960.009" dur="4.86">mean you can never allow this to happen</text>
  <text start="962.499" dur="5.101">to another president this can never ever</text>
  <text start="964.869" dur="5.611">happen to a president again Sean that</text>
  <text start="967.6" dur="4.26">was a disgrace and an embarrassment to</text>
  <text start="970.48" dur="3.839">our country that they were allowed to</text>
  <text start="971.86" dur="4.519">get away with this and hopefully they</text>
  <text start="974.319" dur="5.01">won&amp;#39;t get away with it do you now feel</text>
  <text start="976.379" dur="4.75">okay so there&amp;#39;s the first time he talks</text>
  <text start="979.329" dur="4.62">about accountability three minutes and</text>
  <text start="981.129" dur="7.08">30 seconds into the interview he knows</text>
  <text start="983.949" dur="6.18">the story very well I was actually I</text>
  <text start="988.209" dur="4.71">never doubted that he knew the story</text>
  <text start="990.129" dur="6.841">very well obviously it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="992.919" dur="6">but his ability to explain what happened</text>
  <text start="996.97" dur="4.709">and for those of us like you and I who</text>
  <text start="998.919" dur="3.57">have been following this so closely for</text>
  <text start="1001.679" dur="4.14">years now</text>
  <text start="1002.489" dur="7.621">to hear him understand so so clearly the</text>
  <text start="1005.819" dur="5.49">intricacies of what happened I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="1010.11" dur="2.579">that&amp;#39;s wrong I don&amp;#39;t want anybody to</text>
  <text start="1011.309" dur="2.73">think I&amp;#39;m saying that he doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1012.689" dur="3.39">but for him to be able to communicate</text>
  <text start="1014.039" dur="4.53">the intricacies and and kind of give</text>
  <text start="1016.079" dur="4.95">like a reassurance that he understands</text>
  <text start="1018.569" dur="4.411">what went on and that he is going to</text>
  <text start="1021.029" dur="4.11">take care of it was great for me to hear</text>
  <text start="1022.98" dur="4.409">there were some details in here that I</text>
  <text start="1025.139" dur="3.991">just didn&amp;#39;t think that he not that I</text>
  <text start="1027.389" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t think he knew them but like you</text>
  <text start="1029.13" dur="4.649">know he&amp;#39;s the commander in chief and and</text>
  <text start="1031.199" dur="4.751">he&amp;#39;s very busy and you know I just</text>
  <text start="1033.779" dur="9.131">didn&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="1035.95" dur="9.42">regular he really got on this and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1042.91" dur="4.74">gotten very very granular that&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="1045.37" dur="3.66">sure in a second we&amp;#39;re gonna listen to</text>
  <text start="1047.65" dur="3.99">him talk about the absolute necessity</text>
  <text start="1049.03" dur="5.37">for a predicate crime to start an</text>
  <text start="1051.64" dur="5.73">investigation report I know you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1054.4" dur="4.71">called for obviously the whole Mahler</text>
  <text start="1057.37" dur="4.56">memo to be released did anything</text>
  <text start="1059.11" dur="4.41">surprise you and what about the people</text>
  <text start="1061.93" dur="5.76">that were collateral damage in all of</text>
  <text start="1063.52" dur="6.48">this well people were hurt so badly so</text>
  <text start="1067.69" dur="5.85">badly their lives have been ruined and</text>
  <text start="1070" dur="5.97">over you know over something that should</text>
  <text start="1073.54" dur="4.14">have never taken place an investigation</text>
  <text start="1075.97" dur="4.5">that should have never happened there</text>
  <text start="1077.68" dur="5.22">was no crime as you know you&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="1080.47" dur="3.99">allowed to do this legally if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1082.9" dur="5.07">crime there was no crime they&amp;#39;ve all</text>
  <text start="1084.46" dur="8.25">admitted it Comey who&amp;#39;s a terrible guy</text>
  <text start="1087.97" dur="8.15">Comey and mccabe and struck and Paige</text>
  <text start="1092.71" dur="6">the lover Paige and all of these people</text>
  <text start="1096.12" dur="3.46">they&amp;#39;ve admitted in testimony that there</text>
  <text start="1098.71" dur="2.97">was no crime</text>
  <text start="1099.58" dur="5.94">so they started an investigation based</text>
  <text start="1101.68" dur="6.72">on no crime I will say this our new</text>
  <text start="1105.52" dur="4.56">attorney general bill Barr is a is a</text>
  <text start="1108.4" dur="4.08">great gentleman and I&amp;#39;ve heard about him</text>
  <text start="1110.08" dur="4.41">for years he&amp;#39;s a great he&amp;#39;s a great man</text>
  <text start="1112.48" dur="3.75">had he been there initially this all</text>
  <text start="1114.49" dur="4.92">would it not have happened because I</text>
  <text start="1116.23" dur="5.64">think that everybody&amp;#39;s saying when he</text>
  <text start="1119.41" dur="4.2">says had he had been there originally</text>
  <text start="1121.87" dur="4.53">this all never would have happened there</text>
  <text start="1123.61" dur="4.5">that he&amp;#39;s talking about sessions but I</text>
  <text start="1126.4" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t believe that to be the case I</text>
  <text start="1128.11" dur="4.53">think that President Trump is saying if</text>
  <text start="1130.3" dur="4.44">bill Barr were there in Loretta Lynch&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1132.64" dur="3.66">place from the beginning that this</text>
  <text start="1134.74" dur="4.62">wouldn&amp;#39;t have ever happened because he</text>
  <text start="1136.3" dur="5.7">wouldn&amp;#39;t have allowed it what&amp;#39;s gone on</text>
  <text start="1139.36" dur="5.07">there is just a disgrace to our country</text>
  <text start="1142" dur="4.14">mr. president so but a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1144.43" dur="4.29">were a lot of innocent people were hurt</text>
  <text start="1146.14" dur="6.89">very badly and it&amp;#39;s very very sad</text>
  <text start="1148.72" dur="8.22">actually for this to never happen again</text>
  <text start="1153.03" dur="5.44">what do you think the path is to getting</text>
  <text start="1156.94" dur="3.39">to that point in other words the checks</text>

  <text start="2441.77" dur="5.07">so many things took place after that</text>
  <text start="2444.04" dur="5.68">incident that meeting between the</text>
  <text start="2446.84" dur="5.46">attorney general Lynch and Bill Clinton</text>

  <text start="2454.73" dur="4.44">many different things and it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="2456.859" dur="4.591">for our country that those things be</text>
  <text start="2459.17" dur="4.05">determined didn&amp;#39;t found out last</text>
  <text start="2461.45" dur="2.79">question about people none of it if you</text>
  <text start="2463.22" dur="4.43">don&amp;#39;t mind I want to ask you about</text>
  <text start="2464.24" dur="6.84">substantive issues these are subsidies</text>
  <text start="2467.65" dur="5.709">yeah the last two we know that clapper</text>
  <text start="2471.08" dur="4.14">lied under oath I believe the statute of</text>
  <text start="2473.359" dur="2.851">limitations though is passed and in the</text>
  <text start="2475.22" dur="2.879">case of Brennan</text>
  <text start="2476.21" dur="4.2">we know that they</text>
  <text start="2478.099" dur="4.351">was surveillance unmasking and leaking</text>
  <text start="2480.41" dur="4.459">raw intelligence an increase of three</text>

  <text start="2490.309" dur="4.95">mass she denies it but in that</text>
  <text start="2492.71" dur="6.409">particular case of Brennan and and</text>
  <text start="2495.259" dur="6.661">clapper and Brennan in particular</text>
  <text start="2499.119" dur="4.69">multiple Tyrion&amp;#39;s right and you of jus</text>
  <text start="2501.92" dur="4.349">brings up the tweets yeah</text>
  <text start="2503.809" dur="4.351">your reaction well I think Brendan&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2506.269" dur="3.24">sick person I really do I believe</text>
  <text start="2508.16" dur="3.209">there&amp;#39;s something wrong with them and I</text>
  <text start="2509.509" dur="5.34">watch for him to come out of the CIA and</text>
  <text start="2511.369" dur="5.551">act that way was so disrespectful to the</text>
  <text start="2514.849" dur="4.14">country and to the CIA and to the</text>
  <text start="2516.92" dur="4.109">position he held and he was not</text>
  <text start="2518.989" dur="4.74">considered good at what he did he was</text>
  <text start="2521.029" dur="5.401">never a respected guy tough guy but not</text>
  <text start="2523.729" dur="5.07">a respected guy but he lied to Congress</text>
  <text start="2526.43" dur="5.04">and the other night before the report</text>
  <text start="2528.799" dur="5.371">came out he predicted horrible things so</text>
  <text start="2531.47" dur="4.95">things he said were horrible and then</text>
  <text start="2534.17" dur="3.839">today I guess he said something I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2536.42" dur="5.56">see it but I heard he said well I must</text>
  <text start="2538.009" dur="7.781">had bad sources or bad information</text>
  <text start="2541.98" dur="6.119">I know this is a big deal because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2545.79" dur="3.96">Brennan admitting sorry about that</text>
  <text start="2548.099" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s basically Brennan admitting he</text>
  <text start="2549.75" dur="2.79">doesn&amp;#39;t have good intelligence anymore</text>
  <text start="2551.099" dur="4.531">but I&amp;#39;ve been focused on this like a</text>
  <text start="2552.54" dur="4.769">laser and it was so cool to hear Donald</text>
  <text start="2555.63" dur="4.02">Trump president Trump talk about that</text>
  <text start="2557.309" dur="5.071">yesterday I mean this is a man who</text>
  <text start="2559.65" dur="5.52">really is either sick or there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="2562.38" dur="6.09">other problem but the way he spoke and</text>
  <text start="2565.17" dur="5.25">as you know clapper lied and perhaps the</text>
  <text start="2568.47" dur="4.079">statute of limitations ran out on that</text>
  <text start="2570.42" dur="4.29">one but it didn&amp;#39;t run out on Comey it</text>
  <text start="2572.549" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t run out on Brennan or stroke or</text>
  <text start="2574.71" dur="5">page or McCabe I mean McCabe is</text>
  <text start="2577.319" dur="5.701">basically one last hundreds of thousands</text>
  <text start="2579.71" dur="7.06">Hollis he was running the FBI and and</text>
  <text start="2583.02" dur="5.7">running all sorts of cases and his wife</text>
  <text start="2586.77" dur="4.68">got hundreds of thousands of dollars</text>
  <text start="2588.72" dur="5.849">every potentially Clintons from</text>
  <text start="2591.45" dur="5.34">Clinton&amp;#39;s closest friend and then he</text>
  <text start="2594.569" dur="3.871">rules so favorably I mean he tries to</text>
  <text start="2596.79" dur="3.029">say that he wasn&amp;#39;t involved I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2598.44" dur="4.02">think too many people believe that I</text>
  <text start="2599.819" dur="5.581">don&amp;#39;t believe that but you know she got</text>
  <text start="2602.46" dur="5.099">all those good rulings it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2605.4" dur="5.04">a scandalous situation and it&amp;#39;s so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2607.559" dur="5.75">so badly that it reflects so horribly a</text>
  <text start="2610.44" dur="6.3">guy like or with his wife Nellie or and</text>
  <text start="2613.309" dur="5.321">GPS fusion she wrote the report and then</text>
  <text start="2616.74" dur="4.589">goes gives it to her husband who&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="2618.63" dur="5.489">the DOJ and that he goes and brings it</text>
  <text start="2621.329" dur="6.361">to the FBI and she&amp;#39;s getting paid for</text>
  <text start="2624.119" dur="6.72">doing it it&amp;#39;s incredible the things that</text>
  <text start="2627.69" dur="5.159">happened are incredible and very very</text>
  <text start="2630.839" dur="4.171">bad for our country I hope you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="2632.849" dur="4.921">I did we got to get to the bottom of it</text>
  <text start="2635.01" dur="4.92">because if we don&amp;#39;t and the media has</text>
  <text start="2637.77" dur="4.47">been no help the biggest abuse of power</text>
  <text start="2639.93" dur="4.2">scandal if I may move on or a couple if</text>
  <text start="2642.24" dur="4.74">I may move on to some some things about</text>
