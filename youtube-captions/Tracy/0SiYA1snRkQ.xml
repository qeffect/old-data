  <text start="174.69" dur="3.72">best of my recollection and has been</text>
  <text start="176.19" dur="3.48">corroborated by others we interacted on</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="3.21">several different occasions throughout</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="3.96">the planning cycle but it was during the</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="3.48">actual execution of the exercise that we</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="4.53">had an issue relevant to his recent</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="5.94">testimony as stated earlier Atlas vision</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="5.37">12 was conducted at JMTC in the vbs2</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="5.28">which is the virtual battle simulations</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="4.38">to classrooms for simulation ving men</text>
  <text start="196.32" dur="3.09">who was a major at the time was sitting</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="3.21">in on one of the classrooms talking to</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="3.36">the US and Russian Schultz soldiers as</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="4.71">well as the young officers and GS</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="5.61">employees about America Russia and Obama</text>
  <text start="205.83" dur="4.62">he was apologetic of American culture</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="4.47">laughed about Americans not being</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="4.71">educated or worldly and really talked up</text>
  <text start="212.85" dur="5.13">Obama and globalism to the point of</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="5.25">uncomfortable he would speak with the</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="4.92">Russian soldiers and laugh as if at the</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="4.32">expense of the US personnel it was so</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="3.42">uncomfortable and unprofessional one of</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="4.08">the GS employees came and told me</text>
  <text start="226.32" dur="4.2">everything above I walked over and sat</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="3.57">with an earshot of Inman and sure enough</text>
  <text start="230.52" dur="4.35">all was concerned confirmed</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="4.98">one comment truly struck me as odd and</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="4.44">it was with respect to Americans falsely</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="4.59">thinking they&amp;#39;re exceptional when he</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="5.16">said he meaning Obama is working on that</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="4.92">now and he said it with a snide I know a</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="4.05">secret look on his face I honestly don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="2.76">know what it meant it just sounded like</text>
  <text start="248.52" dur="3">an odd thing to say</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="3.6">regardless after hearing him bash</text>
  <text start="251.52" dur="3.96">America a few times in front of our</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="4.17">subordinates Russians and GS employees</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="4.5">as well as hearing an earful about</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="4.38">globalization Obama&amp;#39;s plan etc I&amp;#39;d had</text>
  <text start="259.98" dur="4.08">enough I tapped him on the shoulder and</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="4.47">asked him to step outside at that point</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="2.79">I verbally reprimanded him for his</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="1.92">actions</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="4.11">and I&amp;#39;ll leave it at that so as not to</text>
  <text start="268.17" dur="4.74">be unprofessional myself the bottom line</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="3.81">is lieutenant-colonel vin Minh was a</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="4.65">partisan Democrat at least as far back</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="4.83">as 2012 so much so junior officers and</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="3.87">soldiers felt uncomfortable around him</text>
  <text start="279.6" dur="3.72">this is not your professional field</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="3.48">grade officer who has the character and</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="3.69">integrity to do the right thing</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t let the uniform fool you he is a</text>
  <text start="287.01" dur="5.4">political activist in uniform I pray</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="4.38">this nation will drop our nation will</text>
  <text start="292.41" dur="3.62">drop this hate vitriol and division and</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="3.96">unite as our founding fathers intended</text>
  <text start="296.03" dur="3.79">he goes on to say I need to make a</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="3.63">slight correction on my statement it was</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="3.9">actually Atlas vision 13 when the</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="4.5">incident occurred I was thrown off as</text>
  <text start="303.72" dur="4.68">the next year Russia invaded Crimea also</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="5.85">I was promoted to chief regional joint</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="8.7">and combined exercises branch USA re you</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="6.99">are over many exercises so I had a few</text>
  <text start="317.1" dur="3.66">questions wanted to speak with him</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="3.18">reached out again via Twitter he</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="2.97">responded to me and said you know why</text>
  <text start="322.26" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t you send me about five questions</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="6.39">or so and I&amp;#39;ll do my best to answer them</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="4.2">for you so I did I asked him a bunch of</text>
  <text start="330.12" dur="3.81">questions I said was this the only</text>
  <text start="331.92" dur="4.11">incident you&amp;#39;d experienced with VIN Minh</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="3.66">and did it given his background make you</text>
  <text start="336.03" dur="4.44">doubt his oath and his loyalties to the</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="4.56">country did you see any signs that he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="2.94">been instructed to act in this way or</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="3.51">that he was at the direction of a</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="4.02">superior other than you because at the</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="4.5">time I had made a mistake with who was</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="4.23">his superior did you think about him at</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="3.72">all between then and when he made the</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="3.93">news this time and would he have needed</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="3.48">permission to wear his uniform to this</text>

  <text start="744.07" dur="3.72">honestly I haven&amp;#39;t thought about him at</text>

  <text start="765.55" dur="4.08">believe the vast majority of Americans</text>
  <text start="767.68" dur="4.14">perceived this the same way I did that</text>
  <text start="769.63" dur="4.83">it was a political statement with</text>
  <text start="771.82" dur="4.41">respect to your question on what is the</text>
  <text start="774.46" dur="4.23">normal procedure if you disagree with</text>
  <text start="776.23" dur="4.41">foreign policy or a direct order well as</text>
  <text start="778.69" dur="3.9">a staff officer which he essentially is</text>
  <text start="780.64" dur="4.77">your job is to plan coordinate and</text>

  <text start="787.72" dur="3.88">the commander remember the president</text>
  <text start="789.7" dur="3.55">sets foreign policy not Congress</text>
  <text start="791.6" dur="4.289">certainly not a lieutenant-colonel staff</text>

  <text start="807.11" dur="3.839">everything above is based on fact and is</text>
  <text start="809.149" dur="3.93">the truth your last question below is</text>
  <text start="810.949" dur="3.81">more opinion based and gets into some of</text>
  <text start="813.079" dur="3.901">my personal conservative views so it</text>
  <text start="814.759" dur="3.871">needs to be discussed separately I hope</text>
  <text start="816.98" dur="5.159">I&amp;#39;ve clarified everything for everyone</text>
  <text start="818.63" dur="5.25">on this your last question is indeed an</text>

  <text start="832.61" dur="4.38">Inquisition is unconstitutional and he</text>

  <text start="836.99" dur="3.45">he and his staff are up to their necks</text>
  <text start="838.79" dur="3.15">involved in setting the president up for</text>

  <text start="848" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s also lied to the American people</text>
  <text start="849.86" dur="3.57">and cause near irreparable damage to the</text>

  <text start="853.43" dur="4.32">investigation he lied about speaking to</text>
