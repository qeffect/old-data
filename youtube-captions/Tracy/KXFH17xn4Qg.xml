  <text start="11.07" dur="6.03">going to be very I don&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="15.48" dur="6.719">complicated but it&amp;#39;s gonna be in-depth</text>
  <text start="17.1" dur="7.679">um and I don&amp;#39;t necessarily like the</text>
  <text start="22.199" dur="6.361">conclusions that I&amp;#39;m coming to based off</text>
  <text start="24.779" dur="7.32">of these revelations that I&amp;#39;ve found</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="7.409">over the past few hours but I feel like</text>
  <text start="32.099" dur="7.501">this is necessary and nothing none of</text>
  <text start="35.969" dur="8.16">what I&amp;#39;m going to show you prove is</text>
  <text start="39.6" dur="8.58">anything I think it just raises a lot of</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="6.27">questions that need answers and maybe</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ll get some who knows the only way to</text>
  <text start="50.399" dur="5.491">do it is to ask the questions and</text>
  <text start="52.05" dur="6.87">hopefully people can respond and answer</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="7.41">them who knows right I&amp;#39;m gonna start out</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="8.519">with a little background first I have</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="7.05">done extensive work on Lucifer - with</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="5.671">Adam Carter leading the charge of course</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="4.29">I knew from the very beginning that this</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="3.81">gusoff or two thing well not the very</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="3.96">beginning but like you know after we</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.269">started dissecting the information and</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="3.48">more information started coming out and</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="5.04">then the whole establishment started</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="10.609">pinning their hat on gusoff or - being a</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="10.081">Russian hacker it&amp;#39;s a tangled web</text>
  <text start="92.689" dur="5.68">basically the information that I kusa</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="4.86">for - dropped was useless but it was</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.53">purported to be from within the Clinton</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="5.58">Foundation and and other things and he</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="5.161">took responsibility for he took</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="7.29">responsibility for giving information to</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="5.46">WikiLeaks about the DNC and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="113.04" dur="3.509">true</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.739">WikiLeaks has come out and denied that</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="3.841">well they don&amp;#39;t they never confirmed or</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="7.371">denied but they&amp;#39;ve said that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="6.66">you know provided to them in that way</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="4.75">now</text>
  <text start="127.05" dur="12.27">at one point WikiLeaks retweeted gusoff</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="10.23">or two&amp;#39;s dump of information but there</text>
  <text start="139.32" dur="3.87">were a lot of people that communicated</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="7.05">with gusoff or two via chat on twitter</text>
  <text start="143.19" dur="6.9">and one of them was Roger stone and it</text>
  <text start="147.66" dur="4.14">was a big deal because at the time they</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="3.42">were trying to pull Roger stone into</text>
  <text start="151.8" dur="4.26">Congress to testify about Russian</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="4.47">collusion now Roger stone advised the</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="4.59">Trump campaign for a little while in the</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="6.27">very beginning and then he stopped step</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="5.97">down Trump wooden Trump says he fired</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="4.35">him stone says he didn&amp;#39;t get fired</text>
  <text start="166.62" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re basically in a spat back and</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="6.63">forth and Roger stone becomes the</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="6.03">unofficial voice of the grassroots goes</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="3.75">on in four starts doing tons of work</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="2.61">within four starts giving insider</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="3.9">information</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="6.96">blah blah blah blah blah blah he never</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="8.19">said he he never said Roger stone never</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="7.17">said he had information about what was</text>
  <text start="191.07" dur="5.01">coming in WikiLeaks prior to he said he</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="5.34">had contacted an intermediary who also</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="7.29">contacted had contact with Julian</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="5.759">Assange and the two of them somehow you</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="4.47">know it was never a direct communication</text>
  <text start="204.989" dur="5.461">between Assange and Roger stone but</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="6.35">anyway that got to him into a lot of hot</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="6.24">water and then later on down the road he</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="6.1">showed everybody that he had spoken to</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="6.42">gusoff or to now at the time it was of</text>
  <text start="220.29" dur="5.4">almost the beginnings of Adam Carter who</text>
  <text start="223.11" dur="5.04">is at with integrity on Twitter should</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="4.14">follow him he&amp;#39;s amazing as it was at the</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="3.51">time that Adam Carter started doing his</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="4.11">friends at work in two goofs for two and</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="5.73">I started really covering that in-depth</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="5.76">showing that gusoff r2 was not a Russian</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="6.27">hacker as a matter of fact gusoff or two</text>
  <text start="239.7" dur="5.97">actually was from with inside the DNC</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="4.109">somewhere and they started proving that</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="3.84">stuff forensically and otherwise and</text>
  <text start="247.769" dur="3.601">filling you know kind of like poking</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="2.49">holes in the official story coming from</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="3.66">CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="252" dur="7.2">who by the way never let the FBI take a</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="5.829">look at the DNC servers right so when</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="3.79">that happen all this for</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="3.81">and when that happened they were trying</text>
  <text start="262.99" dur="3.209">to bring Roger stone up he said he was</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="3.27">t-boned he was poisoned</text>
  <text start="266.199" dur="4.081">bla bla bla well when I started</text>
  <text start="267.939" dur="5.361">realizing that gusoff er wasn&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="7.409">a real hacker from Romania Russia</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="7.57">whatever I reached out to Roger stone</text>
  <text start="277.689" dur="6.181">incessantly showing him this proof that</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="8.31">by the way VIPs and William Binney and</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="7.759">and them have now also started talking</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="4.609">about you know Benny meeting with Pompeo</text>
  <text start="291.629" dur="4.57">director of the CIA</text>
  <text start="293.789" dur="4.421">Pompeyo never having anything kind to</text>
  <text start="296.199" dur="4.381">say about WikiLeaks during his tenure a</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="3.509">CIA director what on that I think he</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="3.48">really believes half the stuff he says</text>
  <text start="301.719" dur="5.16">is a different story but anyway long</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="6.629">story short I was ignored for weeks of</text>
  <text start="306.879" dur="5.82">tweeting maniacally at Roger stone that</text>
  <text start="310.689" dur="3.72">gusoff or two was actually from within</text>
  <text start="312.699" dur="4.201">the DNC because I was coming at it from</text>
  <text start="314.409" dur="4.681">the perspective of look this will</text>
  <text start="316.9" dur="4.169">exonerate you completely end it will</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="4.71">exonerate the entire it will wipe out</text>
  <text start="321.069" dur="4.65">the entire Russia hack the election hoax</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="3.03">and this was months and months and</text>
  <text start="325.719" dur="3.991">months and months ago this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.83" dur="4.29">recently so finally he acknowledged it</text>
  <text start="329.71" dur="2.879">and I don&amp;#39;t remember exactly what he</text>
  <text start="331.12" dur="3">said but he just acknowledged it and I</text>
  <text start="332.589" dur="3.75">did a video immediately they are after</text>
  <text start="334.12" dur="5.13">because everybody that was tweeting its</text>
  <text start="336.339" dur="4.92">at Roger stone was finally I said you</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="3.599">know I said finally I&amp;#39;m beginning to</text>
  <text start="341.259" dur="4.981">start to think that you don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="342.849" dur="7.081">information because you&amp;#39;re ignoring it</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="5.699">consistently and then he acknowledged it</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="5.94">and Plus see he was being barraged by</text>
  <text start="351.939" dur="5.521">tweets now why is all that important</text>
  <text start="355.87" dur="5.28">well it really struck me as odd at the</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="5.25">time why wouldn&amp;#39;t Roger stone take a</text>
  <text start="361.15" dur="4.109">look at the information that I was</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="5.759">providing that would completely bolster</text>
  <text start="365.259" dur="5.58">his case bolster Trump&amp;#39;s case bolster</text>
  <text start="368.469" dur="6.151">everything he&amp;#39;s got a big audience he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.839" dur="5.64">got a loud voice and and and he just had</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="4.079">to look at this stuff to see this is not</text>
  <text start="376.479" dur="4.981">this wasn&amp;#39;t you know this wasn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="378.699" dur="6.27">hearsay evidence this was like forensic</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="7.35">evidence that proved it and he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.969" dur="6.69">and ever since then I&amp;#39;ve just kind of</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="5.55">been a little shady and I know his</text>
  <text start="391.659" dur="4.591">background and his history and I know</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="4.109">that he&amp;#39;s flamboyant he likes to brag</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="5.58">and you know he&amp;#39;s been he was</text>

  <text start="420.37" dur="3.75">like nothing like thousand votes or</text>
  <text start="422.05" dur="3.839">something and libertarians deserve</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="3.509">ballot access in New York so it was just</text>
  <text start="425.889" dur="6.06">frustrating anyway I put all that stuff</text>
