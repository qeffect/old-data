  <text start="141.27" dur="6.06">apparently or allegedly coming out on</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="5.7">Friday right Maria Bartiromo said that</text>
  <text start="147.33" dur="3.3">this would be released and so I touched</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="2.91">on this for a good segment on the</text>
  <text start="150.63" dur="6.63">podcast today they know a little bit of</text>
  <text start="152.01" dur="7.68">detail too but I want to I want to get</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="5.1">into some intricacies here with you guys</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="5.13">and I know I&amp;#39;m triggering everyone out</text>
  <text start="162.36" dur="4.92">there you guys you guys I want to get</text>
  <text start="164.82" dur="6.15">into some details with this and it all</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="6.42">goes back to just understanding why it</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="6.51">is that they needed to get the FISA</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="7.289">warrant on Carter page to be able to</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="5.49">continue what they do and so I wanted to</text>
  <text start="180.989" dur="3.691">just do a brief overview of how that</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="3.989">happened and show you some work that</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;ve done over the past year to give</text>
  <text start="186.959" dur="5.461">everybody a kind of refresher course on</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="4.38">how we got here before we get to Friday</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="4.92">now obviously it would be impossible to</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="5.18">do that for the whole story but this</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="5.88">little piece will probably help folks so</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="5.95">the Department of Justice IG announced</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="6.75">on March 28th 2018 that they were</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="6.84">beginning this FISA review and here we</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="5.28">see the letter for immediate release</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="4.32">that IG Horowitz announced that in</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="3.84">response to requests from the AG in</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="4.2">Congress the Office of Inspector General</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="3.929">will initiate a review that will examine</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="3.929">the Justice Department and FBI is</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="5.28">compliance with legal requirements and</text>
  <text start="225.209" dur="5.551">with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="4.651">procedures in applications filed with</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="4.82">the u.s. flight FISC the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="6.599">relating to a certain u.s. person as</text>
  <text start="235.58" dur="5.89">part of the exam the IG will also review</text>
  <text start="239.549" dur="3.69">information that was known to the DOJ in</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="5.489">the FBI at the time the applications</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="7.891">were filed from or about an alleged FBI</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="8.041">confidential source which is Christopher</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="6.24">Steele additionally the IG will review</text>
  <text start="255" dur="4.109">the DOJ and FBI&amp;#39;s relationship and</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="5.39">communications with the alleged source</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="6.751">as she as they relate to the Fisk epic</text>
  <text start="262.76" dur="4.93">applications if circumstances warrant</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="3.48">the IG will consider</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="5.04">including other issues that may arise</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="4.59">during the course of the review that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.73" dur="4.5">how it all started</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="5.1">so the IG begins the work goes through</text>
  <text start="277.23" dur="3.72">the process begins the process is</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="3.45">talking to FBI is talking and</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="3.12">interviewing to whoever they can and</text>
  <text start="282.48" dur="4.53">again just to give you guys a</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="5.13">distinction the IG does not have</text>
  <text start="287.01" dur="4.71">prosecutorial power which means they</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="4.32">cannot arrest anyone they can&amp;#39;t force</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="4.26">anyone to testify outside of the</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="4.59">government they can refer for prefer</text>
  <text start="295.98" dur="5.76">criminal prosecution they can work</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="7.26">parallel to US Attorney and things of</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="6.69">that nature excuse me</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="4.8">so this is where it started but if you</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="5.82">go back a couple years you&amp;#39;ll remember</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="6.93">that in 2017 in April there was a report</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="6.06">that came out from the FISA Court an</text>
  <text start="317.1" dur="7.08">opinion that there was widespread abuse</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="6.12">of the 702 database and the 702 database</text>
  <text start="324.18" dur="5.01">is a database where you can query</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="4.62">through the NSA to get all kinds of</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="4.11">information on anybody that you put your</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="6.72">name in there for one of the things that</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="8.09">we suspect may have been a result of the</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="5.51">NSA queries was the information in</text>
  <text start="341.39" dur="5.02">Christopher Steele&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="5.11">dossier that said that Michael Cohen had</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="3.63">gone to Prague because if somebody was</text>
  <text start="348.39" dur="3.9">querying this database with the name</text>
  <text start="350.04" dur="4.14">Michael Cohen and saw that there was a</text>
  <text start="352.29" dur="4.32">Michael Cohen that had gone to Prague</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="4.83">they would just assume that it was that</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="3.93">Michael Cohen big mistake passed that</text>
  <text start="359.01" dur="3.24">information along and then Christopher</text>
  <text start="360.54" dur="3.83">Steele includes it in the dossier and</text>
  <text start="362.25" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s Michael Cohen and brog</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="7.06">unfortunately for them unfortunately for</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="5.58">them Christopher Steele was wrong and he</text>
  <text start="371.43" dur="4.68">Michael Cohen never went to Prague or if</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;ve been with me for a very long time</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="5.75">Prague I&amp;#39;m gonna take a sip of tea hold</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="2.15">on</text>
  <text start="383.88" dur="9.01">so the 702 Derick database is very very</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="5.7">powerful so initially this is how it is</text>
  <text start="392.89" dur="5.43">alleged and we&amp;#39;ll find out a lot more</text>
  <text start="394.51" dur="6.24">that the information was being farmed</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="4.65">for this illegal spying operation</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="3.57">against a candidate for president in the</text>
  <text start="402.97" dur="4.08">United States of America</text>
  <text start="404.32" dur="5.46">and then once Admiral Mike Rogers</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="5.16">realized that there was this abuse going</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="4.68">on he waved the red flag and said hold</text>
  <text start="412.21" dur="3.15">on a second he was a whistleblower you</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="4.76">want to talk about freakin</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="8.16">whistleblowers he was a whistleblower so</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="7.3">one of the things that stopped then was</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="5.58">there he halted all 702 queries so none</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="6.3">of these contractors the FBI nobody</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="6.27">could use the database to do any queries</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="4.65">or anything and when that happened if</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="4.41">there was an escalation it went to</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="4.53">review the FISA Court looked it over and</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;ve noticed over the past couple of</text>
  <text start="442" dur="4.11">weeks you&amp;#39;ve seen reports coming out in</text>
  <text start="444.19" dur="4.35">the news as though it&amp;#39;s knew that there</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="5.34">was this expose of you know what</text>
  <text start="448.54" dur="4.62">happened and what was being abused from</text>
  <text start="451.45" dur="5.67">the FISA Court well that actually came</text>
  <text start="453.16" dur="7.89">out on in April of 2017 that report it</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="5.82">was paid hundreds of pages long so this</text>
  <text start="461.05" dur="4.68">stuff coming out now as though it&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="4.32">news is not a negative thing it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="465.73" dur="3.81">positive thing because most people</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="5.31">aren&amp;#39;t aware of this report from 2017</text>
  <text start="469.54" dur="6.99">and off we go</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="5.22">so in January of this year probably I</text>
  <text start="476.53" dur="4.05">guess it would be about eight months</text>
  <text start="477.79" dur="4.65">seven or eight months after oh I G</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="5.19">Horowitz has been in depth doing his</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="5.97">review we got a summary report that came</text>
  <text start="485.77" dur="5.57">out and what a summary report is</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="6.6">basically just a one pager that explains</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="5.95">something that the IG has found and a</text>
  <text start="495.01" dur="3.72">conclusion without the big beefy report</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="4.08">behind it like we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="498.73" dur="4.35">hopefully this Friday so what that means</text>
  <text start="501.37" dur="3.57">is they write a one-pager</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="4.14">these are typically the reports that you</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="4.17">see the IG release where it says the</text>
  <text start="507.22" dur="4.59">Justice Department declined to prosecute</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="4.74">and we all get collectively outraged</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="4.35">over the fact that we&amp;#39;ve got leakers and</text>
  <text start="513.85" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;ve got people accepting bribes and it</text>
  <text start="516.16" dur="3.119">doesn&amp;#39;t seem as though any</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="7.23">held accountable usually the last line</text>
  <text start="519.279" dur="7.201">of those says usually the last sign says</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="4.88">that this matter was referred to the DOJ</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="5.97">for criminal prosecution and the DOJ</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="5.56">declined to prosecute right well we got</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="5.79">a summary report and I wrote a piece on</text>
  <text start="534.73" dur="5.67">this January 31st 2019 this was what the</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="3.69">summary report said and I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="540.4" dur="3.27">over it again because I feel like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="4.53">super poignant and leading up to Friday</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="5.88">okay it said this this was released</text>
  <text start="546.46" dur="5.19">again on January 29th 2019 confused the</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="4.52">heck out of a whole lot of people very</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="5.33">very very confusing report but it says</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="5.5">the DOJ Office of Inspector General</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="4.54">initiated this investigation upon the</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="3.74">receipt of information from the FBI</text>
  <text start="561.52" dur="5.91">concerning multiple allegations</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="8.14">involving an FBI contractor and three</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="7.86">FBI officials so this is an a contractor</text>
  <text start="571.45" dur="12.27">brought on by the FBI who was found to</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="10.56">be in cut in in invalid Oh in violation</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="6.69">of the rules that are put in place for</text>
  <text start="585.85" dur="6.93">this so it says the OIG found that as a</text>
  <text start="590.41" dur="5.429">result of conduct at the time by two</text>
  <text start="592.78" dur="6.93">current senior FBI officials and one</text>
  <text start="595.839" dur="6.901">retired FBI official the FBI contractor</text>
  <text start="599.71" dur="5.31">engaged in certain inherent governmental</text>
  <text start="602.74" dur="5.48">activities in contravention of the</text>
  <text start="605.02" dur="5.76">Federal Acquisition regulations far</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="4.869">additionally the OIG found that these</text>
  <text start="610.78" dur="5.84">three FBI officials did not adhere to</text>
  <text start="613.089" dur="6.601">OMB policy while managing the contractor</text>
  <text start="616.62" dur="5.38">further the OIG found that the FBI</text>
  <text start="619.69" dur="4.5">contractor failed to adhere to personal</text>
  <text start="622" dur="4.92">conflict of interest rules under the far</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="6.03">now nobody really understood this stuff</text>
  <text start="626.92" dur="3.57">so I and and I didn&amp;#39;t understand it</text>
  <text start="630.22" dur="2.67">either</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="4.71">I spend a lot of time researching what</text>
  <text start="632.89" dur="4.23">are the Federal Acquisition regulations</text>
  <text start="635.2" dur="3.96">what is an inherent governmental</text>
  <text start="637.12" dur="4.14">activity and I was able to come up with</text>
  <text start="639.16" dur="3.96">a whole bunch of information and kind of</text>
  <text start="641.26" dur="3.6">put a story together and I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="643.12" dur="4.5">through the article that I did back then</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="4.99">which is on uncovered DC comm from</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="4.78">January 31st of 2019</text>
  <text start="649.85" dur="5">I wanted to give a special thank you to</text>
  <text start="652.4" dur="7.32">Jeff Carlson who has done absolutely</text>
  <text start="654.85" dur="8.89">stunning work on the 702 database abuse</text>
  <text start="659.72" dur="5.97">the fights that abuse etc and I also</text>
  <text start="663.74" dur="4.32">made a correction so I had updated the</text>
  <text start="665.69" dur="6.87">article to let everyone know that I had</text>
  <text start="668.06" dur="6.27">made a direct correction so we know that</text>
  <text start="672.56" dur="3.9">the Office of Inspector General is</text>

  <text start="681.77" dur="4.23">during the course of that investigation</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="4.41">there were inconsistencies during tests</text>
  <text start="686" dur="4.23">and testimony therefore many employees</text>
  <text start="688.01" dur="4.14">and that&amp;#39;s what led them to actually</text>
  <text start="690.23" dur="4.08">investigate Andrew McCabe for leaks to</text>

  <text start="701.6" dur="4.05">that time I believe that that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="703.88" dur="5.49">happened here as well that the IG was</text>

  <text start="777.35" dur="4.62">this royal FISA data is probably the</text>
  <text start="779.87" dur="3.76">event that precipitated Admiral Rogers</text>

  <text start="813.57" dur="4.71">retiring so here&amp;#39;s a little timeline</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about on October 15</text>
  <text start="818.28" dur="7.62">2016 Georgia Carlin formerly formerly</text>

  <text start="830.64" dur="5.76">Audient had on the audience idiot the</text>
  <text start="834.03" dur="3.99">audit had uncovered numerous about query</text>
  <text start="836.4" dur="6.21">violations and this came from Senate</text>
  <text start="838.02" dur="7.59">testimony on October 21st 2016 Rogers</text>
  <text start="842.61" dur="6.42">shut down all about query activity he</text>
  <text start="845.61" dur="7.53">reported his findings to the DOJ on</text>
  <text start="849.03" dur="7.71">October 21st that same day the DOJ and</text>
  <text start="853.14" dur="6.42">FBI seek and receive a title one FISA</text>

  <text start="859.56" dur="4.65">electronic surveillance on Carter page</text>
  <text start="861.54" dur="5.25">from the FISA Court at this point in</text>
  <text start="864.21" dur="5.79">time the court is unaware that there</text>
  <text start="866.79" dur="6.42">were any violations so Admiral Rogers</text>
  <text start="870" dur="5.25">halts the 702 about queries people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="873.21" dur="5.22">get there in dirty information anymore</text>
  <text start="875.25" dur="5.81">what do they do that very same day they</text>
  <text start="878.43" dur="7.59">put in a FISA warrant application and</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="11.11">they receive the title one FISA probable</text>
  <text start="886.02" dur="9.12">cause order taking another sip of tea so</text>
  <text start="892.17" dur="5.31">then I started thinking who in the heck</text>
  <text start="895.14" dur="3.84">could the contractor be well who&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="5.16">first contractor that you could come in</text>
  <text start="898.98" dur="6.66">it Fusion GPS right I listen I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="902.64" dur="4.71">have the proof of this like hard</text>
  <text start="905.64" dur="4.23">evidence there&amp;#39;s not been the documents</text>
  <text start="907.35" dur="4.47">released yet we haven&amp;#39;t personally seen</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="3.78">the bank accounts but I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="911.82" dur="3.78">explain how I have come to this</text>
  <text start="913.65" dur="3.69">conclusion and why I think that this</text>
  <text start="915.6" dur="4.71">government contractor or at least</text>
  <text start="917.34" dur="6.72">one of them that was abusing the 702</text>
  <text start="920.31" dur="6.66">database was fusion GPS running nellie</text>
  <text start="924.06" dur="5.73">or running Christopher steel Glenn</text>

  <text start="933.6" dur="5.22">know I would I would suggest you pick it</text>
  <text start="935.25" dur="6.21">up it&amp;#39;s really interesting so although</text>
  <text start="938.82" dur="5.1">it hasn&amp;#39;t been publicly reported yet it</text>
  <text start="941.46" dur="4.35">has long been speculated that fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="943.92" dur="4.59">was a government contractor there was</text>
  <text start="945.81" dur="5.34">significant legal pushback from fusion</text>

  <text start="951.15" dur="5.64">House Intelligence Committee I believe</text>
  <text start="954.18" dur="5.1">it was the chair which subpoenaed the</text>
  <text start="956.79" dur="5.07">bank records of fusion GPS to take a</text>
  <text start="959.28" dur="6.69">look at them after a decision on January</text>
  <text start="961.86" dur="6.63">4th 2018 judge lyon who was a one of the</text>
  <text start="965.97" dur="4.68">friendlies ruled that fusions bank has</text>

  <text start="970.65" dur="2.94">were subpoenaed by the House</text>
  <text start="971.58" dur="5.76">Intelligence Committee in the fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="973.59" dur="6.03">debacle and they were provided steel was</text>
  <text start="977.34" dur="4.17">a paid contractor with fusion GPS was</text>
  <text start="979.62" dur="4.65">also a paid confidential informant for</text>
  <text start="981.51" dur="4.77">the FBI we have gone over multiple times</text>
  <text start="984.27" dur="3.72">on this channel how would they thought</text>
  <text start="986.28" dur="4.11">that Christopher Steele was going to be</text>
  <text start="987.99" dur="4.61">in a Christopher steel thought he was</text>
  <text start="990.39" dur="5.7">going to be an employee of the FBI</text>
  <text start="992.6" dur="6.94">that&amp;#39;s after all of this in the Judicial</text>
  <text start="996.09" dur="6.29">Watch release of the 302 us we saw that</text>
  <text start="999.54" dur="5.22">and we also learned that Nellie or</text>
  <text start="1002.38" dur="5.14">handed her husband a thumb drive with</text>
  <text start="1004.76" dur="5.22">her research so that he could provide it</text>
  <text start="1007.52" dur="3.99">to the FBI and that&amp;#39;s why I think the</text>
  <text start="1009.98" dur="3.78">conflict of interest comes in because</text>
  <text start="1011.51" dur="5.04">Nellie or in addition to working for the</text>
  <text start="1013.76" dur="5.31">CIA was also working for fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="1016.55" dur="4.58">while her husband Bruce or who was</text>
  <text start="1019.07" dur="4.2">Christopher Steele&amp;#39;s handler was</text>
  <text start="1021.13" dur="4.72">funneling the information she provided</text>
  <text start="1023.27" dur="5.64">him into the FBI as an independent</text>
  <text start="1025.85" dur="5.4">stream on top of the multiple other ways</text>
  <text start="1028.91" dur="6.92">that this information was being loitered</text>
  <text start="1031.25" dur="4.58">into the FBI</text>
  <text start="1038.01" dur="8.5">sorry I was coughing so that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="1042.82" dur="5.76">think that there was this further the</text>
  <text start="1046.51" dur="3.48">OIG found that the FBI contractor failed</text>
  <text start="1048.58" dur="3.51">to adhere to personal conflict of</text>
  <text start="1049.99" dur="5.91">interest rules I think that that was</text>
  <text start="1052.09" dur="5.58">Nelly or who are the FBI employees I</text>
  <text start="1055.9" dur="4.19">don&amp;#39;t want to speculate on that anymore</text>
  <text start="1057.67" dur="5.07">because I&amp;#39;m not really sure I had my</text>
  <text start="1060.09" dur="4.72">speculation in here it was met with</text>
  <text start="1062.74" dur="5.37">mixed reviews I really don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="1064.81" dur="7.47">I&amp;#39;m right but this is literally just my</text>
  <text start="1068.11" dur="5.52">speculative thought of who it could be</text>
  <text start="1072.28" dur="7.19">I thought maybe it could be Andrew</text>
  <text start="1073.63" dur="9.63">McCabe I don&amp;#39;t know I I don&amp;#39;t know so I</text>
  <text start="1079.47" dur="6.51">didn&amp;#39;t stop there one of the other</text>
  <text start="1083.26" dur="6.63">things that confirms this for me was a</text>
  <text start="1085.98" dur="5.74">if you go to pacer and you look back at</text>
  <text start="1089.89" dur="3.72">the testimony and stuff in these court</text>
  <text start="1091.72" dur="3.96">hearings after a certain amount of time</text>
  <text start="1093.61" dur="5.22">the transcripts are available on pacer</text>
  <text start="1095.68" dur="4.38">for you to read and can anyone hear me I</text>
  <text start="1098.83" dur="4.32">just want to check because people are</text>
  <text start="1100.06" dur="7.64">saying the audios not working just hit a</text>
  <text start="1103.15" dur="4.55">one if you can hear me okay real quick</text>
  <text start="1111.48" dur="6.55">hit a one if you can hear me</text>
  <text start="1114.6" dur="7.63">sorry to pause the video for this okay</text>
  <text start="1118.03" dur="7.89">very good okay good</text>
  <text start="1122.23" dur="6.39">sorry guys about that so I kept digging</text>
  <text start="1125.92" dur="5.13">and on February 11th about a week later</text>
  <text start="1128.62" dur="5.79">I was able to take a look at a</text>
  <text start="1131.05" dur="7.53">transcript from the here the court</text>
  <text start="1134.41" dur="5.64">hearing where the OIG I&amp;#39;m sorry the</text>

  <text start="1152.47" dur="3.39">they subpoenaed bank records fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="1154.39" dur="4.53">did not want to provide the bank records</text>
  <text start="1155.86" dur="4.62">and fusion GPS was making the argument</text>
  <text start="1158.92" dur="4.26">that if you all you want to see is how</text>
  <text start="1160.48" dur="5.07">much we paid Christopher steel then I</text>
  <text start="1163.18" dur="4.17">will present you you know the</text>
  <text start="1165.55" dur="3.3">Christopher steel portions of our bank</text>
  <text start="1167.35" dur="3.63">records but there&amp;#39;s no reason for you to</text>
  <text start="1168.85" dur="3.84">see the rest what was interesting</text>
  <text start="1170.98" dur="6.29">in there though is that there was more</text>
  <text start="1172.69" dur="6.75">and what the government said was</text>
  <text start="1177.27" dur="7.12">substantial I&amp;#39;m gonna try and zoom this</text>
  <text start="1179.44" dur="6.93">in I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys can see this</text>
  <text start="1184.39" dur="3.09">mr. hungar who is an attorney for the</text>
  <text start="1186.37" dur="4.53">house permanent Select Committee on</text>

  <text start="1199.33" dur="4.14">between fusion and the intelligence</text>

  <text start="1203.47" dur="7.079">information would be designed to obtain</text>
  <text start="1207.69" dur="6.75">what that means is they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="1210.549" dur="7.231">see if fusion gps was a contractor and</text>
  <text start="1214.44" dur="8.08">we know they got those bank records I am</text>
  <text start="1217.78" dur="8.31">not sure if they were paid as a</text>

  <text start="1226.09" dur="6.42">law I don&amp;#39;t know how it was done but</text>
  <text start="1228.39" dur="5.11">clearly clearly the house the house</text>
  <text start="1232.51" dur="4.049">permanent Select Committee on</text>
  <text start="1233.5" dur="5.16">Intelligence was also looking for this</text>
  <text start="1236.559" dur="6.301">information and I think that the reason</text>
  <text start="1238.66" dur="6.54">why is because of this so again the</text>
  <text start="1242.86" dur="5.84">reason why the FISA warrant was even</text>
  <text start="1245.2" dur="6.39">ever applied for is because of the hero</text>
  <text start="1248.7" dur="6.49">Admiral Mike Rogers who saw what was</text>
  <text start="1251.59" dur="6.51">going on underneath him with the NSA and</text>
  <text start="1255.19" dur="7.95">government contractors abuse it abusing</text>
  <text start="1258.1" dur="7.53">the the the 702 database the Office of</text>

  <text start="1265.63" dur="4.38">during their investigation into the FISA</text>
  <text start="1267.52" dur="5.01">warrant this will definitely be a part</text>
  <text start="1270.01" dur="5.43">of it I am super excited to see whether</text>
  <text start="1272.53" dur="4.71">or not I&amp;#39;m correct on this because this</text>
  <text start="1275.44" dur="4.5">is something that I broke almost a year</text>
