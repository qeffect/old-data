  <text start="115.619" dur="8.941">it means just kind of like an analysis</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="8.97">of bars fantastic interview with what</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="4.08">was her name forget her name Jan</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="5.401">Crawford</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="7.08">Jan Crawford okay let&amp;#39;s get started</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="5.91">shall we mr. Chen oh thank you very much</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="5.16">for sitting down with us so obviously we</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="4.68">saw the special counsel yesterday makes</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="4.17">that statement he analyzed eleven</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="5.64">instances where there were possible</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="5.85">obstruction and then said that he really</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="3.75">couldn&amp;#39;t make a decision conclusion on</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="3.48">whether or not the president had in fact</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.71">committed obstruction because of the</text>
  <text start="154.38" dur="5.7">existing OLC opinion in the legal</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="6.03">counsel&amp;#39;s office do you agree with that</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="5.629">interpretation that that legal opinion</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="5.19">prevented him from making in conclusion</text>
  <text start="165.709" dur="4.75">I&amp;#39;m not sure he said it prevented him I</text>
  <text start="168.36" dur="4.02">think what he said was he took that into</text>
  <text start="170.459" dur="4.891">account plus a number of other</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="4.62">Prudential judgments about fairness and</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="3.87">other things and decided that the best</text>
  <text start="177" dur="5.37">course was not for him to reach a</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="4.739">decision I personally felt he could have</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="3.06">reached the decision but it was there</text>
  <text start="183.959" dur="3.451">anything that would have stopped him and</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="4.83">the regulations are in those that</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="4.23">opinion itself he could have read in</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="2.61">your view he could have reached a</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="3.569">conclusion right he could have reached a</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="5.58">conclusion the opinion says you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="5.791">indict a president while he&amp;#39;s in office</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="4.759">but he could have reached a decision as</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.53">to whether it was criminal activity but</text>
  <text start="203.209" dur="4.481">he had his reasons for not doing it</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="5.91">which he explained and I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="5.4">you know argue about those reasons but</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="3.66">when he didn&amp;#39;t make a decision the</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="5.34">Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="6.33">and I felt it was necessary for us as</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="6.089">the head of the department to reach that</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="4.71">decision that&amp;#39;s what the Department of</text>
  <text start="224.519" dur="4.19">Justice does that&amp;#39;s why we have the</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="5.37">compulsory powers like a grand jury to</text>
  <text start="228.709" dur="4.481">force people to give us evidence so that</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="3.39">we can determine whether a crime has</text>
  <text start="233.19" dur="4.049">been committed and in order to</text>
  <text start="234.9" dur="8.7">legitimate the process we felt we had to</text>
  <text start="237.239" dur="8.31">reach a decision well okay so basically</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="4.41">Muller there in his press conference</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="6.811">yesterday summer or two days ago</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="6.9">summarized and said that the reason why</text>
  <text start="252.36" dur="4.379">he didn&amp;#39;t come to a decision on whether</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="4.29">or not to indict President Trump on</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="4.771">obstruction of justice was because the</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="3.28">office of legal counsel opinion which is</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="5.5">not law</text>
  <text start="262.48" dur="7.04">states that you can&amp;#39;t indict a sitting</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="4.56">president but that didn&amp;#39;t preclude</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="5.38">Robert Muller from coming to a</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="5.19">conclusion on whether or not there was</text>
  <text start="274.9" dur="4.02">criminal activity and obstruction and</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="4.71">Muller decided not to do that</text>
  <text start="278.92" dur="5.24">what what Muller did do however was</text>
  <text start="281.47" dur="4.91">explain all of this in the report and</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="5.44">conveniently didn&amp;#39;t discuss that</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="5.2">explanation in his press conference</text>
  <text start="289.6" dur="5.43">because his press conference was</text>
  <text start="291.58" dur="8.94">basically a weapon um then we go on to</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="7.95">hear bar talk about how the Department</text>
  <text start="300.52" dur="5.25">of Justice is there to make decisions on</text>
  <text start="302.98" dur="6.27">these things one way or another and the</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="5.58">fact that Muller didn&amp;#39;t make a decision</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="4.35">even though Barr feels that he should be</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="3.57">able to make a decision left at the left</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="4.4">that on the Department of Justice to go</text>
  <text start="314.92" dur="6.54">ahead and do so I basically just</text>
  <text start="318" dur="5.83">reiterated everything that he just said</text>
  <text start="321.46" dur="5.55">but what I find very interesting about</text>
  <text start="323.83" dur="8.91">this is the fact that they used he uses</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="8.31">rod Rosenstein very poignant Lee</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="5.13">he says ver and remember I mean but I</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="6.66">don&amp;#39;t believe that Barr says anything</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="5.64">without a reason and so he says the</text>
  <text start="341.98" dur="5.82">Deputy Attorney General and I rod</text>
  <text start="343.51" dur="5.82">Rosenstein decided for the Deputy</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="4.32">Attorney General rod Rosen Stein and I</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="6.66">decided and he places rod Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="6.09">first and that&amp;#39;s not by accident it puts</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="4.08">more weight on Rosenstein it puts more</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="3.87">weight on his decision it puts more</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="4.92">weight on his input putting him before</text>
  <text start="362.08" dur="4.8">himself there&amp;#39;s a little subliminal</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="3.81">thing that I picked up on let&amp;#39;s keep</text>
  <text start="366.88" dur="3.93">going well he seemed to suggest</text>
  <text start="368.8" dur="4.74">yesterday that there was another venue</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="4.8">for this and that was Congress well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="373.54" dur="3.63">not sure what he was suggesting but you</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="4.41">know the Department of Justice doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="377.17" dur="5.37">use our powers of investigating crimes</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="4.23">as an adjunct to Congress Congress as a</text>
  <text start="382.54" dur="5.22">separate branch of government and they</text>
  <text start="384.25" dur="5.7">can you know they have processes we have</text>
  <text start="387.76" dur="4.08">our processes ours are related to the</text>
  <text start="389.95" dur="4.179">criminal justice process we&amp;#39;re not an</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="6.279">extension of Congress&amp;#39;s investigative</text>
  <text start="394.129" dur="5.85">hours a year 10 what he basically just</text>
  <text start="398.119" dur="4.2">said is impeachment is a political</text>
  <text start="399.979" dur="4.5">process we&amp;#39;ve come to a conclusion there</text>
  <text start="402.319" dur="3.84">was no criminal activities here their</text>
  <text start="404.479" dur="5.49">work does not inform ours</text>
  <text start="406.159" dur="6.66">I suppose in this case our work informs</text>
  <text start="409.969" dur="8.13">theirs but he doesn&amp;#39;t even want to go</text>
  <text start="412.819" dur="8.49">there he doesn&amp;#39;t get into it he just</text>
  <text start="418.099" dur="5.58">gives his answer and moves on he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="421.309" dur="4.08">even want to address the fact that what</text>
  <text start="423.679" dur="3.3">Muller was doing there was referring</text>
  <text start="425.389" dur="3.3">basically for impeachment he just</text>
  <text start="426.979" dur="3.72">glosses over it which i think is</text>
  <text start="428.689" dur="3.48">interesting he doesn&amp;#39;t want to give any</text>
  <text start="430.699" dur="3.9">weight to that he doesn&amp;#39;t even want to</text>
  <text start="432.169" dur="4.23">reiterate it there&amp;#39;s a thing that I talk</text>
  <text start="434.599" dur="4.8">about often with President Trump that he</text>
  <text start="436.399" dur="4.92">never speaks negativity ever into</text>
  <text start="439.399" dur="5.13">existence when it comes to his progress</text>
  <text start="441.319" dur="6.36">his success etc so on and so forth he</text>
  <text start="444.529" dur="5.13">just doesn&amp;#39;t he just doesn&amp;#39;t do it so</text>
  <text start="447.679" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an interesting way to</text>
  <text start="449.659" dur="4.47">lead your life it tends to be that way</text>
  <text start="452.329" dur="4.35">for many successful people that they do</text>
  <text start="454.129" dur="5.94">not speak negative into the the Aether&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.679" dur="4.71">so to speak or the ethers they don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="460.069" dur="4.83">know you&amp;#39;ll never hear President Trump</text>
  <text start="461.389" dur="5.94">say and do such a good job ever and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.899" dur="5.61">wildly successful I just wanted to point</text>
  <text start="467.329" dur="5.31">that out testified that when you&amp;#39;ve met</text>
  <text start="470.509" dur="4.17">with Muller at the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="472.639" dur="4.411">you had that meeting that you were</text>
  <text start="474.679" dur="4.08">surprised when he told you then that he</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="4.529">was not going to reach a conclusion on</text>
  <text start="478.759" dur="7.77">obstruction yes rod and I were both</text>
  <text start="481.579" dur="10.14">surprised by that did you ask him look</text>
  <text start="486.529" dur="6.99">we need you to again rod and I both rod</text>
  <text start="491.719" dur="4.47">and I both were surprised</text>
  <text start="493.519" dur="4.2">both of us were rod Rosenstein was as</text>
  <text start="496.189" dur="4.171">much a part of these decisions as</text>
  <text start="497.719" dur="4.59">anybody else was you see what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="4.409">and make it a conclusion on this you</text>
  <text start="502.309" dur="4.14">should make a conclusion I would I</text>
  <text start="504.769" dur="3.57">wouldn&amp;#39;t say I really pressed him on it</text>
  <text start="506.449" dur="3.84">I was interested in his thinking on it</text>
  <text start="508.339" dur="3.94">and he explained his position said he</text>
  <text start="510.289" dur="5.201">was still thinking it through and</text>
  <text start="512.279" dur="7.23">and but I didn&amp;#39;t really press him nor</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="5.639">did rod so but you left that meeting</text>
  <text start="519.509" dur="4.74">thinking that he wasn&amp;#39;t going to have a</text>
  <text start="521.129" dur="5.341">conclusion that&amp;#39;s right do you feel</text>
  <text start="524.249" dur="4.95">because he didn&amp;#39;t do that I mean did he</text>
  <text start="526.47" dur="4.679">fulfill his responsibilities a special</text>
  <text start="529.199" dur="4.05">counsel if you look at the regulations</text>
  <text start="531.149" dur="5.49">it seems tense hyssop aid that you would</text>
  <text start="533.249" dur="5.671">get a confidential report explaining why</text>
  <text start="536.639" dur="4.38">he made a decision to either prosecute</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="4.26">or decline to prosecute he didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="541.019" dur="6.12">that it seems to me right but on the</text>
  <text start="543.18" dur="6.209">other hand he he did provide us of a</text>
  <text start="547.139" dur="6">report and what he viewed to be the</text>
  <text start="549.389" dur="6.87">relevant facts and that allowed us as</text>
  <text start="553.139" dur="6">the as the leaders of the department to</text>
  <text start="556.259" dur="5.791">make the decision what&amp;#39;s the fundamental</text>
  <text start="559.139" dur="5.7">difference why I mean he said that he</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="5.43">couldn&amp;#39;t exonerate the president that he</text>
  <text start="564.839" dur="4.071">looked at the evidences of possible</text>
  <text start="567.48" dur="3.719">extraction</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="4.299">he couldn&amp;#39;t exonerate the president if</text>
  <text start="571.199" dur="5.161">he could he would have stated so you</text>
  <text start="573.209" dur="5.13">looked at that evidence and you did I</text>
  <text start="576.36" dur="6.959">mean what&amp;#39;s the fundamental difference</text>
  <text start="578.339" dur="6.93">between your view and his well I think</text>
  <text start="583.319" dur="4.591">Bob said that he was not going to engage</text>
  <text start="585.269" dur="5.37">in the analysis he was he was not going</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="6.69">to make a determination one way or the</text>
  <text start="590.639" dur="6.42">other and he also said that he could not</text>
  <text start="594.6" dur="4.529">say that the the president was clearly</text>
  <text start="597.059" dur="3.691">did not violate the law which of course</text>
  <text start="599.129" dur="3.541">is not the standard we use at the</text>
  <text start="600.75" dur="6.769">department we have to determine whether</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="7.769">there is clear violation of the law and</text>
  <text start="607.519" dur="6.49">so we applied the standards we would</text>
  <text start="610.439" dur="8.221">normally apply we analyzed the law and</text>
  <text start="614.009" dur="8.06">the facts and a group of us spent a lot</text>
  <text start="618.66" dur="6.06">of time doing that and determined that</text>
  <text start="622.069" dur="4.33">both as a matter of law many of the</text>
  <text start="624.72" dur="4.5">instances would not amount to</text>
  <text start="626.399" dur="4.201">obstruction as a matter of law as a</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="4.8">matter of law in other words we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="630.6" dur="5.79">agree with the legal analysis</text>
  <text start="634.02" dur="4.26">a lot of the legal analysis and the</text>
  <text start="636.39" dur="3.99">report he did not reflect the views of</text>
  <text start="638.28" dur="5.85">the department it was the views of a</text>
  <text start="640.38" dur="5.64">particular lawyer or lawyers basically</text>
  <text start="644.13" dur="4.53">what bar is saying there is that it was</text>
  <text start="646.02" dur="3.99">political in a very diplomatic way he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="3.51">saying that these decisions were</text>
  <text start="650.01" dur="4.02">political they reflected a group of</text>

  <text start="654.03" dur="4.83">lawyers were partisan in my opinion Bar</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="3.51">is saying here that he thinks it was a</text>
  <text start="658.86" dur="4.89">political decision to put those</text>
  <text start="660.81" dur="5.76">conclusions inside of the report I</text>
  <text start="663.75" dur="6.84">really loved how straightforward he is</text>
  <text start="666.57" dur="5.55">and how by-the-book he is and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.59" dur="7.23">gonna hear as this goes on a lot more</text>
  <text start="672.12" dur="7.95">about that what keep going and so we</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="4.53">applied what we thought was the right</text>
  <text start="680.07" dur="4.74">law but then we didn&amp;#39;t rely on that we</text>
  <text start="682.35" dur="4.02">also looked at all the facts tried to</text>
  <text start="684.81" dur="3.69">determine whether the government could</text>
  <text start="686.37" dur="4.23">establish all the elements and as to</text>
  <text start="688.5" dur="5.37">each of those episodes we felt that the</text>
  <text start="690.6" dur="6.63">evidence was deficient before you became</text>

  <text start="711.72" dur="3.63">executive authority how much I mean when</text>
  <text start="714.24" dur="2.85">you&amp;#39;re talking about me can you explain</text>
  <text start="715.35" dur="4.53">that a little more when you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="717.09" dur="5.82">about your judgment that no obstruction</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="5.79">occurred based on the evidence that</text>
  <text start="722.91" dur="4.1">Muller produced and your understanding</text>
  <text start="725.67" dur="5.73">of the law can you explain a little more</text>
  <text start="727.01" dur="6.61">why wasn&amp;#39;t that obstruction well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="731.4" dur="5.43">take let&amp;#39;s take the firing of koumei for</text>
  <text start="733.62" dur="4.83">example I think we would have said as a</text>
  <text start="736.83" dur="4.17">matter of law and I&amp;#39;m not relying on my</text>
  <text start="738.45" dur="4.83">legal of my legal memo that I wrote as a</text>
  <text start="741" dur="4.44">private citizen but really on the views</text>
  <text start="743.28" dur="4.77">within the department of the people who</text>

  <text start="748.05" dur="3.18">responsible for framing the views of the</text>
  <text start="749.79" dur="4.38">department and I think we would have</text>
  <text start="751.23" dur="5.07">said that as a matter of law the</text>
  <text start="754.17" dur="4.62">obstruction statutes do not reach</text>

  <text start="769.62" dur="4.77">then looked at that issue let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="772.35" dur="5.03">again the firing of Comey one of the</text>
  <text start="774.39" dur="6.78">elements is that you have to show that</text>
  <text start="777.38" dur="6.58">the act objectively speaking will have</text>
  <text start="781.17" dur="5.88">the probable effect of obstructing and</text>
  <text start="783.96" dur="5.46">proceeding and we don&amp;#39;t believe that the</text>
  <text start="787.05" dur="3.99">firing of an agency had could be</text>
  <text start="789.42" dur="4.16">established as having the probable</text>

  <text start="793.58" dur="6.55">sabotaging a proceeding and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.7" dur="5.58">clearly the case because the proceeding</text>
  <text start="800.13" dur="5.61">went on not only that but I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="803.28" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t know if he gets into this here but</text>
  <text start="805.74" dur="7.08">everybody forgets that several times</text>
  <text start="809.1" dur="7.7">James Comey told President Trump that he</text>
  <text start="812.82" dur="7.26">wasn&amp;#39;t under investigation and then</text>
  <text start="816.8" dur="4.96">President Trump was upset because James</text>
  <text start="820.08" dur="3.68">Comey wouldn&amp;#39;t go out publicly and say</text>
  <text start="821.76" dur="6.18">that he was an under investigation</text>
  <text start="823.76" dur="6.69">so firing James Comey thereby couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="827.94" dur="8.43">be an act of obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="830.45" dur="7.87">because Comey had told President Trump</text>
  <text start="836.37" dur="4.44">that he wasn&amp;#39;t under investigation so</text>
  <text start="838.32" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s not that President Trump fired</text>
  <text start="840.81" dur="4.26">James Comey to stop him from</text>
  <text start="842.79" dur="5.01">investigating him because he didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="845.07" dur="4.35">know he was under investigation we could</text>
  <text start="847.8" dur="6.89">spend hours going through the</text>
  <text start="849.42" dur="8.46">obstruction portion of the Moller report</text>
  <text start="854.69" dur="5.89">it&amp;#39;s an exercise in futility the legal</text>
  <text start="857.88" dur="4.56">reasoning from and I only speak to this</text>
  <text start="860.58" dur="4.52">from having read hundreds and hundreds</text>
  <text start="862.44" dur="5.22">of opinions just in the course of work</text>
  <text start="865.1" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re round they they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="5.1">circular they don&amp;#39;t make sense it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="869.97" dur="4.77">not a solid footing and and Barr is said</text>
  <text start="872.76" dur="4.77">repeatedly that he&amp;#39;s taken himself out</text>
  <text start="874.74" dur="4.53">of what would be a sound footing and</text>
  <text start="877.53" dur="3.3">tried to put himself in the shoes of the</text>
  <text start="879.27" dur="3.99">folks that made the decision and he</text>
  <text start="880.83" dur="4.31">still couldn&amp;#39;t do it so in other words</text>
  <text start="883.26" dur="8.03">I&amp;#39;m gonna forget everything I know about</text>
  <text start="885.14" dur="9.1">everything and just pretend that I know</text>
  <text start="891.29" dur="6.67">what these people are putting in front</text>
  <text start="894.24" dur="5.6">of me and use their theories to come to</text>
  <text start="897.96" dur="3.62">a conclusion and he still couldn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="899.84" dur="4.38">conclusion or a conclusion about</text>
  <text start="901.58" dur="5.46">criminality it was also we would have to</text>
  <text start="904.22" dur="5.96">prove corrupt intent the report itself</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="5.37">points out that one of the likely</text>
  <text start="910.18" dur="3.97">motivations here was the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="912.41" dur="3.36">frustration that call me saying</text>
  <text start="914.15" dur="3.69">something publicly and saying a</text>
  <text start="915.77" dur="4.95">different thing privately and refusing</text>
  <text start="917.84" dur="6.75">to correct the record and that was it</text>
  <text start="920.72" dur="5.19">that would become II think my bed so</text>
  <text start="924.59" dur="3.6">that would not have been a corrupt</text>
  <text start="925.91" dur="4.05">intent so for each of these episodes we</text>
  <text start="928.19" dur="3.18">thought long and hard about it we looked</text>
  <text start="929.96" dur="4.23">at the facts and we didn&amp;#39;t feel the</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="8.1">government could establish obstruction</text>
  <text start="934.19" dur="6.87">in these cases when you see some of the</text>
  <text start="939.47" dur="4.5">criticism and you&amp;#39;ve gotten quite a bit</text>
  <text start="941.06" dur="4.35">of it that you&amp;#39;re protecting the</text>
  <text start="943.97" dur="3.77">president that you&amp;#39;re enabling the</text>
  <text start="945.41" dur="5.52">president what&amp;#39;s your response to that</text>
  <text start="947.74" dur="5.11">well I live in a hyper partisan age</text>
  <text start="950.93" dur="4.2">where people no longer really pay</text>
  <text start="952.85" dur="4.65">attention substance of what said but as</text>
  <text start="955.13" dur="5.96">to who says it and what side they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="957.5" dur="6.09">and what its political ramifications are</text>
  <text start="961.09" dur="4.62">Department of Justice is all about the</text>
  <text start="963.59" dur="4.53">law and the facts and the substance and</text>
  <text start="965.71" dur="4.42">I&amp;#39;m going to make the decisions based on</text>
  <text start="968.12" dur="3.36">the law and the facts and I realize</text>
  <text start="970.13" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s in tension with the political</text>
  <text start="971.48" dur="4.71">climate we live in because people are</text>
  <text start="973.52" dur="5.13">more interested in getting their way</text>
  <text start="976.19" dur="4.23">politically so I think it just goes with</text>
  <text start="978.65" dur="5.82">the territory of being Attorney General</text>
  <text start="980.42" dur="8.67">in a hyper partisan period of time in</text>
  <text start="984.47" dur="6.9">other words yeah nothing logic and</text>
  <text start="989.09" dur="4.86">reason doesn&amp;#39;t matter anymore people</text>
  <text start="991.37" dur="5.1">hear what they want to hear people are</text>
  <text start="993.95" dur="5.67">more interested in quote their side</text>
  <text start="996.47" dur="4.5">winning than facts and rule of law he</text>
  <text start="999.62" dur="2.76">doesn&amp;#39;t give a crap about any of that</text>
  <text start="1000.97" dur="3.2">stuff and he&amp;#39;s gonna keep doing what</text>
  <text start="1002.38" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s doing based on the rule of law and</text>
  <text start="1004.17" dur="4.54">he expects that this will happen given</text>
  <text start="1007.03" dur="5.39">that we&amp;#39;re in a hyper partisan climate</text>
  <text start="1008.71" dur="7.67">the four-page summary that you wrote</text>
  <text start="1012.42" dur="6.07">did you ask in that March 5th meeting</text>
  <text start="1016.38" dur="6.4">for the special council to kind of</text>
  <text start="1018.49" dur="6.66">redact all the grand jury material yes</text>
  <text start="1022.78" dur="4.92">not redacted but highlighted so we could</text>
  <text start="1025.15" dur="5.08">redact it I&amp;#39;m gonna summarize this part</text>
  <text start="1027.7" dur="5.17">for you because it&amp;#39;s gonna be long</text>
  <text start="1030.23" dur="4.89">and I read it basically what bar is</text>
  <text start="1032.87" dur="6.23">gonna say is that he had asked the</text>
  <text start="1035.12" dur="7.169">special counsel to redact the or</text>
  <text start="1039.1" dur="6.609">identify in their report the grand jury</text>
  <text start="1042.289" dur="6.87">material that existed and so that way</text>
  <text start="1045.709" dur="5.491">bars office could easily redact that and</text>
  <text start="1049.159" dur="4.411">then quickly get the report out this</text>
  <text start="1051.2" dur="4.709">came up in his hearing when he got the</text>
  <text start="1053.57" dur="3.93">report that hadn&amp;#39;t been done when he</text>
  <text start="1055.909" dur="3.87">realized it was going to take weeks for</text>
  <text start="1057.5" dur="5.039">that to be done because they hadn&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="1059.779" dur="4.681">it he loosely suggested it then he</text>
  <text start="1062.539" dur="5.341">directed them to do it and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1064.46" dur="6.51">do it he decided that he was going to</text>
  <text start="1067.88" dur="5.909">need to release the report or release</text>
  <text start="1070.97" dur="5.1">the summary memo of the report in order</text>
  <text start="1073.789" dur="4.531">to quell the public and I&amp;#39;m gonna just</text>
  <text start="1076.07" dur="5.16">find where he talks about how important</text>
  <text start="1078.32" dur="5.25">this was and why to show you weeks</text>
  <text start="1081.23" dur="3.78">before we could get the report out if I</text>
  <text start="1083.57" dur="2.969">had my druthers I would have liked to</text>
  <text start="1085.01" dur="4.08">get the report out as quickly as</text>
  <text start="1086.539" dur="4.831">possible so instead you turned this four</text>
  <text start="1089.09" dur="4.049">page summary right because I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1091.37" dur="3.809">think the body politic would allow us to</text>
  <text start="1093.139" dur="4.41">go on radio silence for four weeks I</text>
  <text start="1095.179" dur="4.98">mean people were camped outside my house</text>
  <text start="1097.549" dur="4.921">and the department and every there was</text>
  <text start="1100.159" dur="4.74">all kinds of wild speculation going on</text>
  <text start="1102.47" dur="5.579">former senior intelligence officials who</text>
  <text start="1104.899" dur="4.981">were purporting to have it or intimating</text>
  <text start="1108.049" dur="3.75">that they had inside information were</text>
  <text start="1109.88" dur="3.81">suggesting that the president his family</text>
  <text start="1111.799" dur="3.48">were going to be indicted and so forth</text>
  <text start="1113.69" dur="3.119">and saying that publicly saying that</text>
  <text start="1115.279" dur="2.61">publicly there was all kind you know</text>
  <text start="1116.809" dur="3.62">that can be false</text>
  <text start="1117.889" dur="5.071">yes and it was wild and irresponsible</text>
  <text start="1120.429" dur="3.46">speculation going on which then</text>
  <text start="1122.96" dur="3.719">irresponsible</text>
  <text start="1123.889" dur="5.191">the former intelligence officials and</text>
  <text start="1126.679" dur="4.62">and and talking heads and things like</text>
  <text start="1129.08" dur="4.14">that and these things affect the United</text>
  <text start="1131.299" dur="4.561">States ability to function in the world</text>
  <text start="1133.22" dur="5.52">we have a economy it could affect the</text>

  <text start="1141.409" dur="4.851">period of time with you know serious</text>
  <text start="1143.419" dur="5.551">adversaries in the world so I felt that</text>
  <text start="1146.26" dur="5.11">in order to buy time in order to get the</text>
  <text start="1148.97" dur="3.929">report out I had to state the bottom</text>
  <text start="1151.37" dur="3.6">line just like you&amp;#39;re announcing a</text>
  <text start="1152.899" dur="5.041">verdict in a case my purpose there was</text>
  <text start="1154.97" dur="4.99">not to summarize every jot and tittle of</text>

  <text start="1159.96" dur="7.2">you know angle that that that Muller</text>
  <text start="1163.41" dur="6.06">looked into but just state the bottom</text>
  <text start="1167.16" dur="4.5">line which I did in the four-page memo</text>
  <text start="1169.47" dur="6.51">you didn&amp;#39;t say in that four-page memo</text>
  <text start="1171.66" dur="6.36">that the report would not exonerate the</text>
  <text start="1175.98" dur="5.61">President on obstruction that line that</text>
  <text start="1178.02" dur="7.38">I said that yes you know in the in my</text>
  <text start="1181.59" dur="6.12">four-page memo I said that Muller did</text>
  <text start="1185.4" dur="4.89">not reach a decision he he gave both</text>
  <text start="1187.71" dur="4.86">sides and that and then I quoted that</text>
  <text start="1190.29" dur="5.76">sentence which is well we didn&amp;#39;t find a</text>
  <text start="1192.57" dur="5.73">crime we didn&amp;#39;t exonerate the president</text>
  <text start="1196.05" dur="4.83">that was in the four-page letter</text>
  <text start="1198.3" dur="4.32">what gets me about that is that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1200.88" dur="6.18">the Justice Department&amp;#39;s duty to</text>
  <text start="1202.62" dur="8.7">exonerate anybody and I hate that word</text>
  <text start="1207.06" dur="5.7">exonerate because it&amp;#39;s like your guilt</text>
  <text start="1211.32" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re innocent until proven guilty in</text>
  <text start="1212.76" dur="4.53">this country and it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1215.31" dur="5.91">of a difficult concept to understand I</text>
  <text start="1217.29" dur="6.39">know I know that sounds what I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="1221.22" dur="4.56">to say is really honestly for me</text>
  <text start="1223.68" dur="5.13">personally took me a little while to</text>
  <text start="1225.78" dur="6.72">really grasp this I just took it for</text>
  <text start="1228.81" dur="5.55">granted for so long you don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1232.5" dur="3.15">innocent until proven guilty and people</text>
  <text start="1234.36" dur="4.07">take it for granted like you don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1235.65" dur="5.31">do you are innocent you are exonerated</text>
  <text start="1238.43" dur="4.3">you&amp;#39;re exonerated until they can prove</text>

  <text start="1242.73" dur="7.05">you&amp;#39;re exonerated</text>
  <text start="1246.11" dur="5.16">so this whole bit is of exonerating him</text>
  <text start="1249.78" dur="5.4">and not you know this is all nonsense</text>
  <text start="1251.27" dur="5.5">and we know it again I&amp;#39;m just kind of</text>
  <text start="1255.18" dur="3.36">trying to find tidbits but I want you to</text>
  <text start="1256.77" dur="5.07">listen to what he does does right here</text>
  <text start="1258.54" dur="5.34">again in terms of the obstruction he his</text>
  <text start="1261.84" dur="3.63">conclusion was he wasn&amp;#39;t exonerating the</text>
  <text start="1263.88" dur="5.37">president but he wasn&amp;#39;t finding a crime</text>
  <text start="1265.47" dur="6.09">either and for for the purposes at the</text>
  <text start="1269.25" dur="4.02">point I think that that was what was</text>
  <text start="1271.56" dur="3.45">required for the body politic because</text>
  <text start="1273.27" dur="5">actually most of the letter then goes on</text>
  <text start="1275.01" dur="6.93">to explain how rod Rosenstein and I</text>
  <text start="1278.27" dur="9.46">reached a decision and again rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="1281.94" dur="8.46">Stein and I not how me and rod</text>
  <text start="1287.73" dur="3.9">Rosenstein or you know what I mean just</text>
  <text start="1290.4" dur="2.97">saying it&amp;#39;s just something I picked up</text>
  <text start="1291.63" dur="6.38">on maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong I</text>
  <text start="1293.37" dur="7.83">doubt it maybe now he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="1298.01" dur="4.63">yeah sure he was surprised he just</text>
  <text start="1301.2" dur="4.109">didn&amp;#39;t pick up the phone and call me</text>
  <text start="1302.64" dur="6.27">given our 30-year relationship but why</text>
  <text start="1305.309" dur="5.311">didn&amp;#39;t he I don&amp;#39;t know but as I said it</text>
  <text start="1308.91" dur="4.31">in hearing I thought it was a little</text>
  <text start="1310.62" dur="4.92">steady and probably staff driven I</text>
  <text start="1313.22" dur="3.88">personally felt but but we had a good</text>
  <text start="1315.54" dur="3.39">otherwise you would have picked up the</text>
  <text start="1317.1" dur="7.59">phone and write well which I did and we</text>
  <text start="1318.93" dur="7.59">had a good conversation and I think this</text>
  <text start="1324.69" dur="4.14">was about the letter that the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1326.52" dur="5.31">brought up is some big like you lied to</text>
  <text start="1328.83" dur="5.28">us you remember he brought up this</text>
  <text start="1331.83" dur="4.08">letter he the Democrats were like you</text>
  <text start="1334.11" dur="5.27">got this letter you knew that Muller</text>
  <text start="1335.91" dur="3.47">wasn&amp;#39;t happy with the results of your</text>
  <text start="1339.41" dur="6.37">it&amp;#39;s all politics sick now he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1343.5" dur="4.41">talk about the joint statement and I</text>
  <text start="1345.78" dur="4.23">want you to carefully listen to his</text>
  <text start="1347.91" dur="4.5">words the joint statement was a</text>
  <text start="1350.01" dur="4.44">statement released by both the DOJ and</text>
  <text start="1352.41" dur="6.019">and robert muller the first of its kind</text>
  <text start="1354.45" dur="7.609">where they agree that it was not only</text>
  <text start="1358.429" dur="6.401">the OLC the office of legal counsel</text>
  <text start="1362.059" dur="5.441">opinion that informed bob Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1364.83" dur="5.16">decision because barra testified under</text>
  <text start="1367.5" dur="4.2">oath that Muller had told him three</text>
  <text start="1369.99" dur="3.93">times that that&amp;#39;s not the only thing</text>
  <text start="1371.7" dur="3.18">that drove his decision not to indict</text>
  <text start="1373.92" dur="4.41">President Trump</text>
  <text start="1374.88" dur="5.22">criminally and and Muller and his press</text>
  <text start="1378.33" dur="4.02">conference came out and seemed to say</text>
  <text start="1380.1" dur="4.26">the opposite and so everybody went wild</text>
  <text start="1382.35" dur="3.63">with it which then forced them both to</text>
  <text start="1384.36" dur="4.23">come out together and clarify everything</text>
  <text start="1385.98" dur="5.76">and and Bill Bar is about to explain why</text>
  <text start="1388.59" dur="5.94">they did that very well because I think</text>
  <text start="1391.74" dur="4.68">there were some people who wouldn&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="1394.53" dur="3.93">the facts interfere with their narrative</text>
  <text start="1396.42" dur="3.63">and we&amp;#39;re trying to suggest that there</text>
  <text start="1398.46" dur="4.08">was a difference of opinion about the</text>
  <text start="1400.05" dur="4.68">role played by the OLC opinion which</text>
  <text start="1402.54" dur="5.639">simply wasn&amp;#39;t true the difference is</text>
  <text start="1404.73" dur="5.19">your views on obstruction and well the</text>
  <text start="1408.179" dur="5.521">difference was this or so I understand</text>
  <text start="1409.92" dur="6.95">was that and I guess I guess you focused</text>
  <text start="1413.7" dur="6.96">on what the role the OLC opinion played</text>
  <text start="1416.87" dur="6.01">were in the statement the so-called</text>
  <text start="1420.66" dur="4.46">discrepancy was that I had I had</text>
  <text start="1422.88" dur="8.37">testified earlier</text>
  <text start="1425.12" dur="9.16">that Bob had assured me that he had not</text>
  <text start="1431.25" dur="5.88">reached a decision that there was a</text>
  <text start="1434.28" dur="5.37">crime committed but was not willing to</text>
  <text start="1437.13" dur="6.75">pursue it simply because of the OLC</text>
  <text start="1439.65" dur="6.65">opinion and that remains the fact he</text>
  <text start="1443.88" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s what his position is that</text>
  <text start="1446.3" dur="3.94">consistent with what he said yesterday</text>
  <text start="1448.14" dur="5.04">and it certainly is consistent with the</text>
  <text start="1450.24" dur="6.42">joint release we put out the the</text>
  <text start="1453.18" dur="6.54">confusion arose because what Bob</text>
  <text start="1456.66" dur="5.31">Miller&amp;#39;s position was was that the OLC</text>
  <text start="1459.72" dur="4.53">opinion coupled with other things as a</text>
  <text start="1461.97" dur="5.3">Prudential matter made him feel that he</text>
  <text start="1464.25" dur="5.82">shouldn&amp;#39;t even get into the analysis</text>
  <text start="1467.27" dur="6.13">this is the problem this is the problem</text>
  <text start="1470.07" dur="6.75">with having for lack of a better word</text>
  <text start="1473.4" dur="8.63">really unintelligent people on the media</text>
  <text start="1476.82" dur="11.84">and in the media they can&amp;#39;t comprehend</text>
  <text start="1482.03" dur="11.68">legal back-and-forth or logical</text>
  <text start="1488.66" dur="7.66">discussion or complex legal matters or</text>
  <text start="1493.71" dur="3.96">anything all they care about is a</text>
  <text start="1496.32" dur="3.33">narrative and so when you have</text>
  <text start="1497.67" dur="3.9">unintelligent people or people who are</text>
  <text start="1499.65" dur="5.1">lazy or people who just don&amp;#39;t care and</text>
  <text start="1501.57" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;ve got a very complex legal issue or</text>
  <text start="1504.75" dur="3">matter that has to do with the</text>
  <text start="1505.8" dur="3.72">presidents of the United States and all</text>
  <text start="1507.75" dur="4.59">of them hate him and want to see him out</text>
  <text start="1509.52" dur="7.86">of office because their puppet sock</text>
  <text start="1512.34" dur="8.25">puppets for the other side you get you</text>
  <text start="1517.38" dur="7.23">get wild mischaracterization of fact you</text>
  <text start="1520.59" dur="5.85">get wild speculation you get this sort</text>
  <text start="1524.61" dur="4.05">of an incident over something which</text>
  <text start="1526.44" dur="4.07">should technically be really not a big</text>
  <text start="1528.66" dur="5.31">deal</text>
  <text start="1530.51" dur="8.41">it should be easily understood and you</text>
  <text start="1533.97" dur="6.69">get that confusion because there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1538.92" dur="4.92">much partisanship and propaganda</text>
  <text start="1540.66" dur="5.37">involved and that&amp;#39;s what this was also</text>
  <text start="1543.84" dur="3.98">the next bunch of questions has to do</text>
  <text start="1546.03" dur="4.23">with whether or not Barr thinks that</text>
  <text start="1547.82" dur="4.87">Muller should testify in front of</text>
  <text start="1550.26" dur="3.99">Congress and Muller saying basically you</text>
  <text start="1552.69" dur="3">know if he wants to he should if he</text>
  <text start="1554.25" dur="3.42">doesn&amp;#39;t I think the line that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1555.69" dur="2.4">drawing in the sand here with my reports</text>
  <text start="1557.67" dur="2.91">going to</text>
  <text start="1558.09" dur="4.59">for itself is actually consistent with</text>
  <text start="1560.58" dur="4.17">Justice Department policy and that we</text>
  <text start="1562.68" dur="4.02">usually don&amp;#39;t parade attorneys and US</text>
  <text start="1564.75" dur="3.74">attorneys out into Congress to talk</text>
  <text start="1566.7" dur="5.22">about investigations that they&amp;#39;ve run</text>
  <text start="1568.49" dur="5.53">and so Barr seems to be on the side of</text>
  <text start="1571.92" dur="5.07">Muller that he shouldn&amp;#39;t have to go</text>
  <text start="1574.02" dur="4.35">testify he doesn&amp;#39;t want to I tend to</text>
  <text start="1576.99" dur="2.52">disagree with that only because he</text>
  <text start="1578.37" dur="3.51">didn&amp;#39;t have to come out and do a press</text>
  <text start="1579.51" dur="4.11">conference at all if his statement was</text>
  <text start="1581.88" dur="2.97">going to be that you can just find</text>
  <text start="1583.62" dur="3.27">everything that you need to know in the</text>
  <text start="1584.85" dur="3.96">report what was the point of him even</text>
  <text start="1586.89" dur="4.86">showing his face that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="1588.81" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ll never know or we know but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1591.75" dur="3.3">never be talked about and we&amp;#39;ll go on</text>
  <text start="1593.67" dur="3.38">from there</text>
  <text start="1595.05" dur="4.83">the next portion of this interview is</text>
  <text start="1597.05" dur="4.78">blockbuster we learn a lot about the spy</text>
  <text start="1599.88" dur="6.32">gate stuff and we&amp;#39;re gonna dissect that</text>

  <text start="1606.2" dur="6.91">Russia tried to sway our election and he</text>
  <text start="1611.25" dur="3.45">said there were multiple systemic</text>

  <text start="1655.35" dur="6.179">enough was done in 2016 probably not you</text>
  <text start="1660.269" dur="5.25">know I think Bob Muller did some</text>

  <text start="1665.519" dur="5.341">know identifying some of the Russian</text>

  <text start="1670.86" dur="5.13">if that kind of work had been done</text>
  <text start="1673.249" dur="4.961">starting in 2016</text>
  <text start="1675.99" dur="3.84">he&amp;#39;s been a lot different it&amp;#39;s just hard</text>
  <text start="1678.21" dur="7.14">to understand why it wasn&amp;#39;t taken more</text>
  <text start="1679.83" dur="7.02">seriously right I am so frustrated at</text>

  <text start="1692.669" dur="6.84">hacked the DNC server is just never</text>
  <text start="1695.94" dur="6.709">going to go away from me there is too</text>

  <text start="1706.61" dur="7.659">there there it just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s week it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1712.11" dur="4.5">been refuted they didn&amp;#39;t even look at</text>
  <text start="1714.269" dur="5.821">the server we can go through at nauseam</text>
  <text start="1716.61" dur="5.97">why it is that this this part of it it</text>
  <text start="1720.09" dur="4.38">just really it almost feels I was having</text>
  <text start="1722.58" dur="4.319">a conversation with a friend and it kind</text>
  <text start="1724.47" dur="4.649">of feels like and I hope this isn&amp;#39;t true</text>

  <text start="1729.119" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re going to just let this go and</text>
  <text start="1731.129" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;re not going to come to the</text>

  <text start="1735.45" dur="5.609">hacked after all but what I want to kind</text>
  <text start="1738.929" dur="3.83">of bring to everyone&amp;#39;s attention is the</text>
  <text start="1741.059" dur="5.1">fact that I think that we need to</text>
  <text start="1742.759" dur="5.561">everybody forgets what we found in those</text>
  <text start="1746.159" dur="4.291">emails I I think that the substance of</text>
  <text start="1748.32" dur="3.9">those emails is more important than</text>
  <text start="1750.45" dur="4.559">talking about how they were leaked and</text>
  <text start="1752.22" dur="4.949">I&amp;#39;m really seriously considering going</text>
  <text start="1755.009" dur="5.61">back around and doing another overview</text>
  <text start="1757.169" dur="6.571">of the Podesta and DNC emails and just</text>
  <text start="1760.619" dur="5.721">breaking them down again like I did</text>
  <text start="1763.74" dur="5.669">before the election because</text>
  <text start="1766.34" dur="5.169">the substance of those is Sookie and</text>
  <text start="1769.409" dur="5.941">there are a lot more people listening to</text>
  <text start="1771.509" dur="9.39">my channel now than there were then rant</text>
  <text start="1775.35" dur="7.289">over rant over in other words you know</text>
  <text start="1780.899" dur="5.76">their statements being made that people</text>
  <text start="1782.639" dur="7.38">were alarmed back in April and 2016</text>
  <text start="1786.659" dur="4.95">right and and I don&amp;#39;t have any wish to</text>
  <text start="1790.019" dur="3.451">doubt that but I&amp;#39;m wondering what</text>
  <text start="1791.609" dur="4.8">exactly was the response to it if they</text>
  <text start="1793.47" dur="7.439">were alarmed he&amp;#39;s talking about the DNC</text>
  <text start="1796.409" dur="10.321">hack right there which is interesting to</text>
  <text start="1800.909" dur="8.041">me because the piece I did on Comey just</text>
  <text start="1806.73" dur="5.61">recently having his hands possibly on</text>
  <text start="1808.95" dur="5.339">the hacked emails from the DNC or that</text>
  <text start="1812.34" dur="4.98">the leaked emails from the DNC in March</text>

  <text start="1819.779" dur="5.76">that he mentioned is key to April month</text>

  <text start="1837.45" dur="5.49">an earlier time frame and this was an</text>
  <text start="1840.869" dur="5.4">interesting portion for me albeit a</text>
  <text start="1842.94" dur="5.669">small little snippet surely the response</text>
  <text start="1846.269" dur="5.191">should have been more than just you know</text>

  <text start="1851.46" dur="5.73">a peripheral player in the Trump</text>

  <text start="1909.049" dur="3.931">we&amp;#39;ve discussed how important it is that</text>

  <text start="1912.98" dur="4.079">both very cognizant of that you discuss</text>
  <text start="1915.26" dur="3.84">that with him oh yes and you know I</text>

  <text start="1919.1" dur="4.459">we&amp;#39;re working together on you know</text>
  <text start="1921.559" dur="4.411">trying to reconstruct what happened I</text>
  <text start="1923.559" dur="3.941">mean people have to understand you know</text>
  <text start="1925.97" dur="3.75">one of the things here is that these</text>
  <text start="1927.5" dur="4.25">efforts in 2016 these encounter</text>
  <text start="1929.72" dur="4.38">intelligence activities that were</text>

  <text start="1944.09" dur="4.049">speak to them that much he can&amp;#39;t put</text>

  <text start="1951.2" dur="8.13">by the book as far as I can tell as far</text>
  <text start="1954.23" dur="6.36">as I can tell as far as I can tell a lot</text>
  <text start="1959.33" dur="4.92">of the people who were involved are no</text>
  <text start="1960.59" dur="7.949">longer there so so when when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1964.25" dur="5.94">talking about the kind of the well</text>
  <text start="1968.539" dur="3.211">you&amp;#39;ve used the word spying and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1970.19" dur="4.699">testified that you believe spying</text>
  <text start="1971.75" dur="5.13">occurred yes into the Trump campaign yes</text>
  <text start="1974.889" dur="4.15">you&amp;#39;ve gotten some criticism for using</text>
  <text start="1976.88" dur="4.019">that word yeah I mean I guess it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1979.039" dur="4.23">become a dirty word somehow it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1980.899" dur="3.9">never been for me I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1983.269" dur="3.951">nothing wrong with spying the question</text>
  <text start="1984.799" dur="6.901">is always whether it&amp;#39;s authorized by law</text>
  <text start="1987.22" dur="6.76">and properly predicated and if it is</text>
  <text start="1991.7" dur="5.76">then it&amp;#39;s an important tool the United</text>

  <text start="1997.46" dur="6.78">using the word I mean I I just want to</text>
  <text start="2000.01" dur="10.23">say I think that the reason for that</text>
  <text start="2004.24" dur="9.539">disclaimer is so that Deepa the people</text>
  <text start="2010.24" dur="4.71">understand the importance of having the</text>
  <text start="2013.779" dur="4.25">importance that the intelligence</text>
  <text start="2014.95" dur="6.78">community puts on these very powerful</text>
  <text start="2018.029" dur="6.551">surveillance powers that they have what</text>
  <text start="2021.73" dur="5.429">the fear I think is is that people will</text>
  <text start="2024.58" dur="4.53">want to remove the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="2027.159" dur="3.27">ability to use the tools that they used</text>
  <text start="2029.11" dur="2.58">in 2016</text>
  <text start="2030.429" dur="3.661">against a citizen</text>

  <text start="2036.73" dur="5.82">possible future use of them again in</text>
  <text start="2040.45" dur="5.52">that way and I think that that if you</text>
  <text start="2042.55" dur="6.36">listen to the in the interview that John</text>
  <text start="2045.97" dur="5.82">Solomon and Sarah Carter gave I think it</text>
  <text start="2048.91" dur="5.64">was to live in where they discuss the</text>
  <text start="2051.79" dur="4.17">approach that John Solomon had from</text>
  <text start="2054.55" dur="4.5">members of the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="2055.96" dur="4.59">who said listen this happened this was</text>
  <text start="2059.05" dur="3.84">way early that this happened to John</text>
  <text start="2060.55" dur="5.22">this happened in the government this</text>
  <text start="2062.89" dur="5.76">happened with the spying we are very</text>
  <text start="2065.77" dur="4.98">concerned that if this is not taken care</text>
  <text start="2068.65" dur="4.2">of the right way and it&amp;#39;s not exposed</text>
  <text start="2070.75" dur="4.23">the right way that we will lose our</text>
  <text start="2072.85" dur="7.11">ability to be able to use these tools to</text>
  <text start="2074.98" dur="8.22">protect Americans my opinion on those</text>
  <text start="2079.96" dur="6.93">tools their power etc is not applicable</text>
  <text start="2083.2" dur="6.21">here it will not be probably the popular</text>
  <text start="2086.89" dur="5.07">opinion and I&amp;#39;m not in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="2089.41" dur="4.23">community and I don&amp;#39;t see all of the</text>

  <text start="2096.73" dur="3.57">many terrorists get taken down because</text>
  <text start="2098.8" dur="4.68">we have the intelligence we need to stop</text>

  <text start="2103.48" dur="6.15">people that do use the process correctly</text>
  <text start="2105.4" dur="5.88">I will say that thankfully we did have</text>
  <text start="2109.63" dur="4.47">some members in our government with</text>
  <text start="2111.28" dur="4.89">integrity who noticed the abuse Admiral</text>
  <text start="2114.1" dur="5.37">Rogers and put a foot down to try and</text>
  <text start="2116.17" dur="5.55">stop it and that is is something that</text>
  <text start="2119.47" dur="4.14">gives me a lot of hope to be honest I</text>
  <text start="2121.72" dur="5.55">think there needs to be more regulation</text>
  <text start="2123.61" dur="5.73">and I am NOT a fan of giving up our</text>

  <text start="2134.7" dur="5.47">just not it&amp;#39;s not something that I</text>
  <text start="2137.44" dur="4.89">personally am willing to give up but it</text>
  <text start="2140.17" dur="6.02">is something that has been slowly eroded</text>
  <text start="2142.33" dur="6.3">over time and it has become a key</text>
  <text start="2146.19" dur="3.85">functioning property of our government</text>
  <text start="2148.63" dur="3.18">and how it conducts itself and</text>
  <text start="2150.04" dur="3.93">intelligence and that was a very</text>
  <text start="2151.81" dur="3.81">long-winded comment there and I hope you</text>
  <text start="2153.97" dur="3.21">guys don&amp;#39;t mind but again if you&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="2155.62" dur="3.78">to listen to this interview straight</text>

  <text start="2219.119" dur="5.281">gives the government legitimacy is that</text>

  <text start="2477.54" dur="4.23">of the United States put that on the</text>
  <text start="2479.49" dur="4.86">record he&amp;#39;s very careful about how he</text>
  <text start="2481.77" dur="3.87">speaks when we&amp;#39;re going to get some iffy</text>
  <text start="2484.35" dur="3.24">stuff where people are a little like</text>
  <text start="2485.64" dur="3.54">he&amp;#39;s a little not wishy-washy but</text>
  <text start="2487.59" dur="4.38">non-committal and the reason why is</text>
  <text start="2489.18" dur="4.23">because you can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="2491.97" dur="4.2">Attorney General give an interview and</text>
  <text start="2493.41" dur="4.62">declare a fact in the middle of ongoing</text>

  <text start="2498.03" dur="5.94">have not been publicly publicly</text>
  <text start="2499.65" dur="6.84">disclosed or those facts are crucial to</text>
  <text start="2503.97" dur="3.42">the you know he got to pretend he</text>
  <text start="2506.49" dur="2.43">doesn&amp;#39;t know some things that he</text>
  <text start="2507.39" dur="4.35">actually knows and the things that he</text>
  <text start="2508.92" dur="4.26">says he already knows they&amp;#39;re solid and</text>
  <text start="2511.74" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s nothing that they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="2513.18" dur="6.87">able to do to kind of walk tiptoe around</text>
  <text start="2516.45" dur="4.71">it very important mindset to have when</text>
  <text start="2520.05" dur="3.42">listening to these interviews because</text>
  <text start="2521.16" dur="3.78">people get frustrated like he talks</text>
  <text start="2523.47" dur="3.21">about treason in a little while which</text>
  <text start="2524.94" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;ll get into and explain people get</text>
  <text start="2526.68" dur="4.29">frustrated about that because they feel</text>
  <text start="2528.27" dur="5.28">like he should be declaring treason and</text>
  <text start="2530.97" dur="5.16">the comments on treason has me a little</text>
  <text start="2533.55" dur="7.38">bit confused but we&amp;#39;ll get into it when</text>
  <text start="2536.13" dur="7.65">we get there and that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="2540.93" dur="4.65">that there was not a basis for it that</text>
  <text start="2543.78" dur="3.21">was legitimate I want to see what that</text>
  <text start="2545.58" dur="3.42">basis was and make sure it was</text>
  <text start="2546.99" dur="3.84">legitimate I think that&amp;#39;s one of that</text>
  <text start="2549" dur="4.35">you know one of the key functions of the</text>
  <text start="2550.83" dur="4.56">attorney general core responsibilities</text>
  <text start="2553.35" dur="4.89">of attorney general is to make sure that</text>
  <text start="2555.39" dur="4.47">government powers not abused now you</text>
  <text start="2558.24" dur="4.65">might have gotten a little nervous when</text>
  <text start="2559.86" dur="4.83">he said I&amp;#39;m not saying there wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="2562.89" dur="3.42">legitimate reason for it like</text>
  <text start="2564.69" dur="4.679">screaming in your chair like oh my gosh</text>

  <text start="2575.25" dur="6.51">tell you why I know this next comment</text>
  <text start="2578.089" dur="7.48">and that the rights of Americans are not</text>

  <text start="2587.7" dur="5.94">Attorney General you know the I guess</text>
  <text start="2591.02" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;ve spent like the last two years or</text>
  <text start="2593.64" dur="6.929">more talking about and hearing about</text>
  <text start="2596.3" dur="6.64">Russian influence in elections and what</text>
  <text start="2600.569" dur="5.121">occurred there and so now we&amp;#39;re shifting</text>
  <text start="2602.94" dur="6.6">to talking about actually investigating</text>
  <text start="2605.69" dur="6.97">reviewing that investigation and the</text>
  <text start="2609.54" dur="4.41">people who did that so I guess in making</text>
  <text start="2612.66" dur="2.31">this tournament can you help us</text>
  <text start="2613.95" dur="3.69">understand</text>
  <text start="2614.97" dur="4.53">I mean what&amp;#39;s what is the concern what</text>
  <text start="2617.64" dur="4.8">have you seen I mean what&amp;#39;s the basis</text>
  <text start="2619.5" dur="5.099">for that I don&amp;#39;t want to get you know</text>
  <text start="2622.44" dur="5.61">too much into into the fact we now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2624.599" dur="8.701">still under review but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2628.05" dur="8.039">important to understand what basis there</text>
  <text start="2633.3" dur="4.799">was for launching counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="2636.089" dur="4.77">activities against the political</text>

  <text start="2644.15" dur="4.78">what was the predicate for it how what</text>
  <text start="2647.22" dur="4.23">was the hurdle that had to be crossed</text>
  <text start="2648.93" dur="6.63">what was the process who had to approve</text>
  <text start="2651.45" dur="8.19">it and including the electronic</text>
  <text start="2655.56" dur="7.19">surveillance or valence was done and was</text>
  <text start="2659.64" dur="9.949">everyone operating in their proper lane</text>
  <text start="2662.75" dur="9.97">and I&amp;#39;ve selected you know a terrific</text>

  <text start="2684.06" dur="5.63">and he&amp;#39;s always gotten the most you know</text>
  <text start="2688.02" dur="5.27">laudatory</text>
  <text start="2689.69" dur="5.52">feedback from his work so there&amp;#39;s no</text>

  <text start="2695.21" dur="5.13">going to conduct a thorough and fair</text>
  <text start="2697.07" dur="5.4">review of this and we&amp;#39;re working closely</text>
  <text start="2700.34" dur="4.62">with the intelligence agencies the</text>
  <text start="2702.47" dur="5.94">bureau and the agency and others to help</text>
  <text start="2704.96" dur="5.01">us reconstruct what happened and I want</text>
  <text start="2708.41" dur="4.2">to see what what are the standards that</text>
  <text start="2709.97" dur="5.22">were applied what was the evidence</text>
  <text start="2712.61" dur="4.32">what were the techniques used who</text>
  <text start="2715.19" dur="5.94">approved them was there a legitimate</text>
  <text start="2716.93" dur="6.78">basis for it the Inspector General is</text>
  <text start="2721.13" dur="5.91">looking at only it&amp;#39;s my understanding a</text>
  <text start="2723.71" dur="5.58">small part of this is that correct</text>
  <text start="2727.04" dur="4.44">the FISA warrant yeah I wouldn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="2729.29" dur="5.31">small but he&amp;#39;s looking at a discreet</text>
  <text start="2731.48" dur="4.02">area that is that is you know important</text>
  <text start="2734.6" dur="4.11">which is the use of electronic</text>
  <text start="2735.5" dur="7.2">surveillance that was targeted at Carter</text>
  <text start="2738.71" dur="5.46">page and could he have it just could you</text>
  <text start="2742.7" dur="2.7">just said I want to expand this</text>
  <text start="2744.17" dur="4.47">investigation why did you feel it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2745.4" dur="4.64">necessary to turn to 2 John Durr well</text>
  <text start="2748.64" dur="5.88">the inspector general at the Department</text>
  <text start="2750.04" dur="7.9">Mike Horowitz who is a superb government</text>
  <text start="2754.52" dur="5.01">official he has limited powers he</text>
  <text start="2757.94" dur="3.59">doesn&amp;#39;t have the power to compel</text>
  <text start="2759.53" dur="6.59">testimony he doesn&amp;#39;t have the power</text>
  <text start="2761.53" dur="7.09">really to investigate beyond the current</text>
  <text start="2766.12" dur="4.75">cast of characters at the Department of</text>
  <text start="2768.62" dur="6.39">Justice his ability to get information</text>
  <text start="2770.87" dur="6.06">from former officials or from other</text>
  <text start="2775.01" dur="4.68">agencies that side the department is</text>
  <text start="2776.93" dur="4.71">very limited so he wouldn&amp;#39;t been able to</text>
  <text start="2779.69" dur="3.21">go and try to speak with some of the</text>
  <text start="2781.64" dur="3.99">former officials who are making these</text>
  <text start="2782.9" dur="6.48">decisions necessarily right if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2785.63" dur="7.05">not in the department in work what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2789.38" dur="5.61">status of humours investigation in Utah</text>
  <text start="2792.68" dur="3.87">I think the former attorney general</text>
  <text start="2794.99" dur="6.87">sessions had asked him to look at this</text>
  <text start="2796.55" dur="9.27">right so Huber had originally been asked</text>
  <text start="2801.86" dur="6.24">to take a look at the FISA applications</text>
  <text start="2805.82" dur="4.53">in the electronic surveillance but then</text>
  <text start="2808.1" dur="4.8">he stood back and put that on hold while</text>
  <text start="2810.35" dur="4.11">the Office of Inspector General was</text>
  <text start="2812.9" dur="3.27">conducting its review which would have</text>
  <text start="2814.46" dur="5.33">been normal for the department and he</text>
  <text start="2816.17" dur="6.47">was essentially on standby in case</text>
  <text start="2819.79" dur="5.73">mr. Horowitz referred a matter to him to</text>
  <text start="2822.64" dur="6.42">be handled criminally so he has not been</text>
  <text start="2825.52" dur="9.77">active on this front in recent months</text>
  <text start="2829.06" dur="8.82">and so Durham is taking over that role</text>
  <text start="2835.29" dur="4.54">now everybody got scared oh my god</text>
  <text start="2837.88" dur="3.6">whoever is doing nothing this was all a</text>
  <text start="2839.83" dur="3.75">big waste of time he hasn&amp;#39;t referred to</text>
  <text start="2841.48" dur="6.06">anybody this is all a nonsense thing</text>
  <text start="2843.58" dur="7.7">everybody freaked out mm-hmm no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2847.54" dur="5.79">not true I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about it now</text>
  <text start="2851.28" dur="6.24">Durham has been doing this since at</text>
  <text start="2853.33" dur="6.57">least October of last year</text>
  <text start="2857.52" dur="4.33">what does hubert have been doing what</text>
  <text start="2859.9" dur="3.3">has John Hooper been doing Joe jevetta</text>
  <text start="2861.85" dur="3.06">Jennifer comes out and says he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2863.2" dur="4.29">doing anything then he&amp;#39;s doing something</text>
  <text start="2864.91" dur="4.02">he&amp;#39;s working on the leaks he&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2867.49" dur="2.94">working on uranium one but he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2868.93" dur="3.689">even interview earth they are person</text>
  <text start="2870.43" dur="3.54">then he&amp;#39;s doing something else nobody</text>
  <text start="2872.619" dur="5.821">really knows what John Huber is doing</text>
  <text start="2873.97" dur="7.74">but Bill bar tells us he tells us right</text>
  <text start="2878.44" dur="6.06">now the other issues he&amp;#39;s been working</text>
  <text start="2881.71" dur="5.01">on relate to Hillary Clinton those are</text>
  <text start="2884.5" dur="4.859">winding down and hopefully we&amp;#39;ll be in a</text>
  <text start="2886.72" dur="8.12">position to bring those to fruition so</text>
  <text start="2889.359" dur="8.611">he what those are winding down and</text>
  <text start="2894.84" dur="4.54">hopefully we&amp;#39;ll be able to bring those</text>
  <text start="2897.97" dur="5.33">to fruition</text>
  <text start="2899.38" dur="6.05">what does fruition mean charges</text>
  <text start="2903.3" dur="5.11">indictments</text>
  <text start="2905.43" dur="5.8">that&amp;#39;s legalese I want to explain</text>
  <text start="2908.41" dur="6.69">something people are gonna jump</text>
  <text start="2911.23" dur="6.389">immediately to the quote whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="2915.1" dur="5.46">that testified in front of Congress in</text>
  <text start="2917.619" dur="4.831">front of meadows and I want everybody to</text>
  <text start="2920.56" dur="4.59">take a deep breath and just hear me out</text>
  <text start="2922.45" dur="4.32">here okay John Huber was supposed to</text>
  <text start="2925.15" dur="3.93">come in and testify in front of Congress</text>
  <text start="2926.77" dur="5.33">about his investigations and what he was</text>
  <text start="2929.08" dur="6.87">doing in terms of the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="2932.1" dur="6.759">he was scheduled to come in George Bush</text>
  <text start="2935.95" dur="5.19">died they postponed the hearing then he</text>
  <text start="2938.859" dur="3.931">said he wasn&amp;#39;t coming in and everybody</text>
  <text start="2941.14" dur="3.66">said well he&amp;#39;s not doing anything he</text>
  <text start="2942.79" dur="6.54">won&amp;#39;t even come and testify and I said</text>
  <text start="2944.8" dur="6.059">good because you don&amp;#39;t want if you were</text>
  <text start="2949.33" dur="4.23">to come in and sit down and talk to</text>
  <text start="2950.859" dur="5.041">Congress about his investigation we</text>
  <text start="2953.56" dur="4.53">would have known that in there that it</text>
  <text start="2955.9" dur="3.99">was over there was nothing else there</text>
  <text start="2958.09" dur="4.29">there were not going to be indictments</text>
  <text start="2959.89" dur="5.55">and it was done because there is no way</text>
  <text start="2962.38" dur="5.58">on God&amp;#39;s green earth that a US Attorney</text>
  <text start="2965.44" dur="5.16">investigating a crime of that magnitude</text>
  <text start="2967.96" dur="4.83">is going to come in sit down in front of</text>
  <text start="2970.6" dur="5.4">Congress and discuss his investigations</text>
  <text start="2972.79" dur="5.04">now in a month or two or three or</text>
  <text start="2976" dur="3.15">however long it takes if they come</text>
  <text start="2977.83" dur="3.15">forward and say we investigated the</text>
  <text start="2979.15" dur="4.71">Clinton Foundation and Mittman found no</text>
  <text start="2980.98" dur="4.29">wrongdoing then again like I said on my</text>
  <text start="2983.86" dur="3.3">Twitter when I&amp;#39;m wrong you guys can</text>
  <text start="2985.27" dur="4.2">throw tomatoes at me all you want I have</text>
  <text start="2987.16" dur="4.8">no way of knowing whether or not they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2989.47" dur="4.17">going to press charges all I have is</text>
  <text start="2991.96" dur="3.54">open source information which tells me</text>
  <text start="2993.64" dur="3.69">what&amp;#39;s going on and that was one of the</text>
  <text start="2995.5" dur="3.42">things that always bothered me if he</text>
  <text start="2997.33" dur="3.33">were to come and sit down that he was</text>
  <text start="2998.92" dur="3.21">not working on this investigation any</text>
  <text start="3000.66" dur="3.69">longer and that we hadn&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="3002.13" dur="4.62">indictments from it he did not sit and</text>
  <text start="3004.35" dur="4.11">testify everybody flipped out about that</text>
  <text start="3006.75" dur="3.33">saying that he was not doing anything</text>
  <text start="3008.46" dur="5.13">and blah blah blah I looked at it a</text>
  <text start="3010.08" dur="6.03">little bit differently in addition the</text>
  <text start="3013.59" dur="4.02">whistleblowers that came forward they</text>
  <text start="3016.11" dur="2.79">called themselves whistleblowers not</text>
  <text start="3017.61" dur="3.21">because they worked inside of the</text>
  <text start="3018.9" dur="5.58">Clinton Foundation but because they</text>
  <text start="3020.82" dur="6.36">worked for a group that looks for tax</text>
  <text start="3024.48" dur="5.18">avoidance tax malfeasance and then when</text>
  <text start="3027.18" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;d uncover this tax malfeasance</text>
  <text start="3029.66" dur="8.11">during under a law that is on the books</text>
  <text start="3033.09" dur="7.11">they can collect dollars based off of</text>
  <text start="3037.77" dur="5.49">whatever is recovered from the agencies</text>
  <text start="3040.2" dur="4.95">that are avoiding those taxes so since</text>
  <text start="3043.26" dur="3.6">the Clinton Foundation is supposed to be</text>
  <text start="3045.15" dur="3.63">a not-for-profit and they knew that</text>
  <text start="3046.86" dur="4.17">there was all kinds of malfeasance going</text>
  <text start="3048.78" dur="4.05">on with them these people took it upon</text>
  <text start="3051.03" dur="3.39">themselves to work for years to try and</text>
  <text start="3052.83" dur="3.21">uncover all of the things that they were</text>
  <text start="3054.42" dur="4.47">doing wrong and then provide that</text>
  <text start="3056.04" dur="4.92">information to the IRS so they then they</text>
  <text start="3058.89" dur="5.04">in turn could be compensated for their</text>
  <text start="3060.96" dur="4.53">time they went and and were asked to go</text>
  <text start="3063.93" dur="5.04">and sit in front of Congress to have a</text>
  <text start="3065.49" dur="5.37">conversation about this they did while</text>
  <text start="3068.97" dur="4.05">they were there they said they had sent</text>
  <text start="3070.86" dur="4.17">this information to Huber that they</text>
  <text start="3073.02" dur="3.63">didn&amp;#39;t hear anything that they followed</text>
  <text start="3075.03" dur="3.75">up again and sent it back to him again</text>

  <text start="3220.82" dur="3.54">you know the penetration of civil rights</text>
  <text start="3222.77" dur="4.46">groups because at the time there was</text>
  <text start="3224.36" dur="5.19">concerns about contacts with you know</text>
  <text start="3227.23" dur="4.66">communists funded front groups and</text>

  <text start="3337.9" dur="5.67">probably more questions and that some of</text>
  <text start="3340.06" dur="5.67">the facts that that I&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="3343.57" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t hang together with the official</text>

  <text start="3502.15" dur="4.65">problem that&amp;#39;s endemic to the FBI I</text>
  <text start="3504.13" dur="4.92">think there was probably a failure among</text>
  <text start="3506.8" dur="4.44">a group of leaders there at the upper</text>
  <text start="3509.05" dur="4.83">echelon that&amp;#39;s right so there was</text>
  <text start="3511.24" dur="4.56">probably a failure among a group of</text>
  <text start="3513.88" dur="6">leaders there at the other upper echelon</text>
  <text start="3515.8" dur="6.78">right in other words I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="3519.88" dur="4.02">this is a problem we don&amp;#39;t right through</text>
  <text start="3522.58" dur="5.13">the through the bureau</text>
  <text start="3523.9" dur="6.21">what suggest you there was a failure in</text>
  <text start="3527.71" dur="8.67">the upper echelon at the FBI well gee I</text>
  <text start="3530.11" dur="8.67">don&amp;#39;t know she&amp;#39;s a good interviewer I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3536.38" dur="5.4">give her that because I think the</text>

  <text start="3541.78" dur="3.81">group at the top which is one of the</text>
  <text start="3543.52" dur="4.31">probably the mistakes that has been made</text>
  <text start="3545.59" dur="4.83">instead of running this as a normal</text>

  <text start="4012.289" dur="4.14">a lot of that has to do with how good</text>

  <text start="4016.429" dur="4.201">know Muller has spent two and a half</text>

  <text start="4311.449" dur="4.621">expect it yeah yeah because I realized</text>
  <text start="4313.309" dur="7.051">we live in a crazy hyper partisan period</text>
  <text start="4316.07" dur="6.06">of time and I knew that it would only be</text>
  <text start="4320.36" dur="3.87">a matter of time if I was behaving</text>
  <text start="4322.13" dur="4.65">responsibly and calling them as I see</text>
  <text start="4324.23" dur="4.079">them that I&amp;#39;d be attacked because</text>
  <text start="4326.78" dur="3.359">nowadays people don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="4328.309" dur="4.261">merits or the substance they only care</text>
  <text start="4330.139" dur="4.44">about who it helps you know who benefits</text>
  <text start="4332.57" dur="3.75">whether my side benefits or the other</text>
  <text start="4334.579" dur="4.861">side benefits everything is gauged by</text>
  <text start="4336.32" dur="4.919">politics and as I say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4339.44" dur="4.23">antithetical to the way the department</text>
  <text start="4341.239" dur="4.86">runs and any Attorney General in this</text>
  <text start="4343.67" dur="4.44">period is going to end up losing a lot</text>
  <text start="4346.099" dur="4.23">of political capital and I realized that</text>
  <text start="4348.11" dur="4.08">and that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons that I</text>
  <text start="4350.329" dur="4.92">ultimately was persuaded that maybe I</text>
  <text start="4352.19" dur="3.36">should take it on because who persuaded</text>
  <text start="4355.249" dur="3.841">him</text>
  <text start="4355.55" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s my question I I think it my stage</text>
  <text start="4359.09" dur="5.73">in life it really doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="4360.32" dur="7.649">difference into your career I&amp;#39;m at the</text>
  <text start="4364.82" dur="4.89">end of my career I&amp;#39;ve you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="4367.969" dur="4.11">reputation that you&amp;#39;ve worked your whole</text>
  <text start="4369.71" dur="5.82">life on though yeah but everyone dies</text>
  <text start="4372.079" dur="5.19">and I&amp;#39;m not you know you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4375.53" dur="3.779">believe in the homeric idea that you</text>
  <text start="4377.269" dur="4.41">know immortality comes by you know</text>
  <text start="4379.309" dur="4.98">having owed some of them over the</text>

  <text start="4396.079" dur="6.021">the Department of Justice I love the FBI</text>
  <text start="4399.19" dur="4.98">I think it&amp;#39;s important that we not in in</text>
  <text start="4402.1" dur="6.33">this period of intense partisan feeling</text>
  <text start="4404.17" dur="7.26">to destroy our institutions I think one</text>
  <text start="4408.43" dur="5.37">of the ironies today is that people are</text>
  <text start="4411.43" dur="4.62">saying that it&amp;#39;s President Trump</text>
  <text start="4413.8" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s shredding our institutions I</text>

  <text start="4420.55" dur="5.49">bill of particulars as to how that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4422.44" dur="5.94">being done from my perspective the idea</text>
  <text start="4426.04" dur="4.26">of resisting a democratically elected</text>
  <text start="4428.38" dur="6.36">president and basically throwing</text>
