  <text start="1.89" dur="3.3">line Julian welcome back to the program</text>
  <text start="3.27" dur="3.75">thank you for being with us today Tony I</text>
  <text start="5.19" dur="4.56">know you follow the news closely I know</text>
  <text start="7.02" dur="5.22">you see the narrative now there is a big</text>
  <text start="9.75" dur="4.71">brouhaha in the United States the same</text>
  <text start="12.24" dur="4.139">media by the way that WikiLeaks exposed</text>
  <text start="14.46" dur="4.649">as colluding with Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="16.379" dur="4.591">campaign with near hysteria getting up</text>
  <text start="19.109" dur="4.17">to the president and John Podesta with</text>
  <text start="20.97" dur="4.77">Hillary&amp;#39;s campaign claiming over and</text>
  <text start="23.279" dur="4.951">over and over again that it&amp;#39;s clear the</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="4.56">CIA says so even though there&amp;#39;s no new</text>
  <text start="28.23" dur="4.079">evidence whatsoever that we didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="4.05">prior to the election and that the FBI</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="3.421">contradicts and James clapper the</text>
  <text start="34.35" dur="3.66">national director of intelligence</text>
  <text start="35.73" dur="4.38">contradicts that in fact the Russians</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="3.72">tried to influence and the elections and</text>
  <text start="40.11" dur="3.39">and this hacked information came from</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="4.8">them and you&amp;#39;re saying that is outright</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="4.62">false that&amp;#39;s a Alfa is not the</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="2.25">Russian government so in other words let</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="3.119">me be clear</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="4.68">Russia did not give you the Podesta</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="4.71">documents or anything from the DNC</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="4.829">but Kurt can you confirm whether or not</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="6.961">you have information involving hacked</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="7.02">info from the RNC we received about</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="6.87">three pages information to do with the</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="5.941">RNC and Trump but it was already public</text>
  <text start="69.78" dur="3.03">somewhere else okay so in other words</text>
  <text start="71.25" dur="3.54">there was nothing significant there was</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="4.5">nothing comparable to what happened so</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="4.619">what Reince Priebus said on NBC to Chuck</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="4.14">Todd this weekend was true and NBC had</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="3.541">it wrong well as far as where where else</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="3.75">as far as you&amp;#39;re aware of yeah now the</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="4.8">CIA supposedly says the Russians</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="4.08">definitely tried to influence the u.s.</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="4.77">election what is your thoughts on that I</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="5.67">think it&amp;#39;s very interesting the key</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="4.349">quote and our for us is from James</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="4.89">clapper on the 17th November James</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="4.771">clapper is the head of the DNI is a</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="5.52">Director of National Intelligence who</text>
  <text start="101.64" dur="6.839">oversees all 17 US intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="5.25">and so his statement is as far as the</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="4.831">WikiLeaks connection this is made to the</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="5.07">House Intelligence Committee as far as</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="4.23">the WikiLeaks connection the evidence is</text>
  <text start="115.68" dur="3.539">not strong and we don&amp;#39;t have a good</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="3.439">insight into the sequencing of their</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="3.9">releases or when the data may have been</text>
  <text start="120.979" dur="4.18">provided we don&amp;#39;t have good insight into</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="3.6">that so let me let me for the sake of</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="3.3">our audience Julian let me play the</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="3.93">exact quote this is James clapper the</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="4.901">Director of National Intelligence saying</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="5.891">exactly what you did that in fact the</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="6.72">in government well what he exactly said</text>
  <text start="136.54" dur="5.58">that in fact he was very very clear in</text>
  <text start="140.08" dur="3.96">saying that WikiLeaks connection with</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="5.91">Russian hacking is not strong but as far</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="7.98">as the WikiLeaks a connection the</text>
  <text start="148.03" dur="6.45">evidence there is not as strong and we</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t have good insight into the</text>
  <text start="154.48" dur="5.46">sequencing of the releases or when that</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="4.44">when the data may have been provided we</text>
  <text start="159.94" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t have as good insight into</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="5.64">that so that confirms exactly what</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re saying can you answer whether or</text>
  <text start="167.86" dur="4.59">not there there&amp;#39;s a report out today and</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="4.919">there was a report out earlier this week</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="4.56">that in fact they can trace back some</text>
  <text start="175.209" dur="3.78">leaks to the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="6.11">Security as it relates to the state of</text>
  <text start="178.989" dur="9.361">Georgia do you know anything about those</text>
  <text start="183.12" dur="8.41">I looked when the look let&amp;#39;s pull back a</text>
  <text start="188.35" dur="5.97">bit because there&amp;#39;s a deliberate attempt</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="6.679">this week to conflate a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="194.32" dur="8.34">different issues together it seems to be</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="8.921">as a desire an extremely dangerous and</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="7.02">foolish desire to flip members of the</text>
  <text start="207.13" dur="4.74">u.s. electoral college around into</text>
  <text start="209.68" dur="5.43">getting up John Kasich or Hillary</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="6.6">Clinton on the 19th no it&amp;#39;s foolish</text>
  <text start="215.11" dur="5.76">because it won&amp;#39;t happen it&amp;#39;s dangerous</text>
  <text start="218.47" dur="5.64">because the argument that it should</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="4.89">happen can be used in four years time or</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="3.78">eight years time for a sitting</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="4.47">government that doesn&amp;#39;t want to hand</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="5.67">over power and that&amp;#39;s a very dangerous</text>
  <text start="230.23" dur="5.1">thing there&amp;#39;s Clinton aligned PACs</text>
  <text start="233.56" dur="3.989">putting out ads and lots of celebrities</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.53">trying to push these electors to do it</text>
  <text start="237.549" dur="4.651">so how are they rhetorically going about</text>
  <text start="239.86" dur="5.37">it well there&amp;#39;s our publications it did</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="4.8">make a significant influence during</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="3.539">elections lots and lots of Americans</text>
  <text start="247" dur="3.209">took them up read them analyzed and</text>
  <text start="248.769" dur="3.69">forwarded them to each other I was the</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="2.721">most discussed topic according to</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="3.391">Facebook</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="5.2">throughout October okay but then we have</text>
  <text start="255.85" dur="4.05">US intelligence saying they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="4.74">how we got our start for when we got it</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="5.88">and us saying we didn&amp;#39;t get it from a</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="3.87">state then there&amp;#39;s hacking of various</text>
  <text start="265.78" dur="3.87">systems sort of a</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="4.769">okay presumably to get intelligence the</text>
  <text start="269.65" dur="4.29">Israelis do it the Russians do it the</text>
  <text start="271.509" dur="4.081">Chinese do it the French do it every</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="3.659">year and every election cycle to</text>
  <text start="275.59" dur="4.699">understand what policies are so it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="277.599" dur="5.371">surprise at all that there&amp;#39;s record of</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="4.621">Russians or others hacking a lot of</text>
  <text start="282.97" dur="3.93">these systems so let me put the question</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="4.36">let me put this a different way the</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="5.04">state of Georgia in the United States</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="6.42">the Secretary of State there now</text>
  <text start="291.94" dur="6.15">confirms 10 separate cyberattacks on its</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.069">network that were all traced back to the</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="3.6">US Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="299.759" dur="4.03">addresses do you know anything about</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="4.289">that I don&amp;#39;t know about this specific</text>
  <text start="303.789" dur="4.531">case but the state are hacking I do know</text>
  <text start="305.979" dur="4.671">about because I followed it when it</text>
  <text start="308.32" dur="5.43">first came up in the original FBI report</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="6.1">look these are about election voter</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="5.97">registration systems not election not</text>
  <text start="316.75" dur="4.77">vote counting systems right it seems to</text>
  <text start="319.72" dur="4.289">be just basic identity theft if you if</text>
  <text start="321.52" dur="4.26">you read what DHS said at a time it said</text>
  <text start="324.009" dur="4.47">that look like these we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="325.78" dur="5.85">sold online in black markets it really</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="5.22">is the FSB going to be selling voter</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="4.56">registration records online in black</text>
  <text start="333.699" dur="4.621">markets no of course it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="3.12">overwhelmingly likely that it is just</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="4.05">identity theft</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="5.19">let me ask are the DHS our attacks are</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="4.5">concerned that could be a number of</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="5.31">things it could be the DHS just testing</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="5.4">security and then people using the logs</text>
  <text start="349.81" dur="4.32">of those tests rather misusing them to</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="3.72">try and claim that there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="354.13" dur="4.259">attempted hacks of these systems well I</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="4.29">certainly respect and and by the way it</text>
  <text start="358.389" dur="3.81">is important to point out some of your</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="5.1">history when you were 16 years old you</text>
  <text start="362.199" dur="4.801">did hack into NASA you did hack into the</text>
  <text start="365.38" dur="3.509">Department of Defense and I believe one</text>
  <text start="367" dur="5.49">other agency is that true there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="368.889" dur="4.921">number book saying that ok so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="4.169">pretty good chance that might be true</text>
  <text start="373.81" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ve never been charged for that yeah</text>
  <text start="376.659" dur="3.26">that&amp;#39;s true maybe the statute of</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="4.86">limitations has moved on I have said I</text>
  <text start="379.919" dur="4.601">have said that there are two things that</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="3.84">America needs to take from you and some</text>
  <text start="384.52" dur="4.019">of these other high profile cases and</text>
  <text start="386.53" dur="3.9">one is there&amp;#39;s proof positive that we</text>
  <text start="388.539" dur="4.291">don&amp;#39;t really have cyber security at a</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="4.109">level we need for a country that is so</text>
  <text start="392.83" dur="4.29">actively involved in intelligence and</text>
  <text start="394.539" dur="4.111">and influencing world events etc so</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;ve done us a favor because now we</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="3.09">could fix the problem of who</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="3.54">so desired but in all the years</text>
  <text start="401.74" dur="3.81">President Obama has been in office he</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="3.72">did nothing to fix it the second thing</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="3.72">that I think you you did for America</text>
  <text start="407.44" dur="3.63">which i think is very important is you</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="3.239">exposed how corrupt our government is</text>
  <text start="411.07" dur="4.08">and I&amp;#39;ll get to that in a second without</text>
  <text start="412.509" dur="5.16">revealing your sources would it be fair</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="5.489">to say that the information as it</text>
  <text start="417.669" dur="4.771">relates to WikiLeaks and John Podesta Z</text>
  <text start="420.639" dur="5.31">mails came from within the United States</text>
  <text start="422.44" dur="6.47">to you we have said it has not come from</text>
  <text start="425.949" dur="5.071">a state party we know where it came from</text>
  <text start="428.91" dur="5.979">originally of course it&amp;#39;s John Podesta</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s from the DNC etc there&amp;#39;s been no</text>
  <text start="434.889" dur="4.56">claim that has been held up tonight and</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="4.979">sorry to maintained anymore hearted any</text>
  <text start="439.449" dur="5.19">of the information has been modified or</text>
  <text start="441.699" dur="5.161">is fake so you can&amp;#39;t confirm or deny if</text>
  <text start="444.639" dur="4.051">this information came from within the</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="4.589">United States I</text>
  <text start="448.69" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re unhappy that we felt that we</text>
  <text start="451.449" dur="5.101">needed to even say then it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="5.79">state party normally we say nothing at</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="5.91">all but we we have a conflict of</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="4.64">interest how we have a excellent</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="4.53">reputation a strong interest in</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="3.97">protecting our sources and so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="3.84">never saying anything about them ever</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="4.26">ruling anyone in or anyone out sometimes</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="4.019">do it we don&amp;#39;t like to do it we have</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="4.049">another interest which is maximizing the</text>
  <text start="474.849" dur="5.671">impact of our publications let me ask a</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="5.371">listener here in order to order to</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="3.99">prevent a distraction attack against our</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="4.469">publications we&amp;#39;ve had to come out and</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="4.499">say no it&amp;#39;s not a state party stop</text>
  <text start="486.729" dur="4.171">trying to distract in that way pay</text>
  <text start="489.009" dur="3.331">attention to the content of the</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="3.57">publication so in other words when you</text>
  <text start="492.34" dur="4.829">say state party wasn&amp;#39;t another state</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="4.949">like Russia or some other country record</text>
  <text start="497.169" dur="4.051">let me ask you about WikiLeaks and I</text>
  <text start="499.419" dur="5.34">think this could shake up the political</text>
  <text start="501.22" dur="5.49">world is it true an email sent in July</text>
  <text start="504.759" dur="4.38">of this year that you have that</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="4.29">describes how funds could be diverted</text>

  <text start="533.56" dur="4.68">is that a legitimate I don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="536.26" dur="4.53">in front of me we have we have published</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="4.41">nearly a hundred thousand documents so I</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="3.93">mean I have seen references to things</text>
  <text start="542.65" dur="5.1">like that I don&amp;#39;t recall seeing an</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="5.13">eyes-only phrase do you recall any quid</text>

  <text start="549.85" dur="4.77">Graham that that he would get some</text>

  <text start="554.62" dur="4.05">ran for re-election for the Senate I</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="5.52">believe in 2020 I don&amp;#39;t know Lindsey</text>
  <text start="558.67" dur="4.44">Graham is in the participating mouth yes</text>
  <text start="561.88" dur="2.76">all right well that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="3.84">maybe hopefully over time we&amp;#39;d be able</text>
  <text start="564.64" dur="4.02">to follow up on I have a live so many</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="5.16">more questions for you let me let me ask</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="6.81">you a couple of these do you think the</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="5.79">president knows as you do that the</text>

  <text start="577.9" dur="3.81">I think it&amp;#39;s important to point out that</text>
  <text start="579.22" dur="4.619">for over 10 years WikiLeaks has never</text>
  <text start="581.71" dur="4.22">been proven wrong not one single time do</text>

  <text start="588.4" dur="4.08">delegitimize Donald Trump yes do you</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s clear if you look at the statements</text>
  <text start="592.48" dur="4.53">by James clapper you also made an</text>

  <text start="712.9" dur="6.15">Trump would win why I didn&amp;#39;t think he</text>
  <text start="716.35" dur="5.55">would win I thought he had a much higher</text>
  <text start="719.05" dur="6.09">chance than what the polling was giving</text>
  <text start="721.9" dur="5.66">I gone through brexit and a very similar</text>
  <text start="725.14" dur="6.38">case in brexit where you had a new</text>
  <text start="727.56" dur="6.99">nationalist feeling in the country and</text>
  <text start="731.52" dur="5.74">disenfranchisement with existing elites</text>
  <text start="734.55" dur="4.5">but there was polling a number of</text>
  <text start="737.26" dur="8.1">professional pulses coming up to brexit</text>
  <text start="739.05" dur="8.17">and i got it wrong because people misled</text>
  <text start="745.36" dur="4.53">the pollsters in two different ways and</text>
  <text start="747.22" dur="5.37">to be frank the poll some of the polls</text>
  <text start="749.89" dur="4.2">also wanted to be misled but so those</text>
  <text start="752.59" dur="6.15">people who were going to vote against</text>
  <text start="754.09" dur="6.3">brexit so that they were going to vote</text>
  <text start="758.74" dur="3.57">for it and most people who are going to</text>
  <text start="760.39" dur="4.56">vote for it says they&amp;#39;re going to vote</text>
  <text start="762.31" dur="5.16">event against it the same thing happened</text>
  <text start="764.95" dur="5.03">it seems in the case of Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="767.47" dur="6.33">election so why is that there was</text>
  <text start="769.98" dur="7.78">intense pressure in the United States</text>
  <text start="773.8" dur="6.93">from the mainstream media to make people</text>
  <text start="777.76" dur="6.06">feel ashamed of wanting to vote for</text>
  <text start="780.73" dur="4.53">Donald Trump and to make them feel like</text>
  <text start="783.82" dur="2.79">that they had to vote for Hillary</text>
  <text start="785.26" dur="4.02">Clinton even though they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="786.61" dur="6.78">actually I think it&amp;#39;s this second case</text>
  <text start="789.28" dur="6.06">of of Hillary Clinton supporters falsely</text>
  <text start="793.39" dur="4.53">telling pollsters that they would vote</text>
  <text start="795.34" dur="4.32">for her and they&amp;#39;re not doing it that</text>
  <text start="797.92" dur="3.18">made the difference in the election so I</text>
  <text start="799.66" dur="4.94">I had assumed that</text>
  <text start="801.1" dur="5.97">these pollsters had seen the the brexit</text>
  <text start="804.6" dur="4.24">situation and they taken that into</text>
  <text start="807.07" dur="4.52">account they said that they had taken it</text>
  <text start="808.84" dur="7.38">into account and that was not true now</text>
  <text start="811.59" dur="7.15">very interestingly I think that if the</text>
  <text start="816.22" dur="6.12">polling had been accurate Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="818.74" dur="4.2">wouldn&amp;#39;t have won interesting now why do</text>
  <text start="822.34" dur="3.54">I say that</text>
  <text start="822.94" dur="4.53">well well Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign</text>
  <text start="825.88" dur="1.98">outspent Donald Trump by almost two to</text>
  <text start="827.47" dur="6.12">one</text>
  <text start="827.86" dur="8.13">if the polling had been accurate bankers</text>
  <text start="833.59" dur="5.22">and other cashed up interests would have</text>
  <text start="835.99" dur="5.7">given hillary clinton you know another</text>
  <text start="838.81" dur="4.59">five billion dollars and she would have</text>
  <text start="841.69" dur="3.48">blasted that and advertising everywhere</text>
  <text start="843.4" dur="2.94">but they didn&amp;#39;t give her all that money</text>
  <text start="845.17" dur="3.63">because they didn&amp;#39;t perceive that there</text>
  <text start="846.34" dur="5.25">was a need to because she seemed that</text>
  <text start="848.8" dur="6.81">she was four or five points ahead in the</text>
  <text start="851.59" dur="5.85">polls so they got fooled by the polling</text>
  <text start="855.61" dur="4.44">and therefore it didn&amp;#39;t spend the amount</text>
  <text start="857.44" dur="4.08">of money that they needed to on the</text>
  <text start="860.05" dur="4.41">campaign and didn&amp;#39;t recruit other</text>
  <text start="861.52" dur="5.82">resources to you know recruit even more</text>
  <text start="864.46" dur="4.77">mainstream media resources to beat up</text>
  <text start="867.34" dur="3.45">trump and to defend clinton because they</text>
  <text start="869.23" dur="3">didn&amp;#39;t think there was a need to let me</text>
  <text start="870.79" dur="4.08">ask you you remember when the new york</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="5.07">times was going full throttle with the</text>
  <text start="874.87" dur="4.5">story about Donald Trump&amp;#39;s taxes which</text>
  <text start="877.3" dur="3.84">was stolen information at the time and</text>
  <text start="879.37" dur="3.75">and everybody in the media thought it</text>
  <text start="881.14" dur="3.6">was fair and it was legitimate coverage</text>
  <text start="883.12" dur="4.74">and they get how they got ahold of it</text>
  <text start="884.74" dur="6.21">was not an issue in any way you view</text>
  <text start="887.86" dur="5.06">yourself and you view WikiLeaks the same</text>
  <text start="890.95" dur="4.83">way you view yourself as a journalist</text>
  <text start="892.92" dur="5.05">information came to you and you</text>
  <text start="895.78" dur="3.6">disseminated that information because</text>
  <text start="897.97" dur="3.96">you felt the public had a right to know</text>
  <text start="899.38" dur="5.19">what is the difference between what you</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="5.16">and WikiLeaks have done versus what the</text>
  <text start="904.57" dur="5.51">New York Times and CNN does when they</text>
  <text start="907.09" dur="7.34">publish Donald Trump&amp;#39;s taxes that were</text>
  <text start="910.08" dur="6.76">that were received illegally or received</text>
  <text start="914.43" dur="7.39">there is a difference our stuff has more</text>
  <text start="916.84" dur="7.95">impact well that&amp;#39;s okay I keep to Shea I</text>
  <text start="921.82" dur="5.85">can&amp;#39;t disagree with that yeah very good</text>
  <text start="924.79" dur="4.95">point but but in other words you do view</text>
  <text start="927.67" dur="3.51">WikiLeaks one of the things in the in</text>
  <text start="929.74" dur="4.72">the conversations that I&amp;#39;ve had with you</text>
  <text start="931.18" dur="5.68">both on radio and TV is how</text>
  <text start="934.46" dur="4.62">important it is for you to maintain a</text>
  <text start="936.86" dur="4.38">perfect record and not get anything</text>
  <text start="939.08" dur="5.52">wrong in terms of the information that</text>
  <text start="941.24" dur="5.28">you acquire that you release you want it</text>
  <text start="944.6" dur="4.05">to be right and so far you&amp;#39;ve been right</text>
  <text start="946.52" dur="4.41">every time so if I were being right for</text>
  <text start="948.65" dur="4.53">since we were founded a decade ago yeah</text>
  <text start="950.93" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a very valuable thing to</text>
  <text start="953.18" dur="3.21">have that perfect record it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="954.62" dur="5.28">curse because we have to work so hard to</text>
  <text start="956.39" dur="5.04">keep it understood and my big fear 10</text>
  <text start="959.9" dur="3.63">years ago which you and I discussed the</text>
  <text start="961.43" dur="4.62">last time you were on my radio show when</text>
  <text start="963.53" dur="4.29">I wanted you arrested I said because I</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="5.43">felt you would release potential</text>
  <text start="967.82" dur="6.3">information that would result in methods</text>
  <text start="971.48" dur="5.07">and people potentially dying because</text>
  <text start="974.12" dur="5.07">there is so much in terms of covert</text>
  <text start="976.55" dur="4.68">operations people working undercover you</text>
  <text start="979.19" dur="3.26">purposely choose not to publish that</text>
  <text start="981.23" dur="5.64">information correct</text>
  <text start="982.45" dur="6.73">well yes there was 15,000 documents that</text>
  <text start="986.87" dur="3.72">we didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t release in there</text>
  <text start="989.18" dur="4.38">because you thought people&amp;#39;s lives would</text>
  <text start="990.59" dur="5.43">be in jeopardy immediately no but we</text>
  <text start="993.56" dur="5.13">thought that there was a reasonable</text>
  <text start="996.02" dur="5.64">possibility so that we wanted to study</text>
  <text start="998.69" dur="6.06">the issue further so we didn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1001.66" dur="4.68">that people&amp;#39;s lives would definitely be</text>
  <text start="1004.75" dur="3.87">in jeopardy but we weren&amp;#39;t sure so we</text>
  <text start="1006.34" dur="4.92">wanted to hold things back - we</text>
  <text start="1008.62" dur="3.93">understood it yeah all right I have a</text>
  <text start="1011.26" dur="2.88">lot more questions for you let me let me</text>
  <text start="1012.55" dur="3.24">ask you a few of these because I think</text>
  <text start="1014.14" dur="3.27">this is very important for our audience</text>
  <text start="1015.79" dur="5.37">to fully completely grasp and to</text>
  <text start="1017.41" dur="9.929">understand so you only had three pages</text>
  <text start="1021.16" dur="8.61">on there RNC do you think the media in</text>
  <text start="1027.339" dur="6.291">the u.s. is trying to scapegoat you and</text>
  <text start="1029.77" dur="3.86">what message do you have for them</text>
  <text start="1034.17" dur="7.18">they&amp;#39;re increasingly not very important</text>
  <text start="1037.589" dur="6.461">I think I think Trump has even made this</text>
  <text start="1041.35" dur="5.34">statement and they&amp;#39;re a paper tiger in</text>
  <text start="1044.05" dur="4.82">this election and the the new</text>
  <text start="1046.69" dur="5.04">publications on the Internet one can get</text>
  <text start="1048.87" dur="6.55">pretty directly to the people so these</text>
  <text start="1051.73" dur="5.7">old press a less important and the</text>
  <text start="1055.42" dur="3.81">degree of bias they&amp;#39;ve been showing</text>
  <text start="1057.43" dur="4.92">during the electoral process and it has</text>
  <text start="1059.23" dur="6.36">come from both sides but I suppose</text>
  <text start="1062.35" dur="5.81">particularly the liberal press we just</text>
  <text start="1065.59" dur="4.16">see that they feel it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1068.16" dur="4.41">like being lectured to or told what to</text>
  <text start="1069.75" dur="4.8">do and they rebel against it I guess</text>
  <text start="1072.57" dur="3.78">this is the other reason why Trump won</text>
  <text start="1074.55" dur="5.34">and I won speaking about which is that</text>
  <text start="1076.35" dur="5.37">kind of hectoring from the liberal media</text>
  <text start="1079.89" dur="3.3">in the United States and the type of</text>
  <text start="1081.72" dur="4.08">advertising that Hillary Clinton was</text>
  <text start="1083.19" dur="4.98">putting out really turns people off</text>
  <text start="1085.8" dur="5.55">because it seemed like those people who</text>
  <text start="1088.17" dur="6.09">already had a lot of social power were</text>
  <text start="1091.35" dur="5.31">telling you what to do and so you wanted</text>
  <text start="1094.26" dur="4.59">to do the opposite how easy from your</text>
  <text start="1096.66" dur="3.75">assessment as somebody that has been</text>
  <text start="1098.85" dur="5.82">involved of this most of his adult life</text>
  <text start="1100.41" dur="6.03">now how how secure if you are get to</text>
  <text start="1104.67" dur="5.28">give a grade of 1 to 10 10 being the</text>
  <text start="1106.44" dur="6.27">most secure how secure is America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1109.95" dur="6.21">Agency&amp;#39;s American government America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1112.71" dur="5.94">secrets everything is almost completely</text>
  <text start="1116.16" dur="5.76">in securing out the computer systems</text>
  <text start="1118.65" dur="6.48">have become so complex that it is not</text>
  <text start="1121.92" dur="4.68">possible to understand all the parts let</text>
  <text start="1125.13" dur="3.12">alone secure them is it is just</text>
  <text start="1126.6" dur="3.78">impossible so and that goes for</text>
  <text start="1128.25" dur="4.65">individuals as well as the government it</text>
  <text start="1130.38" dur="3.78">goes for all of us yeah yeah do you</text>
  <text start="1132.9" dur="3.3">think there could be a separate</text>
  <text start="1134.16" dur="3.84">operation within the Russian government</text>
  <text start="1136.2" dur="5.25">separate and apart from the information</text>
  <text start="1138" dur="5.49">you have a WikiLeaks ok so this is</text>
  <text start="1141.45" dur="5.1">interesting that there&amp;#39;s a conflation</text>
  <text start="1143.49" dur="5.88">between the three things wikileaks</text>
  <text start="1146.55" dur="4.95">publications and I&amp;#39;ve told you what</text>
  <text start="1149.37" dur="4.35">James clapper says about them that they</text>
  <text start="1151.5" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t see how the Russians</text>
  <text start="1153.72" dur="4.58">transfer them to ask the et cetera that</text>
  <text start="1156.54" dur="5.25">had the impact everyone&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="1158.3" dur="5.32">alleged hacks of the u.s. voting system</text>
  <text start="1161.79" dur="5.94">and you just mentioned the DHS for</text>
  <text start="1163.62" dur="5.85">example and other publications appearing</text>
  <text start="1167.73" dur="3.78">on the internet they&amp;#39;re not basically</text>
  <text start="1169.47" dur="3.69">almost no one has heard of they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1171.51" dur="3.63">have any impact in the election in fact</text>
  <text start="1173.16" dur="4.41">might have had the opposite impact so in</text>
  <text start="1175.14" dur="5.34">this last category there&amp;#39;s a site called</text>

  <text start="1321.33" dur="5.46">understanding them but for the same</text>
  <text start="1323.88" dur="5.34">reason of making it hard for authorities</text>
  <text start="1326.79" dur="4.5">to track when our sources have</text>
  <text start="1329.22" dur="4.05">communicated with us we don&amp;#39;t like to</text>

  <text start="1337.3" dur="5.01">has done this let me ask you whether you</text>

  <text start="1356.26" dur="5.13">well we&amp;#39;re such sticklers for this kind</text>
  <text start="1358.51" dur="5.52">of thing we&amp;#39;ve never said that til see</text>
  <text start="1361.39" dur="5.97">Manning is one of our sources at trial</text>
  <text start="1364.03" dur="5.28">they have said that they are but even if</text>
  <text start="1367.36" dur="4.29">someone is arrested and convicted and</text>
  <text start="1369.31" dur="5.01">even if they were to plead guilty</text>
  <text start="1371.65" dur="4.47">we still don&amp;#39;t say whether they one of</text>
  <text start="1374.32" dur="4.74">our sources or not because someone in</text>
  <text start="1376.12" dur="5.01">such a situation is under you can argue</text>
  <text start="1379.06" dur="3.93">is under some kind of form of duress but</text>
  <text start="1381.13" dur="4.13">let me ask you one last question for</text>
  <text start="1382.99" dur="7.5">those especially in the media that was</text>
  <text start="1385.26" dur="7.36">allegations at his trial that that he</text>
  <text start="1390.49" dur="5.1">was working for the Russians let me ask</text>
  <text start="1392.62" dur="5.91">you a question about your motivation</text>
  <text start="1395.59" dur="4.89">because in a private conversation we</text>
  <text start="1398.53" dur="4.29">once had without divulging the nature of</text>
  <text start="1400.48" dur="5.34">that conversation you said to me I am a</text>
  <text start="1402.82" dur="5.37">journalist I I get information that you</text>
  <text start="1405.82" dur="3.89">think the public needs to know you said</text>
  <text start="1408.19" dur="3.75">to me you have no interest in</text>
  <text start="1409.71" dur="4.15">information about private citizens for</text>
  <text start="1411.94" dur="4.41">example that yeah and that you think</text>
  <text start="1413.86" dur="3.78">what you have discovered exposes like I</text>
  <text start="1416.35" dur="3.36">for example I think if there were any</text>
  <text start="1417.64" dur="3.87">good reporters in America they would</text>
  <text start="1419.71" dur="3.63">have taken the wikileaks information</text>
  <text start="1421.51" dur="4.5">that i put up on a TV screen every night</text>
  <text start="1423.34" dur="4.23">and i read on my radio program on 550</text>
  <text start="1426.01" dur="3.81">stations every day and they would have</text>
  <text start="1427.57" dur="4.62">taken the issue of how corrupt our media</text>
  <text start="1429.82" dur="4.02">is how corrupt the Clintons were and</text>
  <text start="1432.19" dur="3.09">they would have made this this would</text>
  <text start="1433.84" dur="3.33">have been a case bigger than Watergate</text>
