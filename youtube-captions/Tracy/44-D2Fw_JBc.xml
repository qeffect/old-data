  <text start="282.93" dur="3.75">protected this guy killa manic and the</text>
  <text start="285" dur="3.48">problem with the story that isn&amp;#39;t really</text>

  <text start="302.01" dur="9.47">go over what exactly constantine killa</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="8.64">manic did with metaphor</text>
  <text start="311.48" dur="6.22">summarizing they talked a lot together</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="4.14">about stuff that regarded the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="317.7" dur="4.68">but the Mulla report made him out to be</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="5.16">this huge Russian spy he made him out to</text>
  <text start="322.38" dur="4.02">be a Russian spy that had all these</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="3.24">connections to Russia and the fact that</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="3.24">that man affort was corresponding with</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="3.57">him and meeting with him in person was a</text>
  <text start="329.64" dur="3.48">big deal because he was a Russian now we</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="3.66">obviously come to find out that he is a</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="6.26">State Department employee right so</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s not true that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="4.8">outside of that and meeting with him in</text>

  <text start="377.16" dur="3.15">data that&amp;#39;s gathered from inside of the</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="2.85">Trump campaign about how good they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.31" dur="4.41">doing or how poorly they&amp;#39;re doing or</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="5.01">what the real real poll numbers are</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="3.36">right what are the real numbers here</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="2.58">what are we looking at not what the</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="3.48">media is reporting which is obviously</text>
  <text start="389.4" dur="4.56">flawed and horrible what is the actual</text>
  <text start="391.56" dur="4.02">numbers where do we need to focus paul</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="3.959">metaphor it&amp;#39;s taking that information</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="5.99">saying hey gates do me a favor whatsapp</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="7.611">this over to kill manic for me now</text>
  <text start="401.57" dur="5.86">mmm there&amp;#39;s a couple different</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="7.36">philosophies here and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="407.43" dur="7.92">are saying mana Ford didn&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="412.89" dur="4.29">Killman ik was a State Department</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="3.57">employee or a State Department source</text>
  <text start="417.18" dur="2.88">I&amp;#39;m sorry and I know that everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.92" dur="3">gonna get upset with me about the name</text>
  <text start="420.06" dur="3.06">please bear with me I&amp;#39;m not even trying</text>
  <text start="421.92" dur="2.88">to figure out how to pronounce it right</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="4.43">now it&amp;#39;s really easy to I know I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="7.05">it before I just bear with me</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="8.26">mana Ford is doesn&amp;#39;t know that metaphor</text>
  <text start="431.85" dur="6.12">doesn&amp;#39;t know that Constantine is a state</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="5.22">department source</text>
  <text start="437.97" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s just providing this polling data to</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="3.54">him to make the case that he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="3.9">good at his job and look what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="444.57" dur="3.36">to boost this campaign that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="4.65">destroyed all over the place in the</text>
  <text start="447.93" dur="4.38">media etc so on and so forth then</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s the school of thought that says</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="8.19">mana fort knew exactly what he was doing</text>
  <text start="455.64" dur="8.52">and was feeding this polling data over</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="5.22">to the State Department source so that</text>
  <text start="464.16" dur="3.06">the State Department would have the</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="3.42">internal polling data of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.22" dur="5.76">campaign and know where they needed to</text>
  <text start="469.14" dur="5.97">put up blockades then there was the</text>
  <text start="472.98" dur="3.78">school of thought that is it possible</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="7.17">and there&amp;#39;s no evidence to back this up</text>
  <text start="476.76" dur="8.19">whatsoever is it possible that mana fort</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="4.41">was giving them fake data because he</text>
  <text start="484.95" dur="3.3">knew that the guy was a source and that</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="3.54">came from somebody who emailed me so</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="4.65">that was an interesting theory really</text>
  <text start="490.23" dur="4.02">really good idea no evidence to back it</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="3.33">up right now but something that we can</text>
  <text start="494.25" dur="5.37">keep in our back pocket I want to play</text>

  <text start="1458.86" dur="10.049">you guys have seen this but basically</text>
  <text start="1466.83" dur="5.099">WikiLeaks is saying that the Department</text>
  <text start="1468.909" dur="8.941">of Justice is getting ready to is</text>
  <text start="1471.929" dur="7.71">getting ready to file more charges in a</text>
  <text start="1477.85" dur="5.789">new indictment against Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="1479.639" dur="8.17">there&amp;#39;s a gentleman that is named Seeger</text>
  <text start="1483.639" dur="5.931">Sigurd or Thor disorder or son who was</text>
  <text start="1487.809" dur="4.74">flown to the United States they</text>
  <text start="1489.57" dur="4.719">interrogated him until June 1st and then</text>
  <text start="1492.549" dur="4.291">apparently they&amp;#39;re drafting more charges</text>
  <text start="1494.289" dur="6.48">to go ahead and charge him with more</text>
  <text start="1496.84" dur="8.01">more crimes the gentlemen who they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1500.769" dur="6.091">apparently supposedly relying on to file</text>

  <text start="1526.99" dur="12.269">Cindy he I&amp;#39;d stop looking at the chat oh</text>
  <text start="1536.34" dur="4.059">he had served years in prison came to</text>
  <text start="1539.259" dur="4.38">the United States he had actually gone</text>
  <text start="1540.399" dur="4.38">after WikiLeaks trying to extort them</text>
  <text start="1543.639" dur="2.99">and I think was successful he</text>
  <text start="1544.779" dur="4.38">impersonated Julian Assange for a time</text>
  <text start="1546.629" dur="3.971">and what does what WikiLeaks is</text>
  <text start="1549.159" dur="3.09">basically saying here is whatever these</text>
  <text start="1550.6" dur="3.179">new charges are that they bring against</text>
  <text start="1552.249" dur="4.02">Julian Assange based on this dude&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1553.779" dur="4.14">testimony those charges won&amp;#39;t stick here</text>
  <text start="1556.269" dur="3.931">in the US because the credibility of the</text>
  <text start="1557.919" dur="4.74">person you know they&amp;#39;re using to</text>
  <text start="1560.2" dur="3.78">substantiate them is shot but the reason</text>
  <text start="1562.659" dur="2.941">why the United States government is</text>
  <text start="1563.98" dur="3.99">going ahead and doing this is because</text>
  <text start="1565.6" dur="5.669">they need to then refresh basically</text>
  <text start="1567.97" dur="4.77">their extradition requests and they can</text>
  <text start="1571.269" dur="3.091">only do it with new charges which is why</text>
  <text start="1572.74" dur="3.509">you saw the base charge then you saw a</text>
  <text start="1574.36" dur="3.99">superseding indictment which added more</text>
  <text start="1576.249" dur="3.39">charges on now you&amp;#39;re seeing this new</text>
  <text start="1578.35" dur="6.18">thing that they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1579.639" dur="6.661">file additional charges against Assange</text>
  <text start="1584.53" dur="4.5">there is the first US extradition</text>
  <text start="1586.3" dur="4.47">hearing will be held in London on the</text>
  <text start="1589.03" dur="5.4">14th which is seven days from now so</text>
  <text start="1590.77" dur="5.51">next Friday there the interesting thing</text>
  <text start="1594.43" dur="4.14">about the timing of all this stuff is</text>
  <text start="1596.28" dur="3.1">you know they know that this case is</text>
  <text start="1598.57" dur="5.04">gonna fall apart</text>
  <text start="1599.38" dur="6.18">right and they know that the other case</text>
  <text start="1603.61" dur="6.39">that they&amp;#39;ve got against him is is a</text>
  <text start="1605.56" dur="5.28">weak case it&amp;#39;s based off of a a chat</text>
  <text start="1610" dur="4.11">masala</text>
  <text start="1610.84" dur="4.92">where julienne talks to Manning and</text>
  <text start="1614.11" dur="3.75">basically says like I&amp;#39;m trying to help</text>
  <text start="1615.76" dur="4.14">you by using this other person to figure</text>
  <text start="1617.86" dur="5.25">out this password and I got to be honest</text>
  <text start="1619.9" dur="5.55">with you unpopular opinion but in my in</text>
  <text start="1623.11" dur="4.35">my opinion the second Assange himself</text>
  <text start="1625.45" dur="3.87">goes from being a publisher of</text>
  <text start="1627.46" dur="3.6">information given to him by</text>
  <text start="1629.32" dur="3.15">whistleblowers to a person who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1631.06" dur="2.82">actively trying to assist a</text>
  <text start="1632.47" dur="3.45">whistleblower to hack into the United</text>
  <text start="1633.88" dur="5.37">States government there is a line drawn</text>
  <text start="1635.92" dur="4.65">there that doesn&amp;#39;t get crossed in my you</text>
  <text start="1639.25" dur="3.78">just can&amp;#39;t do that you can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1640.57" dur="4.17">journalists hacking into machines trying</text>
  <text start="1643.03" dur="6.54">to find information so they can publish</text>
  <text start="1644.74" dur="7.7">it that&amp;#39;s not the way the press works it</text>
  <text start="1649.57" dur="6.63">shouldn&amp;#39;t be the way it works but I</text>
  <text start="1652.44" dur="5.74">still don&amp;#39;t see the strength of the case</text>
  <text start="1656.2" dur="3.66">in in either the superseding indictment</text>
  <text start="1658.18" dur="3.5">which basically just reiterated what</text>
  <text start="1659.86" dur="5.94">they had originally said and added to it</text>
  <text start="1661.68" dur="6.13">with not substantive details and now a</text>
  <text start="1665.8" dur="4.4">Brent and the original one and now this</text>
  <text start="1667.81" dur="4.92">so I don&amp;#39;t really know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1670.2" dur="4.15">Julian Assange is our most fervent</text>
  <text start="1672.73" dur="2.97">supporters will say that they are</text>
  <text start="1674.35" dur="2.85">treating him poorly they&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="1675.7" dur="3.39">to get him here so they can hurt him and</text>
  <text start="1677.2" dur="3.66">you know they&amp;#39;re very worried and</text>
  <text start="1679.09" dur="3.66">concerned because he&amp;#39;s a publisher and</text>
  <text start="1680.86" dur="2.94">he shouldn&amp;#39;t he&amp;#39;s a journalist and he</text>
  <text start="1682.75" dur="4.98">shouldn&amp;#39;t be attacked like this what</text>
  <text start="1683.8" dur="5.01">happened to her Free Press then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1687.73" dur="2.61">the other side that say the United</text>
  <text start="1688.81" dur="4.26">States is trying to get him here so that</text>
  <text start="1690.34" dur="6">he can share what he knows about the DNC</text>
  <text start="1693.07" dur="6.15">hack or I&amp;#39;m sorry the DNC leak and the</text>
  <text start="1696.34" dur="5.7">Podesta fishing expedition with his</text>

  <text start="1832.539" dur="3.2">good right</text>
  <text start="1836.97" dur="9.88">which brought me to the next thing here</text>
  <text start="1840.39" dur="9.28">about Assange so Assange won&amp;#39;t face</text>
  <text start="1846.85" dur="6.78">charges overall in devastating CIA leak</text>
  <text start="1849.67" dur="5.37">and so they went through this article</text>
  <text start="1853.63" dur="3.48">and they basically talk about how</text>
  <text start="1855.04" dur="4.29">surprised people are that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1857.11" dur="8.37">gonna you know put him up for the CIA</text>
  <text start="1859.33" dur="8.16">stuff that he dropped and I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="1865.48" dur="4.34">don&amp;#39;t know that it&amp;#39;s the same thing as</text>
  <text start="1867.49" dur="6.72">what they&amp;#39;re charging him with in the</text>
  <text start="1869.82" dur="7.06">Afghanistan or the Manning case because</text>
  <text start="1874.21" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s no proof that he actively worked</text>
  <text start="1876.88" dur="4.38">to get this information himself he was</text>
  <text start="1878.59" dur="4.92">just publishing it they&amp;#39;re also worried</text>
  <text start="1881.26" dur="4.14">that if they take him to court they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1883.51" dur="4.98">gonna need to acknowledge that the stuff</text>
  <text start="1885.4" dur="6">that he released is actually real and so</text>
  <text start="1888.49" dur="9.08">again again and so because they&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="1891.4" dur="9.3">to announce that he&amp;#39;s actually real then</text>
  <text start="1897.57" dur="5.77">it would announce that basically the</text>
  <text start="1900.7" dur="6.36">vault seven stuff is legitimate and that</text>
  <text start="1903.34" dur="5.82">would again prove prove that they could</text>
  <text start="1907.06" dur="4.65">fake the Russians hacking into the DNC</text>
  <text start="1909.16" dur="7.74">server if they wanted to so it&amp;#39;s all a</text>
  <text start="1911.71" dur="7.29">big it&amp;#39;s all a big round ball that rolls</text>
  <text start="1916.9" dur="4.55">around but it kind of got me looking</text>
  <text start="1919" dur="8.16">into the gentlemen who is being charged</text>
  <text start="1921.45" dur="7.99">for this CIA vault seven leaked Joshua</text>
  <text start="1927.16" dur="3.78">Schulte and I started looking into his</text>
  <text start="1929.44" dur="5.28">case and I&amp;#39;m just gonna kind of talk</text>
  <text start="1930.94" dur="5.91">about what happened in his case they</text>
  <text start="1934.72" dur="3.93">were in his apartment basically looking</text>
  <text start="1936.85" dur="4.83">around for stuff that would time to the</text>
  <text start="1938.65" dur="5.01">vault 7 release and he was asked for his</text>

  <text start="2646.339" dur="7.081">been active on this front in recent</text>
  <text start="2648.019" dur="8.28">months and so Durham is taking over that</text>
  <text start="2653.42" dur="6.3">role now we know that Durham was active</text>
  <text start="2656.299" dur="5.651">as of octiline October of 2018 because</text>
  <text start="2659.72" dur="3.49">James Baker testified in open here</text>
  <text start="2661.95" dur="2.639">or not an open hearing and closed</text>
  <text start="2663.21" dur="4.05">hearing that he was under criminal</text>
  <text start="2664.589" dur="4.5">investigation by Durham for leaking at</text>
  <text start="2667.26" dur="4.68">that time so he&amp;#39;s been doing something</text>
  <text start="2669.089" dur="5.701">with these cases as early as October of</text>
  <text start="2671.94" dur="4.47">2018 if not a lot earlier than that</text>
  <text start="2674.79" dur="3.15">because I would I would venture to guess</text>
  <text start="2676.41" dur="3.6">that that investigation started earlier</text>
  <text start="2677.94" dur="3.63">so the thought that all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="2680.01" dur="3.21">Durham is picking up this brand-new</text>
  <text start="2681.57" dur="3.45">investigation where he has no idea</text>
  <text start="2683.22" dur="2.22">what&amp;#39;s going on I think are a little bit</text>
  <text start="2685.02" dur="3.48">far-fetched</text>
  <text start="2685.44" dur="6.09">in addition the next thing that said is</text>
  <text start="2688.5" dur="5.7">the other issues he&amp;#39;s been working on</text>
  <text start="2691.53" dur="4.65">relate to Hillary Clinton those are</text>
  <text start="2694.2" dur="4.83">winding down and hopefully we&amp;#39;ll be in a</text>
  <text start="2696.18" dur="8.3">position to bring those to fruition that</text>
  <text start="2699.03" dur="9.329">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re going to just</text>
  <text start="2704.48" dur="5.56">walk away from the case you know bar is</text>
  <text start="2708.359" dur="5.22">made a point to say over and over and</text>
  <text start="2710.04" dur="5.67">over again that if a US Attorney cannot</text>
  <text start="2713.579" dur="3.691">find charges you don&amp;#39;t bring them out in</text>
  <text start="2715.71" dur="4.95">front of people to explain that they</text>
  <text start="2717.27" dur="5.22">can&amp;#39;t find anything up we investigated</text>
  <text start="2720.66" dur="6.03">this person but we didn&amp;#39;t find anything</text>
  <text start="2722.49" dur="7.829">that would be really horrible to do to</text>
  <text start="2726.69" dur="4.8">somebody who was innocent so the fact</text>
  <text start="2730.319" dur="5.941">that he&amp;#39;s saying we&amp;#39;ll be in a position</text>
  <text start="2731.49" dur="8.4">to bring those to fruition means</text>
  <text start="2736.26" dur="9.14">something now I want you guys to think</text>
  <text start="2739.89" dur="10.439">back if you will to December of 2018</text>
  <text start="2745.4" dur="11.29">there was a hearing about nonprofits and</text>
  <text start="2750.329" dur="10.891">their interaction with governments hold</text>
  <text start="2756.69" dur="5.97">on I&amp;#39;m trying to find something here cuz</text>
  <text start="2761.22" dur="8.099">I did some research and I want to pull</text>
  <text start="2762.66" dur="8.73">up a clip invited to that press</text>

  <text start="2783.21" dur="6">from a firm they&amp;#39;re former US federal</text>
  <text start="2787.319" dur="4.53">investigators who started a firm and</text>
  <text start="2789.21" dur="4.139">have taken on this their whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="2791.849" dur="2.821">in that they have taken on an</text>
  <text start="2793.349" dur="2.281">investigation into the Clinton</text>
  <text start="2794.67" dur="5.73">Foundation</text>
  <text start="2795.63" dur="7.52">where the where the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="2800.4" dur="6.03">basically obviously we know is a corrupt</text>
  <text start="2803.15" dur="5.079">organization received a bunch of money</text>
  <text start="2806.43" dur="3.899">that should have been taxed they never</text>
  <text start="2808.229" dur="4.26">paid taxes on it and so they never</text>
  <text start="2810.329" dur="2.79">reported it&amp;#39;s the IRS the IRS has moved</text>
  <text start="2812.489" dur="2.79">a lot of money</text>

  <text start="2824.069" dur="4.081">to gain a lot financially from doing</text>
  <text start="2826.289" dur="3.3">this they go in front of the committee</text>
  <text start="2828.15" dur="3.149">they sit down and everybody&amp;#39;s like well</text>
  <text start="2829.589" dur="3.15">we invited whoever here and he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2831.299" dur="2.46">here he&amp;#39;s not doing anything he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2832.739" dur="2.76">sitting on his ass</text>
  <text start="2833.759" dur="3.03">he&amp;#39;s got nothing going on I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2835.499" dur="2.82">believe he didn&amp;#39;t even show up to this</text>
  <text start="2836.789" dur="2.401">hearing to tell us where he&amp;#39;s at with</text>
  <text start="2838.319" dur="3.63">this investigation</text>
  <text start="2839.19" dur="4.349">and I was like um thank goodness he</text>
  <text start="2841.949" dur="3.78">didn&amp;#39;t show up to tell us about this</text>
  <text start="2843.539" dur="4.92">investigation because if he was sitting</text>
  <text start="2845.729" dur="4.77">there in front of you guys talking about</text>
  <text start="2848.459" dur="5.57">the investigation we would have nothing</text>
  <text start="2850.499" dur="5.79">to be happy about in terms of justice</text>
  <text start="2854.029" dur="3.67">because it would mean that would be no</text>
  <text start="2856.289" dur="2.79">justice because it would mean that the</text>
  <text start="2857.699" dur="2.82">investigation was over and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2859.079" dur="4.92">doing anything with anything being</text>
  <text start="2860.519" dur="5.01">talked about basically if you were there</text>
  <text start="2863.999" dur="3.901">to talk about the investigation the</text>
  <text start="2865.529" dur="3.72">investigation would have been over simos</text>
  <text start="2867.9" dur="4.709">letting the power go to her head as a</text>
  <text start="2869.249" dur="6.99">mod in the channel over there about the</text>
  <text start="2872.609" dur="5.271">porn bots go for it John a please bring</text>
  <text start="2876.239" dur="9.21">your doctor&amp;#39;s note to the next class</text>
  <text start="2877.88" dur="8.859">thank you so these guys come in and they</text>
  <text start="2885.449" dur="3.63">start talking about this investigation</text>
  <text start="2886.739" dur="4.411">and and halfway throughout it Meadows is</text>
  <text start="2889.079" dur="4.801">like aha I understand now why Hoover&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2891.15" dur="5.219">not here and they say that they talked</text>
  <text start="2893.88" dur="4.199">to the FBI in Little Rock the field</text>
  <text start="2896.369" dur="3.541">office there and the FBI and Little Rock</text>
  <text start="2898.079" dur="4.861">confirmed to them that there was an open</text>
  <text start="2899.91" dur="5.669">and ongoing investigation into the</text>
  <text start="2902.94" dur="4.289">Clinton Foundation and they thanked them</text>
  <text start="2905.579" dur="2.67">for providing their evidence and that</text>
  <text start="2907.229" dur="3.3">was basically the end of the</text>
  <text start="2908.249" dur="4.59">conversation they called to ask a</text>
  <text start="2910.529" dur="4.05">question or two afterwards but these</text>
  <text start="2912.839" dur="3.87">guys also said that they handed their</text>
  <text start="2914.579" dur="3.841">they sent their information in to John</text>
  <text start="2916.709" dur="6.171">Huber and John Hoover did absolutely</text>
  <text start="2918.42" dur="7.439">nothing with it because he knew that</text>
  <text start="2922.88" dur="4.239">when when these guys were announced that</text>
  <text start="2925.859" dur="2.831">they were gonna be in this hearing which</text>
  <text start="2927.119" dur="4.031">they were invited to they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2928.69" dur="4.08">asked for Hoover called them back and</text>
  <text start="2931.15" dur="4.14">said hey hey guys can I get that in</text>
  <text start="2932.77" dur="4.89">evidence again you know III didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="2935.29" dur="3.569">it I want to see it - I&amp;#39;m gonna make the</text>
  <text start="2937.66" dur="3.15">point that it doesn&amp;#39;t freakin matter</text>
  <text start="2938.859" dur="4.171">either way because these guys had a</text>
  <text start="2940.81" dur="3.87">financial vested financial interest in</text>
  <text start="2943.03" dur="4.2">the outcome of the case and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2944.68" dur="5.07">sending information that&amp;#39;s tainted by</text>
  <text start="2947.23" dur="4.139">financial motives into an investigation</text>
  <text start="2949.75" dur="3.99">that raises the ability for the most</text>
  <text start="2951.369" dur="4.051">talented lawyers most expensive lawyers</text>
  <text start="2953.74" dur="4.859">on the planet who will be defending the</text>
  <text start="2955.42" dur="9.419">Clintons to use that as a way to kind of</text>
  <text start="2958.599" dur="7.911">get out to get it thrown out or to you</text>
  <text start="2964.839" dur="6">know make questions about the</text>
  <text start="2966.51" dur="6.819">investigation so far give whatever and</text>
  <text start="2970.839" dur="4.681">so the other thing these guys testified</text>
  <text start="2973.329" dur="6.151">at the time was that they were sitting</text>
  <text start="2975.52" dur="7.77">there and they have photos of the CIA on</text>
  <text start="2979.48" dur="5.49">the CIA the FBI and the IRS walking into</text>
  <text start="2983.29" dur="4.079">the headquarters of Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="2984.97" dur="4.619">in Little Rock walking out of there with</text>
  <text start="2987.369" dur="4.95">boxes of evidence and on to DOJ planes</text>
  <text start="2989.589" dur="4.53">they sent the pictures of this to the</text>
  <text start="2992.319" dur="3.841">IRS to prove it there was something</text>
  <text start="2994.119" dur="4.351">behind the evidence that they were</text>
  <text start="2996.16" dur="5.49">providing because your office is</text>
  <text start="2998.47" dur="4.859">literally there doing an investigation</text>
  <text start="3001.65" dur="3.719">as you&amp;#39;re telling us there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="3003.329" dur="3.811">happening so the IRS was basically</text>
  <text start="3005.369" dur="3.45">saying I know we would be investigating</text>
  <text start="3007.14" dur="3.179">this if it was a problem and these guys</text>
  <text start="3008.819" dur="3.331">are saying hey you&amp;#39;re walking right out</text>
  <text start="3010.319" dur="3.03">I see your office Scott you&amp;#39;re you guys</text>
  <text start="3012.15" dur="3.209">are walking right out of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="3013.349" dur="5.341">Foundation right now investigators from</text>
  <text start="3015.359" dur="6.541">the IRS may I submit that it is possible</text>
  <text start="3018.69" dur="5.659">that rather than uranium one as Joe</text>
  <text start="3021.9" dur="4.65">digenova and Victoria ton say have said</text>
  <text start="3024.349" dur="4.151">who Burr has been handling the Clinton</text>
  <text start="3026.55" dur="7.95">Foundation investigation this entire</text>
  <text start="3028.5" dur="8.04">time if you guys have not seen the</text>
  <text start="3034.5" dur="4.05">c-span hearing of these two</text>
  <text start="3036.54" dur="4.14">whistleblowers I would definitely watch</text>
  <text start="3038.55" dur="3.87">it because it gets heated it was really</text>
  <text start="3040.68" dur="5.7">exciting I did a live threat on it at</text>
  <text start="3042.42" dur="7.22">the time it was in December of 2018 was</text>
  <text start="3046.38" dur="7.459">it December or was it 27th when was that</text>
  <text start="3049.64" dur="4.199">was December 5th I believe</text>
  <text start="3055.28" dur="6.97">so there&amp;#39;s that next controversy abounds</text>
  <text start="3059.97" dur="6.35">I&amp;#39;m just gonna give you a disclaimer</text>
  <text start="3062.25" dur="6.42">right now on this next one I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="3066.32" dur="3.73">more information than what I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="3068.67" dur="3.66">tell you but there have been four</text>
  <text start="3070.05" dur="3.63">stories over maybe five now over the</text>
  <text start="3072.33" dur="3.93">past couple days that have really just</text>
  <text start="3073.68" dur="5.27">raised my eyebrows and I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="3076.26" dur="6.42">also there were like I have a friend</text>
  <text start="3078.95" dur="6.04">who&amp;#39;s very brilliant and wise and has</text>
  <text start="3082.68" dur="4.68">been sending me all of the links to all</text>
  <text start="3084.99" dur="5.04">of like these weird plane crashes and</text>
  <text start="3087.36" dur="4.04">explosions and all kinds of oddness</text>
  <text start="3090.03" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s going on all over the place</text>
  <text start="3091.4" dur="4.03">there&amp;#39;s just a lot of weird stuff going</text>
  <text start="3093.36" dur="5.52">on and I usually just kind of compile</text>
  <text start="3095.43" dur="5.01">this stuff and keep it next to me until</text>
  <text start="3098.88" dur="3.87">I can pull from it when things make</text>
  <text start="3100.44" dur="5.37">sense but these things here we&amp;#39;re about</text>
  <text start="3102.75" dur="4.47">to talk about just strange I just want</text>
  <text start="3105.81" dur="5.43">to make sure that everybody understands</text>
  <text start="3107.22" dur="5.43">like it&amp;#39;s one thing to explore a theory</text>
  <text start="3111.24" dur="4.5">and then find evidence to back it up</text>
  <text start="3112.65" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s another thing to just wildly shout</text>
  <text start="3115.74" dur="3.39">out that something is a fact with</text>
  <text start="3117.39" dur="5.25">literally no evidence to back it up and</text>
  <text start="3119.13" dur="6.39">all I&amp;#39;ve seen is people a lot of people</text>
  <text start="3122.64" dur="5.25">just jumping to wild assumptions with no</text>
  <text start="3125.52" dur="6.51">evidence whatsoever so I&amp;#39;m gonna start</text>
  <text start="3127.89" dur="5.85">with the the New York City police</text>
  <text start="3132.03" dur="5.94">officers who have killed themselves in</text>
  <text start="3133.74" dur="6.69">the past couple days now immediately</text>
  <text start="3137.97" dur="6.24">people jump to oh they were murdered and</text>
  <text start="3140.43" dur="4.95">I want to tell you that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3144.21" dur="3.87">evidence right now to prove that that</text>
  <text start="3145.38" dur="5.16">was true that that&amp;#39;s true is it possible</text>
  <text start="3148.08" dur="6.87">anything is possible but there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="3150.54" dur="8.1">to point that way yes I also want to</text>
  <text start="3154.95" dur="6">explain how New York City works New York</text>
  <text start="3158.64" dur="7.17">City is broken into five boroughs it is</text>
  <text start="3160.95" dur="8.25">not just Manhattan it is the Bronx</text>
  <text start="3165.81" dur="5.55">Manhattan Queens Brooklyn and Staten</text>
  <text start="3169.2" dur="6.51">Island the New York Police Department</text>
  <text start="3171.36" dur="8.73">covers this entire area in all different</text>
  <text start="3175.71" dur="7.35">districts and zones so people were</text>
  <text start="3180.09" dur="5.7">jumping immediately to the Weiner laptop</text>
  <text start="3183.06" dur="4.71">when they heard this story of these two</text>
  <text start="3185.79" dur="4.44">officers a very high rank</text>
  <text start="3187.77" dur="5.88">homicide detective in Brooklyn and a</text>
  <text start="3190.23" dur="5.34">deputy chief in the coup in Queens they</text>
  <text start="3193.65" dur="4.74">jumped right to it</text>
  <text start="3195.57" dur="5.88">Weiner was arrested in Manhattan which</text>
  <text start="3198.39" dur="4.92">is here the NYPD and Manhattan covers</text>
  <text start="3201.45" dur="5.73">here there&amp;#39;s all different precincts in</text>
  <text start="3203.31" dur="6.57">Manhattan Brooklyn is not a homicide</text>
  <text start="3207.18" dur="4.2">detective in Brooklyn is not gonna run</text>
  <text start="3209.88" dur="4.25">up to Manhattan to deal with the</text>
  <text start="3211.38" dur="7.62">high-profile politicians pedophile case</text>
  <text start="3214.13" dur="7.24">or a federal laptop case similarly a</text>

  <text start="3221.37" dur="4.77">Manhattan to deal with those things</text>
  <text start="3222.63" dur="6.12">either it&amp;#39;s not only a few people Donna</text>
  <text start="3226.14" dur="4.05">trust me it&amp;#39;s somebody saying only a few</text>
  <text start="3228.75" dur="3.36">people jump to the Weiner conclusion</text>
  <text start="3230.19" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="3232.11" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;ve seen hundreds of them hundreds and</text>
  <text start="3235.26" dur="4.29">hundreds and hundreds of people who have</text>
  <text start="3237.42" dur="4.23">said it&amp;#39;s the Weiner laptop maybe you</text>
  <text start="3239.55" dur="3.27">guys haven&amp;#39;t seen them but I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="3241.65" dur="3.6">you that I have and there&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="3242.82" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s no reason for me to address this</text>

  <text start="3315.78" dur="5.99">Parkway from Brooklyn into Staten Island</text>

  <text start="3324.29" dur="3.9">into Manhattan but there&amp;#39;s water along</text>
  <text start="3326.75" dur="2.79">the coast there and it&amp;#39;s a very quiet</text>

  <text start="3337.25" dur="7.44">a few um I&amp;#39;m talking to some people</text>
  <text start="3339.59" dur="7.89">because I&amp;#39;m from Long Island I&amp;#39;m from</text>
  <text start="3344.69" dur="5.25">Long Island and I know the area and I</text>
  <text start="3347.48" dur="4.71">have family and friends that are police</text>
  <text start="3349.94" dur="3.63">officer so I&amp;#39;m just reaching out to see</text>
  <text start="3352.19" dur="4.23">if I can pull any information and see</text>
  <text start="3353.57" dur="4.89">what I can do but everybody like I just</text>
  <text start="3356.42" dur="4.41">want to I have to say this again I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="3358.46" dur="6.63">scolding people obviously I understand</text>
  <text start="3360.83" dur="8.01">like why why this this everybody would</text>
  <text start="3365.09" dur="5.97">jump to Weiner here&amp;#39;s the problem as</text>
  <text start="3368.84" dur="3.96">soon as people jump to a conclusion and</text>
  <text start="3371.06" dur="3.15">start sharing things and saying this is</text>
  <text start="3372.8" dur="3.78">because of the Weiner laptop with</text>
  <text start="3374.21" dur="4.14">literally no proof behind it instead of</text>
  <text start="3376.58" dur="2.88">just taking a moment and just taking a</text>
  <text start="3378.35" dur="3.78">breath and doing a little bit of</text>
  <text start="3379.46" dur="4.409">research like um a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3382.13" dur="4.95">quite understand how the Southern</text>
  <text start="3383.869" dur="5.341">District of New York&amp;#39;s courts worked and</text>
  <text start="3387.08" dur="4.02">they assumed that Southern District of</text>
  <text start="3389.21" dur="2.97">New York means it&amp;#39;s bad and it covers</text>
  <text start="3391.1" dur="4.08">all of New York</text>
  <text start="3392.18" dur="7.29">and because the Southern District of New</text>
  <text start="3395.18" dur="7.31">York has a reputation lately for being</text>
  <text start="3399.47" dur="4.86">anti Trump and and just below the law</text>
  <text start="3402.49" dur="3.85">the Southern District of New York</text>
  <text start="3404.33" dur="3.66">doesn&amp;#39;t cover Brooklyn and Queens it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3406.34" dur="4.2">federal district court that covers</text>
  <text start="3407.99" dur="6.03">Poughkeepsie Manhattan and a few other</text>
  <text start="3410.54" dur="8.06">districts I just want people to just be</text>
  <text start="3414.02" dur="6.57">careful before they jump to conclusions</text>
  <text start="3418.6" dur="6.79">because it taints the rest of the</text>
  <text start="3420.59" dur="6.42">information and I just just you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3425.39" dur="3.71">have to listen to me I mean I&amp;#39;m just you</text>
