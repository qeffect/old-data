  <text start="372.19" dur="5.159">convention floor in protest it was crazy</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="3.42">and a lot of you guys probably didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="377.349" dur="4.951">know about that because a lot of you</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.819">were still in you know kind of under the</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="4.26">spell of this two-party duopoly that we</text>
