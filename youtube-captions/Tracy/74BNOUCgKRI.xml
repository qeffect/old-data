  <text start="15.15" dur="4.92">really want to see what he has up his</text>
  <text start="17.22" dur="4.5">sleeve in regards to this bill he signed</text>
  <text start="20.07" dur="3.539">the bill the press conference was Friday</text>
  <text start="21.72" dur="5.629">if you you know I didn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;d been</text>
  <text start="23.609" dur="5.76">holding off on comment about this</text>
  <text start="27.349" dur="7.091">appropriations bill my feelings on it</text>
  <text start="29.369" dur="6.96">the the so-called poison pills in it and</text>
  <text start="34.44" dur="4.139">all that stuff I hadn&amp;#39;t said really</text>
  <text start="36.329" dur="3.811">anything other than to tell everybody to</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="5.82">take a deep breath and just wait and see</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="5.82">what happened because because yesterday</text>
  <text start="44.399" dur="4.921">morning very early in the morning I</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="5.4">tweeted out whitehouse.gov statement by</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="3.57">the president saying President Trump</text>
  <text start="51.36" dur="2.67">basically told the left to go scratch</text>
  <text start="52.89" dur="2.849">and that he won&amp;#39;t be following</text>
  <text start="54.03" dur="3.509">provisions in the spending bill deemed</text>
  <text start="55.739" dur="4.531">restrictive of his constitutional</text>
  <text start="57.539" dur="5.101">authority in other words nice try and</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="5.16">basically what he does in this statement</text>
  <text start="62.64" dur="6.68">is nullify the parts of the spending</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="5.939">bill that in encroach upon his</text>
  <text start="69.32" dur="4.27">constitutional authority as president of</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="3.781">the United States and a lot of those are</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="4.05">interesting so I went through and I</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="5.43">picked them all out for you and I will</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="5.49">provide for you in my research section</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="4.649">of my website a raw doc with all of this</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="4.29">information available so that you guys</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="4.921">can look at it and see the page numbers</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="6.989">and read it yourself but there were</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="6.6">several interesting ones in here I began</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="10.881">this video about 10 minutes ago reading</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="12.84">this Amy know just so wordy and horrible</text>
  <text start="105.29" dur="8.05">there&amp;#39;s a Guantanamo Bay provision in</text>
  <text start="109.59" dur="5.91">here that prohibits the president from</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="7.309">transferring Guantanamo detainees to the</text>
  <text start="115.5" dur="5.149">United States however the section here</text>
  <text start="121.49" dur="8.95">is only referencing foreigners not</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="4.38">American citizens so Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="2.7">basically says you can&amp;#39;t tell me what</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="1.681">I&amp;#39;m going to do with those prisoners I</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="4.62">will</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="6.03">them if I want to and section 5:16 which</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="6.63">is the other section that he references</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="8.61">here is to me it looks like a mistake</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="5.43">only because section 515 says none of</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="3.45">the funds made available in this Act</text>
  <text start="149.82" dur="4.41">should be used in any way whatsoever to</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="4.83">support or justify the use of torture by</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="5.07">any official or contract employee of the</text>
  <text start="156.42" dur="5.31">United States government and section 516</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="4.86">which is referenced is basically talking</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="8.37">about the export of weapons and export</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="8.91">licenses to Canada and I&amp;#39;m not exactly</text>
  <text start="170.1" dur="6.75">sure how that would equate to national</text>
  <text start="173.07" dur="5.61">security so I&amp;#39;ve got to look into that</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="3.42">one a little more but the the next</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="5.85">division that I decided to cover here</text>
  <text start="180.27" dur="6.81">was um division C section 537 he says</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="3.84">that the Department of Justice may not</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="3.36">use any funds to prevent the</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="5.16">implementation of medical marijuana laws</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="5.13">by various states and territories so the</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="4.86">federal government has met has marijuana</text>
  <text start="195.57" dur="5.34">laws on the books this was a point of</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="4.08">contention during sessions as hearing to</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="4.889">be confirmed bars hearing to be</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="5.64">confirmed Division C basically says in</text>
  <text start="205.799" dur="8.631">the spending bill that the federal</text>
  <text start="208.11" dur="6.32">government cannot use any money to</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="4.09">prevent any of the states that have</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="4.051">medical marijuana laws on the book from</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="3.81">implementing their own laws that</text>
  <text start="221.82" dur="3.75">authorize the use distribution</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="5.31">possession or cultivation of medical</text>
  <text start="225.57" dur="5.52">marijuana specifically and president</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="4.25">Trump says I&amp;#39;m gonna authorize my</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="4.86">Justice Department to use that money as</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="5.56">constitutionally applicable you guys can</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="4.14">argue that any which way you want this</text>
  <text start="238.44" dur="3.66">is what he&amp;#39;s saying in this statement</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="4.26">specifically pointing out this</text>
  <text start="242.1" dur="4.59">subsection the benefits of medical</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="4.65">marijuana have been well documented I am</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="4.98">NOT against medical marijuana by any</text>
  <text start="249" dur="4.35">stretch of the imagination it bothers me</text>
  <text start="251.67" dur="3.45">in a way because that enables the</text>
  <text start="253.35" dur="4.8">pharmaceutical Lobby to continue to do</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="5.91">whatever the hell they want to do that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="5.34">just my opinion on that the next one I</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="6.3">chose to focus on had to do with the OMB</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="6.329">and the Office of Management and Budget</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="5.7">and the spending bill imposing</text>
  <text start="269.819" dur="5.13">restrictions on supervision of the Army</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="4.74">Corps of Engineers and what they do with</text>
  <text start="274.949" dur="5.041">the funds that they&amp;#39;re given the</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="5.609">specific line in here that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="5.31">referenced is this one none of the funds</text>
  <text start="283.379" dur="3.78">that made available for the Office of</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="4.5">Management and Budget by this act may be</text>
  <text start="287.159" dur="4.201">expended for the altering of the annual</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="3.839">work plan developed by the Corps of</text>
  <text start="291.36" dur="4.5">Engineers for submission to the</text>
  <text start="293.639" dur="3.661">committee&amp;#39;s on propriate basically what</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="3.269">they&amp;#39;re saying in the spending bill is</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="3.98">you&amp;#39;re not allowed to change what you</text>
  <text start="299.129" dur="4.651">already told us you are going to do</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="5.56">trying to bar the Army Corps of</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="5.879">Engineers from changing their fund</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="6.09">allocation from what was already given</text>
  <text start="309.659" dur="5.25">to wall so President Trump is saying</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re not allowed to do that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.909" dur="5.87">unconstitutional my office of management</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="5.61">and budget for any division is going to</text>
  <text start="320.779" dur="4.86">follow the Constitution which allows</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="7.499">them to change their spending bill and</text>
  <text start="325.639" dur="6.971">they were trying to basically stop them</text>
  <text start="330.689" dur="3.72">from building the wall and he says I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="5.73">not paying any attention to that you can</text>
  <text start="334.409" dur="6.391">scratch so there&amp;#39;s that the next one</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="5.4">that I chose to focus on several</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="6.839">provisions such as division F section</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="5.519">704 1b three mandate or regulate the</text>
  <text start="347.639" dur="3.87">submission of certain executive branch</text>
  <text start="349.259" dur="4.91">information to the Congress now this is</text>
  <text start="351.509" dur="5.011">interesting very interesting to me I</text>
  <text start="354.169" dur="3.701">will treat these provisions in a manner</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="2.819">consistent with the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="3.269">constitutional authority to withhold</text>
  <text start="359.339" dur="4.08">information that could impair Foreign</text>

  <text start="366.81" dur="5.719">constitutional duties of the president</text>
  <text start="368.52" dur="9.29">and then he picks out division D section</text>
  <text start="372.529" dur="5.281">713 which basically says</text>
  <text start="381.35" dur="7">here it is listen what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>

  <text start="539.27" dur="5.85">interesting to me this part which we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="542.15" dur="4.62">go over in a second basically protects</text>
  <text start="545.12" dur="3.75">the inspector general and gives the</text>

  <text start="558.44" dur="6.99">president would say you can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="7.59">records that are privileged because</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="4.92">these idiot rats and Congress are going</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="3.78">to try to grab any privileged records</text>

  <text start="628.07" dur="10.23">not quite sure why that clarification</text>
  <text start="630.34" dur="10.03">specifically was needed I don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="638.3" dur="4.94">the next one I don&amp;#39;t know if I like that</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="4.98">this is the last one numerous provisions</text>
