  <text start="139.73" dur="7.13">that was interrupted for an odd reason</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="7.18">really mainly talking about the extreme</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="4.51">progressive left as well as the</text>
  <text start="149.63" dur="5.06">mainstream media and yes somebody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="6.72">commenting it&amp;#39;s divide-and-conquer</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="7.74">thanks Declan it is divide and conquer</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="8.61">absolutely and and it&amp;#39;s by design and</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="5.83">people I think a large majority of folks</text>
  <text start="166.7" dur="3.27">are starting to understand that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.26" dur="4.8">divide and conquer and reach across the</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="4.68">aisle and kind of work together you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="5.57">seeing this sort of divide and conquer</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="6.12">narrative in very large part right now</text>
  <text start="178.63" dur="3.46">much bigger than it&amp;#39;s ever been in the</text>
  <text start="180.77" dur="3.78">past because there are so many more</text>
  <text start="182.09" dur="3.9">people that are a week so because there</text>
  <text start="184.55" dur="3.51">are so many more people that are awake</text>
  <text start="185.99" dur="4.68">the scale in which this needs to be</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="5.55">perpetrated is much greater spiritually</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="7.01">I believe a lot of people that have kind</text>
  <text start="193.61" dur="9.02">of been realizing this are learning that</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="8.08">let&amp;#39;s do by a shell of of yes if if</text>
  <text start="202.63" dur="5.98">terrorist attacks and and fake and false</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="5.1">flags or let&amp;#39;s start start this way if</text>
  <text start="208.61" dur="4.53">you guys can spot a false flag when it</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="4.52">happens type the word yes in the</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="2.24">comments</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="6.69">hmm surprising I&amp;#39;m sure there are people</text>
  <text start="222.98" dur="5.61">out there that can if you guys didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="4.29">know what a false-flag was seven or</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="8.49">eight months ago type yes in the</text>
  <text start="230.39" dur="8.64">comments yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes</text>
  <text start="237.08" dur="4.29">yeah and I think yes will be the answer</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="4.35">to the next question as well things are</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="4.53">changing and I&amp;#39;ve done several videos</text>
  <text start="243.38" dur="4.41">about how things are changing so I think</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="5.88">what we need to do really right now is</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="5.73">realize that the major propaganda arm of</text>
  <text start="251.78" dur="5.28">the United States government the CIA</text>
  <text start="253.52" dur="6.689">excetera aka the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="6.51">falling faster and faster by the day</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="5.551">thanks to smart folks that can find it</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="3.57">thanks to folks like James O&amp;#39;Keefe from</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="4.74">Project Veritas and his undercover</text>
  <text start="267.14" dur="8.04">reporters thanks to independent media</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="6.3">thanks to sort of this kind of Awakening</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="4.77">and the populace they&amp;#39;re falling hard</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="5.19">and fast understand who has the power</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="4.56">and when you start to understand who has</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="6.42">the power it becomes a lot more easy - a</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="5.76">lot easier to unite together to stop the</text>
  <text start="288.41" dur="5.3">narrative that they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="8.25">they are embarrassed right now</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="6.19">overwhelmingly embarrassed and it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="4.2">to capitalize on that and I think we</text>
  <text start="299.9" dur="7.44">keep doing that by spreading you know</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="7.23">real information with sourced factual</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="6.18">stuff you know think back to when CNN</text>
  <text start="309.95" dur="5.52">during the campaign said it&amp;#39;s illegal to</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="4.02">read and possess any of this stolen</text>
  <text start="315.47" dur="10.02">material it&amp;#39;s different for journalists</text>
  <text start="317.54" dur="12.59">different for the media no not we are</text>

  <text start="1780.12" dur="7.02">I have been over the past few months</text>
  <text start="1784.74" dur="4.23">learning very quickly that my intuition</text>
  <text start="1787.14" dur="3.57">is getting it feels like it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="1788.97" dur="4.92">stronger and stronger like my ability to</text>
  <text start="1790.71" dur="4.98">kind of decipher things and feel feel</text>
  <text start="1793.89" dur="5.19">things is getting stronger and stronger</text>
  <text start="1795.69" dur="5.09">and it&amp;#39;s something that I&amp;#39;m fine-tuning</text>
  <text start="1799.08" dur="4.98">now instead of just wondering what it is</text>
  <text start="1800.78" dur="7.26">which is which is really cool</text>
  <text start="1804.06" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s helping me in my life I</text>
  <text start="1808.04" dur="4.45">like animals someone&amp;#39;s asked me if I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="1810.96" dur="7.92">cat or a dog person I&amp;#39;m more of a dog</text>
  <text start="1812.49" dur="7.23">person than a cat person the more you</text>
  <text start="1818.88" dur="5.73">use it the stronger it becomes</text>
  <text start="1819.72" dur="6.69">absolutely I do both I think and I feel</text>
  <text start="1824.61" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s what makes me kind of potent I</text>
  <text start="1826.41" dur="8.94">think and feel but I do both honestly I</text>
  <text start="1831.09" dur="11.13">do I&amp;#39;m driven by my instinct if I was</text>
  <text start="1835.35" dur="8.61">here and I use facts to back that up and</text>
  <text start="1842.22" dur="10.11">if I can&amp;#39;t find facts to back it up I</text>
  <text start="1843.96" dur="10.05">figure out why I felt that way you guys</text>
  <text start="1852.33" dur="4.17">are awesome this is fun</text>
  <text start="1854.01" dur="6.66">like I&amp;#39;m having a conversation with you</text>
  <text start="1856.5" dur="6.03">guys did you talk about the new rabbit</text>
  <text start="1860.67" dur="3.15">files I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s in the new</text>
  <text start="1862.53" dur="7.86">rabbit files I haven&amp;#39;t looked at them</text>
  <text start="1863.82" dur="8.55">yet David Eick he&amp;#39;s interesting I I</text>
  <text start="1870.39" dur="4.86">think he has a really great message and</text>
  <text start="1872.37" dur="6.9">I watched him extensively several years</text>
  <text start="1875.25" dur="11.34">ago and I don&amp;#39;t ever close a door on any</text>
  <text start="1879.27" dur="9.21">opinions or any perspectives I think a</text>
  <text start="1886.59" dur="6.45">good portion of what he says from a</text>
  <text start="1888.48" dur="5.299">spiritual perspective is very very if</text>
  <text start="1893.04" dur="1.849">you</text>
  <text start="1893.779" dur="2.551">know what happened to the info just look</text>
  <text start="1894.889" dur="4.02">back in the video once it&amp;#39;s posted I</text>
  <text start="1896.33" dur="4.439">talked about it I think a lot of what he</text>
  <text start="1898.909" dur="3.39">says from a spiritual standpoint is</text>
  <text start="1900.769" dur="3.87">really spot-on and from a worldview</text>
  <text start="1902.299" dur="4.86">standpoint is really spot-on but I also</text>
  <text start="1904.639" dur="4.65">am an eternal optimist so I like to</text>
  <text start="1907.159" dur="6.39">focus on positive all the time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1909.289" dur="7.14">really almost it&amp;#39;s crazy actually and</text>
  <text start="1913.549" dur="5.57">that&amp;#39;s why I find that physically things</text>
  <text start="1916.429" dur="6.031">manifest with me when I don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="1919.119" dur="3.94">hence why I&amp;#39;m feeling the way I feel</text>
