  <text start="9.84" dur="4.11">Winston Churchill and I&amp;#39;m about to talk</text>
  <text start="12.059" dur="6.571">to you guys today about something super</text>
  <text start="13.95" dur="8.46">important and really exciting I&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="5.88">get into it it can be said that the</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="3.51">media is one of the most powerful</text>
  <text start="24.51" dur="4.08">institutions in the world and certainly</text>
  <text start="25.92" dur="5.759">in America they have the power to shape</text>
  <text start="28.59" dur="5.55">any narrative to sway mind to advance</text>
  <text start="31.679" dur="5.04">any ideal and to even affect the outcome</text>
  <text start="34.14" dur="4.439">of any election the media and the</text>
  <text start="36.719" dur="4.971">journalists that comprise it are the</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="6.121">arbiters of truth of impartiality of</text>
  <text start="41.69" dur="5.77">information for the people without</text>
  <text start="44.7" dur="6.179">truthful verified information we</text>
  <text start="47.46" dur="5.39">Americans are ill-equipped to make many</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="4.741">decisions about what&amp;#39;s important to us</text>
  <text start="52.85" dur="5.29">were unable to shape the world around us</text>
  <text start="55.62" dur="4.41">or to correct any wrongs were unable to</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="4.559">hold our elected representatives</text>
  <text start="60.03" dur="5.75">accountable the media is a vital and</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="6.99">crucial cornerstone of our republic and</text>
  <text start="65.78" dur="5.92">unfortunately starting decades ago the</text>
  <text start="69.689" dur="5.551">media began its spiral into corruption</text>
  <text start="71.7" dur="6.33">they were overtaken by nefarious agendas</text>
  <text start="75.24" dur="5.519">and greed and politics they were</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="6.18">weaponized as a propaganda arm of a</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="6.72">radical government gone rogue and year</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="3.949">after year it has only gotten worse not</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="3.451">better</text>
  <text start="88.159" dur="4.991">we the people are actually wise to this</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="4.32">and social media has provided this</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="4.95">window that we wouldn&amp;#39;t have normally</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.79">gotten inside of this seedy underbelly</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="6.019">of what was once looked at as a great</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="6.45">and honorable and respectable profession</text>
  <text start="104.119" dur="5.11">we&amp;#39;ve seen private emails of operatives</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="4.26">and masquerading as journalists</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="4.861">attempting to shape perspective to</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="6.18">assist a political candidate or a party</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="6.239">we&amp;#39;ve watched in horror as teenagers</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="5.28">have been framed for Thought crimes that</text>
  <text start="120.329" dur="6">didn&amp;#39;t exist their lives destroyed on</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="5.73">national television for an agenda and</text>
  <text start="126.329" dur="5.221">all of this happens as violent</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="4.379">perpetrators are in attacking innocent</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="3.32">people in the streets</text>
  <text start="133.319" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve been held up on a pedestal</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="5.31">glorified in the eyes of a few but</text>
  <text start="137.519" dur="5.761">reviled in the hearts of the many I</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="6.13">believe that this beautiful mask this</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="6.06">facade being torn off the face of the</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="4.89">once acclaimed media only to reveal the</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="4.41">ugly picture that&amp;#39;s underneath is</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="5.34">actually the best thing that could have</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="4.829">ever happened to this country the</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="6.089">American people aren&amp;#39;t stupid</text>
  <text start="158.579" dur="7.171">the American people are brilliant and as</text>
  <text start="162.629" dur="6.121">this legacy media lay dying on the vine</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="4.829">we have turned now to one another to</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="5.4">demand something with value something</text>
  <text start="170.579" dur="6.63">with integrity to replace it something</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="5.25">new something we can count on somewhere</text>
  <text start="177.209" dur="5.541">we can read and learn and know that</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="7.489">we&amp;#39;re getting the raw unvarnished</text>
  <text start="182.75" dur="7.299">oftentimes even really painful truth</text>
  <text start="186.889" dur="6.011">over the past several years I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="5.61">working really hard to create a new</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="4.89">media built on values I have built a</text>
  <text start="195.659" dur="4.95">presence that I hope that people have</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="6.39">come to trust and rely on because like</text>
  <text start="200.609" dur="6.15">we all deserve to have a place where we</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="4.529">can go and relax knowing that the</text>
  <text start="206.759" dur="5.1">information that we&amp;#39;re consuming is</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="5.4">actually the cold hard truth we may not</text>
  <text start="211.859" dur="3.84">always be comfortable reading it but at</text>
  <text start="214.109" dur="4.28">least we know that whatever we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.699" dur="7.771">reading or hearing or listening to are</text>
  <text start="218.389" dur="8.44">the facts a truly free press is one of</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="5.82">the most important mechanisms that we</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="5.28">have as a people to hold our government</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="5.819">accountable it is one of the only ways</text>
  <text start="232.109" dur="5.88">that we can bring a bright shining light</text>
  <text start="235.109" dur="5.1">to the darkness in the underbelly of our</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="4.56">institutions and it&amp;#39;s one of the only</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="4.351">ways we can ensure that we&amp;#39;re electing</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="4.02">the right people to represent us at the</text>

  <text start="246.569" dur="5.4">intentions it&amp;#39;s one of the only ways</text>
  <text start="249.269" dur="5.34">that we as a people can ensure a future</text>
  <text start="251.969" dur="6.24">for our children that represents the</text>
  <text start="254.609" dur="7.771">values that we hold dear life liberty</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="7.321">and the pursuit of happiness this</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="6.54">country is as important to me</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="6.21">as it is to all of you and with your</text>

  <text start="271.74" dur="4.77">weaken our and every single breath to</text>
  <text start="275.04" dur="4.31">the work that we&amp;#39;ve all been doing</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="6.96">together to replace the corrupt quote</text>
