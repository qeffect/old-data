  <text start="255.81" dur="5.97">in the first place as I was doing this</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="5.7">periscope yesterday I saw people and the</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="4.98">chat start saying well declassification</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="5.73">is not happening it was a complete lie</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="3.72">you know you were the president lied to</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="3.12">us about the fact that he was</text>
  <text start="270.48" dur="6.09">declassifying all the documents and</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="5.94">everybody was you know all upset about</text>
  <text start="276.57" dur="3.66">it and you know people were really</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="3.33">pissed off and I&amp;#39;m like wow where is</text>
  <text start="280.23" dur="3.42">this coming from and then I figured it</text>
  <text start="281.64" dur="3.57">out and I just wanted to go over this</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="3.12">with you folks so that you understand</text>
  <text start="285.21" dur="3.68">that like that what is actually</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="5.97">happening here so Brad Heath is a</text>
  <text start="288.89" dur="7.8">reporter in quotes for forget what</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="3.95">outlet that he reports for hold on</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="9.97">Reuters okay and they had filed back in</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="8.11">April I believe of 2017 yeah in April of</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="7.17">2017 they filed a FOIA lawsuit looking</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="6.42">for the looking for all the FISA</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="5.4">warrants that could have been you know</text>
  <text start="316.35" dur="6.39">filed by in the FISA Court and they were</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="5.13">wanting them under FOIA so they wanted</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="4.68">this stuff all to come out I have it</text>
  <text start="324.75" dur="5.07">here under FOIA the complaints available</text>
  <text start="327.42" dur="4.41">online and they have been going through</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="4.34">with this lawsuit for two years now</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="8.1">basically a little over two years and</text>
  <text start="334.16" dur="8.74">there was just a reply to a motion that</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="5.88">went on the docket on yesterday and it</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="4.8">was the government&amp;#39;s reply to what Brad</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="4.26">and the other defendants were claiming</text>
  <text start="347.7" dur="6.12">and so I wanted to go through what he</text>
  <text start="350.07" dur="5.85">shared with you versus what it is actual</text>
  <text start="353.82" dur="3.99">and show you why it was completely</text>
  <text start="355.92" dur="7.23">misleading and selectively Edel II I</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="6.72">deleted edited so here he says Brad says</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="4.38">this is the tweet that started at all</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="4.47">when the DOJ when the White House said</text>
  <text start="367.53" dur="3.24">President Trump had ordered the</text>
  <text start="369" dur="3.75">government to quote provide for the</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="4.56">immediate declassification of Carter</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="5.37">page FISA documents that wasn&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="375.33" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s a lie it&amp;#39;s lawyers subsequently</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="3.99">confirmed with the White House that</text>
  <text start="379.62" dur="5.46">there was and is no order to declassify</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="6.2">and he&amp;#39;s being very crafty in the way</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="6.69">he&amp;#39;s presenting this to you folks okay</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="5.65">and I&amp;#39;m telling you this for a reason he</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="3.66">shares this excerpt here which says and</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="3.36">it a classification order would be</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="3.6">wholly unnecessary if the president</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="3.3">simply intended to order disclosure</text>
  <text start="399.03" dur="3.51">because the president had</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="4.17">authority to declassify and disclosed</text>
  <text start="402.54" dur="4.2">documents himself and as fact and in</text>
  <text start="404.79" dur="3.99">fact has done so during the course of</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="3.959">this litigation and said there was a</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="3.75">press release describing a direction to</text>
  <text start="410.699" dur="4.321">provide for immediate declassification</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="3.93">that the press that press secretary</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="3.03">statement was followed by public</text>
  <text start="416.46" dur="3.51">statements of the President himself that</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="3.839">he was not requiring declassification at</text>
  <text start="419.97" dur="6.06">this time and it goes on and on but the</text>
  <text start="421.889" dur="7.351">problem is what Brad decided to keep out</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="7.59">of this and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where the real</text>
  <text start="429.24" dur="12">issue comes in I&amp;#39;m gonna find it for you</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="8.76">right here hold on I should have had</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="1.709">this up and ready I don&amp;#39;t know why I</text>
  <text start="442.38" dur="6.21">didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="442.949" dur="9.03">cloudy had here we go he cuts off right</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="5.69">to here is not in fact requiring</text>
  <text start="451.979" dur="6.301">immediate declassification and</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="6.37">disclosure and then the the next</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="5.19">sentence which is just so key and so</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="5.82">true and so the key to all of this that</text>
  <text start="463.47" dur="5.28">this reporter is misleading you on says</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="3.96">the president has however delegated</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="3.12">authority to the Attorney General to</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="3.66">determine whether these or other</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="4.2">materials should be declassified the</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="3.6">Court emphasized that the DOJ should</text>
  <text start="476.07" dur="3.21">provide clarification about what</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="2.88">instructions they received concerning</text>
  <text start="479.28" dur="4.83">the declassification of the pages</text>
  <text start="480.57" dur="6.24">contents now what what that is saying is</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="4.65">what happened if you look here is the</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="6.24">statement from the press secretary on</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="6.12">May 23rd 2019 today at the request and</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="3.72">recommendation of the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="3.24">of the United States President Donald J</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="3.149">Trump directed the intelligence</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="2.97">community quickly and fully cooperate</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="3.391">with the Attorney General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.09" dur="4.47">investigation into surveillance</text>
  <text start="503.31" dur="4.71">activities during the election the</text>
  <text start="505.56" dur="4.47">Attorney General has also been delegated</text>
  <text start="508.02" dur="4.38">full and complete authority to</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="5.009">declassify information pertaining to</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="4.11">this investigation in accordance with</text>
  <text start="515.039" dur="3.961">the long-established standards for</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="4.019">handling classified information so now</text>
  <text start="519" dur="4.38">let me break it down for you guys really</text>
  <text start="520.529" dur="6.571">quickly the reporter here Brad is</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="5.43">arguing that because Trump said that he</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="4.02">says that Trump said that everything</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="4.62">should be Declassified that they have</text>
  <text start="531.12" dur="2.79">access to the unredacted Carter page</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="3.3">five</text>
  <text start="533.91" dur="5.25">the Warren or a redacted warrant with</text>
  <text start="536.73" dur="7.8">you no other way and with specific</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="7.53">redactions changed for FOIA and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="544.53" dur="4.08">just trying to get their hands on this</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="6.33">and they have been for years it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="548.61" dur="6.87">midst of an investigation right now so</text>
  <text start="553.02" dur="4.14">the the whole purpose of this is for</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="3.09">them to get their hands on any FISA</text>
  <text start="557.16" dur="3.12">warrants that are in there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.57" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re misleading the court or</text>
  <text start="560.28" dur="4.41">attempting to mislead the court and they</text>
  <text start="561.9" dur="5.46">were argument to do it Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="6.9">hadn&amp;#39;t always been that President Trump</text>
  <text start="567.36" dur="6.69">said you know Attorney General bar is</text>
  <text start="571.59" dur="5.37">now in charge of declassifying if</text>
  <text start="574.05" dur="5.1">necessary any documents that are</text>
  <text start="576.96" dur="3.9">necessary for this investigation and at</text>
  <text start="579.15" dur="3.78">the time that this happened in May I</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="4.59">spent a good amount of time explaining</text>
  <text start="582.93" dur="4.56">to folks that declassification never</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="5.73">meant public release the</text>
  <text start="587.49" dur="6.51">declassification meant that other excuse</text>
  <text start="591.18" dur="6.29">me law-enforcement agencies could take a</text>
  <text start="594" dur="6.21">look at documents etc and that you know</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="4.15">Dunbar would have the ability to take</text>
  <text start="600.21" dur="4.38">care of that if he needed to as a matter</text>
  <text start="601.62" dur="6.21">of fact I pulled up a tweet from back</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="4.65">then on the 30th of May I couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="607.83" dur="3.3">what I was looking for but this is the</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="3.75">one I pulled up where I say I understand</text>
  <text start="611.13" dur="4.59">a lot of folks took declassification to</text>
  <text start="612.99" dur="4.26">mean public release it doesn&amp;#39;t it means</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="4.74">that he Declassified Doc&amp;#39;s for law</text>
  <text start="617.25" dur="4.65">enforcement because people kind of</text>
  <text start="620.46" dur="3.06">freaked out like what does this mean</text>
  <text start="621.9" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re not getting what we were supposed</text>

  <text start="635.16" dur="5.43">again is one of the reasons why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="636.92" dur="7.21">constantly talking about how especially</text>
  <text start="640.59" dur="7.02">now under a pretty stable Trump Justice</text>
  <text start="644.13" dur="4.83">Department for the most part again all</text>
  <text start="647.61" dur="3.33">of this stuff that&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="648.96" dur="6.24">impeachment and stuff is not coming from</text>
  <text start="650.94" dur="5.91">the Justice Department with a pretty</text>
  <text start="655.2" dur="4.74">stable Justice Department when a tom</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="5.19">Fitton or a you know another attorney or</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="4.05">another reporter complains about</text>
  <text start="662.04" dur="4.08">documents not being released under FOIA</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="3.339">and there were reasons for that</text>
  <text start="666.12" dur="2.409">sometimes one of</text>
  <text start="667.329" dur="3.69">which is if they&amp;#39;re being used in</text>
  <text start="668.529" dur="5.691">ongoing investigations so I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="671.019" dur="6.271">about this quite a bit with you as well</text>
  <text start="674.22" dur="5.38">what I wanted to show you I where this</text>
  <text start="677.29" dur="5.19">all came from and I you know listen I I</text>
  <text start="679.6" dur="4.949">have nothing but the utmost respect for</text>
  <text start="682.48" dur="3.93">tom Fitton and Judicial Watch I think</text>
  <text start="684.549" dur="5.01">that they&amp;#39;re a fantastic organization</text>

  <text start="689.559" dur="7.861">me I think they&amp;#39;re fantastic but this is</text>
  <text start="693.1" dur="8.25">the root of where this whole thing came</text>
  <text start="697.42" dur="6.12">from DOJ confirms that it ignored Donald</text>
  <text start="701.35" dur="6.839">Trump&amp;#39;s order to declassify Spygate Docs</text>
  <text start="703.54" dur="7.709">that is absolutely not what is happening</text>
  <text start="708.189" dur="5.61">here the DOJ is defending its right to</text>
  <text start="711.249" dur="4.471">hold on to those documents and not just</text>
  <text start="713.799" dur="4.32">hand them over to reporters whose</text>
  <text start="715.72" dur="9.299">attorneys are misrepresenting what the</text>
  <text start="718.119" dur="8.94">president said it&amp;#39;s and somebody just</text>
  <text start="725.019" dur="3.75">said something interesting tom Fitton</text>
  <text start="727.059" dur="3.12">released a version of the faces so by</text>
  <text start="728.769" dur="5.341">that logic it means no criminal</text>
  <text start="730.179" dur="6.06">prosecutions no no that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="734.11" dur="4.289">because they&amp;#39;re looking for not just the</text>
  <text start="736.239" dur="3.81">card or page FISA warrant but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.399" dur="3.451">also looking for and the Carter page</text>
  <text start="740.049" dur="5.671">FISA warrant was released with serious</text>

  <text start="749.23" dur="5.069">things redacted but that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="752.649" dur="4.201">they&amp;#39;re looking for in this suit you</text>
  <text start="754.299" dur="6.561">know I should show this to you folks now</text>

  <text start="859.58" dur="4.98">today as it did back in May and what</text>
  <text start="863.06" dur="3.3">that was was President Trump</text>

  <text start="888.65" dur="4.59">guys today I do want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="891.56" dur="5.34">fact that the New York Times began to</text>

  <text start="903.05" dur="4.26">cancel New York Times thing to happen</text>
  <text start="904.85" dur="6.51">and to be quite honest with you my my</text>
  <text start="907.31" dur="6.42">suspicion is that the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.36" dur="4.68">doing this is because of how poorly this</text>
  <text start="913.73" dur="4.56">backfired I really believe that they are</text>
  <text start="916.04" dur="4.32">angry that this leaker did not have the</text>

  <text start="931.01" dur="3.84">just what I think</text>
  <text start="932.09" dur="3.28">maybe I&amp;#39;ll be proven wrong I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="934.85" dur="3.31">that</text>
  <text start="935.37" dur="6.51">Trump wanted all of this to happen but I</text>
  <text start="938.16" dur="5.34">do believe that III I don&amp;#39;t believe we</text>

  <text start="961.44" dur="8.19">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that but all of this if if</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="5.13">this goes to the Senate there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="969.63" dur="4.92">hearing that means for the first time</text>
