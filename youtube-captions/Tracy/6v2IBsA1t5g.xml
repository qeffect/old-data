  <text start="182.98" dur="9.629">on the west coast I can&amp;#39;t wait for these</text>
  <text start="185.169" dur="9.93">questions either I&amp;#39;m ready alright so</text>
  <text start="192.609" dur="4.35">you know it&amp;#39;s been said a bunch of times</text>
  <text start="195.099" dur="6.931">that general Flynn&amp;#39;s politics actually</text>
  <text start="196.959" dur="7.261">were Democrat and sure yeah and so I was</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="4.5">just curious about you yeah I was a</text>
  <text start="204.22" dur="3.81">Democrat I was probably of my brothers</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="1.859">and sisters and you know there&amp;#39;s nine of</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="2.73">us</text>
  <text start="208.389" dur="4.951">I was probably the farthest left of all</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="4.92">of them in a sense of just ideology I</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="5.19">mean I was a Democrat for gosh the</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="4.589">better part of 20 25 years we grew up in</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="7.38">a you know in the Northeast and in Rhode</text>
  <text start="220.269" dur="8.401">Island my mom was my mom was a an active</text>
  <text start="225.91" dur="4.85">fundraiser for a number of candidates</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="4.95">back in the 80 70s and 80s especially</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="7.36">governors in the state and actually she</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="6.87">ran for she ran for Senate oh gosh early</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="3.66">80s or so but but it was a little bit</text>
  <text start="240.49" dur="3.78">different I mean obviously we were a</text>
  <text start="241.78" dur="5.46">military family that was a Democratic</text>
  <text start="244.27" dur="5.07">family we were Catholics and my mom was</text>
  <text start="247.24" dur="5.37">also interestingly enough she was the</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="6.66">head of a very big pro-life movement in</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="5.07">New England while she was a Democrat an</text>
  <text start="256" dur="4.14">active member of the mccr attic party</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="3.84">and so so it&amp;#39;s a little different in the</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="3.63">sense of like you know it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text>
  <text start="261.52" dur="4.5">kind of like a North East Republican</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="4.53">back in those days was kind of a liberal</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="4.32">North East Democrats but she kind of</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="4.11">blue-collar Irish Catholics you know</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="4.2">they were they were Democrats but they</text>
  <text start="272.41" dur="4.62">were very pro military and very Pro you</text>
  <text start="274.54" dur="4.83">know pro America really and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.03" dur="2.94">how we grew up and and stayed with us</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="2.25">for a while</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="3.83">you know and that&amp;#39;s fine I mean I think</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s what it used to be um absolutely</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="4.6">absolutely I mean we were working-class</text>
  <text start="285.58" dur="5.88">families we were Kennedy Democrats we</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="4.02">were obviously you know being Irish you</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="2.73">know and then we grew up in the town</text>
  <text start="292.42" dur="3.9">everybody had a picture of the Pope and</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="3.45">John Kennedy in the house right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="3.06">just the way this is the way we grew up</text>
  <text start="297.64" dur="3.66">and and that stayed with us for a long</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="4.08">time but you know then we saw that I</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="4.83">mean we all saw the shift sort of but</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="6.02">towards the end of the 90s you know just</text>
  <text start="306.13" dur="6.51">it was it was palpable how far left</text>
  <text start="309.48" dur="4.51">really Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s ilk was taking</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="3.42">the party and then when Obama was</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="5.94">elected kind of all you know the wheels</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="5.61">came off right so that&amp;#39;s what happened I</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="3.87">mean it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing like III think</text>
  <text start="321.67" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s pretty it&amp;#39;s pretty awesome when did</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="3.45">I don&amp;#39;t even know that you are</text>
  <text start="325.27" dur="4.68">necessarily what you&amp;#39;d call a Republican</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="4.41">and we don&amp;#39;t really know I&amp;#39;m not yeah so</text>
  <text start="329.95" dur="5.34">what it what is your political but like</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="6.51">what is your what is your yeah I kind of</text>
  <text start="335.29" dur="4.68">am like I like look at president Trump</text>
  <text start="338.17" dur="4.29">and I you know I don&amp;#39;t want to not agree</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="4.77">with everything that president says or</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="5.88">does but I kind of like his pragmatic</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="5.76">view of the world it&amp;#39;s what makes common</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="5.1">sense is what I like okay it makes</text>
  <text start="350.5" dur="5.1">common sense to have a secure border</text>
  <text start="353.44" dur="4.229">okay it makes common sense to have a</text>
  <text start="355.6" dur="3.86">rational immigration system it makes</text>
  <text start="357.669" dur="5.181">very common sense that was strong</text>
  <text start="359.46" dur="6.989">US military okay that makes to me a lot</text>
  <text start="362.85" dur="5.909">of common sense and so I guess I look at</text>
  <text start="366.449" dur="5.511">it like you know what makes sense that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.759" dur="8.041">gonna push the country forward versus</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="6.97">meier us in in divisive nasai Civ</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="3.75">rhetoric that you know that doesn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="378.93" dur="3.66">doesn&amp;#39;t solve any problems that the</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="3.45">country has we have a lot of problems we</text>
  <text start="382.59" dur="2.94">have a lot of good things but we have a</text>
  <text start="384" dur="3.75">lot of problems we have you know</text>
  <text start="385.53" dur="4.889">infrastructure issues we&amp;#39;ve got had some</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="4.53">problems with the education system so I</text>
  <text start="390.419" dur="4.261">know I guess I look at it that way and</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s why I was attracted to Trump even</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="4.19">though I was never a really big fan of</text>
  <text start="396.81" dur="4.59">his you know when he was a he was a</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="4.15">personal personality celebrity I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="4.47">really pay much attention to him then</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="5.1">but I kind of was attracted to his</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="4.44">message of sort of you know kind of</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="4.68">radical pragmatism I guess it&amp;#39;s the best</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="4.44">way to describe it and and and I think</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s still he&amp;#39;s been true to his word</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="5.13">through that I you know and so that&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="4.53">me is attractive personalities and all</text>
  <text start="419.88" dur="4.789">the other stuff aside I really liked his</text>
  <text start="422.34" dur="5.19">approach to to the issues you know</text>
  <text start="424.669" dur="5.851">grating awfully crazy how being</text>
  <text start="427.53" dur="6.24">pragmatic is radical these days yeah and</text>
  <text start="430.52" dur="6.19">and and mr. Flinn which you wish you had</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="6.119">brought up before I think his that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="6">way I grew up in the 90s so I was being</text>
  <text start="439.889" dur="5.46">raised by all those Kennedy Democrats</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="4.139">and that was the main thing it was kind</text>
  <text start="445.349" dur="2.731">of a always tell when I ever said well</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="3.301">what&amp;#39;s the difference between the two I</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="4.8">never got really an answer from anybody</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="5.009">and I had to figure out the minutiae as</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="4.86">I grew up but it was common people</text>
  <text start="455.159" dur="5.31">common sense and you look at if you look</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="5.1">at what it was really stood by a lot and</text>
  <text start="460.469" dur="5.04">you brought up the border especially if</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="5.4">you are if you are at the lower rung of</text>
  <text start="465.509" dur="5.46">the of the you know if you&amp;#39;re a middle</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="4.5">middle class lower middle class you know</text>
  <text start="470.969" dur="4.44">exactly what you&amp;#39;re competing with and</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s why immigration and the border</text>
  <text start="475.409" dur="4.681">was a great concern for a lot of working</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="4.889">clattering people regardless of race and</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="6.569">now it&amp;#39;s you know it there&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="482.909" dur="6.51">been a huge shift and that in people</text>
  <text start="486.659" dur="5.01">have actually accepted their own demise</text>
  <text start="489.419" dur="3.841">in some way they&amp;#39;ve actually they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="491.669" dur="3.841">convinced people to accept</text>
  <text start="493.26" dur="5.1">demise and the wanting to have the</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="4.47">borders open it&amp;#39;s crazy to see ya and I</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="4.86">think both parties are to blame for this</text>
  <text start="499.98" dur="5.88">too I mean the the the the Democratic</text>
  <text start="503.22" dur="4.89">Party you know looked at immigration as</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="5.1">a way to get more votes in places like</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="5.91">Florida big electoral you know electoral</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="6.36">vote states and it was which is a</text>
  <text start="514.02" dur="5.52">shameless way to to promote kind of</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="6.72">illegal immigration and you know the the</text>
  <text start="519.54" dur="6.15">really Chamber of Commerce Country Club</text>
  <text start="524.04" dur="3.69">Republicans looked at immigration as</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="3.75">cheap labor come across the border</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="4.8">I mean I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ve been in California 20</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="5.19">years and and you know it&amp;#39;s been flooded</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="4.86">you know with with it&amp;#39;s all this cheap</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="4.74">labor which has been to the demise of</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="4.17">the working class in this country and</text>
  <text start="539.37" dur="4.53">the minority and the legal minorities in</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="4.11">this country primarily African Americans</text>
  <text start="543.9" dur="4.5">who whose cities have suffered</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="5.58">dramatically up until recently you know</text>
  <text start="548.4" dur="5.91">the unemployment rate amongst amongst</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="5.7">African American young males was</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="5.04">terribly terribly bad and now the the</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="4.05">president in his policies economic</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="3.93">policies in particular have really</text>
  <text start="561" dur="4.2">helped them boost that but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.28" dur="4.05">laid bare the problems that the illegal</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="5.76">immigration have caused I mean you know</text>
  <text start="567.33" dur="6.36">you guys maybe I&amp;#39;m in my early 50s and</text>
  <text start="570.96" dur="4.44">you know when we were kids right in the</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="3.96">eighties so we were washing dishes and</text>
  <text start="575.4" dur="5.82">bussing tables and you know doing kind</text>
  <text start="577.65" dur="5.37">of hard hard jobs around my little town</text>
  <text start="581.22" dur="3.27">that I grew up but you don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="583.02" dur="4.02">anymore it&amp;#39;s just flooded with cheap</text>
  <text start="584.49" dur="4.65">labor the country and and it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="4.71">I can&amp;#39;t see how that&amp;#39;s gonna be good as</text>

  <text start="744.93" dur="4.44">all about what he didn&amp;#39;t he just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="746.76" dur="4.199">agree with the foreign policy yeah he</text>
  <text start="749.37" dur="3.18">wasn&amp;#39;t really allowed to talk to you</text>
  <text start="750.959" dur="4.551">about it then but did you sense</text>
  <text start="752.55" dur="5.729">frustration yeah I mean I remember being</text>
  <text start="755.51" dur="5.47">visiting at one time when he was at DIA</text>
  <text start="758.279" dur="5.161">was really about within about a year of</text>
  <text start="760.98" dur="4.049">his command and we were sitting in the</text>
  <text start="763.44" dur="3.99">he was living in Fort McNair with</text>
  <text start="765.029" dur="4.5">beautiful Washington DC has this</text>
  <text start="767.43" dur="4.62">military base right on the Potomac where</text>
  <text start="769.529" dur="4.231">a lot of the brass live and myk&amp;#39;s myk&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="772.05" dur="3.96">quarters backed up to Bataan we were</text>
  <text start="773.76" dur="5.67">sitting outside smoking cigar having a</text>
  <text start="776.01" dur="7.74">drink at night and he was venting that</text>
  <text start="779.43" dur="6.409">night about the the the massive mess</text>
  <text start="783.75" dur="4.92">that he inherited at the DIA</text>
  <text start="785.839" dur="5.531">specifically he inherited an</text>
  <text start="788.67" dur="4.979">organization that was basically built to</text>
  <text start="791.37" dur="4.2">fight the Soviet Union and the world had</text>
  <text start="793.649" dur="4.201">changed and the institution hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="795.57" dur="4.35">changed and so he was trying to and he</text>
  <text start="797.85" dur="4.799">was brought in specifically by Leon</text>
  <text start="799.92" dur="6">Panetta who really liked Mike when he</text>
  <text start="802.649" dur="4.74">was Secretary of Defense and it was</text>
  <text start="805.92" dur="5.43">brought in to really you know kind of</text>
  <text start="807.389" dur="6.991">dismantle the DIA and and blow it up and</text>
  <text start="811.35" dur="5.19">then when he started to do it you know</text>
  <text start="814.38" dur="4.34">the even called the deep state or</text>
  <text start="816.54" dur="5.909">whoever the entrenched bureaucracy</text>
  <text start="818.72" dur="5.95">really pushed back hard on him and in he</text>
  <text start="822.449" dur="4.021">was you know and he&amp;#39;s a fighter and so</text>
  <text start="824.67" dur="4.409">he kept you know the fight was like a</text>
  <text start="826.47" dur="4.169">knife fight on a daily basis that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="829.079" dur="5.481">was sort of how he described it to me</text>
  <text start="830.639" dur="6.541">and and specifically around at that time</text>
  <text start="834.56" dur="4.54">you know we were kind of pulling out of</text>
  <text start="837.18" dur="3.839">Iraq or the Obama administration was</text>
  <text start="839.1" dur="4.02">talking about pulling out of Iraq and he</text>
  <text start="841.019" dur="4.201">was seeing the formation of Isis the</text>
  <text start="843.12" dur="5.07">time it wasn&amp;#39;t called Isis it was just a</text>
  <text start="845.22" dur="4.619">bunch of you know Sunni radicals that</text>
  <text start="848.19" dur="3.149">were taking over large swaths of land</text>
  <text start="849.839" dur="3.211">and he was saying hey these guys are</text>
  <text start="851.339" dur="3.901">gonna form a Caliphate and he was really</text>
  <text start="853.05" dur="4.649">predicting what would it but became Isis</text>
  <text start="855.24" dur="5.909">and the Obama administration wanted to</text>
  <text start="857.699" dur="5.551">shut that narrative down because they</text>
  <text start="861.149" dur="3.99">wanted to say you know it&amp;#39;s okay to pull</text>
  <text start="863.25" dur="4.11">the troops out of Iraq quickly and we</text>
  <text start="865.139" dur="4.5">won and we got a we got bin Laden and</text>
  <text start="867.36" dur="5.13">all this kind of and Mike was saying in</text>
  <text start="869.639" dur="4.351">fact this cancer has metastasized to the</text>
  <text start="872.49" dur="3.69">point where it&amp;#39;s spreading throughout</text>
  <text start="873.99" dur="4.02">North Africa and so forth that was</text>
  <text start="876.18" dur="3.389">number one the second big issue that he</text>
  <text start="878.01" dur="2.85">had problems with with the Obama</text>
  <text start="879.569" dur="4.14">administration was their treatment of</text>
  <text start="880.86" dur="6.06">Iran if Iran as some type of you know</text>
  <text start="883.709" dur="4.921">some type of regime that we could you</text>
  <text start="886.92" dur="4.32">know deal with that we could have an</text>
  <text start="888.63" dur="3.75">honest relationship with and then Mike</text>
  <text start="891.24" dur="2.67">was saying you know these guys are the</text>
  <text start="892.38" dur="2.77">largest state-sponsored terror their</text>
  <text start="893.91" dur="3.43">their fingerprints</text>
  <text start="895.15" dur="5.49">everywhere including supporting al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="897.34" dur="4.68">and again that was a narrative that they</text>
  <text start="900.64" dur="3.12">wanted to shut down and he wasn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="902.02" dur="4.19">to have any of that and he got into a</text>
  <text start="903.76" dur="4.8">lot of he does a lot of problems leave</text>
  <text start="906.21" dur="4.3">forcing you know forcing his early</text>
  <text start="908.56" dur="3.15">resignation and of course as a soldier</text>
  <text start="910.51" dur="3.66">and they tell you you know hey you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.71" dur="4.68">done well then you you submit your</text>
  <text start="914.17" dur="3.63">resignation and you&amp;#39;re out and then not</text>
  <text start="916.39" dur="4.26">really worried him though what what he</text>
  <text start="917.8" dur="5.1">saw in there and the way that the Obama</text>
  <text start="920.65" dur="3.99">administration in particular Susan Rice</text>
  <text start="922.9" dur="4.26">and Ben Rose and so forth were we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.64" dur="5.04">really running the foreign policy he</text>
  <text start="927.16" dur="5.13">said number one these people have have</text>
  <text start="929.68" dur="4.47">an agenda it&amp;#39;s not a pro America agenda</text>
  <text start="932.29" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s going to put us in more jeopardy</text>
  <text start="934.15" dur="3.93">and I&amp;#39;m not gonna stand for it I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>

  <text start="945.25" dur="4.68">so that&amp;#39;s the way it went and during the</text>

  <text start="993.16" dur="3.48">that time he wasn&amp;#39;t suspicious you know</text>
  <text start="995.2" dur="3.93">at that time he was part of the team</text>
  <text start="996.64" dur="4.38">right it&amp;#39;s like hey you know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="999.13" dur="3.72">been appointed to this job now he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1001.02" dur="3.66">little different with military guys that</text>
  <text start="1002.85" dur="5.31">get appointed because they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="1004.68" dur="5.22">they were already government people</text>
  <text start="1008.16" dur="5.25">people working for the US government his</text>
  <text start="1009.9" dur="5.22">entire career right so he&amp;#39;s you know he</text>
  <text start="1013.41" dur="3.78">gets invited to a lot of places as the</text>
  <text start="1015.12" dur="3.63">head of the DIA and he had already kind</text>
  <text start="1017.19" dur="4.61">of made a name for himself prior to</text>
  <text start="1018.75" dur="4.89">becoming a head of the DIA through some</text>
  <text start="1021.8" dur="4.45">publications that he made while he was</text>
  <text start="1023.64" dur="5.1">in combat that were somewhat</text>
  <text start="1026.25" dur="4.829">controversial about basically house</text>
  <text start="1028.74" dur="4.199">the intelligence community is and how</text>
  <text start="1031.079" dur="4.441">ineffective they were at gathering</text>
  <text start="1032.939" dur="4.861">information for war fighters and so he</text>
  <text start="1035.52" dur="4.38">had a name for himself and so academic</text>
  <text start="1037.8" dur="4.379">circles and others you know they would</text>
  <text start="1039.9" dur="4.529">invite him to speak in different places</text>
  <text start="1042.179" dur="4.02">and and he was you know he was on the</text>
  <text start="1044.429" dur="3.63">circuit even though you know it in</text>
  <text start="1046.199" dur="3.841">uniform because he had his name for</text>
  <text start="1048.059" dur="3.571">himself so no I don&amp;#39;t think he was</text>
  <text start="1050.04" dur="4.68">suspecting of anything when he went over</text>
  <text start="1051.63" dur="4.74">there a - to London - I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1054.72" dur="2.1">Cambridge Institute or something like</text>
  <text start="1056.37" dur="2.85">that</text>
  <text start="1056.82" dur="4.08">when he was invited he spoke and it</text>
  <text start="1059.22" dur="5.22">didn&amp;#39;t really it didn&amp;#39;t really even</text>
  <text start="1060.9" dur="5.88">surface that whole issue and halper and</text>
  <text start="1064.44" dur="5.7">all that didn&amp;#39;t even surface until it</text>
  <text start="1066.78" dur="5.79">was reported in the media by crazy</text>
  <text start="1070.14" dur="4.44">left-wing journalists that Mike Flynn</text>
  <text start="1072.57" dur="5.58">could have had some type of relationship</text>
  <text start="1074.58" dur="5.4">with this Russian graduate student over</text>
  <text start="1078.15" dur="3.87">there and he was like what are you</text>
  <text start="1079.98" dur="3.51">talking about you know that&amp;#39;s a guy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1082.02" dur="3.03">been married to the same he&amp;#39;s been with</text>
  <text start="1083.49" dur="4.29">the same woman since they were 15 years</text>
  <text start="1085.05" dur="6.03">old it&amp;#39;s like are you kidding me and so</text>
  <text start="1087.78" dur="7.14">that that kind of blew him away but what</text>
  <text start="1091.08" dur="5.82">it did what it did kind of point out and</text>
  <text start="1094.92" dur="4.77">I think now in hindsight we we know this</text>
  <text start="1096.9" dur="5.46">is that is that they were spying on him</text>
  <text start="1099.69" dur="5.1">a long time ago yep they had that yeah</text>
  <text start="1102.36" dur="4.199">they had their eyes on Mike Flynn while</text>
  <text start="1104.79" dur="4.8">he probably was still in uniform because</text>
  <text start="1106.559" dur="4.891">of how vocal he was and that&amp;#39;s now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1109.59" dur="3.089">finding out that you know that was kind</text>
  <text start="1111.45" dur="3.84">of commonplace with the Obama</text>
  <text start="1112.679" dur="4.651">administration really yeah my name&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1115.29" dur="3.45">vice that was weird old out like candy</text>
  <text start="1117.33" dur="3.09">and you know he came back and he</text>
  <text start="1118.74" dur="3.39">reported that trip and he did everything</text>
  <text start="1120.42" dur="5.04">the right way it wasn&amp;#39;t like it was it</text>
  <text start="1122.13" dur="5.549">was it was hitting trip that trip that</text>
  <text start="1125.46" dur="3.93">trip was well he was still in uniform</text>
  <text start="1127.679" dur="3.63">the other trip that was all supposedly</text>
  <text start="1129.39" dur="4.26">controversial was when Artie invited him</text>
  <text start="1131.309" dur="4.651">to speak at their 10th anniversary gala</text>

  <text start="1692.97" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re in shock we were in shock I mean</text>
  <text start="1695.94" dur="1.8">we thought we were gonna be walking out</text>
  <text start="1697.26" dur="2.6">of there</text>
  <text start="1697.74" dur="5.73">you know with some type of small</text>
  <text start="1699.86" dur="4.96">probation thing or something that he</text>
  <text start="1703.47" dur="3.45">could then he could get his life back</text>
  <text start="1704.82" dur="4.05">together and you know believe me we had</text>
  <text start="1706.92" dur="3.56">a lot of plans he was about ready to go</text>
  <text start="1708.87" dur="3.51">public with a lot of things and</text>
  <text start="1710.48" dur="4.51">opportunities and you know we were</text>
  <text start="1712.38" dur="5.31">getting ready to start a new life and a</text>
  <text start="1714.99" dur="6.42">judgement berserk in that courtroom and</text>
  <text start="1717.69" dur="5.52">I my theory of that is first of all I</text>
  <text start="1721.41" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t think the judge was read in very</text>
  <text start="1723.21" dur="5.13">well on on the on the on the case</text>
  <text start="1725.55" dur="5.13">mm-hm and I think that the judge jumped</text>
  <text start="1728.34" dur="3.26">to a lot of conclusions during the first</text>
  <text start="1730.68" dur="2.79">part of the trial</text>
  <text start="1731.6" dur="5.11">sorry during the first part of the</text>
  <text start="1733.47" dur="5.34">hearing that he then backtracked yeah</text>
  <text start="1736.71" dur="4.14">and said and said oh shit I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1738.81" dur="5.1">realize that you know he stopped what he</text>
  <text start="1740.85" dur="4.56">did was so detrimental it was terrible</text>
  <text start="1743.91" dur="4.62">it was terrible to the generals</text>
  <text start="1745.41" dur="5.91">reputation yeah yeah it was horrible it</text>
  <text start="1748.53" dur="4.98">was sick it was bad you know obviously I</text>
  <text start="1751.32" dur="4.14">gotta be careful about this judge</text>
  <text start="1753.51" dur="4.23">because he still had a sentencing but</text>
  <text start="1755.46" dur="4.92">you know so it was it was a it was a</text>

  <text start="1879.21" dur="6.12">particular is vast and so she knows all</text>
  <text start="1882.059" dur="4.771">the games what was interesting in the</text>
  <text start="1885.33" dur="2.97">last hearing I was at the last hearing</text>
  <text start="1886.83" dur="4.05">where she was introduced to the judge</text>
  <text start="1888.3" dur="5.31">and it was a completely different tone</text>
  <text start="1890.88" dur="5.22">this was back in June the judge had a</text>
  <text start="1893.61" dur="6.66">very different tone in fact he he he</text>
  <text start="1896.1" dur="6.24">greeted her and he sort of said you know</text>
  <text start="1900.27" dur="3.87">and full disclosure to the court you</text>
  <text start="1902.34" dur="3.93">know I&amp;#39;m in her book I have a signed</text>
  <text start="1904.14" dur="4.62">copy of it I think it&amp;#39;s a great book</text>
  <text start="1906.27" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s nice to see you today counsel you</text>
  <text start="1908.76" dur="3.99">know it was like completely different</text>
  <text start="1910.74" dur="3.689">whereas you know it was almost when in</text>
  <text start="1912.75" dur="4.08">December you know it was almost like he</text>
  <text start="1914.429" dur="4.711">was chaste Sullivan was chastising both</text>
  <text start="1916.83" dur="4.8">Mike&amp;#39;s lawyers and he was chastising the</text>
  <text start="1919.14" dur="4.11">government at simultaneously so the vibe</text>
  <text start="1921.63" dur="3.21">was a little bit different and what was</text>
  <text start="1923.25" dur="3.66">important in June and that hearing when</text>
  <text start="1924.84" dur="4.95">Sydney was presented as a new counsel</text>
  <text start="1926.91" dur="4.95">was that she asked for security</text>
  <text start="1929.79" dur="5.85">clearance so that she could get access</text>
  <text start="1931.86" dur="5.94">to the classified information related to</text>
  <text start="1935.64" dur="3.69">general Flynn&amp;#39;s case and the government</text>
  <text start="1937.8" dur="2.67">was kind of like the government was</text>
  <text start="1939.33" dur="2.28">kinda like well there&amp;#39;s no you know we</text>
  <text start="1940.47" dur="2.67">don&amp;#39;t really have any and she said I</text>
  <text start="1941.61" dur="2.79">wanted anyway cuz she didn&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="1943.14" dur="3.12">them at all cuz it&amp;#39;s not true of course</text>
  <text start="1944.4" dur="3.81">they have classified stuff cuz it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1946.26" dur="5.04">clear that they had some type of warrant</text>
  <text start="1948.21" dur="5.7">to to spy on him or to surveil him</text>
  <text start="1951.3" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s no other way that they would</text>
  <text start="1953.91" dur="4.83">have had any of the absolutely none</text>
  <text start="1956.16" dur="4.109">absolutely none so I think she&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1958.74" dur="4.83">get to the bottom of it</text>
  <text start="1960.269" dur="5.22">what direction it all goes who knows</text>
  <text start="1963.57" dur="4.5">I gotta mention earlier it&amp;#39;s high-stakes</text>
  <text start="1965.489" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s gonna play out it&amp;#39;s gonna take you</text>
  <text start="1968.07" dur="2.099">know I think this is gonna go well into</text>
  <text start="1969.629" dur="2.46">the fall</text>
  <text start="1970.169" dur="3.93">unfortunately because I can tell you the</text>
  <text start="1972.089" dur="4.83">one thing that really want to talk to</text>
  <text start="1974.099" dur="5.76">Mike I talk to him a lot the one thing</text>
  <text start="1976.919" dur="4.7">that really he laments a lot is not</text>
  <text start="1979.859" dur="4.26">being able to speak because he&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="1981.619" dur="4.27">it&amp;#39;s not really a gag order but he&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="1984.119" dur="4.92">what they call under protective order</text>
  <text start="1985.889" dur="4.801">meaning he can&amp;#39;t speak in order not to</text>
  <text start="1989.039" dur="4.29">protect himself but to protect the</text>
  <text start="1990.69" dur="4.169">government and so if he speaks in any</text>
  <text start="1993.329" dur="3.39">way shape or form then the government</text>
  <text start="1994.859" dur="4.56">come and he has a couple times and they</text>
  <text start="1996.719" dur="5.82">came down on him pretty hard about</text>
  <text start="1999.419" dur="4.56">speaking publicly so he&amp;#39;s really really</text>
  <text start="2002.539" dur="4.59">itching to do that I can tell you that</text>
  <text start="2003.979" dur="5.52">when when he does I&amp;#39;m curious like you</text>

  <text start="2009.499" dur="5.071">things and I mean listen we let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2012.979" dur="3.36">be honest like there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="2014.57" dur="3.87">that people think he knows that they</text>

  <text start="2349.46" dur="3.12">down you know you know that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="2351.23" dur="4.68">I wanted to bring up mr. Flinn and</text>

  <text start="2359.4" dur="4.98">and I&amp;#39;ve I have indulged in at least a</text>
  <text start="2362.309" dur="3.96">half a dozen theories about what your</text>
  <text start="2364.38" dur="5.61">your brother was doing what general</text>
  <text start="2366.269" dur="6">Flint has been up to as far as the the</text>
  <text start="2369.99" dur="4.289">please and and yeah what was going it</text>
  <text start="2372.269" dur="4.29">was it purely to address personal</text>
  <text start="2374.279" dur="4.08">concerns or what did he also allow</text>
  <text start="2376.559" dur="3.27">himself to be drawn into the belly of</text>
  <text start="2378.359" dur="4.92">the beast in order to bring it down</text>
  <text start="2379.829" dur="4.831">because I from a public standpoint this</text>
  <text start="2383.279" dur="3.57">is what a lot of people looking at I</text>
  <text start="2384.66" dur="5.06">don&amp;#39;t know if he if your brother has</text>
  <text start="2386.849" dur="5.341">picked this up along the way but</text>
  <text start="2389.72" dur="5.77">Americans have a real legitimate fear</text>
  <text start="2392.19" dur="5.639">that a large sinister faction within our</text>
  <text start="2395.49" dur="5.97">government is working to destroy what is</text>

  <text start="2407.339" dur="6.541">breathing our last gasps as a former</text>

  <text start="2424.71" dur="5.159">the is there any is there anything you</text>
  <text start="2426.779" dur="5.881">can you can tell I would say that I</text>
  <text start="2429.869" dur="6.261">would say that he absolutely one of the</text>
  <text start="2432.66" dur="5.849">things that that that he was motivated</text>
  <text start="2436.13" dur="5.26">motivated and still very motivated about</text>
  <text start="2438.509" dur="6.661">is exactly what you just mentioned what</text>
  <text start="2441.39" dur="7.08">he saw on the inside in particular with</text>
  <text start="2445.17" dur="5.06">the intelligence community and to a</text>
  <text start="2448.47" dur="5.519">certain extent the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="2450.23" dur="9.22">that they had become completely overrun</text>
  <text start="2453.989" dur="10.04">by a an element of in an element that</text>
  <text start="2459.45" dur="6.809">was in cahoots with the media to</text>
  <text start="2464.029" dur="5.141">fundamentally change the country and</text>
  <text start="2466.259" dur="4.86">take it in a direction towards what I</text>
  <text start="2469.17" dur="5.909">want I want to say it is democratic</text>
  <text start="2471.119" dur="6.21">socialism he saw this he&amp;#39;s aware of it</text>
  <text start="2475.079" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why he joined</text>
  <text start="2477.329" dur="4.051">the Trump campaign and was one of the</text>
  <text start="2478.98" dur="3.72">things he was going to do was really go</text>
  <text start="2481.38" dur="3.719">after that particularly on the</text>
  <text start="2482.7" dur="5.039">intelligence and foreign policy side I</text>
  <text start="2485.099" dur="5.49">think he believes it still exists that</text>
  <text start="2487.739" dur="4.53">that infrastructure bureaucratic</text>
  <text start="2490.589" dur="2.651">infrastructure deep state whatever you</text>
  <text start="2492.269" dur="4.621">want to call it</text>
  <text start="2493.24" dur="7.65">exists and that you know the kind of</text>
  <text start="2496.89" dur="6.61">that battle internal battle is still</text>
  <text start="2500.89" dur="5.33">raging and I think you see it recently</text>
  <text start="2503.5" dur="5.94">with the appointment and then</text>
  <text start="2506.22" dur="5.32">unattractive mm-hmm as a head of DNI I</text>
  <text start="2509.44" dur="4.38">mean how in the hell can that happen in</text>
  <text start="2511.54" dur="4.38">a three four day period you know and and</text>
  <text start="2513.82" dur="3.93">what are they what are they and and how</text>
  <text start="2515.92" dur="4.17">does somebody as strong as president</text>
  <text start="2517.75" dur="4.44">Trump succumb to that you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2520.09" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s something there that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2522.19" dur="5.46">sinister that needs to be dealt with and</text>
  <text start="2525.85" dur="5.82">I think general Flynn is aware of that</text>
  <text start="2527.65" dur="6.39">and is concerned and I can tell you</text>
  <text start="2531.67" dur="5.31">right now not necessarily gonna give up</text>
  <text start="2534.04" dur="5.93">in that fight besides them to the extent</text>
  <text start="2536.98" dur="4.8">that I can give any insight into that</text>

  <text start="2697.359" dur="5.161">the biggest thing there I wouldn&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2699.7" dur="5.07">all following all of this and waiting</text>
  <text start="2702.52" dur="5.01">with bated breath to see what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="2704.77" dur="5.91">I mean all of the the sentencing delay</text>
  <text start="2707.53" dur="6.12">yes we we&amp;#39;ve been wondering what the</text>
  <text start="2710.68" dur="5.939">mechanics behind all of this were and</text>
  <text start="2713.65" dur="4.669">the intentions and the mission because</text>
  <text start="2716.619" dur="4.681">we oh this is always going to be</text>
  <text start="2718.319" dur="6.731">multi-layered you you guys are fighting</text>
  <text start="2721.3" dur="6.39">a battle as a family there&amp;#39;s that but at</text>

  <text start="2727.69" dur="4.5">to your nephew a little bit at the the</text>
  <text start="2730.3" dur="4.44">walk away March and all that so yeah I</text>

  <text start="2743.8" dur="4.13">that&amp;#39;s always what I&amp;#39;m trying to figure</text>
  <text start="2745.9" dur="5.13">out is what the balance here between</text>
  <text start="2747.93" dur="5.05">self-preservation and also trying to</text>
  <text start="2751.03" dur="4.65">really stick it to the the the pockets</text>
  <text start="2752.98" dur="4.5">of evil that have taken over our our</text>

  <text start="2760.549" dur="7.101">balance that&amp;#39;s a tightrope right to walk</text>
  <text start="2763.809" dur="5.77">because you know we still live in a</text>
  <text start="2767.65" dur="6.339">situation where that were the justice</text>
