  <text start="218.16" dur="4.829">can just motor through all this stuff so</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="6.09">we got the news about McCabe I covered</text>
  <text start="222.989" dur="6.75">all that stuff last week and then we got</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="9.58">Natasha Bertrand here who posted a</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="8.791">leaked a leaked letter from Andrew</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="5.28">McCabe&amp;#39;s legal team that came out on the</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="5.19">13th which was about five days ago this</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="5.039">letter was leaked quite obviously to</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="6.239">Bertrand from Bromwich who was McCabe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.269" dur="6.361">attorney and also represented Christine</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="4.471">Blasi Ford and that&amp;#39;s a whole different</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="3.09">topic there&amp;#39;s a whole nother thread on</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="8.01">that I could sit here talking you guys</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="10.71">for two two hours today so this letter B</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="4.77">it says - says to the DOJ well you know</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="2.67">we haven&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="4.41">an indictment yet so it&amp;#39;s obvious that</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="4.92">there won&amp;#39;t be an indictment and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="4.949">operating this assumption that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="5.399">operating on comes from some rumors from</text>
  <text start="276.569" dur="6.081">the press and so it says as we note in</text>
  <text start="279.419" dur="5.25">our email we heard rumors from reporters</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="3.82">starting this morning that the grand</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="4.411">jury considering charges against McCabe</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="5.009">declined to vote an indictment we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="4.05">know the specific basis for them but</text>
  <text start="291.479" dur="3.451">they were credible enough that the New</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="4.289">York Times and Washington Post published</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="4.35">stories suggesting that the grand jury</text>
  <text start="297.419" dur="6.141">may have declined to vote in favor of</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="7.35">charges that is absolutely not even</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="5.109">possible and Dan Mangino did a great job</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="4.53">on his podcast last week if you guys</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="5.761">don&amp;#39;t listen of explaining why it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="6.72">possible the whole ham sandwich thing</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="4.769">the DOJ can bring this case back ask the</text>
  <text start="317.88" dur="4.379">grand jury what they missed</text>
  <text start="319.199" dur="5.31">fill in the fill in the the the holes</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="4.351">that they may have you need twelve</text>
  <text start="324.509" dur="5.4">members of the grand jury to indict and</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="6.77">there are 23 members most grand juries</text>
  <text start="329.909" dur="7.29">anyway so there they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="5.08">there was a no true bill which I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="337.199" dur="2.881">don&amp;#39;t believe that this is the case I</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="3.75">think that this is political spin and</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re using the media to get out in</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="7.32">front of what is obviously going to</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="6.54">happen which is an impending indictment</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="3.27">on McCabe and I think that I have a</text>
  <text start="351" dur="3.12">little bit more background to prove that</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="3.899">to you in the Horowitz hearing from</text>
  <text start="354.12" dur="4.26">today as well so this comes out and of</text>
  <text start="356.699" dur="3.541">course everybody was very confused about</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="3.3">what it meant including myself I read</text>
  <text start="360.24" dur="5.07">through it I tried to do some digging</text>
  <text start="361.68" dur="6.03">and finally I got this amazing article</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="3.27">here from Andrew McCabe which was</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="6.139">fantastic</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="8.369">I&amp;#39;m not Andrew McCabe from from oh gosh</text>
  <text start="373.849" dur="10.69">Mandor McCarthy my apology is my</text>
  <text start="376.949" dur="9.661">apologies and the article says why the</text>
  <text start="384.539" dur="4.141">title is why it&amp;#39;s unlikely the McCabe</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="7.859">grand jury voted against indictment and</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="7.32">it is so well done I&amp;#39;m gonna link this</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="4.111">in the YouTube description but you guys</text>
  <text start="396" dur="4.889">on Twitter have seen me tweet it</text>
  <text start="398.58" dur="8.94">it says despite swirling rumors</text>
  <text start="400.889" dur="8.611">there is no reason to infer a grand jury</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="4.32">has rejected a proposal indictment of</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="3.75">Andrew McCabe in coverage of the Andrew</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="2.97">McCabe investigation there seems to be a</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="3.479">lot of adding two plus two and coming up</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="3.479">with five and here he addresses the</text>
  <text start="416.729" dur="5.521">rumors that we just spoke about that</text>
  <text start="418.289" dur="5.731">were leaked two that were leaked to the</text>

  <text start="429.539" dur="4.051">Thursday in connection with the probe</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="4.079">into McCabe as I write this column on</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="3">Friday evening McCarthy says no</text>
  <text start="435.389" dur="3.27">indictment has been returned against</text>
  <text start="436.59" dur="3.87">McCabe and from this and what seems to</text>
  <text start="438.659" dur="3.81">be some sort of hopeful speculation</text>
  <text start="440.46" dur="5.989">about quote hints of the cases</text>
  <text start="442.469" dur="6.6">weaknesses which is absolutely nonsense</text>
  <text start="446.449" dur="5.68">that could possibly have caused grand</text>
  <text start="449.069" dur="5.16">jurors to quote Bach the times and the</text>
  <text start="452.129" dur="4.051">post suggests that maybe the grand jury</text>
  <text start="454.229" dur="3.571">voted against an indictment this</text>
  <text start="456.18" dur="3.239">supposition prompted a letter to the</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="3.66">Justice Department from a caves attorney</text>
  <text start="459.419" dur="5.701">Michael Bromwich former colleague of</text>

  <text start="476.039" dur="3.93">he doesn&amp;#39;t know the specific basis for</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="3.93">those rumors Brom Woods thinks they have</text>
  <text start="479.969" dur="4.891">to be reliable because the newspapers</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="4.44">printed a mind you neither the time nor</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="2.88">the post claims to have been told by</text>
  <text start="486.3" dur="3.299">anyone that they declined to indict</text>
  <text start="487.74" dur="4.169">McCabe especially not anyone on the</text>
  <text start="489.599" dur="6.87">grand jury and they don&amp;#39;t even a report</text>
  <text start="491.909" dur="6.93">that there was any leaks that there was</text>
  <text start="496.469" dur="3.931">a no true bill but McCabe his legal team</text>
  <text start="498.839" dur="2.911">is demanding the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="500.4" dur="3.449">disclose whether an indictment was</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="3.93">declined and refrain from seeking one in</text>
  <text start="503.849" dur="3.75">the future as if these attorneys have</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="4.56">any sway to do that after they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="507.599" dur="5.88">shoved away several times over and over</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="7.849">again in their quest to stop the</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="12.44">incoming storm that is on their way down</text>
  <text start="518.089" dur="7.83">four McCabe so what he says is</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="5.91">the criminal probe of mccabe stems from</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="4.35">an investigation by Horowitz of the</text>
  <text start="532.61" dur="2.99">leaks to The Wall Street Journal which</text>
  <text start="533.96" dur="4.1">we&amp;#39;ve gone over several times</text>
  <text start="535.6" dur="4.72">specifically that the FBI was</text>
  <text start="538.06" dur="4.87">investigating the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="540.32" dur="6.69">McCabe lied in several interviews by FBI</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="7.02">agents and then to the inspector general</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="4.89">Horowitz as is required when the IG</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="4.05">turns up evidence of any potential</text>
  <text start="551.9" dur="4.11">criminal conduct it was referred to the</text>
  <text start="554" dur="3.12">Justice Department for consideration of</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="3.33">whether or not they should even press</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="4.98">charges against McCabe now you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="559.34" dur="4.5">several times where you refer charges</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="3.36">over to the DOJ from from Michael</text>
  <text start="563.84" dur="3.12">Horowitz and they say the DOJ declined</text>
  <text start="565.46" dur="3.62">to press charges on this guy well in</text>
  <text start="566.96" dur="5.22">this case they actually considered them</text>
  <text start="569.08" dur="4.69">the matter ends up in the US Attorney&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.18" dur="3.36">Office for the District of Columbia</text>
  <text start="573.77" dur="4.25">because that is where the crime</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="5.46">allegedly the alleged crime took place</text>
  <text start="578.02" dur="4.87">therefore Jesse Lew decided there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581" dur="4.47">enough evidence to charge felonies in</text>
  <text start="582.89" dur="4.8">the case bromwich was permitted to</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="3.66">appeal the decision to the DOJ to</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="4.62">Jeffrey Rosen who&amp;#39;s the Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="5.4">General and then Rosen was unpersuaded</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="3.99">by that so the Justice Department told</text>
  <text start="594.53" dur="3.15">the McCabe defense team that their</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="4.29">appeal was rejected and any other</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="4.5">questions should go to Lou it was</text>
  <text start="600.59" dur="3.45">assumed when that happened on Thursday</text>
  <text start="602.18" dur="4.08">that the DOJ x&amp;#39; rejection was the last</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="4.29">hurdle standing in the way of charges</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="3.81">coming down which is why you saw every</text>
  <text start="608.33" dur="3.24">single person on Twitter and everywhere</text>
  <text start="610.07" dur="4.97">else including myself jumping up and</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="8.73">down saying holy holy moly</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="7.18">holy moly this is insanity we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="4.23">actually gonna get some justice here so</text>
  <text start="622.22" dur="4.53">McCarthy goes on and says that there is</text>

  <text start="897.649" dur="8.971">this comes out to be what we think it</text>
  <text start="899.93" dur="8.279">will be and no it will be that is really</text>

  <text start="923.87" dur="11">Horowitz that I wanted to focus on the</text>
  <text start="926.18" dur="11.88">first clip is at 54 38 we&amp;#39;ll start here</text>
  <text start="934.87" dur="6.55">after our report for classification</text>
  <text start="938.06" dur="5.969">marking purposes so what the percentage</text>
  <text start="941.42" dur="4.2">is precisely will sorry I should give</text>
  <text start="944.029" dur="3.541">some background what what Horowitz is</text>
  <text start="945.62" dur="4.589">talking about right here is how much of</text>
  <text start="947.57" dur="4.38">the report is classified and how much is</text>
  <text start="950.209" dur="2.82">not and what the process is right now</text>
  <text start="951.95" dur="5.04">that they&amp;#39;re going through to get that</text>
  <text start="953.029" dur="5.641">stuff Horowitz was I don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="956.99" dur="3.51">exact reason for the hearing he was in</text>
  <text start="958.67" dur="4.65">today was not to talk about the Pfizer</text>
  <text start="960.5" dur="4.98">report it was to talk about other things</text>
  <text start="963.32" dur="3.959">with the I think it was the House</text>
  <text start="965.48" dur="3.99">Committee I don&amp;#39;t know which which which</text>
  <text start="967.279" dur="5.401">committee it was that he was in but</text>
  <text start="969.47" dur="4.41">anyway he was talking to he was speaking</text>
  <text start="972.68" dur="5.31">to other things there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="973.88" dur="6.48">questions asked by Jordan and AH and</text>
  <text start="977.99" dur="3.81">others and medow is about the Jim Comey</text>
  <text start="980.36" dur="3.96">report there were questions asked about</text>
  <text start="981.8" dur="5.34">the McCabe report but that wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="984.32" dur="4.35">reason why he was there and that&amp;#39;s why a</text>
  <text start="987.14" dur="3.03">lot of people I&amp;#39;m seeing in the comments</text>
  <text start="988.67" dur="3.66">saying he couldn&amp;#39;t answer questions he</text>
  <text start="990.17" dur="4.38">couldn&amp;#39;t answer this the reason why he</text>
  <text start="992.33" dur="3.629">was not able to answer those questions</text>
  <text start="994.55" dur="3.96">as quickly and rapidly as he normally</text>
  <text start="995.959" dur="4.081">would is because he wasn&amp;#39;t in there for</text>
  <text start="998.51" dur="4.47">that and they were asking him very</text>
  <text start="1000.04" dur="4.59">specific minutiae of the reports that he</text>
  <text start="1002.98" dur="3.33">had done on Andrew McCabe more than a</text>
  <text start="1004.63" dur="5.579">year ago now a year and a half ago and</text>
  <text start="1006.31" dur="5.76">on Comey which was a very long report</text>
  <text start="1010.209" dur="3.361">and without it in front of you if you</text>
  <text start="1012.07" dur="3.36">must speak in front of that microphone</text>
  <text start="1013.57" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s a big problem so that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1015.43" dur="6.36">indicative of anything literally nothing</text>
  <text start="1018.76" dur="4.65">at all so let&amp;#39;s listen yeah and another</text>
  <text start="1021.79" dur="3.45">person pointing out too that there were</text>
  <text start="1023.41" dur="3.659">90 percent empty seats the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1025.24" dur="4.469">were not there there was one Democrat</text>
  <text start="1027.069" dur="4.86">there I think it was Rask and no one</text>
  <text start="1029.709" dur="3.99">else was there it was really sad because</text>
  <text start="1031.929" dur="3.181">this is important more important than I</text>
  <text start="1033.699" dur="3.661">think anything going on right now</text>
  <text start="1035.11" dur="3.479">outside of like core issues so here we</text>
  <text start="1037.36" dur="4.02">go let&amp;#39;s listen to what he has to say</text>
  <text start="1038.589" dur="4.951">about classification depend on what the</text>
  <text start="1041.38" dur="5.04">Attorney General and the Department and</text>
  <text start="1043.54" dur="5.16">the FBI decide after they evaluate it</text>
  <text start="1046.42" dur="4.34">and and that&amp;#39;s the process it&amp;#39;s in right</text>
  <text start="1048.7" dur="4.65">now okay are you working with a</text>
  <text start="1050.76" dur="6.37">Department of Justice to have some of</text>
  <text start="1053.35" dur="4.72">that Declassified right now what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1057.13" dur="4.15">done is me</text>
  <text start="1058.07" dur="6.93">the folks at the Justice Department and</text>
  <text start="1061.28" dur="5.97">the FBI to tell them what what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1065" dur="4.22">done so far they have the draft of the</text>
  <text start="1067.25" dur="5.1">factual information that we&amp;#39;ve developed</text>
  <text start="1069.22" dur="4.48">we&amp;#39;ve talked through the classification</text>
  <text start="1072.35" dur="4.8">issues with them but it&amp;#39;s ultimately up</text>
  <text start="1073.7" dur="5.1">to them to decide what&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1077.15" dur="2.94">marked and how it&amp;#39;s going to be marked</text>
  <text start="1078.8" dur="3.57">or how it&amp;#39;s not going to be marked</text>
  <text start="1080.09" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s coming right now is very</text>
  <text start="1082.37" dur="5.76">important and it references John Durham</text>
  <text start="1084.47" dur="6.87">so let&amp;#39;s listen that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s normal</text>
  <text start="1088.13" dur="6.42">process that&amp;#39;s how it would occur we may</text>
  <text start="1091.34" dur="5.46">weigh in once we see it back as to what</text>
  <text start="1094.55" dur="3.72">our views are okay Oh as to its to any</text>
  <text start="1096.8" dur="3.57">disagreement so there could be a point</text>
  <text start="1098.27" dur="4.26">that you would weigh in correct</text>
  <text start="1100.37" dur="5.09">okay that is usual process these are</text>
  <text start="1102.53" dur="5.28">these rarely go in a one straight line</text>
  <text start="1105.46" dur="10.71">process okay gotcha</text>
  <text start="1107.81" dur="11.58">regarding attorney John Durham or Horry</text>
