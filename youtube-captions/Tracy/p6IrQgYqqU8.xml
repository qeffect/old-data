  <text start="153.06" dur="10.53">of 2018 because it&amp;#39;s started like</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="5.459">recycling itself this John McCain had</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="4.259">the dossier thing and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="4.5">were unaware that John McCain had the</text>
  <text start="167.849" dur="6.241">dossier ever and then Lindsey Graham let</text>
  <text start="170.519" dur="5.911">it slip during the hearing whatever that</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="6.149">he had that he actually got a copy of</text>

  <text start="189.9" dur="4.619">you know we knew this before but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.579" dur="6.03">start let&amp;#39;s start digging into this a</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="5.94">little more and when this happened it</text>
  <text start="197.609" dur="3.901">was when the Senate had released all</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="2.761">those transcripts</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="4.229">do you remember they did like they</text>

  <text start="438.62" dur="3.51">got it out to a wider audience for him</text>
  <text start="440.48" dur="4.08">cuz at the time he didn&amp;#39;t have a huge</text>
  <text start="442.13" dur="4.65">wide audience neither did I but I had a</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="4.62">bigger audience than he did and then he</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="4.47">started working with this guy called the</text>
  <text start="449.18" dur="3.6">forensic 8 ER and then Benny got</text>
  <text start="451.25" dur="5.79">involved and it turned into this big</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="7.65">balloon which proved again that the the</text>
  <text start="457.04" dur="6.81">DMC the the information that traveled</text>
  <text start="460.43" dur="6.84">from the DNC server onto whatever device</text>

  <text start="473.78" dur="4.65">forensic ly proven using the metadata</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="10.98">inside of the released files right this</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="11.4">is the DN C so here we go the memo said</text>

  <text start="495.71" dur="4.68">Cohen never went to Prague so that</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="5.48">entire story is BS the entire thing is</text>
  <text start="500.39" dur="5.67">fabricated the entire thing is false</text>

  <text start="512.33" dur="3.63">the whole frog thing was one of the</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="7.35">earlier things that was flagged by</text>
  <text start="515.96" dur="6.9">Kathleen Catholic right Miami oh no I</text>

  <text start="2864.42" dur="8.61">constitution remove the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="2866.73" dur="9.18">yeah and it&amp;#39;s fine yeah well the state</text>
  <text start="2873.03" dur="4.41">constitution does not nullify the second</text>
  <text start="2875.91" dur="3.63">well all the second oh the Bill of</text>
  <text start="2877.44" dur="5.7">Rights for the the general government is</text>
  <text start="2879.54" dur="6.57">it restrains members of the House of</text>

  <text start="2892.98" dur="10.29">about yes as long as as long as you take</text>
  <text start="2901.44" dur="4.26">Prime I mean the other thing here too is</text>
  <text start="2903.27" dur="4.02">what is your state constitution say most</text>
  <text start="2905.7" dur="3.21">state constitutions have their own</text>
  <text start="2907.29" dur="4.23">versions of the Second Amendment I would</text>
  <text start="2908.91" dur="4.5">I would actually say that most states</text>
  <text start="2911.52" dur="3.63">that are passing any number of these</text>
  <text start="2913.41" dur="4.56">twenty thousand gun laws that are in</text>
  <text start="2915.15" dur="4.98">effect from you know from coast to coast</text>
  <text start="2917.97" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re most of those laws are probably</text>
  <text start="2920.13" dur="4.14">in direct violation of state</text>
  <text start="2921.72" dur="4.05">constitutional rights but the Tenth</text>
  <text start="2924.27" dur="3.51">Amendment says the state can do whatever</text>
  <text start="2925.77" dur="3.63">they want they can they can revise their</text>
  <text start="2927.78" dur="3.42">own constitutions however the hell they</text>
  <text start="2929.4" dur="4.469">want within their legislatures and and</text>
  <text start="2931.2" dur="4.53">all that but yeah the the bill of rights</text>
  <text start="2933.869" dur="4.801">for the federal government is about</text>
  <text start="2935.73" dur="6.3">restricting what everybody in DC does as</text>
  <text start="2938.67" dur="7.5">of as blanket decrees for all members of</text>
  <text start="2942.03" dur="5.28">the Union but that you know that you</text>
  <text start="2946.17" dur="3.419">would think that it would be harder to</text>
  <text start="2947.31" dur="16.68">get this stuff passed on a local level</text>
  <text start="2949.589" dur="16.561">but I don&amp;#39;t know that a well-regulated</text>
  <text start="2963.99" dur="3.72">militia composed of the body of the</text>

  <text start="2971.04" dur="3.9">keep and bear arms shall not be</text>
  <text start="2972.3" dur="4.23">infringed that standing armies in time</text>
  <text start="2974.94" dur="3.149">of peace should be avoided as dangerous</text>
