  <text start="22.89" dur="7.5">for lots of people professionally</text>
  <text start="26.279" dur="5.131">personally politically 2010 was 17 was a</text>
  <text start="30.39" dur="4.16">hell of a year</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="5.61">lots of good comes with a lot of bad - I</text>
  <text start="34.55" dur="6.04">cannot wait for this year to be over and</text>
  <text start="37.02" dur="5.82">to start a new in 2018 and I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="40.59" dur="4.14">kind of behind the times on this but</text>
  <text start="42.84" dur="4.739">I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to do this for a</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.86">really long time and given that the</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="4.221">media is now saying that the dossier had</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="5.1">nothing to do with the Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="51.8" dur="4.39">the Russian collusion nonsense that was</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="3.99">peddled out there even though we know</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="6.9">that that&amp;#39;s not the case I wanted to</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="8.25">take some time to discredit the Trump</text>

  <text start="66.93" dur="6.81">dossier yes you heard me right</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="5.43">I&amp;#39;m really not even gonna pull from</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="5.01">anywhere else but the document itself so</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="3.991">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s lay out a scenario really</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="4.409">quickly okay I know this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="80.97" dur="4.11">hard for you guys to comprehend because</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.171">it&amp;#39;s just so unbelievable but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="4.679">pretend for a moment that there was no</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="5.37">deep state operation to get rid of</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="4.921">Donald Trump and to quash the election</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.879">and to subvert the will of the American</text>
  <text start="94.68" dur="5.64">people let&amp;#39;s pretend for a second that</text>
  <text start="97.579" dur="5.381">Hillary Clinton and the DNC didn&amp;#39;t rig</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="4.47">the nomination for Hillary Clinton let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="3.869">pretend for one moment</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="5.73">that the United States of America is a</text>
  <text start="106.829" dur="8.341">shining bastion of truth justice and the</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="6.419">American Way and there&amp;#39;s no overt coup</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="4.17">going on between a shadow government</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="6.171">that has taken control and an actual</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="8.16">legitimate sort of semblance of a real</text>
  <text start="123.11" dur="5.8">government let&amp;#39;s just pretend that</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="3.209">everything&amp;#39;s on the up-and-up</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="4.14">okay I&amp;#39;ll give you a second to get into</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="7.631">that frame mind</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="7.48">if a document like this in that world</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="5.43">which is what they&amp;#39;d like you to believe</text>
  <text start="140.53" dur="6">is the actual world is being used for</text>
  <text start="143.77" dur="4.32">the types of investigations and FISA</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="4.58">warrants and everything else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.09" dur="6.15">going on we have bigger problems than</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="5.62">the fact that they used FISA warrants it</text>
  <text start="154.24" dur="5.64">would mean that the people at the</text>
  <text start="156.73" dur="5.75">highest levels of government and and and</text>
  <text start="159.88" dur="8.9">law enforcement agencies in the entire</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="10.259">free world are ridiculously</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="8.8">unintelligent and stupid frankly and</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="11.021">lack critical thinking skills and are</text>
  <text start="177.58" dur="8.52">blindly swayed and are inept and that is</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="4.71">a big problem but since that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="186.1" dur="4.22">case and there really is a deep state</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="4.47">shadow government</text>
  <text start="190.32" dur="4.36">I&amp;#39;m chuckling at this because it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="3.24">that ridiculous I did a poll on Twitter</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="2.97">and I asked how many of you guys have</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="3.66">actually read through this whole thing</text>
  <text start="197.65" dur="3.089">and I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t blame you I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="2.55">want to read through it either it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="200.739" dur="3.121">bunch of nonsense but I did read through</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="5.01">it I&amp;#39;ve done it I did it a while back</text>

  <text start="323.759" dur="5.4">Christopher Steele written Russian</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="8.399">dossier I&amp;#39;m a little feisty today a</text>
  <text start="329.159" dur="7.771">little feisty Feist hash tag Feist um</text>
  <text start="334.199" dur="4.89">okay so let&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how we frame this</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="4.199">is the this is how it&amp;#39;s framed right now</text>
  <text start="339.089" dur="4.2">this dossier is broken into several</text>
  <text start="341.129" dur="5.94">different little reports taken amongst a</text>
  <text start="343.289" dur="5.731">period of months slash a year or so this</text>
  <text start="347.069" dur="4.731">I believe being at the top was the most</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="5.13">does it the summarizing document right</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="4.899">and then they go into detail on the</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="4.829">points underneath and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="356.699" dur="5.161">important to mention that none of the</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="5.97">sources are named they&amp;#39;re called a B C D</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="5.82">and E and that speak it their trusted</text>
  <text start="364.949" dur="4.77">compatriots and trusted trusted people</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="6">within the inner workings of the United</text>
  <text start="369.719" dur="5.73">States and Russia so technically if you</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="3.5">want to think about it fusion GPS was</text>
  <text start="375.449" dur="4.861">engaged in Russian collusion or</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="4.75">collusion with the foreign government by</text>
  <text start="380.31" dur="3.87">working with these people to gather this</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="2.639">information and paying them so was the</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="3.359">FBI</text>
  <text start="384.569" dur="7.47">so was DN C so was Hillary Clinton so</text>
  <text start="387.539" dur="5.94">was perkins coie just saying now I found</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="3.571">it interesting when I started reading</text>
  <text start="393.479" dur="3.93">this little document so far Trump has</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="3.43">declined very sweet air real estate</text>
  <text start="397.409" dur="3.341">business deals offered to him in Russia</text>
  <text start="399.04" dur="3.48">probably because there&amp;#39;s really nothing</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="3.81">in Russia there&amp;#39;s nothing they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="402.52" dur="3.81">able to pin to him financially in Russia</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="3.15">so whoever wrote this probably said I</text>
  <text start="406.33" dur="2.79">need to throw a statement in here that</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="3.78">explains why Trump has no business</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="4.38">dealings in Russia if we&amp;#39;re supposing</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="6.75">that Russia is working so closely with</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="6.69">Trump and that&amp;#39;s what they came up with</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="4.46">however there&amp;#39;s a problem because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.19" dur="5.16">gonna start right there</text>
  <text start="422.7" dur="4.21">he&amp;#39;s declined sweetener real estate</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="3.21">business deals offered to him in Russia</text>
  <text start="426.91" dur="2.55">in order to front further the</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="7.83">cultivation</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="10.92">he&amp;#39;s declined them and down here down</text>
  <text start="436.39" dur="6.03">here the Kremlin&amp;#39;s cultivation operation</text>
  <text start="440.38" dur="3.33">on Trump also had comprised offering him</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="2.73">various lucrative real estate</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="3.41">development business deals in Russia</text>
  <text start="445.15" dur="5.13">especially in relation to the ongoing</text>
  <text start="447.12" dur="6.07">2018 World Cup soccer tournament however</text>
  <text start="450.28" dur="5.49">so far for reasons unknown Trump has not</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="5.07">taken up any of these and then if we</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="8">went down to page 8 inside of the</text>
  <text start="458.26" dur="5.51">notorious dossier you&amp;#39;ll see this</text>
  <text start="464.97" dur="5.14">finally regarding Trump&amp;#39;s claimed</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="3.93">minimal investment profile in Russia a</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="3.63">separate source with direct knowledge</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="2.52">said this had not been for want of</text>
  <text start="473.74" dur="3.42">trying</text>
  <text start="474.28" dur="4.98">Trump&amp;#39;s previous efforts had included</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="4.8">exploring the real estate sector in st.</text>
  <text start="479.26" dur="4.71">Petersburg as well as Moscow but in the</text>
  <text start="481.96" dur="5.16">end Trump had had to settle for the use</text>
  <text start="483.97" dur="5.31">of extensive sexual services there from</text>
  <text start="487.12" dur="4.32">local prostitutes rather than business</text>
  <text start="489.28" dur="5.34">success so let me get this straight</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="5.1">on the first page of the dossier you say</text>
  <text start="494.62" dur="4.44">that that you&amp;#39;ve been trying to get</text>
  <text start="496.54" dur="5.94">Trump involved in lucrative business</text>

  <text start="502.48" dur="3.99">eighth page of the dossier and and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.73" dur="4.44">declined them and then on the eighth</text>
  <text start="506.47" dur="4.65">page of the dossier in point six you say</text>
  <text start="509.17" dur="4.2">that he&amp;#39;s been desperate for lucrative</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="6.06">business deals in Russia but he&amp;#39;s had to</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="5.76">settle for sexual services from local</text>
  <text start="517.18" dur="5.22">prostitutes rather than business success</text>
  <text start="519.13" dur="5.37">if he was so desperate for business</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="4.17">success why in the hell wouldn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="6.2">accept the business success that you</text>
  <text start="526.57" dur="4.13">were dangling for him with the carrot</text>
  <text start="530.9" dur="5.01">like a carrot why that doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="5.07">sense hmm</text>
