  <text start="79.15" dur="4.98">guys are looking at this on the screen</text>

  <text start="84.13" dur="4.62">took like every fact I knew about</text>
  <text start="86.26" dur="8.07">Spygate at the time and put it into this</text>
  <text start="88.75" dur="8.25">timeline and then threw it out there for</text>
  <text start="94.33" dur="4.98">folks on on Google Drive and so I</text>
  <text start="97" dur="4.829">decided I would start putting the stuff</text>
  <text start="99.31" dur="3.93">that we&amp;#39;re getting from Jeff into this</text>
  <text start="101.829" dur="3.391">timeline so that&amp;#39;s what I was working on</text>

  <text start="111.46" dur="4.38">me go back to this article because there</text>
  <text start="114.13" dur="4.8">are a lot of blockbuster things inside</text>
  <text start="115.84" dur="6.169">of this markets work article article not</text>
  <text start="118.93" dur="5.88">only is what Jeff&amp;#39;s doing here is so</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="4.811">ridiculously helpful for independent</text>
  <text start="124.81" dur="4.649">journalism as a whole but he&amp;#39;s a damn</text>
  <text start="126.82" dur="9.71">good reporter so he went through this</text>
  <text start="129.459" dur="7.071">testimony and basically um basically</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="6.64">blew blew the lid off of the Spygate</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="7.5">story what it appears is that joke P</text>
  <text start="143.56" dur="5.37">Anka who was the other he was the other</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="5.73">FBI agent that interviewed general Flynn</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="5.4">with Peter struck he was the handler for</text>
  <text start="152.65" dur="3.809">Bruce or so in other words</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="5.85">Christopher steel is fired but from the</text>
  <text start="156.459" dur="7.261">FBI and Christopher steel is then still</text>
  <text start="160.18" dur="7.32">working to deliver information into the</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="7.53">FBI through Bruce or so Bruce or goes</text>
  <text start="167.5" dur="6.87">and meets with Christopher steel several</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="5.67">times 12 of those times are documented</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="6">in 302s the rest of those times are not</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="6.599">documented in 302s but but P Anka is his</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="5.67">handler Bruce ORS handler so steel</text>
  <text start="183.519" dur="5.061">brings information to Bruce or Brazil or</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="5.37">filters the information to Krista Chris</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="5.56">sorry steel brings information to or or</text>
  <text start="191.41" dur="6.81">transfers the information to PN qey and</text>
  <text start="194.14" dur="5.879">then Pianka gives the information to</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="4.29">struck which apparently was happening</text>
  <text start="200.019" dur="6.481">behind it like or wasn&amp;#39;t aware of that</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="7.05">okay so so as I&amp;#39;m looking through all of</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="4.44">this understanding that the timeline</text>
  <text start="209.56" dur="4.17">that we were given by the new york times</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="6.079">back in the day that crossfire hurricane</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="6.18">was started on July 31st because of</text>
  <text start="217.019" dur="5.59">Papadopoulos and knowing that that stuff</text>
  <text start="219.91" dur="7.02">is really ridiculous now at this point</text>
  <text start="222.609" dur="7.201">knowing that Nelly or and Bruce or or</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="5.399">testifies in Congress or meets with</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="5.76">Christopher Steele on July 30th and then</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="6.181">they run back and tell McCabe and struck</text>
  <text start="235.57" dur="6.12">and Paige the next day and then they</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="3.99">start crossfire hurricane and fly over</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="4.109">to meet with downer</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="8.489">it&amp;#39;s very complicated there is a lot in</text>
  <text start="245.799" dur="6.72">here a lot in here so it you know I was</text>
  <text start="250.989" dur="4.051">working on a piece to break this down</text>
  <text start="252.519" dur="4.261">for everybody and as I&amp;#39;m doing this we</text>

  <text start="448.509" dur="4.72">details the chain of custody and the</text>
  <text start="451.49" dur="6.179">questions that Bruce or is getting about</text>
  <text start="453.229" dur="7.791">the chain of custody so can I assume</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="5.78">maybe these questions are being asked by</text>
  <text start="461.02" dur="5.949">Jordan</text>
  <text start="463.449" dur="6.31">mamie but all I know is this excerpt was</text>

  <text start="475.309" dur="3.15">if you help me help me if I&amp;#39;m wrong but</text>
  <text start="477.259" dur="2.76">a stick or a thumb drive would be</text>
  <text start="478.459" dur="3.21">physical evidence for which a chain</text>
  <text start="480.019" dur="3.51">would exist if it were ever needed in</text>
  <text start="481.669" dur="7.321">court and you made yourself a part of</text>
  <text start="483.529" dur="7.081">the chain yes says or can you think of</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="3.959">other instances in your career since</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="4.529">1991 where you made yourself the part of</text>
  <text start="492.949" dur="4.411">a chain of custody so this whole segment</text>
  <text start="495.139" dur="4.471">and then four other times inside of this</text>

  <text start="501.919" dur="6.321">to let you know so anyway chain of</text>
  <text start="506.36" dur="4.349">custody seems to be a problem here right</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="4.299">during the course of our investigation</text>

  <text start="516.469" dur="5.161">unauthorized disclosures to the media</text>

  <text start="1618.269" dur="7.201">portions and interestingly enough they</text>
  <text start="1622.379" dur="7.41">mention in in this or mentions that</text>
  <text start="1625.47" dur="6.449">inside of this um article he and in the</text>
  <text start="1629.789" dur="4.921">transcript he says that the first</text>
  <text start="1631.919" dur="6.901">meeting he had with Steel the attorney</text>
  <text start="1634.71" dur="5.939">for Deripaska was talking to steel and</text>
  <text start="1638.82" dur="3.719">basically saying that there was some</text>

  <text start="1642.539" dur="6.811">Manafort and that you know manna Ford</text>
  <text start="1646.73" dur="7.259">was doing something nefarious with money</text>

  <text start="1654.109" dur="5.051">basic</text>
  <text start="1655.59" dur="8.03">later on I started thinking about the</text>
  <text start="1659.16" dur="8.4">John Solomon article that came out which</text>
  <text start="1663.62" dur="6.01">discussed Deripaska role in the Levinson</text>
  <text start="1667.56" dur="5.43">incident which I detailed back in the</text>
  <text start="1669.63" dur="5.93">day but also discussed how in September</text>
  <text start="1672.99" dur="5.37">of 2016</text>
  <text start="1675.56" dur="6.76">three FBI agents who had worked with</text>
  <text start="1678.36" dur="6.15">Deripaska on the Levinson case went to</text>
  <text start="1682.32" dur="6.27">Deripaska while he was in New York on a</text>
  <text start="1684.51" dur="5.82">UN trip and started badgering him about</text>
  <text start="1688.59" dur="3.48">the fact that Russia was colluding with</text>
  <text start="1690.33" dur="3.96">Trump to influence the election and</text>
  <text start="1692.07" dur="3.48">Deripaska basically said this is</text>
  <text start="1694.29" dur="2.4">complete rubbish I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1695.55" dur="2.61">you&amp;#39;re talking about I can&amp;#39;t even</text>

  <text start="1706.2" dur="9.6">this information to Solomon is Waldman</text>
