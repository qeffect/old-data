  <text start="110.159" dur="2.551">assistance must be accountable for that</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="2.85">money but do we want to characterize</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="3.81">Podesta&amp;#39;s comments below as anything</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="3.12">more than what he said which was just my</text>

  <text start="127.95" dur="4.17">before Mackay and suspended his campaign</text>
  <text start="129.679" dur="3.851">my suggestion is to tie Podesta&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="138.15" dur="3.48">with Stephanie but we&amp;#39;re consistent one</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="3.36">important point is the reporter is</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="3.09">turning podesta statement into a more</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="4.65">rigid doctrine than what he was actually</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="5.099">expression suppressing and John Podesta</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="3.57">had a different email address rights</text>
  <text start="149.819" dur="3.331">back I&amp;#39;m okay with being characterized</text>

  <text start="153.15" dur="3.99">pitchfork populist</text>
  <text start="154.44" dur="4.23">as if that&amp;#39;s any way but we should be</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="3.51">very careful not to seem to be giving</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="4.35">city a pass on the guideposts we are</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="5.22">applying to others but they&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="5.79">path if you guys look back on my channel</text>
