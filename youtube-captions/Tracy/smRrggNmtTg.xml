  <text start="1429.19" dur="5.099">said that these accounts had tweeted I</text>
  <text start="1431.139" dur="5.461">did the searches I did the work I did</text>
  <text start="1434.289" dur="5.311">what they said they did to find these</text>
  <text start="1436.6" dur="5.34">results on like 15 accounts of what they</text>
  <text start="1439.6" dur="5.37">said that they were amplifying the voter</text>
  <text start="1441.94" dur="5.43">fraud hashtag so basically the story was</text>

  <text start="2294.53" dur="5.25">to say so you can get Donald Trump and</text>
  <text start="2297.29" dur="4.68">with that said he started the case well</text>
  <text start="2299.78" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s it and one very important</text>
  <text start="2301.97" dur="4.05">point about this tion that a lot of</text>
  <text start="2303.32" dur="4.53">people don&amp;#39;t understand is that normally</text>
  <text start="2306.02" dur="4.05">Farrah&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t prosecuted you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="2307.85" dur="5.16">but more than that is that when they</text>
  <text start="2310.07" dur="5.82">receive a example an issue from the Fair</text>
  <text start="2313.01" dur="5.04">office to file affero it&amp;#39;s very simple</text>
  <text start="2315.89" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s very easy to fill out according to</text>
  <text start="2318.05" dur="6.27">sources that I&amp;#39;ve spoken to Flynn Spira</text>
  <text start="2321.17" dur="4.95">was so extraordinarily complicated it</text>
  <text start="2324.32" dur="5.16">was almost as if they had crafted the</text>
  <text start="2326.12" dur="4.86">ferret to try to corner him into say</text>
  <text start="2329.48" dur="3.3">making a statement that wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2330.98" dur="3.81">correct so that&amp;#39;s something that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2332.78" dur="4.74">looking into as well now the judge has</text>
  <text start="2334.79" dur="4.95">not decided yet whether or not to allow</text>
  <text start="2337.52" dur="4.41">the government to call him a</text>
  <text start="2339.74" dur="4.26">co-conspirator so this still hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="2341.93" dur="5.46">decided it&amp;#39;s expected to be decided soon</text>
  <text start="2344" dur="4.98">all right Sarah Carter investigator she</text>
  <text start="2347.39" dur="3.12">did a great job of explaining what</text>
  <text start="2348.98" dur="5.43">happened do you need me to clarify any</text>
  <text start="2350.51" dur="6.39">of it yes the whole thing and also and</text>

  <text start="2452.209" dur="5.76">itself is very very complicated but at</text>
  <text start="2454.699" dur="6.931">the basics of it in after he had begun</text>
  <text start="2457.969" dur="6.24">the cooperation that he was doing they</text>
  <text start="2461.63" dur="6.209">wanted him to retroactively Lee file a</text>

  <text start="2650.77" dur="3.6">the day before the trial decide that</text>
  <text start="2653.079" dur="3.061">you&amp;#39;re not going to have this guy</text>
  <text start="2654.37" dur="3.48">testify for you on your Denis the</text>
  <text start="2656.14" dur="4.11">government&amp;#39;s behalf after all of this</text>
  <text start="2657.85" dur="4.35">cooperation and all the money he&amp;#39;s spent</text>
  <text start="2660.25" dur="4.23">and the time he&amp;#39;s invested in everything</text>
  <text start="2662.2" dur="4.08">just because he won&amp;#39;t lie for you and</text>
  <text start="2664.48" dur="4.08">you have no way to prove anything that</text>
  <text start="2666.28" dur="4.01">you&amp;#39;re saying the judge said you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2668.56" dur="4.35">do that you can&amp;#39;t call him an unindicted</text>
  <text start="2670.29" dur="4.93">co-conspirator you&amp;#39;ve just spent months</text>
  <text start="2672.91" dur="4.62">saying how cooperative he was and how he</text>
  <text start="2675.22" dur="3.99">was a big part of your case which leads</text>
  <text start="2677.53" dur="4.29">me to believe they don&amp;#39;t have very much</text>
  <text start="2679.21" dur="5.34">of a case I I would I would have to</text>
  <text start="2681.82" dur="4.02">agree with you on that then and as far</text>
  <text start="2684.55" dur="3.15">as you don&amp;#39;t have the right to call</text>
  <text start="2685.84" dur="5.64">somebody an unindicted co-conspirator</text>
  <text start="2687.7" dur="7.05">well I think that I think a lot of this</text>
  <text start="2691.48" dur="5.06">just like judge Ellis pointed out we all</text>
  <text start="2694.75" dur="4.95">know what this is really about and</text>
  <text start="2696.54" dur="6.73">especially since these trials are being</text>
  <text start="2699.7" dur="6.48">covered in earnest by the media no</text>
  <text start="2703.27" dur="5.79">matter where it all goes and how it all</text>
  <text start="2706.18" dur="5.4">ends up as long as somebody says out</text>
  <text start="2709.06" dur="5.21">loud that this person is an unindicted</text>
  <text start="2711.58" dur="4.86">co-conspirator it creates a headline</text>
  <text start="2714.27" dur="4.6">everything that could be used they use</text>
  <text start="2716.44" dur="4.56">every piece of the animal in this case I</text>
  <text start="2718.87" dur="3.81">hope that they do because at the end of</text>
  <text start="2721" dur="3.84">the day the judges opinions are out</text>
  <text start="2722.68" dur="3.84">there like it&amp;#39;s not a question you know</text>

  <text start="3111.51" dur="5.04">look listen there I&amp;#39;m reading more and</text>
  <text start="3115.02" dur="3.45">more because when I did my piece on</text>
  <text start="3116.55" dur="6">Epstein which I did like a summary piece</text>
  <text start="3118.47" dur="5.61">explaining the entire case from 2007</text>
  <text start="3122.55" dur="3.75">onward so I&amp;#39;d like one piece that</text>
  <text start="3124.08" dur="4.8">explains everything</text>
  <text start="3126.3" dur="5.1">it seems to me that he&amp;#39;s been you know</text>
  <text start="3128.88" dur="4.26">even in the past and as far back as 2011</text>
  <text start="3131.4" dur="5.82">he was dripping out that he was</text>
  <text start="3133.14" dur="6.21">pressured strongly pressured even told</text>
  <text start="3137.22" dur="4.02">at one point that Epstein was an</text>
  <text start="3139.35" dur="3.81">intelligence asset and that he should</text>
  <text start="3141.24" dur="4.14">leave it alone right</text>
  <text start="3143.16" dur="4.53">this one I&amp;#39;m talking about so people</text>
  <text start="3145.38" dur="4.11">like like Nancy Pelosi coming out and</text>
  <text start="3147.69" dur="3.87">Chuck Schumer saying Acosta needs to</text>
  <text start="3149.49" dur="5.31">step down you better mind your P&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="3151.56" dur="4.71">Q&amp;#39;s people because um I think I forget</text>
  <text start="3154.8" dur="3.51">who it was that came out with open</text>
  <text start="3156.27" dur="5.03">secrets link of how much money Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="3158.31" dur="6.2">Epstein has given to just Chuck Schumer</text>
  <text start="3161.3" dur="5.68">watch your asses people just watch</text>
  <text start="3164.51" dur="3.97">that&amp;#39;s why I was saying before with with</text>
  <text start="3166.98" dur="3.87">the absent of the acosta that would be a</text>
  <text start="3168.48" dur="3.87">constant thing again I I want to I want</text>
  <text start="3170.85" dur="3.39">to get a clearer picture on this as much</text>
  <text start="3172.35" dur="3.93">as anybody else does of course our</text>
  <text start="3174.24" dur="4.35">motivation for getting clear pictures</text>
  <text start="3176.28" dur="4.77">are always to sit are always the dip the</text>
  <text start="3178.59" dur="5.7">difference in the the matter but when it</text>
  <text start="3181.05" dur="5.82">comes to him as labor secretary I I</text>
  <text start="3184.29" dur="6.15">highly doubt that his itemized</text>
  <text start="3186.87" dur="5.76">prosecutorial record was coming up when</text>
  <text start="3190.44" dur="2.82">he was interviewing for the position in</text>
  <text start="3192.63" dur="3.66">labor</text>
  <text start="3193.26" dur="5.79">well there&amp;#39;s confirmation about this</text>
  <text start="3196.29" dur="4.34">particular case yeah yeah what he said</text>
  <text start="3199.05" dur="5.13">in his confirmation hearing was that</text>
  <text start="3200.63" dur="5.62">what he ended up doing with Epstein was</text>
  <text start="3204.18" dur="3.72">a much harsher penalty than what would</text>
  <text start="3206.25" dur="4.38">have happened if the case stayed in the</text>
  <text start="3207.9" dur="4.77">state hands which after reading in depth</text>
  <text start="3210.63" dur="4.17">of Miami Herald reporting I absolutely</text>
  <text start="3212.67" dur="3.27">believe because the two detectives with</text>
  <text start="3214.8" dur="3.06">one detective and the Chief of Police</text>
  <text start="3215.94" dur="4.38">were on that case said the state</text>
  <text start="3217.86" dur="4.41">attorney that was helping was leaking</text>
  <text start="3220.32" dur="4.26">their information to Epstein&amp;#39;s team and</text>
  <text start="3222.27" dur="4.74">in addition to being to doing that would</text>
  <text start="3224.58" dur="4.41">stop issuing subpoenas or greatly slow</text>
  <text start="3227.01" dur="5.1">down the issuance of subpoenas in the</text>
  <text start="3228.99" dur="4.77">case and were kind of basically drilling</text>
  <text start="3232.11" dur="4.11">the entire thing that&amp;#39;s right I had a</text>
  <text start="3233.76" dur="5.76">call I had a call on Monday night about</text>
  <text start="3236.22" dur="5.19">that who pointed that out a friend of</text>
  <text start="3239.52" dur="4.44">the show pointed that out how the the</text>
  <text start="3241.41" dur="5.73">the local sheriff was incensed that all</text>
  <text start="3243.96" dur="5.61">of this work to nab this guy was was</text>
  <text start="3247.14" dur="5.31">being derailed and then of course he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3249.57" dur="4.86">swept up by the feds and turned into an</text>
  <text start="3252.45" dur="4.71">intelligence asset well he might have</text>
  <text start="3254.43" dur="5.16">been an intelligence asset before he was</text>
  <text start="3257.16" dur="3.87">swept up by the feds and did you know</text>
  <text start="3259.59" dur="3.81">real quick I don&amp;#39;t want to leave this</text>
  <text start="3261.03" dur="4.08">actually the detective I forget rap-rap</text>
  <text start="3263.4" dur="3.87">in here I believe his name was he passed</text>
  <text start="3265.11" dur="5.19">away right after the Miami Herald story</text>
  <text start="3267.27" dur="5.51">came out of an illness he was 50 years</text>
  <text start="3270.3" dur="7.71">old he got sick suddenly and died geez</text>
  <text start="3272.78" dur="7.03">so there&amp;#39;s that did you did you hear two</text>

  <text start="3284.7" dur="6.24">Spacey criminal case may be dismissed I</text>
  <text start="3287.19" dur="5.16">saw I saw him I saw hints of that in</text>
  <text start="3290.94" dur="3.87">just headlines but I did not read</text>
  <text start="3292.35" dur="4.11">articles yeah there&amp;#39;s a cell phone in</text>
  <text start="3294.81" dur="3.6">question that supposedly has a ton of</text>
  <text start="3296.46" dur="3.99">evidence on it in regards to what</text>
  <text start="3298.41" dur="4.92">happened with Kevin Spacey and what what</text>
  <text start="3300.45" dur="5.67">the abuse was and the cell phone was</text>
  <text start="3303.33" dur="4.23">just mysteriously lost and the gentleman</text>
  <text start="3306.12" dur="3.36">in you know the victim in the case</text>
  <text start="3307.56" dur="3.72">testified he had not done anything to</text>
  <text start="3309.48" dur="3.78">modify or change the messages on the</text>

  <text start="3324.569" dur="4.411">actually manipulated that evidence and</text>
  <text start="3326.73" dur="4.139">all I can think of is what we talked</text>
