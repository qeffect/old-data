  <text start="0.03" dur="6.66">good afternoon it is Monday May 7th 2018</text>
  <text start="4.14" dur="5.01">at 352 p.m. so what I&amp;#39;m going to do now</text>
  <text start="6.69" dur="5.369">is as promised go through some of the</text>
  <text start="9.15" dur="5.069">256 page house permanent Select</text>
  <text start="12.059" dur="3.181">Committee on Intelligence report there</text>
  <text start="14.219" dur="3.421">are a bunch of really interesting</text>
  <text start="15.24" dur="4.26">factoids in here that have been either</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="4.5">just not paid attention to or overlooked</text>
  <text start="19.5" dur="4.65">or you know it&amp;#39;s hard to read because a</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="4.68">lot of it was redacted a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="24.15" dur="4.199">redacted but not the important parts and</text>
  <text start="26.82" dur="3.51">what I found is going through this is</text>
  <text start="28.349" dur="4.98">that well they redact something in the</text>
  <text start="30.33" dur="4.92">first paragraph of a section they leave</text>
  <text start="33.329" dur="3.181">it unredacted later on so you can kind</text>
  <text start="35.25" dur="2.82">of put two and two together and figure</text>
  <text start="36.51" dur="2.67">out what it means and who they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="6.419">talking about and what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="8.699">about so this is the report that the</text>
  <text start="44.489" dur="5.671">Comey sections were redacted from</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="4.171">regarding Comey and McCabe&amp;#39;s testimony</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="4.35">that flynn did not or didn&amp;#39;t appear to</text>
  <text start="52.05" dur="5.34">be lying and they were redacted and then</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="4.59">they were leer unredacted and everybody</text>
  <text start="57.39" dur="3.899">kind of got upset about why they would</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="3.75">have remained redacted and how they did</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="5.251">that while they remained redacted until</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="4.92">they weren&amp;#39;t anymore and ongoing</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="2.97">investigations there&amp;#39;s a ton of</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="4.02">different reasons why but the at the end</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="4.35">of the day they were unredacted and it</text>
  <text start="71.79" dur="3.39">was by the same people that everyone is</text>
  <text start="73.86" dur="3.96">accusing of covering up their</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="6.03">malfeasance so it&amp;#39;s just a difficult</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="5.61">topic to navigate it&amp;#39;s a difficult it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="4.199">just a difficult it&amp;#39;s a difficult thing</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="4.92">everybody&amp;#39;s on edge everybody wants to</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.92">see arrests everybody thinks that you</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="3.6">know because they&amp;#39;re being kind of</text>
  <text start="90.329" dur="3.061">force-fed the narrative that sessions is</text>
  <text start="91.95" dur="3.57">doing nothing they think he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="3.659">nothing ultimately I will get a ton of</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="2.97">comments saying you don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="2.701">you&amp;#39;re talking about sessions is not</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="3.33">doing anything he&amp;#39;s just sitting on his</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="4.11">hands and I just want to say to the</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="3.869">people that are saying that the reason</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="3.48">why you think that sessions isn&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="4.14">anything is because there are no</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="5.489">damaging leaks leaking out of the</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="5.311">sessions Justice Department if there</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="3.93">were leaks you would know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="3.54">on but because they&amp;#39;ve been able to plug</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="3.091">up those holes you&amp;#39;re not getting any</text>
  <text start="118.68" dur="3.06">insider information</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re running Criminal Investigations</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="4.229">under the correct circumstances in the</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="4.67">right way and you&amp;#39;re not getting any</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="5.441">leaks so therefore everybody jumps to</text>
  <text start="129.17" dur="6.23">fire sessions it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.41" dur="6.39">Ben what January to January 12 13 14 15</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="5.67">months less than that that he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="137.8" dur="5.79">confirmed sessions and he&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="141.07" dur="4.62">over what this man is doing several</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="5.16">times in several different videos what</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="4.38">he did with who burr you know what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.75" dur="3.75">doing in terms of all the other</text>
  <text start="150.07" dur="4.71">investigations that are going on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="4.83">happening behind the scenes there has</text>
  <text start="154.78" dur="4.77">not been a special prosecutor or US</text>
  <text start="157.33" dur="5.15">attorney assigned to an IG ever</text>
  <text start="159.55" dur="8.63">I tried searching I could never find one</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="7.69">so it&amp;#39;s unprecedented do we want to try</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="4.06">these people in the court of public</text>
  <text start="170.17" dur="2.76">opinion or do we want to try them in a</text>
  <text start="172.24" dur="3.02">court of law</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="6.03">do we want arrests or do we want</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="5.26">convictions because they could run out</text>
  <text start="178.96" dur="3.84">and round everybody up and arrests</text>
  <text start="180.52" dur="3.69">everybody today and we may not be able</text>
  <text start="182.8" dur="3.87">to get convictions because they&amp;#39;ll skate</text>
  <text start="184.21" dur="4.65">and the cases aren&amp;#39;t finished so as I</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="3.84">understand everybody&amp;#39;s mad and want I</text>
  <text start="188.86" dur="3.66">need one tail I would love to see an</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="3.9">indictment an arrest of somebody McCabe</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="5.34">would be the first one that I would</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="7.11">think but these things take their own</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="5.599">time they do it&amp;#39;s just it sucks it sucks</text>
  <text start="201.52" dur="4.98">it really does but it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="4.481">so I have some notes and then there is</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="3.35">one big section I just want to read</text>
  <text start="207.94" dur="4.26">through because it&amp;#39;s full of information</text>
  <text start="209.85" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s full of information so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="212.2" dur="4.68">start on page 12 and on page 12 we</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="6.54">actually learned something that we</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="6.359">didn&amp;#39;t know before here it is what we</text>
  <text start="221.83" dur="2.7">did now because of Sundance but we</text>
  <text start="223.239" dur="3.511">didn&amp;#39;t know the committee&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.53" dur="5.459">investigation also reviewed the opening</text>
  <text start="226.75" dur="5.82">and summer of 2016 of an FBI Enterprise</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="5.941">counterintelligence investigation into</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="7.68">blank Trump campaign associates blank</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="6.87">Carter page blank blank blank because of</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.29">the quote sensitivity of the matter the</text>
  <text start="242.8" dur="6.6">FBI did not notify congressional</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="6.65">leadership about the investigation this</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="4.07">means that the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="4.5">investigation was not only on</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="7.66">Papadopoulos but on manna fort gates</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="8.75">Papadopoulos end Carter page so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="5.59">gonna prove to that that t you why why</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="6.06">I&amp;#39;m gonna prove to you why that is in</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="5.19">just a few minutes on page 38 which is</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="2.88">the next page that I want to go to</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="6.12">because the rest of its word it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="273.38" dur="9.39">redacted we start getting into gusoff or</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="6.51">- and stuff like that and they say this</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="3.27">as frustrating they say Russian state</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="3.39">actors and third-party intermediaries</text>
  <text start="286.04" dur="3.69">are responsible for the dissemination of</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="3.9">documents and communications stolen from</text>
  <text start="289.73" dur="4.47">us political order organizations</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="4.67">now they say third-party intermediaries</text>
  <text start="294.2" dur="5.64">here we don&amp;#39;t know who they are</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="5.05">everything in here is like redacted and</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="6.18">we can&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t tell who they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="7.46">talking about or whatever but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="6.36">interesting to me is there is one part</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="5.2">here they talk about DC leaks who was</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="4.02">actually the first group to release the</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="4.77">DNC emails it wasn&amp;#39;t WikiLeaks WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="5.31">took them up but DC leaks was a separate</text>
  <text start="318.98" dur="5.64">group that released the DCE the DNC</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="5.79">emails and gusoff or two was also intend</text>
  <text start="324.62" dur="5.16">on releasing nonsense claiming</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="4.44">responsibility for passing emails to</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="3.51">Julian Assange and you guys can look</text>
  <text start="331.94" dur="6.69">back on my channel because I covered</text>
  <text start="333.29" dur="8.85">this a lot now what&amp;#39;s interesting here</text>
  <text start="338.63" dur="8.31">is that he and goose for two identifies</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="8.07">himself as a Romanian and the Clinton</text>
  <text start="346.94" dur="5.729">campaign identified gore the Clintons</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="3.48">the establishment Democrats etc</text>
  <text start="352.669" dur="3.441">CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="4.71">identifies GRU SCU&amp;#39;s Affairs Russian and</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="4.03">here it says multiple cybersecurity</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="3.42">firms have evaluated goose&amp;#39; for two</text>
  <text start="360.14" dur="4.11">activity and have published evidence</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="5.25">that the online persona used a Russian</text>
  <text start="364.25" dur="4.71">based VPN service to transmit files and</text>
  <text start="367.07" dur="3.599">communicate additionally posted</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="5.64">documents were processed on a computer</text>
  <text start="370.669" dur="6.271">using Russian language settings now you</text>
  <text start="374.6" dur="3.72">wouldn&amp;#39;t use a VPN to make yourself look</text>
  <text start="376.94" dur="3.63">like you&amp;#39;re in Russia if you&amp;#39;re not in</text>
  <text start="378.32" dur="4.11">Russia in other words you&amp;#39;re using a VPN</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="5.37">to hide where you are you&amp;#39;re not using</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="5.31">it to show where you are so using a VPN</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="4.229">to show you&amp;#39;re in Russia from a</text>
  <text start="387.74" dur="3.99">layperson would look at it and say okay</text>
  <text start="390.169" dur="2.761">well this guy&amp;#39;s in Russia but anyone who</text>
  <text start="391.73" dur="3.78">knows what they&amp;#39;re doing is gonna know</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="3.549">he&amp;#39;s using a VPN to mask his actual</text>
  <text start="395.51" dur="2.98">location</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="4.291">and I think these people would have done</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="4.079">a really good a good service to</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="5.959">themselves if they would have just taken</text>
  <text start="402.569" dur="5.91">a few minutes to research the forensic</text>
  <text start="406.729" dur="4.36">investigative reporting and</text>
  <text start="408.479" dur="5.94">investigative work done by the forensic</text>
  <text start="411.089" dur="5.55">ATAR and with integrity a g2 space</text>
  <text start="414.419" dur="3.93">because they took the documents that</text>
  <text start="416.639" dur="3.81">were provided to us from gusoff or two</text>
  <text start="418.349" dur="4.201">and they were able to find out a hell of</text>
  <text start="420.449" dur="4.68">a lot more than what these people did</text>
  <text start="422.55" dur="4.979">they also mentioned here at this point</text>
  <text start="425.129" dur="5.431">that he was unable to maintain fluency</text>
  <text start="427.529" dur="5.85">and what his quote you know native</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="5.52">language would be which is Romanian well</text>
  <text start="433.379" dur="4.771">he can&amp;#39;t he can&amp;#39;t he can&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="436.08" dur="3.32">Romanian so he&amp;#39;s not Romanian but</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re not saying he&amp;#39;s Russian either</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="3.789">they&amp;#39;re not saying he&amp;#39;s Russian either</text>
  <text start="441.3" dur="4.949">then they go into how WikiLeaks is just</text>
  <text start="443.189" dur="8.7">a horrible organization this this just</text>
  <text start="446.249" dur="8.22">all pissed me off then before I move on</text>
  <text start="451.889" dur="3.601">on that on WikiLeaks actually I wanted</text>
  <text start="454.469" dur="2.82">to talk about um</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="4.949">they say that WikiLeaks got their</text>
  <text start="457.289" dur="4.74">information from Russians I have a</text>
  <text start="460.439" dur="3.63">laundry list of reasons why we know</text>
  <text start="462.029" dur="4.021">that&amp;#39;s not the case but they have a</text>
  <text start="464.069" dur="7.53">sitting congressman that they can go and</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="9.359">talk to Dana Rohrabacher they can go and</text>
  <text start="471.599" dur="5.31">speak to Dana and none of these people</text>
  <text start="475.409" dur="3.6">seem to have been approached by Muller</text>
  <text start="476.909" dur="4.13">we haven&amp;#39;t had Muller talked to</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="6.09">WikiLeaks apparently or kim.com</text>
  <text start="481.039" dur="6.31">apparently you know as per them we know</text>
  <text start="485.099" dur="6.6">as per Caputo&amp;#39;s interviews that were</text>
  <text start="487.349" dur="5.97">very well scripted he was talking to he</text>
  <text start="491.699" dur="3.3">was talking to the special counsel and</text>
  <text start="493.319" dur="3.541">he says the special counsel is looking</text>
  <text start="494.999" dur="4.44">into WikiLeaks DNC leaks gusoff arc</text>
  <text start="496.86" dur="4.619">cetera so I don&amp;#39;t know who we believe</text>
  <text start="499.439" dur="4.59">there it&amp;#39;s starting to get a little</text>
  <text start="501.479" dur="4.68">crazy guys lots of information and</text>
  <text start="504.029" dur="4.32">disinformation out there but we need not</text>
  <text start="506.159" dur="3.63">look further than the footnotes to know</text>
  <text start="508.349" dur="4.98">who they were talking to regarding</text>
  <text start="509.789" dur="5.25">gusoff or to etc this is all the social</text>
  <text start="513.329" dur="2.76">media stuff that they went over but if</text>
  <text start="515.039" dur="4.85">you take a look at the footnotes and</text>
  <text start="516.089" dur="6.51">their references here you can see</text>
  <text start="519.889" dur="4.421">they&amp;#39;re talking to CrowdStrike they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="522.599" dur="5.631">talking to vice they&amp;#39;re talking to</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="3.92">threat connect they&amp;#39;re talking to</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="4.36">you know the New York Times they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="3.33">talking anybody that knows what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="3.9">doing they&amp;#39;re talking up to the people</text>
  <text start="534.98" dur="3.63">that wouldn&amp;#39;t let anybody else see the</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="3.84">server&amp;#39;s I mean I can go on and on about</text>
  <text start="538.61" dur="3.36">the DNC hack and we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="540.59" dur="4.77">it a little bit more in this document</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="6.3">because they reference it to on page 49</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="4.32">they say that even though the government</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="3.75">knew that folks had supposedly been</text>
  <text start="549.68" dur="4.98">hacked by the Russians the FBI only</text>

  <text start="606.05" dur="4.29">and that they did nothing about anything</text>
  <text start="608.48" dur="3.45">they found in those months until after</text>
  <text start="610.34" dur="3.24">the election it already happened which</text>
  <text start="611.93" dur="2.91">fits itself nicely into the fact that</text>
  <text start="613.58" dur="2.61">they were planning this coup and they</text>

  <text start="729.339" dur="4.081">the FBI told the DNC multiple times</text>
  <text start="732.16" dur="4.98">there are attempts being made to have</text>

  <text start="748.39" dur="2.91">would have sent up a much larger flare</text>
  <text start="749.98" dur="2.49">we would have just kept banging and</text>
  <text start="751.3" dur="3.75">banging on the door knowing what I know</text>
  <text start="752.47" dur="4.53">now we made extensive efforts to notify</text>
  <text start="755.05" dur="4.2">I might have walked over there myself</text>
  <text start="757" dur="4.62">knowing what I know now and Jed Johnson</text>
  <text start="759.25" dur="3.51">says in retrospect it would be easy for</text>
  <text start="761.62" dur="2.73">me to say that I should have brought a</text>

  <text start="764.35" dur="4.65">the DNC in late summer with the benefit</text>
  <text start="766.42" dur="5.099">of hindsight so they were trying to tell</text>
  <text start="769" dur="4.41">them the FBI made lots of attempts to</text>
  <text start="771.519" dur="6.091">tell them and they just didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="773.41" dur="6.239">hear it now 51 we also start getting</text>
  <text start="777.61" dur="4.14">into what page 51 we also start getting</text>
  <text start="779.649" dur="3.421">into the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="781.75" dur="3.69">Security&amp;#39;s kind of in</text>

  <text start="785.44" dur="3.6">wanted to take control of the</text>

  <text start="789.04" dur="3.84">elections and in this report they detail</text>
  <text start="791.41" dur="4.76">how the states really pushed back</text>
  <text start="792.88" dur="7.83">against that and if you remember Georgia</text>
  <text start="796.17" dur="5.98">specifically had a problem with the the</text>
  <text start="800.71" dur="3.75">fact that government could have hacked</text>
  <text start="802.15" dur="4.62">their own servers and they had proof of</text>
  <text start="804.46" dur="4.68">it and they sent letters you know and</text>
  <text start="806.77" dur="4.08">basically we didn&amp;#39;t they say we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="809.14" dur="3.54">see any you know intrusion for many</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="5.04">state actors we saw intrusion from the</text>
  <text start="812.68" dur="5.16">federal government and they refused</text>
  <text start="815.89" dur="3.66">federal help now this is all happening</text>
  <text start="817.84" dur="3.06">at the same exact time that Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="819.55" dur="4.89">is saying that the election is rigged</text>
  <text start="820.9" dur="7.05">and Barack Obama is saying of course the</text>
  <text start="824.44" dur="6.59">elections not rigged it&amp;#39;s ridiculous we</text>
  <text start="827.95" dur="5.91">have policies in place to keep yeah</text>
  <text start="831.03" dur="5.56">happening at the exact same time another</text>
  <text start="833.86" dur="8.57">really interesting thing in here that I</text>
  <text start="836.59" dur="8.13">found Susan Rice and Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="3.67">testify that the decision was made to</text>
  <text start="844.72" dur="4.02">have the President of the United States</text>
  <text start="846.1" dur="4.23">speak directly to Putin and confront him</text>
  <text start="848.74" dur="3.12">with knowledge that we were aware of his</text>
  <text start="850.33" dur="3.15">efforts on a variety of fronts and that</text>
  <text start="851.86" dur="3">it was unacceptable and that the</text>
  <text start="853.48" dur="3.54">discussion took place during a pull</text>
  <text start="854.86" dur="4.32">aside at one of the the G meetings</text>
  <text start="857.02" dur="4.89">either seven or twenty in the early fall</text>
  <text start="859.18" dur="5.01">and then Susan Rice corroborated that in</text>
  <text start="861.91" dur="4.83">testimony that Obama and President Putin</text>
  <text start="864.19" dur="4.26">discussed Russian meddling in the 2016</text>
  <text start="866.74" dur="5.46">election at the end of bilateral</text>
  <text start="868.45" dur="6.6">discussions in early September 2016 is</text>
  <text start="872.2" dur="4.17">this is this possible that that maybe</text>
  <text start="875.05" dur="2.82">they weren&amp;#39;t talking about Russian</text>
  <text start="876.37" dur="3.81">collusion and that the way we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="877.87" dur="4.53">cost accustomed to learning about it</text>
  <text start="880.18" dur="4.5">maybe maybe it&amp;#39;s possible they were</text>
  <text start="882.4" dur="5.3">saying hey we need your help I&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="884.68" dur="6.36">more flexibility after she&amp;#39;s elected</text>
  <text start="887.7" dur="5.2">because that&amp;#39;s what it looks like now</text>
  <text start="891.04" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m not pointing fingers I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="892.9" dur="7.41">just telling you it&amp;#39;s possible it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="896.23" dur="5.76">possible because first of all they</text>
  <text start="900.31" dur="3.33">hadn&amp;#39;t let any of this on publicly yet</text>
  <text start="901.99" dur="2.88">they hadn&amp;#39;t let anybody know they were</text>
  <text start="903.64" dur="2.91">trying to make it like it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="904.87" dur="3.12">happening they were trying to ignore it</text>
  <text start="906.55" dur="3.36">why is he gonna go talk directly to</text>
  <text start="907.99" dur="4.35">Putin in a pull aside that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="909.91" dur="4.2">important this is to him this man Putin</text>
  <text start="912.34" dur="4.67">is supposedly trying to in it you know</text>
  <text start="914.11" dur="5.49">interfere in the United States dem</text>
  <text start="917.01" dur="4.24">process of electing its leader and he</text>
  <text start="919.6" dur="4.95">talks to him at a brief pull aside at</text>
  <text start="921.25" dur="7.1">the g20 summit you know okay thanks</text>
  <text start="924.55" dur="3.8">Obama I mean if this is legit</text>
  <text start="930.27" dur="4.66">just saying</text>
  <text start="931.66" dur="6.09">and then they specifically they</text>
  <text start="934.93" dur="4.14">specifically state that the reason why</text>
  <text start="937.75" dur="4.17">they didn&amp;#39;t come forward with any of the</text>
  <text start="939.07" dur="6.06">information is because of this and</text>
  <text start="941.92" dur="5.43">listen to this they didn&amp;#39;t want Trump to</text>
  <text start="945.13" dur="3.6">be right it was dealing with extremely</text>
  <text start="947.35" dur="2.79">sensitive intelligence and had to</text>
  <text start="948.73" dur="2.97">consider the impacts of jeopardizing</text>

  <text start="951.7" dur="4.14">declassifying furthermore in the midst</text>
  <text start="954.04" dur="3.75">of an ongoing campaign it had to</text>
  <text start="955.84" dur="3.6">carefully consider any public statements</text>
  <text start="957.79" dur="3.03">or actions as it didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="959.44" dur="4.08">perceived as taking sides or</text>
  <text start="960.82" dur="5.16">politicizing the election or according</text>
  <text start="963.52" dur="4.53">to former secretary Johnson fueling</text>
  <text start="965.98" dur="6.6">claims that the election was quote</text>
  <text start="968.05" dur="6.3">rigged well then it appears from this</text>
  <text start="972.58" dur="4.74">report in their testimony they were and</text>
  <text start="974.35" dur="5.4">very very fearful that the election was</text>
  <text start="977.32" dur="3.63">raped just like Donald Trump was saying</text>
  <text start="979.75" dur="2.52">now of course Donald Trump wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="980.95" dur="3.33">talking about the same thing that</text>
  <text start="982.27" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re trying to put forward here but</text>
  <text start="984.28" dur="5.55">my you know what we thought at the time</text>
  <text start="986.2" dur="6.06">and and we thought that they were trying</text>
  <text start="989.83" dur="4.26">to take control of the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="992.26" dur="4.95">locally so that they could rig the vote</text>
  <text start="994.09" dur="4.26">internally from the DHS and elections</text>
  <text start="997.21" dur="2.31">are supposed to be local they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="998.35" dur="3.12">supposed to be state controlled they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="999.52" dur="4.44">supposed to be just like Obama said in</text>
  <text start="1001.47" dur="4.7">that clip so I&amp;#39;m really glad that the</text>
  <text start="1003.96" dur="4.16">states pushed back against this nonsense</text>
  <text start="1006.17" dur="4.09">because it was nonsense</text>

  <text start="2815.17" dur="5.1">reports from Steele in June 2016 at the</text>

  <text start="2850.68" dur="3.72">important that mr. Steele hear from me</text>

  <text start="2859.56" dur="5.91">meeting but the firm was not able to</text>
  <text start="2862.11" dur="6.42">locate any so here we have a very very</text>

  <text start="2884.61" dur="11.52">from fusion to the DNC Perkins Perkins</text>
  <text start="2892.79" dur="6.49">so that&amp;#39;s in there let me get a lot of</text>
  <text start="2896.13" dur="5.37">sourcing and emails and footnotes hear</text>
  <text start="2899.28" dur="5.25">about the exaction and the executive</text>
  <text start="2901.5" dur="6.68">sessions that they interviewed and I can</text>
  <text start="2904.53" dur="9.92">guarantee you there&amp;#39;s something in here</text>
  <text start="2908.18" dur="9.28">and then they start going into leaks and</text>
  <text start="2914.45" dur="4.54">to summarize you guys I&amp;#39;ll put the link</text>
  <text start="2917.46" dur="4.65">to this in the description box for you</text>
  <text start="2918.99" dur="7.56">but starting on around page 109 which</text>
  <text start="2922.11" dur="12.3">would be 99 of the document you get a</text>
  <text start="2926.55" dur="9.96">chart which is all of this is redacted</text>
  <text start="2934.41" dur="4.35">cuz it&amp;#39;s CIA but here you get a chart</text>
  <text start="2936.51" dur="5.01">here&amp;#39;s the article the quotes that</text>
  <text start="2938.76" dur="4.65">mirror a mirror the intelligence</text>
  <text start="2941.52" dur="6.18">community assessment and the final</text>
  <text start="2943.41" dur="6">findings so obviously someone who</text>
  <text start="2947.7" dur="3.36">created this asset assessment was</text>
  <text start="2949.41" dur="4.89">leaking to the media and here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2951.06" dur="7.32">proof of why so that implicates some</text>
  <text start="2954.3" dur="5.94">people very strongly they take out of</text>
  <text start="2958.38" dur="3.63">the findings they take quotes in the</text>

  <text start="2962.01" dur="2.73">for you</text>
  <text start="2962.55" dur="3.48">so this just details all the leaks</text>

  <text start="2992.039" dur="3.99">got anything out of this and it you know</text>
  <text start="2993.569" dur="4.92">you can see the partisanship in it in</text>
