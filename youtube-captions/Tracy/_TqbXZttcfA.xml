  <text start="0.03" dur="7.65">good morning everyone it is Tuesday July</text>
  <text start="2.429" dur="7.531">3rd 2018 at 8:35 a.m. Eastern Time I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="7.68" dur="5.339">been working really hard over the past</text>
  <text start="9.96" dur="5.099">week or so on a story about Eric Prince</text>
  <text start="13.019" dur="5.221">and the special counsel but as I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="5.911">this I&amp;#39;m kind of realizing that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="5.52">a lot more here obviously Eric Prince is</text>
  <text start="20.97" dur="5.61">a very interesting character with a lot</text>
  <text start="23.76" dur="5.22">of connections into this whole story but</text>
  <text start="26.58" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s always come back to Dana</text>
  <text start="28.98" dur="5.79">Rohrabacher for me with Prince in a lot</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="5.7">of ways and I&amp;#39;m gonna do this separate</text>
  <text start="34.77" dur="3.84">standalone piece on Prince and the</text>
  <text start="36.75" dur="3.6">special counsel but I do want to bring</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="4.35">up just one thing that kind of</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="5.52">foreshadows that for you everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="42.96" dur="5.22">kind of saying like that you know robert</text>
  <text start="45.87" dur="4.619">muller is after prince he&amp;#39;s confiscated</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="4.019">his laptop and his stuff well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="3.811">really what happened</text>
  <text start="52.199" dur="5.401">Eric prince voluntarily handed that</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="5.73">stuff over and betsy Woodruff from The</text>
  <text start="57.6" dur="5.34">Daily Beast got an interview with him</text>
  <text start="60.03" dur="5.01">one-on-one it&amp;#39;s here in text form I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="4.59">link it below for you as I do everything</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="4.2">but I wanted to say I wanted to read</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="3.3">this there&amp;#39;s been a lot of reporting</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="2.91">that Muller&amp;#39;s interested in some of the</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="3.78">meetings you had in the lead-up to the</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="4.5">campaign and after the election which</text>
  <text start="74.61" dur="3.42">would be the seychelles and I was just</text>
  <text start="76.65" dur="3.17">wondering if you could tell me if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="5.129">heard from anyone on Weller&amp;#39;s team an</text>
  <text start="79.82" dur="5.68">Eric Prince says this I certainly</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.231">understand the intense interest in the</text>
  <text start="85.5" dur="4.14">investigation and certainly some of the</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="4.95">wild-eyed reporting in the media</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.71">I&amp;#39;ve spoken voluntarily to Congress and</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="4.709">I also cooperated with the special</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="4.979">counsel I have plenty of opinions on the</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="3.871">various investigations but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="3.601">question some people are taking it</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="4.17">seriously and I think it&amp;#39;s best to keep</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="4.41">my opinion on that to myself for now all</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="4.559">I will add is that much of the reporting</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="4.08">about me in the media is inaccurate and</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="3.211">I am confident that when the</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="3.21">investigators have finished their work</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="5.03">we will be able to put these</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="6.15">distractions to the side very</text>
  <text start="117.89" dur="4.93">interesting and the character Jorge</text>
  <text start="120.78" dur="5.22">nadir makes an appearance and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="5.88">where I&amp;#39;m digging now into Jorge nadir</text>
  <text start="126" dur="5.879">what I found interesting was that the</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="4.32">house did not know that Prince met with</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="3.361">nadir and did</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="4.29">ask him now that means either they</text>
  <text start="135.24" dur="4.53">didn&amp;#39;t know like I said or they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.31" dur="4.83">want anyone else to know so I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="5.04">to nail that down right now but you know</text>
  <text start="142.14" dur="4.92">Eric Prince is an important guy Eric</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.08">Prince was the showcase point of my</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="3.99">piece on Loretta Lynch threatening the</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="5.67">NYPD in the New York FBI field office</text>
  <text start="151.05" dur="5.94">with retaliation on garner about the</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="4.32">garner case he&amp;#39;s a very central figure</text>
  <text start="156.99" dur="4.95">to this whole thing very important and</text>
  <text start="158.88" dur="5.61">so I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m always intrigued by</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="5.19">the fact again that he ties back in a</text>
  <text start="164.49" dur="6.39">very big way to Dana Rohrabacher who</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="9.45">also took a trip to the embassy to meet</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="13.2">Julian Assange now I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of</text>
  <text start="176.58" dur="12.15">reporting about about Deripaska Warner</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="7.53">Waldman steel and Levinson this video</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="5.46">right here is a precursor tells you a</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="5.58">lot of what you need to know about Mark</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="5.9">Warner and Adam Waldman the lobbyist who</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="10.519">was the go-between from Mark Warner and</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="14.02">and Weinstein uh Weinstein my gosh</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="8.321">feinstein feinstein staffer jones and he</text>
  <text start="214.11" dur="3.65">was basically this is i&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="6.78">kind of spell it out for you guys here</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="8.29">warner was talking to Waldman Waldman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="6.12">texts were made available to fox news</text>
  <text start="226.05" dur="5.34">back in I believe it was March let me</text>
  <text start="228.93" dur="8">just triple check it was February in</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="8.46">February of 2018 Fox News released these</text>
  <text start="236.93" dur="6.43">signal messages between Waldman and</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="6.359">Warner and in these messages he talks</text>
  <text start="243.36" dur="5.31">about you know Deripaska he talks about</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="4.921">steel he talks about meeting with them</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="5.01">organizing meetings with them organizing</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="5.16">meetings with you know Assange to try</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="5.55">and work with Assange and at the same</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="4.77">time that this is happening you know we</text>
  <text start="259.23" dur="5.31">get the John Solomon story from the hill</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="4.65">where John Solomon says that James Comey</text>
  <text start="264.54" dur="3.48">stepped into</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="6.51">this deal that Waldman was trying to</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="6.38">broker for a sonj to come to the United</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="5.58">States to talk to the United States</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="5.37">about the vault seven releases that he</text>
  <text start="277.8" dur="6.119">was going to be doing CIA releases</text>
  <text start="279.77" dur="6.57">throughout the entire thing and and and</text>
  <text start="283.919" dur="5.131">in regards to Solomon&amp;#39;s reporting</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="5.62">Assange maintains that Russia did not</text>
  <text start="289.05" dur="7.799">provide this information to him and you</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="7.35">know DMC Podesta etc and they now we</text>
  <text start="296.849" dur="3.871">learn that Comey said uh uh you know</text>
  <text start="299.31" dur="3.81">forget this whole thing with Assange</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="5.009">well that&amp;#39;s interesting because if it</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="6.72">comes out that Assange you know that if</text>
  <text start="305.729" dur="6.481">it comes out that the DN C Podesta stuff</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="5.299">didn&amp;#39;t come from Russia their entire</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="5.22">narrative goes to crap so now we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="315.139" dur="4.241">Waldman in the midst of this trying to</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="4.31">broker some deal Waldman connected to</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="5.069">Deripaska Waldman connected to steel</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="5.679">Deripaska the Russian oligarch who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.449" dur="8.371">been heavily sanctioned who John Solomon</text>
  <text start="327.419" dur="7.381">also reports is contacted by the FBI in</text>
  <text start="332.82" dur="6.089">regards to Paul Manafort during the</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="6.57">campaign remember so we have Waldman</text>
  <text start="338.909" dur="5.1">trying to basically I guess what I can</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="5.849">gather and my assumption and speculation</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="6.061">is it seems as though Waldman was trying</text>
  <text start="347.219" dur="6">to get Julian or work with Congress to</text>
  <text start="350.07" dur="5.879">get Julian to shut up about the Russia</text>
  <text start="353.219" dur="6.031">didn&amp;#39;t do this connection and just get</text>
  <text start="355.949" dur="4.981">him to talk about vault seven and it</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="4.4">doesn&amp;#39;t appear that Julian was very</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="5.85">interested in that because he was</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="6.43">continuing to release vault seven in the</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="5.97">midst of all this negotiation now what</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="5.97">hasn&amp;#39;t been spoken about in the</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="5.159">mainstream lately or by Solomon is that</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="7.619">at the same exact time as this is</text>
  <text start="377.909" dur="8.431">happening right here the fake Hannity</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="6.211">account pops up on Twitter and I covered</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="5.19">it in this video there&amp;#39;s a fake Hannity</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="5.67">a Kahana tease account goes down a fake</text>
  <text start="391.53" dur="5.639">Hannity account goes up in its place the</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="3.6">woman running that account reaches out</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="6.211">to Julian Assange who starts talk</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="10.23">to handy as though it&amp;#39;s really handy he</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="10.23">says he has information on Warner in the</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="6.06">midst of all this now again Marco Rubio</text>
  <text start="413.61" dur="3.66">comes out and says we knew about all</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="4.68">these text messages he told us about</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="5.55">these you know out of context it looks</text>
  <text start="420.12" dur="4.38">bad but in context we understand well</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="3.36">now i can assume that&amp;#39;s because they</text>
  <text start="424.5" dur="3.33">knew some of them knew anyway they were</text>
  <text start="426.18" dur="3.6">trying to work something out with julian</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="5.31">assange to get him to stop dropping all</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="4.26">of the very very damaging CIA vault</text>
  <text start="433.14" dur="4.38">seven leaks</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s interesting to me is that of</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="3.63">course Julian Assange is negotiating</text>
  <text start="439.74" dur="4.56">negotiating with all ends of the</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="7.38">spectrum here okay he&amp;#39;s negotiating also</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="7.41">with I suppose friendlies</text>
  <text start="448.53" dur="7.29">Dana Rohrabacher travels over to you</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="7.67">know to the embassy I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="455.82" dur="7.32">the date of that hold on so after the</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="6.07">negotiations break down with Waldman</text>
  <text start="463.14" dur="4.44">Warner because these texts here are on</text>

  <text start="493.89" dur="4.71">wasn&amp;#39;t the Russians that gave him that</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="4.8">information that I&amp;#39;m trying to get this</text>
