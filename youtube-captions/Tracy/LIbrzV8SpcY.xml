  <text start="103.979" dur="3.871">different perspectives</text>
  <text start="105.39" dur="5.369">lots of disinformation lots of theories</text>
  <text start="107.85" dur="8.19">lots of actual facts lots of people</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="10.921">waking up to the sort of I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="7.5">how you&amp;#39;d call it improbability Saturday</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="4.619">that this story and actually what</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="4.609">they&amp;#39;re telling us it is right and so I</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="5.101">kind of sat back and was watching</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="4.871">carefully for a while and not really</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="2.43">saying too too much except to kind of</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="2.91">say listen this does</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="3.99">mean that things aren&amp;#39;t gonna be you</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="3.84">know prosecuted this doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="5.4">mean that everything&amp;#39;s gonna end and we</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="6.15">got some confirmation of that but where</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="7.32">people would typically go to figure</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="7.98">something like this out is the Fourth</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="4.92">Estate the media right that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="153.9" dur="3.99">people would typically go to find out</text>
  <text start="155.46" dur="4.47">what&amp;#39;s happening when you know a tragedy</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="3.33">strikes you look to the reporters that</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="3.51">are on the ground doing the work to</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="3.9">figure out what the story is and a lot</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="3.42">of people aren&amp;#39;t talking about this</text>
  <text start="165.12" dur="3.3">specific thing and I wanted to kind of</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="7.41">put it out there for everybody and get</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="8.789">your thoughts and opinions right why we</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="5.4">know just from sheer observation that</text>
  <text start="177.209" dur="4.591">the media is incompetent my opinion</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="4.26">about this is and this is my opinion is</text>
  <text start="181.8" dur="5.19">that they have been spoon-fed their</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="4.35">stories for so long that they&amp;#39;re used to</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="3.15">just getting a call from some</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="3.78">intelligence agency or source or</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="4.11">whatever and the source saying to them</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="3.78">like ok you know this is going down</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="2.94">here&amp;#39;s the talking points this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="3.6">gonna happen in them writing the story</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="4.019">that they&amp;#39;re not used to doing any</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="2.94">investigative journalism anymore let</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="2.581">alone trying to figure out what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.38" dur="3.359">happening now there are a few outlets</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="5.25">that are doing the work to figure this</text>
  <text start="205.739" dur="6.901">out but in a sea of information you know</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="7.71">50% rumor 50 percent corroborated in in</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="5.97">some way with legacy media hosts on</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="4.17">television talking about how they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="3.72">believe that he was actually you know</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="2.88">that he committed suicide or there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="222.33" dur="3.45">chance that he didn&amp;#39;t or maybe he paid</text>
  <text start="223.8" dur="3.3">the guards off or maybe you know all the</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="2.85">theories that are going around on both</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="2.7">sides of the aisle no matter your</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="3.42">political stripes it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="229.8" dur="4.98">matter there&amp;#39;s all this innuendo and</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="4.38">gossip and nobody nobody on either side</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="7.459">of the aisle believes the official story</text>
  <text start="236.43" dur="8.46">nobody does nobody believes it so again</text>
  <text start="242.239" dur="5.651">the official story is that Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="6.36">Epstein hung himself in his cell was</text>
  <text start="247.89" dur="4.62">found unresponsive in his cell was taken</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="3.209">to the hospital and pronounced dead</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s the official story I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="3.15">think that the Attorney General of the</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="3.239">United States based on his comments</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="3.511">today believes that that&amp;#39;s actually what</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="3.961">happened if you know how it happens were</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="4.799">the circumstances that had to fall in</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="3.63">place for it to happen in you know the</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="2.971">the</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="5.82">cameras guards on overtime all of the</text>
  <text start="268.89" dur="5.73">stuff craziness so rather than focus on</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="3.78">any one theory although I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="274.62" dur="3.36">debunk a couple different things that</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve come across because that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="277.98" dur="5.37">way to get the real story is to start</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="5.61">debunking things that we know not to be</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="5.16">true rather than do that off the bat</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="3.48">what I wanted to do instead was go</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="2.99">through some of the more interesting</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="4.32">things that I&amp;#39;ve come across in my</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="3.82">travels and talk about them with you and</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="3.99">what&amp;#39;s wrong with them</text>
  <text start="295.32" dur="4.05">okay so we have Jeffery and we have this</text>
  <text start="298.17" dur="3.3">article from the New York Post who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="4.62">been right on top of this story from the</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="5.01">beginning they&amp;#39;re freelance journalists</text>
  <text start="303.99" dur="4.77">was the one who released the the photos</text>
  <text start="306.48" dur="3.78">that are allegedly of Epstein in a</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="3.93">stretcher outside of the hospital</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="5.37">those photos have been the symptom or</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="5.58">the you know the the basis of so many</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="4.74">questions people speculating it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="4.83">him on the stretcher people speculating</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="4.62">why are they giving him CPR still if he</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="3.6">was unresponsive in the cell and you</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="3.27">know the original reporting said that he</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="3.78">was found dead I mean all legitimate</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="4.71">questions like people just don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="330.48" dur="5.31">the media anymore they do not trust even</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="5.25">their own eyes when someone says here is</text>
  <text start="335.79" dur="4.08">a picture of Jeffrey Epstein people are</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="3.48">like they lie about everything else so</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="3.39">why wouldn&amp;#39;t they lie about this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="3.54">a hundred percent onboard with you guys</text>
  <text start="343.26" dur="4.44">about it trust me I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="5.58">anything I see in half of what I hear</text>
  <text start="347.7" dur="4.92">maybe less than half so when I&amp;#39;m sitting</text>
  <text start="350.82" dur="3.75">back trying to work through a story like</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="3.99">this I start to take these things in and</text>
  <text start="354.57" dur="3.6">just process them so this one in</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="2.76">particular from the post again who&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="367.2" dur="5.52">I&amp;#39;ve seriously never done this before</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;ve never done a stream across all</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="3.33">platforms like this so you&amp;#39;re just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="4.95">a little bit intimidating I gotta be</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="5.72">honest so just bear with me the jail</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="4.8">where Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="5.2">apparently hanged himself even the post</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="4.59">apparently hanged himself was a nest of</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="4.29">corruption in the early 90s according to</text>
  <text start="388.98" dur="4.32">one late mobster one of late mobster</text>
  <text start="391.26" dur="3.36">John Gotti&amp;#39;s top associates who insists</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="2.61">it&amp;#39;s still a place where almost anything</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="4.81">can be bought if you have the bucks and</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="5.35">the articles basically talking about his</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="3.75">spective on what the prison was like</text>
  <text start="401.26" dur="6.06">back when Gaudi was in there and what he</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="6.12">dealt with his name is Luis Casman who</text>
  <text start="407.32" dur="3.84">was a one-time close confidant of the</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="5.37">dapper Don who visited him several times</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="5.61">at MCC in 1992 even then he says there</text>
  <text start="414.67" dur="4.32">are cameras going 24/7 they&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="3.69">24/7 someone had to give up steam the</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="3.15">equipment to kill himself and he had to</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="4.35">pay for it dearly</text>
  <text start="422.14" dur="4.8">he said he&amp;#39;s kept abreast of the the</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="3.66">conditions there on the lock-up right he</text>
  <text start="426.94" dur="3.03">says that facility has had issues of</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="3.18">corruption with corrections officers</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="4.71">bringing in food or cell phones for</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="5.28">wealthy people another outlet did a</text>
  <text start="434.68" dur="5.19">workup basically of all of the kind of</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="5.61">things that have come out about MCC one</text>
  <text start="439.87" dur="4.53">of the people who was accused of being a</text>
  <text start="442.54" dur="3.3">CI whistleblower I did a story on</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="4.68">several months ago I can&amp;#39;t remember his</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="5.82">name had contraband cellphones in there</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="4.14">one of them very heavily encrypted there</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="5.82">was all kinds of stories of malfeasance</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="6.3">at this prison fine what&amp;#39;s in here</text>
  <text start="457.48" dur="6.72">though that really just amazed me is</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="7.5">that they say Casman said he heard US</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="5.58">Attorney General William bar personally</text>
  <text start="467.02" dur="5.19">made a hush hush trip to the MCC two</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="3.81">weeks ago about the time Epstein was</text>
  <text start="472.21" dur="4.65">found in his cell with bruises around</text>
  <text start="473.59" dur="8.11">his neck now</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="7.36">had a cough now they talk about I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="4.95">gonna remember this point that William</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="6.09">bar went there two weeks ago as per</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="5.73">Casman right we read down we see they</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="3.99">say Casman said the facility was totally</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="4.08">disgusting worse than Guantanamo Bay</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="3.87">Howcast Minh knows what Guantanamo Bay</text>
  <text start="496.46" dur="4.29">is like I guess is a topic for another</text>
  <text start="498.17" dur="4.23">conversation but as somebody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.75" dur="3.6">looking for facts I&amp;#39;m reading this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="5.19">obviously a statement from somebody it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.35" dur="5.31">hearsay but he says there were roaches</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="3.66">crawling all over you in every orifice</text>
  <text start="509.66" dur="3.509">when you sleep the Bureau of Prisons</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="5.849">answer is that they can&amp;#39;t spray and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.169" dur="5.881">toxic then they say reps for the jail</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="3.541">did not and did not immediately respond</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="6.03">to requests for comment but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.64" dur="8.1">say what they asked for comment on they</text>
  <text start="525.08" dur="6.84">also in here at no point in time ever</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="6.42">say they reached out to the DOJ or to</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="9.03">attorney general bar to see if he did go</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="9.81">to the MCC two weeks ago so in my head</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="5.52">I&amp;#39;m like the New York Post which to be</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="4.35">honest has done some good reporting on</text>
  <text start="546.47" dur="5.76">stuff paper in New York people buy it</text>
  <text start="549.32" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s physical does this report and</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="7.56">doesn&amp;#39;t even reach out to the DOJ to</text>
  <text start="556.82" dur="4.92">corroborate this guy&amp;#39;s story so if the</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="4.14">DOJ has is forced to make a statement</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="3.99">and confirm or deny it that&amp;#39;s one thing</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="3.72">they could deny it and have it be true</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="3.27">they could confirm yeah he was there and</text>
  <text start="567.65" dur="3.81">that would give us a whole nother angle</text>
  <text start="569" dur="4.41">to look at but it doesn&amp;#39;t appear that</text>
  <text start="571.46" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve done that it does not appear</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="4.08">that these people have done any work</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="6.87">whatsoever to corroborate what the</text>
  <text start="577.49" dur="7.59">former Gambino mobster says and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="582.59" dur="4.59">mind those noises it&amp;#39;s my notifications</text>
  <text start="585.08" dur="4.949">on the computer</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="6.27">so we have an article that says that but</text>

  <text start="723.98" dur="5.91">that I said is let me try and find my</text>
  <text start="727.07" dur="4.8">thread from last night the first thing</text>
  <text start="729.89" dur="6.569">that I said when when when I saw that</text>
  <text start="731.87" dur="7.14">was that Jeffrey Epstein when he was</text>

  <text start="741.14" dur="9.18">orange see here and so I&amp;#39;m like I wonder</text>
  <text start="746.06" dur="7.26">if Fox or the post did any fact-checking</text>
  <text start="750.32" dur="5.31">on what this guy says in terms of</text>
  <text start="753.32" dur="5.34">uniform color because that&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="755.63" dur="5.25">to know I mean to me it is what is what</text>
  <text start="758.66" dur="3.96">is going on here if Jeffrey Epstein was</text>
  <text start="760.88" dur="4.05">in this prison and he&amp;#39;s wearing orange</text>
  <text start="762.62" dur="6.149">in his pictures that they got of him</text>
  <text start="764.93" dur="6.719">outside of the hospital if the if the</text>
  <text start="768.769" dur="5.401">jail or the prison doesn&amp;#39;t issue orange</text>
  <text start="771.649" dur="3.87">uniforms well Houston there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="774.17" dur="4.2">off here that needs to be looked into</text>
  <text start="775.519" dur="4.081">and as a report as a reporter that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="778.37" dur="5.06">first thing I would have done before I</text>
  <text start="779.6" dur="7.739">published this is take a look to see if</text>
  <text start="783.43" dur="6.219">they&amp;#39;re supposed to if they issue orange</text>
  <text start="787.339" dur="4.531">uniforms it may seem like a stupid</text>
  <text start="789.649" dur="5.281">detail but it&amp;#39;s really not it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="791.87" dur="5.85">important detail so I started poking</text>
  <text start="794.93" dur="5.04">around and I found the Bureau of Prisons</text>
  <text start="797.72" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s a federal prison so I found the</text>
  <text start="799.97" dur="5.67">Bureau of Prisons website and here you</text>
  <text start="802.85" dur="4.53">can see it&amp;#39;s not gonna get bigger of</text>
  <text start="805.64" dur="3.389">course here you can see this is a</text>
  <text start="807.38" dur="3.149">picture of what you can expect when</text>
  <text start="809.029" dur="3.991">you&amp;#39;re entering prison they show you the</text>
  <text start="810.529" dur="3.93">green that they show you white they talk</text>
  <text start="813.02" dur="2.43">about the uniform but that wasn&amp;#39;t good</text>
  <text start="814.459" dur="2.25">enough for me there could have been a</text>
  <text start="815.45" dur="2.579">stock photo it doesn&amp;#39;t really mean</text>
  <text start="816.709" dur="3.451">anything and then I&amp;#39;m like thinking to</text>
  <text start="818.029" dur="3.361">myself what happens if they go to the</text>
  <text start="820.16" dur="2.429">commissary and they want to buy</text>
  <text start="821.39" dur="3.15">themselves something this is all open</text>
  <text start="822.589" dur="3.601">source research this is all available on</text>
  <text start="824.54" dur="5.28">the internet for anybody that wants to</text>
  <text start="826.19" dur="7.11">look and I looked at the commissary list</text>
  <text start="829.82" dur="9.06">from that jail to see what was available</text>
  <text start="833.3" dur="8.039">to buy gray and white and that&amp;#39;s it no</text>
  <text start="838.88" dur="5.61">orange okay then I had a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="841.339" dur="4.44">saying well maybe they put the suicide</text>
  <text start="844.49" dur="3.42">watch people in Orange</text>
  <text start="845.779" dur="4.351">ok so let&amp;#39;s pretend that they put the</text>
  <text start="847.91" dur="4.47">suicide people in orange if they put the</text>
  <text start="850.13" dur="3.06">suicide people in orange the people on</text>
  <text start="852.38" dur="2.97">suicide watch</text>
  <text start="853.19" dur="4.55">the inmates on suicide watch I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="855.35" dur="6.54">professional they put them in orange</text>
  <text start="857.74" dur="5.8">then Jeffrey Epstein was still on</text>
  <text start="861.89" dur="4.68">suicide watch because he was wheeled out</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="7.86">in orange uniform I&amp;#39;ve never I could be</text>
  <text start="866.57" dur="7.83">wrong here but I&amp;#39;ve never seen EMS or</text>
  <text start="871.4" dur="4.68">police or whatever dressed somebody in</text>
  <text start="874.4" dur="4.82">different clothing especially when</text>
  <text start="876.08" dur="5.94">coming from a crime scene you guys</text>
  <text start="879.22" dur="4.45">anyone else have any perspective on that</text>
  <text start="882.02" dur="3.09">feel free to chime in in the chat I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="883.67" dur="5.43">looking at the periscope chat right now</text>

  <text start="889.1" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re questioning I&amp;#39;ve never seen them</text>

  <text start="892.88" dur="4.44">completely outside of the scope of</text>
  <text start="895.16" dur="4.44">what&amp;#39;s normal and again it seems like a</text>
  <text start="897.32" dur="5.46">little detail but this is something that</text>
  <text start="899.6" dur="5.55">you would think that these reporters</text>
  <text start="902.78" dur="4.11">would pick up on right</text>
  <text start="905.15" dur="7.17">I went even further I looked at a</text>
  <text start="906.89" dur="7.08">directive from from the bureau inside</text>

  <text start="1235.16" dur="4.02">and nothing is false like everything</text>
  <text start="1236.87" dur="4.71">seems to be compelling and so what I do</text>
  <text start="1239.18" dur="4.71">is I take in all this information and</text>
  <text start="1241.58" dur="6.12">then I do my best to sort through it and</text>
  <text start="1243.89" dur="5.46">prove or disprove what I get the there</text>
  <text start="1247.7" dur="4.53">was a video that went out by someone who</text>
  <text start="1249.35" dur="4.16">did side-by-side comparison who&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="1252.23" dur="3.47">questioning</text>
  <text start="1253.51" dur="4.05">entire scenario with the rest of the</text>
  <text start="1255.7" dur="4.32">world and putting their perspective out</text>
  <text start="1257.56" dur="5.07">there that said that this was Anthony</text>
  <text start="1260.02" dur="4.11">Bourdain on the stretcher Anthony</text>

  <text start="1266.32" dur="7.5">and months ago there was a whole big</text>
  <text start="1267.52" dur="8.22">thing about his death write it that&amp;#39;s I</text>

  <text start="1281.62" dur="3.57">and the only reason why it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1283.15" dur="4.08">possible is because Anthony Bourdain was</text>
  <text start="1285.19" dur="3.84">in France when he was killed so if he&amp;#39;s</text>
