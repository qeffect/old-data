  <text start="0" dur="6.839">all the way back in difficulties as well</text>
  <text start="3.48" dur="6.96">at James Madison kind of a semi-famous</text>
  <text start="6.839" dur="4.92">guide 1792 wrote a short paragraph you</text>
  <text start="10.44" dur="4.82">ever get time to be able to read this</text>
  <text start="11.759" dur="6.69">just Google in James Madison property</text>
  <text start="15.26" dur="5.59">1792 and it&amp;#39;s a short piece that he</text>
  <text start="18.449" dur="3.631">wrote on private property that term that</text>
  <text start="20.85" dur="4.74">we hear all the time that your home is</text>
  <text start="22.08" dur="5.13">your castle he references that in 1792</text>
  <text start="25.59" dur="4.56">but he also says nothing is your home</text>
  <text start="27.21" dur="5.759">near Castle let your religion your faith</text>
  <text start="30.15" dur="4.77">is your most intimate Castle it is your</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="4.291">most intimate piece of property and</text>
  <text start="34.92" dur="4.53">government does not have the right to</text>
  <text start="37.26" dur="3.78">come in major castle nor do they have</text>
  <text start="39.45" dur="4.289">the right to come invade your most</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="4.38">private castle your religious faith as</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="7.16">well so it&amp;#39;s a big deal that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="45.42" dur="8.76">looked at for a very long time so</text>
  <text start="50.899" dur="9.671">absolute crap panel and I like that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="7.92">to get back in even simpler terms they</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="3.96">think about it when we read the</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="3.839">Declaration infinity and the idea that</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="3.18">all men are created equal this is</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="4.261">grounded nature which is the source of</text>
  <text start="67.71" dur="5.58">our rights we talk about liberty and</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="5.16">rights a lot so does the left the fun of</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="6.509">the question is what&amp;#39;s the source of the</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="6.18">right what&amp;#39;s behind that and the beauty</text>
  <text start="79.799" dur="4.5">of the Declaration if you can understand</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="5.73">it as a philosophical question but also</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="4.211">as a theological question and either way</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="3.43">you read it</text>
  <text start="88.51" dur="3.69">can&amp;#39;t understand Liberty as they</text>
  <text start="90.7" dur="3.42">understood it and I think is as we as</text>
  <text start="92.2" dur="5.43">conservators understanding without an</text>
  <text start="94.12" dur="6.48">idea that there is transcendence because</text>
  <text start="97.63" dur="4.56">anytime you deny that what you say that</text>
  <text start="100.6" dur="4.83">you recognize the possible that a man</text>
  <text start="102.19" dur="7.44">could whether you George the third year</text>
  <text start="105.43" dur="7.74">divine monarch or your motto in China it</text>
  <text start="109.63" dur="5.52">leads to what cheering unless delivery</text>
  <text start="113.17" dur="4.44">politics and allows all this be possible</text>
  <text start="115.15" dur="5.7">and if you lose that understanding that</text>
  <text start="117.61" dur="4.5">foundation of what Liberty means you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.85" dur="4.89">going to start going down that road</text>
  <text start="122.11" dur="5.91">towards a reshaping of man like the</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="4.8">Communists or the Socialists what to do</text>
  <text start="128.02" dur="6.66">all right a just have a that can it</text>

  <text start="136.6" dur="5.18">it&amp;#39;s not there and it&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="138.88" dur="4.53">genius behind CS Lewis&amp;#39;s moral lawgiver</text>
  <text start="141.78" dur="3.07">argument that we read in their</text>

  <text start="144.85" dur="4.59">iterated in different ways it&amp;#39;s the idea</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="4.67">that everyone believes everyone on earth</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s this thing that has stumped secular</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="3.82">sociologists for a long time that people</text>
  <text start="154.03" dur="3.87">have different cultures and in different</text>
  <text start="155.92" dur="4.38">parts of the world all sharing this idea</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="4.83">of a higher moral law that there is this</text>
  <text start="160.3" dur="4.35">some idea of a human right and some</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="3.87">things are wrong some things are in</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="2.46">violation of a human right even if we</text>

  <text start="170.77" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re just bored with and yet even the</text>

  <text start="176.68" dur="3.63">proponents of Liberty</text>

  <text start="182.14" dur="4.62">said that is giving us those things I</text>
  <text start="184.57" dur="3.81">found it to be very important with my</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="4.98">generation who insists that everything</text>
  <text start="188.38" dur="5.94">is a right even privileges or rights and</text>
  <text start="191.74" dur="4.14">many times Moneo is also where religious</text>

  <text start="195.88" dur="4.59">religious nods we are secular lists just</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="4.56">start with the rights argument to say</text>
  <text start="200.47" dur="4.2">okay do you believe that some things are</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="3.63">right and wrong do you believe that you</text>
  <text start="204.67" dur="2.97">have rights that you were born with that</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="3.87">president Tom shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to take</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="5.25">away that distres houndini acts for most</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="5.64">Millennials and then back up from there</text>
  <text start="212.89" dur="5.22">and say why where does it come from</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="4.2">and typically it&amp;#39;s people to think why</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="3.27">do you believe in human rights why do</text>
  <text start="219.85" dur="3.78">you believe that there are some things</text>
  <text start="221.38" dur="4.02">that are just wrong some things that if</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="3.96">it were just are just right</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="4.14">if you truly just believe in survival of</text>

  <text start="229.54" dur="3.479">the natural selection you have no right</text>
  <text start="231.55" dur="3.81">to say that someone&amp;#39;s healing from you</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="4.251">is wrong or everything is a right</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="4.25">everything is a race even the</text>
  <text start="237.27" dur="4.65">without thinking what are rates where</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="4.41">did our rates come from is their</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="3.63">existence an absolute truth and these</text>
  <text start="244.02" dur="3.96">are with the fundamental questions that</text>
  <text start="245.55" dur="5.22">at one point a lot of people agreed on</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="4.89">but unfortunately with post-modernism</text>
  <text start="250.77" dur="4.56">that is really heard a beam of academia</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="3.84">and different parts of our culture we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="4.29">started to question the existence of</text>
  <text start="256.71" dur="5.37">truth and so what I&amp;#39;ve seen is you said</text>
  <text start="259.62" dur="5.22">though that that only works for so long</text>
  <text start="262.08" dur="5.55">people do desire me they do desire truth</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="4.95">and morality and you see I think a shift</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="3.39">back in towards the rib direction how</text>
  <text start="269.79" dur="2.69">people seeking truth</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="3.99">well I one of the snakes that</text>
  <text start="272.48" dur="5.02">conservatives have often made which is a</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="5.4">move that the left wanting to make is we</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="5.7">start with rights and we always go there</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="4.64">first in our conversations what we</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="4.35">should do is in which you said said is</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="5.83">really the first question is what does</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="5.19">it mean to be human that&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="4.62">question what does it mean to be a</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="5.07">flourishing human being what is required</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="3.93">for that liberty is required they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="3.75">going to do what it asked a whole</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="3.48">different series of questions the</text>
  <text start="301.56" dur="3.12">declaration tells us we have the rights</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="5.67">to life liberty and the pursuit of</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="6.63">happiness what does that mean to pursue</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="6.27">we are naturally drawn towards going</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="6.06">towards something happiness personally</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="5.37">got a great classical objective of human</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="5.58">life and they have all understood that</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="5.1">that means a complete happiness which</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="3.81">leaves open the possibility and actually</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="3.15">points us toward the possibility of</text>
  <text start="326.76" dur="4.68">coming to understand that happiness as a</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="4.98">fulfillment in you know a beatific</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="4.11">vision and understanding guy coming to</text>
  <text start="333.45" dur="5.01">know those truths your officer right if</text>
  <text start="335.55" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s no truth but he</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="3.66">whether it&amp;#39;s the laws of nature or</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="3.81">nature&amp;#39;s God</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s no grounding fourth it&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re subject to the arbitrary dictates</text>
  <text start="346.32" dur="5.58">of its supreme that the rights that</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="5.79">government is meant to secure do not</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="5.91">come from government and you need an</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="6.75">outside source and there are plenty of</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="7.32">artists from a long tradition of Western</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="5.85">civilization that great explained by</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="5.07">these great thinkers and great books and</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="6.75">there&amp;#39;s also a very long theological</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="5.82">tradition and at certain points in time</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.02">in history they come together in a</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="5.82">beautiful way and one of those I think</text>
  <text start="378.42" dur="5.49">is the most providential moment of the</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="3.54">American Founding in which those two</text>
  <text start="383.91" dur="4.35">things come together to battle together</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="5.87">to create this Liberty but a Liberty</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="6.69">that allows for economic flourishing</text>
  <text start="391.25" dur="6.73">personal flourishing individual liberty</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="7.05">but also a protection and a</text>
  <text start="397.98" dur="8.18">and a encouragement of this this divine</text>
  <text start="402" dur="8.64">saying in man which is to to seek and</text>
  <text start="406.16" dur="5.89">pursue these higher truths so we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.64" dur="2.52">always gotten across the culture and</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="2.37">we&amp;#39;re struggling as a culture and</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="3.6">getting currently with the issue of</text>
  <text start="414.42" dur="3.99">religious liberty there are a whole</text>
  <text start="416.76" dur="3.84">group of people that say you can have a</text>
  <text start="418.41" dur="4.11">faith just leave it over there just</text>
  <text start="420.6" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t bring it out at your house or</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ll have a fait designation on our</text>
  <text start="424.26" dur="4.41">denominational designation it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="2.85">like a membership in a club to them</text>
  <text start="428.67" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re good don&amp;#39;t participate they</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="3.33">really don&amp;#39;t go they really don&amp;#39;t engage</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="3.78">so it&amp;#39;s not meaningful in their life</text>
  <text start="433.26" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s just I have this particular label</text>
  <text start="435.48" dur="2.67">whether it be Republican Democrat</text>
  <text start="436.92" dur="3.51">independent conservative liberal but</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="4.17">they have that label they also have this</text>
  <text start="440.43" dur="3.51">label as well one of the greatest</text>
  <text start="442.32" dur="4.32">challenges we have to religious liberty</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="5.28">in this modern day is people that</text>
  <text start="446.64" dur="4.22">actually claim a faith that don&amp;#39;t live</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="4.47">their faith as long as that may be</text>
  <text start="450.86" dur="4.42">having a culture that is a vibrant</text>
  <text start="453.69" dur="3.66">culture base where people not only have</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="5.07">a thing that they choose the limit</text>
  <text start="457.35" dur="3.36">matters in our culture I tell people all</text>
  <text start="460.35" dur="1.92">the time</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="2.76">everything you do it affects how I treat</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="3.24">my wife it affects how I treat my</text>
  <text start="463.47" dur="3.78">children it affects our relationship for</text>
  <text start="465.51" dur="3.12">the people it affects how I disagree</text>
  <text start="467.25" dur="3.51">with people that are clearly wrong</text>
  <text start="468.63" dur="4.02">because they disagree with me and so we</text>
  <text start="470.76" dur="2.94">doing we we have all this dialogue I</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="2.4">treat them differently</text>
  <text start="473.7" dur="2.73">understand that person&amp;#39;s creating the</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="3.93">image of God they have value and worth</text>
  <text start="476.43" dur="4.98">and so it affects in my life but as</text>
  <text start="478.98" dur="4.11">people can honor religious liberty or</text>
  <text start="481.41" dur="3.75">when a person actually lives their faith</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="3.6">out this is something we have really</text>
  <text start="485.16" dur="3">struggled with in our current modern day</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="3.39">but quite frankly if you go back to the</text>
  <text start="488.16" dur="4.29">founding we struggled with it at the</text>
  <text start="490.08" dur="4.26">very beginning as well as a Baptist</text>
  <text start="492.45" dur="4.32">I was atmosphere kicked out of most of</text>
  <text start="494.34" dur="4.77">the colonies early on because they</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="4.95">weren&amp;#39;t accepted as that almost every</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="5.28">colony early on had a designated</text>
  <text start="501.72" dur="4.56">religion for that colony and if you</text>
  <text start="504.39" dur="3.72">weren&amp;#39;t that religion you&amp;#39;re not welcome</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="3.45">in this colony it was the birth of the</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="3.36">nation in our Constitution</text>
  <text start="509.73" dur="3.36">when our founders finally determined</text>
  <text start="511.47" dur="3.48">timeout we&amp;#39;re not going to be like other</text>
  <text start="513.09" dur="3.63">nations we&amp;#39;re done not going to</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="3.57">designate certain face we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="516.72" dur="3.96">take this ultimate risk and challenge</text>
  <text start="518.52" dur="4.649">people to have a faith live their faith</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="4.41">or it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the same faith</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="4.651">as the ruler what they&amp;#39;ve experienced in</text>
  <text start="525.09" dur="4.62">the past and we&amp;#39;re at our best when we</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="4.08">choose to live our personal faith out</text>
  <text start="529.71" dur="8.22">and to live it publicly privately but</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="9">sincerely yes and I would say that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="5.13">okay to be a Christian we&amp;#39;re told unless</text>
  <text start="540.9" dur="7.26">you actually believe what the Bible says</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="9.24">unless you do it live it you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="5.49">allowed to do the parts about about sort</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="3.72">of being the poor you&amp;#39;re allowed to do</text>
  <text start="553.65" dur="3.87">the parts that are culturally acceptable</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="3.42">but as soon as you believe something</text>
  <text start="557.52" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s counter to the culture then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.44" dur="2.76">not okay that you&amp;#39;re a Christian and in</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="3.96">fact you&amp;#39;re not really a Christian you</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="4.02">actually just a bigot now tell you that</text>
  <text start="564.81" dur="3.12">you should stay quiet because your</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="3.63">religion and your faith is dying out</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="3.99">anyway it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="2.83">so when you say religious cannot say</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="7.57">that</text>
  <text start="572.68" dur="10.62">nuns Oh idiot</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="6.779">sorry for the confusion great point in</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="7.289">dealing I worry about this especially</text>
  <text start="586.269" dur="6.36">true with with young people is that they</text>
  <text start="590.589" dur="4.62">see the world as being unfriendly to</text>
  <text start="592.629" dur="5.4">their faith and they want to pull out of</text>
  <text start="595.209" dur="4.35">that and and you know into their own</text>
  <text start="598.029" dur="4.081">communities there&amp;#39;s a large movement</text>
  <text start="599.559" dur="5.851">within conservatives to do this and I</text>
  <text start="602.11" dur="5.639">think that&amp;#39;s problematic as well because</text>
  <text start="605.41" dur="3.989">as I&amp;#39;d like to tell my friends you make</text>
  <text start="607.749" dur="4.32">I got me interested in the government</text>
  <text start="609.399" dur="4.651">but government is always interesting you</text>
  <text start="612.069" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="614.05" dur="4.68">so I think we need to initially to not</text>
  <text start="616.809" dur="3.601">only encourage people to express their</text>
  <text start="618.73" dur="4.94">faith and become stronger in their faith</text>
  <text start="620.41" dur="6">but that they have to be focused outward</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="4.63">especially now more than era we do not</text>
  <text start="626.41" dur="4.169">have a limited government and with a</text>
  <text start="628.3" dur="4.74">very large bureaucratic administrative</text>
  <text start="630.579" dur="4.531">state that regulates everything in our</text>
  <text start="633.04" dur="4.049">lives you have more and more</text>
  <text start="635.11" dur="6.469">opportunities for all the things we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="637.089" dur="6.451">talked about here the the bureaucratic</text>
  <text start="641.579" dur="4.3">authority within the modern</text>
  <text start="643.54" dur="3.75">administrative state which delegate</text>
  <text start="645.879" dur="3.481">which Congress has given way to the</text>
  <text start="647.29" dur="4.32">executive which the current executives</text>
  <text start="649.36" dur="5.25">trying to pull back but it&amp;#39;s all still</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="4.62">there endorsed by the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="654.61" dur="3.06">it looks like the Supreme Court looks</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="3.99">like it&amp;#39;s going to pull back once in</text>
  <text start="657.67" dur="6.24">these things after a long period of</text>
  <text start="660.22" dur="4.409">being very possible but that&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="3.269">to be enough</text>
  <text start="664.629" dur="3.111">we can&amp;#39;t disengage we can&amp;#39;t leave it to</text>
  <text start="667.179" dur="3.75">other people</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="6.099">and the point of view of our of our</text>
  <text start="670.929" dur="5.431">faith we need to be engaged in outwardly</text>
  <text start="673.839" dur="5.761">focused but from the point of view to be</text>
  <text start="676.36" dur="5.909">a good citizen I think we also have to</text>
  <text start="679.6" dur="3.27">be engaged in protecting those liberties</text>
  <text start="682.269" dur="3.451">because</text>
  <text start="682.87" dur="4.469">we actively won&amp;#39;t especially those with</text>
  <text start="685.72" dur="3.57">a very strong thing so you can travel</text>
  <text start="687.339" dur="4.921">anywhere in the world and if you have to</text>
  <text start="689.29" dur="5.85">show your open thriving democracy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="692.26" dur="5.04">economically prosperous almost always</text>
  <text start="695.14" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s also religious liberty there so</text>
  <text start="697.3" dur="3.539">there is there is some dialogue here at</text>
  <text start="699.13" dur="3.03">a conference like this to say well this</text>
  <text start="700.839" dur="3.571">is really a conference about freedom</text>
  <text start="702.16" dur="4.17">about Liberty about economics about all</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="3.69">those things as well but the core base</text>
  <text start="706.33" dur="3.72">that we begin with more than two</text>
  <text start="708.1" dur="4.739">centuries ago is this acknowledgment</text>
  <text start="710.05" dur="5.01">that people are able to truly live free</text>
  <text start="712.839" dur="5.011">that are also able to also practice</text>
  <text start="715.06" dur="4.02">their own faith many many countries</text>
  <text start="717.85" dur="2.76">around the world as you mentioned</text>
  <text start="719.08" dur="3.15">earlier met they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="720.61" dur="4.05">opportunity to do that they have to have</text>
  <text start="722.23" dur="4.049">the faith or non faith of the leader or</text>
  <text start="724.66" dur="3.39">if they&amp;#39;re born a certain faith they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="726.279" dur="4.531">prohibited from ever changing their</text>
  <text start="728.05" dur="4.89">faith that isn&amp;#39;t it norm in most parts</text>
  <text start="730.81" dur="3.84">of the world and this actually is going</text>
  <text start="732.94" dur="3.57">backwards there are many countries now</text>
  <text start="734.65" dur="3.66">that are putting in non conversion laws</text>
