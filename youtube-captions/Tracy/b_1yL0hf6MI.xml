  <text start="42.4" dur="3.51">Jeff Sessions to appoint a second</text>
  <text start="44.08" dur="3.48">special counsel to go over all the</text>
  <text start="45.91" dur="4.47">things that are going on in terms of the</text>
  <text start="47.56" dur="5.34">IG report and bla bla bla bla bla so</text>
  <text start="50.38" dur="6.47">what I wanted to do is go over hey</text>
  <text start="52.9" dur="7.62">everyone hi guys hi from New Jersey hi</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="4.9">Canada awesome I wanted to go over all</text>
  <text start="60.52" dur="4.469">this with you guys plus what just</text>
  <text start="61.75" dur="6.87">happened with Jeff Sessions and of</text>
  <text start="64.989" dur="4.92">course a Muller announcement that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="68.62" dur="3.78">not gonna cover today because I need to</text>
  <text start="69.909" dur="4.941">do some research into it so let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72.4" dur="5.97">started shall we</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="6.879">so a couple weeks ago on what I covered</text>
  <text start="78.37" dur="9.03">yesterday on my channel basically in a</text>
  <text start="81.729" dur="8.611">min in a an interview Jeff Sessions said</text>
  <text start="87.4" dur="4.74">I have appointed a person outside of</text>
  <text start="90.34" dur="3.3">Washington many years in the Department</text>
  <text start="92.14" dur="3.089">of Justice to look at the all the</text>
  <text start="93.64" dur="3.54">allegations that the House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="95.229" dur="6.211">Committee members sent to us and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.18" dur="7.95">conducting that investigation and what</text>
  <text start="101.44" dur="5.9">I&amp;#39;ve been able to gather is that the</text>
  <text start="105.13" dur="5.37">special counsel would be appointed if</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="6.279">Jeff Sessions feels like there would be</text>
  <text start="110.5" dur="5.46">a conflict of interest but I think</text>
  <text start="113.619" dur="3.991">because Jeff Sessions has decided that</text>
  <text start="115.96" dur="3">there is not a conflict of interest</text>
  <text start="117.61" dur="3.41">because the person that he&amp;#39;s chosen to</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="4.05">head this up is outside of Washington</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="3.82">they&amp;#39;ll continue with a special</text>
  <text start="123.01" dur="4.25">prosecutor so let&amp;#39;s just go over it</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="2.42">really quickly</text>
  <text start="128" dur="8.68">Jeff Sessions wrote a letter to Grassley</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="7.35">Gowdy and good luck and it&amp;#39;s in response</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="3.81">to the recent letters requesting the</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="4.05">appointment of a special counsel to</text>
  <text start="140.49" dur="4.41">review certain prosecutorial and</text>
  <text start="143.1" dur="4.74">investigative determinations made by the</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="6.93">Department of Justice in 2016 and 2017 I</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="6.45">take the concerns you raise very</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="4.11">seriously since I took this office it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="2.97">been my goal to establish the highest</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="3.27">standards blah blah blah blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="5.01">blah blah blah he talks and talks about</text>
  <text start="159.21" dur="5.16">that it&amp;#39;s important that the American</text>
  <text start="162.27" dur="6.45">people have confidence in the Department</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="6.06">of Justice and he basically explains he</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="3.03">says however the law requires that much</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="4.23">of the work we&amp;#39;re doing to accomplish</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="5.4">these goals remains confidential to</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="5.549">ensure full and fair process and just</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="4.62">outcomes in that regard as you know the</text>
  <text start="180.209" dur="3.571">Department of Justice cannot provide</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="5.22">continuous updates on ongoing</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="5.94">investigations or confirm or deny the</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="4.05">existence thereof this is integral to</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="3.42">our duty to adhere to the highest</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="4.11">ethical standards and to ensure that</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="3.72">prosecutorial and investigative</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="4.05">decisions are made without political</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="7.86">bias or favoritism in either direction</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="10.62">so that says a lot about what stage</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re at as you are aware I&amp;#39;ve asked</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="3.66">the department&amp;#39;s Inspector General</text>
  <text start="211.53" dur="3.51">Michael Horowitz to review certain</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="2.97">matters that you and some members of</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="3.5">your committees have raised in recent</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="4.59">and previous previous letters in</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="4.6">addition to his ongoing investigation</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="3.54">the Inspector General has now confirmed</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="2.7">that he&amp;#39;s open to a review into the</text>
  <text start="224.58" dur="3.42">department&amp;#39;s compliance with certain</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="4.23">legal requirements and Department and</text>
  <text start="228" dur="4.32">FBI policies and procedures with respect</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="4.98">to certain applications filed with the</text>
  <text start="232.32" dur="4.23">Feist Court Congress created the</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="3.51">department&amp;#39;s office of the inspector</text>
  <text start="236.55" dur="4.86">general explicitly for the purpose of</text>
  <text start="238.56" dur="5.73">among other things investigating alleged</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="5.1">violations of criminal and civil laws by</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="4.53">Department employees including actions</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="5.1">taken by former employees after they</text>
  <text start="248.82" dur="4.58">have left government service that line</text>
  <text start="251.61" dur="4.65">is key right there</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="4.51">that line is key because that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="3.479">were saying that they wanted the special</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="2.88">counsel they were saying that the</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="2.341">special prosecute</text>
  <text start="260.79" dur="3.3">which is the same thing as a special</text>
  <text start="262.08" dur="3.87">counsel but whoever Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="3.54">appointed would not have the ability to</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="4.2">subpoena people who have left the</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="5.72">department and Jeff Sessions is</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="5.91">basically saying that that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="273.35" dur="4.39">he&amp;#39;s saying including actions taken by</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="4.74">former employees after they have left</text>
  <text start="277.74" dur="7.32">government service in addition this is</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="6.69">why the Inspector General Michael</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="5.25">Horowitz was so pissed off I covered</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="4.11">this in a previous video I talked about</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="3">Michael Horowitz and everybody was</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="3.87">saying he&amp;#39;s an Obama appointee well so</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="4.59">is the guy that they named in this</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="3.54">letter but don&amp;#39;t worry about it and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="297.9" dur="3.06">tell you why</text>
  <text start="299.01" dur="5.36">they&amp;#39;re saying basically like he&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="5.97">Obama appointee yes but Obama and holder</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="3.16">completely handcuffed his ability to do</text>
  <text start="306.93" dur="2.55">his job</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="5.46">because they made it so that he would</text>
  <text start="309.48" dur="5.28">have to go and ask the the heads of the</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="4.35">departments for the documents that he</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="6.84">needs to keep oversight over those</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="7.49">departments so basically I&amp;#39;m twisting in</text>
  <text start="321.6" dur="8.16">my chair hold on sorry</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="6.37">basically with that with he went through</text>
  <text start="329.76" dur="3.36">Congress to get all that taken care of</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="3.12">and they they made laws so that the</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="4.05">Justice Department isn&amp;#39;t allowed to</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="6.41">handicap its own investigative unit its</text>
  <text start="337.17" dur="6.98">own police to keep it honest so</text>
  <text start="340.73" dur="6.52">basically in this sentence right here</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="8.77">yum sessions is telling everybody look</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="7.32">guys he can he can look into things that</text>
  <text start="352.92" dur="3.81">employees that have left the department</text>
  <text start="354.57" dur="4.08">have done so he says here including</text>
  <text start="356.73" dur="3.63">actions taken by former employees after</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="4.14">they have left the government service</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="5.04">the Inspector General&amp;#39;s jurisdiction</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="5.04">extends not only to allegations of legal</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="4.68">violations but also to allegations that</text>
  <text start="367.83" dur="5.46">Department employ employees violated</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="4.56">established policies as well so what did</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="3.42">they do well inside the department that</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="5.88">maybe wasn&amp;#39;t criminal as well as what</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="5.49">did they do that was criminal to carry</text>
  <text start="380.52" dur="3.33">out these duties title five of the</text>
  <text start="382.2" dur="3.54">United States Code provided the</text>
  <text start="383.85" dur="5.22">Inspector General with broad discretion</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="6.51">and significant investigative powers the</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="5.37">office employs approximately 470 staff a</text>
  <text start="392.25" dur="4.77">significant number of whom are lawyer</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="5.61">auditors and investigators who may</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="4.98">exercise wide discretion on matters</text>
  <text start="400.05" dur="3.69">under their jurisdiction if the</text>
  <text start="402" dur="4.25">Inspector General finds evidence of</text>
  <text start="403.74" dur="4.98">criminal wrongdoing criminal wrongdoing</text>
  <text start="406.25" dur="4.48">I&amp;#39;m going to say it again criminal</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="5.37">wrongdoing thank you guys for the super</text>
  <text start="410.73" dur="4.98">chats thank you so much if the Inspector</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="6.24">General finds evidence of criminal</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="7.05">wrongdoing he may refer to a United</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="5.79">States Attorney who can then convene a</text>
  <text start="422.76" dur="6.78">grand jury or take other appropriate</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="5.79">actions and he says it again to be clear</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="5.21">the Inspector General has the authority</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="5.34">to investigate allegations of wrongdoing</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="5.05">collect evidence through subpoena and</text>
  <text start="437.25" dur="4.41">develop cases for presentation to the</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="6.56">Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="7.5">General for prosecution or other action</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="4.75">the Inspector General also may under</text>
  <text start="449.16" dur="3.87">appropriate circumstances make</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="4.74">information available to the public even</text>
  <text start="453.03" dur="5.1">if no criminal or disciplinary action is</text>
  <text start="455.85" dur="3.93">recommended in contrast this type of</text>
  <text start="458.13" dur="3.66">information would not normally be</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="4.74">publicly available after the conclusion</text>
  <text start="461.79" dur="4.8">of a traditional criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="4.49">he&amp;#39;s telling us in this paragraph they</text>
  <text start="466.59" dur="5.25">have criminal investigations ongoing</text>
  <text start="469.01" dur="4.39">that the Inspector General has much</text>
  <text start="471.84" dur="6.3">broader powers than what these people</text>
  <text start="473.4" dur="7.5">have been led to believe and that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.14" dur="5.39">been granted authority and wide</text>
  <text start="480.9" dur="7.38">discretion on matters under jurisdiction</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="6.22">not just entire I&amp;#39;ve always said this is</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="5.49">off the cuff for me so please forgive me</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;m not as I&amp;#39;m not very scripted um I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="4.74">never really scripted but you know what</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;m saying um so basically there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="498.51" dur="3.93">difference between an audit and an</text>
  <text start="500.58" dur="3.9">investigation what an Inspector General</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="3.81">you know takes on an investigation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.48" dur="4.26">a lot different than when he just audits</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="4.71">the department for wrongdoing if there</text>
  <text start="508.74" dur="4.229">is criminal activity that is raised</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="4.86">within an inspector general</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="4.471">investigation whoa what they do is they</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="4.219">take it to a US Attorney</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="7.38">well what Jeff Sessions is telling us is</text>
  <text start="520.039" dur="6.371">that he has a team of attorneys of US</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="2.94">Attorney&amp;#39;s that are working with the</text>
  <text start="526.41" dur="8.13">Inspector General on the</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="8.31">things pursuant to Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="534.54" dur="4.65">regulations the appointment of a special</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="4.98">counsel by design is reserved for use in</text>
  <text start="539.19" dur="4.26">only the most quote extraordinary</text>
  <text start="541.05" dur="4.23">circumstances under the regulations any</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="4.98">special counsel must be selected from</text>
  <text start="545.28" dur="4.59">outside the United States government to</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;m just going to tweet this really</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="5.79">quickly to justify such an appointment</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="3.21">the Attorney General would need to</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="3.87">conclude that the public interest would</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="4.02">be served by removing a large degree of</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="4.02">responsibility for the matter from the</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="4.11">Department of Justice the Department has</text>
  <text start="563.55" dur="4.17">successfully investigated and prosecuted</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="4.11">many high-profile resource-intensive</text>
  <text start="567.72" dur="4.2">matters since the regulations were</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="4.08">promulgated in 99 but regulations</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="8.7">standard has been found to be satisfied</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="8.82">on only two occasions so basically he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="3.81">saying the reason why Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="582.33" dur="5.22">appointed Muller is because he said</text>
  <text start="584.43" dur="8.61">because Jeff Sessions stepped down I</text>
  <text start="587.55" dur="8.01">mean it recused himself for that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="593.04" dur="7.02">he says he appointed Muller Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="595.56" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s what I found anyway stupid and I</text>
  <text start="600.06" dur="2.43">have a lot of articles to go over with</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="3.32">you guys but I want to get to something</text>
  <text start="602.49" dur="4.68">else that&amp;#39;s really important in here as</text>
  <text start="604.76" dur="5.2">noted in Assistant Attorney General</text>
  <text start="607.17" dur="4.32">Stephen E Boyd&amp;#39;s November 13 2017 letter</text>

  <text start="738.35" dur="13.89">long time quite a long time so I find it</text>
  <text start="747.56" dur="6.71">super interesting that not a lot of</text>
  <text start="752.24" dur="4.29">people caught on to this so basically</text>
  <text start="754.27" dur="4.27">the the only difference between a</text>
  <text start="756.53" dur="3.96">special prosecutor and a special special</text>
  <text start="758.54" dur="4.17">counsel at this point in time is that a</text>
  <text start="760.49" dur="4.08">special counsel would be someone from</text>

  <text start="769.339" dur="3.721">basically the same thing as per</text>
  <text start="770.81" dur="4.71">definition that I found online but</text>
  <text start="773.06" dur="4.23">basically the only difference is that</text>
  <text start="775.52" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re investigating within the Justice</text>
  <text start="777.29" dur="3.42">Department from outside of Washington</text>
  <text start="778.97" dur="5.25">they have all the same prosecutorial</text>
  <text start="780.71" dur="5.97">powers sessions was very clear and</text>
  <text start="784.22" dur="4.11">saying that they&amp;#39;re able to investigate</text>
  <text start="786.68" dur="3.63">people that have left the department</text>
  <text start="788.33" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re able to subpoena they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="790.31" dur="4.17">work with an attorney a US attorney to</text>
  <text start="792.47" dur="4.559">bring criminal charges there</text>
  <text start="794.48" dur="4.71">to bring a grand jury they&amp;#39;re able to do</text>
  <text start="797.029" dur="4.201">all these things as we proved the other</text>
  <text start="799.19" dur="3.959">day there is a grand jury appointed I</text>
  <text start="801.23" dur="3.39">think all these guys know it the fact</text>
  <text start="803.149" dur="4.141">that McCabe comes out with this little</text>
  <text start="804.62" dur="6.18">GoFundMe today is pretty telling as well</text>
  <text start="807.29" dur="5.82">and it seems to me that we&amp;#39;re about to</text>
  <text start="810.8" dur="3.39">probably see some indictment because</text>
  <text start="813.11" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re not going to come out with this</text>
  <text start="814.19" dur="9.03">guy&amp;#39;s name while he&amp;#39;s still poking</text>
