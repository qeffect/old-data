  <text start="110.03" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;m gonna go through this entire thread</text>
  <text start="111.56" dur="5">from him and hopefully this helps with</text>

  <text start="116.56" dur="3.419">present to you guys</text>
  <text start="120.159" dur="4.681">Inspector General Michael Horowitz is</text>
  <text start="122.659" dur="4.66">war versus the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="5.61">interesting</text>
  <text start="127.319" dur="6.131">Obama nominated Michael Horowitz in July</text>
  <text start="130.45" dur="5.61">of 2011 to fill a vacancy vacancy left</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="4.98">open by the resignation of Glenn fine in</text>
  <text start="136.06" dur="4.95">February mr. Horowitz was confirmed in</text>
  <text start="138.43" dur="5.94">March the following year and sworn in on</text>
  <text start="141.01" dur="5.82">April 16 2012 and the link to this is</text>
  <text start="144.37" dur="5.94">presented this is why I love this stuff</text>
  <text start="146.83" dur="6.299">because he sources everything for you</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="5.31">the threads are detailed and so full of</text>
  <text start="153.129" dur="4.5">knowledge I mean I love it I love it it</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="2.64">was a nomination Obama would come to</text>
  <text start="157.629" dur="2.911">regret</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="5.1">Horowitz inherited a position that was</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="5.729">effectively neutered in 2011 by Eric</text>
  <text start="163.36" dur="7.14">Holder&amp;#39;s interpretation of the inspector</text>
  <text start="166.269" dur="6.271">general Act of 1978 and he puts a link</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="4.41">to the act itself which we are not going</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="4.77">to go through right now Holder and his</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="5.639">legal team determined that the IG had to</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="5.91">request information this allowed Holder</text>
  <text start="180.549" dur="5.25">and other agency heads to bog down IG</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="4.95">requests in bureaucratic red tape and in</text>
  <text start="185.799" dur="3.72">some cases deny them outright so</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="3.629">basically what they did was they</text>
  <text start="189.519" dur="4.981">handcuffed the IG to actually do his job</text>
  <text start="191.799" dur="5.16">they required the IG to ask permission</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="5.34">for things for them to look at that</text>
  <text start="196.959" dur="4.5">would that they were investigating so</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re basically asking the</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="6.96">investigator I mean the subject of the</text>
  <text start="205.69" dur="5.22">investigation if they can have documents</text>
  <text start="208.419" dur="8.311">that they&amp;#39;re using to investigate that</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="8.009">person crazy what caused Holder to make</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="3.03">such a drastic move to block the IG in</text>
  <text start="218.919" dur="6.54">2011</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="8.49">fast and furious corruption to the core</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="4.89">guys corruption to the core my volume is</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="3.599">up pretty much as long as it could be as</text>
  <text start="230.349" dur="5.73">loud as it could be I can&amp;#39;t really raise</text>
  <text start="231.849" dur="7.98">it morale pop Michael Horowitz was a</text>
  <text start="236.079" dur="6.69">lame duck on day one what did he do he</text>
  <text start="239.829" dur="4.77">methodically went to war one might call</text>
  <text start="242.769" dur="3.09">it a war of independence because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.599" dur="6.061">exactly what it was</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="6.901">shots fired March 5th 2013 the</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="4.259">inspectors general prepared a report for</text>
  <text start="252.76" dur="5.58">Congress titled open and unimplemented</text>
  <text start="254.919" dur="5.44">IG recommendations this report drew</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="4.15">attention to the stonewalling</text>
  <text start="260.359" dur="4.62">focusing on the money being wasted but</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="5.489">it was much more than that so in other</text>
  <text start="264.979" dur="6.481">words the inspectors general office</text>
  <text start="267.979" dur="5.731">wrote a report on how the extra steps</text>
  <text start="271.46" dur="4.29">that the IG needed to go through with</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="4.829">personnel etc to be able to get the</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="4.56">people they were looking to oversee to</text>
  <text start="278.539" dur="4.711">provide them with the information they</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="6.74">needed to do their oversight was a money</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="9.03">waster sohara where her wits decided to</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="6.82">go into a different Lane to invest to to</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="4.949">get his point across and to maybe change</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="6.84">it so he tried to do it with government</text>
  <text start="297.229" dur="9.15">reform in budget Michael Horowitz laid</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="7.5">the Obama administration administration</text>
  <text start="306.379" dur="2.28">that was wasting money at an alarming</text>
  <text start="308.21" dur="2.88">rate</text>
  <text start="308.659" dur="4.681">just by ignoring the Inspector General</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="4.02">so you can see the amount of dollars</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="3.84">that go from making the Inspector</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="7.679">General turn their wheels why even have</text>
  <text start="317.18" dur="7.049">an inspector general why why Horowitz</text>
  <text start="322.789" dur="4.171">was laying the groundwork for an</text>
  <text start="324.229" dur="4.231">alliance with Congress an alliance that</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="4.489">would pay off in his quest for</text>
  <text start="328.46" dur="4.949">independence which he&amp;#39;s supposed to have</text>
  <text start="331.449" dur="4.18">he would supply them with information</text>
  <text start="333.409" dur="5.43">and appear at hearings to publicly make</text>
  <text start="335.629" dur="6.51">his case an inside-outside approach the</text>
  <text start="338.839" dur="6.57">balance of the 2013 the balance of 2013</text>
  <text start="342.139" dur="4.89">the DOJ IG bid his time and did the best</text>
  <text start="345.409" dur="3.69">he could under the circumstances</text>
  <text start="347.029" dur="4.681">here he is back here he would strike</text>
  <text start="349.099" dur="5.28">again on April 3rd 2014 at the end of</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="4.5">the DOJ budget hearing in other words</text>

  <text start="360.199" dur="5.041">as he is called to testify Holder walks</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="4.47">by him without acknowledgement he is a</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="6.979">proverbial thorn in the side and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="4.729">gonna play that for you guys right now</text>
  <text start="376.569" dur="3">areas</text>

  <text start="392.06" dur="7.5">Horowitz doesn&amp;#39;t even pay any attention</text>
  <text start="394.16" dur="7.23">to him interesting his opening statement</text>
  <text start="399.56" dur="4.02">is five minutes he spends the first</text>
  <text start="401.39" dur="5.67">three of it discussing his organization</text>
  <text start="403.58" dur="49.86">before getting down to brass tacks let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="50.28">go through that chute there&amp;#39;s no volume</text>
  <text start="453.44" dur="10.38">huh ah goodness this is why I hate live</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="13.5">streams but I just don&amp;#39;t have time to</text>
  <text start="463.82" dur="9.12">process a video hmm all right well</text>
  <text start="470.84" dur="4.11">basically in here he&amp;#39;s asking for he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.94" dur="3.63">asking for all I&amp;#39;ve linked the video in</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="3.87">the description box for you I link the</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="4.02">thread he&amp;#39;s saying that they need to be</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="3.93">providing him with the documentation</text>
  <text start="480.59" dur="4.65">that he needs to be able to do his job</text>
  <text start="482.75" dur="3.99">and they&amp;#39;re not doing it and the next we</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="3.39">have what ensues is a series of</text>
  <text start="486.74" dur="3.81">questions that are budgetary in nature</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="3.86">with the exception of the line of</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="4.92">questioning pursued by Senator Shelby</text>
  <text start="492.49" dur="4.6">Shelby is in the minority as Obama has</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="4.11">not let yet lost the Senate</text>
  <text start="497.09" dur="4.83">Shelby&amp;#39;s time is limited watch how beat</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="3.6">both he and Horowitz work together and</text>
  <text start="501.92" dur="2.67">sadly you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="503.18" dur="3.03">hear it but it&amp;#39;s a two minute and ten</text>
  <text start="504.59" dur="4.29">second clip where they basically bounce</text>
  <text start="506.21" dur="4.2">off of one another and they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="5.4">each other up to be able to get to the</text>

  <text start="515.03" dur="4.35">the legislative endgame and it says keep</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="5.49">this clip in mind as things unfold I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="519.38" dur="5.58">so frustrated right now in watching the</text>
  <text start="522.98" dur="3.96">hearing I found it interesting how the</text>
  <text start="524.96" dur="6.14">room cleared out and Horowitz was alone</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="7.83">with just his team a man on an island</text>

  <text start="1075.7" dur="7.89">that the the story that there the text</text>
  <text start="1080.5" dur="5.399">messages were missing was actually kind</text>

  <text start="1085.899" dur="7.171">the entire time they had the text</text>
  <text start="1090.909" dur="3.72">messages somebody said to struck and</text>

  <text start="1101.11" dur="5.58">then off we go into down the rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="1104.169" dur="3.84">of trying to catch who the leaker is and</text>
  <text start="1106.69" dur="3.239">why they would say that and why they</text>
  <text start="1108.009" dur="7.471">would delete them after the after the</text>
  <text start="1109.929" dur="8.521">fact and then we have this letter which</text>
  <text start="1115.48" dur="7.74">is very long but the crux of it is</text>
  <text start="1118.45" dur="10.109">basically this letter is from its to</text>
  <text start="1123.22" dur="12.27">Christopher Rea and it is from chuck</text>
  <text start="1128.559" dur="8.671">Grassley so what they do here is they</text>
  <text start="1135.49" dur="3.179">break down some of the text messages and</text>
  <text start="1137.23" dur="4.59">the conflicts of interest and the things</text>

  <text start="1151.6" dur="5.459">on former Secretary of State Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1154.84" dur="3.99">private email server and now remember</text>
  <text start="1157.059" dur="3.33">there were like eight investigations</text>
  <text start="1158.83" dur="5.099">running in tandem with one another at</text>
  <text start="1160.389" dur="4.921">the same time so there&amp;#39;s the</text>

  <text start="1195.52" dur="4.26">the best ratio should be and what</text>
  <text start="1198.22" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re basically doing here is asking</text>

  <text start="1248.05" dur="4.17">are are basically the crux of so many</text>
