  <text start="44.55" dur="7.02">Friday January 18th 2019 and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="4.169">sitting here we just did the show Frank</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="5.55">and I record the podcast at 11:00 on</text>

  <text start="63.75" dur="3.299">you guys today anyway but it&amp;#39;s taking me</text>
  <text start="65.88" dur="2.7">a little longer than I thought to get</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="3.36">the information together so I figured I</text>
  <text start="68.58" dur="4.2">would you know kind of just talk to you</text>
  <text start="70.409" dur="4.471">for a little bit about what my</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="4.26">perspective is on what I see happening</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="4.77">and what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s getting me frustrated</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="5.25">and how the games played just from again</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="4.59">my perspective so if you guys like</text>
  <text start="82.29" dur="4.35">research videos and research videos only</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="4.64">this is probably not the video for you</text>
  <text start="86.64" dur="5.99">but if you like kind of like a conscious</text>
  <text start="88.88" dur="10.87">stream of thought from me if you care</text>
  <text start="92.63" dur="9.309">what my opinion is then stay tuned so I</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="5.939">was kind of like I&amp;#39;ve been up at night</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="5.64">unable to sleep sort of trying to put</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="3.811">everything together in my head and um</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="3.72">you know we had a bunch of stuff</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="3.21">happened this past week all of which was</text>
  <text start="111.299" dur="4.201">pretty much detrimental for the</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="4.799">conspirators and we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="115.5" dur="4.68">this ball rolling slowly and you know</text>

  <text start="137.64" dur="3.03">put everything together and we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="139.29" dur="3.15">all these things happen over the past</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="3.209">week that are not looking good for the</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="3.21">conspirators we&amp;#39;re seeing Andrew</text>
  <text start="143.879" dur="5.22">McCabe&amp;#39;s disgusting face on the screen</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="5.369">right now Friday we had the article from</text>
  <text start="149.099" dur="5.521">the New York Times that purported to</text>
  <text start="151.019" dur="5.641">explain why the FBI opened a</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="4.5">counterintelligence operation or an</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="3.99">investigation into Donald Trump while he</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="3.36">was a sitting president and the three</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="3.57">use reasons they used were that he</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="3.869">didn&amp;#39;t like his foreign policy during</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="4.859">the election they didn&amp;#39;t like that he</text>
  <text start="166.349" dur="4.47">joked around about hacking Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.079" dur="3.541">emails which they&amp;#39;d never admit as a</text>
  <text start="170.819" dur="4.53">joke they say he was serious about that</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="4.739">and we don&amp;#39;t even need to get into why</text>
  <text start="175.349" dur="3.931">that&amp;#39;s the most ridiculous nonsense in</text>
  <text start="177.359" dur="3.301">the entire universe and then they</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="4.459">mentioned the Republican party platform</text>
  <text start="180.66" dur="5.85">and and the entire article was a weak</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="5.201">attempt to try and get out in front of</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="4.02">whatever is coming down the pike and we</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="5.46">started to get a glimpse of what that</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="5.519">whatever is this week as well the next</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="4.769">things that happened were significant</text>
  <text start="196.049" dur="5.101">for many reasons number one the power of</text>
  <text start="199.169" dur="5.04">independent journalism number two the</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="5.64">power of media like the Epoch Times that</text>
  <text start="204.209" dur="6.511">is unbiased in its presentation of facts</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="7.919">and the other that we got information</text>
  <text start="210.72" dur="6.93">from testimony that was done that we</text>
  <text start="214.709" dur="7.071">haven&amp;#39;t seen yet now I want the raw</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="6.839">transcripts as bad as you guys do oops</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="4.66">shut that down I want the raw</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="3.391">transcripts as bad as you guys do and</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="3.419">I&amp;#39;m waiting for them to come but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="3.87">thinking about this and first of all</text>
  <text start="229.859" dur="4.261">whoever leaked these transcripts leaked</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="5.97">them to Jeff and then another reporter</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="5.16">from The Epoch Times Jeff I I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="3.299">gonna pretend that I&amp;#39;m best friends with</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="3.389">them or anything but we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="241.019" dur="4.291">topics together we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="242.669" dur="4.981">Papadopoulos together at length he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="5.22">great guy he&amp;#39;s really good at what he</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="5.04">does he&amp;#39;s a great reporter he doesn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t do opinion reporting like I even</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="5.43">do opinion reporting sometimes he</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t do that he&amp;#39;s not an opinion he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="4.02">not an opinion guy he&amp;#39;s a fact guy he</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="6.599">does facts and he does them really well</text>
  <text start="262.14" dur="5.79">and these these hearings were not comfy</text>
  <text start="266.669" dur="2.34">you know they weren&amp;#39;t calm</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="2.91">potential hearings these weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="269.009" dur="3.78">hearings where there was confidential</text>
  <text start="270.84" dur="3.359">information or classified information in</text>
  <text start="272.789" dur="2.641">them and now the transcripts are being</text>
  <text start="274.199" dur="4.171">leaked out so that classified</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="5.4">information know these were closed-door</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="4.769">hearings that were closed-door because</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.29">they didn&amp;#39;t want the co-conspirators to</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="4.5">hear what the other people were saying</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="4.41">case in point glenn simpson&amp;#39;s testimony</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="4.53">was leaked by nancy pelosi because she</text>
  <text start="289.53" dur="4.29">had a cold no he would her testimony was</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="3.331">lee his testimony was leaked so everyone</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="4.68">else could see what he said because his</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="6.74">company is the foundation of much of</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="6.479">this Spygate story so nancy pelosi</text>
  <text start="302.24" dur="4">conspires with the bad guys to leak</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="2.851">testimony that should tell you</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="3.359">everything you need to know right there</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="4.2">but there are so many more things about</text>
  <text start="309.599" dur="2.82">Pelosi that I&amp;#39;m not pelosi-feinstein my</text>
  <text start="312.03" dur="7.319">bad</text>
  <text start="312.419" dur="10.201">Feinstein leaks it so these transcripts</text>
  <text start="319.349" dur="6.841">were given to Jeff and the epoch times</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="5.49">as a whole because I think and I might</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="3.42">be wrong about this but I honestly feel</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="3.779">like it&amp;#39;s because of the shutdown and</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="5.21">they can&amp;#39;t release them yet</text>
  <text start="331.889" dur="6.451">I suppose I don&amp;#39;t think that a</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="4.99">congressman or a US I don&amp;#39;t think anyone</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="4.71">on the committee can release this</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="5.7">without having a vote so I think that</text>
  <text start="343.05" dur="4.679">there&amp;#39;s a very strict timetable being</text>
  <text start="345.51" dur="4.74">adhered to here and I think that getting</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="4.891">those pieces of information out was</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="5.61">crucial keep the timeline moving this is</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="5.49">again an opinion video this is not based</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="4.589">on any facts this is not based on hard</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="5.66">evidence this is me speculating and I</text>
  <text start="360.449" dur="6.481">just just understand that I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="363.77" dur="5.2">giving you my thoughts on without</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="5.28">without this is not one of my research</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="4.319">pieces this is just a talk I just want</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="3.209">to make sure that people understand</text>
  <text start="373.289" dur="3.6">because I like to make sure that I</text>
  <text start="375.419" dur="5.041">differentiate between the two it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.889" dur="6.09">really important really important so I</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="4.679">think that there&amp;#39;s a timeline here and</text>
  <text start="382.979" dur="4.591">these transcripts need to get out so</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="5.551">what did we get first we got lisa page</text>
  <text start="387.57" dur="4.439">we got lisa page testimony that she and</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="3.719">what i&amp;#39;m doing is i&amp;#39;m putting all of</text>
  <text start="392.009" dur="5.671">this into a timeline all of these new</text>
  <text start="394.409" dur="6.741">dates into a big timeline to put a story</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="5.81">together of these three these three</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="4.32">people and how this all interweaves and</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="8.13">it&amp;#39;s just taking a really long time so</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="9.69">we find out from lisa page that she</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="7.77">didn&amp;#39;t know that john brennan had a copy</text>
  <text start="415.16" dur="7.47">of the dossier before the FBI and that</text>
  <text start="419.39" dur="8.01">is so important why because john brennan</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="7.56">is working with harry reid and the</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="6.15">president but harry reid john brennan</text>
  <text start="430.19" dur="6.36">briefs harry reid on the dossier and</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="5.34">then harry reid writes a letter to the</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="4.68">FBI asking them to investigate this and</text>
  <text start="438.89" dur="3.9">what we&amp;#39;re gonna see is a common theme</text>
  <text start="441.23" dur="3.36">here and we&amp;#39;re gonna focus on a little</text>
  <text start="442.79" dur="5.01">bit towards the end of this is that</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="6">there is a laundering operation being</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="5.25">done all over the place with information</text>
  <text start="450.59" dur="3.87">to boost its credibility and get it to</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="4.1">be more important than it actually is</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="5.1">most of the time it&amp;#39;s not even true and</text>
  <text start="457.15" dur="3.78">this is what has me so fired up about</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="5.79">this</text>
  <text start="460.93" dur="6.88">so harry reid we talked about on the</text>
  <text start="465.35" dur="4.94">podcast last week is not doing so well</text>
  <text start="467.81" dur="5.82">article came out saying he&amp;#39;s just got</text>
  <text start="470.29" dur="5.2">not much time left to live just add that</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="3.54">to the list of people involved in the</text>
  <text start="475.49" dur="4.62">scandal who have suddenly passed away</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="5.37">over the past year I mean I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="4.86">just a coincidence I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="482.54" dur="7.5">looking far too too far into it whatever</text>
  <text start="484.97" dur="7.01">it&amp;#39;s just weird I&amp;#39;m sorry so we get that</text>
  <text start="490.04" dur="7.26">at a page we also get out of page a</text>
  <text start="491.98" dur="7.45">discrepancy about or Bruce or who is the</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="3.33">next and there&amp;#39;s a lot more in the Lisa</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="4.29">page testimony I&amp;#39;m just giving you</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="5.31">highlights the next person to come out</text>
  <text start="503.72" dur="5.43">the next testimony to come out is Bruce</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="5.76">or and Bruce or is nothing but fort</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="6.87">forthright with this committee he spills</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="6.42">it like crazy he says that he briefed</text>
  <text start="516.02" dur="3.66">loose a page in July and Lisa page</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="3.15">denies that ever happened then we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="5.88">one of them lying who do you think it is</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="7.38">Lisa page or do you think it&amp;#39;s Bruce or</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="5.13">well I think it&amp;#39;s Lisa page because the</text>
  <text start="528.65" dur="3.96">if you remember the New York Times again</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="4.14">came out with an article of months ago</text>
  <text start="532.61" dur="5.4">saying that crossfire hurricane</text>
  <text start="534.83" dur="6.48">was born out of the need to investigate</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="5.58">George papadopolis it looks a lot more</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="4.44">likely that crossfire hurricane was born</text>
  <text start="543.59" dur="4.26">out of the dossier and this is a</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="4.83">separate investigation from the one that</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="5.39">they admitted was done you know against</text>
  <text start="550.58" dur="4.92">a sitting president after he was elected</text>
  <text start="553.24" dur="4.09">so I&amp;#39;m sitting here I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="555.5" dur="6">this story today on the podcast and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="557.33" dur="6.93">just I&amp;#39;m like is it even possible that</text>

  <text start="573.11" dur="5.91">just are we no we&amp;#39;re not this is</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="3.42">actually what happened this really</text>

  <text start="579.56" dur="5.79">so the or testimony is picked up by</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="6.27">Sarah Carter and John Solomon and they</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="5.24">add on top of it but Jeff Carlson breaks</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="5.22">it which shows you the power of</text>
  <text start="590.59" dur="5.17">independent media he was picked up as</text>
  <text start="593.66" dur="4.29">independent media the Epoch Times went</text>

  <text start="849.47" dur="3.869">this damning stuff is coming out and and</text>
  <text start="851.389" dur="6.031">just looking at the cognitive dissonance</text>

  <text start="857.42" dur="4.77">that this story is is implicating Donald</text>
  <text start="860.24" dur="4.349">Trump and some kind of wrongdoing and</text>
  <text start="862.19" dur="5.129">then I start to see the pushback and</text>

  <text start="890.269" dur="3.031">toot my own horn I&amp;#39;m only saying it</text>
  <text start="891.98" dur="4.08">because I&amp;#39;ve been looking at him from</text>
  <text start="893.3" dur="5.159">this perspective for almost a year and I</text>
  <text start="896.06" dur="4.74">know what he&amp;#39;s capable of because of it</text>
  <text start="898.459" dur="5.641">he comes out they come out with this</text>
  <text start="900.8" dur="7.38">thing that that Michael Cohen paid this</text>

  <text start="970.04" dur="6.48">stupid and then that led me to start</text>
  <text start="974.45" dur="6.06">thinking about the media as a whole and</text>
  <text start="976.52" dur="6.42">like what the game is here and Frank</text>

  <text start="993.02" dur="4.71">way back then because they needed to</text>
  <text start="995.48" dur="4.32">advance this certain narrative and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="997.73" dur="5.04">saying to myself while I&amp;#39;m reading this</text>
  <text start="999.8" dur="6.65">I&amp;#39;m saying the fact that you guys are</text>
