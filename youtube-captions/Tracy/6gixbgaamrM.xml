  <text start="99.329" dur="4.83">many years ago that we were gonna start</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="5.82">doing movies that delved into social</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="6.42">issues that are not often or rarely if</text>

  <text start="129.69" dur="3.37">started talking about how you got</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="3.78">started in this industry at all so</text>
  <text start="133.06" dur="5.64">I want to go back through that again</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="7.57">tell it tell me about that so I got my</text>
  <text start="138.7" dur="6.3">start in film in 1999 on the set of</text>
  <text start="142.3" dur="5.04">Remember the Titans I was in college at</text>
  <text start="145" dur="4.739">Georgia State University I was gonna be</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="5.399">a businessman and a Salesman at a full</text>
  <text start="149.739" dur="5.311">time job and I got an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="152.739" dur="3.991">take a course as an elective on the</text>
  <text start="155.05" dur="4.2">history of motion pictures where I</text>
  <text start="156.73" dur="5.91">learned everything from the very first</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="5.989">film in 1895 all the way up through</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="6.599">Citizen Kane Sunset Boulevard to the</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="5.981">classics today and it reinvigorated a</text>
  <text start="169.239" dur="3.871">love that I had always had for cinema</text>
  <text start="171.22" dur="5.7">the arts because I was an actor as a</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="6.36">child in addition to playing sports the</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="5.129">instructor of that class had an acting</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="5.31">class outside and he had invited me to</text>
  <text start="182.049" dur="5.19">come up and shadow the class it got my</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="4.8">creative juices flowing again and six</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="4.53">months later the production of Remember</text>
  <text start="189.58" dur="4.98">the Titans with Denzel Washington came</text>
  <text start="191.769" dur="4.44">to town I auditioned for it and I got a</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="3.59">role as one of the Titan football</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="4.62">players for two months on the belt and</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="4.959">then the rest just took off from there I</text>
  <text start="200.829" dur="4.351">ended up starting and going into</text>
  <text start="203.109" dur="4.891">productions locally in Atlanta for about</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="5.73">a year and working on as many low-budget</text>
  <text start="208" dur="4.819">micro budget no budget films as possible</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="4.32">just to get the experience and</text>
  <text start="212.819" dur="4.45">eventually once we had the premiere out</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="3.96">here in LA I took a trip out here for</text>
  <text start="217.269" dur="4.021">four days absolutely fell in love with</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="4.41">it and three months later I was heading</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="5.779">out across country moving into LA</text>
  <text start="223.6" dur="5.609">sleeping on a floor no money no job and</text>
  <text start="227.069" dur="2.95">diving right in not knowing what the</text>
  <text start="229.209" dur="3.421">hell I was doing</text>
  <text start="230.019" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s the story right that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="3.359">pretty much the story of but you were</text>
  <text start="234.579" dur="3.63">actually you know ended up being</text>
  <text start="235.989" dur="4.771">successful and before we go into more of</text>
  <text start="238.209" dur="5.551">what you did in Hollywood before this</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="5.009">venture that you&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of</text>
  <text start="243.76" dur="4.289">people here you know he was in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s got to be a bad guy so why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="5.431">you explain how you know you know the</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="4.98">stigma right so explain how how you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="3.24">like different and what your experience</text>
  <text start="255.549" dur="3.99">has been that&amp;#39;s kind of taught you</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="4.47">differently and what you maybe have seen</text>
  <text start="259.539" dur="5.461">that you didn&amp;#39;t like or you know</text>
  <text start="261.19" dur="5.46">anything like that yeah I think it goes</text>
  <text start="265" dur="3.99">back actually to one</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="3.989">Elmen name was Sean Marshall and he was</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="3.959">a driver for Jerry Bruckheimer on</text>
  <text start="270.639" dur="4.411">Remember the Titans and he knew that I</text>
  <text start="272.949" dur="3.481">was gonna move out to LA and the one</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="3">thing that he said has always stayed</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="3.329">with me it has always been true and I</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="3.899">say it&amp;#39;s not only about myself but of</text>
  <text start="279.759" dur="4.711">other people he said John whatever</text>
  <text start="281.949" dur="5.821">you&amp;#39;re doing here in Atlanta or wherever</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="5.28">you come from you will do more of in LA</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="4.56">and what he meant by that and what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="4.5">seen and my time out here is that people</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="3.99">become more of who they are because</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re enabled to be that way</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="5.7">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you change so who I was</text>
  <text start="299.08" dur="4.83">as a person and combination of the</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="4.41">discovery through the journey of my art</text>
  <text start="303.91" dur="4.8">to find the truth about who I was what I</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="5.13">was as a person what I truly believed in</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="5.73">what I believed in this world has been a</text>
  <text start="311.56" dur="5.31">journey into myself as much as it is</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="5.25">been about telling these movies it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.87" dur="5.579">really been about uncovering deeper</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="4.53">issues that are not only external but</text>
  <text start="322.449" dur="5.521">they&amp;#39;re also internal with each and</text>
  <text start="324.22" dur="6.54">every one of us so how I stayed quote</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="5.16">you know who I was without compromising</text>
  <text start="330.76" dur="6.33">myself was very simple I just chose not</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="6">to do it because it wasn&amp;#39;t who I was and</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="4.44">you know obviously people have a stigma</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="4.44">about Los Angeles which there is a I</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="4.5">would say more than just a kernel of</text>
  <text start="343.57" dur="3.81">truth but what you have to realize is</text>
  <text start="346.03" dur="3.93">that there are a lot of people coming</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="5.039">out here for different reasons many of</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="6.239">them motivated by issues back at home</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="6.03">and and what Hollywood does in its image</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="4.321">is it gives you an escape it gives you</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="4.231">an alternative reality it gives you the</text>
  <text start="360.52" dur="5.19">option to pursue Fame and celebrity</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="4.53">culture that they promote it gives you</text>
  <text start="365.71" dur="4.139">an opportunity to feel like you have</text>
  <text start="367.21" dur="5.04">power or that you&amp;#39;re doing something so</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="5.301">it&amp;#39;s not to say that all creative and</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="5.13">artistic pursuits in the industry are</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="4.21">motivated by those things but a lot of</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="4.38">people and that stigma that you hear</text>
  <text start="379.36" dur="5.01">about Los Angeles being a very shallow</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="7.05">empty and kind of hateful place or a</text>
  <text start="384.37" dur="7.74">very material materialistic or</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="5.43">narcissistic place it comes from other</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="4.5">things that these are symptoms that</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="5.52">you&amp;#39;re perceiving of a bigger issue that</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="4.13">is inside of people safe and and even in</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="4.82">spite of yeah</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="6.329">sorry go ahead no I&amp;#39;m saying even in</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="4.89">spite of that though you still have to</text>
  <text start="407.069" dur="5.511">entertain that you don&amp;#39;t have to become</text>
  <text start="409.47" dur="6.449">that in order to make it in the industry</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="5.23">or be successful or enjoy your creative</text>
  <text start="415.919" dur="4.231">endeavors you don&amp;#39;t have to compromise</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="4.35">or change anything about yourself in</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.739">fact I believe the opposite is true if</text>
  <text start="422.16" dur="5.28">my work is any example of that is that</text>
  <text start="424.889" dur="4.59">we go deeper and we get better and we</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="5.03">harness our craft and we tell more</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="7.891">honest things that ring true across all</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="6.789">of society not just with a an agenda or</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="4.019">only showing a certain shade of</text>
  <text start="439.259" dur="5.071">something or giving somebody a sense</text>
  <text start="441.389" dur="4.59">that there is a hope without uncovering</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="3.209">really what the truth is</text>
  <text start="445.979" dur="5.011">right I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="447.539" dur="5.19">art should be in my view is an honest</text>
  <text start="450.99" dur="4.019">expression of what you believe to be</text>
  <text start="452.729" dur="5.131">true about the world that you see around</text>
  <text start="455.009" dur="3.301">you and what you may be able to do about</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="3.029">it</text>
  <text start="458.31" dur="6.56">in inspiring others through that pursuit</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="6.381">of truth so do you think that because of</text>
  <text start="464.87" dur="5.38">all of those things that you mentioned</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="7.98">do you think that the escape for people</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="8.219">is sort of somehow maybe sometimes like</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="4.84">exacerbating a problem that or or a way</text>
  <text start="478.469" dur="4.351">of being that was already there before</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="6.24">but now is enabled and sometimes even</text>
  <text start="482.82" dur="5.25">exploited for different ulterior motives</text>
  <text start="486.33" dur="4.32">so if you&amp;#39;re if you have your head on</text>
  <text start="488.07" dur="4.17">your shoulders and you go there I know a</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="4.079">lot of people even writers and stuff</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="5.28">that do amazing work you know red pill</text>
  <text start="494.729" dur="4.74">work for Hollywood just just what is the</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="4.92">agenda of a lot of the people out there</text>
  <text start="499.469" dur="4.801">like what is the agenda tell us about</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="3.81">like studio heads and you know is it</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="4.709">what I&amp;#39;m trying to get down to is is it</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="5.31">every stereotype that we hear or is it</text>
  <text start="508.979" dur="4.591">really is it is that really kind of</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="6.269">blown out of proportion like what&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="513.57" dur="7.74">experience been what I would I would say</text>
  <text start="517.829" dur="5.371">is that I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s in the heart</text>
  <text start="521.31" dur="4.98">and mind of people right I mean I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="5.34">just observe that only based on their</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="5.43">actions can I kind of begin to compile</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="5.52">what it all means but let me just put it</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="5.29">another way across a larger</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="7.269">bigger broader picture of 40,000 foot</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="6.09">view if you call it people you I and</text>
  <text start="541.329" dur="7.471">everyone else out there cannot betray</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="8.07">who we are in other words you you can</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="4.68">call it compromising call it a choice I</text>
  <text start="551.17" dur="4.74">call it a compulsion so if you&amp;#39;re if</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;re in a system that attracts a</text>
  <text start="555.91" dur="6.78">certain type of person or a certain type</text>
  <text start="558.43" dur="6.39">of thinking and you can you reinforce it</text>
  <text start="562.69" dur="4.589">and you reward it you&amp;#39;re gonna attract</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="5.25">more of the same types of people who</text>
  <text start="567.279" dur="5.731">believe that that is correct</text>
  <text start="570.07" dur="6.03">then in other words my social status my</text>
  <text start="573.01" dur="6.99">my money my position of power my status</text>
  <text start="576.1" dur="6.9">is a reflection of my worth which is is</text>
  <text start="580" dur="5.73">deeper in the issue of self worth and</text>
  <text start="583" dur="4.8">self love if you&amp;#39;re loved as a person</text>
  <text start="585.73" dur="4.95">you don&amp;#39;t really rise up to seek power</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="4.89">and have control over people and then</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="5.64">use that position of power to then crush</text>
  <text start="592.69" dur="7.41">people and and make your quote Empire</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="6.72">around destruction you end up making it</text>
  <text start="600.1" dur="6.179">about creation and ideas and imagination</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="6.239">in creativity so in other words</text>
  <text start="606.279" dur="5.67">Hollywood is the most visible of all the</text>
  <text start="609.279" dur="5.611">industries that have a face in the</text>
  <text start="611.949" dur="4.89">public we can debate why that is and I</text>
  <text start="614.89" dur="4.59">have a pretty good idea in terms of what</text>

  <text start="1365.74" dur="3.57">know I think it&amp;#39;s important to speak to</text>
  <text start="1367.78" dur="4.02">the transition that you went through</text>
  <text start="1369.31" dur="4.86">because it&amp;#39;s nothing short you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1371.8" dur="4.11">not a small deal in a very short period</text>

  <text start="1381.1" dur="2.58">telling people to try and have just a</text>
  <text start="1382.51" dur="3.09">little bit of patience with folks that</text>
  <text start="1383.68" dur="3.93">just wake up all of a sudden because you</text>
  <text start="1385.6" dur="4.17">talk about binge watching think of the</text>
  <text start="1387.61" dur="3.81">amount of information you had to consume</text>
  <text start="1389.77" dur="3.3">then the amount of information you had</text>
  <text start="1391.42" dur="2.88">to filter through and find the BSN</text>
  <text start="1393.07" dur="3.27">because there&amp;#39;s plenty of that going</text>
  <text start="1394.3" dur="3.48">around and then you have to come up with</text>
  <text start="1396.34" dur="4.17">something that really spoke to you in</text>
  <text start="1397.78" dur="4.41">terms of what like what&amp;#39;s moving you</text>
  <text start="1400.51" dur="5.1">what&amp;#39;s motivating you especially as a</text>
  <text start="1402.19" dur="11.7">creator as you are how do you go out and</text>
  <text start="1405.61" dur="10.59">cast a movie like this well we didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1413.89" dur="4.83">to agents we didn&amp;#39;t go to managers we</text>
  <text start="1416.2" dur="4.47">went straight to the sources that we</text>
  <text start="1418.72" dur="3.54">found the most success in finding all of</text>
  <text start="1420.67" dur="5.7">our talent our movies which is like la</text>
  <text start="1422.26" dur="6.39">casting and backstage to go online and I</text>
  <text start="1426.37" dur="4.47">know from my experience that you can</text>
  <text start="1428.65" dur="5.81">find amazing talent that&amp;#39;s the one thing</text>
  <text start="1430.84" dur="6.96">that la does have it has an abundance of</text>
  <text start="1434.46" dur="5.77">undiscovered untapped talent that is</text>
  <text start="1437.8" dur="4.44">available you just have to look for it</text>
  <text start="1440.23" dur="3.27">and find it all of our actors I mean</text>
  <text start="1442.24" dur="3.09">this is the thing that nobody can</text>
  <text start="1443.5" dur="4.2">believe all of our actors were not in</text>
  <text start="1445.33" dur="6.06">the Union all of our actors including</text>
  <text start="1447.7" dur="7.08">our two leads are non-union and this is</text>
  <text start="1451.39" dur="7.5">the first feature and first film in a</text>
  <text start="1454.78" dur="6.27">lead that they&amp;#39;ve had and so when you</text>
  <text start="1458.89" dur="5.22">have when you have a director like acre</text>
  <text start="1461.05" dur="5.1">and you have a talent like mine which is</text>
  <text start="1464.11" dur="4.1">to see the like the</text>
  <text start="1466.15" dur="4.89">essence in people in their picture and</text>
  <text start="1468.21" dur="5.53">feel who they are coming through and</text>
  <text start="1471.04" dur="4.56">then be able to recognize it when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1473.74" dur="5.1">in front of you in the audition room and</text>
  <text start="1475.6" dur="5.4">then you know be able to to understand</text>
  <text start="1478.84" dur="4.86">which what talent is and what you have</text>
  <text start="1481" dur="6.45">in front of you that&amp;#39;s the combination</text>
  <text start="1483.7" dur="5.97">of me bringing him these this</text>
  <text start="1487.45" dur="5.04">information or these creatives or these</text>
  <text start="1489.67" dur="5.25">choices and knowing what he is I have</text>
  <text start="1492.49" dur="4.56">trust in his work what he can do with</text>
  <text start="1494.92" dur="4.68">that and how we can create something</text>
  <text start="1497.05" dur="5.19">that is that is powerful and impactful</text>
  <text start="1499.6" dur="5.69">both in the story and also the people</text>
  <text start="1502.24" dur="5.82">that are portraying the story so it&amp;#39;s um</text>
  <text start="1505.29" dur="5.83">when we go out and look for we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1508.06" dur="5.58">clear we tell the actors this is what</text>
  <text start="1511.12" dur="6.36">the the story is about this is what your</text>
  <text start="1513.64" dur="6.84">character is we don&amp;#39;t tell them about</text>
  <text start="1517.48" dur="5.61">all of the you know like I didn&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="1520.48" dur="5.04">my axe say okay watch the interview of</text>
  <text start="1523.09" dur="5.25">Ronald Bernard read the Franklin scandal</text>
  <text start="1525.52" dur="6.36">or yeah that&amp;#39;s not their job their job</text>
  <text start="1528.34" dur="6.33">is to to be an artist to explore their</text>
  <text start="1531.88" dur="4.98">emotions to be in a space where we just</text>
  <text start="1534.67" dur="5.1">need to capture that not in an</text>
  <text start="1536.86" dur="6.06">exploitive way but in a very careful</text>
  <text start="1539.77" dur="5.4">professional and caring way that we just</text>
  <text start="1542.92" dur="4.98">need them to focus on their performances</text>
  <text start="1545.17" dur="4.47">and we&amp;#39;ll take care of storytelling part</text>
  <text start="1547.9" dur="3.27">of it and that&amp;#39;s what we did across the</text>
  <text start="1549.64" dur="3.72">board with all of our actors a lot of</text>
  <text start="1551.17" dur="4.02">knew about this problem but we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1553.36" dur="4.35">have like meetings on this and talking</text>
  <text start="1555.19" dur="5.58">about like what it what you should be</text>
  <text start="1557.71" dur="5.07">thinking about in this world are diving</text>
  <text start="1560.77" dur="3.96">into it in reality what we needed them</text>
  <text start="1562.78" dur="4.92">to do is we had done all that in our</text>
  <text start="1564.73" dur="6.6">storytelling and we just needed them to</text>
  <text start="1567.7" dur="6.27">get in that creative space and feel they</text>
  <text start="1571.33" dur="5.73">were they it was what was working what</text>
  <text start="1573.97" dur="5.55">wasn&amp;#39;t working I&amp;#39;ve heard you say in a</text>
  <text start="1577.06" dur="5.37">couple of other interviews that um the</text>
  <text start="1579.52" dur="4.83">cast just really made this what it was</text>
  <text start="1582.43" dur="3.6">the way they gelled together what do you</text>
  <text start="1584.35" dur="5.33">mean when you say something like that</text>
  <text start="1586.03" dur="6.42">how does that how does that help a movie</text>
  <text start="1589.68" dur="5.77">when people come together and they</text>
  <text start="1592.45" dur="7.02">respect each other and minimum you get</text>
  <text start="1595.45" dur="7.53">great results when people come together</text>
  <text start="1599.47" dur="6.329">and they love each other you you have</text>
  <text start="1602.98" dur="6.179">gold and what I mean by that is you you</text>
  <text start="1605.799" dur="5.461">don&amp;#39;t know you can&amp;#39;t predict it but what</text>
  <text start="1609.159" dur="4.711">I&amp;#39;ve learned is is that it comes from</text>
  <text start="1611.26" dur="5.25">within the people creating the content</text>
  <text start="1613.87" dur="6">that attract those kinds of people and</text>
  <text start="1616.51" dur="8.539">so what happened on set was after the</text>
  <text start="1619.87" dur="8.429">first day they all bonded and were a</text>
  <text start="1625.049" dur="5.591">cohesive unit not just in their work but</text>
  <text start="1628.299" dur="3.211">in their own personal relationships with</text>
  <text start="1630.64" dur="4.59">one another</text>
  <text start="1631.51" dur="6.45">there was a real respect in care for</text>
  <text start="1635.23" dur="5.4">each others both creative abilities as</text>
  <text start="1637.96" dur="4.11">well as who they were as people and that</text>
  <text start="1640.63" dur="3.96">was a really beautiful thing to watch</text>
  <text start="1642.07" dur="4.83">happen that&amp;#39;s one of the the joys of</text>
  <text start="1644.59" dur="6.839">being a producer at least from from my</text>
  <text start="1646.9" dur="7.62">my perspective so this it just seems</text>
  <text start="1651.429" dur="4.951">like you know you you both knew sort of</text>
  <text start="1654.52" dur="4.529">what you wanted to accomplish with this</text>
  <text start="1656.38" dur="4.59">story and bringing awareness to this</text>
  <text start="1659.049" dur="4.171">issue and trying to educate people on</text>
  <text start="1660.97" dur="7.11">what it is in a in a different sort of a</text>
  <text start="1663.22" dur="8.819">way that&amp;#39;s not so you know Ted Gunderson</text>
  <text start="1668.08" dur="5.61">lecture right that&amp;#39;s you know what I</text>
  <text start="1672.039" dur="4.911">mean so it&amp;#39;s just a different way to</text>
  <text start="1673.69" dur="5.94">start getting people to understand this</text>
  <text start="1676.95" dur="5.29">and and you know that the film doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1679.63" dur="5.7">tell this whole story in a way that you</text>
  <text start="1682.24" dur="5.01">you know you really even it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1685.33" dur="5.01">like an introduction but it&amp;#39;s enough of</text>
  <text start="1687.25" dur="5.34">an introduction that you&amp;#39;re like you</text>
  <text start="1690.34" dur="7.17">know III haven&amp;#39;t seen it I can say that</text>
  <text start="1692.59" dur="6.54">so um what what did you let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="1697.51" dur="2.85">a little bit about you know as you went</text>
  <text start="1699.13" dur="2.52">through you film the movie now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1700.36" dur="3.36">ready you&amp;#39;re learning you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1701.65" dur="4.83">passionate about this who did you reach</text>
  <text start="1703.72" dur="5.25">out to and why and you know what were</text>
  <text start="1706.48" dur="4.77">you hoping for and what did you learn</text>
  <text start="1708.97" dur="3.99">and and and like you know this has been</text>
  <text start="1711.25" dur="3.63">a journey and I want to kind of get that</text>
  <text start="1712.96" dur="4.53">out from you there have been some</text>
  <text start="1714.88" dur="5.52">absolutely stunning things that have</text>
  <text start="1717.49" dur="4.679">happened with this film since sit even</text>
  <text start="1720.4" dur="6.44">since its premiere so let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="1722.169" dur="7.801">some of that stuff mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1726.84" dur="6.969">well let&amp;#39;s take it on a more personal</text>
  <text start="1729.97" dur="6.99">level like the journey right I think</text>
  <text start="1733.809" dur="5.581">that in reality where this is leading me</text>
  <text start="1736.96" dur="4.02">personally at anger to is a spiritual</text>
  <text start="1739.39" dur="2.22">one that&amp;#39;s not necessarily tied to</text>
  <text start="1740.98" dur="4.53">religion</text>
  <text start="1741.61" dur="5.789">it&amp;#39;s a spiritual one about who we are as</text>
  <text start="1745.51" dur="4.83">beings on this earth in this reality</text>
  <text start="1747.399" dur="6.811">that we live in and using our</text>
  <text start="1750.34" dur="7.86">imaginations as as a vehicle to change</text>
  <text start="1754.21" dur="6.27">things not waiting on the people in</text>
  <text start="1758.2" dur="4.68">power to do something about it but for</text>
  <text start="1760.48" dur="4.829">people to take control of their own</text>
  <text start="1762.88" dur="6.09">lives and their and assess the situation</text>
  <text start="1765.309" dur="6.031">around them as to what kind of life do</text>
  <text start="1768.97" dur="5.069">you want to live and who you want to</text>
  <text start="1771.34" dur="6.3">share that life with I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1774.039" dur="8.671">getting into a at least for me at this</text>
  <text start="1777.64" dur="7.919">stage in my life I have let go of so</text>
  <text start="1782.71" dur="5.939">many things that I believed in and held</text>
  <text start="1785.559" dur="8.671">on to and not so much the institutions</text>
  <text start="1788.649" dur="8.071">of politics it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going no human</text>
  <text start="1794.23" dur="4.919">beings in spite of all of the the</text>
  <text start="1796.72" dur="5.569">problems like if you look at satanic</text>
  <text start="1799.149" dur="9.03">ritual abuse survivors just for for one</text>
  <text start="1802.289" dur="10.181">I saw one lady Christie Allen who went</text>
  <text start="1808.179" dur="8.431">through horrific abuse from the Mormon</text>
  <text start="1812.47" dur="6.72">Church right her bishop or whomever had</text>
  <text start="1816.61" dur="4.89">abused her so badly but Tracy the thing</text>
  <text start="1819.19" dur="5.64">that that was so inspiring about her</text>
  <text start="1821.5" dur="6.419">testimony was not all of the horrific</text>
  <text start="1824.83" dur="5.849">things that she had been through but it</text>
  <text start="1827.919" dur="5.73">had been that all deep down inside in</text>
  <text start="1830.679" dur="6.201">her life she wanted to love she wanted</text>
  <text start="1833.649" dur="5.52">to find someone to love and she did in</text>
  <text start="1836.88" dur="4.72">spite of all of what she had been</text>
  <text start="1839.169" dur="5.88">through which tells you very clearly</text>
  <text start="1841.6" dur="6.449">what the power of human beings is the</text>
  <text start="1845.049" dur="6.99">power of human beings when you you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1848.049" dur="6.831">mother you see that baby in front of you</text>
  <text start="1852.039" dur="6.6">and you see those children playing</text>
  <text start="1854.88" dur="6.1">that&amp;#39;s the pre programming the pre the</text>

  <text start="1860.98" dur="4.11">comes when they&amp;#39;re born into this world</text>

  <text start="1865.09" dur="5.25">and nurturing to help it grow so they</text>
  <text start="1867.37" dur="5.73">become rational creative loving natives</text>
  <text start="1870.34" dur="4.289">human beings that don&amp;#39;t feel like there</text>
  <text start="1873.1" dur="3.029">is a burden and a threat and that</text>
  <text start="1874.629" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re worthless and they have to prove</text>
  <text start="1876.129" dur="6.241">themselves or find themselves in</text>
  <text start="1878.62" dur="5.669">material wealth or or social status or</text>
  <text start="1882.37" dur="4.2">accomplishments and achievements alone</text>
  <text start="1884.289" dur="4.071">that they&amp;#39;re worth as a human being and</text>
  <text start="1886.57" dur="5.939">their honest expression of that is</text>
  <text start="1888.36" dur="7.899">enough it&amp;#39;s enough this world this</text>
  <text start="1892.509" dur="6.51">reality outside does not reinforce that</text>
  <text start="1896.259" dur="5.461">it does not nurture that it does not it</text>
  <text start="1899.019" dur="5.581">is not one of anything that is nurturing</text>
  <text start="1901.72" dur="5.64">of the soul in any which way so the</text>
  <text start="1904.6" dur="7.049">journey to make this film and the</text>
  <text start="1907.36" dur="7.139">creative team behind it inspired this to</text>
  <text start="1911.649" dur="6.66">come out through both of us and it was</text>
  <text start="1914.499" dur="6">and it manifested and evolved in the</text>
  <text start="1918.309" dur="5.011">production and in the post production</text>
  <text start="1920.499" dur="4.831">when we were trying to find the ending</text>
  <text start="1923.32" dur="3.809">when we were trying to figure out what</text>
  <text start="1925.33" dur="4.65">it is that&amp;#39;s coming out of us the</text>
  <text start="1927.129" dur="7.201">feeling inside that was coming out of us</text>
  <text start="1929.98" dur="6.84">which is to say the child in you the</text>
  <text start="1934.33" dur="5.219">child inside of each and every one of us</text>
  <text start="1936.82" dur="5.64">is the one that we have to love first</text>
  <text start="1939.549" dur="4.74">and that commitment to loving that child</text>
  <text start="1942.46" dur="4.53">in you that has been silenced that has</text>
  <text start="1944.289" dur="5.1">been muted that&amp;#39;s been damaged is not</text>
  <text start="1946.99" dur="5.34">the real child that&amp;#39;s being expressed</text>
  <text start="1949.389" dur="5.461">today and when you nurture that and when</text>
  <text start="1952.33" dur="7.14">you love that child you could then go</text>
  <text start="1954.85" dur="8.01">forward with no fear in any which way to</text>
  <text start="1959.47" dur="6.12">then become a person who is rational and</text>
  <text start="1962.86" dur="6.059">creative and loving and will stand up</text>
  <text start="1965.59" dur="5.73">for that child and protect that child no</text>
  <text start="1968.919" dur="5.7">matter what it is not a choice at that</text>
  <text start="1971.32" dur="6.12">point we have a mammal we have a mammal</text>
  <text start="1974.619" dur="6.121">human brain a loving mammal human brain</text>
  <text start="1977.44" dur="6.449">and there&amp;#39;s a reptile brain and the</text>
  <text start="1980.74" dur="4.23">reptile brain is eating your own eating</text>
  <text start="1983.889" dur="4.23">your own kind</text>
  <text start="1984.97" dur="6.35">the loving mammal brain is the human in</text>
  <text start="1988.119" dur="6.39">all of us that has this enormous power</text>
  <text start="1991.32" dur="5.819">to connect with each other to care for</text>
  <text start="1994.509" dur="3.871">one of each other to love one another</text>
  <text start="1997.139" dur="3.791">effort</text>
  <text start="1998.38" dur="5.76">sleeeeep and this is what I have found</text>
  <text start="2000.93" dur="4.92">over the last 80 years and before but</text>
  <text start="2004.14" dur="3.93">over the last 80 years they keep telling</text>
  <text start="2005.85" dur="4.14">you don&amp;#39;t have the power to do they</text>
  <text start="2008.07" dur="2.52">distract you from it they keep you away</text>
  <text start="2009.99" dur="4.83">from it</text>
  <text start="2010.59" dur="7.41">so this journey to make this movie was</text>
  <text start="2014.82" dur="6.18">the promise to the child that I will</text>
  <text start="2018" dur="6.5">help you I will protect you I will</text>
  <text start="2021" dur="7.29">defend you against danger and harm and</text>
  <text start="2024.5" dur="6.64">it also goes back to child abuse which</text>
  <text start="2028.29" dur="5.97">is the root my belief is after this</text>
  <text start="2031.14" dur="5.85">experience child abuse not money not</text>
  <text start="2034.26" dur="6.24">power child abuse is the root of all</text>
  <text start="2036.99" dur="5.91">evil in the world it is absolutely true</text>
  <text start="2040.5" dur="5.09">if you have somebody who is loved by</text>
  <text start="2042.9" dur="5.82">their parents their mother and father</text>
  <text start="2045.59" dur="4.569">they don&amp;#39;t desire to hurt somebody they</text>
  <text start="2048.72" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t desire you gave them a million</text>
  <text start="2050.159" dur="7.801">dollars ask those people what they would</text>
  <text start="2052.95" dur="7.86">do pay off my bills help my mom care for</text>
  <text start="2057.96" dur="4.98">my aunt or uncle or my grandmother who</text>
  <text start="2060.81" dur="4.349">is sick and dying or give them a</text>
  <text start="2062.94" dur="4.229">vacation they&amp;#39;re not sitting there</text>
  <text start="2065.159" dur="3.48">thinking about the construct of what</text>
  <text start="2067.169" dur="3.271">they could do with all that power and</text>
  <text start="2068.639" dur="4.04">have control over people and and</text>
  <text start="2070.44" dur="6.86">crushing them and taking from them</text>
  <text start="2072.679" dur="8.371">that&amp;#39;s a very small group of people so</text>
  <text start="2077.3" dur="6.76">that is the journey through our work</text>
  <text start="2081.05" dur="6.04">that is the journey through creating</text>
  <text start="2084.06" dur="4.74">this that has awoken us and gives us</text>
  <text start="2087.09" dur="5.37">strength to keep fighting and going</text>
  <text start="2088.8" dur="6.599">further to go to do a sequel to expose</text>
  <text start="2092.46" dur="6.33">the global networks to talk about more</text>
  <text start="2095.399" dur="6.241">honestly and rationally the solutions in</text>

  <text start="2106.23" dur="5.46">problem for you each of us has something</text>
  <text start="2109.23" dur="4.17">that we can create our imagination and I</text>
  <text start="2111.69" dur="4.05">will just tell you this I&amp;#39;m being a</text>
  <text start="2113.4" dur="3.9">little bit preachy here I understand but</text>
  <text start="2115.74" dur="6.72">I want people to understand this is the</text>

  <text start="2161.01" dur="8.789">every one of us is trying to find that</text>
  <text start="2163.799" dur="8.04">something somehow you had a bunch of I</text>
  <text start="2169.799" dur="3.721">was supposed to come out for the the</text>

  <text start="2253.41" dur="2.73">things that you were talking about I</text>
  <text start="2254.7" dur="4.74">didn&amp;#39;t understand but I just kept</text>
  <text start="2256.14" dur="6.24">listening and if it had not been for</text>
  <text start="2259.44" dur="4.25">people like you and the honey bee and</text>
  <text start="2262.38" dur="3.53">Hague</text>
  <text start="2263.69" dur="5.01">and the others that we discovered along</text>
  <text start="2265.91" dur="3.42">the way this film would not have</text>
  <text start="2268.7" dur="3.51">happened</text>
  <text start="2269.33" dur="6.93">Wow I can tell you that for sure Wow</text>
  <text start="2272.21" dur="7.2">because you and Liz croakin and Ann</text>
  <text start="2276.26" dur="5.73">honeybee and I&amp;#39;m just trying to phew</text>
  <text start="2279.41" dur="6.03">Craig Sawyer and all these different</text>
  <text start="2281.99" dur="6.75">people that expressed different opinions</text>
  <text start="2285.44" dur="4.83">about things politically that I whether</text>
  <text start="2288.74" dur="3.69">I agreed with it or not I was willing to</text>
  <text start="2290.27" dur="3.9">entertain and listen but when they</text>
  <text start="2292.43" dur="5.55">started talking about the human</text>
  <text start="2294.17" dur="5.7">trafficking the Podesta emails and the</text>
  <text start="2297.98" dur="2.88">and the common ping-pong and all</text>
  <text start="2299.87" dur="3.18">everything</text>
  <text start="2300.86" dur="4.83">it didn&amp;#39;t matter at that point because</text>
  <text start="2303.05" dur="4.2">what what mattered was the sincerity and</text>
  <text start="2305.69" dur="4.2">the authenticity that was coming through</text>
  <text start="2307.25" dur="5.1">with you and I realized that what</text>
  <text start="2309.89" dur="5.82">everybody was doing at this point was</text>
  <text start="2312.35" dur="6.36">they were putting their reputations not</text>
  <text start="2315.71" dur="5.25">for the grandiose part of it they were</text>
  <text start="2318.71" dur="5.4">putting their real heart into it with</text>
  <text start="2320.96" dur="5.19">humility saying I don&amp;#39;t know all the</text>
  <text start="2324.11" dur="3.27">answers but we were trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="2326.15" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;re trying to learn we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2327.38" dur="4.02">share together in this process so that</text>
  <text start="2329.27" dur="4.29">we can get some answers and maybe start</text>
  <text start="2331.4" dur="5.4">figuring out how we can demand change</text>
  <text start="2333.56" dur="7.77">right or or put pressure on these people</text>
  <text start="2336.8" dur="6.86">to say hey this is wrong there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2341.33" dur="5.49">hard line that needs to be drawn here</text>
  <text start="2343.66" dur="6.7">you can&amp;#39;t have people who are elected</text>
  <text start="2346.82" dur="6.36">officials in positions of power having</text>
  <text start="2350.36" dur="5.88">power over the law having power over</text>

  <text start="2702.89" dur="7.77">saw for the very first time a news story</text>
  <text start="2708.2" dur="4.62">just a news story about a</text>
  <text start="2710.66" dur="4.89">twelve-year-old girl and she told me it</text>
  <text start="2712.82" dur="4.35">made me sick to my stomach and this is</text>
  <text start="2715.55" dur="4.56">not even the really heavy stuff right</text>
  <text start="2717.17" dur="10.74">this is just the prostitution of kids</text>
  <text start="2720.11" dur="13.14">yeah so so she said you know we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2727.91" dur="7.35">a program that when I walked into that</text>
  <text start="2733.25" dur="3.48">office I said okay you want to do</text>
  <text start="2735.26" dur="2.94">something about human trafficking if</text>
  <text start="2736.73" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re gonna do it we&amp;#39;re not gonna do it</text>
  <text start="2738.2" dur="4.65">light touch we&amp;#39;re gonna go all in on it</text>
  <text start="2740" dur="6.99">so what they did is they came up with a</text>
  <text start="2742.85" dur="7.71">training program to instruct all of</text>
  <text start="2746.99" dur="7.86">their members from the franchise owners</text>
  <text start="2750.56" dur="8.07">the managers all the way down to the</text>
  <text start="2754.85" dur="5.55">hotel staff the cleaning staff to train</text>
  <text start="2758.63" dur="3.87">them on detecting the signs of human</text>
  <text start="2760.4" dur="4.95">trafficking what it looks like how</text>
  <text start="2762.5" dur="4.23">people behave how people children behave</text>
  <text start="2765.35" dur="2.67">some of the exhibit</text>
  <text start="2766.73" dur="2.79">you know how they exhibit behavior</text>
  <text start="2768.02" dur="3.15">things you might see in the room</text>
  <text start="2769.52" dur="4.2">whatever it is it just went down an</text>
  <text start="2771.17" dur="5.01">entire list how to document it and how</text>
  <text start="2773.72" dur="4.32">to report it to law enforcement and this</text>
  <text start="2776.18" dur="5.46">is part of if you go to their website</text>
  <text start="2778.04" dur="6.3">today a hos website you will see on</text>
  <text start="2781.64" dur="5.94">there it is one of the top five areas</text>
  <text start="2784.34" dur="7.77">that is all about what they&amp;#39;re promoting</text>
  <text start="2787.58" dur="6.42">through their business and the way I</text>
  <text start="2792.11" dur="3.39">kind of look at it is this it&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="2794" dur="6.359">way we look at organic</text>
  <text start="2795.5" dur="8.04">or you know poisonous you know poison</text>
  <text start="2800.359" dur="5.821">free containers and all those things</text>
  <text start="2803.54" dur="5.579">that are safer for us we buy those</text>
  <text start="2806.18" dur="5.64">products we support them because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2809.119" dur="5.161">doing things that are counter to what</text>
  <text start="2811.82" dur="4.17">major corporations are doing we want to</text>
  <text start="2814.28" dur="5.85">support them with our dollars and our</text>
  <text start="2815.99" dur="6.03">money whatever way we can and so what I</text>
  <text start="2820.13" dur="5.61">did was I told them I said we&amp;#39;d love to</text>
  <text start="2822.02" dur="5.13">have you come out and they ended up</text>
  <text start="2825.74" dur="3.15">sending I think 10 people out there</text>
  <text start="2827.15" dur="4.41">including the chairman and his wife it</text>
  <text start="2828.89" dur="4.68">was big on this issue and now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2831.56" dur="4.289">we&amp;#39;ve started talking with them about</text>
  <text start="2833.57" dur="4.85">how we can stream this movie within</text>
  <text start="2835.849" dur="5.131">their network of 18,000 people and</text>
  <text start="2838.42" dur="4.929">incentivize it and make an event out of</text>
  <text start="2840.98" dur="4.83">it and maybe even get local law law</text>
  <text start="2843.349" dur="3.781">enforcement or law Baker&amp;#39;s that they</text>
  <text start="2845.81" dur="3.299">have access to because they&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="2847.13" dur="4.38">working with the DHS blue campaign</text>
  <text start="2849.109" dur="4.711">mm-hmm so they have resources in</text>
  <text start="2851.51" dur="5">Washington that they can leverage in</text>
  <text start="2853.82" dur="5.97">order to get more eyes on this issue and</text>
  <text start="2856.51" dur="6.849">I think this is just one of many that</text>
  <text start="2859.79" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re going to explore because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2863.359" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s a movie and it&amp;#39;s different and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2865.28" dur="4.38">unique it&amp;#39;s not a documentary it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2867.619" dur="6.511">it&amp;#39;s a feature film yep and like you</text>
  <text start="2869.66" dur="5.64">said it&amp;#39;s not facts and information</text>
  <text start="2874.13" dur="2.76">coming at you which i think is very</text>
  <text start="2875.3" dur="3.72">valuable and important for a lot of</text>
  <text start="2876.89" dur="4.32">people to understand the scope and the</text>
  <text start="2879.02" dur="5.55">gravity of things but in this case what</text>
  <text start="2881.21" dur="6.149">it does is it&amp;#39;s a supernatural feature</text>
  <text start="2884.57" dur="4.98">film that you don&amp;#39;t have to know</text>
  <text start="2887.359" dur="4.861">anything about human trafficking to both</text>
  <text start="2889.55" dur="4.47">enjoy and if you do you&amp;#39;ll know more but</text>
  <text start="2892.22" dur="3.389">you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll see you&amp;#39;ll check</text>
  <text start="2894.02" dur="4.05">all the boxes for you of all the things</text>
  <text start="2895.609" dur="4.641">you know but it&amp;#39;s really the message for</text>
  <text start="2898.07" dur="6.45">them and when we were at the premiere</text>
  <text start="2900.25" dur="7.06">not only did the 8 the whole people come</text>
  <text start="2904.52" dur="5.43">out and say my god this was like they</text>
  <text start="2907.31" dur="4.5">saw it as a success but there were women</text>
  <text start="2909.95" dur="4.05">and people who didn&amp;#39;t know anything</text>
  <text start="2911.81" dur="5.46">about this coming up to her actors and</text>
  <text start="2914" dur="4.92">tears saying how much they were moved by</text>
  <text start="2917.27" dur="4.28">their performances they couldn&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="2918.92" dur="6.56">that this was being done to children and</text>
  <text start="2921.55" dur="7.03">they were just there was just such a</text>
  <text start="2925.48" dur="3.79">spirit of goodwill that was coming</text>
  <text start="2928.58" dur="2.85">through</text>
  <text start="2929.27" dur="5.25">the crowd both before but definitely</text>
  <text start="2931.43" dur="4.59">after yeah people wanted to talk they</text>
  <text start="2934.52" dur="3.42">wanted to hang out they wanted to stick</text>
  <text start="2936.02" dur="5.4">around they were still thinking about</text>
  <text start="2937.94" dur="7.01">what they had just seen there was an</text>
  <text start="2941.42" dur="7.11">emotional connection to that message and</text>
  <text start="2944.95" dur="5.53">it was very strong and so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2948.53" dur="3.87">going to do now is we&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="2950.48" dur="3.54">this is a grassroots I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="2952.4" dur="4.29">parlaying this into it but this is a</text>
  <text start="2954.02" dur="5.31">grassroots movement it&amp;#39;s the only way to</text>
  <text start="2956.69" dur="4.56">do it it&amp;#39;s like me waiting on Hollywood</text>
  <text start="2959.33" dur="3.48">for a distributor to come in and say oh</text>
  <text start="2961.25" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re gonna you know here&amp;#39;s the check</text>
  <text start="2962.81" dur="3.48">and we&amp;#39;re gonna get it out to everybody</text>
  <text start="2964.43" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s not to happen that way I wanted it</text>
  <text start="2966.29" dur="5.37">to but it the realities are are what</text>
  <text start="2969.02" dur="4.62">they are but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2971.66" dur="4.02">about talking to people like you why I</text>
  <text start="2973.64" dur="3.81">reached out to you I had no idea this is</text>
  <text start="2975.68" dur="3.87">where we would be right now I&amp;#39;d hoped</text>
  <text start="2977.45" dur="4.41">that maybe you would like the movie</text>
  <text start="2979.55" dur="3.66">maybe we would be able to talk about it</text>
  <text start="2981.86" dur="3.18">maybe we&amp;#39;d be able to get it out to your</text>
  <text start="2983.21" dur="4.17">audience and and tell them what was</text>
  <text start="2985.04" dur="5.61">going on and share the link but more</text>
  <text start="2987.38" dur="5.19">importantly is to raise the dialogue</text>
  <text start="2990.65" dur="4.62">raise the profile of this issue through</text>
  <text start="2992.57" dur="5.64">another medium that allows people to</text>
  <text start="2995.27" dur="5.46">come into the issue like we did when we</text>
  <text start="2998.21" dur="5.09">first learned about it and start looking</text>
  <text start="3000.73" dur="5.58">elsewhere looking for more information</text>
  <text start="3003.3" dur="6.25">talking to others seeking out you know</text>
  <text start="3006.31" dur="5.04">Traci beans or the honey bee on YouTube</text>
  <text start="3009.55" dur="4.08">or going to the Hegeman report or</text>
  <text start="3011.35" dur="5.91">reading on disobedient media traffic</text>
  <text start="3013.63" dur="6.3">networks you know just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3017.26" dur="6.57">designed to be a conversation starter</text>
  <text start="3019.93" dur="5.88">for the uninitiated for certain and for</text>
  <text start="3023.83" dur="4.5">people like you and me who know about it</text>
  <text start="3025.81" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s definitely reinforces all of the</text>
  <text start="3028.33" dur="4.53">things that we believe it yeah I will</text>
  <text start="3030.58" dur="3.66">add a point to that like um you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3032.86" dur="3.87">not obviously not giving anything away</text>
  <text start="3034.24" dur="3.87">but watching it knowing everything that</text>
  <text start="3036.73" dur="4.41">I know from all the research I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="3038.11" dur="7.53">and everything I was like I was craving</text>
  <text start="3041.14" dur="7.59">a little bit more fact-based but you</text>
  <text start="3045.64" dur="5.31">know me that&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just how I am I</text>
  <text start="3048.73" dur="4.62">think for anybody even people who know</text>
  <text start="3050.95" dur="6.03">about this issue it is it is it is</text>
  <text start="3053.35" dur="6.51">perfectly poised for people to want to</text>
  <text start="3056.98" dur="4.35">know more even as you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3059.86" dur="2.88">when you watch a ghost story it&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="3061.33" dur="2.85">to watch it but it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3062.74" dur="3.27">enthralled by it because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3064.18" dur="4.68">unknown sort of a thing this is is</text>
  <text start="3066.01" dur="7.08">powerful in so many different ways the</text>
  <text start="3068.86" dur="6.78">ending was just as I don&amp;#39;t want to as</text>
  <text start="3073.09" dur="4.5">simple as it was it was one of the most</text>
  <text start="3075.64" dur="4.2">powerful scenes in the entire movie for</text>
  <text start="3077.59" dur="4.47">me personally and I think that speaks to</text>
  <text start="3079.84" dur="4.92">how the movie was executed it was just</text>
  <text start="3082.06" dur="5.04">done it was well done and I know there</text>
