  <text start="515.279" dur="6.45">involved in money laundering and all of</text>
  <text start="517.649" dur="6">that and why the jurisdiction in</text>
  <text start="521.729" dur="5.521">Virginia is correct because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.649" dur="6">suing in Virginia not DC so they keep</text>

  <text start="529.649" dur="5.31">Devon Nunez this history was and all of</text>
  <text start="532.019" dur="5.401">that stuff and then they go in to what</text>
  <text start="534.959" dur="5.221">happened and how fusion GPS literal</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="6.96">literally targeted Devon Nunez after he</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="6.659">began to exposed he after he began to</text>
  <text start="544.38" dur="3.959">expose what was going on and somebody</text>
  <text start="546.839" dur="2.821">just asked me doesn&amp;#39;t it have to be</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="4.171">filed if there is a case number</text>
  <text start="549.66" dur="6.119">and yes this lawsuit here the one I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="552.51" dur="6.24">reading from is is filed this lawsuit is</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="4.591">filed the one that he had originally</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="5.07">talked about months and months and</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="5.13">months ago I can&amp;#39;t find anywhere against</text>
  <text start="563.82" dur="5.37">Liz Mayer I can&amp;#39;t find it was never</text>
  <text start="565.5" dur="5.69">filed so what I read in here I learned a</text>
  <text start="569.19" dur="5.81">couple things that were new outside</text>
  <text start="571.19" dur="7.62">of what we already know he goes through</text>
  <text start="575" dur="6.3">in the in the in the complaint some</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="4.29">details of the other folks that work at</text>
  <text start="581.3" dur="4.14">fusion GPS and what they were involved</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="5.79">in and the money that came in from other</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="6.9">democrat or leftist progressive entities</text>
  <text start="588.89" dur="5.52">including one that is tied to George</text>
  <text start="592.34" dur="4.11">Soros but the biggest thing that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.41" dur="3.87">talking about here is outside of what we</text>
  <text start="596.45" dur="7.8">all already know about Spygate which is</text>
  <text start="598.28" dur="8.07">basic in here and perkins coie he says</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="5.91">what they did they basically worked in</text>
  <text start="606.35" dur="6.27">tandem after he began exposing this in</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="3.51">his official capacity as the chairman of</text>

  <text start="613.67" dur="6.03">Intelligence they went after him with</text>
  <text start="615.95" dur="5.82">ethics complaints and if you remember he</text>
  <text start="619.7" dur="5.25">actually had a step aside for a little</text>
  <text start="621.77" dur="6.87">bit as they investigated some ethics</text>
  <text start="624.95" dur="5.37">complaint against him and the one of the</text>

  <text start="1559.89" dur="8.79">there are awesome people that are just</text>
  <text start="1561.24" dur="10.89">ribbing me about this okay so this goes</text>

  <text start="1572.13" dur="5.94">know 115 116 maybe even more it talks</text>
  <text start="1575.67" dur="6.09">about this investigation that started in</text>
  <text start="1578.07" dur="6.09">January of 2016 way before the mid-year</text>
  <text start="1581.76" dur="6.21">exam was over way before Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="1584.16" dur="6.06">was president and the reason why this</text>
  <text start="1587.97" dur="4.82">committee was allowed to investigate</text>
  <text start="1590.22" dur="6">this is because they are in charge of</text>
  <text start="1592.79" dur="4.18">oversight of cybersecurity and so it was</text>
  <text start="1596.22" dur="2.91">of crucial</text>
  <text start="1596.97" dur="4.35">importance to them who accessed the</text>
  <text start="1599.13" dur="4.14">server so in here even though the</text>
  <text start="1601.32" dur="5.7">exhibit excuse me even though the</text>
  <text start="1603.27" dur="8.94">exhibits were not included with this for</text>
  <text start="1607.02" dur="6.84">your release they go they go through I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1612.21" dur="3.3">gonna get the hiccups in a middle in the</text>
  <text start="1613.86" dur="4.89">middle of a live stream they go through</text>
  <text start="1615.51" dur="6.33">and they talk about how Platte River</text>
  <text start="1618.75" dur="4.89">networks stonewalled them to the point</text>
  <text start="1621.84" dur="4.53">where they wrote this letter asking for</text>
  <text start="1623.64" dur="4.11">a criminal referral or sending a</text>
  <text start="1626.37" dur="4.46">criminal referral to the Attorney</text>
  <text start="1627.75" dur="5.909">General who did nothing really annoying</text>
  <text start="1630.83" dur="8.41">really annoying because this is blatant</text>
  <text start="1633.659" dur="8.931">and it goes through here how dado which</text>
  <text start="1639.24" dur="6.54">was the data store like the backup</text>
  <text start="1642.59" dur="5.829">provider was telling Platte River</text>
  <text start="1645.78" dur="5.389">networks about the insecurity and the</text>
  <text start="1648.419" dur="5.401">possibility that they could be breached</text>
  <text start="1651.169" dur="4.721">because the the level of security that</text>
  <text start="1653.82" dur="3.33">was available on their drives was not</text>
  <text start="1655.89" dur="3.87">the same as what would have been needed</text>
  <text start="1657.15" dur="6.54">in this situation and competi Paul can</text>
  <text start="1659.76" dur="6.96">betta ignored the ignored the warning</text>
  <text start="1663.69" dur="5.64">the warnings so the first couple pages</text>
  <text start="1666.72" dur="4.23">go through why it is that they have</text>
  <text start="1669.33" dur="2.16">jurisdiction to look into this in the</text>
  <text start="1670.95" dur="3.81">first place</text>
  <text start="1671.49" dur="5.939">they had subpoenas they had legal</text>
  <text start="1674.76" dur="4.62">subpoenas they had every powerful thing</text>
  <text start="1677.429" dur="4.651">that they had in their committee was was</text>
  <text start="1679.38" dur="4.529">ignored by Platte River networks and the</text>
  <text start="1682.08" dur="4.2">only reason why that one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="1683.909" dur="5.01">why they were able to prove that Platte</text>
  <text start="1686.28" dur="4.59">River networks was ignoring or like so</text>
  <text start="1688.919" dur="3.39">they did ask for a certain subset of</text>
  <text start="1690.87" dur="5.22">documents and Platte River networks</text>
  <text start="1692.309" dur="5.461">would would read that as one thing when</text>
  <text start="1696.09" dur="3.06">in actuality it was meant to be</text>
  <text start="1697.77" dur="3.93">something else and they would reply they</text>
  <text start="1699.15" dur="4.529">had no responsive records to to the</text>
  <text start="1701.7" dur="4.02">committee and then data would would</text>
  <text start="1703.679" dur="5.701">provide records to the committee that</text>
  <text start="1705.72" dur="5.85">proved that to be false so dado is a</text>
  <text start="1709.38" dur="3.51">backup company supplying that this</text>
  <text start="1711.57" dur="4.05">committee with the information they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1712.89" dur="5.669">looking for while this committee is</text>
  <text start="1715.62" dur="4.559">asking Platte River networks for that</text>
  <text start="1718.559" dur="3.36">same information Platt whatever networks</text>
  <text start="1720.179" dur="3.99">as the company that Paul competi worked</text>

  <text start="1899.47" dur="7.74">know it goes it goes on and on and on in</text>
  <text start="1901.48" dur="7.199">here and they kept trying to serve</text>
  <text start="1907.21" dur="3.48">subpoenas and they had to literally call</text>
  <text start="1908.679" dur="4.47">out the the u.s. marshals to be able to</text>

  <text start="1945.22" dur="7.74">and on and on really it does I read the</text>
  <text start="1948.309" dur="7.59">entire thing they go through what</text>
  <text start="1952.96" dur="5.699">authority they have to compel the things</text>
