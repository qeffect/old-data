  <text start="0.03" dur="6.42">good afternoon it is Monday February</text>
  <text start="2.34" dur="7.379">11th 2019 at 2:52 p.m. Eastern Time</text>
  <text start="6.45" dur="6.84">so last week I wrote an article about</text>
  <text start="9.719" dur="6.061">that summary Oh IG report and basically</text>
  <text start="13.29" dur="4.65">the summary oag report was released by</text>
  <text start="15.78" dur="5.669">Inspector General Michael Horowitz his</text>
  <text start="17.94" dur="6.9">office and it it basically summarized</text>
  <text start="21.449" dur="9.051">some unscrupulous activity that was</text>
  <text start="24.84" dur="9.42">going on within the within the within</text>
  <text start="30.5" dur="6.719">the intelligence community and behavior</text>
  <text start="34.26" dur="5.31">on behalf of some government</text>
  <text start="37.219" dur="5.261">subcontractors and it was very vague in</text>
  <text start="39.57" dur="7.86">its wording or confusing I should say</text>
  <text start="42.48" dur="7.68">and basically what it read was the OIG</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="5.879">found that as a result of conduct by two</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="7.2">current senior FBI officials and one</text>
  <text start="53.309" dur="6.871">retired FBI official the FBI contractor</text>
  <text start="57.36" dur="5.219">engaged in certain inherent governmental</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="4.1">activities and contravention of Federal</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="4.201">Acquisition regulations</text>
  <text start="64.28" dur="5.4">additionally the OIG found that these</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="5.519">three FBI officials did not adhere to</text>
  <text start="69.68" dur="5.53">Office of Management and Budget policy</text>
  <text start="72.299" dur="6.421">while managing the contractor further</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="6.03">the OIG found that the FBI contractor</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="5.52">failed to adhere to personal conflict of</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="5.58">interest rules under the far and I was</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="4.559">able to deduce after much research which</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="5.64">I outlined inside of this that the</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="5.851">contractor was likely Fuzion GPS and I</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="4.409">went on to cite some of Jeff Carlson&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="6.05">reporting about what happened with the</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="7.29">about queries that were being made and</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="7.029">and how all contractor access to the 702</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="5.64">database was shut down and then the</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="4.201">struck page text messages referenced</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="5.131">having to move from the Patriot Act to a</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="7.439">wire carrying current in order to obtain</text>
  <text start="114.93" dur="6.619">information I speculate strongly then</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="6.451">that fusion gps is actually a government</text>
  <text start="121.549" dur="6.011">contractor and I go into detail inside</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="3.54">of the article and I&amp;#39;ll link the video</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="5.94">that I did about this in the description</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="5.94">box below I also note that the light</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="5.7">Klee hood that this is fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="5.88">increases because there was a personal</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="4.95">conflict of interest indicated and we</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="5.67">know that Nellie or was the wife of</text>
  <text start="144.15" dur="4.58">Bruce or therefore making a you know</text>
  <text start="146.85" dur="5.34">Bruce aura at the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="6.79">that&amp;#39;s a very strong personal conflict</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="5.61">of interest especially if fusion GPS was</text>
  <text start="155.52" dur="6.6">the subcontractor who was conducting</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="8.7">inherent governmental activities in the</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="5.93">Far one of which is detailed or one of</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="2.82">which is counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="168.05" dur="5.439">investigations</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="5.58">so there&amp;#39;s your background now let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="173.489" dur="4.951">through why I have just found</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.32">information that even further supports</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="4.85">that assertion</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="7.769">I knew that on a Friday the 8th the</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="6.76">judge in the case of the gubarev versus</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="4.891">BuzzFeed the Gubarev versus BuzzFeed</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="4.56">case that was going on basically where</text>
  <text start="191.88" dur="6.12">one of the gentlemen who was implicated</text>
  <text start="194.61" dur="6.3">in the dossier was suing BuzzFeed for</text>
  <text start="198" dur="4.82">libel for publishing his name and</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="4.31">basically tainting his reputation and</text>
  <text start="202.82" dur="4.24">asserting that he was you know what</text>
  <text start="205.22" dur="4.15">basically because they published a</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="6.57">dossier that the dossier incorrectly</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="7.26">said that he was responsible for working</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="6.48">on behalf of Russia and basically was</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="6.27">responsible for hacking the DNC and he</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="5.78">wasn&amp;#39;t he sued BuzzFeed for publishing</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="5.45">that without verifying it and BuzzFeed</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="4.75">was involved in several lawsuits</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="4.66">surrounding this one of them overseas</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="6.03">one of them here in Florida one of them</text>
  <text start="233.01" dur="6.42">in Washington DC they subpoenaed the DNC</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="5.76">got squashed down there it was a big</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="5.46">long defamation libel suit that</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="5.07">basically just ended up being well not</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="7.74">just in December was ruled in on be in</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="9.66">favor of fee in favor of BuzzFeed so</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="7.26">BuzzFeed won Gubarev lost however the</text>
  <text start="257.16" dur="5.7">judge ruled that on February 8th which</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="4.709">was Friday there would be a whole slew</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="2.779">of documents released in the court</text>
  <text start="264.599" dur="3.831">really</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="6.27">from the court that were previously held</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="5.88">they did they released hundreds of pages</text>
  <text start="271.909" dur="5.401">of documents I read them all today</text>
  <text start="274.31" dur="4.59">lots of redactions and a lot of</text>
  <text start="277.31" dur="4.49">interesting little tidbits in there and</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="5.389">that led me to look at a couple of other</text>
  <text start="281.8" dur="5.169">lawsuits that were referenced inside</text>
  <text start="284.289" dur="4.271">regarding fusion GPS I hope everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.969" dur="4.081">following this is a little complicated</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="5.759">but when I started looking into the</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="5.25">fusion GPS lawsuits fusion GPS is Glenn</text>
  <text start="294.319" dur="4.5">Simpson the people who hired Christopher</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="4.589">steel and Orbis the people implicated</text>
  <text start="298.819" dur="4.261">here as being government contractors</text>
  <text start="300.889" dur="6">that were accessing the 702 database</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="7.859">incorrectly doing inherent governmental</text>
  <text start="306.889" dur="8.34">activities I found transcripts from the</text>
  <text start="310.939" dur="6.51">lawsuit that was brought into court to</text>
  <text start="315.229" dur="6.72">get their bank records which I</text>
  <text start="317.449" dur="5.791">referenced in this prior article so the</text>
  <text start="321.949" dur="3.411">house permanent Select Committee on</text>

  <text start="329.18" dur="4.709">bank records fusion GPS was fighting</text>
  <text start="332.029" dur="3.721">back hard didn&amp;#39;t want to give up their</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="4.861">bank records saying it was ridiculously</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="4.05">broad that it wasn&amp;#39;t relevant that you</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="2.61">know if they were looking for</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="3.119">information regarding payments</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.329">surrounding the dossier that they would</text>
  <text start="342.919" dur="3.87">gladly provide them in that limited</text>
  <text start="344.689" dur="3.991">scope and we didn&amp;#39;t have much</text>
  <text start="346.789" dur="4.261">information outside of that and and we</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="4.469">learned that those documents were that</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="5.039">the bank records were provided that the</text>
  <text start="353.149" dur="4.77">case was ruled and they needed to rough</text>
  <text start="356.089" dur="11.58">you know they needed to provide those</text>
  <text start="357.919" dur="12.42">bank records now in a transcript which</text>
  <text start="367.669" dur="4.8">is here this is a transcript from a</text>

  <text start="398.7" dur="5.57">records this is a transcript of a</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="7.56">hearing that happened where basically</text>
  <text start="404.27" dur="6.46">the fusion GPS was arguing that the</text>
  <text start="408.9" dur="3.6">subpoena was way to broaden that they</text>
  <text start="410.73" dur="4.44">needed more time to kind of work out the</text>
  <text start="412.5" dur="5.04">details the house was saying the house</text>
  <text start="415.17" dur="3.69">attorney was saying NIT &amp;#39;no no we&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="422.01" dur="3.66">pushing back against that and the house</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="5.07">is arguing that they&amp;#39;re not acting in</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="5.31">good faith and fusion gps&amp;#39;s attorneys</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="3.69">within this hearing are saying if they</text>
  <text start="430.98" dur="3.78">want the stuff on the steel and the</text>
  <text start="432.54" dur="4.47">dossier we&amp;#39;ll give it to them you know</text>
  <text start="434.76" dur="5.04">let&amp;#39;s just narrow this down this is such</text>
  <text start="437.01" dur="4.5">a broad subpoena this desks for</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="4.82">everything that we could possibly have</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="5.21">and something interesting happened</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="5.14">interesting happens</text>
  <text start="446.72" dur="4.51">mr. hungar here is the attorney for the</text>
  <text start="449.76" dur="3.84">house permanent Select Committee on</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="5.76">Intelligence and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re gonna pick</text>
  <text start="453.6" dur="8.85">up here is after the attorney for fusion</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="8.37">GPS basically argues that there is no</text>
  <text start="462.45" dur="4.86">reason for few for the government to be</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="5.58">asking for all of these bank records for</text>
  <text start="467.31" dur="6.42">two years because the dossier portion</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="4.68">was a brief stint within a few months</text>
  <text start="473.73" dur="3.51">and that they can you know there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="475.62" dur="3.06">reason for them to need all of this</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="3.54">other stuff if they just need this stuff</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="4.08">about the dossier he also in his</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="4.95">testimony before the judge or his</text>
  <text start="482.76" dur="5.52">rebuttal or what argument goes on to</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="4.29">basically impune Devin Nunez and say or</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="4.35">Nunez however you guys want me to say it</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="4.14">I don&amp;#39;t know to impugn him and basically</text>
  <text start="492.63" dur="3.51">say he&amp;#39;s recused who the hell does he</text>
  <text start="494.16" dur="5.4">think he is asking you know signing this</text>
  <text start="496.14" dur="7.89">subpoena because this is in in October</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="7.53">of 2017 here&amp;#39;s where the key part comes</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="5.55">in mr. hungar was the the attorney for</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="4.8">the government says mr. Taylor was also</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="3.87">suggesting that the dossier is the only</text>
  <text start="511.89" dur="3.36">thing that the committee is interested</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="3.99">in that&amp;#39;s simply not the case</text>
  <text start="515.25" dur="4.62">there is evidence indeed public</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="4.32">information suggesting that his client</text>
  <text start="519.87" dur="3.63">had other russia-related matters that it</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="3.33">was engaged in during the same time</text>
  <text start="523.5" dur="3.6">period</text>
  <text start="525.09" dur="3.15">the same time period that also had</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="5.35">implications for the Ruscha</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="6.37">investigation this would be fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="4.53">and Preveza and thus on the sky he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.61" dur="4.74">referencing and the committee therefore</text>
  <text start="536.98" dur="4.5">is interested in pursuing information</text>
  <text start="539.35" dur="3.87">about those as well which is why he has</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="3.39">offered to provide information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="4.32">strictly limited to one or two clients</text>
  <text start="544.87" dur="6.21">for the dossier is insufficient here it</text>
  <text start="547.54" dur="5.25">is in addition the committee is seeking</text>
  <text start="551.08" dur="3.99">to determine whether there are any</text>
  <text start="552.79" dur="5.07">connections between fusion and the</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="4.71">intelligence community which is part of</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="9.18">what this information would be designed</text>
  <text start="559.78" dur="10.2">to obtain so it is totally I believe</text>
  <text start="567.04" dur="5.01">even more possible now even more than it</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="6.75">was before given that they were granted</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="6.9">these bank records given they were</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="4.08">granted the bank records which I</text>
  <text start="578.95" dur="11.48">referenced here in the government</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="13.8">contractor paragraph that fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="590.43" dur="5.89">could be almost probably is at least if</text>
  <text start="594.61" dur="6.15">they were speculating that back then and</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="6.54">it was Nunez a government contractor</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="4.68">being paid by the government and they I</text>
  <text start="602.86" dur="5.7">mean I can&amp;#39;t think of any any other</text>
  <text start="605.44" dur="5.43">entity that that pfizer you know that</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="3.81">that a summary report is referencing I</text>
  <text start="610.87" dur="4.02">mean it just does nothing else makes</text>
  <text start="612.37" dur="5.73">sense and given that&amp;#39;s the case and we</text>
  <text start="614.89" dur="5.28">know that the the the Inspector General</text>
  <text start="618.1" dur="3.75">has access to all of that material we</text>
  <text start="620.17" dur="3.9">know that they&amp;#39;ve been passing</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="4.47">transcripts back and forth etc so on and</text>
  <text start="624.07" dur="4.26">so forth I just don&amp;#39;t see any other</text>
  <text start="626.32" dur="4.56">solution I think that this is really</text>
  <text start="628.33" dur="4.28">important I&amp;#39;ve never seen it before this</text>
  <text start="630.88" dur="4.26">has been available for quite a long time</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="4.72">but I&amp;#39;ve never seen this transcript</text>
  <text start="635.14" dur="5.46">before and I would have included it it</text>
  <text start="637.33" dur="6.93">was filed again in 2017 so all the way</text>
  <text start="640.6" dur="5.58">back on October 27th of 2017 and and</text>
  <text start="644.26" dur="3.63">from when the house permanent Select</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="3.27">Committee on Intelligence is looking for</text>
  <text start="647.89" dur="3.69">fusion gps&amp;#39;s bank records</text>
  <text start="649.45" dur="3.99">they are suspecting that there is some</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="4.26">tie between fusion GPS and the</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="5.73">intelligence community meaning they were</text>
  <text start="655.84" dur="4.62">paid there was money being transferred</text>
  <text start="659.17" dur="4.35">back and forth between the intelligence</text>
  <text start="660.46" dur="5.01">community some agency and fusion GPS and</text>
  <text start="663.52" dur="2.93">I&amp;#39;m going to make a very strong</text>
  <text start="665.47" dur="4.25">assertion</text>
  <text start="666.45" dur="6">that that government agency is the FBI</text>
  <text start="669.72" dur="4.799">and that fusion gps was a contractor</text>
  <text start="672.45" dur="3.75">that was abusing you know that was not</text>
  <text start="674.519" dur="3.301">being managed properly and was going</text>
  <text start="676.2" dur="7.37">outside of scope in gathering</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="9.87">information using the 702 database in</text>
