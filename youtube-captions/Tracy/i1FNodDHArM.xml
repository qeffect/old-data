  <text start="35.01" dur="5.069">require me to read things to you that</text>
  <text start="37.53" dur="5.549">have been reported elsewhere in order to</text>

  <text start="45.809" dur="5.101">full disclosure not happen I&amp;#39;m just</text>

  <text start="50.91" dur="6.78">I consider myself a journalist and</text>
  <text start="54.17" dur="5.56">sometimes for me personally like right</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="3.81">now I think we&amp;#39;re at a precipice where</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="4.289">there&amp;#39;s so much information coming at us</text>
  <text start="61.5" dur="4.74">from either way there&amp;#39;s gonna have to be</text>

  <text start="71.4" dur="6.509">citing factual information and when I am</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="4.829">using an opinion or speculation so that</text>
  <text start="77.909" dur="4.441">you guys will be able to tell the</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="5.671">difference and I could be wrong with</text>

  <text start="84.9" dur="3.06">disclosure there&amp;#39;s absolutely the case</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="3.81">it could be wrong but I&amp;#39;m gonna show you</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="4.38">what makes me think the way I do and</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="4.95">then you guys can look at everything I</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="4.86">provide from both sides and hopefully do</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="4.41">your own sort of digging to come up with</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="4.47">your own conclusions what I am trying to</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="4.89">do is remove a motion from this</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.949">completely and look at the facts and so</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;m gonna give you my opinions and facts</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="3.96">and the reasons why I think the way I do</text>
  <text start="108.54" dur="3.899">in this video but it is going to be</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="4.201">complicated it is gonna be hard to</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="4.801">follow it&amp;#39;s very complicated actually it</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="5.189">took me days to get here and so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="5.19">hoping that I can convey this to you</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="5.76">guys in the right way but let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="122.43" dur="5.219">started so a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="125.729" dur="3.661">Sundance from the conservative tree</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="4.861">house came out who was at the last</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="4.47">refuge to on Twitter and he basically</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="5.55">made a bombshell</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="8.79">report that from the interviews of</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="6.57">Caputo and from some other you know open</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="6.51">source areas and from the Madoff ordeal</text>
  <text start="144.63" dur="9.44">he was able to decipher and glean a an</text>
  <text start="149.16" dur="8.04">overlooked point that when rod</text>
  <text start="154.07" dur="5.5">Rosenstein or steam however you decide</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="5.52">to say it appointed the special counsel</text>
  <text start="159.57" dur="5.18">he directed the special counsel to take</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="4.68">over the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="5.92">investigation that had been ongoing in</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="5.9">the Justice Department meaning the</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="5.819">counterintelligence investigation that</text>
  <text start="173.3" dur="6.01">work that the the Carter page FISA</text>
  <text start="176.489" dur="6.121">warrant was based on and what he argues</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="5.179">is that because the Special Counsel took</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="5.67">over that counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="6.631">investigation as per Sundance they then</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="5.459">were granted title one slice&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="4.81">authorization instead of you be having</text>
  <text start="193.739" dur="4.171">to use the normal title three</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="4.08">authorization that requires you to go in</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.829">front of a judge and get a subpoena etc</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="4.199">and a warrant and all that so it comes</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="3.661">down to the difference between title one</text>
  <text start="204.209" dur="6.541">which is law intelligence and two hops</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="6.24">and title three which is the normal</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="4.23">process that were used to in in the</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="4.77">Department of Justice and he makes a</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="5.25">very compelling case for why that&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="4.98">and the one thing that I&amp;#39;ve seen that</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="4.259">most strongly leads me to believe that</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s the case is this right here which</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="4.591">is the this is the press release on the</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="3.84">17th when they announced the Special</text>
  <text start="229.08" dur="7.469">Counsel and if you read very carefully</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="8.519">here it says Deputy Attorney General Rod</text>
  <text start="236.549" dur="4.531">J Rosenstein today announced the</text>
  <text start="239.549" dur="3.391">appointment of former Department of</text>
  <text start="241.08" dur="4.8">Justice official and FBI Director Robert</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="5.73">Muller to serve as special counsel to</text>
  <text start="245.88" dur="4.859">oversee the previously confirmed FBI</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="4.02">investigation of Russian government</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="4.831">efforts to influence the 2016</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="5.43">presidential rely collection and related</text>
  <text start="255.57" dur="6.59">matters now</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="8.41">Sundance says that that investigation</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="6.74">the counterintelligence the previously</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="8.55">FBI investigation is the one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.9" dur="10.5">using FISA so let&amp;#39;s think about the</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="6.93">ramifications of that my questions that</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="6.12">stem off of that immediately are okay so</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="5.82">then that&amp;#39;s why a completely rogue</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="4.59">acting Attorney General in rod</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="5.67">Rosenstein if you go by that line of</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="9.48">thinking RIA proved the FISA warrant in</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="8.25">July of 2017 when it expired remember it</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="5.28">was approved four times and that gave</text>
  <text start="301.75" dur="4.65">Muller till October and then if you take</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="6.18">a look at what happened in October we</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="8.01">got the indictments of metaphoric and</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="4.2">gates at the very end of October then</text>
  <text start="314.41" dur="2.91">that expired</text>
  <text start="315.25" dur="4.59">and as far as we know it hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="5.909">renewed so I&amp;#39;m just gonna share my</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="6.329">thoughts with you now for me the first</text>
  <text start="323.229" dur="4.951">question I have is well what good is his</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="3.81">investigation and why wouldn&amp;#39;t they need</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="5.07">that the entire time and why wouldn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="329.979" dur="7.051">be renewed that was my first question my</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="5.55">second question is that power requires</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="4.77">folks to have security clearance</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="4.83">especially because it&amp;#39;s being used on</text>
  <text start="341.8" dur="4.71">government officials including the</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="5.22">President of the United States if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.51" dur="4.529">if we&amp;#39;re going by his you know he knows</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="5.34">what he&amp;#39;s talking about Sundance I defer</text>
  <text start="351.039" dur="5.88">to him on a lot of things but I and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="5.58">tried to reconcile this within my myself</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="4.021">and I I&amp;#39;m having a hard time with it for</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="3.06">the reasons I&amp;#39;m stating you know he</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="4.14">could be a hundred percent right and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="362.83" dur="4.53">just not understanding that could be</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="4.05">true so I&amp;#39;m doing my best here for you</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="4.17">guys really but they need security</text>
  <text start="369.13" dur="7.58">clearance and a lot of that team doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="371.53" dur="10.17">have it so this would be such an amazing</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="7.24">abuse of power oh my gosh this would be</text>
  <text start="381.7" dur="6.48">just and you would also have to assume</text>
  <text start="383.95" dur="5.91">that Donald Trump has absolutely no idea</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="4.56">what&amp;#39;s going on inside the Justice</text>
  <text start="389.86" dur="6.78">Department at all like he has to have</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="6.06">absolutely no clue what&amp;#39;s happening so</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="3.09">we&amp;#39;ll have to go by that we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="3.74">go by that</text>
  <text start="399.73" dur="5.82">if as we we take this theory forward</text>
  <text start="402.54" dur="4.42">that he doesn&amp;#39;t have any idea what the</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="5.81">hell is happening in his department of</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="11.94">justice and some dance also argues that</text>
  <text start="411.36" dur="9.82">the redactions in that August memo that</text>
  <text start="418.9" dur="11.04">came out through these mounted four</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="11.85">proceedings which are here these</text>
  <text start="429.94" dur="5.28">redactions here specify this title one</text>
  <text start="433.03" dur="6.51">Authority that&amp;#39;s what he argues and</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="6.66">we&amp;#39;re gonna go over his his thinking now</text>
  <text start="439.54" dur="9.23">we&amp;#39;re gonna go over it right now so here</text>
  <text start="441.88" dur="6.89">it is it all comes together listen up</text>
  <text start="449.25" dur="6.07">listen up Michael Caputo a fear appears</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="3.48">on Fox News for a general discussion of</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="3.39">his third experience being grilled by</text>
  <text start="456.88" dur="4.95">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s legal team within the</text>
  <text start="458.71" dur="5.01">Clinton mauler special Council now again</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="4.53">this video is gonna it&amp;#39;s just gonna be</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="4.77">too much but listen I went over all of</text>
  <text start="466.36" dur="4.71">those Caputo interviews he actually had</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="4.56">several that day he had an interview on</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="3.3">he had two interviews on Fox they lasted</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="3.24">five minutes each he had two interviews</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="4.38">on CNN and they EE lasted about 20</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="4.29">minutes each and there were very there</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="3.5">were five main talking points or so</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="4.62">maybe four or five that were very</text>
  <text start="482.25" dur="5.37">prevalent throughout those interviews</text>
  <text start="485.2" dur="5.7">and I was gonna do a video just on that</text>
  <text start="487.62" dur="4.78">but I put it aside and I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="3.57">what that stuff says and in just a</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="3.87">second but basically he says Michael</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="3.39">Caputo appears on Fox News for a general</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="3.63">discussion of his third experience being</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="3.33">grilled by the legal team however one of</text>
  <text start="499.9" dur="3.72">the interesting bits of information</text>
  <text start="501.19" dur="4.86">where is where mr. Caputo notes the</text>
  <text start="503.62" dur="4.2">Clinton Muller team very interesting how</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="3.8">he chose us to say that have the</text>
  <text start="507.82" dur="5.279">personal emails phone call logs</text>
  <text start="509.85" dur="5.17">communications and even text messages of</text>
  <text start="513.099" dur="4.621">every targeted member of the</text>
  <text start="515.02" dur="3.72">investigation this little factoid is</text>
  <text start="517.72" dur="2.73">jaw-dropping</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="3.359">important because it highlights the</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="4.83">underlying reason why Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="6.211">General rod Rosenstein needed to grant a</text>
  <text start="525.28" dur="5.46">July 2017 extension of the title once</text>

  <text start="530.74" dur="3.13">against Carter page</text>
  <text start="532.16" dur="4.08">that was actually being utilized by the</text>
  <text start="533.87" dur="5.25">FBI to conduct political surveillance of</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="5.579">the same Trump officials without the</text>
  <text start="539.12" dur="4.589">July extension Robert Muller would not</text>
  <text start="541.819" dur="3.661">have predicate investigative authority</text>

  <text start="545.48" dur="4.409">targets and extract their personal</text>
  <text start="547.579" dur="4.351">communication more would have needed to</text>
  <text start="549.889" dur="4.081">go to court for a search warrant he is</text>
  <text start="551.93" dur="4.55">conducting a criminal investigation he</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="5.969">would have needed probable cause however</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="6.669">by applying the 2016 extended title 1</text>
  <text start="559.939" dur="5.101">warrant FISA the Clinton Muller special</text>

  <text start="588.5" dur="4.5">yesterday you sat down with with</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="4.859">Muller&amp;#39;s folks what was that like yeah</text>
  <text start="593" dur="3.36">yesterday was my third trip to</text>
  <text start="594.589" dur="5.55">Washington in order to talk about the</text>
  <text start="596.36" dur="5.969">Russia collusion delusion it was with</text>
  <text start="600.139" dur="4.05">Muller and the day before was with</text>
  <text start="602.329" dur="3.36">Senate Intelligence it was very</text>
  <text start="604.189" dur="3.781">different from what I did at Senate</text>
  <text start="605.689" dur="3.45">Intelligence and what I endured at house</text>
  <text start="607.97" dur="3.809">permanent Select Committee on</text>

  <text start="611.779" dur="5.071">investigation really wasn&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="614.24" dur="4.98">trying to find something every question</text>
  <text start="616.85" dur="5.94">they asked they already had the answer</text>
  <text start="619.22" dur="4.919">to so from my perspective they&amp;#39;re quite</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="5.34">directed at what they&amp;#39;re doing they</text>
  <text start="624.139" dur="5.851">still believe in this theory of Russian</text>
  <text start="628.13" dur="3.87">collusion but of course you know my</text>
  <text start="629.99" dur="4.05">perspective is a little tilted because I</text>
  <text start="632" dur="3.99">wouldn&amp;#39;t be asked about obstruction I</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="4.169">wasn&amp;#39;t in the administration when these</text>
  <text start="635.99" dur="3.81">allegations were launched and they</text>

  <text start="645.47" dur="4.5">be all Russian collusion you would think</text>
  <text start="647.93" dur="4.62">so but from my perspective that book is</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="4.979">not closed yet all right so you know I</text>
  <text start="652.55" dur="4.649">it not the specific questions but in</text>

  <text start="659.18" dur="4.17">how far along they are or if they seem</text>
  <text start="661.61" dur="3.39">to be wrapping this up or whether</text>
  <text start="663.35" dur="2.22">they&amp;#39;re midway through did you get</text>

  <text start="665.57" dur="5.58">education of that I think they&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="668.18" dur="4.95">far along they had you know without</text>
  <text start="671.15" dur="3.84">interfering with the investigation I</text>
  <text start="673.13" dur="4.05">have to be quite quite careful about</text>
  <text start="674.99" dur="4.56">what I say in fact it was a bit of an</text>
  <text start="677.18" dur="6">intimidating session so I&amp;#39;m being</text>
  <text start="679.55" dur="4.83">overcautious frankly well I I it was</text>
  <text start="683.18" dur="4.44">very clear that they didn&amp;#39;t want me to</text>
  <text start="684.38" dur="5.34">talk about this stuff and I think I can</text>
  <text start="687.62" dur="6.21">I can characterize what I what I</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="6">exchanged so this is a but I think</text>
  <text start="693.83" dur="4.62">everybody has been a caution by the</text>
  <text start="695.72" dur="5.04">Muller team that going out there and</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="4.65">talking about a chapter in versus let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="703.1" dur="7.68">somebody over there gets mad they can</text>
  <text start="705.68" dur="8.7">invite me back don&amp;#39;t doubt it you know</text>
  <text start="710.78" dur="4.8">in in terms of the questions that I know</text>
  <text start="714.38" dur="3.3">you can&amp;#39;t talk about the questions</text>
  <text start="715.58" dur="5.16">specifically but you know in terms of</text>
  <text start="717.68" dur="4.98">the the way that they were questioning</text>
  <text start="720.74" dur="4.53">you you know do you feel like you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="4.11">target or that you you know what what</text>
  <text start="725.27" dur="2.97">was your takeaway how did you walk out</text>
  <text start="726.77" dur="2.67">of there feeling like okay I&amp;#39;m done and</text>
  <text start="728.24" dur="3.35">they got what they wanted and they</text>
  <text start="729.44" dur="4.8">didn&amp;#39;t find anything of interest with me</text>
  <text start="731.59" dur="4.45">well you know they told me at the</text>
  <text start="734.24" dur="4.17">beginning and they told my attorney when</text>
  <text start="736.04" dur="4.14">they invited me when I decided to come</text>
  <text start="738.41" dur="4.38">willingly that I&amp;#39;m a witness not a</text>

  <text start="742.79" dur="4.32">that didn&amp;#39;t change but I think they were</text>
  <text start="745.55" dur="4.14">looking for an opportunity to make me a</text>
  <text start="747.11" dur="4.47">subject in this thing but at the same</text>
  <text start="749.69" dur="3.99">time now they&amp;#39;re talking about WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="751.58" dur="5.16">and DC leaks and gusoff err and things</text>
  <text start="753.68" dur="4.65">like that they&amp;#39;re still very easy news</text>
  <text start="756.74" dur="3.18">they knew more about the campaign than</text>
  <text start="758.33" dur="4.29">you did yourself what did you mean by</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="4.23">that well I actually said they know more</text>
  <text start="762.62" dur="4.05">about the campaign that any one person</text>
  <text start="764.15" dur="4.17">does who worked there they have all the</text>

  <text start="780.41" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t doesn&amp;#39;t sound like they</text>
  <text start="782.18" dur="5.46">have proof of collusion delusion Michael</text>
  <text start="785.42" dur="4.08">Caputo thank you very much so this is</text>
  <text start="787.64" dur="4.14">basically what he does on every</text>
  <text start="789.5" dur="5.16">interview except the CNN ones are a lot</text>
  <text start="791.78" dur="4.29">more in detail and he&amp;#39;s very coached he</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="2.25">says he&amp;#39;s not allowed to talk about</text>
  <text start="796.07" dur="2.4">what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="796.91" dur="3.12">by the investigation but he gets pretty</text>
  <text start="798.47" dur="3.84">frickin detailed about what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="800.03" dur="4.14">inside the investigation and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="802.31" dur="4.65">point out to people as we talked about</text>
  <text start="804.17" dur="4.74">this interview and and Caputo and the</text>
  <text start="806.96" dur="3.84">fact that the fact that Sundance is</text>
  <text start="808.91" dur="5.28">basing a lot of this reporting on what</text>
  <text start="810.8" dur="5.58">Caputo says which he said it I mean they</text>
  <text start="814.19" dur="6.69">got the text but I also know that that</text>
  <text start="816.38" dur="6.24">the Trump team provided a ton of stuff</text>
  <text start="820.88" dur="4.11">to him willingly I don&amp;#39;t know that that</text>
  <text start="822.62" dur="4.08">includes the text messages but they came</text>
  <text start="824.99" dur="3.21">out and took responsibility for the</text>
  <text start="826.7" dur="3.51">arrest of Papadopoulos and the</text>
  <text start="828.2" dur="4.35">indictment of Papadopoulos which I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="830.21" dur="4.44">shown you several times before so to me</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s really interesting now that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="834.65" dur="6.42">predicated on this it&amp;#39;s predicated on</text>
  <text start="836.63" dur="5.91">him saying that they they they have all</text>
  <text start="841.07" dur="3.45">the text messages and everything like</text>
  <text start="842.54" dur="3.81">that but I just wanted to show you</text>
  <text start="844.52" dur="5.28">something that came out from the special</text>
  <text start="846.35" dur="5.49">counsel a week or so ago I want you guys</text>
  <text start="849.8" dur="3.54">I pulled up the tucker carlson interview</text>
  <text start="851.84" dur="3.36">that he did where he basically said he</text>
  <text start="853.34" dur="3.12">was you know tougher kind of expanded on</text>
  <text start="855.2" dur="3.69">the theory that camuto says he was</text>
  <text start="856.46" dur="3.9">threatened into not speaking about what</text>
  <text start="858.89" dur="3.36">the special counsel is doing while</text>
  <text start="860.36" dur="5.48">speaking very clearly about what they</text>
  <text start="862.25" dur="5.97">say the special counsel is doing and</text>
  <text start="865.84" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s really interesting because at four</text>
  <text start="868.22" dur="4.8">minutes and three seconds and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="869.84" dur="4.95">to start down here at four 359 I want</text>
  <text start="873.02" dur="3.21">you to listen carefully and he says this</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="3.18">in several other interviews I can put</text>
  <text start="876.23" dur="3.12">the links to them below I took the</text>
  <text start="877.97" dur="3.09">transcripts out I compared the</text>
  <text start="879.35" dur="4.2">transcripts I listened to them all I</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="6.12">found these interviews very very</text>
  <text start="883.55" dur="5.25">interesting he&amp;#39;s obviously very coached</text>
  <text start="887.18" dur="3.54">like I said there&amp;#39;s about four or five</text>
  <text start="888.8" dur="3.75">salient talking points that permeate</text>
  <text start="890.72" dur="3.21">throughout all these interviews let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="3.45">listen to what he says here at four</text>
  <text start="893.93" dur="6.93">minutes Washington Lee that&amp;#39;s New York</text>
  <text start="896" dur="6.59">let&amp;#39;s discuss it&amp;#39;s disgusting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="900.86" dur="4.92">looking at WikiLeaks they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="902.59" dur="4.45">gusoff er they&amp;#39;re looking at you know DC</text>
  <text start="905.78" dur="2.49">leaks everything that you see in the</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="2.49">media that&amp;#39;s been leaked out there</text>
  <text start="908.27" dur="2.88">that&amp;#39;s certainly what they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="909.53" dur="4.98">and I think they&amp;#39;re pretty focused on</text>
  <text start="911.15" dur="5.64">this some believe everything that you</text>
  <text start="914.51" dur="4.94">see out there in the media that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="916.79" dur="2.66">they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="921.02" dur="9.21">well Robert Muller&amp;#39;s warning many news</text>
  <text start="928.22" dur="4.8">stories on Trump Russia Provo wrong and</text>
  <text start="930.23" dur="4.44">this was Monday April 16th Special</text>
  <text start="933.02" dur="3.54">Counsel Muller&amp;#39;s offices warning that</text>

  <text start="938.3" dur="3.78">statement from a spokesperson did not</text>
  <text start="940.13" dur="3.84">single out particular stories but the</text>
  <text start="942.08" dur="5.39">warning did come after enquiries about a</text>
  <text start="943.97" dur="6.54">McClatchy news story about Prague and</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="4.69">Michael Cohen what I&amp;#39;ve been telling all</text>
  <text start="950.51" dur="4.019">reporters is that many stories about our</text>
  <text start="952.16" dur="3.78">investigation have been inaccurate be</text>
  <text start="954.529" dur="2.791">very cautious about any source that</text>
  <text start="955.94" dur="2.94">claims to have knowledge about our</text>
  <text start="957.32" dur="3.48">investigation and dig deep into what</text>
  <text start="958.88" dur="3.69">they claim before reporting on it if</text>
  <text start="960.8" dur="3.18">another outlet reports on something</text>
  <text start="962.57" dur="6.54">don&amp;#39;t run with it unless you have your</text>
  <text start="963.98" dur="10.02">own sourcing to back it up hmm so</text>
  <text start="969.11" dur="6.78">basically who do we believe Caputo or</text>
  <text start="974" dur="4.38">the spokesperson for the Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="975.89" dur="8.009">or is there a reason for all this who</text>
  <text start="978.38" dur="7.019">knows anyway that&amp;#39;s what the that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="983.899" dur="5.761">the article from Sundance was about</text>
  <text start="985.399" dur="5.791">they&amp;#39;re using title one FISA two into</text>
  <text start="989.66" dur="3.45">the special counsel of the Muller probe</text>
  <text start="991.19" dur="4.68">and there are reasons for all of this</text>
  <text start="993.11" dur="5.039">and I&amp;#39;m going to show you another very</text>
  <text start="995.87" dur="4.709">compelling piece that will that lends</text>
  <text start="998.149" dur="6.421">credence towards that theory and it is</text>
  <text start="1000.579" dur="5.401">this press release from these from the</text>
  <text start="1004.57" dur="3.66">Department of Justice on the day that</text>
  <text start="1005.98" dur="4.919">Muller was appointed and it basically</text>
  <text start="1008.23" dur="4.049">says Deputy Attorney General announced</text>

  <text start="1020.32" dur="5.879">presidential election and related</text>
  <text start="1022.75" dur="8.55">matters and that&amp;#39;s another compelling</text>
  <text start="1026.199" dur="7.791">piece because this could mean the title</text>
  <text start="1031.3" dur="5.399">the FISA the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1033.99" dur="8.14">investigation that was going on using</text>
  <text start="1036.699" dur="7.291">the FISA warrants so there&amp;#39;s that so now</text>
  <text start="1042.13" dur="7.02">that we&amp;#39;ve discussed that stuff I want</text>
  <text start="1043.99" dur="8.61">to bring you into this was written</text>
  <text start="1049.15" dur="5.17">yesterday by Sundance special counsel</text>

  <text start="1068.72" dur="3.99">going to go over it as noted yesterday</text>
  <text start="1070.43" dur="3.84">Ellis is the first legal entity to</text>
  <text start="1072.71" dur="3.09">identify the origin of the special</text>
  <text start="1074.27" dur="3.96">counsel investigative authority as a</text>
  <text start="1075.8" dur="4.29">troubling issue this is likely to become</text>
  <text start="1078.23" dur="4.11">a much bigger stories people catch on to</text>
  <text start="1080.09" dur="4.05">the ramifications it&amp;#39;s only now coming</text>
  <text start="1082.34" dur="3.66">to light how Assistant Attorney General</text>
  <text start="1084.14" dur="3.54">are are essentially appointed the</text>
  <text start="1086" dur="3.18">special counsel to take over the</text>
  <text start="1087.68" dur="4.37">counterintelligence investigation</text>
  <text start="1089.18" dur="5.37">originally begun by the FBI in 2016 also</text>
  <text start="1092.05" dur="4.33">previously unknown part of the</text>
  <text start="1094.55" dur="3.63">initiating mandate included the special</text>

  <text start="1098.18" dur="4.92">FISA Court title one surveillance</text>
  <text start="1101.6" dur="4.41">warrant initially applied against Carter</text>
  <text start="1103.1" dur="4.92">page in 2016 the problem I have with</text>
  <text start="1106.01" dur="7.11">this and I can&amp;#39;t reconcile is that they</text>
  <text start="1108.02" dur="9.93">do not reference what investigation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1113.12" dur="10.23">taking over I&amp;#39;m just not firm on it just</text>
  <text start="1117.95" dur="7.02">not and so he goes on here to discuss</text>
  <text start="1123.35" dur="3.9">the difference between title 1 and title</text>
  <text start="1124.97" dur="4.86">3 how in title 3 you need to go in you</text>
  <text start="1127.25" dur="5.79">need to get a subpoena so on and so</text>
  <text start="1129.83" dur="5.25">forth and he used very very firm on the</text>
  <text start="1133.04" dur="4.83">story you really this is really heat</text>
  <text start="1135.08" dur="8.78">this is what Sundance believes happened</text>
  <text start="1137.87" dur="8.28">as as well as Lou Dobbs who tweeted</text>
  <text start="1143.86" dur="6.07">Sundance and conservative treehouse</text>
  <text start="1146.15" dur="5.87">well-deserved well-deserved I was proud</text>
  <text start="1149.93" dur="6.69">it was happy I was like yes</text>
  <text start="1152.02" dur="7.09">however I read the transcript in fault</text>
  <text start="1156.62" dur="10.29">and I think what makes sense for us to</text>
  <text start="1159.11" dur="10.11">do is to go over this in full together</text>
  <text start="1166.91" dur="4.32">and I don&amp;#39;t want to really read the</text>
  <text start="1169.22" dur="4.89">entire thing straight to start to finish</text>
  <text start="1171.23" dur="4.95">but it&amp;#39;s it the arguments inside here</text>
  <text start="1174.11" dur="4.89">have very very strong ramifications for</text>
  <text start="1176.18" dur="4.38">the special counsel a Paul Manafort for</text>
  <text start="1179" dur="3.63">the future of how these things are</text>
  <text start="1180.56" dur="4.68">handled and it&amp;#39;s going to be a good</text>
  <text start="1182.63" dur="4.47">exercise to go through what these are so</text>
  <text start="1185.24" dur="2.19">the court basically goes back and forth</text>
  <text start="1187.1" dur="3.09">and</text>
  <text start="1187.43" dur="4.05">asks who&amp;#39;s who who&amp;#39;s talking what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1190.19" dur="4.26">interesting to note is that these</text>
  <text start="1191.48" dur="6.69">special counsel also has an attorney</text>
  <text start="1194.45" dur="6.36">representing them and so the special</text>
  <text start="1198.17" dur="5.48">counsel has an attorney outside of their</text>
  <text start="1200.81" dur="5.1">attorneys representing them and the</text>
  <text start="1203.65" dur="3.7">obviously metaphor has his attorneys and</text>
  <text start="1205.91" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re in front of judge Ellis right</text>
  <text start="1207.35" dur="6.63">now Reagan appointed judge very valid</text>
  <text start="1210.47" dur="6">questions and really funny bench side</text>
  <text start="1213.98" dur="4.98">manner so the court says okay</text>
  <text start="1216.47" dur="4.92">the indictment again mr. against mr.</text>
  <text start="1218.96" dur="4.44">manna fort was filed in February but it</text>

  <text start="1296.42" dur="3.18">the special prosecutor was appointed and</text>
  <text start="1298.28" dur="3.51">I have the letter of appointment in</text>

  <text start="1303.98" dur="5.88">of mr. manna Fort T wall and the lawyer</text>

  <text start="1311.78" dur="3.87">appointed to conduct an investigation</text>
  <text start="1313.13" dur="2.88">and the judge interrupts he says I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1315.65" dur="1.95">sorry</text>
  <text start="1316.01" dur="4.11">answer my question do you remember what</text>
  <text start="1317.6" dur="3.309">my question was and mr. Dreeben says yes</text>

  <text start="1328.529" dur="4.411">counsel now this is what Sundance is</text>
  <text start="1331.529" dur="4.561">saying is the title one and the</text>
  <text start="1332.94" dur="6.03">counterintelligence investigation so the</text>
  <text start="1336.09" dur="4.62">court says apparently or at least I</text>
  <text start="1338.97" dur="2.309">believe that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s saying and let</text>
  <text start="1340.71" dur="2.49">me be clear</text>
  <text start="1341.279" dur="4.2">apparently if I look at the indictment</text>
  <text start="1343.2" dur="4.38">none of that information has anything to</text>
  <text start="1345.479" dur="3.991">do with links or coordination between</text>
  <text start="1347.58" dur="3.479">the Russian government and individuals</text>
  <text start="1349.47" dur="3.839">associated with the campaign of Donald</text>
  <text start="1351.059" dur="4.08">Trump that seems to me to be obvious</text>
  <text start="1353.309" dur="3.781">because they all long predate any</text>
  <text start="1355.139" dur="3.451">contact or affiliation this defendant</text>
  <text start="1357.09" dur="3.36">with the of this defendant with the</text>
  <text start="1358.59" dur="4.019">campaign so I don&amp;#39;t see what the</text>
  <text start="1360.45" dur="3.75">relation this indictment has is with</text>
  <text start="1362.609" dur="4.38">anything the special prosecutor is</text>
  <text start="1364.2" dur="5.399">authorized to investigate it looks to me</text>
  <text start="1366.989" dur="4.351">instead that what is happening is that</text>
  <text start="1369.599" dur="4.07">this investigation was underway</text>
  <text start="1371.34" dur="5.219">it had something the special prosecutor</text>
  <text start="1373.669" dur="4.57">took it got indictments and then at a</text>
  <text start="1376.559" dur="3.75">time-honored practice which I&amp;#39;m fully</text>
  <text start="1378.239" dur="4.05">familiar with it exists largely in the</text>
  <text start="1380.309" dur="3.87">drug area which is if you get somebody</text>
  <text start="1382.289" dur="3.69">in a conspiracy and you get something</text>
  <text start="1384.179" dur="3.33">against them you can then tighten the</text>
  <text start="1385.979" dur="2.7">screws and they&amp;#39;ll begin to provide</text>
  <text start="1387.509" dur="3.66">information and what you&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1388.679" dur="4.35">interested in that seems to me to be</text>
  <text start="1391.169" dur="3.57">what&amp;#39;s happening here so I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="1393.029" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s a legitimate but I think we ought</text>
  <text start="1394.739" dur="4.77">to be very clear about these facts and</text>
  <text start="1396.629" dur="4.86">what is happening now I think you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1399.509" dur="4.59">already conceded appropriately that this</text>
  <text start="1401.489" dur="4.77">investigation has led to that has led to</text>
  <text start="1404.099" dur="4.08">this indictment long antedated the</text>
  <text start="1406.259" dur="3">appointment of a special prosecutor that</text>
  <text start="1408.179" dur="3.271">it doesn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with</text>
  <text start="1409.259" dur="4.29">Russia or the campaign and that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1411.45" dur="4.74">indicted and it&amp;#39;s useful as in many</text>
  <text start="1413.549" dur="4.59">cases by prosecutors to exert leverage</text>
  <text start="1416.19" dur="3.869">on a defendant so that the defendant</text>
  <text start="1418.139" dur="3.54">will turn and provide information on</text>
  <text start="1420.059" dur="4.381">what is really the focus of a special</text>
  <text start="1421.679" dur="5.791">prosecutor where am I wrong in that</text>
  <text start="1424.44" dur="5.52">regard so he&amp;#39;s basically saying as no</text>
  <text start="1427.47" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s squeezing him to provide</text>
  <text start="1429.96" dur="5.219">information on Trump by using these</text>
  <text start="1432.45" dur="4.74">charges against him as leverage to do so</text>
  <text start="1435.179" dur="4.68">and the attorney for the special counsel</text>
  <text start="1437.19" dur="4.559">says the issue I think before you is</text>
  <text start="1439.859" dur="3.961">whether mr. Madoff or can dismiss the</text>
  <text start="1441.749" dur="4.68">indictment based on his claim and the</text>
  <text start="1443.82" dur="5.339">court says yes but I asked you where am</text>
  <text start="1446.429" dur="5.49">I wrong about that and the attorney mr.</text>
  <text start="1449.159" dur="4.83">Dreeben says you honor our investigatory</text>
  <text start="1451.919" dur="2.341">scope does cover the activities that led</text>
  <text start="1453.989" dur="2.041">to the</text>
  <text start="1454.26" dur="4.83">indictment in this case and the court</text>
  <text start="1456.03" dur="6">says it covers bank fraud in 2005 and</text>
  <text start="1459.09" dur="6.06">2007 and he says yes because and the</text>
  <text start="1462.03" dur="4.23">judge interrupts tell me how so mr.</text>
  <text start="1465.15" dur="3.06">Dreeben says your honor the</text>
  <text start="1466.26" dur="3.51">authorization for the special counsel to</text>
  <text start="1468.21" dur="3.48">investigate matters is described</text>
  <text start="1469.77" dur="4.77">generally in the appointment order on</text>
  <text start="1471.69" dur="4.05">may the court interrupts them I have it</text>
  <text start="1474.54" dur="2.67">right in front of me and it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1475.74" dur="3.84">surprise you to learn that I&amp;#39;m fully</text>
  <text start="1477.21" dur="4.56">familiar with it my question to you was</text>
  <text start="1479.58" dur="5.04">how does bank fraud in these other</text>
  <text start="1481.77" dur="5.13">things that go back to 2005 and 2007 how</text>
  <text start="1484.62" dur="4.2">does that have anything to do with links</text>
  <text start="1486.9" dur="3.6">and/or coordination between Russian</text>
  <text start="1488.82" dur="3.81">government and individuals associated</text>
  <text start="1490.5" dur="4.02">with the campaign of Trump and now they</text>
  <text start="1492.63" dur="4.23">start getting into the nitty-gritty and</text>
  <text start="1494.52" dur="4.5">I know I&amp;#39;m just reading this to you guys</text>
  <text start="1496.86" dur="3.45">but it&amp;#39;s necessary I there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="1499.02" dur="3.03">around it if you don&amp;#39;t want to hear me</text>
  <text start="1500.31" dur="6.42">read you can you know this isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1502.05" dur="6.38">video for you so Dreeben he said the</text>
  <text start="1506.73" dur="3.81">authorization order permits</text>
  <text start="1508.43" dur="4">investigation of two different things</text>
  <text start="1510.54" dur="4.41">that are described in separate clauses</text>
  <text start="1512.43" dur="4.26">the first are links and coordination</text>
  <text start="1514.95" dur="3.12">between individuals associated with the</text>
  <text start="1516.69" dur="2.82">Trump campaign and the Russian</text>
  <text start="1518.07" dur="4.14">government&amp;#39;s effort to influence the</text>
  <text start="1519.51" dur="4.71">election mr. Manafort was a campaign</text>
  <text start="1522.21" dur="4.11">official and the court says you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1524.22" dur="3.21">running away from my question again you</text>
  <text start="1526.32" dur="3.51">know I&amp;#39;m focused on the indictment</text>
  <text start="1527.43" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s here it involves facts and</text>
  <text start="1529.83" dur="5.34">circumstances that go back as far as</text>
  <text start="1531.87" dur="5.04">2005 and come forward mr. Madoff orts</text>
  <text start="1535.17" dur="3.69">loans from several banks that you all</text>
  <text start="1536.91" dur="3.63">claim he submitted fraudulent statements</text>
  <text start="1538.86" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m asking you and I&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="1540.54" dur="4.35">established this investigation long</text>
  <text start="1542.46" dur="4.32">predated the special prosecutor and so</text>
  <text start="1544.89" dur="3.96">what is really going on it seems to me</text>
  <text start="1546.78" dur="3.69">is that this indictment is used as a</text>
  <text start="1548.85" dur="4.02">means of exerting pressure on the</text>
  <text start="1550.47" dur="4.38">defendant to give you information that</text>
  <text start="1552.87" dur="4.95">really is in your appointment but it</text>
  <text start="1554.85" dur="5.13">itself has nothing whatsoever to do with</text>
  <text start="1557.82" dur="4.2">it and Dreeben says well Your Honor I</text>
  <text start="1559.98" dur="3.87">understand the question I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="1562.02" dur="3.42">explain why I think that it does have to</text>
  <text start="1563.85" dur="3.36">do with our investigative course cope</text>
  <text start="1565.44" dur="3.6">and I think there are a couple premise</text>
  <text start="1567.21" dur="4.71">that premises that may help illuminate</text>
  <text start="1569.04" dur="4.68">what that scope is the first one is that</text>
  <text start="1571.92" dur="3.63">in examining an individual who was</text>
  <text start="1573.72" dur="4.41">associated with the Trump campaign and</text>
  <text start="1575.55" dur="4.56">did have Russia affiliated connections</text>
  <text start="1578.13" dur="4.88">which mr. Matta fort did and the court</text>
  <text start="1580.11" dur="5.67">says are they Russian or Ukrainian and</text>
  <text start="1583.01" dur="4.37">Dreeben says both he worked extensively</text>
  <text start="1585.78" dur="3.25">in the Ukraine and he</text>
  <text start="1587.38" dur="3.24">so as business connections and other</text>
  <text start="1589.03" dur="3.69">connections to individuals associated</text>
  <text start="1590.62" dur="4.59">with Russia which i think might be</text>
  <text start="1592.72" dur="4.5">Deripaska and following the leads from</text>
  <text start="1595.21" dur="3.51">those things investigators want to</text>
  <text start="1597.22" dur="3.81">understand the full scope of his</text>
  <text start="1598.72" dur="4.2">relationship how he was paid with whom</text>
  <text start="1601.03" dur="3.69">he was associated what happened to the</text>
  <text start="1602.92" dur="3.78">money and that leads to the activities</text>
  <text start="1604.72" dur="5.66">that are an issue in this indictment the</text>
  <text start="1606.7" dur="5.85">court says well it didn&amp;#39;t lead to that</text>
  <text start="1610.38" dur="5.23">this was given to you by the Department</text>
  <text start="1612.55" dur="6.09">of Justice the investigation was already</text>
  <text start="1615.61" dur="3.6">well underway going back to 2005 am I</text>
  <text start="1618.64" dur="3.51">correct</text>
  <text start="1619.21" dur="4.32">and dreeben says well I think your honor</text>
  <text start="1622.15" dur="2.91">the investigation has developed</text>
  <text start="1623.53" dur="3.99">considerably with the special counsel</text>
  <text start="1625.06" dur="4.11">and the court says wasn&amp;#39;t it already in</text>
  <text start="1627.52" dur="3.33">existence in the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="1629.17" dur="3.96">and they gave it to you when you were</text>
  <text start="1630.85" dur="3.57">all appointed and Dreeben says there</text>
  <text start="1633.13" dur="3.42">were investigations that were in</text>
  <text start="1634.42" dur="3.9">existence yes but those investigations</text>
  <text start="1636.55" dur="3.9">were folded together with our overall</text>
  <text start="1638.32" dur="6.15">examination of mr. manna Forte&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1640.45" dur="9.12">conducts that fit within B I now before</text>
  <text start="1644.47" dur="8.33">we look at what B is I&amp;#39;m gonna say they</text>
  <text start="1649.57" dur="5.13">say that they say that these</text>
  <text start="1652.8" dur="4.45">investigations I&amp;#39;m gonna pause this for</text>
  <text start="1654.7" dur="4.8">a second he says here the investigation</text>
  <text start="1657.25" dur="5.46">was already well underway going back to</text>
  <text start="1659.5" dur="5.82">2005 which means to me that the</text>
  <text start="1662.71" dur="5.22">investigation started I don&amp;#39;t know 2005</text>
  <text start="1665.32" dur="5.19">2006 and they&amp;#39;ve been ongoing with it</text>
  <text start="1667.93" dur="6.84">this raises a number of questions number</text>
  <text start="1670.51" dur="6.36">one why didn&amp;#39;t anybody step forward to</text>
  <text start="1674.77" dur="3.99">tell the Trump campaign that mr. Madoff</text>
  <text start="1676.87" dur="8.72">or was under federal investigation for</text>
  <text start="1678.76" dur="9.84">what 15 years or 18 year or 13 years</text>
  <text start="1685.59" dur="5.05">number two this is not the</text>
  <text start="1688.6" dur="5.94">counterintelligence investigation that</text>
  <text start="1690.64" dur="7.2">started in 2016 if I&amp;#39;m reading it</text>

  <text start="1697.84" dur="6.93">help me with that but we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>

  <text start="1765.52" dur="8.07">understand what the statute covers now</text>
  <text start="1768.27" dur="6.789">back to the testimony the court all</text>
  <text start="1773.59" dur="2.88">right I think you&amp;#39;d agree that the</text>
  <text start="1775.059" dur="3.661">indictment that we have before the court</text>
  <text start="1776.47" dur="4.53">is not triggered by I which says any</text>
  <text start="1778.72" dur="3.6">links and/or coordination between the</text>
  <text start="1781" dur="2.88">Russian government and individuals</text>
  <text start="1782.32" dur="3.63">associated with the campaign of Trump</text>
  <text start="1783.88" dur="3.51">bank fraud in twenty two thousand five</text>
  <text start="1785.95" dur="3.12">and other things had nothing whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1787.39" dur="3.99">to do with that so then you go to number</text>
  <text start="1789.07" dur="3.69">two it says any matters that arose are</text>
  <text start="1791.38" dur="2.88">may arise directly from the</text>
  <text start="1792.76" dur="3.56">investigation and listen very carefully</text>
  <text start="1794.26" dur="4.83">here that was me talking</text>
  <text start="1796.32" dur="5.829">well this indictment didn&amp;#39;t arise from</text>
  <text start="1799.09" dur="5.76">your investigation it arose from a</text>
  <text start="1802.149" dur="5.371">pre-existing investigation even assuming</text>
  <text start="1804.85" dur="5.64">that I I is a valid delegation because</text>
  <text start="1807.52" dur="5.279">it&amp;#39;s open-ended go ahead sir so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1810.49" dur="4.289">basically saying the special counsel</text>
  <text start="1812.799" dur="4.5">really can&amp;#39;t investigate this stuff</text>
  <text start="1814.779" dur="4.26">because it didn&amp;#39;t arise out of a special</text>
  <text start="1817.299" dur="4.62">counsel like the the special counsel</text>
  <text start="1819.039" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t stumble across this as it was</text>
  <text start="1821.919" dur="6.63">looking into Trump watcher connections</text>
  <text start="1823.539" dur="7.081">it was handed this that was annoying it</text>
  <text start="1828.549" dur="4.291">was handed this and this had been an</text>
  <text start="1830.62" dur="4.62">ongoing investigation before the special</text>
  <text start="1832.84" dur="4.5">counsel was even a glimmer so the lawyer</text>
  <text start="1835.24" dur="3.299">for the special counsel says so I take a</text>
  <text start="1837.34" dur="2.819">different look at the way this order</text>
  <text start="1838.539" dur="4.02">works than your honors description for a</text>
  <text start="1840.159" dur="4.921">couple reasons the first is that in the</text>
  <text start="1842.559" dur="4.171">provision C which is in the order the</text>
  <text start="1845.08" dur="3.329">special counsel is authorized to</text>
  <text start="1846.73" dur="3.54">prosecute matters that arose from the</text>
  <text start="1848.409" dur="4.961">investigation that is described earlier</text>
  <text start="1850.27" dur="5.35">in the preamble and in bi and bi</text>
  <text start="1853.37" dur="3.81">so we are not limited on our prosecution</text>
  <text start="1855.62" dur="3.33">authority to crimes that would fit</text>
  <text start="1857.18" dur="3.78">within the precise description that was</text>
  <text start="1858.95" dur="4.02">issued in this public order if the</text>
  <text start="1860.96" dur="3.72">investigation is valid the crimes that</text>
  <text start="1862.97" dur="3.66">arose from that investigation are within</text>
  <text start="1864.68" dur="4.38">the special councils authority to</text>
  <text start="1866.63" dur="3.75">prosecute and the court rightly says</text>
  <text start="1869.06" dur="2.88">even though it didn&amp;#39;t arise from your</text>
  <text start="1870.38" dur="4.44">investigation it arose from a</text>
  <text start="1871.94" dur="4.23">pre-existing investigation and Dreeben</text>
  <text start="1874.82" dur="3.63">says well the investigation was</text>
  <text start="1876.17" dur="7.14">inherited by the special counsel now</text>
  <text start="1878.45" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re assuming that they mean previously</text>
  <text start="1883.31" dur="3.51">confirmed the FBI investigation of</text>
  <text start="1885.2" dur="4.32">Russian government efforts to influence</text>
  <text start="1886.82" dur="4.26">the 2016 election it there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="1889.52" dur="4.14">different things with this if that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1891.08" dur="5.64">case and this is the investigation then</text>
  <text start="1893.66" dur="6.36">manna fort was being looked into for his</text>
  <text start="1896.72" dur="5.07">ties to the Ukraine and Russia and he</text>
  <text start="1900.02" dur="4.05">really is a subject he really is a</text>
  <text start="1901.79" dur="5.1">target he really is involved there</text>
  <text start="1904.07" dur="6.9">he really is involved there that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1906.89" dur="6.15">number one if that&amp;#39;s true or that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1910.97" dur="3.39">what the judge is referencing and</text>
  <text start="1913.04" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s a there was a different</text>
  <text start="1914.36" dur="4.95">investigation ongoing as a matter fort</text>
  <text start="1916.28" dur="4.86">that that the special counsel was handed</text>
  <text start="1919.31" dur="3.12">by the Justice Department and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1921.14" dur="3.33">going to in very few minutes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1922.43" dur="3.66">going to get into jurisdiction and the</text>
  <text start="1924.47" dur="3.42">powers of the special counsel and an OPA</text>
  <text start="1926.09" dur="4.89">you know it&amp;#39;s gonna get good and this to</text>
  <text start="1927.89" dur="8.07">me I&amp;#39;m a dork I hope you guys are I hope</text>
  <text start="1930.98" dur="7.62">you guys aren&amp;#39;t bored so the court says</text>
  <text start="1935.96" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s right but your argument says even</text>
  <text start="1938.6" dur="3.69">though the investigation was really done</text>
  <text start="1940.31" dur="3.51">by the Justice Department handed to you</text>
  <text start="1942.29" dur="3.09">and then you&amp;#39;re now using it as I</text>
  <text start="1943.82" dur="3.75">indicated before as a means of</text>
  <text start="1945.38" dur="4.44">persuading mr. Madoff or to provide</text>
  <text start="1947.57" dur="4.68">information its vernacular by the way</text>
  <text start="1949.82" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve been here a long time the monocular</text>
  <text start="1952.25" dur="3.69">is to sing that&amp;#39;s what prosecutors use</text>
  <text start="1954.38" dur="2.97">but what you&amp;#39;ve got to be careful of is</text>
  <text start="1955.94" dur="4.59">that they may not just sing</text>
  <text start="1957.35" dur="5.28">they may also compose I can see a few</text>
  <text start="1960.53" dur="3.51">veteran defense counsel here and they</text>
  <text start="1962.63" dur="3.6">have spent a good deal of time in this</text>
  <text start="1964.04" dur="4.26">courtroom trying to persuade a jury that</text>
  <text start="1966.23" dur="4.14">there wasn&amp;#39;t singing there was composing</text>
  <text start="1968.3" dur="3.27">going on but in any event finish up this</text>
  <text start="1970.37" dur="4.83">point and then I&amp;#39;ll come back to the</text>
  <text start="1971.57" dur="5.25">defendant mr. Dreeben says Dreeben for</text>
  <text start="1975.2" dur="4.32">the special counsel well your honor</text>
  <text start="1976.82" dur="5.13">where the Justice Department we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1979.52" dur="4.97">then to me when he starts doing this it</text>
  <text start="1981.95" dur="7.52">seems a</text>
  <text start="1984.49" dur="6.66">pretty disrespectful in my opinion we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1989.47" dur="3.63">not separate from the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="1991.15" dur="3.84">the acting Attorney General appointed us</text>
  <text start="1993.1" dur="3.39">to complete investigations and to</text>
  <text start="1994.99" dur="4.74">conduct the investigation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1996.49" dur="4.86">described in this order in addition the</text>
  <text start="1999.73" dur="3.48">acting Attorney General has made clear</text>
  <text start="2001.35" dur="4.26">in testimony before Congress which I</text>
  <text start="2003.21" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t find that this order does not</text>
  <text start="2005.61" dur="3.9">reflect the details of the matters that</text>
  <text start="2007.53" dur="5.49">were assigned to us for investigation</text>
  <text start="2009.51" dur="5.549">and the word quote arose from that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2013.02" dur="3.39">contained in B is not a full and</text>
  <text start="2015.059" dur="3.211">complete description that&amp;#39;s meant to be</text>
  <text start="2016.41" dur="3.66">judicially enforceable of the matters</text>
  <text start="2018.27" dur="3.33">that were entrusted and the court says</text>
  <text start="2020.07" dur="3.78">so it&amp;#39;s written by lawyers but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2021.6" dur="4.23">intended to be enforceable and then</text>
  <text start="2023.85" dur="4.23">Dreeben says it&amp;#39;s certainly not intended</text>
  <text start="2025.83" dur="4.26">to be judicially and the court says I</text>
  <text start="2028.08" dur="3.81">think you&amp;#39;re better off arguing that</text>
  <text start="2030.09" dur="3.839">it&amp;#39;s very broad and that the matters are</text>
  <text start="2031.89" dur="3.48">here that that are here are well within</text>

  <text start="2037.559" dur="3.87">pay any attention to the scope of it</text>
  <text start="2039.09" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s not very persuasive to say the</text>
  <text start="2041.429" dur="3.571">least what we don&amp;#39;t want in this country</text>
  <text start="2043.14" dur="2.34">is we don&amp;#39;t want anyone with unfettered</text>

  <text start="2056.1" dur="2.7">unlikely you&amp;#39;re going to persuade me</text>
  <text start="2057.48" dur="3.81">that the special prosecutor has</text>
  <text start="2058.8" dur="6.39">unlimited powers of anything he or she</text>
  <text start="2061.29" dur="7.589">wants by the way your office was a point</text>
  <text start="2065.19" dur="5.31">did you say back in May 2017 is there</text>
  <text start="2068.879" dur="3.421">any requirement that you make reports</text>
  <text start="2070.5" dur="4.47">periodically to the Attorney General</text>

  <text start="2076.859" dur="4.111">he can&amp;#39;t talk about it okay I understand</text>
  <text start="2078.659" dur="5.581">it&amp;#39;s not pertinent they talk about a</text>

  <text start="2091.8" dur="4.23">judge I loved reading him so then he</text>
  <text start="2094.95" dur="2.55">says all right I think you answer my</text>
  <text start="2096.03" dur="2.7">questions mr. Dreeben if you want to say</text>
  <text start="2097.5" dur="3.09">anything else now of course you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2098.73" dur="4.05">have a full opportunity to respond to</text>

  <text start="2102.78" dur="3.36">preliminary questions which I think</text>
  <text start="2104.04" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;ve answered and then Dreeben says I</text>
  <text start="2106.14" dur="3.39">think we should clarify one thing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2107.91" dur="3.72">not operating with unfettered power</text>

  <text start="2320.71" dur="3.57">much in there so we&amp;#39;re not operating off</text>
  <text start="2322.9" dur="4.32">of the range of what the acting Attorney</text>

  <text start="2353.08" dur="3.69">basically what Ellis is saying is that</text>
  <text start="2354.79" dur="4.23">these guys are operating as like an</text>
  <text start="2356.77" dur="4.32">independent counsel which is has been a</text>
  <text start="2359.02" dur="4.35">historical point of contention for a</text>

  <text start="2369.88" dur="2.67">in the description box of a couple</text>
  <text start="2371.29" dur="3.18">articles that explain how the</text>

  <text start="2377.92" dur="4.59">three judges a lot has changed in terms</text>
  <text start="2380.29" dur="4.89">of this over the years going back from</text>
  <text start="2382.51" dur="4.819">Watergate onward and there&amp;#39;s a history</text>
  <text start="2385.18" dur="4.53">there that you guys should really thumb</text>
  <text start="2387.329" dur="5.051">you should really take the time to kind</text>
  <text start="2389.71" dur="4.5">of form it it&amp;#39;s a lot of it you should</text>
  <text start="2392.38" dur="4.77">take the time to familiarize yourself</text>
  <text start="2394.21" dur="4.53">with it but basically the Dreeben is</text>
  <text start="2397.15" dur="3.12">arguing that the Special Counsel is</text>
  <text start="2398.74" dur="5.16">accountable to the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="2400.27" dur="5.22">and is not a rogue prosecutor and the</text>
  <text start="2403.9" dur="3.57">judge is saying they&amp;#39;re acting like a</text>
  <text start="2405.49" dur="3.93">rogue prosecutor when he says that</text>
  <text start="2407.47" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re like an independent counsel so</text>
  <text start="2409.42" dur="5.699">that&amp;#39;s the gist of it there now the</text>
  <text start="2413.71" dur="5.25">court says I&amp;#39;ve heard everything from</text>
  <text start="2415.119" dur="7.351">them defendant tell me what you think go</text>

  <text start="2429.94" dur="4.95">reading what&amp;#39;s in the brief and then</text>
  <text start="2431.77" dur="7.049">they go through what reminiscing about</text>

  <text start="2440.859" dur="4.171">forth from this judge who likes to</text>
  <text start="2442.24" dur="5.01">reminisce apparently so he says the</text>
  <text start="2445.03" dur="3.63">judge says tell me why you&amp;#39;ve heard him</text>
  <text start="2447.25" dur="3.66">say I mean their argument is fairly</text>
  <text start="2448.66" dur="5.58">straightforward they say you look at the</text>
  <text start="2450.91" dur="4.77">may 17th letter it says any links and/or</text>

  <text start="2780.88" dur="4.96">let me ask you so what in other words is</text>
  <text start="2784.52" dur="2.85">what you&amp;#39;re arguing that the use of the</text>
  <text start="2785.84" dur="3.78">investigation in this case is contrary</text>
  <text start="2787.37" dur="3.87">to the regulation that requires the</text>
  <text start="2789.62" dur="3.39">acting Attorney General here to be</text>
  <text start="2791.24" dur="3.54">specific about what areas he wants</text>
  <text start="2793.01" dur="3.57">investigated and you&amp;#39;re saying he was</text>
  <text start="2794.78" dur="3.9">too general and this supplemental</text>
  <text start="2796.58" dur="4.37">doesn&amp;#39;t he remedy that in the August 2</text>
  <text start="2798.68" dur="4.68">letter and this is the point that really</text>
  <text start="2800.95" dur="5.2">gets me and I think is really</text>
  <text start="2803.36" dur="5.88">interesting he can&amp;#39;t retroactively Lee</text>
  <text start="2806.15" dur="4.92">remedy it the question is as of that</text>
  <text start="2809.24" dur="3.84">date what he did does it give</text>
  <text start="2811.07" dur="4.23">jurisdiction to the Special Counsel or</text>
  <text start="2813.08" dur="4.05">is it still so unrelated to the specific</text>

  <text start="2818.9" dur="7.14">that&amp;#39;s the question</text>
  <text start="2821.05" dur="6.82">doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s related the idea</text>
  <text start="2826.04" dur="3.84">here is to keep a narrow jurisdiction on</text>
  <text start="2827.87" dur="4.82">the special counsel to not end up with</text>
  <text start="2829.88" dur="5.22">another independent counsel when you see</text>
  <text start="2832.69" dur="5.02">b2 it looks like another independent</text>

  <text start="2845.53" dur="6.37">the court entered now this is important</text>
  <text start="2848.12" dur="5.7">because that that memo came out what you</text>
  <text start="2851.9" dur="7.08">know came out after about the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="2853.82" dur="6.66">and they can&amp;#39;t retroactively lis include</text>
  <text start="2858.98" dur="3.09">that when they had already indicted so</text>
  <text start="2860.48" dur="2.82">we can&amp;#39;t go back and retroactively lis</text>
  <text start="2862.07" dur="3.09">make a claim on that when they had</text>
  <text start="2863.3" dur="4.23">already used it you like what what the</text>

  <text start="2879.07" dur="7.78">so blackhat the whole entire government</text>

  <text start="2932.11" dur="5.04">this is another important part we make I</text>
  <text start="2935.8" dur="2.49">think one point for the court and I</text>
  <text start="2937.15" dur="2.64">think it&amp;#39;s an important point the</text>
  <text start="2938.29" dur="2.85">government had argued initially that</text>
  <text start="2939.79" dur="2.97">these matters arose during their</text>
  <text start="2941.14" dur="3.36">investigation and I went through all</text>
  <text start="2942.76" dur="3.75">that paperwork Tracy speaking here and</text>
  <text start="2944.5" dur="3.18">there right they argued that they found</text>
  <text start="2946.51" dur="3.51">this stuff in the course of their</text>
  <text start="2947.68" dur="4.17">investigation I think and then he goes</text>
  <text start="2950.02" dur="3.75">back down he says I think the government</text>
  <text start="2951.85" dur="3.87">is now admitting to know they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2953.77" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s a big admission and it wasn&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="2955.72" dur="3.48">their papers all the way up to being in</text>
  <text start="2957.64" dur="2.91">court here today I haven&amp;#39;t heard the</text>
  <text start="2959.2" dur="4.53">government admit to the court that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2960.55" dur="4.74">exactly what happened it looks like that</text>
  <text start="2963.73" dur="3.06">they grabbed these investigations from</text>
  <text start="2965.29" dur="4.77">other components of the Department of</text>
  <text start="2966.79" dur="4.95">Justice in their papers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2970.06" dur="4.32">arguing they came upon this during their</text>
  <text start="2971.74" dur="4.98">investigation that&amp;#39;s not the facts so</text>
  <text start="2974.38" dur="3.78">I&amp;#39;d like to make the record clear that</text>
  <text start="2976.72" dur="4.26">their arguments in their brief are</text>
  <text start="2978.16" dur="4.41">absolutely erroneous it didn&amp;#39;t arise</text>
  <text start="2980.98" dur="3.42">during it and I think that matters</text>
  <text start="2982.57" dur="3.15">because their other argument was well</text>
  <text start="2984.4" dur="3.18">this whole thing falls into the first</text>
  <text start="2985.72" dur="3.96">specific description which I think</text>
  <text start="2987.58" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;ve pointing out in no way does it</text>
  <text start="2989.68" dur="3.929">make any sense that it falls into the</text>
  <text start="2991.21" dur="4.47">first description and finally when you</text>
  <text start="2993.609" dur="4.351">look and you go and look at rosin rosin</text>
  <text start="2995.68" dur="4.32">Steen&amp;#39;s memo it&amp;#39;s very odd for when it</text>
  <text start="2997.96" dur="3.75">occurs but the most obvious omission</text>
  <text start="3000" dur="4.5">from it is that it doesn&amp;#39;t say as we</text>
  <text start="3001.71" dur="4.32">agreed or as we discussed it just puts</text>
  <text start="3004.5" dur="3.72">something in a point in time with no</text>
  <text start="3006.03" dur="4.92">relation back to when it happened on or</text>
  <text start="3008.22" dur="4.2">before May 17th and just what and what</text>
  <text start="3010.95" dur="2.88">he&amp;#39;s basically the attorney is basically</text>
  <text start="3012.42" dur="4.5">saying they&amp;#39;re trying to cover their ass</text>
  <text start="3013.83" dur="5.64">and they don&amp;#39;t reference a deed of what</text>
  <text start="3016.92" dur="5.54">had happened which is a big deal and a</text>
  <text start="3019.47" dur="5.66">big point and it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="3022.46" dur="5.53">excuse me madam fort fan or not and just</text>
  <text start="3025.13" dur="4.449">one other issue the government continues</text>
  <text start="3027.99" dur="2.76">to refer to these regulations is no</text>
  <text start="3029.579" dur="2.851">different than something that would be</text>
  <text start="3030.75" dur="5.4">in the US Attorney&amp;#39;s manual or a written</text>
  <text start="3032.43" dur="5.85">policy this is interesting too obviously</text>
  <text start="3036.15" dur="3.78">the Department of Justice for some time</text>
  <text start="3038.28" dur="3.39">and the Attorney General decided to make</text>
  <text start="3039.93" dur="3.48">these special council regulations they</text>
  <text start="3041.67" dur="3.54">didn&amp;#39;t make it a policy they didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="3043.41" dur="3.57">it a procedure they didn&amp;#39;t put it in the</text>
  <text start="3045.21" dur="4.109">US Attorney&amp;#39;s manual they made it a</text>
  <text start="3046.98" dur="3.99">regulation and they did it publicly to</text>
  <text start="3049.319" dur="3.27">say to the country to Congress and to</text>
  <text start="3050.97" dur="4.109">the courts and the land that this is how</text>
  <text start="3052.589" dur="4.381">we&amp;#39;re going to conduct ourselves the</text>
  <text start="3055.079" dur="3.301">Attorney General certainly at points in</text>
  <text start="3056.97" dur="3.33">time could have taken that right back</text>
  <text start="3058.38" dur="3.81">but he never did he left it on the books</text>
  <text start="3060.3" dur="3.36">they promulgate that these regs are</text>
  <text start="3062.19" dur="2.909">controlling the office of the Special</text>
  <text start="3063.66" dur="3.209">Counsel and a public notice their</text>
  <text start="3065.099" dur="4.051">appointment order so they tell the world</text>
  <text start="3066.869" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t worry about it we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="3069.15" dur="3">end up with this runaway special counsel</text>
  <text start="3070.829" dur="3.151">like we&amp;#39;ve seen with the independent</text>
  <text start="3072.15" dur="3.9">counsel when they come to court they say</text>
  <text start="3073.98" dur="2.849">by the way these are not judicially</text>
  <text start="3076.05" dur="2.34">enforceable</text>
  <text start="3076.829" dur="3.151">it&amp;#39;s as if they hoodwinked the entire</text>
  <text start="3078.39" dur="2.55">United States into thinking that this</text>
  <text start="3079.98" dur="4.29">was going to be different than the</text>
  <text start="3080.94" dur="4.74">independent counsel it&amp;#39;s so true I think</text>
  <text start="3084.27" dur="2.789">it&amp;#39;s very important for the government</text>
  <text start="3085.68" dur="2.85">to be held accountable just like the</text>
  <text start="3087.059" dur="4.141">government was and the Department of</text>
  <text start="3088.53" dur="4.559">Justice was in us.first Nixon you put</text>
  <text start="3091.2" dur="3.419">these regulations out there you tell in</text>

  <text start="3095.97" dur="4.2">citizens you can rely upon us conducting</text>
  <text start="3098.28" dur="3.96">ourselves in this manner then they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3100.17" dur="3.389">and they don&amp;#39;t produce a record and then</text>
  <text start="3102.24" dur="2.94">they say to this court and they say to</text>
  <text start="3103.559" dur="5.31">metaphor and they say to the country</text>
  <text start="3105.18" dur="10.61">guess what it&amp;#39;s not enforceable and I</text>
  <text start="3108.869" dur="6.921">don&amp;#39;t think that can stand so</text>
  <text start="3116.11" dur="7.06">Dreeben comes back and he basically says</text>
  <text start="3121.06" dur="3.52">we couldn&amp;#39;t announce these things</text>

  <text start="3189.74" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s not really appropriate to assume</text>

  <text start="3195.2" dur="5.22">contemplate basically he&amp;#39;s saying just</text>
  <text start="3198.92" dur="3.12">because it said that there doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="3200.42" dur="4.29">we have to follow along with it and this</text>
  <text start="3202.04" dur="4.77">dude the judge is saying come on that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3204.71" dur="3.09">ridiculous your argument that we said</text>
  <text start="3206.81" dur="3.09">this was the scope of the investigation</text>
  <text start="3207.8" dur="4.32">but we really didn&amp;#39;t mean it because we</text>
  <text start="3209.9" dur="4.52">weren&amp;#39;t required to say what the scope</text>
  <text start="3212.12" dur="2.3">was</text>
  <text start="3221.39" dur="9.929">and then they try to explain away all of</text>
  <text start="3227.239" dur="8.52">this and they&amp;#39;re basically you know</text>
  <text start="3231.319" dur="7.92">arguing back and forth what the scope is</text>
  <text start="3235.759" dur="5.76">and what it does I&amp;#39;m trying to I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3239.239" dur="6.53">trying to skip through here at the end</text>
  <text start="3241.519" dur="6.3">now but what it basically goes on to say</text>
  <text start="3245.769" dur="4.69">you&amp;#39;re on a refer to the fact they were</text>
  <text start="3247.819" dur="4.29">ongoing invested in Vesta Kotori matters</text>
  <text start="3250.459" dur="3.181">that concern mr. Matta fort before the</text>
  <text start="3252.109" dur="3.18">appointment of the council but the</text>
  <text start="3253.64" dur="4.199">investigation that the special council</text>
  <text start="3255.289" dur="3.81">has conducted has considerably advanced</text>
  <text start="3257.839" dur="2.13">and deepened our understanding of the</text>
  <text start="3259.099" dur="3.781">matters that have been previously</text>
  <text start="3259.969" dur="5.971">identified so now he&amp;#39;s saying that they</text>
  <text start="3262.88" dur="5.01">have enhanced that investigation so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3265.94" dur="4.2">now theirs and the judge is going to say</text>
  <text start="3267.89" dur="3.899">but that was handed over to you you</text>
  <text start="3270.14" dur="3.3">didn&amp;#39;t come across this stuff as you</text>
  <text start="3271.789" dur="3.871">were looking into mr. Madoff or someone</text>

  <text start="3275.66" dur="6.329">not arise from the investigation so what</text>
  <text start="3279.709" dur="5.221">basically is is basically they get to at</text>
  <text start="3281.989" dur="5.22">the end is they they argue that Rose</text>
  <text start="3284.93" dur="6.569">ensign has to have some kind of</text>
  <text start="3287.209" dur="6.54">documents that he wrote or he you know</text>
  <text start="3291.499" dur="4.381">this attorney for metaphor it worked</text>
  <text start="3293.749" dur="3.81">underneath him and knows how he works</text>
  <text start="3295.88" dur="3.989">they want to see the records of what</text>

  <text start="3299.869" dur="9.24">say that word because you guys what he</text>

  <text start="3309.109" dur="7.581">the cause of the special counsel being</text>
  <text start="3310.489" dur="9.09">appointed in the first place you know</text>
  <text start="3316.69" dur="4.539">basically what what caused this all to</text>
  <text start="3319.579" dur="3.72">happen in the first place why did this</text>
  <text start="3321.229" dur="5.34">all happen he wants the unredacted</text>

  <text start="3404.43" dur="3.9">the same you know language the the</text>
  <text start="3406.71" dur="4.94">special counsel says respectfully we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3408.33" dur="3.32">not going to discuss any of that stuff</text>
  <text start="3412.01" dur="4.39">with respect I&amp;#39;m not liberty to go into</text>
  <text start="3414.27" dur="5.79">internal prosecutorial matters within</text>
  <text start="3416.4" dur="4.92">the Department of Justice and then the</text>
  <text start="3420.06" dur="3.15">court says did you do it because you</text>
  <text start="3421.32" dur="3.84">concluded that it uncovered materials</text>
  <text start="3423.21" dur="3.45">that really weren&amp;#39;t within the scope or</text>
  <text start="3425.16" dur="2.88">did you do it because you weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3426.66" dur="3.449">interested in it because we can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="3428.04" dur="4.79">this to further our core effort which is</text>
  <text start="3430.109" dur="2.721">to get to trump</text>
  <text start="3442.27" dur="3.849">and then he basically says we take very</text>
  <text start="3444.71" dur="2.58">seriously the primary mission that was</text>
  <text start="3446.119" dur="3.901">assigned to us by the acting Attorney</text>
  <text start="3447.29" dur="5.1">General in May which is to investigate</text>
  <text start="3450.02" dur="4.38">but not prosecute necessarily unless</text>
  <text start="3452.39" dur="3.719">there&amp;#39;s a crime but to investigate</text>
  <text start="3454.4" dur="3.75">Russia&amp;#39;s interference with the 2016</text>
  <text start="3456.109" dur="3.451">election and links our coordination that</text>
  <text start="3458.15" dur="3">may have occurred with individuals</text>
  <text start="3459.56" dur="3.51">associated with the campaign of Trump</text>
  <text start="3461.15" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re focused on that mission</text>
  <text start="3463.07" dur="5.52">we may uncover other criminal activity</text>
  <text start="3466.01" dur="4.62">that is necessary for us to investigate</text>
  <text start="3468.59" dur="3.99">in order to complete that mission we may</text>
  <text start="3470.63" dur="4.05">uncover criminal activity that is not</text>
  <text start="3472.58" dur="3.75">necessary for us to investigate but is</text>
  <text start="3474.68" dur="6.179">still appropriately investigated by a</text>
  <text start="3476.33" dur="8.43">different component of the department so</text>
  <text start="3480.859" dur="6.661">what is that saying about what metaphor</text>
  <text start="3484.76" dur="5.21">it&amp;#39;s up to and why this Ukraine stuff is</text>
  <text start="3487.52" dur="9.5">under scope but the Cohen stuff is not</text>
  <text start="3489.97" dur="7.05">hmm I don&amp;#39;t know but that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
