  <text start="87.319" dur="6.311">fentanyl interesting topic caused a lot</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="6.66">of controversy over the past couple days</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="6.36">24 hours or so for me and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="98.58" dur="2.91">share it with you guys what&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="3.75">on so I&amp;#39;m going to tell you what I found</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="3.689">in the beginning and then I&amp;#39;m gonna lay</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="3.9">it all out for you guys in black and</text>
  <text start="105.179" dur="4.711">white going on there was an article that</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="5.819">came out that the Mexican government</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="7.679">seized a major fentanyl shipment from</text>
  <text start="113.459" dur="7.741">China in Mexico over 20 25 tons of</text>
  <text start="117.569" dur="6.33">fentanyl seized from Shang seized from</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="6.66">Mexico on its way to the sinal Sinaloa</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="7.17">cartel twenty five point seven five tons</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="7.2">of this seized in Mexico that originated</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="4.981">it from Shanghai China now Donald</text>
  <text start="135.06" dur="3.39">Trump&amp;#39;s were talking about what a</text>
  <text start="136.05" dur="4.14">problem fentanyl is it is a very very</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="4.71">very yes it&amp;#39;ll be different than the</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="7.829">podcast it is a very very dangerous drug</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="7.7">and he has been talking about it for a</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="4.771">long time now and what what kind of</text>
  <text start="150.86" dur="4.54">detriment it is so there was a threat</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="4.8">done by brian on twitter after ryan</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="4.169">Saavedra tweeted this article brian</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="3.39">Cates did a threaded talking about just</text>
  <text start="159.569" dur="4.861">how much fentanyl we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="9.149">here how many people it can kill which</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="9.959">it could basically wipe out everyone in</text>
  <text start="170.129" dur="6.181">this country this is 25 tons and I said</text>
  <text start="174.389" dur="5.281">because I had read over the past several</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="6.3">months I&amp;#39;ve read that fentanyl</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="6.92">is actually affecting law enforcement</text>
  <text start="182.61" dur="6.87">agents and first responders because</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="5.17">they&amp;#39;re coming in contact with it there</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="5.04">are reports out there that them touching</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="7.47">it or inhaling it is causing them to to</text>
  <text start="194.52" dur="7.47">overdose and what a problem it is on the</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="4.02">go production how&amp;#39;s that better turn up</text>
  <text start="201.99" dur="9.92">the volume a little bit on my end here</text>
  <text start="203.25" dur="10.89">so this should be better so basically</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="4.329">first responders are coming in contact</text>
  <text start="214.14" dur="4.379">with this drug which you need like a</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="6.171">tiny little amount of to overdose look</text>
  <text start="218.519" dur="10.021">this is heroin versus fentanyl right and</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="7.99">I added to the equation that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="3.66">have to be the one taking it to die from</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="4.26">it you can die if you inhale it or it</text>
  <text start="232.2" dur="5.67">gets on your skin and I made a point to</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="4.74">talk about how horrible this is and how</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="4.26">dangerous it is to the public at large</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="5.49">to the first responders you know going</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="5.22">to these calls and an interesting thing</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="5.52">started happening where a lot of people</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="4.41">came to my thread and started telling me</text>
  <text start="250.41" dur="3.27">that I was wrong and sharing</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="4.38">misinformation and that it wasn&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="3.989">and that any of those none of those</text>
  <text start="256.14" dur="4.849">reports have been confirmed with</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="5.851">toxicology reporting and that it was</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="4.541">dangerous or misleading for me to be</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="5.58">saying this and you know once you get a</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="6.48">bunch of these comments from different</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="6.06">people many of which were doctors and</text>
  <text start="272.01" dur="6.18">anesthesiologist who were nasty nasty</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="8.129">people I gotta be honest you start to</text>
  <text start="278.19" dur="6.81">question hmm what is the what is the</text>
  <text start="283.289" dur="5.161">deal here what is this all about</text>
  <text start="285" dur="5.31">am I wrong is it misinformation is there</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="3.42">something else causing this let me look</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="4.44">into it further so that&amp;#39;s what I did and</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="4.53">what I found was this that it is a mix</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="3.81">of truth between the people that are</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="3.9">saying first responders can overdose and</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="4.89">die from this and the people that are</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="6.619">saying that they cannot and I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="303.45" dur="5.91">through the compelling reasons on both</text>
  <text start="306.919" dur="4.541">some of the points that the people</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="3.809">saying that this was misinformation and</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="4.949">dangerous to be spreading</text>
  <text start="313.169" dur="7.381">made were that fentanyl cannot be</text>
  <text start="316.409" dur="8.19">absorbed into your skin by skin to</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="5.88">powder contact and cause you any harm at</text>
  <text start="324.599" dur="2.551">all that you can wash it off with soap</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="3.81">and water</text>
  <text start="327.15" dur="6.12">that it is not a danger to law</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="5.399">enforcement in that form and that it</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="5.299">molecular Li cannot happen it cannot be</text>
  <text start="335.639" dur="5.971">passed through your skin in that way</text>
  <text start="338.569" dur="5.53">they also people who were opponents of</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="7.44">my thread where I cite the law</text>
  <text start="344.099" dur="7.891">enforcement examples also said that you</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="4.709">need exposure to the substance when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.99" dur="4.169">touching you hours and hours and hours</text>
  <text start="353.759" dur="4.921">that there was a patch developed and the</text>
  <text start="356.159" dur="4.41">technology and the patch for fentanyl</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="4.669">isn&amp;#39;t even good enough and that uses</text>
  <text start="360.569" dur="7.051">moisture to transmit into your skin and</text>
  <text start="363.349" dur="6.28">so look I just wanted to get to the</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="3.69">bottom of it I don&amp;#39;t give a crap if you</text>
  <text start="369.629" dur="3.57">fall on the left side of the spectrum or</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="3.12">the right side of the spectrum I just</text>
  <text start="373.199" dur="3.9">want to know what the hell is going on</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="5.88">with this right now I just want to know</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="5.611">what the hell is going on is it a threat</text>
  <text start="380.31" dur="5.52">for our law enforcement officers is it</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="5.069">not if it&amp;#39;s not why are all these law</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="3.63">enforcement officers going to the</text>
  <text start="387.779" dur="4.29">hospital after being on these calls with</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="5.91">these symptoms and what&amp;#39;s the deal so</text>
  <text start="392.069" dur="6.291">let&amp;#39;s go through some of the</text>
  <text start="395.37" dur="7.079">misinformation disinformation and fact</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="6.01">so we get the story one of the one of</text>
  <text start="402.449" dur="3.631">the articles or one of these studies</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="5.729">that everybody was telling me to take a</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="9.6">look at was done by I believe the</text>
  <text start="410.099" dur="7.921">American College of toxicity and here</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="5.219">the American College of medical toxicity</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="7.59">and this right here is the gold standard</text>
  <text start="420.899" dur="7.17">in studies that people use to cite the</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="4.5">disinformation that was put out by even</text>
  <text start="428.069" dur="5.25">the government on first responders</text>
  <text start="430.11" dur="6.539">responding to these sorts of calls for</text>
  <text start="433.319" dur="8.671">overdoses or for you know drug calls in</text>
  <text start="436.649" dur="7.651">general and what they say is this they</text>
  <text start="441.99" dur="6.11">have an article that&amp;#39;s the wrong link</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="3.8">hold on it was this one I wanted oh</text>
  <text start="449.6" dur="11.68">sorry guys</text>
  <text start="451.02" dur="14.52">bear with me fentanyl and its analogs</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="7.73">are potent opioid receptor agonists but</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="6">the risk of clinically significant</text>
  <text start="469.01" dur="6.25">exposure to emergency responders is</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="5.37">extremely low to date we have not seen</text>
  <text start="475.26" dur="3.12">reports of emergency responders</text>

  <text start="528.6" dur="5.97">for vague concerns such as dizziness or</text>
  <text start="530.96" dur="6.16">anxiety so they go into a lot of like</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="4.77">reasons why what they&amp;#39;re saying is true</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="5.19">scientifically their methodology the</text>

  <text start="558.24" dur="4.32">subdue hostage-takers of a Moscow</text>
  <text start="559.95" dur="5.13">theater in 2002 basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="4.38">saying is if this is weaponized with our</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="3.54">salt or aerosolized and sprayed into the</text>
  <text start="566.94" dur="5.82">air it&amp;#39;s very dangerous</text>
  <text start="568.62" dur="5.91">they don&amp;#39;t really comment on airborne</text>
  <text start="572.76" dur="4.64">particles that are dry like if somebody</text>
  <text start="574.53" dur="2.87">blew it in your face</text>
  <text start="577.51" dur="7.05">they say how incidental dermal</text>
  <text start="581.93" dur="5.07">absorption is unlikely to cause toxicity</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="4.51">and talk about how the patches would</text>
  <text start="587" dur="4.02">need to cover a certain surface area of</text>
  <text start="589.07" dur="5.06">your body and sit there for like hours</text>
  <text start="591.02" dur="7.74">and hours and hours to even receive a</text>
  <text start="594.13" dur="6.42">hundred mcg of fentanyl and they go</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="7.68">through the study around it and</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="9.94">basically every other study that I found</text>
  <text start="606.44" dur="8.52">or article that I found references this</text>
  <text start="610.49" dur="6.6">one position paper honestly I have a</text>
  <text start="614.96" dur="4.56">list here of all the no chance this is</text>
  <text start="617.09" dur="4.38">actually possible articles I have about</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="4.92">20 of them that say there&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="621.47" dur="6.63">no way that any first responders could</text>
  <text start="624.44" dur="6.54">ever get any of this could ever harm</text>
  <text start="628.1" dur="4.62">first responders basically here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="630.98" dur="3.87">harm reduction coalition who have done a</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="3.66">lot of work on this all over the country</text>
  <text start="634.85" dur="4.41">there are Czech chapters of them</text>
  <text start="636.38" dur="5.19">everywhere they say perpetuating stigma</text>
  <text start="639.26" dur="4.2">causing harm and they talk about stories</text>
  <text start="641.57" dur="2.88">that detail an incident where two</text>
  <text start="643.46" dur="2.61">Sheriff&amp;#39;s Department personnel</text>
  <text start="644.45" dur="3.78">experience the effects of fentanyl</text>
  <text start="646.07" dur="3.78">exposure and the articles vary greatly</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="3.24">in their accounts of what drugs were</text>
  <text start="649.85" dur="3.57">present at the scene and what symptoms</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="4.35">were exhibited but they all contain</text>
  <text start="653.42" dur="4.44">misinformation inaccuracies about</text>
  <text start="655.82" dur="2.82">Sentinel and overdose and perpetuate</text>
  <text start="657.86" dur="3">fear-based</text>
  <text start="658.64" dur="4.65">messaging that stigmatized people who</text>
  <text start="660.86" dur="5.28">use drugs and I&amp;#39;ll be honest with you at</text>
  <text start="663.29" dur="6.69">the core of all of this at the core of</text>
  <text start="666.14" dur="5.37">all of this is a comparison and</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="3.63">interwoven throughout all of these</text>
  <text start="671.51" dur="4.76">articles is a comparison to what</text>
  <text start="673.61" dur="4.56">happened with the AIDS virus where</text>
  <text start="676.27" dur="3.52">misinformation was out there that it</text>
  <text start="678.17" dur="3.66">could be spread from contact and it</text>
  <text start="679.79" dur="3.39">stigmatized the entire thing and then</text>
  <text start="681.83" dur="3.48">people supposedly weren&amp;#39;t getting</text>
  <text start="683.18" dur="4.5">treatment and they were cast aside and</text>
  <text start="685.31" dur="4.14">all of that and I have to be honest with</text>
  <text start="687.68" dur="3.96">you it&amp;#39;s not the same thing in my</text>
  <text start="689.45" dur="6.42">opinion because what these people are</text>
  <text start="691.64" dur="8.07">basically saying is that people people</text>
  <text start="695.87" dur="5.49">who are overdosing on fentanyl many of</text>
  <text start="699.71" dur="3.66">whom don&amp;#39;t realize they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="701.36" dur="4.38">fentanyl and are taking some other drug</text>
  <text start="703.37" dur="4.8">which is laced with fentanyl which is an</text>
  <text start="705.74" dur="4.74">entire another story that we can get</text>
  <text start="708.17" dur="2.82">into another time are not getting the</text>
  <text start="710.48" dur="2.28">life-saving</text>
  <text start="710.99" dur="4.02">treatment they need in a rapid fashion</text>
  <text start="712.76" dur="4.59">because seconds count here because</text>
  <text start="715.01" dur="4.86">officers are protecting themselves in</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="5.16">gear before they&amp;#39;re going in to take</text>
  <text start="719.87" dur="5.49">care of these people who are overdosing</text>
  <text start="722.51" dur="6.329">thereby risking these people&amp;#39;s lives</text>

  <text start="2150.61" dur="7.02">and that&amp;#39;s only because I read article</text>

  <text start="2162.22" dur="7.38">living daylights out of me I think that</text>
  <text start="2167.77" dur="5.52">we should all be able to agree that</text>
  <text start="2169.6" dur="5.55">fentanyl is a big problem and arguing</text>
  <text start="2173.29" dur="3.96">about whether our first responders</text>

  <text start="2233.829" dur="5.46">flat out number three I think that every</text>

  <text start="2239.289" dur="5.421">were reading that I&amp;#39;ve been reading and</text>

  <text start="2250.66" dur="3.6">one of their colleagues opened up a</text>
  <text start="2252.13" dur="4.29">package and a puff of this stuff came</text>
  <text start="2254.26" dur="5.849">out and they breathed it in and here we</text>
  <text start="2256.42" dur="7.349">have some jerk sitting there talking</text>
  <text start="2260.109" dur="7.321">about how she&amp;#39;s wrong and her co-worker</text>

  <text start="2309.789" dur="6.211">toxicology on these officers that are</text>
  <text start="2311.92" dur="5.639">claiming to be exposed maybe that would</text>
  <text start="2316" dur="3.359">help because if they all come back</text>
  <text start="2317.559" dur="5.25">negative then we can lend more credence</text>
  <text start="2319.359" dur="5.94">to the panic attack theory and EMS as</text>

  <text start="2325.299" dur="5.941">first responders in general but I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="2364.55" dur="4.68">that being careful is good I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2367.61" dur="4.59">that first responders are running away</text>
  <text start="2369.23" dur="6.35">from these calls like they deal with</text>
  <text start="2372.2" dur="6.03">with they run into danger 24 hours a day</text>
  <text start="2375.58" dur="5.04">but fentanyl is causing them to run in</text>
  <text start="2378.23" dur="6.51">the other direction they face gunshots</text>
  <text start="2380.62" dur="6.73">murderers terrorists all kinds of</text>
  <text start="2384.74" dur="5.01">horrible situations every day head on</text>
  <text start="2387.35" dur="9">but fentanyl gives them power to panic</text>

  <text start="2450.71" dur="4.83">presents to their personal safety so</text>
  <text start="2453.2" dur="6.78">basically the this can&amp;#39;t happen people</text>
  <text start="2455.54" dur="6.09">are arguing against arguing against the</text>
  <text start="2459.98" dur="7.5">fact that it can harm first responders</text>
