  <text start="30.9" dur="6.24">year dark to light podcast Val you know</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="4.47">you took me off-guard by that I</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="5.009">completely am I forgot</text>
  <text start="39.6" dur="4.889">first of all it was weird yes I did the</text>
  <text start="42.149" dur="4.951">second of January it already felt like</text>
  <text start="44.489" dur="4.59">the seventh of January it&amp;#39;s very I</text>
  <text start="47.1" dur="3.689">stopped I bored usually I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="3.921">people happy new year for another couple</text>
  <text start="50.789" dur="2.211">of days</text>
  <text start="54.739" dur="5.351">let&amp;#39;s go I mean the last week the last</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="4.169">week has been enough to fill a month</text>
  <text start="60.09" dur="4.77">no for real and not only that but like</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="6.12">you know we started the new year off</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="5.579">with a bang literally and so a lot of</text>
  <text start="68.729" dur="6.32">what we talk about today is gonna center</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="7.561">around that I I want to make like this</text>
  <text start="75.049" dur="4.781">blanket statement I tweeted this morning</text>
  <text start="78" dur="3.9">and again I&amp;#39;m gonna pick up the phone</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="6.149">here and do my thing like I normally do</text>
  <text start="81.9" dur="9.42">but I tweeted this morning um this I</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="7.231">said all of these experts saying are we</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="4.259">prepared for what comes next how could</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="5.43">we do this with no plan I think the</text>
  <text start="95.579" dur="4.921">point is that nobody has any idea what</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="3.39">the heck the plan is which is exactly</text>
  <text start="100.5" dur="3.689">what the president wants and what he</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="6.449">telegraphed from the beginning all that</text>
  <text start="104.189" dur="6.21">being said I am not at all an expert on</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.011">foreign policy or foreign entanglements</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="4.441">or military stuff or anything if you</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="5.25">guys need to know something about</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="6.15">domestic politics ask me anything</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="8.4">but when it comes to this stuff I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="7.439">your expert I&amp;#39;m not Frank you know not</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="5.59">especially not when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="7.151">Middle East absolutely not it I just</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="5.009">my internet connection is unstable so I</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="4.379">got same connection problem over here or</text>
  <text start="137.739" dur="4.89">at least we&amp;#39;ve got the same thing all</text>
  <text start="139.959" dur="5.61">right I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m still on though</text>
  <text start="142.629" dur="5.94">but whatever I mean you know when it</text>
  <text start="145.569" dur="4.95">comes to all this stuff I I feel like</text>
  <text start="148.569" dur="4.321">there&amp;#39;s only three ways it&amp;#39;s a three-way</text>
  <text start="150.519" dur="7.231">split wherever you see and of course</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="7.709">we&amp;#39;re talking about Iran and Iraq but I</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="4.65">see a through a split you have those who</text>
  <text start="160.599" dur="4.5">are pretty much opposed to anything that</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="4.38">Trump does just just because and then</text>
  <text start="165.099" dur="3.961">those who that this is great and then</text>
  <text start="166.78" dur="6.98">those who think that this is being a</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="8.28">puppet and I like I like you I just</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="6.91">don&amp;#39;t know enough to I&amp;#39;m so I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="4.649">interested Lee I&amp;#39;m just very observant</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="4.53">on everything I wanted to see what</text>
  <text start="181.989" dur="5.25">shakes out last night on my show I did a</text>
  <text start="185.2" dur="5.039">little bit of a review on the real</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="4.771">Benghazi from 2012 because of course the</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="3.991">initial reporting of everything going on</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="4.47">with these demonstrations at the Embassy</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="4.369">in Iraq we&amp;#39;re all about making this</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="6.45">about Trump&amp;#39;s Benghazi which of course</text>
  <text start="198.599" dur="7.051">died even quicker than the than the</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="6.27">Ukrainian thing after he put out the</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="7.209">transcript so it made me laugh too</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="8.58">because the statement from everybody was</text>
  <text start="212.859" dur="7.231">on the left the blue checkmarks was Oh</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="4.35">Trump&amp;#39;s Benghazi and we&amp;#39;re like I</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="4.29">thought Benghazi was just you know</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="4.199">thought it was nothing what difference</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="3.689">at this point does it make right I mean</text>
  <text start="226.329" dur="4.56">what difference does it make it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.069" dur="3.75">nothing it was it was just a blip on the</text>
  <text start="230.889" dur="4.68">radar screen</text>
  <text start="231.819" dur="5.04">I mean if it&amp;#39;s Trump&amp;#39;s Benghazi then and</text>
  <text start="235.569" dur="3.301">right off the bat it shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="236.859" dur="4.681">anything bad at all because Benghazi was</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="5.16">just a spontaneous demonstration that</text>
  <text start="241.54" dur="3.24">turned violent after somebody put out a</text>
  <text start="244.03" dur="6.389">YouTube video</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="7.53">yep that pissed off Muslims so you you</text>
  <text start="250.419" dur="4.111">you have to wonder once again it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="252.31" dur="4.32">one of those things it&amp;#39;s projection as</text>
  <text start="254.53" dur="4.62">long as they finally have an answer for</text>
  <text start="256.63" dur="4.199">anybody who brings up Benghazi as long</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="3.69">as they finally have an answer or a</text>
  <text start="260.829" dur="5.221">counterpoint to anybody that brings up</text>
  <text start="262.84" dur="3.78">Benghazi with you know anything beyond</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="3.44">and</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="5.67">I roll and an oh my god that again</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="4.54">they&amp;#39;re fun so I think they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="3.51">trying to find that with some ways of</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="5.37">picking up some poker chips of their own</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="5.61">but as far as the middle east coast and</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="4.71">I was talking about the the people</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="4.95">involved whereas I don&amp;#39;t have a leg up</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="4.2">on knowing what direction it&amp;#39;s going in</text>
  <text start="286.36" dur="4.29">and and while my decisions decisions</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="3.99">were made it&amp;#39;s very easy to see all the</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="4.68">same people are involved over and over</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="4.77">again that&amp;#39;s for sure and as far as</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="4.89">these people who were who were</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="5.969">orchestrating these these demonstrations</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="4.77">being so cozy with the Obama the White</text>
  <text start="303.039" dur="4.291">House we know how many people in the FBI</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="5.67">and the Obama White House were friendly</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="5.19">to Iran or have family ties in Iran and</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="4.8">all this stuff you look at this and you</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="5.1">telling me you did that that the the</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="5.07">intelligence or the or the tips that</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="4.829">John Kerry gave if you don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="3.389">John Kerry had anything to do with the</text>
  <text start="322.449" dur="3.061">kind of intelligence that they were</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="3.841">working off of with all that shadow</text>
  <text start="325.51" dur="5.339">diplomacy he was conducting since the</text>
  <text start="327.76" dur="4.68">day that Trump won Logan Act I mean if</text>
  <text start="330.849" dur="4.111">you couldn&amp;#39;t get any any more of a</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="4.64">perfect demonstration like what I said</text>
  <text start="334.96" dur="8.45">is watching you know I have like</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="9.87">accumulated here I had accumulated I</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="9.009">dropped it I&amp;#39;ll be right back you</text>
  <text start="346.95" dur="8.02">dropped it on the floor I&amp;#39;m back we had</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="4.291">accumulated here a whole bunch of tweets</text>
  <text start="354.97" dur="4.379">that I want to go through but I think</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="4.889">the one thing that we learned of all the</text>
  <text start="359.349" dur="4.401">things is that we had a bunch of</text>
  <text start="361.599" dur="6.181">foreigners running the government before</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="7.389">we had a bunch of foreigners running our</text>
  <text start="367.78" dur="5.46">government before this and it&amp;#39;s clear to</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="4.34">me like based off of what Samantha power</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="5.489">said based off of what Ben Rhodes said</text>
  <text start="375.479" dur="5.831">that their allegiances were not to the</text>
  <text start="378.729" dur="5.571">United States of America because if they</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="4.35">were then the response would have been</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="3.22">different</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="5.46">now those folks didn&amp;#39;t even put the</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="6.81">typical disclaimer before their comments</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="6.539">they just condemned what Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="5.79">directed our military to do and said how</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="3.901">horrible it was whereas a lot of you</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="3.93">representatives and presidential</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="4.139">candidates got their talking points from</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="7.369">someone else and said he was a bad man</text>
  <text start="405.699" dur="9.061">but now oh ya know there was an op-ed</text>
  <text start="411.419" dur="6.581">yesterday in the New York Times that was</text>
  <text start="414.76" dur="7.17">talking about hypersonic missiles and in</text>
  <text start="418" dur="8.1">the op-ed the author said what if you</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="5.91">found and knew the location of I I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="4.65">solemn how do you pronounce his name do</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="6.26">you even know Salamis so many some I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="6.21">been seeing hearing people say solemn a</text>
  <text start="434.1" dur="4.569">so whose names kill me so whatever I</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="3.75">know I knew this was gonna be a problem</text>
  <text start="438.669" dur="4.771">for me as soon as it happened Salameh</text>

  <text start="443.44" dur="6.599">more like Italian than Iranian but sulla</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="6.18">mainly if you knew where he was it would</text>
  <text start="450.039" dur="6.271">be hard not to use one of these things</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="7.14">just yesterday and now of course he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="6.329">the most revered military man in Iran</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="8.04">he&amp;#39;s revered he&amp;#39;s an austere revered or</text>
  <text start="462.639" dur="8.101">seer and revered mr. religious cleric a</text>
  <text start="467.2" dur="6.3">religious scholar and austere religious</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="6.899">scholar he&amp;#39;s austere and Leonard</text>

  <text start="482.5" dur="4.05">there - you want to talk about everybody</text>
  <text start="484.69" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s just you know gravitating toward</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="4.89">whatever their natural bias is on these</text>
  <text start="488.44" dur="5.49">on these subjects are I mean there there</text>
  <text start="491.44" dur="3.99">is enough out there to please anybody</text>
  <text start="493.93" dur="3.63">you got that</text>
  <text start="495.43" dur="5.22">New Year&amp;#39;s Eve like celebrations that</text>

  <text start="500.65" dur="6.12">they hear he&amp;#39;s dead people locals who</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="5.16">apparently have been tormented by his</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="4.709">his associations and and and things that</text>
  <text start="509.62" dur="4.77">he was involved with for so long in both</text>
  <text start="511.479" dur="5.461">Iraq and Iran I mean Iran is not a place</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="6.99">that is is that peace in a specific</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="6.75">sense either they&amp;#39;ve been the regime out</text>
  <text start="521.38" dur="4.68">there has had a real hard time with</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="5.19">keeping control of people and their</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="6.18">morale their obedience obviously their</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="4.62">financial woes but I don&amp;#39;t know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s something out there forever</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="4.74">body well look we have a couple threads</text>
  <text start="535.72" dur="6.81">to go through from people who know a lot</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="6.12">more than I do about this but if I think</text>
  <text start="542.53" dur="4.83">the most telling thing is the</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="4.53">intelligence that we have that has to</text>
  <text start="547.36" dur="3.09">scare the crap out of them because we</text>
  <text start="548.89" dur="3.6">knew exactly where this man was in</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="5.7">person with precision took him and</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="5.13">others with him out in addition just now</text>
  <text start="556.15" dur="3.84">live breaking news</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="4.67">u.s. Marines have arrested multiple Iran</text>
  <text start="559.99" dur="4.44">back to military leaders in Iraq so</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="3.73">they&amp;#39;re not in their own country</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="3.84">everyone has to remember that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="566.02" dur="4.95">on Iranian soil taking you know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="568.27" dur="5.97">saying like we&amp;#39;re in Iraq where we have</text>
  <text start="570.97" dur="7.8">been supporting troops there for decades</text>
  <text start="574.24" dur="8.43">now and this is a clear encroachment by</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="6.81">Iran into Iraq I I look at it from my</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="5.76">very night naive in basic mindset as</text>
  <text start="585.58" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s almost like they&amp;#39;re using terrorist</text>
  <text start="588.43" dur="7.65">factions inside Iraq to take over the</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="9.839">country like right if Marines are making</text>
  <text start="596.08" dur="7.77">arrests then I mean the actions must be</text>
  <text start="600.339" dur="5.341">supported by local government there I</text>
  <text start="603.85" dur="6.57">don&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;re obviously there</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="6.78">has to be coordination there so yeah the</text>
  <text start="610.42" dur="5.1">one thing is like you said before I I</text>
  <text start="612.46" dur="5.24">don&amp;#39;t have any inside sources and this</text>
  <text start="615.52" dur="6.06">confuses the hell out of me because</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="5.889">naturally it all this the history of</text>
  <text start="621.58" dur="6.69">this area in the world doesn&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="623.589" dur="7.861">start in in 1979 I mean you even have to</text>
  <text start="628.27" dur="5.49">if to go back even just like 253 with</text>
  <text start="631.45" dur="5.04">the Shah and then before that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="6.75">talking about sectarian and in truck</text>
  <text start="636.49" dur="6.72">blows and some people have the time so</text>
  <text start="640.51" dur="4.71">I&amp;#39;m just going by whatever threads you</text>
  <text start="643.21" dur="4.2">got I&amp;#39;m just going to take I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="645.22" dur="4.5">going to absorb the best I can and see</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="5.55">what shakes out and we got to remember</text>
  <text start="649.72" dur="7.2">to like I did a piece about Peter struck</text>
  <text start="652.96" dur="7.11">and his dad who worked for Bell there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="6.72">a lot of deep State players who have</text>
