  <text start="192.53" dur="3.929">audio of the eight-minute session must</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="3.93">have much of the exchange between</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="4.081">Buchanan and Vondrak that day centered</text>
  <text start="199.1" dur="2.58">on the formalities of closing the</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="6.33">courtroom during his appearance</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="7.11">Papadopoulos here we go we need to seal</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="3.69">the courtroom when the case was called</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="3.5">Vondrak declared that he was appearing</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="6.929">for the United States along with Mueller</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="7.72">re and Goldstein Buchanan told</text>
  <text start="217.489" dur="6.03">Papadopoulos to stand and advised him</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="5.82">he&amp;#39;d been charged then grack said the</text>
  <text start="223.519" dur="5.611">government was not seeking Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="225.83" dur="7.59">detention a somewhat unusual move since</text>
  <text start="229.13" dur="5.13">agents had just arrested him but the</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="2.52">chicago-based</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="4.43">energy consultant was told to give up</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="6.21">his passports and to keep away from</text>
  <text start="238.69" dur="6.64">individuals and entities related to the</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="8.3">charges against him the most important</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="5.12">sentence who were those people</text>
  <text start="250.96" dur="7.59">Trump Donald Trump Trump jr. obstruction</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="5.73">of justice and making false official</text>
  <text start="258.55" dur="6.6">statements week a charges with big</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="4.44">penalties but the reason why they knew</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="5.64">that he had made false official</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="6.36">statements to the FBI young people</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="6.54">questioning was because Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="8.34">provided all of the emails so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="6.06">they knew he had lied he says he has his</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="3.6">own attorney so he&amp;#39;s not allowed to talk</text>
  <text start="283.39" dur="6.12">to anyone on the Trump team so who was</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="6.45">he talking to he says he&amp;#39;s not sure he</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="3.92">who he is forbidden to contact the judge</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="4.49">says we&amp;#39;ll have to give him a list</text>
  <text start="293.43" dur="5.53">prosecutors say okay now you&amp;#39;re released</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="4.27">legal experts say the brief appearance</text>
  <text start="298.96" dur="2.54">was noteworthy for a couple of different</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="4.4">reasons</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="6.67">Papadopoulos had no defense attorney and</text>
  <text start="304.98" dur="6.13">Papadopoulos his arrest seems to have</text>
  <text start="308.17" dur="5.16">been the product of some haste he was</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="4.83">arrested on July 27th after coming off a</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="5.04">flight from Munich prosecutors had no</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="5.49">warrant no indictment or criminal</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="5.01">complaint the complaint would be filed</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="5.37">the following morning and approved by</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="5.7">Howell in Washington I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="8.7">right here guys I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m speculating</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="8.19">what I&amp;#39;m gonna get to all of this stuff</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="3.42">suggests something of a scramble rather</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="4.56">than a carefully prepared plan to take</text>
  <text start="338.92" dur="5.58">proper da police into custody defense</text>
  <text start="341.83" dur="4.23">lawyer didn&amp;#39;t comment whatever</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="4.44">transpired in the 24 hours after</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="3.93">Papadopoulos landed at Dulles it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="348.94" dur="8.12">seem to have impaired his cooperation</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="7.07">with Mueller&amp;#39;s team and he&amp;#39;s playing</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="4.27">following his arrest defendant</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="3.75">Papadopoulos met with the government on</text>
  <text start="361.81" dur="8.34">numerous occasions to provide</text>
  <text start="363.94" dur="8.01">information and answer questions Kramer</text>
  <text start="370.15" dur="3.75">said the arrests the sealed hearing and</text>
  <text start="371.95" dur="4.26">the defendants released the next day all</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="4.71">suggest prosecutors didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="3.959">energy consultants associates aware that</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="3.69">he was in trouble with the feds and</text>
  <text start="380.169" dur="4.311">wanted to keep open the possibility of</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="6.44">using him to try to extract damaged</text>
  <text start="384.48" dur="6.03">admissions from others that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="4.26">consistent with if you want to come send</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="5.73">him back or eat or use him now where am</text>
  <text start="393" dur="5.43">I going with all of this the memo tells</text>
  <text start="396.24" dur="4.2">us that Peter struck opened up a</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="4.91">counterintelligence investigation into</text>

  <text start="435.09" dur="4.74">insurance policy and as soon as Muller</text>
