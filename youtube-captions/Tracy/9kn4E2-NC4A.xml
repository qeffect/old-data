  <text start="1766.4" dur="4.41">the Chinese Mulder is dropping hints</text>
  <text start="1768.23" dur="4.74">that china is the world&amp;#39;s only sovereign</text>
  <text start="1770.81" dur="5.46">state he&amp;#39;s going back to that language</text>
  <text start="1772.97" dur="6.09">of the Imperial era himself when the</text>
  <text start="1776.27" dur="5.28">Chinese member of ruled all under heaven</text>
  <text start="1779.06" dur="4.56">and clearly we&amp;#39;ve heard his foreign</text>
  <text start="1781.55" dur="3.87">minister talk about this about how they</text>
  <text start="1783.62" dur="3.93">wanted to replace the Westphalian system</text>
  <text start="1785.42" dur="3.99">which is the current international order</text>
  <text start="1787.55" dur="4.77">and that means that seated paying</text>
  <text start="1789.41" dur="4.95">believes that he is the world&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="1792.32" dur="4.02">more and that means there&amp;#39;s not much</text>
  <text start="1794.36" dur="5.94">room or for instance in the United</text>
  <text start="1796.34" dur="6.96">States I think what President Trump did</text>
  <text start="1800.3" dur="5.85">when he took office is get the attention</text>
  <text start="1803.3" dur="5.67">of the Chinese they made clear to me and</text>
  <text start="1806.15" dur="4.26">others that they deeply respect him in</text>
  <text start="1808.97" dur="4.5">some sense that are afraid of him</text>
  <text start="1810.41" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;ve read his books but his comments</text>
  <text start="1813.47" dur="5.63">about China and so his first step was to</text>
  <text start="1816.62" dur="5.43">say he wasn&amp;#39;t sure the one China policy</text>
  <text start="1819.1" dur="6.1">really would buy him and he had</text>
  <text start="1822.05" dur="5.97">President Xi who he calls his friend he</text>
  <text start="1825.2" dur="4.98">got President Xi to ask him to adhere to</text>
  <text start="1828.02" dur="3.26">the one-child policy so that was the</text>
  <text start="1830.18" dur="2.99">first step</text>
  <text start="1831.28" dur="3.54">the trade talks began the Chinese really</text>
  <text start="1833.17" dur="3.42">wouldn&amp;#39;t call they denied everything</text>
  <text start="1834.82" dur="4.08">word is that we have not done any</text>
  <text start="1836.59" dur="4.5">intellectual property theft</text>
  <text start="1838.9" dur="4.71">we haven&amp;#39;t forced technology transfer</text>
  <text start="1841.09" dur="4.62">and what basically we&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="1843.61" dur="3">negotiating with so then the second big</text>
  <text start="1845.71" dur="3.18">step</text>
  <text start="1846.61" dur="4.89">president truck took which is heavily</text>
  <text start="1848.89" dur="5.49">criticized was put the tariffs up and</text>
  <text start="1851.5" dur="5.04">the tariffs emails were punitive this is</text>
  <text start="1854.38" dur="5.04">not some kind of protection for American</text>
  <text start="1856.54" dur="13.08">industry it was to punish China and for</text>
  <text start="1859.42" dur="12.77">the technology that what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1869.62" dur="5.28">about the Chinese criminally taken</text>
  <text start="1872.19" dur="4.99">hundreds of billions of dollars from the</text>

  <text start="1877.18" dur="3.51">erection</text>
  <text start="1877.6" dur="4.67">might we don&amp;#39;t have a future I think</text>
  <text start="1880.69" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s true and then the third step</text>
  <text start="1882.27" dur="6.73">President Trump took was very close to</text>
  <text start="1886.51" dur="4.5">what he just said he said it twice now</text>
  <text start="1889" dur="7.77">in press conferences one very recently</text>
  <text start="1891.01" dur="8.01">China wants to surpass America he said</text>
  <text start="1896.77" dur="5.9">it very clearly both times in his press</text>
  <text start="1899.02" dur="7.01">conferences China wants the past America</text>
  <text start="1902.67" dur="8.24">attendees a heroic next sentence</text>
  <text start="1906.03" dur="4.88">is it&amp;#39;s not going to happen on my watch</text>
  <text start="1915.71" dur="5.14">really going back to Nixon was an</text>
  <text start="1918.36" dur="4.89">integrationist view of China and we</text>
  <text start="1920.85" dur="3.959">believe that if we showed kindness and</text>
  <text start="1923.25" dur="4.17">we tried to bring the Chinese Internet</text>
  <text start="1924.809" dur="4.921">into the international system they were</text>
  <text start="1927.42" dur="5.49">reciprocated they might want to compete</text>
  <text start="1929.73" dur="5.43">with us an international system but the</text>
  <text start="1932.91" dur="4.77">idea was that China would be come</text>
  <text start="1935.16" dur="4.86">tonight and because of that we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1937.68" dur="5.76">accommodations policies that have in</text>
  <text start="1940.02" dur="4.5">effect accepted unacceptable behavior on</text>
  <text start="1943.44" dur="3.15">the part of the Chinese including</text>
  <text start="1944.52" dur="4.77">territorial affections which we have</text>
  <text start="1946.59" dur="4.44">seen continually throughout not just in</text>

  <text start="1962.16" dur="3.96">had something just by a show of hands</text>
  <text start="1963.929" dur="5.031">how many people there are Christians how</text>
  <text start="1966.12" dur="5.82">many Christians are in the audience</text>
  <text start="1968.96" dur="6.52">China that makes Christianity illegal</text>
  <text start="1971.94" dur="6.42">unless you do it the Chinese way this is</text>
  <text start="1975.48" dur="5.94">really bad the oppression of Christians</text>
  <text start="1978.36" dur="6.6">in China has increased over the last 10</text>
  <text start="1981.42" dur="5.61">years and a lot of evangelical</text>
  <text start="1984.96" dur="4.53">Christians used to take what they call</text>
  <text start="1987.03" dur="5.46">the quiet diplomacy route don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="1989.49" dur="6.63">about it somehow ask the Chinese nicely</text>
  <text start="1992.49" dur="6.09">please allow Christianity in fact that</text>
  <text start="1996.12" dur="4.95">made it worse but actually has happened</text>
  <text start="1998.58" dur="5.94">Gordon the Chinese Communist Party which</text>
  <text start="2001.07" dur="6.9">is now 80 million members it cannot be a</text>

  <text start="2007.97" dur="4.56">a member of the Chinese Communist Party</text>
  <text start="2009.95" dur="4.14">this has long-term consequences it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2012.53" dur="4.47">part of what President Trump when he</text>
  <text start="2014.09" dur="5.339">wrote this book at 2015 he called the</text>
  <text start="2017" dur="4.08">bad China that&amp;#39;s going to be on our</text>
  <text start="2019.429" dur="3.75">agenda and I think President Trump is</text>
  <text start="2021.08" dur="7.68">already doing this not the best a heroic</text>
  <text start="2023.179" dur="7.411">step to the concentration camps where</text>
  <text start="2028.76" dur="5.79">China&amp;#39;s imprison more than a billion</text>
  <text start="2030.59" dur="5.969">leaders in kha&amp;#39;zix Muslims but what we</text>
  <text start="2034.55" dur="5.43">have seen especially over the last year</text>

  <text start="2044.13" dur="3.96">as Christians even they&amp;#39;re going against</text>

  <text start="2048.09" dur="5.309">be acceptable religious and social thing</text>
  <text start="2051.54" dur="3.72">is obviously determined to eliminate</text>
  <text start="2053.399" dur="4.171">religion and for us that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2055.26" dur="4.379">important because not just because we</text>
  <text start="2057.57" dur="4.109">may be Christian or whatever but maybe</text>
  <text start="2059.639" dur="5.04">because we&amp;#39;re people that they put us in</text>
  <text start="2061.679" dur="5.25">for the cause we&amp;#39;d see Chinese ambitions</text>

  <text start="2066.929" dur="1.98">stage</text>
  <text start="2067.23" dur="3.51">we know that this is not just going to</text>

  <text start="2074.58" dur="4.829">Huawei Technologies phenomenally an</text>
  <text start="2077.129" dur="4.351">employee-owned company but really does</text>
  <text start="2079.409" dur="4.98">the instrumentality of the Chinese state</text>
  <text start="2081.48" dur="5.939">like when you see wall ways ambitions to</text>

  <text start="2094.379" dur="4.981">well president Trump has talked about</text>
  <text start="2096.87" dur="6.42">the hidden activities in China and</text>
  <text start="2099.36" dur="6.72">Huawei claims to be a private company in</text>
  <text start="2103.29" dur="5.13">fact they&amp;#39;re masquerading as an arm of</text>
  <text start="2106.08" dur="4.08">the Chinese Communist Party so if they</text>
  <text start="2108.42" dur="4.29">can be in control the global</text>
  <text start="2110.16" dur="5.16">telecommunications system it tends to</text>
  <text start="2112.71" dur="5.28">split our alliances so the battle</text>
  <text start="2115.32" dur="5.07">against far away once again is what when</text>
  <text start="2117.99" dur="5.43">Donald Trump was the candidate the good</text>
  <text start="2120.39" dur="5.61">China versus the bad guy the bad China</text>
  <text start="2123.42" dur="5.97">the hidden China the deception of secret</text>
  <text start="2126" dur="5.07">control global telecommunications that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2129.39" dur="3.87">what President Trump was struggling</text>
  <text start="2131.07" dur="6.54">against and I think he&amp;#39;s got a very</text>
  <text start="2133.26" dur="6.69">clever smart strategy he&amp;#39;s made friends</text>
  <text start="2137.61" dur="4.11">with Xi Jinping who was the master of</text>
  <text start="2139.95" dur="4.74">the Chinese communist state and the</text>
  <text start="2141.72" dur="5.18">party if he succeeds with this trade</text>
  <text start="2144.69" dur="5.62">deal by having</text>
  <text start="2146.9" dur="7.11">come over to Bartolotta and it covers</text>
  <text start="2150.31" dur="6.75">things like the one way deception</text>
  <text start="2154.01" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re talking about one of them Vegas</text>
  <text start="2157.06" dur="4.57">historic agreements between the United</text>
  <text start="2159.44" dur="4.2">States and he of the country in world</text>
  <text start="2161.63" dur="4.56">history the president Trump has made</text>
  <text start="2163.64" dur="5.34">clear he knows China is the second</text>
  <text start="2166.19" dur="4.86">largest economy in the world this is the</text>
  <text start="2168.98" dur="5.07">first largest and the second largest and</text>
  <text start="2171.05" dur="5.7">the negotiations and mar-a-lago and what</text>
  <text start="2174.05" dur="5.94">President Trump has set up the Chinese</text>
  <text start="2176.75" dur="7.55">are coming to our own territory the</text>
  <text start="2179.99" dur="4.31">final deal I think that&amp;#39;s wrong too</text>
  <text start="2188.109" dur="5.01">the president has read your book under</text>
  <text start="2190.15" dur="5.819">dear marathon obviously you talk about a</text>
  <text start="2193.119" dur="5.61">long term Chinese goal to dominate the</text>
  <text start="2195.969" dur="4.471">world and the issue is going to be you</text>
  <text start="2198.729" dur="3.57">know we try to accommodate the Chinese</text>
  <text start="2200.44" dur="3.899">by doing that we&amp;#39;ve shown them that</text>
  <text start="2202.299" dur="3.871">aggression marks that all the worst</text>
  <text start="2204.339" dur="3.99">elements in the Chinese political system</text>
  <text start="2206.17" dur="3.629">like in Japan in the 1930s they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2208.329" dur="3.66">started to take over the Chinese</text>
  <text start="2209.799" dur="5.131">military so the question I have to ask</text>
  <text start="2211.989" dur="5.25">you is can be towards us with a</text>
  <text start="2214.93" dur="3.72">belligerent provocative China is there</text>
  <text start="2217.239" dur="3.48">some way that we can find an</text>
  <text start="2218.65" dur="4.74">accommodation with them or probably just</text>
  <text start="2220.719" dur="4.29">save ourselves like first as Britain and</text>
  <text start="2223.39" dur="5.82">France were kidding themselves about</text>
  <text start="2225.009" dur="7.77">that combinative I think but Vice</text>
  <text start="2229.21" dur="5.279">President Mike Pence said and he got</text>
  <text start="2232.779" dur="4.5">into a movement last night here to see</text>
  <text start="2234.489" dur="5.75">package Bo he&amp;#39;s held out the visually</text>
  <text start="2237.279" dur="6.99">the same as President Trump in his book</text>
  <text start="2240.239" dur="6.82">yes we can coexist with China but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2244.269" dur="5.1">got to have reciprocity we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="2247.059" dur="5.04">have equal treatment we&amp;#39;ve got to have</text>

  <text start="2252.099" dur="6.361">companies no more violation</text>
  <text start="2255.65" dur="5.12">principals and most important of all</text>
  <text start="2258.46" dur="5.44">President Trump wants to concern</text>
  <text start="2260.77" dur="5.55">American leadership the greatest</text>
  <text start="2263.9" dur="5.64">challenge from China is to the American</text>
  <text start="2266.32" dur="5.23">created and land world order that the</text>
  <text start="2269.54" dur="5.04">Chinese already had been quite clearly</text>

  <text start="2289.4" dur="5.07">against all of those things it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2291.41" dur="6.57">to be I think very difficult the Chinese</text>
  <text start="2294.47" dur="6.06">at least the Communist Party and trying</text>
  <text start="2297.98" dur="4.11">to integrated though of course we can</text>

  <text start="2311.359" dur="4.351">if you think about this to think that</text>
  <text start="2314.059" dur="4.831">does concern me as I mentioned is that</text>
  <text start="2315.71" dur="5.56">the Chinese military like the Japanese</text>
  <text start="2318.89" dur="9.17">military in the 1930</text>
