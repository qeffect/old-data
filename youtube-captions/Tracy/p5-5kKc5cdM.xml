  <text start="224.56" dur="5.31">that there is a very very very good</text>
  <text start="227.799" dur="5.131">reason for it and I have been working</text>
  <text start="229.87" dur="4.8">very very hard on a lot of things behind</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="6.179">the scenes which you will see come to</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="7.379">fruition within the next few days I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="239.109" dur="4.981">excited and I&amp;#39;m not trying to do any</text>

  <text start="252.78" dur="6.37">and you&amp;#39;ll see why I wanted to quickly</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="3.84">talk with you guys about the struct page</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="5.16">text message article that came out from</text>
  <text start="261.16" dur="4.77">Catherine Herridge the other day there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="3.359">a lot of stories that happened in the</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="3.6">past couple days I will be covering all</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="3.361">of them including Eddie Gallagher but I</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="4.53">just wanted to get something up here and</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="4.889">out here for you guys about this before</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="3.389">I get back to the drawing board and do</text>
  <text start="275.919" dur="6.631">all the nonsense that I got to do today</text>
  <text start="277.449" dur="8.25">so this article came out yesterday and</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="4.98">it is about some redactions that were</text>
  <text start="285.699" dur="5.311">unveiled in the struck page text</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="6.919">messages in reference to the in</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="5.82">reference to the meeting in London with</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="4.361">whoever they met with in London days</text>
  <text start="296.83" dur="4.89">after they supposedly launched crossfire</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="5.579">hurricane so what is interesting to me</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="5.1">about this isn&amp;#39;t even the context of the</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="4.291">text messages or the fact that Catherine</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="4.5">Harridge reports that they are trying to</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="8.25">decide what they are and are not going</text>
  <text start="311.32" dur="7.56">to disclose to main justice saying that</text>
  <text start="316.93" dur="4.26">any unauthorized disclosure could cause</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="5.36">quote exceptionally grave damage to new</text>
  <text start="321.19" dur="7.469">u.s. national security it&amp;#39;s not that as</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="8.47">as poignant as that is it&amp;#39;s this she</text>
  <text start="328.659" dur="6">includes the Scribd link which she often</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="3.78">does to the source documents and if you</text>
  <text start="334.659" dur="4.171">read through here you&amp;#39;ll see the</text>
  <text start="336.49" dur="8.27">redaction boxes are still there and then</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="5.93">you&amp;#39;ll see handwritten handwritten</text>
  <text start="344.78" dur="11.17">into the redaction boxes words now Ben</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="7.48">Richard Ben David see the names Richard</text>
  <text start="355.95" dur="5.13">David so a couple things we can gather</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="4.19">from this that were not gathering it the</text>
  <text start="361.08" dur="5.31">context of what they&amp;#39;re saying doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="4.96">necessarily matter number one we know by</text>
  <text start="366.39" dur="4.23">looking at this that either she wrote</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="4.65">these reductions in by hand or somebody</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="4.47">gave this to her with the reductions in</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="4.26">typically you&amp;#39;ll see or with the with</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="4.92">the words written in typically you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="376.95" dur="5.55">see when radec redactions are unveiled</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="4.62">even if it&amp;#39;s just for one reporter</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;ll see that they&amp;#39;ll hat they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="384.63" dur="6.09">the redactions literally uncovered it</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="7.1">won&amp;#39;t be a handwritten word inside what</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="6.75">this tells me is a few things okay and</text>
  <text start="394.79" dur="4.45">this isn&amp;#39;t like it&amp;#39;s like a sexually</text>
  <text start="397.47" dur="3.78">known thing this is just as an</text>
  <text start="399.24" dur="3.45">investigator as my you know as a</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="4.89">journalist looking at this is what it</text>
  <text start="402.69" dur="6.42">tells me it tells me that either that a</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="4.89">this is not an authorized redaction that</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="3.75">this is a narrative that&amp;#39;s somebody who</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="4.47">leaked this to catherine herridge wants</text>
  <text start="412.86" dur="5.99">out there right now okay and I say that</text>
  <text start="415.5" dur="6">because either she was given handwritten</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="4.27">notes or she was on the phone and wrote</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="4.5">them down or she was interviewing with</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="5.01">them and wrote them down also telling is</text>
  <text start="426" dur="4.56">the fact that she released this like</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="4.86">this I think that when people do things</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="6.54">like that it could be a message to</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="7.47">certain folks of us who who pick up on</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="5.85">this stuff there are stars next to</text>

  <text start="456.6" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t share them or catherine herridge</text>
  <text start="458.85" dur="3.42">didn&amp;#39;t share them one of the two which</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="3.089">means that there is some sort of a</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="6">storyline that&amp;#39;s coming out here that</text>

  <text start="647.49" dur="5.19">of who was leaking that stuff to Solomon</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="4.38">the house permanent Select Committee on</text>
