  <text start="43.35" dur="6.36">important to me to hold that standard</text>

  <text start="58.89" dur="5.19">going to do my very best a hundred</text>
  <text start="61.32" dur="5.22">percent of the time to get it right but</text>

  <text start="66.54" dur="4.59">where I get it wrong and you know I just</text>

  <text start="81.03" dur="7.229">has been doing this for a really long</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="5.37">time and care very much about the</text>
  <text start="88.259" dur="4.441">country and the direction it&amp;#39;s going in</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="4.56">and our rights and our freedoms as a</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.8">whole and the deep state nonsense and I</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="4.5">just I just care so much about all this</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="5.28">stuff and so that&amp;#39;s just a little intro</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="5.309">on me not very detailed but there you go</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="3.839">what I wanted to talk about was the</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="2.711">video I did yesterday in regards to the</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="3.311">two paddocks</text>
  <text start="107.47" dur="4.83">I did a lot of research what worked with</text>
  <text start="109.93" dur="5.19">B yesterday to do a lot of research to</text>
  <text start="112.3" dur="5.52">find out who this freakin guy was who</text>
  <text start="115.12" dur="4.68">this Steven C paddock was and where he</text>
  <text start="117.82" dur="3.87">came from and what social media he had</text>
  <text start="119.8" dur="5.01">and what he was looking you know what he</text>
  <text start="121.69" dur="5.22">was posting and and what companies was</text>
  <text start="124.81" dur="5.04">he connected to and where did the money</text>
  <text start="126.91" dur="5.67">that he made come from if he had any and</text>
  <text start="129.85" dur="7.43">what may have his motivations been and</text>
  <text start="132.58" dur="8.28">why you know who was he and just get a</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="4.96">grasp before the the nonsense came all</text>
  <text start="140.86" dur="3.54">over the media of what the hell was</text>
  <text start="142.24" dur="5.79">going on with this dude so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="144.4" dur="6.84">we did and we found that photo on</text>
  <text start="148.03" dur="4.95">instant checkmate and a few other people</text>
  <text start="151.24" dur="3.3">search sites these were not free</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="4.2">searches that were done these are paid</text>
  <text start="154.54" dur="4.65">subscriptions that are maintained here</text>
  <text start="157.18" dur="5.279">so it&amp;#39;s not like one of those cheap O&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="6.18">that we got and so we found that photo</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="4.651">and attached to that photo were the</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="5.76">Steven paddock social media sites</text>
  <text start="167.11" dur="7.59">LinkedIn Google+ and address in Vermont</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="8.75">and address in Mesquite Texas 20 or so</text>
  <text start="174.7" dur="8.6">addresses actually and that photo of</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="6.37">Steven paddock that was not the photo</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="5.17">that the media was sharing of Steven</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="5.73">paddock and I was saying to myself what</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="5.28">the eff is going on here why why why do</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="5.28">they have this photo in these social</text>
  <text start="193.75" dur="5.9">media sites coupled in with all the</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="6.35">details for the Steven paddock in quotes</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="6.28">supposedly the one from the media right</text>
  <text start="203.61" dur="4.36">because the media was sharing the</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="5.13">Mesquite Nevada address the media was</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="5.04">sharing that he had a pilot&amp;#39;s license</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="3.959">all those things were media shared and</text>
  <text start="213.01" dur="3.6">and they matched up with what we had</text>
  <text start="215.019" dur="4.831">found on the searches that we had done</text>
  <text start="216.61" dur="5.61">earlier that morning so it was really</text>
  <text start="219.85" dur="3.84">really really really strange to me that</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="4.079">this other gentleman&amp;#39;s photo was</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="5.64">attached to this profile with all of</text>
  <text start="226.299" dur="4.201">this stuff so that&amp;#39;s why I made the</text>
  <text start="229.33" dur="3.57">video</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="7.26">I thought to myself does the media have</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="8.07">it wrong and they just took a photo that</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="7.35">someone said was Steven paddock and made</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="7.2">it him then I thought to myself is there</text>
  <text start="245.11" dur="4.89">a chance that the Steven paddock they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="3.33">saying was the killer wasn&amp;#39;t really the</text>
  <text start="250" dur="4.77">killer and this is kind of to throw</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="6.03">everyone off and confuse everyone or is</text>
  <text start="254.77" dur="4.62">there a chance that there are two Steven</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="4.04">C paddocks that are the same exact age</text>
  <text start="259.39" dur="4.23">that both had addresses in Vermont and</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.63">somehow they were connected to one</text>
  <text start="263.62" dur="5.07">another incidentally on all the people</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="5.07">search websites so a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="268.69" dur="4.38">took it upon themselves to reach out to</text>
  <text start="271.27" dur="4.98">Steven paddock at the Vermont</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="7.05">agricultural board and let him know that</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="7.35">his photo was being attributed to Steven</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="6.72">paddock the mass murderer from Nevada</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="4.85">and they waited for a response and a</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="4.53">response was received</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="6.43">Steven paddock himself did not reply to</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="8.31">this email but the director of the</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="7.53">agricultural of the agricultural I guess</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="7.5">division and government in Vermont did</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="6.36">reply and she said he knows we&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="4.17">care of it or something to that effect I</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="4.77">shared it on my Twitter and sure enough</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="4.11">I went to the LinkedIn page after we got</text>
  <text start="313.54" dur="4.23">this response and I went to his LinkedIn</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="6.93">page and I saw that the photo had been</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="6.63">taken down now that&amp;#39;s great you know</text>
  <text start="322.39" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s very easy I guess there&amp;#39;s a lesson</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="4.95">here and that I guess it&amp;#39;s very easy for</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="7.2">you know your identity to be screwed</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="7.11">with online I go a lot by my instinct</text>
  <text start="333.7" dur="4.29">and my gut in this life I don&amp;#39;t feel I</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="3.33">was attacked a little bit today on</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="4.56">Twitter for sharing this information and</text>
