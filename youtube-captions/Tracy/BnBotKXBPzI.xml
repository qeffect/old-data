  <text start="662.71" dur="5.56">both human intelligence and signals that</text>
  <text start="665.5" dur="6.37">led to a definite attack coming up</text>
  <text start="668.27" dur="6">and the issue became when we reached the</text>
  <text start="671.87" dur="7.02">level of getting credible intelligence</text>
  <text start="674.27" dur="7.68">up to the AFRICOM folks and to the</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="5.699">embassies and others they kind of create</text>
  <text start="681.95" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s called a check mark or a check</text>
  <text start="684.589" dur="4.651">box if you will and that box indicates</text>
  <text start="687.41" dur="3.239">whether key personnel need to be removed</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="3.69">from the embassy or that country</text>
  <text start="690.649" dur="5.31">entirely or security needs to be</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="5.04">increased or both and the way it came</text>
  <text start="695.959" dur="4.231">out two weeks prior to the attacks</text>
  <text start="697.97" dur="4.369">it was a definite removed the ambassador</text>
  <text start="700.19" dur="4.32">and key personnel and increased security</text>
  <text start="702.339" dur="4.151">unfortunately right before the attacks</text>
  <text start="704.51" dur="4.65">began security was decreased in the</text>
  <text start="706.49" dur="5.01">Ambassador was left in an annex way away</text>
  <text start="709.16" dur="4.92">from the main hard core embassy or at</text>
  <text start="711.5" dur="4.17">least compound and that created a</text>
  <text start="714.08" dur="4.89">vulnerability that should never have</text>
  <text start="715.67" dur="5.16">happened it never happens at all and it</text>
  <text start="718.97" dur="3.78">was interesting because I was listening</text>
  <text start="720.83" dur="3.569">to reporting from around the time that</text>
  <text start="722.75" dur="3.209">this happened to see what the story</text>
  <text start="724.399" dur="3.721">really was that they were giving to the</text>
  <text start="725.959" dur="3.841">American people and they they indicated</text>
  <text start="728.12" dur="3.42">several times they had literally no</text>
  <text start="729.8" dur="4.58">intelligence that anything was going to</text>
  <text start="731.54" dur="6.78">happen so hearing you say that is</text>
  <text start="734.38" dur="5.11">chilling what do you do anyone can</text>
  <text start="738.32" dur="3.6">answer this what do you do in a</text>
  <text start="739.49" dur="4.14">situation like that where you know that</text>
  <text start="741.92" dur="4.979">something is happening that shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="743.63" dur="5.49">and you know you&amp;#39;re trying to prevent an</text>
  <text start="746.899" dur="5.901">attack or a death or whatever how do you</text>
  <text start="749.12" dur="3.68">handle that situation in your day-to-day</text>
  <text start="756.16" dur="4.63">well what what we did is we continued to</text>
  <text start="759.38" dur="3.6">breach the issue with our chain of</text>
  <text start="760.79" dur="4.049">command and we kept going above them we</text>
  <text start="762.98" dur="4.38">even made sure indications and warnings</text>
  <text start="764.839" dur="4.56">were sent out not only to the CENTCOM</text>
  <text start="767.36" dur="4.289">folks and AFRICOM but to higher-level</text>
  <text start="769.399" dur="4.711">commands Defense Intelligence Agency and</text>
  <text start="771.649" dur="4.891">to the embassy direct so we were giving</text>
  <text start="774.11" dur="4.44">as many different eyes the opportunity</text>
  <text start="776.54" dur="4.08">to review and see these intelligence</text>
  <text start="778.55" dur="3.87">reports and understand the gravity of</text>
  <text start="780.62" dur="4.29">those because they were very significant</text>
  <text start="782.42" dur="4.919">and nothing was being done</text>
  <text start="784.91" dur="5.04">matter of fact Central Command was</text>
  <text start="787.339" dur="6.091">involved with a training exercise the</text>
  <text start="789.95" dur="5.46">evening of 9/11 and if you remember at</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="4.409">the same time the attacks kicked off in</text>
  <text start="795.41" dur="5.34">Libya our embassy in Cairo Egypt was</text>
  <text start="797.839" dur="4.381">overrun in both instances we were told</text>
  <text start="800.75" dur="3.48">that the State Department was going</text>
  <text start="802.22" dur="3.78">let the Morsi government regain control</text>
  <text start="804.23" dur="3.9">of our embassy in Cairo Egypt</text>
  <text start="806" dur="9.51">and that they had it under control in</text>
  <text start="808.13" dur="9.15">Libya is that typical no so all of this</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="6.42">is not typical and just to reinforce</text>
  <text start="817.28" dur="6.96">where will is said the members of the</text>
  <text start="821.93" dur="4.26">Armed Forces that we have at these</text>
  <text start="824.24" dur="5.82">different centers like Ramstein Air</text>

  <text start="843.2" dur="6.3">what will and Josh and Nick were</text>
  <text start="847.37" dur="4.68">experienced and they were they wanted to</text>
  <text start="849.5" dur="4.41">feed information up and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="852.05" dur="5.06">done from the bottom up they feed this</text>
  <text start="853.91" dur="5.97">information up and they can they try to</text>
  <text start="857.11" dur="6.1">correct any errors on what the real</text>
  <text start="859.88" dur="5.79">situation is if it&amp;#39;s being analyzed at</text>
  <text start="863.21" dur="5.46">the time at the same time what we had</text>
  <text start="865.67" dur="4.77">from the White House to the State</text>
  <text start="868.67" dur="5.76">Department who actually took over the</text>
  <text start="870.44" dur="6.72">operation from the Pentagon issued a</text>
  <text start="874.43" dur="5.16">stand-down order and that as I recall</text>
  <text start="877.16" dur="6.27">John was in about the second hour the 13</text>
  <text start="879.59" dur="5.73">hours and so came down from above White</text>

  <text start="885.32" dur="5.46">Department on down to these commands to</text>
  <text start="887.54" dur="5.73">stand down do nothing further and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="890.78" dur="5.76">where the crime has been committed by</text>
  <text start="893.27" dur="4.83">our senior officials in line not only to</text>
  <text start="896.54" dur="4.08">Congress with the American people about</text>
  <text start="898.1" dur="5.58">what really happened and it all involved</text>
  <text start="900.62" dur="5.52">around a large deal that went bad in</text>
  <text start="903.68" dur="4.53">Libya at that time some of those arms</text>
  <text start="906.14" dur="4.92">eventually going up to turkey into Syria</text>
  <text start="908.21" dur="4.5">so the State Department was involved in</text>
  <text start="911.06" dur="4.02">an arms deal they didn&amp;#39;t want to divulge</text>
  <text start="912.71" dur="4.89">that or release any information on what</text>
  <text start="915.08" dur="4.44">was happening in that in that area I was</text>
  <text start="917.6" dur="3.54">focusing on the State Department because</text>
  <text start="919.52" dur="3.48">and then I want to get to Nick and Josh</text>
  <text start="921.14" dur="3.45">about what you guys saw around that time</text>
  <text start="923" dur="3.09">as well but you know we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot</text>
  <text start="924.59" dur="3.21">about the State Department now because</text>
  <text start="926.09" dur="3.84">of this impeachment Fiasco that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="927.8" dur="4.17">ongoing and we&amp;#39;re seeing some of the</text>
  <text start="929.93" dur="4.16">ambassadors stand up there and give</text>
  <text start="931.97" dur="3.63">testimony they don&amp;#39;t seem like the most</text>
  <text start="934.09" dur="3.9">forthright</text>
  <text start="935.6" dur="4.799">organization in our government and I</text>
  <text start="937.99" dur="4.42">just you know if this was this something</text>
  <text start="940.399" dur="4.081">that often happened from the State</text>
  <text start="942.41" dur="4.169">Department arms deals or secret arms</text>
  <text start="944.48" dur="4.38">deals using ambassadors and in foreign</text>
  <text start="946.579" dur="5.13">countries is that standard protocol for</text>
  <text start="948.86" dur="6.169">the State Department this is an isolated</text>
  <text start="951.709" dur="6.69">situation so this was a Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="955.029" dur="7.511">decided or was this Barack Obama wanting</text>
  <text start="958.399" dur="4.62">to provide arms to rebels sort of a</text>
  <text start="962.54" dur="2.4">thing</text>
  <text start="963.019" dur="4.32">Obama was involved in the White House</text>
  <text start="964.94" dur="5.31">National Security Council under Obama to</text>
  <text start="967.339" dur="5.511">the State Department now normally traits</text>
  <text start="970.25" dur="5.04">the but there&amp;#39;s a rescue operation</text>
  <text start="972.85" dur="3.669">whether it&amp;#39;s a US citizen or with</text>
  <text start="975.29" dur="4.68">whether it&amp;#39;s a member of the Armed</text>
  <text start="976.519" dur="5.82">Forces or a group we don&amp;#39;t know we do</text>
  <text start="979.97" dur="5.099">not leave anybody behind we always</text>
  <text start="982.339" dur="4.291">attempt a rescue operation whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.069" dur="3.031">going to be successful or not we never</text>
  <text start="986.63" dur="3.6">know but at least we put all of our</text>
  <text start="988.1" dur="4.59">forces together all the intelligence we</text>
  <text start="990.23" dur="5.7">have and we mount a rescue operation</text>
  <text start="992.69" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s a given Hillary Clinton Obama had</text>
  <text start="995.93" dur="3.93">never served in the military had no idea</text>
  <text start="998.06" dur="3.839">what that meant to the Armed Forces and</text>
  <text start="999.86" dur="5.19">the members of the Armed Forces that we</text>
  <text start="1001.899" dur="6.05">would in fact leave somebody behind but</text>
  <text start="1005.05" dur="5.729">they were doing it for other reasons</text>
  <text start="1007.949" dur="4.211">and of course the State Department has</text>
  <text start="1010.779" dur="4.441">been known for years I&amp;#39;ve worked with</text>
  <text start="1012.16" dur="5.01">them but they&amp;#39;re very inept and many</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="4.32">things in dealing overseas we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1017.17" dur="6.359">the trained people that we had back in</text>
  <text start="1019.54" dur="6.48">save World War two thereafter they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1023.529" dur="4.501">just a different breed well yeah a lot</text>
  <text start="1026.02" dur="3.689">of them end up being you know just</text>
  <text start="1028.03" dur="3.6">basically donors that get</text>
  <text start="1029.709" dur="3.391">ambassadorships that don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="1031.63" dur="4.62">experience whatsoever which is</text>
  <text start="1033.1" dur="4.29">terrifying again Nick and Josh I guess</text>
  <text start="1036.25" dur="3.78">Nick you can go first</text>
  <text start="1037.39" dur="6.24">what was your experience leading up to</text>
  <text start="1040.03" dur="5.399">this event what did you guys have to you</text>
  <text start="1043.63" dur="7.25">know how did you try to alert folks of</text>
  <text start="1045.429" dur="13.441">this Josh you can go first if you want</text>
  <text start="1050.88" dur="10.57">okay yeah leading up to it myself and my</text>
  <text start="1058.87" dur="4.679">counterpart for whatever reason hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1061.45" dur="4.13">really had any information that way it</text>
  <text start="1063.549" dur="4.441">kind of caught us off guard personally</text>
  <text start="1065.58" dur="3.88">now not say the information wasn&amp;#39;t out</text>
  <text start="1067.99" dur="5.22">there just maybe it was our day</text>
  <text start="1069.46" dur="6.18">for whatnot but along in any event we</text>
  <text start="1073.21" dur="3.93">got a phone call that evening from you</text>

  <text start="1082.15" dur="6.18">to keep him Intel in the loop you know</text>
  <text start="1085.33" dur="4.44">for decision-makers to make decisions so</text>
  <text start="1088.33" dur="2.79">we received a phone call that evening</text>
  <text start="1089.77" dur="3.93">asking if we were seeing what was going</text>
  <text start="1091.12" dur="7.77">on and neither one of us had seen</text>
  <text start="1093.7" dur="6.75">anything incoming on that so I started</text>

  <text start="1280.63" dur="6.84">you learn when you start working there</text>
  <text start="1282.79" dur="7.68">that&amp;#39;s what you learn first and could I</text>
  <text start="1287.47" dur="5.04">could I interject and of course yeah</text>
  <text start="1290.47" dur="4.23">well we have to understand that all</text>
  <text start="1292.51" dur="4.17">these these tactical operation centers</text>
  <text start="1294.7" dur="3.81">were where Nick and Josh worked and</text>
  <text start="1296.68" dur="4.47">other ones around the world like where I</text>
  <text start="1298.51" dur="4.83">worked what they do is they ain&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1301.15" dur="3.6">setup of like these monitors and screens</text>
  <text start="1303.34" dur="3.87">and you can see a lot of things that are</text>
  <text start="1304.75" dur="4.38">going on when an incident happens or a</text>
  <text start="1307.21" dur="5.01">situation happens we call it a sitrep</text>
  <text start="1309.13" dur="5.76">and if it&amp;#39;s a troops in contact</text>
  <text start="1312.22" dur="4.7">which this was basically civilians and</text>
  <text start="1314.89" dur="5.16">troops both were in contact at that time</text>
  <text start="1316.92" dur="5.05">you go down this command is critical</text>
  <text start="1320.05" dur="3.6">intent requirement checklist it&amp;#39;s a book</text>
  <text start="1321.97" dur="4.02">and it says who you call and what</text>
  <text start="1323.65" dur="4.5">actions you take so the commander on</text>
  <text start="1325.99" dur="5.31">duty that night had the ability to surge</text>
  <text start="1328.15" dur="5.76">forces automatically because it is a</text>
  <text start="1331.3" dur="4.65">CCIR and then he calls the next command</text>
  <text start="1333.91" dur="3">which is what these Josh and Nick we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1335.95" dur="3.33">trying to explain</text>
  <text start="1336.91" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ll call in people a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1339.28" dur="4.89">call them in while he&amp;#39;s surging assets</text>
  <text start="1341.47" dur="5.55">surging assets means sending fighter</text>
  <text start="1344.17" dur="4.83">jets and sending armed drones to go aid</text>
  <text start="1347.02" dur="3.48">troops on the ground take out things</text>
  <text start="1349" dur="3.78">like motor positions and everything else</text>
  <text start="1350.5" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s no lag time in there that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1352.78" dur="4.11">the commander&amp;#39;s critical intent</text>
  <text start="1354.28" dur="4.35">requirement lists exists and every</text>
  <text start="1356.89" dur="4.92">battle captain or commander that&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="1358.63" dur="4.77">duty is made aware of that so again</text>
  <text start="1361.81" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;ll have some more senior folks</text>
  <text start="1363.4" dur="3.99">coming in throughout the night but that</text>
  <text start="1365.32" dur="4.47">commander on the scene is able to go</text>
  <text start="1367.39" dur="4.74">ahead and execute actions right there</text>
  <text start="1369.79" dur="5.1">unless someone above them tells them not</text>
  <text start="1372.13" dur="5.1">to yeah stand down and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1374.89" dur="6.75">happened but we had aircraft spinning up</text>
  <text start="1377.23" dur="6.6">and in Spain and parts of and Italy</text>
  <text start="1381.64" dur="4.74">where we have aircraft they were</text>
  <text start="1383.83" dur="5.46">spinning up and they were basic don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1386.38" dur="4.86">turn your engines off and that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="1389.29" dur="3.93">the stand down order came but we had</text>
  <text start="1391.24" dur="4.77">plenty of assets in the area like the</text>
  <text start="1393.22" dur="5.4">gentleman said we had creditors we had</text>
  <text start="1396.01" dur="4.17">the fleet forces in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="1398.62" dur="5.01">Marines on board we had special</text>
  <text start="1400.18" dur="5.37">operations forces so as I&amp;#39;ve talked to</text>
  <text start="1403.63" dur="4.17">our Air Force during our investigation</text>
  <text start="1405.55" dur="5.49">the Air Force generals general McInerney</text>
  <text start="1407.8" dur="4.83">in particular he said they could have</text>
  <text start="1411.04" dur="3.69">been on the scene in that third hour of</text>
  <text start="1412.63" dur="3.32">three and a half hours at least on the</text>
  <text start="1414.73" dur="6.74">third hour they could have been</text>
  <text start="1415.95" dur="9.45">attacking the the forces there that had</text>
  <text start="1421.47" dur="7.84">raided the consulate as well as then the</text>
  <text start="1425.4" dur="6.52">the annex so where are four members well</text>
  <text start="1429.31" dur="7.29">were two of our members I think died - a</text>
  <text start="1431.92" dur="8.61">- died in the end the consulate there</text>
  <text start="1436.6" dur="6.6">that they had Smith and ambassador</text>
  <text start="1440.53" dur="6.12">Stevens so this is a travesty of</text>
  <text start="1443.2" dur="7.5">judgment justice it&amp;#39;s a negligence at</text>
  <text start="1446.65" dur="7.08">the highest level and it&amp;#39;s lying to</text>
  <text start="1450.7" dur="10.32">Senate I mean the Congress and the</text>
  <text start="1453.73" dur="9.84">American people and really shielding the</text>
  <text start="1461.02" dur="5.46">people at the top from any type of</text>
  <text start="1463.57" dur="4.41">action being taken against them at that</text>
  <text start="1466.48" dur="3.14">time of course President Obama wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1467.98" dur="3.23">going to take any action</text>
  <text start="1469.62" dur="3.539">against that as the commander chief</text>
  <text start="1471.21" dur="5.79">because he was part and parcel to the</text>
  <text start="1473.159" dur="5.491">stand down order so Nick you knew that</text>
  <text start="1477" dur="2.85">there were and Josh too I guess you guys</text>
  <text start="1478.65" dur="3.33">knew they were I there were assets</text>
  <text start="1479.85" dur="8.16">available that you could divert there or</text>
  <text start="1481.98" dur="8.579">move there and yeah we I was gonna say</text>
  <text start="1488.01" dur="4.32">we had assets in Africa northern Africa</text>
  <text start="1490.559" dur="2.431">I was littered with drones armed and</text>
  <text start="1492.33" dur="3.57">unarmed</text>
  <text start="1492.99" dur="5.52">we had rescue teams that are para rescue</text>
  <text start="1495.9" dur="4.139">team not too far away that could have</text>
  <text start="1498.51" dur="3.72">made it over there and their commandos</text>
  <text start="1500.039" dur="4.711">they are highly trained and they can</text>
  <text start="1502.23" dur="6.449">save anyone in any instance you know if</text>
  <text start="1504.75" dur="7.23">they&amp;#39;re medically and then we had f-16s</text>
  <text start="1508.679" dur="6.691">and f-15s available and we had also</text>
  <text start="1511.98" dur="5.669">Marines available and then you know</text>
  <text start="1515.37" dur="4.11">typically we had somebody in the</text>
  <text start="1517.649" dur="5.371">Mediterranean sitting there a Navy ship</text>
  <text start="1519.48" dur="5.79">sitting there as well I mean and then as</text>
  <text start="1523.02" dur="3.72">will might go into more detail about</text>
  <text start="1525.27" dur="6.21">that we even had more people available</text>
  <text start="1526.74" dur="8.28">that offered help some of our allies</text>
  <text start="1531.48" dur="5.04">correct well yes that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="1535.02" dur="3.09">they offered assistance and we were</text>
  <text start="1536.52" dur="7.47">advised the State Department turned them</text>
  <text start="1538.11" dur="7.38">down that to me is and so you know Nick</text>
  <text start="1543.99" dur="3.12">and I think Josh you guys stepped</text>
  <text start="1545.49" dur="3.809">forward a little bit later but like what</text>
  <text start="1547.11" dur="3.809">is the climate after Benghazi happens</text>
  <text start="1549.299" dur="3.75">after the attacks over after you know</text>
  <text start="1550.919" dur="3.841">that you&amp;#39;ve lost four of your brothers</text>
  <text start="1553.049" dur="3.75">and you have an ambassador you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1554.76" dur="5.549">been able to do anything about it what</text>
  <text start="1556.799" dur="5.191">happens within your respective locations</text>
  <text start="1560.309" dur="7.23">in terms of you guys talking to one</text>
  <text start="1561.99" dur="7.08">another well son calm it was everybody</text>
  <text start="1567.539" dur="3.601">wanted what&amp;#39;s called reflections the</text>
  <text start="1569.07" dur="4.079">after attack reports which you know</text>
  <text start="1571.14" dur="4.11">signal who might be talking about it and</text>
  <text start="1573.149" dur="3.66">things of that nature a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1575.25" dur="4.289">were pretty angry and upset but at the</text>
  <text start="1576.809" dur="4.47">same time the commander at the time sent</text>
  <text start="1579.539" dur="3.721">everybody home that was not a key leader</text>
  <text start="1581.279" dur="3.841">told us to stay out of it and by the</text>
  <text start="1583.26" dur="4.11">time we came back to work a day later</text>
  <text start="1585.12" dur="4.919">they told us to go ahead and secure all</text>
  <text start="1587.37" dur="4.97">information about Benghazi and send it</text>
  <text start="1590.039" dur="3.681">forward this was totally unacceptable</text>
  <text start="1592.34" dur="4.48">Wow</text>
  <text start="1593.72" dur="4.99">and I know Nick you stayed quiet for a</text>
  <text start="1596.82" dur="4.42">long time until after President Trump</text>
  <text start="1598.71" dur="5.86">was elected and you got out of the</text>
  <text start="1601.24" dur="4.38">you got out you step forward I know and</text>
  <text start="1604.57" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re gonna get into this because I know</text>
  <text start="1605.62" dur="3.75">will you provided this information to so</text>
  <text start="1607.63" dur="4.41">many people that just ignored you oh</text>
  <text start="1609.37" dur="4.38">yeah yeah we&amp;#39;ll go through that list in</text>
  <text start="1612.04" dur="3.45">a second and and Josh I know you&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1613.75" dur="4.8">a hard time too so I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1615.49" dur="4.5">that but you know you you got out</text>
  <text start="1618.55" dur="3.63">because you know Trump got elected you</text>
  <text start="1619.99" dur="4.02">felt a little safer that he was</text>
  <text start="1622.18" dur="4.65">president and you didn&amp;#39;t have the swamp</text>
  <text start="1624.01" dur="6.27">kind of leading the way but you brought</text>
  <text start="1626.83" dur="8.13">this to to Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s chief of staff</text>
  <text start="1630.28" dur="7.98">correct it was if you&amp;#39;re talking if you</text>
  <text start="1634.96" dur="5.75">talk to me Nick I went to Susan Brooks</text>
  <text start="1638.26" dur="5.1">she was on the Benghazi committee and</text>
  <text start="1640.71" dur="4.84">her chief of staff called me and told me</text>
  <text start="1643.36" dur="5.49">the investigation is over and referred</text>
  <text start="1645.55" dur="5.37">me to the Benghazi report and I tried to</text>
  <text start="1648.85" dur="4.2">you know make it clear that I had more</text>
  <text start="1650.92" dur="4.17">information and then she said okay well</text>
  <text start="1653.05" dur="5.4">go ahead and call the FBI then you know</text>
  <text start="1655.09" dur="5.13">it something to that effect and then you</text>
  <text start="1658.45" dur="3.21">know I was kind of taken back by that</text>
  <text start="1660.22" dur="3.18">somebody that was on the committee</text>
  <text start="1661.66" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t even ask what I knew how I knew</text>
  <text start="1663.4" dur="5.76">it or anything like that they just said</text>
  <text start="1666.16" dur="6.24">oh that&amp;#39;s over now and and they call the</text>
  <text start="1669.16" dur="5.82">FBI so I called the FBI and they never</text>
  <text start="1672.4" dur="4.17">called me back and they never set up a</text>
  <text start="1674.98" dur="5.97">time for me to talk with them they just</text>
  <text start="1676.57" dur="5.94">want me to walk in there and just walk</text>
  <text start="1680.95" dur="3.96">in whenever their business hours were</text>
  <text start="1682.51" dur="6.12">going on it wasn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal to</text>
  <text start="1684.91" dur="7.02">them I guess I have two questions there</text>
  <text start="1688.63" dur="5.01">but um general white when you were</text>
  <text start="1691.93" dur="6.69">dealing you dealt with this Committee on</text>
  <text start="1693.64" dur="5.94">Benghazi directly correct no we did not</text>
  <text start="1698.62" dur="4.38">appear</text>
  <text start="1699.58" dur="5.76">we provided trade gaudí with all the</text>
  <text start="1703" dur="6.6">intelligence that we didn&amp;#39;t gathered at</text>
  <text start="1705.34" dur="6.27">that time in 2014 and Annamalai</text>
  <text start="1709.6" dur="3.65">installed at the time and Susan Brooks</text>
  <text start="1711.61" dur="5.49">really talked about other members of</text>
  <text start="1713.25" dur="6.7">were betrayed by me on the under</text>
  <text start="1717.1" dur="5.1">hearings we felt very early on the</text>
  <text start="1719.95" dur="4.95">reason he didn&amp;#39;t come to any conclusion</text>
  <text start="1722.2" dur="4.14">as as many of these earrings in Congress</text>
  <text start="1724.9" dur="4.29">they never seem to go anywhere but they</text>
  <text start="1726.34" dur="6.75">take a lot of time and money but we felt</text>
  <text start="1729.19" dur="5.91">the trade value was compromised which is</text>
  <text start="1733.09" dur="6.24">which is not surprising</text>
  <text start="1735.1" dur="6.27">sadly but I just this is brand new</text>
  <text start="1739.33" dur="4.26">information that that everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1741.37" dur="3.45">providing here today like as per in</text>
  <text start="1743.59" dur="3.089">other words after these hearings were</text>
  <text start="1744.82" dur="3.39">over so you&amp;#39;d think that with with</text>
  <text start="1746.679" dur="4.081">what&amp;#39;s going on today it would be a</text>
  <text start="1748.21" dur="4.26">priority to take a look at this stuff</text>
  <text start="1750.76" dur="4.89">trey gowdy dropped the ball I think</text>
  <text start="1752.47" dur="4.829">everybody knows that did you see any of</text>
  <text start="1755.65" dur="7.26">the intelligence that you provided him</text>
  <text start="1757.299" dur="7.891">in in these hearings at all me yes oh</text>
  <text start="1762.91" dur="5.06">yeah we put it together at the citizens</text>
  <text start="1765.19" dur="6.42">Commission in Washington yes absolutely</text>
  <text start="1767.97" dur="5.53">okay shared these documents and we share</text>
  <text start="1771.61" dur="5.549">the intelligence information we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1773.5" dur="5.73">picking up from our discussions with</text>
  <text start="1777.159" dur="3.991">people up and down the line over there</text>
  <text start="1779.23" dur="4.35">we even try to get some of the general</text>
  <text start="1781.15" dur="4.769">officers and admirals so that they</text>
  <text start="1783.58" dur="4.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t talk John had being one who</text>
  <text start="1785.919" dur="4.921">changed his story two or three times and</text>
  <text start="1788.53" dur="4.889">he was in charge of Africa at that time</text>
  <text start="1790.84" dur="4.65">but they were running Africa out of</text>
  <text start="1793.419" dur="4.38">Stuttgart Germany because they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1795.49" dur="5.16">set up yet in Djibouti where Afrikaans</text>
  <text start="1797.799" dur="5.431">supposed to be run out of that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1800.65" dur="4.32">CENTCOM had to pick up Central Command</text>
  <text start="1803.23" dur="4.53">as you have to understand the four-star</text>
  <text start="1804.97" dur="5.069">command and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;ll was and</text>
  <text start="1807.76" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re responsible for the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1810.039" dur="5.851">that&amp;#39;s their area they&amp;#39;re AO area of</text>
  <text start="1812.5" dur="8.19">operations and so they would be in tune</text>
  <text start="1815.89" dur="7.019">to order the units that go forward and a</text>
  <text start="1820.69" dur="4.29">rescue so you had dereliction of duty</text>
  <text start="1822.909" dur="4.531">from the White House all the way down</text>
  <text start="1824.98" dur="4.26">through the senior staff command and</text>
  <text start="1827.44" dur="6">staffs and these these different</text>
  <text start="1829.24" dur="6.11">organizations in Germany excuse me stand</text>
  <text start="1833.44" dur="4.83">out of Tampa Florida</text>
  <text start="1835.35" dur="4.93">well when did you bring thank you that</text>
  <text start="1838.27" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m just stunned by this when did you</text>
  <text start="1840.28" dur="4.47">bring forth your information from</text>
  <text start="1842.38" dur="6.45">CENTCOM and who did you try to provide</text>
  <text start="1844.75" dur="6.69">it to on 2013 I was still at work I was</text>
  <text start="1848.83" dur="4.77">having a dramatic issue that went on</text>
  <text start="1851.44" dur="5.369">stemming from another problem where</text>
  <text start="1853.6" dur="5.4">Central Command was kind of hinted after</text>
  <text start="1856.809" dur="4.23">bin Laden was killed to not report on</text>
  <text start="1859" dur="6.419">any sunni-led attacks which is al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1861.039" dur="6.601">which turned to Isis later but from 2013</text>
  <text start="1865.419" dur="3.631">forward I provided it to Congress people</text>
  <text start="1867.64" dur="3.45">and Senator</text>
  <text start="1869.05" dur="4.62">and then when the trey gowdy committee</text>
  <text start="1871.09" dur="4.8">was organized in 2014 I provided them</text>
  <text start="1873.67" dur="4.35">the roadmap of what they need and how to</text>
  <text start="1875.89" dur="4.5">get it what I gave them were facts and</text>
  <text start="1878.02" dur="4.74">evidence that were unclassified and how</text>
  <text start="1880.39" dur="4.94">to get to classified material and I</text>
  <text start="1882.76" dur="5.79">communicated with Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s committee</text>
  <text start="1885.33" dur="5.47">and the Democratic side no one was</text>

  <text start="1890.8" dur="4.29">14 or 15 times in the period of two</text>
  <text start="1893.26" dur="4.91">months and at that time the senior</text>
  <text start="1895.09" dur="5.16">investigator called me back which was a</text>
  <text start="1898.17" dur="3.67">what I understood at the time is a</text>
  <text start="1900.25" dur="4.41">retired colonel but I think he was still</text>
  <text start="1901.84" dur="4.89">active duty down at Chapman who told me</text>
  <text start="1904.66" dur="3.39">they didn&amp;#39;t want the information they</text>
  <text start="1906.73" dur="2.7">don&amp;#39;t want the evidence of the facts</text>
  <text start="1908.05" dur="4.11">they just don&amp;#39;t want to get Hillary</text>
  <text start="1909.43" dur="5.1">Clinton in office and it seemed like</text>
  <text start="1912.16" dur="5.52">such a failure to to go forward with the</text>
  <text start="1914.53" dur="4.98">Benghazi hearings without any facts or</text>
  <text start="1917.68" dur="3.81">evidence they had no intelligence</text>
  <text start="1919.51" dur="4.29">reports that were human or signals they</text>
  <text start="1921.49" dur="5.22">had no global command and communication</text>
  <text start="1923.8" dur="6.65">or control system imagery showing where</text>
  <text start="1926.71" dur="6.12">assets were they had no interviews with</text>
  <text start="1930.45" dur="5.02">lower-level commanders I had access to</text>
  <text start="1932.83" dur="4.71">troops and materiel in that area of</text>
  <text start="1935.47" dur="2.55">operation they didn&amp;#39;t have any of this</text>
  <text start="1937.54" dur="3">stuff</text>
  <text start="1938.02" dur="5.04">so again it&amp;#39;s like a case without any</text>
  <text start="1940.54" dur="4.08">real facts or evidence I mean it goes</text>
  <text start="1943.06" dur="4.26">back to what happened last week with dr.</text>
  <text start="1944.62" dur="4.98">hill you know I think I feel I&amp;#39;m a I</text>
  <text start="1947.32" dur="4.23">mean you know these opinions they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1949.6" dur="5.03">here saying they&amp;#39;re garbage they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1951.55" dur="6.6">matter I mean the facts matter so and</text>
  <text start="1954.63" dur="5.14">they all serve to cover up the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1958.15" dur="4.35">machine that was involved in this and</text>
  <text start="1959.77" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s where we think very Craig addy</text>
  <text start="1962.5" dur="6.15">was basically compromised by the Clinton</text>
  <text start="1966.16" dur="4.83">machine but all of its were made by the</text>
  <text start="1968.65" dur="4.02">deep state at that time was in effect</text>
  <text start="1970.99" dur="4.8">and very strong so we go all the way</text>
  <text start="1972.67" dur="5.16">back on that deep state the people that</text>
  <text start="1975.79" dur="4.05">are in the chain of command at the State</text>
  <text start="1977.83" dur="4.41">Department and Department of Defense and</text>
  <text start="1979.84" dur="5.25">and so on in the White House National</text>
  <text start="1982.24" dur="4.53">Security Council and so we can see now</text>
  <text start="1985.09" dur="4.92">today what&amp;#39;s been happening with the</text>
  <text start="1986.77" dur="6.36">Russian collusion and now the Craig</text>

  <text start="1993.13" dur="5.61">working to protect the the people above</text>
  <text start="1996.07" dur="5.1">and we had not put one person in jail</text>
  <text start="1998.74" dur="2.85">yet or indicted and this is has to be</text>
  <text start="2001.17" dur="1.729">done</text>
  <text start="2001.59" dur="4.85">because it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2002.899" dur="5.91">Jennsen duty tracy yes</text>
  <text start="2006.44" dur="4.169">the the main reason for the Benghazi</text>
  <text start="2008.809" dur="3.271">being brought up again is not just for</text>
  <text start="2010.609" dur="3.93">closure for the families and to get</text>
  <text start="2012.08" dur="4.319">justice for the fallen but it is also to</text>
  <text start="2014.539" dur="3.87">remove these obstructionists from within</text>
  <text start="2016.399" dur="4.35">government remember a lot of people that</text>

  <text start="2024.859" dur="5.49">much higher rank or much higher up and</text>
  <text start="2026.889" dur="5.77">they are obstructionists and this is why</text>
  <text start="2030.349" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re trying to ask the president to get</text>
  <text start="2032.659" dur="3.87">an executive order to review the facts</text>
  <text start="2034.549" dur="4.11">and put some of these people in jail</text>
  <text start="2036.529" dur="4.74">charged and military folks under uniform</text>
  <text start="2038.659" dur="4.98">code of military justice or UCMJ and the</text>
  <text start="2041.269" dur="4.14">civilians under federal law and this</text>
  <text start="2043.639" dur="3.63">will put to rest a lot of these</text>
  <text start="2045.409" dur="3.24">obstructionists that are in government</text>
  <text start="2047.269" dur="4.951">today preventing the president from</text>
  <text start="2048.649" dur="6.15">doing his job I can only imagine how</text>
  <text start="2052.22" dur="5.129">frustrating it has to be to be you guys</text>

  <text start="2509.5" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="2511.06" dur="3.78">and coincidentally he&amp;#39;s one of the ones</text>
  <text start="2513.67" dur="5.22">that didn&amp;#39;t get interviewed by the</text>
  <text start="2514.84" dur="6.03">committee remember well let me explain</text>
  <text start="2518.89" dur="4.02">what happened apparently General</text>
  <text start="2520.87" dur="6.44">Petraeus had a little tiff with a woman</text>
  <text start="2522.91" dur="8.13">by the name of what was her name kelly</text>
  <text start="2527.31" dur="6.49">reporter no no no no some Arab woman</text>
  <text start="2531.04" dur="3.39">down here Lebanese woman jill kelly</text>
  <text start="2533.8" dur="3.16">that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="2534.43" dur="3.97">and jill kelly exposed back</text>
  <text start="2536.96" dur="4.23">was having an affair with major</text>
  <text start="2538.4" dur="5.189">Broadwell and military or government it</text>
  <text start="2541.19" dur="5.28">is a crime to have basically</text>
  <text start="2543.589" dur="4.591">extramarital affairs or adultery and so</text>
  <text start="2546.47" dur="4.47">because of that whole incident there was</text>
  <text start="2548.18" dur="7.439">very minor he was recused from having to</text>
  <text start="2550.94" dur="7.44">testify that was my boss in 101st he was</text>
  <text start="2555.619" dur="4.561">also my boss in Iraq when he was above</text>
  <text start="2558.38" dur="4.8">the Corps commander or general or de</text>
  <text start="2560.18" dur="5.28">niro and there was some issues with him</text>
  <text start="2563.18" dur="4.2">that had a lot of people have had about</text>
  <text start="2565.46" dur="5.399">his methodology but when he took over</text>
  <text start="2567.38" dur="5.939">CIA he he was involved with the whole</text>
  <text start="2570.859" dur="5.911">Benghazi thing and then got to skate</text>
  <text start="2573.319" dur="6.571">without speaking before the committee so</text>
  <text start="2576.77" dur="5.73">now we&amp;#39;re at a point where we need an</text>
  <text start="2579.89" dur="4.469">executive order to declassify the</text>
  <text start="2582.5" dur="3.96">intelligence that you folks are talking</text>
  <text start="2584.359" dur="3.781">about so that it is viewable to the</text>
  <text start="2586.46" dur="4.92">president who can then take action on it</text>
  <text start="2588.14" dur="5.219">correct no the president has access to</text>
  <text start="2591.38" dur="4.05">classified material most of this is at</text>
  <text start="2593.359" dur="4.321">the secret level anyways he should be</text>
  <text start="2595.43" dur="3.689">able to have purview to read it but what</text>
  <text start="2597.68" dur="3.75">he would do is just issue an executive</text>
  <text start="2599.119" dur="4.531">order and that order would allow for</text>
  <text start="2601.43" dur="4.47">these agencies to call up their data</text>
  <text start="2603.65" dur="4.919">archives and bring out that material and</text>
  <text start="2605.9" dur="5.34">let his own legal experts through the</text>
  <text start="2608.569" dur="5.01">Department of Justice and the Jag Corps</text>
  <text start="2611.24" dur="4.379">from the military review it and they</text>
  <text start="2613.579" dur="3.571">could see who gave what orders and who</text>
  <text start="2615.619" dur="3.391">did that make a recommendation to the</text>
  <text start="2617.15" dur="4.77">president and he could go ahead and say</text>
  <text start="2619.01" dur="5.25">whether he wants to charge them or just</text>
  <text start="2621.92" dur="3.96">you know remove them from office he</text>
  <text start="2624.26" dur="3.45">could make those decisions and then come</text>
  <text start="2625.88" dur="4.11">out with a public statement once the</text>
  <text start="2627.71" dur="3.659">public statement is made potential would</text>
  <text start="2629.99" dur="3.39">be classifying some of that may be</text>
  <text start="2631.369" dur="3.901">eligible but the more important part</text>
  <text start="2633.38" dur="3.479">would be some of the obstructionists</text>
  <text start="2635.27" dur="2.849">would be gone and then he sends a</text>
  <text start="2636.859" dur="3.361">message to the rest of the obstruction</text>
  <text start="2638.119" dur="4.74">this you better fall in line or leave my</text>
  <text start="2640.22" dur="4.74">government and let me do my job so it</text>
  <text start="2642.859" dur="3.781">would be a great example and of course</text>
  <text start="2644.96" dur="3.27">most importantly would be closure for</text>
  <text start="2646.64" dur="4.53">these families you know mr. woods is a</text>
  <text start="2648.23" dur="5.04">retired judge and and for him to have to</text>
  <text start="2651.17" dur="4.669">go through the indignities of the lies</text>
  <text start="2653.27" dur="5.22">oh my god I mean I can&amp;#39;t even imagine</text>
  <text start="2655.839" dur="4.901">you know how many stories and he&amp;#39;s told</text>
  <text start="2658.49" dur="4.109">me he&amp;#39;s been told by so many people is</text>
  <text start="2660.74" dur="4.26">horrible including the president who</text>
  <text start="2662.599" dur="3.781">wrote him a letter stating that they did</text>
  <text start="2665" dur="2.79">everything that they could and even if</text>
  <text start="2666.38" dur="4.08">they wanted to do anything it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2667.79" dur="5.67">have been successful anyway correct</text>
  <text start="2670.46" dur="5.099">yes he advised me about that I heard</text>
  <text start="2673.46" dur="4.29">that letter read I think Nick you you</text>
  <text start="2675.559" dur="5.161">were on the show with dr. Jan to that</text>
  <text start="2677.75" dur="5.91">day right yeah it made me sick to my</text>
  <text start="2680.72" dur="6.21">stomach the poor guy I feel so horrible</text>
  <text start="2683.66" dur="4.08">you know I know everybody here is very</text>
  <text start="2686.93" dur="2.97">to-the-point</text>
  <text start="2687.74" dur="5.069">I I know that speculation isn&amp;#39;t isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2689.9" dur="5.31">something that anyone likes to do was</text>
  <text start="2692.809" dur="4.02">was ambassador Stevens involved in this</text>
  <text start="2695.21" dur="3.99">do you think or do you think he was</text>
  <text start="2696.829" dur="4.471">collateral was there it was he gonna</text>
  <text start="2699.2" dur="4.02">blow the whistle was he you know was he</text>
  <text start="2701.3" dur="5.16">cuz he was newer to the post anyway and</text>
  <text start="2703.22" dur="5.849">he was waving his arms for help for a</text>
  <text start="2706.46" dur="6.09">long time what happened there do you</text>
  <text start="2709.069" dur="6.121">think if you feel like sharing I would</text>
  <text start="2712.55" dur="4.529">tell you that I have no knowledge of any</text>
  <text start="2715.19" dur="4.71">involvement with him but I can tell you</text>
  <text start="2717.079" dur="5.341">that we do need to look into that and</text>
  <text start="2719.9" dur="4.409">see what he was involved with and that</text>
  <text start="2722.42" dur="3.6">does need to be declassified I think the</text>
  <text start="2724.309" dur="4.591">American public needs to understand why</text>
  <text start="2726.02" dur="5.789">a us sitting ambassador who sat in a</text>
  <text start="2728.9" dur="5.58">hostile zone with security lessened and</text>
  <text start="2731.809" dur="4.5">was allowed to stay at his small annex</text>
  <text start="2734.48" dur="4.379">away from the main embassy without real</text>
  <text start="2736.309" dur="5.071">security of any kind needs to be</text>
  <text start="2738.859" dur="4.95">divulged I think that everybody has a</text>
  <text start="2741.38" dur="4.86">right to know that you know regardless</text>
  <text start="2743.809" dur="3.931">of anything I I don&amp;#39;t know and I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2746.24" dur="2.819">speculate on that because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2747.74" dur="2.849">what he was involved with but I think</text>
  <text start="2749.059" dur="4.29">that does need to come out and be</text>
  <text start="2750.589" dur="4.891">unclassified or Declassified or even</text>
  <text start="2753.349" dur="4.441">redacted to somewhat be classifying it</text>
  <text start="2755.48" dur="5.67">to allow people to have closure on that</text>
  <text start="2757.79" dur="7.89">matter so Joshua when did you did you</text>
  <text start="2761.15" dur="8.399">come forward with Nick or or after after</text>
  <text start="2765.68" dur="6.119">Nick mentioned it to me I don&amp;#39;t know we</text>
  <text start="2769.549" dur="3.991">had talked about this you know Benghazi</text>
  <text start="2771.799" dur="2.941">probably multiple times and just</text>
  <text start="2773.54" dur="4.799">happened to be one of the times that we</text>
  <text start="2774.74" dur="5.52">were talking about what went down he had</text>
  <text start="2778.339" dur="3.541">mentioned that he had you know started</text>
  <text start="2780.26" dur="3.99">coming forward with information asked if</text>
  <text start="2781.88" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;d you know mine coming up coming on</text>
  <text start="2784.25" dur="5.43">board just there out you know my</text>
  <text start="2786.5" dur="4.559">experience with it and what I knew you</text>
  <text start="2789.68" dur="2.82">know from the night I&amp;#39;m working it and</text>
  <text start="2791.059" dur="4.881">everything and it just kind of rolled</text>
  <text start="2792.5" dur="6.54">from there so just to clarify</text>
  <text start="2795.94" dur="4.899">everybody&amp;#39;s roles here again Joshua and</text>
  <text start="2799.04" dur="4.229">Nick you guys were in the same location</text>
  <text start="2800.839" dur="5.63">physically floors apart from one</text>
  <text start="2803.269" dur="6.68">there and you were both responsible for</text>
  <text start="2806.469" dur="5.53">assets right and moving you know</text>
  <text start="2809.949" dur="4.12">accounting for where people were where</text>
  <text start="2811.999" dur="4.41">assets were where drones were where</text>
  <text start="2814.069" dur="4.26">ships were that that sort of a thing</text>
  <text start="2816.409" dur="4.26">that was that was my main my main</text>
  <text start="2818.329" dur="5.21">purpose but Josh was more involved with</text>
  <text start="2820.669" dur="6.18">the dynamic aspects of operations and</text>
  <text start="2823.539" dur="4.841">and decision-making and things like that</text>
  <text start="2826.849" dur="4.2">he was involved with that more I was</text>
  <text start="2828.38" dur="4.889">just an observer so Joshua you were</text>
  <text start="2831.049" dur="4.74">given a stand-down order did not move</text>
  <text start="2833.269" dur="4.92">anything and just basically ignore what</text>
  <text start="2835.789" dur="3.75">was going on and and just told to ignore</text>
  <text start="2838.189" dur="6.53">it turn the other way</text>
  <text start="2839.539" dur="7.56">not not pay any attention essentially</text>
  <text start="2844.719" dur="7.87">essentially what he said the words stand</text>
  <text start="2847.099" dur="7.32">down weren&amp;#39;t said directly basically he</text>
  <text start="2852.589" dur="4.77">said yes that there&amp;#39;s that there was</text>
  <text start="2854.419" dur="4.86">nothing we could do from there so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2857.359" dur="3.45">bother calling anybody and so</text>
  <text start="2859.279" dur="2.55">essentially we you know just sitting</text>
  <text start="2860.809" dur="2.16">your hands and don&amp;#39;t really do anything</text>
  <text start="2861.829" dur="2.58">I mean you were presenting him the</text>
  <text start="2862.969" dur="3.9">information we presented it to the</text>
  <text start="2864.409" dur="5.04">predator ellen:oh which evidently I</text>
  <text start="2866.869" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t know how far that got to be honest</text>
  <text start="2869.449" dur="3.87">because I was finishing up trying to</text>
  <text start="2871.309" dur="3.72">maintain the timeline that I had from</text>
  <text start="2873.319" dur="4.23">and you know passing information around</text>
  <text start="2875.029" dur="4.44">to the different entities that we you</text>
  <text start="2877.549" dur="3.81">know kept in contact with to make sure</text>
  <text start="2879.469" dur="3.33">but he you know was on the same page</text>
  <text start="2881.359" dur="3.69">they were still seeing it and you know</text>
  <text start="2882.799" dur="4.2">what was going on and everything and to</text>
  <text start="2885.049" dur="5.55">maintain our situational awareness on it</text>
  <text start="2886.999" dur="8.82">for our superiors may came in and that</text>
  <text start="2890.599" dur="7.38">was a whole awesome morning though there</text>
  <text start="2895.819" dur="4.77">are so many people involved here it</text>
  <text start="2897.979" dur="4.92">makes it makes it so hard like it&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="2900.589" dur="6.53">can&amp;#39;t believe that there aren&amp;#39;t hundreds</text>
  <text start="2902.899" dur="7.05">of you guys making noise about this I</text>
  <text start="2907.119" dur="5.68">can tell you that a lot of people like a</text>
  <text start="2909.949" dur="5.7">advised earlier yeah we were given</text>
  <text start="2912.799" dur="3.93">orders not to speak about it the problem</text>
  <text start="2915.649" dur="3.63">with some people is they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2916.729" dur="5.67">understand what an unlawful order is to</text>
  <text start="2919.279" dur="5.07">not rescue to order a stand down is an</text>
  <text start="2922.399" dur="3.36">unlawful order that should have been</text>
  <text start="2924.349" dur="3.39">ignored by commanders and they should</text>
  <text start="2925.759" dur="4.2">have rescued should they have chosen to</text>
  <text start="2927.739" dur="3.84">you know abide by that order they should</text>
  <text start="2929.959" dur="3.81">have been relieved and other commanders</text>
  <text start="2931.579" dur="4.32">should have taken charge to conduct a</text>
  <text start="2933.769" dur="3.151">rescue but when you fast forward after</text>
  <text start="2935.899" dur="3.511">the attacks</text>
  <text start="2936.92" dur="4.71">then orders are issued down to people to</text>
  <text start="2939.41" dur="3.9">be quiet about this you let the State</text>
  <text start="2941.63" dur="4.29">Department you let the White House you</text>
  <text start="2943.31" dur="5.07">let others handle the media and the</text>
  <text start="2945.92" dur="4.41">messaging and that&amp;#39;s very clear that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2948.38" dur="4.14">why when we came back in the following</text>
  <text start="2950.33" dur="4.08">day we were told to turn in everything</text>
  <text start="2952.52" dur="3.6">we had on Benghazi that there will be a</text>
  <text start="2954.41" dur="4.14">full hearing and investigation conducted</text>
  <text start="2956.12" dur="4.32">by the Department of Defense on my end</text>
  <text start="2958.55" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m sure that happened in other agencies</text>
  <text start="2960.44" dur="4.35">to anybody that wishes to speak about</text>
  <text start="2962.75" dur="3.54">this their careers were threatened</text>
  <text start="2964.79" dur="2.64">for instance that evening during the</text>
  <text start="2966.29" dur="2.94">training exercise I got in trouble</text>
  <text start="2967.43" dur="3.81">multiple times for trying to bring this</text>
  <text start="2969.23" dur="4.02">up I tried to the open door</text>
  <text start="2971.24" dur="3.84">general mattis who was my commander and</text>
  <text start="2973.25" dur="3.69">say I want to speak to the general about</text>
  <text start="2975.08" dur="3.96">this we can&amp;#39;t sit down and just ignore</text>
  <text start="2976.94" dur="3.9">this attack I was told to shut up and</text>
  <text start="2979.04" dur="3.57">mind my business by a lot of people I</text>
  <text start="2980.84" dur="3.36">mean I almost came to fisticuffs with</text>
  <text start="2982.61" dur="3.03">somebody but I&amp;#39;m not gonna get into that</text>
  <text start="2984.2" dur="2.88">I&amp;#39;m just saying that this has never</text>
  <text start="2985.64" dur="5.81">happened before that I&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text>
  <text start="2987.08" dur="9.51">military for now 23 plus years almost 24</text>
  <text start="2991.45" dur="6.67">I&amp;#39;m sitting here like I give you credit</text>
  <text start="2996.59" dur="4.58">I really do what you&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="2998.12" dur="5.88">is super brave and and it&amp;#39;s patriotic</text>
  <text start="3001.17" dur="4.75">but I just can&amp;#39;t even imagine having to</text>
  <text start="3004" dur="4.5">live with being in that situation and</text>
  <text start="3005.92" dur="5.07">handcuffed like that when you know that</text>
  <text start="3008.5" dur="5.04">you know this isn&amp;#39;t right and it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="3010.99" dur="4.17">to be hard I don&amp;#39;t even know how else</text>
  <text start="3013.54" dur="10.16">how do you guys deal with that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3015.16" dur="10.92">got to be really hard job just bury it</text>
  <text start="3023.7" dur="4">that&amp;#39;s what I did I&amp;#39;m not saying it was</text>
  <text start="3026.08" dur="5.01">the most appropriate way to go about it</text>
  <text start="3027.7" dur="5.24">but that was that was my that was my way</text>
  <text start="3031.09" dur="5.07">of dealing with it because you have to</text>
  <text start="3032.94" dur="5.05">at least we generally did because then</text>
  <text start="3036.16" dur="3.02">the next day there&amp;#39;s gonna be more</text>
  <text start="3037.99" dur="4.62">missions there&amp;#39;s gonna be more</text>
  <text start="3039.18" dur="6.73">intelligence to follow you know we went</text>
  <text start="3042.61" dur="5.25">into the next 30 days of monitoring all</text>
  <text start="3045.91" dur="4.32">this stuff going on with the embassies</text>
  <text start="3047.86" dur="3.9">around Africa because of the whole thing</text>
  <text start="3050.23" dur="2.88">that went on with Benghazi and all that</text>
  <text start="3051.76" dur="2.7">so that turned into us it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="3053.11" dur="3.23">what I mean so it&amp;#39;s one thing after or</text>
  <text start="3054.46" dur="3.96">not it&amp;#39;s always gonna be another mission</text>
  <text start="3056.34" dur="4.15">so you got to have your head on straight</text>
  <text start="3058.42" dur="5.37">to deal with all that or try doing it</text>
  <text start="3060.49" dur="5.07">how do you even trust that everything</text>
  <text start="3063.79" dur="3.69">that you&amp;#39;re seeing after experiencing</text>
  <text start="3065.56" dur="4.35">something like you guys did is what it</text>
  <text start="3067.48" dur="3.829">is like I would be questioning</text>
  <text start="3069.91" dur="3.75">everything after that like is this even</text>
  <text start="3071.309" dur="4.601">real like what&amp;#39;s going on here are these</text>
  <text start="3073.66" dur="5.61">even our our enemy like how do you know</text>
  <text start="3075.91" dur="5.85">what I mean I just do you question came</text>
  <text start="3079.27" dur="4.5">out that way oh absolutely it came out</text>
  <text start="3081.76" dur="3.75">that way but again once you start</text>
  <text start="3083.77" dur="4.5">questioning things like in my case you</text>
  <text start="3085.51" dur="6.299">get reassigned to a different slot you</text>
  <text start="3088.27" dur="4.92">get kind of like negative feedback that</text>
  <text start="3091.809" dur="3.331">comes to you in the form of your</text>
  <text start="3093.19" dur="4.169">evaluation reports you get a lot of</text>
  <text start="3095.14" dur="4.169">things that happen for you and the</text>
  <text start="3097.359" dur="4.591">problem is is that Josh and Nick were</text>
  <text start="3099.309" dur="4.351">lower ranked than I was so I could run</text>
  <text start="3101.95" dur="3.57">my mouth and I could fight more which is</text>
  <text start="3103.66" dur="4.139">what I did throughout the night and to</text>
  <text start="3105.52" dur="4.44">the next day but I paid the piper for</text>
  <text start="3107.799" dur="3.421">that now Josh and Nick they they have to</text>
  <text start="3109.96" dur="3.659">stay kind of quiet because they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3111.22" dur="4.26">sure as far as they could go yeah the</text>
  <text start="3113.619" dur="3.121">problem the problem is is that in the</text>
  <text start="3115.48" dur="4.079">United States military</text>
  <text start="3116.74" dur="6.29">we trained to lead we don&amp;#39;t leave the</text>
  <text start="3119.559" dur="6.391">lead so training to lead includes</text>
  <text start="3123.03" dur="5.589">training you whether your lowest rank or</text>
  <text start="3125.95" dur="4.29">a seniors rank to out up speak and to go</text>
  <text start="3128.619" dur="3.42">after people that aren&amp;#39;t doing the right</text>
  <text start="3130.24" dur="4.079">thing and if they&amp;#39;re following an</text>
  <text start="3132.039" dur="4.381">unlawful order we&amp;#39;re issuing an unlawful</text>
  <text start="3134.319" dur="4.23">order that needs to be brought out and</text>
  <text start="3136.42" dur="3.99">repercussions are not authorized</text>
  <text start="3138.549" dur="4.02">normally that doesn&amp;#39;t happen but it does</text>
  <text start="3140.41" dur="4.02">in reality it did happen to quite a few</text>
  <text start="3142.569" dur="2.941">people so I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="3144.43" dur="2.609">people out there that want to come</text>
  <text start="3145.51" dur="3.75">forward and speak I think that a lot of</text>
  <text start="3147.039" dur="4.32">people that try to got in all kinds of</text>
  <text start="3149.26" dur="3.48">trouble I mean we can liken this all</text>
  <text start="3151.359" dur="4.131">kinds of different events that have</text>
  <text start="3152.74" dur="6.089">taken place recently with these these</text>
  <text start="3155.49" dur="6.339">impeachment inquiry hearings which were</text>
  <text start="3158.829" dur="4.5">you know garbage a lot of people got up</text>
  <text start="3161.829" dur="2.941">there and they tried to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="3163.329" dur="3.091">Congress and they tried to do things</text>
  <text start="3164.77" dur="3.96">that were probably given an ultimatum</text>
  <text start="3166.42" dur="3.78">that you do it this way where else and</text>
  <text start="3168.73" dur="3.389">I&amp;#39;m sure that that&amp;#39;s what they had to do</text>
  <text start="3170.2" dur="3.48">some of them didn&amp;#39;t though some of them</text>
  <text start="3172.119" dur="4.291">volunteered to do it because they want</text>
  <text start="3173.68" dur="5.28">to be on that opposite side so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="3176.41" dur="5.159">difficult for soldiers to go forward and</text>
  <text start="3178.96" dur="4.649">to make those those kinds of changes and</text>
  <text start="3181.569" dur="3.931">affect them at their levels and the</text>
  <text start="3183.609" dur="4.321">hardest part is when your command lies</text>
  <text start="3185.5" dur="4.049">to you and says to you well other units</text>
  <text start="3187.93" dur="3.57">are handling it you know we have other</text>
  <text start="3189.549" dur="3.631">units in route we have the unit&amp;#39;s fixing</text>
  <text start="3191.5" dur="2.309">it the State Department&amp;#39;s got it under</text>
  <text start="3193.18" dur="2.34">control</text>
  <text start="3193.809" dur="3.03">I mean a lot of this was what was coming</text>
  <text start="3195.52" dur="3.69">out at CENTCOM during our training</text>
  <text start="3196.839" dur="3.2">exercise and that turned out not to be</text>
  <text start="3199.21" dur="4.02">true</text>
  <text start="3200.039" dur="3.671">how often I don&amp;#39;t you know you guys have</text>
  <text start="3203.23" dur="2.31">to have some</text>
  <text start="3203.71" dur="3.84">friends that are still enlisted in stuff</text>
  <text start="3205.54" dur="3.51">today talk about the Dozen does this</text>
  <text start="3207.55" dur="4.17">come up or is this something that people</text>
  <text start="3209.05" dur="4.26">just forgot about well there were so</text>
  <text start="3211.72" dur="3.18">many negative incidents there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="3213.31" dur="3.12">people bring this up but they bring up a</text>
  <text start="3214.9" dur="4.77">lot of other incidences too that took</text>
  <text start="3216.43" dur="4.71">place in the military yeah I know some</text>
  <text start="3219.67" dur="5.34">people that are still in and then they</text>
  <text start="3221.14" dur="5.719">will not talk about it a con record or</text>
  <text start="3225.01" dur="3.78">anything like that</text>
  <text start="3226.859" dur="4.421">it&amp;#39;s pretty bad and I want to add</text>
  <text start="3228.79" dur="3.6">something else in there that many people</text>
  <text start="3231.28" dur="3.319">probably don&amp;#39;t know about is that when</text>
  <text start="3232.39" dur="8.16">Josh referred to the predator elinoz</text>
  <text start="3234.599" dur="8.891">those people were a TDY a its rotation</text>
  <text start="3240.55" dur="4.319">basically these drone pilots and they</text>
  <text start="3243.49" dur="3.03">worked at another base so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3244.869" dur="2.461">another another base that was aware of</text>
  <text start="3246.52" dur="3.599">what was going on</text>
  <text start="3247.33" dur="6.12">- I&amp;#39;m not sure if I can talk about what</text>
  <text start="3250.119" dur="6.631">base that was but there were more people</text>
  <text start="3253.45" dur="4.8">that knew about it as well and and for</text>
  <text start="3256.75" dur="1.92">me I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t say anything about</text>
  <text start="3258.25" dur="3.15">it</text>
  <text start="3258.67" dur="5.82">I actually was afraid that I could I</text>
  <text start="3261.4" dur="4.35">could get killed because he had all the</text>
  <text start="3264.49" dur="4.2">information they were all the assets</text>
  <text start="3265.75" dur="5.339">were and whatnot but my next base I did</text>
  <text start="3268.69" dur="3.99">not talk to anybody hardly because I was</text>
  <text start="3271.089" dur="4.111">afraid that I would say something and</text>
  <text start="3272.68" dur="4.26">the men and I did you know I could go to</text>
  <text start="3275.2" dur="4.8">I could go to jail or whatever the case</text>
  <text start="3276.94" dur="5.82">is and and then and or the same people</text>
  <text start="3280" dur="5.16">that our government at the time could go</text>
  <text start="3282.76" dur="6.21">ahead and just eliminate me as a threat</text>
  <text start="3285.16" dur="5.939">you know just you know that&amp;#39;s and and so</text>
  <text start="3288.97" dur="5.28">I I didn&amp;#39;t really talk to anybody and it</text>
  <text start="3291.099" dur="5.611">was kind of a dark time for myself and I</text>
  <text start="3294.25" dur="5.04">just sat in isolation and my next base</text>
  <text start="3296.71" dur="6.45">didn&amp;#39;t talk to anybody or really</text>
  <text start="3299.29" dur="5.16">socialized too much and I&amp;#39;m glad that</text>
  <text start="3303.16" dur="2.82">everything is coming as kind of</text>
  <text start="3304.45" dur="5.1">therapeutic for me and I&amp;#39;m sure it is</text>
  <text start="3305.98" dur="7.65">for Josh and will as well - to finally</text>
  <text start="3309.55" dur="7.41">be able to talk about everything if</text>
  <text start="3313.63" dur="4.92">nothing else you know we over the past I</text>
  <text start="3316.96" dur="4.68">guess several months I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="3318.55" dur="4.59">to a lot of people that are it seems</text>
  <text start="3321.64" dur="3.41">like there&amp;#39;s an influx of folks who feel</text>
  <text start="3323.14" dur="3.36">comfortable enough now to share stories</text>
  <text start="3325.05" dur="3.37">whistleblowers from within the</text>
  <text start="3326.5" dur="3.03">government contractors etc that feel</text>
  <text start="3328.42" dur="3.12">comfortable enough to share their</text>
  <text start="3329.53" dur="4.65">stories with people because it is a more</text>
  <text start="3331.54" dur="4.59">friendly environment for them given that</text>
  <text start="3334.18" dur="2.33">everybody seems to be fighting the same</text>
  <text start="3336.13" dur="3.35">and</text>
  <text start="3336.51" dur="4.44">now right you know you&amp;#39;re either on one</text>
  <text start="3339.48" dur="4.71">side or the other there&amp;#39;s really not too</text>
  <text start="3340.95" dur="4.47">much gray do you think I guess this will</text>
  <text start="3344.19" dur="2.91">be the last question it&amp;#39;s an opinion</text>
  <text start="3345.42" dur="4.05">question and I need to have you guys</text>
  <text start="3347.1" dur="6.09">back because I I could go on for hours</text>
  <text start="3349.47" dur="5.82">with you folks do you think that any of</text>
  <text start="3353.19" dur="7.61">this contributed to the reason why Gaudi</text>
  <text start="3355.29" dur="9.78">is no longer in Congress or the Senate</text>
  <text start="3360.8" dur="5.83">um I I can&amp;#39;t comment on that I&amp;#39;m sorry I</text>
  <text start="3365.07" dur="3.15">just I don&amp;#39;t have an opinion on that one</text>
  <text start="3366.63" dur="4.05">way or another I don&amp;#39;t know any facts</text>
  <text start="3368.22" dur="4.08">about that I know general Vallely</text>
  <text start="3370.68" dur="3.72">mentioned he was compromised with</text>
  <text start="3372.3" dur="4.83">something I know he&amp;#39;s got more details</text>
  <text start="3374.4" dur="4.43">and then I would I have no clue as to</text>
  <text start="3377.13" dur="3.54">why he would have been removed though</text>
  <text start="3378.83" dur="6.19">anyone else want to say anything about</text>
  <text start="3380.67" dur="6.18">that not necessary but I think that he</text>
  <text start="3385.02" dur="2.85">wouldn&amp;#39;t have been invited to help the</text>
  <text start="3386.85" dur="6.06">administration the current</text>
  <text start="3387.87" dur="6.69">administration if his outside issues</text>
  <text start="3392.91" dur="4.46">have been met not been mitigated so I</text>
  <text start="3394.56" dur="5.19">think he&amp;#39;s in good shape right now</text>
  <text start="3397.37" dur="4.3">anything you guys want to say that the</text>
  <text start="3399.75" dur="4.14">people listening before we go today this</text>
