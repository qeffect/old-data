  <text start="6" dur="6.269">every couple of days I take a look</text>
  <text start="8.13" dur="6.54">through some of my saved searches or</text>
  <text start="12.269" dur="3.751">saved queries on pacer to take a look</text>
  <text start="14.67" dur="3.54">and see what&amp;#39;s going on behind the</text>
  <text start="16.02" dur="4.169">scenes that we don&amp;#39;t know about and I</text>
  <text start="18.21" dur="5.1">noticed an update in the Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="20.189" dur="6.121">case that is super intriguing super</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="5.25">intriguing yesterday there was a motion</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="4.32">for a protective order filed and then an</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="10.35">order on the motion for protective order</text>
  <text start="30.63" dur="10.769">and what it is is this protective order</text>
  <text start="38.91" dur="3.84">governing discovery this is interesting</text>
  <text start="41.399" dur="3.061">why is this interesting</text>
  <text start="42.75" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s gonna be very fast video I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="5.939">an attorney I don&amp;#39;t play one on TV</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="5.22">either I don&amp;#39;t have legal background or</text>
  <text start="50.399" dur="4.23">legal you know I wasn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="52.11" dur="3.69">scholar I don&amp;#39;t know I just know what I</text>
  <text start="54.629" dur="4.471">read and what I learned through</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="4.95">researching and stuff so somebody will</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="4.65">correct me I&amp;#39;m sure if I&amp;#39;m incorrect on</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="4.769">this but he pled guilty to tons of chart</text>
  <text start="63.75" dur="4.95">you know to lying to investigators and</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="5.761">here he isn&amp;#39;t his transcript on at his</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="4.349">plea hearing where he says I&amp;#39;m pleading</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="3.93">guilty to this stuff and the next thing</text>
  <text start="73.049" dur="3.811">should be sentencing right he pled</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="4.32">guilty he&amp;#39;s guilty of the charges</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="5.759">against him he goes to sentencing well</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="6.36">for some odd reason this case seems to</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="6.661">be following the same thread that the</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="5.939">Flynn case is following now the</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="4.26">government and the you know the the</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="3.301">prosecution and the defense have come to</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="5.85">an understanding that they want</text>
  <text start="95.13" dur="7.199">discovery the prosecution is going to be</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="5.46">sharing everything that they used to</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="5.161">come to their charges with the defendant</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="5.28">why would he need that stuff if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="4.47">going to be pleading guilty probably</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="4.86">because he&amp;#39;s starting to change his mind</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="5.58">and that&amp;#39;s really interesting to me now</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="5.22">this just happened yesterday the</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="6.35">defendants attorney signed this form on</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="3.68">the 9th which would have made it</text>
  <text start="125.299" dur="6.19">Thursday</text>
  <text start="127.799" dur="8.371">the decision was made yesterday by judge</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="6.181">moss and this is basically just a thing</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="3.09">that says this order says you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="2.789">allowed to tell anyone about this stuff</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;ll have to keep this stuff to</text>
  <text start="140.459" dur="3.631">yourself you&amp;#39;re only allowed to let</text>
  <text start="142.41" dur="4.2">people see it if they sign this form</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="7.2">it&amp;#39;s you know one of those things why</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="7.31">though is Papadopoulos going through</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="4.74">discovery if he&amp;#39;s pleading guilty</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="4">Papadopoulos has been a sticking point</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="4.23">for me from the very beginning and my</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="3.8">theory on Papadopoulos has been that he</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="3.72">was a plant inside the Trump team</text>
  <text start="161.72" dur="6.19">because of the way he handled himself</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="6.69">because of the way he was overt in his</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="4.409">emails and his interactions with the</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="2.909">campaign because of his connections</text>
  <text start="172.319" dur="4.23">because of the connections of his</text>
  <text start="173.579" dur="5.94">fiancee because his fiancee was very</text>
  <text start="176.549" dur="5.011">close to Mifsud all you know she I had</text>
  <text start="179.519" dur="3.78">gone through Papadopoulos a gazillion</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="3.63">times on my channel I&amp;#39;ll put all of my</text>
  <text start="183.299" dur="3.211">Papadopoulos videos in the description</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="2.45">box for you because they&amp;#39;re definitely</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="4.71">worth watching</text>
  <text start="187.64" dur="5.86">you know man Jeon Tay has come out and</text>

  <text start="193.5" dur="2.85">things about the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="3.96">colluding with the Russians and then all</text>

  <text start="215.79" dur="5.52">know is I think that Papadopoulos might</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="5.549">be weighing his options in revoking his</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="5.039">plea you know reneging on his plea deal</text>

  <text start="228.48" dur="4.939">government that we don&amp;#39;t know yet and</text>
