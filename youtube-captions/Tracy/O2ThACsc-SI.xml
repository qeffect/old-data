  <text start="298.5" dur="6.06">need to put aside the time so I know</text>

  <text start="304.56" dur="4.13">people haven&amp;#39;t been complaining about</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="5.01">how long the interview is which I was</text>

  <text start="361.56" dur="4.23">reason why people aren&amp;#39;t complaining</text>

  <text start="371.91" dur="4.92">yeah and and you know so much</text>
  <text start="375.24" dur="3.84">speculation out there as to how the</text>

  <text start="379.08" dur="4.11">of government really did the</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="4.05">machinations of it all and here it is</text>

  <text start="401.82" dur="5.94">mouth what happened now in addition to</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="5.37">that he also told me that I would he</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="4.89">would he reached out to one of the</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="5.79">people on his side one of his allies in</text>

  <text start="415.53" dur="4.56">bureau for 40 years who he sat next to</text>
  <text start="417.54" dur="4.14">throughout this escapade where the</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="4.14">government basically said to him and yet</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="3.84">let me just quickly recap this gentleman</text>
  <text start="424.23" dur="3.3">was an accountant who was very familiar</text>
  <text start="425.52" dur="3.81">with yellowbook procedure yellowbook</text>
  <text start="427.53" dur="4.05">procedure is basically how you run an</text>
  <text start="429.33" dur="4.26">audit the the policies that go behind it</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s just like basically like the the</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="4.62">bible of auditing and he was like an</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="4.89">expert in it so he put his resume out to</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="3.81">work for the FBI for an unrelated</text>
  <text start="440.4" dur="3.27">position because he was in a transition</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="4.05">period they found him and said hey we</text>
  <text start="443.67" dur="4.23">really like you to do this so after the</text>
  <text start="446.07" dur="4.02">whole rigmarole of getting in there six</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="3.9">months of you know questioning his</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="3.84">family members and people he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="4.71">spoken to in years and going through all</text>
  <text start="453.93" dur="5.15">that they bring him in and he starts and</text>
  <text start="456.51" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s in charge of finding you know I</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="5.91">guess auditing their electronic</text>
  <text start="461.49" dur="6">surveillance procedures as well as their</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="3.76">records procedures how they keep records</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="5.1">and evidence and all kinds of things</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="5.73">like that and he finds malfeasance there</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="4.98">he finds a lot of malfeasance there and</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="4.86">he gets a glowing recommendation from</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="4.29">his superior who is a very strange</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="4.47">character as per him and then not even</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="4.2">six months later a few days before he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.81" dur="3.78">about to start his official probationary</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="4.98">period is over he&amp;#39;s about to start his</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="7.44">official his official role he gets fired</text>
  <text start="491.04" dur="5.67">and they allege all kinds of abuses of</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="3.6">his employees and all kinds of other</text>
  <text start="496.71" dur="4.26">stuff and so this guy Kelly that he</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="4.05">referred me to was there and observed</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="4.89">all this and was actually the one who</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="4.65">brought a lot of it to his attention he</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="2.82">had seen what they had done to</text>
  <text start="507.33" dur="3.42">whistleblowers in the past and didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="508.68" dur="4.96">want any part of it because I read his</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="6.339">affidavit that he swore to in in the key</text>
  <text start="513.64" dur="5.399">and um now he&amp;#39;s willing to talk with me</text>
  <text start="517.089" dur="4.68">as well so let&amp;#39;s keep on peeling the</text>
  <text start="519.039" dur="5.161">layers of this onion huh absolutely and</text>
  <text start="521.769" dur="4.801">you want to know something else I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="524.2" dur="4.47">a couple people I&amp;#39;ve had friends of mine</text>
  <text start="526.57" dur="5.759">who have been in the you know working</text>
  <text start="528.67" dur="5.909">the do the DoD for a very long time as</text>
  <text start="532.329" dur="3.811">soon as they came out of serving over</text>
  <text start="534.579" dur="4.531">the multiple tours in Iraq and</text>
  <text start="536.14" dur="6.78">Afghanistan and then went right into the</text>
  <text start="539.11" dur="6.71">Pentagon and even they were they when</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="6.21">they I know that there is there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="5.019">differences in cases where people have</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="4.44">mixed opinions about Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="550.839" dur="5.851">whereas they are a lot more they are a</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="5.579">lot more on people like Assange aside</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="4.05">everybody just you know they pick and</text>
  <text start="559.149" dur="5.25">choose their battles to fight but as far</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="5.219">as whistleblowers my I&amp;#39;ve had a couple</text>
  <text start="564.399" dur="4.56">of friends tell me that you know the</text>
  <text start="565.959" dur="4.831">reason why unequivocally they say people</text>
  <text start="568.959" dur="3.481">like Snowden should be executed and</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="4.89">stuff like that is because there are</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="6.69">there are channels for whistleblowers to</text>
  <text start="575.68" dur="6.33">go in and voice their concerns and shed</text>
  <text start="579.13" dur="5.64">light on on misdeeds within certain</text>

  <text start="859.05" dur="3.72">quickly</text>

  <text start="930.69" dur="4.5">December of 2015 what what comes out in</text>
  <text start="933.48" dur="4.08">the case and the transcripts and such is</text>
  <text start="935.19" dur="4.92">that Larry Clayman went to one of the</text>

  <text start="967.32" dur="4.17">crickets nothing happens with it now he</text>
  <text start="969.9" dur="3.42">alleges that Trump was under</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="4.44">surveillance by the government as early</text>
  <text start="973.32" dur="5.43">as 2012 that&amp;#39;s President Trump under</text>
  <text start="975.93" dur="4.5">surveillance as early as 2012 well for</text>
  <text start="978.75" dur="2.7">what for what just because he was a</text>
  <text start="980.43" dur="2.94">billionaire and I guess they were</text>
  <text start="981.45" dur="6.87">looking at him mmm</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="6.6">okay so outside of all that stuff um he</text>
  <text start="988.32" dur="6.56">alleges as well that they were actually</text>
  <text start="989.97" dur="8.46">spying on judges Supreme Court judges</text>

  <text start="1003.32" dur="5.55">Roberts is such a flake Bing Bing Bing</text>
  <text start="1005.42" dur="5.1">and as far as Trump goes for everybody</text>
  <text start="1008.87" dur="3.99">out there who holds the theory that</text>
  <text start="1010.52" dur="6.75">Trump was recruited by white hat</text>
  <text start="1012.86" dur="7.32">military intelligence perhaps that very</text>
  <text start="1017.27" dur="6.12">very early on surveillance is is a part</text>
  <text start="1020.18" dur="6.659">of that yeah or at least as a</text>
  <text start="1023.39" dur="6.42">countermeasure to be prepared for four</text>
  <text start="1026.839" dur="6.631">years later when they know even he might</text>

  <text start="1050.76" dur="3.75">ever taken seriously or is usually</text>
  <text start="1052.65" dur="3.84">flipped around on the person trying to</text>
  <text start="1054.51" dur="5.4">do right because these incidents are</text>
  <text start="1056.49" dur="6.45">rarely isolated now and you think about</text>
  <text start="1059.91" dur="6.23">how one thing brings down so many huge</text>
  <text start="1062.94" dur="6.27">people and things and programs and</text>
  <text start="1066.14" dur="4.75">interlinked agencies everything is so</text>

  <text start="1084.24" dur="3.56">into that real quick and it&amp;#39;s gonna tie</text>
  <text start="1085.83" dur="6.36">right into what you just said he was</text>
  <text start="1087.8" dur="5.62">basically smeared by the media and there</text>
  <text start="1092.19" dur="3.66">was a lot of reporting on his</text>
  <text start="1093.42" dur="4.92">credibility and the fact that he was a</text>
  <text start="1095.85" dur="3.9">criminal and he was lying and they they</text>
  <text start="1098.34" dur="2.88">basically you know you could take that</text>
  <text start="1099.75" dur="3.42">stuff however you take it I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="1101.22" dur="3.84">direct you what to think okay</text>
  <text start="1103.17" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;ve provided in the thread we&amp;#39;re about</text>
  <text start="1105.06" dur="4.77">to talk about all of the information or</text>
  <text start="1106.74" dur="5.07">several reports of which this happened</text>
  <text start="1109.83" dur="3.51">the problem with it is those articles</text>
  <text start="1111.81" dur="3.75">were written and then they brought him</text>
  <text start="1113.34" dur="3.57">back on for another project after they</text>
  <text start="1115.56" dur="2.64">were already written so the government</text>
  <text start="1116.91" dur="3.57">comes out and says none of this stuff is</text>
  <text start="1118.2" dur="3.66">true this is all bull he&amp;#39;s crazy and</text>
  <text start="1120.48" dur="2.67">then they say oh well you know this</text>
  <text start="1121.86" dur="2.94">crazy guy we need him for another</text>
  <text start="1123.15" dur="4.89">project so we&amp;#39;re gonna sign him again</text>
  <text start="1124.8" dur="5.22">and they bring him back on so maybe</text>
  <text start="1128.04" dur="3.45">maybe he&amp;#39;s maybe you know maybe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1130.02" dur="3.03">nefarious and all that stuff but not</text>
  <text start="1131.49" dur="3.45">nefarious enough for the government to</text>
  <text start="1133.05" dur="3.99">say you know what even after all this we</text>
  <text start="1134.94" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t want to work with you now the</text>
  <text start="1137.04" dur="3.75">interesting thing is that under the</text>
  <text start="1139.08" dur="3.54">Obama administration when Snowden came</text>
  <text start="1140.79" dur="4.02">forward with all his revelations he said</text>

  <text start="1152.82" dur="6.42">and you failed to do so right and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1155.73" dur="5.49">why Snowden was a target criminally then</text>
  <text start="1159.24" dur="4.26">they decide then so so Montgomery</text>
  <text start="1161.22" dur="4.98">decides you know what I&amp;#39;m gonna do it</text>
  <text start="1163.5" dur="4.89">that way and he files whistleblower</text>
  <text start="1166.2" dur="5.04">complaints God knows how many I think it</text>
  <text start="1168.39" dur="4.77">was like 30 or something none of them</text>
  <text start="1171.24" dur="3.57">are answered none of them he goes</text>

  <text start="1271.23" dur="5.67">purpose of it was and things like that</text>
  <text start="1273.36" dur="5.819">so it&amp;#39;s prime in people&amp;#39;s minds okay now</text>
  <text start="1276.9" dur="5.13">what I&amp;#39;m gonna say next is really</text>
  <text start="1279.179" dur="6.931">interesting and it&amp;#39;s a real serious</text>
  <text start="1282.03" dur="7.05">window inside of my head okay and I just</text>
  <text start="1286.11" dur="4.89">have to put it out there because I feel</text>
  <text start="1289.08" dur="4.02">like this is just the I mean this is how</text>
  <text start="1291" dur="4.679">I am this is the way I like to talk to</text>
  <text start="1293.1" dur="6.09">people and I&amp;#39;m not gonna make any qualms</text>
  <text start="1295.679" dur="5.431">about it um I have been communicating</text>
  <text start="1299.19" dur="5.31">via email with Dennis Montgomery for</text>
  <text start="1301.11" dur="8.31">several months when he first emailed me</text>
  <text start="1304.5" dur="6.49">I was shocked I said woah why me and</text>
  <text start="1309.42" dur="4.3">there were some weird thing</text>
  <text start="1310.99" dur="5.189">like there was some miscommunications</text>
  <text start="1313.72" dur="4.41">and I didn&amp;#39;t understand why he was</text>
  <text start="1316.179" dur="4.821">contacting me he didn&amp;#39;t appear to have</text>
  <text start="1318.13" dur="6.33">read my work or write or listen to my</text>
  <text start="1321" dur="5.29">many videos on his story and then I</text>
  <text start="1324.46" dur="5.16">realized that I was wrong about that and</text>
  <text start="1326.29" dur="6.389">the reason why is because he has had</text>
  <text start="1329.62" dur="7.28">four strokes and so his communication is</text>
  <text start="1332.679" dur="6.031">very very it&amp;#39;s very sharp but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="1336.9" dur="5.05">understanding that this is a man who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1338.71" dur="4.77">had four strokes okay so he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1341.95" dur="3.99">sending me I told him right off the bat</text>
  <text start="1343.48" dur="4.35">I am an open-source journalist I usually</text>
  <text start="1345.94" dur="4.17">when I get this stuff take it and say</text>
  <text start="1347.83" dur="5.01">here reporter that I trust here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1350.11" dur="4.29">story for you take this story you go</text>
  <text start="1352.84" dur="5.19">ahead and run with it it&amp;#39;s all yours</text>

  <text start="1358.03" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t um but in this case I told him</text>
  <text start="1360.91" dur="4.05">that I made the introduction but Dennis</text>
  <text start="1363.7" dur="3.42">didn&amp;#39;t stop emailing me</text>
  <text start="1364.96" dur="5.64">he kept emailing me and I told him from</text>
  <text start="1367.12" dur="6.45">the get-go I do not want a single piece</text>
  <text start="1370.6" dur="5.52">of classified information formerly</text>

  <text start="1391.84" dur="4.35">tell you now when he sent it to me</text>
  <text start="1394.059" dur="4.921">yesterday just something inside of me</text>

  <text start="1404.74" dur="5.069">I&amp;#39;ve decided to do Dennis sent me an</text>
  <text start="1407.17" dur="4.65">email and I asked him if I&amp;#39;d be able to</text>
  <text start="1409.809" dur="6.361">share it I blacked out our contact</text>
  <text start="1411.82" dur="6.63">information he said this we breached the</text>

  <text start="1457.7" dur="4.01">of information by the New York Times</text>
  <text start="1459.41" dur="6.72">doesn&amp;#39;t help our nation and he shares a</text>

  <text start="1466.13" dur="4.35">says why do you think President Obama</text>
  <text start="1468.5" dur="3.84">went after the press the Obama</text>

  <text start="1474.23" dur="6.06">who they were speaking to my god my god</text>
  <text start="1477.38" dur="6.9">and it I mean we knew we know the</text>
  <text start="1480.29" dur="7.23">ideological lien of most the mainstream</text>
  <text start="1484.28" dur="6.78">media but then if you add compulsion on</text>
  <text start="1487.52" dur="7.47">top of it to this to this point there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1491.06" dur="7.02">there&amp;#39;s no chance of anything anything</text>
  <text start="1494.99" dur="5.58">unflattering ever being published again</text>
  <text start="1498.08" dur="3.96">goodness only knows you know what</text>
  <text start="1500.57" dur="4.64">information they got but I find it very</text>
  <text start="1502.04" dur="7.14">funny because the the left-wing press</text>
  <text start="1505.21" dur="5.8">which is most of it likes to combat</text>
  <text start="1509.18" dur="3.93">Donald Trump when he says that the fake</text>

  <text start="1543.7" dur="4.21">nonsense</text>
  <text start="1544.91" dur="5.07">and I shared this entire thing I shared</text>
  <text start="1547.91" dur="4.38">the email I said I made it very clear</text>
  <text start="1549.98" dur="5.4">very clear I don&amp;#39;t want to do it again I</text>
  <text start="1552.29" dur="5.82">have nothing to back this up I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1555.38" dur="4.5">have any documents or proofs I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1558.11" dur="5.61">have anything but Dennis Montgomery&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1559.88" dur="6.03">word and I positioned it as such this is</text>
  <text start="1563.72" dur="5.55">what Dennis Montgomery says that he did</text>
  <text start="1565.91" dur="4.52">and that&amp;#39;s all there is to it so you</text>
  <text start="1569.27" dur="5.61">haven&amp;#39;t been who&amp;#39;s been given immunity</text>
  <text start="1570.43" dur="6.98">he was given immunity see that&amp;#39;s yeah</text>
  <text start="1574.88" dur="5.5">it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="1577.41" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s quite telling because like I said</text>
  <text start="1580.38" dur="4.47">before we know the we know the</text>
  <text start="1581.97" dur="5.49">ideological lien of most of the media</text>
  <text start="1584.85" dur="6.53">but then to also learn that they are</text>
  <text start="1587.46" dur="7.829">also there is an element of them that is</text>
  <text start="1591.38" dur="8.169">pretty much like an abused lover who is</text>
  <text start="1595.289" dur="6.661">being held against their will as well oh</text>
  <text start="1599.549" dur="4.171">yeah it&amp;#39;s like they love the bondage as</text>
  <text start="1601.95" dur="4.83">well I mean they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very loyal</text>
  <text start="1603.72" dur="6.63">and they they they walk in lockstep with</text>
  <text start="1606.78" dur="6.269">most of the the establishment the</text>
  <text start="1610.35" dur="5.97">establishment party but other than that</text>
  <text start="1613.049" dur="6.87">they are yeah Stockholm Syndrome they</text>
  <text start="1616.32" dur="5.79">are abused and they still love it and</text>
  <text start="1619.919" dur="4.801">they say how dare you say that we are</text>
  <text start="1622.11" dur="4.29">the enemy of the people I mean weird</text>
  <text start="1624.72" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re just mere prisoners we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1626.4" dur="5.73">what we have to do to survive we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1627.72" dur="9.78">an enemy it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s this story listen and</text>
  <text start="1632.13" dur="8.909">you know let me let me say um I I waited</text>
  <text start="1637.5" dur="5.52">so long to talk about him because there</text>
  <text start="1641.039" dur="3.75">has been a lot of reporting not</text>
  <text start="1643.02" dur="5.88">reporting but like I&amp;#39;ve had I&amp;#39;ve asked</text>
  <text start="1644.789" dur="7.101">around and you know a lot like he was</text>
  <text start="1648.9" dur="5.97">cut off as working as a source for</text>
  <text start="1651.89" dur="4.779">Arpaio because of whatever there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="1654.87" dur="3.03">there are some recordings available and</text>
  <text start="1656.669" dur="4.801">it seems like he didn&amp;#39;t do the right</text>
  <text start="1657.9" dur="8.399">thing um you know there I just was very</text>
  <text start="1661.47" dur="6.81">kind of leery because I don&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1666.299" dur="3.421">you know obviously Sarah Carter and John</text>
  <text start="1668.28" dur="3.389">Solomon stop talking about it for a</text>
  <text start="1669.72" dur="4.86">reason there&amp;#39;s a reason why no other</text>
  <text start="1671.669" dur="5.25">media outlets that we come to talk about</text>
  <text start="1674.58" dur="4.979">are taking his information he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1676.919" dur="4.441">obviously come to me because no one else</text>
  <text start="1679.559" dur="4.11">will listen and so when that happens</text>
  <text start="1681.36" dur="5.01">over and over again you just have to</text>
  <text start="1683.669" dur="4.201">think to yourself why you know why is he</text>
  <text start="1686.37" dur="3.929">on the outs with all these people why is</text>
  <text start="1687.87" dur="5.25">nobody else talking about what what this</text>
  <text start="1690.299" dur="5.13">and what does that mean in terms of his</text>
  <text start="1693.12" dur="4.679">character or his integrity etc so on and</text>
  <text start="1695.429" dur="5.221">so forth and I just wanted to be upfront</text>
  <text start="1697.799" dur="4.441">about that because I&amp;#39;ve been feeling it</text>
  <text start="1700.65" dur="4.08">out and feeling it out and feeling it</text>
  <text start="1702.24" dur="5.52">out and he said yesterday like I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1704.73" dur="5.46">gonna keep sending you my story until</text>
  <text start="1707.76" dur="3.389">you have no choice but to realise how</text>
  <text start="1710.19" dur="5.429">important it is and</text>
  <text start="1711.149" dur="6.03">and talked about it and I I just want to</text>
  <text start="1715.619" dur="3.331">make the disclaimer out there that you</text>
  <text start="1717.179" dur="4.17">know there&amp;#39;s been nobody that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1718.95" dur="6.659">able to come forward and dispute</text>
  <text start="1721.349" dur="6.361">anything that he has said he was given</text>
  <text start="1725.609" dur="5.01">immunity for a reason like you said</text>
  <text start="1727.71" dur="5.49">nobody has ever disputed what he did and</text>
  <text start="1730.619" dur="4.14">what he says he did ever and he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="1733.2" dur="4.529">all the evidence apparently to back it</text>
  <text start="1734.759" dur="5.04">up I&amp;#39;ve not seen any of it nor do I want</text>
  <text start="1737.729" dur="4.44">to to be quite honest with you unless</text>
  <text start="1739.799" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s open source and available it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1742.169" dur="3.24">my thing</text>
  <text start="1743.009" dur="5.22">I would really have to think about it</text>
  <text start="1745.409" dur="4.35">otherwise you know it not only and this</text>
  <text start="1748.229" dur="4.38">is gonna be one of those conspiratorial</text>
  <text start="1749.759" dur="5.51">oh my god it&amp;#39;s not the safest thing in</text>
  <text start="1752.609" dur="5.91">the world to be dabbling around here no</text>
  <text start="1755.269" dur="5.2">I&amp;#39;m just plain and simple it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1758.519" dur="5.191">not putting that story out yesterday</text>
  <text start="1760.469" dur="8.7">probably wasn&amp;#39;t the most safe thing to</text>
  <text start="1763.71" dur="8.549">do but I think it&amp;#39;s super important and</text>

  <text start="2085.45" dur="7.02">old thoughts and it&amp;#39;s just the that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2088.75" dur="6.69">why this is such an important time to be</text>

  <text start="2140.64" dur="4.5">the Liberty movement um under Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="2142.98" dur="3.48">and I had amassed a huge following I was</text>
  <text start="2145.14" dur="3.12">speaking at events and all kinds of</text>
  <text start="2146.46" dur="3.57">stuff and then in the beginning I was</text>
  <text start="2148.26" dur="3.18">like not feeling Donald Trump at all I</text>
  <text start="2150.03" dur="3.089">was like this is ridiculous and then I</text>
  <text start="2151.44" dur="4.23">realized what he was saying and I jumped</text>
  <text start="2153.119" dur="4.561">on board and I was excommunicated from</text>
  <text start="2155.67" dur="4.29">that community in large part because all</text>
  <text start="2157.68" dur="3.84">of them thought you know government is</text>
  <text start="2159.96" dur="4.64">horrible government will never work</text>
  <text start="2161.52" dur="5.61">again how dare you support this</text>
  <text start="2164.6" dur="4.93">Republican Party after what we had just</text>

  <text start="2169.53" dur="3.63">traumatic okay to say the least and this</text>
  <text start="2171.66" dur="5.49">has been used to smear me in the past</text>
  <text start="2173.16" dur="7.02">just saying and so I started over again</text>
  <text start="2177.15" dur="6.06">and I didn&amp;#39;t have anybody looking at</text>
  <text start="2180.18" dur="4.77">what I was doing like at all I started</text>
  <text start="2183.21" dur="3.72">going over the WikiLeaks emails because</text>
  <text start="2184.95" dur="3.6">nobody could understand why they were</text>
  <text start="2186.93" dur="3.27">important and I thought that I had</text>
  <text start="2188.55" dur="3.21">something to add to that because I knew</text>
  <text start="2190.2" dur="2.82">the history and I had a lot of base</text>
  <text start="2191.76" dur="4.65">knowledge about this because I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2193.02" dur="4.589">doing it for so long so once I started</text>
  <text start="2196.41" dur="2.61">doing that people started paying</text>
  <text start="2197.609" dur="3.601">attention and I realize like this is</text>
  <text start="2199.02" dur="4.5">where I&amp;#39;m supposed to be this is where I</text>

  <text start="2874.4" dur="5.46">departments we haven&amp;#39;t talked about the</text>
  <text start="2876.29" dur="6.03">Treasury where the the the article is</text>
  <text start="2879.86" dur="4.74">written in a propaganda type way but</text>
  <text start="2882.32" dur="3.84">their spin on it is that the Russians</text>
  <text start="2884.6" dur="3.3">were communicating with Treasury</text>
  <text start="2886.16" dur="3.69">officials and asking them for</text>
  <text start="2887.9" dur="4.25">information through Google account</text>
  <text start="2889.85" dur="4.77">emails rather than the official</text>
  <text start="2892.15" dur="7.33">communicative ways that you do things</text>
  <text start="2894.62" dur="7.08">right now I take that to mean the</text>
  <text start="2899.48" dur="3.48">opposite of what they say it is because</text>
  <text start="2901.7" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve learned to do with the</text>
  <text start="2902.96" dur="3.48">mainstream media and so I look into her</text>
  <text start="2905.06" dur="2.43">pacer account and I was doing this just</text>
  <text start="2906.44" dur="2.13">as we were starting</text>
  <text start="2907.49" dur="3.54">show and I&amp;#39;ll have probably have a</text>
  <text start="2908.57" dur="5.7">report on it today this case has been</text>
  <text start="2911.03" dur="6.45">delayed over and over and over and over</text>
  <text start="2914.27" dur="5.849">again and at one point there&amp;#39;s a motion</text>
  <text start="2917.48" dur="4.77">filed in the first case against her</text>
  <text start="2920.119" dur="6.231">where they say that we may be moving</text>
  <text start="2922.25" dur="7.2">towards we may be moving towards</text>
  <text start="2926.35" dur="6.54">potential disposition of the case and</text>
  <text start="2929.45" dur="8.97">what that basically means is that either</text>
  <text start="2932.89" dur="7.45">either they are going to dismiss the</text>
  <text start="2938.42" dur="4.59">trial dismiss the charges against you</text>
  <text start="2940.34" dur="6.39">not file the charges against you</text>
  <text start="2943.01" dur="7.44">vacate them I don&amp;#39;t believe that it</text>
  <text start="2946.73" dur="6.12">means there could be a plea deal but the</text>
  <text start="2950.45" dur="5.33">interesting thing here is that they</text>
  <text start="2952.85" dur="5.67">never got a grand jury indictment on her</text>
  <text start="2955.78" dur="6.4">they pulled the charges on her they</text>
  <text start="2958.52" dur="5.43">filed them as information she then that</text>
  <text start="2962.18" dur="3.6">case was closed this first one I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2963.95" dur="5.34">telling you about and I started looking</text>
  <text start="2965.78" dur="7.26">into the second one which was opened in</text>
  <text start="2969.29" dur="6.6">January this year I believe and in that</text>
  <text start="2973.04" dur="5.16">case she there&amp;#39;s a transcript available</text>
  <text start="2975.89" dur="6.33">where she waves her right to an</text>
  <text start="2978.2" dur="6.659">indictment by jury to move faster to the</text>
  <text start="2982.22" dur="6.12">discovery period because it&amp;#39;s apparently</text>
  <text start="2984.859" dur="6.211">been postponed so many times that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2988.34" dur="4.56">getting frustrated and wants to move to</text>
  <text start="2991.07" dur="4.62">discovery she&amp;#39;s pleading not guilty so</text>
  <text start="2992.9" dur="4.469">she goes through the the the motions of</text>
  <text start="2995.69" dur="3.06">saying I don&amp;#39;t care about a jury a grand</text>
  <text start="2997.369" dur="3.361">jury indictment I just want to be</text>
  <text start="2998.75" dur="4.38">indicted by that what their charges were</text>
  <text start="3000.73" dur="7.04">when they filed the complaint against me</text>
  <text start="3003.13" dur="9.84">right finally now it&amp;#39;s going to trial</text>
  <text start="3007.77" dur="7">January 21st 2020 a year from now okay</text>
