  <text start="2175.32" dur="4.019">and I love him on a history level and</text>
  <text start="2177.72" dur="5.55">all that other stuff too but when I</text>
  <text start="2179.339" dur="5.821">heard about about the the the</text>
  <text start="2183.27" dur="3.599">acquisition I thought that okay we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2185.16" dur="3.9">listen maybe it&amp;#39;s just a good business</text>
  <text start="2186.869" dur="6.031">move because I know conservative review</text>
  <text start="2189.06" dur="5.85">CR was doing well they got CR T V and I</text>
  <text start="2192.9" dur="4.62">know that the blaze is you know pretty</text>
  <text start="2194.91" dur="4.11">much bottoming out when I heard that</text>
  <text start="2197.52" dur="4.349">they actually took on the blazes</text>
  <text start="2199.02" dur="5.55">branding they took I mean they took it</text>
  <text start="2201.869" dur="5.49">on and they didn&amp;#39;t just acquire their</text>
  <text start="2204.57" dur="5.19">there I don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re publishing or</text>
  <text start="2207.359" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re writing staff or whatever the</text>
  <text start="2209.76" dur="3.089">hell else but they actually took on the</text>
  <text start="2211.349" dur="5.01">marketing and the branding of the</text>
  <text start="2212.849" dur="6.961">blazing like why they just the the</text>
  <text start="2216.359" dur="5.791">public the public perception of CR TV is</text>
  <text start="2219.81" dur="5.1">so much more healthier than the blaze is</text>
  <text start="2222.15" dur="4.199">I know I don&amp;#39;t know marketing alone why</text>
  <text start="2224.91" dur="3.03">did you do that to yourself I know</text>
  <text start="2226.349" dur="4.651">you&amp;#39;re friends with back but you can you</text>
  <text start="2227.94" dur="5.159">can you be honest about what what the</text>
  <text start="2231" dur="3.78">what the weight of that is in the open</text>
  <text start="2233.099" dur="5.24">market right now you know this thing</text>
  <text start="2234.78" dur="7.799">that sucks too is that I really like a</text>
  <text start="2238.339" dur="6.701">lot of the stuff on the blaze I I do so</text>
  <text start="2242.579" dur="5.881">it&amp;#39;s weird because I don&amp;#39;t like Glenn</text>
  <text start="2245.04" dur="6.12">Beck but well and I would understand if</text>
  <text start="2248.46" dur="7.44">CR if conservative review was still</text>
  <text start="2251.16" dur="6.27">mainly a spot like the the the the</text>
  <text start="2255.9" dur="2.31">almost like it blaze would be a</text>
  <text start="2257.43" dur="2.79">subsidiary</text>
  <text start="2258.21" dur="4.71">yeah like blaze would actually</text>
  <text start="2260.22" dur="5.099">supplement the broadcast end house but</text>
  <text start="2262.92" dur="5.189">see our TV had already been had already</text>
  <text start="2265.319" dur="4.651">been established so it&amp;#39;s not like you</text>
  <text start="2268.109" dur="4.441">know a conservative review had all of</text>
  <text start="2269.97" dur="4.71">the the publishing down but they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2272.55" dur="4.38">have any kind of video content and in</text>
  <text start="2274.68" dur="4.98">comes the blaze and they complete a</text>
  <text start="2276.93" dur="5.34">puzzle for each other but it was like</text>
  <text start="2279.66" dur="5.01">you had the redundancy of the the</text>
  <text start="2282.27" dur="4.47">broadcastin because CR TV had the I</text>
  <text start="2284.67" dur="3.9">think it still does have Dan Vaughn Gino</text>
  <text start="2286.74" dur="3.87">and steven crowder and all them</text>
  <text start="2288.57" dur="3.93">I think what&amp;#39;s his name another one I</text>
  <text start="2290.61" dur="4.02">really love I think Andrew will cow I</text>
  <text start="2292.5" dur="4.77">love him</text>
  <text start="2294.63" dur="5.04">I just don&amp;#39;t understand the redundancy</text>
  <text start="2297.27" dur="5.91">and why they would actually even fiddle</text>
  <text start="2299.67" dur="5.85">with that that that brand especially</text>
  <text start="2303.18" dur="5.16">with how all over the place that has</text>
  <text start="2305.52" dur="6.24">been I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
