  <text start="521.27" dur="5.009">over what they do but at the bottom this</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="4.35">was the interesting part for me while</text>
  <text start="526.279" dur="4.291">its coverage is global fusion GPS offers</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="4.5">singular expertise in Latin America and</text>

  <text start="548.99" dur="5.67">and you can reach Peter fridge here it</text>
  <text start="551.99" dur="5.13">is old GPS freezing GPS email address</text>
  <text start="554.66" dur="4.29">why do I think that&amp;#39;s interesting well</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="3.51">if you remember when we went through the</text>
  <text start="558.95" dur="3.81">Glenn Simpson testimony and this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="560.63" dur="4.29">something big but when we went through</text>
  <text start="562.76" dur="4.17">the Glen Simpson testimony he said that</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="3.27">they investigated because Trump had a</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="2.64">lot of business dealings in the</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="4.05">Caribbean and they investigated down</text>
  <text start="569.57" dur="4.71">there nothing flagged them if their</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="3.72">expertise is down there and there was</text>
  <text start="574.28" dur="3.24">some kind of corruption going on don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.96" dur="4.73">you think their experts would have been</text>

  <text start="580.69" dur="7.2">you know transaction investigations etc</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="3.74">just thought that was interesting</text>
  <text start="588.56" dur="8.16">Glenn Simpson used to write for the Wall</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="7.74">Street Journal until 2009 and then he</text>
