  <text start="193.22" dur="6.12">to ask Robert Steele a question what</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="4.17">inspired you to begin the hashtag undred</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="4.05">campaign and can you tell us a little</text>
  <text start="200.84" dur="4.44">bit more about that well thank you</text>
  <text start="203.39" dur="4.47">Jordan let me say that what inspired</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="4.65">hashtag on rig was Donald Trump telling</text>
  <text start="207.86" dur="3.51">the public that the system is rigged I</text>
  <text start="209.93" dur="4.26">had been doing</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="6.839">Alecto reform stuff i briefed occupy in</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="6">October of 2011 on election reform that</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="4.921">video courtesy of Phillips mall went</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="4.71">viral it got to the front page of Reddit</text>
  <text start="223.13" dur="6.18">and my kids had to tell me about reddit</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="5.94">um then I got hooked on election reform</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="3.21">because one of the words that Cynthia</text>
  <text start="230.84" dur="4.95">and I really really</text>
  <text start="232.52" dur="5.16">like to use is the word integrity and I</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="4.5">realize that our election system does</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="4.56">not have integrity but I hadn&amp;#39;t realized</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="4.68">how many different ways it&amp;#39;s compromised</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="6.69">I ended up doing a lot of research after</text>
  <text start="244.97" dur="5.64">occupy and I went across all of the</text>
  <text start="248.93" dur="4.85">election reform groups including</text>
  <text start="250.61" dur="6.24">Christina Tobin Lawrence Lessig the</text>
  <text start="253.78" dur="4.81">various associations voto Latino and so</text>
  <text start="256.85" dur="5.34">forth and I ended up coming up with</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="6.45">twelve distinct areas where integrity</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="5.64">has been lost an election reform and at</text>
  <text start="265.04" dur="4.98">that point I just had this this graphic</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="4.02">and I tried to get some congressmen</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="3.93">interested starting with Ron Paul and</text>
  <text start="271.85" dur="4.14">Dennis Kucinich retired congressman and</text>
  <text start="273.95" dur="3.75">they got it but they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="3.75">touch it because the two-party tyranny</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="5.6">is everyone&amp;#39;s bread and butter right now</text>
  <text start="279.74" dur="5.85">including for retired congressmen oh I</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="4.54">tried to get Jesse Ventura and Ralph</text>
  <text start="285.59" dur="6.18">Nader interested that didn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="5.79">then Donald Trump came along now I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="3.72">really an alt right guy but for the sake</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="4.14">of hash tag on rig this is an alt right</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="5.34">white guy who absolutely loves his</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="6.54">partner the alt black alt left black</text>
  <text start="300.83" dur="4.95">woman Cynthia McKinney and suddenly when</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="3.6">Trump said the system is really</text>
  <text start="305.78" dur="6.27">crystallized for me so I created hash</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="5.97">tag on rig I created a manifesto and I</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="3.84">was going to publish it and I asked dr.</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="4.35">McKinney whom I had met in Denver in</text>
  <text start="315.89" dur="5.13">2009 if she would do me the honor of</text>
  <text start="318.23" dur="4.74">writing the foreword at that time I was</text>
  <text start="321.02" dur="5.16">just putting information out I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="322.97" dur="5.79">thinking about raising money buying an</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="5.4">RV and traveling the country and that</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="5.82">kind of stuff so I did that and I got so</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="4.98">much positive feedback including the</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="4.53">suggestion that I start an IndieGoGo</text>
  <text start="336.56" dur="5.609">campaign and by the way the RV has</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="5.76">IndieGoGo generosity on the rack kind of</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="4.951">like NASCAR because that RV would not</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="4.799">have been possible without IndieGoGo and</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="5.25">generosity and some individual donors so</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="4.771">I finally was able to develop this</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="7.83">invite dr. McKinney to be the project</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="7.95">manager she&amp;#39;s vested in this and and so</text>
  <text start="360.2" dur="4.59">then we went on our tour but bottom line</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="4.01">here is a lecture reform has 12 distinct</text>
  <text start="364.79" dur="4.32">access</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="4.6">areas that have to be developed and I</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="4.529">have put this forward as a proposed</text>
  <text start="371" dur="4.59">starter for conversation this is not a</text>
  <text start="373.639" dur="4.53">take-it-or-leave-it prescription this is</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="4.47">a conversation and Cynthia is the people</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="3.691">person I&amp;#39;m the information and</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="4.35">technologies guide so we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="381.86" dur="5.37">process right now a pivoted so that</text>
  <text start="384.41" dur="4.95">Cynthia will lead the people part and I</text>
  <text start="387.23" dur="4.17">will work with John McAfee who&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="389.36" dur="4.44">kindly agreed to be a part of this in</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="3.78">developing a cyber try fact that we can</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="5.54">talk more about that later</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="9.08">so hashtag gun Rick was it exists it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="4.92">real and it&amp;#39;s not going to go away</text>
  <text start="405.01" dur="4.78">Cynthia what inspired you to join Robert</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="2.9">in advancing the national conversation</text>
  <text start="409.79" dur="5.73">on election reform</text>
  <text start="411.01" dur="8.14">well of course my vision of hashtag gun</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.91">rig was far greater than just election</text>
  <text start="419.15" dur="6.21">reform because having been inside the</text>
  <text start="421.43" dur="7.17">system I understood when candidate Trump</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="5.25">said the system is rigged I understood</text>
  <text start="428.6" dur="4.319">that every aspect of the political</text>
  <text start="430.61" dur="4.41">system is rigged not just the</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="4.351">administration of Elections which of</text>
  <text start="435.02" dur="4.68">course I&amp;#39;ve been through what eight</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="4.769">times now actually not that&amp;#39;s only on</text>
  <text start="439.7" dur="5.55">the congressional level and two</text>
  <text start="442.039" dur="7.321">additional times four on the state level</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="7.32">so I understood ways in which the system</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="5.16">is rigged and oh by the way the</text>
  <text start="452.57" dur="4.58">electronic voting machines in the</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="7.769">country of Kenya were literally hacked</text>
  <text start="457.15" dur="9.85">with the presidential election outcome</text>
  <text start="462.289" dur="8.391">being affected by the hack and therefore</text>
  <text start="467" dur="8.16">now Kenya is going to run their</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="7.12">presidential election over again we have</text>
  <text start="475.16" dur="5.25">discovered so many ways so many</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="5.88">deficiencies in the election system</text>
  <text start="480.41" dur="7.89">itself alone let alone everything else</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="7.799">that it was easy for me to say yes the</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="5.97">system is rigged and Robert was saying</text>
  <text start="491.479" dur="6.421">well let Sun ring it and that was the</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="4.979">birth of hashtag gun rig because I&amp;#39;m all</text>
  <text start="497.9" dur="4.919">about unwitting some</text>
  <text start="499.249" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s wrong absolutely it&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="502.819" dur="7.14">all and that&amp;#39;s fantastic so now that you</text>
  <text start="505.969" dur="6.331">guys are done with the tour the hashtag</text>
  <text start="509.959" dur="5.161">unread tour what obstacles did you both</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="5.039">find doing this tour and I&amp;#39;ll open it up</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="3.209">for you Robert so you can discuss and</text>
  <text start="517.339" dur="3.36">then we can move to Cynthia you know</text>
  <text start="518.329" dur="4.08">what what obstacles did you guys in do</text>
  <text start="520.699" dur="3.591">it well thank you for asking that</text>
  <text start="522.409" dur="4.821">question and the tour has not stopped</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="6.19">what we&amp;#39;re doing now is retrenching um</text>
  <text start="527.23" dur="6.13">as far as obstacles go we were</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="4.5">grievously hurt by the Meetup CEO</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="3.659">canceling our four hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="534.98" dur="4.32">five paid meetups we have one for each</text>
  <text start="537.019" dur="4.11">congressional district the emails were</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="3.06">starting to pile up we had a Facebook</text>
  <text start="541.129" dur="3.39">strategy where we were going to</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="4.44">broadcast on Wednesdays Robert and on</text>
  <text start="544.519" dur="4.05">Saturday Cynthia and we were easily</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="4.289">headed toward being able to reach ten</text>
  <text start="548.569" dur="4.19">million people with meetup notices when</text>
  <text start="551.089" dur="3.391">they all looked for a meetup to go to</text>
  <text start="552.759" dur="4.991">across this country</text>
  <text start="554.48" dur="5.64">um the meetup CEO violated his own</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="4.199">processes he is discriminating against</text>
  <text start="560.12" dur="3.81">me and Cynthia McKinney and hashtag um</text>
  <text start="561.949" dur="5.36">Rick at the same time that he is</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="5.55">providing illegal undeclared in-kind</text>
  <text start="567.309" dur="5.28">support to the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="5.219">Committee because he waived the fees</text>
  <text start="572.589" dur="5.37">evaluation of no less than one hundred</text>
  <text start="574.699" dur="7.711">and ninety five thousand dollars for</text>
  <text start="577.959" dur="6.581">1087 hashtag resist meetups that are</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="4.32">co-sponsored by the anti-defamation</text>
  <text start="584.54" dur="4.2">league which is the Zionist way of</text>
  <text start="586.73" dur="5.01">suppressing free speech in the United</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="5.13">States so the meetup CEO killed our</text>
  <text start="591.74" dur="4.349">ability to create cells across the</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="5.43">country that we could then tour to visit</text>
  <text start="596.089" dur="5.69">the second obstacle was a slander and</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="5.969">libel and tortious interference campaign</text>
  <text start="601.779" dur="5.381">mounted by one Jason Goodman and I will</text>
  <text start="605.269" dur="3.961">say nothing more about this other than</text>
  <text start="607.16" dur="4.679">to point people to my federal lawsuit</text>
  <text start="609.23" dur="5.459">which has easily found at Phi Beta Yoda</text>
  <text start="611.839" dur="5.22">it specifies all of the things that were</text>
  <text start="614.689" dur="5.101">done to destroy our entire fundraising</text>
  <text start="617.059" dur="5.76">campaign both an indiegogo generosity</text>
  <text start="619.79" dur="5.279">and via PayPal those two obstacles</text>
  <text start="622.819" dur="6.33">really set us back by about three months</text>
  <text start="625.069" dur="6.091">however we had two individual donors one</text>
  <text start="629.149" dur="3.331">donating forty thousand and one donating</text>
  <text start="631.16" dur="5.489">twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="632.48" dur="8.25">were able to fund the RV so despite</text>
  <text start="636.649" dur="6.331">these two enormous obstacles we did get</text>
  <text start="640.73" dur="4.979">an RV it&amp;#39;s completely paid for it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="642.98" dur="4.89">a beautiful $8,500 wrap around it and</text>
  <text start="645.709" dur="6.151">Cynthia and I have just spent 10</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="7.92">intensive days in this RV and I have to</text>
  <text start="651.86" dur="6.089">say it was worth the wait because the 10</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="5.25">days we&amp;#39;ve spent together have have</text>
  <text start="657.949" dur="5.101">allowed us to come together in a Vulcan</text>

  <text start="1682.91" dur="4.62">Cynthia and I have it in mind to spend</text>
  <text start="1684.47" dur="4.59">six months on the road in an RV that can</text>
  <text start="1687.53" dur="3.78">accommodate six months on the road</text>
  <text start="1689.06" dur="4.71">without us strangling each other which I</text>
  <text start="1691.31" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t think ever ever came to my mind</text>
  <text start="1693.77" dur="3.75">Cynthia let me say something about</text>
  <text start="1695.63" dur="5.79">Cynthia that&amp;#39;s I think really shows her</text>
  <text start="1697.52" dur="7.71">character an RV is like a sailboat</text>
  <text start="1701.42" dur="7.23">and the toilets in our visas are not</text>
  <text start="1705.23" dur="6.24">able to handle toilet paper okay so I</text>
  <text start="1708.65" dur="5.43">want you to know that Cynthia and I both</text>
  <text start="1711.47" dur="4.86">packed our toilet paper and put it in</text>

  <text start="1718.58" dur="4.86">willing and able to do something as</text>
  <text start="1721.01" dur="4.62">humble as keep her used toilet paper out</text>
  <text start="1723.44" dur="6.69">of the RV system and that just increased</text>
  <text start="1725.63" dur="6.42">my respect for her character I cannot</text>
  <text start="1730.13" dur="4.02">explain any other way this is a woman</text>
  <text start="1732.05" dur="5.04">who is not afraid of getting her hands</text>
  <text start="1734.15" dur="6.48">dirty or doing the small stuff to honor</text>
  <text start="1737.09" dur="4.53">the integrity of the system RV toilets</text>
  <text start="1740.63" dur="3.51">have no integrity</text>
  <text start="1741.62" dur="4.35">they can&amp;#39;t handle toilet paper so god</text>
  <text start="1744.14" dur="5.79">bless you sentiment kitty for being a</text>
  <text start="1745.97" dur="7.47">genuine authentic human being that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1749.93" dur="5.76">more information that you wanted more</text>
  <text start="1753.44" dur="5.28">information enjoyed needed but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1755.69" dur="5.58">alright you guys it&amp;#39;s the character it</text>
  <text start="1758.72" dur="3.99">shows character by dr. McKinney in a way</text>
  <text start="1761.27" dur="4.08">that I just can&amp;#39;t explain otherwise</text>
  <text start="1762.71" dur="8.37">these guys are open source everything</text>
  <text start="1765.35" dur="9.3">then would you preach right there that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1771.08" dur="6.62">right and it&amp;#39;s very important that we we</text>
  <text start="1774.65" dur="7.56">understand that we are role models and</text>
  <text start="1777.7" dur="7.75">if Robert and I can sit down together</text>
  <text start="1782.21" dur="7.23">and come up with a plan then I am</text>
  <text start="1785.45" dur="7.77">absolutely convinced that the people of</text>
  <text start="1789.44" dur="6.21">the u.s. around the US will be able to</text>
  <text start="1793.22" dur="4.2">do the same so what we&amp;#39;re model we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1795.65" dur="5.25">practicing what we&amp;#39;re preaching</text>
  <text start="1797.42" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re walking our talk and this is so</text>
  <text start="1800.9" dur="6.39">important if we can do it they can do it</text>
  <text start="1803.75" dur="6.75">and one other thing that a hashtag</text>
  <text start="1807.29" dur="6.84">unread has taught me is that people are</text>
  <text start="1810.5" dur="6.14">now gaining the confidence to challenge</text>
  <text start="1814.13" dur="5.82">to confront their member of Congress</text>
  <text start="1816.64" dur="5.32">they never spoken in public they never</text>
  <text start="1819.95" dur="6.78">even spoken to their member of Congress</text>
  <text start="1821.96" dur="7.65">and now they&amp;#39;re doing so so this is an</text>
  <text start="1826.73" dur="7.31">empowering tool and we want to empower</text>
  <text start="1829.61" dur="4.43">people all over the country not just</text>
  <text start="1834.75" dur="5.82">to change the system but to build a new</text>
  <text start="1837.96" dur="4.05">one that&amp;#39;s absolutely right and one of</text>
  <text start="1840.57" dur="4.32">the things we&amp;#39;re doing is taking on</text>

  <text start="1851.1" dur="5.4">or Britain which does not have its own</text>
  <text start="1853.26" dur="7.02">Parliament I think and so we&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="1856.5" dur="6.09">the cyber thing as something that can go</text>
  <text start="1860.28" dur="5.1">international immediately so the people</text>
  <text start="1862.59" dur="5.49">can be empowered to vote and discuss and</text>
