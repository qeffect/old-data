  <text start="48.329" dur="6.241">a look at it but I&amp;#39;m loving the subtle</text>
  <text start="51.42" dur="7.76">public recognition you know in the past</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="7.86">Eric Trump liked a tweet once that said</text>
  <text start="59.18" dur="5.32">wwg 1wg a where we go when we go wall</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="4.439">and he proceeded to unlike it a little</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="3.99">time later but very subtle public</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="3.241">recognition both of these individuals</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="3.989">have actually done before Eric Trump</text>

  <text start="78.84" dur="4.08">reserving judgment on cue we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="81.299" dur="2.851">which way the wind blows I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="3.39">paraphrasing here that&amp;#39;s essentially</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="4.62">what he said but both these guys you</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="4.739">know more subtle public recognition good</text>
