  <text start="39.32" dur="6.34">probably within the next day or two I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="6.57">just gonna do a general like overview</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="3.57">video of things going on because I have</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="4.29">some exciting news to share with you</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="4.95">guys so stay tuned for that but in this</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="3.361">video I just wanted to cover the news so</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="3.539">let&amp;#39;s get down to business</text>
  <text start="55.44" dur="5.22">French election which is occurring today</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="5.461">and we have the globalist candidate</text>
  <text start="60.66" dur="4.95">Emmanuel macron versus basically what is</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="6.33">the anti-establishment candidate lepen</text>
  <text start="65.61" dur="7.38">and this is literally like American</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="5.94">election 2.0 with what happened so just</text>
  <text start="72.99" dur="9.18">about a day or two ago Emmanuel macron</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="8.07">was hacked and its media is saying he</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="4.8">has been the victim of a massive</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="5.76">coordinated hacking operation that they</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="4.98">claim looks eerily similar to what the</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="4.799">Russians did with Hillary Clinton in the</text>
  <text start="91.95" dur="4.59">US presidential election so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.079" dur="4.561">serious cover-your-ass measures going on</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="4.56">here for the globalist</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="5.369">to still get their candidate into office</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="4.89">and there is blatant anti are blatant</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="4.351">anti lepen media coverage everywhere</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="4.98">i&amp;#39;ve of course been more so follow</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="5.57">following american media on this story</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="6.66">but even in american media</text>
  <text start="113.93" dur="6.369">they&amp;#39;ve been saying that somehow macron</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="5.04">has been surging in popularity and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="5.1">so far ahead and there&amp;#39;s no way that she</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="4.17">can win and yadda yadda yadda but</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="3.78">remember that&amp;#39;s exactly what the media</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="4.74">said about hillary clinton pre american</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="3.761">election and her crowds could barely</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="4.54">fill a heist</text>
  <text start="132.94" dur="4.59">School Auditorium let alone win the</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="5.16">presidency and that obviously didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.53" dur="7.77">happen so when I look at the internet</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s not CNN or Washington Post when I</text>
  <text start="145.3" dur="5.43">look at actual people&amp;#39;s opinions and</text>
  <text start="147.37" dur="5.73">surf you know Facebook and blogs and</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="5.1">things like that everybody wants her to</text>
  <text start="153.1" dur="4.61">win lepen she is the anti-nato candidate</text>
  <text start="155.83" dur="4.31">she&amp;#39;s the anti-globalist candidate</text>
  <text start="157.71" dur="6.55">basically anti-establishment candidate</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="6.75">so I think and in France you know I</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="6.12">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t doubt that she is actually</text>
  <text start="166.89" dur="5.5">much further ahead in popularity so I do</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="3.69">think that we&amp;#39;re gonna see lepen get</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="3.87">into office so keep your eyes on the</text>
  <text start="174.07" dur="4.47">French election that&amp;#39;s big news big news</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="5.55">for the European Union and big news for</text>
  <text start="178.54" dur="5.76">the fight against basically the powers</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="5.37">that be the globalist so keep your eyes</text>
  <text start="184.3" dur="5.85">on that next we have WikiLeaks WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="7.53">dropped another set of vault seven</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="10.14">documents and this one was called</text>
  <text start="194.71" dur="8.55">Archimedes now again this was a small</text>
  <text start="200.29" dur="5.58">leak right I don&amp;#39;t necessarily know too</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="4.26">much about computer speak but this</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="6.15">essentially was saying there Archimedes</text>
  <text start="207.52" dur="6.21">tool that targeted computers or I should</text>
  <text start="212.02" dur="4.469">say computers that were on a local area</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="5.07">network a LAN could be targeted and</text>
  <text start="216.489" dur="4.821">basically exploited I don&amp;#39;t know too</text>
  <text start="218.8" dur="7.05">much about but again very small in</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="9.1">relation to what else we know the CIA</text>
  <text start="225.85" dur="6.27">has been involved with so nothing too</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="3.87">surprising there at least from my</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="5.1">perspective but I do wanted to make a</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="4.98">note on that is that we know the CIA has</text>
  <text start="237.22" dur="6.71">been involved with much deeper much more</text>
  <text start="239.26" dur="6.72">nefarious things a couple reasons that</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="4.36">whistleblowers and leakers aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.98" dur="4.8">dumping everything it wants is that they</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t want to cause mass hysteria in the</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="6.51">population they of course need people to</text>
  <text start="254.8" dur="4.38">believe the information because the mind</text>
  <text start="257.29" dur="5.129">control has been so strong that if they</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="5.01">were to leak for instance I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="262.419" dur="3.961">get into it but really deep dark CIA</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="3.69">stuff but people might not even believe</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;ll be like oh you know whatever the</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="4.23">conspiracy theories so we need to have a</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="4.94">slow roll up to literally prep people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="6.48">minds to believe these realities and</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="7.03">lastly what they&amp;#39;re also doing in my</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="5.34">opinion is making sure that what they do</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="3.69">leak has already been plugged up or</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="4.44">dealt with so then they can put the</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="5.76">information out in the public so each of</text>
  <text start="288.37" dur="5.01">these CIA hacking tools that get leaked</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="3.81">I think that they will just want to make</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="4.8">sure that it&amp;#39;s all dealt with before</text>
  <text start="295.09" dur="8.01">they leak it so I think we will see an</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="6.93">exponential rise in the the intensity of</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="5.16">what they leak you could say or the</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="4.46">importance the right descriptive term</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="4.05">isn&amp;#39;t really coming to me right now but</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="5.02">it&amp;#39;ll get we&amp;#39;re gonna you know the truth</text>
  <text start="312.31" dur="3.09">trains going to start speeding up that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="5.82">a good way to put it</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="8.34">and as we start seeing that will</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="4.74">definitely see other arrests and</text>
  <text start="323.74" dur="2.91">different things come with it so anyway</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="4.92">just wanted to make a note of that and</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="5.67">then this one is interesting really</text>
  <text start="330.07" dur="4.25">interesting actually Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.32" dur="5.7">having his first foreign trip as</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="6.67">president and check these out check the</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="9.69">places he&amp;#39;s visiting Israel Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="340.99" dur="9.84">and the Vatican so have your opinions on</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="5.67">that I have mine but a couple</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="4.2">speculations on what this could be I</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="3.18">mean just check him out he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="4.74">Israel Saudi Arabia in the Vatican those</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="7.86">are like you know powers that be central</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="7.47">so whether he is going to these specific</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="5.7">places to basically say hey if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="5.34">follow along in the game plan of the</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="3.87">Alliance you are gonna be dead in the</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="4.05">water and you&amp;#39;re gonna be taken down or</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="4.77">or you know who knows who knows why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="4.11">going to these places but definitely</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="4.32">keep an eye on it and I think it is big</text>
  <text start="380.74" dur="5.13">news and it&amp;#39;s really interesting is that</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="4.8">his wife Melania Trump she&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="5.07">accompanying him through the whole trip</text>
  <text start="387.88" dur="5.61">so who knows who knows why who knows</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="8.49">what but super interesting that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.49" dur="7.8">happening and also this does come before</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="3.54">very important meetings in a couple</text>
  <text start="401.29" dur="4.23">weeks that he&amp;#39;s having he&amp;#39;s having a</text>
  <text start="402.97" dur="6.27">meeting and with NATO and g7 on</text>
  <text start="405.52" dur="6.63">consecutive days on May 25th and 26th so</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="5.399">it&amp;#39;s again just very interesting to see</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="5.13">him have this specific trip going to</text>
  <text start="414.639" dur="5.301">these specific stops right before some</text>
  <text start="417.28" dur="9.57">huge meetings later this month so again</text>
  <text start="419.94" dur="10.39">big power play maybe a big a big way for</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="5.189">him to say get your act together guys or</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="3.809">you&amp;#39;re gonna be screwed because we all</text>
  <text start="432.039" dur="5.281">know Donald Trump has been a very vocal</text>
  <text start="434.139" dur="5.25">supporter of Netanyahu and Israel but</text>
  <text start="437.32" dur="4.79">again you got a khutba you got to see</text>
  <text start="439.389" dur="5.791">behind the words behind the scenes stuff</text>
  <text start="442.11" dur="5.86">why did Donald Trump have the</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="6.14">Palestinian president in the White House</text>
  <text start="447.97" dur="6.84">recently right and he&amp;#39;s inviting the</text>
  <text start="451.32" dur="4.719">basically anti-globalist President of</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="4.65">the Philippines</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="6.421">to the White House so he&amp;#39;s been saying</text>
  <text start="459.46" dur="5.01">he wants to be friends with Israel but</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="4.47">on the other hand he&amp;#39;s doing a lot of</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="4.229">things that don&amp;#39;t show that so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.93" dur="2.669">the old adage like I always say keep</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="3.421">your friends close keep your enemies</text>
  <text start="469.599" dur="4.711">closer maybe he was just saying that he</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="6.51">loves Israel to keep him real close to</text>
  <text start="474.31" dur="7.229">keep them and to also not you know not</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="4.409">stir anything up and that regard quite</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="4.341">yet if you understand what I mean but</text>
  <text start="483.039" dur="7.711">yeah so keep that keep an eye on that</text>
  <text start="485.88" dur="8.11">next we also have 900 arrests and this</text>
  <text start="490.75" dur="6.06">was this is huge news this was actually</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="6.87">covered surprisingly on various</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="8.31">mainstream media outlets it has not been</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="6.48">of course publicized that much but it</text>
  <text start="505.12" dur="5.07">was covered on the Emmet on the MSM the</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="5.369">mainstream media I saw on an MSN article</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="4.05">on an Inquisitor article so this is</text>
  <text start="512.709" dur="3.061">getting coverage but what essentially</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="4.979">happened it was called Operation</text>
  <text start="515.77" dur="6.72">pacifier and 900 different pedophiles</text>
  <text start="519.219" dur="5.01">were arrested from an international</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="3.66">standpoint there were some arrests in</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="4.531">America and in Europe but essentially</text>
  <text start="526.15" dur="5.04">what happened is the FBI used the</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="5.58">playpen Network which is on the dark web</text>
  <text start="531.19" dur="6.53">I believe it was the</text>
  <text start="534.34" dur="6.03">the biggest way for a lot of these</text>
  <text start="537.72" dur="3.97">people to remain anonymous on the dark</text>
  <text start="540.37" dur="3.66">web and do a lot of they&amp;#39;re just nasty</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="4.59">stuff but they used that network to</text>
  <text start="544.03" dur="2.64">basically track the pedos and take them</text>
  <text start="546.28" dur="2.4">down</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="3.99">so what happened is that they the FBI</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="4.62">used malware to seize the playpen</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="6.39">website and server so the FBI basically</text>
  <text start="553.3" dur="7.35">hacked into this they ran the Pape the</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="6.96">playpen server for a couple weeks to</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="5.1">infect to take that malware and infect</text>
  <text start="564.01" dur="3.03">all the target host computers gather</text>
  <text start="565.75" dur="5.88">data on them and find out where they</text>
  <text start="567.04" dur="8.01">were so some critics of this are calling</text>
  <text start="571.63" dur="7.95">this operation legally questionable that</text>
  <text start="575.05" dur="6.36">the FBI would essentially they did not</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="3.09">necessarily have a warrant and they</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="4.38">would hack into these people&amp;#39;s computers</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="6.15">and take them down that way but hey</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="5.25">again I mean who are they dealing with</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="3.9">here this is pretty nasty stuff and if</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.46">they need to do a little bit of hacking</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="8.69">to find them I&amp;#39;m kind of okay with that</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="10.05">and also I do want to make a note on</text>
  <text start="601.41" dur="10.45">this as well in that this is really</text>
  <text start="606.55" dur="6.66">interesting Snowden I in one of the</text>
  <text start="611.86" dur="3.42">videos I recently did I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="613.21" dur="4.14">which one it was but I commented on a</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="7.02">tweet that Snowden made he was actually</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="7.68">referencing this right here and he was</text>
  <text start="622.3" dur="4.8">almost the from his standpoint of this</text>
  <text start="625.03" dur="5.67">tweet what he was saying is that the FBI</text>
  <text start="627.1" dur="6.03">was actually running playpen okay but</text>
  <text start="630.7" dur="5.91">now we&amp;#39;re seeing that the reason FBI was</text>
  <text start="633.13" dur="7.04">running playpen was to find out where</text>
  <text start="636.61" dur="6.21">these guys were and make some arrests so</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="5.65">you know and this tweet was about a week</text>
  <text start="642.82" dur="7.95">ago I have written down here so whether</text>
  <text start="645.82" dur="7.68">Snowden was kind of misinformed as to</text>
  <text start="650.77" dur="5.91">what was going on could have been right</text>
  <text start="653.5" dur="5.58">we do know that this has been going on</text>
  <text start="656.68" dur="6.41">for a few months now I actually found a</text>
  <text start="659.08" dur="4.01">report where in January</text>
  <text start="666.94" dur="3.59">from operation pacifier and now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="669.37" dur="5.82">up to 900</text>
  <text start="670.53" dur="6.52">so maybe Snowden was misinformed maybe</text>
  <text start="675.19" dur="8.42">he was trying to do some misinforming</text>
  <text start="677.05" dur="9.21">mmm interesting point or maybe the FBI</text>
  <text start="683.61" dur="4.72">was actually running playpen for</text>
  <text start="686.26" dur="5.69">nefarious reasons who know who knows</text>
  <text start="688.33" dur="6.36">could have been a couple agents or a</text>
  <text start="691.95" dur="4.27">nefarious faction within the FBI who was</text>
  <text start="694.69" dur="5.16">actually running this for bad reasons</text>
  <text start="696.22" dur="5.37">and they got caught maybe maybe Snowden</text>
  <text start="699.85" dur="3.45">and other whistleblowers were putting</text>
  <text start="701.59" dur="3.9">the heat on him they got caught so then</text>
  <text start="703.3" dur="4.89">they had to then they had to make some</text>
  <text start="705.49" dur="3.84">arrests and act like they were doing it</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="2.69">for good reasons you know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="709.33" dur="6.93">of things we can speculate about that</text>
  <text start="710.88" dur="9.06">but the point I want to make by word</text>
  <text start="716.26" dur="7.77">vomiting all that at you guys was that</text>
  <text start="719.94" dur="6.4">are shining the limelight on this stuff</text>
  <text start="724.03" dur="3.93">is what&amp;#39;s gonna expose it okay talking</text>
  <text start="726.34" dur="4.38">about it is what&amp;#39;s gonna expose it</text>
  <text start="727.96" dur="4.56">yes it&amp;#39;s nasty yes it&amp;#39;s dark yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="730.72" dur="4.47">you know no fun to talk about no fun to</text>
  <text start="732.52" dur="6.9">think about but the only way we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="735.19" dur="7.74">to basically globally take this down is</text>
  <text start="739.42" dur="5.52">by the consciousness of it by</text>
  <text start="742.93" dur="3.51">understanding it by coming to terms with</text>
  <text start="744.94" dur="3.69">it by helping our friends and family</text>
  <text start="746.44" dur="4.11">wake up to the realities of it because</text>
  <text start="748.63" dur="4.86">the only way we can get past that</text>
  <text start="750.55" dur="6.9">darkness is by facing it and then you</text>
  <text start="753.49" dur="6.78">know we can have all the fun stuff post</text>
  <text start="757.45" dur="5.4">disclosure after that so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="760.27" dur="4.2">point I wanted to make um we got to talk</text>
  <text start="762.85" dur="4.98">about it we got to look at it and then</text>
  <text start="764.47" dur="7.26">lastly this was very interesting to me</text>
  <text start="767.83" dur="6.45">this was a article that was circulating</text>
  <text start="771.73" dur="3.96">around a lot of different mainstream</text>
  <text start="774.28" dur="4.65">media outlets because that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="775.69" dur="5.58">what they do one want whether it&amp;#39;s The</text>
  <text start="778.93" dur="4.59">Washington Post or I saw this on</text>
  <text start="781.27" dur="5.79">actually quite a few outlets I saw this</text>
  <text start="783.52" dur="5.52">on the Washington Post on futurism or</text>
  <text start="787.06" dur="5.79">whether it&amp;#39;s CNN MSNBC whatever it is</text>
  <text start="789.04" dur="5.58">one outlet will come out with a story</text>
  <text start="792.85" dur="3.3">and then all the other ones will pair it</text>
  <text start="794.62" dur="3.75">off of that you know it usually occurs</text>
  <text start="796.15" dur="3.939">within like hours and then they all kind</text>
  <text start="798.37" dur="3.519">of run the same story just with</text>
  <text start="800.089" dur="2.821">a little different writing it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="801.889" dur="2.94">they get their marching orders</text>
  <text start="802.91" dur="5.58">mainstream media&amp;#39;s I know they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="804.829" dur="5.43">told pretty much from the CIA to you</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="3.24">know run a story on this with this</text>
  <text start="810.259" dur="3.211">specific narrative in yadda yadda and</text>
  <text start="811.73" dur="3.63">then that sent to all the mainstream</text>
  <text start="813.47" dur="3.839">media outlets and then they all come out</text>
  <text start="815.36" dur="6.419">with the same story with just little</text>
  <text start="817.309" dur="6.75">specifics differing but this was one of</text>
  <text start="821.779" dur="4.56">those articles that blew up in the last</text>
  <text start="824.059" dur="3.51">couple days and this was essentially I</text>
  <text start="826.339" dur="2.461">have some notes written down about this</text>
  <text start="827.569" dur="3.21">because I do want to talk about it</text>
  <text start="828.8" dur="6.329">there was an astrophysicist from Penn</text>
  <text start="830.779" dur="7.201">State his name was Jason Wright he wrote</text>
  <text start="835.129" dur="4.65">a paper for Cornell so this was a pretty</text>
  <text start="837.98" dur="4.32">big deal right you know just write</text>
  <text start="839.779" dur="4.53">papers for Cornell let me tell you so he</text>
  <text start="842.3" dur="6.469">had a paper written that came out in a</text>
  <text start="844.309" dur="8.181">Cornell publication where he said that</text>
  <text start="848.769" dur="5.141">he was doing a lot of studying on</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="4.06">extraterrestrials in our solar system</text>
  <text start="853.91" dur="5.729">obviously from a mainstream mainstream</text>
  <text start="856.55" dur="5.88">perspective right and he was saying this</text>
  <text start="859.639" dur="6.89">was this was a quote in the future ISM</text>
  <text start="862.43" dur="7.259">article that I found but it was a very</text>
  <text start="866.529" dur="4.841">important quote and it was from this guy</text>
  <text start="869.689" dur="4.231">Jason Wright the physicist himself he</text>
  <text start="871.37" dur="5.189">said while all geological record of</text>
  <text start="873.92" dur="4.859">prior indigenous extraterrestrial</text>
  <text start="876.559" dur="5.19">technology would be long destroyed so</text>
  <text start="878.779" dur="6.451">he&amp;#39;s saying if there were any basically</text>
  <text start="881.749" dur="6.45">nonterrestrials that formed in our solar</text>
  <text start="885.23" dur="6.06">system previous to us they would be gone</text>
  <text start="888.199" dur="6.601">you know indigenous et cultures but then</text>
  <text start="891.29" dur="6.659">he said if there was a space faring</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="4.68">species for instance a you know a</text>
  <text start="897.949" dur="3.151">species that was technologically</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="3.899">advanced enough to go from solar system</text>
  <text start="901.1" dur="3.26">to solar system they may have left</text>
  <text start="903.379" dur="3.27">behind</text>
  <text start="904.36" dur="6.279">technological artifacts throughout our</text>
  <text start="906.649" dur="8.78">solar system that we could find that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="910.639" dur="9.151">what he said and that is a very big</text>
  <text start="915.429" dur="6.371">partial disclosure so partial UFO</text>
  <text start="919.79" dur="4.529">disclosure commenced what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="921.8" dur="4.349">you know what this article is running</text>
  <text start="924.319" dur="3.481">with is that oh yeah you know we might</text>
  <text start="926.149" dur="3.12">be able to find some ancient artifacts</text>
  <text start="927.8" dur="3.99">from extra strolls in our solar system</text>
  <text start="929.269" dur="3.151">but there&amp;#39;s no aliens here alive right</text>
  <text start="931.79" dur="3.03">now</text>
  <text start="932.42" dur="6.96">which we you know I am assuming if you</text>
  <text start="934.82" dur="6.27">watch my videos know is BS so again what</text>
  <text start="939.38" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re doing is putting stories out</text>
  <text start="941.09" dur="7.11">there that they might be able to run</text>
  <text start="943.22" dur="6.57">with if these arrests started not just</text>
  <text start="948.2" dur="5.52">being nine hundred but say there were</text>
  <text start="949.79" dur="6.42">nine thousand right say there was a huge</text>
  <text start="953.72" dur="4.86">number of people arrested a mass sweep</text>
  <text start="956.21" dur="3.87">occurring with you know some higher</text>
  <text start="958.58" dur="2.4">level names higher level politicians</text>
  <text start="960.08" dur="3.63">going down</text>
  <text start="960.98" dur="4.8">if this started to occur then they could</text>
  <text start="963.71" dur="4.41">take one of these stories and run with</text>
  <text start="965.78" dur="5.16">it and this is a big one that can run</text>
  <text start="968.12" dur="6.81">with for instance right how this could</text>
  <text start="970.94" dur="5.64">connect what if for instance I a couple</text>
  <text start="974.93" dur="4.35">weeks ago I know a couple week ago maybe</text>
  <text start="976.58" dur="5.64">a week ago I reported on mysterious</text>
  <text start="979.28" dur="4.68">markings found under Antarctica who what</text>
  <text start="982.22" dur="4.59">if they were to say those mysterious</text>
  <text start="983.96" dur="4.17">markings were from that ancient</text>
  <text start="986.81" dur="3.33">extraterrestrial race that was</text>
  <text start="988.13" dur="4.98">previously in our solar system but not</text>
  <text start="990.14" dur="4.8">here now right so you kind of see how a</text>
  <text start="993.11" dur="4.05">lot of these stories that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="994.94" dur="4.5">putting out in the media can be used to</text>
  <text start="997.16" dur="4.53">link together to then create a partial</text>
  <text start="999.44" dur="5.52">disclosure narrative you know maybe they</text>
  <text start="1001.69" dur="4.95">would say oh you know that new moon</text>
  <text start="1004.96" dur="3.6">enceladus oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="1006.64" dur="3.93">we found alien technology there holy</text>
  <text start="1008.56" dur="3.24">crap but those aliens aren&amp;#39;t here now</text>
  <text start="1010.57" dur="4.77">right</text>
  <text start="1011.8" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s no nothing else going on except</text>
  <text start="1015.34" dur="6">this ancient technology and then they</text>
  <text start="1017.08" dur="6.57">would oh we found you know free energy</text>
  <text start="1021.34" dur="4.53">physics in this alien technology on this</text>
  <text start="1023.65" dur="4.41">moon but again the aliens aren&amp;#39;t here</text>
  <text start="1025.87" dur="4.589">now so they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll hide are the</text>
  <text start="1028.06" dur="3.899">obfuscated some very important small</text>
  <text start="1030.459" dur="3.391">details but those small details are</text>
  <text start="1031.959" dur="2.761">really large details and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1033.85" dur="2.58">try to</text>
  <text start="1034.72" dur="4.7">that&amp;#39;s what partial disclosure is so</text>
  <text start="1036.43" dur="6.69">this article really stood out to me and</text>
  <text start="1039.42" dur="7.15">I saw I mean just in the past few days</text>
  <text start="1043.12" dur="6.57">I&amp;#39;ve seen all sorts of science articles</text>
  <text start="1046.57" dur="7.02">that are complete BS and I could do like</text>
  <text start="1049.69" dur="6.66">full hour-long videos just picking apart</text>
  <text start="1053.59" dur="5.01">all of the BS science that they they&amp;#39;ve</text>
