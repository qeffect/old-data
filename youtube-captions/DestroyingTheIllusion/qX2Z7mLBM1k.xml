  <text start="46.23" dur="3.45">and then one of the questioners</text>
  <text start="47.61" dur="5.25">mentioned the clinton foundation and</text>
  <text start="49.68" dur="5.899">child trafficking and sacrifice actually</text>
  <text start="52.86" dur="5.67">in his inquiry this was caught on camera</text>

  <text start="73.049" dur="3.21">putting out this medium article the</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="4.2">other day he called it the washington</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="5.911">post q and on segment was something out</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="5.699">of 1984 most definitely was writing the</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="4.05">post attempt to discredit q in that</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="3.991">video they put out the one with the</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="4.53">interview i did with them fell flat and</text>
  <text start="88.29" dur="4.71">it completely did it was such a dud and</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s why i haven&amp;#39;t even bothered to</text>
  <text start="93" dur="4.29">waste my time filming the reaction piece</text>
  <text start="95.13" dur="3.809">or putting out the recording i have of</text>
  <text start="97.29" dur="3">the interview because it was such a dud</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="3.36">and we have so many other things going</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="3.509">on and huge things coming up it looks</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="3.451">like that i don&amp;#39;t even have time to</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="4.89">waste on that anymore I might get to it</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="4.53">but maybe probably not so shout out to</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="4.051">Zack and we&amp;#39;ll see if they keep this up</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="5.159">on medium because I saw recently that</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="4.71">they closed the account of Martin Geddes</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.351">medium did and if you&amp;#39;re familiar with</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="4.949">Martin Geddes he&amp;#39;s a prolific Twitter he</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="5.55">had a medium article up about Q that had</text>
  <text start="122.399" dur="5.461">hundreds of thousands of views and they</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="5.639">closed his account because of supposed</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="4.93">extremist views and then saying that he</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="4.061">was basically spreading mists</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="4.35">information so shoot should I do like a</text>
  <text start="135.04" dur="3.779">daily censorship bit where I go through</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="3.569">all the groups and accounts I see that</text>
  <text start="138.819" dur="3.48">have been closed I mean I really should</text>
  <text start="140.709" dur="3.42">shouldn&amp;#39;t I because these are the folks</text>
  <text start="142.299" dur="3.481">that are saying the right things they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.129" dur="3.36">the ones over the target and they need</text>
  <text start="145.78" dur="3.299">our support - they need us going to</text>
  <text start="147.489" dur="3.181">their backup accounts and to the</text>
  <text start="149.079" dur="3.66">accounts the other ones that they have</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="3.39">up so shout-out to Martin I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="152.739" dur="3.87">linking his Twitter below and I&amp;#39;ll link</text>
  <text start="154.06" dur="4.739">some of sach stuff as well I really like</text>
  <text start="156.609" dur="4.321">both of their work now let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="158.799" dur="4.47">the situation with Trump - motorcades so</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="4.679">video shows a crash near Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.269" dur="5.58">motorcade yesterday I&amp;#39;ll play this video</text>
  <text start="165.609" dur="5.49">you can see the car hits the medium and</text>
  <text start="168.849" dur="4.771">if that medium wasn&amp;#39;t there that car</text>
  <text start="171.099" dur="5.551">probably would have gone into one of the</text>
  <text start="173.62" dur="5.85">cars of trumps motorcade so very scary</text>
  <text start="176.65" dur="5.429">situation was this just a distracted</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="5.639">driver or is there something more deeper</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="4.951">more sinister to this and if it was just</text>
  <text start="185.109" dur="3.81">a one-off incident I might think just a</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="3.9">distracted driver and a coincidence but</text>
  <text start="188.919" dur="3.6">of course is anything a coincidence and</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="5.459">the fact that this has happened before</text>
  <text start="192.519" dur="5.97">back in 2017 car without brakes nearly</text>
  <text start="196.389" dur="4.081">slams into Trump&amp;#39;s motorcade another</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="3.631">video was taken to this incident and the</text>
  <text start="200.47" dur="4.53">car basically came down this hill and</text>
  <text start="202.12" dur="5.13">almost again hit a car of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205" dur="3.959">motorcade so the fact that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="3.959">this before we sort of see a pattern</text>
  <text start="208.959" dur="3.9">emerging here and the fact that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.209" dur="3.39">a lot of variables we can take into</text>
  <text start="212.859" dur="4.56">account that are very real in this</text>
  <text start="214.599" dur="5.191">situation like the fact that cars can be</text>
  <text start="217.419" dur="5.03">hacked into right cars newer than what</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="5.729">2006 2008 they can be hacked into</text>
  <text start="222.449" dur="5.771">individuals can be mind controlled to do</text>
  <text start="225.519" dur="5.161">things like this that&amp;#39;s a very real</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="4.53">reality technologies exist to do that</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="4.019">okay and the fact that we have a</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="4.349">president in office right now that a lot</text>
  <text start="234.699" dur="5.671">of individuals don&amp;#39;t want in that</text>
  <text start="237.099" dur="5.491">position right so again distracted</text>
  <text start="240.37" dur="4.35">driver something more sinister you</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="3.69">decide I&amp;#39;m starting to see certain</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="3.719">patterns emerge with all of this and</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="4.289">let&amp;#39;s keep Trump and our prayers because</text>
  <text start="248.439" dur="5.281">he is most definitely putting a lot on</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="5.551">the line for all of us now let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="4.949">into that Hueber news so huber taking to</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="4.169">his twitter cue linking when a hubris</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="3.93">tweets the other day Huber putting out</text>
  <text start="260.289" dur="4.201">another one here saying the attorneys</text>
  <text start="262.599" dur="3.871">thoroughly enjoyed their time meeting</text>
  <text start="264.49" dur="4.05">with Ag Bar Attorney General</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="4.05">bar this week he has a solid proven</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="5.01">leader with a clear vision for the</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="5.49">Department of Justice Q then telling us</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="3.96">to keep the calendar updated and I think</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="3.39">soon we can expect the ending of</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="4.86">Mueller&amp;#39;s report that FISA</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="4.65">declassification and then that o IG</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="4.08">report if we&amp;#39;re looking at that calendar</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="4.68">that Q gave us I think that&amp;#39;s what looks</text>
  <text start="286.45" dur="4.38">to be what we have coming up and then</text>
  <text start="288.73" dur="3.95">coinciding with some accused drops today</text>

  <text start="297.73" dur="4.5">well so the American oversight I just</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="4.8">came across this organization apparently</text>

  <text start="304.75" dur="5.07">that uses FOIA to hold the government</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="4.74">accountable they&amp;#39;re saying here I mean</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="4.83">they don&amp;#39;t sound too nonpartisan but</text>

  <text start="322.02" dur="4.96">wide-ranging investigation of hillary</text>
  <text start="324.52" dur="5.73">clinton and you can guess it that</text>
  <text start="326.98" dur="5.25">prosecutor was huber so is it a</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="4.41">coincidence that this news is surfacing</text>

  <text start="561.37" dur="4.35">topic that a lot of people are waking up</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="4.77">to CNN putting this out today it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="4.53">just measles but mumps whooping cough</text>
  <text start="568.03" dur="5.91">and other vaccine preventable diseases</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="5.13">are still in the u.s. ok CNN well you</text>
  <text start="573.94" dur="3.84">forgot to mention that outbreak of</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="5.19">whooping cough in LA right now we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="577.78" dur="5.91">hundred percent of the individuals in</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="4.74">this outbreak were vaccinated all this</text>
  <text start="583.69" dur="3.99">propaganda we&amp;#39;ve seen coming out about</text>
  <text start="585.31" dur="4.71">vaccines is just so incredibly garbage</text>
  <text start="587.68" dur="4.71">if you saw my video yesterday I went a</text>
  <text start="590.02" dur="5.76">little more in-depth into all of it I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="592.39" dur="4.71">link it up there but I mean guys this is</text>
  <text start="595.78" dur="3.6">one of the biggest red pills</text>
  <text start="597.1" dur="4.8">there are q is a massive red pill</text>
  <text start="599.38" dur="5.55">vaccines is a huge red I mean there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="601.9" dur="6.12">many topics that are so catalyzing to a</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="5.04">person&amp;#39;s awakening this is why the deep</text>
  <text start="608.02" dur="4.56">state propaganda outlets like this they</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="4.68">are full front against everything right</text>
  <text start="612.58" dur="5.28">now against geoengineering against</text>
  <text start="614.65" dur="5.88">vaccines against Q as we know against</text>
  <text start="617.86" dur="5.64">even the et topic I mean a lot of</text>
  <text start="620.53" dur="4.83">misinformation put out there about UFOs</text>
  <text start="623.5" dur="4.29">and ETS everything they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="625.36" dur="4.74">patch up all the cracks in that dam they</text>
  <text start="627.79" dur="5.28">can and still discussing Big Pharma I</text>
  <text start="630.1" dur="6.36">saw this come out today FDA approves</text>
  <text start="633.07" dur="5.79">first immunotherapy regimen for breast</text>
  <text start="636.46" dur="4.31">cancer and the way I see it is that what</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="5.1">the pharmaceutical industry is calling</text>
  <text start="640.77" dur="6.76">immunotherapy will be the quote next big</text>
  <text start="643.96" dur="5.73">thing in mainstream medicine okay but I</text>
  <text start="647.53" dur="2.79">see it as kind of being a dog and pony</text>
  <text start="649.69" dur="2.94">show</text>
  <text start="650.32" dur="4.32">yeah these immunotherapy regimens might</text>
  <text start="652.63" dur="4.83">be more effective and of course less</text>
  <text start="654.64" dur="5.91">toxic than chemotherapy but I bet you</text>
  <text start="657.46" dur="4.94">they&amp;#39;re gonna cost a pretty penny and if</text>
  <text start="660.55" dur="3.78">you actually break down the word</text>
  <text start="662.4" dur="4.31">immunotherapy we&amp;#39;re just talking about</text>
  <text start="664.33" dur="4.45">therapy for your immune system and</text>
  <text start="666.71" dur="3.93">the you can do therapy for your immune</text>
  <text start="668.78" dur="4.65">system right now there&amp;#39;s plenty of cheap</text>
  <text start="670.64" dur="5.25">natural things out there things you can</text>
  <text start="673.43" dur="3.93">do that is immunotherapy to yourself</text>
  <text start="675.89" dur="3.48">that you don&amp;#39;t need the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="677.36" dur="3.66">industry for for instance when it comes</text>
  <text start="679.37" dur="3.72">to cancer you can use something like</text>
  <text start="681.02" dur="4.65">medicinal mushrooms medicinal mushrooms</text>
  <text start="683.09" dur="4.29">like chaga reishi and especially turkey</text>
  <text start="685.67" dur="3.36">tail if you&amp;#39;re looking at breast cancer</text>
  <text start="687.38" dur="4.08">look into turkey tail mushroom</text>
  <text start="689.03" dur="4.62">especially Paul Stamets world renowned</text>
  <text start="691.46" dur="5.4">mycologist Paul Stamets and his</text>
  <text start="693.65" dur="5.49">testimonial on his mother who had breast</text>
  <text start="696.86" dur="4.62">cancer who used turkey tail mushroom to</text>
  <text start="699.14" dur="4.31">help heal herself so there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="701.48" dur="4.17">things that you classify technically as</text>
  <text start="703.45" dur="4.12">immunotherapy medicinal mushrooms you</text>
  <text start="705.65" dur="3.39">can literally change your diet up I mean</text>
  <text start="707.57" dur="4.04">just doing a much better diet</text>
  <text start="709.04" dur="4.98">therapeutical nutritional diet could be</text>
  <text start="711.61" dur="4.62">immunotherapy right so we got to be very</text>
  <text start="714.02" dur="4.74">careful with how they are bringing</text>
  <text start="716.23" dur="5.35">preconceived notions into wordings into</text>
  <text start="718.76" dur="5.28">ideas the deep state propaganda does and</text>
  <text start="721.58" dur="4.89">especially the pharmaceutical industry</text>
  <text start="724.04" dur="5.34">so take the time to research health for</text>
  <text start="726.47" dur="4.83">yourself know thyself guys one of the</text>
  <text start="729.38" dur="3.93">most important things you can do to free</text>
  <text start="731.3" dur="3.96">your mind is start getting your body</text>
  <text start="733.31" dur="3.78">healthy as well and lastly let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="735.26" dur="4.2">into talking about free energy and space</text>
  <text start="737.09" dur="4.53">so I saw this from NBC today it says</text>
  <text start="739.46" dur="4.56">solar farms in space could be renewable</text>
  <text start="741.62" dur="4.38">energies next frontier China wants to</text>
  <text start="744.02" dur="4.5">put a solar power station in orbit by</text>
  <text start="746" dur="4.2">2050 and is building a test facility to</text>
  <text start="748.52" dur="4.38">find the best way to send the power to</text>
  <text start="750.2" dur="5.19">the ground so I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot of talk</text>
  <text start="752.9" dur="5.46">in mainstream media mainstream science</text>
  <text start="755.39" dur="5.37">especially about solar power and about</text>
  <text start="758.36" dur="4.02">nuclear fusion how these technologies</text>
  <text start="760.76" dur="4.05">are going to be the next best thing to</text>
  <text start="762.38" dur="4.26">say save us from climate change or the</text>
  <text start="764.81" dur="3.78">next best frontier and renewable</text>
  <text start="766.64" dur="4.77">energies but you know one thing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="768.59" dur="6.42">hear mentioned zero-point energy systems</text>
  <text start="771.41" dur="7.77">free energy overunity devices that</text>
  <text start="775.01" dur="6.42">utilize electromagnetism and output more</text>
  <text start="779.18" dur="4.98">electricity than it takes to run them</text>
  <text start="781.43" dur="4.83">these very much exist they&amp;#39;re very cheap</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re extremely effective I mean you</text>
  <text start="786.26" dur="3.18">have over a unity you have something</text>
  <text start="787.88" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s producing more and takes to run</text>
  <text start="789.44" dur="6.08">it for your energy and most importantly</text>
  <text start="792.53" dur="5.21">these are d centralized decentralized</text>
  <text start="795.52" dur="4.84">you don&amp;#39;t need to pay power bills</text>
  <text start="797.74" dur="6.76">everything becomes cheaper</text>
  <text start="800.36" dur="6.27">and you can be off-grid Wow amazing I</text>
  <text start="804.5" dur="4.32">would love that right house way out in</text>
  <text start="806.63" dur="4.92">timbuktu don&amp;#39;t have to be hooked up to</text>
  <text start="808.82" dur="5.37">anything got electricity and heat well</text>
  <text start="811.55" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s not being talked about and all</text>
  <text start="814.19" dur="4.35">this stuff on the green new deal on</text>
  <text start="816.38" dur="4.41">climate change on nuclear fusion it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="818.54" dur="4.169">all a limited hangout</text>
  <text start="820.79" dur="3.419">it&amp;#39;s them giving you a piece of the</text>
  <text start="822.709" dur="3.12">truth that&amp;#39;s Swiss in context and</text>
  <text start="824.209" dur="3.601">there&amp;#39;s a whole lot they&amp;#39;re not telling</text>
  <text start="825.829" dur="4.111">you and so much could be said about the</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="3.48">science and about the history of the</text>
  <text start="829.94" dur="2.73">suppression of these sorts of</text>
  <text start="831.29" dur="4.109">technologies what you can do with them</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="4.62">etc etc but I am interested to see</text>
  <text start="835.399" dur="3.901">what&amp;#39;s gonna come out with that quantum</text>
  <text start="837.29" dur="4.109">initiative act at Trump sign and the</text>
  <text start="839.3" dur="4.529">White House tweeting about the National</text>
  <text start="841.399" dur="4.951">quantum coordination office being set up</text>
  <text start="843.829" dur="4.711">as a part of it so I&amp;#39;m very interested</text>
  <text start="846.35" dur="4.32">to see if that quantum initiative Act is</text>
  <text start="848.54" dur="5.01">going to be utilized to start bringing</text>
  <text start="850.67" dur="5.01">some of these overunity devices and even</text>
  <text start="853.55" dur="4.32">quantum communication and other scalar</text>
  <text start="855.68" dur="4.55">energy other possibilities with that</text>
  <text start="857.87" dur="4.89">sort of physics with that sort of hidden</text>
  <text start="860.23" dur="3.82">esoteric sciences you know bringing</text>
  <text start="862.76" dur="4.47">these out to the public</text>
  <text start="864.05" dur="5.34">quantum initiative Act might help do</text>
  <text start="867.23" dur="4.14">that and also the space force so talking</text>
  <text start="869.39" dur="3.75">about the space force I saw this today</text>
  <text start="871.37" dur="4.529">and it totally slipped by me yesterday</text>
  <text start="873.14" dur="6.24">but this big news Air Force secretary</text>
  <text start="875.899" dur="6.271">Heather Wilson to step down Air Force</text>
  <text start="879.38" dur="4.829">secretary Heather Wilson and I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="3.72">space news comms article here because</text>
  <text start="884.209" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re putting a very intriguing twist</text>
  <text start="885.89" dur="4.949">on this having to do with the space</text>
  <text start="888.019" dur="4.921">force and her actions really lead me to</text>
  <text start="890.839" dur="4.951">believe that she was somewhat opposed to</text>
  <text start="892.94" dur="4.74">the space force she let a memo slip out</text>
  <text start="895.79" dur="4.169">in the middle of last year that</text>
  <text start="897.68" dur="3.96">essentially stated her estimation of the</text>
  <text start="899.959" dur="4.291">space force cost would be thirteen</text>
  <text start="901.64" dur="4.68">billion dollars and that really made a</text>
  <text start="904.25" dur="3.81">lot of people question her intent her</text>
  <text start="906.32" dur="3.87">agenda why would she let this memo sort</text>
  <text start="908.06" dur="3.33">of slip out there Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="910.19" dur="3.24">at the time</text>
  <text start="911.39" dur="4.53">deputy secretary now secretary Patrick</text>
  <text start="913.43" dur="3.93">Shanahan he said no no no no it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="915.92" dur="3.63">going to cost 13 billion it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="917.36" dur="4.8">only going to be like three four five</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="5.34">billion so there was almost this like</text>
  <text start="922.16" dur="4.23">struggle between Heather Wilson and</text>
  <text start="924.89" dur="2.67">Shanahan and you know various</text>
  <text start="926.39" dur="4.98">individuals in the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="927.56" dur="6.06">bureaucracies to stifle the space force</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="2.969">and to bring it forward you know so with</text>
  <text start="933.62" dur="3.24">her being</text>
  <text start="934.339" dur="5.16">gone I&amp;#39;m wondering what we could see by</text>
  <text start="936.86" dur="5.37">way of the developments in what they</text>
  <text start="939.499" dur="5.19">call the quantum coinciding with the</text>
  <text start="942.23" dur="5.579">space force space force gets created in</text>
  <text start="944.689" dur="5.58">six 12 18 months that quantum initiative</text>
  <text start="947.809" dur="4.89">act starts getting up to speed you know</text>
  <text start="950.269" dur="4.8">these things start getting disclosed and</text>
  <text start="952.699" dur="6.781">brought forth into the public in a very</text>
  <text start="955.069" dur="7.02">sort of benign seemingly organic way you</text>
  <text start="959.48" dur="6.359">know for the optics of it all to keep</text>
  <text start="962.089" dur="6.12">the public peace so you know that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="965.839" dur="6.54">of what I&amp;#39;m seeing sort of long term 6</text>
  <text start="968.209" dur="7.591">12 18 24 months space force quantum</text>
  <text start="972.379" dur="6.06">coordination office teaming up maybe you</text>
  <text start="975.8" dur="4.199">know don&amp;#39;t hold me to that but I&amp;#39;m sort</text>
  <text start="978.439" dur="4.681">of calling it right here that&amp;#39;s the way</text>
