  <text start="275.039" dur="4.661">of those those little instances where</text>
  <text start="277.08" dur="4.3">that fire was ignited in there</text>
  <text start="279.7" dur="3.69">consciousness and they&amp;#39;re like wow it</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="4.14">was that little moment it was that</text>
  <text start="283.39" dur="5.55">little thing that that person did and</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="5.79">that sparked the fire inside of them so</text>
  <text start="288.94" dur="3.48">you know be that spark be that spark for</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="2.85">somebody they might not even know your</text>
  <text start="292.42" dur="3.21">name you could just slip one of these</text>
  <text start="294.16" dur="4.32">things to them in the store and that</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="5.46">could be what ignites their awakening</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="6.54">process right never underestimate the</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="5.88">power of one little action so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to portray to you</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="4.59">guys really quick here but anyway into a</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="4.38">couple other news stories again it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="311.56" dur="4.38">gonna I&amp;#39;m not gonna go over a whole host</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="4.17">of stuff that I missed the past week but</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="5.13">I just want to cover a few things today</text>
  <text start="317.89" dur="5.85">and this one you know while I was in</text>
  <text start="321.07" dur="4.83">Vegas for that MUFON symposium one thing</text>
  <text start="323.74" dur="5.34">that was awesome is that it actually got</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="6.21">covered by local nuts Las Vegas news it</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="5.31">got covered by the CBS channel 8 there</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="4.02">on there Las Vegas now calm and they</text>
  <text start="334.39" dur="4.59">actually ran a couple articles not just</text>
  <text start="336.13" dur="6.15">one but multiple and they were very well</text>
  <text start="338.98" dur="6.06">done they were not ridiculing as most</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="4.47">articles as you would expect an article</text>
  <text start="345.04" dur="5.7">to be coming out on a mainstream source</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="7.25">right and this kind of ties in to the</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="6.54">idea of it being a grassroots movement</text>
  <text start="354" dur="4.81">this was posted these articles you know</text>
  <text start="357.28" dur="4.89">one story actually featured Gary</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="5.58">McKinnon the title of it was hacker says</text>
  <text start="362.17" dur="4.8">the US military has secret space program</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="5.94">besides NASA remember Gary McKinnon was</text>
  <text start="366.97" dur="5.64">the IT specialist who hacked into NASA</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="4.89">computers in 2002 and found evidence of</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="5.46">the solar warden faction of the secret</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="5.22">space program yadda yadda but that</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="3.81">tangent aside these are the kinds of</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="4.2">things that shows you that has to be a</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="7.41">grassroots movement right because these</text>
  <text start="384.64" dur="8.57">articles showed up on a local news</text>
  <text start="389.29" dur="7.65">outlet right and this isn&amp;#39;t this is a</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="6.79">important note is that a lot of local</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="6.48">stations tend to report the news and a</text>
  <text start="400" dur="8.42">far more unbiased in a far more fair way</text>
  <text start="403.42" dur="7.68">than the major mainstream you know CNN&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.42" dur="4.33">CBS&amp;#39;s MSNBC s and whatnot it&amp;#39;s usually</text>
  <text start="411.1" dur="5.88">the local affiliates that actually can</text>
  <text start="412.75" dur="6.24">report some truth we had these reported</text>
  <text start="416.98" dur="5.34">just in the last week on the CBS news</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="7.1">outlet a another example has been Swann</text>
  <text start="422.32" dur="6.72">Ben Swann was for the CBS Atlanta</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="5.29">affiliate right and he did his awesome</text>
  <text start="429.04" dur="5.1">expose is on Isis how America funds Isis</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="5.31">he did that quick five minute spiel on</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="4.8">pizza gate back in like January or</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="5.82">February that he really got really</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="6.51">ridiculed for and that probably caused</text>
  <text start="442.51" dur="4.44">his caused him to delete his Facebook</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="5.01">page because I&amp;#39;m sure he got some</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="5.7">threats whether it&amp;#39;s physical threats or</text>
  <text start="450.46" dur="6">litigation threats from that but you</text>
  <text start="452.65" dur="5.88">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s as if these grassroots</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="4.08">guys the local guys have a little bit</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="6.27">more leeway in what they can&amp;#39;t report so</text>
  <text start="460.54" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s really cool how people are starting</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="5.34">to view a lot more conspiratorial topics</text>
  <text start="467.35" dur="5.73">as serious and report them on local news</text>
  <text start="470.14" dur="4.62">outlets so keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="473.08" dur="3.81">right just because it&amp;#39;s a media</text>
  <text start="474.76" dur="3.69">corporation doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="476.89" dur="4.05">to lie to you doesn&amp;#39;t mean they</text>
  <text start="478.45" dur="5.279">automatically will spew complete</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="4.44">hundred-percent right you can</text>
  <text start="483.729" dur="3.391">always look for little pieces of truth</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="4.02">in the mainstream media corporations</text>
  <text start="487.12" dur="4.95">which I&amp;#39;ll make another point of in a</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="5.07">minute here in regards to the Allman</text>
  <text start="492.07" dur="5.07">Brothers story I want to get to but yeah</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="5.73">right I mean just cuz it&amp;#39;s mainstream</text>
  <text start="497.14" dur="4.17">just because it&amp;#39;s a large media outlet</text>
  <text start="500.2" dur="3">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s gonna be a hundred</text>
  <text start="501.31" dur="4.14">percent BS it&amp;#39;s a great world that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="5.4">black and white so that was really cool</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="5.37">you know seeing the hacker st. Gary</text>
  <text start="508.6" dur="5.249">McKinnon being reported on a CBS</text>
  <text start="510.82" dur="6.99">affiliate seeing just a day later they</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="5.581">did another report just saying secret</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="3.84">space program in America you know</text>
  <text start="519.43" dur="5.76">another expose on it so that was awesome</text>
  <text start="521.65" dur="4.68">to see so it&amp;#39;s pretty cool but next I</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="2.399">want to get into this story and this is</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="3.63">the important one of the day and it is</text>
  <text start="527.589" dur="3.811">the Allman Brothers being arrested one</text>
  <text start="529.96" dur="3.42">of the brothers would have was arrested</text>
  <text start="531.4" dur="4.05">in the Dulles Airport just this morning</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="5.07">and washing DC trying to flee the</text>
  <text start="535.45" dur="5.22">country and for a quick backstory if you</text>
  <text start="538.45" dur="6.93">don&amp;#39;t know who the Allman Brothers are</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="5.4">they were basically a group of Pakistani</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="3.42">brother</text>
  <text start="546.07" dur="4.02">who were hired in the early 2000s I</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="6.06">believe in about two thousand four or</text>
  <text start="550.09" dur="6.62">five by many different people associated</text>
  <text start="554.86" dur="4.2">with the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="556.71" dur="5.08">Organization bunch of Democrats and</text>
  <text start="559.06" dur="5.93">especially they were hired by the</text>
  <text start="561.79" dur="7.17">congresswoman debbie Wasserman Schultz</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="5.68">so the the Allman Brothers are have</text>
  <text start="568.96" dur="4.29">really been under scrutiny lately</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="5.52">because when they were hired by many of</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="6.57">these different Democrats it was they</text>
  <text start="576.19" dur="5.52">began essentially wiretapping and being</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="4.14">involved in a bunch of skullduggery</text>
  <text start="581.71" dur="5.39">whether it was bank fraud I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.96" dur="6.33">a lot of things they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="587.1" dur="5.46">scrutinized for but the Allman Brothers</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s just a whole host of fraud that</text>
  <text start="592.56" dur="6.49">follows them and lately they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="595.84" dur="6.87">under investigation just yesterday the</text>

  <text start="818.54" dur="7.18">distraction used as a distraction but</text>
  <text start="822.029" dur="6.06">also to get Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s name out</text>
