  <text start="20.939" dur="3.42">following this for the last six or seven</text>
  <text start="22.47" dur="3.33">months or so they&amp;#39;re the ones going</text>
  <text start="24.359" dur="3">through the pacer records at the end of</text>
  <text start="25.8" dur="3.719">every month and counting up the</text>

  <text start="46.379" dur="5.851">now remember what is normal only about a</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="6.03">thousand per year and this was asked for</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="6.239">a 2009 statistics so we have 50 times</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="6.15">more in less than a year than is</text>
  <text start="58.469" dur="6.241">normally done in one year and let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="61.5" dur="5.31">a look at the maps and spreadsheets so</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="5.31">this is a spreadsheet and you can see</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="7.95">since they began counting in April we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="5.93">had about 5300 per month 53 26 18 18</text>

  <text start="79.25" dur="5.32">hundred so interesting little uptick</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="4.26">maybe that means something big is coming</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="5.07">soon with them all and let&amp;#39;s take a look</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="5.07">at the map now so the red states are</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.71">those that have had more than a hundred</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="3.99">new indictments filed in the month of</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="3.269">August and you can see all the red</text>
  <text start="95.88" dur="3.57">states and it&amp;#39;s interesting to lay over</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="4.081">what we know about the deep state and</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="3.989">where they&amp;#39;re hubs of activity are and</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="4.14">where these indictments are being filed</text>
