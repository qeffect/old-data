  <text start="7.259" dur="5.79">exactly were supposed to never forget I</text>
  <text start="10.79" dur="4.33">was supposed to never forget the fact</text>
  <text start="13.049" dur="5.431">that somehow three planes brought down</text>
  <text start="15.12" dur="5.18">two buildings freefall speed I was</text>
  <text start="18.48" dur="5.07">supposed to never forget the fact that</text>
  <text start="20.3" dur="6.01">well where exactly is the plane the</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="6.149">fuselage the debris at the Pentagon on</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="6.12">9/11 right I&amp;#39;m supposed to never forget</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="4.38">the fact that well how much did Larry</text>
  <text start="32.43" dur="5.219">Silverstein make out with insurance</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="5.191">money after 9/11 huh or how about it we</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="4.23">never supposed to forget the fact that</text>
  <text start="39.27" dur="7.05">the day before 9/11 donald rumsfeld</text>
  <text start="41.879" dur="7.41">admitted to 2.3 trillion dollars missing</text>
  <text start="46.32" dur="6">from the Pentagon right what exactly are</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="5.401">we supposed to never forget hmm you know</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="6">some people say that these sorts of days</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="5.7">are not the day to share your quote</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="4.89">conspiracies share your truths about the</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="5.04">subject right they go no we&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="4.74">to mourn we&amp;#39;re supposed to remember and</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="3.81">pray and blah blah blah basically</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re saying you should stay silent</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="6.44">too spreading the truth about the matter</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="7.441">and I in fact think that&amp;#39;s ass backwards</text>
  <text start="75.68" dur="7.21">it&amp;#39;s probably the most respectful thing</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="5.64">that you could do is share the the truth</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="4.519">of the matter share the hard-hitting</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="7.379">questions ask them on a day like this</text>
  <text start="87.409" dur="6.791">because how much of the fallout how much</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="5.371">of the suffering how much of the the</text>
  <text start="94.2" dur="6.57">death that has occurred from false Flags</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="8.4">events such as 9/11 that we&amp;#39;re all in</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="6.389">vain right so staying silent is in fact</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="3.51">in my opinion one of the most</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="6.32">disrespectful things you can do that</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="7.17">means that you are not brave enough or</text>
  <text start="113.479" dur="6.43">you cannot emotionally handle yourself</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="5.129">to a point to blow open these subjects</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="3.42">right subjects that need to be talked</text>
  <text start="121.409" dur="4.5">about the truth should about them should</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="4.201">be out there right how many how much</text>
  <text start="125.909" dur="6.671">needless suffering has happened because</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="7.22">people are staying silent hmm</text>

  <text start="298.31" dur="3.99">to kind of distinguish because it</text>
  <text start="299.78" dur="4.65">separates the wheat from the chaff when</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;re looking at journalists or newer</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="4.83">news organizations or you know various</text>

  <text start="333.29" dur="4.17">hands in it now okay we&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="4.23">little closer to what I think the truth</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="5.1">might be but to say it was only Saudi</text>
  <text start="339.62" dur="5.34">Arabia nah and then the people that</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="5.88">usually say oh it was Saudi Arabia they</text>

  <text start="350.3" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;ll do that but now I enjoy the ones</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="5.7">that go for the full spectrum truth</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="4.25">right no holds bar that&amp;#39;s what I respect</text>
  <text start="359.45" dur="4.35">cuz that&amp;#39;s the kind of person that I am</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="3.55">so for those out there saying oh yeah</text>

  <text start="367.04" dur="5.48">course it was an inside job it had to be</text>
  <text start="369.47" dur="6.3">who made NORAD stand down on that day</text>
  <text start="372.52" dur="4.75">not only that what are the Mossad</text>
  <text start="375.77" dur="4.79">connections the rogue Israeli</text>
  <text start="377.27" dur="5.399">intelligence connections right hmm</text>
  <text start="380.56" dur="4.33">seldom do you hear people talk about</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="6.181">those connections but for those that do</text>
  <text start="384.89" dur="6.8">I respect them and of course I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="6.54">be that kind of person</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="7.22">full-spectrum woke so who answers the</text>
  <text start="395.39" dur="6.8">who where AVI</text>
  <text start="398.91" dur="5.53">what what did it ooh the what&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="5.9">one so what exactly did take down the</text>
  <text start="404.44" dur="7.23">towers obviously it wasn&amp;#39;t a plane so</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="4.72">controlled demolition mhm mhm absolutely</text>
  <text start="411.67" dur="3.15">plenty of evidence for that we have</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="5.75">pictures of little blasts going off</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="5.31">before the as the tower crumbles right</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="5.14">testimonial evidence</text>
  <text start="420.13" dur="5.64">firefighters hearing explosions we have</text>
  <text start="423.7" dur="4.95">some of the pillars were like cut at</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="5.73">45-degree angles as if the the thermite</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="5.13">was planted in them so lots of evidence</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="4.88">for controlled demolitions now I do not</text>
  <text start="433.78" dur="5.04">think that was the only thing though I</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="4.18">also believe there were directed energy</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="4.02">weapons that were involved in this</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="4.53">scalar weaponry right we can have a long</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="3.93">conversation about what exactly scalar</text>
  <text start="445.09" dur="4.89">weaponry is why I&amp;#39;m even using the word</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="5.61">scalar where it came from Tesla and</text>
  <text start="449.98" dur="3.84">others etc etc but yes this is</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="5.34">technology available in the black</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="7.11">projects and you see photographs of huge</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="6.56">hundred-foot cement steel spires on 911</text>
  <text start="460.93" dur="5.49">that just turned into dust like poof I</text>
  <text start="464.28" dur="3.79">have what else could do that other than</text>
  <text start="466.42" dur="4.08">directed energy weapon reso I think it</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="4.26">was a multitude of things you know the</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="2.91">controlled explosive took down two</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="4.5">towers and they wanted to make sure</text>
  <text start="473.41" dur="5.31">those towers were down with the de w&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.83" dur="5.13">and we&amp;#39;re just talking about the two</text>
  <text start="478.72" dur="5.54">twin towers though here what about the</text>
  <text start="481.96" dur="4.95">other building Trade Center seven</text>
  <text start="484.26" dur="4.66">definite controlled explosives in that</text>
  <text start="486.91" dur="3.84">it was totally pulled you see that you</text>
  <text start="488.92" dur="3.99">saw the middle cave and then it fell</text>
  <text start="490.75" dur="4.65">free fall right into its own footprint</text>
  <text start="492.91" dur="4.29">so definite controlled explosives with</text>
  <text start="495.4" dur="4.89">that one now let&amp;#39;s talk about the</text>
  <text start="497.2" dur="6.5">Pentagon what happened at the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="500.29" dur="7.83">well photographic evidence of a turbofan</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="6.61">from a Tomahawk cruise missile at the</text>
  <text start="508.12" dur="4.35">Pentagon right there and also like I</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="3.78">mentioned earlier no fuselage crucial</text>
  <text start="512.47" dur="6.15">question to ask why is there no fuschia</text>
  <text start="514.09" dur="6.84">laws of any kind of plane at the</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="3.96">Pentagon and then of course we have what</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="4.53">video and photographic evidence of it</text>
  <text start="522.58" dur="8.46">being a missile as well so just logical</text>
  <text start="525.46" dur="6.319">basic connections just observe deduce</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="2.719">and</text>
  <text start="531.779" dur="3.271">then formulate your opinions a lot of</text>
  <text start="533.759" dur="3.721">people go the other way around they like</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="5.969">to read read read read and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="8.669">actually look at what&amp;#39;s going on they</text>
  <text start="541.019" dur="6.48">get caught up in theory and ideas in</text>
  <text start="546.149" dur="3.54">their head they don&amp;#39;t have any logical</text>
  <text start="547.499" dur="4.71">basis in reality look at reality right</text>
  <text start="549.689" dur="4.32">and then form European opinion based off</text>
  <text start="552.209" dur="4.891">what&amp;#39;s possible and what&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="554.009" dur="6.12">so missile up nine missile at the</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="4.5">Pentagon and then to talk about that</text>
  <text start="560.129" dur="4.101">plane that went down in Pennsylvania</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="5.039">again no fuselage no parts no pieces</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="5.529">where&amp;#39;s everybody go where&amp;#39;s bodies etc</text>
  <text start="566.639" dur="5.49">etc all you all we get is this hole in</text>
  <text start="569.759" dur="5.94">the ground that looks like it was a</text>
  <text start="572.129" dur="5.7">missile right so what happened did they</text>
  <text start="575.699" dur="6.81">did they jack that plane take it</text>
  <text start="577.829" dur="6.091">somewhere and dispose of it in them I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="582.509" dur="4.38">be honest with this sounds sick and</text>
  <text start="583.92" dur="5.55">gross but hey this is the kind of deep</text>
  <text start="586.889" dur="4.471">state cabal we&amp;#39;re dealing with here if</text>
  <text start="589.47" dur="5.46">you also look and do woman named Susan</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="7.829">Lindauer she has testimony where she</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="6.42">said that one of the fighter jets that</text>
  <text start="599.189" dur="4.051">was trailing that plane in Pennsylvania</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="3.299">which some say that plane was supposed</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="2.55">to go hit the White House maybe or the</text>
  <text start="604.649" dur="4.74">Capitol building or something like that</text>
  <text start="605.79" dur="5.7">is that a fighter jet actually took down</text>
  <text start="609.389" dur="3.63">one of the one of the pilots of the</text>
  <text start="611.49" dur="3.48">fighters that were tailing it caught on</text>
  <text start="613.019" dur="3.36">to what was going on took it down with a</text>
  <text start="614.97" dur="3.96">missile so they took the plane down and</text>
  <text start="616.379" dur="5.371">that fighter pilot in that jet was</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="5.43">actually taken and quarantined so he</text>
  <text start="621.75" dur="5.85">wouldn&amp;#39;t talk and he was drugged so</text>
  <text start="624.36" dur="8.07">that&amp;#39;s one possibility maybe the plane</text>
  <text start="627.6" dur="6.51">was taken down by an f15 that pilot put</text>
  <text start="632.43" dur="6.18">into isolation so he wouldn&amp;#39;t talk and</text>

  <text start="977.41" dur="4.65">how vague that is offensive</text>
  <text start="979.589" dur="6.43">it&amp;#39;s almost as vague as national</text>
  <text start="982.06" dur="6.69">security uh uh sometimes that reason is</text>
  <text start="986.019" dur="6.591">used very vaguely but Facebook is making</text>
  <text start="988.75" dur="8.16">an AI to identify offensive memes and</text>

  <text start="996.91" dur="6.09">hours after Q posts get your memes ready</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="9.08">because the non NSA tech can&amp;#39;t identify</text>

  <text start="1008.75" dur="8.949">so there was that today&amp;#39;s seeming to be</text>
  <text start="1011.67" dur="7.89">a very quiet day very quiet day of</text>

  <text start="1309.59" dur="7.38">separate video in and of itself but to</text>
  <text start="1313.309" dur="7.801">answer that in short form without</text>
  <text start="1316.97" dur="8.61">citations what they teach us in</text>
  <text start="1321.11" dur="6.76">mainstream science is ass backwards so</text>
  <text start="1325.58" dur="3.5">they teach us that stars start out as</text>
  <text start="1327.87" dur="4.309">[Music]</text>
  <text start="1329.08" dur="4.51">how do they I&amp;#39;ve been studying this for</text>
  <text start="1332.179" dur="3.091">so long and trying to wrap my brain</text>
  <text start="1333.59" dur="3.3">around it that I forget what they teach</text>
  <text start="1335.27" dur="3.06">us in the mainstream like I forget the</text>
  <text start="1336.89" dur="3.659">brainwashing because I&amp;#39;m just not</text>
  <text start="1338.33" dur="3.27">subject to it don&amp;#39;t they teach us star</text>
  <text start="1340.549" dur="2.88">start out as red</text>
  <text start="1341.6" dur="4.319">no no they teach us star start out as</text>
  <text start="1343.429" dur="4.351">blue and get to red like their big blue</text>
  <text start="1345.919" dur="3.39">giants and then as they progress they</text>
  <text start="1347.78" dur="4.08">get smaller and smaller and then grow in</text>
  <text start="1349.309" dur="4.5">size to red red giants and then they</text>
  <text start="1351.86" dur="4.65">explode but that&amp;#39;s actually asked</text>
  <text start="1353.809" dur="5.551">backwards they start out as red giants</text>
  <text start="1356.51" dur="5.399">and then as they obtain more mass more</text>
  <text start="1359.36" dur="4.98">stuff they get more dense and more dense</text>
  <text start="1361.909" dur="3.9">make it smaller and they get more yellow</text>
  <text start="1364.34" dur="2.699">and then they get more white as they get</text>
  <text start="1365.809" dur="2.73">hotter and hotter because again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1367.039" dur="3.211">accumulating mass then they start</text>
  <text start="1368.539" dur="3.63">growing again they reach that limit</text>
  <text start="1370.25" dur="3.809">where they condense in size and they</text>
  <text start="1372.169" dur="4.471">begin growing again then they end up</text>
  <text start="1374.059" dur="5">they end up as blue and then explode</text>
  <text start="1376.64" dur="5.07">think of it as like heating up metal</text>
  <text start="1379.059" dur="5.531">logical as you heat up metal it starts</text>
  <text start="1381.71" dur="5.19">read at the coolest and it gets too blue</text>
  <text start="1384.59" dur="8.4">with the hottest right it&amp;#39;s just like a</text>
  <text start="1386.9" dur="7.92">star star starts red ends up blue so</text>
  <text start="1392.99" dur="3.36">actually what they teach us about again</text>
  <text start="1394.82" dur="5.43">there&amp;#39;s so much we have to unlearn and</text>
  <text start="1396.35" dur="7.35">relearn guys so much and if you do want</text>
  <text start="1400.25" dur="9.75">some quick quick rabbit holes quick key</text>
  <text start="1403.7" dur="8.4">words to research that idea of stellar</text>
  <text start="1410" dur="5.88">evolution being wrong look up Dewey be</text>
  <text start="1412.1" dur="6.89">Larson and his reciprocal systems theory</text>
  <text start="1415.88" dur="5.58">just type in stellar evolution</text>
  <text start="1418.99" dur="6.9">reciprocal systems theory you should be</text>
  <text start="1421.46" dur="6.87">able to find some stuff on that so uh</text>
  <text start="1425.89" dur="4.81">yeah what they teach us about just about</text>
  <text start="1428.33" dur="4.05">everything is a little wrong cuz it all</text>
  <text start="1430.7" dur="4.38">fits together and one this in one big</text>
  <text start="1432.38" dur="4.89">contextual picture right so if they</text>
  <text start="1435.08" dur="3.56">teach us I&amp;#39;m not saying that a hundred</text>
  <text start="1437.27" dur="3.75">percent of what they teach us in</text>
  <text start="1438.64" dur="5.88">establishment schooling is wrong but if</text>
  <text start="1441.02" dur="6.3">we have even fifty percent of those</text>
  <text start="1444.52" dur="4.84">pieces of data that they teach us are</text>
  <text start="1447.32" dur="5.13">wrong then we&amp;#39;re going to frame the</text>
  <text start="1449.36" dur="5.79">other 50% as concepts in our mind as</text>
  <text start="1452.45" dur="3.9">wrong concepts it&amp;#39;s ok they might not</text>
  <text start="1455.15" dur="3.27">teach us a hundred percent of wrong</text>
  <text start="1456.35" dur="4.41">things but what we end up in our brains</text>
  <text start="1458.42" dur="9.3">afterwards is 100 percent wrong because</text>
  <text start="1460.76" dur="10.53">the context is all screwed up they teach</text>
  <text start="1467.72" dur="5.97">us that antigravity that doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="1471.29" dur="4.11">and it&amp;#39;s not possible so then we get</text>
  <text start="1473.69" dur="3.84">millions of people who just have no idea</text>
  <text start="1475.4" dur="4.32">about the context of a secret space</text>
  <text start="1477.53" dur="4.32">program what is involved in secret space</text>
  <text start="1479.72" dur="3.24">programs a secret space program just</text>
  <text start="1481.85" dur="2.46">doesn&amp;#39;t mean a couple rinky-dink</text>
  <text start="1482.96" dur="4.53">satellites up there that they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1484.31" dur="4.65">us about and in what x37 space</text>
  <text start="1487.49" dur="4.68">plane that still uses rockets and wings</text>
  <text start="1488.96" dur="5.6">no we&amp;#39;re talking about spacecraft that</text>
  <text start="1492.17" dur="4.95">use anti-gravity that can basically</text>
  <text start="1494.56" dur="5.17">instant transmit themselves portal</text>
  <text start="1497.12" dur="5.22">themselves they don&amp;#39;t fly in that</text>
  <text start="1499.73" dur="4.23">typical way they levitate and they they</text>
  <text start="1502.34" dur="4.41">skirt themselves along with electricity</text>
  <text start="1503.96" dur="4.64">you won&amp;#39;t even get these concepts you</text>
  <text start="1506.75" dur="4.02">won&amp;#39;t be able to think of the context of</text>
  <text start="1508.6" dur="7.27">secret space programs in a truthful</text>
  <text start="1510.77" dur="10.38">manner without right again with those</text>
  <text start="1515.87" dur="6.84">wrong dots wrong data so anyway it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1521.15" dur="3.77">all for this one guys I&amp;#39;m gonna head out</text>
  <text start="1522.71" dur="5.61">I&amp;#39;m gonna go get to work on some things</text>
  <text start="1524.92" dur="6.55">maybe interview some folks for some more</text>
  <text start="1528.32" dur="5.16">videos later today get some work later</text>
  <text start="1531.47" dur="4.2">on tomorrow if somebody just said along</text>
  <text start="1533.48" dur="6.54">musk claimed that electrogravitics is</text>
  <text start="1535.67" dur="5.97">not possible Joe Rogan interview you got</text>
  <text start="1540.02" dur="3.24">a time stamp for that somebody else said</text>
  <text start="1541.64" dur="2.85">that but I haven&amp;#39;t actually seen that in</text>
  <text start="1543.26" dur="3.87">the interview I would like to listen to</text>
  <text start="1544.49" dur="5.84">his exact words because if he did say</text>
  <text start="1547.13" dur="5.57">that that leads me</text>
  <text start="1550.33" dur="4.14">more of a belief more of a firm belief</text>
  <text start="1552.7" dur="5.219">that Elaan musk is just a smokescreen</text>
  <text start="1554.47" dur="5.37">again a couple just short questions on</text>
  <text start="1557.919" dur="3.811">that why name your company Tesla and not</text>
  <text start="1559.84" dur="3.99">even use Tesla based technologies you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1561.73" dur="3.93">still using rocket fuel and Bernoulli&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1563.83" dur="3.42">principle and your engineering it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1565.66" dur="3.75">a slap in the face to Nikola Tesla</text>
  <text start="1567.25" dur="4.23">Nikola Tesla is probably rolling over in</text>
  <text start="1569.41" dur="5.879">his grave with perpetual motion right</text>
  <text start="1571.48" dur="5.49">now being pissed off that musk would go</text>
  <text start="1575.289" dur="3.951">do that and for him to say</text>
  <text start="1576.97" dur="6.72">electrogravitics isn&amp;#39;t possible well</text>
  <text start="1579.24" dur="6.549">that&amp;#39;s just wrong that&amp;#39;s just wrong and</text>
  <text start="1583.69" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s a lot of science and evidence</text>
  <text start="1585.789" dur="7.081">and hey even technologies coming out</text>
  <text start="1589.15" dur="5.25">that are gonna prove musk wrong so you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1592.87" dur="4.26">better take a hit of that spliff well he</text>
  <text start="1594.4" dur="4.92">can in fact he&amp;#39;s probably gonna need a</text>
  <text start="1597.13" dur="6.06">few more of those spliffs once his</text>
  <text start="1599.32" dur="5.19">consciousness is rocked heck probably a</text>
  <text start="1603.19" dur="5.84">few million people in this country that</text>
  <text start="1604.51" dur="4.52">are gonna need a spliff very soon</text>
  <text start="1609.48" dur="5.47">they&amp;#39;re gonna be pretty shocked at the</text>
  <text start="1611.559" dur="5.461">way the world really is so anyway take</text>
