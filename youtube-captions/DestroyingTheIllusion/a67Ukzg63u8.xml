  <text start="0.03" dur="4.47">hey there everyone so I&amp;#39;m extremely</text>
  <text start="1.77" dur="4.38">excited to finally be sharing with you</text>
  <text start="4.5" dur="4.26">this interview that I did with the</text>
  <text start="6.15" dur="6.029">wonderful author and researcher dr.</text>
  <text start="8.76" dur="6.24">Michael Saleh now I&amp;#39;m not gonna lie I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="12.179" dur="5.161">had this interview for quite a few weeks</text>
  <text start="15" dur="4.02">now I think almost a month my plan was</text>
  <text start="17.34" dur="3.72">to actually release it quite a long time</text>
  <text start="19.02" dur="5.16">ago but of course over the past few</text>
  <text start="21.06" dur="4.709">weeks my life has been pretty crazy I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="24.18" dur="3.9">been dealing with a whole lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="5.971">so I haven&amp;#39;t been able to get it out yet</text>
  <text start="28.08" dur="5.7">but everything works in divine timing</text>
  <text start="31.74" dur="5.19">this interview that I did with dr.</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="7.11">Michael Salah was on his upcoming book</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="5.85">and arcticus hidden history and he</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="3.84">announced the release for this book</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s going to be March 25th</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.2">so hey better late than never and</text>
  <text start="47.07" dur="4.169">actually perfect timing because this</text>
  <text start="48.93" dur="4.859">book is coming up it&amp;#39;s coming out very</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="4.471">soon and you&amp;#39;ll get to hear this</text>
  <text start="53.789" dur="4.5">fantastic interview where dr. Michael</text>
  <text start="55.71" dur="6.57">Salah discusses what he writes in that</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="6.51">book and he talks about the hidden</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="5.339">history of Antarctica how it was</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="5.43">actually essentially colonized by the</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="4.32">Nazis during World War Two and he also</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="3.331">talks about the ancient history of</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="4.5">Antarctica which is massively</text>
  <text start="73.56" dur="5.73">fascinating how there was possibly a</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="4.891">geophysical pole shift in ancient</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="4.259">history and Antarctica could have very</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="4.32">well been at a literal different</text>
  <text start="83.549" dur="4.051">latitude a different spot on the Earth&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="3.63">surface and then the earth shifted so</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="3.449">there&amp;#39;s a lot of great information here</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="3.72">this interview that you&amp;#39;re gonna get and</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="4.081">like I said you can check out dr.</text>
  <text start="93" dur="5.369">Michael&amp;#39;s Allah&amp;#39;s book Antarctica&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.13" dur="6.3">hidden history coming up here coming out</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.5">excuse me on March 25th so let&amp;#39;s roll</text>
  <text start="101.43" dur="3.89">that intro and get to that interview</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="2.451">boom</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="4.06">welcome ladies and gentlemen and I think</text>
  <text start="112.57" dur="3.96">dr. Salah for joining me here today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="114.49" dur="4.05">his first time actually on the on my</text>
  <text start="116.53" dur="5.28">channel here so thank you for joining me</text>
  <text start="118.54" dur="6">dr. Saleh thanks to have me Jordan</text>
  <text start="121.81" dur="4.44">absolutely so we&amp;#39;re going to talk quite</text>
  <text start="124.54" dur="3.24">a bit about Antarctica today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.25" dur="4.619">something a lot of people are curious</text>
  <text start="127.78" dur="4.98">about and I&amp;#39;m excited that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="130.869" dur="4.711">share a lot of information regarding it</text>
  <text start="132.76" dur="3.66">so first can we get into some of the</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="2.879">ancient history</text>
  <text start="136.42" dur="5.07">tell me about Charles Hapgood and some</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="4.791">of his discoveries on pole shifts and</text>
  <text start="141.49" dur="5.4">how that has to do with Antarctica</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="6.34">well Charles Hapgood was someone who was</text>
  <text start="146.89" dur="5.43">very prominent in the 1950s and 60s for</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="5.24">doing some of the pioneering research</text>
  <text start="152.32" dur="5.52">into the maps of the ancient sea kings</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="7.27">basically these mysterious maps that</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="6.48">showed places like Antarctica ice-free</text>
  <text start="162.1" dur="5.28">and so people were really trying to</text>
  <text start="164.32" dur="7.05">understand how it could be and had this</text>
  <text start="167.38" dur="6.48">really interesting theory called the the</text>
  <text start="171.37" dur="4.83">shifting polls although Goods of crustal</text>
  <text start="173.86" dur="6.09">displacement theory and he came out with</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="6.03">a book that basically explained the</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="4.77">mechanisms behind the Earth&amp;#39;s ship in</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="4.38">crust that he was able to look at a lot</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="5.43">of evidence showing that this was a</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="5.34">phenomenon that would occur periodically</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="3.69">I mean he&amp;#39;s talking about tens of</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="5.58">thousands of years thousands of years</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="6.39">but the people its axis of rotation</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="5.19">would actually shift so that the South</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="4.11">Pole and the North Pole would actually</text>
  <text start="202.72" dur="4.62">basically move in terms of the</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="4.8">geographic pole from one ball from one</text>
  <text start="207.34" dur="4.44">location to another hundreds or even</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="5.849">thousands of miles so we took me about a</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="4.799">pretty radical theory and a half good</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="4.59">theory was supported by no less than</text>
  <text start="216.579" dur="4.981">Albert Einstein in the time who wrote</text>
  <text start="219.579" dur="6.291">the foreword to his book the birth to</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="6.05">ship being crossed so this was really</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="5.17">significant because it showed that</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="5.5">someone like Einstein really thought</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="4.77">that there was a lot of Merit to</text>
  <text start="233.11" dur="5.07">Hepburn&amp;#39;s theory and so good spirit</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="4.38">gives us a way of understanding how a</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="4.2">place like Antarctica could have one</text>
  <text start="240.19" dur="2.82">point have been in a temperate region of</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="2.76">a planet</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="5.46">with the civilization on the surface</text>
  <text start="245.14" dur="6.95">which came with one of these whole ships</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="6.39">suddenly shifted to its present location</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="5.369">where the South Pole is right over the</text>
  <text start="254.86" dur="7.2">the middle of the and</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="6.881">to the three miles of ice wall group so</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="4.139">we&amp;#39;re not talking just a magnetic pole</text>
  <text start="264.34" dur="4.29">shift which I I just saw an article</text>
  <text start="266.199" dur="5.131">yesterday on futurism actually so that</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="3.9">that idea of a magnetic pole shift is</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="4.02">visiting the mainstream but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.53" dur="5.55">talking geophysical so actually shifting</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="4.439">in the continent exactly and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="4.97">a pretty major event because you know</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="6.211">the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic pole geophysical as</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="5.5">well the geomagnetic pole is as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286" dur="6.18">cold you know that that moves all the</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="6.239">time and so you know we don&amp;#39;t experience</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="6.51">any great dramatic difference other than</text>
  <text start="294.789" dur="7.44">maybe compasses on the percentage of the</text>
  <text start="298.69" dur="6.09">debris and aircraft navigation well you</text>
  <text start="302.229" dur="4.19">know with the geophysical shift in the</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="6.359">pole you know we&amp;#39;re talking about a</text>
  <text start="306.419" dur="8.021">major geological event that then has the</text>
  <text start="311.139" dur="5.28">potential for really disrupting life on</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="4.59">the on the surface of the planet so you</text>
  <text start="316.419" dur="6.451">know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a major event and I</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="6.859">think what has done is identified</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="7.68">historically that this is before and</text>
  <text start="325.889" dur="7.451">also kind of like raised some of the the</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="4.83">mechanisms by which the pole shift can</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="6.66">happen yeah obviously you know the earth</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="6.539">is spinning around an excess and you</text>
  <text start="340" dur="5.61">know the distribution of the Earth&amp;#39;s way</text>
  <text start="341.919" dur="5.101">can influence that that spin and so if</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="4.529">you look at something like Antarctica</text>
  <text start="347.02" dur="5.07">like presently now you know where one</text>
  <text start="350.139" dur="4.831">side of been tired of that he&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="6.96">to DC he&amp;#39;s starting to melt you know the</text>
  <text start="354.97" dur="7.31">West Antarctic region is melting and we</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="6.45">can talk about that later in terms of</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="6.069">volcano suddenly coming active and that</text>
  <text start="365.5" dur="4.949">melting the ice shot from underneath but</text>
  <text start="368.349" dur="4.741">yeah if the end result of that in the</text>
  <text start="370.449" dur="6.361">next five years or so is that the West</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="6.69">Antarctic ice sheets melt</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="5.579">I mean just imagine not only are we</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="4.98">going to look at a a major rise in the</text>
  <text start="382.389" dur="5.061">sea level but also the distribution the</text>
  <text start="384.76" dur="4.89">weight around the South Pole</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="4.21">dramatically alters does the ice</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="4.62">you know those ice sheets but go a</text>
  <text start="391.66" dur="6.3">couple of miles why a lot so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="6.98">that&amp;#39;s all gone on one half of the the</text>
  <text start="397.96" dur="5.37">South Pole then you&amp;#39;ve got a major</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="4.419">realignment of the weight distribution</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="5.18">over the South Pole so that could be</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="5.281">that the triggering for a whole shift</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="5.98">you know I think you know we need to be</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="5.67">concerned about this well I have a lot a</text>
  <text start="414.49" dur="3.66">lot of questions when bringing a</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="3.33">geophysical shift into the picture I</text>
  <text start="418.15" dur="3.269">mean it completely makes sense because</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="4.17">when a top is spinning just the</text>
  <text start="421.419" dur="5.971">slightest weight on it will completely</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="6.24">alter it and also I mean where what was</text>
  <text start="427.39" dur="4.589">the South pulled before and you know</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways we could</text>
  <text start="431.979" dur="2.521">take that but I have a lot of other</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="2.88">questions for you</text>
  <text start="434.5" dur="5.55">tell me about Lake Vostok in the Lake</text>
  <text start="436.54" dur="7.05">Vostok anomaly in Antarctica well like</text>
  <text start="440.05" dur="5.429">Lake Vostok actually is right next to a</text>
  <text start="443.59" dur="4.079">Russian base called Vostok</text>
  <text start="445.479" dur="5.101">which one was at the time the</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="6.691">geomagnetic pole near a be me he was got</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="6.51">the the physical Pole the South Pole</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="4.77">they built a base this commencement nice</text>
  <text start="457.09" dur="5.34">in the morning big these and the</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="5.61">Russians got the geomagnetic pole which</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="4.68">was where they placed the muscle-up base</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="6.51">well it turned out that what&amp;#39;s top base</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="9.09">was right over this huge lake about 250</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="6.45">miles in length the exact width of it</text>
  <text start="476.2" dur="6.98">you know hundred miles or so but a</text>
  <text start="477.7" dur="10.58">really massive lake and in nineteen and</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="9.07">1989-1990 there was some radar mapping</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="6.07">done over the Ross top region and it was</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="6.6">determined finally that there was a an</text>
  <text start="494.35" dur="6.629">actual lake there a big lake 1989 frozen</text>
  <text start="498.85" dur="3.84">under two miles of ice so you know the</text>
  <text start="500.979" dur="4.44">initial reaction of NASA and most</text>
  <text start="502.69" dur="8.11">scientists was fantastic this means that</text>
  <text start="505.419" dur="8.261">we can actually do a test for a future</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="8.489">mission to Europa or to some of the</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="7.469">moons of Jupiter or a second that they</text>
  <text start="519.289" dur="3.42">had water and they have ice and</text>
  <text start="521.149" dur="4.281">underneath that you have flowing water</text>
  <text start="522.709" dur="6.151">we could live that they wanted to use</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="6.52">Lake Vostok as a test for pioneering the</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="5.909">development of these kind of robotic</text>
  <text start="531.95" dur="6.24">probes that NASA would eventually send</text>
  <text start="534.769" dur="7.681">to Europa but what happened the next</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="6.959">year was that further radar mapping</text>
  <text start="542.45" dur="5.579">discovered this huge anomaly about 50</text>
  <text start="545.149" dur="6.241">miles in diameter at one end of Lake</text>
  <text start="548.029" dur="4.05">Vostok and all of a sudden everything</text>
  <text start="551.39" dur="3.96">changed</text>
  <text start="552.079" dur="5.221">now NASA basically said that it was no</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="3.57">longer feasible no Nessa became</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="4.729">environmentalist they said well like we</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="7.169">send robotic probes down like Moscow</text>
  <text start="562.029" dur="6.31">then with lovely little blue the</text>
  <text start="566.089" dur="5.221">pristine environment so you know the</text>
  <text start="568.339" dur="5.521">whole Nessa was saying it would take us</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="9.74">at least a decade before such technology</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="10.59">could be used so basically it was like</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="5.14">make ma stop is now off-limits it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="584.45" dur="5.28">going to be drilled - but what really</text>
  <text start="586.19" dur="6">happened was that a Raytheon Raytheon</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="5.01">Corporation which at the time had the</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="5.28">Antarctic support contract I was</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="5.76">actually sending covert teams down to</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="5.4">the magnetic anomaly to find out what</text>
  <text start="600.5" dur="4.95">was there and and according to Richard</text>
  <text start="602.87" dur="5.82">Hoagland who actually did the original</text>
  <text start="605.45" dur="6.42">research on this back in 1991</text>
  <text start="608.69" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;d been researching an ancient</text>
  <text start="611.87" dur="5.79">ancient see that that magnetic anomaly</text>
  <text start="615.17" dur="4.68">at Lake Vostok was an agency buried</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="4.71">under two miles of ice and that the</text>
  <text start="619.85" dur="5.01">Raytheon employees that were going down</text>
  <text start="622.37" dur="5.339">there was suddenly giving very very sick</text>
  <text start="624.86" dur="5.88">and so for Hoagland this was a sign that</text>
  <text start="627.709" dur="6.87">this magnetic anomaly was probably the</text>
  <text start="630.74" dur="6.719">route some sort of was using torsion</text>
  <text start="634.579" dur="4.741">field technologies which have a kind of</text>
  <text start="637.459" dur="3.961">space-time to collect their displacement</text>
  <text start="639.32" dur="4.259">and if you&amp;#39;re not properly shielded or</text>
  <text start="641.42" dur="4.04">protected against kind of space-time</text>
  <text start="643.579" dur="4.291">distortion</text>
  <text start="645.46" dur="4.57">around any kind of technology you can</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="5.57">get very good see and so that&amp;#39;s what was</text>
  <text start="650.03" dur="6.57">happening to the radium employees and so</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="5.29">long as the one that I need that</text>
  <text start="656.6" dur="3.72">research and and steadily I think when</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="3.69">you look at the magnetic anomaly at Lake</text>
  <text start="660.32" dur="4.71">Vostok it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s a prime</text>
  <text start="662.42" dur="6.75">candidate for a buried Sydney under the</text>
  <text start="665.03" dur="6.57">entire Coast sheets Wow fascinating so</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="3.81">it seems like there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="671.6" dur="3.6">under the ice there I mean not only</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="4.95">potentially ancient civilizations but</text>
  <text start="675.2" dur="4.26">tell me about what else is being found</text>
  <text start="677.93" dur="6.27">down there that&amp;#39;s at least making it</text>
  <text start="679.46" dur="6.72">into mainstream science well the</text>
  <text start="684.2" dur="6.03">mainstream scientists of finding things</text>
  <text start="686.18" dur="6.57">that are really kind of very significant</text>
  <text start="690.23" dur="7.23">in terms of you know what&amp;#39;s driving the</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="9.63">changes in Antartica last year 2017 out</text>
  <text start="697.46" dur="7.14">scientists discovered 91 volcanoes in</text>
  <text start="702.38" dur="4.95">West Antarctica that they hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="704.6" dur="5.46">previously known about so that added to</text>
  <text start="707.33" dur="5.24">the previous I think it was about 45 so</text>
  <text start="710.06" dur="8.01">we all together you know tell me about</text>
  <text start="712.57" dur="10.27">130 140 volcanoes primarily in the West</text>
  <text start="718.07" dur="9.24">Antarctic region that becoming active</text>
  <text start="722.84" dur="5.97">better that they detected then that to</text>
  <text start="727.31" dur="4.05">determine that they now starting to</text>
  <text start="728.81" dur="5.88">become active and as the volcano start</text>
  <text start="731.36" dur="7.89">to become more active they start to melt</text>
  <text start="734.69" dur="8.46">the ice ice sheets from underneath and</text>
  <text start="739.25" dur="7.53">what this does is it creates bars firmly</text>
  <text start="743.15" dur="5.7">heated cabin cylinders and this is</text>
  <text start="746.78" dur="4.02">really significant because it means that</text>
  <text start="748.85" dur="5.3">you know with the with the thermal</text>
  <text start="750.8" dur="5.81">energy is from this vast network of</text>
  <text start="754.15" dur="6.87">volcanoes under the Antarctic ice sheets</text>
  <text start="756.61" dur="8.32">you can have an incredible network of</text>
  <text start="761.02" dur="6.19">tunnels kind of lava tubes all under the</text>
  <text start="764.93" dur="4.29">entire equation sheet and vast cabins</text>
  <text start="767.21" dur="3.63">down there that are all thermally heated</text>
  <text start="769.22" dur="4.08">and this is what the science scientific</text>
  <text start="770.84" dur="6.27">community has been confirming</text>
  <text start="773.3" dur="4.57">very recently 2017 you know they confirm</text>
  <text start="777.11" dur="3.85">the existence</text>
  <text start="777.87" dur="7.409">this incredible number of volcanoes</text>
  <text start="780.96" dur="7.85">which made aunt Annika the the place</text>
  <text start="785.279" dur="7.021">with the most concentrated volcanoes</text>
  <text start="788.81" dur="6.34">system in the in the world previously it</text>
  <text start="792.3" dur="4.65">was that East Africa now aunt article is</text>
  <text start="795.15" dur="4.14">understood to have advanced</text>
  <text start="796.95" dur="5.31">concentration scientists have also</text>
  <text start="799.29" dur="5.13">confirmed that there is a vast cavern</text>
  <text start="802.26" dur="5.91">system down there which is thermally</text>

  <text start="808.17" dur="10.05">to the the McMurdo scientific station</text>

  <text start="827.25" dur="5.97">kind of balmy 25 degrees Celsius so you</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="5.06">know immediately you suggest that you</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="4.59">can actually have life down there</text>
  <text start="835.22" dur="6.01">existing but also it would be a great</text>
  <text start="837.81" dur="6.42">place to build bases and so this thing</text>
  <text start="841.23" dur="6.15">kind of substantiates all of the claims</text>
  <text start="844.23" dur="5.19">of people going back to the early</text>
  <text start="847.38" dur="6">nineteen nineties when Vladimir Gusinsky</text>
  <text start="849.42" dur="6.18">was the first one talking about the</text>
  <text start="853.38" dur="4.5">Germans having established bases under</text>
  <text start="855.6" dur="4.859">entirely well now the recent scientific</text>
  <text start="857.88" dur="4.02">research you know basically makes all</text>
  <text start="860.459" dur="4.021">that feasible because now we know that</text>
  <text start="861.9" dur="6.33">there&amp;#39;s a vast network of cabins down</text>
  <text start="864.48" dur="6.66">there that are thermally Haven and at 25</text>
  <text start="868.23" dur="6.06">degrees Celsius you can actually have a</text>
  <text start="871.14" dur="6.42">lot going on down there so in your</text>
  <text start="874.29" dur="6.15">opinion did the Germans end up creating</text>
  <text start="877.56" dur="6.12">bases and doing a permanent exploration</text>
  <text start="880.44" dur="5.64">down there I believe so yes I mean</text>
  <text start="883.68" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s always been the big mystery in</text>
  <text start="886.08" dur="4.02">terms of well you know exactly what the</text>
  <text start="888.27" dur="4.22">Germans do down there but but we know</text>
  <text start="890.1" dur="5.28">going back to the official documents</text>
  <text start="892.49" dur="6.7">that the Germans did establish bases in</text>
  <text start="895.38" dur="6.72">Antarctica in 1939 Admiral oh sorry</text>
  <text start="899.19" dur="5.85">39 President Roosevelt ordered Admiral</text>
  <text start="902.1" dur="5.82">Byrd to go down me to find the German</text>

  <text start="907.92" dur="3.93">these would violate the Monroe Doctrine</text>
  <text start="910.62" dur="4.98">which basically</text>
  <text start="911.85" dur="6.12">laid out there no European country would</text>

  <text start="917.97" dur="2.489">Hemisphere</text>
  <text start="918.54" dur="3.84">so they considered Western Antarctica as</text>
  <text start="920.459" dur="5.371">part of the Western Hemisphere so sure</text>
  <text start="922.38" dur="5.31">enough I actually had an expedition</text>
  <text start="925.83" dur="5.61">going down there to find the German base</text>
  <text start="927.69" dur="6.089">so 39 the u.s. knew I think the Germans</text>
  <text start="931.44" dur="5.1">were in the process of study at setting</text>
  <text start="933.779" dur="4.62">up bases in Antartica then of course as</text>

  <text start="1018.26" dur="4.949">Coast sheets that&amp;#39;s fascinating that</text>
  <text start="1020.75" dur="3.829">that requires a whole relearning of</text>
  <text start="1023.209" dur="4.261">history that I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1024.579" dur="5.891">will need to do so that brings us up to</text>
  <text start="1027.47" dur="6.119">now if if the Germans were establishing</text>
  <text start="1030.47" dur="6.959">bases in the 1930s and 40s are those</text>
  <text start="1033.589" dur="8.701">bases still existing to this day those</text>
  <text start="1037.429" dur="7.711">basis basically became the room for a</text>
  <text start="1042.29" dur="5.25">German program space program</text>
  <text start="1045.14" dur="4.26">various technologies where they</text>
  <text start="1047.54" dur="5.73">basically started doing overflights of</text>
  <text start="1049.4" dur="5.46">the united states in the 1940s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1053.27" dur="5.19">UFO sightings</text>
  <text start="1054.86" dur="5.79">these were German craft and and you can</text>
  <text start="1058.46" dur="5.07">actually see evidence for this if you</text>
  <text start="1060.65" dur="6.03">look at the original 1947 cannabinoid</text>
  <text start="1063.53" dur="7.83">incident he saw fleets of these kind of</text>
  <text start="1066.68" dur="6.39">like that kind of crap well you know</text>
  <text start="1071.36" dur="4.17">when you look at that craft and then</text>
  <text start="1073.07" dur="5.52">mesh with one of the horton flying wing</text>
  <text start="1075.53" dur="6.21">craft it&amp;#39;s a match it&amp;#39;s pretty close but</text>
  <text start="1078.59" dur="5.13">well the Germans were were flying these</text>
  <text start="1081.74" dur="3.78">things out of Antarctica up over the</text>
  <text start="1083.72" dur="5.67">United States</text>
  <text start="1085.52" dur="6.45">you have also things like the George</text>
  <text start="1089.39" dur="4.17">Adamski Scout craft that he was up</text>
  <text start="1091.97" dur="3.81">photographing well if you compare that</text>
  <text start="1093.56" dur="6.26">to a hullabaloo</text>
  <text start="1095.78" dur="4.04">flying saucer again you have a match</text>
  <text start="1101.29" dur="11.65">there are also contact Dee&amp;#39;s in Hawaii</text>
  <text start="1107.18" dur="11.88">in 1956 there was a sibling year career</text>
  <text start="1112.94" dur="8.52">and soldier Master Sergeant Willard and</text>
  <text start="1119.06" dur="7.17">basically he along with other witnesses</text>
  <text start="1121.46" dur="7.47">saw a flying saucer land in just near</text>
  <text start="1126.23" dur="6.09">Hawaii if just near Honolulu and the</text>
  <text start="1128.93" dur="6.27">people that got out for German uniforms</text>
  <text start="1132.32" dur="6.33">dancing uniforms and and the craft</text>
  <text start="1135.2" dur="6.75">itself had the kind of German I am cross</text>
  <text start="1138.65" dur="4.92">on another 69 in Cygnus signifying that</text>
  <text start="1141.95" dur="4.38">this was a German cross so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1143.57" dur="5.31">of evidence showing that the German</text>
  <text start="1146.33" dur="4.86">program in Antartica survived the Second</text>
  <text start="1148.88" dur="5.16">World War and was doing acne over</text>
  <text start="1151.19" dur="5.39">flights in the 40s and 50s on the United</text>
  <text start="1154.04" dur="4.29">States and a deal deals were done</text>
  <text start="1156.58" dur="4.66">basically agreements were reached</text>
  <text start="1158.33" dur="5.19">whereby the US military industrial</text>
  <text start="1161.24" dur="5.07">complex would work with the German</text>
  <text start="1163.52" dur="5.72">program because each had something that</text>
  <text start="1166.31" dur="7.65">the other lacked the Germans lacked</text>
  <text start="1169.24" dur="6.97">resources and manpower but they had</text>
  <text start="1173.96" dur="4.98">incredible technological know-how about</text>
  <text start="1176.21" dur="5.01">the operations of flying saucer craft</text>
  <text start="1178.94" dur="4.41">they had begun researching in the 1920s</text>
  <text start="1181.22" dur="6.21">on the other hand United States had an</text>
  <text start="1183.35" dur="6.96">abundance of resources and manpower but</text>
  <text start="1187.43" dur="5.13">just lacked mean scientific know-how on</text>
  <text start="1190.31" dur="5.37">on how flying-saucer technologies and</text>
  <text start="1192.56" dur="5.22">how X attritional operated because the</text>
  <text start="1195.68" dur="4.95">US were late starters to this they only</text>
  <text start="1197.78" dur="4.26">began researching the Sun significantly</text>
  <text start="1200.63" dur="3.99">after the Second World War</text>
  <text start="1202.04" dur="5.3">so deals were reached and basically what</text>
  <text start="1204.62" dur="8.03">happened was that the basis in then</text>
  <text start="1207.34" dur="9.64">Atika were significantly expanded into</text>
  <text start="1212.65" dur="8.08">so that they could actually develop very</text>
  <text start="1216.98" dur="7.59">large fleets of spacecraft that would be</text>
  <text start="1220.73" dur="11.36">working as a result with both the German</text>
  <text start="1224.57" dur="9.99">program and to establish a future</text>
  <text start="1232.09" dur="7.93">corporate run space program out of</text>
  <text start="1234.56" dur="8.22">Antarctica Wow well so fascinating I</text>
  <text start="1240.02" dur="6">mean it kind of brings the the full</text>
  <text start="1242.78" dur="5.28">picture around describing how the Nazis</text>
  <text start="1246.02" dur="4.16">actually didn&amp;#39;t necessarily lose the war</text>
  <text start="1248.06" dur="4.76">and and that brings us up you know to</text>
  <text start="1250.18" dur="5.02">understanding our modern history and</text>
  <text start="1252.82" dur="4.81">discuss a little bit about the current</text>
  <text start="1255.2" dur="4.92">situation with this military-industrial</text>
  <text start="1257.63" dur="6.03">complex and what they&amp;#39;re doing in</text>
  <text start="1260.12" dur="5.28">Antarctica now well you know one of the</text>
  <text start="1263.66" dur="5.28">important things to keep in mind is that</text>
  <text start="1265.4" dur="6.3">you know it was German corporations that</text>
  <text start="1268.94" dur="4.68">built the spacecraft for the German</text>
  <text start="1271.7" dur="5.55">space program both in occupied Europe</text>
  <text start="1273.62" dur="5.49">and then in Antarctica and that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1277.25" dur="4.59">historical fact that many of these</text>
  <text start="1279.11" dur="5.7">German companies had worked in the</text>
  <text start="1281.84" dur="7.77">run-up to the Second World War as</text>
  <text start="1284.81" dur="7.08">corporations so that after the war when</text>
  <text start="1289.61" dur="4.86">agreements were reached what you had was</text>
  <text start="1291.89" dur="5.46">a German companies that had done the</text>
  <text start="1294.47" dur="4.89">kind of main work in understanding the</text>
  <text start="1297.35" dur="4.08">scientific principles behind flying</text>
  <text start="1299.36" dur="4.41">saucer technologies the propulsion</text>
  <text start="1301.43" dur="4.02">systems portion physics any gravity in</text>
  <text start="1303.77" dur="3.48">the program it&amp;#39;s all of those things</text>
  <text start="1305.45" dur="5.46">German companies were the leaders in</text>
  <text start="1307.25" dur="5.43">that and that US companies then began to</text>
  <text start="1310.91" dur="3.9">collaborate with the Germans</text>
  <text start="1312.68" dur="6.54">both in Antarctica and in the United</text>
  <text start="1314.81" dur="8.49">States and in places and so this became</text>
  <text start="1319.22" dur="6.75">the basis for a transnational corporate</text>
  <text start="1323.3" dur="4.86">space program that was operating in</text>
  <text start="1325.97" dur="6.6">Antartica so the original German program</text>
  <text start="1328.16" dur="8.13">in Antarctica continue to develop it</text>
  <text start="1332.57" dur="7.4">would basically ask the corporations in</text>
  <text start="1336.29" dur="6.39">Attica for whatever the latest</text>
  <text start="1339.97" dur="5.11">prototypes or models or craft would be</text>
  <text start="1342.68" dur="4.86">you know they don&amp;#39;t basically as in the</text>
  <text start="1345.08" dur="5.1">corporate world they would award</text>
  <text start="1347.54" dur="6.48">contracts some money would be exchanged</text>
  <text start="1350.18" dur="6.78">other craft will be built and so and</text>
  <text start="1354.02" dur="4.83">then and then the German program which</text>
  <text start="1356.96" dur="5.57">goes by a number of names so one of them</text>
  <text start="1358.85" dur="7.62">exactly as Corey Goode has described it</text>
  <text start="1362.53" dur="6.19">but then the the corporate program that</text>
  <text start="1366.47" dur="4.8">was that was a program that was building</text>
  <text start="1368.72" dur="5.91">the craft for the German program in</text>
  <text start="1371.27" dur="6.48">Antartica over the years it basically</text>
  <text start="1374.63" dur="5.85">became its own entity and it became a</text>
  <text start="1377.75" dur="5.49">separate space program so that today out</text>
  <text start="1380.48" dur="10.64">of Antarctica you actually have a</text>
  <text start="1383.24" dur="11.13">program which uses state-of-the-art</text>
  <text start="1391.12" dur="5.53">anti-gravity torsion fuel technologies</text>
  <text start="1394.37" dur="4.01">any matter whatever whatever</text>
  <text start="1396.65" dur="4.56">technologies they&amp;#39;re being able to</text>
  <text start="1398.38" dur="5.47">develop ever since the Second World War</text>
  <text start="1401.21" dur="5.19">for including the performance of flying</text>
  <text start="1403.85" dur="5.07">saucers or these things spacecraft and</text>
  <text start="1406.4" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s all happening in Antarctica and</text>

  <text start="1410.69" dur="5.61">national network of operations and this</text>
  <text start="1414.05" dur="4.26">is what is happening right now under the</text>
  <text start="1416.3" dur="5.04">Antarctic ice sheets and and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1418.31" dur="5.16">important to keep in mind that the</text>
  <text start="1421.34" dur="5.01">Germans very early on</text>
  <text start="1423.47" dur="5.91">basically relied on slave labor that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1426.35" dur="5.52">what the Second World War they use the</text>
  <text start="1429.38" dur="4.38">slave labor because they had acute</text>
  <text start="1431.87" dur="4.32">manpower shortages and the German</text>
  <text start="1433.76" dur="4.44">ideology didn&amp;#39;t believe women should be</text>
  <text start="1436.19" dur="4.05">youth was worthless so no really use the</text>
  <text start="1438.2" dur="4.2">slave labor and they found also that</text>
  <text start="1440.24" dur="5.13">this was a way for them to be able to</text>
  <text start="1442.4" dur="4.54">maintain operations so that continues in</text>
  <text start="1445.37" dur="3.79">Antartica today</text>
  <text start="1446.94" dur="5.64">the slave labor was something that the</text>
  <text start="1449.16" dur="6.51">Germans corporations basically</text>
  <text start="1452.58" dur="5.7">introduced into Antarctica when the US</text>
  <text start="1455.67" dur="5.25">corporations came along they realized</text>
  <text start="1458.28" dur="4.68">that this was the this is how it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1460.92" dur="5.34">in Antarctica so they just kind of went</text>
  <text start="1462.96" dur="7.67">along and I think a lot of the US</text>
  <text start="1466.26" dur="7.56">corporations and out in this really and</text>
  <text start="1470.63" dur="5.38">desirable position of having secretly</text>
  <text start="1473.82" dur="4.83">worked with the German corporations in</text>
  <text start="1476.01" dur="4.59">Antarctica for decades but at the same</text>
  <text start="1478.65" dur="5.25">time having used a lot of slave labor</text>
  <text start="1480.6" dur="6.6">yeah both in the programs but also kind</text>
  <text start="1483.9" dur="6.81">of like human experimentation Wow very</text>
  <text start="1487.2" dur="6.15">very deep dark issue but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1490.71" dur="4.62">logical and it kind of begs the question</text>
  <text start="1493.35" dur="3.63">where where do you think they obtained a</text>
  <text start="1495.33" dur="5.4">lot of these people they&amp;#39;d used for</text>
  <text start="1496.98" dur="6.99">their slave labor well originally in</text>
  <text start="1500.73" dur="8">occupied Europe they had a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1503.97" dur="8.25">that they just that were forcibly</text>
  <text start="1508.73" dur="6.55">relocated into these secret German</text>
  <text start="1512.22" dur="5.4">programs in occupied Europe and many of</text>
  <text start="1515.28" dur="5.61">them were also sent down to Antarctica</text>
  <text start="1517.62" dur="6.75">now since the opening up event article</text>
  <text start="1520.89" dur="5.52">or the really since the US military</text>
  <text start="1524.37" dur="4.55">industrial complex began working with</text>
  <text start="1526.41" dur="6">the Germans down there you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1528.92" dur="5.98">vast numbers of kind of excess human</text>
  <text start="1532.41" dur="4.46">population if we want to have want to</text>
  <text start="1534.9" dur="5.85">describe homeless people in that way</text>
  <text start="1536.87" dur="5.8">that could be used for that can be kind</text>
  <text start="1540.75" dur="2.91">of taken that can be abducted and would</text>
  <text start="1542.67" dur="4.05">even be missed</text>
  <text start="1543.66" dur="4.95">yeah this is the this is something that</text>
  <text start="1546.72" dur="3.6">you know we witness every year that</text>
  <text start="1548.61" dur="4.08">there are several million people</text>
  <text start="1550.32" dur="4.77">children that especially that simply</text>
  <text start="1552.69" dur="4.95">disappear all over the world and most</text>
  <text start="1555.09" dur="3.66">people just don&amp;#39;t know hey second</text>
  <text start="1557.64" dur="3.41">thought oh because you know I mean after</text>
  <text start="1558.75" dur="4.83">all you know there to look at the</text>
  <text start="1561.05" dur="5.86">numbers of street children in places</text>
  <text start="1563.58" dur="7.29">like India Brazil other parts of Asia</text>
  <text start="1566.91" dur="5.97">Africa any people disappear you know no</text>
  <text start="1570.87" dur="5.31">one&amp;#39;s going to pay much attention when</text>
  <text start="1572.88" dur="7.14">it comes to skilled labor you know then</text>
  <text start="1576.18" dur="8.34">that&amp;#39;s something that it&amp;#39;s a little more</text>
  <text start="1580.02" dur="7.5">in getting people but we find also that</text>
  <text start="1584.52" dur="5.37">many people with certain skills that are</text>
  <text start="1587.52" dur="5.51">designed by these corporations in places</text>
  <text start="1589.89" dur="5.7">like Antarctica that they are also</text>
  <text start="1593.03" dur="6.76">recruited and tricked into being part of</text>
  <text start="1595.59" dur="8.73">these programs Wow well that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1599.79" dur="8.4">amazing and that does also lead me to</text>
  <text start="1604.32" dur="6.81">wonder how with this idea of disclosure</text>
  <text start="1608.19" dur="6.66">I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="1611.13" dur="6.09">that we&amp;#39;re waiting to be told and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1614.85" dur="5.61">hoping our elected officials will tell</text>
  <text start="1617.22" dur="5.25">us but there&amp;#39;s also seems to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="1620.46" dur="6.09">affect elected officials who are trying</text>
  <text start="1622.47" dur="5.79">to keep these ideas secretive and many</text>
  <text start="1626.55" dur="3.57">of them have also been traveling down to</text>
  <text start="1628.26" dur="3.72">Antarctica we had John Kerry down there</text>
  <text start="1630.12" dur="4.47">on the day of the election which was</text>
  <text start="1631.98" dur="3.93">very odd and and Newt Gingrich as well</text>
  <text start="1634.59" dur="2.67">so how does how does that fit into</text>
  <text start="1635.91" dur="1.82">things of all the officials going down</text>
  <text start="1637.26" dur="5.73">there</text>
  <text start="1637.73" dur="8.35">well what we have in Antarctica is a</text>
  <text start="1642.99" dur="5.61">place where you have very advanced</text>
  <text start="1646.08" dur="5.01">technologies that are being used by</text>
  <text start="1648.6" dur="5.79">secret space programs that that is run</text>
  <text start="1651.09" dur="5.54">by organizations down there which we</text>
  <text start="1654.39" dur="6.27">might loosely describe them as the Cabal</text>
  <text start="1656.63" dur="5.2">globally whatever term you used to</text>
  <text start="1660.66" dur="2.55">destroy them there are very powerful</text>
  <text start="1661.83" dur="3.99">people that are running these programs</text>
  <text start="1663.21" dur="6.02">in Antartica so I think what happened</text>
  <text start="1665.82" dur="6.27">with John Kerry going there Julie 2016 a</text>
  <text start="1669.23" dur="5.5">presidential election that he had to go</text>
  <text start="1672.09" dur="5.76">down there and basically you know given</text>
  <text start="1674.73" dur="5.48">the bad losers that that their plans to</text>
  <text start="1677.85" dur="7.08">have a Hillary Clinton winning election</text>
  <text start="1680.21" dur="8.32">had failed that the prognosis was that</text>
  <text start="1684.93" dur="8.28">Trump would win and that they had to get</text>
  <text start="1688.53" dur="7.44">ready for this and so subsequently we</text>
  <text start="1693.21" dur="5.25">have Newt Gingrich going down there</text>
  <text start="1695.97" dur="5.76">looking rich is the Emmis was the</text>
  <text start="1698.46" dur="6.57">emissary for Donald Trump he still works</text>
  <text start="1701.73" dur="6.57">quite closely with Donald Trump and he</text>
  <text start="1705.03" dur="4.88">went down there with he&amp;#39;s white I</text>
  <text start="1708.3" dur="5.61">believe it&amp;#39;s Calissa</text>
  <text start="1709.91" dur="5.59">who the company came down to</text>
  <text start="1713.91" dur="3.72">Tonica and he went down there as an</text>
  <text start="1715.5" dur="5.1">emissary to kind of like to give</text>
  <text start="1717.63" dur="5.04">negotiations with the elite down in</text>
  <text start="1720.6" dur="4.2">Antarctica because you know Trump I know</text>
  <text start="1722.67" dur="3.54">people are all over the map when it</text>
  <text start="1724.8" dur="4.47">comes to Trump but the bottom line with</text>
  <text start="1726.21" dur="5.88">Trump is that he&amp;#39;s a businessman he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1729.27" dur="5.19">deal maker you know he he prides himself</text>
  <text start="1732.09" dur="4.77">on being able to make deals with people</text>
  <text start="1734.46" dur="3.96">so he doesn&amp;#39;t really care who you know</text>
  <text start="1736.86" dur="2.88">who he&amp;#39;s going to make a deal we think</text>
  <text start="1738.42" dur="3.6">someone has a lot of power a lot of</text>
  <text start="1739.74" dur="3.42">resources you know the trumpets like</text>
  <text start="1742.02" dur="3.99">okay let&amp;#39;s make a deal</text>
  <text start="1743.16" dur="4.95">so Trump was you know he had been</text>
  <text start="1746.01" dur="4.8">approached let&amp;#39;s make a deal with the</text>
  <text start="1748.11" dur="5.67">people dinner in toca and and so this is</text>
  <text start="1750.81" dur="5.18">something that that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1753.78" dur="4.65">kind of deal with in terms of a</text>
  <text start="1755.99" dur="5.65">president in the United States that they</text>
  <text start="1758.43" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t overtly control but I have to make</text>
  <text start="1761.64" dur="4.26">kills with and this is you know Jordan</text>
  <text start="1763.44" dur="3.69">Mississippi yeah well it might appear</text>
  <text start="1765.9" dur="3.39">subtle it&amp;#39;s a very big difference</text>
  <text start="1767.13" dur="3.75">actually you know because a pub that you</text>
  <text start="1769.29" dur="6.39">can control because you can actually</text>
  <text start="1770.88" dur="7.83">have a control but with someone like</text>
  <text start="1775.68" dur="5.4">Trump who you know wants to make deals</text>
  <text start="1778.71" dur="6.15">and Trump you know the real power behind</text>
  <text start="1781.08" dur="5.22">Trump is the US military they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1784.86" dur="3.72">ones that are really calling the shots</text>
  <text start="1786.3" dur="4.88">behind the scene so you know Trump is a</text>
  <text start="1788.58" dur="7.89">is a figurehead for the US military</text>
  <text start="1791.18" dur="7.15">heels so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a new situation so</text>
  <text start="1796.47" dur="5.19">this is what looking which went down</text>
  <text start="1798.33" dur="6.27">there to convey and it&amp;#39;s also worth</text>
  <text start="1801.66" dur="6.66">pointing out that the Newt Gingrich is</text>
  <text start="1804.6" dur="6.9">why the list that was appointed by</text>
  <text start="1808.32" dur="6.93">Donald Trump as the US ambassador to the</text>
  <text start="1811.5" dur="7.35">Vatican right there you can understand</text>
  <text start="1815.25" dur="6.36">that they an ultimate power couple and</text>
  <text start="1818.85" dur="3.87">they have a lot of influence in terms of</text>
  <text start="1821.61" dur="4.59">you know what&amp;#39;s happening in Antarctica</text>
  <text start="1822.72" dur="5.76">and what&amp;#39;s going to be revealed what do</text>
  <text start="1826.2" dur="4.08">you think kind of deals were made down</text>
  <text start="1828.48" dur="2.64">there when you knew Guzman went down</text>
  <text start="1830.28" dur="5.01">what was the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="1831.12" dur="8.37">looking for well I think you know Trump</text>
  <text start="1835.29" dur="6.66">wants to basically make a deal where</text>
  <text start="1839.49" dur="5.52">with technologies that are down there</text>
  <text start="1841.95" dur="5.64">are eventually released in a way that</text>
  <text start="1845.01" dur="5.399">helps helps his agenda of</text>
  <text start="1847.59" dur="6.18">of basically reindustrialize in United</text>
  <text start="1850.409" dur="5.76">States you know I think you know Trump</text>
  <text start="1853.77" dur="4.769">as a figurehead for the military go the</text>
  <text start="1856.169" dur="3.931">military have their own goals down in</text>
  <text start="1858.539" dur="3.321">their target and they want access to</text>
  <text start="1860.1" dur="4.189">those technologies because the military</text>
  <text start="1861.86" dur="5.799">the US military</text>
  <text start="1864.289" dur="6.551">you know is pervaded by this idea of</text>
  <text start="1867.659" dur="6">full spectrum domination and for the</text>
  <text start="1870.84" dur="6.26">u.s. being the world&amp;#39;s major superpower</text>
  <text start="1873.659" dur="7.14">and the US military wanting to maintain</text>
  <text start="1877.1" dur="6.1">its ascendancy over all other nations it</text>
  <text start="1880.799" dur="4.98">doesn&amp;#39;t what technology is being</text>
  <text start="1883.2" dur="6.56">developed in Antartica that could kind</text>
  <text start="1885.779" dur="6.39">of leapfrog whatever the US military has</text>
  <text start="1889.76" dur="3.909">so they want access to all of the</text>
  <text start="1892.169" dur="2.791">technologies that have been there have</text>
  <text start="1893.669" dur="3.36">been developed in Antartica</text>
  <text start="1894.96" dur="3.78">I want oversight and so they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1897.029" dur="5.341">basically want to regulate the whole</text>
  <text start="1898.74" dur="6.84">thing and so this is where a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1902.37" dur="5.34">deal-making is is being done in terms of</text>
  <text start="1905.58" dur="3.51">like having access to all of the</text>
  <text start="1907.71" dur="4.709">technologies that have been secretly</text>
  <text start="1909.09" dur="5.91">developed in Antartica I&amp;#39;m having the US</text>
  <text start="1912.419" dur="5.161">companies and the general companies and</text>
  <text start="1915" dur="6">multinationals down there and like start</text>
  <text start="1917.58" dur="7.05">working more with the US military also</text>
  <text start="1921" dur="5.309">having a lot of the effects that are</text>
  <text start="1924.63" dur="3.84">down there in Antartica reveal to the</text>
  <text start="1926.309" dur="5.911">public because I think the US military</text>
  <text start="1928.47" dur="6.54">understand that as as these that</text>
  <text start="1932.22" dur="6.059">programs are opened up as they become an</text>
  <text start="1935.01" dur="6.389">open source that the US military is not</text>
  <text start="1938.279" dur="5.941">going to be left behind in terms of the</text>
  <text start="1941.399" dur="7.111">kind of technologies that are simply so</text>
  <text start="1944.22" dur="6.689">I think the military doesn&amp;#39;t want a lot</text>
  <text start="1948.51" dur="5.58">of these technologies to be released</text>
  <text start="1950.909" dur="5.101">because then it&amp;#39;ll enable the United</text>
  <text start="1954.09" dur="4.199">States not only to reindustrialize but</text>
  <text start="1956.01" dur="4.35">also bring Mina or technological</text>
  <text start="1958.289" dur="4.74">revolution where these sorts of things</text>
  <text start="1960.36" dur="5.91">like Washington physics and the biddings</text>
  <text start="1963.029" dur="8.4">kind of holographic healing all of these</text>
  <text start="1966.27" dur="6.6">advanced modalities or health propulsion</text>
  <text start="1971.429" dur="4.771">all of these things are now being</text>
  <text start="1972.87" dur="6.09">developed as open-source in the United</text>
  <text start="1976.2" dur="4.859">States and this will enable us to</text>
  <text start="1978.96" dur="3.63">maintain its superpower</text>
  <text start="1981.059" dur="4.651">that was you know well into the</text>
  <text start="1982.59" dur="5.13">twentieth century it is a very</text>
  <text start="1985.71" dur="3.959">complicated situation that we have at</text>
  <text start="1987.72" dur="3.299">hand and you know a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1989.669" dur="3.421">really have Antarctica in their</text>
  <text start="1991.019" dur="3.66">consciousness so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="1993.09" dur="4.799">crucial to pivotal piece to everything</text>
  <text start="1994.679" dur="5.011">going on so describe to us a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1997.889" dur="5.61">evidence that you&amp;#39;ll be presenting in</text>
  <text start="1999.69" dur="5.609">your upcoming book on Antarctica well</text>
  <text start="2003.499" dur="5.341">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence in</text>
  <text start="2005.299" dur="6.48">terms of recent scientific data that has</text>
  <text start="2008.84" dur="7.439">been released showing things like the</text>
  <text start="2011.779" dur="8.431">correspondence between the volcanoes in</text>
  <text start="2016.279" dur="6.72">Antarctica with the melt rocks from the</text>
  <text start="2020.21" dur="5.159">surface melt off of the ice sheets on</text>
  <text start="2022.999" dur="3.75">the surface of Antarctica so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2025.369" dur="3.69">pretty important as it shows that</text>
  <text start="2026.749" dur="4.231">Antarctica is melted not because of</text>
  <text start="2029.059" dur="4.47">global warming but because of all of</text>
  <text start="2030.98" dur="9.059">this volcanic activity under the ice</text>
  <text start="2033.529" dur="12.48">which has significance in terms of doing</text>
  <text start="2040.039" dur="9.54">a lot of bases down the you know these</text>
  <text start="2046.009" dur="7.711">documents that were that were prevented</text>
  <text start="2049.579" dur="7.83">by gravity sinski that were that were</text>
  <text start="2053.72" dur="5.22">released by the Soviet Union and when</text>
  <text start="2057.409" dur="3.841">you look at those documents they they</text>
  <text start="2058.94" dur="4.32">list some of the generations that were</text>
  <text start="2061.25" dur="4.679">involved in the manufacturing of these</text>
