  <text start="7.919" dur="3.541">money in gold and silver while the</text>
  <text start="9.599" dur="3.801">markets a little stagnant right now and</text>

  <text start="31.869" dur="4.231">coming back on thanks Jordan</text>
  <text start="33.67" dur="4.53">got to be here I always appreciate your</text>
  <text start="36.1" dur="3.86">investment advice your advice on</text>
  <text start="38.2" dur="4.56">precious metals much appreciated</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="3.52">absolutely absolutely great day well</text>
  <text start="42.76" dur="2.939">cool man</text>
  <text start="43.48" dur="4.44">so lately I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of articles</text>
  <text start="45.699" dur="3.93">and news about the fact that gold is</text>
  <text start="47.92" dur="5.099">essentially hitting its peak and when</text>
  <text start="49.629" dur="5.551">you think of a scarce resource something</text>
  <text start="53.019" dur="3.811">that has a finite amount to it I mean</text>
  <text start="55.18" dur="5.07">eventually it is going to reach a point</text>
  <text start="56.83" dur="6.24">where we just can&amp;#39;t mine as much as the</text>
  <text start="60.25" dur="4.049">demand is so what are your thoughts what</text>
  <text start="63.07" dur="4.2">kind of information do you have on</text>
  <text start="64.299" dur="5.25">what&amp;#39;s going on with P gold yeah so Peak</text>
  <text start="67.27" dur="4.139">Gold and a lot of people and they hear</text>
  <text start="69.549" dur="5.07">that phrase they think has gold peaked</text>
  <text start="71.409" dur="6.931">out no people means the miners from all</text>
  <text start="74.619" dur="6.631">over the world China India third-world</text>
  <text start="78.34" dur="5.67">countries Australia they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="81.25" dur="5.1">harder and harder time finding gold the</text>
  <text start="84.01" dur="3.929">price has pulled back it&amp;#39;s the lowest</text>
  <text start="86.35" dur="2.6">the price of gold is lowest it&amp;#39;s been in</text>
  <text start="87.939" dur="5.161">six years</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="6.46">silver is also well at or below mining</text>
  <text start="93.1" dur="5.07">costs at this point to even pull it out</text>
  <text start="95.41" dur="4.41">of the ground so you&amp;#39;ve had mining</text>
  <text start="98.17" dur="3.69">production if you if you go to the World</text>
  <text start="99.82" dur="4.29">Gold Council they talk about mining</text>
  <text start="101.86" dur="4.05">production and Maya production has just</text>
  <text start="104.11" dur="5.13">been dwindling and dwindling so you have</text>
  <text start="105.91" dur="5.4">less miners looking for gold and some of</text>
  <text start="109.24" dur="4.53">the major countries like Australia are</text>
  <text start="111.31" dur="5.49">saying it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to</text>
  <text start="113.77" dur="5.19">find it and so that really creates an</text>
  <text start="116.8" dur="5.1">opportunity for people that are looking</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="6.33">at long term investments because this is</text>
  <text start="121.9" dur="6.06">the time to get in unfortunately if you</text>
  <text start="125.29" dur="5.43">look at statistics of gold buying for</text>
  <text start="127.96" dur="5.34">retail buyers they typically will buy</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="4.62">what it&amp;#39;s gone going up dramatically or</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="7.35">it&amp;#39;s already gone up pretty</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="9.63">precipitously a good example was in 2011</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="5.79">they sold more silver eagles in one year</text>
  <text start="144.97" dur="2.189">than they sold in the two years before</text>
  <text start="146.44" dur="3.859">that</text>
  <text start="147.159" dur="8.19">yet silver was at its highest point so</text>
  <text start="150.299" dur="6.61">this idea of Peak Gold is a way for</text>
  <text start="155.349" dur="3.451">people to kind of understand that</text>
  <text start="156.909" dur="4.441">they&amp;#39;re having a hard fun pulling it out</text>
  <text start="158.8" dur="3.75">of the ground and it may be a good time</text>
  <text start="161.35" dur="3.18">to diverse</text>
  <text start="162.55" dur="4.29">because the price is is pretty low right</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="4.29">now right we want to capitalize before</text>
  <text start="166.84" dur="3.51">the increase happens not halfway through</text>
  <text start="168.82" dur="3.57">then you can only make half with half</text>
  <text start="170.35" dur="4.68">the return exactly and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="5.49">unfortunately what happens there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="5.34">bull and bear mentality in every market</text>
  <text start="177.88" dur="4.98">stock market precious metals commodities</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="5.34">and a lot of people unfortunately are</text>
  <text start="182.86" dur="5.25">too late into investing and they miss an</text>
  <text start="185.71" dur="4.32">opportunity and so you know that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="188.11" dur="4.32">when you see these statistics come out</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="4.38">and you know gold isn&amp;#39;t just used for</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="4.92">jewelry it&amp;#39;s not just used for an</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="4.59">investment you know it&amp;#39;s not just used</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="4.38">as a currency in a lot of places people</text>
  <text start="199" dur="5.85">deem it as a currency but it&amp;#39;s also used</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="4.65">in a lot of medical devices those uses</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="4.77">continue to grow it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="5.88">conduit and so there&amp;#39;s a lot of just</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="5.07">industrial needs for gold and so when</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="4.47">the ability to find it gets harder and</text>
  <text start="214.69" dur="4.17">harder they use it in iPhones also and</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="4.32">you know cell phones so there is a</text>
  <text start="218.86" dur="5.22">physical need beyond just you and I</text>
  <text start="221.05" dur="5.16">buying coins bars that will never go</text>
  <text start="224.08" dur="3.93">away and that&amp;#39;s gonna also continue to</text>
  <text start="226.21" dur="3.48">help the price and push the price up</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="3.81">over time and is that the same with</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="4.5">silver to actually being useful as a</text>
  <text start="231.82" dur="3.57">resource absolutely a silver tremendous</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="5.79">uses yes</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="7.68">cell phones solar panels all pretty much</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="6.69">all colloidal silver even yeah</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="6.57">everything in in solar energy green</text>
  <text start="246.67" dur="4.2">energy they use you know we I think we</text>
  <text start="249.64" dur="2.94">talked a few months ago about how</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="4.44">California passed a law or they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="252.58" dur="8.73">require everybody to have solar panels</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="8.28">by 2020 or 2022 continued to go up but</text>
  <text start="261.31" dur="5.27">when you look at the prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="6">still at such a low point silvers</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="5.23">unbelievably low so I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.59" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s a pretty big opportunity for for</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="5.28">someone that&amp;#39;s looking if you like to</text>
  <text start="273.79" dur="5.1">buy low I think the opportunity could</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="3.66">could be there and that&amp;#39;s good to know</text>
  <text start="278.89" dur="3.3">that there&amp;#39;s actually uses for gold and</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="3.87">silver because of course we have these</text>
  <text start="282.19" dur="4.62">paper Federal Reserve notes that we</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="3.87">can&amp;#39;t do anything with but you know</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="4.32">maybe wipe our butts or blow our nose</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="5.58">into so yeah gold and silver being</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="5.07">useful that means years from now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="2.58">still gonna have a high return it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="3.059">still going</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="4.59">be something people are looking for yeah</text>
  <text start="299.259" dur="4.201">absolutely and I think Fiat money is</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="4.709">becoming less and less desirable I mean</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="4.709">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really why the crypto</text>
  <text start="305.949" dur="3.961">currency market came about as people</text>
  <text start="308.169" dur="4.201">want to move away from currencies that</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="4.229">are tied into the bank&amp;#39;s they want to</text>
  <text start="312.37" dur="3.87">get away from you know things that the</text>
  <text start="314.139" dur="4.321">Federal Reserve and you know they want</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="4.26">to have control of their assets and you</text>
  <text start="318.46" dur="4.53">know obviously I think the more you can</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="4.289">control your money the better the more</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="4.019">in control of your assets the better so</text>
  <text start="324.789" dur="3.811">whether you&amp;#39;re looking at doing this in</text>
  <text start="327.009" dur="4.231">an IRA or just getting some gold and</text>
  <text start="328.6" dur="5.22">silver at your home I think both things</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="4.86">right now are important because the</text>
  <text start="333.82" dur="3.599">banks are getting stronger and you</text>
  <text start="336.1" dur="3.36">really just got to make sure that you</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="3.87">protect yourself right and I think a few</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="3.69">months ago we also discussed I mean this</text>
  <text start="341.289" dur="4.171">is something that&amp;#39;s kind of been on the</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="3.75">back burner but still there is the fact</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="4.62">that we have legislation going through</text>
  <text start="346.9" dur="5.28">to potentially put us back onto a gold</text>
  <text start="350.08" dur="5.04">standard was some sort of asset backed</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="4.65">currency so if we&amp;#39;re looking now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.12" dur="3.81">saying okay the price of gold and silver</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="4.05">really low they&amp;#39;re definitely gonna be</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="3.81">useful in future years because we even</text>
  <text start="360.88" dur="3.48">have legislation being passed through</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="4.049">for instance California saying okay</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to use precious metals</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="5.551">and the fact that our whole currency</text>
  <text start="369.61" dur="4.89">system could be metal back soon sounds</text>
  <text start="372.34" dur="3.81">like a good idea to get in most states</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="3.06">if you go to our website at noble gold</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="3.66">investments we have a number of articles</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="4.71">most states that are forward thinking</text>
  <text start="379.81" dur="5.13">have laws where you can actually pay off</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="5.49">taxes or pay off tickets</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="4.59">with gold and silver in a lot of states</text>
  <text start="387.76" dur="5.1">Arizona a lot of these forward-thinking</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="5.699">states are allowing people to use other</text>
  <text start="392.86" dur="5.339">currencies to pay off debts with the</text>
  <text start="395.229" dur="5.101">state so I think as a state it makes</text>
  <text start="398.199" dur="4.021">sense they&amp;#39;d rather get gold and silver</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="4.5">than paper money that&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="402.22" dur="5.04">continue to lose value so from a state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="404.83" dur="4.589">point of view it makes a lot of sense to</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="3.6">get these assets they put it in their</text>
  <text start="409.419" dur="4.231">coffers and then they have something</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s going to go up over time and so I</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="5.009">think you&amp;#39;re gonna see people using</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="5.13">instruments outside of the dollar more</text>
  <text start="418.659" dur="4.471">and more to trade and martyr with good</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="4.319">so you think that these precious metals</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="3.48">gold and silver are good safe havens I</text>
  <text start="425.469" dur="4.95">just saw an article this morning about</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="6.239">it being a very safe asset to invest in</text>
  <text start="430.419" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a when you look at gold</text>
  <text start="432.849" dur="3.271">and silver as investment you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="434.379" dur="4.22">at something that you know obviously</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="5.19">Gold&amp;#39;s been traded for 5000 years</text>
  <text start="438.599" dur="4.78">Silver&amp;#39;s been traded and used for</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="5.37">thousands of years and it&amp;#39;s just a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.379" dur="5.76">a perfect bartering instrument when you</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="4.739">look at different instruments for</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="3.78">trading and bartering you know all fiat</text>
  <text start="451.419" dur="4.441">money can just be printed out of thin</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="5.041">air the amount of gold that can grow and</text>
  <text start="455.86" dur="6.14">any year based on the mining is less</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="6.78">than 1% so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s the perfect</text>
  <text start="462" dur="5.169">money if you think about it you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="4.829">want your money to grow more than that</text>
  <text start="467.169" dur="5.101">and that that&amp;#39;s something that holds its</text>
  <text start="469.569" dur="5.041">value and that&amp;#39;s the real issue I mean</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="5.1">people today if they don&amp;#39;t look at the</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="4.41">the micro inflation that they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="3.81">on a day to day basis they don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="4.919">that that&amp;#39;s happening and the cost of</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="5.31">every good is just going up and up but</text>
  <text start="483.939" dur="5.461">there&amp;#39;s young dollars been devalued what</text>
  <text start="486.49" dur="5.519">99 percent since 1913 and I even</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="4.739">remember you know me being young 10-15</text>
  <text start="492.009" dur="4.65">years ago a gallon of gas was a dollar</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="4.2">dollar 50 now it&amp;#39;s full bucks yeah</text>
  <text start="496.659" dur="4.23">absolutely and that that&amp;#39;s not gonna go</text>
  <text start="498.339" dur="4.2">anywhere any anytime soon so you know</text>
  <text start="500.889" dur="4.351">those are things that people forget</text>
  <text start="502.539" dur="4.41">about so if they look at they compare</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="4.32">the dollar they comparable the gold is</text>
  <text start="506.949" dur="5.101">obviously performed very well and he and</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s still you know Gold&amp;#39;s about 60%</text>
  <text start="512.05" dur="5.94">lower than where it was in 2011 and and</text>
  <text start="514.539" dur="5.91">Silver&amp;#39;s uh 73 or 74 percent lower than</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="5.64">where it was in 2011 so it&amp;#39;s still it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.449" dur="5.311">at a at a bottom of the valley in terms</text>
  <text start="523.63" dur="3.72">of prices right now and so you know</text>
  <text start="525.76" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s a lot of good factors out there</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="3.33">for for people that are looking to scoot</text>
  <text start="529.06" dur="3.63">some scoops and gold and silver up</text>
  <text start="530.68" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s from good prices totally sounds</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="4.86">like it sounds like it&amp;#39;s a very good</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="5.58">time to to get in to that and quick</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="3.99">questions shifting topics a little bit I</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="5.28">want to talk about censorship I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="5.52">you had some dealings with that yeah I</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="4.71">could relate very much to being censored</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="3.839">dealing with you know big big</text>
  <text start="549.37" dur="3.63">corporations trying to hold you down so</text>
  <text start="550.899" dur="5.851">tell us about that yeah so we we have</text>
  <text start="553" dur="5.99">our silver commemorative coin the Trump</text>
  <text start="556.75" dur="5.339">freedom coin that were selling and and</text>
  <text start="558.99" dur="3.76">you know we had a bank basically that</text>
  <text start="562.089" dur="2.821">you know we</text>
  <text start="562.75" dur="3.99">number of banks as a precious metals</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="4.77">dealer you have to be spread out because</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re not in the mainstream in terms of</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="4.29">business we&amp;#39;re not selling bonds and</text>
  <text start="571.54" dur="5.31">stocks and you know when you&amp;#39;re in a in</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="4.92">a field that isn&amp;#39;t in the norm in an</text>
  <text start="576.85" dur="4.08">alternative asset you can get some</text>
  <text start="578.89" dur="4.29">backlash so we weren&amp;#39;t prepared for this</text>
  <text start="580.93" dur="4.62">I would say we were a little shocked</text>
  <text start="583.18" dur="4.59">when our account was completely frozen</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="5.12">and it was the account that we were</text>
  <text start="587.77" dur="5.88">selling the Trump points out of and</text>
  <text start="590.67" dur="5.74">basically the account was frozen they</text>
  <text start="593.65" dur="4.5">wouldn&amp;#39;t give her funds back nor give us</text>
  <text start="596.41" dur="6.3">any kind of explanation of why I was</text>
  <text start="598.15" dur="6.03">frozen and last week Friday we finally</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="4.14">got confirmation that we can we can</text>
  <text start="604.18" dur="4.62">finally move the account they gave us no</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="3.51">reason why the only thing I can think of</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="3.78">you know Charles and I can think of is</text>
  <text start="610.36" dur="4.68">that they&amp;#39;re not a fan of this</text>
  <text start="612.58" dur="3.78">administration because literally there</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="3.18">was nothing else that we were doing</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="5.49">within this account except selling these</text>
  <text start="618.22" dur="5.58">the beautiful Trump coins and so you</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="3.21">know it&amp;#39;s just the only reason I met a</text>
  <text start="623.8" dur="4.14">lot of people that don&amp;#39;t go out and</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="5.49">mention this but I think people need to</text>
  <text start="627.94" dur="5.399">know that you can&amp;#39;t be comfortable with</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="5.91">having one bank and you also have to</text>
  <text start="633.339" dur="4.591">look at what you&amp;#39;re signing when the one</text>
  <text start="636.46" dur="3">I spoke to representative ank they said</text>
  <text start="637.93" dur="3.09">that they can hold the money without</text>
  <text start="639.46" dur="3.84">cause and they can close the account</text>
  <text start="641.02" dur="3.87">without cause which i think is is</text>
  <text start="643.3" dur="3.93">something that&amp;#39;s amazing when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="3.72">looking at a private institution and</text>
  <text start="647.23" dur="4.02">basically they&amp;#39;re putting their</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="5.01">political beliefs before their their</text>
  <text start="651.25" dur="4.53">clients and their business and so and</text>
  <text start="653.62" dur="3.51">this is not a small Bank this is one of</text>
  <text start="655.78" dur="4.5">the biggest this is a bank that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="6.03">in business for 150 plus years billions</text>
  <text start="660.28" dur="4.77">of dollars in assets and you know</text>
  <text start="663.16" dur="4.8">basically just didn&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="665.05" dur="4.17">business with a chunk coin and and how</text>
  <text start="667.96" dur="5.01">long have you been selling these for</text>
  <text start="669.22" dur="6.119">because they&amp;#39;re new yeah I think a</text>
  <text start="672.97" dur="4.619">little less in two months maybe I mean</text>
  <text start="675.339" dur="4.141">it&amp;#39;s been that long it&amp;#39;s very quick</text>
  <text start="677.589" dur="4.891">there&amp;#39;s a class you got there</text>
  <text start="679.48" dur="5.1">yeah I have to quick laughing quickly uh</text>
  <text start="682.48" dur="4.08">you know with us we&amp;#39;re always prepared</text>
  <text start="684.58" dur="4.05">for anything because we were in the</text>
  <text start="686.56" dur="4.35">prepare that being prepared business so</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="4.74">I think that it didn&amp;#39;t stop anything</text>
  <text start="690.91" dur="3.78">coins or shipped nothing&amp;#39;s changed but</text>
  <text start="693.37" dur="3.04">you know it is one of those things you</text>
  <text start="694.69" dur="4.569">have to factor and</text>
  <text start="696.41" dur="4.71">and you know it&amp;#39;s a hundred percent it</text>
  <text start="699.259" dur="3.33">happens I&amp;#39;ve had other business owners</text>
  <text start="701.12" dur="3.75">that I&amp;#39;ve talked to that have had</text>
  <text start="702.589" dur="5.071">similar things happen that do sell</text>
  <text start="704.87" dur="5.73">conservative products that are you know</text>
  <text start="707.66" dur="5.01">on the dealing with you know have a</text>
  <text start="710.6" dur="4.2">certain you know obviously we we support</text>
  <text start="712.67" dur="4.26">romp and you know we have that we have</text>
  <text start="714.8" dur="3.87">that out there and so you know this is</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="2.94">something that can happen when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="718.67" dur="3.87">when you&amp;#39;re doing this kind of business</text>
  <text start="719.87" dur="4.86">and so you know just basically telling</text>
  <text start="722.54" dur="4.049">people be prepared read the contracts</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="3.539">and make sure that you know you have</text>
  <text start="726.589" dur="4.17">your fun spread out and and this is</text>
  <text start="728.269" dur="4.86">exactly why we have a lot of our assets</text>
  <text start="730.759" dur="3.861">and precious metals because then then we</text>
  <text start="733.129" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about the banks</text>
  <text start="734.62" dur="7.06">totally and I mean I can I can relate in</text>
  <text start="738.529" dur="5.49">the aspect of getting no reason or very</text>
  <text start="741.68" dur="4.32">vague reasons as why your your account</text>
  <text start="744.019" dur="3.841">sort of the cases are cut I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="746" dur="4.86">dealing with big tech of course you know</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="4.529">YouTube Twitter Facebook etc and every</text>
  <text start="750.86" dur="3.99">reason they gave me it was basically an</text>
  <text start="752.389" dur="5.341">on reason right big wording that oh</text>
  <text start="754.85" dur="4.289">we&amp;#39;re gonna be able to shut down your</text>
  <text start="757.73" dur="3.69">account because of our Terms of Service</text>
  <text start="759.139" dur="4.411">and we can say whatever we want</text>
  <text start="761.42" dur="6.899">basically do it without without due</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="7.11">cause so to hear you guys being hit hard</text>
  <text start="768.319" dur="3.69">for your political affiliations cuz</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="2.549">that&amp;#39;s the only like you said it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="772.009" dur="3.871">only thing that you can really boil it</text>
  <text start="773.209" dur="5.011">down to is the fact that you guys were</text>
  <text start="775.88" dur="4.62">getting hit just because of your beliefs</text>
  <text start="778.22" dur="4.109">yeah it&amp;#39;s not what we&amp;#39;re really coming</text>
  <text start="780.5" dur="3.449">to is that we&amp;#39;re coming to you and I</text>
  <text start="782.329" dur="4.531">know you&amp;#39;ve gone through this a lot and</text>
  <text start="783.949" dur="6.81">I know that you know you basically it</text>
  <text start="786.86" dur="5.55">just it makes you even more resolute in</text>
  <text start="790.759" dur="3.091">what you&amp;#39;re doing you know that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="792.41" dur="3.479">Charles and I came to and I&amp;#39;m sure for</text>
  <text start="793.85" dur="3.69">you and I&amp;#39;ve I watched all of your</text>
  <text start="795.889" dur="3.211">videos and you know I see sometimes</text>
  <text start="797.54" dur="3.57">after you get shut down and you say you</text>
  <text start="799.1" dur="3.75">know you kind of have this look at like</text>
  <text start="801.11" dur="3.57">listen it&amp;#39;s you know this is gonna</text>
  <text start="802.85" dur="3.33">happen and you can smile</text>
  <text start="804.68" dur="4.11">you kind of just smile on the inside</text>
  <text start="806.18" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re like happy yeah yeah so you</text>
  <text start="808.79" dur="4.169">obviously know that you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="810.05" dur="5.37">something that you know people are</text>
  <text start="812.959" dur="4.951">interested in they&amp;#39;re obviously a lot of</text>
  <text start="815.42" dur="4.889">people are watching you and and you know</text>
  <text start="817.91" dur="4.229">they&amp;#39;re trying to make sure that they</text>
  <text start="820.309" dur="4.5">can stifle some of your beliefs which is</text>
  <text start="822.139" dur="6.151">against the whole reason that we created</text>
  <text start="824.809" dur="5.341">this country you know and really part of</text>
  <text start="828.29" dur="4.04">the reason that we</text>
  <text start="830.15" dur="4.59">put this coin out there was because</text>
  <text start="832.33" dur="4.09">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="834.74" dur="3.66">that they can just kind of express their</text>
  <text start="836.42" dur="3.03">political beliefs and we&amp;#39;ve had I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="838.4" dur="3.33">know if I mentioned this too but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="839.45" dur="4.41">had so many people say when they buy the</text>
  <text start="841.73" dur="3.27">coin like don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t tell my neighbor</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="3.78">or make sure it&amp;#39;s in a nondescript</text>
  <text start="845" dur="3.96">package and obviously it obviously is</text>
  <text start="847.64" dur="2.94">and a nondescript package someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.96" dur="2.85">going to know what you&amp;#39;re receiving but</text>
  <text start="850.58" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;d be surprised how many people</text>
  <text start="851.81" dur="4.92">especially like in California have been</text>
  <text start="854.54" dur="3.66">you know telling us in the nodes like</text>
  <text start="856.73" dur="4.17">you know I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know</text>
  <text start="858.2" dur="4.59">what this is and it&amp;#39;s because they they</text>
  <text start="860.9" dur="3.95">don&amp;#39;t feel like they can express their</text>
  <text start="862.79" dur="4.98">political beliefs and that is so sad</text>
  <text start="864.85" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just even the mail people are</text>
  <text start="867.77" dur="3.93">getting yeah they&amp;#39;re scared they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="870.29" dur="4.08">scared to share what they really feel</text>
  <text start="871.7" dur="6.27">and and support inside and and it just</text>
  <text start="874.37" dur="6.18">makes us more embolden and in terms of</text>
  <text start="877.97" dur="3.99">what we&amp;#39;ve done and I think that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="3.51">great people are gonna get them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.96" dur="3.3">giving them the gifts for Christmas and</text>

  <text start="888.08" dur="4.62">on the coin you know the economy is</text>
  <text start="889.88" dur="5.61">roaring like it&amp;#39;s that reward before the</text>
