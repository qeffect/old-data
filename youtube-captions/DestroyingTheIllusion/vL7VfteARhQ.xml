  <text start="3.629" dur="3.42">because there&amp;#39;s a lot more interactive</text>
  <text start="5.069" dur="4.291">and quite frankly I didn&amp;#39;t feel like</text>
  <text start="7.049" dur="5.071">taking the time to edit a video together</text>

  <text start="22.98" dur="4.799">want to discuss so I&amp;#39;ll update you on</text>
  <text start="25.68" dur="3.9">some my projects really quickly first of</text>
  <text start="27.779" dur="4.17">all I want to talk about this channel</text>
  <text start="29.58" dur="3.9">destroying the illusion I&amp;#39;m happy with</text>
  <text start="31.949" dur="3.211">it getting into a groove doing the</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="3.36">videos got some what some of my live</text>
  <text start="35.16" dur="3.899">streams some of the videos that I edit</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="5.28">up a lot of you guys are liking the</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="4.32">chalk talk I saw somebody comment on one</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="4.29">of my videos calling it that the chalk</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="4.651">talk with the chalkboard once I get back</text>
  <text start="46.41" dur="4.559">home I&amp;#39;ll get back into doing those</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="5.31">videos and that&amp;#39;s good it&amp;#39;s all good on</text>
  <text start="50.969" dur="5.281">this channel one thing though I just got</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="5.219">an email from YouTube today so they made</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="4.05">my video that I did yesterday private</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="3.961">getting a lot of messages from people</text>
  <text start="60.3" dur="3.48">telling me that they can&amp;#39;t watch it</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="2.999">some people were telling me they were</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="4.32">literally in the middle of the video and</text>
  <text start="65.519" dur="6.121">it just cut and the reason being is</text>
  <text start="68.1" dur="7.65">because well I said the whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="7.979">named whistleblower he who we must not</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="7.979">name huh so yeah I got a little flack</text>
  <text start="79.619" dur="6.091">from YouTube for that learn my lesson so</text>
  <text start="83.729" dur="3.631">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s not available right now</text>
  <text start="85.71" dur="3.72">you know and it&amp;#39;s funny because what</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="4.86">YouTube did is they made the video</text>
  <text start="89.43" dur="4.32">private and I have 0 option to make it</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="5.28">public so it&amp;#39;s basically a private video</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="5.07">that I can&amp;#39;t do anything with and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="3.119">happened to a lot of people a lot of</text>
  <text start="98.82" dur="5.03">people have had their videos made</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="6.091">private because they said the guy&amp;#39;s name</text>
  <text start="103.85" dur="4.629">it&amp;#39;s a public name it&amp;#39;s not illegal to</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="5.729">do so but apparently YouTube doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.1">like it and they aren&amp;#39;t you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="3.451">interesting to me is they aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="4.741">striking the videos they&amp;#39;re not taking</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="5.339">them down and knocking people&amp;#39;s accounts</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="6.6">for it they&amp;#39;re just making the videos</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="7.291">private and reason being is because it</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="6.089">is legal to do so and say his name and</text>
  <text start="128.52" dur="3.6">if they were to give people strikes well</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="2.611">then of course that would just turn into</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="2.52">a big shit show and</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="3.63">sure they would catch a bunch of heat</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="3.9">for that so too you know skirt around</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="2.37">it&amp;#39;s like a little loophole where</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re just making the videos private</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="4.229">instead of public but anyway you can go</text>
  <text start="141.78" dur="3.989">find that video on bit shoot I&amp;#39;ll link</text>
  <text start="143.849" dur="4.621">my bit shoot down below after we&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="145.769" dur="4.381">here and make sure you go subscribe</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="2.849">there if you have a bit shoot account if</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="2.85">you don&amp;#39;t have a bit shoot account I</text>
  <text start="151.319" dur="3.601">would highly suggest you get one because</text>
  <text start="153" dur="4.68">what might be coming down the pipeline</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="5.94">in regards to censorship on all these</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.21">big tech platforms doesn&amp;#39;t sound like</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="4.849">fun and it does sound like they might be</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="4.27">ramping up a censorship here in a bit so</text>

  <text start="433.53" dur="4.77">this impeachment nonsense and also the</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="4.26">IG report so I saw today that Donald</text>
  <text start="438.3" dur="5.07">Trump was saying that he wants this</text>
  <text start="440.01" dur="5.52">impeachment trial to go to the Senate go</text>
  <text start="443.37" dur="4.62">to the Senate and he&amp;#39;s actually wanting</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="3.99">that he&amp;#39;s like openly saying let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="3.51">get this thing moving in the Senate man</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="3.84">screw the house screw all the idiots</text>

  <text start="453.36" dur="3.12">house let&amp;#39;s just move it right onto the</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="4.59">Senate and that&amp;#39;s why Q&amp;#39;s saying the</text>
  <text start="456.48" dur="4.86">Senate is the target maybe they had this</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="3.84">thing playing the whole time that the</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="3.18">impeachment hearings would end up moving</text>
  <text start="463.08" dur="3.03">to the Senate because if these</text>
  <text start="464.52" dur="2.94">impeachment trials do get going in the</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="3.72">Senate guess what</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="4.29">well we have much more good guy control</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="3.96">in the Senate then there is in the house</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="4.169">and if the impeachment trials do get in</text>
  <text start="473.79" dur="5.72">into this in it guess who&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="7.25">called to testify probably the Biden&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.51" dur="6.159">probably mr. he who we do not name and</text>
  <text start="483.169" dur="4.691">other individuals as well we&amp;#39;d find out</text>
  <text start="485.669" dur="4.291">a lot more there wouldn&amp;#39;t we and it</text>
