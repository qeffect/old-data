  <text start="237.97" dur="7.889">me and we got to talking about things</text>
  <text start="241.659" dur="6.57">going on she asked me who what I did for</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="4.71">a living and I made up some vague sort</text>
  <text start="248.229" dur="4.59">of answer and I think I mentioned media</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="4.85">to her something like alternative Meteor</text>
  <text start="252.819" dur="5.76">whatnot but we got into talking about</text>
  <text start="255.419" dur="6.701">media mainstream media and then the</text>
  <text start="258.579" dur="6.09">conversation quickly got into you know</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="4.4">the deep state all aspects of that the</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="4.301">the rogue intelligence community</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="5.82">I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure where she worked</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="5.199">but it was some sort of government job</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="6.299">or her job had to do with government</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="7.831">here in DC and she had a very strong</text>
  <text start="278.639" dur="5.221">opinion of things going on now she told</text>
  <text start="282" dur="3.69">me that she didn&amp;#39;t particularly believe</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="3.51">in like a deep state she knew there was</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="3.659">corruption at high levels but she was</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="3.84">like I just don&amp;#39;t believe in a deep</text>
  <text start="289.349" dur="5.761">state blah blah we brought I brought up</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="6.66">Q and she scoffed at it she&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="5.64">nice lady but I just think that uh you</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="8.76">know like I said that ego of DC that DC</text>
  <text start="300.75" dur="8.159">ego really ego in all sectors all</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="3.75">industries like that not just within</text>
  <text start="308.909" dur="4.23">government in the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="310.38" dur="5.43">but we can talk you know the medical</text>
  <text start="313.139" dur="6.721">community all these sorts of areas you</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="6.3">know they always try to make the doctors</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="5.07">make the professionals make the</text>
  <text start="322.11" dur="4.29">authorities think that because they have</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="3.12">the position they&amp;#39;re in there working</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="6.509">where they&amp;#39;re in or whatever the case</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="6.27">that they know everything right and this</text>
  <text start="332.909" dur="3">lady I was talking to yesterday she was</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="4.5">thinking yeah because I you know work in</text>
  <text start="335.909" dur="5.491">government I&amp;#39;ve been around these these</text>
  <text start="338.82" dur="4.409">groups or bureaucracies that I know for</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="4.59">a fact that know deep state exists or</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="5.461">doesn&amp;#39;t go that deep and I think she</text>
  <text start="345.99" dur="5.04">mentioned that she inferred that she</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="3.599">thought Q was like this one person</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="3.27">scrolling around the internet for all</text>
  <text start="352.289" dur="5.211">these connectionism and I just you know</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.22">I didn&amp;#39;t go into Q with her she was a</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="5.289">horse that didn&amp;#39;t want to drink the</text>
  <text start="359.52" dur="5.31">water you know so no use trying to</text>

  <text start="364.83" dur="5.01">really gonna go anywhere but it was good</text>
  <text start="367.02" dur="5.85">hopefully I planted some seeds in her in</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="5.94">her consciousness and made her think</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="4.949">about a few things she probably thought</text>
  <text start="375.78" dur="9.629">I was a little crazy but mmm who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="652.02" dur="4.65">are waking up at an exponential rate</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="3.91">it&amp;#39;s getting you know they truly are</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="3.6">most definitely we can see it everywhere</text>
  <text start="658.32" dur="4.05">that we&amp;#39;re at people are waking up but</text>
  <text start="660.27" dur="4.02">at the same time you have experiences in</text>

  <text start="692.49" dur="5.039">the DC bubble that&amp;#39;s what I was noticing</text>
  <text start="694.11" dur="5.069">over the last day this DC bubble people</text>
  <text start="697.529" dur="4.05">in DC they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t get out much</text>
  <text start="699.179" dur="3.75">I don&amp;#39;t think they do and they all look</text>
  <text start="701.579" dur="3.12">unhappy because of it</text>
  <text start="702.929" dur="4.46">honestly the nicest people that I&amp;#39;ve met</text>
  <text start="704.699" dur="4.95">here in DC have been the uber drivers</text>
  <text start="707.389" dur="4.841">and I&amp;#39;m like talking to him and stuff</text>
  <text start="709.649" dur="4.081">trying to make conversation and they</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="4.409">finally like get a smile on their face</text>
  <text start="713.73" dur="4.68">because probably and I&amp;#39;m like the only</text>
  <text start="716.639" dur="2.79">passenger they&amp;#39;ve had today that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="718.41" dur="5.399">talk to them and try to make</text>
  <text start="719.429" dur="6.21">conversation right they start conversing</text>
  <text start="723.809" dur="4.62">back and all the Oberer drivers I&amp;#39;ve met</text>
  <text start="725.639" dur="4.98">are from DC they&amp;#39;re from outside like</text>
  <text start="728.429" dur="4.25">Maryland or Virginia or surrounding</text>
  <text start="730.619" dur="4.621">areas and they&amp;#39;re just here working and</text>
  <text start="732.679" dur="6.811">yeah they tell me how just really</text>
  <text start="735.24" dur="6.809">unhappy and withdrawn this city is so to</text>
  <text start="739.49" dur="6.039">comment they&amp;#39;re trying to burst that DC</text>
  <text start="742.049" dur="6.39">bubble get their minds opened and get</text>
  <text start="745.529" dur="4.65">them a little uh a little more woken up</text>
  <text start="748.439" dur="4.291">but that&amp;#39;s the thing about urban</text>
  <text start="750.179" dur="6.12">environments not just DC but any urban</text>
  <text start="752.73" dur="5.19">environment Seattle LA New York DC is</text>
  <text start="756.299" dur="4.95">that when you&amp;#39;re in an urban environment</text>
  <text start="757.92" dur="6.389">like this the programming is a lot</text>
  <text start="761.249" dur="5.491">easier to hit home and by this I mean</text>
  <text start="764.309" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;ve got billboards everywhere I can</text>
  <text start="766.74" dur="3.659">walk down the street and you&amp;#39;ve got a</text>

  <text start="770.399" dur="4.68">billboard on the bench and a billboard</text>
  <text start="772.23" dur="4.44">up here so the the it&amp;#39;s a lot easier for</text>
  <text start="775.079" dur="4.521">them to program in urban environments</text>
  <text start="776.67" dur="4.979">because there&amp;#39;s this over sensory</text>
  <text start="779.6" dur="4.63">sensory overload that people are dealing</text>
  <text start="781.649" dur="4.05">with and their subconscious is just</text>
  <text start="784.23" dur="2.789">their subconscious is taking it and</text>
  <text start="785.699" dur="2.461">they&amp;#39;re conscious awareness isn&amp;#39;t but</text>
  <text start="787.019" dur="2.88">their subconscious is still being</text>
  <text start="788.16" dur="4.619">programmed by all those billboards all</text>
  <text start="789.899" dur="5.28">those little signs oh I mean everything</text>
  <text start="792.779" dur="4.261">so it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to stay asleep in</text>
  <text start="795.179" dur="3.541">an urban environment and not just the</text>
  <text start="797.04" dur="3.18">programming that people are seeing but</text>

  <text start="951.27" dur="6.33">most definitely you see but a lot of</text>
  <text start="954.27" dur="6.63">people use the Bible to spiritually</text>
  <text start="957.6" dur="7.23">devolve and I don&amp;#39;t like that I will</text>
  <text start="960.9" dur="8.19">call it out I&amp;#39;m not afraid to let your</text>
  <text start="964.83" dur="8.3">karma run over that dogma huh there you</text>

  <text start="973.13" dur="6.61">whichever way you choose it&amp;#39;s all good</text>

  <text start="988.74" dur="3.87">you know there&amp;#39;s all this religious</text>
  <text start="990.45" dur="4.38">dogma out there I&amp;#39;m not afraid to</text>
  <text start="992.61" dur="3.12">discuss that and show that to people but</text>
  <text start="994.83" dur="3.66">at the same time there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="995.73" dur="4.65">scientific dogma too and I talk is just</text>
  <text start="998.49" dur="3.09">as much about the scientific dog when I</text>
  <text start="1000.38" dur="3.24">talk way more actually about the</text>
  <text start="1001.58" dur="7.31">scientific dogma then the religious</text>
  <text start="1003.62" dur="7.98">dogma and you know the vaccines the</text>
  <text start="1008.89" dur="5.2">climate change just all the nonsense we</text>
  <text start="1011.6" dur="4.11">hear about science the wrong physics</text>
  <text start="1014.09" dur="7.1">were talk the wrong history were taught</text>
  <text start="1015.71" dur="5.48">so that is that</text>

  <text start="1047.169" dur="4.98">so 8chan possibly coming online this</text>
  <text start="1049.809" dur="6">week Jim Watkins did an interview with</text>
  <text start="1052.149" dur="5.701">oh man when American news and this</text>
  <text start="1055.809" dur="4.801">interview last weekend this was just two</text>
  <text start="1057.85" dur="5.34">or three days ago this interview was</text>
  <text start="1060.61" dur="5.46">interesting because it was with Jack Poe</text>
  <text start="1063.19" dur="5.609">Sobek right and if you&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="1066.07" dur="6.06">q and researching it involved with the</text>
  <text start="1068.799" dur="4.321">community for about a year now it was</text>
  <text start="1072.13" dur="3.6">about a year ago</text>
  <text start="1073.12" dur="4.74">you know Q&amp;#39;s been posting for nearly two</text>
  <text start="1075.73" dur="5.159">years now but it&amp;#39;s about a year ago when</text>
  <text start="1077.86" dur="4.98">Jack Poe so Beck and the whole Infowars</text>
  <text start="1080.889" dur="4.5">drama happened and Jack posted beck was</text>
  <text start="1082.84" dur="5.91">calling Q a larper cult and trying to</text>
  <text start="1085.389" dur="5.941">claim that he had these sources who and</text>
  <text start="1088.75" dur="5.37">he knew who cute was who started it and</text>
  <text start="1091.33" dur="4.079">blah blah blah right all these lies</text>
  <text start="1094.12" dur="6.299">there&amp;#39;s a lot of Lies and false</text>
  <text start="1095.409" dur="7.851">information so weird really weird that</text>
  <text start="1100.419" dur="7.921">Jim Watkins would do an interview with</text>
  <text start="1103.26" dur="6.94">Jack Poe sobic and really just very odd</text>
  <text start="1108.34" dur="3.54">a lot of people were asking me if Jim</text>
  <text start="1110.2" dur="3.27">Watkins was compromised or what the heck</text>
  <text start="1111.88" dur="4.5">was going on I don&amp;#39;t think Jim Watkins</text>
  <text start="1113.47" dur="4.62">is compromised you know in any way it</text>
  <text start="1116.38" dur="3.929">was cool he actually wore a little Q pin</text>
  <text start="1118.09" dur="3.839">he took a photo of himself in front of</text>
  <text start="1120.309" dur="4.681">Congress with the Q pin don&amp;#39;t know if we</text>
  <text start="1121.929" dur="4.831">wore that Q pin in front of Congress but</text>
  <text start="1124.99" dur="3.09">he took a picture of it outside the</text>
  <text start="1126.76" dur="2.759">Congressional building with that Q pin</text>
  <text start="1128.08" dur="4.74">he actually wore that Q pin during his</text>
  <text start="1129.519" dur="5.28">interview with Jack Pacific so why why</text>
  <text start="1132.82" dur="4.109">the heck would Jim Watkins do that</text>
  <text start="1134.799" dur="6.901">that&amp;#39;s kind of like a slap in the face</text>
  <text start="1136.929" dur="8.311">to the Q community right um kind of it</text>
  <text start="1141.7" dur="6.9">kind of sucks but at the same time if</text>
  <text start="1145.24" dur="5.64">he&amp;#39;s here in DC he had to do some media</text>
  <text start="1148.6" dur="5.88">he had to do an interview it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1150.88" dur="6.6">smart to do some sort of interview media</text>
  <text start="1154.48" dur="4.92">while he&amp;#39;s here and pretty much the</text>
  <text start="1157.48" dur="4.71">the organizations that Jim Watkins could</text>
  <text start="1159.4" dur="5.79">have gone to for some fair coverage</text>
  <text start="1162.19" dur="5.46">would have been probably the epic times</text>
  <text start="1165.19" dur="5.64">or what American news it was really the</text>
  <text start="1167.65" dur="6.36">only like mainstream esque outlets he</text>
  <text start="1170.83" dur="7.92">could have gone to for some good</text>
  <text start="1174.01" dur="6.419">coverage epic times I don&amp;#39;t think he had</text>
  <text start="1178.75" dur="3.33">a really chance to do that epic times</text>
  <text start="1180.429" dur="3.331">doesn&amp;#39;t want to open themselves up to</text>
  <text start="1182.08" dur="3">any more attack than they&amp;#39;ve had by the</text>
  <text start="1183.76" dur="3.03">mainstream media over the last few weeks</text>
  <text start="1185.08" dur="4.589">so it&amp;#39;s pretty much what American news</text>
  <text start="1186.79" dur="4.95">and fully support Jim Watkins doing that</text>
  <text start="1189.669" dur="4.351">don&amp;#39;t really know why or how</text>
  <text start="1191.74" dur="4.679">Jack Poe so Beck was the one that did</text>
  <text start="1194.02" dur="5.76">the interview don&amp;#39;t know the situation</text>
  <text start="1196.419" dur="4.981">of how he landed that but it was a good</text>
  <text start="1199.78" dur="5.06">interview you know of course Jack</text>
  <text start="1201.4" dur="6.09">Pacific didn&amp;#39;t ask about Q it all and</text>
  <text start="1204.84" dur="4.719">now I can understand why as well with</text>
  <text start="1207.49" dur="5.22">that interview being done for one</text>
  <text start="1209.559" dur="5.941">American news but nevertheless you know</text>
  <text start="1212.71" dur="7.11">let&amp;#39;s see the big picture it&amp;#39;s helpful</text>
  <text start="1215.5" dur="6.299">in the long run right I mean look at</text>
  <text start="1219.82" dur="5.76">Donald Trump he&amp;#39;s done interviews with</text>
  <text start="1221.799" dur="9.601">ABC just because you do an interview</text>
  <text start="1225.58" dur="7.56">with you know a media outlet that might</text>
  <text start="1231.4" dur="3.72">put out some false information time and</text>
  <text start="1233.14" dur="3.63">again doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you&amp;#39;re a shill</text>
  <text start="1235.12" dur="3.57">right I&amp;#39;ve done an interview with</text>
  <text start="1236.77" dur="3.96">Washington Post before there&amp;#39;s me na</text>
  <text start="1238.69" dur="4.83">Michelle just means you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1240.73" dur="4.29">reach you know their audience with the</text>
  <text start="1243.52" dur="3.75">narratives that you want to bring and</text>
  <text start="1245.02" dur="3.899">you try to do it tactically and</text>
  <text start="1247.27" dur="3.42">strategically in a way that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1248.919" dur="3.241">gonna be able to twist your words but</text>
  <text start="1250.69" dur="2.97">like I said you know that interview that</text>
  <text start="1252.16" dur="7.04">Jack post evicted with Jim Watkins it</text>
  <text start="1253.66" dur="9.42">was pretty good interview so all in all</text>
  <text start="1259.2" dur="5.68">thumbs up for that but again Jack posted</text>
  <text start="1263.08" dur="3.81">back totally weird and it is a little</text>

  <text start="1491.59" dur="4.44">able to scour the internet and draw all</text>
  <text start="1494.2" dur="3.9">these pieces of information together I</text>
  <text start="1496.03" dur="4.65">mean and how many instances do we have</text>
  <text start="1498.1" dur="4.4">of Q posting something before it</text>
  <text start="1500.68" dur="4.74">happened for knowledge things like that</text>
  <text start="1502.5" dur="5.98">so just goes to show you perfect example</text>
  <text start="1505.42" dur="9.15">of people who do the research and people</text>
  <text start="1508.48" dur="10.62">who don&amp;#39;t do the research my gosh you</text>
  <text start="1514.57" dur="9.05">know so very a clear example there</text>
  <text start="1519.1" dur="7.38">another other areas that I see this are</text>
  <text start="1523.62" dur="7.51">just what I have expertise and a lot of</text>

  <text start="1613.84" dur="5.22">if there are humans on Mars already just</text>
  <text start="1617.35" dur="4.62">look at number one how much money has</text>

  <text start="1648.65" dur="6.01">twenty-one trillion in 18 years it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1653.19" dur="4.2">been longer than that if you look it</text>
  <text start="1654.66" dur="5.55">back into the 1980s and Franklin Spinney</text>
  <text start="1657.39" dur="5.13">he was a pentagon analyst I believe a</text>
  <text start="1660.21" dur="4.2">budget analyst and he was detailing the</text>
  <text start="1662.52" dur="4.8">money siphoning going on back then so</text>
  <text start="1664.41" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s been a lot longer than 18 years I</text>
  <text start="1667.32" dur="4.11">mean this money siphoning out of public</text>
  <text start="1669.09" dur="4.5">budgets has been going on probably since</text>
  <text start="1671.43" dur="5.07">day one since at least the 60s and 70s</text>
  <text start="1673.59" dur="4.35">and that 21 trillion that a lot of</text>
  <text start="1676.5" dur="3.09">people throw around what a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1677.94" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t realize is that is that&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="1679.59" dur="5.07">going both in and out of the DoD&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1682.23" dur="5.16">budget so it&amp;#39;s probably a lot less than</text>
  <text start="1684.66" dur="4.74">twenty one trillion but we did have that</text>
  <text start="1687.39" dur="4.23">inspector general report come out in</text>
  <text start="1689.4" dur="8.76">2016 that detailed it&amp;#39;s at least six</text>

  <text start="1698.16" dur="6.36">much it is as long as it you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1699.78" dur="6.54">trillions so what we know and it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1704.52" dur="4.05">of money it&amp;#39;s been taken out of the</text>
  <text start="1706.32" dur="5.63">budgets for a long long time into these</text>

  <text start="2294.39" dur="6.54">of wonder TV platform and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2297.39" dur="8.49">getting censored for plenty of stuff on</text>
  <text start="2300.93" dur="7.98">this channel like MMS chlorine dioxide</text>
  <text start="2305.88" dur="5.85">some other health and big pharma topics</text>
  <text start="2308.91" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s very tough to get those out here so</text>
  <text start="2311.73" dur="2.52">I could do a video on their platform</text>
  <text start="2313.83" dur="3.74">right</text>
  <text start="2314.25" dur="3.32">they won&amp;#39;t censor nothing</text>
  <text start="2327.31" dur="10.28">uh yeah any news on Epstein I think I</text>
  <text start="2334" dur="5.79">talked about this in my last video but</text>
  <text start="2337.59" dur="5.08">what we&amp;#39;re waiting on Epstein we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2339.79" dur="7.59">about a month out we&amp;#39;re about one month</text>
  <text start="2342.67" dur="7.53">out from the decision to either steal or</text>
  <text start="2347.38" dur="5.67">unseal those like 10,000 to 20,000 more</text>
  <text start="2350.2" dur="5.19">documents so we&amp;#39;re going back and forth</text>
  <text start="2353.05" dur="3.95">I think the proponents of sealing have a</text>
  <text start="2355.39" dur="3.75">week or two to respond than the</text>
  <text start="2357" dur="3.7">opponents of sealing have a week or two</text>
  <text start="2359.14" dur="4.71">to respond and then the judge is gonna</text>
  <text start="2360.7" dur="4.92">make a decision so I mean if if the</text>
  <text start="2363.85" dur="3.57">judge makes a decision to keep it sealed</text>
  <text start="2365.62" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s just gonna cause a big shitstorm</text>
  <text start="2367.42" dur="5.01">so I do think that the judge is gonna</text>
  <text start="2369.97" dur="5.88">seal those 10,000 more documents and we</text>
  <text start="2372.43" dur="6.72">should get those we&amp;#39;ll see maybe</text>
  <text start="2375.85" dur="5.22">beginning mid-october so there&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="2379.15" dur="4.02">and then some people earlier I saw in</text>
  <text start="2381.07" dur="4.88">the comments we&amp;#39;re talking about general</text>
  <text start="2383.17" dur="8.04">Flint general Flynn&amp;#39;s court case is</text>
  <text start="2385.95" dur="8.77">today where they are making a decision</text>
  <text start="2391.21" dur="6">on I believe whether or not to let a</text>
  <text start="2394.72" dur="4.98">motion continue for the exculpatory</text>
  <text start="2397.21" dur="6.36">evidence to be entered into Flynn&amp;#39;s case</text>
  <text start="2399.7" dur="7.41">now I mean I think we can connect the</text>
  <text start="2403.57" dur="6.36">dots and venture to guess that some bad</text>
  <text start="2407.11" dur="4.68">hats within the FBI and DOJ we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2409.93" dur="4.77">withholding exculpatory evidence in</text>

  <text start="2431.74" dur="7.26">think we&amp;#39;re gonna be learning a lot</text>
  <text start="2434.29" dur="6.21">about Flynn&amp;#39;s que pase generally at the</text>
  <text start="2439" dur="3.99">same time that we&amp;#39;re gonna get FISA D</text>
