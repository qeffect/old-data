  <text start="13.66" dur="5.34">what I want to discuss with you is a</text>
  <text start="16.15" dur="5.28">very important topic for every single</text>
  <text start="19" dur="3.599">person to understand and that is fake</text>
  <text start="21.43" dur="4.62">science</text>
  <text start="22.599" dur="8.25">beware the false gods right and that</text>
  <text start="26.05" dur="6.87">includes the science gods now much of</text>
  <text start="30.849" dur="4.89">the science that we are taught in our</text>
  <text start="32.92" dur="7.04">typical education indoctrination</text>
  <text start="35.739" dur="6.691">institutions is straight-up and</text>
  <text start="39.96" dur="4.45">pick a subject any subject you want</text>
  <text start="42.43" dur="4.35">right that could be vaccine research</text>
  <text start="44.41" dur="5.76">that could be GMO research that could be</text>
  <text start="46.78" dur="5.4">global warming or even archeology in</text>
  <text start="50.17" dur="4.37">human history and then one of my</text>
  <text start="52.18" dur="5.76">favorite subjects that we are absolutely</text>
  <text start="54.54" dur="5.83">biessed over is physics quantum physics</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="6.119">research right electromagnetic theory</text>
  <text start="60.37" dur="6.63">and this delves into all the Tesla</text>
  <text start="64.059" dur="6.571">research in yada-yada my point being is</text>
  <text start="67" dur="5.28">that in you could pick any single</text>
  <text start="70.63" dur="4.019">subject you want there is some</text>
  <text start="72.28" dur="5.039">fraudulent the quite literally lies put</text>
  <text start="74.649" dur="4.89">out about it now the inspiration for</text>
  <text start="77.319" dur="4.11">this video comes from this article that</text>
  <text start="79.539" dur="6.54">I just came across that was released</text>
  <text start="81.429" dur="7.32">today on Russia today and it literally</text>
  <text start="86.079" dur="6.03">says as you can see by the headline top</text>
  <text start="88.749" dur="7.381">British universities found producing</text>
  <text start="92.109" dur="6.69">fake research so fake science is not</text>
  <text start="96.13" dur="4.86">fake news folks it&amp;#39;s very real news and</text>
  <text start="98.799" dur="3.93">this says hundreds of allegations of</text>
  <text start="100.99" dur="4.879">fake research conducted at some of the</text>
  <text start="102.729" dur="6.331">UK&amp;#39;s top universities were reported</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="6.761">basically within the last five years so</text>
  <text start="109.06" dur="6.599">they found according to figures released</text>
  <text start="112.63" dur="5.669">by twenty three of Britain&amp;#39;s 24 Russell</text>
  <text start="115.659" dur="5.52">Group universities following Freedom of</text>
  <text start="118.299" dur="5.401">Information requests the scale of</text>
  <text start="121.179" dur="4.591">fraudulent research is much higher about</text>
  <text start="123.7" dur="5.91">ten times higher than they originally</text>
  <text start="125.77" dur="5.67">believed and what I&amp;#39;m saying to you in</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="3.18">this video is this is completely</text>
  <text start="131.44" dur="3.21">commonplace and this is something that a</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="6.33">lot of people don&amp;#39;t get they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="6.08">realize that science is complete BS in</text>
  <text start="139.12" dur="4.22">this day and age in there</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="4.92">believing a lot of these lies and they</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="5.07">have a very tough time distancing</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="4.89">themselves from that okay College in</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="4.01">this day and age is not an education</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="6.12">institution it&amp;#39;s an indoctrination</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="6.01">system they they tell people whether</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s medical doctors or physicists yada</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="3.74">yada they tell these people that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="5.19">the best and brightest of the bunch and</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="5.879">make them pay tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="5.579">dollars to get this education so it</text>
  <text start="168.049" dur="5.111">strengthens the person&amp;#39;s or the</text>
  <text start="170.489" dur="5.61">student&amp;#39;s ego so much they believe</text>
  <text start="173.16" dur="5.49">themselves to be know-it-alls literally</text>
  <text start="176.099" dur="5.121">and since they paid so much money to</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="5.48">believe themselves to be know-it-alls</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="6.4">they don&amp;#39;t want to change their mind</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="5.919">scientists and doctors and people who</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="4.649">are university trained are some of the</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="4.141">least likely people on this planet to</text>
  <text start="192.269" dur="3.901">change their freaking mind because their</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="3.75">ego they&amp;#39;re so engrained into their</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="3.06">worldview that they&amp;#39;ve you know they</text>
  <text start="197.94" dur="3.09">have so much riding on this they have</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="4.319">literally their livelihoods writing on</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="5.489">them believing the lies they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="203.549" dur="5.151">to change so we have to change we have</text>
  <text start="206.519" dur="7.641">to understand that a lot of these this</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="8.2">science that is given to us is BS and</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="7">right I mean this just makes me think</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="6.809">too you know at a political view to this</text>
  <text start="221.16" dur="4.56">a lot of people are giving the Trump</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="6.351">administration for wanting to</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="9.389">dismantle the EPA and being anti science</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="6.22">when you look at the absolute cesspool</text>
  <text start="235.109" dur="3.241">that a lot of these three-letter</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="4.829">agencies are for instance the EPA</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="5.759">there&amp;#39;s skullduggery with Monsanto the</text>
  <text start="241.109" dur="5.49">FDA same thing there&amp;#39;s skullduggery with</text>
  <text start="244.109" dur="3.96">the pharmaceutical companies the CDC the</text>
  <text start="246.599" dur="3.121">you know you can keep going down the</text>
  <text start="248.069" dur="4.32">list of whatever three-letter agency you</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="4.019">want it&amp;#39;s not anti science it&amp;#39;s anti</text>
  <text start="252.389" dur="4.35">corruption that the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="253.739" dur="6.8">is you know that it looks like that</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="8.811">they&amp;#39;re trying to address an attack and</text>
  <text start="260.539" dur="6.901">the whole science versus religion</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="3.85">debacle is one of those</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="3.82">divide-and-conquer dualities that have</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="4.57">been very effective for the powers that</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="4.93">be to completely rape our minds with</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="6.57">and whether you believe and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="4.86">talking about when I mean science versus</text>
  <text start="280.54" dur="3">religion</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="5.55">I mean fundamentalist religion versus</text>
  <text start="283.54" dur="5.16">fundamentalist science and people will</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="3.33">you know people will gravitate into one</text>
  <text start="288.7" dur="3.6">of those two fields and not realize that</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re both completely wrong and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="4.98">only when you really merge the two you</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="5.46">merge the and you look at the science of</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="5.19">spirit per se is where the answers are</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="4.23">found but of course those answers aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="7.11">taught in the conventional mainstream</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="7.41">wisdom so this is why I&amp;#39;m doing this</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="4.71">video is because we need to address the</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="4.29">fact that science is false and many</text>
  <text start="314.29" dur="4.74">people need to realize that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="315.88" dur="4.74">praying to science they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re not believing science they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="6.45">believing scientists right big</text>
  <text start="323.74" dur="8.3">difference science is objective science</text>
  <text start="327.07" dur="8.07">is simply observing what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="332.04" dur="5.5">extract and looking at that data and</text>
  <text start="335.14" dur="4.23">extrapolating theories and ideas about</text>
  <text start="337.54" dur="4.77">what the heck&amp;#39;s going on here a lot of</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="4.74">people believe in scientists they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="3.15">believe in true science they simply look</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="4.86">at the people who have already said the</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="5.37">BS things and follow along with that so</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="4.23">there needs to be a distinguishment</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="4.44">between the two and a realization that</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="5.28">scientists are human just as much as we</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="6.27">are they lie they don&amp;#39;t admit they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.48" dur="5.79">wrong they create fraudulent research</text>
  <text start="361.54" dur="7.08">and put this stuff out there for their</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="6.99">own financial and power gains so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="4.41">going to end this video with two more</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="5.43">quotes here that I&amp;#39;ll put up some</text>
  <text start="373.03" dur="7.139">screenshots of one is a literal quote by</text>
  <text start="376.69" dur="6.33">the editor of The Lancet and dr. Richard</text>
  <text start="380.169" dur="4.561">Horton and he says the case against</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="3.78">science is straightforward much of the</text>
  <text start="384.73" dur="7.08">science literature perhaps half may</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="8.15">simply be untrue okay huge revelation</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="5.25">and another quote by a longtime</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="5.74">editor-in-chief of the New England</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="6.69">Medical Journal dr. marcia angle or</text>
  <text start="400.69" dur="4.979">angel she says it&amp;#39;s simply no longer</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="3.13">possible to believe much of the critical</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="3.551">clinical research</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="4.77">that is published and the reason I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="4.17">showing you these two quotes is because</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="4.38">not only are they great knowledge</text>
  <text start="413.39" dur="5.46">nuggets for you but you can use these</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="4.5">two instances of people admitting that</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="4.26">science is falsified and the research</text>
  <text start="420.53" dur="3.96">institutions for awakening your own</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="3.27">friends and family these are just great</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="3.39">knowledge nuggets to plant the seeds of</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="3.99">consciousness in other people&amp;#39;s minds</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="10.56">with never underestimate planting those</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="11.46">seeds and it must be noted that and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="5.7">going back to this Russia Today article</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="4.38">here it says it is thought that the</text>
  <text start="444.14" dur="3.72">inaccuracy and sloppiness in academic</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="3.03">papers is due to researchers rushing</text>
  <text start="447.86" dur="3.96">through their copies in order to get</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="7.32">grants to carry on their work so like I</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="6.18">said the researchers are human and a lot</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="3.78">of these humans don&amp;#39;t want to realize</text>
  <text start="458" dur="6.51">that they&amp;#39;ve been duped by the upper</text>
  <text start="460.34" dur="6.57">echelons and powers-that-be so we must</text>
  <text start="464.51" dur="4.53">realize this we must get back to real</text>
  <text start="466.91" dur="6.48">science understand what real science is</text>
  <text start="469.04" dur="5.58">and exit our minds from that matrix and</text>
  <text start="473.39" dur="4.65">begin to think of ourselves and</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="6.81">formulate our own opinions so do that</text>
  <text start="478.04" dur="6.27">for me do that for everybody and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.43" dur="4.56">get back to the real science here so we</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="2.94">can get begin to figuring out what the</text>
  <text start="485.99" dur="2.01">heck is out going on here</text>
