  <text start="26.01" dur="3.06">videos or any content here on this</text>
  <text start="27.539" dur="4.531">channel and the reason being is because</text>
  <text start="29.07" dur="5.579">as you can kind of see I&amp;#39;m switching up</text>
  <text start="32.07" dur="6.63">my humble abode a little bit so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="34.649" dur="7.23">moved my office and all of my filming</text>

  <text start="59.64" dur="5.43">videos I just stand up with and the</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="4.591">blackboard I think I might be utilizing</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="4.56">the blackboard as opposed to the</text>
  <text start="67.65" dur="4.59">whiteboard in certain videos from now on</text>

  <text start="78.6" dur="4.44">more professional it doesn&amp;#39;t reflect</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="6.65">quite as much and I got myself nice</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="6.149">little ring light there can start uh</text>
  <text start="86.93" dur="5.829">making it look a little nicer when I do</text>
  <text start="89.189" dur="6.031">those those board videos but think that</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="4.621">looks awesome and then over here that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="123.479" dur="5.76">was always sitting at my desk but I find</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="7.26">that I&amp;#39;m just more comfortable standing</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="4.711">and being able to move about move my</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="4.17">arms</text>

  <text start="334.77" dur="4.17">I believe from like the first week of</text>
  <text start="337.2" dur="4.41">January that all tribunals are only</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="4.229">ongoing now but I mean that sort of</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="4.14">stuff is gonna be so classified so</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="5.371">sensitive that how can we expect to get</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="5.64">leaks or to get info on that you know</text>

  <text start="351.39" dur="5.31">sort of tribunals are started or there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.97" dur="6.6">people in Gitmo or stuff like that could</text>
  <text start="356.7" dur="5.91">be clickbait could be people taking</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="6.39">things that have been set out of context</text>

  <text start="459.13" dur="7.62">can&amp;#39;t remember who is performing but all</text>
  <text start="461.59" dur="6.9">those ridiculous instances of halftime</text>

  <text start="478.03" dur="2.91">all the commercials they had were just</text>
  <text start="479.29" dur="4.38">loaded with symbolism as well</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="4.89">tried noticing that last night and at</text>

  <text start="485.83" dur="5.13">I stayed up for watching the Super Bowl</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="5.87">and what I did see it&amp;#39;s like all the</text>
  <text start="490.96" dur="5.72">commercials were either about robots</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="7.72">something social justice a lot of like</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="7.81">feminism who got called toxic feminism</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="5.91">and what was the other one there was a</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="4.71">lot of like killer slasher movie</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="3.93">previews and stuff like that like a Hulu</text>
  <text start="509.2" dur="3.81">show and a Netflix show and stuff like</text>
  <text start="510.64" dur="5.82">that where it was like murders like a</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="5.07">crazy amount of weird I mean you could</text>

  <text start="519.04" dur="6.15">there but uh I mean just boring like</text>
  <text start="522.76" dur="3.99">super boring and I that&amp;#39;s kind of how I</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="3.57">view professional sports in general</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="3.42">these days don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I&amp;#39;m all</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="4.3">for athletics</text>
  <text start="530.17" dur="6.43">I&amp;#39;m all for sports</text>
  <text start="533.06" dur="7.469">I think competitive sports is a great</text>
  <text start="536.6" dur="7.41">way to get out aggression in a positive</text>
  <text start="540.529" dur="5.731">way and of course you know when there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.01" dur="4.32">good sportsmanship on both sides etc etc</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="5.69">sports are very helpful especially for</text>
  <text start="548.33" dur="6.03">our society we have a very warrior</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="4.15">aggressive society so it&amp;#39;s great to blow</text>
  <text start="554.36" dur="3.69">off steam with the problem with</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="3.27">professional sports at the top levels</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="6.09">that we have is of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.37" dur="7.83">basically you know slaves for the dollar</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="4.47">doing whatever they can to perform at</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="3.63">those levels and be on their team and</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="5">you know they&amp;#39;re all just puppets</text>
  <text start="570.83" dur="6.24">basically for a big ol Brydon circus</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="6.25">bread and circus exactly what it is</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="4.769">it&amp;#39;s what the ancient Greeks and Romans</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="5.22">would call their spectacles that they</text>
  <text start="581.839" dur="6.871">have bread and circus same thing George</text>
  <text start="585.08" dur="5.73">Orwell wrote in his book said just fill</text>
  <text start="588.71" dur="3.87">the people to the top with bread and</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="3.42">circus I think he called it beer that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.58" dur="4.46">the modern-day bread the whole liquid</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="5.609">bread fill the people to the top with</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="5.61">sport and beer and they&amp;#39;ll never think</text>
  <text start="599.839" dur="5.851">twice about the slavery that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="602.65" dur="5.77">bill Cooper said the same thing great</text>
  <text start="605.69" dur="5.66">video of Bill Cooper talking about how</text>
  <text start="608.42" dur="5.82">sports just used as a distraction</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="5.53">completely same thing as the media and</text>
  <text start="614.24" dur="4.77">then these sports stars are propped up</text>
  <text start="616.88" dur="5.73">much like these Hollywood singers and</text>

  <text start="1361.88" dur="8.4">people who infringe Musk&amp;#39;s patent rights</text>
  <text start="1366.29" dur="5.28">to work on electric car technology so it</text>
  <text start="1370.28" dur="3.15">wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily he was releasing his</text>
  <text start="1371.57" dur="4.26">past in the world he was just sort of</text>
  <text start="1373.43" dur="4.05">reiterating the idea that Elaan musk</text>
  <text start="1375.83" dur="4.62">doesn&amp;#39;t like to go after people for</text>
  <text start="1377.48" dur="7.2">patent infringement which is cool but at</text>
  <text start="1380.45" dur="6.45">the same time the actual patents the</text>
  <text start="1384.68" dur="4.17">Tesla&amp;#39;s going to have or Li mosque</text>
  <text start="1386.9" dur="4.65">excuse me is going to have it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1388.85" dur="4.04">going to be free energy zero-point</text>
  <text start="1391.55" dur="3.62">energy etc related</text>
  <text start="1392.89" dur="6.23">the real hard core technologies Teta I</text>
  <text start="1395.17" dur="6.54">want to see release to the public so</text>
  <text start="1399.12" dur="6.13">doesn&amp;#39;t I mean it&amp;#39;s cool that LM us</text>
  <text start="1401.71" dur="5.01">won&amp;#39;t claims to not go after people for</text>
  <text start="1405.25" dur="4.77">patent infringement but at the same time</text>
  <text start="1406.72" dur="5.93">it&amp;#39;s not like those patents are paradigm</text>
  <text start="1410.02" dur="5.88">changing in any way their public patents</text>
  <text start="1412.65" dur="5.56">the important patents are all classified</text>
  <text start="1415.9" dur="6.149">look up the invention Secrecy Act of</text>
  <text start="1418.21" dur="5.91">1952 some 6,000 patents maybe even more</text>
  <text start="1422.049" dur="5.461">maybe in some of the maybe up in the</text>
  <text start="1424.12" dur="5.79">area of maybe 7000 are classified and</text>
  <text start="1427.51" dur="5.25">they can be classified by any branch of</text>
  <text start="1429.91" dur="4.53">the government for quote national</text>
  <text start="1432.76" dur="3.9">security concerns you know how vague</text>
  <text start="1434.44" dur="6.09">that can get national security concerns</text>
  <text start="1436.66" dur="9.83">so basically it means free energy</text>
  <text start="1440.53" dur="8.31">technology or very efficient electricity</text>
  <text start="1446.49" dur="4.24">creation technologies that the deep</text>
  <text start="1448.84" dur="6.23">state doesn&amp;#39;t one out because the oil</text>
  <text start="1450.73" dur="7.319">barons want their money or they want the</text>
  <text start="1455.07" dur="7.92">smokescreen organizations like NASA and</text>
  <text start="1458.049" dur="4.941">Tesla to be able to also make them money</text>
  <text start="1468.4" dur="11.46">stock space I&amp;#39;m down kind of space</text>
  <text start="1474.25" dur="7.47">questions y&amp;#39;all got for me what do I</text>
  <text start="1479.86" dur="3.78">think so Joelle asks what do I think</text>
  <text start="1481.72" dur="3.75">about all this talk about cold fusion is</text>
  <text start="1483.64" dur="3.77">it just a distraction from free energy</text>
  <text start="1485.47" dur="6.48">well</text>
  <text start="1487.41" dur="6.15">no but yes you know cold fusion is a</text>
  <text start="1491.95" dur="4.11">form of free energy essentially</text>
  <text start="1493.56" dur="5.32">over-unity energy but at the same time</text>
  <text start="1496.06" dur="4.35">cold fusions been around since I believe</text>
  <text start="1498.88" dur="4.47">it was developed in the 1980s by two</text>
  <text start="1500.41" dur="4.5">scientists out of Utah the thing is what</text>
  <text start="1503.35" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re hearing out of like MIT in the</text>
  <text start="1504.91" dur="5.1">mainstream media and universities now is</text>
  <text start="1507.82" dur="4.38">that fusion is about to be developed</text>
  <text start="1510.01" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re claiming that they are gonna be</text>
  <text start="1512.2" dur="3.81">the ones that develop it and bring free</text>
  <text start="1513.91" dur="3.3">energy to the public little R they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1516.01" dur="3.75">gonna tell you it&amp;#39;s actually been in</text>
  <text start="1517.21" dur="6.18">existence for 40 years inventors have</text>
  <text start="1519.76" dur="5.22">been suppressed and killed over it you</text>
  <text start="1523.39" dur="3.39">know this is the idea of a partial</text>
  <text start="1524.98" dur="3.48">disclosure or a limited hangout</text>
  <text start="1526.78" dur="4.17">disclosure the deep stake is running a</text>
  <text start="1528.46" dur="5.04">lot of limited hangout disclosures into</text>
  <text start="1530.95" dur="5.34">the public right now many by way of I</text>
  <text start="1533.5" dur="4.98">mean they&amp;#39;re trying to run limited</text>
  <text start="1536.29" dur="5.04">hangout disclosure operations with UFOs</text>
  <text start="1538.48" dur="5.01">with free energy technologies with a lot</text>
  <text start="1541.33" dur="7.26">of other technologies as well you know I</text>
  <text start="1543.49" dur="7.41">believe MIT also were quietly admitting</text>
  <text start="1548.59" dur="6.12">that they can they have technologies</text>
  <text start="1550.9" dur="7.23">that can beam audio into a person&amp;#39;s ear</text>
  <text start="1554.71" dur="7.62">through a laser focused audio nobody can</text>
  <text start="1558.13" dur="5.82">hear it but that one person now MIT is</text>
  <text start="1562.33" dur="3.39">claiming that they just developed this</text>
  <text start="1563.95" dur="3.39">but if you research the voice of God a</text>
  <text start="1565.72" dur="4.74">voice to school technologies these have</text>
  <text start="1567.34" dur="5.91">been around for decades since 1980s or</text>
  <text start="1570.46" dur="4.53">70s even so it&amp;#39;s the idea of a limited</text>
  <text start="1573.25" dur="3.63">hangout they give you a tiny sliver of</text>
  <text start="1574.99" dur="3.36">truth but they don&amp;#39;t give you the</text>
  <text start="1576.88" dur="3.24">backstory they don&amp;#39;t give you the more</text>
  <text start="1578.35" dur="4.26">damaging information and they try to</text>
  <text start="1580.12" dur="3.81">placate you with that one little sliver</text>
  <text start="1582.61" dur="4.23">of truth make you think that&amp;#39;s all there</text>
  <text start="1583.93" dur="4.41">is so you go okay this is it you know I</text>
  <text start="1586.84" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t need to look any further and then</text>
  <text start="1588.34" dur="5.9">I can brush the rest of the stuff under</text>
  <text start="1590.44" dur="7.01">the rug right this is massive reason why</text>
  <text start="1594.24" dur="5.68">the deep state is trying to bring out a</text>
  <text start="1597.45" dur="4.21">limited hangout or a partial disclosure</text>
  <text start="1599.92" dur="3.84">with UFOs</text>
  <text start="1601.66" dur="4.59">notice a lot of the same people trying</text>
  <text start="1603.76" dur="3.87">to bring forth these UFOs disclosures</text>
  <text start="1606.25" dur="4.62">into the mainstream right now like</text>
  <text start="1607.63" dur="6.3">Senator Harry Reid and John Podesta are</text>
  <text start="1610.87" dur="4.71">extremely corrupt people why are they</text>
  <text start="1613.93" dur="2.85">trying to disclose UFOs because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1615.58" dur="4.91">only want to give us a sliver of truth</text>
  <text start="1616.78" dur="6.54">about UFOs make us come oh wow</text>
  <text start="1620.49" dur="5.56">distraction and then they can try to</text>
  <text start="1623.32" dur="4.62">brush the rest of their crimes right</text>
  <text start="1626.05" dur="6.03">John Podesta the rest of his crimes</text>
  <text start="1627.94" dur="11.16">under the rug so uh very important topic</text>
  <text start="1632.08" dur="9.21">to do more work on what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="1639.1" dur="5.54">the Sun right now damn good question</text>
  <text start="1641.29" dur="5.37">David saw somebody mentioned the</text>
  <text start="1644.64" dur="4.75">suspicious observers video that I</text>
  <text start="1646.66" dur="6.27">tweeted the other day earlier in the</text>

  <text start="1663.7" dur="4.08">solar weather space weather the electric</text>
  <text start="1666.16" dur="4.38">universe just a lot of fantastic ideas</text>
  <text start="1667.78" dur="5.01">like that a lot of you know more hidden</text>
  <text start="1670.54" dur="5.94">physics of coltd physics but he really</text>
  <text start="1672.79" dur="5.31">digs deep into it with a mainstream</text>
  <text start="1676.48" dur="5.28">scientific mind to is great at bridging</text>
  <text start="1678.1" dur="5.46">the gap there but he is been doing a</text>
  <text start="1681.76" dur="6.99">series called the earth catastrophes</text>
  <text start="1683.56" dur="7.47">cycle and he is some 15 16 17 videos</text>
  <text start="1688.75" dur="6.06">into this series he&amp;#39;s been releasing</text>
  <text start="1691.03" dur="5.19">them since mid-december so yeah he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1694.81" dur="5.67">quite a few videos into it now but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1696.22" dur="8.16">a great sort of mini multi documentary</text>
  <text start="1700.48" dur="5.91">series detailing what you could call the</text>
  <text start="1704.38" dur="3.39">micro nova you just could go by many</text>
  <text start="1706.39" dur="3.36">different names you&amp;#39;ve called the micro</text>
  <text start="1707.77" dur="4.86">nova you could call it the solar flare</text>
  <text start="1709.75" dur="6.17">the solar flash the solar shift whatever</text>
  <text start="1712.63" dur="7.5">you want to call it but essentially a</text>
  <text start="1715.92" dur="6.52">big freakin galactic solar earth-2 sir</text>
  <text start="1720.13" dur="3.66">disturbance is coming our way and the</text>
  <text start="1722.44" dur="3.12">ancients tried to tell us about this</text>
  <text start="1723.79" dur="3.51">they left us a lot of clues there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1725.56" dur="3.75">lot of clues and ancient scripture and</text>

  <text start="1741.67" dur="6.39">like this and it&amp;#39;s about to go like this</text>
  <text start="1745.47" dur="6.46">for a little bit and it&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="1748.06" dur="7.52">interesting ah I just got that so my</text>
