  <text start="316.26" dur="3.48">checked it a couple times and you know</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="3.51">they seemed cool they just just share an</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="4.83">information like a lot of people do but</text>
  <text start="321.6" dur="6.39">they shared this dude&amp;#39;s video and the</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="6.21">people on this blog were calling me they</text>
  <text start="327.99" dur="6.06">were saying that they wants to expose</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="8.82">you know the would I have it written</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="7.35">down here they said they want to expose</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="3.18">the next convincing distraction they</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="3.39">basically alluded to me being a</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="4.05">convincing distraction and they said you</text>
  <text start="344.79" dur="5.13">know it&amp;#39;s quite suspect when a 27 year</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="5.37">old is coaching clients that really</text>
  <text start="349.92" dur="3.66">sucks because that blog is just that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.2" dur="3.6">some really bad discernment that&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="4.14">really bad thinking skills you know they</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="3.39">didn&amp;#39;t if you watched a minute not even</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="3.69">a minute 10 seconds of any of my videos</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="5.04">and 10 seconds of that dudes video you</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="4.38">can you can just gauge the coherence and</text>
  <text start="364.23" dur="5.31">how we both speak in what we will talk</text>
  <text start="365.79" dur="8.37">about so it&amp;#39;s not tough to discern that</text>
  <text start="369.54" dur="9.44">I&amp;#39;m not a shill and I&amp;#39;m not 27:26</text>
  <text start="374.16" dur="8.4">it&amp;#39;s the little things and then also</text>
  <text start="378.98" dur="4.78">yeah I did I had these grand Pam I do</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="4.08">have a coaching website I had these</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="5.19">grand plans of being like some like</text>
  <text start="386.64" dur="4.59">YouTube health coach that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="388.95" dur="4.53">started my website back in August and</text>
  <text start="391.23" dur="4.2">then that just fell through I have so</text>
  <text start="393.48" dur="3.66">much more of a passion to just exposing</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="3.3">all the other truths in the world not</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="3.33">just health that&amp;#39;s why on this channel</text>
  <text start="398.73" dur="2.49">sometimes I factor in a little bit of</text>
  <text start="400.47" dur="3">health stuff</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s everything else so then about like</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="4.71">January February I started getting into</text>
  <text start="406.53" dur="3.48">the destroying the illusion YouTube and</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="3.6">then I started that route so yeah I</text>
  <text start="410.01" dur="4.14">still throw my health coaching a website</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="4.44">up in there I I have a one one or two</text>

  <text start="417.66" dur="3.93">work on this channel I got no secrets</text>
  <text start="419.73" dur="2.34">man and that&amp;#39;s the thing I got no</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="2.82">secrets</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="4.5">and that&amp;#39;s why roles can&amp;#39;t touch me is</text>
  <text start="424.41" dur="4.47">because I throw it out all now I throw</text>
  <text start="426.57" dur="4.32">it all out on the line I don&amp;#39;t give no</text>
  <text start="428.88" dur="4.38">shits you can say what you want to but</text>
  <text start="430.89" dur="4.14">uh I am you know I basically think of</text>
  <text start="433.26" dur="4.71">myself as the anti troll because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="435.03" dur="4.11">tried to be as authentic as I can so</text>
  <text start="437.97" dur="3.99">anyway that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to say about</text>

  <text start="450.69" dur="5.7">their own discernment in their own</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="5.02">thinking themselves so if you are part</text>
  <text start="456.39" dur="3.21">of a blog that&amp;#39;s doing that just you</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="6.06">know just learn a little better and</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="6.06">let&amp;#39;s not let&amp;#39;s not uh muddy all these</text>
