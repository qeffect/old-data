  <text start="134.25" dur="5.13">this is a fifth time that my name showed</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="5.72">up so the first time was an article of</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="6.24">cereal brains and this had to do with</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="7.6">actually the Infowars situation how</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="6.99">Infowars tried to basically subvert the</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="5.22">movement of cue and and embed themselves</text>
  <text start="152.61" dur="5.04">into it and spread a lot of mischief</text>
  <text start="154.77" dur="4.35">basically and at the time year year and</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="3.03">a half ago I didn&amp;#39;t really realize that</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.32">they were kind of using me to do that</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="5.07">and cereal brain wrote about how they</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="4.65">did cue linked that reddit article from</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="4.74">cereal brain that was in May of last</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="3.66">year and you know she had new light on</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="3.99">the whole thing I was like oh yeah that</text>

  <text start="174.48" dur="6.57">article the Q linked second time was I</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="5.52">believe the second time was when Q</text>
  <text start="181.05" dur="4.56">linked to comment a reply left on a</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="6.06">tweet of mine so Q didn&amp;#39;t link my tweet</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="6.14">but they linked a reply that was on my</text>
  <text start="189.6" dur="5.43">tweet so they had out had to have been a</text>
  <text start="191.75" dur="4.69">lurking on my tweets to see it but they</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="4.05">didn&amp;#39;t like B they&amp;#39;d like the comment so</text>
  <text start="196.44" dur="5.64">I can&amp;#39;t say I was cued right then a</text>
  <text start="199.08" dur="6">third time was another reddit article</text>

  <text start="393.21" dur="6.03">involved so here&amp;#39;s the thing big</text>
  <text start="397.229" dur="3.541">controversy a lot of well-intentioned</text>
  <text start="399.24" dur="4.95">people are sort of</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="5.28">a lot of the shills I&amp;#39;m seeing spread</text>
  <text start="404.19" dur="4.65">their rumors about it there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="4.589">people that support it as well I do have</text>
  <text start="408.84" dur="4.65">criticisms about the project and I will</text>
  <text start="410.639" dur="4.56">get to those but I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.16">people out there they&amp;#39;re letting the</text>
  <text start="415.199" dur="6.12">criticisms go from constructive to</text>
  <text start="418.65" dur="4.019">destructive non constructive criticisms</text>
  <text start="421.319" dur="3.391">and they get a little bit of triggered</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="4.081">and they&amp;#39;re letting the criticisms take</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="4.35">away from the positives of this project</text>
  <text start="426.75" dur="5.88">and let&amp;#39;s look at the positives of this</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="7.41">project I mean first of all these guys</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="6.779">they have the balls to do this they have</text>
  <text start="436.47" dur="5.46">the balls to put a compilation book</text>
  <text start="439.409" dur="4.951">together and also make the time and</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="3.78">effort to do that because that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="3">thing in and of itself right there so</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="4.17">they have the courage they take the</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="5.85">effort make the effort take the time and</text>
  <text start="449.88" dur="5.879">put this out and it rises the charts and</text>
  <text start="453.21" dur="4.199">gets what I think number one book for a</text>
  <text start="455.759" dur="4.171">few days or a little bit there whatever</text>
  <text start="457.409" dur="4.79">it was so that&amp;#39;s awesome</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="5.459">you know props to them for doing that</text>
  <text start="462.199" dur="5.351">but at the very same time I do think the</text>
  <text start="465.389" dur="4.62">criticisms should be shared shared</text>
  <text start="467.55" dur="3.39">constructively like I said because I</text>
  <text start="470.009" dur="3.121">mean this is just a learning experience</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="3.87">for everybody here if we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="473.13" dur="4.409">continue down this path of all being</text>
  <text start="474.81" dur="5.25">authors and journalists and public</text>
  <text start="477.539" dur="4.081">figures trying to get out information we</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="3.72">got our refine our craft if you know</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="5.97">what I&amp;#39;m saying so criticisms of this</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="7.229">project first of all Flynn&amp;#39;s name</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="7.139">I saw them use a transcript of one of</text>
  <text start="491.009" dur="5.731">general Flynn&amp;#39;s speeches and they put</text>
  <text start="494.729" dur="3.99">his name on the book as if he was a</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="5.399">contributing person contributing author</text>
  <text start="498.719" dur="5.01">to the project and I don&amp;#39;t think he was</text>
  <text start="502.139" dur="4.53">as far as I know they didn&amp;#39;t really get</text>
  <text start="503.729" dur="5.851">his personal okay for that maybe they</text>
  <text start="506.669" dur="5.49">did or and I&amp;#39;m unaware but if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="4.8">gonna use transcripts of someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.159" dur="3.57">speech I don&amp;#39;t know is that is that</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="2.579">especially if they&amp;#39;re not getting there</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="3.48">okay is that taking their intellectual</text>
  <text start="516.959" dur="6.061">property you should definitely get there</text>
  <text start="519.209" dur="7.44">okay in that scenario second on the</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="5.759">about the author&amp;#39;s blurb that I saw they</text>
  <text start="526.649" dur="5.011">also labeled themselves as authorities</text>
  <text start="528.779" dur="5.671">on cue essentially how they wrote it</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="5.58">were the authorities on the subject</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="4.26">and again this is personal this is all</text>
  <text start="537.24" dur="3.48">subjective here I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="538.71" dur="5.39">are letting their subjective opinions</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="5.55">take away from the overall big picture</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="4.12">there&amp;#39;s a lot of wins with this but at</text>
  <text start="546.27" dur="3.3">the same time we need to get</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="2.64">professional we need to get very</text>
  <text start="549.57" dur="2.94">professional with how these do these</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="4.11">things if I had control of this</text>
  <text start="552.51" dur="4.02">compilation project I would have gone</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="2.94">about it probably a little bit more</text>
  <text start="556.53" dur="4.41">professionally taking a little bit more</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="6.38">time structured it but uh yeah anytime I</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="5.43">see authorities me myself I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="5.11">anti-authoritarian I kind of shy away</text>
  <text start="566.37" dur="6.03">from anybody who labels themselves as</text>
  <text start="569.4" dur="7.98">the authority or labels themselves as</text>
  <text start="572.4" dur="5.7">the Guru or the person to go to the</text>
  <text start="577.38" dur="5.43">end-all-be-all</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="6.75">right now if other people label a person</text>
  <text start="582.81" dur="3.03">or an organization as an authority you</text>
  <text start="584.85" dur="4.62">know that&amp;#39;s fine that&amp;#39;s their own</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="5.64">opinion but to label yourself that you</text>

  <text start="602.88" dur="2.85">sit with me well so like I said I would</text>
  <text start="604.53" dur="4.05">have I would have written some things</text>
  <text start="605.73" dur="5.28">differently on this and also I would</text>
  <text start="608.58" dur="5.61">have sourced it a little better I would</text>
  <text start="611.01" dur="5.22">have you know because with this sort of</text>

  <text start="624.84" dur="4.65">to spin it any which way they can so you</text>
  <text start="627.3" dur="5.09">have to source a work like this talking</text>
  <text start="629.49" dur="4.65">about these sort of conspiratorial</text>
  <text start="632.39" dur="2.89">heavy-hitting topics you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="634.14" dur="4.95">to source it really well you&amp;#39;re gonna to</text>
  <text start="635.28" dur="6.09">make it as credible as legitimate as a</text>
  <text start="639.09" dur="5.13">little leeway for people to deny it as</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="5.1">possible essentially and not just that</text>
  <text start="644.22" dur="4.62">but a lot of the work I saw some people</text>
  <text start="646.47" dur="4.2">get peeved because some of the graphics</text>
  <text start="648.84" dur="4.26">were sourced in there and it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="650.67" dur="4.74">really or put into the book and it</text>

  <text start="667.8" dur="3.3">stuff</text>
  <text start="668.16" dur="4.77">like this and as much as I disagree with</text>
  <text start="671.1" dur="3.63">much of what we learn in university and</text>
  <text start="672.93" dur="4.219">schooling there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>

  <text start="685.05" dur="6.089">people can go check it out and if you</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="3.99">use anybody else&amp;#39;s work make sure you</text>
  <text start="691.139" dur="3.39">source that as well so like I said</text>
  <text start="692.97" dur="3.479">multiple ways I think this could have</text>
  <text start="694.529" dur="3">been done better professionally but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.449" dur="2.041">all a learning experience it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="700.86" dur="6.029">I mean number one book on Amazon that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.05" dur="4.92">awesome that&amp;#39;s you know in having the</text>
  <text start="706.889" dur="3.18">courage to put it all together to</text>

  <text start="714.66" dur="3.15">that to weather the critic weather the</text>
  <text start="716.459" dur="5.07">storm of the criticisms but at the same</text>
  <text start="717.81" dur="6.389">time I do hope that they take some of</text>
  <text start="721.529" dur="5.31">these constructive criticisms some of</text>
  <text start="724.199" dur="4.171">the positive feedback in ways that they</text>
  <text start="726.839" dur="5.521">could do better I hope they take this to</text>
  <text start="728.37" dur="5.969">heart because it&amp;#39;s very easy for an</text>
  <text start="732.36" dur="3.57">individual to start getting criticism</text>
  <text start="734.339" dur="3.99">and then just say screw everybody and</text>
  <text start="735.93" dur="4.44">throw it all at the window and continue</text>
  <text start="738.329" dur="4.231">about as they were doing so I hope they</text>
  <text start="740.37" dur="6.839">learn from this</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="7.44">but hey national news getting the word</text>

  <text start="754.68" dur="2.61">guess talking about I&amp;#39;m gonna try to</text>
  <text start="756.24" dur="3.98">scroll through these comments a little</text>
  <text start="757.29" dur="5.46">bit see what you guys are discussing</text>
  <text start="760.22" dur="4.39">here but I guess we can get into some of</text>

  <text start="771.439" dur="5.65">hell and definitely needs to be</text>
  <text start="774.959" dur="4.291">discussed because some people are saying</text>
  <text start="777.089" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t talk about it a lot of other</text>
  <text start="779.25" dur="3.66">people of course mainstream media people</text>
  <text start="781.559" dur="4.2">unaware of the situation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="782.91" dur="3.899">thinking it was a actual issue I mean</text>
  <text start="785.759" dur="2.82">they don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything</text>
  <text start="786.809" dur="5.041">suspicious with it and they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="788.579" dur="5.61">with the official narrative so first and</text>
  <text start="791.85" dur="5.31">foremost the initial thing I mean of</text>
  <text start="794.189" dur="7.02">course it was almost instantly that we</text>
  <text start="797.16" dur="5.04">saw that or it was reported it was</text>
  <text start="801.209" dur="4.021">alleged</text>
  <text start="802.2" dur="4.35">again claimed a lot of people they run</text>
  <text start="805.23" dur="2.82">with these official narratives as if</text>
  <text start="806.55" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re fact and I&amp;#39;m just like wait wait</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="3.84">wait wait wait they&amp;#39;re saying he was</text>

  <text start="814.5" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;m like sitting here do we even have</text>
  <text start="817.05" dur="4.32">proof that he&amp;#39;s the one that wrote that</text>
  <text start="819.12" dur="5.54">damn manifesto and you have to take it</text>
  <text start="821.37" dur="7.02">to square one and ask the questions that</text>
  <text start="824.66" dur="5.8">don&amp;#39;t get that get assumed you know</text>
  <text start="828.39" dur="3.45">people assume these things because New</text>
  <text start="830.46" dur="3.98">York Times reported or the Washington</text>
  <text start="831.84" dur="5.25">Post reported but they don&amp;#39;t report any</text>
  <text start="834.44" dur="5.62">actual sauce with it any legitimate</text>
  <text start="837.09" dur="4.56">evidence so this shooter you know he</text>
  <text start="840.06" dur="3.36">goes into this I believe Muslim mosque</text>
  <text start="841.65" dur="5.64">and shoot up the place 49 people died</text>

  <text start="1453.48" dur="4.14">danger here familiar with able danger</text>
  <text start="1455.37" dur="8.25">they did some good research you can find</text>
  <text start="1457.62" dur="9.63">on sensors that probably could be hacked</text>
  <text start="1463.62" dur="6.3">but these sensors were actually it was</text>
  <text start="1467.25" dur="4.23">Hillary Clinton as the attorney that</text>
  <text start="1469.92" dur="3.84">helped these particular sensors get</text>

  <text start="1475.83" dur="6.36">sensor is now utilized on pretty much</text>
  <text start="1478.67" dur="8.17">I&amp;#39;m not gonna say all but probably most</text>
  <text start="1482.19" dur="9.96">aircraft and vehicles that use this</text>
  <text start="1486.84" dur="7.83">gyroscopic sensor to autopilot for the</text>

  <text start="1514.08" dur="4.44">hackable basically was it hacked was it</text>
  <text start="1517.08" dur="5.67">taken down we&amp;#39;ve been told seven out of</text>
  <text start="1518.52" dur="8.37">ten airplane crashes are suspicious</text>
  <text start="1522.75" dur="6.42">events not coincidences so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1526.89" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s just the way that this airplane</text>
  <text start="1529.17" dur="5.07">went down all these countries started</text>
  <text start="1531.63" dur="6.18">grounding it u.s. had to had to as well</text>
  <text start="1534.24" dur="5.67">maybe Trump had intelligence that yes</text>
  <text start="1537.81" dur="4.68">these planes were taken down or that</text>
  <text start="1539.91" dur="5.19">plane of Ethiopia was remotely hijacked</text>
  <text start="1542.49" dur="4.44">so grounded it to be safe which is good</text>
  <text start="1545.1" dur="3.84">but Boeing this sucks for Boeing</text>
  <text start="1546.93" dur="4.44">Boeing&amp;#39;s taking a huge hit on this I</text>
  <text start="1548.94" dur="5.13">find it intriguing here as well more</text>
  <text start="1551.37" dur="5.78">dots to connect in the coincidence</text>
  <text start="1554.07" dur="6.48">picture that when Trump was in Vietnam</text>
  <text start="1557.15" dur="4.77">at his North Korea summit at the end of</text>

  <text start="1565.02" dur="4.17">with Vietnam for a bunch of jets so huge</text>
  <text start="1567.48" dur="5.25">deal they&amp;#39;re being made as Trump was in</text>

  <text start="1576.81" dur="5.28">Boeing connections Boeing seems to be</text>
  <text start="1579.18" dur="5.19">friendly to call it the Alliance the</text>
  <text start="1582.09" dur="5.36">Trump administration if you will so was</text>
  <text start="1584.37" dur="6.27">this a sort of message retaliation you</text>
  <text start="1587.45" dur="5.14">know lots of suspicious things going on</text>
  <text start="1590.64" dur="3.33">with that crash I see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1592.59" dur="4.47">are dropping information in the comments</text>
  <text start="1593.97" dur="4.86">their questions their concerns looks</text>
  <text start="1597.06" dur="4.68">like their research which is great you</text>

  <text start="1608.68" dur="5.4">credible fact-based evidence-based but</text>
  <text start="1611.65" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s all about creating communities of</text>
  <text start="1614.08" dur="5.19">researchers and being citizen</text>
  <text start="1615.94" dur="5.27">journalists and sharing it all so Boeing</text>

  <text start="1857.2" dur="5.13">been implemented but that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1859.54" dur="5.19">overseen by the Air Force and what it</text>
  <text start="1862.33" dur="6">looks like the plan is to do is set up</text>
  <text start="1864.73" dur="5.16">the space force initially somewhat with</text>
  <text start="1868.33" dur="2.91">Air Force oversight but then eventually</text>
  <text start="1869.89" dur="3.27">create</text>
  <text start="1871.24" dur="4.17">whole new military branch with it that</text>
  <text start="1873.16" dur="5.7">that space Development Agency is then</text>
  <text start="1875.41" dur="4.59">going to be brought under so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1878.86" dur="3.78">difficult they&amp;#39;re having a difficult</text>
  <text start="1880" dur="4.74">time bringing the space force into</text>
  <text start="1882.64" dur="3.72">fruition there&amp;#39;s a lot of opposition in</text>
  <text start="1884.74" dur="5.28">Congress and in the Pentagon bureaucracy</text>
  <text start="1886.36" dur="4.71">that they don&amp;#39;t want it out they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1890.02" dur="4.32">want to know they&amp;#39;re citing a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1891.07" dur="5.67">different excuses even looked like the</text>
  <text start="1894.34" dur="4.17">former Air Force secretary that just</text>
  <text start="1896.74" dur="2.37">stepped down she just stepped down what</text>
  <text start="1898.51" dur="2.58">was her name</text>
  <text start="1899.11" dur="4.59">I believe her name was Heather Wilson</text>
  <text start="1901.09" dur="5.01">Air Force secretary just stepped down</text>
  <text start="1903.7" dur="4.68">and she kind of looked like she was</text>
  <text start="1906.1" dur="5.1">against it she left this memo slip out</text>
  <text start="1908.38" dur="4.89">that stated the price of the space force</text>
  <text start="1911.2" dur="5.609">would be thirteen billion dollars -</text>
  <text start="1913.27" dur="5.01">which Patrick Shanahan then said no no</text>
  <text start="1916.809" dur="3.211">no it&amp;#39;s not gonna be that much it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1918.28" dur="4.05">gonna be like three four five billion a</text>
  <text start="1920.02" dur="5.64">lot less so it&amp;#39;s as if the Air Force</text>
  <text start="1922.33" dur="8.13">secretary let that memo slip out of her</text>
  <text start="1925.66" dur="7.16">desk just to kind of attack attack the</text>
  <text start="1930.46" dur="4.59">idea of the space force in a subtle way</text>
  <text start="1932.82" dur="4.81">by saying it&amp;#39;s gonna be really expensive</text>
  <text start="1935.05" dur="4.59">when it&amp;#39;s really not going to be that</text>
  <text start="1937.63" dur="5.429">expensive so but she&amp;#39;s gone so we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="1939.64" dur="5.16">if that helps the space force come about</text>
  <text start="1943.059" dur="3.891">a little bit easier it&amp;#39;s just having a</text>
  <text start="1944.8" dur="5.79">difficult time because of the</text>
  <text start="1946.95" dur="5.41">democrat-controlled house but also at</text>
  <text start="1950.59" dur="3.69">that same note I mean we could see some</text>
  <text start="1952.36" dur="4.74">sort of another executive order take</text>
  <text start="1954.28" dur="6.24">place and Patrick Shanahan is still</text>
  <text start="1957.1" dur="5.97">there as acting head of the DoD and</text>
  <text start="1960.52" dur="5.58">looks like Trump and everybody else is</text>
  <text start="1963.07" dur="4.35">very happy with him there or there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1966.1" dur="4.44">reason he&amp;#39;s supposed to be there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1967.42" dur="6.69">purposeful work that he&amp;#39;s doing there he</text>
  <text start="1970.54" dur="5.85">you know I oversaw the audit the</text>
  <text start="1974.11" dur="3.51">completion of the audit and also was</text>
  <text start="1976.39" dur="3">overseeing the creation of the space</text>
  <text start="1977.62" dur="4.2">force so it looks like Shanahan is in</text>
  <text start="1979.39" dur="7.25">there for a lot of particular reasons</text>
  <text start="1981.82" dur="8.73">him being X Boeing X VP of Boeing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1986.64" dur="7.33">very you know experienced knowledgeable</text>
  <text start="1990.55" dur="5.25">in large corporations how they run where</text>
  <text start="1993.97" dur="4.92">a lot of money moves such as the</text>
  <text start="1995.8" dur="7.85">Pentagon and also Space Operations X VP</text>
  <text start="1998.89" dur="4.76">of Boeing what does he know about any uh</text>
  <text start="2003.879" dur="4.71">projects Boeing was involved in so I</text>
  <text start="2006.969" dur="4.14">think there&amp;#39;s very purposeful reasons</text>
  <text start="2008.589" dur="4.23">that Shanahan&amp;#39;s there because he&amp;#39;s has</text>
  <text start="2011.109" dur="3.27">experience with big matters that are</text>
  <text start="2012.819" dur="3.9">going on at the Pentagon right now in</text>
  <text start="2014.379" dur="8.64">regards to space and missing Pentagon</text>
  <text start="2016.719" dur="7.74">money but on that same note I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2023.019" dur="5.19">interested to see what&amp;#39;s gonna come out</text>
  <text start="2024.459" dur="4.92">of that a quantum initiative act I think</text>
  <text start="2028.209" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;ve been mentioning that in a few</text>
  <text start="2029.379" dur="5.73">videos lately quantum initiative act in</text>
  <text start="2032.979" dur="4.29">the quantum coordination office that was</text>
  <text start="2035.109" dur="6.3">just set up so I think that&amp;#39;s a big way</text>
  <text start="2037.269" dur="6.33">and the whole idea of quantum quantum a</text>
  <text start="2041.409" dur="4.29">lot of a lot for a lot of different</text>
  <text start="2043.599" dur="5.69">notions different connotations that word</text>
  <text start="2045.699" dur="7.41">brings but basically quantum being that</text>
  <text start="2049.289" dur="5.56">word that they&amp;#39;re gonna use call a lot</text>
  <text start="2053.109" dur="6.72">of these technologies like free energy</text>
  <text start="2054.849" dur="7.381">and point-to-point communication you</text>
  <text start="2059.829" dur="4.59">know what could we call it longitudinal</text>
  <text start="2062.23" dur="3.809">communication a lot of words are</text>
  <text start="2064.419" dur="5.311">difficult to describe these scientists</text>
  <text start="2066.039" dur="5.191">sciences and concepts but I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2069.73" dur="3.179">kind of how that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2071.23" dur="3.809">roll out a lot of these black project</text>
  <text start="2072.909" dur="5.51">technologies is through quote quantum</text>
  <text start="2075.039" dur="3.38">and then of course this space force</text>
  <text start="2079.5" dur="4.929">there&amp;#39;s a muffled quality from my mic</text>
  <text start="2082.659" dur="4.561">everybody give me a thumbs up if you can</text>

  <text start="2147.099" dur="5.69">long that their audience already knows</text>
  <text start="2149.369" dur="6.97">it&amp;#39;s like in the process of trying to</text>
  <text start="2152.789" dur="5.921">defame and discredit conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="2156.339" dur="5.371">they also have to educate their audience</text>

  <text start="2310.82" dur="7.92">2010 to 15 so China if you look at their</text>
  <text start="2316.16" dur="5.22">growth in technology if you look at the</text>
  <text start="2318.74" dur="8.49">past few years what they&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="2321.38" dur="8.96">into they are a lot of developments in</text>
  <text start="2327.23" dur="6.5">again quote quantum quantum being a big</text>
  <text start="2330.34" dur="6.97">umbrella term I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2333.73" dur="6.49">sort of misdescribed I know that kind of</text>
  <text start="2337.31" dur="4.26">quantum has a lot of different ways it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2340.22" dur="3.24">talked about a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="2341.57" dur="4.89">different meanings for quantum but China</text>
  <text start="2343.46" dur="4.35">basically creating a quantum radar rapid</text>
  <text start="2346.46" dur="3.3">developments in stealth technology</text>
  <text start="2347.81" dur="3.29">stealth technology has everything to do</text>
  <text start="2349.76" dur="6.36">with actually and anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="2351.1" dur="8.68">electrogravitics so that&amp;#39;s why a lot of</text>
  <text start="2356.12" dur="6.2">information about stealth technologies</text>
  <text start="2359.78" dur="6.78">is still kept very highly classified</text>
  <text start="2362.32" dur="6.78">because yeah we could do away with a lot</text>
  <text start="2366.56" dur="4.53">of petroleum with it and there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="2369.1" dur="5.83">industrial oil baron&amp;#39;s right now that</text>
  <text start="2371.09" dur="5.7">wouldn&amp;#39;t be happy but anyway so China</text>
  <text start="2374.93" dur="5.79">developing quantum radar developing</text>
  <text start="2376.79" dur="7.32">stealth technologies developing what</text>
  <text start="2380.72" dur="5.37">else openly saying they want to develop</text>
  <text start="2384.11" dur="4.77">underground facilities they also are</text>
  <text start="2386.09" dur="4.68">expanding into Antarctica of all places</text>
  <text start="2388.88" dur="4.68">your question was about underground</text>
  <text start="2390.77" dur="5.13">bases and Antarctica well yeah there has</text>
  <text start="2393.56" dur="6.93">been news about China getting into all</text>
  <text start="2395.9" dur="7.2">that sort of stuff so it&amp;#39;s as if into</text>
  <text start="2400.49" dur="4.17">the last 10 years we say 5 to 10 years</text>
  <text start="2403.1" dur="2.43">China has been very interested of course</text>
  <text start="2404.66" dur="3.03">then working with</text>
  <text start="2405.53" dur="5.04">the clowns in America China has been</text>
  <text start="2407.69" dur="5.96">very interested in the unacknowledged</text>

  <text start="2413.65" dur="5.29">that&amp;#39;s over here and it looks like</text>
  <text start="2416.12" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve been able to access a little bit</text>
  <text start="2418.94" dur="3.45">of intelligence it&amp;#39;s very intriguing to</text>

  <text start="2463.73" dur="4.14">was what the plan was going to be that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2466.19" dur="2.94">what what the plan was going to be if</text>
  <text start="2467.87" dur="3.72">Hillary Clinton would have gotten into</text>

  <text start="2484.82" dur="3.39">of Intel to</text>
  <text start="2485.68" dur="4.42">China was probably going to be built up</text>

  <text start="2497.36" dur="4.8">three was probably going to be China</text>
  <text start="2499.52" dur="4.14">versus America America gets gutted and</text>
  <text start="2502.16" dur="3.03">then China set up as the next big</text>
  <text start="2503.66" dur="2.76">superpower by the deep state you know</text>
  <text start="2505.19" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re always funding both sides of</text>
  <text start="2506.42" dur="7.17">maybe every war the shadow government</text>
  <text start="2509.66" dur="7.23">cabal so luckily we avoided that</text>
  <text start="2513.59" dur="6.18">timeline though didn&amp;#39;t we in November of</text>
  <text start="2516.89" dur="6.75">2016 with a certain election so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2519.77" dur="6.48">very good news but you know now the now</text>
  <text start="2523.64" dur="7.62">the power plays in played a stiff-arm</text>
  <text start="2526.25" dur="6.21">China and bring America back into its</text>
  <text start="2531.26" dur="6.51">super-powered position and then</text>
  <text start="2532.46" dur="6.04">essentially bring peace peace through</text>
  <text start="2537.77" dur="4.96">strength</text>
  <text start="2538.5" dur="7.25">peace through strength yeah now China</text>
  <text start="2542.73" dur="6.24">and Russia are allies against the Cabal</text>
  <text start="2545.75" dur="5.23">generally but in that same vein you know</text>
  <text start="2548.97" dur="4.53">you can&amp;#39;t generalize a whole country so</text>
  <text start="2550.98" dur="3.99">much like there&amp;#39;s deep state here in</text>
  <text start="2553.5" dur="4.71">America and there&amp;#39;s an alliance here in</text>
  <text start="2554.97" dur="5.22">America there&amp;#39;s really bad elements in</text>
  <text start="2558.21" dur="5.67">China and I would imagine good elements</text>
  <text start="2560.19" dur="6">- same with Russia so it&amp;#39;s kind of how</text>
  <text start="2563.88" dur="5.909">you have to look at it it&amp;#39;s you know the</text>
  <text start="2566.19" dur="5.31">kind of proportion of good and bad in</text>
  <text start="2569.789" dur="3.091">the particular country and in America</text>
  <text start="2571.5" dur="3.48">that proportion of good and bad used to</text>
  <text start="2572.88" dur="4.8">be a lot more bad than there was good or</text>
  <text start="2574.98" dur="5.25">the bad had much more control the rogue</text>
  <text start="2577.68" dur="6.179">elements had much more control here</text>
  <text start="2580.23" dur="5.849">years ago not so much now right yeah</text>
  <text start="2583.859" dur="6.421">good guys are getting a lot more control</text>
  <text start="2586.079" dur="6.21">access oversight power and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2590.28" dur="4.91">noticeable I mean if they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="2592.289" dur="5.461">public with something like Q even in</text>
  <text start="2595.19" dur="5.379">2017 the good guys had much more power</text>
  <text start="2597.75" dur="6.48">than the bad guys and it&amp;#39;s much more</text>
  <text start="2600.569" dur="5.071">safer for us citizen journalists to go</text>
  <text start="2604.23" dur="4.079">public and to be talking about a lot of</text>
  <text start="2605.64" dur="8.28">these things I think about Max Pearce</text>
  <text start="2608.309" dur="7.47">max Spears passing away in 2016 the</text>
  <text start="2613.92" dur="3.869">summer of 2016 and he was talking about</text>
