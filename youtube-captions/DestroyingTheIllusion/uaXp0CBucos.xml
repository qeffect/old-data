  <text start="61.21" dur="5.07">to ask you since you&amp;#39;re the expert in</text>
  <text start="63.519" dur="3.661">these fields a lot of volatility in the</text>
  <text start="66.28" dur="3.869">markets lately</text>
  <text start="67.18" dur="4.86">you know what&amp;#39;s your thoughts on the</text>
  <text start="70.149" dur="4.771">bankers are Wall Street purposefully</text>
  <text start="72.04" dur="5.31">crashing these markets just to spite the</text>
  <text start="74.92" dur="5.16">administration well you know he</text>
  <text start="77.35" dur="4.799">president Trump has has had a bone to</text>
  <text start="80.08" dur="4.56">pick with the Federal Reserve raising</text>
  <text start="82.149" dur="5.22">interest rates which is obviously</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="6.089">connected to to the banks and how money</text>
  <text start="87.369" dur="6.45">works so so that&amp;#39;s been something that</text>
  <text start="90.729" dur="5.551">that&amp;#39;s been on the top of his list the</text>
  <text start="93.819" dur="5.491">more interest rates go up the more</text>
  <text start="96.28" dur="4.979">expensive it is for companies and people</text>
  <text start="99.31" dur="4.77">to borrow money and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="101.259" dur="7.201">start to affect the economy when you</text>
  <text start="104.08" dur="5.91">look at these big jumps and these pull</text>
  <text start="108.46" dur="5.1">backs that we&amp;#39;ve seen and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="5.48">more one-day Corrections this year than</text>
  <text start="113.56" dur="5.399">we&amp;#39;ve seen I think in the past 30 years</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="6.489">the Dow dropped earlier this week 1,500</text>
  <text start="118.959" dur="6.3">points in one day so there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="121.959" dur="7.11">up and down and I think what it does is</text>
  <text start="125.259" dur="6.421">it starts to send a signal to the</text>
  <text start="129.069" dur="5.191">average American that maybe this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="131.68" dur="4.86">as strong this economy is not as strong</text>
  <text start="134.26" dur="4.5">as what people believe now there are a</text>
  <text start="136.54" dur="5.61">lot of good indicators unemployment is</text>

  <text start="143.739" dur="4.881">after that that are saying the economy</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="6.63">is doing okay but ultimately the big to</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="5.35">financial places where most people have</text>
  <text start="151.66" dur="4.53">their money is the stock market and</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="4.32">their home interest rates going up is</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="4.92">gonna affect home prices we are seeing</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="4.77">home values drop we are seeing home</text>
  <text start="161.11" dur="3.81">value homes sit on the market a lot</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="4.2">longer than we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past I</text>

  <text start="253" dur="5.43">good way to get out of the system and</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="6.299">make sure that you&amp;#39;re protected and have</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="4.59">something tangible and liquid in the</text>
  <text start="261.639" dur="4.081">event that the stock market pulls back</text>

  <text start="289.33" dur="3.57">five years ago I had my identity stolen</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="3.511">and I&amp;#39;m still trying to get things</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="3.72">figured out I&amp;#39;m still trying to get some</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="4.019">of the money that I lost there so it is</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="4.289">very difficult so getting something</text>
  <text start="298.449" dur="5.4">physical like precious metals that you</text>
  <text start="300.909" dur="5.581">all own or hold is a great way to</text>
  <text start="303.849" dur="4.711">protect yourself from those types of</text>
  <text start="306.49" dur="3.87">situations and you know right now at the</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="3.63">end of the year people are looking at</text>
  <text start="310.36" dur="3.66">their accounts and they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="4.83">know what I&amp;#39;ve been a bit optimistic</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="4.889">about the stock market and maybe with</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="3.13">these kind of volatility up and now</text>
  <text start="318.909" dur="2.651">maybe I needed</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="3.51">personally maybe I need to look into</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="4.23">something else and they can always give</text>
  <text start="323.66" dur="4.35">us a call and we can help them learn</text>
  <text start="325.79" dur="3.9">about precious metals aren&amp;#39;t the prices</text>
  <text start="328.01" dur="4.02">of gold really really low right now</text>
  <text start="329.69" dur="5.67">yeah the price of gold is is pretty</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="5.25">close to mining cost and you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="5.1">pretty interesting indicator right now</text>
  <text start="337.28" dur="6.15">palladium one of the four precious</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="6.75">metals allowed in an IRA actually went</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="6.72">above the price of gold for about about</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="6.39">30 minutes this in trading earlier this</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="6.06">week so palladium very sought-after</text>
  <text start="353.6" dur="4.29">industrial metal went a little bit</text>
  <text start="356.21" dur="4.35">higher to gold pulled back a little bit</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="4.62">below gold but palladium because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="4.17">using cleaning and catalytic converters</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s replacing platinum and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="364.73" dur="3.78">become such a desired metal most</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="3.87">companies are moving away from diesel</text>
  <text start="368.51" dur="4.14">engines or going to gas powered engines</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="4.35">and palladium is a big big component of</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="4.53">that they&amp;#39;re having a hard time finding</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="4.41">pleadian and so that you know the charts</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="3.96">are unbelievable in terms of</text>
  <text start="379.19" dur="5.82">profitability this year if you bought</text>
  <text start="381.14" dur="7.29">caladium in august 2 today it&amp;#39;s up about</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="5.73">45% in the last 4 months so that the</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="3.69">growth story is there and the</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="3.21">interesting thing is if you look at</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="5.01">mining out there they do think there</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="4.83">will be a shortage in 2020 so a lot of</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="3.87">people are buying it now because they</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="5.31">see there&amp;#39;s gonna be a rush you know</text>
  <text start="401" dur="5.73">coming up for the future right and I saw</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="4.68">in terms of gold gold hit a five-month</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="3.24">high just today and gold seems to be on</text>
  <text start="408.77" dur="2.97">the rise as well so it looks like</text>
  <text start="409.97" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what you invest in</text>
  <text start="411.74" dur="4.92">gold or palladium looks like it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="4.34">be a win yeah absolutely yeah I think</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="5.19">both metals right now are undervalued</text>
  <text start="418.33" dur="5.41">and and when you look at why investors</text>
  <text start="421.85" dur="3.99">why countries I mean this year if you</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="3.63">look at you know anyone could cause so</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="3.54">we can send you out this information but</text>
  <text start="427.37" dur="3.39">if you look at all the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.38" dur="4.47">buying gold we had Hungary and Poland</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="3.6">buy gold last year David Michael in 15</text>
  <text start="433.85" dur="2.55">years</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="3.21">why is hungry and Poland why are they</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="2.73">buying gold the reason they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="437.57" dur="3.3">gold is they&amp;#39;re afraid of the Europe</text>
  <text start="439.13" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re afraid of that currency so</text>
  <text start="440.87" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re pulling money out of their own</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="5.49">currency and putting it into real money</text>
  <text start="444.71" dur="4.86">into real gold and silver so you see</text>
  <text start="447.59" dur="3.6">these big institutions that can buy</text>
  <text start="449.57" dur="4.08">anything big countries that can buy</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="2.79">anything and they&amp;#39;re buying gold because</text>
  <text start="453.65" dur="2.67">it</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s a safe bet and they want to avoid</text>
  <text start="456.32" dur="4.95">all this volatility and sometimes you</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="3.6">have to take a duck-and-cover strategy</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="4.53">when it comes to your investment you</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t always be aggressive there is a</text>
  <text start="465.8" dur="4.86">point where you have to pull back and</text>
  <text start="467.63" dur="4.89">say is my downside risk higher than my</text>
  <text start="470.66" dur="3.21">profit potential and I think that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="3.45">people are seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="3.69">saying you know I gotta pull some some</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="3.42">of this risk off the table right out</text>
  <text start="477.56" dur="6.75">because I see something happening next</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="8.04">year and 2008 2007 2006 people remember</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="5.01">they had the same false optimism work</text>
  <text start="487.43" dur="3.81">you know you go you watch the news it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="3.93">never yeah stock markets never gonna</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="2.52">crash real estate markets never gonna go</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="4.02">down</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="5.91">guess what stock market crashed 2008 40%</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="4.41">pullback real estate market in some</text>
  <text start="499.67" dur="5.13">places that pullback even even higher</text>
  <text start="501.68" dur="5.64">than 40% so those two big assets that</text>
  <text start="504.8" dur="5.13">everybody holds lost 40 50 % of their</text>
  <text start="507.32" dur="5.19">value in a six month period so people</text>
  <text start="509.93" dur="4.77">are concerned right now they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="4.83">us and and you know we can still get</text>
  <text start="514.7" dur="4.11">account set up for higher raise we still</text>
  <text start="517.34" dur="3.18">have time but we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="3.87">time this year people are looking to do</text>
  <text start="520.52" dur="3.96">it because the last weekend here things</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="4.26">really shut down in the industry so if</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="4.08">anybody&amp;#39;s looking to get this started we</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="3.18">need to do it sooner or later if they</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="3.93">want to get it done that&amp;#39;s awesome and</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="3.99">then sort of a speculative question how</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="3.33">do you see the volatility of the markets</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="3.66">being in 2019</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="4.08">you know there&amp;#39;s no reason that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.77" dur="3.81">gonna change you know you have the</text>
  <text start="539.9" dur="3.57">biggest indicator if you look at</text>
  <text start="541.58" dur="3.78">fundamentals of the stock market if you</text>
  <text start="543.47" dur="3.9">look at the price Shiller index if</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="4.53">anybody looks us up they&amp;#39;ll look at</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ll see that the actual value of the</text>
  <text start="549.89" dur="3.86">stocks right now should be about half of</text>
  <text start="552.47" dur="4.05">where they are today so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.75" dur="6.19">everything above that is just a bullish</text>
