  <text start="11.95" dur="3.73">what&amp;#39;s going on ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="13.88" dur="3.27">long time no see</text>
  <text start="15.68" dur="3.06">haven&amp;#39;t done one of these videos in a</text>
  <text start="17.15" dur="5.219">few days and the reason being is because</text>
  <text start="18.74" dur="6.09">I moved so new home new apartment</text>
  <text start="22.369" dur="4.741">actually new blackboard behind me</text>
  <text start="24.83" dur="5.94">I went black so we&amp;#39;ll see if I go back</text>
  <text start="27.11" dur="5.699">or not and in an effort to recap</text>
  <text start="30.77" dur="4.05">basically what&amp;#39;s gone on the past week</text>
  <text start="32.809" dur="6">I&amp;#39;m gonna do my best to give you</text>
  <text start="34.82" dur="6.059">everything that I&amp;#39;m seeing and you know</text>
  <text start="38.809" dur="4.441">it&amp;#39;s pretty difficult being off the</text>
  <text start="40.879" dur="4.68">internet for just a couple days logging</text>
  <text start="43.25" dur="4.769">back on and seeing the all the craziness</text>
  <text start="45.559" dur="4.981">going on but you know I&amp;#39;ll do my best</text>
  <text start="48.019" dur="5.011">here to wade through it and the title of</text>
  <text start="50.54" dur="5.07">this one today is back to politics</text>
  <text start="53.03" dur="4.32">obviously back to these videos but same</text>
  <text start="55.61" dur="5.369"> different day</text>
  <text start="57.35" dur="6.12">and by that I don&amp;#39;t necessarily mean in</text>
  <text start="60.979" dur="4.5">a negative connotation where you know</text>
  <text start="63.47" dur="4.2">same should different day as most people</text>
  <text start="65.479" dur="4.291">say when they&amp;#39;re stuck in the same</text>
  <text start="67.67" dur="4.47">repetitive pattern of their life but</text>
  <text start="69.77" dur="5.519">what I mean by this is that same</text>
  <text start="72.14" dur="5.759">different day and that what I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="75.289" dur="7.83">unfold on not only a national but a</text>
  <text start="77.899" dur="7.65">global scale is what I&amp;#39;ve kind of been</text>
  <text start="83.119" dur="5.28">saying for a few weeks if not a couple</text>
  <text start="85.549" dur="5.971">months now and that I think we are</text>
  <text start="88.399" dur="5.271">seeing a systematic destruction of the</text>
  <text start="91.52" dur="5.37">deep state and of course it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="93.67" dur="5.71">obvious on a mainstream superficial</text>
  <text start="96.89" dur="4.079">level but when you look when you piece</text>
  <text start="99.38" dur="3.089">together all the dots and look behind</text>
  <text start="100.969" dur="3.36">the scenes behind those mainstream</text>
  <text start="102.469" dur="4.561">scenes I think that is very well the</text>
  <text start="104.329" dur="6.11">case and I will explain to you with this</text>
  <text start="107.03" dur="6.81">magic new blackboard I have here so and</text>
  <text start="110.439" dur="5.981">upgrade a little bit in the last week</text>
  <text start="113.84" dur="4.05">and a half right haven&amp;#39;t done these one</text>
  <text start="116.42" dur="3.449">of these videos in a few days</text>
  <text start="117.89" dur="4.289">lots of stuff has gone on in the last</text>
  <text start="119.869" dur="5.731">week and a half and we&amp;#39;ve had a big</text>
  <text start="122.179" dur="5.851">shake-up occur in the white house so as</text>
  <text start="125.6" dur="4.53">most of you probably know I know I know</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;m gonna be a bit late on a few of</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="4.11">these news stories but for those of you</text>
  <text start="132.26" dur="4.08">watching these videos of mine that</text>
  <text start="134.24" dur="4.02">aren&amp;#39;t plugged into any mainstream</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="3.869">source hey maybe some of this might</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="3.99">actually be news to you so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="140.209" dur="2.261">recap a little bit but in the last week</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="1.99">and</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="4.08">half we&amp;#39;ve had quite the shake-up in the</text>
  <text start="144.24" dur="5.16">White House the communications director</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="6.6">Sean Spicer you know about a week and a</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="5.52">half ago he resigned he quit and he was</text>
  <text start="153.15" dur="4.65">then replaced by a man named Anthony</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="6.48">scaramouche e so scaramouche II came in</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="6.29">he was a tough talker he set a lot of</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="5.01">crap about some people and because he</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="5.53">essentially brought the drama with him</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="6">that force the chief of staff</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="5.97">Reince Priebus out of there once Reince</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="6.18">Priebus was then forced out a new chief</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="4.86">of staff was sworn in just a couple days</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="5.64">ago by the name of John Kelly</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="5.91">so John Kelly he&amp;#39;s a no BS kind of guy</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="4.41">once he was sworn in</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="4.92">Anthony scaramouche II who is the</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="5.13">replacement to Sean Spicer was then</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="4.53">kicked out of there so a lot of things</text>
  <text start="193.77" dur="4.56">happen Sean Spicer is out scared Moochie</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="4.17">in scaramouche II was look like he was</text>
  <text start="198.33" dur="4.14">pivotal and getting Priebus out in there</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="5.04">pre missus replacement comes in fire</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="5.01">scare Meucci so of course when you look</text>
  <text start="205.02" dur="4.26">at it at a superficial level it seems</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="3.27">like there&amp;#39;s so much chaos in the White</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="4.26">House so many people come in and going</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="5.79">this huge turnover rate what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="6.84">well this is what I think&amp;#39;s going on I</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="6.6">think this guy scare Meucci was placed</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="5.37">in there with very specific orders and I</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="4.379">think he got his job done because what</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="3.75">was really interesting and when I was</text>
  <text start="227.519" dur="4.081">scouring all the news stories about what</text>
  <text start="229.5" dur="3.57">was going on right I read everything I</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t know in the read independent media</text>
  <text start="233.07" dur="5.88">but mainstream media too and I try to</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="5.97">wade through it all Sean Spicer was in</text>
  <text start="238.95" dur="4.56">the White House during this whole</text>
  <text start="240.72" dur="5.13">process like in the White House advising</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="6.03">them he was advising people in the White</text>
  <text start="245.85" dur="7.77">House during his own replacement by</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="6.81">stair Moochie and scare Muji&amp;#39;s houst so</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="5.489">he was there through the hiring and</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="6.08">firing of his replacement and not only</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="5.881">this scare Moochie I believe I was</text>
  <text start="262.43" dur="5.76">watching the news or I read something</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="7.2">where he was actually totally okay with</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="5.77">his firing scare Moochie was so why</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="3.84">would Spicer be there through the whole</text>
  <text start="273.96" dur="4.65">process why would scare Moochie be</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="5.34">you know all hunky-dory with his firing</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="5.19">well this looked like it was a big plan</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="5.64">just to give Priebus out of there so</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="4.89">that chief of staff position right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.01" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s being cleansed inside the White</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="7.74">House with its it&amp;#39;s systematically being</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="6.33">cleansed to get the leakers and get the</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="4.95">people who aren&amp;#39;t on board with making</text>
  <text start="298.92" dur="5.22">America great again out of there do you</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="4.92">see so that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s going on so</text>
  <text start="304.14" dur="4.56">we seem to have the chief of staff being</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="4.89">reined in right that that cleansing</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="5.22">occurs and while this cleansing is</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="5.21">occurring right we&amp;#39;re having a lot of</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="5.73">what we would call special councils or</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="6.36">probings being called for or being</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="7.17">initiated so we had the House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="322.76" dur="7.15">Committee - did you call for a special</text>
  <text start="326.82" dur="5.94">counsel to investigate former FBI</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="5.61">director James Comey former attorney</text>
  <text start="332.76" dur="5.28">general under Obama Loretta Lynch and</text>
  <text start="335.52" dur="4.41">Hillary Clinton not only do we have this</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="3.66">special counsel being created but we</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="5.79">have another one that I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="7.01">write down where we have a watchdog</text>
  <text start="345.72" dur="6.18">group asking Congress to probe</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="7.63">representative Wasserman Schultz for the</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="6.72">firing of her IT aide a lawn Imran Awan</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="5.04">remember he was just arrested he was</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="4.89">that IT aide who the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="361.38" dur="4.17">Committee had hired who was paid an</text>
  <text start="363.51" dur="4.26">extraordinary amount and is implicated</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="4.37">in all kinds of not only banking fraud</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="5.43">which is he was he was arrested for but</text>
  <text start="369.92" dur="7.24">actual wiretapping very you know</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="6.51">treasonous stuff so the representative</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="6.33">who had hired Imran Awan box Minh</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="5.79">Schultz might be being investigated okay</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="4.35">so now that we have this special counsel</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="4.08">we have watchdog group call asking</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="5.18">Congress to probe Wasserman Schultz</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="6.39">right so a lot of stuff is going down</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="4.51">while this whole cleansing process in</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="4.23">the White House occurs so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="5.58">going on on a national put a political</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="4.56">level now let&amp;#39;s look at the global scale</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="3.99">a little bit right let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="404.76" dur="4.59">Russia in the u.s. there&amp;#39;s over the past</text>
  <text start="407.1" dur="4.77">week there&amp;#39;s been all this talk of</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="6.24">tensions going on you know just a couple</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="6.51">days ago we had Russia retaliate for the</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="5.64">sanctions by cutting their diplomatic</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="5.97">staff by like 750 so in Russia they</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="7.11">literally kicked out 750 embassy workers</text>
  <text start="424.35" dur="6.27">out of the country American ones and now</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.44">the u.s. begins Russia draw down after</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="3.6">Kremlin retaliate says so there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="432.78" dur="3.42">this like back and forth going on the</text>
  <text start="434.22" dur="7.02">past three week between Russia and the</text>
  <text start="436.2" dur="6.78">US but again on a superficial level what</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="3.54">did I say in my very I think was the</text>
  <text start="442.98" dur="4.14">very first whiteboard video I even did</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="4.35">it was Trump and Putin are trolling the</text>
  <text start="447.12" dur="5.01">world it&amp;#39;s my most popular video my</text>
  <text start="449.13" dur="7.53">theory my thesis in that video was that</text>
  <text start="452.13" dur="6.15">on a superficial level Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="456.66" dur="4.17">look like they&amp;#39;re going at each other</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="5.28">but behind the scenes they&amp;#39;re very well</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="6.09">working with each other while the deep</text>
  <text start="463.56" dur="5.34">state is cleansed right and I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="466.92" dur="4.29">holding by that theory I think Trump and</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="4.14">Putin are working together you saw how</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="5.31">they were laughing at those g20 meetings</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="8.61">right well now they hate each other</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="7.86">it&amp;#39;s weird I don&amp;#39;t think they do so this</text>
  <text start="481.65" dur="5.28">has to happen right you would wonder</text>
  <text start="484.38" dur="3.96">okay with they don&amp;#39;t actually hate each</text>
  <text start="486.93" dur="3.69">other why is it look like that on the</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="4.86">surface well this needs to happen</text>
  <text start="490.62" dur="6.6">because if they didn&amp;#39;t have that fake</text>
  <text start="493.2" dur="8.85">feud to the public right then the deep</text>
  <text start="497.22" dur="6.81">state would be able to run with this</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="3.39">Russia story that they keep trying to</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="3.39">paint right because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="505.44" dur="3.69">paint Russia as being these hackers and</text>
  <text start="507.42" dur="5.01">helping Trump get elected and all this</text>
  <text start="509.13" dur="5.789">stuff Russia didn&amp;#39;t hack and Russia</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t help Trump get elected now</text>
  <text start="514.919" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re happy right Putin and Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="3.66">happy Trump got in there because if it</text>
  <text start="518.7" dur="5">was Clinton we would basically be asking</text>
  <text start="520.86" dur="5.46">for World War 3 probably in and already</text>
  <text start="523.7" dur="4.75">so Russia didn&amp;#39;t do all the things they</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="4.41">said but if Russia in the US were</text>
  <text start="528.45" dur="4.38">working together right in the public</text>
  <text start="530.73" dur="3.66">domain well then all of these lies that</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="4.8">the corporate media in the deep started</text>
  <text start="534.39" dur="5.04">trying to spread they would look like it</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="3.3">would have traction behind them so they</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="3.12">have to make it look like there&amp;#39;s a feud</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="3.3">on the surface so there&amp;#39;s no traction</text>
  <text start="542.55" dur="3.93">behind these lies the deep state of</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="4.65">spreading right the the russia russians</text>
  <text start="546.48" dur="3.539">did it lie but behind the scenes they</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="3">are working together and i don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="550.019" dur="3.331">problem with that in fact if Russia and</text>
  <text start="551.88" dur="3.149">the US wanted team up to take down the</text>
  <text start="553.35" dur="4.29">the deep state or the New World Order</text>
  <text start="555.029" dur="5.041">then so be it but that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="4.53">so meanwhile while this fake Russia US</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="5.37">feud is going on the deep state is being</text>
  <text start="562.17" dur="8.789">cleansed out of the White House we have</text>
  <text start="565.44" dur="7.29">I believe not only this but Trump was</text>
  <text start="570.959" dur="6">calling out sessions for not doing</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="6.03">enough to investigate Clinton right we</text>
  <text start="576.959" dur="4.38">have all these probes going on and</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="4.23">lastly the last thing I want to make a</text>
  <text start="581.339" dur="3.18">note of here I mean again there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="3.27">many things I could bring into it but I</text>
  <text start="584.519" dur="5.341">don&amp;#39;t want to make this a thirty minute</text>
  <text start="586.26" dur="8.97">video one thing I saw just this morning</text>
  <text start="589.86" dur="9.27">was that this alleged lawsuit I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="595.23" dur="7.71">say alleged lawsuit was basically saying</text>
  <text start="599.13" dur="6.06">that Fox News in tandem with Trump made</text>
  <text start="602.94" dur="7.649">up they completely fabricated this whole</text>
  <text start="605.19" dur="9.089">separate story just to distract people</text>
  <text start="610.589" dur="4.951">from the Russia thing so what kind of</text>
  <text start="614.279" dur="3.541"> is this</text>
  <text start="615.54" dur="4.71">right we all know that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="617.82" dur="5.4">media the corporate deep state</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="5.67">controlled mainstream media fabricated</text>
  <text start="623.22" dur="5.309">the Russia story to distract from things</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="4.47">like Seth Rich and like Imran Awan and</text>
  <text start="628.529" dur="3.091">like all those stories that are blowing</text>
  <text start="630.39" dur="3.96">up</text>
  <text start="631.62" dur="4.62">you know underground per se on the</text>
  <text start="634.35" dur="4.44">alternative media all the stuff that</text>

  <text start="686.17" dur="4.02">local Fox News affiliate in DC and was</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="3.99">talking about the Seth rich story couple</text>
  <text start="690.19" dur="5.22">months ago he was a homicide detective</text>
  <text start="692.62" dur="4.5">and a private investigator he was</text>
  <text start="695.41" dur="3.93">talking all about the Seth rich story</text>
  <text start="697.12" dur="4.17">even on his Twitter lately right it</text>
  <text start="699.34" dur="3.54">wasn&amp;#39;t like a one-time thing he was</text>
  <text start="701.29" dur="5.73">discussing it he&amp;#39;s been tweeting about</text>
  <text start="702.88" dur="6.69">it and all that stuff yet in these</text>
  <text start="707.02" dur="4.53">stories these so-called the so-called</text>
  <text start="709.57" dur="4.98">lawsuit they claimed it was rod wheeler</text>
  <text start="711.55" dur="5.22">that filed the lawsuit so I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="714.55" dur="3.78">say I don&amp;#39;t know if this is true or not</text>
  <text start="716.77" dur="3.51">this could be a completely fabricated</text>
  <text start="718.33" dur="3.9">lawsuit that they&amp;#39;re trying to make up</text>
  <text start="720.28" dur="3.27">about rod wheeler because if you check</text>
  <text start="722.23" dur="5.46">rod wheelers Twitter</text>
  <text start="723.55" dur="6.21">this guy&amp;#39;s tweeting about Seth rich he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="727.69" dur="4.44">tweeting about the Amin brothers Imran</text>
  <text start="729.76" dur="8.37">Awan being arrested he even cryptically</text>
  <text start="732.13" dur="8.1">said on July 26 after Awan was arrested</text>
  <text start="738.13" dur="5.13">he said followed the arrest of a wand</text>
  <text start="740.23" dur="5.81">closely connect the dots to and he</text>
  <text start="743.26" dur="5.46">quotes other cases hint-hint in</text>
  <text start="746.04" dur="6.31">parentheses just the beginning stay</text>
  <text start="748.72" dur="8.25">tuned so it looks very well to be that</text>
  <text start="752.35" dur="6.39">the Alon case he is saying is going to</text>
  <text start="756.97" dur="5.46">lead to other cases like Seth Ridge</text>
  <text start="758.74" dur="6.03">being exposed but yet NPR and CNN are</text>
  <text start="762.43" dur="4.89">all claiming that rod wheeler filed this</text>
  <text start="764.77" dur="5.22">lawsuit to say that the separate story</text>
  <text start="767.32" dur="5.06">was made up makes no sense so it looks</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="6.57">very well to be like the MSM is</text>
  <text start="772.38" dur="6.19">completely not only making up the</text>
  <text start="776.56" dur="3.84">lawsuit which I couldn&amp;#39;t find really</text>
  <text start="778.57" dur="4.49">anything about but also making up the</text>
  <text start="780.4" dur="5.43">fact that what it was broad wheeler that</text>
  <text start="783.06" dur="4.12">filed it so it could be the case I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="787.18" dur="3.39">more information about this lawsuit the</text>
  <text start="788.77" dur="4.68">details surrounding it but it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="790.57" dur="6.18">early on but I think it&amp;#39;s of course just</text>
