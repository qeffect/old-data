  <text start="8.179" dur="5.17">hey there guys welcome back to another</text>
  <text start="10.769" dur="4.141">one of my whiteboard videos and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="13.349" dur="2.521">excited to be doing this one for you</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="3.27">because this is a topic I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="15.87" dur="4.919">meaning to do a whiteboard video on for</text>
  <text start="18.18" dur="4.65">a while now and that is the secret space</text>
  <text start="20.789" dur="4.261">program now this is one of the most</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="4.32">fascinating subjects I mean you just</text>
  <text start="25.05" dur="3.569">hear the words secret space and program</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="3.6">together and your imagination can run</text>
  <text start="28.619" dur="5.131">wild but it&amp;#39;s also one of the most</text>
  <text start="30.75" dur="5.219">important important because and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="33.75" dur="3.719">see why how much money and what kind of</text>
  <text start="35.969" dur="4.381">technologies are locked away in these</text>
  <text start="37.469" dur="6.421">projects and it&amp;#39;s also I find to be one</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="6.84">of the most unknown subjects that there</text>
  <text start="43.89" dur="7.43">is out there and a lot of dots within</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="6.36">this subject are crucial to know in</text>
  <text start="51.32" dur="3.669">trying to formulate your reality and</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="5.04">understand why the world is the way it</text>
  <text start="54.989" dur="7.951">is so I&amp;#39;m gonna make this as succinct as</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="6.389">I can for you guys and also as credible</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="3.42">because a lot of people always ask you</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="3.451">know when it comes to the secret space</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="3.6">program topic or even extra strolls</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re like evidence right evidence</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="4.26">evidence evidence where is it well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.18" dur="4.17">out there there&amp;#39;s a lot of it you know</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s plenty of books and articles</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="8.73">interviews and everything so of course</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="6.9">you&amp;#39;re watching my video here and as I</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="5.52">always do I&amp;#39;ll be linking plenty of good</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="5.94">resources in the description below this</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="5.879">video resources that have helped me and</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="5.43">that I think will help you in your</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="5.661">continuing education of this topic and</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="5.67">one of those resources that I find</text>
  <text start="102.14" dur="4.33">extremely credible and extremely amazing</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="3.93">as the testimony of the late William</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="6.75">Tompkins if you don&amp;#39;t know who William</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="6.21">Tompkins is he is a whistleblower</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="2.789">I&amp;#39;m calling him a whistleblower even</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="3.36">though he didn&amp;#39;t like to be called that</text>
  <text start="116.009" dur="4.201">but we&amp;#39;re gonna call him for sake of the</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="5.67">argument a whistleblower who actually</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="6.269">worked in a secret think tank for</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="5.939">Douglas Aircraft Company in the 1950s</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="5.951">literally designing spacecraft for the</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="4.661">United States Navy and before</text>
  <text start="132.43" dur="5.179">that he worked in naval intelligence</text>
  <text start="134.59" dur="6.179">during World War two literally</text>
  <text start="137.609" dur="5.921">debriefing Navy spies that were embedded</text>
  <text start="140.769" dur="4.92">in Germany&amp;#39;s secret space programs that</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="3.959">they had during World War two and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="145.689" dur="3.931">talk a little bit more about Germany&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.489" dur="4.681">involvement in all of this but William</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="6">Tompkins testimony is just mind-blowing</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="5.399">and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s fascinating so I suggest</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="3.66">you go check it out and if you would</text>
  <text start="157.569" dur="2.28">like to if you&amp;#39;re like me to tell you</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="2.64">about it</text>
  <text start="159.849" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;ll be doing a webinar later this month</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="6.39">devoted to him so I&amp;#39;ll be doing a</text>
  <text start="164.079" dur="7.02">presentation on Tompkins story and how</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="6.359">he is literally a almost a beginning</text>
  <text start="171.099" dur="6.931">pillar in secret space programs and I</text>
  <text start="174.669" dur="5.43">was lucky enough to be able to sit down</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="4.439">with him and conduct the very last</text>
  <text start="180.099" dur="4.411">interview that he ever did before he</text>
  <text start="182.469" dur="4.711">passed synchronistically on the day of</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="5.339">the Eclipse last in August but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="5.339">also be releasing that interview at that</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="6.48">webinar so if you would like a lot</text>
  <text start="192.519" dur="6.75">deeper of a discussion on this topic go</text>
  <text start="196.329" dur="7.231">check that webinar out but anyway as for</text>
  <text start="199.269" dur="6.9">now let&amp;#39;s get into all of this so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="4.98">gonna go through three topics and then</text>
  <text start="206.169" dur="3.93">as you can see in red here I have a few</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="4.649">bullet points in each of these topics</text>
  <text start="210.099" dur="7.081">we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss how the technology</text>
  <text start="213.189" dur="7.44">was obtained by the military industrial</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="6.449">complex if you will of this planet to</text>
  <text start="220.629" dur="7.801">make different secret space programs and</text>
  <text start="223.629" dur="6.931">also the side note here it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="3.809">secret space programs but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="4.649">what&amp;#39;s underground there&amp;#39;s a lot of deep</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="4.65">underground military bases or dumbs that</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="4.74">are involved in all of these secret</text>
  <text start="236.889" dur="4.291">black projects as well but anyway we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="239.949" dur="5.76">talk about how they got the technology</text>
  <text start="241.18" dur="8.009">we&amp;#39;ll talk about how these factions got</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="5.941">the money to build out these programs</text>
  <text start="249.189" dur="5.341">both underground and above our heads and</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="5.459">then also we&amp;#39;ll talk about how it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="254.53" dur="3.78">been kept secret and this might be one</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="2.97">of the most important things to talk</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="3.63">about because when talking about the</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="5.191">secret space program it&amp;#39;s difficult for</text>
  <text start="261.94" dur="7.319">people to comprehend how projects</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="6.81">vast in scope are kept secret so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="269.259" dur="3.451">talk about how they are connecting dots</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="2.429">for you</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="4.109">but first before I get at all this I</text>
  <text start="274.509" dur="5.431">just want to go over if you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="276.819" dur="6.181">heard about the secret space program or</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="3.81">the SSP as we&amp;#39;ll call it to save time</text>
  <text start="283" dur="5.419">and oxygen</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="6.9">what is the SSP it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="288.419" dur="6.041">ultra-secret projects</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="6.15">oh and by calling the deep state the</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="4.079">military industrial complex you know the</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="3.81">new world order of you what everyone</text>
  <text start="298.539" dur="4.5">call them ultra secret projects owned by</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="4.98">the deep state with very advanced</text>
  <text start="303.039" dur="5.731">science and technology and not just</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="6.03">advanced but it&amp;#39;s science and technology</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s almost completely opposite as to</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="3.93">whatever we&amp;#39;re told</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="5.279">whatever we&amp;#39;re brainwashed with by our</text>
  <text start="315.55" dur="5.22">mainstream media and science and</text>
  <text start="318.159" dur="4.201">educational institutions so keep that in</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="4.38">mind it&amp;#39;s not just advanced it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="4.019">ass backwards so all secret projects</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="3.989">owned by the deep state with advanced</text>
  <text start="326.379" dur="5.04">science technology kept outside public</text>
  <text start="329.139" dur="3.27">and government knowledge so not only</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="4.05">public knowledge</text>
  <text start="332.409" dur="4.5">granted oh if it&amp;#39;s how is it secret</text>
  <text start="335.469" dur="3.48">anymore if you&amp;#39;re talking about it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="336.909" dur="3.721">so secret now hahaha that jokes out of</text>
  <text start="338.949" dur="4.351">the way so it&amp;#39;s not only kept outside</text>
  <text start="340.63" dur="4.74">public knowledge but government</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="5.94">knowledge as well and again we&amp;#39;ll talk a</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="5.729">little bit more about why and the</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="3.62">secrecy the compartmentalization of it</text>
  <text start="351.099" dur="4.13">all but by government knowledge</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="4.929">basically it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s kept outside</text>
  <text start="355.229" dur="4.541">Congress&amp;#39;s consciousness a lot of them</text>
  <text start="357.789" dur="5.571">are unaware of it it&amp;#39;s even kept outside</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="8.07">a lot of president&amp;#39;s knowledge as well</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="8.649">so I mean these these programs are ultra</text>
  <text start="367.84" dur="6.329">secret right and there&amp;#39;s been a lot of</text>
  <text start="372.009" dur="4.201">people silenced over them as well yeah</text>
  <text start="374.169" dur="5.191">we&amp;#39;ll discuss that but anyway getting</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="6.12">into now the information regarding it</text>
  <text start="379.36" dur="5.72">all so first let&amp;#39;s discuss how they</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="6.54">actually got the science and technology</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="8.5">to create their super secret spaceships</text>
  <text start="388.87" dur="8.25">with and first let&amp;#39;s discuss Germany so</text>
  <text start="393.58" dur="4.889">this is going to be a little bit of</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="4.079">history</text>
  <text start="398.469" dur="7.92">of course there&amp;#39;s tons of history we</text>
  <text start="401.199" dur="8.071">have to unlearn and then relearn and at</text>
  <text start="406.389" dur="5.55">least in terms of the modern secret</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="4.139">space program the secret space programs</text>
  <text start="411.939" dur="3.78">over the last hundred years they</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="6.87">originate pretty much in Germany so in</text>
  <text start="415.719" dur="6.29">the early 1900s in the 20s and 30s and</text>
  <text start="420.279" dur="8.16">up until World War two</text>
  <text start="422.009" dur="9.75">Germany was much more invested in what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.439" dur="6.69">called qualitative superiority over</text>
  <text start="431.759" dur="6.491">quantitative superiority and qualitative</text>
  <text start="435.129" dur="6.481">superiority means basically advanced</text>
  <text start="438.25" dur="5.879">technology and quantitative superiority</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="4.079">means quantity boots on the ground so</text>
  <text start="444.129" dur="4.26">the Axis powers</text>
  <text start="445.689" dur="3.69">meaning Germany wanted they thought they</text>
  <text start="448.389" dur="3.691">could win the war with advanced</text>
  <text start="449.379" dur="4.71">technology the Allied powers they wanted</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="3.57">boots on the ground America they kept</text>
  <text start="454.089" dur="2.61">making tanks kept making bombs they</text>
  <text start="455.65" dur="4.019">think they thought they could win the</text>
  <text start="456.699" dur="4.921">war with that so because Germany was</text>
  <text start="459.669" dur="6.691">much more interested in the qualitative</text>
  <text start="461.62" dur="8.25">aspect of power building they were very</text>
  <text start="466.36" dur="5.669">interested in occult knowledge in a cult</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="4.889">in this instance just meaning hidden s</text>
  <text start="472.029" dur="6.48">or esoteric if you will but basically</text>
  <text start="474.759" dur="5.52">hidden knowledge that most people in the</text>
  <text start="478.509" dur="4.31">public would find crazy things like</text>
  <text start="480.279" dur="4.41">Atlantis things like you know ancient</text>
  <text start="482.819" dur="5.19">civilizations and the technologies they</text>
  <text start="484.689" dur="5.641">had well in German secret societies and</text>
  <text start="488.009" dur="4.451">era at the top levels in the elite of</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="4.079">Germany they took like it took that</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="4.049">extremely seriously</text>
  <text start="494.409" dur="3.901">so they actually sent expeditions around</text>
  <text start="496.509" dur="4.171">the world to obtain that knowledge they</text>
  <text start="498.31" dur="4.74">went for instance to Tibet to find</text>
  <text start="500.68" dur="3.87">ancient scrolls and texts and scriptures</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="4.829">and bring that back to Germany and</text>
  <text start="504.55" dur="6.479">decode that and you know I kind of</text>
  <text start="507.879" dur="5.1">dropped a couple seeds and hints there</text>
  <text start="511.029" dur="5.31">when I said modern secret space program</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="6.331">if you actually go read the Vedic</text>
  <text start="516.339" dur="5.7">scriptures from India there is reference</text>
  <text start="519.31" dur="6.269">to ancient flying ships that they had</text>
  <text start="522.039" dur="6.001">called Vimanas you see so Germany knew</text>
  <text start="525.579" dur="3.961">that and that&amp;#39;s who you know they took</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="2.97">very seriously and that&amp;#39;s why they went</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="2.22">to find it so that&amp;#39;s one way that they</text>
  <text start="531.01" dur="2.33">were obtained</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="4.92">able to obtain some of this knowledge</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="3.97">another way was a woman named maria</text>
  <text start="536.68" dur="4.86">orsic</text>
  <text start="537.31" dur="7.47">so maria orsic actually channeled</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="5.88">information from extra-strong entities</text>
  <text start="544.78" dur="6.77">and this information was on how to build</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="8.61">a spaceship now of course maria orsic</text>
  <text start="551.55" dur="8.08">when she channeled this she was doing it</text>
  <text start="556.03" dur="5.19">for peaceful means so who the germans</text>
  <text start="559.63" dur="2.97">said oh yeah we&amp;#39;ll work with you for</text>
  <text start="561.22" dur="6.12">peaceful means this is just gonna be for</text>
  <text start="562.6" dur="6.45">travel but the Nazis and SS and various</text>
  <text start="567.34" dur="3.69">secret societies in Germany they of</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="3.75">course subvert of that and then</text>
  <text start="571.03" dur="3.24">weaponized a lot of that technology but</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="3.57">anyway maria orsic</text>
  <text start="574.27" dur="4.14">channeled this and she channeled it for</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="4.89">a secret society in germany called the</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="5.55">real brill society so maria orsic</text>
  <text start="581.26" dur="5.28">channeled for the rural society and then</text>
  <text start="583.96" dur="5.7">another way that germany was able to</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="5.88">obtain the science was through a</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="7.58">technology exchange and that technology</text>
  <text start="592.42" dur="7.38">exchange occurred with very negative</text>
  <text start="597.24" dur="5.47">extraterrestrials namely the reptilian</text>
  <text start="599.8" dur="6.27">species so because the reptilians being</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="6.57">so negative and conquest oriented they</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="6.27">aligned very well with german secret</text>
  <text start="609.28" dur="6.93">society and Nazi ideals where they also</text>
  <text start="612.34" dur="6.78">wanted to conquer so because of them</text>
  <text start="616.21" dur="5.22">being so similar they made a pact where</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="5.43">the reptilians would basically hand down</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="3.72">some saucer craft and some technology to</text>
  <text start="624.55" dur="3.72">the Germans</text>
  <text start="625.15" dur="7.62">if the Germans would conquer the world</text>
  <text start="628.27" dur="5.94">and of course give them some humans and</text>
  <text start="632.77" dur="3.75">other stuff with the Galactica slave</text>
  <text start="634.21" dur="5.49">during the process but anyway we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.52" dur="6.12">get to that dark stuff so those three</text>
  <text start="639.7" dur="5.37">ways namely were the main ways that</text>
  <text start="642.64" dur="4.98">Germany was able to obtain this</text>
  <text start="645.07" dur="4.8">technology and of course I mentioned</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="7.2">earlier the qualitative and quantitative</text>
  <text start="649.87" dur="8.49">aspect of it so during World War two the</text>
  <text start="654.82" dur="6.99">Germans weren&amp;#39;t able to weaponize this</text>
  <text start="658.36" dur="5.62">technology enough in Europe to beat back</text>
  <text start="661.81" dur="5.11">the Americans at least</text>
  <text start="663.98" dur="4.32">first the Allied powers with more boots</text>
  <text start="666.92" dur="3.48">on the ground and more tanks were able</text>
  <text start="668.3" dur="4.74">to beat Germany out of Europe but</text>
  <text start="670.4" dur="6.3">Germany then took their technology down</text>
  <text start="673.04" dur="6.27">down to Antarctica so in their research</text>
  <text start="676.7" dur="6.84">of the occult knowledge they found out</text>
  <text start="679.31" dur="6.45">about the history of Antarctica and how</text>
  <text start="683.54" dur="3.84">Antarctica actually has a lot of ancient</text>
  <text start="685.76" dur="3.87">civilization and stuff buried under the</text>
  <text start="687.38" dur="3.63">ice there and giant caverns under the</text>
  <text start="689.63" dur="5.94">ice when they could take a lot of their</text>
  <text start="691.01" dur="5.96">technology to write so Germany because</text>
  <text start="695.57" dur="4.83">they were didn&amp;#39;t beat back in Europe in</text>
  <text start="696.97" dur="4.42">the late 30s and early 40s began taking</text>
  <text start="700.4" dur="6.69">a bunch of their stuff down to</text>
  <text start="701.39" dur="7.11">Antarctica and then you can research</text>
  <text start="707.09" dur="4.56">into for instance operation Highjump</text>
  <text start="708.5" dur="5.73">where the Americans figured out that the</text>
  <text start="711.65" dur="5.1">Germans through took their stuff today</text>
  <text start="714.23" dur="4.8">down to Antarctica through the spies</text>
  <text start="716.75" dur="5.4">that I mentioned earlier that the</text>
  <text start="719.03" dur="5.64">Americans had in Germany and then the</text>
  <text start="722.15" dur="5.28">Americans sent an expedition led by</text>
  <text start="724.67" dur="5.61">Admiral Richard Byrd called operation</text>
  <text start="727.43" dur="5.76">Highjump 20 arctica Admiral Byrd got his</text>
  <text start="730.28" dur="5.22">ass kicked and then the Germans were</text>
  <text start="733.19" dur="3.99">able to infiltrate into America bring a</text>
  <text start="735.5" dur="5.88">bunch of their scientists and</text>
  <text start="737.18" dur="6.78">researchers and officials into America</text>
  <text start="741.38" dur="3.69">through Operation Paperclip and you know</text>
  <text start="743.96" dur="3.24">long long story</text>
  <text start="745.07" dur="3.96">huge relearning of history that the mass</text>
  <text start="747.2" dur="4.17">public needs to know and I&amp;#39;ll be doing</text>
  <text start="749.03" dur="3.51">future videos on Antarctica and all that</text>
  <text start="751.37" dur="4.56">too because I&amp;#39;ve gotten a few really</text>
  <text start="752.54" dur="5.43">good questions on that but anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="755.93" dur="3.84">how her buddy was able to obtain the</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="3.9">technology and then of course with that</text>
  <text start="759.77" dur="3.99">infiltration into America brought it</text>
  <text start="761.87" dur="4.2">into America and then that&amp;#39;s how our</text>
  <text start="763.76" dur="6.69">current military industrial complex blew</text>
  <text start="766.07" dur="6.59">up so moving on from Germany into the</text>
  <text start="770.45" dur="6.27">earth scientists so let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="772.66" dur="5.41">some of these guys that were able to get</text>
  <text start="776.72" dur="3.18">their minds out of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="778.07" dur="5.58">science realm and delve into some of</text>
  <text start="779.9" dur="5.43">these esoteric Sciences and one of those</text>
  <text start="783.65" dur="5.79">is viktor schauberger viktor schauberger</text>
  <text start="785.33" dur="6.99">was a scientist in austria in the 1920s</text>
  <text start="789.44" dur="4.23">or so early 1900s and this is actually</text>
  <text start="792.32" dur="2.94">another way that the Germans were able</text>
  <text start="793.67" dur="3.45">to obtain their science was through</text>
  <text start="795.26" dur="2.37">viktor schauberger but he back basically</text>
  <text start="797.12" dur="2.82">studied</text>
  <text start="797.63" dur="5.69">and that might not sound like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="799.94" dur="6.75">connected to this but when you actually</text>
  <text start="803.32" dur="6.01">vortex water it does have some</text>
  <text start="806.69" dur="4.74">anti-gravity capabilities again it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="809.33" dur="3.63">some nuts go check it out</text>
  <text start="811.43" dur="4.38">viktor schauberger created what was</text>
  <text start="812.96" dur="5.76">called a pull scene and this was a</text>
  <text start="815.81" dur="5.16">device that spun and actually had some</text>
  <text start="818.72" dur="4.23">anti-gravity capabilities with it but</text>
  <text start="820.97" dur="4.59">there was viktor schauberger there was</text>
  <text start="822.95" dur="4.5">Nikola Tesla of course I don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="825.56" dur="4.26">get into his backstory because a lot of</text>
  <text start="827.45" dur="4.92">you aware of Nikola Tesla but when he</text>
  <text start="829.82" dur="4.83">died in 1943 in New York</text>
  <text start="832.37" dur="5.43">the FBI swooped in took a bunch of his</text>
  <text start="834.65" dur="5.61">papers and many of those papers to this</text>
  <text start="837.8" dur="3.75">day we still haven&amp;#39;t seen so his work</text>
  <text start="840.26" dur="3.9">ended up in the hands of the military</text>
  <text start="841.55" dur="4.77">industrial complex and T Townsend Brown</text>
  <text start="844.16" dur="4.5">of course if you saw my video on</text>
  <text start="846.32" dur="5.58">anti-gravity that I released a week or</text>
  <text start="848.66" dur="7.2">two ago I discussed T Townsend Brown and</text>
  <text start="851.9" dur="6">just a quick refresher or if you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="855.86" dur="6.24">see that video T Townsend Brown was a</text>
  <text start="857.9" dur="8.82">scientist in the 1930s 40s and 50s who</text>
  <text start="862.1" dur="10.23">researched and found out that if you</text>
  <text start="866.72" dur="8.52">take a metallic disc and insert a high</text>
  <text start="872.33" dur="6.3">voltage electric charge into it it then</text>
  <text start="875.24" dur="5.79">has anti-gravity capabilities and he was</text>
  <text start="878.63" dur="4.98">literally making huge disc fly around a</text>
  <text start="881.03" dur="6.57">hundreds of miles now or just with</text>
  <text start="883.61" dur="5.7">electricity so of course his technology</text>
  <text start="887.6" dur="4.83">ended up in the hands of the military</text>
  <text start="889.31" dur="7.62">industrial complex and rest is history</text>
  <text start="892.43" dur="7.95">so there are just a few instances a few</text>
  <text start="896.93" dur="4.92">researchers that there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="900.38" dur="4.41">information out there about I mean T</text>
  <text start="901.85" dur="4.97">times around LaToya has a patent out</text>
  <text start="904.79" dur="4.53">there that you can go research Tesla</text>
  <text start="906.82" dur="4.69">ungodly amounts of information out there</text>
  <text start="909.32" dur="3.57">about him and then schauberger have some</text>
  <text start="911.51" dur="3.03">books you can check out and then of</text>
  <text start="912.89" dur="3.27">course there&amp;#39;s plenty of researchers of</text>
  <text start="914.54" dur="3.24">scientists that we don&amp;#39;t know the names</text>
  <text start="916.16" dur="3">of that are involved in these black</text>
  <text start="917.78" dur="3.63">projects that of course are researching</text>
  <text start="919.16" dur="5.52">all of this so there&amp;#39;s a few ways that</text>
  <text start="921.41" dur="4.65">earth scientists have helped these SSPs</text>
  <text start="924.68" dur="4.08">and then of course there&amp;#39;s a reverse</text>
  <text start="926.06" dur="4.01">engineering of ET craft namely the most</text>
  <text start="928.76" dur="7.06">popular one is raw</text>
  <text start="930.07" dur="9.72">well when two or possibly three</text>
  <text start="935.82" dur="5.8">extraterrestrial craft discs were they</text>
  <text start="939.79" dur="4.95">were actually shot on the air I believe</text>
  <text start="941.62" dur="5.79">by our military industrial complex and</text>
  <text start="944.74" dur="4.74">they were taken down and then the crafts</text>
  <text start="947.41" dur="3.18">were not actually taken to area 51 they</text>
  <text start="949.48" dur="3.72">were taking a wright-patterson Air Force</text>
  <text start="950.59" dur="4.32">Base these crafts were taking a taken to</text>
  <text start="953.2" dur="4.16">wright-patterson and the reverse</text>
  <text start="954.91" dur="4.74">engineering began on them and then</text>
  <text start="957.36" dur="6.31">another one that&amp;#39;s not as well known</text>
  <text start="959.65" dur="6.48">that Roswell is the Battle of LA and of</text>
  <text start="963.67" dur="5.64">course there was a movie named after</text>
  <text start="966.13" dur="5.28">this incident which was done for of</text>
  <text start="969.31" dur="4.53">course plausible deniability oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="971.41" dur="3.54">crazy crazy idea that got there to get</text>
  <text start="973.84" dur="4.44">that out of the movie of the same name</text>
  <text start="974.95" dur="6.3">no actually the Battle of LA refers to</text>
  <text start="978.28" dur="7.52">an event that happened in February of</text>
  <text start="981.25" dur="7.65">1942 in Long Beach California where this</text>
  <text start="985.8" dur="5.47">extraterrestrial craft mothership</text>
  <text start="988.9" dur="6.12">essentially parked itself over Long</text>
  <text start="991.27" dur="5.91">Beach and a bunch of small Scout ships</text>
  <text start="995.02" dur="4.07">then emanated from this craft nothing</text>
  <text start="997.18" dur="5.46">happened there was net there was no</text>
  <text start="999.09" dur="5.11">attack essentially but what happened of</text>
  <text start="1002.64" dur="4.41">course it was during wartime so all the</text>
  <text start="1004.2" dur="4.92">jitters of the people stationed at the</text>
  <text start="1007.05" dur="4.44">military bases there they just unloaded</text>
  <text start="1009.12" dur="4.62">all of this anti-aircraft artillery at</text>
  <text start="1011.49" dur="5.13">this mothership in the air and the Scout</text>
  <text start="1013.74" dur="4.38">ships and sidenote here</text>
  <text start="1016.62" dur="4.11">William Tompkins who I mentioned earlier</text>
  <text start="1018.12" dur="4.74">he actually witnessed this he was living</text>
  <text start="1020.73" dur="3.84">in Long Beach at the time so again his</text>
  <text start="1022.86" dur="4.17">testimony is fascinating so he literally</text>
  <text start="1024.57" dur="5.31">witnessed battle Villa but anyway</text>
  <text start="1027.03" dur="5.37">two of the Scout ships that that came</text>
  <text start="1029.88" dur="5.88">out of that mother ship were downed by</text>
  <text start="1032.4" dur="5.76">the anti-aircraft artillery fire and one</text>
  <text start="1035.76" dur="4.62">ended up in the ocean one ended up on</text>
  <text start="1038.16" dur="4.5">land the Navy confiscated the one in the</text>
  <text start="1040.38" dur="4.35">ocean the army got the one on land we</text>
  <text start="1042.66" dur="5.88">know that because of leaked documents</text>
  <text start="1044.73" dur="5.07">and leaked memos and that&amp;#39;s essentially</text>
  <text start="1048.54" dur="3.8">what occurs about battle of LA so</text>
  <text start="1049.8" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s been multiple crap recovered</text>
  <text start="1052.34" dur="3.04">multiple things that the</text>
  <text start="1054.15" dur="3.15">military-industrial complex can</text>
  <text start="1055.38" dur="2.55">reverse-engineer of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1057.3" dur="3.21">difficult</text>
  <text start="1057.93" dur="4.8">it took them quite a while but then with</text>
  <text start="1060.51" dur="2.86">the German researchers and scientists</text>
  <text start="1062.73" dur="4.09">and in flow</text>
  <text start="1063.37" dur="6.3">trading into America in the late 40s and</text>
  <text start="1066.82" dur="4.65">mainly in the 50s that then assisted in</text>
  <text start="1069.67" dur="3.9">the reverse engineering and then boom</text>
  <text start="1071.47" dur="4.83">they got you know they were able to</text>
  <text start="1073.57" dur="7.86">understand this advanced science</text>
  <text start="1076.3" dur="7.32">technology so moving on if they have if</text>
  <text start="1081.43" dur="4.65">the deep state has all this super</text>
  <text start="1083.62" dur="4.23">advanced science and tech well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1086.08" dur="3.51">gonna want to build it out they need</text>
  <text start="1087.85" dur="3.81">money to do that so let&amp;#39;s discuss that</text>
  <text start="1089.59" dur="5.31">how did they get the funds to build out</text>
  <text start="1091.66" dur="5.46">these secret space programs and the deep</text>
  <text start="1094.9" dur="5.07">underground stuff and whatnot first</text>
  <text start="1097.12" dur="7.35">let&amp;#39;s discuss the missing Pentagon money</text>
  <text start="1099.97" dur="9.33">so as many of you may know the day</text>
  <text start="1104.47" dur="7.5">before 9/11 September 10 2001 good all</text>
  <text start="1109.3" dur="5.25">the Don Rumsfeld Donny boy Secretary of</text>
  <text start="1111.97" dur="5.459">Defense at the time was on the floor of</text>
  <text start="1114.55" dur="7.379">Congress testifying admitting that they</text>
  <text start="1117.429" dur="8.431">were missing quote missing 2.3 trillion</text>
  <text start="1121.929" dur="6.421">dollars from the Pentagon so mind you</text>
  <text start="1125.86" dur="4.38">you know very important to mention here</text>
  <text start="1128.35" dur="4.079">the Pentagon has never ever been audited</text>
  <text start="1130.24" dur="4.35">granted there&amp;#39;s an audit now going on</text>
  <text start="1132.429" dur="4.591">this year for the first time ever not</text>
  <text start="1134.59" dur="4.17">completed yet very interested to see how</text>
  <text start="1137.02" dur="3.42">the results of that will turn out but</text>
  <text start="1138.76" dur="4.38">before this year it&amp;#39;s never ever been</text>
  <text start="1140.44" dur="4.32">audited so Donald Rumsfeld admitted to</text>
  <text start="1143.14" dur="5.78">2.3 trillion missing from it</text>
  <text start="1144.76" dur="8.16">fast forward 14 years after 2001 to 2015</text>
  <text start="1148.92" dur="6.31">that number based on a Department of</text>
  <text start="1152.92" dur="5.25">Defense Inspector General report</text>
  <text start="1155.23" dur="7.32">shut up to six point five trillion</text>
  <text start="1158.17" dur="6.9">dollars now fast forward to this point</text>
  <text start="1162.55" dur="6.72">in time and getting some other</text>
  <text start="1165.07" dur="7.32">researchers delving into this topic that</text>
  <text start="1169.27" dur="6.63">number has been estimated to be up to 15</text>
  <text start="1172.39" dur="6.75">to 20 even maybe twenty one trillion</text>
  <text start="1175.9" dur="7.5">dollars just missing from the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1179.14" dur="6.539">okay that&amp;#39;s a lot of money that&amp;#39;s a crap</text>
  <text start="1183.4" dur="4.83">ton of money and again that&amp;#39;s just for</text>
  <text start="1185.679" dur="4.651">the Pentagon let&amp;#39;s move on into another</text>
  <text start="1188.23" dur="4.56">way that the deep state loves to make</text>
  <text start="1190.33" dur="5.099">their money and that is through black</text>
  <text start="1192.79" dur="6.799">market trade trafficking</text>
  <text start="1195.429" dur="8.42">trafficking of guns trafficking of drugs</text>
  <text start="1199.589" dur="9.34">trafficking of humans trafficking of</text>
  <text start="1203.849" dur="7.57">organs and we don&amp;#39;t exactly know how</text>
  <text start="1208.929" dur="5.521">much money the deep state has made</text>
  <text start="1211.419" dur="5.82">through these means but could it have</text>
  <text start="1214.45" dur="6.149">been billions I would not even doubt it</text>
  <text start="1217.239" dur="5.61">could it have been trillions again I</text>
  <text start="1220.599" dur="4.41">would not even doubt it when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1222.849" dur="3.93">organ trafficking I believe I read</text>
  <text start="1225.009" dur="5.64">somewhere that for instance like a</text>
  <text start="1226.779" dur="5.01">kidney canet 200 to 250 thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="1230.649" dur="3.301">on the black market</text>
  <text start="1231.789" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s crazy right of course all the other</text>
  <text start="1233.95" dur="4.169">organs you know you can get into the</text>
  <text start="1236.019" dur="4.29">human trafficking and the child sex</text>
  <text start="1238.119" dur="4.711">trafficking you know all the nasty</text>
  <text start="1240.309" dur="3.35">that the deep states into how much money</text>
  <text start="1242.83" dur="4.079">is made there</text>
  <text start="1243.659" dur="6.07">but of course a lot of this money does</text>
  <text start="1246.909" dur="5.46">not go into space programs and secret</text>
  <text start="1249.729" dur="4.8">projects might go into well it goes into</text>
  <text start="1252.369" dur="4.65">secret stuff but not necessarily this</text>
  <text start="1254.529" dur="3.84">but I again wouldn&amp;#39;t doubt that a lot of</text>
  <text start="1257.019" dur="3.931">money made on the black market stuff</text>
  <text start="1258.369" dur="4.41">goes into this as well and then the last</text>
  <text start="1260.95" dur="4.559">thing that I want to discuss in the</text>
  <text start="1262.779" dur="4.86">money section here is this just kind of</text>
  <text start="1265.509" dur="5.1">rhetorical question what they even need</text>
  <text start="1267.639" dur="5.64">the money right if they have technology</text>
  <text start="1270.609" dur="4.29">that advanced grandma I didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1273.279" dur="3.39">get into what kind of technology they</text>
  <text start="1274.899" dur="3.02">have but uh that have been helpful to</text>
  <text start="1276.669" dur="4.411">include here but we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1277.919" dur="5.59">anti-gravity free energy life extension</text>
  <text start="1281.08" dur="5.579">technologies portal technologies just</text>
  <text start="1283.509" dur="5.22">all kinds of amazing stuff would they</text>
  <text start="1286.659" dur="4.71">even need money with that kind of</text>
  <text start="1288.729" dur="5.49">technology and this delves into the idea</text>
  <text start="1291.369" dur="6.38">of breakaway civilizations so you know</text>
  <text start="1294.219" dur="6.27">you have a few big black triangles or</text>
  <text start="1297.749" dur="4.93">you know cigar-shaped craft that can</text>
  <text start="1300.489" dur="7.32">take you and a whole bunch of supplies</text>
  <text start="1302.679" dur="7.35">over to Mars really quick well you can</text>
  <text start="1307.809" dur="3.81">establish essentially a colony there you</text>
  <text start="1310.029" dur="4.77">wouldn&amp;#39;t even need to keep siphoning</text>
  <text start="1311.619" dur="5.581">money from the from the public so all</text>
  <text start="1314.799" dur="4.38">this stuff you know it&amp;#39;s kind of just</text>
  <text start="1317.2" dur="3.809">for shits and giggles anymore it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1319.179" dur="4.71">of just because they want us to be poor</text>
  <text start="1321.009" dur="5.431">and broke and dumb and not having enough</text>
  <text start="1323.889" dur="4.561">time to actually research this stuff and</text>
  <text start="1326.44" dur="2.85">wasting our lives away at a wage slave</text>
  <text start="1328.45" dur="4.47">ninety-five</text>
  <text start="1329.29" dur="4.98">right Soho that&amp;#39;s just you know what</text>
  <text start="1332.92" dur="4.08">they wouldn&amp;#39;t even need money at this</text>
  <text start="1334.27" dur="6.06">point but anyway so that&amp;#39;s how a lot of</text>
  <text start="1337" dur="5.55">this stuff a lot of the money went into</text>
  <text start="1340.33" dur="4.53">the deep state to build out this kind of</text>
  <text start="1342.55" dur="3.75">technology and now for the last part</text>
  <text start="1344.86" dur="5.33">here I want to talk about how it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1346.3" dur="6.11">kept secret so first let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="1350.19" dur="4.42">compartmentalization</text>
  <text start="1352.41" dur="4.78">compartmentalization this is one of the</text>
  <text start="1354.61" dur="5.64">main ways it&amp;#39;s been kept secret and the</text>
  <text start="1357.19" dur="5.49">idea of compartmentalization is that if</text>
  <text start="1360.25" dur="3.92">you&amp;#39;re in one of these programs if</text>
  <text start="1362.68" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re in a project that&amp;#39;s working on</text>
  <text start="1364.17" dur="4.42">whatever the case is you know whatever</text>
  <text start="1366.97" dur="5.97">you&amp;#39;re working on reverse engineer your</text>
  <text start="1368.59" dur="7.17">craft or trying to create a craft or you</text>
  <text start="1372.94" dur="7.17">know dissecting et bodies whatever the</text>
  <text start="1375.76" dur="7.95">case is you&amp;#39;re in this project even if</text>
  <text start="1380.11" dur="6.09">you&amp;#39;re you know you could be in a</text>
  <text start="1383.71" dur="5.12">company or don&amp;#39;t let me let me work</text>
  <text start="1386.2" dur="4.89">around my explanation of this so</text>
  <text start="1388.83" dur="4.12">multiple people could be in a company</text>
  <text start="1391.09" dur="3.99">and they have no idea what people</text>
  <text start="1392.95" dur="3.69">literally down the hall could be doing</text>
  <text start="1395.08" dur="3.09">this is the idea of compartmentalization</text>
  <text start="1396.64" dur="3.24">of course because they&amp;#39;re they have MBAs</text>
  <text start="1398.17" dur="3.39">they have all this they&amp;#39;re not supposed</text>
  <text start="1399.88" dur="4.28">to talk about plenty of the stuff that</text>
  <text start="1401.56" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re doing but so</text>
  <text start="1404.16" dur="4.18">compartmentalization is a very efficient</text>
  <text start="1406.39" dur="3.54">way to hide this stuff and the example</text>
  <text start="1408.34" dur="3.45">of the Amman Hatton project where they</text>
  <text start="1409.93" dur="3.39">were working on the nuclear bomb they</text>
  <text start="1411.79" dur="3.75">had a hundred thousand people working on</text>
  <text start="1413.32" dur="4.05">this project none of them even knew what</text>
  <text start="1415.54" dur="4.35">they were working on until the bombs</text>
  <text start="1417.37" dur="4.56">dropped so and that&amp;#39;s a good point as</text>
  <text start="1419.89" dur="3.54">well in compartmentalization you have</text>
  <text start="1421.93" dur="3.15">different people working on tiny little</text>
  <text start="1423.43" dur="4.83">things you could be I mean they could be</text>
  <text start="1425.08" dur="5.94">working on like a bolt create a bolt or</text>
  <text start="1428.26" dur="5.13">create like this tiny little thing that</text>
  <text start="1431.02" dur="3.63">all goes into this big project and only</text>
  <text start="1433.39" dur="3.24">the people at the top of the food chain</text>
  <text start="1434.65" dur="3.84">the executives or whoever&amp;#39;s heading the</text>
  <text start="1436.63" dur="3.51">project know what everybody&amp;#39;s working on</text>
  <text start="1438.49" dur="3.51">but every single person is working on</text>
  <text start="1440.14" dur="3.06">this tiny little portion of it and they</text>
  <text start="1442" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t know what the bigger picture is</text>
  <text start="1443.2" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to say</text>
  <text start="1445.12" dur="4.23">about compartmentalization and then they</text>
  <text start="1446.77" dur="4.83">have the concept of acknowledged and</text>
  <text start="1449.35" dur="4.89">unacknowledged programs it&amp;#39;s just very</text>
  <text start="1451.6" dur="6.48">interesting very crucial to discuss here</text>
  <text start="1454.24" dur="7.89">so an acknowledged program or special</text>
  <text start="1458.08" dur="5.4">access project s AP and acknowledged s</text>
  <text start="1462.13" dur="2.82">ap</text>
  <text start="1463.48" dur="7.61">so it&amp;#39;s still secret it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="1464.95" dur="10.47">classified but is if you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="1471.09" dur="7.06">acknowledged SCP you have to report it</text>
  <text start="1475.42" dur="7.17">to superiors right if you&amp;#39;re at an</text>
  <text start="1478.15" dur="8.94">unacknowledged si P or you SAP you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1482.59" dur="6.57">report it to anybody outside of the</text>
  <text start="1487.09" dur="5.34">program or anybody that&amp;#39;s not on a</text>
  <text start="1489.16" dur="5.43">need-to-know basis and this could be I</text>
  <text start="1492.43" dur="3.63">mean you could have you could be at a</text>
  <text start="1494.59" dur="2.52">lower level say you&amp;#39;re like a colonel</text>
  <text start="1496.06" dur="3.9">lieutenant colonel something like that</text>
  <text start="1497.11" dur="5.22">in your na you SAP even if a general or</text>
  <text start="1499.96" dur="4.71">an admiral or the President of the</text>
  <text start="1502.33" dur="4.5">United States is asking you about that</text>
  <text start="1504.67" dur="3.48">you SAP they&amp;#39;re not in it so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1506.83" dur="2.76">in the need to know and that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1508.15" dur="3.72">was mentioning earlier about the outside</text>
  <text start="1509.59" dur="4.05">government knowledge so this is another</text>
  <text start="1511.87" dur="6.24">reason there&amp;#39;s another way how it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1513.64" dur="6.8">kept so secret and if you want if you</text>
  <text start="1518.11" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t believe me on this one there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1520.44" dur="7.66">1995 DoD manual that actually describes</text>
  <text start="1524.62" dur="4.77">how there&amp;#39;s acknowledged si PS and</text>
  <text start="1528.1" dur="2.76">unacknowledged si PS and then the</text>
  <text start="1529.39" dur="4.7">unacknowledged secret access programs</text>
  <text start="1530.86" dur="5.88">can actually be hidden within other</text>
  <text start="1534.09" dur="5.29">classified programs and like umbrella it</text>
  <text start="1536.74" dur="3.65">down so it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like down a</text>
  <text start="1539.38" dur="3.96">hundred levels</text>
  <text start="1540.39" dur="5.14">literally and figuratively and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1543.34" dur="3">one way it&amp;#39;s been kept secret is through</text>
  <text start="1545.53" dur="3.36">the compartmentalization</text>
  <text start="1546.34" dur="4.44">and then unacknowledged nature of the</text>
  <text start="1548.89" dur="6">compartments then of course we have</text>
  <text start="1550.78" dur="6.6">disinformation in psyops nasa has always</text>
  <text start="1554.89" dur="3.96">been used as that front organization to</text>
  <text start="1557.38" dur="3.78">the public saying oh this is the most</text>
  <text start="1558.85" dur="4.8">advanced stuff we have for space so we</text>
  <text start="1561.16" dur="4.47">still have to use these super old fossil</text>
  <text start="1563.65" dur="4.2">fuels and rockets to get up into space</text>
  <text start="1565.63" dur="3.96">you know and that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="1567.85" dur="5.91">kept anti-gravity technology secret of</text>
  <text start="1569.59" dur="6.24">course the extra serial idea of this all</text>
  <text start="1573.76" dur="4.41">one way they kept been kept secret and</text>
  <text start="1575.83" dur="4.73">just through all of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1578.17" dur="4.26">science education</text>
  <text start="1580.56" dur="6.28">disinformation everywhere</text>
  <text start="1582.43" dur="6.68">psyops right so then we get into the Air</text>
  <text start="1586.84" dur="4.32">Force the Air Force has been used as a</text>
  <text start="1589.11" dur="5.17">massive front they have what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="1591.16" dur="4.83">Project Blue Book that you can look into</text>
  <text start="1594.28" dur="4.2">is a project in the sixty</text>
  <text start="1595.99" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re the Air Force basically put the</text>
  <text start="1598.48" dur="4.29">kibosh on the extra strobe subject they</text>
  <text start="1600.91" dur="4.23">said all the UFO sightings ever done</text>
  <text start="1602.77" dur="4.65">were swap gas or by the balloons or yada</text>
  <text start="1605.14" dur="6.21">yada right so there&amp;#39;s been multiple</text>
  <text start="1607.42" dur="5.73">fronts that have kept this idea quiet</text>
  <text start="1611.35" dur="5.25">and then of course in regards to the</text>
  <text start="1613.15" dur="7.65">secret space program and the SSP anytime</text>
  <text start="1616.6" dur="7.44">there&amp;#39;s a UFO sighting very interesting</text>
  <text start="1620.8" dur="4.8">how it&amp;#39;s always brushed off if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1624.04" dur="5.49">brushed off as a weather balloon or</text>
  <text start="1625.6" dur="5.58">swamp gas they they just they leave it</text>
  <text start="1629.53" dur="5.22">unacknowledged they go oh it was an</text>
  <text start="1631.18" dur="5.94">anomalous thing in the sky right so the</text>
  <text start="1634.75" dur="5.1">reason I say this is because I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1637.12" dur="5.52">researching conspiracies for a few years</text>
  <text start="1639.85" dur="6.48">now quite a few years like six seven now</text>
  <text start="1642.64" dur="6.12">and I know that&amp;#39;s not as many as some</text>
  <text start="1646.33" dur="4.89">other people but in proportion to my age</text>
  <text start="1648.76" dur="4.44">quite a bit of my life and I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1651.22" dur="4.25">fathom the idea of a secret space</text>
  <text start="1653.2" dur="8.13">program until just a couple years ago</text>
  <text start="1655.47" dur="7.12">but I&amp;#39;ve been researching UFOs and XTX</text>
  <text start="1661.33" dur="5.07">trust really Shu and everything like</text>
  <text start="1662.59" dur="6.12">that but the idea of not just the SSP</text>
  <text start="1666.4" dur="4.83">but how deep it goes didn&amp;#39;t even occur</text>
  <text start="1668.71" dur="4.29">to me so you know there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="1671.23" dur="4.23">different psychological operations and</text>
  <text start="1673" dur="7.38">disinfo fronts even a lot of people in</text>
  <text start="1675.46" dur="6.81">the UFO community um I believe art isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1680.38" dur="6.12">for me sorry about that cut guys my</text>
  <text start="1682.27" dur="7.02">battery died so anyway where was I so</text>
  <text start="1686.5" dur="7.11">even in the UFO community there could be</text>
  <text start="1689.29" dur="6.18">quite a few assets spreading</text>
  <text start="1693.61" dur="4.52">disinformation in that so that&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1695.47" dur="6.38">way alright NASA&amp;#39;s upfront Air Force</text>
  <text start="1698.13" dur="6.79">using their psyops psyops located within</text>
  <text start="1701.85" dur="5.47">different truth in communities the act</text>
  <text start="1704.92" dur="3.84">like truthers might spread some truths</text>
  <text start="1707.32" dur="3.87">but there&amp;#39;s some disinformation there as</text>
  <text start="1708.76" dur="7.38">well and then of course fear and</text>
  <text start="1711.19" dur="6.96">ridicule if you think of all of the</text>
  <text start="1716.14" dur="6.02">movies made about Esther Esther over the</text>
  <text start="1718.15" dur="6.84">past five decades 98% of them are all</text>
  <text start="1722.16" dur="5.89">negative they portray ETS as being</text>
  <text start="1724.99" dur="4.649">things that are here to you know conquer</text>
  <text start="1728.05" dur="3.629">humanity</text>
  <text start="1729.639" dur="3.69">granted there are some negatively</text>
  <text start="1731.679" dur="4.41">oriented races but there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1733.329" dur="6.51">races here to help us as well</text>
  <text start="1736.089" dur="6.27">so there&amp;#39;s fear ridicule little green</text>
  <text start="1739.839" dur="3.18">men tinfoil hats yadda yadda yadda need</text>
  <text start="1742.359" dur="3.78">i say more</text>
  <text start="1743.019" dur="5.37">so this keeps plenty of people from</text>
  <text start="1746.139" dur="4.14">researching it this keeps plenty of</text>
  <text start="1748.389" dur="3.24">people from researching these topics and</text>
  <text start="1750.279" dur="3.57">of course like I always say</text>
  <text start="1751.629" dur="7.14">disinformation a lot of that going on</text>
  <text start="1753.849" dur="6.41">all in the media so there is one way we</text>
  <text start="1758.769" dur="3.99">talked about compartmentalization</text>
  <text start="1760.259" dur="5.34">disinformation and psyops</text>
  <text start="1762.759" dur="6.66">and then of course just plain threat</text>
  <text start="1765.599" dur="6.221">literal threat threat of whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1769.419" dur="4.5">your career your pension whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1771.82" dur="5.989">fret threat of harm on you and your</text>
  <text start="1773.919" dur="8.25">family or literal threat of death to</text>
  <text start="1777.809" dur="6.37">anybody working within these programs if</text>
  <text start="1782.169" dur="7.521">they talk they&amp;#39;re done they just</text>
  <text start="1784.179" dur="8.15">disappear and not only that but there is</text>
  <text start="1789.69" dur="5.949">no paper trail that&amp;#39;s a big one that I</text>
  <text start="1792.329" dur="6.25">didn&amp;#39;t discuss in all these but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1795.639" dur="4.35">no paper trail so once people are</text>
  <text start="1798.579" dur="4.71">brought into these projects they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1799.989" dur="10.74">have all of the memos and documents and</text>
  <text start="1803.289" dur="9.3">all that so that basically what I was</text>
  <text start="1810.729" dur="5.13">saying so without all of that paperwork</text>
  <text start="1812.589" dur="6.09">it leaves much less of a chance of that</text>
  <text start="1815.859" dur="5.37">escaping and then things becoming public</text>
  <text start="1818.679" dur="5.07">so of course one way we found out about</text>
  <text start="1821.229" dur="5.04">a lot of this stuff is through leaked</text>
  <text start="1823.749" dur="8.76">documents lot of leaked documents from</text>
  <text start="1826.269" dur="12.51">the 40s and 50s maybe even the 60s right</text>
  <text start="1832.509" dur="10.47">so by them taking anything physical out</text>
  <text start="1838.779" dur="5.97">of the picture that then cut down on the</text>
  <text start="1842.979" dur="4.17">chance of longest becoming public so</text>
  <text start="1844.749" dur="4.97">again how it&amp;#39;s kept secret</text>
  <text start="1847.149" dur="4.77">compartmentalization disinformation</text>
  <text start="1849.719" dur="5.34">psychological warfare psychological</text>
  <text start="1851.919" dur="5.94">operations are here and literal threat</text>
  <text start="1855.059" dur="4.57">so that&amp;#39;s it guys that&amp;#39;s the video that</text>
  <text start="1857.859" dur="4.02">I wanted to do for you an overview of</text>
  <text start="1859.629" dur="4.021">the secret space program how they got</text>
  <text start="1861.879" dur="4.171">the technology how they got the money</text>
  <text start="1863.65" dur="6.03">how it&amp;#39;s been kept secret I hope you</text>
  <text start="1866.05" dur="5.81">enjoyed this video here and again if you</text>

  <text start="1876.94" dur="4.95">one on the secret space program one on</text>
  <text start="1879.31" dur="5.81">each disclosure in general you can check</text>
  <text start="1881.89" dur="7.65">the description for links to those and</text>
