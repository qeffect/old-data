  <text start="104.82" dur="5.79">of all hurricane Harvey right I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="107.369" dur="4.771">have much to say about that I&amp;#39;m sure you</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="3.75">know about the hurricane I&amp;#39;m sure you</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="5.67">know about how much damage it&amp;#39;s caused</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="5.88">but the only question I have is was it</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="4.82">harped right and the reason I have that</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="5.22">question is because of how monstrous</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="5.019">this hurricane actually was they said it</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="5.04">was like a once in five hundred year</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="6.181">storm right that doesn&amp;#39;t just happen I</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="5.7">mean it could happen but let&amp;#39;s be real</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="5.16">here was there any weather manipulation</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="5.88">involved now again I don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="138.99" dur="5.85">special details to show you guys but</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="5.61">just google it right google hurricane</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="6.89">Harvey and HAARP or weather manipulation</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="6.84">right I did come across this small</text>
  <text start="151.73" dur="5.17">article in a picture showing that well</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="4.56">there may very well have been this radar</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="5.04">anomaly that occurred two to three days</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="5.1">before hurricane Harvey hit Texas that</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="4.14">doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me at all right how</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="3.93">much stuff and we&amp;#39;ll get into this later</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="4.86">does the mainstream media need to</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="5.07">distract us with so what better to do</text>
  <text start="170.94" dur="5.45">that then intensifying and letting this</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="7.2">storm just rip up into Texas right and</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="6.28">also how much pressure does that put on</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="6.33">the current administration and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="6.66">going on by doing that right the if the</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="4.32">deep stater or did this these</text>
  <text start="189.33" dur="3.39">clandestine factions wanted to</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="4.169">strengthen the storm and caused a</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="4.5">ton of damage because they want to avoid</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="3.511">their impending downfall why wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="3.42">they do that so those are the only</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="3.989">questions and thoughts I really have on</text>

  <text start="316.06" dur="5.68">interest not sure if I can finger quote</text>

  <text start="423.6" dur="5.22">go into this one I found on Zero Hedge</text>
  <text start="425.449" dur="6.041">interesting article it says that a Bay</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="6.24">Area TV anchor actually took to Facebook</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="6.69">and explained his personal experience</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="7.62">with an Tifa and he said he experienced</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="7.35">firsthand hate from an tyfa his name was</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="6.989">Frank Somerville he&amp;#39;s a well-known Bay</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="6.24">Area TV personality for KTVU and he took</text>
  <text start="449.669" dur="4.831">to Facebook to explain exactly what</text>
  <text start="451.77" dur="6.36">happened to him and he was letting the</text>
  <text start="454.5" dur="7.289">world know that this antiva organization</text>
  <text start="458.13" dur="5.789">the so called anti-fascists are pretty</text>
  <text start="461.789" dur="7.071">much just as violent and bad as fascists</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="7.951">themselves and let&amp;#39;s all be real right</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="6.19">auntie pho is funded by the globalists</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="6.21">plain and simple I mean every every time</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="5.67">they have some counter protesting going</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="5.13">on you&amp;#39;ll often see craigslist ads in</text>
  <text start="480.72" dur="5.49">the area saying you know come protest</text>
  <text start="483.21" dur="6.15">for 25 bucks an hour the these this</text>
  <text start="486.21" dur="6.78">group is most likely directly funded by</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="7.35">George Soros himself not surprised very</text>
  <text start="492.99" dur="6.179">cool that you know they&amp;#39;re violent</text>
  <text start="496.71" dur="6.03">shenanigans are getting exposed by</text>
  <text start="499.169" dur="6.661">well-known people and so much so that</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="5.64">even the Washington Post ran an article</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="5.1">that said black cloud and Tifa members</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="5.13">attack peaceful right-wing demonstrators</text>
  <text start="510.93" dur="5.76">in Berkeley so you can&amp;#39;t hide the truth</text>
  <text start="513.51" dur="5.94">folks and so many people are getting it</text>
  <text start="516.69" dur="6.18">getting that an tyfa is just call Intel</text>
  <text start="519.45" dur="5.04">Pro counterintelligence programs and you</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="3.75">know all the crap that&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="3.93">that even the mainstream media has to</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="5.03">take a step back and start throwing</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="4.58">their own people under the bus right so</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="4.55">this</text>
  <text start="533" dur="5.46">this shows you the power of awareness</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="4.99">consumer awareness media yet just</text>
  <text start="538.46" dur="5.7">awareness in general if we force the</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="4.74">truth out then the mainstream needle</text>
  <text start="544.16" dur="3.96">have nothing else to report than the</text>
  <text start="545.93" dur="4.08">truth but we have to make that happen so</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s the lesson there I got like a</text>
  <text start="550.01" dur="3.6">lesson for each one of these arrows</text>
  <text start="551.66" dur="7.83">don&amp;#39;t next one</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="9.12">DNC fraud lawsuit thrown out so the DNC</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="5.13">fraud lawsuit that was going up against</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="4.35">debbie Wasserman Schultz and the whole</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="4.32">Democratic National Committee saying</text>
  <text start="567.08" dur="4.5">that Bernie Sanders was essentially</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="5.61">forced out and the DNC specifically</text>
  <text start="571.58" dur="4.83">chose Hillary illegally well this whole</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="5.39">fraud lawsuit was just tossed out the</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="7.32">window and the judge basically said</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="5.92">judge watch was his name never really</text>
  <text start="583.73" dur="5.28">addressed the claims of the plaintiffs</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="5.48">they actually admitted that yeah the</text>
  <text start="589.01" dur="6.21">dance he actually committed some fraud</text>
  <text start="591.34" dur="5.8">but why it was thrown out is because</text>
  <text start="595.22" dur="4.65">they made some excuses there were that</text>
  <text start="597.14" dur="5.04">there was no legal claim for damages so</text>
  <text start="599.87" dur="3.63">they basically said Yeah right</text>
  <text start="602.18" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with rigging</text>
  <text start="603.5" dur="3.36">primaries but we just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="3.71">jurisdiction to do this so we can&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="606.86" dur="4.08">know we&amp;#39;re gonna have to toss this out a</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="4.18">little bit more some right</text>
  <text start="610.94" dur="4.26">there and this shows you just how I mean</text>
  <text start="612.74" dur="5.04">you obviously know how strong the deep</text>
  <text start="615.2" dur="7.02">state is but this just shows you right</text>
  <text start="617.78" dur="7.68">another example on the list so again</text>
  <text start="622.22" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re really gonna start seeing some</text>
  <text start="625.46" dur="3.57">civil war going on because this is gonna</text>
  <text start="627.17" dur="4.169">piss a lot of people off a lot of people</text>
  <text start="629.03" dur="3.54">in these three-letter agencies are very</text>
  <text start="631.339" dur="4.741">pissed off because they know exactly</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="6.39">what&amp;#39;s going on so the more that things</text>
  <text start="636.08" dur="5.73">like this happen don&amp;#39;t get discouraged</text>

  <text start="647.45" dur="5.43">see things like this happen I know that</text>

  <text start="656.69" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s that and then lastly I saw this</text>
  <text start="660.08" dur="4.65">on space comm I just want to go over</text>
  <text start="661.7" dur="4.71">real quick you know tomorrow I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="664.73" dur="4.589">actually be doing what</text>
  <text start="666.41" dur="4.679">one of my more science tech news videos</text>
  <text start="669.319" dur="5.101">I usually like to split them up from all</text>
  <text start="671.089" dur="5.911">the politics geopolitics stuff going on</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="4.589">there just be way too much to put into</text>
  <text start="677" dur="5.25">two separate videos with them both but</text>
  <text start="679.009" dur="5.491">with this science article just really</text>
  <text start="682.25" dur="4.259">important I wanted to point it out space</text>
  <text start="684.5" dur="4.23">comm ran an article saying</text>
  <text start="686.509" dur="5.75">record-breaking galaxies fine sheds</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="7.049">light on what they call the magnetic</text>
  <text start="692.259" dur="5.861">universe magnetic universe interesting</text>
  <text start="695.779" dur="6.961">what does that sound a lot alike</text>
  <text start="698.12" dur="7.759">maybe the electric universe whoo right</text>
  <text start="702.74" dur="6.18">the electric universe theory that theory</text>
  <text start="705.879" dur="4.471">explaining so much more about our</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="3.779">physical universe than any of the</text>
  <text start="710.35" dur="4.75"> standard model models of</text>
  <text start="712.699" dur="4.411">physics do but that electric universe</text>
  <text start="715.1" dur="4.02">theory that&amp;#39;s been sanitized out of the</text>
  <text start="717.11" dur="5.76">mainstream that&amp;#39;s been ridiculed and</text>
  <text start="719.12" dur="6.389">somewhat suppressed right yet this</text>
  <text start="722.87" dur="6.209">article on space column is calling it a</text>
  <text start="725.509" dur="5.971">magnetic universe sounds very similar</text>
  <text start="729.079" dur="6.081">right so what&amp;#39;s going on is that the</text>
  <text start="731.48" dur="6.33">mainstays mainstream science they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="735.16" dur="4.21">pushing out a lot of this information</text>
  <text start="737.81" dur="3.75">that they&amp;#39;ve suppressed but they&amp;#39;re kind</text>
  <text start="739.37" dur="4.56">of rebranding it and they&amp;#39;re acting like</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="4.769">it&amp;#39;s also new and then it hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="5.639">suppressed for decades or a hundred</text>
  <text start="746.329" dur="6.091">years or so right so again because so</text>
  <text start="749.569" dur="4.921">many people there are becoming aware and</text>
  <text start="752.42" dur="4.649">this tide of consciousness is getting so</text>
  <text start="754.49" dur="3.959">strong the powers that we know that they</text>
  <text start="757.069" dur="4.38">know that people are waking up so what</text>
  <text start="758.449" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re having to do is push out so much</text>

  <text start="763.55" dur="5.399">been hiding it for so long so give it</text>
  <text start="765.92" dur="5.609">like a couple of years and what we think</text>
  <text start="768.949" dur="5.101">is mainstream science will start to be</text>
  <text start="771.529" dur="5.43">the conspiracy stuff right there trying</text>
  <text start="774.05" dur="5.009">to intermingle the two and make people</text>
  <text start="776.959" dur="4.5">forget about all the secrets that</text>
