  <text start="78.51" dur="4.68">to familiarize everybody out there with</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="3.51">cryptocurrency what cryptocurrency is</text>
  <text start="83.19" dur="2.67">and I actually want to familiarize</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="3.45">myself with it because I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="4.32">unaware of exactly what it is so I</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="4.65">wanted to ask an expert about that and I</text>
  <text start="90.18" dur="5.25">wanted you to talk about what trade</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="5.52">genius can do for people as well those</text>
  <text start="95.43" dur="4.08">who are you know little bit confused</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="4.71">about how to even get into</text>
  <text start="99.51" dur="5.16">cryptocurrency so first of all just talk</text>
  <text start="102.66" dur="4.86">about what crypto is and how it can</text>
  <text start="104.67" dur="4.59">benefit people and maybe some cons or</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="2.91">some questions or concerns that a lot of</text>
  <text start="109.26" dur="3.84">people might have out there as well</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="5.28">about it yeah so cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="5.46">really in the most basic senses is the</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="5.19">next generation of digital currency so</text>
  <text start="118.56" dur="5.1">the best way I describe it to people is</text>
  <text start="120.9" dur="6.27">is that it takes the best of cash and</text>
  <text start="123.66" dur="6.72">the best of gold and they merged it</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="4.83">together so it has I don&amp;#39;t call it be an</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="2.4">anonymity but it has what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="132" dur="3.15">pseudonymity</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="3.78">you know you could see that somebody is</text>
  <text start="135.15" dur="3.87">selling and buying something but you</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t know who they are that kind of you</text>
  <text start="139.02" dur="6.27">know confidentiality and it has the</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="4.44">portability of being able to transfer</text>
  <text start="145.29" dur="4.2">transactions anywhere in the world</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="5.28">without anybody being able to confiscate</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="5.19">it but on anybody be able to counterfeit</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="5.04">it without permission from anybody else</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="5.4">and so it just gives you the all the</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="6.21">advantages of cash all the security of</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="5.16">gold and it gives you a bit ability to</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="3.93">really go around the banking system so</text>
  <text start="165.24" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s what cryptocurrency really is in</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="4.88">this most basic sense it&amp;#39;s the next</text>
  <text start="169.95" dur="5.16">generation of being able to get around</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="5.16">you know the what I call the parasites</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="6.15">in the system you know the bankers and</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="6.07">the major corporations and and the hedge</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="4.47">funds and the Federal Reserve you can</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="4.35">just transact peer-to-peer if you and I</text>
  <text start="185.73" dur="3.84">want to do business together I can send</text>
  <text start="187.83" dur="3.81">you money right now as we&amp;#39;re talking I</text>
  <text start="189.57" dur="3.97">don&amp;#39;t have to go through a bank I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="8.5">go through a credit card company I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="8.85">in February appealing to people</text>
  <text start="200.14" dur="5.099">that&amp;#39;s why has really taken off in the</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="6.179">last two years that it has taken off</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="4.741">huge I mean I I on the news cycles that</text>
  <text start="208.569" dur="7.25">I watch every seems like everyday</text>
  <text start="209.98" dur="5.839">Bitcoin and other Kryptonian</text>
  <text start="217.079" dur="4.451">in your eyes you know I know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="3.42">lot of different kinds of crypto</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="3.209">currencies out there yeah Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="222.879" dur="4.051">etherium there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="3.9">kinds is there any ideas in your mind</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="4.86">about which ones are better which ones</text>
  <text start="228.639" dur="4.651">might be managed by the elite or</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="3.119">anything like that I just know I know a</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="4.199">lot of people are concerned that for</text>
  <text start="234.909" dur="4.23">instance bitcoin is is actually managed</text>
  <text start="237.489" dur="2.761">by the elite controllers for something</text>
  <text start="239.139" dur="3.871">that regards so what&amp;#39;s your thoughts on</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.919">that yeah so when I describe to people</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="5.399">Bitcoin itself I call it like the gold</text>
  <text start="245.169" dur="5.91">standard reserve currency of the new</text>
  <text start="248.409" dur="4.771">digital world you have litecoin which we</text>
  <text start="251.079" dur="3.72">call the silver standard you mean is</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="3.419">this probably more transactions will</text>
  <text start="254.799" dur="4.47">occur in litecoin because it costs less</text>
  <text start="256.599" dur="5.221">and it&amp;#39;s faster to do the transactions</text>
  <text start="259.269" dur="5.251">and then aetherium we call it like Intel</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="4.529">Inside that&amp;#39;s like the software we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="264.52" dur="3.63">lot of the coins sit on top of all that</text>
  <text start="266.349" dur="3.511">you know there&amp;#39;s eight hundred plus I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="4.47">point out that&amp;#39;s what they call the</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="5.16">other coins oh wow yeah they sit on a</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="3.96">lot of months it on the etherium what</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="2.85">they call the blockchain which is the</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="4.079">way which you record all the</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="4.89">transactions so those are the three big</text>
  <text start="280.659" dur="5.461">ones but there&amp;#39;s other jazz neo is kind</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="5.909">of the etherium of the of the of the</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="3.84">Chinese market and then you have the two</text>
  <text start="288.669" dur="3.72">that you just kind of talked about which</text>
  <text start="289.96" dur="4.47">ones can kind of can be controlled those</text>
  <text start="292.389" dur="3.27">are the decentralized currencies those</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="5.13">are the one that you want to do business</text>
  <text start="295.659" dur="6.301">in because it requires a consensus from</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="5.28">everybody in the network to be able to</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="4.679">say a transaction is good however does a</text>
  <text start="304.84" dur="4.919">couple I call Trojan horses out there</text>
  <text start="306.639" dur="5.161">and that&amp;#39;s like be cash people I heard</text>
  <text start="309.759" dur="4.831">about that just got put on some of the</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="5.31">exchanges that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a coin that came</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="4.77">off a Bitcoin but it&amp;#39;s really more</text>
  <text start="317.11" dur="5.34">centralized five or six major players</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="4.77">own most of the coins and they control</text>
  <text start="322.45" dur="3.57">the mining of that and that&amp;#39;s where I</text>
  <text start="324.13" dur="2.71">dig is for controlling and manipulating</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="2.8">you and me</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="4.62">and then the bankers are behind a coin</text>
  <text start="328.82" dur="3">called ripple which is really a bank to</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="2.07">bank</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="4.53">country to country kind of transaction</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="4.98">but again it&amp;#39;s very centralized and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="4.92">very controlled and those are the ones I</text>
  <text start="338.51" dur="4.95">think the elites are gonna try to use to</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="4.29">you know manipulate the market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="3.63">trying to downplay the other coins but</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s a lot of matter that are really</text>
  <text start="347.09" dur="5.73">good there&amp;#39;s stellar which is backed by</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="6.839">IBM there&amp;#39;s NXT there&amp;#39;s Manero which is</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="4.47">the one is truly confidential and then</text>
  <text start="355.639" dur="3">there&amp;#39;s just a plethora of them coming</text>
  <text start="357.29" dur="3.03">up we&amp;#39;re just trying to keep up with</text>
  <text start="358.639" dur="4.261">them all the time but no they&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="4.17">the big 10 that people like to do</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="3.989">transaction with and then there&amp;#39;s six</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="4.14">seven eight hundred other coins that are</text>
  <text start="366.889" dur="3.601">coming and a lot of them will be gone</text>

  <text start="408.2" dur="4.529">ideas I should say behind the</text>
  <text start="410.6" dur="4.08">origination of cryptocurrencies some</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="3.871">people are thinking it&amp;#39;s artificial</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="5.549">intelligence influence some people think</text>
  <text start="416.6" dur="5.58">it originates from some white hats that</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="3.601">are trying to protect us in case the</text>
  <text start="422.18" dur="4.77">Federal Reserve crashes the fiat</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="5.7">currency system what your ideas on how</text>
  <text start="426.95" dur="3.93">it originated yeah so we called the</text>
  <text start="429.53" dur="4.35">crypto currency or the blockchain</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="5.7">revolution internet 3.0 you know</text>
  <text start="433.88" dur="4.67">internet 2.0 or Internet 1.0 was really</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="5.22">was a government-funded</text>
  <text start="438.55" dur="3.82">operation by DARPA back in the 60s and</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="2.94">70s</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="4.74">to make sure that communication happens</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="4.56">in case there&amp;#39;s a nuclear war in the</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.95">United States where packets can go</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="5.929">decentralized well the NSA in the 80s</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="6.51">and 90s wrote a paper on how to send</text>
  <text start="455.229" dur="5.081">transactions and do business and have a</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="5.16">currency that&amp;#39;s equally</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="5.82">light and that&amp;#39;s the genesis behind the</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="3.93">cryptocurrency not as far as anybody</text>
  <text start="466.13" dur="4.56">knows they didn&amp;#39;t really do anything</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="5.58">with it and then then a consortium of a</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="6.18">person called Satoshi went ahead and</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="5.55">started the Bitcoin protocol if you will</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="5.34">that you&amp;#39;re creating these coins from</text>
  <text start="478.79" dur="7.62">you know early 2000 all the way to 2021</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="6.27">and so they that&amp;#39;s it and his thought</text>
  <text start="486.41" dur="4.86">behind this one it&amp;#39;s really clever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.48" dur="4.86">is that when you want you won a coin</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="5.28">that in order for a currency to work you</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="5.46">have to trust it and trust that it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="4.17">be counterfeited and that you have to</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="4.71">trust that the value is gonna be there</text>
  <text start="500.72" dur="4.38">so what he did was he created a you know</text>
  <text start="503.51" dur="5.85">basically called proof of work that</text>
  <text start="505.1" dur="6.42">really requires it the effort behind it</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="4.95">that it&amp;#39;s not easy to do or create a</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="4.89">coin and then he created there&amp;#39;s 11</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="5.52">thousand what they call nodes out there</text>
  <text start="516.41" dur="6.39">that validate these transactions every</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="4.92">15 minutes Jordan and so everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="3.9">looking at the transaction and saying</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="4.44">yeah that&amp;#39;s a good and fair transaction</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="3.69">so you have transparency and I know</text>
  <text start="529.19" dur="2.91">that&amp;#39;s a lot of things your audience</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="3.27">worries about - are we getting good</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="3.84">information well there&amp;#39;s 11,000 people</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="3.96">looking over a transaction that you and</text>
  <text start="535.94" dur="4.08">I would send to each other and once</text>
  <text start="537.62" dur="5.7">that&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s locked in so nobody can</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="6.84">undo that and steal our coin or steal</text>
  <text start="543.32" dur="5.67">our transaction so it&amp;#39;s decentralized it</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="4.4">doesn&amp;#39;t require permission you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.99" dur="5.82">confiscate it if you tried to take</text>
  <text start="551.26" dur="5.74">$11,000 of cash over the Canadian border</text>
  <text start="554.81" dur="4.77">you know go visit somebody for the</text>
  <text start="557" dur="4.14">holidays you know that border crossing</text>
  <text start="559.58" dur="4.44">they could have confiscated that money</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="4.53">from you and it wouldn&amp;#39;t they have no</text>
  <text start="564.02" dur="4.47">other reason why we suspect that you</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="4.62">didn&amp;#39;t earn it well if you have $11,000</text>
  <text start="568.49" dur="3.54">in Bitcoin and you walk across the board</text>
  <text start="570.29" dur="4.11">and say you have any money on you say no</text>

  <text start="584.66" dur="4.76">confiscated and doesn&amp;#39;t record anybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.58" dur="5.31">permission so so it&amp;#39;s in my view it</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="4.72">decentralized nature of it is very white</text>
  <text start="591.89" dur="3.51">hat the black</text>
  <text start="594.14" dur="4.47">is when the people are gonna try to</text>
  <text start="595.4" dur="4.89">centralize the coin hmm and so and</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re gonna have a hard time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="600.29" dur="3.54">gonna have a hard time doing this to</text>
  <text start="602.12" dur="3.78">people because because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.83" dur="3.36">decentralized they can&amp;#39;t confiscate it</text>
  <text start="605.9" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;ll have to shut the internet down</text>
  <text start="607.19" dur="3.96">at this point and now they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="609.29" dur="3.78">one&amp;#39;s called decentralized exchanges</text>
  <text start="611.15" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re trying to said hey we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="613.07" dur="3.93">shut down all the exchanges and now you</text>
  <text start="614.72" dur="3.63">can&amp;#39;t use your coins well there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="617" dur="3.09">bunch of really smart people that</text>
  <text start="618.35" dur="4.2">created what&amp;#39;s called decentralized</text>
  <text start="620.09" dur="4.53">exchanges that means the exchange exists</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="5.28">everywhere and nowhere at the same time</text>
  <text start="624.62" dur="4.5">like your coins do so nobody can shut it</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="3.27">down the only way they could do is</text>
  <text start="629.12" dur="4.35">literally stop the internet from</text>
  <text start="631.1" dur="5.37">happening so it&amp;#39;s gonna provide a lot of</text>
  <text start="633.47" dur="5.04">power to the people and this is the</text>
  <text start="636.47" dur="4.2">first time people got ahead of the banks</text>
  <text start="638.51" dur="3.63">and the big money and they&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="640.67" dur="3.21">catch-up trying to get involved in this</text>
  <text start="642.14" dur="3.99">so this is the first time this is a</text>
  <text start="643.88" dur="4.38">really big wealth transfer effect that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="4.89">happening that doesn&amp;#39;t include the banks</text>
  <text start="648.26" dur="4.8">and at first they dismissed it now</text>
  <text start="651.02" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re scared to death and and now</text>
  <text start="653.06" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out ways in</text>
  <text start="654.35" dur="4.52">which they can participate or try to</text>
  <text start="656.39" dur="5.34">co-op this but it&amp;#39;s too late for them</text>
  <text start="658.87" dur="4.45">that&amp;#39;s a lot of great information you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.73" dur="4.08">even educating me I&amp;#39;m gonna have to go</text>
  <text start="663.32" dur="5.1">back and re-watch this video you</text>
  <text start="665.81" dur="4.68">mentioned earlier trust and one thing</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;ve noticed lately with crypto is the</text>
  <text start="670.49" dur="3.84">volatility of the markets and you know</text>
  <text start="672.53" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s just crazy going up and down even</text>
  <text start="674.33" dur="5.64">during one single day so what words do</text>
  <text start="677.48" dur="4.95">you have to those who are timid because</text>
  <text start="679.97" dur="4.77">of the volatility of the markets okay so</text>
  <text start="682.43" dur="4.08">I have two views on that so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="684.74" dur="3.66">thing out there people called huddling I</text>
  <text start="686.51" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t if you ever heard of that I have I</text>
  <text start="688.4" dur="3.36">just heard about it the other day yeah</text>
  <text start="690.02" dur="4.2">so it was a it&amp;#39;s a derivation of hold</text>
  <text start="691.76" dur="4.41">somebody spelled it wrong at first and</text>
  <text start="694.22" dur="3.42">it kind of took and so what they call</text>
  <text start="696.17" dur="3.66">people in crypto they call them hard</text>
  <text start="697.64" dur="4.41">lers that means I&amp;#39;m gonna hold this coin</text>
  <text start="699.83" dur="4.98">because I know over time the value of</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="5.25">this coin is gonna be more valuable than</text>
  <text start="704.81" dur="5.01">the fiat currencies that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="707.3" dur="4.41">expressed against so therefore I think</text>
  <text start="709.82" dur="4.05">you know hey I think the dollar is gonna</text>
  <text start="711.71" dur="3.96">fall by half so if I get away two or</text>
  <text start="713.87" dur="4.68">three years I know my coin will be worth</text>
  <text start="715.67" dur="5.07">at least 50% more so they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="718.55" dur="3.75">holding it and then the other people are</text>
  <text start="720.74" dur="3.06">like traders and I&amp;#39;m I come from a</text>
  <text start="722.3" dur="3.81">trading background so I&amp;#39;ve been trading</text>
  <text start="723.8" dur="4.29">for over 30 years so I have stuff that</text>
  <text start="726.11" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;m holding and then stuff that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="728.09" dur="4.86">trading and so what we do if I get this</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="4.26">plug trade genius for a second is is</text>
  <text start="732.95" dur="5.73">that we provide our clients with</text>
  <text start="735.17" dur="5.22">software tools and a trading room so</text>
  <text start="738.68" dur="3.54">that we can advise them and I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="740.39" dur="5.25">your devise to enough financial advisors</text>
  <text start="742.22" dur="5.37">so we could suggest to them hey we think</text>
  <text start="745.64" dur="3.3">probably this coin is run too far too</text>
  <text start="747.59" dur="3.48">fast you might want to take a little bit</text>
  <text start="748.94" dur="3.93">off the table or hey I think they</text>
  <text start="751.07" dur="4.02">overdone it to the downside we should</text>
  <text start="752.87" dur="5.91">add so it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s really a</text>
  <text start="755.09" dur="5.61">strategy of buy low sell high but if you</text>
  <text start="758.78" dur="4.74">look at the trajectory Jordan it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="760.7" dur="4.98">up all the time so and it won&amp;#39;t end</text>
  <text start="763.52" dur="3.45">anytime soon it&amp;#39;s trying to get to a</text>
  <text start="765.68" dur="4.95">point where providing one&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="6.45">purchase power parity to gold and silver</text>
  <text start="770.63" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s the best place you can compare</text>
  <text start="773.42" dur="4.89">these Kryptos against they wanted to be</text>
  <text start="775.7" dur="4.5">invaluable as gold and silver isn&amp;#39;t from</text>
  <text start="778.31" dur="4.62">what they call a market capitalization</text>
  <text start="780.2" dur="5.37">or an asset value perspective and they</text>
  <text start="782.93" dur="5.52">can still go up ten the 20 times where</text>
  <text start="785.57" dur="6">it is today to meet that criteria so</text>
  <text start="788.45" dur="4.53">what I tell people is I&amp;#39;d rip in every</text>
  <text start="791.57" dur="4.05">week and I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for a long</text>
  <text start="792.98" dur="4.59">time I still buy every week i buy every</text>
  <text start="795.62" dur="4.74">tuesday regardless what the price is and</text>
  <text start="797.57" dur="4.86">then I manage my position as I see the</text>
  <text start="800.36" dur="3.6">software tools telling me to say hey a</text>
  <text start="802.43" dur="3.42">little heavier here or get a little</text>
  <text start="803.96" dur="4.41">lighter here so that&amp;#39;s what I advise</text>
  <text start="805.85" dur="5.67">people but all by all means you have to</text>
  <text start="808.37" dur="4.8">be participating in this because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="811.52" dur="3.18">gonna look back we told people a year</text>
  <text start="813.17" dur="3.06">ago you need to get into the</text>
  <text start="814.7" dur="3.83">cryptocurrency people are telling us</text>
  <text start="816.23" dur="5.52">today I had no idea it was gonna go up</text>
  <text start="818.53" dur="6.22">1,000 to 5,000 percent and it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="821.75" dur="5.01">have another move because version 2 or</text>
  <text start="824.75" dur="5.19">the second wave is going to be coming in</text>
  <text start="826.76" dur="5.36">2018 to 2019 because the big money now</text>
  <text start="829.94" dur="5.25">is starting to get involved in this so</text>
  <text start="832.12" dur="6.61">we still time there&amp;#39;s two more ways we</text>
  <text start="835.19" dur="5.22">equated to the Internet in 1994 there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.73" dur="3.75">a good six or seven years left in this</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="5.13">run in our view before it reaches some</text>
  <text start="842.48" dur="5.01">sort of stasis gotcha you don&amp;#39;t call it</text>
  <text start="845.54" dur="6.24">hold genius you call it trade genius for</text>
  <text start="847.49" dur="6.9">Creason you know funny enough I just saw</text>
  <text start="851.78" dur="5.309">Zero Hedge yesterday that somebody put</text>
  <text start="854.39" dur="6.91">down a million dollar bet that Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="857.089" dur="7.491">would hit 50,000 in 2018 so</text>
  <text start="861.3" dur="6.45">for those out there who you know like</text>
  <text start="864.58" dur="7.89">myself wants to get into cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="867.75" dur="6.37">what can trade genius do for them yeah</text>
  <text start="872.47" dur="3.09">so when people come to us and they sign</text>
  <text start="874.12" dur="4.62">up they ask what&amp;#39;s the first thing I</text>
  <text start="875.56" dur="5.97">should do is we tell them look we have a</text>
  <text start="878.74" dur="4.29">package just getting the trading room if</text>
  <text start="881.53" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s hundreds of people there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="883.03" dur="6.57">open 24/7 my partner runs that and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.84" dur="5.85">been mining cryptocurrency since 2011 so</text>
  <text start="889.6" dur="5.85">nobody knows more about this face than</text>
  <text start="892.69" dur="4.71">he does I defy anybody that that that</text>
  <text start="895.45" dur="4.23">note is more knowledgeable that he isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="897.4" dur="3.93">doing this and get in there with other</text>
  <text start="899.68" dur="3.93">people that have been trading these</text>
  <text start="901.33" dur="3.9">coins for a while and ask a lot of</text>
  <text start="903.61" dur="3">really good questions the second thing</text>
  <text start="905.23" dur="4.68">is you just got to put a stake in the</text>
  <text start="906.61" dur="6">ground and buy a little and then and</text>
  <text start="909.91" dur="4.62">then try to learn the the rhythm of the</text>
  <text start="912.61" dur="4.05">movement of the of the price of you like</text>
  <text start="914.53" dur="4.05">Bitcoin that&amp;#39;s great if you like one of</text>
  <text start="916.66" dur="4.08">the other coins that&amp;#39;s fine too the</text>
  <text start="918.58" dur="4.77">algorithm and an oscillation where you</text>
  <text start="920.74" dur="4.2">just keep adding and then what the other</text>
  <text start="923.35" dur="3.66">thing that we tell people to do that is</text>
  <text start="924.94" dur="4.68">that we have software tools that you can</text>
  <text start="927.01" dur="4.49">load right on your own PC and that you</text>
  <text start="929.62" dur="5.52">can then see we actually have buy and</text>
  <text start="931.5" dur="5.4">exit buy or sell we make it really</text>
  <text start="935.14" dur="4.02">simple and really easy for people to</text>
  <text start="936.9" dur="4.36">visually see when they probably should</text>
  <text start="939.16" dur="4.77">take some off the table and for example</text>
  <text start="941.26" dur="5.31">a week and a half ago our sophomores</text>
  <text start="943.93" dur="4.29">telling people hey might be time to X a</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="3.78">little bit did we use what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="5.4">money flow indicators to tell us that</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="5.79">money&amp;#39;s sneaking out the back door price</text>
  <text start="953.62" dur="4.8">may not see that yet but we see that</text>
  <text start="956.14" dur="4.92">people are selling and it just people</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="4.65">have sidestepped this crash that just</text>
  <text start="961.06" dur="3.69">happened a couple days ago and then our</text>
  <text start="963.07" dur="4.2">software said to get right back in and</text>
  <text start="964.75" dur="4.59">so people wrote it up and we&amp;#39;re laughing</text>
