  <text start="195.209" dur="6.661">back in the 1970s and 80s he was a huge</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="5.97">black actor back then and he started to</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="5.76">from my understanding basically I guess</text>
  <text start="204.269" dur="5.671">get sick of Hollywood you know as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="5.25">sure some people do so he decided to</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="5.609">become a minister he went from Hollywood</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="6.72">into ministry and he&amp;#39;s been a minister</text>
  <text start="215.549" dur="6.901">for the past quite a few years 10 20</text>

  <text start="232.769" dur="5.25">and lately he&amp;#39;s been really trying to</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="4.989">push disclosure forward you know talk</text>
  <text start="238.019" dur="3.391">about all of these crazy concepts Leon</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="4.291">Isaac Kennedy is really bringing</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="6.6">together I don&amp;#39;t want to say religion</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="6.69">but we could say Christianity or</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="6.78">scripture and the disclosure the higher</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="5.37">consciousness movement so the credible</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="4.49">work he&amp;#39;s doing very important work and</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="5.52">he is just an incredible speaker - how</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="5.59">calculated and the way that he can move</text>
  <text start="262.08" dur="5.13">an audience and bring people to literal</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="5.13">tears I was watching his speech</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="3.75">and very spiritual speech very</text>
  <text start="270" dur="2.61">incredible and there are some people</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="4.679">crying in the audience healing</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="5.489">themselves simply through the release of</text>
  <text start="275.639" dur="5.161">emotions within them from this man&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.099" dur="4.831">words so like I said incredible as</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="5.22">honored to be able to connect with all</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="7.019">those people for a good amount of time</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="7.61">and listen to them speak had about two</text>
  <text start="289.949" dur="7.56">or three presentations a day I myself</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="6.909">gave a presentation on Wednesday and my</text>
  <text start="297.509" dur="6.061">presentation was about Q so I was kind</text>
  <text start="300.539" dur="5.25">of going back and forth you know with</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="6.21">the environment I was in in the crowd</text>
  <text start="305.789" dur="5.94">that was there I was kind of debating</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="4.58">what I wanted to talk about I&amp;#39;m like man</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="4.951">should I talk about more science</text>
  <text start="314.36" dur="5.799">consciousness esoteric physics type</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="6.269">stuff or should I just go full bore into</text>
  <text start="320.159" dur="5.401">a Q presentation had some people come up</text>
  <text start="322.949" dur="4.62">to me and they said you know I want you</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="4.05">to talk about Q I had quite a few people</text>
  <text start="327.569" dur="3.511">mentioning that they wanted me to</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="4.5">discuss that so I decided to do my</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="6.99">presentation on Q and on went through a</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="7.95">good 90 minute plus presentation through</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="7.56">all of my understanding of the Q nod</text>
  <text start="342.06" dur="5.34">phenomenon and it was great</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="4.17">no hecklers in the audience everybody</text>
  <text start="347.4" dur="6.989">loved it I&amp;#39;ll be honest I&amp;#39;ve been at a</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="6.72">few events a couple last year where I</text>
  <text start="354.389" dur="4.141">was going through Q discussing the Trump</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="4.199">administration politics and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="3.81">triggered a few people you know they</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="5.281">weren&amp;#39;t hecklers by any means but they</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="6.299">were just lacking perspective and a</text>
  <text start="366" dur="4.229">little bit triggered it happened at a</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="4.5">couple events last year so I you know I</text>
  <text start="370.229" dur="4.74">had to hold the space forum ask him some</text>
  <text start="373.139" dur="4.59">questions what&amp;#39;s the disconnect here and</text>
  <text start="374.969" dur="4.351">try to be as nice and cordial as I can</text>
  <text start="377.729" dur="4.051">when that sort of disagreement arises</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="6.54">but this time was great everybody loved</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="5.46">it no disagreements and recorded it as</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="4.23">well so the edge of wonder guys in their</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="4.38">cameraman they brought a bunch of</text>
  <text start="390.09" dur="3.629">fantastic equipment to be able to record</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="4.56">this so I&amp;#39;m trying my hardest to get</text>
  <text start="393.719" dur="4.37">those files and to edit it up and put</text>
  <text start="396.18" dur="4.86">that presentation on this channel</text>
  <text start="398.089" dur="5.021">because I feel that a</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="5.87">it&amp;#39;s probably one of the most thorough</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="6.03">from A to Z presentations of Q it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="4.89">pretty advanced it&amp;#39;s pretty advanced but</text>
  <text start="409.14" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s also very basic you know I try to</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="4.48">make it so that everybody can understand</text>
  <text start="414.54" dur="3.9">it I forget whose quote it was but they</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="3.57">said you know you don&amp;#39;t really truly</text>
  <text start="418.44" dur="3.48">understand something unless you can talk</text>
  <text start="419.85" dur="3.24">about it simply so I try to make it very</text>
  <text start="421.92" dur="2.88">simple but also get into some more</text>
  <text start="423.09" dur="3.17">advanced concepts so be looking for that</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="3.6">presentation on this channel very soon</text>
  <text start="426.26" dur="5.68">but the presentations were great and</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="5.96">then two days so two of the five or six</text>
  <text start="431.94" dur="5.97">days to the seminar we all went out on</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="5.86">chartered boats and let me tell you</text>

  <text start="453.26" dur="5.31">there we go</text>
  <text start="454.86" dur="6.78">okay back to what I was discussing so</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="6.1">there was like a hundred to 150 people</text>
  <text start="461.64" dur="5.04">there so that was far greater turnout</text>
  <text start="464.67" dur="3.42">than I figured I thought there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="466.68" dur="5.57">be way less people there so we had to</text>
  <text start="468.09" dur="7.2">charter multiple boats and I was put on</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="5.32">this boats called ocean counters shout</text>
  <text start="475.29" dur="4.2">out to my ocean encounters crew it was</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="5.34">the biggest boat it was like a 35 to 40</text>
  <text start="479.49" dur="5.07">foot boat and there was like 30 25 to 30</text>
  <text start="482.91" dur="5.43">people on it but anyway we went out on</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="7.79">these days and Chris choppy water it was</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="6.57">choppy choppy water gnarly stuff and</text>
  <text start="492.35" dur="4.18">boats rocking back and forth we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="3.54">out there trying to find a bay where the</text>
  <text start="496.53" dur="6.39">dolphins are at so took us you know an</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="8.1">hour of boating to get out to where the</text>
  <text start="502.92" dur="5.1">dolphins were and on the first day we</text>
  <text start="506.55" dur="3.99">were just getting our bearings I had no</text>
  <text start="508.02" dur="5.25">idea what to expect and it was</text>
  <text start="510.54" dur="5.22">incredible though boating out to the bay</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="4.62">there was this bottlenose dolphin that</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="4.17">was following the boat wasn&amp;#39;t following</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="5.25">the boat it was leading the boat it was</text>
  <text start="519.93" dur="4.92">right in front of it surfing the waves</text>
  <text start="523.14" dur="3.33">you know it was like almost touching the</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="3.33">boat knocking it was incredible so this</text>
  <text start="526.47" dur="3.51">bottlenose dolphin I got some pictures</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="4.35">of it was following the boat for good</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="4.77">ten minutes it swam off and then we got</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="4.35">to the particular Bay The Cove</text>
  <text start="534.75" dur="3.93">where the spinner dolphins were so we</text>
  <text start="536.88" dur="2.88">were sweat similar to say swimming with</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="2.76">the spinner dolphins they call him</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="3.33">spinner dolphins because they&amp;#39;ll come up</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="4.26">and jump out of the water and spin and</text>
  <text start="543.09" dur="3.93">do tricks and stuff it&amp;#39;s incredible you</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="3.93">know this is the first time I had ever</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="4.71">seen a dolphin in my life really so I</text>
  <text start="549.63" dur="4.83">was I was having so much fun</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="6.26">so we swam with the spinner dolphins on</text>
  <text start="554.46" dur="6.12">both of these days and it was great</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="5.23">jumping into the water swimming in the</text>
  <text start="560.58" dur="4.41">open ocean waves were a little choppy</text>
  <text start="563.22" dur="3.93">but second day it was a little better</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="6.03">although being able to hear the sonar</text>
  <text start="567.15" dur="6.27">being able to hear the sonar of these</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="5.31">dolphins was just I mean it was</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="5.31">eye-opening truly if you&amp;#39;ve never swam</text>
  <text start="576.33" dur="5.18">with dolphins in your life I would say</text>
  <text start="578.73" dur="5.22">just do it once just do it once and</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="6.31">it&amp;#39;ll be an eye-opening experience for</text>
  <text start="583.95" dur="5.61">you and I was told by the some of the</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="5.34">workers there in the helpers that we can</text>
  <text start="589.56" dur="6.06">hear as humans about 13 2% so let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="593.16" dur="4.74">about 10 to 15% depending on how good</text>
  <text start="595.62" dur="4.86">your hearing is of the dolphin sonar so</text>
  <text start="597.9" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s what 85 to 90% of those</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="4.2">frequencies that aren&amp;#39;t audible to our</text>
  <text start="602.28" dur="4.92">ears but they absolutely affect you</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="6.33">affect your DNA your physical body and</text>
  <text start="607.2" dur="5.55">your mental body as well so it is</text>
  <text start="611.01" dur="3.93">eye-opening it&amp;#39;s a really transformative</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="2.76">experience doing that and I&amp;#39;m very glad</text>
  <text start="614.94" dur="3.23">I did</text>

  <text start="732.55" dur="5.849">like 30 45 minutes to drive down to this</text>
  <text start="735.1" dur="5.52">Cove you guys know how I am with</text>
  <text start="738.399" dur="4.801">pronunciations I&amp;#39;m not even gonna try to</text>

  <text start="743.2" dur="3.18">down there and there were some locals</text>
  <text start="744.73" dur="3.12">there it was pretty out of the way you</text>
  <text start="746.38" dur="3.18">know definitely not on the main road it</text>
  <text start="747.85" dur="5.22">took a while to get there and we were</text>
  <text start="749.56" dur="5.67">chilling at this Cove and after about 15</text>
  <text start="753.07" dur="5.79">minutes of us hanging out there I just</text>
  <text start="755.23" dur="6.75">heard this big boom and then the ground</text>
  <text start="758.86" dur="5.099">shook oh my god what the heck was that</text>
  <text start="761.98" dur="3.54">I didn&amp;#39;t think earthquake at first</text>
  <text start="763.959" dur="2.791">because I heard the boom and then we</text>
  <text start="765.52" dur="4.47">realized oh my gosh that was an</text>
  <text start="766.75" dur="4.649">earthquake and all of a sudden on this</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="4.289">mountainside over here on the other side</text>
  <text start="771.399" dur="6.271">of the cove all these rocks just started</text>
  <text start="774.279" dur="4.981">falling off the mountainside and I</text>
  <text start="777.67" dur="3.87">whipped my phone out really quick got a</text>
  <text start="779.26" dur="4.949">quick video of it if you guys follow me</text>
  <text start="781.54" dur="4.02">on instagram you probably saw some</text>
  <text start="784.209" dur="4.891">pictures and photos and videos that I</text>
  <text start="785.56" dur="5.37">took of it you know quite frankly I want</text>
  <text start="789.1" dur="4.44">to get better at vlogging I will that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="790.93" dur="6.12">a that&amp;#39;s a goal of mine is to get better</text>
  <text start="793.54" dur="6.06">at vlogging but you just want to follow</text>
  <text start="797.05" dur="4.71">me on instagram at je je y se thir</text>
  <text start="799.6" dur="2.4">that&amp;#39;s basically like the vlog that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="801.76" dur="2.46">been</text>
  <text start="802" dur="3.75">that little story function but anyway</text>
  <text start="804.22" dur="3.69">got some pictures and videos of what</text>
  <text start="805.75" dur="3.87">happened and the Hawaii the local Hawaii</text>
  <text start="807.91" dur="4.94">News contacted me they said they want to</text>
  <text start="809.62" dur="6.87">use my video so I said fine go ahead and</text>
  <text start="812.85" dur="6.79">it was it was weird it was really weird</text>
  <text start="816.49" dur="6.81">ended up being a 5.3 magnitude</text>
  <text start="819.64" dur="5.91">earthquake but I&amp;#39;ll be honest it uh it</text>
  <text start="823.3" dur="4.53">could have been an earthquake volcanoes</text>
  <text start="825.55" dur="6.69">out there of course lots of tremors</text>
  <text start="827.83" dur="8.07">rumblings happen but the boom the fact</text>
  <text start="832.24" dur="5.55">that heard this big boom it is very</text>
  <text start="835.9" dur="5.49">weird you know there&amp;#39;s a military base</text>
  <text start="837.79" dur="5.4">there on Big Island of Hawaii and they</text>
  <text start="841.39" dur="3.9">often run readiness exercises and</text>
  <text start="843.19" dur="3.93">whatnot and could very well have stuff</text>
  <text start="845.29" dur="4.8">underground there so the fact that I</text>
  <text start="847.12" dur="6.33">heard a big boom and then the ground</text>
  <text start="850.09" dur="6.84">only rumbled for like a second one or</text>
  <text start="853.45" dur="5.97">two seconds you know I have experienced</text>
  <text start="856.93" dur="7.11">earthquakes before I was here in the</text>
  <text start="859.42" dur="8.55">Pacific Northwest back in 2001 was at</text>
  <text start="864.04" dur="6.51">2000 2001 when that was at 6.8</text>
  <text start="867.97" dur="5.55">earthquake hit and I was in grade school</text>
  <text start="870.55" dur="5.25">then and when that earthquake hit number</text>
  <text start="873.52" dur="6.03">one there was no boom granted I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="875.8" dur="5.4">that close to the epicenter so that</text>
  <text start="879.55" dur="4.5">could have been a factor but no boom and</text>
  <text start="881.2" dur="4.8">it ground shook for 20-30 seconds you</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="4.65">know from my understanding I was pretty</text>
  <text start="886" dur="3.48">good at geology back in the day in high</text>
  <text start="888.7" dur="3.18">school in college</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="5.58">the shakings from an earthquake should</text>
  <text start="891.88" dur="4.76">last a while 10 20 30 seconds</text>
  <text start="895.06" dur="3.9">you know it&amp;#39;s rumbling for a little bit</text>
  <text start="896.64" dur="7.21">this earthquake in Hawaii the five</text>
  <text start="898.96" dur="6.629">pointer boom one second a rumble done so</text>
  <text start="903.85" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s just really peculiar to me and then</text>
  <text start="905.589" dur="5.581">get this so I&amp;#39;m gonna talk to you guys</text>
  <text start="907.3" dur="6.24">about the helicopters we experienced</text>
  <text start="911.17" dur="4.11">that earthquake proved the cove you know</text>
  <text start="913.54" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re like oh yeah the locals were</text>
  <text start="915.28" dur="5.58">there we were like huh and we ended up</text>
  <text start="917.65" dur="5.1">leaving so we left the cove drove back</text>
  <text start="920.86" dur="4.71">up to the Airbnb we still had time to</text>
  <text start="922.75" dur="5.22">kill waiting for them to finish up the</text>
  <text start="925.57" dur="4.71">production they were doing and the Sun</text>
  <text start="927.97" dur="5.61">was going down and we wanted to go watch</text>
  <text start="930.28" dur="5.43">the sunset somewhere so we decided to go</text>
  <text start="933.58" dur="4.29">back to the exact same Cove</text>
  <text start="935.71" dur="4.14">we went back to the same Cove where the</text>
  <text start="937.87" dur="4.38">earthquake happened this was probably an</text>
  <text start="939.85" dur="4.71">hour beforehand kay so we went back to</text>
  <text start="942.25" dur="4.98">the cove to watch the sunset and when we</text>
  <text start="944.56" dur="5.04">got there a Blackhawk started circling</text>
  <text start="947.23" dur="5.58">military helicopter and it had it</text>
  <text start="949.6" dur="5.07">spotlight out and it was searching it</text>
  <text start="952.81" dur="3.66">had it spotlight out on the side of the</text>
  <text start="954.67" dur="4.89">mountain on the other side of the cove</text>
  <text start="956.47" dur="6.75">and then it was flying in circles around</text>
  <text start="959.56" dur="6.899">this spit out there I have pictures of</text>
  <text start="963.22" dur="7.08">all this and I took a long video it was</text>
  <text start="966.459" dur="5.911">circling for probably 10 to 15 minutes</text>
  <text start="970.3" dur="3.24">this helicopter at first I thought it</text>
  <text start="972.37" dur="2.76">was Coast Guard I&amp;#39;m like maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="973.54" dur="3.359">Coast Guard helicopter and there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="975.13" dur="4.05">doing their routine checks after the</text>
  <text start="976.899" dur="4.621">earthquake but after I got a good</text>
  <text start="979.18" dur="5.76">glimpse of this copter it was not red</text>
  <text start="981.52" dur="6.54">and white it was black so that was weird</text>
  <text start="984.94" dur="6.48">that was definitely weird could have</text>
  <text start="988.06" dur="4.08">been something routine you know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="991.42" dur="2.58">I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="992.14" dur="4.009">reveling into the paranoia as people</text>
  <text start="994" dur="5.25">sometimes do but it was just a</text>
  <text start="996.149" dur="4.331">coincidental experience especially being</text>
  <text start="999.25" dur="2.52">at the same Cove right after that</text>
  <text start="1000.48" dur="2.49">earthquake right after we heard the boom</text>
  <text start="1001.77" dur="3.81">there because I was talking to some</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="3.9">other people that were on different</text>
  <text start="1005.58" dur="4.56">parts of the island they felt a shake</text>
  <text start="1006.87" dur="6.14">but they didn&amp;#39;t hear a boom so that</text>
  <text start="1010.14" dur="9.78">happened and then get this yesterday as</text>
  <text start="1013.01" dur="9.28">I was flying out leaving Kona okay I got</text>
  <text start="1019.92" dur="3.93">to Kona Airport if you&amp;#39;ve ever been to</text>
  <text start="1022.29" dur="3.21">Kona Airport it&amp;#39;s not like a normal</text>
  <text start="1023.85" dur="3.66">Airport you&amp;#39;re not in a building as you</text>
  <text start="1025.5" dur="5.37">normally are it&amp;#39;s very open so they</text>
  <text start="1027.51" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t have a roof and you can actually</text>
  <text start="1030.87" dur="4.829">see the tarmac from basically your gate</text>
  <text start="1033.75" dur="4.41">you know it&amp;#39;s very small Airport so I</text>
  <text start="1035.699" dur="4.951">was there in the airport check my bags</text>
  <text start="1038.16" dur="7.64">and everything already hang it out at</text>
  <text start="1040.65" dur="9.9">the gate military helicopter Blackhawk</text>
  <text start="1045.8" dur="8.08">comes in hovers over the tarmac right</text>
  <text start="1050.55" dur="6">outside my gate okay hovers there for a</text>
  <text start="1053.88" dur="4.62">good 20 30 seconds these things are</text>
  <text start="1056.55" dur="3.87">quiet - it&amp;#39;s incredible how quiet they</text>
  <text start="1058.5" dur="4.98">are because it was right there I got a</text>
  <text start="1060.42" dur="5.67">really good picture of this one again on</text>
  <text start="1063.48" dur="4.23">Instagram and thanks the elder dragon</text>
  <text start="1066.09" dur="3.3">appreciate it I&amp;#39;m gonna be talking about</text>
  <text start="1067.71" dur="4.589">the Notre Dame stuff in a video</text>
  <text start="1069.39" dur="4.38">later today I just want to kind of share</text>
  <text start="1072.299" dur="4.621">all these experiences with you guys</text>
  <text start="1073.77" dur="5.659">right now so this helicopter was sitting</text>
  <text start="1076.92" dur="7.65">there very close I mean this thing was</text>
  <text start="1079.429" dur="6.971">100 meters away if that and hovering</text>
  <text start="1084.57" dur="6.239">right over the tarmac and get this this</text>
  <text start="1086.4" dur="7.35">is a public Airport so I&amp;#39;m thinking is</text>
  <text start="1090.809" dur="4.681">this a training exercise I mean could</text>
  <text start="1093.75" dur="4.799">have been I guess but it&amp;#39;s a public</text>
  <text start="1095.49" dur="4.35">Airport they have their their military</text>
  <text start="1098.549" dur="3.361">base up in the mountains they could do</text>
  <text start="1099.84" dur="3.93">this out why is this Black Hawk hovering</text>
  <text start="1101.91" dur="2.94">over a public Airport okay so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1103.77" dur="5.039">hovering there for a few seconds</text>
  <text start="1104.85" dur="5.31">takes off goes up into the sky I walk</text>
  <text start="1108.809" dur="2.731">back through the airport I get a picture</text>
  <text start="1110.16" dur="5.31">of it up in the sky I&amp;#39;m like this is</text>
  <text start="1111.54" dur="8.57">just weird I go back to my gate five</text>
  <text start="1115.47" dur="7.02">minutes later comes back exact same spot</text>
  <text start="1120.11" dur="5.79">hovers over the tarmac it doesn&amp;#39;t land</text>
  <text start="1122.49" dur="6.15">it just hovers there and from what I saw</text>
  <text start="1125.9" dur="6.159">they just hovered but again right up</text>
  <text start="1128.64" dur="6.36">front of my gate same thing and then</text>
  <text start="1132.059" dur="5.101">takes off again and you know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1135" dur="4.02">saying that it was there for me or</text>
  <text start="1137.16" dur="4.5">anything I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not going into that</text>
  <text start="1139.02" dur="4.26">but again just coincidental man like</text>
  <text start="1141.66" dur="2.85">multiple helicopter experiences and the</text>
  <text start="1143.28" dur="3.029">fact that that one yesterday was</text>
  <text start="1144.51" dur="4.4">hovering over a public Airport took off</text>
  <text start="1146.309" dur="6.631">came back took off again</text>
  <text start="1148.91" dur="6.34">weird stuff weird stuff you know I had a</text>
  <text start="1152.94" dur="4.65">I had another helicopter experience and</text>
  <text start="1155.25" dur="5.52">this one&amp;#39;s intriguing at the very</text>
  <text start="1157.59" dur="5.13">beginning of cues drops when Q first</text>

  <text start="1182.85" dur="5.97">stuff I was talking about it about 20</text>
  <text start="1186.63" dur="4.08">seconds after I finished my video this</text>
  <text start="1188.82" dur="6.42">helicopter black helicopter goes right</text>
  <text start="1190.71" dur="7.709">over the house and then go is probably a</text>
  <text start="1195.24" dur="5.22">half mile to a mile away and then turns</text>
  <text start="1198.419" dur="4.271">and then goes perpendicular to the house</text>
  <text start="1200.46" dur="5.649">so hope</text>
  <text start="1202.69" dur="5.459">there&amp;#39;s just a few weird experiences I</text>
  <text start="1206.109" dur="5.88">could share a couple more but won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1208.149" dur="6.98">waste your time anyway so that was good</text>
