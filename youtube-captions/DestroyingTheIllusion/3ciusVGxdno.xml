  <text start="276.889" dur="3.721">gonna use the price of gold to do it and</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="3.36">then that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="3.75">like central banks have been buying gold</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="4.709">for last 10 years while they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="5.67">suppressing it for them for the common</text>
  <text start="286.819" dur="5.13">people look at JP Morgan own 54 million</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="3.509">ounces of all these central banks are</text>
  <text start="291.949" dur="3.481">trying to buy up precious metals as much</text>

  <text start="300.74" dur="4.019">to protect ourselves yeah so I mean look</text>
  <text start="302.629" dur="4.561">here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the thing so you get out</text>
  <text start="304.759" dur="4.111">of the banking system crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="5.46">really the only currency that has a</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="7.769">liability to a bank okay so so Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="312.65" dur="6.329">at Al is gonna be the currency of choice</text>
  <text start="316.639" dur="4.68">what I think for international trade and</text>
  <text start="318.979" dur="4.801">then internally people are gonna have to</text>
  <text start="321.319" dur="7.56">own you know income producing assets</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="6.539">that that are not debt entitled so that</text>
  <text start="328.879" dur="4.141">means you know the only gold you own</text>
  <text start="330.319" dur="4.38">silver your own platinum palladium you</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="3.899">know you have income producing farm</text>

  <text start="336.919" dur="5.461">we&amp;#39;re gonna go until they come up with a</text>
  <text start="339.319" dur="4.771">new currency regime and those are the</text>
  <text start="342.38" dur="3.27">areas in which we&amp;#39;re focusing on and</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="3.03">then you throw it a grand solar minimum</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="4.019">on top of this Jordan I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="5.12">much you guys talk about that but price</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="5.161">of food is gonna go through the roof</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="3.88">United States will be okay but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="3.809">gonna be places around the world that</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="4.47">are tied to the dollar and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="358.639" dur="3.96">feed their people that&amp;#39;s what the Arab</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="4.919">Spring was all about in 2011 we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="362.599" dur="4.771">see that in spades and we think China is</text>
  <text start="365.509" dur="4.291">gonna be the one that&amp;#39;s really gonna get</text>
  <text start="367.37" dur="4.019">hit because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re pig</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="3.239">population they may have they may have</text>
  <text start="371.389" dur="4.111">to kill a hundred percent of the pigs</text>
  <text start="373.039" dur="4.981">and and now that things starting to</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="5.129">drift into Europe Jordan and so when</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="5.399">that happens it&amp;#39;s Katie bar the door and</text>
  <text start="380.629" dur="4.861">and you know you if your currency is bad</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="5.041">which China&amp;#39;s is that doesn&amp;#39;t trade and</text>

  <text start="391.31" dur="4.979">right now it&amp;#39;s not a really tenable</text>
  <text start="394.07" dur="4.23">position for them so yeah when you bring</text>
  <text start="396.289" dur="3.331">up that grand solar minimum that</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="2.91">actually dives into a lot of very</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="3.51">important issues like these these</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="4.259">changes we see going on with things like</text>
  <text start="403.13" dur="4.2">ie our climate there&amp;#39;s a lot of greater</text>
  <text start="405.469" dur="3.151">causes for that and greater changes that</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="3.6">are coming up that we need to prepare</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="5.099">for so you bring you know food shortage</text>
  <text start="410.93" dur="3.959">is something absolutely important to</text>
  <text start="413.719" dur="3.06">think about when we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="414.889" dur="3.93">world economies they learn how to grow</text>
  <text start="416.779" dur="4.021">food and that&amp;#39;s eriously and I&amp;#39;m up</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="3.991">being that I&amp;#39;m not being dramatic oh and</text>
