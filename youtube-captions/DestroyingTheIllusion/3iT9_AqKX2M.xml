  <text start="12.65" dur="6.24">what&amp;#39;s going on ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="15.049" dur="6.361">it&amp;#39;s Tuesday September 26 won&amp;#39;t be back</text>
  <text start="18.89" dur="4.74">home to my whiteboard in my razor in a</text>
  <text start="21.41" dur="4.4">couple days but that&amp;#39;s not gonna stop me</text>
  <text start="23.63" dur="4.739">from doing these videos for you guys and</text>
  <text start="25.81" dur="5.92">today&amp;#39;s video is going to be on this</text>
  <text start="28.369" dur="5.221">whole NFL standing kneeling controversy</text>
  <text start="31.73" dur="4.98">that we have going on because I got a</text>
  <text start="33.59" dur="6.84">great question yesterday from a friend</text>
  <text start="36.71" dur="7.02">of mine we&amp;#39;ll call him JC and he says I</text>
  <text start="40.43" dur="5.879">do believe the whole NFL protesting</text>
  <text start="43.73" dur="5.16">can be annoying but if people understood</text>
  <text start="46.309" dur="5.101">the power of empathy for one another to</text>
  <text start="48.89" dur="4.98">understand why people are protesting we</text>
  <text start="51.41" dur="6.3">could be a tiny bit closer to a utopia</text>
  <text start="53.87" dur="5.789">of understanding for each other true but</text>
  <text start="57.71" dur="3.809">I feel like there&amp;#39;s no way to explain</text>
  <text start="59.659" dur="4.381">that to people so do you have any advice</text>
  <text start="61.519" dur="5.581">or working on any post that covers that</text>
  <text start="64.04" dur="4.68">topic well luckily I have a YouTube</text>
  <text start="67.1" dur="4.08">channel where I can rant to my heart&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="68.72" dur="4.05">content and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of this</text>
  <text start="71.18" dur="3.39">topic quite deeply over the past couple</text>
  <text start="72.77" dur="7.92">days so that&amp;#39;s why I want to do a video</text>
  <text start="74.57" dur="9.84">on it and where to begin so I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="80.69" dur="6.72">best begin by rephrasing kind of exactly</text>
  <text start="84.41" dur="5.85">what he said in there and that he</text>
  <text start="87.41" dur="5.67">mentioned that if only we had empathy to</text>
  <text start="90.26" dur="5.31">understand why people are protesting you</text>
  <text start="93.08" dur="6.03">know we could be a little bit closer to</text>
  <text start="95.57" dur="6.24">he called it a utopia you know good good</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="5.4">way to put it but from my perspective</text>
  <text start="101.81" dur="6.03">and again all I can offer here is what</text>
  <text start="104.51" dur="7.62">I&amp;#39;m seeing in my perspective I think all</text>
  <text start="107.84" dur="8.04">sides need empathizing here so basically</text>
  <text start="112.13" dur="5.55">what&amp;#39;s going on is that of course we all</text>
  <text start="115.88" dur="4.86">know that there&amp;#39;s the divide and conquer</text>
  <text start="117.68" dur="6.06">strategy that the powers that be used to</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="5.34">keep us in line or keep us distracted at</text>
  <text start="123.74" dur="4.859">at each other&amp;#39;s throats so they can then</text>
  <text start="126.08" dur="5.159">advance their agenda and in this</text>
  <text start="128.599" dur="4.561">instance it&amp;#39;s not even the fact that the</text>
  <text start="131.239" dur="4.021">powers that be have to foster that</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="4.68">divide and conquer we&amp;#39;re all just</text>
  <text start="135.26" dur="4.17">dividing each other on our own and going</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="4.44">at each other&amp;#39;s throats so it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="6.51">sad situation we have here and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="5.28">why I say that one side</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t have to have empathy for the</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="4.41">other we need both sides to have empathy</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="4.95">for the other and essentially what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="6.24">going on is that people are I mean if</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re not completely looking at this</text>
  <text start="158.21" dur="5.52">objectively not on either side of the</text>
  <text start="160.82" dur="5.13">aisle like I am I mean standing kneeling</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="5.13">I think there&amp;#39;s many more things to be</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="5.22">offended about by than this controversy</text>
  <text start="168.86" dur="3.33">but for the people that are getting</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="3.09">sucked into it</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re polarizing into two categories</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;ve got the standards and the kneelers</text>
  <text start="176.36" dur="5.94">as I&amp;#39;ll call them so we really have to I</text>
  <text start="180.35" dur="4.38">mean people on both sides of this aisle</text>
  <text start="182.3" dur="4.65">need to have empathy for each other when</text>
  <text start="184.73" dur="5.4">you look at the standards the people who</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="7.17">are very passionate and the national</text>
  <text start="190.13" dur="5.37">anthem who are very upset by these</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="3.81">people who they believe are</text>
  <text start="195.5" dur="4.5">disrespecting the flag by kneeling you</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="4.2">know we have to have empathy for their</text>
  <text start="200" dur="6.93">situation and that most of these people</text>
  <text start="202.13" dur="7.56">who are passionate by the flag they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="5.01">probably doing you know multiple tours</text>
  <text start="209.69" dur="4.59">in Iraq many of them are probably vets</text>
  <text start="211.94" dur="4.65">who have laid it all on the line by</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="4.41">signing up for the military and we can</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="4.59">you know debate what the military is</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="6.54">actually used for these days but they</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="8.13">have from their perspective sacrificed</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="6.69">and done quite a lot for you know in</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="5.31">their opinion the flag we need to honor</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="4.77">that we need to respect that we also</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="4.2">need to respect the kneelers because</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="3.59">many people who are kneeling I mean</text>
  <text start="238.82" dur="5.73">let&amp;#39;s just see it from their perspective</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="6.91">they&amp;#39;ve probably been in a bad situation</text>
  <text start="244.55" dur="3.78">with a police officer maybe some of</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="3.57">their friends and family have been</text>
  <text start="248.33" dur="5.64">subjugated to a bad situation by a cop</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="5.4">or many of them are feeling oppressed or</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="5.21">they feel like their ancestors are</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="5.25">oppressed so they&amp;#39;re doing something</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="4.18">maybe they could be doing something more</text>
  <text start="261.41" dur="4.92">than just kneeling but we need to</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="5.43">respect the fact that they are trying to</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="5.07">get their word in their opinion and</text>
  <text start="268.79" dur="5.61">their own passion out there in their own</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="5.61">way to stand up for what they believe is</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="5.37">right so whether you are a stander or</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="4.2">you are a kneeler empathy</text>
  <text start="279.77" dur="3.299">and look to the other side of the aisle</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="7.29">and understand why they&amp;#39;re doing what</text>
  <text start="283.069" dur="7.291">they&amp;#39;re doing okay but now let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="4.56">the big picture let&amp;#39;s take a step back</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="5.459">and try to see it all objectively for</text>
  <text start="293.06" dur="5.94">what it is of course many of these</text>
  <text start="295.819" dur="6.961">standards don&amp;#39;t necessarily necessarily</text>
  <text start="299" dur="8.069">realize that America is basically used</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="7.68">as cannon fodder as the military arm of</text>
  <text start="307.069" dur="6.241">this new world order agenda and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="6.42">necessarily have a truly free country</text>
  <text start="313.31" dur="6.15">here yes we have you know a few more</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="4.939">freedoms comparatively to maybe some</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="7.79">other countries but we are nowhere near</text>
  <text start="321.819" dur="8.44">truly free nor sovereign here okay and</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="7.389">then if you look at the kneeler side of</text>
  <text start="330.259" dur="6.75">the aisle there is so much more that can</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="5.641">be done to change things here than by</text>
  <text start="337.009" dur="4.981">kneeling at a sporting event and I</text>
  <text start="340.28" dur="3.78">venture to guess I mean of course I</text>
  <text start="341.99" dur="5.669">don&amp;#39;t know but I would venture to say</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="6.57">that many people who are kneeling don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.659" dur="5.75">even realize how deep this corruption</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="6.089">really goes and you know unfortunately</text>
  <text start="353.409" dur="7.781">they&amp;#39;re they have really no idea what</text>
  <text start="356.719" dur="7.771">they&amp;#39;re kneeling for so from the big</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="6.21">picture you know whether you&amp;#39;re standing</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="5.13">or you&amp;#39;re kneeling we need to have this</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="4.169">idea we need to come together right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="5.729">all about unity here and we need to have</text>
  <text start="371.569" dur="5.91">this idea that we can&amp;#39;t be distracted by</text>
  <text start="375.349" dur="4.5">these silly sporting corporate sporting</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="4.291">events and whether you&amp;#39;re standing or</text>
  <text start="379.849" dur="4.231">kneeling if we&amp;#39;re really gonna enact</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="3.69">change here we need to understand if</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re standing for the flag</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="4.92">I respect you I&amp;#39;m sure you have given up</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="9.06">a lot to be where you&amp;#39;re at right now</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="11.31">but we ain&amp;#39;t free here and there&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="6.959">more that needs to be done than praying</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="5.879">to the flag or singing a national anthem</text>
  <text start="404.539" dur="3.961">and some egos need to be that broken</text>
  <text start="407.569" dur="4.91">down that&amp;#39;s really what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="3.979">it&amp;#39;s about breaking down our egos and</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="4.06">breaking down the barriers of ignorance</text>
  <text start="414.88" dur="3.92">the people who are praying to the flag</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="4.95">unfortunately a pretty ignorant as to</text>
  <text start="418.8" dur="4.75">what our military has been used for and</text>
  <text start="421.57" dur="3.6">what might be going on with our country</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="3.75">what our country is being used for</text>
  <text start="425.17" dur="6.18">unfortunately many people who are</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="6.06">kneeling little do they know what they</text>
  <text start="431.35" dur="3.75">truly need to be doing to enact change</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="3.45">here that&amp;#39;s a whole different a</text>
  <text start="435.1" dur="4.8">different conversation and you know I</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="5.73">can I will do a video discussing some</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="4.83">things that we can do here and now to</text>
  <text start="442.54" dur="4.26">begin enacting that change far more than</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="4.62">just kneeling but you know back to a</text>
  <text start="446.8" dur="6.9">point in case here kneelers need to get</text>
  <text start="449.35" dur="6.15">what they really need to do to break</text>
  <text start="453.7" dur="3.96">past that ignorance and to enact the</text>
  <text start="455.5" dur="4.71">change so case in point</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="4.92">I mean don&amp;#39;t let yourself be divided and</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="4.68">conquered you know understand that</text>
  <text start="462.58" dur="5.46">perspective is everything there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="464.89" dur="6.03">one absolute truth but that one absolute</text>
  <text start="468.04" dur="5.85">truth none of us is nowhere near we only</text>
  <text start="470.92" dur="6.24">have our singular respective</text>
  <text start="473.89" dur="5.79">perspectives and we need to empathize</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="5.22">that everybody is looking through their</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="4.14">own personal lens but their own personal</text>
  <text start="482.38" dur="3.81">lens is only going to be that much</text>
  <text start="483.82" dur="7.41">there&amp;#39;s so much more that we&amp;#39;re ignorant</text>
  <text start="486.19" dur="8.79">about and you know this this country is</text>
  <text start="491.23" dur="6.39">not truly free we have to get licenses</text>
  <text start="494.98" dur="4.74">just to do pretty much everything and</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s so many things we can be docked</text>
  <text start="499.72" dur="5.97">for by a cop with the aren&amp;#39;t even crimes</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="6.39">no victim no crime so we&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="505.69" dur="5.1">free in this country but as a society we</text>
  <text start="509.41" dur="3.09">need to understand what we really need</text>
  <text start="510.79" dur="3.78">to do to enact that change and kneeling</text>
  <text start="512.5" dur="4.61">at sporting events isn&amp;#39;t gonna be that</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="5.61">so again</text>
  <text start="517.11" dur="5.83">empathize understand everybody has their</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="6.42">own perspectives but understand that you</text>
  <text start="522.94" dur="5.49">as well as everybody else is I mean we</text>
  <text start="526.6" dur="5.33">all have a bit of ignorance and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="7.26">about overcoming that and then truly</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="5.32">doing things that enact honest change so</text>
  <text start="535.69" dur="3.69">those are the words that I wanted to</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="6.27">share with you for today I&amp;#39;m sorry if I</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="5.13">got a bit repetitive there but you know</text>
  <text start="543.52" dur="3.14">it hurt</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="6.33">it hurts my heart to see so many people</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="7.75">at each other&amp;#39;s throats by their own</text>
  <text start="550.84" dur="5.67">accord I mean again for the you know the</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="3.78">mainstream media is just that catalyst a</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="3.36">lot of people are just they&amp;#39;re so tense</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="3.36">and they&amp;#39;re ready they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.87" dur="3.63">ready to fight and we can&amp;#39;t be that way</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="5.97">we have to see each other&amp;#39;s perspectives</text>
  <text start="563.5" dur="6.03">and all come together and make an effort</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="6.77">through means that will actually make a</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="4.76">difference to enact real change done</text>
