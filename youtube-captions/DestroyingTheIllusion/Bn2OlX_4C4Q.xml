  <text start="108.75" dur="6.21">the status quo and then ended up just</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="3.239">obviously not putting my heart and soul</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="1.979">into it because I didn&amp;#39;t like what I was</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="2.881">doing it with therefore construction</text>

  <text start="143.83" dur="4.44">a local health food store and this is</text>
  <text start="145.75" dur="6.99">really what catalyzed me and just you</text>
  <text start="148.27" dur="6">know blew my third eye open ended up</text>
  <text start="152.74" dur="2.82">dropping out of college for and at this</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="3.39">health food store it was a very</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="5.34">prominent it was local they only had a</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="5.31">couple stores but very very</text>
  <text start="160.9" dur="7.14">well-connected in what we had there and</text>
  <text start="162.97" dur="6.66">what we did and you know first I ended I</text>
  <text start="168.04" dur="5.25">learned about you know the reality of</text>
  <text start="169.63" dur="5.7">genetically engineered foods but we work</text>
  <text start="173.29" dur="5.19">very close with a couple documentaries</text>
  <text start="175.33" dur="4.92">that were made about that and vaccines</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="3.24">about fluoride about the reality of the</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="3.6">healthcare system the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="5.61">system like all that jazz and what true</text>
  <text start="183.85" dur="5.52">health really is so that just absolutely</text>
  <text start="187.33" dur="3.9">blew my mind and then from that I mean</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="4.68">obviously going down those rabbit holes</text>
  <text start="191.23" dur="4.77">just with the holistic thinker I kind of</text>
  <text start="194.05" dur="4.53">am I wanted to know everything I just</text>
  <text start="196" dur="3.72">had a drive for good I was sick of you</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="2.46">know once I found out there&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="3.33">bit of lies I&amp;#39;m like okay we got to</text>
  <text start="201.04" dur="6.27">uncover this all so it took a toll on me</text>
  <text start="203.05" dur="7.56">it took a harsh toll on me and you know</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="5.67">obviously going into not only the health</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="4.92">stuff but boom chemtrails financial</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="4.68">system I was always interested in the</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="3.84">UFO issue so obviously I tried to</text>
  <text start="217.66" dur="3.27">educate myself as much as I could about</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="6.06">that and and really what was going on in</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="6.3">the world and boom so I ended up working</text>
  <text start="225.43" dur="3.6">at that place for five years right and I</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="4.55">met a lot of fantastic people I learned</text>
  <text start="229.03" dur="5.67">a lot of great stuff but really liked</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="4.959">what I was doing on the online gig I</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="4.14">just never write I even shut my internet</text>
  <text start="236.739" dur="4.921">off I was the kid with the hippo for his</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="4.38">laptop so I never wanted to I mean I</text>
  <text start="241.66" dur="3.06">just wasn&amp;#39;t active on that but I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="3.38">learning right I still go into all the</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="4.23">websites and just sucking it all in</text>
  <text start="246.6" dur="7.69">after I left that health food place I</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="6.33">went into just working at a few worked</text>
  <text start="254.29" dur="2.22">at a couple gyms working on another</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="3.42">health food store and kind of bounced</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="4.02">around worked for a chiropractor so I</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="3.75">had full knowledge of holistic health</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="3.81">but I ended up just getting to a point</text>
  <text start="262.45" dur="2.87">where I couldn&amp;#39;t and this is just</text>
  <text start="264.34" dur="2.96">probably six months ago</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="4.35">a few months ago but I just couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
