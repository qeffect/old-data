  <text start="72.45" dur="4.47">whatever other residues or nanoparticles</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="3.841">might be you know injected into us or</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.33">sprayed over our heads a lot of these</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="5.07">things they&amp;#39;ll help as well so this is</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="5.61">really the techniques I&amp;#39;m going to offer</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="3.81">you today are really for deep cellular</text>
  <text start="85.86" dur="3.6">cleansing I&amp;#39;m gonna offer you some</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="3">general just kind of overall healthy</text>
  <text start="89.46" dur="2.31">things that will help with</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="3.18">detoxification but then I&amp;#39;ll also</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="4.02">include some foods and supplements that</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="4.05">will really work at the cellular level</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="3.149">we&amp;#39;re not really talking like Oh a</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="3.15">digestive cleanse or something that</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="6.031">effect we&amp;#39;re talking about getting heavy</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="6.899">metals PCBs mycoplasma is potentially a</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="4.35">lot of other things that are deeply</text>
  <text start="107.549" dur="3.21">ingrained into us I mean the mercury is</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="3.869">and aluminum&amp;#39;s that get into our nervous</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="4.261">system we&amp;#39;re attacking that so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.189" dur="3.151">the point of this video per se I want to</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="5.79">make that clear but first and foremost</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="6.959">water just simply water water is the the</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="5.07">easiest thing that you can do to really</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="5.641">feel better get more energy detoxify I</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="3.769">mean it&amp;#39;s so easy but it&amp;#39;s so often</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="3.049">overlooked</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="3.961">and purify obviously is gonna be best</text>
  <text start="131.989" dur="3.151">and I often get the question you know</text>
  <text start="133.61" dur="4.26">what&amp;#39;s the best type of purification</text>
  <text start="135.14" dur="5.519">method well my opinion is reverse</text>
  <text start="137.87" dur="5.58">osmosis so you get reverse osmosis</text>
  <text start="140.659" dur="4.351">filtrated water to drink and hopefully</text>
  <text start="143.45" dur="3.45">you know if you can afford it you get</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="3.99">filter systems for your home as well</text>
  <text start="146.9" dur="4.649">there&amp;#39;s you should get a filter system</text>
  <text start="149" dur="4.62">for your drinking water but also don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="151.549" dur="4.261">forget your shower head because that hot</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="4.05">water is pouring onto your body opening</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="3.989">up your pores and your skin will absorb</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="4.469">anything that&amp;#39;s in the water there as</text>
  <text start="159.799" dur="3.601">well so get a shower filtration system</text>
  <text start="162.139" dur="2.25">and that I mean if you can afford it</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="3.869">just get one for your whole freaking</text>
  <text start="164.389" dur="5.1">house so reverse osmosis purified water</text>
  <text start="167.269" dur="4.59">and then the amount the amount to</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="5.22">consume for your body this is something</text>
  <text start="171.859" dur="5.371">a lot of people often overlook as well</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="5.191">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of bad info put</text>
  <text start="177.23" dur="5.58">out there by the health authorities one</text>
  <text start="179.9" dur="4.44">of those facts is you know 8 cups a day</text>
  <text start="182.81" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s all you really hear 8 cups a day</text>
  <text start="184.34" dur="5.72">that&amp;#39;s only 64 ounces so that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="5.009">quite enough I mean that&amp;#39;s really only</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="4.6">beneficial that&amp;#39;s really only enough for</text>
  <text start="191.959" dur="4.68">a small adult so the cardinal rule take</text>
  <text start="194.66" dur="3.87">your body weight in pounds divide that</text>
  <text start="196.639" dur="3.21">by two and that&amp;#39;s how many average</text>
  <text start="198.53" dur="4.169">ounces you should be hitting a day so</text>
  <text start="199.849" dur="4.53">for a 200-pound human roughly a hundred</text>
  <text start="202.699" dur="4.171">ounces if it&amp;#39;s hot out or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.379" dur="5.79">exercising maybe up that by 10 to 20</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="5.429">ounces so you know I weigh about 170 I</text>
  <text start="210.169" dur="3.63">usually try to get between 90 and 100</text>
  <text start="212.299" dur="4.02">ounces per day per day because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="213.799" dur="4.02">athletic and I swept normally every day</text>
  <text start="216.319" dur="4.32">so half your body weight in ounces</text>
  <text start="217.819" dur="4.471">cardinal rule and then you can also add</text>
  <text start="220.639" dur="3.09">things to your water you can add</text>
  <text start="222.29" dur="2.789">electrolytes there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="223.729" dur="2.97">electrolyte tablets you can add your</text>
  <text start="225.079" dur="3.961">water electrolyte packs things like that</text>
  <text start="226.699" dur="4.831">if you are sweating up quite a bit or in</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="3.93">a very humid climate minerals you know</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="4.679">trace mineral drops you can add to your</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="6.259">water and I often add what&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="4.95">dissolved oxygen drops I often do and I</text>
  <text start="239.229" dur="5.47">recommend but I do these ones called</text>
  <text start="241.159" dur="6.45">cell food and I add one drop per ounce</text>
  <text start="244.699" dur="5.25">of water and I usually do 16 to 24 drops</text>
  <text start="247.609" dur="3.75">a day so a cup or two of cell food a day</text>
  <text start="249.949" dur="5.18">along with all the other water I drink</text>
  <text start="251.359" dur="3.77">but it just adds a bump a bunch of</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="3.631">won&amp;#39;t get into the science behind it but</text>
  <text start="257.479" dur="4.41">just extra oxygenation for your system</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="5.1">and we know oxygen oxygenation leads to</text>
  <text start="261.889" dur="3.961">more alkalinity so more oxygenation and</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="3.539">more hydration more alkalinity for your</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="3.569">body so bunch of things you can check</text>
  <text start="267.979" dur="2.731">out and I&amp;#39;ll even I&amp;#39;ll add a link for</text>
  <text start="269.419" dur="3.511">that cell food stuff that I use down</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="4.679">below so there&amp;#39;s some tips on water and</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="4.53">then we get into fasting and with</text>
  <text start="275.389" dur="4.411">fasting there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
  <text start="277.46" dur="4.37">methods you can use really the only ones</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ve ever done</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="5.589">you often hear what&amp;#39;s called if</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="5.67">intermittent fasting where you only eat</text>
  <text start="287.419" dur="4.261">for about half a day and this is how I</text>
  <text start="289.76" dur="7.35">kind of normally live my life anyway I</text>
  <text start="291.68" dur="7.23">don&amp;#39;t eat for long durations during the</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="4.47">day in the morning I you actually don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="298.91" dur="4.2">usually eat till about 11 or 12 so for</text>
  <text start="301.58" dur="4.02">the morning what I&amp;#39;m doing is normally</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="4.98">drinking water liquids and whatnot but I</text>
  <text start="305.6" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t eat solid food till about noon ish</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="3.449">and then I&amp;#39;ll stop eating around maybe</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="6">seven or eight so intermittent fasting</text>
  <text start="311.539" dur="5.97">is partial day fasting in a way so you</text>
  <text start="315.62" dur="3.93">can try that out that&amp;#39;s a way just to</text>
  <text start="317.509" dur="6.001">give your organs a break fasting is</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="5.489">really good just to yeah basically give</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="4.409">your body a break because we spend so</text>
  <text start="325.039" dur="5.491">much time and energy digesting food that</text>
  <text start="327.919" dur="4.201">when you&amp;#39;re not not as much energy your</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="3.09">blood is going to your digestive organs</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="4.229">that go to the rest of your body and</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="4.079">give your immune system you know time to</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="3.6">rebuild your nervous system time to</text>
  <text start="337.699" dur="4.321">rebuild so fasting is good at intimate</text>
  <text start="339.949" dur="4.411">fasting I recommend full day fasting</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;ve done this before but I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="4.14">active that I don&amp;#39;t normally like to do</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="4.319">fasting for longer than an intermittent</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="3.78">level before they fasting I mean you can</text>
  <text start="350.659" dur="3.951">drink like distilled water all day</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s a really good way to get a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="4.239">inorganic hardened minerals out of your</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="3.87">body and a lot of toxins is just do a</text>
  <text start="358.849" dur="4.171">day or get a gallon of distilled water</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="3.75">and drink that all day don&amp;#39;t try not to</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="3.149">eat anything so that&amp;#39;s another thing you</text>
  <text start="364.88" dur="2.73">can do and then there&amp;#39;s juice cleansing</text>
  <text start="366.169" dur="2.901">a lot of people get into juice cleansing</text>
  <text start="367.61" dur="4.529">but I don&amp;#39;t really like to do that</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="4.42">personally because again I&amp;#39;m so active I</text>
  <text start="372.139" dur="4.141">don&amp;#39;t like to go more than a couple days</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="4.919">without eating copious amounts of food</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="3.93">but you can look into juice cleansing as</text>
  <text start="378.409" dur="2.751">well I suggest maybe a 1 to 3 days of</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="3.44">that some people do</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="4.59">or you could check more into their</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="4.53">theories and whatnot as well so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.75" dur="5.1">some stuff on fasting and then sweating</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="5.43">you know got a sweat everyday sweat out</text>
  <text start="390.85" dur="5.22">toxins sweating so you can do you know</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="4.77">exercise or even saunas things like that</text>
  <text start="396.07" dur="3.69">infrared saunas and then rebounding</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="2.85">rebounding is also a great way to</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="4.2">detoxify your body because you&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="401.23" dur="5.19">to move lymph fluid and a lot of bad</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="4.26">fluid throughout your body and out so</text>
  <text start="406.42" dur="3.54">rebounding and sweating just a couple</text>
  <text start="408.22" dur="3.51">little things to keep in mind if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.96" dur="3.12">trying to detoxify and then there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="411.73" dur="5.04">lot of foods and supplements out there</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="5.91">as well so one food I try to get in</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="4.26">quite a bit is cilantro I like to juice</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="3.89">a lot of cilantro or just chop it up</text>
  <text start="421.03" dur="5.16">throw and throw it on my salads but</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="5.02">cilantro is very helpful at cleansing</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="3.66">heavy metals like mercury and aluminum</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="3.51">we out of your body so get that into</text>
  <text start="429.85" dur="4.02">your salads and into your body a lot</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="4.98">more chlorella is a really good</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="4.68">supplement to look into chlorella you</text>
  <text start="436.39" dur="4.44">can buy in tablets or you can buy in</text>
  <text start="438.55" dur="5.04">powdered form I&amp;#39;ll put a link below the</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="5.64">curl up chlorella chlorella that I like</text>
  <text start="443.59" dur="5.25">to use but I just use a powder and I</text>
  <text start="446.47" dur="4.56">throw a powder in water it tastes kind</text>
  <text start="448.84" dur="3.69">of here so if you can stomach it do it</text>
  <text start="451.03" dur="3.03">in water but you can also do it and</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="2.04">smoothies anything like that just get it</text>
  <text start="454.06" dur="3.9">into your body</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="5.88">but chlorella is an algae that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="4.26">high in protein very high in chlorophyll</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s a very dark green so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="462.22" dur="5.28">oxygenating but the cells the specific</text>
  <text start="465.7" dur="3.15">cells of chlorella are very good they</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="3.27">have a very fibrous cell wall and</text>
  <text start="468.85" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re very good at attaching on to</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="3.17">heavy metals and things like that so</text>
  <text start="472.39" dur="4.11">chlorella is very effective at</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="4.3">detoxifying the Mercury&amp;#39;s leds</text>
  <text start="476.5" dur="4.77">aluminum&amp;#39;s on your body and then</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="4.59">zeolites zeolites are another supplement</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="4.56">that you can buy in a pillar and powder</text>
  <text start="482.83" dur="5.07">form but these ones it&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text>
  <text start="485.83" dur="4.11">a food so chlorella I like because</text>
  <text start="487.9" dur="3.84">chlorella is technically a food it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="3.78">very cleansing but there&amp;#39;s also proteins</text>
  <text start="491.74" dur="5.34">and good fats and whatnot in there lots</text>
  <text start="493.72" dur="5.58">of vitamin C and antioxidants and</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="4.98">chlorella zeolite itself is not</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="5.369">technically a food it&amp;#39;s just a cleansing</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="6.96">supplement so what zeolites are is a</text>
  <text start="504.669" dur="5.131">form of like a form of organic matter</text>
  <text start="509.02" dur="2.85">that often</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="3.929">rose around there&amp;#39;s not grown it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="5.49">essentially made it&amp;#39;s made around</text>
  <text start="513.729" dur="6.12">Springs and a zeolite is a type of humic</text>
  <text start="517.36" dur="5.849">acid that is ana cage-like structure and</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="5.55">when you ingest it it&amp;#39;s very safe it</text>
  <text start="523.209" dur="6.57">won&amp;#39;t harm you and the way it detoxifies</text>
  <text start="525.399" dur="5.821">you is by getting attaching cage-like</text>
  <text start="529.779" dur="2.641">structure attaches onto the poisons and</text>
