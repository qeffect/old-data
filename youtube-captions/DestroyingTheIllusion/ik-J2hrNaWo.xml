  <text start="354.42" dur="3.69">bunch of crazy posts being posted on</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="3.66">eight Coon right now and again those</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="3.99">shells they jump at any opportunity they</text>
  <text start="360" dur="4.83">can and no doubt they&amp;#39;re already trying</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="4.89">to get onto eight Coon and post violent</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="3.54">hateful looking stuff on there so then</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="3.12">the mainstream media journalists they</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="3.45">can turn around and say oh look how much</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="4.23">hateful violent stuffs already on eight</text>
  <text start="371.82" dur="4.32">Coon we should shut it down again okay</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="4.83">so uh things are just going to get</text>
  <text start="376.14" dur="4.04">really intense from here there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="379.17" dur="3.29">be a lot of propaganda</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="7.3">counter-propaganda out there you know</text>
  <text start="382.46" dur="6.7">COINTELPRO operations trying to try to</text>
  <text start="387.48" dur="2.88">bring forth the deep state agenda so</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="3.75">just be careful of that</text>

  <text start="399.99" dur="3.69">till things get smooth</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="3.99">out on the back end of eight coon before</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="5.13">they start posting again so it might be</text>
  <text start="405.3" dur="5.07">a few days realistically if and when Q</text>
  <text start="408.81" dur="3.21">does start posting again so just be</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="6.12">mindful of that you know they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
