  <text start="207.13" dur="8.61">getting straight erased and then I also</text>

  <text start="215.74" dur="4.32">lot of politicians Twitter accounts you</text>
  <text start="218.74" dur="3.21">know deep state or Twitter accounts</text>

  <text start="248.5" dur="5.97">the truth suppress information that</text>
  <text start="251.11" dur="5.4">harms their official narratives and then</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s quite obvious that they inflate</text>

  <text start="1266.89" dur="5.82">they need more aborted fetal tissue is</text>
  <text start="1271.03" dur="5.19">this one of the reasons why this debate</text>
  <text start="1272.71" dur="5.76">that Y or I should say there&amp;#39;s this push</text>

  <text start="1517.12" dur="3.48">right there</text>
  <text start="1517.66" dur="4.86">so uh does correlation equal causation</text>
  <text start="1520.6" dur="5.63">with vaccines actually reducing disease</text>
  <text start="1522.52" dur="9">oh damn good question damn good question</text>

  <text start="1586.36" dur="6.54">the media complex operation Mockingbird</text>
  <text start="1590.04" dur="5.259">why does our mainstream media now use so</text>
  <text start="1592.9" dur="4.49">many of the exact same techniques that</text>
  <text start="1595.299" dur="4.701">Nazi propaganda did in World War two</text>
  <text start="1597.39" dur="7.36">same mind-control techniques you know</text>
  <text start="1600" dur="5.53">these Nazi assets agents scientists went</text>
  <text start="1604.75" dur="2.64">into</text>
  <text start="1605.53" dur="5.54">I mentioned the pharmaceutical complex</text>
  <text start="1607.39" dur="8.07">media complex the intelligence industry</text>
  <text start="1611.07" dur="5.86">especially the CIA the first director of</text>

  <text start="1616.93" dur="4.92">instrumental in Operation Paperclip</text>

  <text start="1621.85" dur="3.12">defense industry aerospace industry many</text>
  <text start="1623.68" dur="3.24">of these Nazi scientists came over and</text>

  <text start="1626.92" dur="4.95">technologies with them into American</text>
  <text start="1629.95" dur="4.29">corporations and really started building</text>
  <text start="1631.87" dur="5.37">it out so when you&amp;#39;re thinking in terms</text>
  <text start="1634.24" dur="6.9">of Operation Paperclip and the</text>
  <text start="1637.24" dur="7.02">pharmaceutical industry well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1641.14" dur="5.13">remember this deep state you know Nazis</text>
  <text start="1644.26" dur="5.43">just being a faction of the deep state</text>
  <text start="1646.27" dur="7.2">of these cult secret societies you know</text>
  <text start="1649.69" dur="9.86">the top of the pyramid they&amp;#39;re their</text>
  <text start="1653.47" dur="9.84">modus operandi is eugenics eugenics the</text>
  <text start="1659.55" dur="5.59">ethnic cleansing of people&amp;#39;s and when I</text>
  <text start="1663.31" dur="4.37">talk F Nick cleansing I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="1665.14" dur="5.4">about you know black or white or Jews</text>
  <text start="1667.68" dur="5.95">you know the the deep state the top of</text>
  <text start="1670.54" dur="5.24">the pyramid it&amp;#39;s all about bloodlines to</text>
  <text start="1673.63" dur="3.93">them so if you&amp;#39;re not in their bloodline</text>
  <text start="1675.78" dur="4.03">they don&amp;#39;t want you in the picture</text>
  <text start="1677.56" dur="4.47">essentially Georgia Guidestones they</text>
  <text start="1679.81" dur="4.53">want a manageable earth population of</text>
  <text start="1682.03" dur="5.22">what a few hundred million people so</text>
  <text start="1684.34" dur="5.52">this is that population control this is</text>
  <text start="1687.25" dur="4.92">eugenics this is the deep states modus</text>
  <text start="1689.86" dur="6.12">operandi so let&amp;#39;s look in terms of</text>
  <text start="1692.17" dur="5.81">vaccines was that from the top was there</text>
  <text start="1695.98" dur="6.39">ever an intention for these to help us</text>
  <text start="1697.98" dur="7.45">now just like Monsanto&amp;#39;s GMOs I mean</text>
  <text start="1702.37" dur="8.46">geez Monsanto and Bayer same thing now</text>
  <text start="1705.43" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a an old son</text>
  <text start="1710.83" dur="3.66">returning home right</text>
  <text start="1712.18" dur="8.01">Monsanto going back to Bayer going back</text>
  <text start="1714.49" dur="7.68">to its Nazi roots there and fluoride as</text>
  <text start="1720.19" dur="5.58">well you know fluoride is often said to</text>
  <text start="1722.17" dur="5.49">be used in Nazi experiments back in</text>
  <text start="1725.77" dur="5.37">World War two it&amp;#39;s being utilized in our</text>
  <text start="1727.66" dur="5.25">municipal water now so no vaccines when</text>
  <text start="1731.14" dur="3.57">I think of them ever saving lives ever</text>
  <text start="1732.91" dur="6.36">helping humanity I don&amp;#39;t think of them</text>
  <text start="1734.71" dur="8.28">doing that now does that mean I</text>
  <text start="1739.27" dur="5.19">you know and this is also I&amp;#39;ll go kind</text>
  <text start="1742.99" dur="2.55">of tie in cueing back scenes here</text>
  <text start="1744.46" dur="3.24">because there was that queue post one</text>
  <text start="1745.54" dur="3.99">time that said there was detailing</text>
  <text start="1747.7" dur="3.72">pharmaceutical corruption and it was</text>
  <text start="1749.53" dur="4.67">discussing vaccines it said vaccines but</text>
  <text start="1751.42" dur="5.46">it said not all okay not all vaccines</text>
  <text start="1754.2" dur="7.99">essentially our bad is what it looked</text>
  <text start="1756.88" dur="9.33">like he was inferring now this II this</text>
  <text start="1762.19" dur="8.6">really gets into semantics and this gets</text>
  <text start="1766.21" dur="12.57">into okay what do we define a vaccine as</text>
  <text start="1770.79" dur="9.46">okay so if say I got bit by a snake or a</text>
  <text start="1778.78" dur="4.5">spider or something and I needed</text>
  <text start="1780.25" dur="6.41">anti-venom and the anti-venom was an</text>
  <text start="1783.28" dur="7.95">injection I would take it hell yeah</text>
  <text start="1786.66" dur="6.79">right I mean I I sure hope that that in</text>
  <text start="1791.23" dur="5.01">that anti venom isn&amp;#39;t preserved in</text>
  <text start="1793.45" dur="5.13">aluminum hydroxide or thimerosal right</text>
  <text start="1796.24" dur="5.22">mercury but I would take the anti-venom</text>
  <text start="1798.58" dur="7.89">that&amp;#39;s not technically a vaccine you see</text>
  <text start="1801.46" dur="7.56">that&amp;#39;s not in immunization by technical</text>
  <text start="1806.47" dur="5.73">definition it&amp;#39;s an injection yes but</text>
  <text start="1809.02" dur="6.81">you&amp;#39;re not utilizing that in the way</text>
  <text start="1812.2" dur="5.4">that they say vaccines are for you see</text>

  <text start="1842.32" dur="5.49">protected ironically this is sort of the</text>
  <text start="1845.14" dur="3.63">same idea of homeopathy but the</text>
  <text start="1847.81" dur="3.27">mainstream media that you know</text>
  <text start="1848.77" dur="7.26">mainstream medicine calls homeopathy</text>
  <text start="1851.08" dur="6.12">pseudoscience quackery but anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1856.03" dur="4.77">what they say vaccines are supposed to</text>
  <text start="1857.2" dur="5.55">do now the thing is that modern medicine</text>
  <text start="1860.8" dur="3.72">mainstream medicine they&amp;#39;re so arrogant</text>
  <text start="1862.75" dur="3.18">they think Nainoa lot more about the</text>

  <text start="1865.93" dur="3.03">and there&amp;#39;s still a lot of stuff they</text>
  <text start="1867.58" dur="4.26">actually don&amp;#39;t know about the immune</text>

  <text start="1893.53" dur="7.7">fall on its head and not just that but</text>
  <text start="1898.63" dur="5.58">with the way our immune system works</text>
  <text start="1901.23" dur="5.62">you&amp;#39;re not gonna inject immunity into</text>
  <text start="1904.21" dur="5.01">you you know through the research I</text>
  <text start="1906.85" dur="5.22">found this is a lot of a lot of a lot of</text>
  <text start="1909.22" dur="4.92">hours a months a lot of years spent</text>
  <text start="1912.07" dur="4.16">looking into this you cannot inject</text>
  <text start="1914.14" dur="7.13">immunity into you because your natural</text>
  <text start="1916.23" dur="7.75">immune pathways work through your</text>
  <text start="1921.27" dur="4.81">inflammatory system you know by way of</text>
  <text start="1923.98" dur="5.13">your mucosal membranes down into your</text>
  <text start="1926.08" dur="5.73">gut your gut creates the most immune</text>
  <text start="1929.11" dur="4.8">cells of your body okay so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1931.81" dur="4.56">natural way that you are supposed to get</text>
  <text start="1933.91" dur="4.64">sick there&amp;#39;s a natural inflammation</text>
  <text start="1936.37" dur="5.28">response that occurs whenever you</text>

  <text start="1948.82" dur="5.01">stimulating the wrong immune response</text>
  <text start="1951.01" dur="4.5">and all they look for in these studies</text>
  <text start="1953.83" dur="3.6">when they approve a vaccine is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1955.51" dur="3.93">looking for a single antibody they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1957.43" dur="4.68">looking for that one antibody inject</text>
  <text start="1959.44" dur="5.07">find that antibody checked approved this</text>
  <text start="1962.11" dur="4.31">is not how real immunity works you see</text>
  <text start="1964.51" dur="4.07">they&amp;#39;re chipping the freaking</text>
  <text start="1966.42" dur="5.5">information just to get them approved</text>
  <text start="1968.58" dur="5.32">natural immunity is a long process you</text>
  <text start="1971.92" dur="3.51">see and this is why autoimmune rates are</text>
  <text start="1973.9" dur="3.12">freakin skyrocketing because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1975.43" dur="2.76">vaccinating we&amp;#39;re injecting that</text>

  <text start="1982.72" dur="3.81">your natural inflammation processes</text>
  <text start="1985.09" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;re injecting it right into you so</text>
  <text start="1986.53" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s stimulating a hypersensitive</text>
  <text start="1988" dur="3.9">response yeah they get that one antibody</text>
  <text start="1990.85" dur="2.82">they were looking for but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1991.9" dur="3.45">whole host of other stuff they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1993.67" dur="4.59">even look for in these studies that</text>
  <text start="1995.35" dur="4.35">occurs okay then you get immune reaction</text>
  <text start="1998.26" dur="5.88">you get encephalitis why does your brain</text>
  <text start="1999.7" dur="6.18">swell side-effect of basically every</text>

  <text start="2011.1" dur="6.51">but you know autoimmunity peanut</text>
  <text start="2014.91" dur="5.43">allergies a lot of these vaccines are</text>
  <text start="2017.61" dur="4.89">preserved in freakin peanut oil doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2020.34" dur="3.18">take a rocket scientist to put the dots</text>
  <text start="2022.5" dur="3.15">together with that one</text>
  <text start="2023.52" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re injecting peanut oil right into</text>
  <text start="2025.65" dur="5.22">your blood remember right into your</text>
  <text start="2028.23" dur="6.32">blood well maybe that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s causing</text>
  <text start="2030.87" dur="3.68">all these peanut allergies these days oh</text>
  <text start="2035.78" dur="5.56">pretty easy to connect the dots with</text>
  <text start="2039.9" dur="4.32">those ones so</text>
  <text start="2041.34" dur="5.55">oh also egg egg proteins a lot of</text>
  <text start="2044.22" dur="6.57">vaccines they use egg proteins to</text>
  <text start="2046.89" dur="6.75">culture the viral DNA in eject it in</text>
  <text start="2050.79" dur="7.83">your blood again autoimmunity egg</text>
  <text start="2053.64" dur="6.57">allergies peanut allergies etc because</text>
  <text start="2058.62" dur="2.79">with eggs peanuts things like that</text>
  <text start="2060.21" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;re supposed to eat them your</text>

  <text start="2071.37" dur="7.11">also you know I could probably make this</text>
  <text start="2074.7" dur="6.57">whole video podcast about just the</text>
  <text start="2078.48" dur="5.81">ass-backwards miss of health and all the</text>
  <text start="2081.27" dur="6.57">propaganda they tell us there but the</text>
  <text start="2084.29" dur="6.09">reason these outbreaks occur is not a</text>
  <text start="2087.84" dur="5.4">lack of vaccines it&amp;#39;s a fact that we are</text>
  <text start="2090.38" dur="4.6">overly toxic as a society but we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="2093.24" dur="6.57">completely disconnected from nature by</text>
  <text start="2094.98" dur="7.65">way of the microbiome - bacteria is a</text>
  <text start="2099.81" dur="5.49">wonderful thing you know it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="2102.63" dur="5.34">thing we need bacteria 90% of the cells</text>

  <text start="2114.66" dur="6.75">bacteria and your health is predicated</text>
  <text start="2117.71" dur="7.11">solely on the balance between good flora</text>
  <text start="2121.41" dur="7.38">and bad flora probiotics and bad biotics</text>
  <text start="2124.82" dur="6.04">in that meatsuit of yours so the fact</text>
  <text start="2128.79" dur="4.23">that we are overly sanitizing every</text>
  <text start="2130.86" dur="4.56">everything these days with Clorox and</text>
  <text start="2133.02" dur="5.01">hardcore bleach poisons and stuff like</text>
  <text start="2135.42" dur="4.86">we live our environment is so clean that</text>
  <text start="2138.03" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s not building our immune systems</text>
  <text start="2140.28" dur="3.93">they should be you see and of course</text>
  <text start="2142.71" dur="5.7">then we have toxins in our bodies</text>
  <text start="2144.21" dur="6.45">malnutrition terrible diets and like I</text>
  <text start="2148.41" dur="5.07">said the petri dish is almost too clean</text>
  <text start="2150.66" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re too clean so there&amp;#39;s no bacteria</text>
  <text start="2153.48" dur="3.03">so that then our immune systems just get</text>
  <text start="2154.98" dur="4.29">no practice right</text>
  <text start="2156.51" dur="4.95">I dropped food on the ground I&amp;#39;ll eat it</text>
  <text start="2159.27" dur="3.96">oh yeah it&amp;#39;s practice for my immune</text>

  <text start="2869.28" dur="6.27">you know DMT is that endogenous chemical</text>
  <text start="2873.81" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s made in each of our pineal glands</text>
  <text start="2875.55" dur="5.069">and it&amp;#39;s made naturally so my view on</text>
  <text start="2878.19" dur="5.79">that really quickly is that I feel that</text>
  <text start="2880.619" dur="5.611">the goal my goal personally is to get as</text>

  <text start="2918.51" dur="5.04">called melanin melanin is a precursor to</text>
  <text start="2920.94" dur="5">melatonin which is a precursor to DMT so</text>
  <text start="2923.55" dur="4.86">you can take supplements roots herbs</text>
  <text start="2925.94" dur="6.52">natural things to help DMT production</text>
  <text start="2928.41" dur="6.84">right I just I don&amp;#39;t want to be somebody</text>

  <text start="3285.69" dur="5.34">what they can do see 60 is something you</text>
