  <text start="113.759" dur="4.951">lot of people on Twitter past few days</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="4.861">if you if you&amp;#39;re on Twitter you notice</text>

  <text start="125.52" dur="4.26">changing it YouTube&amp;#39;s changing it as</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="4.289">we&amp;#39;ve been hearing on December 10th</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="3.66">apparently there&amp;#39;s going to have a new</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="2.911">sort of policy</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="5.34">and apparently it says that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="5.25">going to be able to basically delete</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="3.54">channels that they don&amp;#39;t deem</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="6.54">commercially viable or whatever that</text>
  <text start="142.32" dur="5.97">means so excuse to censor maybe is this</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="5.73">the first we see and a new wave that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="6.39">coming maybe but uh where do we have to</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="4.35">go that&amp;#39;s the alternative D live is one</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="4.44">of them I did see Owen Benjamin on D</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="7.26">live today he was a live streaming there</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="7.5">and but he note on that on his D live</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="3.99">live stream today he had I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="166.62" dur="5.19">you can see this on the screen is pretty</text>
  <text start="167.85" dur="7.98">small but he had over six thousand live</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="6.48">viewers on his D live stream six</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="3.63">thousand that&amp;#39;s a lot that&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="3.03">a lot more than I have on this right now</text>
  <text start="179.46" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s for sure and a lot more than I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="4.65">ever had on YouTube period I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="5.43">more than he&amp;#39;s had on YouTube period so</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="6.44">you know we&amp;#39;ve always thought does</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="7.549">YouTube suppress the view counts do they</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="7.09">suppress the live stream viewer counts</text>
  <text start="196.489" dur="4.75">maybe but now we have a piece of</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="3.18">evidence that shows that they probably</text>
  <text start="201.239" dur="3.72">are definitely doing that so anyway I</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="3.57">created a D live account this morning I</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="4.861">may or may not start live streaming</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="5.52">there I&amp;#39;ll check it out see how easy it</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="3.36">is to do so you can go follow me there</text>
  <text start="211.77" dur="4.53">if you have an account I also have a</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="6.75">account on bitch shoot too so those will</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="6.75">be my two alternative video platforms in</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="6.87">case they suspend me on YouTube for the</text>
  <text start="223.05" dur="4.98">third time ah third time yes they</text>
  <text start="226.8" dur="4.439">suspended my account at the beginning</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="5.37">and in the middle of 2018 so twice twice</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="4.141">last year they can my account luckily I</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="5.339">got it back twice but what happened a</text>
  <text start="235.38" dur="6.3">third time I don&amp;#39;t know probably yep</text>
  <text start="238.739" dur="5.581">probably with the videos I have planned</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="5.46">coming up so check out D live and check</text>

  <text start="248.489" dur="4.261">channel in virtual shield a VPN virtual</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="3.69">private network I&amp;#39;ll tell you two</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="4.019">reasons I use a VPN two things I use it</text>
  <text start="254.64" dur="4.83">for number one I use it to search</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="4.051">information on search engines because</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re the VPN you can change your IP</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="3.36">address make it look like you&amp;#39;re logging</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="3.39">into the website from somewhere else so</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="2.85">I&amp;#39;ll change my IP address and then I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="2.67">search things into Google</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="2.97">or deduct up go and sometimes you can</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="2.91">get different results so it&amp;#39;s good if</text>
  <text start="270" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re doing any research or digging</text>
  <text start="271.29" dur="3.69">because you can you know get the</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="4.62">algorithms to feed you different things</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="6.3">and then also a VPN is helpful if you</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="5.52">travel huh you can get a airline tickets</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="2.7">actually by changing your IP address you</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="3.09">know making it look like you&amp;#39;re logging</text>
  <text start="283.98" dur="3.69">in from somewhere else then it games the</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="2.61">algorithm of the website they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="287.67" dur="2.7">where you&amp;#39;re logging in from it might</text>
  <text start="288.81" dur="3.3">actually drop the prices of your plane</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="4.05">tickets you know if you&amp;#39;re buying plane</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="3.9">tickets website things from somebody</text>
  <text start="294.42" dur="3.69">somewhere else it might drop the prices</text>
  <text start="296.01" dur="4.32">for you so anyway VPN helpful for a lot</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="3.54">of different things helpful to secure</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="2.91">your data when you&amp;#39;re sending it over</text>

  <text start="1000.84" dur="5.36">Professor John Turley Jonathan Turley</text>
  <text start="1004.29" dur="4.98">and he was doing a much better job</text>
  <text start="1006.2" dur="4.6">during his testimony he was saying</text>
  <text start="1009.27" dur="6.12">impeachment has to be based on proofs</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="7.86">not presumptions not hearsay not things</text>
  <text start="1015.39" dur="4.92">made up quite frankly and if you</text>

  <text start="1026.37" dur="3.84">bring an old cue drop into the picture</text>
  <text start="1027.9" dur="4.35">so you remember in March of last year if</text>
  <text start="1030.21" dur="4.68">you were following cue then that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="1032.25" dur="5.25">cue linked that Breitbart article that</text>
  <text start="1034.89" dur="4.71">first mentioned John Huber and the fact</text>
  <text start="1037.5" dur="5.43">that Jeff Sessions appointed John Huber</text>
  <text start="1039.6" dur="4.8">to be working with the 470 investigators</text>
  <text start="1042.93" dur="5.88">on you know all sorts of different</text>
  <text start="1044.4" dur="6.24">things so that Breitbart article was</text>
  <text start="1048.81" dur="3.78">what first mentioned Huber I think when</text>
  <text start="1050.64" dur="3.72">we first heard of him and then started</text>
  <text start="1052.59" dur="5.49">connecting the dots with what Huber was</text>
  <text start="1054.36" dur="7.08">doing John Turley here he was the author</text>
  <text start="1058.08" dur="6.08">of that article for Breitbart so John</text>
  <text start="1061.44" dur="7.17">Turley you know he I think he&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="1064.16" dur="5.56">pretty big just role to play and all of</text>
  <text start="1068.61" dur="4.08">this quite obviously there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1069.72" dur="6.48">there his name he&amp;#39;s yet again and all of</text>
  <text start="1072.69" dur="5.16">this so nevertheless let&amp;#39;s move on now</text>
  <text start="1076.2" dur="4.02">into the Senate so we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1077.85" dur="6.27">all these impeachment hearings going on</text>
  <text start="1080.22" dur="5.309">in the house but of course the Senate</text>
  <text start="1084.12" dur="3.059">was the target the Senate was most</text>
  <text start="1085.529" dur="4.89">important and that&amp;#39;s because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1087.179" dur="5.191">where the power and the control is so no</text>
  <text start="1090.419" dur="4.5">impeachment inquiry is gonna survive</text>
  <text start="1092.37" dur="4.5">without Senate approval when Pietschmann</text>
  <text start="1094.919" dur="5.49">is gonna keep going unless that happens</text>
  <text start="1096.87" dur="6.57">so Lindsey Graham here saying be wary of</text>
