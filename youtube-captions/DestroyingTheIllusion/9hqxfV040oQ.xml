  <text start="30.81" dur="3.179">question I have an 8 month old child and</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re being pressured hard to get her</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="4.741">vaccinated by her pediatrician so</text>
  <text start="37.17" dur="3.45">essentially I have no knowledge of</text>
  <text start="38.73" dur="5.18">vaccinations other than there are many</text>
  <text start="40.62" dur="5.64">cases of autism brain damage and death</text>
  <text start="43.91" dur="4.69">resulting from them so my question is</text>
  <text start="46.26" dur="3.93">what is the safe method here are there</text>
  <text start="48.6" dur="4.5">some that are good or should I keep her</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="4.29">unvaccinated and then he says it would</text>
  <text start="53.1" dur="3">mean a lot for some links or personal</text>
  <text start="54.48" dur="3.239">info thanks I&amp;#39;m just gonna go ahead and</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="3.24">make a video on this question man</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="4.921">because it&amp;#39;s a great one to throw out</text>
  <text start="59.34" dur="5.789">there and I still see people quite often</text>
  <text start="62.64" dur="4.019">getting caught up by vaccine propaganda</text>
  <text start="65.129" dur="4.291">by the BS that the medical establishment</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="5.371">the scientific establishment tries to</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="5.58">feed us and my answer to this question</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="4.47">my friend I&amp;#39;ll just simply offer you my</text>
  <text start="75" dur="6.27">own personal experience because I do</text>
  <text start="76.5" dur="8.49">have a little one and I did not get him</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="7.62">vaccinated at all I am against at least</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="5.94">all of the vaccines that Big Pharma the</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="4.29">pharmaceutical industrial complex tries</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="5.549">to give us throughout our youth I think</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="5.79">69 vaccines now in the first 18 years of</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="5.611">life through a myriad of diseases they</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="5.88">claim to try and prevent from polio to</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="4.889">measles to mumps to chicken pox to you</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="5.159">know all these different shots with who</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="6.18">knows what in there and the reason that</text>
  <text start="110.009" dur="5.701">I did not vaccinate and I&amp;#39;m telling you</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="4.111">that me personally if I was you you know</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="3.299">I can&amp;#39;t tell you what to do I can only</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="4.65">tell you what I would do in your</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="5.371">situation I would not get any of them</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="5.19">because when you look at it right the</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="5.46">reason I formulate this very hard line</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="5.93">belief on it is that if you look at</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="5.9">history real his</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="4.62">is that you&amp;#39;ll find all of these</text>
  <text start="135.74" dur="3.84">diseases pretty much all of them that</text>
  <text start="137.66" dur="4.2">they claim they&amp;#39;re preventing by</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="5.07">vaccinating us when the vaccines were</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="4.89">introduced in the 1950s 60s and 70s</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="2.88">these diseases were already on the</text>
  <text start="146.75" dur="3.51">decline</text>
  <text start="147.53" dur="5.31">they already declined by like 95 to 98</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="3.99">percent before these vaccines were in</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="3.81">even introduced and then the vaccines</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="4.62">were introduced and of course the same</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="4.5">people that own the medical systems can</text>
  <text start="158.87" dur="4.11">write the textbooks so they&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="4.08">since they introduced the vaccines that</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="4.17">oh yeah the vaccines is what got rid of</text>
  <text start="165.23" dur="3.69">these diseases you saw the decline right</text>
  <text start="167.15" dur="4.8">yeah as the vaccines Lyster shots</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="6.59">that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not in fact it was</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="6.21">better nutrition better sanitation a</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="4.27">highway system and refrigeration systems</text>
  <text start="178.16" dur="5.73">better technologies where we were able</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="8.07">to eat fresher foods more balanced diets</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="5.61">like I said sanitation we were able to</text>
  <text start="187.85" dur="3.48">just be healthier beings have a</text>
  <text start="189.5" dur="4.71">healthier environment right this is what</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="5.34">truly causes immunity and led the</text>
  <text start="194.21" dur="3.95">decline of vaccines okay so don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="196.67" dur="3.63">caught up in the fear that vaccines</text>
  <text start="198.16" dur="3.88">prevent diseases and if you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="200.3" dur="3.78">vaccines you&amp;#39;re gonna get these diseases</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="4.14">because you&amp;#39;re really not okay and that</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="4.26">sort of leads me into the next segue</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="4.77">that I mentioned there is that better</text>
  <text start="208.34" dur="6.36">nutrition a cleaner environment actual</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="6.12">health efforts actions is the true way</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="4.23">to establish immunity not vaccines what</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="4.56">vaccines do is establish more of an</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="5.85">autoimmunity it&amp;#39;s not the proper immune</text>
  <text start="221.63" dur="5.82">response to combat against diseases</text>
  <text start="224.78" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re shooting injecting these things</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="4.17">directly into your blood you see not</text>
  <text start="229.64" dur="3.33">going through your mucosal membranes a</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="3.39">probiotic so if your gut you know the</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="3.45">natural immunity systems you&amp;#39;re shooting</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="3.84">this stuff in your blood that&amp;#39;s causing</text>
  <text start="236.42" dur="5.63">an acute chronic inflammatory response</text>
  <text start="238.85" dur="6.36">and that&amp;#39;s why people are getting</text>
  <text start="242.05" dur="6.1">allergies asthma fibro chronic fatigue</text>
  <text start="245.21" dur="6.69">all these autoimmune you know basically</text>
  <text start="248.15" dur="6.059">screwed-up body syndromes vaccines are a</text>
  <text start="251.9" dur="4.05">major cause of that can completely ruin</text>
  <text start="254.209" dur="4.081">our immune system and our immune system</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="5.159">is directly linked to our nervous system</text>
  <text start="258.29" dur="5.82">so yes like you mentioned there&amp;#39;s brain</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="4.591">damage there&amp;#39;s all the symptoms and</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="1.97">diseases associated with brain damage</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="5.089">you know</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="8.089">ADHD autism Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Parkinson&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.789" dur="6.511">those ones later in life and neuropathy</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="5.31">even yes being paralyzed I&amp;#39;ve met people</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="6.089">before that have been paralyzed by</text>
  <text start="279.479" dur="5.891">vaccines so all in all I could keep</text>
  <text start="283.389" dur="5.821">ranting but I&amp;#39;ll just keep this really</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="6.57">short here is that no I would not get</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="5.97">your little one vaccinated and what I</text>
  <text start="291.94" dur="4.92">would do is look into natural means to</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="4.53">keep her healthy of course when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="6">washing her use chemical free washes I</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="6.449">just used castile soap very basic no</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="5.85">crap in it if you&amp;#39;re brushing their</text>

  <text start="328.81" dur="3.81">just powdered greens in the applesauce</text>
  <text start="330.639" dur="3.601">spirulina and chlorella two of the main</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="5.43">ones that I added in there and that was</text>
