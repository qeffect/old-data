  <text start="0.05" dur="6.16">ayoh and we&amp;#39;re live what&amp;#39;s up guys so I</text>
  <text start="4.56" dur="3.69">was getting some messages from some of</text>
  <text start="6.21" dur="5.309">you asking where I&amp;#39;ve been at and if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="8.25" dur="4.92">okay and I&amp;#39;m okay I&amp;#39;m here actually I</text>
  <text start="11.519" dur="5.731">just had to take a few days off this</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="6.869">week just because for me you know so I</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="5.58">went out into the nature into the</text>
  <text start="20.039" dur="5.58">mountains and had a few days off</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="4.32">actually went to a Rob elk farm - which</text>
  <text start="25.619" dur="4.92">is pretty cool you guys know I&amp;#39;m a fan</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="6.03">of organic practices and natural</text>
  <text start="30.539" dur="5.551">agriculture but anyway back to business</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="4.59">here back to headquarters and I want to</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="5.1">have this little chap here just about</text>
  <text start="37.77" dur="5.28">all the nonsense that&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="41.19" dur="6.33">political scene you know when it comes</text>
  <text start="43.05" dur="6.239">to politics it&amp;#39;s not my favorite area of</text>
  <text start="47.52" dur="5.25">research you know it&amp;#39;s not my most</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="6.691">passionate subject or anything but in my</text>
  <text start="52.77" dur="6.57">view it&amp;#39;s important to at least stay up</text>
  <text start="55.98" dur="5.07">to speed with what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="59.34" dur="4.83">political scene I know it can get very</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="4.95">divisive and you know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="4.35">are just hugging on two identities when</text>
  <text start="66" dur="4.47">it comes to politics but it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="3.51">to stay up to speed with it number one</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="4.71">for me so I can relay that information</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="5.729">to you guys but number two you know of</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="4.65">course everything&amp;#39;s connected every area</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="3.72">of research every topic of study it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="5.25">all connected in some way shape or form</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="5.941">so if you&amp;#39;re lacking in an understanding</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="5.16">of at least the basics of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="4.8">on politically then you could be more</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="4.65">easily manipulated when it comes to</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="5.13">another area of research so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="4.86">all it&amp;#39;s good to have a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="4.35">sense of understanding with everything</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="3.299">then you can have your topics where</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="2.82">you&amp;#39;re more interested in a more</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="3.951">passionate about that you can deep dive</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="5.01">into but anyway we&amp;#39;ll get into talking</text>
  <text start="107" dur="6.369">what&amp;#39;s going on with this whole</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="6.839">Ukrainian stuff Biden Schiff you know</text>

  <text start="119.369" dur="2.581">their ass as much as they can right now</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="2.82">because there&amp;#39;s so much shit just</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="3.18">blowing up in their face and not just</text>
  <text start="123.719" dur="4.71">that but the mainstream media is doing</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="6.78">all they can to get ahead of different</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="5.101">stories and to frame narratives in</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="1.87">different ways you know damage control</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="2.44">there</text>
  <text start="133.78" dur="3.6">as much damage control as they can right</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="3.33">now as well because of the whole you</text>

  <text start="314.479" dur="4.97">if we&amp;#39;re going to go by the technical</text>
  <text start="315.949" dur="3.5">definition of mainstream which</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="3.869">first getting listened to the most</text>
  <text start="322.819" dur="2.88">whoever&amp;#39;s getting clicked on the most on</text>

  <text start="346.19" dur="4.08">and we have to handle that with care we</text>
  <text start="348.319" dur="5.271">have to handle that with care because</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="5.66">having that sort of power to influence</text>
  <text start="353.59" dur="5.199">means that you have quite a</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="5.139">responsibility on your shoulders you</text>
  <text start="358.789" dur="3.78">need to influence in the proper way you</text>
  <text start="361.069" dur="5.25">know we don&amp;#39;t want to influence them</text>
  <text start="362.569" dur="6">with false information misinformation so</text>
  <text start="366.319" dur="3.72">we need to be up to our journalistic</text>
  <text start="368.569" dur="3.361">standards of verifying the information</text>
  <text start="370.039" dur="4.741">that we have at hand so we can report</text>
  <text start="371.93" dur="5.34">the truth and we also want to report it</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="4.71">with compassion we don&amp;#39;t want to do any</text>
  <text start="377.27" dur="4.26">more of this divisive bullshit that the</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="4.829">mainstream media has done enough up so</text>
  <text start="381.53" dur="3.93">we got to stop letting our egos get into</text>
  <text start="384.319" dur="3.03">the way letting our emotional</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="4.199">attachments key getting into the way and</text>
  <text start="387.349" dur="4.711">attaching onto the labels and dividing</text>
  <text start="389.659" dur="5.451">just because of the labels and the the</text>
  <text start="392.06" dur="5.849">groupthink sort of mentality so anyway</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="5.169">it&amp;#39;s great it&amp;#39;s great that people are</text>
  <text start="397.909" dur="5.07">doing this sort of work and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.279" dur="4.651">getting recognition for that so great</text>

  <text start="425.27" dur="7.29">stuff like unlike an Tifa toilet paper</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="5.009">at least serves a helpful benefit to</text>

  <text start="696.44" dur="5.88">around these talk shows Joe Biden Schiff</text>
  <text start="699.65" dur="4.65">is trying to spin the narratives his way</text>
  <text start="702.32" dur="6.42">Hillary Clinton I saw John Brennan -</text>
  <text start="704.3" dur="7.44">John Brennan on on a morning news</text>
  <text start="708.74" dur="4.71">program I believe and he was saying this</text>
  <text start="711.74" dur="4.53">was interesting he actually said he was</text>
  <text start="713.45" dur="5.1">about to be interviewed by John Durham</text>
  <text start="716.27" dur="4.23">as a part of what he called the non</text>
  <text start="718.55" dur="3.72">investigation right it&amp;#39;s a non</text>
  <text start="720.5" dur="2.54">investigation he was saying these aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="722.27" dur="3.47">the droids are look</text>
  <text start="723.04" dur="5.45">for this is not the illegal treasonous</text>
  <text start="725.74" dur="5.75">FISA abuses you&amp;#39;re looking for no no</text>
  <text start="728.49" dur="5.589">your CIA mind tricks aren&amp;#39;t gonna work</text>
  <text start="731.49" dur="3.73">so he was on this morning talk show and</text>
  <text start="734.079" dur="2.791">he said he was about to be interviewed</text>
  <text start="735.22" dur="5.609">by John Durham so this is interesting</text>
  <text start="736.87" dur="5.73">because well John Brennan&amp;#39;s admitting</text>
  <text start="740.829" dur="3.471">he&amp;#39;s about to be interviewed and if John</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="4.53">Brennan is about to be interviewed well</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="5.14">he was the ex-director of the CIA if</text>
  <text start="747.13" dur="7.41">anything he was the one of the top dogs</text>
  <text start="749.44" dur="6.69">the person that probably commissioned</text>
  <text start="754.54" dur="2.849">many of these illegal fights of abuses</text>
  <text start="756.13" dur="3.12">to happen so if he&amp;#39;s about to get</text>
  <text start="757.389" dur="3.361">interviewed well it probably means</text>
  <text start="759.25" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re near the end of the line with</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="4.5">their investigation who they want to</text>
  <text start="762.61" dur="3.839">interview it&amp;#39;s my understanding that</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="3.06">when it comes to these sort of</text>
  <text start="766.449" dur="4.44">high-profile investigations they start</text>
  <text start="768.31" dur="5.66">with the small small fish first and work</text>
  <text start="770.889" dur="5.851">up to the big fish so if John Brennan if</text>
  <text start="773.97" dur="4.299">the biggest fish you know we could say</text>
  <text start="776.74" dur="4.789">is about to be interviewed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="778.269" dur="6.63">interesting might mean we&amp;#39;re nearing</text>
  <text start="781.529" dur="4.721">nearing a lot of cedi classifications or</text>
  <text start="784.899" dur="2.971">the public learning about a lot more</text>
  <text start="786.25" dur="5.279">when it comes to these fires have abuses</text>
  <text start="787.87" dur="5.43">and they are covering for it and not</text>
  <text start="791.529" dur="3.93">just these puppets being rolled around</text>

  <text start="851.35" dur="3.72">ahead of this FISA revelations and</text>
  <text start="853.779" dur="4.531">whatnot is because of</text>
  <text start="855.07" dur="5.19">any general bars in Italy right now or</text>
  <text start="858.31" dur="4.41">he was in Italy at least earlier in the</text>

  <text start="864.46" dur="4.59">people overseas right now as well and</text>
  <text start="866.68" dur="6.36">how interesting that they&amp;#39;re over in</text>
  <text start="869.05" dur="6.66">Italy when as we&amp;#39;ve learned as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="873.04" dur="4.32">been learning about FISA is that a lot</text>
  <text start="875.71" dur="3.36">of foreign governments intelligence</text>
  <text start="877.36" dur="4.05">agencies were also connected</text>
  <text start="879.07" dur="4.28">particularly the five eyes countries so</text>
  <text start="881.41" dur="5.4">Australia UK Italy</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="4.51">what is Attorney General bar trying to</text>
  <text start="886.81" dur="3.36">learn over there</text>
  <text start="887.86" dur="5.19">right again we might be nearing the very</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="4.02">end of these FISA investigations because</text>
  <text start="893.05" dur="2.85">John Brennan is being interviewed not</text>
  <text start="894.19" dur="4.14">just that Attorney General bars likely</text>
  <text start="895.9" dur="4.86">over in Italy right now personally</text>
  <text start="898.33" dur="6.32">trying to figure out what was going on</text>
  <text start="900.76" dur="6.9">with the the FISA abuses and</text>
  <text start="904.65" dur="8.41">co-inky-dink early enough coincidentally</text>
  <text start="907.66" dur="7.83">enough how peculiar is it that pretty</text>
  <text start="913.06" dur="4.68">much the same days that attorney general</text>
  <text start="915.49" dur="4.92">bar and Mike Bob pill Mike Pompeo were</text>
  <text start="917.74" dur="6.6">over there in Rome that we had Vatican</text>
  <text start="920.41" dur="7.53">police raid some financial offices at</text>
  <text start="924.34" dur="7.17">the Vatican ah interesting interesting</text>
  <text start="927.94" dur="6.77">right there no coincidences right a lot</text>
  <text start="931.51" dur="5.97">of changes are going on in the corrupt</text>
  <text start="934.71" dur="5.11">agencies the corrupt groups the corrupt</text>
  <text start="937.48" dur="5.88">organizations around the world you know</text>
  <text start="939.82" dur="7.47">a lot of a lot of rank-and-file a lot of</text>
  <text start="943.36" dur="4.8">we can say lower people on the totem</text>
  <text start="947.29" dur="2.73">pole when it comes to these</text>
  <text start="948.16" dur="3.39">organizations we can use the FBI for</text>
  <text start="950.02" dur="3.72">instance right a lot of rank-and-file</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="3.51">the FBI great people and they&amp;#39;re waking</text>
  <text start="953.74" dur="3.12">up to a lot of this corruption that was</text>
  <text start="955.06" dur="4.23">going on in their own agency just as</text>
  <text start="956.86" dur="4.02">much as all of us are so they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="959.29" dur="3.18">to do something about it a lot of people</text>
  <text start="960.88" dur="3.27">people are thinking that oh why would</text>
  <text start="962.47" dur="4.68">the Vatican police raid the Vatican that</text>
  <text start="964.15" dur="4.83">that sounds like something well in my</text>
  <text start="967.15" dur="4.37">eyes I&amp;#39;m thinking that there&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="968.98" dur="6.78">a lot of people that work at the Vatican</text>
  <text start="971.52" dur="5.56">that were in the dark as to a lot of the</text>
  <text start="975.76" dur="2.4">stuff that was really going on at the</text>
  <text start="977.08" dur="2.31">Vatican and they&amp;#39;re starting to learn</text>
  <text start="978.16" dur="3.18">about it and probably trying to do</text>
  <text start="979.39" dur="3.27">something about it I don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="981.34" dur="3.39">Vatican police would be rating</text>
  <text start="982.66" dur="3.99">themselves to try to bury evidence</text>
  <text start="984.73" dur="4.71">because why would that make it into the</text>
  <text start="986.65" dur="4.62">News period I don&amp;#39;t know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="989.44" dur="5.19">of different angles you could sort of</text>
  <text start="991.27" dur="5.01">view the whole Vatican financial office</text>
  <text start="994.63" dur="3.63">being raided by VAT a complete situation</text>
  <text start="996.28" dur="3.96">but I just find a coincidental that that</text>
  <text start="998.26" dur="5.85">happens in the exact same time attorney</text>
  <text start="1000.24" dur="5.79">general bar them over there so no we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1004.11" dur="5.04">see we&amp;#39;ll see what we learn in the</text>
  <text start="1006.03" dur="6.69">coming weeks about many of these things</text>
  <text start="1009.15" dur="5.4">about FISA potentially also we&amp;#39;re</text>
