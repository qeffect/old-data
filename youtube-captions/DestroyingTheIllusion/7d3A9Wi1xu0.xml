  <text start="6.5" dur="4.809">alright guys so let&amp;#39;s get into Gaia</text>
  <text start="9.12" dur="4.17">bringing out their new supposed secret</text>
  <text start="11.309" dur="4.921">space program insider a couple of days</text>
  <text start="13.29" dur="4.95">ago on September 25th so Gaia the</text>
  <text start="16.23" dur="4.92">self-proclaimed conscious Netflix on</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="4.68">their cosmic disclosure program brought</text>
  <text start="21.15" dur="4.11">forth a guy that goes by the name Jason</text>
  <text start="22.92" dur="5.58">rice he was interviewed by Jay Widener</text>
  <text start="25.26" dur="5.37">and in about an episode and a half Jason</text>
  <text start="28.5" dur="5.79">rice put out these claims that he had</text>
  <text start="30.63" dur="5.91">been in a part of grooming programs from</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="4.17">his youth for black projects that he had</text>
  <text start="36.54" dur="4.679">been taken to an underground base and</text>
  <text start="38.46" dur="5.07">tunneled and portals somewhere and they</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="4.381">even did a hypnotic regression of him on</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="4.11">camera to try to prove his legitimacy</text>
  <text start="45.6" dur="4.92">now what&amp;#39;s really interesting about this</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="5.399">is that cosmic disclosure that show was</text>
  <text start="50.52" dur="5.969">started a few years ago by Corey Goode</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="5.82">and David Wilcock now recently Corey and</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.651">David are out of Gaia so the questions</text>
  <text start="58.859" dur="4.77">on this yes they are no longer there so</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="4.44">being that Gaia still has the</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="6.871">intellectual property rights to that</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="6.78">cosmic disclosure show this is the first</text>
  <text start="70.5" dur="4.619">batch of new people that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="5.369">bringing out on it and let me tell you I</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="5.131">am NOT getting good vibes from this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="5.21">not resonating with me at all I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="6.38">go through a list as of why number one</text>
  <text start="82.939" dur="4.991">Jason Rice when I saw that name I</text>
  <text start="86.63" dur="4.36">googled it</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="5.7">DuckDuckGo tit pinged it group searched</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="5.37">it I didn&amp;#39;t find any hint of Jason rice</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="5.61">anywhere out there on the Internet</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="7.38">number two they claimed he was vetted</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="7.44">well how how is he vetted who did the</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="5.25">vetting the only vetting attempt that I</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="4.079">saw was the hypnotic regression done on</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="3.239">camera and frankly it looked really</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="4.081">awkward and it didn&amp;#39;t really prove</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="5.25">anything to me other than it might have</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="5.76">been trying a little hard number 3 body</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="5.521">language the body language was off he</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="5.22">was looking one direction the whole time</text>
  <text start="123" dur="4.619">it seemed as if he had some preconceived</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="4.169">lines he was trying to drum up in his</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="4.741">head it was not consistent of somebody</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="2.991">that was trying to recall memory you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="2.93">know there&amp;#39;s some people</text>
  <text start="132.98" dur="3.33">to recall memory or think of things in</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="2.61">their head sometimes we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="136.31" dur="4.53">around often those stumbling over their</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="5.1">words especially if it&amp;#39;s an insider at</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="3.39">somebody who has been in projects who</text>
  <text start="143" dur="3">has been traumatized</text>
  <text start="144.23" dur="3.72">this guy was trying to claim that he had</text>
  <text start="146" dur="3.66">been traumatized and some of the</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="3.75">programs in his youth if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="5.67">traumatized it&amp;#39;s very difficult for them</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="5.22">to be cool calm and collect and then</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="3.45">let&amp;#39;s get into his testimony so there</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="5.099">were definite inconsistencies that I</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="7.91">found in his testimony number one there</text>
  <text start="162.019" dur="7.261">was nothing new or profound or</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="4.629">revelatory in the claims he was bringing</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="3.9">forward in fact it felt like a rehash of</text>
  <text start="171.319" dur="3.411">a bunch of different information and</text>
  <text start="173.18" dur="4.29">there really wasn&amp;#39;t that much</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="5.86">information it was story that he was</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="5.73">talking about and the story quite</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="4.35">frankly seemed corny he was talking</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="3.629">about like I said being traumatized as a</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="3.87">youth he claimed that they locked him in</text>
  <text start="186.829" dur="4.651">a box and he would cry and kick and</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="6.899">scream and locked in a box it just</text>
  <text start="191.48" dur="6.93">seemed odd to me and then some of what</text>
  <text start="195.709" dur="6.03">he said actually made no sense so the</text>
  <text start="198.41" dur="5.31">story that he talked about where he was</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="5.701">brought into this underground base and</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="5.699">then going through this shuttle and then</text>
  <text start="207.44" dur="4.139">saying he went through a portal and he</text>
  <text start="209.419" dur="5.43">was portal doffed planet now what he had</text>
  <text start="211.579" dur="4.56">said is that he had no idea how fast he</text>
  <text start="214.849" dur="2.79">was going or where he was going but he</text>
  <text start="216.139" dur="3.591">went through this portal but then he</text>
  <text start="217.639" dur="4.41">said and when about thirty minutes</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="3.939">the the shuttle ride was about thirty</text>
  <text start="222.049" dur="3.391">minutes I thought that was odd he knew</text>
  <text start="223.669" dur="3.091">how long it was we know how fast they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="4.079">going he had no idea what was going on</text>
  <text start="226.76" dur="5.19">and then he said when he had portal he</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="3.601">knew that he was off planet somewhere in</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="3.599">the solar system are out in the galaxy</text>
  <text start="233.12" dur="4.83">because he could feel quote the Schumann</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="3.81">resonances change then for a quick</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="3.27">minute they described the Schumann</text>
  <text start="239.359" dur="4.02">resonances they said that it was the</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="4.199">basically the natural frequencies that</text>
  <text start="243.379" dur="3.75">the earth emits which is true it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="245.419" dur="3.78">sometimes called Earth&amp;#39;s heartbeat</text>
  <text start="247.129" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s these frequency bands that the</text>
  <text start="249.199" dur="4.741">earth emits that all life on it in</text>
  <text start="251.359" dur="6.44">trains itself into we and train our</text>
  <text start="253.94" dur="7.62">consciousness into but my question is if</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="6.101">he left the earth how would he have felt</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="4.86">the Schumann resonance at all let alone</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="4.17">change and how do you feel the</text>
  <text start="266.42" dur="3.06">Schumann resonances it&amp;#39;s really weird to</text>
  <text start="268.07" dur="4.71">me you know he claimed to be an</text>
  <text start="269.48" dur="5.52">intuitive empath which is a label a lot</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="4.11">of people like to use on themselves and</text>
  <text start="275" dur="4.38">others these days intuitive empath but</text>
  <text start="276.89" dur="5.13">felt really odd to me and it really made</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="4.32">no sense that he had felt the Schumann</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="4.29">resonance shift even though he went</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="3.21">through a portal and he knew he was gone</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="4.26">for half an hour</text>
  <text start="286.91" dur="6.27">odd things so quite frankly all in all</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;m feeling that this is a larper LARP</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="6">live action role play that wonderful</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="5.37">each hand 4chan terminology a larper I</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="5.94">think this guy was brought forward just</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="6.03">to sell clicks make good TV to salvage</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="4.17">the cosmic disclosure brand that was</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="4.98">still theirs I mean that was there that</text>
  <text start="309.29" dur="4.65">was their child that was their most well</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="3.39">received program the most-watched</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="4.17">program was cosmic so now that Corian</text>
  <text start="315.89" dur="6.18">david aren&amp;#39;t on there they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="5.61">salvage it and okay&amp;#39;s people might be</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="3.78">saying well all this stuff you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="3.78">about this guy Jason writes you could</text>
  <text start="325.85" dur="2.79">say the same thing about Corey well</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="1.68">there&amp;#39;s a few things I have to say about</text>
  <text start="328.64" dur="3.15">that</text>
  <text start="329.18" dur="4.47">number one Corey has been vetted been</text>
  <text start="331.79" dur="4.38">vetted by David been vetted by dr.</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="7.59">Michael Saleh and others I have met him</text>
  <text start="336.17" dur="8.73">I&amp;#39;ve spent time with him to get any</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="5.88">intuitive sense of him who he is and to</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="4.2">me he has been vetted yes I have vetted</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="4.71">him others have as well number two his</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="4.23">information corroborates his info</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="3.81">corroborates when William Thompkins came</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="3.99">forward he was like what how did</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="2.91">somebody else out there know all these</text>
  <text start="357.32" dur="2.91">things that I was bringing forward I</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="4.17">didn&amp;#39;t know there was and not only that</text>
  <text start="360.23" dur="4.38">but the vetting process involved</text>
  <text start="362.72" dur="4.71">corroborating the information all over</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="6.57">the place now remind you when it comes</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="5.67">to Corey&amp;#39;s testimony it is expansive I</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="3.48">still got questions do you believe his</text>
  <text start="373.1" dur="4.83">wacko stories I think somebody asked me</text>
  <text start="374.66" dur="5.76">the other day and yeah I do because it</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="4.35">takes time and effort to really</text>
  <text start="380.42" dur="4.2">understand much like the QED topic much</text>
  <text start="382.28" dur="3.96">like any other topic is that it takes a</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="4.17">long time I&amp;#39;ve been following his story</text>
  <text start="386.24" dur="5.43">for three three plus years now it takes</text>
  <text start="388.79" dur="4.68">a long time to comprehend and the fact</text>
  <text start="391.67" dur="5.82">that he&amp;#39;s been vetted his info probe</text>
  <text start="393.47" dur="6.1">rates and lastly most importantly why</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="5.8">would people on the inside</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="7.23">be looking at Cory if he was crazy if he</text>
  <text start="403.29" dur="5.31">wasn&amp;#39;t legitimate in some way or of the</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="5.61">like why would they be looking at him</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="5.73">why would he have those sources why</text>
  <text start="412.41" dur="5.34">would he be getting leaked government</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="6.36">documents dia documents that he posted</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="4.53">online almost a year ago now Cory being</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="3.09">slipped leaked documents this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="422.28" dur="2.7">something I&amp;#39;ve talked about much but</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="2.49">it&amp;#39;s definitely something I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="424.98" dur="4.31">be talking about more in the near future</text>
  <text start="426.27" dur="6.75">and these documents were of stargates</text>
  <text start="429.29" dur="4.39">dimensional travel wormholes etc space</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="2.88">travel</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="6.63">they were scientific documents called</text>
  <text start="435.9" dur="7.73">the AUSA program and funny enough it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.31" dur="5.79">basically what to the Stars has been</text>
  <text start="443.63" dur="4.69">leaking out there trying to disclose for</text>
  <text start="446.1" dur="3.66">a while well Cory was given a couple of</text>
  <text start="448.32" dur="3.42">the documents and he put them online</text>
  <text start="449.76" dur="6.57">nearly a year ago how did that happen</text>
  <text start="451.74" dur="8.31">so Cory has sources okay I believe that</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="4.11">and for that reason they think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="2.79">legit</text>
  <text start="460.44" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;ll definitely look at him much more</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="5.61">legitimately so guy is saving face and</text>
  <text start="465.63" dur="7.05">also funny enough they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="468.45" dur="6.84">copyright the term disclosure this is a</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="4.17">new thing that&amp;#39;s making all this even</text>
  <text start="475.29" dur="4.32">more interesting I&amp;#39;ve seen over the past</text>
  <text start="476.85" dur="5.04">day on Mike barrows Facebook page Mike</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="4.23">Berra if you familiar with him he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="481.89" dur="3.87">on ancient aliens goes to some of the</text>
  <text start="483.84" dur="4.68">UFO conferences he&amp;#39;s had a couple of</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="5.1">books out Mike Berra on his Facebook</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="4.31">page posted a screenshot of a copyright</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="4.41">claim that Gaia is making on the term</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="5.02">disclosure they filed it a few months</text>
  <text start="495.27" dur="5.37">ago so you know what that means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="497.85" dur="4.4">trying to own it try to own disclosure</text>
  <text start="500.64" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to shift the narrative</text>
  <text start="502.25" dur="5.44">anything disclosure related into what</text>
  <text start="505.65" dur="4.17">they produce we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of large</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="5.37">organizations do that lately of trying</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="6.54">to bring the narrative into what they</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="5.49">want so I feel bad for the disclosure</text>
  <text start="516.36" dur="4.2">project or the full disclosure project</text>
  <text start="518.55" dur="5.57">or heck anyone out there with disclosure</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="6.36">in their name it&amp;#39;s gonna be difficult so</text>
  <text start="524.12" dur="6.73">what this is looking like in my opinion</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="6.18">is that Gaia is a limited hangout</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="3.63">operation by deaf</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="3.06">look at the definition of limited</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="4.92">hangout they give you a piece of the</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="6.83">puzzle not the full puzzle for whatever</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="6">reasons now that&amp;#39;s not to say that</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="4.72">helpful experiences can&amp;#39;t be gleaned</text>
  <text start="545.4" dur="5.16">from Gaia quite frankly I still have a</text>
  <text start="547.71" dur="5.55">guy account I do pay them 10 bucks a</text>
  <text start="550.56" dur="4.14">month of my hard-earned money and the</text>
  <text start="553.26" dur="3.45">reason being is because there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="554.7" dur="3.71">some episodes on Gaia that have some</text>
  <text start="556.71" dur="3.66">helpful information that I watch on</text>
  <text start="558.41" dur="4.09">occasion there&amp;#39;s a couple documentaries</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="3.99">on there that unfortunately I can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="4.08">anywhere else but the point I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="4.23">to make here is that when you get</text>
  <text start="566.58" dur="4.82">information from Gaia when you watch</text>
  <text start="568.59" dur="5.67">them understand what you&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="571.4" dur="6.1">okay there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff that Gaia</text>
  <text start="574.26" dur="5.76">doesn&amp;#39;t say a lot of things that need to</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="4.98">be said but they don&amp;#39;t say I have</text>
  <text start="580.02" dur="6.93">personal experience with that topics</text>
  <text start="582.48" dur="6.54">they don&amp;#39;t touch and not only that but</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="5.88">for the things they do say be very</text>
  <text start="589.02" dur="6.21">careful about deserting and distilling</text>
  <text start="592.83" dur="4.29">some of the information they do put out</text>
  <text start="595.23" dur="4.38">there and especially on this cosmic</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="3.96">disclosure program I&amp;#39;m just very</text>
  <text start="599.61" dur="4.17">interested I&amp;#39;m very interested at how</text>
