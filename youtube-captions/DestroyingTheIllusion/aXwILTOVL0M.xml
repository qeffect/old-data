  <text start="0.03" dur="5.22">what&amp;#39;s up guys first I want to say thank</text>
  <text start="3" dur="4.89">you for anybody watching my videos who</text>
  <text start="5.25" dur="6.269">have been commenting nice things and</text>
  <text start="7.89" dur="4.8">even people who have been constructively</text>
  <text start="11.519" dur="2.941">disagreeing with me</text>
  <text start="12.69" dur="3.929">I enjoyed the conversation so thank you</text>
  <text start="14.46" dur="7.29">for all the feedback anyway in this</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="8.881">video I want to discuss spiritual</text>
  <text start="21.75" dur="7.08">principles on a certain topic in my view</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="6.48">of that and that topic is a common a</text>
  <text start="28.83" dur="4.56">common theme that people will have from</text>
  <text start="31.98" dur="6.78">all walks of life when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="33.39" dur="6.87">professing a lack of belief or or</text>
  <text start="38.76" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re very negative in their beliefs</text>
  <text start="40.26" dur="5.459">and what I mean by that is when for</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="4.679">instance someone says I don&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="45.719" dur="3.66">extraterrestrials because they would be</text>
  <text start="47.219" dur="5.82">here right they would show themselves to</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="6.721">us or even they&amp;#39;ll profess a lack of</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="5.281">belief in messiah figures from various</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="5.79">religions whether it be Jesus Mohammed</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="5.82">or God you know if they&amp;#39;ll usually use</text>
  <text start="61.89" dur="7.049">it in an anthropomorphic sense which I</text>
  <text start="64.14" dur="6.99">don&amp;#39;t subscribe myself to but they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="3.811">say you know if God existed he would</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="3.84">show himself or if Jesus Muhammad</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="4.14">existed you&amp;#39;d show themselves to us you</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="5.13">know and it&amp;#39;s like black and white in</text>
  <text start="76.89" dur="5.46">their heads or they&amp;#39;ll be very negative</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.559">in their thinking they&amp;#39;ll say right if</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="4.14">good extraterrestrials existed they</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="4.111">would come save us because you know our</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="4.05">planets getting running to our planets</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="3.779">running to right now and they would</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="3.869">come down and help help us out if</text>
  <text start="92.549" dur="3.511">they&amp;#39;re really benevolent or why is</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="4.861">there cancer if there&amp;#39;s a God you know</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="8.099">he wouldn&amp;#39;t allow such bad things to</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="10.559">happen to us right and I find that these</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="7.591">perspectives are very childish right</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="5.281">very superficial not childish</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="5.13">superficial just looking at the not</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="5.28">delving any deeper into the actual</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="7.04">existence of it and in my opinion most</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="8.789">people saying these things are probably</text>
  <text start="123.92" dur="6.699">not parents right because you know I</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="2.911">have a four year old myself you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="2.551">know that now you do I have a four year</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="4.02">old and</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="7.02">you have to put your perspective right</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="5.64">we have like these third density very</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="2.85">basic perspectives of things you</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="5.85">literally have to put yourself in the</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="6">shoes of say a civilization whatever</text>
  <text start="147.6" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;d call them the star brother star</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="3.57">sisters watching over us you have to put</text>
  <text start="151.47" dur="4.11">yourself in their shoes and put yourself</text>
  <text start="152.61" dur="5.46">in the shoes of a higher spiritual power</text>
  <text start="155.58" dur="5.22">governing over you and how they would</text>
  <text start="158.07" dur="4.92">view your growth right so as a parent I</text>
  <text start="160.8" dur="4.41">look at my child and I&amp;#39;m like yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="162.99" dur="4.68">gonna try to help him along I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="165.21" dur="5.97">help him try and do things but I want</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="5.16">this kid to stand on his own as a parent</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="3.89">I can&amp;#39;t provide for him forever right</text>
  <text start="172.83" dur="4.13">the goal of a parent is to get him</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="4.18">understanding the way the world works</text>
  <text start="176.96" dur="7.54">knowing what to do knowing how to take</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="9.5">care of himself and thus I wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="6.24">to keep guiding him and right I mean I</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="3.61">parents get proud when their kids do</text>
  <text start="190.74" dur="2.97">stuff and it&amp;#39;s like yeah right he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.36" dur="2.73">driving now he&amp;#39;s driving on his own and</text>
  <text start="193.71" dur="3.74">he could tie shoes now he can feed</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="4.74">himself now that&amp;#39;s what these</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="4.15">civilizations they&amp;#39;re like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="4.56">acting as big brothers they&amp;#39;re wanting</text>
  <text start="201.6" dur="4.32">us to get our together before</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;ll make contact this is free will</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="8.19">this is why they haven&amp;#39;t openly made</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="8.87">contact because we must a mature as a</text>
  <text start="214.11" dur="8.28">civilization but B we must initiate that</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="6.55">that we must be the ones to say hey okay</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="5.21">we we invite the contact thus it would</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="5.97">not be breaking free will that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="227.6" dur="6.13">they&amp;#39;ll usually begin to contact people</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="5.67">through dreams and telepathy those who</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="8.19">at the soul level are ready enough to be</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="8.03">contacted and invited to occur and this</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="6.36">is also why right follow along here is</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="5.89">this is why we see so much negativity</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="4.23">regarding extraterrestrials in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="250.65" dur="3.99">movies and right prime time productions</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="4.19">and like when I was little I was</text>
  <text start="254.64" dur="5.13">definitely afraid of the signs movie</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="4.99">because I was deathly afraid of that and</text>
  <text start="259.77" dur="4.38">read that mind control got me because</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="4.5">what they do is try to shape public</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="2.55">opinion to view extraterrestrials as</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="2.91">being</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="5.1">and by doing this you know on a</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="4.83">collective scale we don&amp;#39;t invite them</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="4.29">into our lives because we have this</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="6.69">subconscious fear associated with them</text>
  <text start="276.09" dur="6.3">so once we have to literally mature that</text>
  <text start="280.62" dur="3.72">we have to see that mind control</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="4.86">mechanism that they&amp;#39;re using these right</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="5.4">shadow government Luciferian cult cabal</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="4.16">people we have to break through that</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="3.99">mind control that they&amp;#39;re using on us</text>
  <text start="291.41" dur="4.06">getting us only to view extras as</text>
  <text start="293.73" dur="2.91">negative and then once we mature past</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="3.24">that we say okay you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.64" dur="4.65">negative once very well but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="5.61">benevolent ones as well and you know you</text>
  <text start="301.29" dur="5.16">have to get past that point of viewing</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="3.96">them all is negative see the ones as</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="8.25">part of the positive ones and invite</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="11.79">those that you know are good per se into</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="9.36">your life and also moving on to when</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="6.21">people think okay they don&amp;#39;t exist or if</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="5.64">they do they have to be negative because</text>
  <text start="326.28" dur="6.69">why would God or these extra cereals or</text>
  <text start="329.7" dur="4.59">whatever allow all this bad to</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="2.43">happen like why don&amp;#39;t they just come</text>
  <text start="334.29" dur="4.05">down and save us and people will get</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="7.5">very cynical right with that opinion and</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="8.18">cynical of like a god figure because</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="8.76">they see all the negative stuff this is</text>
  <text start="346.52" dur="11.07">in my opinion a complete lack of self</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="9.54">responsibility because right the reason</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="5.29">so much bad stuff goes on on this planet</text>
  <text start="361.2" dur="3.87">the reason it&amp;#39;s all going to is</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.86">because our consent to let that happen I</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="4.17">was watching a video on like Facebook or</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="4.32">whatever the other day in this it was</text>
  <text start="369.24" dur="6.36">discussing this super hardcore atheist</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="6.57">you would say bone cancer children if a</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="4.2">God was real why would that exist and I</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="6.24">wish I could just talk to that man</text>
  <text start="379.8" dur="9.33">because I want to say cancer that is a</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="6.42">simple just and I don&amp;#39;t want to be too</text>
  <text start="389.13" dur="3.86">harsh with this but I want people to see</text>
  <text start="391.29" dur="5.07">what their actions are doing themselves</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="5.38">cancer is a lack of self responsibility</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="3.48">right so there&amp;#39;s some dysfunction</text>
  <text start="398.37" dur="2.09">there&amp;#39;s some disease in your body and</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="2">you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="3.63">you don&amp;#39;t want to change the way you eat</text>
  <text start="401.84" dur="4.68">and move and think and you know you</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t want to change yourself so thus</text>
  <text start="406.52" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s a current we don&amp;#39;t want to change</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="4.259">as a society that&amp;#39;s why cancer rates are</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="3.66">wanted to you know right because we</text>
  <text start="411.979" dur="2.94">can&amp;#39;t look at that darkness we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="4.35">look at the things that are causing this</text>
  <text start="414.919" dur="7.141">cancer causing this imbalance of the</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="7.169">self of ourselves so people simply have</text>
  <text start="422.06" dur="4.919">that cynical point of view because they</text>
  <text start="424.729" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t want to look at the darkness and</text>
  <text start="426.979" dur="3.961">transcend that they&amp;#39;ll see negative</text>
  <text start="429.139" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;ll see extraterrestrials as being</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="3.449">completely negative they can&amp;#39;t see the</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="7.47">benevolent ones because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="434.389" dur="8.851">to look at the darkness that is gotten</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="6.449">into their mental state their minds per</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="4.95">se so anyway that&amp;#39;s something I wanted</text>
  <text start="446.509" dur="3.66">to clarify something I seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="5.37">people as they they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="5.22">that freewill component of higher</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="7.47">spiritual powers they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="455.389" dur="7.921">that we must grow mature and take</text>
  <text start="461.03" dur="7.879">responsibility for ourselves so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.31" dur="8.88">literally not a threat to the rest of</text>
  <text start="468.909" dur="5.26">anything outside our atmosphere is what</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="3.69">so we&amp;#39;re not a threat to anything out</text>
  <text start="474.169" dur="4.861">there it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re scared of us</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="4.92">because we&amp;#39;re so we&amp;#39;re so fearful and</text>
  <text start="479.03" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re so caught up in emotional reaction</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="5.609">and get so negative and violent as a</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="7.53">collective as a society so I mean we</text>
  <text start="486.409" dur="7.32">need to relax ourselves mature our</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="6.809">brains and say okay you know I am NOT</text>
  <text start="493.729" dur="8.24">going to be such a low vibratory violent</text>
  <text start="497.419" dur="7.891">negative lack of responsible people</text>
  <text start="501.969" dur="5.111">I&amp;#39;ll be okay you know leaving leaving</text>
  <text start="505.31" dur="4.199">this planet leaving this density leaving</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.97">this this illusion or this deal that</text>
  <text start="509.509" dur="5.941">we&amp;#39;ve been caught up in for however many</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="5.489">lifetimes so anyway thank you for</text>
  <text start="515.45" dur="5.399">watching guys that&amp;#39;s my view on that if</text>
  <text start="518.539" dur="5.401">you know anybody who could benefit from</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="4.11">that perspective please share and let me</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="3.889">know if you have any comments questions</text>
