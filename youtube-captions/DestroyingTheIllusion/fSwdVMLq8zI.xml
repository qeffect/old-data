  <text start="30.8" dur="2.76">article on the Guardian right the</text>
  <text start="32.15" dur="1.92">Guardians kind of been popping up a lot</text>
  <text start="33.56" dur="5.519">lately</text>
  <text start="34.07" dur="7.8">it literally states that an astounding</text>
  <text start="39.079" dur="5.971">10 trillion dollars in taxpayer money</text>
  <text start="41.87" dur="9.619">has gone unaccounted for in 20 years</text>
  <text start="45.05" dur="8.46">since 1996 10 true 10 trillion and</text>
  <text start="51.489" dur="4.271">apparently everybody&amp;#39;s freaking out</text>
  <text start="53.51" dur="4.83">about something in Russia that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="55.76" dur="4.02">know is been on going on for months 10</text>
  <text start="58.34" dur="3.6">trillion dollars I don&amp;#39;t know how people</text>
  <text start="59.78" dur="6.84">aren&amp;#39;t looking at this number and having</text>
  <text start="61.94" dur="5.88">their minds absolutely blown by it so 10</text>
  <text start="66.62" dur="2.91">trillion I just want you to visualize</text>
  <text start="67.82" dur="4.92">and put a picture right here real quick</text>
  <text start="69.53" dur="6.6">what 10 trillion dollars actually looks</text>
  <text start="72.74" dur="6.75">like in a picture so these are stacks of</text>
  <text start="76.13" dur="4.83">$100 bills a stack of $100 bills tied up</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s a million dollars is only about</text>
  <text start="80.96" dur="3.81">the size of like a briefcase a little</text>
  <text start="83.24" dur="2.76">bag you can fit a million dollars in</text>
  <text start="84.77" dur="3.87">hundred-dollar bills in a little bag a</text>
  <text start="86" dur="4.619">hundred million would be about the</text>
  <text start="88.64" dur="4.29">pallet right here a little pallet to</text>
  <text start="90.619" dur="4.68">stack you 100 million dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="92.93" dur="4.32">hundred-dollar bills a billion dollars</text>
  <text start="95.299" dur="3.481">is about the size of a room you can feel</text>
  <text start="97.25" dur="4.04">like a bedroom right it&amp;#39;ll be like six</text>
  <text start="98.78" dur="5.189">pallets stacked or eight of them a</text>
  <text start="101.29" dur="5.95">trillion dollars right there fills up a</text>
  <text start="103.969" dur="6.451">freaking warehouse of money that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="107.24" dur="5.729">10 warehouses of money that have been</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="4.229">gone under the unaccounted for that</text>
  <text start="112.969" dur="5.04">people don&amp;#39;t know the freethought</text>
  <text start="114.649" dur="7.171">brought freethought project said now no</text>
  <text start="118.009" dur="8.631">one not even the DoD knows where it is</text>
  <text start="121.82" dur="8.61">I can tell you where it is it went into</text>
  <text start="126.64" dur="6.28">what we would call covert projects black</text>
  <text start="130.43" dur="6.6">projects or unacknowledged special</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="5.76">access projects who saps within the</text>
  <text start="137.03" dur="4.52">military-industrial complex</text>
  <text start="138.68" dur="4.64">since these corporations are prime</text>
  <text start="141.55" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re private corporations they get</text>
  <text start="143.32" dur="4.02">their money from the government but</text>
  <text start="144.46" dur="7.77">they&amp;#39;re such shrouded it&amp;#39;s shrouded such</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="7.56">secrecy that nobody knows where where</text>
  <text start="152.23" dur="4.74">this is live quite literally and my</text>
  <text start="154.9" dur="5.49">favorite thing is the movie Independence</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="6.72">Day because right there it&amp;#39;s the truth</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="5.96">in plain sight is that the first movie</text>
  <text start="163.69" dur="5.52">the one that really released in 1995</text>
  <text start="166.35" dur="4.51">when the aliens attacked right they were</text>
  <text start="169.21" dur="3.36">in such so you know the president and</text>
  <text start="170.86" dur="3.41">everything everybody in the White House</text>
  <text start="172.57" dur="5.22">was in such a frenzy that they were</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="6.01">brought down to Roswell essentially area</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="4.5">51 and the president was like what the</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="4.05">heck&amp;#39;s going on he wasn&amp;#39;t read in on</text>
  <text start="182.29" dur="5.78">these projects and that&amp;#39;s precisely what</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="5.76">happens in the political climate is that</text>
  <text start="188.07" dur="4.33">congressional leaders are sell in tons</text>
  <text start="190.09" dur="6.3">intelligence committee even presidents</text>
  <text start="192.4" dur="7.32">if they aren&amp;#39;t found to be in with the</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="5.76">cabal&amp;#39;s plans right if they&amp;#39;re not dark</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="4.05">and twisted and wanting to use these</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="4.38">technologies and scientists is that they</text>
  <text start="203.77" dur="3.84">have for the bad stuff they aren&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="2.64">in on the projects they go</text>
  <text start="207.61" dur="3.51">unacknowledged people you know if</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re asked about it people are in</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="4.17">these projects that tight lips tight</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="3.78">lips sink ships and they will quite</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="6.09">literally be killed or tried with</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="8.09">treason if they talk so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="221.38" dur="6.72">reality of the situation and this money</text>
  <text start="224.91" dur="6.01">flows into these projects and in the</text>
  <text start="228.1" dur="5.43">movie Independence Day a quote in that</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="3.96">movie was you know the president asking</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="3.179">you about hey you know the reverse</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="3.48">engineering of Roswell he goes how do we</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="3.181">get funding for all this how does it</text>
  <text start="238.36" dur="2.96">really happen and one of the characters</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="4.83">goes you don&amp;#39;t think they really spent</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="7.06">$30,000 on a toilet seat do you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="5.58">exactly what he says and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="6.12">the state of the situation is that in</text>
  <text start="250.3" dur="5.939">this article it outlines how they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="254.5" dur="5.519">have two or three hundred percent</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="7.051">markups on the stuff that they order and</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="5.221">at the end of the year to balance the</text>
  <text start="263.29" dur="3.66">books between the treasury and the DoD</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="3.09">and the you know defense contractors</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="2.9">they just zero it out they make that</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="6.6">numbers add up without having the actual</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="9.039">receipts or logs there so they swipe on</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="6.69">the amounts of money and there is crazy</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="5.911">amounts of stuff that is billed out both</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="4.71">below ground and above ground and in the</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="3.39">movie Independence Day it doesn&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="286.33" dur="4.17">show you at least in the first one how</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="4.319">much was really been built out but in</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="5.13">the sequel Wow why did they release a</text>
  <text start="292.509" dur="4.38">sequel you know 20 years later just put</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="3.42">the truth in plain sight again that</text>
  <text start="296.889" dur="4.141">predictive type programming their first</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="5.28">various reasons I won&amp;#39;t get into here</text>
  <text start="301.03" dur="7.56">but look at that movie it&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="6.36">what&amp;#39;s freakin happening and imagine</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="5.34">like with 10 trillion dollars what you</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="6.27">could literally build out with that so</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="5.43">we have Phil Schneider for instance if</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="4.53">you look into his name this was a man</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="5.52">over 20 years ago even before the movie</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="5.7">Independence Day a lot of people go I</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="3.629">hear often a lot of people say oh what</text>
  <text start="327.19" dur="3.09">if they&amp;#39;re just getting their ideas for</text>
  <text start="328.509" dur="3.181">mainstream media well that&amp;#39;s one reason</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="3.63">they put these ideas right in front of</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="3.42">you so people will it&amp;#39;ll disassociate in</text>
  <text start="333.91" dur="3.21">their subconscious and they won&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="4.619">you seriously anyway Phil Schneider</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="4.289">tangent there he was blowing the whistle</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="5.22">on what&amp;#39;s called domes deep underground</text>
  <text start="341.409" dur="5.01">military bases and a lot of the I would</text>
  <text start="344.949" dur="3.331">venture to guess you know a logical</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="3.151">conclusion can be made that this money</text>
  <text start="348.28" dur="4.65">flows into these deep underground</text>
  <text start="349.57" dur="4.86">military bases so we have the below</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="3.269">ground stuff and these domes are</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="5.19">probably all over the country if not the</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="5.821">world lots of information out there</text>
  <text start="359.62" dur="4.829">about them being a few in Antarctica as</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="4.38">well and a lot of current disclosures of</text>
  <text start="364.449" dur="3.9">Antarctica we won&amp;#39;t get into here but</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="3.93">not only below ground is their</text>
  <text start="368.349" dur="7.461">infrastructure but also above ground all</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="9.48">of the saucer technology and advanced</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="5.53">electrogravitic whatever names you want</text>
  <text start="379.81" dur="4.38">to associate with the technology they</text>
  <text start="381.34" dur="5.91">have magnetohydrodynamic or whatnot but</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="4.77">craft UFO crap very advanced sciences</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="4.44">and technologies that are in these</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="3.78">specialized projects none of the none of</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="2.58">the important stuff will be on the</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="5.669">ground loop either be a lot a below</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="7.649">ground or various type craft or whatnot</text>
  <text start="398.409" dur="6.541">in the atmosphere or in deeper parts of</text>
  <text start="401.919" dur="4.831">space so lots of money goes into below</text>
  <text start="404.95" dur="3.04">ground above ground stuff and then</text>
  <text start="406.75" dur="4.53">lastly here I</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="6.09">want you to entertain the thought of</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="5.74">once you attain I need 10 trillion</text>
  <text start="414.08" dur="4.8">dollars right we had Donald Rumsfeld</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="4.77">testified the day before 9/11 to two</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="4.47">point three trillion dollars so this is</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;d love to talk about this issue it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="423.35" dur="4.35">very important issue it&amp;#39;s a huge duck to</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="3.54">connect all of this where all this</text>
  <text start="427.7" dur="3.3">siphoned money goes we have Donald</text>
  <text start="429.41" dur="3.09">Rumsfeld testified the day before 9/11</text>
  <text start="431" dur="4.35">to two point three trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="4.02">missing then we have you know all the</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="3.81">information coming out the past couple</text>
  <text start="436.52" dur="5.22">of years this report and two years ago</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="4.89">2015 it was eight point five trillion so</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="4.62">a lot it&amp;#39;s an exponential like siphoning</text>
  <text start="444.05" dur="5.34">off that&amp;#39;s happening but once you get to</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="4.41">a certain amount of technology that you</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="4.8">have built-in that in the covert</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="6.78">projects you can then explore into space</text>
  <text start="454.19" dur="4.5">and build essentially a self-sustaining</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="3.21">civilization</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="5.49">well you&amp;#39;d call a breakaway civilization</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="5.25">so another logical conclusion could be</text>
  <text start="464.18" dur="5.34">made quite literally that there would be</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="5.94">facilities on parts of planets that we</text>
  <text start="469.52" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t get to see that are very much</text>
  <text start="471.95" dur="4.8">there they could be mining doing various</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="4.74">operations and whatnot I mean is it so</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="4.71">far-fetched to think that there could</text>
  <text start="478.4" dur="4.71">have been men on Mars already we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="481.46" dur="3.75">been back to the moon in forty years I</text>
  <text start="483.11" dur="3.72">wonder why we know they swiped all of</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="4.41">Tesla papers and have tea towns of</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="4.83">Browns work from the early 1900&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="4.07">there&amp;#39;s over a hundred years of research</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="4.13">research and development into</text>
  <text start="493.69" dur="6.63">electrogravitic</text>
  <text start="495.79" dur="7.21">to even temporal and time shifting craft</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="7.39">consciousness technologies anti-aging</text>
  <text start="503" dur="7.11">all kinds of mind-blowing stuff that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="4.77">out there and they&amp;#39;ve been developing</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="5.85">away from us and boom it&amp;#39;s I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.48" dur="4.77">just it doesn&amp;#39;t take that much of a</text>
  <text start="515.96" dur="3.03">reach to really understand when you</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="4.59">begin putting the dots connect together</text>
  <text start="518.99" dur="4.59">and with this ten trillion dollar dot</text>
  <text start="521.84" dur="4.02">that I wanted to speak to you about in</text>
  <text start="523.58" dur="6.24">this video very important to understand</text>
  <text start="525.86" dur="6.81">and it and it helps the logical process</text>
  <text start="529.82" dur="5.76">along when understanding how a secret</text>
  <text start="532.67" dur="5.19">space program or secret underground</text>
  <text start="535.58" dur="4.05">program or any of these secret projects</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="3">could really be there oh they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="539.63" dur="2.73">much they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="3.42">not known about because of how</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="6.75">compartmentalized everything really is</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="7.89">and people don&amp;#39;t take this stuff</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="5.07">seriously which is why it&amp;#39;s not very</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="3.9">much known about so really becoming</text>
  <text start="554.18" dur="3.12">conscious and taking things seriously</text>
  <text start="556.07" dur="2.67">and have the courage in your own hand</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="4.05">own head to take things these things</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="4.8">seriously then the answers the answers</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="3.75">will become obvious to you and you will</text>
  <text start="563.54" dur="3.63">just essentially you won&amp;#39;t even have to</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="4.89">think about it you just be like oh man I</text>
  <text start="567.17" dur="4.17">just feel that&amp;#39;s true so I want you guys</text>
  <text start="569.99" dur="4.11">to take a lot of these concepts</text>
  <text start="571.34" dur="4.53">seriously breakaway civilizations</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="5.61">massive amounts of money siphon off from</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="5.7">humanity very advanced technologies UFO</text>
  <text start="579.71" dur="3.94">disclosure it&amp;#39;s all very real stuff</text>
  <text start="581.57" dur="13.43">anyway done</text>
