  <text start="9.71" dur="8.44">so in this video I want to get serious</text>
  <text start="13.46" dur="7.329">right and and I want to discuss some</text>
  <text start="18.15" dur="3.45">deeper philosophical concepts about all</text>
  <text start="20.789" dur="3.15">of this</text>
  <text start="21.6" dur="3.419">full disclosure partial disclosure are</text>
  <text start="23.939" dur="2.361">we gonna get the truth and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="25.019" dur="4.971">gonna get the truth yadda yadda yadda</text>
  <text start="26.3" dur="6.189">because I was having some deep</text>
  <text start="29.99" dur="4.87">conversations with a friend of mine last</text>
  <text start="32.489" dur="4.711">night over a little bit of marijuana and</text>
  <text start="34.86" dur="6.51">I wanted to do a video on them because I</text>
  <text start="37.2" dur="7.23">thought they were very important and the</text>
  <text start="41.37" dur="7.47">reason I believe that we are not getting</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="7.05">that full disclosure that we all right</text>
  <text start="48.84" dur="4.32">we completely desire we all want the</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="3.719">full truth nothing but the truth</text>
  <text start="53.16" dur="4.32">right now let&amp;#39;s just rip the band-aid</text>
  <text start="55.199" dur="3.571">off and get to it that&amp;#39;s the type of</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="4.11">person I am that&amp;#39;s the type of person</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="4.559">that a lot of other people are and are</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="3.959">becoming because we&amp;#39;re just sick of the</text>
  <text start="63.329" dur="4.981">control and sick of the lies sick of not</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="4.771">having the truth but the thing is when</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="3.87">you look at what&amp;#39;s going on on a</text>
  <text start="70.32" dur="3">collective scale right this full</text>
  <text start="72.18" dur="4.41">disclosure is waiting and waiting</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="5.76">waiting for that directly mears what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="8.06">going on in each of our individual lives</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="11.88">as above so below as within so without</text>
  <text start="84.65" dur="9.07">so what I want you to look at is look at</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="6.049">the mirror right now look at yourself in</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="7.039">the mirror and ask yourself are you</text>
  <text start="97.009" dur="7.271">completely open honest and transparent</text>
  <text start="100.759" dur="6.43">with every single person in your life</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="6.449">right now from your significant other to</text>
  <text start="107.189" dur="7.201">your kids to your friends to your work</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="6.99">colleagues to your family because if</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="7.229">we&amp;#39;re not having full disclosure in our</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="6.69">own individual lives how is that going</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="6.87">to manifest itself on a grand scale of</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="5.281">being a full disclosure and I think of</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="3.72">it this way I actually think of it in a</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="3.7">couple ways and when I say all this</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="3.491">right this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="4.08">like me acting like I&amp;#39;m completely full</text>
  <text start="135.7" dur="3.48">disclosure and I&amp;#39;m also honest and</text>
  <text start="137.47" dur="3.56">transparent I still there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="139.18" dur="7.56">people in my own life that I still am</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="9.07">working the courage courage to tell</text>
  <text start="146.74" dur="6.75">because like I said I think of it this</text>
  <text start="150.1" dur="6.48">way if we all had that courage to tell</text>
  <text start="153.49" dur="5.64">every single person in our life all the</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="4.379">frickin truths and conspiracies and</text>
  <text start="159.13" dur="3.96">whatever that we believe in hey just</text>
  <text start="160.959" dur="4.911">look at this information boom no shits</text>
  <text start="163.09" dur="5.07">given that would absolutely</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="4.6">revolutionize and speed up this process</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="7.98">and get everything moving so much</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="7.88">quicker okay take a step further we as a</text>
  <text start="176.14" dur="4.44">society are moving towards having</text>
  <text start="178.35" dur="4.81">enhanced abilities of our consciousness</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="4.74">of our psyche right what if it was just</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="4.98">a big old telepathic civilization we</text>
  <text start="185.32" dur="7.32">were just one social memory complex no</text>
  <text start="188.14" dur="5.73">secrets no secrets to hide right maybe</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="2.61">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re not getting full</text>
  <text start="193.87" dur="3">disclosure because we all still have</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="3.959">secrets that we&amp;#39;re hiding in our</text>
  <text start="196.87" dur="5.7">individual lives I know I do I&amp;#39;m working</text>
  <text start="199.209" dur="5.191">past them so think of that think wow if</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="2.9">I want full disclosure man maybe I have</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="4.26">to start telling the truth</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="6.549">there you go that&amp;#39;s how we get it we</text>
  <text start="208.66" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t get it by continuously focusing on</text>
  <text start="212.019" dur="3.871">all of this disclosure knowledge coming</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="4.92">out and hoping it&amp;#39;s just gonna save the</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="5.159">world it&amp;#39;s crucial it&amp;#39;s important but</text>
  <text start="219.43" dur="4.83">really if we want full disclosure what</text>
  <text start="221.049" dur="6.301">we have to do is open up to every single</text>
  <text start="224.26" dur="7.259">person that we interact with down here</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="7.47">down on earth and we need the courage to</text>
  <text start="231.519" dur="5.131">do that right I&amp;#39;m trying to help people</text>
  <text start="234.82" dur="3.36">have courage by do these videos and</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="4.77">putting my face out there cuz I want you</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="4.32">guys to not have any fear with talking</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="5.49">to your friends and family about this</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="6.87">stuff about anything actually and it</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="4.35">kind of helps me open my own self up</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="9.41">doing these videos so not only do we</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="10.05">need the courage but we also need oh man</text>
  <text start="258.78" dur="4.12">I&amp;#39;ve thought of that adjective earlier</text>
  <text start="261.31" dur="4.53">but it&amp;#39;s totally spacing my brain out</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="4.05">there right now so we we not only need</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="3.12">that courage but we</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="3.9">we need to realize that if we want that</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="3.84">full disclosure we have to look at</text>
  <text start="270.85" dur="6.03">ourselves we have to have the self</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="5.64">honesty and the maturity to get that</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="3.48">full disclosure that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="4.37">talk about I thought of this all these</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="4.53">concepts last night that&amp;#39;s kind of high</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="3.73">not only do we the courage we need the</text>
  <text start="284.89" dur="3.21">maturity because we&amp;#39;re getting to a</text>
  <text start="286.54" dur="3.33">point where when this full disclosure</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="3.9">happens I also think one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s not happening is because everybody</text>
  <text start="292" dur="3.99">has this I told you so attitude and</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="4.29">grained into them and we can&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="3.93">because that&amp;#39;s still serving the self</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s still serving the ego with these</text>
  <text start="299.92" dur="4.35">disclosures because when I saw those</text>
  <text start="302.23" dur="3.66">vault 7 disclosures come out I was kind</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="3.42">of reading all the alternative media and</text>
  <text start="305.89" dur="3.27">everybody was saying Oh conspiracy</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="3.35">theorists vindicated oh my gosh right</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="4.53">this is this is our moment in the light</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="4.24">it with it just a tiny little vault 7</text>
  <text start="313.69" dur="3.12">disclosure there&amp;#39;s so much more out</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="3.12">there that could happen and yet people</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="3.48">were taking this tiny little thing and</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="4.05">being like oh yeah I&amp;#39;m the conspiracy</text>
  <text start="320.29" dur="4.17">theorist I&amp;#39;m right now ha ha ha that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.45" dur="5.58">so bad that serves the own ego in the</text>
  <text start="324.46" dur="6.69">self just as much as plenty of other</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="4.83">ways to go about that just as many other</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="4.08">you know you get what I&amp;#39;m saying it</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="7.1">completely serves the self and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.23" dur="4.73">not spiritual growth that&amp;#39;s not being</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="5.74">compassionate and service to others now</text>
  <text start="342.79" dur="4.29">is it so when this all happens we really</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="3.48">need to mature up and not have that I</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="3.84">told you so attitude there I mean if a</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="4.02">disclosure a big old full disclosure</text>
  <text start="350.92" dur="5.82">were to happen there might be a little</text>
  <text start="353.23" dur="6.03">bit of i-told-you-so just to get them to</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="4.68">understand that you&amp;#39;re right you&amp;#39;re they</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="3.78">should be taking you seriously because</text>
  <text start="361.42" dur="3.42">they weren&amp;#39;t in the past but it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="363.04" dur="4.41">be ok I told you so now let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="4.23">together and that&amp;#39;s what an attitude I</text>
  <text start="367.45" dur="3.42">think a lot more of us need to have an</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="4.41">ideal with myself sometimes is not being</text>
  <text start="370.87" dur="5.64">that i-told-you-so person and that and</text>
  <text start="373.48" dur="5.79">if we only extended right not only had</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="4.23">the courage to talk more to our friends</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="3.33">and family about how we really feel and</text>
  <text start="380.74" dur="4.47">what we really think but do it</text>
  <text start="382.6" dur="5.61">compassionately don&amp;#39;t do it with a I</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="5.67">told you so attitude but a I just want</text>
  <text start="388.21" dur="4.05">you to understand and break down those</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="5.07">belief systems and those false</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="5.55">perceptions you have for yourself I want</text>
  <text start="395.95" dur="4.32">you to realize your full potential and</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="4.53">humanity&amp;#39;s full potential by</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="4.95">you get rid of those belief systems and</text>
  <text start="402.34" dur="6.27">adopt other want more beneficial more</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="6.54">real ones to you so anyway if we only</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="7.55">did those two things if we only looked</text>
  <text start="411.76" dur="4.4">at ourselves in the mirror and also</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="4.36">brought these kinds of topics and ideas</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="3.87">up to other people with more compassion</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re gonna get that full disclosure so</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="5.88">much faster and not have to deal with</text>
  <text start="425.95" dur="6.3">any partial disclosure nonsense</text>
