  <text start="8.599" dur="4.571">yo what&amp;#39;s going on guys Jordan say thir</text>
  <text start="11.28" dur="3.75">here and it&amp;#39;s June 15th and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="4.77">run through some news for you today so</text>
  <text start="15.03" dur="5.28">first and foremost WikiLeaks they</text>
  <text start="17.94" dur="4.679">dropped another edition in their vault</text>
  <text start="20.31" dur="4.68">seven files this one was called cherry</text>
  <text start="22.619" dur="4.74">blossom and it was actually a CIA</text>
  <text start="24.99" dur="6.18">project that they did with Stanford</text>
  <text start="27.359" dur="7.171">where they were able to create some</text>
  <text start="31.17" dur="5.49">malware to monitor and exploit wireless</text>
  <text start="34.53" dur="5.13">networking devices so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="36.66" dur="4.649">if you got Linksys if you&amp;#39;ve got Belkin</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="4.59">if you&amp;#39;ve got d-link you&amp;#39;re pretty much</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="4.98">screwed and the CIA can hack your stuff</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="3.93">but just a word on all the vault seven</text>
  <text start="46.289" dur="4.381">files anumita</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="4.469">I mean as they keep coming out the thing</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="5.52">I think of every time I see one I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="52.649" dur="6.201">duh of course the CIA can do this stuff</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="5.73">so I mean again they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="58.85" dur="6.07">exposing the really deep dark stuff that</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="5.129">we know the CIA is into but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="3.78">getting there and I&amp;#39;m really hoping that</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="2.551">they speed up some of their leaks and I</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t even remember the last time</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="3.87">actually they dropped a edition of their</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="3.72">vault seven files I think it&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="73.47" dur="4.92">while so I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="5.49">but I hope WikiLeaks starts a a little</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="4.409">more of a flood there next we have the</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="3.78">representative that was shot yesterday</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="5.191">so everybody really knows this by now</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="7.559">but a representative Steve Scalise</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="7.08">scalice was shot in Virginia and</text>
  <text start="92.579" dur="6.391">apparently a shooter just basically went</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="5.64">on to the baseball field and opened fire</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="4.56">shot a bunch of people he ended up</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="5.13">getting shot himself but what I found</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="4.14">that was interesting is that in recent</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="4.559">weeks this representative actually</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="4.89">released multa video and tweeted about</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="3.9">the human trafficking issue and it</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="5.61">looked like he was very involved in</text>
  <text start="114.299" dur="7.201">politics in ending human trafficking now</text>
  <text start="118.17" dur="6.059">this is very interesting because what</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="6">large political players are at risk of</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="6.361">human trafficking investigations a lot</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="3.52">of them so is that the motivation there</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="3.43">seems</text>
  <text start="131.02" dur="6.27">be a lot of motivation behind this</text>
  <text start="134.02" dur="5.49">shooting and that may I mean the shooter</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="5.73">this leads me to question if he was or</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="6.69">if he was not MK ULTRA and it was this</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="7.26">some kind of mind control</text>
  <text start="146.2" dur="5.55">plot to be done to divide basically</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="3.56">Democrats and Republicans because this</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="4.62">was at a Democrat versus Republican</text>
  <text start="153.84" dur="4.51">baseball game and we know how much</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="4.29">political tension there is in this</text>
  <text start="158.35" dur="6.72">country right now so it just completely</text>
  <text start="160.66" dur="8.46">seems reasonable that he would be a part</text>
  <text start="165.07" dur="6.36">of agenda to foster more political</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="3.9">divide because obviously we know the</text>
  <text start="171.43" dur="4.53">powers that be they want division they</text>
  <text start="173.02" dur="5.28">want us all to be separated they want us</text>
  <text start="175.96" dur="4.35">you know to be within that divide and</text>
  <text start="178.3" dur="5.19">conquer play that they was trying to do</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="5.07">so don&amp;#39;t fall for that right I mean</text>
  <text start="183.49" dur="3.09">let&amp;#39;s you I don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="3.72">deal with labels I don&amp;#39;t deal with</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="5.49">Democrat this or Republican that because</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s just it boxes you in and it</text>
  <text start="192.07" dur="4.83">simply divides you and it dehumanizes</text>
  <text start="194.29" dur="5.49">you in a way so let&amp;#39;s not fall into that</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="4.92">political divide and you know I think</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see if any more</text>
  <text start="201.82" dur="5.85">information about the shooting comes out</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="5.97">and his ties to human trafficking or I</text>
  <text start="207.67" dur="3.75">should say ending human trafficking not</text>
  <text start="209.53" dur="3.179">ties to human trafficking but that was</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="3.33">just something very interesting I wanted</text>
  <text start="212.709" dur="5.071">to throw out there next we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="5.31">into Oliver Stone Oliver Stone has a</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="4.89">four-part series coming out of Showtime</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="5.04">I believe now or soon where he</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="3.69">interviews Vladimir Putin and for the</text>
  <text start="225.1" dur="3.57">last couple of years he&amp;#39;s been making</text>
  <text start="226.36" dur="3.83">trips to Russia to interview Putin and</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s now coming out in these</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="4.84">documentaries on Showtime and all I have</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="6.3">to say about that is the MSM is just</text>
  <text start="235.03" dur="7.08">talking crap I typed Oliver Stone</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="4.41">interviews Putin into Google looked up</text>
  <text start="242.11" dur="3.45">everything that came up and no matter</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="4.97">what mainstream site it came from</text>
  <text start="245.56" dur="7.26">whether it was Politico or CNN or</text>
  <text start="248.94" dur="5.53">anything that came up it was all late it</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="4.59">had a blatant narrative behind it a</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="4.85">blatant bias against Vladimir Putin and</text>
  <text start="257.41" dur="3.83">then Oliver Stone he goes</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="6.06">Stephen Colbert just the other night and</text>
  <text start="261.24" dur="7.05">Colbert was just too completely reading</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="4.35">this guy and trying to try to stump him</text>
  <text start="268.29" dur="4.53">and he was awfully throwing his</text>
  <text start="269.73" dur="4.5">mainstream media bias out there so it</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="4.8">was sad to see an Oliver Stone</text>
  <text start="274.23" dur="5.91">he&amp;#39;s the award-winning director who what</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="3.3">was that award show was just a couple</text>
  <text start="280.14" dur="3.81">months ago</text>
  <text start="280.92" dur="4.71">anyway he won an award I believe for his</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="4.74">Snowden movie and he was up on stage</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="4.29">there it might have been the guild the</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="3.6">guild awards or something that effect</text>
  <text start="289.92" dur="4.26">but he was completely calling out the</text>
  <text start="292.29" dur="3.96">military-industrial complex on stage</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="3.66">there so I love Oliver Stone I&amp;#39;m happy</text>
  <text start="296.25" dur="3.51">you got to interview Putin I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="297.84" dur="4.08">seen the documentary yet but I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="299.76" dur="3.48">sure it&amp;#39;s good especially if the</text>
  <text start="301.92" dur="3.45">mainstream media is talking so much crap</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="5.25">as they are so that&amp;#39;s how I see that</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="6.93">scenario and then next we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="308.49" dur="5.52">to into this very interesting story</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s coming out of Florida that we</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="4.7">should definitely keep our eyes on and</text>
  <text start="315.54" dur="6.9">that is a bunch of legal professionals</text>
  <text start="318.71" dur="6.7">passing away very mysteriously all in</text>
  <text start="322.44" dur="4.56">the same area in Florida and it may or</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="2.94">may not we don&amp;#39;t know yeah that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="327" dur="2.64">I&amp;#39;m saying keep your eye on it do some</text>
  <text start="328.35" dur="3.06">investigative work on your own if you</text>
  <text start="329.64" dur="4.53">want to but they all may or may not be</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="5.52">tied into the DNC fraud lawsuit and this</text>
  <text start="334.17" dur="4.67">lawsuit is one that is coming out of</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.01">Florida against this woman right here</text>
  <text start="338.84" dur="5.22">debbie Wasserman Schultz and the</text>
  <text start="341.94" dur="7.38">Democratic National Committee about</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="7.5">their election fraud and these legal</text>

  <text start="359.82" dur="5.93">June 9th all in the same area this guy</text>

  <text start="386.3" dur="5.429">Florida area he was found on Hollywood</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="5.46">Beach in I think that&amp;#39;s in Miami with</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="5.521">what they suspect to be head trauma from</text>
  <text start="394.34" dur="6.27">a potential gunshot wound so lots of</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="6.21">very interesting deaths all in the same</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="4.41">district of this woman in Florida who</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="3.33">Debbie mock but debbie Wasserman Schultz</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="3.99">again was the head of the Democratic</text>
  <text start="406.79" dur="3.689">National Committee so these may or may</text>
  <text start="409.01" dur="4.98">not be connected to the DNC fraud</text>
  <text start="410.479" dur="6.301">lawsuit but no you let your intuition do</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="4.41">the talking there so that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="416.78" dur="4.35">I have to say about that at the moment</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="6.75">and then lastly I want to do a little</text>
  <text start="421.13" dur="6.03">bit of fake news alert and this one</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="4.2">CBS takes the cake today they get the</text>
  <text start="427.16" dur="4.5">dunce cap of the day for their fake news</text>
  <text start="429.35" dur="5.099">and what they did was try to report an</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="4.92">article on Donald Trump they said in the</text>
  <text start="434.449" dur="4.53">headline of the GAR article that Trump</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="5.43">sells 19 billion dollars in arms to</text>
  <text start="438.979" dur="5.431">Qatar after accusing them of being</text>
  <text start="442.01" dur="6">terrorists but then literally in the</text>
  <text start="444.41" dur="6.21">same article CBS goes to state that it</text>
  <text start="448.01" dur="5.52">was this was a deal that was ratified in</text>
  <text start="450.62" dur="5.43">2000 in November 2016 under President</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="4.139">Obama but in the headline they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="5.489">to pin it all on Trump so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="5.671">again it&amp;#39;s literal mainstream media mind</text>
  <text start="461.539" dur="4.531">control because you get to see how they</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="4.139">operate they take information they</text>
  <text start="466.07" dur="3.659">cherry-pick information they put</text>
  <text start="467.479" dur="5.101">specific narratives on it it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="469.729" dur="5.16">to do with you know misinformation these</text>
  <text start="472.58" dur="4.29">days there&amp;#39;s a lot of those</text>
  <text start="474.889" dur="4.071">disinformation campaigns out there not</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="4.62">only in the mainstream media versus</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="5.709">whoever they&amp;#39;re going up against but in</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="4.89">all of these smaller kind of true thing</text>
  <text start="484.669" dur="4.231">investigative communities there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="5.64">of disinformation agents out there and</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s very easy to see how they</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="7.079">manipulate data to manipulate your minds</text>
  <text start="494.84" dur="6.78">so always look at the data and make sure</text>
  <text start="499.099" dur="5.82">that you&amp;#39;re not being misinformed out</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="5.519">there so that was one of little</text>
  <text start="504.919" dur="4.641">interesting tidbit that I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="4.971">floating around that</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s very easy to quash there so anyway</text>
