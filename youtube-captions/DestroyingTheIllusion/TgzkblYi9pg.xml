  <text start="40.62" dur="5.22">the resident cryptocurrency expert here</text>
  <text start="43.62" dur="3.869">I was checking out the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="45.84" dur="4.199">markets this morning and noticed that</text>
  <text start="47.489" dur="5.191">Bitcoin is a little lower than it used</text>
  <text start="50.039" dur="4.621">to be you know a couple months ago it</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="3.51">was higher and now the markets just</text>
  <text start="54.66" dur="3.539">seemed to have steadied out so what are</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="4.889">your thoughts on that yeah so you know</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="6">we obviously had a bubble move going</text>
  <text start="61.079" dur="5.4">into the end of 2017 and those moves</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="5.071">tend to retrace almost all the way back</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="4.471">and they almost did and then people</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="4.169">called for it basically the complete</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="4.559">collapse of crypto but what happened was</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="5.04">we had a what&amp;#39;s called a 100 percent</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="6.571">retracement in the price of the bitcoin</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="5.191">and and rolled back down again but then</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="2.94">every time it&amp;#39;s going down money is</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="4.26">being bought by what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="5.099">institutional buyer so money is leaving</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="4.74">the retail sector is moving into the</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="5.82">institutional big money&amp;#39;s buying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="6.12">anticipating ETS for Bitcoin they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="5.191">anticipating other banks getting</text>
  <text start="98.79" dur="4.8">involved in like square now you know the</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="4.32">banking they&amp;#39;re getting into crypto</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="4.23">currencies now too and you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="4.349">start seeing more and more what we call</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="4.229">these Wall street-type players getting</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="4.921">into the cryptocurrency space and they</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.89">needed to push the price down because no</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="4.439">way they were gonna buy it at the top so</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="3.991">just like they do for silver and like</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="3.451">they do for other commodities they go in</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="4.14">there and they what they called a naked</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="4.35">short it or they paper short it cuz they</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="4.829">created a futures market for it and just</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="5.85">force people out of their positions so</text>
  <text start="129.899" dur="3.901">that they could buy a cheaper JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="5.34">is doing it with silver</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="6.66">and and basically the the New York</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="3.84">exchange is doing it with Bitcoin but</text>
  <text start="140.46" dur="3.6">they can&amp;#39;t push it down anymore every</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="4.8">time they try to get it down below 6,000</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="6.48">it pops up and just last week we just</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="6.12">had a one day 5% move and what that</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="5.07">tells us is that there&amp;#39;s so much buyer</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="4.68">interest in this is when the banker and</text>
  <text start="155.61" dur="3.99">what happened was it was a in exchange</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="4.05">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of shorting a Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="4.71">that exchange had to shut down for</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="4.14">maintenance when an exchange shut down</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="4.32">for maintenance there was nobody in</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="6.24">there fake shorting it and Bitcoin shot</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="5.01">up five hundred dollars in 15 minutes so</text>
  <text start="172.02" dur="3.93">it just shows you it&amp;#39;s artificially</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="3.48">being suppressed and at some point</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to continue</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="4.2">that suppression and price is gonna move</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="4.5">back higher again so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="4.86">bullish on cryptos and really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="4.86">crypto currencies is kind of a hedge</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="5.22">against political risk against banking</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="4.47">risk against dollar risk and as those</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="3.81">things get more and more disrupted</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;ll see cryptocurrencies continue to</text>
  <text start="195.21" dur="3.81">move higher we tell people look you got</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="4.92">to keep buying a little bit every week</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="4.98">and build your portfolio and we have a</text>
  <text start="202.32" dur="3.81">software Jordan as we talked about</text>
  <text start="204" dur="4.35">before that tell people when to buy it</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="3.69">when to sell it or when to buy it or</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="4.08">want to take a little bit off the table</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="5.28">and we&amp;#39;ve been on the right side of this</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="6.06">move all year and so we don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="5.46">care per se we&amp;#39;re helping people lower</text>
  <text start="218.49" dur="4.23">and lower their cost of of their</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="4.23">ownership price and so when we do get</text>
  <text start="222.72" dur="3.92">the next big move which we will get</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="4.41">people are gonna make a lot of money</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="7.24">awesome so right now bitcoins trading at</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="6">about 64 40 so what do you see from here</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="3.27">how long is it gonna take for it to get</text>
  <text start="235.2" dur="3.63">above you know seven eight thousand and</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="6.09">people we need to get a good return on</text>
  <text start="238.83" dur="6.24">it yeah so yeah my view is between now</text>
  <text start="243.24" dur="4.2">and the election you&amp;#39;ll see the dollar</text>
  <text start="245.07" dur="5.13">roll over some and then you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="5.79">you&amp;#39;ll see Bitcoin 78 to 90 200 is our</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="5.64">next our next target area but anything</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="3.75">below 6,000 I think I think you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="4.709">gonna see that anymore</text>
  <text start="256.98" dur="4.98">I think most days awesome so discuss a</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="2.911">little bit about this software you just</text>

  <text start="465" dur="4.56">moves this year in Bitcoin and our</text>
  <text start="467.25" dur="5.13">software caught those moves so even</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="5.49">though bitcoins down 70% people who</text>
  <text start="472.38" dur="6.87">trade with us had two opportunities to</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="5.429">double their money in 2018 alone and</text>
  <text start="479.25" dur="3.479">we&amp;#39;ll probably get in there thirty to</text>
