  <text start="13.92" dur="4.109">come into my life multiple times over</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="4.711">the past couple weeks so being how</text>
  <text start="18.029" dur="5.461">synchronistic it all is I wanted to make</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="6.989">this video to address that very concept</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="5.4">and the first time this showed up was</text>
  <text start="27.509" dur="3.871">when I was at the Eclipse of disclosure</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="4.62">conference sitting on the speaker&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="31.38" dur="4.59">panel at the end of the conference I had</text>

  <text start="44.55" dur="5.04">the Q&amp;amp;A session there was a woman in the</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="4.98">audience and bless her heart she was</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="6">asking the whole panel this very</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="6.9">personal question and her question was</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="6.39">what advice could we give her what</text>
  <text start="59.16" dur="5.999">advice could we offer her because her</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="5.76">family was beginning to figure out where</text>
  <text start="65.159" dur="5.191">her beliefs really were her family was</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="5.309">beginning to view her as the black sheep</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="5.549">right and unfortunately I didn&amp;#39;t get a</text>
  <text start="73.049" dur="4.11">chance to offer any advice her answered</text>
  <text start="75.899" dur="3.96">that question at all while I was on that</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="4.681">panel that day but hey that&amp;#39;s why I have</text>
  <text start="79.859" dur="4.5">this camera and this YouTube channel to</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="4.319">do that now not only did it happen that</text>
  <text start="84.359" dur="4.981">day but like I said it happened again</text>
  <text start="86.159" dur="5.731">and that was when I was working with one</text>
  <text start="89.34" dur="4.379">of my online coaching clients you know</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="4.14">if you&amp;#39;re interested go check it out on</text>
  <text start="93.719" dur="5.43">my website but I was working with one my</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="6.359">clients and he said something to the</text>
  <text start="99.149" dur="6.14">same effect that that woman did his was</text>
  <text start="102.389" dur="6.891">a few years ago he was telling me it was</text>
  <text start="105.289" dur="7.811">around the twenty twelve timeframe and</text>
  <text start="109.28" dur="7.6">his co-workers begin to figure out where</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="7.32">his beliefs were and they began to poke</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="5.909">fun at him same kind of concept is that</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.829">woman right we have friends families</text>
  <text start="122.789" dur="4.951">co-workers whatever the case may be when</text>
  <text start="125.249" dur="4.381">they find out where your beliefs lie</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="2.47">because you you know you&amp;#39;re breaking</text>
  <text start="129.63" dur="1.78">away</text>
  <text start="130.21" dur="2.79">from the brain wash and you&amp;#39;re breaking</text>
  <text start="131.41" dur="4.02">away from the mind control and they have</text>
  <text start="133" dur="4.41">yet to do that they&amp;#39;ll start calling you</text>
  <text start="135.43" dur="4.77">crazy and trust me</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="4.98">that shit&amp;#39;s tough I went through the</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="4.29">very same thing four or five years ago</text>
  <text start="142.39" dur="4.8">heck I still go through that stuff now I</text>
  <text start="144.49" dur="4.53">get people calling me crazy all the time</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="4.02">not quite my friends and family anymore</text>
  <text start="149.02" dur="4.59">because they know what I do they know</text>
  <text start="151.21" dur="6.39">who I am but you know strangers say that</text>
  <text start="153.61" dur="5.7"> and it&amp;#39;s not fun it&amp;#39;s not fun it</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="5.85">fun at all so what I wanted to do is</text>
  <text start="159.31" dur="6.69">simply offer you advice on what to do</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="6.33">when people who are close to you who</text>
  <text start="166" dur="7.44">you&amp;#39;ve grown up with start to ostracize</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="7.05">you shun you because they&amp;#39;re finding out</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="5.04">that you question the status quo they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="176.83" dur="4.43">beginning to find out that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="6.36">different and that&amp;#39;s the first point is</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="7.42">understand that in this world it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="4.32">you who are insane it&amp;#39;s the world that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="2.76">crazy</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="4.86">you know I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing a quote here</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="4.29">but wasn&amp;#39;t it Krishnamurti who said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="194.02" dur="6.86">no measure of health to be well adjusted</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="8.16">to a profoundly sick Society right so</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="5.35">people who are calling you crazy for</text>
  <text start="203.89" dur="4.44">just simply questioning connecting the</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="5.01">dots seeing that something ain&amp;#39;t right</text>
  <text start="208.33" dur="6.36">don&amp;#39;t worry about that second piece of</text>
  <text start="211.24" dur="7.44">advice right understand that everybody</text>
  <text start="214.69" dur="5.82">is on their own path this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="5.61">piece of advice that I can offer you</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="6.8">because understanding that everybody is</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="6.69">on their own path you don&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="6.22">attachments to what they believe right</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="3.9">understand that you can&amp;#39;t lead a horse I</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="3.27">mean you can lead a horse to water but</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="3.18">you can&amp;#39;t make them drink it right so</text>
  <text start="236.8" dur="4.83">being that they&amp;#39;re on your own path</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="7.08">you&amp;#39;re on yours it&amp;#39;s a choice that every</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="6.57">single person makes on these paths to</text>
  <text start="245.14" dur="5.58">begin to wake up to begin to see reality</text>
  <text start="248.2" dur="3.84">some people have made that choice early</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="2.85">in life some people might have made it</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="2.82">decades ago some people might have made</text>
  <text start="253.57" dur="3.18">it recently right</text>
  <text start="254.86" dur="4.08">many people are making that choice</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="3.27">recently because of how crazy the world</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="2.4">is getting that they&amp;#39;re beginning to</text>
  <text start="260.02" dur="4.35">scratch their head and</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="4.71">questions but many people still have yet</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="2.97">to make that choice many people are</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="3.03">still ingrained in the brainwashing</text>
  <text start="267.34" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re still ingrained in the mind</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="7.77">control and like it or not that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="273.01" dur="6.51">way it is and that&amp;#39;s okay right like I</text>
  <text start="276.85" dur="6.42">said it&amp;#39;s all a choice you&amp;#39;ve made that</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="6.3">choice so you&amp;#39;re continuing on that path</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="4.77">of evolution right other people that</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="4.319">have yet to make that choice eventually</text>
  <text start="288.04" dur="5.76">they will a lot of people say never</text>
  <text start="290.139" dur="5.131">never say never paradoxically right I</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t like to deal in absolutes</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="7.38">I&amp;#39;m very wary of people who say always</text>
  <text start="297.97" dur="5.97">and never constantly because it&amp;#39;s life</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="3.12">is very black-and-white for them that</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="4.97">they&amp;#39;re not able to mold their beliefs</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="5.97">right if you deal in absolutes</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="4.96">someone might seem like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="3.57">extremely ingrained in the system and</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="4.799">like they will never wake up</text>
  <text start="315.31" dur="5.04">but trust me people will come around so</text>
  <text start="318.669" dur="3.62">what I want to tell you is to keep</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="5.67">speaking your truth</text>
  <text start="322.289" dur="6.1">keep looking crazy if it&amp;#39;s a burning</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="4.26">desire within you to share your truths</text>
  <text start="328.389" dur="4.53">to share what you&amp;#39;re finding about about</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="5.04">the world on Facebook or on social media</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="6.601">or you know whatever the case may be on</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="6.42">videos do it right follow that intuition</text>
  <text start="339.52" dur="4.829">follow that guidance speak the truth we</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="4.89">need more people with courage to begin</text>
  <text start="344.349" dur="5.761">speaking what&amp;#39;s really on their minds</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="6">and to question what&amp;#39;s going on don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="5.4">have any fear in doing that trust me I</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="5.46">did for a long time and it causes a lot</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="4.65">of spiritual tension in you when you</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="4.53">hold back I got to a point where I</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="4.11">couldn&amp;#39;t hold back anymore and look</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s happened since then right I</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="3.66">couldn&amp;#39;t even imagine that all this</text>
  <text start="366.7" dur="3.06">stuff that&amp;#39;s happened in the past few</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="4.14">months would have happened but again</text>
  <text start="369.76" dur="4.71">when you start following your bliss when</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="5.04">you start following that gut instinct in</text>
  <text start="374.47" dur="5.64">you it&amp;#39;ll lead you down paths that you</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="5.58">wouldn&amp;#39;t even imagined and those people</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="5.67">that you thought wouldn&amp;#39;t come around</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="5.699">will eventually come around and the last</text>
  <text start="385.78" dur="4.83">point that I want to make here is that</text>
  <text start="388.389" dur="5.221">when hits the</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="4.589">fan right when things really start</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="2.82">getting crazy as if things aren&amp;#39;t crazy</text>
  <text start="395.199" dur="3.831">enough in this world but when they</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="4.32">really start getting crazy right</text>
  <text start="399.03" dur="4.389">everybody&amp;#39;s going to be searching for</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="5.28">answers everybody that didn&amp;#39;t make that</text>
  <text start="403.419" dur="4.59">choice yet will have to make that choice</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="7.109">sooner or later right when hits the</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="8.16">fan so they know that you are already</text>
  <text start="413.139" dur="4.981">searching they&amp;#39;re gonna just begin on</text>
  <text start="416.169" dur="3.451">that path of awakening and you&amp;#39;re they</text>
  <text start="418.12" dur="5.639">already know that you&amp;#39;re far down that</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="7.319">road so all the people calling you crazy</text>
  <text start="423.759" dur="6.361">now when hits the fan they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="426.939" dur="4.021">to be coming to you for answers so speak</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="4.47">your truths</text>
