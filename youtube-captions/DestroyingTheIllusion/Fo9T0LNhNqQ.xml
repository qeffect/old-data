  <text start="79.38" dur="5.669">sites now a big stick they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="83.28" dur="4.32">use to sway a lot of people to hate</text>
  <text start="85.049" dur="5.341">what&amp;#39;s going on is anger I&amp;#39;ve seen that</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="4.379">one a lot of articles headlines has been</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="4.799">trying to paint Trump as being some</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="5.401">crazy person avoiding investigation</text>
  <text start="95.189" dur="4.561">there&amp;#39;s been a lot of propaganda and</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="4.05">people getting swirled up by all these</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="3.84">ideas that oh you know Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.43" dur="3.81">just trying to avoid his investigations</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="4.65">into his Russia links you know Russia</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="4.8">Russia Russia blame the Russians there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="5.1">that one this was a really ridiculous</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="5.369">one FBI agents this was a headline I</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="4.5">think I saw on CNN but they were saying</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="5.791">that FBI agents were changing their</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="5.79">facebook profile pictures too that they</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="4.26">normally do when a colleague dies but</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;ve been changing it to James Comey</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="3.45">to you know be really sad about new</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="3.87">hablaba it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s like high school</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="4.83">right reading all these mainstream media</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="4.32">corporate media rags it&amp;#39;s just slight</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="3.99">listening to a freaking high schooler</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="5.37">and all of their drama it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="137.73" dur="6.3">ridiculous but that&amp;#39;s a good thing</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;re on the freakin heels so</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="3.63">just keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="6.12">right the more and more I see CNN just</text>
  <text start="147.66" dur="6.6">get more oblivious with their propaganda</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="3.45">I just laugh I laugh inside so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="2.97">cool</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="5.85">next Trump meets with Lavrov he meets</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="6.26">with a Russian Minister and Kissinger</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="7.59">Henry Kissinger himself in his office</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="6.67">right after he fires James Comey if this</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t say you know balls of steel</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="4.08">power play I don&amp;#39;t necessarily know what</text>
  <text start="172.32" dur="3.72">does I would love to hear the</text>
  <text start="174.24" dur="4.41">conversation that occurred between Trump</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="4.17">and Kissinger or those three men right</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="4.92">there that would have been a good one so</text>
  <text start="180.21" dur="6.57">I really think that&amp;#39;s essentially a</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="6.36">giant move by said Earth Alliance where</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="5.25">they knew they couldn&amp;#39;t wait so boom</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="5.64">fire call me right before they meet with</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="8.4">Kissinger and this is a really exciting</text>
  <text start="195.57" dur="9.36">thing to me is trey gowdy being the next</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="7.26">FBI director so there&amp;#39;s been quite a few</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="3.69">articles and rumors circulating that</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="4.86">trey gowdy</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="8.45">is probably the most likely next</text>
  <text start="212.55" dur="4.52">candidate for that FBI director job now</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="6.25">and what&amp;#39;s really interesting is that a</text>
  <text start="220.43" dur="5.26">CNN commentator who&amp;#39;s a registered</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="4.65">Democrat actually tweeted yesterday his</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="3.66">name&amp;#39;s Bakari sellers and you tweeted</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="2.88">the Dems are going to hate me for this</text>
  <text start="229.35" dur="5.07">but I don&amp;#39;t care the best replacement</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="5.39">for Comey is trey Gowdy and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="5.19">getting a lot of lot of support and also</text>
  <text start="236.36" dur="5.41">no comment his staff knows there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="4.89">of rumors and there&amp;#39;s been no comment</text>
  <text start="241.77" dur="5.97">from him or his staff about his desire</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="4.68">to be here so I think since there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="247.74" dur="2.97">comment with those all these rumors</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="3.45">circulating I think that that is the</text>
  <text start="250.71" dur="4.38">next move I think this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;ve been planning and that&amp;#39;d be my</text>
  <text start="255.09" dur="3.63">bet my bet would be him being the next</text>
  <text start="257.04" dur="3.69">FBI director so hopefully that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="4.26">take long and the reason hope that</text>
  <text start="260.73" dur="4.23">hopefully it does not take long is that</text>
  <text start="262.98" dur="3.21">I&amp;#39;m not sure how long you might have</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="4.79">been following my channel here</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="7.05">but I&amp;#39;ve been covering his efforts</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="5.62">spearheading anti Child Exploitation</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="3.63">anti pedophilia and anti-human</text>
  <text start="275.37" dur="3.51">trafficking legislation through the</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="2.67">house judiciary committee committee for</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="6.57">weeks now</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="8.49">he&amp;#39;s definitely anti anti deep state so</text>
  <text start="285.45" dur="5.39">that&amp;#39;s a good thing and Comey fought</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="7.92">getting fired now frees up the FBI</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="8.17">because a Assange Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="5.25">actually tweeted the FBI is now gonna</text>
  <text start="299.01" dur="4.56">start leaking night Niagra so now that</text>
  <text start="301.2" dur="6.06">the bureaucratic nonsense is out of</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="6.63">there the grassroots of the FBI they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.26" dur="4.23">gonna be much more likely to tell tell</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="3.06">what&amp;#39;s going on - not only blow the</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="5.13">whistle to the public but to share more</text>
  <text start="313.26" dur="5.13">information within the agency itself or</text>
  <text start="316.62" dur="4.59">even between different three-letter</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="5.58">agencies and what I mean by that is that</text>
  <text start="321.21" dur="4.77">I googled I went onto Google News this</text>
  <text start="323.97" dur="5.49">morning and I simply typed in human</text>
  <text start="325.98" dur="5.67">trafficking arrests and coincidentally</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="4.68">just the past day or two there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="3.48">lot of local bus around the country of</text>
  <text start="334.14" dur="3.24">course these bus don&amp;#39;t make it in the</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="4.83">mainstream media but into local outlets</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="3.93">they normally do there was 20 people</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="3.6">just arrested in my home state of</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="4.92">Washington here yesterday there was an</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="4.41">ex judge in Kentucky arrested just</text>
  <text start="346.23" dur="4.59">yesterday in regards to human</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="4.74">trafficking so that the frees up frees</text>
  <text start="350.82" dur="4.47">up the FBI frees up the manpower and it</text>
  <text start="352.71" dur="5.43">frees up the information that gets</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="6.69">around and then also there was an FBI</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="5.34">raid just yesterday at a GOP fundraising</text>
  <text start="361.98" dur="3.66">firm in Annapolis Maryland</text>
  <text start="363.48" dur="5.55">now I don&amp;#39;t know how much this might be</text>
  <text start="365.64" dur="5.73">connected to Comey being fired but again</text>
  <text start="369.03" dur="4.62">freeing up the FBI and this is not when</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="5.549">it says GOP firm this is not a Democrat</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="5.76">versus Republican thing this is a sickos</text>
  <text start="376.919" dur="5.281">in the government versus not sickos in</text>
  <text start="379.41" dur="4.41">the government thing so that&amp;#39;s big news</text>
  <text start="382.2" dur="4.5">a lot of human traffickers get arrested</text>
  <text start="383.82" dur="7.47">big news and if he gets in as the FBI</text>
  <text start="386.7" dur="5.969">director man I bet the bushes and I mean</text>
  <text start="391.29" dur="4.2">George Bush again is he still in</text>
  <text start="392.669" dur="4.291">hospital wonder why I wonder where he</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="2.91">might be I wonder where Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="396.96" dur="2.55">is right now cuz I tell you what both of</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="3.75">their buttholes are real</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="5.43">herd up thinking of him being the next</text>
  <text start="402.15" dur="4.92">that so that&amp;#39;s everything those are all</text>
  <text start="404.94" dur="4.56">of my thoughts going on around really</text>
  <text start="407.07" dur="3.9">this James Comey situation a lot of</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="3.45">people are scared of it or like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="410.97" dur="2.37">again what&amp;#39;s going on but it&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="412.95" dur="1.56">thing</text>
  <text start="413.34" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;m very freaking happy it happened</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="7.17">about time right so there&amp;#39;s that in the</text>
  <text start="418.44" dur="6.15">next li there is science disclosures now</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s a lot I just kind of perused you</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="5.4">know those mainstream media outlets as I</text>
  <text start="426.39" dur="5.91">normally do and past couple days man</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="3.9">they are really throwing some stuff out</text>
  <text start="432.3" dur="3.09">there they&amp;#39;re literally they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="3.33">for rewrite all of these science</text>
  <text start="435.39" dur="3.36">textbooks like every week the way</text>
  <text start="437.22" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re just throwing info out</text>
  <text start="438.75" dur="5.73">apparently there&amp;#39;s been new landforms</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="5.1">discovered under Antarctica and this is</text>
  <text start="444.48" dur="3.9">a really interesting one we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="446.91" dur="6.81">seen anything like it</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="7.68">the they say and apparently some</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="7.89">scientific expeditions below the ice</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="7.83">shelf found land but again mainstream</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="4.47">media and mainstream science are about</text>
  <text start="463.89" dur="4.38">five hundred years behind because I just</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="3.36">discussed this in my Antarctica video</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="6.51">that I uploaded a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="8.49">something called the pari REE mat the</text>
  <text start="474.78" dur="5.01">prairie map was dated to about 1513 and</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="4.95">it actually showed Antarctica with no</text>
  <text start="479.79" dur="5.61">ice on it and land masses underneath so</text>
  <text start="482.88" dur="5.07">again they&amp;#39;re just trying to like these</text>
  <text start="485.4" dur="5.04">powers that be knowing that their time</text>
  <text start="487.95" dur="4.44">is short this guy and probably that guy</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re just trying to throw as much</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="3.51">science out there as they can as much of</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="3.75">the secrets I should say not science but</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="8.1">secrets they&amp;#39;ve hidden out there as they</text>
  <text start="497.73" dur="8.67">can to save their ass but new radio</text>
  <text start="504" dur="5.22">bursts this was an interesting one I</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="4.41">found this one in a lot of lot of</text>
  <text start="509.22" dur="3.379">websites this was on futurism and</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="5.76">Gizmodo and a lot of kind of mainstream</text>
  <text start="512.599" dur="5.861">publications but there is a new fast</text>
  <text start="516.57" dur="3.93">radio bursts that they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="518.46" dur="5.16">trying to decipher is it alien where</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="4.71">does it come from Yoda Yoda so you know</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="7.44">more prepping more seeding of our</text>
  <text start="525.21" dur="7.38">consciousness more more outs that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="2.28">that&amp;#39;s a point I&amp;#39;ve been making recently</text>
  <text start="532.59" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="2.94">out so one of the reason they throw</text>
  <text start="535.26" dur="3.03">these articles out in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="536.28" dur="5.79">media because if they needed a story to</text>
  <text start="538.29" dur="5.76">run with to try some like BS half-assed</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="3.84">disclosure to the public to distract</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="3.63">from any like mass arrests scenarios or</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="5.94">big stuff that goes on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="547.68" dur="6.42">they can do that so more yeah more outs</text>
  <text start="551.85" dur="4.86">more soft disclosures more seating of</text>
  <text start="554.1" dur="4.92">our consciousness and also another point</text>
  <text start="556.71" dur="4.14">that I want to make here with this</text>
  <text start="559.02" dur="7.77">article that I&amp;#39;ve also made lately is</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="7.89">that don&amp;#39;t be so cynical about the</text>
  <text start="566.79" dur="3.6">mainstream media as well right so again</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="2.97">the mark of an educated mind is to</text>
  <text start="570.39" dur="4.47">entertain a thought without accepting it</text>
  <text start="571.71" dur="5.61">when I read CNN or Huffington Post or</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="5.16">Washington Post I just because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="577.32" dur="5.52">corporate rag I&amp;#39;m not gonna dissuade all</text>
  <text start="580.02" dur="4.29">the information they they put out I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="582.84" dur="3.96">not just like oh this sucks this sucks</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="4.56">this sucks just because they reported it</text>
  <text start="586.8" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m gonna look at it I&amp;#39;m gonna see where</text>
  <text start="588.87" dur="3.72">there might be truth where there might</text>
  <text start="590.19" dur="4.17">be the information or misinformation or</text>
  <text start="592.59" dur="4.44">disinformation and you discern it all</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="4.32">right I&amp;#39;m gonna do a video on proper</text>
  <text start="597.03" dur="3.9">discernment and information processing</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="5.07">soon because it&amp;#39;s we need to really</text>
  <text start="600.93" dur="4.53">learn how to think not what to think and</text>

  <text start="651.21" dur="4.92">stuff out this was an interesting one</text>
  <text start="653.19" dur="5.61">because it said it was discussing LSD</text>
  <text start="656.13" dur="6.63">and it was discussing LSD in a very</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="6.39">mature way not a degrading way and it</text>
  <text start="662.76" dur="3.78">was discussing how LSD has lately been</text>

  <text start="666.54" dur="3.75">increase the consciousness of people</text>
  <text start="667.71" dur="3.93">taking it but then what this in the</text>

  <text start="680.82" dur="7.44">yesterday and also just yesterday there</text>
  <text start="684.99" dur="6.09">was a article on futurism about</text>

  <text start="695.07" dur="5.49">artificial intelligence and synthetic</text>
  <text start="697.53" dur="5.01">biology and it&amp;#39;s been a good thing so</text>
