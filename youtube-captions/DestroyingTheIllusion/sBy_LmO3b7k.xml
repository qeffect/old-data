  <text start="14.16" dur="2.99">office</text>
  <text start="14.79" dur="4.92">every coffee shop I go to is my office</text>
  <text start="17.15" dur="4.03">anyway in this update I felt like I</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="4.38">needed to get it out pretty urgently</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="5.31">because this is a pretty much a breaking</text>
  <text start="24.09" dur="4.05">story but I wanted to throw some</text>
  <text start="26.49" dur="3.18">discernment out there for you guys and</text>
  <text start="28.14" dur="4.079">some level-headedness and clear thinking</text>
  <text start="29.67" dur="4.47">so I was sent this article by disclosed</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="4.261">dot TV that just came out today and the</text>
  <text start="34.14" dur="5.7">title of this article is human Martian</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="4.8">facilities exposed by Google Mars okay</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="5">I&amp;#39;m gonna put up some screenshots of it</text>
  <text start="41.28" dur="6.36">and apparently on this article we have</text>
  <text start="44.84" dur="4.36">Google Mars right it&amp;#39;s the Google Earth</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="5.939">component on Mars</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="6.57">literally unveiled this strip of much</text>
  <text start="53.579" dur="4.53">clearer picture than normal then the</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="4.49">surrounding pictures of it and it looks</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="5.25">like you know we have some solar panels</text>
  <text start="60.26" dur="7.42">six or seven buildings we even have a</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="6.451">satellite antenna on it so you know who</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="4.049">knows what this could be who knows why</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="4.14">this was thrown out there and in the</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="3.841">article on disclosed TV it goes to say</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="3.72">Mars shows off High Definition</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="4.439">photographs of supposed human</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="5.4">installations on Mars and then in this</text>
  <text start="80.009" dur="6.661">article it says is Google or NASA making</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="5.52">fun of us they&amp;#39;d better confess now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="3.449">gonna take you through some screenshots</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="3.239">and some pictures you can actually look</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="3.271">through because on the google mark</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="4.11">moogle mars component of it it actually</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="5.729">has pictures inside this facility it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="7.11">crazy but I wanted to tell you first</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="7.201">that we know humans have been on Mars it</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="6.661">is no stretch of the imagination at all</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="6.42">to think that right we have Randy Cramer</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="5.04">or Captain K who says he&amp;#39;s been on Mars</text>
  <text start="112.74" dur="4.26">we have William Tompkins tell us that</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="4.86">you know humans were on Mars as early as</text>
  <text start="117" dur="4.68">the Nazis in fact the Nazis sent one of</text>
  <text start="119.61" dur="4.259">their first expeditions up to Mars and I</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="4.619">believe the 40s or the 50s and they lost</text>
  <text start="123.869" dur="4.2">a few men up there as part of you know</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s testimony that William Tompkins has</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="4.261">told us himself and then we&amp;#39;ve had Corey</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="3.391">Goode tell us that humans have already</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.919">been on Mars and then</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="5.529">you think for instance about the</text>
  <text start="137.249" dur="4.181">technology that we know that we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="139.209" dur="3.87">since the 1930s and 40s the</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="4.83">electrochromatic technology so we if</text>
  <text start="143.079" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;ve had that for 80 years and the</text>
  <text start="146.26" dur="3.75">powers that be have built that out to</text>
  <text start="148.209" dur="5.461">the tune of tens of trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="6.72">if not more we know they&amp;#39;re on Mars easy</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="5.939">to say but so that leads us into this</text>
  <text start="156.73" dur="5.159">question right why is this shown on</text>
  <text start="159.609" dur="5.55">Google Mars why are these pictures out</text>
  <text start="161.889" dur="5.401">in the public domain I want to take you</text>
  <text start="165.159" dur="3.66">through some of these pictures put up</text>
  <text start="167.29" dur="3.72">some screenshots of them to maybe give</text>
  <text start="168.819" dur="8.551">you a clearer picture as to why right</text>
  <text start="171.01" dur="8.099">here&amp;#39;s the a zoomed out picture on the</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="3.329">Mars and then you know of course the one</text>
  <text start="179.109" dur="5.401">I showed you we zoom in and you can see</text>
  <text start="180.699" dur="6.54">the facility we have the solar panels</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="4.11">and the buildings you know allegedly on</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="2.43">Mars surface but now I want to take you</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="3.329">inside let&amp;#39;s look at some pictures</text>
  <text start="189.669" dur="4.5">inside this place the first one you it</text>
  <text start="191.949" dur="4.171">takes you to is this right here which is</text>
  <text start="194.169" dur="5.19">really interesting because we have what</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="5.28">looks to be six seven eight scientists</text>
  <text start="199.359" dur="4.5">all around this you know supposed to</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="5.759">training station and you even have your</text>
  <text start="203.859" dur="5.361">traffic cones right some traffic cones</text>
  <text start="207.159" dur="5.22">and some netting and it looks very</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="5.289">rudimentary it looks just like some back</text>
  <text start="212.379" dur="3.51">office warehouse that a couple white lab</text>
  <text start="214.509" dur="3.9">coats are standing there in and then we</text>
  <text start="215.889" dur="4.951">see it says up here in the top left-hand</text>
  <text start="218.409" dur="4.741">corner it says to march 2017 so these</text>
  <text start="220.84" dur="6.079">pictures were taken very recently by</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="7.109">Google next I&amp;#39;m gonna take you to a</text>
  <text start="226.919" dur="4.66">picture that I found of inside more of</text>
  <text start="230.259" dur="3.781">the office looking space we can see a</text>
  <text start="231.579" dur="5.58">guy here on his computer apparently on</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="6.21">Mars they have Wi-Fi you know and it</text>
  <text start="237.159" dur="5.61">says Google foothills now as you can see</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.799">you know by by the way I&amp;#39;m speaking</text>
  <text start="242.769" dur="5.011">about these pictures it looks like a</text>
  <text start="245.049" dur="4.59">hoax to be honest it looks like complete</text>
  <text start="247.78" dur="4.53">disinformation you know we have</text>
  <text start="249.639" dur="4.5">shuffleboard and a loveSac google</text>
  <text start="252.31" dur="3.359">foothills you know you can look into</text>
  <text start="254.139" dur="3">what foothills might mean I&amp;#39;m not too</text>
  <text start="255.669" dur="3.211">familiar with Google but maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.139" dur="3.06">just an American facility they have they</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="2.819">took pictures of the inside and there</text>
  <text start="260.199" dur="4.051">maybe they are right maybe they are</text>
  <text start="261.699" dur="4.801">making fun of us or something to that</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="3.18">effect and now I want to take you to the</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="2.82">kitchen area because</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="4.47">kitchen area in that you can go check</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="5.04">out and first and foremost right there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="4.35">the shuffleboard but we get into the</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="4.17">food that they have check this out they</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="6.479">got bags of chips they got what looks</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="5.97">like you know bags and stuff I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="2.881">exactly see the brand I wish I could see</text>
  <text start="284.5" dur="2.25">the brand in this picture but I would</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="5.07">take you to another picture here and</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="5.91">this is the literally the fridge and it</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="4.62">says visit Mars right they have these</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="3.75">Mars photos plastered everywhere but</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="3.03">then you can see the brains in this</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="5.4">picture they got soda pop they got</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="6.24">literally Powerade zero some vitamin</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="6.09">water they have some soda pot some</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="4.65">orange juice there and the you know what</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="4.47">I want to say is the reason I can tell</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="4.59">this is a complete hoax or I should say</text>
  <text start="312.37" dur="3.51">this isn&amp;#39;t actually a facility on Mars</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="3.72">is because they don&amp;#39;t have Powerade zero</text>
  <text start="315.88" dur="3.719">there how the heck are they gonna import</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="4.35">that all the people that tell us about</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="4.021">the facility on Mars tell us that they</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="5.49">already have D materializes where they</text>
  <text start="323.62" dur="4.95">can just materialize food in right in</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="3.389">front of you right and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="4.349">technology that the secret space program</text>
  <text start="330.759" dur="3.811">these black projects already have so</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re not gonna have actual food on</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="4.83">Mars okay and the point of this video</text>
  <text start="337.69" dur="4.17">the point I wanted to make is that when</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="4.049">you see a grand story because when this</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="3.029">was first sent to me I got you know I</text>
  <text start="343.449" dur="3.9">got super excited I&amp;#39;m like wait are you</text>
  <text start="344.889" dur="4.171">for real like what is this and then I</text>
  <text start="347.349" dur="3.511">started searching around I start</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="5.099">checking out these pictures I&amp;#39;m like no</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="8.01">this is this is fake this isn&amp;#39;t real</text>
  <text start="354.159" dur="6.54">right and you can tell that it is just</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="5.34">some American facility that they made to</text>
  <text start="360.699" dur="6.09">look like Mars so this is a this is a</text>
  <text start="364.21" dur="5.699">lesson in discernment okay any time you</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="5.011">get a story that is you know either</text>
  <text start="369.909" dur="5.701">sounds too good to be true or it sounds</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="5.31">way far out there do more research click</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="3.63">around see if there&amp;#39;s any supportive</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="3.6">links see what else you can find because</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="2.82">I guarantee you there would be more</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="3.9">information that will be helpful to you</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="5.82">in making up your mind okay but now I</text>
  <text start="384.61" dur="5.67">want to get into why right why because</text>
  <text start="387.88" dur="7.08">this is obviously on Google Mars itself</text>
  <text start="390.28" dur="6.54">I mean this is a very this is not a fake</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="3.329">picture per se these aren&amp;#39;t real Mars</text>
  <text start="396.82" dur="5.849">installations but they&amp;#39;re put on Google</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="7.44">Mars why well they could be towing what</text>
  <text start="402.669" dur="5.4">in my opinion actually it&amp;#39;s a part of a</text>
  <text start="405.729" dur="4.98">partial disclosure thing I think what</text>
  <text start="408.069" dur="4.83">they want is people to see these and get</text>
  <text start="410.709" dur="6.93">the idea of humans already being on Mars</text>
  <text start="412.899" dur="6.57">without disclosing a the way the the way</text>
  <text start="417.639" dur="3.33">the bases really look up there and be</text>
  <text start="419.469" dur="3.09">without disclosing into the real</text>
  <text start="420.969" dur="3.21">technology because remember if we took</text>
  <text start="422.559" dur="3.81">around a look at one of those real</text>
  <text start="424.179" dur="4.64">installations they wouldn&amp;#39;t have any of</text>
  <text start="426.369" dur="4.711">this stuff so in my opinion this is</text>
  <text start="428.819" dur="4.84">probably some type of partial disclosure</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="4.769">thing or something just some SIOP thrown</text>
  <text start="433.659" dur="3.96">out there to muddy the waters but again</text>
  <text start="435.849" dur="5.49">be very careful with what you choose to</text>
  <text start="437.619" dur="5.4">believe I obviously as you can tell</text>
  <text start="441.339" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t believe this to be a real Martian</text>
  <text start="443.019" dur="6.45">facility but I do believe this to be put</text>
  <text start="446.379" dur="5.58">out very precisely very very</text>
  <text start="449.469" dur="4.92">specifically in a kind of partial</text>
  <text start="451.959" dur="4.32">disclosure seeding of our consciousness</text>
  <text start="454.389" dur="3.54">so anyway that&amp;#39;s what I want to throw</text>
  <text start="456.279" dur="3.12">out there about this article check it</text>
  <text start="457.929" dur="3.42">out you know look around the pictures</text>
  <text start="459.399" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="461.349" dur="4.22">think this is on Mars obviously and I</text>
  <text start="463.659" dur="4.11">think this is just put out there as a</text>
  <text start="465.569" dur="4.78">specific way to seed our consciousness</text>
  <text start="467.769" dur="5.1">with Stephon ain&amp;#39;t real right so anyway</text>
  <text start="470.349" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s all for now folks I&amp;#39;m gonna get</text>
  <text start="472.869" dur="2.81">back to it</text>
  <text start="473.469" dur="2.21">peace</text>
