  <text start="194.5" dur="3.06">trying to build and a lot more</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="4.65">information but I&amp;#39;m trying to get out</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="4.14">into the public speaking of which you</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="4.17">know not just multiple YouTube channels</text>

  <text start="224.56" dur="4.65">gonna be a little more happy a little</text>
  <text start="227.17" dur="4.8">more spiritual and uplifting than the</text>
  <text start="229.21" dur="5.01">deep depths that above majestic went</text>
  <text start="231.97" dur="3.72">into which is necessary but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="3.06">go the opposite of the opposite end of</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="3.9">the spectrum with this one that will be</text>
  <text start="237.28" dur="6.09">out in October so most definitely</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;ll be later this year and then of</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="5.52">course we&amp;#39;ve just got other projects</text>

  <text start="614.82" dur="6.27">of it let&amp;#39;s talk about that moon landing</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="6.39">now of course when it comes to the moon</text>
  <text start="621.09" dur="6.18">landing there is so much God what do we</text>
  <text start="625.56" dur="3.69">want to call it intelligence</text>
  <text start="627.27" dur="4.59">counterintelligence information</text>
  <text start="629.25" dur="3.99">disinformation out there about the moon</text>
  <text start="631.86" dur="1.83">landing of course you often hear it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="2.73">fake</text>
  <text start="633.69" dur="5.88">they never landed on the moon it&amp;#39;s fake</text>
  <text start="635.97" dur="6.75">etc etc but let me pause it you this all</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="5.04">right what if they did land on the moon</text>
  <text start="642.72" dur="5.01">the Apollo astronauts did set foot on</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="4.86">the moon millions miles away or however</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="3.63">far away it is what if they did land</text>
  <text start="649.47" dur="5.16">there but some of the videos that have</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="5.28">been put out into the public are fake ok</text>
  <text start="654.63" dur="5.21">again it&amp;#39;s not black and white world</text>
  <text start="656.64" dur="5.04">these sort of things they are layered so</text>
  <text start="659.84" dur="3.64">just because they landed on the moon</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="4.26">doesn&amp;#39;t mean there&amp;#39;s not a bunch of fake</text>
  <text start="663.48" dur="3.84">disinformation stuff out there just to</text>
  <text start="665.94" dur="5.069">muddy the waters just to get</text>
  <text start="667.32" dur="5.43">people off the signal the actual signal</text>
  <text start="671.009" dur="3.57">put a lot of noise out there so people</text>
  <text start="672.75" dur="3.449">won&amp;#39;t be able to tell the signal I put a</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="4.56">bunch of fluff out there so people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="676.199" dur="5.58">hone in on what the truth is now what I</text>
  <text start="679.139" dur="4.981">think personally what happened with the</text>
  <text start="681.779" dur="3.841">moon-landing is that yes they got there</text>
  <text start="684.12" dur="2.969">they got through the Van Allen belts</text>
  <text start="685.62" dur="2.67">that&amp;#39;s a question only no a lot of</text>
  <text start="687.089" dur="3.291">people&amp;#39;s heads and quite frankly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.29" dur="5.609">ridiculous to me the Van Allen belts are</text>
  <text start="690.38" dur="4.99">you know those electromagnetic radiation</text>
  <text start="693.899" dur="4.17">bands outside our earth that people say</text>
  <text start="695.37" dur="4.82">oh they can&amp;#39;t pass through but they wax</text>
  <text start="698.069" dur="4.32">and wane are basically the radiation</text>
  <text start="700.19" dur="4">guitar and gets weaker through those</text>
  <text start="702.389" dur="2.851">belts so yes people can pass through you</text>
  <text start="704.19" dur="3.24">can get instruments through there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="705.24" dur="4.829">technologies where you can protect</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="4.529">devices as we go through it so yeah</text>
  <text start="710.069" dur="5.431">there&amp;#39;s just a lot of you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="711.959" dur="4.981">lot of false rabbit holes like dead end</text>
  <text start="715.5" dur="3.63">rabbit holes that they purposely put out</text>
  <text start="716.94" dur="3.69">there to lead you down each one but yeah</text>
  <text start="719.13" dur="5.97">as they go through the Van Allen belts</text>
  <text start="720.63" dur="8.12">and got there but what I think happened</text>
  <text start="725.1" dur="7.08">is that the astronauts likely saw stuff</text>
  <text start="728.75" dur="7.06">whether it was installations facility</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="7.11">structures on the moon there would you</text>
  <text start="735.81" dur="6.389">doubt that and also where their craft</text>
  <text start="739.29" dur="4.95">they saw look into the testimony of</text>
  <text start="742.199" dur="6">William Tompkins okay</text>
  <text start="744.24" dur="7.11">William Tompkins he has passed away</text>
  <text start="748.199" dur="5.13">about two years ago now but nevertheless</text>
  <text start="751.35" dur="4.83">he came out towards the end of his life</text>
  <text start="753.329" dur="5.971">he passed away at the age of 94 95 very</text>
  <text start="756.18" dur="4.32">old guy but bless his heart amazing</text>
  <text start="759.3" dur="3.839">individual came out towards the end of</text>
  <text start="760.5" dur="5.67">his life just to tell his story just</text>
  <text start="763.139" dur="5.01">because he thought the world needed to</text>
  <text start="766.17" dur="4.109">know what does he have to lose he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="768.149" dur="4.971">involved in some just incredible stuff</text>
  <text start="770.279" dur="5.55">that he has eyewitness testimony of and</text>
  <text start="773.12" dur="4.06">check it out I was the last person I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="775.829" dur="2.791">very honored the last person to ever</text>
  <text start="777.18" dur="2.959">interview William Tompkins he did some</text>
  <text start="778.62" dur="4.44">other interviews out there as well</text>
  <text start="780.139" dur="4.93">you can YouTube them and they&amp;#39;re great</text>
  <text start="783.06" dur="5.91">he witnessed the battle of Los Angeles</text>
  <text start="785.069" dur="7.351">event not the movie but in 1942 there</text>
  <text start="788.97" dur="4.89">was large craft large craft scene over</text>
  <text start="792.42" dur="2.969">in Long Beach Harbor there in Southern</text>
  <text start="793.86" dur="5.94">California he was an eyewitness to that</text>
  <text start="795.389" dur="5.241">okay so he&amp;#39;s got great information about</text>
  <text start="799.8" dur="3.32">that he was saying</text>
  <text start="800.63" dur="4.32">great things about what he went through</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="3.33">I mean he was working in a naval</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="4.86">intelligence program during World War</text>
  <text start="806.45" dur="5.37">two debriefing Navy spies that were</text>
  <text start="809.81" dur="3.87">embedded in German secret space</text>
  <text start="811.82" dur="4.62">aerospace program secret space programs</text>
  <text start="813.68" dur="4.5">during World War two William Tompkins</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="3.81">ins in San Diego debriefing I believe</text>
  <text start="818.18" dur="4.83">about 29 spies weren&amp;#39;t on this program</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s what Thompkins said German are</text>
  <text start="823.01" dur="3.6">excuse me Navy spies that were over in</text>
  <text start="825.02" dur="4.11">German secret aerospace programs he did</text>
  <text start="826.61" dur="3.69">that for like four or five years and</text>
  <text start="829.13" dur="3.39">after that he went on to work for</text>
  <text start="830.3" dur="5.93">Douglas Aircraft in the 50s and early</text>
  <text start="832.52" dur="6.42">60s in a secret think tank there and</text>
  <text start="836.23" dur="4.66">designed spacecraft for the Navy</text>
  <text start="838.94" dur="3.66">electromagnetic propulsion spacecraft</text>
  <text start="840.89" dur="4.83">for the Navy basically what I believe is</text>
  <text start="842.6" dur="4.71">probably the early early thoughts early</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="5.39">ideas that went into the solar warden</text>
  <text start="847.31" dur="5.94">program it&amp;#39;s been said the Navy</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="5.35">classified program the Navy installed</text>
  <text start="853.25" dur="6.66">and the 80s or so so again it&amp;#39;s goes</text>
  <text start="856.46" dur="5.82">deep man this goes deep you got to spend</text>
  <text start="859.91" dur="4.29">really years researching all aspects of</text>
  <text start="862.28" dur="5.7">this stuff to get down to the core of it</text>
  <text start="864.2" dur="6.92">I&amp;#39;m like sweating here but William</text>
  <text start="867.98" dur="6.09">Tompkins yes yes and he said that he I</text>
  <text start="871.12" dur="5.62">believe he witnessed the live feed of</text>
  <text start="874.07" dur="4.05">the Apollo moon landing there when it</text>
  <text start="876.74" dur="2.91">was happening I can&amp;#39;t remember what</text>
  <text start="878.12" dur="3.45">contractor he was working for that time</text>
  <text start="879.65" dur="4.76">he spent about a decade with Douglas</text>
  <text start="881.57" dur="8.43">Note to work for some other contractors</text>
  <text start="884.41" dur="7.03">TRW is one maybe some others but he drew</text>
  <text start="890" dur="3.63">some pictures it&amp;#39;s in his book his books</text>
  <text start="891.44" dur="5.79">called selected by extraterrestrials you</text>
  <text start="893.63" dur="5.97">can find it out there right now amazing</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="4.05">read but you can also look at one of dr.</text>
  <text start="899.6" dur="3.78">Michael Salas books he wrote a book on</text>
  <text start="901.28" dur="4.89">William Tompkins that gives a lot of</text>
  <text start="903.38" dur="5.01">backstory and is very articulate well</text>
  <text start="906.17" dur="4.41">done I believe that&amp;#39;s the second book in</text>
  <text start="908.39" dur="4.38">his secret space program series maybe</text>
  <text start="910.58" dur="6.57">it&amp;#39;s the first one second one second one</text>
  <text start="912.77" dur="6.54">anyway William Tompkins said he saw the</text>
  <text start="917.15" dur="4.56">live feed of the Apollo moon landing the</text>
  <text start="919.31" dur="5.21">NASA moon landing it went down and he</text>
  <text start="921.71" dur="4.68">said that in the live feed there were</text>
  <text start="924.52" dur="6.13">objects that met them there in the</text>
  <text start="926.39" dur="5.76">crater and basically warned signaled to</text>
  <text start="930.65" dur="3.64">the astronauts like okay take your</text>
  <text start="932.15" dur="5.439">photos pick up your rocks</text>
  <text start="934.29" dur="5.639">but get out of here don&amp;#39;t come back why</text>
  <text start="937.589" dur="5.6">haven&amp;#39;t we been back to the moon in 50</text>
  <text start="939.929" dur="6.06">years 45 years okay</text>
  <text start="943.189" dur="4.69">well it&amp;#39;s not because we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="945.989" dur="4.79">technology the technology absolutely</text>
  <text start="947.879" dur="5.61">exists I&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a sec</text>
  <text start="950.779" dur="5.68">it&amp;#39;s not that they can&amp;#39;t do it it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="953.489" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s no money it&amp;#39;s that there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="956.459" dur="2.55">of stuff there they want to keep secret</text>
  <text start="957.809" dur="4.47">they just they don&amp;#39;t want to send humans</text>
  <text start="959.009" dur="7.11">back and at least publicly publicly</text>
  <text start="962.279" dur="5.64">until now but we&amp;#39;ve got different powers</text>
  <text start="966.119" dur="4.981">and control than used to be in control</text>
  <text start="967.919" dur="5.37">so I think that&amp;#39;s what happened with</text>
  <text start="971.1" dur="3.689">Apollo I think they really got there but</text>
  <text start="973.289" dur="2.82">there was stuff there that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="974.789" dur="4.32">want to share with the public so you</text>
  <text start="976.109" dur="4.861">know that&amp;#39;s why what it said the Apollo</text>
  <text start="979.109" dur="3.21">astronauts when they landed they talked</text>
  <text start="980.97" dur="3.449">in some code or something like that and</text>
  <text start="982.319" dur="5.341">they switched to a secure comm link yeah</text>
  <text start="984.419" dur="4.65">I I think that is a true as well and</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="4.469">then of course what were they saying on</text>
  <text start="989.069" dur="4.401">that secure comm link so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="992.129" dur="3.96">happened with Apollo but nevertheless</text>
  <text start="993.47" dur="5.349">now let&amp;#39;s talk about the difference</text>
  <text start="996.089" dur="6.78">between public and private space okay</text>
  <text start="998.819" dur="5.97">this is a huge part people miss when</text>
  <text start="1002.869" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re thinking about space programs</text>
  <text start="1004.789" dur="3.45">and secret space programs etc etc</text>
  <text start="1006.23" dur="3.479">there&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re told in the public</text>
  <text start="1008.239" dur="3.72">the public domain if you&amp;#39;re gonna bike</text>
  <text start="1009.709" dur="5.13">use drops you know and in there what</text>
  <text start="1011.959" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;re not told about okay public space</text>
  <text start="1014.839" dur="6.36">was NASA for decades and then more</text>
  <text start="1018.559" dur="5">recently it&amp;#39;s turned into SpaceX and</text>
  <text start="1021.199" dur="5.6">whatever that Jeff Bezos is doing and</text>
  <text start="1023.559" dur="5.791">you know etc etc so that&amp;#39;s all public</text>
  <text start="1026.799" dur="4.78">some private company some federal</text>
  <text start="1029.35" dur="3.699">organizations but its public tour</text>
  <text start="1031.579" dur="3.45">publicly told it&amp;#39;s what they let out</text>
  <text start="1033.049" dur="4.53">into the media and the education</text>
  <text start="1035.029" dur="4.92">institutions okay what do they not let</text>
  <text start="1037.579" dur="5.161">out that&amp;#39;s a different question that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1039.949" dur="5.43">been the subject of inquiry for years</text>
  <text start="1042.74" dur="4.439">decades by many people many books you</text>
  <text start="1045.379" dur="3.3">know there&amp;#39;s so much open source</text>
  <text start="1047.179" dur="5.61">publicly available information you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1048.679" dur="9.87">need any sort of insider or channeling</text>
  <text start="1052.789" dur="7.561">or what contact to or classified</text>
  <text start="1058.549" dur="4.411">briefing to gather this stuff it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1060.35" dur="4.799">it&amp;#39;s a lot of it&amp;#39;s open source okay you</text>
  <text start="1062.96" dur="3.449">can figure out at least not exactly</text>
  <text start="1065.149" dur="2.051">what&amp;#39;s going on but at least a decent</text>
  <text start="1066.409" dur="3.061">picture</text>
  <text start="1067.2" dur="6.719">of what&amp;#39;s going on out there in space</text>
  <text start="1069.47" dur="6.76">just on your own accord but that gets me</text>
  <text start="1073.919" dur="4.08">back into okay private public over here</text>

  <text start="1447.61" dur="4.02">private space in public space and I gave</text>
  <text start="1450.01" dur="4.2">you guys a lot of key words a lot of</text>
  <text start="1451.63" dur="6.42">names you can go research I mean truly</text>
  <text start="1454.21" dur="5.43">when you look at the last hundred years</text>
  <text start="1458.05" dur="4.5">I mean are the last hundred years of</text>
  <text start="1459.64" dur="5.64">history is so important to understand</text>

  <text start="1500.12" dur="5.94">you understand the Rockefeller control</text>
  <text start="1503.6" dur="3.87">in the early 1900s how the Rockefellers</text>

  <text start="3007.63" dur="7.56">the question that that anon posted to Q</text>
  <text start="3010.15" dur="8.04">whoever that anon was weather theory in</text>
  <text start="3015.19" dur="4.17">my head Q baited themselves I think you</text>
  <text start="3018.19" dur="2.34">might bait themselves with questions</text>
  <text start="3019.36" dur="3.6">sometimes just because they want to get</text>
  <text start="3020.53" dur="4.65">things out into the public on that day</text>
  <text start="3022.96" dur="4.89">at that time whoever asks those</text>
  <text start="3025.18" dur="2.94">questions ask them in a very peculiar</text>
  <text start="3027.85" dur="2.07">way</text>
  <text start="3028.12" dur="3.72">are there secret space programs is this</text>
  <text start="3029.92" dur="6.09">why the space force was created Q says</text>

  <text start="3045.4" dur="4.89">have any insider connections I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="3047.08" dur="5.7">trying to call it remote viewing what</text>
  <text start="3050.29" dur="4.71">the heck&amp;#39;s going on on our planet I</text>
  <text start="3052.78" dur="4.77">think that you know there was the</text>
  <text start="3055" dur="5.58">Pentagon audit very first time last year</text>
  <text start="3057.55" dur="4.62">Pentagon audit in 2018 first one is ever</text>
  <text start="3060.58" dur="4.26">done and the results of this have been</text>
  <text start="3062.17" dur="4.08">kept very quiet kept under wraps I think</text>
  <text start="3064.84" dur="3.63">now that pay tree</text>
  <text start="3066.25" dur="3.9">in control good guys are getting into</text>
  <text start="3068.47" dur="4.2">the highest levels of the three-letter</text>
  <text start="3070.15" dur="5.82">agencies good guys are getting into the</text>
  <text start="3072.67" dur="5.61">highest levels of power in our land the</text>
  <text start="3075.97" dur="3.54">presidential seat etc etc they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="3078.28" dur="3.45">to figure this stuff out there gathering</text>
  <text start="3079.51" dur="3.84">intelligence they probably figured a lot</text>
  <text start="3081.73" dur="4.53">of stuff out during this Pentagon audit</text>
  <text start="3083.35" dur="3.99">and they are analyzing that and acting</text>
  <text start="3086.26" dur="2.28">on that intelligence we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="3087.34" dur="2.4">follow the money follow the way the heck</text>
  <text start="3088.54" dur="3.48">all these trillions of dollars have gone</text>
  <text start="3089.74" dur="4.26">all these years so of course that takes</text>
  <text start="3092.02" dur="3.57">a lot of time and manpower to do which</text>
  <text start="3094" dur="3.48">is why this isn&amp;#39;t happening like</text>
  <text start="3095.59" dur="4.59">that like many of us want but let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="3097.48" dur="5.01">realistic it&amp;#39;s a big game began bit that</text>
  <text start="3100.18" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re doing right here so yeah</text>
  <text start="3102.49" dur="3.45">Pentagon audit happened interesting</text>
  <text start="3104.74" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re probably figuring out where a</text>
  <text start="3105.94" dur="3.51">lot of that money&amp;#39;s gone what&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="3107.65" dur="3.33">getting an idea of what the heck these</text>
  <text start="3109.45" dur="4.62">defense contractors are actually up to</text>
  <text start="3110.98" dur="4.59">and then space force creation so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3114.07" dur="2.73">having a difficult time a lot of</text>
  <text start="3115.57" dur="3.21">bureaucracy a lot of deep state</text>
  <text start="3116.8" dur="3.9">opposition which is interesting to the</text>
  <text start="3118.78" dur="3.21">space force but nevertheless they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3120.7" dur="3.06">getting people into positions that are</text>
  <text start="3121.99" dur="3.93">more down for the agenda the ex</text>
  <text start="3123.76" dur="4.14">secretary of the Air Force wasn&amp;#39;t down</text>
  <text start="3125.92" dur="4.98">for the space force the new secretary of</text>
  <text start="3127.9" dur="4.44">the Air Force is Patrick Shanahan the ex</text>
  <text start="3130.9" dur="2.76">Secretary of Defense</text>
  <text start="3132.34" dur="2.97">he was definitely for the space force</text>
  <text start="3133.66" dur="3.54">and their new acting Secretary of</text>
  <text start="3135.31" dur="4.86">Defense Mark Esper it&amp;#39;s definitely down</text>
  <text start="3137.2" dur="4.44">for the space force so there&amp;#39;s more as</text>
  <text start="3140.17" dur="2.97">push going on against that bureaucracy</text>
  <text start="3141.64" dur="4.71">trying to get creative but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3143.14" dur="7.86">exactly why they&amp;#39;re trying to gain IMO</text>
  <text start="3146.35" dur="7.98">in my opinion access gain control over</text>
  <text start="3151" dur="4.59">the programs and then you know once they</text>
  <text start="3154.33" dur="5.79">have this space force like what a</text>
  <text start="3155.59" dur="7.98">perfect way to just start acquiring</text>
  <text start="3160.12" dur="6.15">getting the acquisition of space assets</text>
  <text start="3163.57" dur="5.25">that they can and then developing more</text>
  <text start="3166.27" dur="4.5">open source space stuff and then</text>
  <text start="3168.82" dur="2.58">disclosing things you know away from</text>
  <text start="3170.77" dur="6.27">NASA</text>
  <text start="3171.4" dur="8.16">NASA&amp;#39;s too much of just a pit create</text>
  <text start="3177.04" dur="5.22">this new space force start setting it up</text>
  <text start="3179.56" dur="6.06">and then you know the Navy what about</text>
  <text start="3182.26" dur="8.31">that Navy patent a Navy patent for that</text>
  <text start="3185.62" dur="6.9">triangle looking thing that they had is</text>
  <text start="3190.57" dur="3.63">very interesting you know I can&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="3192.52" dur="3.87">remember the exact details of who</text>
  <text start="3194.2" dur="5.34">patented it but patent a few very</text>
  <text start="3196.39" dur="3.659">intriguing patents for the Navy back in</text>
  <text start="3199.54" dur="3.36">the end</text>
  <text start="3200.049" dur="6.78">2017 or recently right recently and</text>
  <text start="3202.9" dur="4.909">these were granted patents okay so oh as</text>
  <text start="3206.829" dur="4.081">the Navy</text>
  <text start="3207.809" dur="5.68">paying a big Clark playing a big part in</text>
  <text start="3210.91" dur="4.5">full disclosure very funny</text>
  <text start="3213.489" dur="5.55">William Tompkins you know was in the</text>
  <text start="3215.41" dur="5.939">Navy and could have maintained a navy</text>
  <text start="3219.039" dur="4.07">contacts what if William Tompkins was</text>
  <text start="3221.349" dur="3.541">sort of urged to come out by people</text>
  <text start="3223.109" dur="6.01">towards mean of his life you know who</text>
  <text start="3224.89" dur="8.129">knows so hmm you could kind of you can</text>
  <text start="3229.119" dur="5.07">kind of see what groups are more for</text>
  <text start="3233.019" dur="3.06">full disclosure and which ones are not</text>
  <text start="3234.189" dur="4.32">you know you kind of again you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3236.079" dur="4.28">generalize the whole agency isn&amp;#39;t bad or</text>
  <text start="3238.509" dur="4.74">the whole service isn&amp;#39;t bad but</text>
  <text start="3240.359" dur="5.98">typically where there&amp;#39;s been more deep</text>
  <text start="3243.249" dur="6.75">state control has been of course CIA Air</text>
  <text start="3246.339" dur="5.85">Force various defense contractors but</text>
  <text start="3249.999" dur="5.55">then you have at least right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3252.189" dur="5.16">seeing and the NSA really turned for</text>
