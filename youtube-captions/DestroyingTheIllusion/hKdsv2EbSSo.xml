  <text start="12.769" dur="2.49">of you have been worried because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="14.059" dur="2.55">been doing more videos of screen</text>
  <text start="15.259" dur="3.631">captures and things like that but the</text>
  <text start="16.609" dur="3.9">whiteboards go away but don&amp;#39;t you worry</text>
  <text start="18.89" dur="5.25">because obviously it&amp;#39;s just so simple</text>
  <text start="20.509" dur="5.601">it&amp;#39;s so easy to do educational videos or</text>
  <text start="24.14" dur="4.889">something like this you know it&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="26.11" dur="4.719">I&amp;#39;ve stream seen some mainstream media</text>
  <text start="29.029" dur="3.6">outlets start using whiteboards in the</text>
  <text start="30.829" dur="3.721">live broadcasts like Fox and a couple</text>
  <text start="32.629" dur="4.86">others now I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="34.55" dur="6.57">of me I&amp;#39;m just saying people are looking</text>
  <text start="37.489" dur="5.911">for substance overproduction values so</text>
  <text start="41.12" dur="4.53">of course still be doing videos of these</text>
  <text start="43.4" dur="4.98">and in this one I will be going over</text>
  <text start="45.65" dur="4.05">Antarctica I&amp;#39;ll be going over it because</text>
  <text start="48.38" dur="3">I&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot of questions on it</text>
  <text start="49.7" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s a lot of intrigue and a lot of</text>
  <text start="51.38" dur="5.4">people are unaware of the topic and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.93" dur="5.01">also pivotal and not only understanding</text>
  <text start="56.78" dur="5.279">our history but geopolitically in what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.94" dur="4.799">happening now so pretty much this week</text>
  <text start="62.059" dur="3.03">I&amp;#39;m devoting to Antarctica I&amp;#39;ll be doing</text>
  <text start="63.739" dur="4.41">this whiteboard video here today</text>
  <text start="65.089" dur="5.221">releasing it to January 31st mmm and</text>
  <text start="68.149" dur="3.871">then tomorrow I&amp;#39;ll be putting out an</text>
  <text start="70.31" dur="3.78">interview with dr. Michael Saleh that I</text>
  <text start="72.02" dur="5.489">just did cuz he&amp;#39;s got a new book coming</text>
  <text start="74.09" dur="6.659">out all about Antarctica the southern</text>
  <text start="77.509" dur="4.231">icy continent is important so in this</text>
  <text start="80.749" dur="2.521">video it&amp;#39;s just gonna be a short</text>
  <text start="81.74" dur="3.539">whiteboard one we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="83.27" dur="4.169">go over ancient history we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="85.279" dur="5.4">over modern history say the last 80 to</text>
  <text start="87.439" dur="6.21">100 years ago or so and then now why</text>
  <text start="90.679" dur="4.83">Antarctica is important at this instant</text>
  <text start="93.649" dur="3.78">so we&amp;#39;re gonna quickly go over each one</text>
  <text start="95.509" dur="3.691">again these whiteboard videos I do these</text>
  <text start="97.429" dur="4.71">are just freestyle off the top of my</text>
  <text start="99.2" dur="5.009">head so I obviously won&amp;#39;t be going too</text>
  <text start="102.139" dur="4.98">deep into these different topics and</text>
  <text start="104.209" dur="4.711">that&amp;#39;s why I doing things like reading</text>
  <text start="107.119" dur="4.38">books actually taking the effort to do</text>
  <text start="108.92" dur="4.89">that or you know I&amp;#39;ll be doing a webinar</text>
  <text start="111.499" dur="3.69">this weekend the second installment of</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="3.839">the secret space program webinar series</text>
  <text start="115.189" dur="3.6">and in that you know in an hour and a</text>
  <text start="117.649" dur="3.661">half presentation I&amp;#39;ll be able to go</text>
  <text start="118.789" dur="5.18">into these tops a little more so so in</text>
  <text start="121.31" dur="4.739">this let&amp;#39;s cover it quickly succinctly</text>
  <text start="123.969" dur="4.811">efficiently let&amp;#39;s talk about ancient</text>
  <text start="126.049" dur="4.8">history so the first thing to be aware</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="3.75">of when it comes to Antarctica and how</text>
  <text start="130.849" dur="3.831">its involved in ancient history it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.53" dur="4.47">understanding that humans have been here</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="4.2">for a little bit longer than just a</text>
  <text start="137" dur="4.7">couple thousand years and</text>
  <text start="138.88" dur="5.61">has been advanced civilizations that</text>
  <text start="141.7" dur="4.08">have existed before us now their</text>
  <text start="144.49" dur="2.4">advancements have been a little</text>
  <text start="145.78" dur="3.42">different they&amp;#39;re not quite as</text>
  <text start="146.89" dur="4.5">mechanically advanced as we might be now</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="4.62">but they understood a lot more of the</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="4.71">esoteric sciences and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="153.82" dur="4.35">evidence the amazing amounts of evidence</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="4.17">to show that there has been advanced</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="5.28">civilizations before this one and how</text>
  <text start="160.27" dur="5.63">that coincides with Antarctica is</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s a lot of research showing that</text>
  <text start="165.9" dur="3.94">one of these advanced civilizations</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="4.29">could very well be buried under the ice</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="7.23">in Antarctica now some people think that</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="7.35">it&amp;#39;s Atlantis right I&amp;#39;m saying here okay</text>
  <text start="177.07" dur="4.32">it could be could be remnants of this</text>
  <text start="179.74" dur="2.91">specific ancient civilization but</text>
  <text start="181.39" dur="5.25">regardless of which one it was their</text>
  <text start="182.65" dur="5.16">stuff buried under there and not only in</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="3.9">that dark to go but I think just</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="5.25">recently they&amp;#39;ve been finding underwater</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="4.05">pyramids in the oceans you know at one</text>
  <text start="193.06" dur="3.54">point that weren&amp;#39;t underwater they</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="3.57">weren&amp;#39;t submerged I believe just the</text>
  <text start="196.6" dur="4.38">other day an article came out showing</text>
  <text start="198.16" dur="5.04">pyramids near as either the Mexican or</text>
  <text start="200.98" dur="3.87">some Central American coastline and then</text>
  <text start="203.2" dur="3.9">of course there&amp;#39;s anomalies around the</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="4.35">Mediterranean something of the Baltic</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="4.38">Sea I believe has been found and then</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="2.9">Antarctica you know a lot of stuff under</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="4.26">the ice</text>
  <text start="212.1" dur="6.43">so pyramids I&amp;#39;m sure exist down there</text>
  <text start="215.74" dur="6.27">we&amp;#39;ve seen some interesting Google Earth</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="5.04">shots of pyramids we&amp;#39;ve seen there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="4.05">different anomalies around you know</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="3.6">Michael Salah will be talking about that</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="3.18">in the video I&amp;#39;m gonna release in his</text>
  <text start="227.17" dur="5.37">book but I&amp;#39;m just letting you know now</text>
  <text start="229.24" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s real stuff and not only in regards</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="4.23">to ancient history now let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="234.07" dur="7.44">modern history so this is a real urn</text>
  <text start="236.77" dur="6.689">really over the past 80 to 100 years</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="4.05">like I mentioned earlier so this really</text>
  <text start="243.459" dur="3.991">starts around World War two and what was</text>
  <text start="245.56" dur="4.98">going on in World War two is that we had</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="6.54">Nazi Germany over here we had the Allies</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="6.27">we&amp;#39;re gonna basically say America right</text>
  <text start="253.99" dur="4.44">now to represent the Allies so we had</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="4.92">these composing factions across the</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="5.04">Atlantic Ocean and the Nazis you see</text>
  <text start="261.73" dur="5.24">they didn&amp;#39;t have the industrial might</text>
  <text start="263.47" dur="6.96">that the Allied powers had but they</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="4.7">believed that what was termed as</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="3.79">qualitative superior</text>
  <text start="271.67" dur="5.37">basically having more advanced stuff</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="7.32">would win them the war so the Nazis in</text>
  <text start="277.04" dur="6.84">the 20s and 30s and 40s before World War</text>
  <text start="281.54" dur="5.01">two they for instance went on</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="5.94">expeditions to Tibet to find some</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="6.72">esoteric research they used some very</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="5.76">unconventional means to garner this</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="4.41">research as well you can look into Maria</text>
  <text start="295.58" dur="4.71">or such in the Royal Society channeling</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="4.74">actually channeling information on how</text>
  <text start="300.29" dur="4.92">to build anti-gravity craft and these</text>
  <text start="302.42" dur="3.87">occult Sciences in this instance when I</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="2.61">say esoteric and occult</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="4.92">I just mean hidden I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="5.52">mean batter nefarious so they use</text>
  <text start="311.21" dur="4.05">channeling and there was also technology</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="4.92">exchange that the Nazis did with very</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="5.49">conquest oriented nefarious non</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="4.95">terrestrial beings so with all those</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="4.44">things being said when it came down to</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="3.99">World War Two because of the expeditions</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="2.67">and the research is different there to</text>
  <text start="327.2" dur="3.59">excuse me</text>
  <text start="327.86" dur="5.61">development that the Nazis did they had</text>
  <text start="330.79" dur="4.75">some prototypes of advanced anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="333.47" dur="4.44">stuff they had a lot more advanced stuff</text>
  <text start="335.54" dur="3.9">than the Allies had but the thing is the</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="3.9">Allies they had more tanks they had more</text>
  <text start="339.44" dur="3.99">men on the ground and Germany didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="5.73">have enough of their really event stuff</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="7.22">to beat all that yet so while the Allied</text>
  <text start="347.54" dur="5.34">powers invaded Europe the Nazis</text>
  <text start="350.65" dur="4.9">basically took a lot of their advanced</text>
  <text start="352.88" dur="4.74">R&amp;amp;D research and development and brought</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="4.17">it down to my dark teeka they already</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="4.89">had a strong presence in South America</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="4.89">here so they started developing bases in</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="4.2">Antarctica because what&amp;#39;s amazing is</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="6.51">that under the ice there&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="6.57">caverns tunnel systems and places where</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="6.9">not two u-boats could go into they could</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="8.01">take a lot of their research their their</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="4.65">stuff their humans they used for slave</text>
  <text start="381.29" dur="2.61">labor and bring them down here and</text>
  <text start="382.67" dur="3.63">actually develop pieces out in</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="5.55">Antarctica so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="386.3" dur="5.55">late 30s we&amp;#39;re up to late 30s and 40s</text>
  <text start="389.45" dur="4.23">here is that the Nazis took their stuff</text>
  <text start="391.85" dur="4.86">down here and then of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.68" dur="5.16">operation Highjump where the Americans</text>
  <text start="396.71" dur="4.11">found out the Nazis were taking their</text>
  <text start="398.84" dur="2.859">stuff down Antarctica they commissioned</text>
  <text start="400.82" dur="5.71">Admiral Byrd</text>
  <text start="401.699" dur="7.53">in 1947 now 47 here so where the end or</text>
  <text start="406.53" dur="8.34">were past the official end of World War</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="7.261">two but in 47 a high jump down to</text>
  <text start="414.87" dur="2.669">Antarctica tried to find the knots of</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="3.269">bases they got their asses kicked</text>
  <text start="417.539" dur="4.771">because the Germans were you know by</text>
  <text start="419.759" dur="5.46">that time 1947 they actually built some</text>
  <text start="422.31" dur="4.829">advanced stuff some saucer Nazi Bell</text>
  <text start="425.219" dur="4.23">craft with beam part of the weapons on</text>
  <text start="427.139" dur="4.56">them beat the up of Admiral Byrd&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="4.74">expedition Admiral Byrd then had to</text>
  <text start="431.699" dur="4.68">retreat back to Chile and eventually</text>
  <text start="434.189" dur="4.32">back to America and then the Nazis</text>
  <text start="436.379" dur="3.51">actually didn&amp;#39;t win or lose the war I</text>
  <text start="438.509" dur="3.301">should say they didn&amp;#39;t really lose world</text>
  <text start="439.889" dur="4.921">war two they went underground to</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="4.469">Antarctica like all my arrows I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="444.81" dur="3.329">going back and forth here then went</text>
  <text start="446.279" dur="3.711">underground Antarctica they ended up</text>
  <text start="448.139" dur="4.231">infiltrating the American military</text>
  <text start="449.99" dur="4.329">American military complex and then of</text>
  <text start="452.37" dur="4.169">course through Operation Paperclip the</text>
  <text start="454.319" dur="5.12">Nazis were able to bring in thousands of</text>
  <text start="456.539" dur="6.3">their scientists into America during the</text>
  <text start="459.439" dur="6.491">40s and 50s and whatnot and they ended</text>
  <text start="462.839" dur="7.561">up in the media in our pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="8.25">systems in our aerospace corporations</text>
  <text start="470.4" dur="6.66">especially so point being in modern</text>
  <text start="474.18" dur="6.06">history not just didn&amp;#39;t lose they went</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="6.139">down to Antarctica and developed their</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="4.979">stuff we&amp;#39;re able to infiltrate into the</text>
  <text start="483.199" dur="3.64">American complex that they wanted for</text>
  <text start="485.219" dur="5.16">their industrial might and then that</text>
  <text start="486.839" dur="8.781">brings us to now so right now this cabal</text>
  <text start="490.379" dur="7.77">that&amp;#39;s Nazi / scientists / deep state /</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="4">basically just the evil powers that be</text>
  <text start="498.149" dur="3.3">on our planet you know there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="6.779">factions many names you could give form</text>
  <text start="501.449" dur="7.53">but in essence the deep state has still</text>
  <text start="506.399" dur="6.541">basis I am sure of it in Antarctica</text>
  <text start="508.979" dur="6.35">different you know black off the books</text>
  <text start="512.94" dur="5.279">highly top-secret super-classified</text>
  <text start="515.329" dur="5.89">various bases and programs still down in</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="6.151">Antarctica now what&amp;#39;s going on is that a</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="5.61">white hat Alliance is of course trying</text>
  <text start="524.37" dur="5.25">to defeat this deep state by taking out</text>
  <text start="526.829" dur="4.711">their middle east components taking out</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="3.48">their rothschild Europe components</text>
  <text start="531.54" dur="2.64">taking out their you know the</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="3.69">infiltration they&amp;#39;ve done it</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="4.65">to America and of course Antarctica</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="3.93">still having a lot of the bases and</text>
  <text start="538.83" dur="3.81">technologies and things down there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="3.72">just it&amp;#39;s gonna play a pivotal part and</text>
  <text start="542.64" dur="3.449">of course you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="3.24">my work you might have heard me</text>
  <text start="546.089" dur="4.651">mentioned before the idea of partial</text>
  <text start="547.68" dur="4.71">disclosure you know they could easily do</text>
  <text start="550.74" dur="3.9">some kind of false flag partial</text>
  <text start="552.39" dur="4.65">disclosure by telling us all there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="4.61">Atlantis has been found in Antarctica or</text>
  <text start="557.04" dur="4.35">their summit really advanced</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="4.42">technologies that we just magically</text>
  <text start="561.39" dur="5.52">found down there and that way it could</text>
  <text start="563.67" dur="4.71">wow the public they Bay oh look at all</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="5.22">this magic stuff we found and they would</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="5.97">completely distract them from the events</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="3.6">going on in North America and in the</text>
  <text start="574.35" dur="3.57">Middle East and whatnot right now so</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="4.109">that&amp;#39;s I mean that&amp;#39;s just one thing to</text>
  <text start="577.92" dur="3.83">look out for with what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="579.839" dur="4.081">Antarctica now it could be utilized in a</text>
  <text start="581.75" dur="3.7">psychological operation or the</text>
