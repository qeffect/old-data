  <text start="10.18" dur="5.47">what&amp;#39;s up ladies and gentlemen its April</text>
  <text start="12.83" dur="4.71">19th and in this video what I want to do</text>
  <text start="15.65" dur="4.53">is discuss with you what&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="17.54" dur="6">Schumann resonance and essentially how</text>
  <text start="20.18" dur="5.43">the Earth&amp;#39;s energetic output correlates</text>
  <text start="23.54" dur="4.71">with our brain waves in our human</text>
  <text start="25.61" dur="4.14">consciousness pretty neat stuff but</text>
  <text start="28.25" dur="3.509">before I get into that what I want to do</text>
  <text start="29.75" dur="4.41">is say welcome to all of my new</text>
  <text start="31.759" dur="4.711">subscribers because holy shitballs</text>
  <text start="34.16" dur="5.4">Batman that Donald Trump Vladimir Putin</text>
  <text start="36.47" dur="5.91">video I did just exploded has some like</text>
  <text start="39.56" dur="4.86">30,000 views now and even Robert David</text>
  <text start="42.38" dur="2.94">Steele commented on it and reposted it</text>
  <text start="44.42" dur="4.56">said he&amp;#39;d liked it</text>
  <text start="45.32" dur="6.39">so huge honor there and that was really</text>
  <text start="48.98" dur="4.53">cool got a lot of new subscribers on</text>
  <text start="51.71" dur="3.42">that so welcome you know what I do on</text>
  <text start="53.51" dur="4.43">this channel is obviously as it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="55.13" dur="5.31">destroying the illusion so I basically</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="4.96">call out the that&amp;#39;s propagated</text>
  <text start="60.44" dur="6.179">from all media and education</text>
  <text start="62.9" dur="6.23">indoctrination sources and give you my</text>
  <text start="66.619" dur="6.361">opinion give you the not so mainstream</text>
  <text start="69.13" dur="5.41">truth on health and politics and I like</text>
  <text start="72.98" dur="3.06">UFOs a lot to all kinds of neat stuff</text>
  <text start="74.54" dur="3.99">anyway</text>
  <text start="76.04" dur="4.8">in this video we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss the</text>
  <text start="78.53" dur="5.19">Schumann and the inspiration for this</text>
  <text start="80.84" dur="4.95">video comes from a Facebook post that I</text>
  <text start="83.72" dur="3.75">did a couple days ago which also went</text>
  <text start="85.79" dur="3.54">pretty viral it got like three thousand</text>
  <text start="87.47" dur="3.689">shares which it&amp;#39;s kind of why I took a</text>
  <text start="89.33" dur="4.05">few days off just kind of rest and</text>
  <text start="91.159" dur="5.701">recoup after way too much stuff going on</text>
  <text start="93.38" dur="5.37">but this post right here and this post</text>
  <text start="96.86" dur="4.56">on Facebook that I did was discussing</text>
  <text start="98.75" dur="5.25">the Schumann resonance and how on Easter</text>
  <text start="101.42" dur="5.67">we saw the Schumann resonance hit its</text>
  <text start="104" dur="7.65">highest recorded value ever at ninety</text>
  <text start="107.09" dur="7.23">Hertz now it was awesome and on that</text>
  <text start="111.65" dur="4.98">post although I saw it had about three</text>
  <text start="114.32" dur="4.29">to four hundred comments and a lot of</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="3.54">those comments were people still kind of</text>
  <text start="118.61" dur="4.619">unaware of what the Schumann resonance</text>
  <text start="120.17" dur="4.83">II is how it affects us and what the</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="5.221">changes necessarily means so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="125" dur="5.22">outline some of that to you and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="128.45" dur="4.679">gonna try to face the camera while I</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="4.079">speak because I ordered a mic on Amazon</text>
  <text start="133.129" dur="3.321">that&amp;#39;ll be here in a few days so these</text>
  <text start="134.299" dur="5.071">will sound a whole lot better but I know</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="4.21">sometimes I leave the board and you</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="2.699">can&amp;#39;t hear me so well so I&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="140.66" dur="2.79">face this way and this will be</text>
  <text start="142.069" dur="2.971">like I&amp;#39;ll try to be like one of those</text>
  <text start="143.45" dur="5.099">people on the on the news with the green</text>
  <text start="145.04" dur="5.22">screens and this anyway first I want to</text>
  <text start="148.549" dur="4.291">discuss the Schumann resonance what it</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="5.61">is for those that are still unaware the</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="6.509">Schumann Schumann resonance as you can</text>
  <text start="155.87" dur="3.929">tell by my fantastic artwork you like</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="4.92">that guy</text>
  <text start="159.799" dur="6.541">alright well triangle nose Schumann was</text>
  <text start="164.269" dur="6.961">discovered so this resonance was</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="8.549">discovered in 1954 by dr. Otto Schumann</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="6.349">who was a German physicist and first he</text>
  <text start="174.889" dur="5.43">postulated in 1962 that there would be</text>
  <text start="177.579" dur="4.33">standing electromagnetic waves between</text>
  <text start="180.319" dur="4.32">the Earth&amp;#39;s surface and the ionosphere</text>
  <text start="181.909" dur="5.31">and then in 1954 he discovered those</text>
  <text start="184.639" dur="4.05">waves and those waves were named after</text>
  <text start="187.219" dur="6.061">him there called the Schumann resonance</text>
  <text start="188.689" dur="7.321">and he found these waves to be at 7.8 3</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="5.819">hurts hurts is cycles per second so</text>
  <text start="196.01" dur="5.729">basically what we have is standing</text>
  <text start="199.099" dur="5.941">electromagnetic electromagnetic waves</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="4.62">that are caused by lightning discharges</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="3.27">because of course we have lightning</text>
  <text start="206.359" dur="5.58">going off all over the planet at any</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="5.669">given time and this electrical input</text>
  <text start="211.939" dur="3.991">from the Lightning causes causes these</text>
  <text start="213.979" dur="4.23">standing electromagnetic waves to occur</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="4.709">and the Earth&amp;#39;s surface in the</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="3.12">ionosphere has about a 30-mile gap in</text>
  <text start="220.639" dur="3.331">between the two</text>
  <text start="221.329" dur="5.851">Jahna the ionosphere starts at 30 miles</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="5.669">and extends a few hundred up but in that</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="4.199">gap we find the Schumann residence which</text>
  <text start="229.639" dur="4.74">are these standing eeehm waves and these</text>
  <text start="231.379" dur="4.53">iam waves are normally they were first</text>
  <text start="234.379" dur="3.151">measured at seven point eight three</text>
  <text start="235.909" dur="3.841">Hertz and they stayed that way for</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="5.039">decades now here&amp;#39;s the thing all</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="4.349">biological life entrains itself to these</text>
  <text start="242.569" dur="3.63">frequencies it&amp;#39;s cooked it&amp;#39;s often</text>
  <text start="244.099" dur="4.41">called the Earth&amp;#39;s heartbeat or the</text>
  <text start="246.199" dur="4.29">tuning fork for life so keep that in</text>
  <text start="248.509" dur="3.72">mind it&amp;#39;s as essential they find when</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="4.411">they shoot astronauts off into space and</text>
  <text start="252.229" dur="4.74">they don&amp;#39;t have these Schumann residents</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="4.079">or they&amp;#39;re not around these waves on the</text>
  <text start="256.969" dur="4.23">earth they can start getting psychosis</text>
  <text start="258.979" dur="4.141">issues so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s crucial for all</text>
  <text start="261.199" dur="5.31">biological life the Schumann resonance</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="8.88">now first measured at about eight</text>
  <text start="266.509" dur="8.371">Earth&amp;#39;s then in 2014 the the people that</text>
  <text start="272" dur="4.169">measured the resonance started seeing</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="2.909">some peculiar things</text>
  <text start="276.169" dur="3.75">there would be certain days where it</text>
  <text start="277.789" dur="4.291">would spike now it didn&amp;#39;t spike all the</text>
  <text start="279.919" dur="6.511">time it wouldn&amp;#39;t stay risen but it would</text>
  <text start="282.08" dur="6.839">be for a certain few hours okay in 2014</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="5.509">they showed it spiking to between 11 and</text>
  <text start="288.919" dur="5.671">14 Hertz just about three years ago</text>
  <text start="291.939" dur="5.5">earlier this year on January 31st just</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="7.71">about a few months ago they found it</text>
  <text start="297.439" dur="7.771">spiked to 36 Hertz and now just on</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="6.359">Easter they showed like I said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="6.359">spiking to 90 Hertz this is a more is</text>
  <text start="308.659" dur="5.28">this is a screenshot of it that you can</text>
  <text start="311.569" dur="4.831">see a little clearer of a screenshot</text>
  <text start="313.939" dur="4.081">then that Facebook post I did that you</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="4.139">could see the saturation right here that</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="5.639">big white part that just oh it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="320.539" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s like a big ol energetic ooh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.659" dur="5.31">the Schumann resonance spiking</text>
  <text start="325.969" dur="6.181">amplifying basically what I think it is</text>
  <text start="328.969" dur="5.28">saturates us with more energy output</text>
  <text start="332.15" dur="4.979">okay so that&amp;#39;s the Schumann resonance</text>
  <text start="334.249" dur="5.79">ours heartbeat now I want to talk to you</text>
  <text start="337.129" dur="6.241">about brain waves and how our brain</text>
  <text start="340.039" dur="5.91">waves in our minds correlate to this</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="5.419">human resonance now first I want to</text>
  <text start="345.949" dur="5.96">discuss with you the concept of</text>
  <text start="348.789" dur="7.03">entrainment now the definition of</text>
  <text start="351.909" dur="7.24">entrainment means to draw along with or</text>
  <text start="355.819" dur="4.801">in essentially to synchronize now this</text>
  <text start="359.149" dur="3.151">is an important concept to understand</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="5.519">because of course we have the giant</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="6.869">earth putting out these electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="366.139" dur="6.231">waves now it must also be realized that</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="7.441">our brain waves are our brain functions</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="6.639">in specific categories or specific</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="5.489">levels of electromagnetic output and</text>
  <text start="379.009" dur="5.611">when the earth the earth centrally being</text>
  <text start="382.099" dur="5.16">a big ball of electricity will in train</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="4.919">our brains or draw our brains along with</text>
  <text start="387.259" dur="4.62">it with this human resonance okay</text>
  <text start="389.539" dur="3.571">important but first before I talk a</text>
  <text start="391.879" dur="3.12">little bit more about that I want to</text>
  <text start="393.11" dur="3.959">talk about the levels of brainwave</text>
  <text start="394.999" dur="5.34">output then we can discuss how that</text>
  <text start="397.069" dur="5.011">correlates with a rising Schumann so we</text>
  <text start="400.339" dur="4.411">have different levels like I said of</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="4.769">brainwaves we have Delta Theta alpha</text>
  <text start="404.75" dur="5.04">beta gamma and each correlates with a</text>
  <text start="406.849" dur="5.041">specific set of frequencies spit</text>
  <text start="409.79" dur="4.23">like bandwidth you could think of it so</text>
  <text start="411.89" dur="5.19">we have Delta which is about zero to</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="5.49">four or 0.1 to four Hertz and this is</text>
  <text start="417.08" dur="5.64">associated with a deep sleep these are</text>
  <text start="419.51" dur="6.93">very long it&amp;#39;s a very long bandwidth</text>
  <text start="422.72" dur="5.58">long waves and you really only emit them</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="4.44">in your brain when you&amp;#39;re in a very deep</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="4.5">sleep or you&amp;#39;re basically unconscious or</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="5.07">in your comatose so when you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="6.63">vegetable you&amp;#39;re in Delta range theta</text>
  <text start="435.95" dur="6.27">theta is four to eight Hertz okay now</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="5.67">this is basically a light light sleep or</text>
  <text start="442.22" dur="5.97">a deep meditation and this is often</text>
  <text start="445.1" dur="4.49">associated with REM sleep rapid eye</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="4.2">movement sleep that&amp;#39;s kind of between</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="3.82">Delta and theta when your brain you know</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="3.68">starts pumping out all that</text>
  <text start="453.41" dur="5.76">dimethyltryptamine that&amp;#39;s when you are</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="5.62">pretty low brain waves about right there</text>
  <text start="459.17" dur="5.07">but theta unlike sleep in a deeper</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="4.14">meditation so this is kind of where you</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="2.82">start to actually wake up where your</text>
  <text start="465.83" dur="4.92">eyes open</text>
  <text start="467.06" dur="5.28">theta is I usually meditate before I do</text>
  <text start="470.75" dur="3.48">these videos because it kind of helps</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="4.59">calm my brain down I felt - oh I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="474.23" dur="4.65">go off on so many tangents and I focus</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="4.77">better I also drink a lot of green tea</text>
  <text start="478.88" dur="6.27">right green tea has an amino acid called</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="7.44">l-theanine which promotes a theta state</text>
  <text start="485.15" dur="7.11">so you&amp;#39;re more focused and then we have</text>
  <text start="489.14" dur="6.09">alpha the Alpha weck range this is about</text>
  <text start="492.26" dur="5.25">8 to 14 Hertz and this is associated</text>
  <text start="495.23" dur="6.75">with a lighter meditation or more of a</text>
  <text start="497.51" dur="7.05">waking consciousness and the Alpha range</text>
  <text start="501.98" dur="5.55">is that&amp;#39;s when you were focused that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.56" dur="5.13">when you&amp;#39;re kind of a relaxed focus</text>
  <text start="507.53" dur="3.39">though you could say is that&amp;#39;s when you</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="4.38">know that&amp;#39;s pretty much where you want</text>
  <text start="510.92" dur="5.91">to be when you&amp;#39;re awake is the Alpha</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="5.61">range then we have beta and gamma beta</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="5.399">is 14 to 40 Hertz and gamma is above 40</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="4.71">Hertz and these ranges are associated</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="4.761">with a higher alertness higher</text>
  <text start="524.39" dur="5.94">information processing and levels of</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="6.28">insight but when your brainwaves get</text>
  <text start="530.33" dur="4.77">very high like this like in beta or</text>
  <text start="533.27" dur="3.54">gamma you can also get a heightened</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="3.42">state of anxiety - they can be</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="5.1">associated with kind of a nervousness or</text>
  <text start="538.52" dur="4.83">anxiety so that&amp;#39;s something to be aware</text>
  <text start="541.91" dur="4.83">of you don&amp;#39;t really want to</text>
  <text start="543.35" dur="5.7">always be at a higher level of</text>
  <text start="546.74" dur="6.9">information processing or awareness like</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="7.1">that because staying there could screw</text>
  <text start="553.64" dur="3.81">with your head so that&amp;#39;s the ranges of</text>
  <text start="556.15" dur="3.55">brainwaves</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="3.84">now you&amp;#39;ll correlate okay we have</text>
  <text start="559.7" dur="4.8">Schumann at seven point eight three</text>
  <text start="561.29" dur="5.85">Hertz here you can see that&amp;#39;s associated</text>
  <text start="564.5" dur="5.19">with kind of a borderline theta alpha</text>
  <text start="567.14" dur="6.66">range so normally what the earth</text>
  <text start="569.69" dur="9.27">essentially entrains us to is a theta</text>
  <text start="573.8" dur="7.65">alpha is pretty much a almost a you</text>
  <text start="578.96" dur="5.16">could say unawakened consciousness so</text>
  <text start="581.45" dur="5.52">kind of like a low buzz there but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="6.2">noticing okay now it&amp;#39;s spiking spiking</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="6.33">in 2014 two ranges of higher alpha</text>
  <text start="590.32" dur="5.08">spiking earlier this year two ranges of</text>
  <text start="593.3" dur="4.77">beta and now the other day holy crap</text>
  <text start="595.4" dur="5.13">what is this range right gamma is above</text>
  <text start="598.07" dur="5.07">forty this could be some other bandwidth</text>
  <text start="600.53" dur="5.19">in and of itself so we have the Schumann</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="4.44">essentially spiking now of course like I</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="5.67">said it&amp;#39;s not good to really stay at</text>
  <text start="607.58" dur="6.66">these ranges but what it&amp;#39;s essentially</text>
  <text start="611.39" dur="5.85">doing is opening our minds up to higher</text>
  <text start="614.24" dur="5.13">information processing and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="617.24" dur="3.78">the earth is literally doing now I wrote</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="3.72">this question here because I kind of</text>
  <text start="621.02" dur="3.57">want to end this video now that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="623.09" dur="4.65">outlined what the Schumann is and how</text>
  <text start="624.59" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s essentially you I mean this is like</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="5.4">a literal version of higher vibration</text>
  <text start="631.31" dur="4.23">right a lot of people but a woowoo New</text>
  <text start="633.14" dur="4.05">Agers say Oh higher vibration but I be</text>
  <text start="635.54" dur="5.16">personally I like to know exactly what</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="5.7">that means when you say higher vibration</text>
  <text start="640.7" dur="3.48">and this is kind of a manifestation of</text>
  <text start="642.89" dur="3.93">that which is why I think it&amp;#39;s so cool</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="7.04">but this question here is weakening</text>
  <text start="646.82" dur="7.59">cosmic magnetics rising the Schumann and</text>
  <text start="651.22" dur="5.26">rising Schumann I should say related to</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="3.21">the solar shift and I want to end it</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="2.34">with that question because these are a</text>
  <text start="657.62" dur="4.38">couple more videos that I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="658.82" dur="4.35">soon too and I want to prep you for them</text>
  <text start="662" dur="3.18">because these are very important</text>
  <text start="663.17" dur="4.02">concepts I pretty much do these videos</text>
  <text start="665.18" dur="4.98">either because I find it freakin</text>
  <text start="667.19" dur="6">fascinating it&amp;#39;s a hilarious topic kind</text>
  <text start="670.16" dur="4.59">of like my last video I did or I think</text>
  <text start="673.19" dur="3.85">it&amp;#39;s just stuff people need to know</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="4.57">so usually all those three</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="4.919">blend together but basically is the</text>
  <text start="679.32" dur="5.819">weakening cosmic magnetics and a rising</text>
  <text start="681.959" dur="5.041">Schumann related to a solar shift now</text>
  <text start="685.139" dur="4.32">what do I mean by weakening cosmic</text>
  <text start="687" dur="6.24">magnetics so what we&amp;#39;re seeing kind of</text>
  <text start="689.459" dur="7.44">correlated with this whole 2012 shift</text>
  <text start="693.24" dur="6.18">Golden Age all this jazz is the Earth&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.899" dur="5.791">magnetic field is weakening heavily and</text>
  <text start="699.42" dur="6.81">our Sun the output of our Sun is</text>
  <text start="702.69" dur="5.67">deadening so we&amp;#39;re seeing basically the</text>
  <text start="706.23" dur="4.56">magnetic effects of our Sun basically</text>
  <text start="708.36" dur="6.57">all the cosmic celestial bodies start to</text>
  <text start="710.79" dur="6.15">dwindle start to weaken what this then</text>
  <text start="714.93" dur="5.31">allows is cosmic energies and</text>
  <text start="716.94" dur="7.889">frequencies such as the Schumann to</text>
  <text start="720.24" dur="6.45">affect us a little more so and the</text>
  <text start="724.829" dur="5.101">rising Schumann related to the solar</text>
  <text start="726.69" dur="5.67">shift now remember this is kind of what</text>
  <text start="729.93" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s all about here is the ascension</text>
  <text start="732.36" dur="5.399">process ascension or that solar shift</text>
  <text start="734.97" dur="5.52">that we&amp;#39;re undergoing now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="737.759" dur="6.45">essentially imminent is our Sun is going</text>
  <text start="740.49" dur="7.23">to make that quantum leap a quantum leap</text>
  <text start="744.209" dur="6.721">in evolution of its own and what i</text>
  <text start="747.72" dur="6.69">postulate right now is that the Schumann</text>
  <text start="750.93" dur="6.48">is essentially saturating us with all</text>
  <text start="754.41" dur="5.88">this energy to get us ready for that</text>
  <text start="757.41" dur="4.44">solar shift now it&amp;#39;s pretty much all</text>
  <text start="760.29" dur="4.229">speculation at this point because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="761.85" dur="4.62">still wondering why the heck the Xuan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="764.519" dur="5.491">humans raising like what&amp;#39;s all going on</text>
  <text start="766.47" dur="6.96">here but we do have very good scientific</text>
  <text start="770.01" dur="4.62">proof that there is a quantum solar</text>
  <text start="773.43" dur="4.86">shift that&amp;#39;s imminent</text>
  <text start="774.63" dur="5.37">now with these weakening magnetics of</text>
  <text start="778.29" dur="4.529">like I said our Sun and the earth and</text>
  <text start="780" dur="5.43">these human residents saturating us more</text>
  <text start="782.819" dur="4.111">so it could be so that the Schumann is</text>
  <text start="785.43" dur="4.5">basically prepping our consciousness</text>
  <text start="786.93" dur="6.42">getting us to be in higher levels of</text>
  <text start="789.93" dur="5.49">download to prepare us for this solar</text>
  <text start="793.35" dur="4.83">shift and when that solar shift happens</text>
  <text start="795.42" dur="4.5">maybe the Schumann is gonna the Schumann</text>
  <text start="798.18" dur="3.959">resonance will bump up a harmonic</text>
  <text start="799.92" dur="5.46">I mean maybe our brains will then start</text>
  <text start="802.139" dur="4.68">resonating at a higher frequency and be</text>
  <text start="805.38" dur="3.63">more accustomed to that without the</text>
  <text start="806.819" dur="4.171">anxieties there&amp;#39;s a lot of things you</text>
  <text start="809.01" dur="3.57">can kind of speculate but</text>
  <text start="810.99" dur="4.05">I just want you to keep it all in mind</text>
  <text start="812.58" dur="4.14">and to ruminate on it in your head I</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="5.46">mean think about these things because</text>
  <text start="816.72" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s what the heck is going on here and</text>
  <text start="820.5" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s some very important things that are</text>
  <text start="822.93" dur="4.83">coming our way to think about so I hope</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="3.48">I outlines kind of the Schumann</text>
  <text start="827.76" dur="3.81">resonance how it relates to our brain</text>
  <text start="829.89" dur="3.66">waves and certain things that are coming</text>
  <text start="831.57" dur="4.56">just think about it all right think</text>
  <text start="833.55" dur="6.9">about the solar shift think about how to</text>
  <text start="836.13" dur="6.54">best prepare yourselves for it somebody</text>
  <text start="840.45" dur="4.53">asked me on that Facebook post he said</text>
  <text start="842.67" dur="4.289">okay how the heck does this all relate</text>
  <text start="844.98" dur="5.13">to me like what do I want to do to best</text>
  <text start="846.959" dur="4.741">prepare myself and I simply said keep</text>
  <text start="850.11" dur="3.99">yourself mentally grounded and</text>
  <text start="851.7" dur="5.449">physically healthy that&amp;#39;s the best way</text>
  <text start="854.1" dur="6.859">to navigate these changes and as your</text>
  <text start="857.149" dur="7.451">DNA activates there&amp;#39;s another video I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="860.959" dur="6.101">another video topic I&amp;#39;ll do one on is</text>
  <text start="864.6" dur="4.44">the DNA activation but as our DNA</text>
  <text start="867.06" dur="4.74">activates and essentially Prime&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="869.04" dur="5.64">consciousness to endure that solar shift</text>
  <text start="871.8" dur="5.479">you want to keep yourself grounded and</text>
  <text start="874.68" dur="6.18">healthy to best navigate those changes</text>
  <text start="877.279" dur="5.591">so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this</text>
  <text start="880.86" dur="3.69">video a little bit longer of one again</text>
  <text start="882.87" dur="3.06">but some of you guys say you like my</text>
  <text start="884.55" dur="3.9">longer videos so I&amp;#39;m getting accustomed</text>
  <text start="885.93" dur="4.29">to not keeping it to five minutes and</text>
  <text start="888.45" dur="4.5">being able to ramble on because of</text>
  <text start="890.22" dur="5.22">course these topics I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.95" dur="6.78">we&amp;#39;re literally gonna have to redo our</text>
  <text start="895.44" dur="6.78">whole collegiate system and right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.73" dur="5.49">kind of what I think of I&amp;#39;m like huh how</text>
  <text start="902.22" dur="4.859">would I how would I relearn the populace</text>
  <text start="905.22" dur="4.5">because like Yoda said you have to</text>
  <text start="907.079" dur="5.491">unlearn and relearn and one of my</text>
  <text start="909.72" dur="4.859">favorite quotes is the the illiterate of</text>
  <text start="912.57" dur="3.78">the 21st century won&amp;#39;t be those who</text>
  <text start="914.579" dur="5.551">can&amp;#39;t read and write but those who can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="916.35" dur="5.4">unlearn and relearn so basically the</text>
  <text start="920.13" dur="4.019">whole goal of this channel is just to</text>
  <text start="921.75" dur="4.05">help people unlearn and relearn so thank</text>
  <text start="924.149" dur="4.111">you guys for following along and all</text>
  <text start="925.8" dur="3.75">your support through that process I hope</text>
  <text start="928.26" dur="4.35">you guys are unlearning and relearning</text>
  <text start="929.55" dur="5.27">some good stuff on this channel peace</text>
