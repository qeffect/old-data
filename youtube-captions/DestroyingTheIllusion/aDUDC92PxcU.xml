  <text start="683.449" dur="4.591">get some background on this some more</text>

  <text start="773.529" dur="3.331">I&amp;#39;m saying here so that&amp;#39;s why these</text>
  <text start="774.819" dur="3.33">things like the technology and the</text>
  <text start="776.86" dur="4.139">secret space programs need to be</text>

  <text start="780.999" dur="4.05">so you have the background in</text>

  <text start="786.85" dur="4.589">trying to do with making this kind of</text>
  <text start="788.949" dur="4.8">stuff public now you see I would really</text>
  <text start="791.439" dur="7.83">like them in a full disclosure scenario</text>
  <text start="793.749" dur="6.78">to give the truth about the physics</text>
  <text start="799.269" dur="3.48">problems that they&amp;#39;ve already solved in</text>

  <text start="809.86" dur="5.069">aback and you know a lot of these kind</text>
  <text start="813.339" dur="3.571">of concepts that&amp;#39;s what I really want to</text>
  <text start="814.929" dur="3.03">see come forward when I look at nuclear</text>
  <text start="816.91" dur="3.81">fusion power jets</text>
  <text start="817.959" dur="5.79">we don&amp;#39;t need nuclear fusion guys all we</text>
  <text start="820.72" dur="4.89">need is electricity that&amp;#39;s what I want</text>
  <text start="823.749" dur="4.2">to see come forward then on the topic of</text>
  <text start="825.61" dur="6.18">UFO is in disclosure as well this one</text>
  <text start="827.949" dur="5.82">was peculiar and it came out today for</text>
  <text start="831.79" dur="3.93">you know April Fool&amp;#39;s Day it was</text>
  <text start="833.769" dur="4.74">actually a stunt that was pulled by the</text>
  <text start="835.72" dur="5.099">Army Corps of Engineers free queuing on</text>
  <text start="838.509" dur="3.87">followers red castle interesting</text>
  <text start="840.819" dur="5.73">connection but look at the headline here</text>
  <text start="842.379" dur="6.87">Corps of Engineers pulls a UFO out of DC</text>
  <text start="846.549" dur="5.371">waters near the Reagan International</text>
  <text start="849.249" dur="5.13">Airport and this was a April Fool&amp;#39;s Day</text>
  <text start="851.92" dur="4.409">kind of a media stunt that they did but</text>
  <text start="854.379" dur="5.481">look at this look at this picture man</text>
  <text start="856.329" dur="6.091">this is crazy they actually used like a</text>
  <text start="859.86" dur="3.099">legit looking flying saucer here like</text>
  <text start="862.42" dur="2.849">something</text>
  <text start="862.959" dur="3.93">Lockheed Martin would make for that you</text>
  <text start="865.269" dur="3.87">know the Germans made back during World</text>
  <text start="866.889" dur="2.521">War two look at this actually you know</text>
  <text start="869.139" dur="4.771">what</text>
  <text start="869.41" dur="6.179">it looks more like ODIs cars UFO look up</text>
  <text start="873.91" dur="4.349">Otis car he was a protege of Nikola</text>
  <text start="875.589" dur="4.86">Tesla he made an actual UFO that was</text>
  <text start="878.259" dur="5.971">powered by consciousness interfacing</text>
  <text start="880.449" dur="8.22">crystals he called it the Oct x1 if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="884.23" dur="6.63">getting that right it was a a something</text>
  <text start="888.669" dur="4.621">like that Oct 1 but that it actually</text>
  <text start="890.86" dur="5.069">looks a lot like that that he patented</text>
  <text start="893.29" dur="5.4">but look at this like why would they</text>
  <text start="895.929" dur="5.071">pull this stunt right and yeah</text>
  <text start="898.69" dur="5.04">you can laugh it off but some of the</text>
  <text start="901" dur="6.66">best ways to bring the truth out to the</text>
  <text start="903.73" dur="6.66">public is in with humor isn&amp;#39;t it so huh</text>
  <text start="907.66" dur="4.74">and and you know it&amp;#39;s just the Army</text>
  <text start="910.39" dur="4.34">Corps of Engineers a military</text>
  <text start="912.4" dur="4.89">organization pulling a stunt like this</text>
  <text start="914.73" dur="4.81">it&amp;#39;s just interesting and treating</text>
  <text start="917.29" dur="5.58">peculiar some about this I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.54" dur="6.33">a lot more to it that then meets the eye</text>
  <text start="922.87" dur="5.58">you see so just keep that in mind I need</text>
  <text start="925.87" dur="7.85">I think these kinds of soft disclosures</text>
  <text start="928.45" dur="8.27">are going to happen more and more right</text>
  <text start="933.72" dur="6.43">just to get the public&amp;#39;s consciousness</text>
  <text start="936.72" dur="5.32">prepared and to kind of take these</text>
  <text start="940.15" dur="3.78">things seriously and then very last</text>
  <text start="942.04" dur="3.18">article this one on extraterrestrial</text>
  <text start="943.93" dur="2.87">life and I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve seen this one</text>
  <text start="945.22" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s been going around</text>
  <text start="946.8" dur="5.89">front page mainstream over the past few</text>
  <text start="949.42" dur="6.48">days but it&amp;#39;s on the atacama being this</text>
  <text start="952.69" dur="4.98">little tiny being is like that big that</text>
  <text start="955.9" dur="4.74">was found in the Atacama Desert that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="957.67" dur="5.19">why it&amp;#39;s called Atacama so or odda but</text>
  <text start="960.64" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s a little being and apparently there</text>
  <text start="962.86" dur="4.41">was a study that came out of Stanford a</text>
  <text start="964.78" dur="5.04">paper recently that said that this</text>
  <text start="967.27" dur="7.2">little being was actually a deformed</text>
  <text start="969.82" dur="8.52">girl and kind of naesang it just just</text>
  <text start="974.47" dur="5.55">debunking it in a way and I just I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="978.34" dur="4.5">know if I agree with that Stanford</text>
  <text start="980.02" dur="4.89">report I mean lots of stuff that comes</text>
  <text start="982.84" dur="3.33">out of Stanford I question you know</text>
  <text start="984.91" dur="3.03">there&amp;#39;s been studies all across the</text>
  <text start="986.17" dur="4.76">board medical studies physics studies</text>
  <text start="987.94" dur="6.63">and whatnot that are all debunking and</text>
  <text start="990.93" dur="5.86">fitting that stat quo establishment</text>
  <text start="994.57" dur="3.84">narrative that comes out of Stanford so</text>
  <text start="996.79" dur="4.92">and when I look at this Bing straight up</text>
  <text start="998.41" dur="6.66">I&amp;#39;m like that that even a deformed human</text>
  <text start="1001.71" dur="6">that skull structure that bone structure</text>
  <text start="1005.07" dur="5.16">I mean just look at the jaw it just it</text>
  <text start="1007.71" dur="5.58">doesn&amp;#39;t look human even if it there was</text>
  <text start="1010.23" dur="5.13">some kind of mutation or pre birth or</text>
  <text start="1013.29" dur="5.94">something like the back I I don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1015.36" dur="5.97">any kind of human vibe from it so when I</text>
  <text start="1019.23" dur="6.93">saw this going around I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1021.33" dur="7.53">thinking who got paid off who I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1026.16" dur="7.13">know what was going on that made them</text>
  <text start="1028.86" dur="7.88">begin debunking this were they trying to</text>
  <text start="1033.29" dur="6.37">somebody out there fitting into that</text>
  <text start="1036.74" dur="5.08">conspiracy debunking narrative if you</text>
  <text start="1039.66" dur="4.74">will all that info more science at our</text>
  <text start="1041.82" dur="4.44">place so I don&amp;#39;t know I just I still</text>
  <text start="1044.4" dur="4.86">think this thing&amp;#39;s alien I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1046.26" dur="4.83">a lot more to this story than what</text>
  <text start="1049.26" dur="2.4">they&amp;#39;re telling us and just look at that</text>
  <text start="1051.09" dur="3.81">thing man</text>
  <text start="1051.66" dur="5.52">that thing is a freaking alien tellin ya</text>
  <text start="1054.9" dur="4.68">and crazy enough I mean this isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1057.18" dur="4.71">only being that&amp;#39;s been found on planet</text>
  <text start="1059.58" dur="4.23">earth here and not the only evidence we</text>
  <text start="1061.89" dur="3.6">have of course of extraterrestrials we</text>
  <text start="1063.81" dur="4.23">have all kinds of sightings and crop</text>
  <text start="1065.49" dur="5.1">circles and experiencers and whatnot but</text>
  <text start="1068.04" dur="4.26">actual like bodies let&amp;#39;s talk bodies</text>
  <text start="1070.59" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s this one that&amp;#39;s been found</text>
  <text start="1072.3" dur="7.77">there&amp;#39;s the what the Nazca mummies that</text>
  <text start="1075.75" dur="5.91">have been studied and reported on over</text>
  <text start="1080.07" dur="3.51">the past couple years I&amp;#39;ve even heard</text>
  <text start="1081.66" dur="4.08">stories of other beings that haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1083.58" dur="3.69">been brought forth to the public yet and</text>
  <text start="1085.74" dur="4.1">they&amp;#39;re being hidden and then we have</text>
  <text start="1087.27" dur="5.58">testimony of people like Emory Smith who</text>
  <text start="1089.84" dur="5.65">and he actually take this picture he</text>
  <text start="1092.85" dur="5.19">might have taken this picture um he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1095.49" dur="5.73">has testimony of actually dissecting</text>
  <text start="1098.04" dur="5.88">freaking tissue of extraterrestrial</text>
  <text start="1101.22" dur="5.31">beings for classified corporate projects</text>
  <text start="1103.92" dur="5.64">so again all kinds of evidence guys</text>
  <text start="1106.53" dur="4.29">truly expand your thinking I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1109.56" dur="4.38">lately a few people having a tough time</text>
  <text start="1110.82" dur="6.06">fitting the UFO ET narratives into their</text>
  <text start="1113.94" dur="6.06">worldviews but truly truly expand</text>
  <text start="1116.88" dur="5.58">thinking in every regard and in merging</text>
  <text start="1120" dur="5.85">science and spirituality and religion</text>
  <text start="1122.46" dur="5.1">and history and all these components so</text>
  <text start="1125.85" dur="3.18">let&amp;#39;s do that and really expanding our</text>
  <text start="1127.56" dur="4.05">thinking in all those areas is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1129.03" dur="3.84">gonna be necessary to find out what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1131.61" dur="3.51">going on here because there&amp;#39;s only one</text>

  <text start="1135.12" dur="5.46">we have me you everybody else out there</text>
  <text start="1137.16" dur="6">are perspectives on that our singular</text>

  <text start="1143.16" dur="4.65">can call them it&amp;#39;s all of what we&amp;#39;ve had</text>

  <text start="1155.19" dur="4.86">we can and that&amp;#39;s gonna require a lot of</text>
