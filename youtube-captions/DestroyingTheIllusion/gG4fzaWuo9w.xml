  <text start="102.22" dur="3.84">her name is amy robach and she was</text>
  <text start="104.32" dur="3.659">having a conversation with her producer</text>

  <text start="122.5" dur="5.34">to go over three years ago she talks</text>
  <text start="125.71" dur="4.35">about how the upper management at ABC</text>
  <text start="127.84" dur="4.83">killed the story and how there was even</text>
  <text start="130.06" dur="4.11">pressure from the Buckingham Palace of</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="3.33">course Prince Andrew over there they</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="4.379">want to protect him pressure from the</text>
  <text start="136" dur="3.93">Buckingham Palace to quash the story at</text>
  <text start="138.549" dur="3.121">first I thought this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="3.48">somewhat of a nothing burger but after</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="3.48">digging into this story listening what</text>
  <text start="143.41" dur="3.63">she had to say and seeing the reaction</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="3.27">spread around the internet I realized</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="3.81">that this is huge</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="4.83">Project Veritas is going outlet by</text>
  <text start="150.85" dur="4.139">outlet exposing each one and the</text>
  <text start="153.25" dur="4.62">conversation in this video is going to</text>
  <text start="154.989" dur="4.261">seriously open some eyes I&amp;#39;m also seeing</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="4.47">people start a boycott Disney</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="5.76">conversation because Disney owns ABC I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="4.8">all for that how ironic a Disney media</text>
  <text start="165.01" dur="4.59">company covering for elite paedophile</text>
  <text start="167.14" dur="4.2">things that make you go move anyway the</text>
  <text start="169.6" dur="3.6">most interesting part of this story to</text>
  <text start="171.34" dur="4.23">me wasn&amp;#39;t what was breaking in regards</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="4.23">to ABC Management quashing the story but</text>
  <text start="175.57" dur="4.29">it was where the conversation with this</text>
  <text start="177.43" dur="4.529">ABC anchor ended up going to in this</text>
  <text start="179.86" dur="4.079">full video amy robach admitted</text>
  <text start="181.959" dur="4.53">that she a hundred percent thinks that</text>
  <text start="183.939" dur="4.711">Jeffrey Epstein did not commit suicide</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="4.021">of course anybody with a working brain</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="3.419">cell in their head also thinks that she</text>
  <text start="190.51" dur="3.66">goes on to say when you look at all the</text>
  <text start="192.069" dur="4.521">powerful men that were on that Island</text>
  <text start="194.17" dur="5.28">Jeffrey Epstein Island he made a living</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="4.81">blackmailing people she said these words</text>
  <text start="199.45" dur="4.289">and she also said in this hot mic</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="4.53">footage Clinton specifically she didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.739" dur="4.711">say Trump no mention of Trump but she</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="4.32">definitely said and referred to Bill</text>
  <text start="208.45" dur="4.319">Clinton so just hearing these things</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="5.28">being spoken from an establishment media</text>
  <text start="212.769" dur="4.231">anchor this is going to seriously make</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="3.299">the gears in some people&amp;#39;s head start</text>
  <text start="217" dur="4.2">turning me personally I&amp;#39;m not surprised</text>
  <text start="218.829" dur="4.8">at ABC quashed an Epstein story over</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="5.129">three years ago but the important thing</text>
  <text start="223.629" dur="4.5">is millions of people out there who</text>
  <text start="226.329" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t research this sort of stuff as</text>
  <text start="228.129" dur="4.621">much as you and I might they might be</text>
  <text start="231.189" dur="4.261">surprised by this and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="4.739">important awakening step by step so this</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="3.569">Veritas story is definitely impacting</text>
  <text start="237.489" dur="3.571">the collective consciousness today so</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="4.08">much so that Twitter had to suppress the</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="4.379">hashtag it was getting hundreds of</text>
  <text start="243.099" dur="5.04">thousands of mentions and Twitter wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.439" dur="5.311">even making a trend so that&amp;#39;s that now</text>
  <text start="248.139" dur="4.38">moving on into cues drops we only got a</text>
  <text start="250.75" dur="4.29">few so this would be quick but first I</text>
  <text start="252.519" dur="5.34">gotta say man waking up over the weekend</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="5.129">seeing Mike you drop a plight up seeing</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="4.53">queue map dot pub aggregate some new</text>
  <text start="260.169" dur="3.901">queue posts that was a good feeling to</text>
  <text start="262.389" dur="3.931">have again I think you can agree with me</text>
  <text start="264.07" dur="4.14">ok getting into these drops the first</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="4.71">two that we have here were from Saturday</text>

  <text start="271.03" dur="5.94">and they came up just a couple of hours</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="4.47">after 8:00 Coon went live there at 8:00</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="4.199">in the morning on Saturday and I thought</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="3.9">Q might take a few days</text>
  <text start="281.169" dur="3.571">let ate Coon get smoothed out a little</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="4.95">bit before they started posting again</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="5.76">but no they posted pretty much right</text>
  <text start="288.25" dur="4.86">away and these first two drops looked to</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="5.099">be some security tests that Q is doing</text>
  <text start="293.11" dur="5.88">with the new site maybe testing devices</text>
  <text start="295.599" dur="5.611">or testing eight Coon and then we get to</text>

  <text start="483.84" dur="7.02">context having to do with submarines</text>
  <text start="487.139" dur="6.93">actually and rig for red is a term</text>
