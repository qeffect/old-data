  <text start="181.769" dur="4.541">so and going through you know I was</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="3.119">going through some accusal drops just</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="3.53">this morning seeing everything they had</text>
  <text start="187.959" dur="4.111">to say about Assange and WikiLeaks and</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="5.02">whatnot and there&amp;#39;s been multiple you</text>
  <text start="192.07" dur="7.53">know multiple drops from Q&amp;#39;s saying we</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="6.57">have the source and again q giving us</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="5.01">another drop just this morning saying we</text>
  <text start="201.43" dur="6.21">have the source so that suggests to me</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="5.43">that everything is planned you know this</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="5.61">this extradition is planned</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="4.86">I believe Trump was even asked about</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="3.299">Julian Assange and he said he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="4.91">leave that whole thing up to attorney</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="5.25">General William bar so there you go</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="7.48">William bar</text>
  <text start="221.799" dur="7.41">it&amp;#39;s seeming to be very crucial in the</text>
  <text start="227.29" dur="4.47">white hats plans and the alliance&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.209" dur="5.28">plans and Julian Assange now entering</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="5.4">the picture with Q saying we have the</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="5.641">source very excited to see if discovery</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="4.919">will lead anywhere and this also leads</text>
  <text start="240.13" dur="3.81">me to talking about WikiLeaks I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="242.079" dur="3.991">seeing WikiLeaks tweet this morning and</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="3.66">WikiLeaks has been putting out a lot of</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="4.59">tweets about Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="247.6" dur="5.82">I also saw one tweet where WikiLeaks was</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="5.13">saying that all these organizations even</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="5.49">the CIA are attacking Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="5.939">so if WikiLeaks was compromised by the</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="6.21">CIA those things are exactly what I</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="5.071">would expect them to do you know deflect</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="4.019">say oh it&amp;#39;s the CIA after</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="5.64">sighs well did WikiLeaks get compromised</text>
  <text start="269.139" dur="6.09">by the CIA it really seemed in the</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="5.789">middle of last year 2018 that WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="275.229" dur="4.321">Twitter did a big 180 and that was about</text>
  <text start="278.229" dur="5.011">the same time that Julian Assange went</text>
  <text start="279.55" dur="5.67">dark off Twitter so seems to me seems to</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="4.139">me personally that WikiLeaks did get</text>
  <text start="285.22" dur="2.909">compromised by some sort of rogue</text>
  <text start="287.379" dur="2.97">intelligence</text>
  <text start="288.129" dur="3.841">I don&amp;#39;t think WikiLeaks is really all</text>
  <text start="290.349" dur="2.011">that connected to Julian Assange these</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="3.99">days</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="7.429">and I got to be very careful with what</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="6.48">you hear from WikiLeaks as well so</text>
  <text start="299.789" dur="5.111">there&amp;#39;s that and then a lot of people</text>
  <text start="302.44" dur="4.8">saying optics absolutely we have some</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="5.579">quite a few thinkers here understanding</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="5.519">optics and things you know what it looks</text>
  <text start="310.479" dur="5.731">like isn&amp;#39;t always what it actually is</text>
  <text start="312.759" dur="5.46">for very good reasons sometimes the good</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="5.009">guys need to look like bad guys for</text>
  <text start="318.219" dur="4.651">certain reasons sometimes they make the</text>
  <text start="321.219" dur="3.66">bad guys look like good guys for certain</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="3.57">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of clutter gray</text>
  <text start="324.879" dur="6.001">in this world not not black-and-white</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="10.11">but gray its world a spin that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="7.529">Thank You Sara I appreciate it uh haha</text>

  <text start="673.61" dur="4.71">for a queue that was in the PDF file</text>
  <text start="676.46" dur="5.58">that WikiLeaks put out in January of</text>

  <text start="723.89" dur="6.21">in 2017 and the first half of 2018 it</text>
  <text start="728.63" dur="4.8">didn&amp;#39;t seem like WikiLeaks was</text>
  <text start="730.1" dur="6.93">compromised but then come about June</text>
  <text start="733.43" dur="6.21">2018 WikiLeaks started promoting attack</text>
  <text start="737.03" dur="4.68">articles on cue WikiLeaks tweeted a mini</text>
  <text start="739.64" dur="4.56">pressed news.com article that was</text>
  <text start="741.71" dur="6.45">attacking cue and that&amp;#39;s when it seemed</text>
  <text start="744.2" dur="5.67">like wiki League so very early on we did</text>
  <text start="748.16" dur="3.72">have what we could call cue proofs or</text>
  <text start="749.87" dur="5.4">confirmations even between WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="751.88" dur="4.86">thank you but now of course WikiLeaks</text>

  <text start="836.75" dur="5.97">amante in like 3 or 4 days cutting down</text>
  <text start="839.72" dur="5.64">on my caffeine woke dolphins and woke</text>
  <text start="842.72" dur="5.309">humans oh man when I was swimming</text>
  <text start="845.36" dur="4.95">yesterday which swimming in the ocean it</text>
  <text start="848.029" dur="5.16">opened an ocean it was choppy man it was</text>
  <text start="850.31" dur="3.44">choppy waters yesterday&amp;#39;s boat rocking</text>
  <text start="853.189" dur="5.13">everywhere</text>
  <text start="853.75" dur="9.759">swimmin in the ocean I heard the sonar I</text>
  <text start="858.319" dur="6.841">heard the dolphin sonar and I didn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="863.509" dur="4.26">confused me at first because I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="865.16" dur="4.049">expecting it I heard this ping when I</text>
  <text start="867.769" dur="3.69">swimming in the ocean and I got back up</text>
  <text start="869.209" dur="4.011">and I was talking to one of the people</text>
  <text start="871.459" dur="4.62">on the boat there I&amp;#39;m like is it no</text>
  <text start="873.22" dur="7.15">kiddin humans here sonar from dolphins</text>
  <text start="876.079" dur="6.51">is that normal and apparently I was told</text>
  <text start="880.37" dur="5.31">that humans can actually hear about 10</text>
  <text start="882.589" dur="4.68">to 15 percent of a dolphin sonar you</text>
  <text start="885.68" dur="5.759">know of course our hearing isn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="887.269" dur="6.601">theirs but we can hear a slight spectrum</text>
  <text start="891.439" dur="4.921">of it and it&amp;#39;s incredible you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.87" dur="4.259">basically a form of telepathic</text>
  <text start="896.36" dur="5.3">communication because you have a</text>
  <text start="898.129" dur="6.69">conscious being in a dolphin emitting</text>
  <text start="901.66" dur="4.63">resonance and mating frequencies and you</text>
  <text start="904.819" dur="3.091">have another conscious being</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="3.419">intercepting that of course I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="4.409">know what the heck you were</text>
  <text start="909.709" dur="6.591">communicating but hey I mean imagine</text>
  <text start="912.319" dur="6.481">you&amp;#39;re talking to some sort of et being</text>
  <text start="916.3" dur="4.93">extraterrestrial you know they talk</text>
  <text start="918.8" dur="5.49">through this sort of form they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="921.23" dur="4.14">verbalize quite this much they talk much</text>
  <text start="924.29" dur="4.169">more through telepathy</text>
  <text start="925.37" dur="4.98">so it&amp;#39;s some practice right there all</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="3.661">right</text>
  <text start="930.35" dur="3.12">let&amp;#39;s see what else is going on I wanted</text>
  <text start="932.12" dur="3.75">to touch on with you guys how about that</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="5.07">black hole photograph I did want to</text>
  <text start="935.87" dur="7.14">touch on that because it seems absurd to</text>
  <text start="938.54" dur="6.12">me that we also had an Israeli</text>
  <text start="943.01" dur="2.7">spacecraft crash on the moon today I</text>
  <text start="944.66" dur="2.49">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys heard about that</text>
  <text start="945.71" dur="4.98">I just thought about half an hour ago</text>
  <text start="947.15" dur="5.49">but how about that black hole photograph</text>
  <text start="950.69" dur="3.39">I mean they wasted how many dollars how</text>
  <text start="952.64" dur="4.08">many millions of dollars to get a</text>
  <text start="954.08" dur="6.18">photograph of a black hole that was</text>
  <text start="956.72" dur="5.73">blurry look like they took it with a old</text>
  <text start="960.26" dur="5.87">cellphone I mean what a waste of money</text>
  <text start="962.45" dur="8.24">not just that but black holes themselves</text>
  <text start="966.13" dur="6.91">there&amp;#39;s a lot of science out there that</text>
  <text start="970.69" dur="3.88">combats that mainstream science it</text>
  <text start="973.04" dur="3.78">combats that standard model physics</text>
  <text start="974.57" dur="4.94">pretty well and was it really a black</text>
  <text start="976.82" dur="6.39">hole we saw or was it some sort of</text>
  <text start="979.51" dur="6.34">plasma anomaly like a plasma torus right</text>
  <text start="983.21" dur="4.35">so sometimes I think these mainstream</text>
  <text start="985.85" dur="4.95">scientists don&amp;#39;t really know what</text>
  <text start="987.56" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re looking at and they just think</text>
  <text start="990.8" dur="3.39">they know what they&amp;#39;re looking apps they</text>
  <text start="992.09" dur="4.65">attach a name to it that sounds familiar</text>
  <text start="994.19" dur="4.2">to them and they throw it out throw that</text>
  <text start="996.74" dur="3.87">out there because it confirms their</text>
  <text start="998.39" dur="4.41">beliefs you know they&amp;#39;re just making</text>
  <text start="1000.61" dur="3.3">things up it makes them feel good like</text>
  <text start="1002.8" dur="4.59">oh I have the answer</text>
  <text start="1003.91" dur="5.46">throw it out there there&amp;#39;s that oh the</text>
  <text start="1007.39" dur="3.93">early spacecraft crashing on the moon</text>
  <text start="1009.37" dur="3.87">quite frankly I&amp;#39;ve had some people ask</text>
  <text start="1011.32" dur="3.72">me about that I think it might be an</text>
  <text start="1013.24" dur="3.9">honest engine failure that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="1015.04" dur="3.78">news is reporting and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1017.14" dur="5.76">surprised if it was an honest engine</text>
  <text start="1018.82" dur="5.7">failure but you know weird weird stuff</text>
  <text start="1022.9" dur="4.65">is trying to photograph the backside of</text>
  <text start="1024.52" dur="4.2">the moon I think it did photograph the</text>
  <text start="1027.55" dur="2.88">backside of the moon and then it crashed</text>
  <text start="1028.72" dur="6.989">so I&amp;#39;ll be looking out for more details</text>
  <text start="1030.43" dur="8.07">on that and also something else slip in</text>
  <text start="1035.709" dur="4.471">my mind here but it&amp;#39;s been busy it&amp;#39;s</text>
