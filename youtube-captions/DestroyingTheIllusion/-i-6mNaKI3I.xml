  <text start="178.5" dur="8.459">hedge putin reportedly ready for deep</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="7.049">concessions seeks deal with trump now of</text>
  <text start="186.959" dur="4.471">course after the whole syria incident a</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="4.811">few days ago there was a lot of saber</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="4.33">rattling all the sides at least on the</text>
  <text start="194.02" dur="4.23">superficial the mainstream level we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="4.2">putting fingers and saying oh don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="198.25" dur="3.51">do it again we&amp;#39;re not gonna do anything</text>
  <text start="199.96" dur="3.12">but don&amp;#39;t you do it again alright that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="3.81">basically was Putin was saying at least</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="6.03">and now Putin&amp;#39;s saying oh let&amp;#39;s seek a</text>
  <text start="205.57" dur="5.73">deal Trump and this is another piece of</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="5.01">evidence that makes me believe that that</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="5.31">serious strike had the full complicity</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="5.13">of Russia of Syria they knew what was</text>
  <text start="216.61" dur="6.71">going on and when the American</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="7.64">administration chose to strike it was</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="6.37">for public reasons they used the</text>
  <text start="226.89" dur="5.32">phosphide chemical attack as the excuse</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="6.09">but then they secretly went into Syria</text>
  <text start="232.21" dur="5.31">and their operation had much different</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="4.62">means than on the public surface they</text>
  <text start="237.52" dur="5.67">claimed so here we go guys Russia is</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="5.28">saying hey let&amp;#39;s seek a deal with Trump</text>
  <text start="243.19" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s good news of course Russia is</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="5.49">always pictured to be the boogeyman by</text>
  <text start="248.62" dur="4.02">corporate media but I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.17" dur="3.66">doing some good things guys and I think</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="4.409">like I keep saying Trump and Putin are</text>

  <text start="435.25" dur="3.93">is a really odd place for this to happen</text>
  <text start="436.9" dur="5.39">I&amp;#39;m not saying it can&amp;#39;t happen there but</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="6.69">for this to happen in Russia you know</text>

  <text start="464.02" dur="3.33">unconsciously unknowingly</text>
  <text start="465.4" dur="4.98">and there&amp;#39;s technologies there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.35" dur="6.39">satellite mobile technologies where they</text>
  <text start="470.38" dur="4.89">can actually insert thoughts and</text>
  <text start="473.74" dur="4.23">programs into people&amp;#39;s consciousness</text>

  <text start="616.269" dur="4.831">going more global and glow more global</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="3.57">so there&amp;#39;s nothing but good news for</text>
  <text start="621.1" dur="4.469">those things happening and I look at</text>
  <text start="622.54" dur="6.63">this one this one is awesome it was a</text>
  <text start="625.569" dur="6.811">literal live footage live feed on</text>
  <text start="629.17" dur="7.649">Facebook of some vacationers in Baja</text>
  <text start="632.38" dur="7.379">California who saw a lot of lights some</text>
  <text start="636.819" dur="5.161">like five to eight lights over the ocean</text>
  <text start="639.759" dur="3.931">and I&amp;#39;ll link this Collective evolution</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="3.24">article down below you can see their</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="3.17">picture of it they have them all circled</text>
  <text start="645.22" dur="5.489">looks like there was about eight or nine</text>
  <text start="646.86" dur="6.279">lights there and it was live streamed</text>
  <text start="650.709" dur="4.44">which was the awesome part of it and you</text>
  <text start="653.139" dur="3.81">really got to hear the reaction of the</text>
  <text start="655.149" dur="3.69">people so you knew it wasn&amp;#39;t fake that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.949" dur="4.82">a big way you can tell is in the</text>
  <text start="658.839" dur="5.041">reaction of the actual people you know</text>
  <text start="661.769" dur="3.731">ninety nine percent of people in that</text>
  <text start="663.88" dur="5.04">instance of seeing lights in the sky</text>
  <text start="665.5" dur="5.43">especially if they&amp;#39;re common folk on</text>
  <text start="668.92" dur="4.469">vacation in Baja California they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.93" dur="4.17">gonna be like holy damn I that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="673.389" dur="4.081">some crazy stuff going on there and</text>
  <text start="675.1" dur="4.919">there&amp;#39;s gonna be some actual passion and</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="5.429">emotion and surprised and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="680.019" dur="4.17">what we saw in this live stream which</text>
  <text start="682.899" dur="2.79">was awesome and it was actually live</text>
  <text start="684.189" dur="3.96">stream so it was neat people were</text>
  <text start="685.689" dur="6.421">getting to watch it and whatnot and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.149" dur="6.511">very clear that one pops up two pops up</text>
  <text start="692.11" dur="5.64">three four pop up and over the course of</text>
  <text start="694.66" dur="4.89">about ten minutes up to five like I said</text>
  <text start="697.75" dur="4.56">eight or nine of them all pop up in that</text>
  <text start="699.55" dur="4.8">one long string and boom mass sighting</text>
  <text start="702.31" dur="4.35">right there so there&amp;#39;s another one I</text>
  <text start="704.35" dur="4.169">mean a lot of people especially that</text>
  <text start="706.66" dur="3.81">follow this channel I know I get people</text>
  <text start="708.519" dur="5.76">from all across the board all across the</text>
  <text start="710.47" dur="6.15">political and spiritual and whatnot</text>
  <text start="714.279" dur="3.151">spectrum that follow me but some people</text>
  <text start="716.62" dur="3.209">say you know where&amp;#39;s the evidence</text>
  <text start="717.43" dur="4.92">where&amp;#39;s the evidence for ETS for non</text>
  <text start="719.829" dur="6.301">terrestrial civilizations for beings out</text>
  <text start="722.35" dur="5.219">there and I just simply say look it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="726.13" dur="3.54">right there in front of your face it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="727.569" dur="7.081">everywhere in fact I might do</text>
  <text start="729.67" dur="6.69">video one of my next videos on just all</text>
  <text start="734.65" dur="3.57">the freaking evidence there is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="736.36" dur="4.38">mass sightings everywhere there&amp;#39;s crop</text>
  <text start="738.22" dur="4.41">circles there&amp;#39;s evidence in ancient</text>
  <text start="740.74" dur="7.29">paintings ancient scriptures you can go</text>
  <text start="742.63" dur="7.53">have your own your own experience seeing</text>
  <text start="748.03" dur="5.49">things in the sky if you set the</text>
  <text start="750.16" dur="4.86">intention out there and go find it so</text>
  <text start="753.52" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s evidence everywhere and this is</text>
  <text start="755.02" dur="3.39">a neat video it&amp;#39;s just a real neat video</text>
  <text start="756.7" dur="4.05">I wanted to show and one more thing on</text>
  <text start="758.41" dur="3.87">this though you know when you see</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="3.54">something in the sky that&amp;#39;s anomalous</text>
  <text start="762.28" dur="4.55">like that the first question you should</text>
  <text start="764.29" dur="5.22">ask yourself is is it ours or theirs</text>
  <text start="766.83" dur="4.54">that&amp;#39;s a very logical question is it and</text>
  <text start="769.51" dur="4.26">one of our craft is it actually a</text>
  <text start="771.37" dur="7.11">man-made craft that&amp;#39;s some kind of black</text>
  <text start="773.77" dur="7.32">project technology anti-gravity mass</text>
  <text start="778.48" dur="4.65">cancellation if you will I mean a lot of</text>
  <text start="781.09" dur="4.23">these crafts can actually portal place</text>
  <text start="783.13" dur="4.14">the place Stargate around so is it a</text>
  <text start="785.32" dur="6.33">very advanced craft very classified</text>
  <text start="787.27" dur="7.74">craft that they&amp;#39;re showing for some soft</text>
  <text start="791.65" dur="5.37">disclosure purposes or whatnot or is it</text>
  <text start="795.01" dur="4.44">one of their craft and again there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.02" dur="5.13">reasons why they they cosmic beings</text>
  <text start="799.45" dur="6.24">would be coming down to get this process</text>
  <text start="802.15" dur="6.87">rolling of disclosure but I mean we can</text>
  <text start="805.69" dur="5.55">debate the whys why either a man-made</text>
  <text start="809.02" dur="4.23">craft or et craft would be coming down</text>
  <text start="811.24" dur="4.05">but first question you ask yourself ours</text>
  <text start="813.25" dur="4.38">or theirs in this case don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="815.29" dur="4.95">know could be either one ours or theirs</text>
  <text start="817.63" dur="4.53">but regardless they&amp;#39;re trying to get the</text>
  <text start="820.24" dur="3.9">disclosure ball rolling and I&amp;#39;ll kind of</text>
  <text start="822.16" dur="4.89">on that same topic let&amp;#39;s talk about NASA</text>
  <text start="824.14" dur="5.1">so NASA&amp;#39;s been wanting to launch a new</text>
  <text start="827.05" dur="5.07">what they&amp;#39;re calling exoplanet hunting</text>
  <text start="829.24" dur="4.02">telescope called test tes s it was</text>
  <text start="832.12" dur="3.87">supposed to be launched a couple days</text>
  <text start="833.26" dur="7.2">ago but that launch was delayed and now</text>
  <text start="835.99" dur="6.63">I think it&amp;#39;s taking off today sometime</text>
  <text start="840.46" dur="7.59">today possibly not sure if it&amp;#39;s up yet</text>
  <text start="842.62" dur="7.35">or not but this supposed survey</text>
  <text start="848.05" dur="4.02">satellite will monitor over 200,000</text>
  <text start="849.97" dur="4.77">stars for regular changes in brightness</text>
  <text start="852.07" dur="5.19">produced by a body passing in front of</text>
  <text start="854.74" dur="4.65">them so I mean on the mainstream level</text>
  <text start="857.26" dur="6.36">again soft disclosure you gotta ease</text>
  <text start="859.39" dur="6.42">these ideas onto people but on</text>
  <text start="863.62" dur="4.08">the more underground roofing level for</text>
  <text start="865.81" dur="3.99">those that see the real world a little</text>
  <text start="867.7" dur="4.26">more clearly this is just I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="869.8" dur="3.63">just another smokescreen like I said we</text>
  <text start="871.96" dur="2.819">know there&amp;#39;s cosmic civilizations out</text>
  <text start="873.43" dur="5.599">there we know actually they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="874.779" dur="6.06">here and for another satellite to be</text>
  <text start="879.029" dur="8.971">circling the earth looking for</text>
  <text start="880.839" dur="10.621">exoplanets yawn but there&amp;#39;s the idea of</text>
  <text start="888" dur="5.08">false disclosure false flag disclosure a</text>
  <text start="891.46" dur="3.54">half-assed disclosure as I keep calling</text>
  <text start="893.08" dur="4.11">it so always want to be on the lookout</text>
  <text start="895" dur="3.779">for that and understand they could be</text>
  <text start="897.19" dur="4.44">you know with this satellite they might</text>
  <text start="898.779" dur="4.771">be starting to seep out a lot more</text>
  <text start="901.63" dur="3.36">stories on new exoplanets this thing</text>
  <text start="903.55" dur="4.74">finds their oh here&amp;#39;s this planet with</text>
  <text start="904.99" dur="5.16">water and yada yada yada so this could</text>
  <text start="908.29" dur="3.299">play into some psychological operations</text>
  <text start="910.15" dur="3.57">somehow so it&amp;#39;s just good to be aware of</text>
  <text start="911.589" dur="4.111">and then last thing I want to show you</text>
  <text start="913.72" dur="4.95">this article out of Forbes from</text>
  <text start="915.7" dur="5.82">yesterday I&amp;#39;m just looking at it here it</text>
  <text start="918.67" dur="5.25">only has a hundred and fifty views just</text>
  <text start="921.52" dur="4.14">saw that hey if a Forbes article is only</text>
  <text start="923.92" dur="3.78">getting a hundred and fifty views these</text>
  <text start="925.66" dur="3.929">days this is why the elite are in panic</text>
  <text start="927.7" dur="5.4">mode because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re corporate</text>
  <text start="929.589" dur="5.341">propaganda nobody looks at honestly who</text>
  <text start="933.1" dur="5.07">looks at CNN anymore who actually</text>
  <text start="934.93" dur="6.029">watches CNN very few people we find</text>
  <text start="938.17" dur="5.07">actually watch CNN or read Forbes or</text>
  <text start="940.959" dur="4.591">whatnot apparently but let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="943.24" dur="5.94">dissect what they&amp;#39;re trying to sell us</text>
  <text start="945.55" dur="6.03">or tell us tell us and sell us would it</text>
  <text start="949.18" dur="4.89">be possible to cut out the useless parts</text>
  <text start="951.58" dur="7.14">of our DNA and still have a functioning</text>
  <text start="954.07" dur="8.49">cell ruminate on that for a sec I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="958.72" dur="5.85">give you three seconds so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="962.56" dur="6.33">trying to say here is that most of our</text>
  <text start="964.57" dur="5.519">DNA is junk if most of our DNA is junk</text>
  <text start="968.89" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re saying so they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="970.089" dur="6.361">assuming that it&amp;#39;s junk and does it mean</text>
  <text start="972.52" dur="6">anything wrong but if most of our DNA is</text>
  <text start="976.45" dur="3.48">junk could we in theory cut out those</text>
  <text start="978.52" dur="6.81">useless change and have a functional</text>
  <text start="979.93" dur="6.72">cell huh interesting</text>
  <text start="985.33" dur="4.259">and then they make the distinction</text>
  <text start="986.65" dur="5.429">between being non coding and coding DNA</text>
  <text start="989.589" dur="4.851">and the term junk is not necessarily</text>
  <text start="992.079" dur="4.69">junk but let&amp;#39;s see what they have to say</text>
  <text start="994.44" dur="4.73">answering that question could we cut</text>
  <text start="996.769" dur="4.591">out this non-coding DNA and still have a</text>
  <text start="999.17" dur="4.319">functional cell here they are saying in</text>
  <text start="1001.36" dur="3.3">summary which non-coding sequences we</text>
  <text start="1003.489" dur="5.13">can eliminate they don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="1004.66" dur="5.64">know they don&amp;#39;t know what DNA strands</text>
  <text start="1008.619" dur="5.34">they can eliminate and still have a</text>
  <text start="1010.3" dur="5.729">functioning being but on that same note</text>
  <text start="1013.959" dur="4.44">would they really even be able to take</text>
  <text start="1016.029" dur="4.68">out any this is kind of the arrogance</text>
  <text start="1018.399" dur="4.59">the Papa sness of science these days is</text>
  <text start="1020.709" dur="4.62">that just because they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="1022.989" dur="4.861">something they think it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="1025.329" dur="5.191">or they think it&amp;#39;s hogwash or they just</text>
  <text start="1027.85" dur="4.799">throw the ideas out this is the</text>
  <text start="1030.52" dur="5.069">arrogance of it and that so many people</text>
  <text start="1032.649" dur="4.831">think science is so advanced it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="1035.589" dur="4.171">know they call it modern medicine modern</text>
  <text start="1037.48" dur="5.78">science the miracle the marvels of it</text>
  <text start="1039.76" dur="7.529">but that&amp;#39;s complete because</text>
  <text start="1043.26" dur="6.909">mainstream science these days hardly</text>
  <text start="1047.289" dur="8.25">knows anything most of the theories most</text>
  <text start="1050.169" dur="7.98">of the excuse me the ideas they have are</text>
  <text start="1055.539" dur="4.081">just theoretical and they often put out</text>
  <text start="1058.149" dur="4.201">their own research study their own</text>
  <text start="1059.62" dur="4.5">research so it becomes this big ol wheel</text>
  <text start="1062.35" dur="3.539">of circular reasoning where they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1064.12" dur="4.14">proving what&amp;#39;s actually real they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1065.889" dur="5.01">just proving their own foundations their</text>
  <text start="1068.26" dur="6.33">own theories so it really makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1070.899" dur="4.981">and when anything comes along that makes</text>
  <text start="1074.59" dur="2.73">a lot more sense but of course is</text>
  <text start="1075.88" dur="3.36">outside the status quo they throw it</text>
  <text start="1077.32" dur="5.01">away so they&amp;#39;re throwing away the idea</text>
  <text start="1079.24" dur="7.429">of DNA here of course there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="1082.33" dur="7.26">you can research into DNA in the literal</text>
  <text start="1086.669" dur="6">time alterations the electrical</text>
  <text start="1089.59" dur="6.62">components of DNA the way DNA is a</text>
  <text start="1092.669" dur="6.431">fractal fractal antenna and how it can</text>
  <text start="1096.21" dur="5.439">harness gravity if you will and actually</text>
  <text start="1099.1" dur="4.5">cause micro gravitational effects look</text>
  <text start="1101.649" dur="4.351">into bio photons fascinating here DNA</text>
  <text start="1103.6" dur="3.689">gives us light gives off light you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1106" dur="4.169">find much of that stuff in the</text>
  <text start="1107.289" dur="5.221">mainstream media and I would imagine</text>
  <text start="1110.169" dur="4.11">that our non-coding DNA that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1112.51" dur="3.539">code our physical bodies that mainstream</text>
  <text start="1114.279" dur="3.03">science doesn&amp;#39;t understand is there for</text>
  <text start="1116.049" dur="2.641">a very particular purpose</text>
  <text start="1117.309" dur="4.23">most likely having to do with our</text>
  <text start="1118.69" dur="5.58">consciousness or some kind of outside</text>
  <text start="1121.539" dur="4.471">our meatsuit effects but of course they</text>
  <text start="1124.27" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t admit that because then that would</text>
  <text start="1126.01" dur="4.109">lead to a lot of other discoveries that</text>
  <text start="1127.6" dur="4.529">they don&amp;#39;t want out there so I</text>
  <text start="1130.119" dur="4.62">&amp;#39;we know please don&amp;#39;t cut out any of my</text>
  <text start="1132.129" dur="5.31">DNA I&amp;#39;m not gonna let you do that and I</text>
  <text start="1134.739" dur="5.4">will activate it all myself let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="1137.439" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s see what we can achieve let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="1140.139" dur="4.23">what we can potentiate in ourselves by</text>
  <text start="1142.509" dur="3.72">activating that alright guys that&amp;#39;s it</text>
