  <text start="73.18" dur="4.53">here now you haven&amp;#39;t been on my channel</text>
  <text start="75.4" dur="4.77">before I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of my audience is</text>
  <text start="77.71" dur="4.98">unfamiliar with who you who you are and</text>
  <text start="80.17" dur="5.13">what you&amp;#39;ve done I want you to discuss</text>
  <text start="82.69" dur="5.28">with me how you first got into the</text>
  <text start="85.3" dur="4.98">vaccine topic and tell everybody why</text>
  <text start="87.97" dur="4.47">you&amp;#39;re claimed even in the media that</text>
  <text start="90.28" dur="5.61">you&amp;#39;re the world&amp;#39;s number one anti faxer</text>
  <text start="92.44" dur="5.28">honey well you know Jordan today is</text>
  <text start="95.89" dur="4.05">actually kind of an anniversary for me</text>
  <text start="97.72" dur="5.22">because I say that Martin Luther King</text>
  <text start="99.94" dur="6.87">Day is the day I got read pilled 17</text>
  <text start="102.94" dur="7.5">years ago 2002 because what had happened</text>
  <text start="106.81" dur="6.93">is that my second child my son Ben</text>
  <text start="110.44" dur="5.82">I got his 18-month series of shots and</text>
  <text start="113.74" dur="6.39">then within three days of that went mute</text>
  <text start="116.26" dur="7.2">and I have another child a daughter who</text>
  <text start="120.13" dur="5.25">has a seizure disorder in autism and I</text>
  <text start="123.46" dur="3.51">haven&amp;#39;t linked it to vaccines because I</text>
  <text start="125.38" dur="4.41">think that damage happened at her</text>
  <text start="126.97" dur="6">six-month series of shots so I actually</text>
  <text start="129.79" dur="6.66">took my son to his 18-month series of</text>
  <text start="132.97" dur="4.92">shots and because I thought that the</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="4.41">doctor had missed something at my</text>
  <text start="137.89" dur="5.46">daughter&amp;#39;s six-month checkup he got run</text>
  <text start="140.86" dur="5.19">through a full developmental workout he</text>
  <text start="143.35" dur="5.01">passed with flying colors 15 20 words</text>
  <text start="146.05" dur="4.59">looking appropriately everything great</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="4.89">guesses shots I&amp;#39;m not even thinking</text>
  <text start="150.64" dur="4.86">about it three days later my wife who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.25" dur="4.68">a speech therapist tells me that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="5.31">gone mute and he&amp;#39;s started pounding his</text>
  <text start="157.93" dur="4.02">head on the table and so suddenly I you</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="4.29">know I&amp;#39;d heard this theory about</text>
  <text start="161.95" dur="6.45">vaccines and problems with kids I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="165.1" dur="6.54">put any credibility in it but to see it</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="7.86">so dramatically with my son was just</text>
  <text start="171.64" dur="7.41">startling to me and I on on the on</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="5.19">Martin Luther King Day I went out to a</text>
  <text start="179.05" dur="4.8">Barnes Noble in Oakland California and I</text>
  <text start="181.45" dur="4.2">picked up a book called unraveling the</text>
  <text start="183.85" dur="4.59">mystery of autism and pervasive</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="5.73">developmental disorder by a woman named</text>
  <text start="188.44" dur="5.73">Karen SUSE and she was talking about the</text>
  <text start="191.38" dur="5.63">gluten casein free diet and suddenly all</text>
  <text start="194.17" dur="4.76">of this made sense to me so the next day</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="5.52">both kids went on the gluten casein free</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="6.419">diet after 12 days my sense that his</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="4.769">first word again and I said it was as if</text>
  <text start="205.349" dur="5.101">I caught him as he was falling into de</text>
  <text start="207.299" dur="6.631">abyss of autism so he&amp;#39;s now 18 years old</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="6.72">he&amp;#39;s in college he&amp;#39;s an athlete he is an</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="5.1">amazing weightlifter and track star my</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="4.77">daughter who&amp;#39;s 20 years old still very</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="5.849">severely affected has trouble walking so</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="4.65">I know that something happened that I</text>
  <text start="224.879" dur="4.411">was able to reverse to my son that I</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="4.979">wasn&amp;#39;t able to reverse my daughter as of</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="4.47">yet I still think there&amp;#39;s hope I still</text>
  <text start="231.569" dur="4.381">think there&amp;#39;s things to do but kind of</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="6.3">from that moment it just said to me that</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="6.149">I needed to fight this evil and so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="3.75">really kind of dedicated my life to</text>
  <text start="242.099" dur="3.72">doing that you know even though I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="5.28">a job I&amp;#39;m a science teacher I was an</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="6.271">attorney before that and so you know</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="5.34">every day and dedicating an hour or two</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="4.5">to either writing articles I write for</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="4.89">the bull win report I was one of the</text>
  <text start="256.59" dur="6.42">founders of the website age of autism</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="6.87">and I&amp;#39;ve written a couple books and</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="5.159">anyway I take those skills of an</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="3.599">attorney and also somebody who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="4.591">science teacher because I think that</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="7.621">there&amp;#39;s these analytical skills and you</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="7.77">know I in 17 years of being an activist</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="6.66">I feel like I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot which is</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.16">how people deal with challenges and you</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="4.62">know I&amp;#39;ve really come to the conclusion</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="5.46">based on my legal background and my</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="6.3">science background that the way that we</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="6.84">produce vaccines is completely unsafe we</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="6.899">don&amp;#39;t have any legal checks really to it</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="7.98">no checks and balances so I kind of</text>
  <text start="301.889" dur="6.721">break from a lot of the vaccine safety</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="6.84">advocates because I feel like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="6.809">making a strategic mistake which is that</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="6">they think that they can&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="315.419" dur="5.28">vaccines are unsafe and we shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="5.25">using them they they think that they</text>
  <text start="320.699" dur="6.09">will be shunned and and I just say to</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="4.78">myself no you know let&amp;#39;s really make a</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="4.191">fight so that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="5.53">jokingly called myself the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.98" dur="5.16">number-one anti-vaxxer because what</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="4.62">happens is the media will say oh you</text>
  <text start="336.14" dur="5.34">guys are anti-vaxxers and the people in</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="4.23">our community will get all scared about</text>
  <text start="341.48" dur="4.47">that and they&amp;#39;ll say oh no we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="6.21">safe vaccine activists and I just say</text>
  <text start="345.95" dur="6.81">you&amp;#39;re falling into the trap the trap is</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="5.01">they call you a bad name and then you</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="4.08">fight and say like oh I&amp;#39;m not that bad</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="5.88">name and I just say well let&amp;#39;s embrace</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="7.05">that bad name yes Jordan you are a</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="6.6">conspiracy theorist can you are Gore</text>
  <text start="363.89" dur="6.51">Vidal&amp;#39;s says I look conspiracy you know</text>
  <text start="366.92" dur="5.4">I am NOT a conspiracy theorist I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="370.4" dur="5.43">conspiracy analyst</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="5.58">there you go though and then you know</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="5.85">the books that I&amp;#39;ve written have been in</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="7.05">concert with leading scientist for</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="5.61">example the first book that I wrote I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="384.95" dur="4.83">just show copy the shameless</text>
  <text start="387.29" dur="6.54">self-promotion plague which I wrote with</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="6.06">dr. Judy Mike Ovitz who is a 20 year</text>
  <text start="393.83" dur="6.81">government scientist and her work with</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="6.39">chronic fatigue syndrome and HIV and you</text>
  <text start="400.64" dur="3.36">know she published in the world&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="5.31">prestigious journal of original research</text>
  <text start="404" dur="7.46">which is science and her research led</text>
  <text start="407.54" dur="7.92">her in some certain directions which</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="7.3">were controversial and she she you know</text>
  <text start="415.46" dur="5.52">she is a what we think a good scientist</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="5.49">should be which is you follow the truth</text>
  <text start="420.98" dur="5.37">wherever it leads you and you know what</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="5.34">she came to the conclusion of is that</text>
  <text start="426.35" dur="5.15">this retrovirus said she found being</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="6.69">associated with chronic fatigue syndrome</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="7.45">with autism with cancer is is a</text>
  <text start="436.28" dur="5.61">laboratory creation it&amp;#39;s a mouse virus</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s jumped to human beings and you</text>
  <text start="441.89" dur="7.86">know she also knew from her research</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="8.37">with HIV that if you are a woman who</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="6">gives birth to which who has is infected</text>
  <text start="452.48" dur="4.92">with this a retrovirus like HIV you can</text>
  <text start="455.75" dur="5.85">pass it down to your truck your child</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="4.86">and standard practice in HIV is that any</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="4.92">child</text>
  <text start="462.26" dur="7.32">born to a mother who is HIV in fact it</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="6.36">immediately goes on antiretrovirals</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="5.16">because the very before a vaccination</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="4.56">because the very act of stimulus</text>
  <text start="474.74" dur="4.92">stimulating the immune system will cause</text>
  <text start="477.44" dur="3.99">the virus to replicate out of control</text>
  <text start="479.66" dur="3.96">because it hides out the cells of the</text>
  <text start="481.43" dur="5.16">immune system so the first thing she got</text>
  <text start="483.62" dur="4.86">in trouble with issue said well gee I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="4.92">studying all these women with chronic</text>
  <text start="488.48" dur="5.61">fatigue syndrome and I find that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="4.41">got a lot of kids with autism well the</text>
  <text start="494.09" dur="5.25">women have the virus let me test the</text>
  <text start="495.92" dur="6.36">kids and so out of 17 kids that she</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="5.52">tested she found 14 of them to be</text>
  <text start="502.28" dur="4.26">positive for this virus which was even</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="2.72">higher than the numbers that she found</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="4.71">in their chronic fatigue syndrome</text>
  <text start="507.58" dur="7.81">population and she said well gee just as</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="5.97">a beginning place we should be checking</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="3.93">these kids for this virus before we</text>
  <text start="517.22" dur="3.75">vaccinate it and you know that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="519.32" dur="4.14">when I came into the story when she said</text>
  <text start="520.97" dur="3.96">that I immediately contacted her and I I</text>
  <text start="523.46" dur="3.54">said you know you&amp;#39;re gonna get into a</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="5.04">lot of trouble for that and she&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="527" dur="5.4">no look I&amp;#39;ve got Senator Harry Reid as</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="4.14">one of our sponsors and he&amp;#39;s good with</text>
  <text start="532.4" dur="3.69">the family who&amp;#39;s supporting the research</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="3.54">and you know I&amp;#39;ve got all this the</text>
  <text start="536.09" dur="2.64">scientists back from me up on like that</text>
  <text start="537.65" dur="3.18">you know honey</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="3.81">it ain&amp;#39;t gonna happen you&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="540.83" dur="5.27">down and you got to be ready for that</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="6.66">and then what was really interesting was</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="4.81">we started up this correspondence and I</text>
  <text start="549.2" dur="4.05">did a little bit more research and I</text>
  <text start="550.91" dur="5.04">said well okay I understand that the</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="5.55">vaccinations may stimulate a virus</text>
  <text start="555.95" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s already there but where the heck</text>
  <text start="558.8" dur="3.84">did the virus come from and so in</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="4.83">chronic fatigue syndrome is really</text>
  <text start="562.64" dur="5.34">interesting because we actually have a</text>
  <text start="565.7" dur="5.04">really good starting place for the first</text>
  <text start="567.98" dur="7.38">outbreak of chronic fatigue syndrome</text>
  <text start="570.74" dur="6.63">it happened in 1934 1935 among a hundred</text>
  <text start="575.36" dur="4.43">and ninety-eight doctors and nurses at</text>
  <text start="577.37" dur="5.88">the Los Angeles County General Hospital</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="5.77">during a polio epidemic I do a little</text>
  <text start="583.25" dur="4.11">bit more research and I say find out</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="5.13">that they were given an early polio</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="4.29">vaccine which was grown in mouse brain</text>
  <text start="590.69" dur="3.54">tissues</text>
  <text start="591.65" dur="3.51">okay so suddenly it which was a new</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="3.48">innovation that</text>
  <text start="595.16" dur="5.07">time so do a little bit more research</text>
  <text start="597.71" dur="4.38">and I find out that you know the people</text>
  <text start="600.23" dur="3.21">who did that scenes back in the 30s I</text>
  <text start="602.09" dur="2.34">think actually understood things a</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="3.45">little bit better because they</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="4.71">understood hey this is a big challenge</text>
  <text start="606.89" dur="5.07">so we got to make sure their immune</text>
  <text start="609.14" dur="5.16">system is really strong so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="5.04">give them an immune system booster and</text>
  <text start="614.3" dur="6.06">that immune system booster is preserved</text>
  <text start="617" dur="6">with thimerosal which is mercury so even</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="5.06">from the first beginnings of it we had</text>
  <text start="623" dur="5.04">this idea of you know animal</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="4.45">retroviruses because they grow it in</text>
  <text start="628.04" dur="4.68">animal tissues and they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="629.87" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s coming back um and they have by</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="5.64">Marisa Lori and you know aluminum all</text>
  <text start="635.33" dur="4.32">this other sort of bad stuff so you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="638.36" dur="3.9">got this combination so what was really</text>
  <text start="639.65" dur="4.74">interesting in why I just have continued</text>
  <text start="642.26" dur="4.71">to be such an advocate for Judi mining</text>
  <text start="644.39" dur="4.29">events is I presented this information</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="3.78">to her and I said you know Judy this is</text>
  <text start="648.68" dur="4.47">what it looks like to me it looks like</text>
  <text start="650.75" dur="5.13">the beginning of your disease was from</text>
  <text start="653.15" dur="4.8">an early polio vaccine you know here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="655.88" dur="4.89">the information it&amp;#39;s all published</text>
  <text start="657.95" dur="6.24">research tell me if I&amp;#39;m wrong and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="660.77" dur="5.49">like no that&amp;#39;s right and and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.19" dur="3.96">fearless in that way that you know you</text>
  <text start="666.26" dur="4.47">present her information so I always</text>
  <text start="668.15" dur="4.53">jokingly say that you know I remember</text>
  <text start="670.73" dur="5.01">the first time we sat down for dinner</text>
  <text start="672.68" dur="6.84">which was to autism one in in May of</text>
  <text start="675.74" dur="10.08">2010 and I said they&amp;#39;re going to come</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="9.15">after you fast forward you know year and</text>
  <text start="685.82" dur="5.97">a half later she&amp;#39;s arrested and put in</text>
  <text start="688.67" dur="6.63">jail for five days and owner researchers</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="5.82">taken from her so you know but you know</text>
  <text start="695.3" dur="5.1">I always say they choose the American</text>
  <text start="697.61" dur="4.32">Wakefield and since I had seen what had</text>
  <text start="700.4" dur="4.05">happened to Andy Wakefield I thought</text>
  <text start="701.93" dur="3.66">okay well maybe Andy Wakefield story</text>
  <text start="704.45" dur="4.26">would have been real a little bit</text>
  <text start="705.59" dur="5.46">different if he had a writer from the</text>
  <text start="708.71" dur="3.87">start who was putting his story out</text>
  <text start="711.05" dur="3.87">there Wow</text>
  <text start="712.58" dur="5.01">so you sound like an individual who you</text>
  <text start="714.92" dur="5.07">had direct experiences early on and</text>
  <text start="717.59" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s often what wakes people up to</text>
  <text start="719.99" dur="4.38">vaccines is having the direct experience</text>
  <text start="721.91" dur="3.99">and and it&amp;#39;s cool that you not only saw</text>
  <text start="724.37" dur="3.09">what happened to your son but you did</text>
  <text start="725.9" dur="3.06">something about it and you had another</text>
  <text start="727.46" dur="4.17">experience of getting him</text>
  <text start="728.96" dur="4.83">better yeah and working on your children</text>
  <text start="731.63" dur="5.7">so that&amp;#39;s fantastic and what also I like</text>
  <text start="733.79" dur="5.67">is that you you mentioned earlier being</text>
  <text start="737.33" dur="3.57">an intelligent individual being too able</text>
  <text start="739.46" dur="4.77">to analyze the situation we have a lot</text>
  <text start="740.9" dur="5.31">of smart people out there who they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.23" dur="3.93">very good at learning information and</text>
  <text start="746.21" dur="4.08">regurgitating that information but for</text>
  <text start="748.16" dur="3.51">you the dots connected and you started</text>
  <text start="750.29" dur="2.7">you had the courage to go down these</text>
  <text start="751.67" dur="4.26">particular paths and start connecting</text>
  <text start="752.99" dur="5.09">the dots with okay vaccines being a</text>
  <text start="755.93" dur="5.49">cause of this disease and</text>
  <text start="758.08" dur="6.19">neurodevelopmental dysfunction so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="761.42" dur="7.2">still doing the good work to educate</text>
  <text start="764.27" dur="6.36">people about that yeah and so and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="768.62" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s really been very interesting</text>
  <text start="770.63" dur="3.39">because I think what happened tonight</text>
  <text start="772.13" dur="4.86">what I really liked about what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.02" dur="5.37">doing Jordan is that you know once your</text>
  <text start="776.99" dur="4.64">eyes are open to corruption in a certain</text>
  <text start="779.39" dur="5.52">area you start to see patterns</text>
  <text start="781.63" dur="6.31">developing you know those who are trying</text>
  <text start="784.91" dur="6.12">to tell the truth get attacked you know</text>
  <text start="787.94" dur="6.78">strange things happen to them and so you</text>
  <text start="791.03" dur="6.15">know I kind of have this belief that you</text>
  <text start="794.72" dur="4.89">know since I&amp;#39;ve seen all these patterns</text>
  <text start="797.18" dur="4.35">of things that happen to people I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="799.61" dur="5.67">well let me look for those patterns so</text>
  <text start="801.53" dur="6.03">you know I have read about UFOs you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="805.28" dur="4.32">read far more about it than I have but I</text>
  <text start="807.56" dur="3.75">just find myself going like wow Jordan</text>
  <text start="809.6" dur="3.39">sounds like he&amp;#39;s talking about the same</text>
  <text start="811.31" dur="4.05">patterns of things that that would allow</text>
  <text start="812.99" dur="4.8">researchers happen to the UFO people and</text>
  <text start="815.36" dur="5.31">the free-energy people and you know the</text>
  <text start="817.79" dur="6.6">whole Q phenomenon and everything so you</text>
  <text start="820.67" dur="6.6">know I have my area of expertise and you</text>
  <text start="824.39" dur="4.32">know as we all do but it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.27" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s fascinating because I think that</text>
  <text start="828.71" dur="4.85">there&amp;#39;s this plague of a corruption</text>
  <text start="830.63" dur="8.31">that&amp;#39;s out there in so many things and</text>
  <text start="833.56" dur="7.72">I&amp;#39;m just so I&amp;#39;m so appreciative of</text>
  <text start="838.94" dur="4.68">people like you and it seems like</text>
  <text start="841.28" dur="4.89">there&amp;#39;s this new group coming around of</text>
  <text start="843.62" dur="5.43">you know people in their 20s who are</text>
  <text start="846.17" dur="4.77">talking about the truth and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="849.05" dur="5.97">been one of my frustrations about the</text>
  <text start="850.94" dur="7.88">autism community is that I feel like so</text>
  <text start="855.02" dur="6.51">many of us are terrified that you know</text>
  <text start="858.82" dur="3.759">that bad things are going to happen to</text>
  <text start="861.53" dur="3.749">us if we tell the</text>
  <text start="862.579" dur="4.8">truth and I just find myself gone like</text>
  <text start="865.279" dur="4.831">no bad things are gonna happen to you if</text>
  <text start="867.379" dur="5.161">you tell part of the truth because</text>
  <text start="870.11" dur="4.919">nobody wants to hear it so let&amp;#39;s just go</text>
  <text start="872.54" dur="5.339">all the way let&amp;#39;s do the full monty yeah</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="4.35">tell the whole truth and you know beef</text>
  <text start="877.879" dur="5.07">be honest about what you know and what</text>
  <text start="879.379" dur="5.731">you don&amp;#39;t know but you know you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="882.949" dur="5.31">sorry if it causes people to turn away</text>
  <text start="885.11" dur="4.56">from you well you know maybe don&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="888.259" dur="4.17">around sooner or later they&amp;#39;ll come</text>
  <text start="889.67" dur="4.319">around and I start to see it yeah and so</text>
  <text start="892.429" dur="3.87">you know even people who aren&amp;#39;t very</text>
  <text start="893.989" dur="5.431">close to who you know are safe vaccine</text>
  <text start="896.299" dur="5.22">people they&amp;#39;ll say well nobody will</text>
  <text start="899.42" dur="4.229">listen to you if you just say you know</text>
  <text start="901.519" dur="7.17">for example one of things that I did was</text>
  <text start="903.649" dur="7.11">I submitted a proposal to the United</text>
  <text start="908.689" dur="4.411">States government for a five-year</text>
  <text start="910.759" dur="4.29">moratorium on childhood vaccines until</text>
  <text start="913.1" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;d actually tested so things you</text>
  <text start="915.049" dur="5.25">know a lot of people go like no don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="918.019" dur="4.771">say stuff like that I&amp;#39;m like no this is</text>
  <text start="920.299" dur="5.671">a good plan and it was kind of funny</text>
  <text start="922.79" dur="6.12">because I submitted the idea to my</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="5.369">Gammons over natural news and so he</text>
  <text start="928.91" dur="4.259">thought it was a great idea so he he</text>
  <text start="931.339" dur="5.04">puts it on natural news and then he</text>
  <text start="933.169" dur="10.26">emails me back and he goes Ken I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="936.379" dur="9.93">never had such a DDoS attack on my</text>
  <text start="943.429" dur="5.46">website you know I&amp;#39;ve had my tech people</text>
  <text start="946.309" dur="5.671">look at it they say that it had been a</text>
  <text start="948.889" dur="5">state actor I think the CDC attacked my</text>
  <text start="951.98" dur="5.759">website and I&amp;#39;m actually offering a</text>
  <text start="953.889" dur="6.16">$50,000 reward for you know who did this</text>
  <text start="957.739" dur="4.14">and I&amp;#39;m like oh man man you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="960.049" dur="5.09">just trying to you know create a</text>
  <text start="961.879" dur="6.21">conversation and you know apparently I</text>
  <text start="965.139" dur="7.45">really annoy that the crap out of people</text>
  <text start="968.089" dur="6.451">sometimes yeah and I do I do the same</text>
  <text start="972.589" dur="2.31">thing we both get plenty of hate thrown</text>
  <text start="974.54" dur="3.239">our way</text>
  <text start="974.899" dur="5.25">you know the vaccine topic was one of</text>
  <text start="977.779" dur="4.14">the ones very early on that I came</text>
  <text start="980.149" dur="3.84">across that&amp;#39;s kind of how I started</text>
  <text start="981.919" dur="6.59">waking up was through health much like</text>
  <text start="983.989" dur="7.08">you and so I I read a lot about it but</text>
  <text start="988.509" dur="4.901">what I&amp;#39;m happy about is people like you</text>
  <text start="991.069" dur="4.86">who are having the courage to go all out</text>
  <text start="993.41" dur="3.15">and not go halfway with your truth</text>
  <text start="995.929" dur="2.85">telling</text>
  <text start="996.56" dur="4.529">but say here&amp;#39;s all the deep information</text>
  <text start="998.779" dur="6.451">and then I can take that and help it</text>
  <text start="1001.089" dur="6.331">with my own work that I do you know yeah</text>
  <text start="1005.23" dur="6.599">and so the other book I want to talk</text>
  <text start="1007.42" dur="7.349">about is this book which not inoculated</text>
  <text start="1011.829" dur="5.19">how science lost its ol and autism so</text>
  <text start="1014.769" dur="5.281">some of your audience may be aware of</text>
  <text start="1017.019" dur="5.43">the movie faxed from cover-up to</text>
  <text start="1020.05" dur="5.22">catastrophe about the whistleblower dr.</text>
  <text start="1022.449" dur="5.941">William Thompson it was a senior CDC</text>
  <text start="1025.27" dur="5.389">scientist who in the early 2000s they</text>
  <text start="1028.39" dur="4.799">were looking at the question of whether</text>
  <text start="1030.659" dur="4.63">earlier administration of the MMR</text>
  <text start="1033.189" dur="4.531">vaccine was leading to increased rates</text>
  <text start="1035.289" dur="4.89">of autism and what they found is that</text>
  <text start="1037.72" dur="4.469">that because what they&amp;#39;d been doing that</text>
  <text start="1040.179" dur="6.301">you know that a perfect sort of</text>
  <text start="1042.189" dur="7.47">experiment natural experiment the us</text>
  <text start="1046.48" dur="6.569">recommendations used to be that kids</text>
  <text start="1049.659" dur="6.27">would get the MMR shot after 36 months</text>
  <text start="1053.049" dur="6.36">okay so they had this large set of data</text>
  <text start="1055.929" dur="7.441">and then the recommendation changed that</text>
  <text start="1059.409" dur="5.851">they could get it for between 18 and 36</text>
  <text start="1063.37" dur="3.96">months so they had two really nice sets</text>
  <text start="1065.26" dur="4.02">of data well what they found when they</text>
  <text start="1067.33" dur="5.28">looked at the data is they found that</text>
  <text start="1069.28" dur="8.25">specifically african-american boys had</text>
  <text start="1072.61" dur="8.069">about a three-fold increase in rates of</text>
  <text start="1077.53" dur="5.3">autism in that group versus the group</text>
  <text start="1080.679" dur="7.021">who found it later they also found that</text>
  <text start="1082.83" dur="10.06">as as a population it was about double I</text>
  <text start="1087.7" dur="7.229">was point two four and this is this is</text>
  <text start="1092.89" dur="5.13">dramatic because legally anything about</text>
  <text start="1094.929" dur="5.73">point two is evidence of conservation</text>
  <text start="1098.02" dur="4.95">and I always say you know whether the</text>
  <text start="1100.659" dur="4.77">interesting things is you know this</text>
  <text start="1102.97" dur="5.73">listing the even a great science</text>
  <text start="1105.429" dur="5.671">experiment because you know of good</text>
  <text start="1108.7" dur="5.01">science a great science experiment is</text>
  <text start="1111.1" dur="6.329">you have a group of kids who get the MMR</text>
  <text start="1113.71" dur="6.089">vaccine at 18 to 36 months you get a</text>
  <text start="1117.429" dur="3.861">group that gets it after 36 months and</text>
  <text start="1119.799" dur="3.711">then you have a group that</text>
  <text start="1121.29" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t get it at all or you have a</text>
  <text start="1123.51" dur="4.02">group that gets no vaccines they had no</text>
  <text start="1125.49" dur="3.78">control it&amp;#39;s kind of like saying like</text>
  <text start="1127.53" dur="3.48">hey we&amp;#39;re gonna look at cancer rates</text>
  <text start="1129.27" dur="3.84">among a group who smokes one pack of</text>
  <text start="1131.01" dur="3.93">cigarettes a day versus a group that</text>
  <text start="1133.11" dur="5.46">smokes two packs of cigarettes a day</text>
  <text start="1134.94" dur="8.85">yeah there&amp;#39;s no smokin you know right</text>
  <text start="1138.57" dur="7.28">this seems bad so you know and if people</text>
  <text start="1143.79" dur="4.86">know the story of Beck&amp;#39;s they know that</text>
  <text start="1145.85" dur="4.69">dr. Thompson became a federal</text>
  <text start="1148.65" dur="3.36">whistleblower I remember listening to</text>
  <text start="1150.54" dur="6.6">nothing fermentation over to Congress</text>
  <text start="1152.01" dur="7.05">and so then he they did the movie Bakst</text>
  <text start="1157.14" dur="4.83">about it and I was actually working on</text>
  <text start="1159.06" dur="5.31">the same story and I actually I always</text>
  <text start="1161.97" dur="5.94">say even though it&amp;#39;s just my name on the</text>
  <text start="1164.37" dur="7.47">book inoculated it&amp;#39;s really co-written</text>
  <text start="1167.91" dur="6.27">with Brian hooker who was but he he said</text>
  <text start="1171.84" dur="4.47">look I will do everything and help you</text>
  <text start="1174.18" dur="4.29">on all of this stuff but I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1176.31" dur="4.38">anybody to be questioning my financial</text>
  <text start="1178.47" dur="3.96">motives for this so I&amp;#39;m not going to be</text>
  <text start="1180.69" dur="3.72">you know I won&amp;#39;t be on the title I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1182.43" dur="3.96">participate financially but then what I</text>
  <text start="1184.41" dur="5.52">was also able to do is I was also able</text>
  <text start="1186.39" dur="5.67">to use inoculate as a vehicle to go back</text>
  <text start="1189.93" dur="4.53">and ask the question how did we get</text>
  <text start="1192.06" dur="4.89">everything so wrong and we got</text>
  <text start="1194.46" dur="5.07">everything so wrong I think because in</text>
  <text start="1196.95" dur="4.77">1986 we passed something called the</text>
  <text start="1199.53" dur="4.71">national childhood vaccine injury Act</text>
  <text start="1201.72" dur="4.23">which moved all vaccines out of the</text>
  <text start="1204.24" dur="4.89">regular court system and put them in</text>
  <text start="1205.95" dur="4.89">this special vaccine court with rules of</text>
  <text start="1209.13" dur="4.5">evidence which are completely different</text>
  <text start="1210.84" dur="5.31">I mean you know it&amp;#39;s tough enough to</text>
  <text start="1213.63" dur="5.39">prove that a certain drug is causing</text>
  <text start="1216.15" dur="5.37">harm okay but in a regular court you get</text>
  <text start="1219.02" dur="4.6">discovery you know they have to produce</text>
  <text start="1221.52" dur="4.47">documents you know they can screw around</text>
  <text start="1223.62" dur="3.99">with you but eventually you&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="1225.99" dur="3.78">there it&amp;#39;s kind of like you know with</text>
  <text start="1227.61" dur="4.38">what Robert Kennedy recently did with</text>
  <text start="1229.77" dur="4.08">glyphosate and probably not okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1231.99" dur="4.11">been around for a long time but you know</text>
  <text start="1233.85" dur="3.9">they got a verdict and you know they got</text>
  <text start="1236.1" dur="3.6">punitive damages of a couple hundred</text>
  <text start="1237.75" dur="4.38">million dollars and now we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1239.7" dur="4.65">this really good debate on glyphosate</text>
  <text start="1242.13" dur="6.09">which I think should be thrown off the</text>
  <text start="1244.35" dur="6.36">planet right so but nothing even</text>
  <text start="1248.22" dur="3.87">remotely like that happens with vaccines</text>
  <text start="1250.71" dur="3.57">what would I also</text>

  <text start="1254.28" dur="4.38">critical is I look at this 30 year</text>
  <text start="1256.56" dur="4.35">history of how we&amp;#39;ve done this looking</text>
  <text start="1258.66" dur="6.15">at things like this Simpson wood</text>
  <text start="1260.91" dur="6.03">Conference of 2000 when actually members</text>
  <text start="1264.81" dur="5.94">of the CDC and private industry got</text>
  <text start="1266.94" dur="5.24">together at a site off of the CDC campus</text>
  <text start="1270.75" dur="3.21">because I thought it wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1272.18" dur="3.67">discoverable under Freedom of</text>
  <text start="1273.96" dur="4.29">Information Act to talk about their own</text>
  <text start="1275.85" dur="5.88">research which was showing an increase</text>
  <text start="1278.25" dur="5.67">in children with developmental disorders</text>
  <text start="1281.73" dur="4.38">as a result of the increased vaccination</text>
  <text start="1283.92" dur="5.19">schedule they tried to hide that I also</text>
  <text start="1286.11" dur="6.99">do things like I actually interviewed</text>
  <text start="1289.11" dur="6.18">the chief special master of the vaccine</text>
  <text start="1293.1" dur="4.47">court Gary Galka whets it&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="1295.29" dur="5.1">time I&amp;#39;m revealing his name on camera</text>
  <text start="1297.57" dur="4.8">because I call him special master X in</text>
  <text start="1300.39" dur="4.53">the book but what&amp;#39;s really interesting</text>
  <text start="1302.37" dur="5.22">is he actually says yeah the court is</text>
  <text start="1304.92" dur="5.28">not working the way it was intended to</text>
  <text start="1307.59" dur="5.13">work and you know he he actually has</text>
  <text start="1310.2" dur="4.53">been quite good and saying we need all</text>
  <text start="1312.72" dur="2.34">these changes but nobody will listen to</text>
  <text start="1314.73" dur="2.97">him</text>
  <text start="1315.06" dur="4.83">I also interview a Stanford law</text>
  <text start="1317.7" dur="3.84">professor who is one of the few people</text>
  <text start="1319.89" dur="3.57">who&amp;#39;s written about the vaccine court</text>
  <text start="1321.54" dur="4.35">and it you know it&amp;#39;s really interesting</text>
  <text start="1323.46" dur="4.65">because she you know says there are all</text>
  <text start="1325.89" dur="4.71">these problems with it and so you know</text>
  <text start="1328.11" dur="4.71">eventually I asked her the question so</text>
  <text start="1330.6" dur="4.44">do you think this the vaccine Court</text>
  <text start="1332.82" dur="8.37">should be abolished and she says well</text>
  <text start="1335.04" dur="9.12">that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m not qualified to say that do</text>
  <text start="1341.19" dur="6.03">you think this is kept us safe well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1344.16" dur="5.22">not qualified to say that well you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1347.22" dur="3.66">walking me right up to the point but</text>
  <text start="1349.38" dur="4.02">anymore the few academics should</text>
  <text start="1350.88" dur="5.13">actually look at this question you said</text>
  <text start="1353.4" dur="4.44">it isn&amp;#39;t working so what do you say</text>
  <text start="1356.01" dur="4.59">after it&amp;#39;s not working you either</text>
  <text start="1357.84" dur="5.07">suggest changes or you suggest it should</text>
  <text start="1360.6" dur="3.9">be abolished and so you know what I</text>
  <text start="1362.91" dur="4.23">really hope is that you know your</text>
  <text start="1364.5" dur="5.19">audience because one of the things that</text>
  <text start="1367.14" dur="5.16">I find and why I want access to your</text>
  <text start="1369.69" dur="5.64">audience so much is because your</text>
  <text start="1372.3" dur="5.55">audience really investigates things</text>
  <text start="1375.33" dur="7.11">right and I feel that like there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1377.85" dur="6.33">of your audience who I serve I&amp;#39;m making</text>
  <text start="1382.44" dur="3.09">some assumptions but I&amp;#39;m assuming that</text>
  <text start="1384.18" dur="3.69">they are young</text>
  <text start="1385.53" dur="5.82">unmarried or if they are married they</text>
  <text start="1387.87" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t yet have kids and I think that</text>
  <text start="1391.35" dur="4.62">this information is critical to get to</text>
  <text start="1393.33" dur="5.49">them before they have kids because what</text>
  <text start="1395.97" dur="6.33">I find is once you have a kid and they</text>
  <text start="1398.82" dur="5.46">have problems you&amp;#39;re too damn busy to</text>
  <text start="1402.3" dur="4.83">really be looking at these questions so</text>
  <text start="1404.28" dur="4.62">I feel like you know Here I am 55 years</text>
  <text start="1407.13" dur="5.04">old and you know I&amp;#39;m talking to you and</text>

  <text start="1414.87" dur="3.39">make good choices you know we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1416.67" dur="3.27">them to get into a situation where</text>
  <text start="1418.26" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re gonna be the one that has that</text>
  <text start="1419.94" dur="4.5">experience that alters their lives you</text>
  <text start="1422.91" dur="3.96">know not saying in a good or a bad way</text>
  <text start="1424.44" dur="5.58">but in a way that isn&amp;#39;t causes intense</text>
  <text start="1426.87" dur="6.12">struggle you know yeah yeah it is a</text>
  <text start="1430.02" dur="5.25">struggle every day with my daughter and</text>

  <text start="1503.49" dur="4.89">intelligent individuals those who notice</text>
  <text start="1505.68" dur="5.31">the patterns yeah see one thing they can</text>
  <text start="1508.38" dur="4.59">start seeing how its lines up and with</text>
  <text start="1510.99" dur="4.32">the vaccine topic that&amp;#39;s one that I just</text>
  <text start="1512.97" dur="4.29">ride away started seeing the patterns</text>
  <text start="1515.31" dur="3.989">I&amp;#39;m like it makes total sense how in</text>

  <text start="1544.139" dur="3.78">sense to me and not just that but a lot</text>
  <text start="1546.299" dur="3.69">of the hidden things I began researching</text>
  <text start="1547.919" dur="5.49">within these vaccines such as</text>
  <text start="1549.989" dur="5.611">nanoparticles Sayer Giada Green med info</text>
  <text start="1553.409" dur="4.531">released a great article a couple of</text>
  <text start="1555.6" dur="5.22">years back how studies out of Italy were</text>
  <text start="1557.94" dur="4.89">showing nanoparticles and human vaccines</text>
  <text start="1560.82" dur="3.989">they tested and not just that but</text>
  <text start="1562.83" dur="4.14">mycoplasma as well those are two things</text>
  <text start="1564.809" dur="3.87">that go often unsaid nano mark</text>
  <text start="1566.97" dur="3.6">nanoparticles and Michael plasma and</text>
  <text start="1568.679" dur="6.24">Michael plasma are you familiar with the</text>
  <text start="1570.57" dur="6.059">work of what was his name Gary wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1574.919" dur="3.99">have to look him up right now he was a</text>
  <text start="1576.629" dur="3.93">researcher out of California scientist</text>
  <text start="1578.909" dur="5.161">he was talking about his tests showing</text>
  <text start="1580.559" dur="4.891">Michael plasma in vaccines yeah well you</text>
  <text start="1584.07" dur="4.559">know it&amp;#39;s really interesting because I</text>
  <text start="1585.45" dur="6.179">I&amp;#39;ve gone down a certain Road and so you</text>
  <text start="1588.629" dur="5.191">know my kind of expertise or Neches you</text>
  <text start="1591.629" dur="4.351">know these animal retroviruses because</text>
  <text start="1593.82" dur="5.339">the whole theory of vaccination is that</text>

  <text start="1599.159" dur="3.72">Nicholson dr. Garth Nicholson yes yeah</text>
  <text start="1601.59" dur="2.669">everybody out there I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1602.879" dur="4.11">mentioned him on my channel much but</text>
  <text start="1604.259" dur="4.591">then testimony is great it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1606.989" dur="4.201">very red and pilling very mind-blowing</text>
  <text start="1608.85" dur="4.529">yeah and so you know it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1611.19" dur="5.28">interesting because what I say is okay</text>
  <text start="1613.379" dur="5.67">here&amp;#39;s the theory the theory is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1616.47" dur="4.889">gonna isolate a human virus and then</text>
  <text start="1619.049" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re gonna passage it through different</text>
  <text start="1621.359" dur="4.341">species and when it comes out the other</text>
  <text start="1623.549" dur="5.49">end we&amp;#39;re gonna have a less pathogenic</text>
  <text start="1625.7" dur="5.859">virus and then that will confer some</text>
  <text start="1629.039" dur="4.921">unity I understand that that makes sense</text>
  <text start="1631.559" dur="4.98">to me what doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me or</text>
  <text start="1633.96" dur="5.25">is a liability I don&amp;#39;t think people who</text>
  <text start="1636.539" dur="5.01">consider it is what comes back without</text>
  <text start="1639.21" dur="5.37">human virus are you getting a whole</text>
  <text start="1641.549" dur="4.891">bunch of other animal viruses to which</text>
  <text start="1644.58" dur="4.839">people have never really been exposed</text>
  <text start="1646.44" dur="6.159">because you know we consume animals we</text>
  <text start="1649.419" dur="5.25">inject animals right injecting the</text>
  <text start="1652.599" dur="5.16">animals into our blood streams and</text>
  <text start="1654.669" dur="6">causing all sorts of unexpected things</text>
  <text start="1657.759" dur="5.16">to happen specifically also childhood</text>
  <text start="1660.669" dur="4.68">cancers I mean childhood cancers have</text>
  <text start="1662.919" dur="5.31">exploded like crazy and so you know I</text>
  <text start="1665.349" dur="5.31">find myself going like oh my god how big</text>
  <text start="1668.229" dur="5.76">is this problem you know the autism</text>
  <text start="1670.659" dur="6.33">allergies the cancers the SIDS I mean</text>
  <text start="1673.989" dur="6.451">they&amp;#39;re killing babies with these things</text>
  <text start="1676.989" dur="5.97">and you know I I understand actually how</text>
  <text start="1680.44" dur="4.079">people who are my age will say kind of</text>
  <text start="1682.959" dur="5.46">got a turn away from it because if I</text>
  <text start="1684.519" dur="5.551">really consider how screwed up it is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1688.419" dur="4.71">gonna go crazy and I don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="1690.07" dur="5.399">crazy but you know we have to do that so</text>
  <text start="1693.129" dur="4.441">you know when I look at just like that</text>
  <text start="1695.469" dur="4.471">aspect of it I say like okay well what</text>
  <text start="1697.57" dur="5.37">not all the other crap that&amp;#39;s in there</text>
  <text start="1699.94" dur="5.519">the mycoplasma you know the chemicals</text>
  <text start="1702.94" dur="5.01">you know the nanoparticles all of that</text>
  <text start="1705.459" dur="4.32">stuff and I so I finally said one of the</text>
  <text start="1707.95" dur="4.559">things that often gets said and I think</text>
  <text start="1709.779" dur="4.71">that has caused our community to react</text>
  <text start="1712.509" dur="4.95">in a way that hasn&amp;#39;t been helpful for</text>
  <text start="1714.489" dur="4.92">our cause is that people like me are</text>

  <text start="2113.64" dur="4.199">courageous thing as heated as a</text>
  <text start="2115.23" dur="4.05">candidate and start tweeting about this</text>
  <text start="2117.839" dur="4.471">because we&amp;#39;ve got a number of things</text>
  <text start="2119.28" dur="5.25">that have been going on so recently we</text>
  <text start="2122.31" dur="4.86">have Robert Kennedy jr. got an admission</text>
  <text start="2124.53" dur="5.13">from the federal government that they</text>
  <text start="2127.17" dur="5.939">haven&amp;#39;t performed any vaccine safety</text>

  <text start="2133.109" dur="6.331">the 1986 vaccine injury Act and they</text>
  <text start="2135.75" dur="5.94">were supposed to do those studies every</text>
  <text start="2139.44" dur="5.31">two years and report to Congress so that</text>
  <text start="2141.69" dur="6.05">means we&amp;#39;ve got no studies we&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="2144.75" dur="6.9">got allegations from Robert Kennedy and</text>
  <text start="2147.74" dur="8.379">Ralph Hazlehurst that when they did the</text>
  <text start="2151.65" dur="7.169">autism omnibus hearings in 2006 2008 the</text>
  <text start="2156.119" dur="5.851">government&amp;#39;s own witness a guy named dr.</text>
  <text start="2158.819" dur="5.671">Andrew Zimmerman who&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="2161.97" dur="5.129">leading autism specialists at he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="2164.49" dur="5.129">of Johns Hopkins and he actually told</text>
  <text start="2167.099" dur="6.451">the government lawyers hey look I think</text>
  <text start="2169.619" dur="5.571">at least 30% of autism is caused by</text>
  <text start="2173.55" dur="4.01">vaccines</text>
  <text start="2175.19" dur="6.57">this is the government&amp;#39;s own witness so</text>
  <text start="2177.56" dur="5.99">if he had testified in 2007-2008 we</text>
  <text start="2181.76" dur="4.35">would be in a completely different world</text>
  <text start="2183.55" dur="5.77">because when the government&amp;#39;s you know I</text>
  <text start="2186.11" dur="5.79">I say like 30% of the autism you know</text>
  <text start="2189.32" dur="5.88">this is a conservative guy and he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="2191.9" dur="5.64">30% of the autism at least is caused by</text>
  <text start="2195.2" dur="5.16">vaccines that&amp;#39;s kind of like saying well</text>
  <text start="2197.54" dur="5.55">we think that 70% of the alien</text>
  <text start="2200.36" dur="5.31">abductions are false but 30% are real</text>
  <text start="2203.09" dur="6.6">right so let&amp;#39;s talk about that 30% how</text>
  <text start="2205.67" dur="6.74">is that happy who like what&amp;#39;s so you</text>
  <text start="2209.69" dur="6.21">know we also have dr. William Thompson</text>
  <text start="2212.41" dur="6.55">even who you know quote did everything</text>
  <text start="2215.9" dur="5.04">by the book in terms of you know</text>
  <text start="2218.96" dur="4.95">becoming a federal whistleblower so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2220.94" dur="5.64">still working at the CDC so the fact</text>
  <text start="2223.91" dur="4.89">that we have you know no safety studies</text>
  <text start="2226.58" dur="4.68">on vaccines we&amp;#39;ve got the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2228.8" dur="5.73">own witness in the autism omnibus</text>
  <text start="2231.26" dur="5.37">hearing saying that when he told the</text>
  <text start="2234.53" dur="3.8">government lawyers that at least 30</text>
  <text start="2236.63" dur="5.61">percent of autism was caused by vaccines</text>
  <text start="2238.33" dur="6.61">they kicked him out of the out of the</text>
  <text start="2242.24" dur="3.3">case and now and we&amp;#39;ve got dr. William</text>
  <text start="2244.94" dur="2.82">Thompson</text>
  <text start="2245.54" dur="5.52">you know we&amp;#39;ve also got dr. Judy Michael</text>
  <text start="2247.76" dur="6.06">but so we&amp;#39;ve got four things that the</text>
  <text start="2251.06" dur="7.23">Trump if he just started tweeting about</text>
  <text start="2253.82" dur="7.14">for God&amp;#39;s sakes I mean the man is is the</text>
  <text start="2258.29" dur="5.91">greatest hope to change in our system</text>
  <text start="2260.96" dur="4.71">that we&amp;#39;ve had in 50 years and I know</text>
  <text start="2264.2" dur="4.65">that he&amp;#39;s got a lot of other stuff going</text>
  <text start="2265.67" dur="6.39">on but if he would just start tweeting</text>
  <text start="2268.85" dur="5.7">about this stuff I mean it setups so</text>
  <text start="2272.06" dur="5.7">easily for him the New York Times is</text>
  <text start="2274.55" dur="6.75">calling people like me a threat to</text>
  <text start="2277.76" dur="6.57">public health no I&amp;#39;m saving children</text>
  <text start="2281.3" dur="5.79">there so we need some presidential</text>
  <text start="2284.33" dur="4.77">leadership on this support with all this</text>
  <text start="2287.09" dur="4.16">backwards twisting that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2299.75" dur="5.01">sort of his platform to pushing these</text>
  <text start="2302.33" dur="4.68">issues forward and getting people into</text>
  <text start="2304.76" dur="3.55">the conversation so Truong needs to</text>
  <text start="2307.01" dur="4.06">follow his</text>
  <text start="2308.31" dur="4.83">and start tweeting about this he knows</text>
  <text start="2311.07" dur="5.52">what the truth is and in fact one of the</text>
  <text start="2313.14" dur="8.13">things that I cover in inoculated is how</text>
  <text start="2316.59" dur="8.03">actually on August 10th 2016 Trump had a</text>
