  <text start="198.42" dur="3.76">the media right</text>
  <text start="199.66" dur="5.55">and unsuccessfully it&amp;#39;s all backed up</text>

  <text start="205.21" dur="4.89">documentation of all of that stuff</text>

  <text start="396.27" dur="3.119">queues drops and that&amp;#39;s what really made</text>
  <text start="397.949" dur="3.541">me resonate with it I&amp;#39;m like okay this</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="6.081">these guys have some sort of information</text>
  <text start="401.49" dur="6.299">and I had come across the idea of say a</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="4.199">group of patrons or a group of white</text>
  <text start="407.789" dur="3.781">hats within the military industrial con</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="3.941">confidence trying to take down the deep</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="4.05">state I came across this idea probably</text>
  <text start="413.61" dur="3.989">back in 2011 or 12 so I had been</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="3.69">familiar with the concept for a while so</text>
  <text start="417.599" dur="4.011">that&amp;#39;s what predisposed me to</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="4.859">understanding this very helpful I</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="6.279">started researching these oil baron</text>
  <text start="424.169" dur="6.361">banking families and then I got into the</text>
  <text start="427.889" dur="4.56">technologies because these oil baron</text>
  <text start="430.53" dur="4.05">families they make a lot of money off</text>
  <text start="432.449" dur="4.801">fossil fuels a lot of money we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="5.76">talking multi trillions of dollars off</text>
  <text start="437.25" dur="5.58">of oil gas and coal okay I became very</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="4.29">interested in Nikola Tesla Tesla&amp;#39;s work</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="4.559">and many other individuals who were</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="3.839">actually yes studying these what we</text>
  <text start="447.389" dur="2.911">could call zero-point energy</text>
  <text start="448.469" dur="3.841">technologies or free energy technology</text>
  <text start="450.3" dur="4.35">for lack of a better term anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="4.169">if you want to call it that I like to</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="5.1">call it electrogravitics that&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="456.479" dur="4.921">more technical electrogravitics these</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="5.07">technologies were being studied in the</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="5.22">1930s and 40s we&amp;#39;re talking technologies</text>
  <text start="464.82" dur="4.2">that could rate our dependence on fossil</text>
  <text start="466.62" dur="3.57">fuels period you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay an</text>
  <text start="469.02" dur="2.73">electric bill anymore how would that</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="2.58">feel right you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to put gas</text>
