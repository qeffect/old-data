  <text start="23.16" dur="4.89">YouTube channel the very first video</text>

  <text start="28.05" dur="7.56">this day in 2017 so my what a ride it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="4.649">been two years of destroying the</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="5.1">illusion and it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing when</text>
  <text start="37.829" dur="5.401">you go through my channel and see not</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="4.65">only the progression of the videos I did</text>
  <text start="43.23" dur="7.829">I think the first ten videos were just</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="7.17">like awkward me and Jim cuts and random</text>
  <text start="51.059" dur="4.081">topics I really had no idea what I was</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="4.74">doing and then it gravitated eventually</text>
  <text start="55.14" dur="3.18">towards of course the white board many</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="3.03">of you who have been here since those</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="4.219">days it&amp;#39;s coming back it&amp;#39;s not gone it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="60.3" dur="5.249">coming back the white board and then</text>
  <text start="62.539" dur="5.591">jumping into the live videos I was doing</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="4.921">I did those for a while and then in 2018</text>
  <text start="68.13" dur="6.5">got terminated got terminated again and</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="6.45">then sort of shifted into doing the</text>
  <text start="74.63" dur="5.05">pre-recorded videos editing them with</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="4.769">the screen capture and all that now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="4.259">playing around with different modes and</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="5.761">methods of what I want to do still doing</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="5.22">some of the live ones white board edited</text>
  <text start="87.45" dur="2.279">videos and whatnot but man what a ride</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="6.451">it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="8.311">you know 2017 the first year was pretty</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="5.67">much me just getting my bearings meeting</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="4.68">people networking I had a bunch of</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="3.42">interviews on this channel from people</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="4.38">who I was learning from and following</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="4.65">for a long time I went to a couple of</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="5.19">Prince&amp;#39;s got invited to speak at a few</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="4.44">of them and it was good it was really</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="5.85">good and then of course 2008 team came</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="9.24">around and Q came about at the end of</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="7.92">2017 so going into 2018 it was like you</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="6.36">know channel was exploding because I was</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="4.589">one of the few people at that point in</text>

  <text start="130.649" dur="2.621">talking</text>

  <text start="133.27" dur="5.07">a thousand subscribers a day at one</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="6.96">point and then of course you know early</text>

  <text start="769.39" dur="6.33">hardcore like esoteric physics stuff I</text>
  <text start="772.29" dur="6.43">got into some Nikola Tesla research I</text>

  <text start="783.31" dur="3.57">is just as just as deep just as</text>
  <text start="786.07" dur="2.13">mind-blowing</text>
  <text start="786.88" dur="2.97">you know Nikola tests on Walter Russell</text>
  <text start="788.2" dur="3.87">were actually friends if you weren&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1102.62" dur="5.929">on it already and it was this ad that</text>

  <text start="1108.549" dur="5.38">apparently from what I&amp;#39;ve seen of it</text>
  <text start="1110.389" dur="8.01">being some sort of SG aw advertisement</text>

  <text start="1119.419" dur="3.781">watch it but when it comes to that idea</text>
  <text start="1121.19" dur="4.41">of toxic masculinity this is something I</text>

  <text start="2788.109" dur="4.481">mainstream media tries to claim that</text>
  <text start="2790.549" dur="5.071">scientists don&amp;#39;t know why but</text>
  <text start="2792.59" dur="6.78">we very well know why it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="2795.62" dur="6.54">galactic cycles galactic cycles you know</text>
  <text start="2799.37" dur="5.52">one of the biggest subjects this is even</text>

  <text start="2804.89" dur="6.48">right if you&amp;#39;re getting into galactic</text>

  <text start="2811.37" dur="4.08">UFOs and and big-picture stuff you know</text>
  <text start="2813.74" dur="3.78">this is above 40,000 feet you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2815.45" dur="4.47">into like lower Earth orbit with your</text>
  <text start="2817.52" dur="3.12">perspectives here even higher than that</text>
  <text start="2819.92" dur="4.49">you know</text>
  <text start="2820.64" dur="6.87">so galactic cycles I mean the whole</text>
  <text start="2824.41" dur="5.32">Mayan calendar long count the whole I</text>
  <text start="2827.51" dur="4.77">mean how much ancient scripture how many</text>
  <text start="2829.73" dur="4.65">different ancient scriptures do we have</text>
  <text start="2832.28" dur="3.66">that we&amp;#39;re suggesting changing of the</text>
  <text start="2834.38" dur="3.96">cycles right now and that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="2835.94" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re in in this particular time is a</text>
  <text start="2838.34" dur="5.1">changing of the cycles so a pole shift</text>
  <text start="2840.44" dur="6.87">is a symptom of that it&amp;#39;s an effect of</text>
  <text start="2843.44" dur="5.19">the cause of the shifting of the us</text>
  <text start="2847.31" dur="3.24">moving into what the Age of Aquarius</text>
  <text start="2848.63" dur="5.88">from the Age of Pisces or something that</text>
  <text start="2850.55" dur="5.88">effect so yeah man it&amp;#39;s very neat it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2854.51" dur="3.6">very neat to see and it&amp;#39;s very amazing</text>
  <text start="2856.43" dur="5.31">to see this stuff hit the mainstream</text>
  <text start="2858.11" dur="5.94">because validation is neat of course but</text>
  <text start="2861.74" dur="4.08">at the same time we&amp;#39;re moving right</text>
  <text start="2864.05" dur="3.3">along because when I started researching</text>
  <text start="2865.82" dur="3.26">all this stuff six seven years ago I</text>
  <text start="2867.35" dur="5.55">felt like I was completely alone</text>
  <text start="2869.08" dur="6.58">completely alone now here I have one</text>
  <text start="2872.9" dur="5.54">point four thousand people listening to</text>
  <text start="2875.66" dur="5.16">my crazy ass on a youtube live video so</text>
  <text start="2878.44" dur="4.87">there&amp;#39;s whole Great Awakening is amazing</text>
  <text start="2880.82" dur="5.58">stuff and this whole pole shift somebody</text>
  <text start="2883.31" dur="8.55">said man-made not man-made it is a</text>
  <text start="2886.4" dur="7.92">natural cycle and really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2891.86" dur="4.23">important right now is quickly here and</text>
  <text start="2894.32" dur="5.04">then we&amp;#39;ll do some a few questions to</text>
  <text start="2896.09" dur="5.61">finish up this hour what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2899.36" dur="4.83">important is this cycle is going to</text>
  <text start="2901.7" dur="4.98">change whether or not we&amp;#39;re ready for it</text>
  <text start="2904.19" dur="5.36">you know so the important thing is for</text>
  <text start="2906.68" dur="5.88">us to fix our</text>
  <text start="2909.55" dur="7.32">not only collectively get this deep</text>
  <text start="2912.56" dur="7.65">state what do we call it a rat&amp;#39;s did</text>
  <text start="2916.87" dur="5.56">tried get this deep state neutralized</text>
  <text start="2920.21" dur="6.15">not only do we need that collectively</text>
  <text start="2922.43" dur="6.39">get our Big Pharma systems and</text>
  <text start="2926.36" dur="5.01">oil and big financial and big tech and</text>
  <text start="2928.82" dur="4.17">shoot you know the whole full spectrum</text>
  <text start="2931.37" dur="5.31">dominance control system that we have</text>
  <text start="2932.99" dur="5.46">neutralized but we need the individual</text>
  <text start="2936.68" dur="3.39">shifts to occur as well which is</text>
  <text start="2938.45" dur="4.38">actually more important because once the</text>
  <text start="2940.07" dur="7.17">individual shifts happen then we get the</text>
  <text start="2942.83" dur="7.14">collective shifts okay so okay what do I</text>
  <text start="2947.24" dur="5.55">mean by that well back down to that</text>
  <text start="2949.97" dur="4.77">subject of food if we want Monsanto if</text>
  <text start="2952.79" dur="4.53">we want these big AG corporations to</text>
  <text start="2954.74" dur="5.43">fail we need to stop buying their</text>
  <text start="2957.32" dur="4.68">products it&amp;#39;s as easy as that you make</text>

  <text start="2974.48" dur="8.07">okay how about our energy consumption</text>
  <text start="2978.74" dur="6.18">let&amp;#39;s start actually putting our money</text>
  <text start="2982.55" dur="3.87">where our mouth is and educating</text>
  <text start="2984.92" dur="3.66">ourselves about free energy and also</text>
  <text start="2986.42" dur="3.71">finding people who are trying to develop</text>
  <text start="2988.58" dur="4.64">it and support them</text>
  <text start="2990.13" dur="5.02">that&amp;#39;s gonna change the paradigm and</text>

  <text start="3097.159" dur="8.46">documentary is difficult because that</text>
  <text start="3101.169" dur="6.37">sort of thing can&amp;#39;t really it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="3105.619" dur="3.96">have a difficult time getting on two</text>
  <text start="3107.539" dur="3.81">platforms like iTunes and Amazon the</text>
  <text start="3109.579" dur="4.23">reason why above majestic was able to</text>
  <text start="3111.349" dur="3.87">get on those platforms is because I mean</text>
  <text start="3113.809" dur="2.76">there was some hard-hitting information</text>
  <text start="3115.219" dur="3">there that I was surprised that ended up</text>
  <text start="3116.569" dur="3.75">on you know Amazon and iTunes but there</text>
  <text start="3118.219" dur="3.661">was no names named so you had to you</text>
  <text start="3120.319" dur="3.811">have to kind of walk that fine line</text>
  <text start="3121.88" dur="4.169">right there was no names that were</text>
  <text start="3124.13" dur="3.869">actually named by way of individuals or</text>
  <text start="3126.049" dur="3.24">corporations in above majestic so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3127.999" dur="3.36">what allowed it to go a little more</text>
  <text start="3129.289" dur="3.02">mainstream if I was to do a Q</text>
  <text start="3131.359" dur="4.08">documentary</text>
  <text start="3132.309" dur="5.14">you can&amp;#39;t not name names when it comes</text>
  <text start="3135.439" dur="3.6">to Q right you have to talk about the</text>
  <text start="3137.449" dur="4.89">bad actors and the corporations and name</text>
  <text start="3139.039" dur="5.58">them by name so if I do that if I do a Q</text>
  <text start="3142.339" dur="3.57">documentary it&amp;#39;s like it might end up on</text>
  <text start="3144.619" dur="3.24">those platforms it might not it might</text>
  <text start="3145.909" dur="7.68">just have to be something that you know</text>
  <text start="3147.859" dur="7.17">you put out on on free platforms like</text>
  <text start="3153.589" dur="3.27">YouTube and bit shoot and whatnot but</text>
  <text start="3155.029" dur="3.45">regardless I want to do a Q doc wherever</text>
  <text start="3156.859" dur="5.31">it ends up I don&amp;#39;t care if it it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="3158.479" dur="6.421">end up on a iTunes and Amazon and places</text>
  <text start="3162.169" dur="5.7">like that or not but Q doc would be neat</text>
  <text start="3164.9" dur="4.379">I also want to do a documentary on the</text>
  <text start="3167.869" dur="4.17">free energy like a free energy</text>
  <text start="3169.279" dur="4.02">documentary and go around interview</text>
  <text start="3172.039" dur="2.73">people see if I can get some working</text>
  <text start="3173.299" dur="4.01">devices on camera and whatnot and</text>
  <text start="3174.769" dur="5.01">actually talk about the sciences like</text>
  <text start="3177.309" dur="4.841">Tesla and Walter Russell and do we be</text>
  <text start="3179.779" dur="4.23">Larsson and whatnot but anyway yeah</text>
  <text start="3182.15" dur="2.219">about majestic - I&amp;#39;m sure in the works</text>
  <text start="3184.009" dur="5.461">at</text>
  <text start="3184.369" dur="11.011">well and question here latest voice to</text>
  <text start="3189.47" dur="7.47">skull incidences pretty much anytime you</text>
  <text start="3195.38" dur="3.959">hear of a violent attack in the</text>
  <text start="3196.94" dur="5.369">mainstream media and they say that the</text>
  <text start="3199.339" dur="5.16">person was hallucinating especially if</text>
  <text start="3202.309" dur="6.54">they claim that the person was hearing</text>
  <text start="3204.499" dur="5.55">demons it&amp;#39;s probably voice to skull</text>
  <text start="3208.849" dur="4.321">voice to God</text>
  <text start="3210.049" dur="6.98">technology voice of God technology you</text>
  <text start="3213.17" dur="5.52">know there are very advanced</text>
  <text start="3217.029" dur="5.111">technologies that they have in these</text>
  <text start="3218.69" dur="6.659">black projects and they can do an array</text>
  <text start="3222.14" dur="6.6">of different things so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="3225.349" dur="5.071">mind control especially both individual</text>
  <text start="3228.74" dur="3.72">mind control and mass collective mind</text>
  <text start="3230.42" dur="4.74">control this is why it&amp;#39;s very very</text>

  <text start="3249.829" dur="3.93">mind healthy they go hand in hand and</text>
  <text start="3251.39" dur="7.02">the healthier we keep ourselves the more</text>
  <text start="3253.759" dur="7.141">we can combat the mind and control okay</text>
  <text start="3258.41" dur="5.55">so do that</text>
  <text start="3260.9" dur="5.25">practice it educate yourself about</text>
