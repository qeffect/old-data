  <text start="18.6" dur="5.939">Oh ladies and gentlemen this is George</text>
  <text start="21.39" dur="6.18">safer and here today I have the amazing</text>
  <text start="24.539" dur="5.97">William Hawkins pleasure behavior thank</text>
  <text start="27.57" dur="4.86">you so much for coming so when did you</text>
  <text start="30.509" dur="5.521">first decide to come forward with all of</text>
  <text start="32.43" dur="9.75">your information that was actually a</text>
  <text start="36.03" dur="9.239">long time ago and I actually did not</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="6.99">feel that I was interested in wanting to</text>
  <text start="45.269" dur="9.031">express some of this because what I had</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="8.61">done in the baby was not it was not a</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="6.3">normal situation and I did make notes</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="5.88">about different meetings and I kept some</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="5.7">of the documents that I did that for</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="5.849">years that I was in the Navy but I was</text>
  <text start="66.3" dur="7.319">not interested in releasing this</text>
  <text start="69.509" dur="8.071">information it took quite a long time</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="8.121">and actually when I got later on with</text>
  <text start="77.58" dur="7.079">Bob wood he and I sort of got together</text>
  <text start="81.74" dur="6.64">he was at Douglas and I had been in</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="10.041">Douglas and it was just sort of felt</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="10.349">really the right thing to do and so we</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="6.87">we decided to put together this book</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="6.541">which was selected by extraterrestrials</text>
  <text start="101.57" dur="7.96">and we found that there was more</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="6.809">information than we could get into one</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="6.03">book so actually we were even planning</text>
  <text start="112.079" dur="5.311">on three books and I think that the</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="5.33">second book is going to be finished here</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="4.86">or within about three months fantastic</text>
  <text start="120.89" dur="3.07">that&amp;#39;s awesome</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="3.75">but what was your feeling when you first</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="3.72">found out that you and dr. wood were</text>
  <text start="126" dur="4.53">working at the same company together</text>
  <text start="127.68" dur="11.43">that was their face that was surprising</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="9.81">a friend of ours told me when I talked</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="4.31">to him</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="7.77">the subject and he suggested that I call</text>
  <text start="143.42" dur="6.64">wood this is years later and he gave me</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="6.239">Bob&amp;#39;s phone number and I called him and</text>
  <text start="150.06" dur="7.679">we talked and it was interesting that we</text>
  <text start="154.349" dur="8.371">had both worked at the same company we</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="9.301">knew all of the same talk people and yet</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="6.51">we hadn&amp;#39;t met I was there twelve and a</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="5.82">half years actually bob was there I</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="6.96">think 30 to 30 years and we hadn&amp;#39;t met</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="7.439">but we had been actually working on the</text>
  <text start="176.19" dur="6.359">same program it&amp;#39;s very interesting it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.299" dur="6.72">out to me do you know how many people</text>
  <text start="182.549" dur="8.671">were working on that program at all we</text>
  <text start="187.019" dur="12.181">actually had a secret thing tank inside</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="12.019">of DOS and I had before them I had spent</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="9.509">four years in the Navy and working on</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="8.62">extraterrestrial programs and I worked</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="6.301">at Northrop for too many years after I</text>
  <text start="211.859" dur="8.451">got out of the Navy I did work at North</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="5.3">American for a few months I worked at</text>
  <text start="220.459" dur="6.61">Lockheed and of course this is</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="4.83">interesting I have these packages which</text>
  <text start="227.069" dur="5.82">I brought to all these different</text>
  <text start="229.17" dur="9.149">companies which were many contracts and</text>
  <text start="232.889" dur="14.97">now I&amp;#39;m if this is you asked me how I</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="12.181">got to see oh really I get flashes I get</text>
  <text start="247.859" dur="6.75">flashes about information this is a</text>
  <text start="250.5" dur="7.68">little different than remote viewing my</text>
  <text start="254.609" dur="5.761">flash will be like I will see four or</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="5.94">five planets in my mind</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="5.259">then I&amp;#39;ll see one plan and I&amp;#39;ll see a</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="5.509">location</text>
  <text start="265.629" dur="6.97">and I go there okay someone&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="269.629" dur="6.29">bit like radio viewing I got one of</text>
  <text start="272.599" dur="8.16">those flashes when I was working at</text>
  <text start="275.919" dur="7.571">Lockheed over Burbank and that was that</text>
  <text start="280.759" dur="7.611">something very very important was going</text>
  <text start="283.49" dur="10.049">on over in Santa Monica in Douglas and</text>
  <text start="288.37" dur="8.59">so I quit walking I used my models to</text>
  <text start="293.539" dur="7.31">get me into the door again and so they</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="6.66">hired me into the wind tunnel group and</text>
  <text start="300.849" dur="6.431">different than getting into the other</text>
  <text start="303.62" dur="7.38">companies using the models the vice</text>
  <text start="307.28" dur="9.509">president of the company knew about my</text>
  <text start="311" dur="7.919">models so actually I put 40 of the</text>
  <text start="316.789" dur="4.47">models in a window of a department store</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="4.171">in Santa Monica and then of course</text>
  <text start="321.259" dur="4.261">Douglas gets to put all their</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="4.47">advertising about those airplanes and</text>
  <text start="325.52" dur="7.56">everything up on the background was sort</text>
  <text start="327.56" dur="8.31">of fun so him knowing about my models he</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="8.88">knew about my background in that four</text>
  <text start="335.87" dur="9.019">years of the Navy so he had me hired out</text>
  <text start="341.96" dur="7.019">of the wind tunnel into engineering and</text>
  <text start="344.889" dur="7.27">I actually didn&amp;#39;t do much in engineering</text>
  <text start="348.979" dur="5.101">I was introduced to the fellow who was</text>
  <text start="352.159" dur="11.971">in charge of electronics and</text>
  <text start="354.08" dur="14.489">communication Pete the eye and Principe</text>
  <text start="364.13" dur="6.63">guy so he then told me a little bit</text>
  <text start="368.569" dur="6.121">about what he wanted to me to do</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="8.04">the company it turns out that Douglas</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="6.63">had a secret think tank inside of</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="6.06">Douglas and I don&amp;#39;t think Bob either</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="11.07">would even though was there okay</text>
  <text start="384.86" dur="11.58">and so Pete didn&amp;#39;t have a card to get</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="8.67">into it but he buzzed into it to the</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="9.21">receptionist inside she told her who we</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="7.62">wanted to bring in and he she comes in</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="7.32">opens the door and takes me in and Pete</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="9.14">doesn&amp;#39;t go in he&amp;#39;s not authorized to go</text>
  <text start="412.97" dur="9.99">into this secretive thing time so I</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="9.67">spent 12 and a half years and Douglas at</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="7.32">least 50% of it was in the tank and then</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="7.32">later on I became engineering section</text>
  <text start="430.28" dur="8.91">chief of the Apollo program actually my</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="7.41">position was for all types of test</text>
  <text start="439.19" dur="6.06">equipment for our new contract which was</text>
  <text start="442.22" dur="8.28">for the Apollo upper stage which was the</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="6.99">s4b stage of a poem now a lot wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="6.96">understood and it hasn&amp;#39;t even been</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="8.49">brought up yet but Douglas inside the</text>
  <text start="457.46" dur="7.56">secret think tank and we had been</text>
  <text start="460.73" dur="8.37">working on programs not just to do the</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="9.9">Apollo program that was all stuff we</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="11.72">have been working on missions to go out</text>
  <text start="474.92" dur="11.04">endless in space and build naval base</text>
  <text start="480.82" dur="9.79">and research facilities on every planet</text>
  <text start="485.96" dur="8.41">in the solar system or their moon now</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="7">this is way way before NASA even existed</text>
  <text start="494.37" dur="7.92">we were making doing these secret</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="9.089">studies ourselves not by the Navy but</text>
  <text start="502.29" dur="8.129">for the Navy this is way before space</text>
  <text start="506.699" dur="6.421">maybe even started and we were</text>
  <text start="510.419" dur="7.081">tremendously interested in what was</text>
  <text start="513.12" dur="6.78">taking place out in the galaxy I was</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="5.39">able to utilize a great deal of the</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="6.17">information that I spent in the Navy</text>
  <text start="522.89" dur="5.92">where I was staffed and Ulrika Bonnie</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="11.519">don&amp;#39;t you want me to explain a little of</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="8.779">that all right this is very strange</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="16.3">there was a group of people who were</text>
  <text start="544.52" dur="12.19">studying extra trust and this is time I</text>
  <text start="555.21" dur="11.78">got to figure out the best way to get</text>
  <text start="556.71" dur="19.47">into this they a single Navy operative</text>
  <text start="566.99" dur="12.01">went into Germany this is like 1939 he</text>
  <text start="576.18" dur="7.58">didn&amp;#39;t believe this but there was very</text>
  <text start="579" dur="8.7">strange organizations and different</text>
  <text start="583.76" dur="5.22">research groups all over not just</text>
  <text start="587.7" dur="6.32">Germany</text>
  <text start="588.98" dur="10.06">in the occupied countries too and</text>
  <text start="594.02" dur="9.72">strangely enough Germany was putting in</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="9.419">production fantastic vehicles that had</text>
  <text start="603.74" dur="6.51">literally they didn&amp;#39;t they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="608.459" dur="4.721">wings on these</text>
  <text start="610.25" dur="6.5">they didn&amp;#39;t have MP knives or tails of</text>
  <text start="613.18" dur="5.32">the a twenty years some of them or</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="6.13">triangular shape</text>
  <text start="618.5" dur="8.76">some were rectangular shape some were</text>
  <text start="622.88" dur="9.93">round shape like a saucer all these</text>
  <text start="627.26" dur="11">different vehicles were drinking mainly</text>
  <text start="632.81" dur="8.28">vehicles but the Draco reptilian</text>
  <text start="638.26" dur="5.92">civilization people and come to the</text>
  <text start="641.09" dur="7.35">planet they had selected Germany as</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="11.22">being their support organization on the</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="11.58">planet so what happened it was this</text>
  <text start="655.4" dur="10.05">spine was inside of German secret</text>
  <text start="660.02" dur="8.22">laboratories it was a brilliant German</text>
  <text start="665.45" dur="5.76">he knew all the dialects he was a</text>
  <text start="668.24" dur="6.69">gentleman family living in the United</text>
  <text start="671.21" dur="10.41">States and American but he&amp;#39;s in Germany</text>
  <text start="674.93" dur="9.21">and unlike many spies he knew much about</text>
  <text start="681.62" dur="10.67">Germany he knew where the facilities</text>
  <text start="684.14" dur="11.94">were and so he being being as a spy for</text>
  <text start="692.29" dur="7.87">the Navy found out all of these</text>
  <text start="696.08" dur="7.85">fantastic situations that were going on</text>
  <text start="700.16" dur="7.65">inside of Germany and this is an extra</text>
  <text start="703.93" dur="6.43">important point instead of him going to</text>
  <text start="707.81" dur="6.99">his boss coming back to the United</text>
  <text start="710.36" dur="11.4">States he went directly to the Secretary</text>
  <text start="714.8" dur="11.34">of the Navy before stop so he explained</text>
  <text start="721.76" dur="7.74">to force fellow all this fantastic thing</text>
  <text start="726.14" dur="10.71">that was happening all over Germany or</text>
  <text start="729.5" dur="8.74">in the war and Forrestal seemed to</text>
  <text start="736.85" dur="6.97">believe this</text>
  <text start="738.24" dur="10.469">spy so forth all them structured an</text>
  <text start="743.82" dur="11.43">organization of two dozen the top maybe</text>
  <text start="748.709" dur="10.021">spies and they were going to go into all</text>
  <text start="755.25" dur="9.54">the Aires in Germany and find out what</text>
  <text start="758.73" dur="12.66">is really going on okay now this is</text>
  <text start="764.79" dur="12.62">particularly interesting for still get</text>
  <text start="771.39" dur="13.53">stepped on the shoulder he gets told</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="16.119">don&amp;#39;t select a navy officer to head up</text>
  <text start="784.92" dur="13.34">these operators what he&amp;#39;s told to select</text>
  <text start="793.529" dur="9.391">somebody who had never been in Annapolis</text>
  <text start="798.26" dur="8.74">now almost every Navy officer or the</text>
  <text start="802.92" dur="6.05">there of one star or Lieutenant</text>
  <text start="807" dur="6.35">Commander they&amp;#39;ve all been through</text>
  <text start="808.97" dur="11.38">Annapolis to learn how to be a maybe</text>
  <text start="813.35" dur="14.35">officer some why was he selected so it</text>
  <text start="820.35" dur="13.08">turns out force dog is told that every</text>
  <text start="827.7" dur="8.97">book every book in the libraries every</text>
  <text start="833.43" dur="6.75">book in the colleges every book in the</text>
  <text start="836.67" dur="6.979">universities every book on this planet</text>
  <text start="840.18" dur="10.14">is misinformation</text>
  <text start="843.649" dur="10.151">it&amp;#39;s misinformation so which is miss</text>
  <text start="850.32" dur="9.6">needed by the Draco reptilians as far</text>
  <text start="853.8" dur="6.869">back as 6,000 years ago all over this</text>
  <text start="859.92" dur="4.809">planet</text>
  <text start="860.669" dur="8.23">books are not telling the truth whether</text>
  <text start="864.729" dur="8.57">it&amp;#39;s medical whether it&amp;#39;s interplanetary</text>
  <text start="868.899" dur="8.43">whether it&amp;#39;s science every person every</text>
  <text start="873.299" dur="7.6">PhD on the planet has been given</text>
  <text start="877.329" dur="8.79">misinformation the four or five years</text>
  <text start="880.899" dur="9.72">movies of the University so the</text>
  <text start="886.119" dur="8.19">secretary of Navy selects Ric Oba he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="890.619" dur="6.72">not even an American he comes over here</text>

  <text start="928.809" dur="7.8">into Germany and find out what&amp;#39;s alone</text>
  <text start="932.519" dur="8.32">because that individual had never had</text>
  <text start="936.609" dur="8.28">misinformation given to him about every</text>
  <text start="940.839" dur="7.77">technical field on the planet this may</text>
  <text start="944.889" dur="4.55">sound like insanity this is what</text>
  <text start="948.609" dur="5.67">happened</text>

  <text start="1201.98" dur="6.43">this was 1935 ok later on all kinds of</text>
  <text start="1207.499" dur="3.821">things</text>
  <text start="1208.41" dur="7.98">I make a whole group of us a lot of</text>
  <text start="1211.32" dur="8.85">ships of US Navy ships and actually over</text>

  <text start="1228.03" dur="9.45">absolutely we&amp;#39;re living in Hollywood and</text>
  <text start="1233.64" dur="8.52">so my dad takes us down to Long Beach</text>
  <text start="1237.48" dur="6.69">and the Navy has these very large you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1242.16" dur="4.95">see their lifeboats that they&amp;#39;re powered</text>
  <text start="1244.17" dur="6.66">launches which takes large number of the</text>
  <text start="1247.11" dur="7.88">sailors back to port or back onto the</text>
  <text start="1250.83" dur="9.93">ships so about at that time this is like</text>
  <text start="1254.99" dur="9.52">1940 but maybe is tremendously concerned</text>
  <text start="1260.76" dur="8.79">about the Japanese built up into the</text>
  <text start="1264.51" dur="10.38">Pacific so they get a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="1269.55" dur="7.71">rocks they build a massive breakwater in</text>
  <text start="1274.89" dur="5.88">front of Long Beach not only have an</text>
  <text start="1277.26" dur="6.66">enormous maybe Harbor so we bring the</text>
  <text start="1280.77" dur="5.88">ships down from them at Seattle we bring</text>
  <text start="1283.92" dur="5.67">them down from San Francisco they bring</text>
  <text start="1286.65" dur="6.06">them up from San Diego and now the</text>
  <text start="1289.59" dur="6.45">battle groups conform communicate</text>
  <text start="1292.71" dur="6.57">together and go out on a mission even</text>
  <text start="1296.04" dur="6.48">more worried about what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="1299.28" dur="7.529">the eastern Pacific but maybe takes most</text>
  <text start="1302.52" dur="7.05">of the Atlantic Fleet down through the</text>
  <text start="1306.809" dur="5.551">Panama Canal and bring them up past</text>
  <text start="1309.57" dur="4.859">Mexico and put them in this new Harbor</text>
  <text start="1312.36" dur="6.9">you have a huge fleet right there in</text>

  <text start="1438.04" dur="4.95">so if I walk out onto the flight deck I</text>
  <text start="1440.47" dur="5.1">look up at the bridge and here is a</text>
  <text start="1442.99" dur="9.24">great big rectangle up on the top of the</text>

  <text start="1473.86" dur="6.63">in a battle condition you fill up that</text>
  <text start="1477.4" dur="7.14">flight deck with every plane you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1480.49" dur="7.05">in this particular case 89 airplanes can</text>
  <text start="1484.54" dur="6.96">go on the Lexington but there&amp;#39;s no deck</text>
  <text start="1487.54" dur="9.18">left right up to the front so the name</text>

  <text start="1520.78" dur="6.72">in a pilot coming in to land on an</text>
  <text start="1523.51" dur="8.01">aircraft carrier you pull the lever this</text>
  <text start="1527.5" dur="7.8">lever drops a long bar that&amp;#39;s hanging</text>
  <text start="1531.52" dur="9.57">out behind you with a hook lining on the</text>
  <text start="1535.3" dur="8.67">F part of the flight deck are cables six</text>
  <text start="1541.09" dur="6.15">tables four cables whatever they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1543.97" dur="6.51">the way across the plate so your hook</text>
  <text start="1547.24" dur="5.87">grabs one of those and stops you so you</text>
  <text start="1550.48" dur="6.68">don&amp;#39;t go crashing all the airplane</text>
  <text start="1553.11" dur="9.07">okay all right now</text>
  <text start="1557.16" dur="8.2">this is secret so I walk to the stern of</text>
  <text start="1562.18" dur="5.61">the flight deck and I want the number of</text>
  <text start="1565.36" dur="5.55">steps it takes me to get to the first</text>

  <text start="1631.78" dur="6.54">of the Lexington or the Saratoga</text>
  <text start="1634.18" dur="5.61">aircraft carrier okay when I first got</text>
  <text start="1638.32" dur="6.29">up to the flight deck</text>
  <text start="1639.79" dur="11.58">I&amp;#39;m looking for the turrets a turret is</text>
  <text start="1644.61" dur="9.13">essentially a movable area on the top of</text>

  <text start="1680.24" dur="6.809">tourists off of all of the aircraft</text>
  <text start="1683.419" dur="6.781">carriers and said let the maybe cruisers</text>
  <text start="1687.049" dur="5.791">handle that part of the mission we need</text>
  <text start="1690.2" dur="6.12">more space on the flight deck and we</text>
  <text start="1692.84" dur="5.969">need 20 millimeter 40 millimeter and</text>

  <text start="2346.7" dur="5.36">resisting everything that I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="2349.28" dur="20.91">tell them they were tremendously</text>
