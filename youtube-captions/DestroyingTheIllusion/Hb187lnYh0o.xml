  <text start="0.03" dur="4.62">we are beings of light ancient scripture</text>
  <text start="3.06" dur="3.779">has always told us symbolically of these</text>
  <text start="4.65" dur="4.98">truths and now modern science is proving</text>
  <text start="6.839" dur="4.861">that as a fact professor fritz Albert</text>
  <text start="9.63" dur="4.049">Pot was a biophysicist in Germany at the</text>
  <text start="11.7" dur="3.689">University of Marburg and he was</text>
  <text start="13.679" dur="3.36">teaching radiology and playing around</text>
  <text start="15.389" dur="3.39">with chemicals in their relation to</text>
  <text start="17.039" dur="3.721">electromagnetic frequencies pop</text>
  <text start="18.779" dur="4.381">discovered that a specific chemical he</text>
  <text start="20.76" dur="4.05">was working with benzo a pyrene would</text>
  <text start="23.16" dur="3.39">absorb ultraviolet light and then</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="3.9">re-emit it at a completely different</text>
  <text start="26.55" dur="4.71">wavelength it was a light scrambler</text>
  <text start="28.71" dur="4.8">funny enough its chemical cousin benzo a</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="3.72">pyrene is harmless to humans and it</text>
  <text start="33.51" dur="3.36">allowed the ultraviolet light to pass</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="3.39">through unaltered contested many more</text>
  <text start="36.87" dur="3.509">chemicals some known to be harmful to</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="4.349">humans and some not and found that all</text>
  <text start="40.379" dur="4.321">of the harmful substances would scramble</text>
  <text start="42.719" dur="5.25">the light and scramble it at a specific</text>
  <text start="44.7" dur="5.01">frequency 380 nanometers he was</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="4.291">astounded and then researched into this</text>
  <text start="49.71" dur="4.079">phenomena called photo repair it&amp;#39;s well</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="4.17">known that if you blast a cell with</text>
  <text start="53.789" dur="4.981">ultraviolet light until 99% of it even</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="4.019">its DNA is destroyed that you can repair</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="3.48">the cell in just a single day by</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="3.121">blasting it with the same ultraviolet</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="3.45">wavelength just in a much lower</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="4.74">intensity when I read this I thought of</text>
  <text start="65.7" dur="4.65">homeopathy professor Pape was struck by</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="4.26">the fact that photo repair worked most</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="4.32">efficiently at the same frequency that</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="3.93">these chemicals would scramble the 380</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="3.269">nanometers he wrote about this concept</text>
  <text start="76.5" dur="2.7">that he found in a coupled medical</text>
  <text start="77.939" dur="3.301">journals actually published his work</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="3.63">then what a professor plot students</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="4.14">asked him to oversee his doctoral</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="4.8">dissertation and pop said only if you</text>
  <text start="85.38" dur="4.349">can show me that living things emit</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="3.779">light and coincidentally enough that</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="3.451">student was pretty much an engineering</text>
  <text start="91.409" dur="4.201">genius and he really wanted to prove</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="4.2">professor pop wrong so he built a huge</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="3.6">device that would actually look at</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="4.8">photon by photon it was called a</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="4.38">photomultiplier and what that student</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="2.64">built it&amp;#39;s actually still considered to</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="4.11">be one of the best pieces of equipment</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="5.189">in the field and in 1976 they tested it</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="4.65">and they snipped a piece of a plant and</text>
  <text start="110.009" dur="4.951">put this fresh material into a light</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="5.4">sealed box and when they flipped on the</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="4.83">screen it lit up and professor pop</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="4.439">explained we know today that man is</text>
  <text start="119.79" dur="3.929">essentially a being of light and they</text>
  <text start="122.189" dur="3.511">went on to find that all the cells of</text>
  <text start="123.719" dur="3.871">her body communicate with these photons</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="4.11">which they termed bio photons and</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="4.289">especially our DNA was found to harbor</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.84">them which cohered and harmonized them</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="3.78">this may explain the site</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="3.86">mystery of how a single little strand of</text>
  <text start="135.659" dur="4.83">DNA can make a fully functioning human</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="4.869">DNA essentially acts as an antenna Co</text>
  <text start="140.489" dur="3.571">hearing and harmonizing these photons as</text>
  <text start="142.379" dur="3.841">information and it gives and receives</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="3.959">this information from the source field</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="4.23">of the life force energy that connects</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="4.261">everything pop also found that cancer</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.5">could be considered a loss of coherent</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="5.22">light less light equals more disease or</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="4.5">more dis-ease and good vibes and good</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="3.45">health could be considered more coherent</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="3.84">light so how would we literally</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="4.77">enlighten ourselves well we must eat</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.8">whole organic foods if you&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="4.5">the Kirlian photography of food raw</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="4.11">natural organic foods will give off much</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="4.95">more of this bioenergy and we must</text>
  <text start="172.2" dur="5.159">exercise not over stress ourselves with</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="4.2">the strenuous exercise but we must also</text>
  <text start="177.359" dur="3.931">practice what&amp;#39;s called working in</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="4.5">techniques like tai chi yoga or</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="4.199">breathing exercises we must meditate and</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="4.08">we must get into the habit of thinking</text>
  <text start="185.489" dur="4.411">purely loving thoughts as much as we can</text>
  <text start="187.95" dur="3.959">not only for other people but for</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="3.3">ourselves as well doing all of these</text>
  <text start="191.909" dur="3.601">things will make us into the most</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="4.289">healthy energetic humans that we can be</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="4.08">you must literally work to become the</text>
  <text start="197.489" dur="4.14">light hope you enjoyed that video please</text>
