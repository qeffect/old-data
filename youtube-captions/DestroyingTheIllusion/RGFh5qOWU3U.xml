  <text start="144.57" dur="5.37">Facebook if links will be down below but</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="3.09">if you follow me on Twitter you started</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="4.05">seeing my thought process through it all</text>
  <text start="151.35" dur="5.87">and I was like you know actually the way</text>
  <text start="153.99" dur="6">this is all turning out it looks</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="7.39">perfectly to plant perfectly to plant</text>
  <text start="159.99" dur="6.21">you know I&amp;#39;m gonna read a quick I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="164.61" dur="4.62">gonna paraphrase here a quick little</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="5.28">analysis that I found on Twitter this</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="4.68">morning retweeted it again if you follow</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="3.87">me on Twitter you saw this probably I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="7.13">gonna paraphrase it here because this is</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="5.69">a fantastic analysis basically says that</text>
  <text start="181.46" dur="10.42">with the Senate now the Senate was a</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="7.59">gain for Donald Trump and basically the</text>
  <text start="191.88" dur="4.47">ability to get people on board with his</text>
  <text start="193.38" dur="4.74">agenda the Senate was a win right here</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="3.12">it says when all midterm election</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="2.88">results are certified Trump will likely</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="6.269">have 55 seats</text>
  <text start="201" dur="7.56">that&amp;#39;s +4 from 51 so 4 gained from just</text>
  <text start="205.739" dur="5.071">a few days ago but in terms of two years</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="4.8">ago in terms of 2016 when Trump was</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="4.89">elected president it&amp;#39;s actually plus 7</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="5.43">because we had three GOP members back</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="5.73">then such as McCain and a couple of</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="6.09">other people who lost this round who</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="5.84">were basically anti anti Trump anti Haga</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="4.92">you know they were deep state controlled</text>
  <text start="227.27" dur="4.63">basically called themselves Republicans</text>
  <text start="229.8" dur="6.9">acted like Democrats you know again two</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="7.86">sides of the same bird really but so</text>
  <text start="236.7" dur="3.57">actually it&amp;#39;s a game definitely gain in</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="3.51">the Senate</text>
  <text start="240.27" dur="7.469">I remember the Senate has only a hundred</text>
  <text start="243.27" dur="6.29">people in it as opposed to what 535 in</text>
  <text start="247.739" dur="5.97">the House Senate has much more power</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="5.89">six-year terms and much much more power</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="5.46">in the Senate that&amp;#39;s what we wanted and</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="5.219">that&amp;#39;s what we got okay now when it</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="3.031">comes to the house let&amp;#39;s talk about that</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="4.771">Republicans lost control the House</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="5.37">Democrats took it over when it comes to</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.2">the house</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="4.68">I think of it this way you know if</text>
  <text start="269.64" dur="5.07">Republicans had taken control of the</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.73">house as well and it was just a complete</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="5.52">red wave red tsunami whatever that</text>
  <text start="277.98" dur="5.52">people wanted people were somewhat</text>
  <text start="280.23" dur="7.62">expecting would that have been good for</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="6.41">the optics as they say you know would</text>
  <text start="287.85" dur="5.28">that have been good for that woulda sure</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="4.84">busted some people&amp;#39;s heads like maybe</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="5.64">would there have been riots in the</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="9.15">streets and not only that but you</text>
  <text start="298.77" dur="6.75">already know if the reds the Republicans</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="3.84">would have taken control of Senate and</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="4.34">House that the high-level Democrat</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="5.85">officials man they would have been like</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="4.87">livid bloodthirsty already calling for</text>
  <text start="313.59" dur="4.74">her impeachment I mean it just wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="6.12">have been helpful right why not let the</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="4.95">Democrats take control of the house so</text>
  <text start="320.85" dur="3.63">then that will placate them a little bit</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;ll be a little apathetic they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="3.21">think they&amp;#39;re you know getting ahead of</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="5.1">the game</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="6.57">but guess what comes next FISA it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="3.84">always been there a couple weeks ago</text>
  <text start="334.26" dur="3.27">Donald Trump said I&amp;#39;m gonna wait I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="5.37">gonna wait till after the midterm</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="5.19">elections to drop FISA there you go so</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="2.67">doesn&amp;#39;t matter who takes the house in</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="3.93">fact this is kind of better because it</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="7.38">lets things simmer a little bit and then</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="6.33">boom FISA can drop so there you go why</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="4.41">you worried why you scared that was</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="4.92">always there again logical thinking when</text>
  <text start="356.04" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re emotionally reactive and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="4.29">in a fierce state you&amp;#39;ll only take a</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="3.66">couple pieces of information usually</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="3.78">just what&amp;#39;s right in front of you and</text>
  <text start="363.54" dur="8.07">then your mind runs with that you start</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="7.2">making up some sort of situation in your</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="3.54">head that&amp;#39;s not reality you know when</text>
  <text start="373.17" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re chill when you&amp;#39;re relaxed you can</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="6.17">take in more information and and find a</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="7.02">clearer perspective through the nonsense</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="6.37">so where do we go forward from here FISA</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="7.77">what is Cuban saying for a few months</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="8.94">now FISA brings down the house oh-hoh a</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="6.3">future proving past a interesting double</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="4.58">meanings exist as well FISA brings down</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="7.49">the house</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="7.98">it&amp;#39;s as if somehow someway they expected</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="4.74">or they knew or this was some sort of</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="3.659">contingency plan being FISA oh yeah I</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="2.459">let the Democrats take control of the</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="3.301">house whatever we&amp;#39;ll do drop flies on</text>
  <text start="414.139" dur="3.271">their house and declassify it right and</text>
  <text start="416.15" dur="3.62">then special elections will take place</text>
  <text start="417.41" dur="7.349">and then BOOM there you go</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="8.489">so not concern speaking of cue future</text>
  <text start="424.759" dur="6">proving past type stuff I found this</text>
  <text start="428.259" dur="6.791">very intriguing doing a little bit of</text>
  <text start="430.759" dur="6.72">digging last night trying to again get</text>
