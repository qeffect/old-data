  <text start="8.48" dur="5.35">going on guys it&amp;#39;s June 22nd and back to</text>
  <text start="11.639" dur="3.991">the lab again and what I&amp;#39;m gonna do in</text>
  <text start="13.83" dur="5.25">these videos what I&amp;#39;m gonna start doing</text>
  <text start="15.63" dur="6.03">per se is giving them up so I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="19.08" dur="6.449">like one or two videos a week on science</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="5.58">and tech updates one video I want to one</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="3.42">or two videos I want to add in like</text>
  <text start="27.24" dur="4.339">health news and then of course the</text>
  <text start="28.949" dur="4.981">geopolitical updates so this way it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="31.579" dur="4.031">I&amp;#39;ll be able to stay on point with</text>
  <text start="33.93" dur="3.719">certain subjects I won&amp;#39;t have to bounce</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="3.24">around so much my white board can handle</text>
  <text start="37.649" dur="3.151">it you know and get more stuff on there</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="4.44">and then they&amp;#39;ll be shorter more to the</text>
  <text start="40.8" dur="4.41">point and getting you guys more content</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="4.05">as well so this is how I&amp;#39;m gonna do it</text>
  <text start="45.21" dur="5.96">and today it&amp;#39;s gonna be science and tech</text>
  <text start="47.34" dur="6.149">so first of all we have a bunch of quiet</text>
  <text start="51.17" dur="5.2">disclosure seeping out of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="5.601">media you know now that I&amp;#39;m back in the</text>
  <text start="56.37" dur="6.54">Pacific Northwest back home</text>
  <text start="59.09" dur="5.38">Eagle I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="62.91" dur="3.33">seep out since I&amp;#39;m actually back on the</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="6.54">internet kind of again I&amp;#39;m not traveling</text>
  <text start="66.24" dur="6.87">and first of all on futurism fusion</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="5.55">breakthrough puts us one step closer to</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="5.399">clean limitless energy and again what</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="3.72">the powers that be have to do because so</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="3.121">many people are learning the truth and</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="4.8">learning what&amp;#39;s actually going on is</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re trying to get as much disclosure</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="6.03">out there as quick as they can but doing</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="4.65">so to not implicate themselves in being</text>
  <text start="91.11" dur="3.509">in a complete cover-up for eons</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="3.54">essentially because when it comes to</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="3.871">cold fusion that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="96.18" dur="4.56">scientists are just so close you know</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="3.87">the holy grail of energy production to</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="4.769">provide clean virtually unlimited</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="4.5">amounts of energy it&amp;#39;s been done it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="2.97">been done for almost a hundred years now</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="3.329">and especially in regards to cold fusion</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="4.801">that we know has been around since the</text>
  <text start="110.189" dur="5.011">80s look into a dr. Eugene mallove who</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="4.67">was quite literally beaten to death in</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="6.059">his home because he was working to</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="5.559">disclose cold fusion technology so this</text>
  <text start="121.259" dur="4.201">has been suppressed for a long time for</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="3.631">decades but now right in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="2.76">media is saying oh it&amp;#39;s a magical new</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.119">thing that we almost have and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="3.78">trying to dazzle the public with these</text>
  <text start="130.259" dur="3.651">big bright lights and not make them</text>
  <text start="132" dur="3.62">realize or a</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="5.52">essentially look at the true sets that</text>
  <text start="135.62" dur="6.6">have been around so quiet mainstream</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="4.68">disclosures or partial bait-and-switch</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="4.29">disclosures you can call them fusion</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="4.08">free energy breakthrough ten planets and</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="3.45">our solar system this is another</text>
  <text start="148.19" dur="5.22">interesting one where apparently</text>
  <text start="149.96" dur="5.01">scientists have found a tenth planet not</text>
  <text start="153.41" dur="3.78">even as far out as they thought they</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="3.3">would they thought they would find if</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="2.52">they were to find a tenth planet</text>
  <text start="158.27" dur="2.52">supposedly in the article it says they</text>
  <text start="159.71" dur="5.04">thought they would find it like four</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="5.82">hundred astronomical units which one au</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="3.63">one astronomical unit is the distance</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="2.97">between the Sun and the earth so they</text>
  <text start="168.38" dur="2.85">thought they would find it two planet</text>
  <text start="169.58" dur="3.81">way out there in the solar system but</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="4.89">according to this article it says oh</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;ve only found it fifty-fifty AU&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="2.97">out which is approximately the cooper</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="3.87">belt so what does this make you think of</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="5.37">well there&amp;#39;s all the talk about on</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="5.16">Nibiru or Planet X or whatever would</text>
  <text start="184.46" dur="3.6">have you um maybe it&amp;#39;s actually a real</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="3.45">thing maybe there was some</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="4.35">disinformation out there some fear porn</text>
  <text start="190.04" dur="4.08">in regards to it like crashing into the</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="3.75">earth or coming through our solar system</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="4.17">really close to the Sun and disrupting</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="5.61">everything maybe all that&amp;#39;s not true but</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="5.79">maybe there are far more planets out</text>
  <text start="201.77" dur="4.74">there far more celestial bodies you</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="5.129">could say that I&amp;#39;ve been out there and</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="4.56">of course we know that one of them used</text>
  <text start="209.209" dur="4.201">to be where the asteroid belt was so</text>
  <text start="211.07" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;ll be another story for another day</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="4.77">but big disclosure there this one is</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="7.92">interesting drawn orbs could deliver</text>
  <text start="218.18" dur="9.48">anything even people whoa so we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="8.25">told by certain disclosure proponents</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="5.76">that we would start to see a lot of slow</text>
  <text start="231.98" dur="3.69">rollout of interesting technology</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="3.66">especially in regards to drones but now</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re saying drone orbs could even</text>
  <text start="237.08" dur="4.92">deliver people much like also</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="5.25">extraterrestrial technologies orbs</text>
  <text start="242" dur="5.04">delivering people so Wow hmm just</text>
  <text start="244.91" dur="3.72">rolling it out there seeding the public</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="3.51">consciousness with these things and then</text>
  <text start="248.63" dur="5.19">lastly this article here</text>
  <text start="250.55" dur="5.189">quantum satellite shatters entanglement</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="4.11">record and apparently to Chinese</text>
  <text start="255.739" dur="4.771">satellites who were 1200 kilometers</text>
  <text start="257.93" dur="7.62">apart this one I found on science news</text>
  <text start="260.51" dur="7.14">org broke a record via a quantum leap</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="3.24">about the particles of</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="2.88">born in space I should say have</text>
  <text start="268.79" dur="3.57">connected to cities via quantum link</text>
  <text start="270.53" dur="4.199">about 10 times longer than created</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="4.529">before again in regards to the free</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="3.381">energy breakthrough science we know has</text>
  <text start="276.889" dur="3.211">been around for a long time just</text>
  <text start="278.11" dur="4.63">esoteric science that has been talked</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="4.05">about in the mainstream they are putting</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="3.27">out in the mainstream in a different</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="6.45">package to people make people think that</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="7.05">you know all of these stuff that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="290.6" dur="5.4">suppressed is some magical new things so</text>
  <text start="293.06" dur="4.889">this brings me back this brings me to</text>
  <text start="296" dur="3.6">the point of nikola tesla there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="297.949" dur="6.09">quote that circles around often times</text>
  <text start="299.6" dur="6.06">that i try my best to get people the</text>
  <text start="304.039" dur="3.6">right perspective the right ideas on and</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="8.55">that is nikola tesla describing a cell</text>
  <text start="307.639" dur="10.881">phone i want to pull it up here and that</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="6.87">is a 1926 quote where</text>
  <text start="318.52" dur="4.42">nikola tesla describing a cell phone he</text>
  <text start="321.08" dur="3.3">says when wireless is perfectly applied</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="3.93">to the whole earth it will be converted</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="4.56">into a big brain and all things being</text>
  <text start="326.87" dur="3.48">particle of a real and rhythmic whole we</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="1.74">shall be able to communicate with one</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="2.73">another</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="3.9">instantly irrespective of distance not</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="3.33">only this but through television and</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="3.33">telephony we shall see and hear one</text>
  <text start="336.41" dur="4.56">another&amp;#39;s perfectly as if we were face</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="4.11">to face and we&amp;#39;ll be able to do them</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="3.06">with instruments if we could fit in our</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="3.72">vest pockets so people usually attribute</text>
  <text start="344.03" dur="2.58">this quote to current Wi-Fi technology</text>
  <text start="345.74" dur="3.59">right</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="5.61">nikola tesla describing a cell phone</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="4.3">he&amp;#39;s not describing current Wi-Fi</text>
  <text start="352.22" dur="3.06">technology that we have that works</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="5.009">through the use of transverse waves</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="5.1">which is why it radiates us you know it</text>
  <text start="358.639" dur="4.741">transverses through space so we put</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="5.63">those cell phones to our ears the</text>
  <text start="363.38" dur="4.89">radiation will harm us it works through</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="4">transverse wave technology works through</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s almost like linear bitstreams so it</text>
  <text start="370.01" dur="6.75">sends a constant stream of data to the</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="6.239">next point quantum quantum energy</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="3.75">transfer per se which Nikola Tesla was</text>
  <text start="378.919" dur="3.571">truly describing works through</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="4.29">longitudinal waves its bits point to</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="3.929">point which is quantum that quantum</text>
  <text start="384.8" dur="3.839">entanglement idea all points in space</text>
  <text start="386.419" dur="3.481">and time are connected so that&amp;#39;s truly</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="3.391">what Nikola Tesla was describing</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="5.13">longitudinal or quantum functioning</text>
  <text start="392.03" dur="5.759">where you send the whole bit of data the</text>
  <text start="395.03" dur="5.639">whole package of information at once so</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="3.62">it uses that idea of all points being</text>
  <text start="400.669" dur="2.81">connect</text>
  <text start="401.409" dur="5.61">to send information not only can you</text>
  <text start="403.479" dur="5.37">send information through quantum</text>
  <text start="407.019" dur="5.07">entanglement with my cell phones and</text>
  <text start="408.849" dur="4.74">whatnot but you think if everything</text>
  <text start="412.089" dur="3.241">technically is information information</text>
  <text start="413.589" dur="3.271">is energy everything is energy so</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="6.019">everything is information not only can</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="6.75">you send data via the quantum</text>
  <text start="421.349" dur="4.3">entanglement way from point to point</text>
  <text start="423.61" dur="5.94">cell phone a cell phone but you could</text>
  <text start="425.649" dur="5.91">send stuff things spacecraft right so</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="4.079">that&amp;#39;s a little bit of background behind</text>
  <text start="431.559" dur="3.93">what quantum entanglement really is and</text>
  <text start="433.629" dur="5.79">nikola tesla was describing that</text>
  <text start="435.489" dur="6.48">100 years ago so mainstream disclosure</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="4.441">was trying to catch up then you know</text>
  <text start="441.969" dur="4.49">after all that we&amp;#39;re gonna get into this</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="7.589">which I just found very interesting</text>
  <text start="446.459" dur="7.02">an anonymous video was just posted on</text>
  <text start="451.449" dur="4.5">the 20th so a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="453.479" dur="4.71">describing NASA about to announce the</text>
  <text start="455.949" dur="4.5">discovery of intelligent alien life and</text>
  <text start="458.189" dur="3.52">anonymous posting that is interesting</text>
  <text start="460.449" dur="3.57">because that means it&amp;#39;s getting out to</text>
  <text start="461.709" dur="3.81">more people and who knows you know you</text>
  <text start="464.019" dur="3.781">could say anonymous could be some white</text>
  <text start="465.519" dur="7.05">hats or an alliance in the military or</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="6.599">it could be a controlled opposition</text>
  <text start="472.569" dur="3.75">you know either or maybe Anonymous has</text>
  <text start="474.399" dur="3.841">been infiltrated by whatnot but the fact</text>
  <text start="476.319" dur="3.33">that they would disclose this is big</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="6">news that&amp;#39;s mean it&amp;#39;s getting out to</text>
  <text start="479.649" dur="6.36">more people and a bait-and-switch or</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="4.289">some type of alien disclosure</text>
  <text start="486.009" dur="5.041">announcement could very well be the case</text>
  <text start="488.529" dur="4.23">soon so all eyes open all ears open we</text>
  <text start="491.05" dur="4.399">don&amp;#39;t want to be switched that way next</text>
  <text start="492.759" dur="5.88">a global earthquake this I just found</text>
  <text start="495.449" dur="6.37">pretty much everywhere it may or may not</text>
