  <text start="10.889" dur="3.75">destroying the illusion we&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="3.48">back the good old-fashioned chalkboard</text>
  <text start="14.639" dur="3.991">for this one and in this session we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="16.65" dur="2.76">gonna be taking a deep dive into project</text>
  <text start="18.63" dur="3.03">Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="19.41" dur="4.82">so with cue mentioning project Looking</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="7.35">Glass in a drop just a few days ago Wow</text>
  <text start="24.23" dur="7">huge holy disclosure Batman truly I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="4.47">been waiting for cue to get into this</text>
  <text start="31.23" dur="3.87">spectrum of disclosure into the weird</text>
  <text start="33.48" dur="3.12">stuff for a while and they&amp;#39;re definitely</text>
  <text start="35.1" dur="3.54">doing it with project Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="5.94">right here this is probably one of the</text>
  <text start="38.64" dur="6.48">most obscure underground topics the</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="5.249">queue is mentioned in awhile if not ever</text>
  <text start="45.12" dur="5.759">so I&amp;#39;m very excited for it and with that</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="5.25">being said try to keep your mind as open</text>
  <text start="50.879" dur="4.02">as you can especially during this whole</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="4.02">Great Awakening the more open you can</text>
  <text start="54.899" dur="4.471">keep your mind the quicker this</text>
  <text start="57.059" dur="4.23">awakening will come and the easier it</text>
  <text start="59.37" dur="4.14">will come plus if you keep your mind</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="4.141">closed you&amp;#39;re going to be missing all of</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="3.48">this hidden knowledge that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="2.79">hiding from us for hundreds if not</text>
  <text start="66.99" dur="4.199">thousands of years</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="5.31">and you won&amp;#39;t appreciate nor understand</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="5.491">the potentials of where this hidden</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="5.28">knowledge could take us as a society all</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="4.5">right so you don&amp;#39;t to miss that keep</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="5.309">your mind as open as you can I know this</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="4.59">whole awakening process it&amp;#39;s triggering</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="4.051">a lot of people it&amp;#39;s triggering their</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="4.38">belief systems it&amp;#39;s bringing up all this</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="4.44">cognitive dissonance within them and</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="4.289">that&amp;#39;s naturally gonna happen when we</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="2.939">have all the brainwashing and mind</text>
  <text start="94.439" dur="3.271">control that we have in our society</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="4.32">these days but the more we can open our</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.979">minds the more we can see this self</text>
  <text start="99.869" dur="5.61">actualizing information and then try to</text>
  <text start="102.689" dur="5.161">get it out there to make our society</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="3.871">where it could truly go where it could</text>
  <text start="107.85" dur="3.39">have gone for a long time if they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="4.83">hide this stuff from us but where we</text>
  <text start="111.24" dur="5.01">could truly go which will be</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="3.869">mind-blowing you know as Q says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="4.439">gonna be bigger than we can imagine and</text>
  <text start="118.049" dur="5.64">I can barely even try to imagine it</text>
  <text start="120.689" dur="5.43">right but I know it&amp;#39;s gonna be good so</text>
  <text start="123.689" dur="4.981">getting into project Looking Glass here</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m going to outline for you quickly how</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="4.66">I&amp;#39;m gonna go through this pretty</text>
  <text start="130.259" dur="6.431">in-depth information and then I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="5.31">quick disclaimer for the skeptics and</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="4.29">the fact checkers out there so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="5.91">tell you what project Looking Glass is</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="5.7">in short in summary okay just give you a</text>
  <text start="144.55" dur="3.66">few sentences and then I&amp;#39;m gonna share</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="2.25">with you some truth in plain sight</text>
  <text start="148.21" dur="2.79">examples</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="4.05">so as we very well know our social</text>
  <text start="151" dur="4.11">engineers they love to put the truth in</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="4.98">plain sight in their media productions</text>
  <text start="155.11" dur="6.03">and they&amp;#39;ve definitely put some project</text>
  <text start="157.96" dur="5.22">lookingglass ask concepts and ideas and</text>
  <text start="161.14" dur="4.23">a lot of movies of theirs so by</text>
  <text start="163.18" dur="3.78">remembering these movies seeing them you</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="3.39">can think oh and you can connect with</text>
  <text start="166.96" dur="3.6">the idea so that&amp;#39;s why I like to do it</text>
  <text start="168.76" dur="3.93">then I&amp;#39;ll take a look at the history of</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="5.7">project Looking Glass what happened in</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="5.7">the early 1900&amp;#39;s that led up to project</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="4.62">Looking Glass and very similar black</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="5.55">projects being ran in the 1970s and 80s</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;m gonna quickly go through sort of</text>
  <text start="183.94" dur="3.269">some relearning</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="5.04">when it comes to time time itself is</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="5.131">incredibly misunderstood as a society so</text>
  <text start="189.85" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;ll do my best to sort of explain it to</text>
  <text start="192.34" dur="6.869">you as I understand it and then at the</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="7.41">end we&amp;#39;re going to analyze the current</text>
  <text start="199.209" dur="5.011">situation that we have between the deep</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="4.89">state and the alliance so of course the</text>
  <text start="204.22" dur="4.59">deep state has been utilizing project</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="3.9">Looking Glass s technologies and</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="4.77">credible technologies for decades but</text>
  <text start="211.18" dur="4.47">now the Alliance the white hats queue</text>
  <text start="213.58" dur="5.52">looks like they&amp;#39;re getting access</text>
  <text start="215.65" dur="4.83">gaining control of the black projects</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="2.88">and the incredible technologies that are</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="3.96">out there and using them against the</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="5.009">deep state so we&amp;#39;ll sort of analyze that</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="5.13">scenario all right and then that</text>
  <text start="226.989" dur="4.861">disclaimer so I&amp;#39;m not gonna spend all</text>
  <text start="229.57" dur="4.62">the time in the world name dropping a</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="5.13">thousand people and sourcing where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="4.98">getting every little claim from okay I</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t need to do that to validate myself</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="3.3">or prove myself or whatever the case</text>
  <text start="240.67" dur="4.65">plus it would take me for freaking ever</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="5.07">what I&amp;#39;m gonna do is in the notable</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="4.83">links in the description below this</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="5.009">video you will see a bunch of articles</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="5.04">and videos and PDFs that I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="4.981">find that you can do your own continuing</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="5.01">education with that you can research</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="6">these contact concepts come to your own</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="6.96">understanding verify what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="6.96">etc etc alright so that&amp;#39;s that I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="267.16" dur="5.58">give it to you how I see it how I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="4.44">researched it the conversations you know</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve had that I&amp;#39;ve learned from it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="4.47">just my perspective folks not just this</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="4.53">video every single video I give you</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="4.62">every single thing I say and not just me</text>
  <text start="281.71" dur="4.05">but every talking head pundit out there</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s just the perspective</text>
  <text start="285.76" dur="6.57">all right so discern properly now what</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="4.62">is project Looking Glass let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="3.65">it here project Looking Glass is a</text>
  <text start="294.31" dur="5.28">project that was done by the</text>
  <text start="295.98" dur="5.32">military-industrial complex by groups</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="4.08">within the intelligence agencies and</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="4.56">also corporate contractors you know when</text>
  <text start="303.67" dur="4.56">you talk black projects it&amp;#39;s never just</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="3.93">one organization and so is groups and</text>
  <text start="308.23" dur="3.39">individuals from multiple but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.79" dur="5.7">basically military-industrial complex</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="7.17">was doing experiments back in the 1970s</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="6.72">and 80s using reverse engineered</text>
  <text start="318.79" dur="3.6">extraterrestrial technologies yes I said</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="2.25">it</text>
  <text start="322.39" dur="4.2">no why kid you not-there using reverse</text>
  <text start="324.46" dur="7.35">engineered extraterrestrial technologies</text>
  <text start="326.59" dur="6.42">to remote view probable futures when it</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="4.29">comes to project looking last</text>
  <text start="333.01" dur="6.99">specifically it wasn&amp;#39;t a time travel</text>
  <text start="336.1" dur="8">device but it was more so allowing a</text>
  <text start="340" dur="7.23">psychically trained individual to view</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="4.87">potential timelines or potential futures</text>
  <text start="347.23" dur="3.51">and the reverse engineered</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="5.699">extraterrestrial technology that they</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="7.65">were using came from a crashed and</text>
  <text start="354.669" dur="6.901">retrieved UFO extraterrestrial craft</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="4.65">they found a crash they were able to get</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="1.83">some bits and pieces of it that still</text>
  <text start="363.04" dur="2.91">worked</text>
  <text start="363.4" dur="4.92">apparently they found a chair that was</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="5.46">still working and this chair acted as a</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="4.8">psychic amplifier so the person&amp;#39;s mental</text>
  <text start="371.41" dur="4.53">capacity their psychic powers were</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="6.06">greatly amplified by this chair there</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="5.94">was also a navigation cube apparently</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="5.52">that was found with these UFO crashes</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="5.22">that worked alongside that chair so the</text>
  <text start="384.7" dur="4.44">chair essentially boosted somebody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="4.62">psychic powers and then they were able</text>
  <text start="389.14" dur="5.25">to use their mind to pilot a spacecraft</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="6.11">faster than the speed of light using</text>
  <text start="394.39" dur="6.24">that particular navigational cube now</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="3.299">that&amp;#39;s a lot I just told you I know and</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="2.719">we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="401.129" dur="4.891">construct every single little piece of</text>
  <text start="403.349" dur="4.83">it now before we do that though what are</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="3.869">some truth in plain sight movies that</text>
  <text start="408.179" dur="3.651">are out there that can help you sort of</text>
  <text start="409.889" dur="5.13">connect with these concepts or ideas and</text>
  <text start="411.83" dur="6.459">show you that I&amp;#39;m not just crazy you</text>
  <text start="415.019" dur="4.86">know these ideas are out there and the</text>
  <text start="418.289" dur="3.42">elite they just love to toy with us</text>
  <text start="419.879" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t they they love the toy with us and</text>
  <text start="421.709" dur="4.74">put the truth in plain sight in their</text>
  <text start="423.179" dur="5.91">production so a few movies that have had</text>
  <text start="426.449" dur="3.72">this sort of technology concepts ideas</text>
  <text start="429.089" dur="3.78">in them</text>
  <text start="430.169" dur="5.85">number one Total Recall Arnold</text>
  <text start="432.869" dur="5.371">Schwarzenegger in 1990 Total Recall he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.019" dur="4.98">got a psychic chair that sends him on</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="4.379">some you know consciousness excursion</text>
  <text start="440.999" dur="3.15">right there and that was only a few</text>
  <text start="442.619" dur="4.23">years after I think that movie came out</text>
  <text start="444.149" dur="4.5">yeah only like a few years after project</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="3.75">looking glass in the Montauk Project</text>
  <text start="448.649" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re done - we&amp;#39;ve got the matrix</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="4.22">another movie where they&amp;#39;re hooked into</text>
  <text start="452.279" dur="5.1">a chair and they&amp;#39;re sent off into this</text>
  <text start="454.819" dur="4.72">consciousness realm or this astral realm</text>
  <text start="457.379" dur="3.78">right now in the matrix they had to be</text>
  <text start="459.539" dur="3.42">physically plugged into the chair and</text>
  <text start="461.159" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s of course not the case these days</text>
  <text start="462.959" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s these psychic chairs of these sorts</text>
  <text start="466.379" dur="3.78">of technologies consciousness assisted</text>
  <text start="468.329" dur="4.23">technologies they work with just</text>
  <text start="470.159" dur="4.02">electromagnetism waveforms so luckily</text>
  <text start="472.559" dur="5.31">you&amp;#39;ll have to plug anything into your</text>
  <text start="474.179" dur="6.57">head or get a chip Minority Report I</text>
  <text start="477.869" dur="4.2">think that one came out in 2000 with Tom</text>
  <text start="480.749" dur="3.96">Cruise holy crap</text>
  <text start="482.069" dur="5.07">like right there they&amp;#39;ve got the three</text>
  <text start="484.709" dur="4.95">psychics that sit in the chairs with the</text>
  <text start="487.139" dur="4.08">things up to their temples trying to you</text>
  <text start="489.659" dur="4.68">know connect in with their pineal glands</text>
  <text start="491.219" dur="4.71">and they&amp;#39;re suspended in water as well</text>
  <text start="494.339" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;ll also talk about why water is</text>
  <text start="495.929" dur="5.1">important with the project Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="497.729" dur="5.06">device itself but anyway psychics right</text>
  <text start="501.029" dur="3.42">there and they&amp;#39;re trying to Remote View</text>
  <text start="502.789" dur="3.46">potentially what&amp;#39;s going to happen in</text>
  <text start="504.449" dur="4.351">the future the Tom Cruise in has to go</text>
  <text start="506.249" dur="5.13">you know try to avert and then contact</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="4.019">this movie is probably the biggest one</text>
  <text start="511.379" dur="5.04">when it comes to project Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="512.819" dur="6.84">in plain sight is contact because the</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="7.02">device itself the device that was shown</text>
  <text start="519.659" dur="5.761">in contact you had the rings the</text>
  <text start="523.439" dur="4.65">concentric rings basically that all spun</text>
  <text start="525.42" dur="6.419">around each other and this device was</text>
  <text start="528.089" dur="6.091">supposed to create this electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="531.839" dur="2.94">bubble this electromagnetic shielding</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="2.849">the</text>
  <text start="534.779" dur="5.37">of course drop Jodie Foster through and</text>
  <text start="537.029" dur="4.771">then she traveled through space and time</text>
  <text start="540.149" dur="4.29">basically her consciousness traveled</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="6.539">really and she went off into these other</text>
  <text start="544.439" dur="6.06">realms so huh Wow there&amp;#39;s a lot and</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s a lot more you know stargate sg1</text>
  <text start="550.499" dur="4.2">is another one lots of disclosure in</text>
  <text start="552.749" dur="4.351">that show but they basically have this</text>
  <text start="554.699" dur="5.94">like ring transporter in the show that</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="6.719">they teleport with but that&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="560.639" dur="4.62">like how you know very loose depictions</text>
  <text start="563.819" dur="4.46">very exaggerated of course they</text>
  <text start="565.259" dur="6">Hollywood these films out but</text>
  <text start="568.279" dur="5.56">generalities incredible right there for</text>
  <text start="571.259" dur="4.89">us so now let&amp;#39;s get into the history of</text>
  <text start="573.839" dur="4.17">Project Looking Glass itself and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.149" dur="4.38">going to start discussing some</text>
  <text start="578.009" dur="5.341">big-picture concepts of the early 1900s</text>
  <text start="580.529" dur="6.271">so in the early 1900s you have to</text>

  <text start="607.759" dur="5.68">Nazi Germany much more so over there</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="5.459">though but the worldwide secret</text>
  <text start="613.439" dur="4.83">societies were on the hunt for as much</text>
  <text start="615.809" dur="4.71">true science as they could possibly find</text>
  <text start="618.269" dur="5.51">in the early 1900s that could have been</text>
  <text start="620.519" dur="5.911">how to control gravity anti-gravity or</text>
  <text start="623.779" dur="5.92">electrogravitic technologies that could</text>

  <text start="635.399" dur="4.29">all these sorts of things are sort of</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="4.44">connected anyway so they were just try</text>
  <text start="639.689" dur="3.87">on the hunt for it man I mean we know</text>
  <text start="641.55" dur="5.849">that Nikola Tesla&amp;#39;s papers ended up as</text>
  <text start="643.559" dur="6.15">part of the FBI and fun fact if you can</text>
  <text start="647.399" dur="3.69">figure out whose uncle took Nikola</text>

  <text start="651.089" dur="4.05">behalf of the FBI that&amp;#39;s a story for</text>

  <text start="655.139" dur="4.68">papers there were all sorts of UFO</text>
  <text start="656.91" dur="5.64">crashes there was Roswell Roswell wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.819" dur="5.88">the only one there was also allegedly</text>
  <text start="662.55" dur="5.25">very likely a couple of crashed UFO</text>
  <text start="665.699" dur="2.95">craft that happened over Long Beach</text>
  <text start="667.8" dur="2.709">Harbor</text>
  <text start="668.649" dur="5.821">the Battle of la incident that happened</text>
  <text start="670.509" dur="6.031">in 1942 I believe the army got a downed</text>
  <text start="674.47" dur="4.14">craft and the Navy was able to pick up</text>
  <text start="676.54" dur="3.899">and down craft from that incident as</text>
  <text start="678.61" dur="5.37">well incredible incident go research the</text>
  <text start="680.439" dur="5.34">Battle of LA but anyway multiple crash</text>
  <text start="683.98" dur="3.719">retrievals happened in the 1940s</text>
  <text start="685.779" dur="4.441">possibly others that we haven&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="687.699" dur="3.961">about there was Tesla&amp;#39;s papers there</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="2.969">were you know the Nazis over there in</text>
  <text start="691.66" dur="3.63">Germany we&amp;#39;re getting all sorts of</text>
  <text start="693.189" dur="4.861">technologies from viktor schauberger and</text>
  <text start="695.29" dur="6.029">the you know the royal secret society in</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="5.069">various other ways so all this got</text>
  <text start="701.319" dur="5.731">sucked up into the deep state&amp;#39;s hands</text>
  <text start="703.119" dur="6.241">and we haven&amp;#39;t heard much about it but</text>
  <text start="707.05" dur="6.12">of course if they get say any sort of</text>
  <text start="709.36" dur="5.789">downed UFO crash or figure out anything</text>
  <text start="713.17" dur="3.479">about an ancient ruin that&amp;#39;s giving them</text>
  <text start="715.149" dur="4.47">an understanding as some incredible</text>
  <text start="716.649" dur="3.78">technology they&amp;#39;re gonna try to use it</text>
  <text start="719.619" dur="2.431">for themselves</text>
  <text start="720.429" dur="3.57">of course the deep state they want as</text>
  <text start="722.05" dur="3.269">much power and control as they can so if</text>
  <text start="723.999" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re going to get any sort of crash</text>
  <text start="725.319" dur="3.81">retrieval they&amp;#39;re gonna take all the</text>
  <text start="726.999" dur="4.291">bits and pieces out of it that they can</text>
  <text start="729.129" dur="4.95">use and reverse-engineer it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="731.29" dur="6.12">exactly what they were doing so one of</text>
  <text start="734.079" dur="6.45">the UFO crashes that they got it said</text>
  <text start="737.41" dur="4.409">it&amp;#39;s the Roswell crash like I said could</text>
  <text start="740.529" dur="3.48">have been a different one because</text>
  <text start="741.819" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s been multiple they were able to</text>
  <text start="744.009" dur="6.031">get a chair from the craft that was</text>
  <text start="747.279" dur="4.62">essentially a psychic amplifying chair</text>
  <text start="750.04" dur="3.959">much like so those chairs I was</text>
  <text start="751.899" dur="5.13">describing in the it&amp;#39;s depicted in the</text>
  <text start="753.999" dur="6.63">media films there&amp;#39;s a psychic amplifying</text>
  <text start="757.029" dur="5.91">chair and the individual would sit in it</text>
  <text start="760.629" dur="4.14">being a human or you know in this case</text>
  <text start="762.939" dur="3.81">an extraterrestrial being piloting their</text>
  <text start="764.769" dur="4.17">UFO they would sit in this cyclic</text>
  <text start="766.749" dur="4.111">psychic amplifying chair and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="768.939" dur="3.781">they would pilot their craft I mean</text>
  <text start="770.86" dur="3.599">we&amp;#39;re not talking about rocket</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="5.219">propulsion here folks that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="774.459" dur="5.82">sold to us in the mainstream in regards</text>
  <text start="777.939" dur="3.721">to space travel for decades and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="780.279" dur="4.05">a reason for that because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="781.66" dur="6.239">to hide all of these secrets and all</text>
  <text start="784.329" dur="6.51">this stuff and when it comes to this</text>
  <text start="787.899" dur="7.5">sort of tech going faster than the speed</text>
  <text start="790.839" dur="7.79">of light you have to navigate in not</text>
  <text start="795.399" dur="5.761">only three dimensions of space but a</text>
  <text start="798.629" dur="3.671">dimension of time that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="801.16" dur="2.73">discuss and that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="802.3" dur="4.74">pilot it with their freaking mind they</text>
  <text start="803.89" dur="5.34">meditate on the point in space and time</text>
  <text start="807.04" dur="4.62">that they want to go to the chair of</text>
  <text start="809.23" dur="5.55">course amplifies their abilities to do</text>
  <text start="811.66" dur="5.13">so a portal or a Stargate or a wormhole</text>
  <text start="814.78" dur="3.93">or an einstein-rosen bridge whatever you</text>
  <text start="816.79" dur="5.01">want to call it opens up and the craft</text>
  <text start="818.71" dur="6.75">goes through it alright I know it sounds</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="5.85">nuts but there&amp;#39;s stuff out there to</text>
  <text start="825.46" dur="4.23">corroborate this so that&amp;#39;s how the</text>
  <text start="827.65" dur="3.96">beings were flying their craft the deep</text>
  <text start="829.69" dur="3.69">state were trying to reverse-engineer</text>
  <text start="831.61" dur="4.71">those like how the heck did this psychic</text>
  <text start="833.38" dur="5.58">amplifier work and not just that but</text>
  <text start="836.32" dur="4.41">there was a navigational component</text>
  <text start="838.96" dur="4.11">involved as well but the navigational</text>
  <text start="840.73" dur="4.8">component that helped them navigate</text>
  <text start="843.07" dur="4.11">space and time to fly faster than the</text>
  <text start="845.53" dur="3.45">speed of light or travel faster the</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="3.27">speed of light really wasn&amp;#39;t involved in</text>
  <text start="848.98" dur="4.2">project Looking Glass project Looking</text>
  <text start="850.45" dur="5.01">Glass was simply temporal viewing not</text>
  <text start="853.18" dur="4.37">temporal travel but we&amp;#39;ll touch on the</text>
  <text start="855.46" dur="4.11">travel part of it here in a little bit</text>
  <text start="857.55" dur="4">so that&amp;#39;s how they got the technology</text>
  <text start="859.57" dur="4.11">let&amp;#39;s get into now project Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="861.55" dur="5.01">in the 70s and 80s so project Looking</text>
  <text start="863.68" dur="5.88">Glass was a legend to mainly have taken</text>
  <text start="866.56" dur="4.77">place at the S Force facility near area</text>
  <text start="869.56" dur="6.21">51 in Nevada</text>
  <text start="871.33" dur="6.99">s4 alright and it goes to be set here a</text>
  <text start="875.77" dur="6.17">project that was very similar to project</text>
  <text start="878.32" dur="5.82">Looking Glass doing experiments in time</text>
  <text start="881.94" dur="4.24">most likely in my head that they were</text>
  <text start="884.14" dur="3.72">connected in some way you know involved</text>
  <text start="886.18" dur="4.14">with each other they happened near the</text>
  <text start="887.86" dur="4.26">same time and involved in the same</text>
  <text start="890.32" dur="5.94">experiments but anyway the Montauk</text>
  <text start="892.12" dur="6.06">Project in New York and this many more</text>
  <text start="896.26" dur="4.35">people are familiar with the Montauk</text>
  <text start="898.18" dur="4.02">Project because they&amp;#39;ve seen stranger</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="2.94">things you know there&amp;#39;s another truth in</text>
  <text start="902.2" dur="1.86">plain sight right there stranger things</text>
  <text start="903.55" dur="2.91">Wow</text>
  <text start="904.06" dur="6.24">you&amp;#39;ve got this psychic chick that is</text>
  <text start="906.46" dur="5.73">using her abilities to basically astral</text>
  <text start="910.3" dur="5.34">project herself into this different</text>
  <text start="912.19" dur="5.37">realm where space and time are different</text>
  <text start="915.64" dur="4.89">you know she can remote view different</text>
  <text start="917.56" dur="6.06">points in space and time anyway Montauk</text>
  <text start="920.53" dur="4.56">Project and plg that&amp;#39;s what really</text>
  <text start="923.62" dur="3.24">happened with the Montauk Project you</text>
  <text start="925.09" dur="3.96">won&amp;#39;t of course see that admitted in the</text>
  <text start="926.86" dur="4.08">mainstream they just water it down in</text>
  <text start="929.05" dur="3.75">the mainstream but that&amp;#39;s what was</text>
  <text start="930.94" dur="5.4">happening they were doing experiments in</text>
  <text start="932.8" dur="6.09">time not just trying to remote view</text>
  <text start="936.34" dur="4.98">points in time but then of course you</text>
  <text start="938.89" dur="4.62">know naturally they&amp;#39;re gonna try sending</text>
  <text start="941.32" dur="4.68">things through time so we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="943.51" dur="4.5">all that in a minute once we discuss the</text>
  <text start="946" dur="4.02">science of time but first amazingly</text>
  <text start="948.01" dur="3.99">enough the project Looking Glass devices</text>
  <text start="950.02" dur="3.509">device itself with those concentric</text>
  <text start="952" dur="3.24">rings trying to make this</text>
  <text start="953.529" dur="3.781">electromagnetic shielding then you have</text>
  <text start="955.24" dur="3.42">the water that I mentioned the water in</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="3.42">the device as well which is very</text>
  <text start="958.66" dur="4.89">important because water acts as like an</text>
  <text start="960.73" dur="6.27">electrical superconductor so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="963.55" dur="6.66">creating like a viewing portal a viewing</text>
  <text start="967" dur="7.08">Stargate right the plg device is based</text>
  <text start="970.21" dur="5.79">around our pineal glands freaking pineal</text>
  <text start="974.08" dur="5.42">glands there&amp;#39;s so much knowledge about</text>
  <text start="976" dur="7.29">ourselves that is so lost and is so</text>
  <text start="979.5" dur="7.38">misconstrued in the mainstream world but</text>
  <text start="983.29" dur="6.27">our pineal gland is basically like a</text>
  <text start="986.88" dur="4.899">crystal transducer I mean it&amp;#39;s a viewing</text>
  <text start="989.56" dur="3.99">device think of it you&amp;#39;ve got this</text>
  <text start="991.779" dur="4.681">these piezoelectric crystals in your</text>
  <text start="993.55" dur="6.3">pineal gland and all this DMT and say</text>
  <text start="996.46" dur="6.69">when you&amp;#39;re sleeping it&amp;#39;s projecting</text>
  <text start="999.85" dur="5.25">your astral self into a different realm</text>
  <text start="1003.15" dur="4.05">where literally space and time are</text>
  <text start="1005.1" dur="3.54">different right like that that&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1007.2" dur="3.33">like a project looking glass viewing</text>
  <text start="1008.64" dur="7.11">device your pineal gland every single</text>
  <text start="1010.53" dur="7.05">one of us have these god-given pineal</text>
  <text start="1015.75" dur="4.55">glands god-given DNA these god-given</text>
  <text start="1017.58" dur="5.04">abilities to do this all right</text>
  <text start="1020.3" dur="3.49">credibly enough you&amp;#39;ve got to train</text>
  <text start="1022.62" dur="2.699">yourself yeah</text>
  <text start="1023.79" dur="2.94">got to train yourself get your mind in</text>
  <text start="1025.319" dur="3.841">your body healthy and grounded and</text>
  <text start="1026.73" dur="5.849">understand these different concepts of</text>
  <text start="1029.16" dur="6.06">mind and actual physics and metaphysics</text>
  <text start="1032.579" dur="5.461">but anyway project Looking Glass device</text>
  <text start="1035.22" dur="5.82">based around our pineal gland with the</text>
  <text start="1038.04" dur="7.289">the electricity and the transducin as&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="1041.04" dur="6.21">and the way the electromagnetic fields</text>
  <text start="1045.329" dur="4.471">work with the piezoelectricity in there</text>
  <text start="1047.25" dur="4.59">with the water incredible stuff now the</text>
  <text start="1049.8" dur="4.02">experiments like I said we&amp;#39;re being done</text>
  <text start="1051.84" dur="4.86">with time they were trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="1053.82" dur="4.67">what the heck time really is because</text>
  <text start="1056.7" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s nothing like that&amp;#39;s promoted in</text>
  <text start="1058.49" dur="5.5">mainstream lore but the problem they</text>
  <text start="1061.679" dur="3.691">were having with Looking Glass because</text>
  <text start="1063.99" dur="2.939">these deep state folks they&amp;#39;re arrogant</text>
  <text start="1065.37" dur="4.809">beyond belief</text>
  <text start="1066.929" dur="7.181">they were believing that time is linear</text>
  <text start="1070.179" dur="5.88">time is not linear this arrow of time</text>
  <text start="1074.11" dur="4.139">stuff that&amp;#39;s promoted like I said in the</text>
  <text start="1076.059" dur="4.411">mainstream science lore where all their</text>
  <text start="1078.249" dur="5.13">foundations of thinking are just messed</text>
  <text start="1080.47" dur="4.319">up and the deep state you know when they</text>
  <text start="1083.379" dur="2.79">were doing the initial project Looking</text>
  <text start="1084.789" dur="3.27">Glass experiments in the seventies and</text>
  <text start="1086.169" dur="3.75">eighties they kept thinking time was</text>
  <text start="1088.059" dur="4.5">linear so that&amp;#39;s why they kept getting</text>
  <text start="1089.919" dur="4.651">problems within project looking glass</text>
  <text start="1092.559" dur="3.901">and montauk you know and this</text>
  <text start="1094.57" dur="3.809">misunderstanding of time is what</text>
  <text start="1096.46" dur="5.099">eventually led them to call it project</text>
  <text start="1098.379" dur="4.74">Looking Glass because much like Alice in</text>
  <text start="1101.559" dur="3.631">Wonderland when she was in the Hall of</text>
  <text start="1103.119" dur="5.76">Mirrors when they were taking different</text>
  <text start="1105.19" dur="5.459">observers to remote view a future they</text>
  <text start="1108.879" dur="4.41">were assuming that time is a linear</text>
  <text start="1110.649" dur="4.98">measurement when it&amp;#39;s not so they kept</text>
  <text start="1113.289" dur="4.411">getting reflections upon reflections in</text>
  <text start="1115.629" dur="4.581">what they were viewing with each one</text>
  <text start="1117.7" dur="6.359">just looking a tiny little bit different</text>
  <text start="1120.21" dur="5.349">crazy stuff so that&amp;#39;s what led them to</text>
  <text start="1124.059" dur="3.48">call it project looking-glasses because</text>
  <text start="1125.559" dur="3.75">they really didn&amp;#39;t understand time and</text>
  <text start="1127.539" dur="3.39">now let&amp;#39;s get let&amp;#39;s just get into that</text>
  <text start="1129.309" dur="6.24">science of time so I&amp;#39;m gonna erase this</text>
  <text start="1130.929" dur="6.811">all right here all right freeze up some</text>
  <text start="1135.549" dur="4.11">space so I will name drop the name of</text>
  <text start="1137.74" dur="4.559">one individual and that&amp;#39;s where I get</text>
  <text start="1139.659" dur="7.201">some of these Sciences and ideas from</text>
  <text start="1142.299" dur="6.061">and his name with Dewey B Larson I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1146.86" dur="3.389">done some videos on him before I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1148.36" dur="4.08">definitely do some videos on his ideas</text>
  <text start="1150.249" dur="3.81">coming up more in depth now that this</text>
  <text start="1152.44" dur="3.599">project Looking Glass stuff is out there</text>
  <text start="1154.059" dur="4.651">but Dewey B Larson did some incredible</text>
  <text start="1156.039" dur="4.77">work into really understanding space and</text>
  <text start="1158.71" dur="6.829">time and their true relationship with</text>
  <text start="1160.809" dur="8.041">each other so time is not</text>
  <text start="1165.539" dur="6.61">one-dimensional we perceive it to be in</text>
  <text start="1168.85" dur="4.59">this particular physical realm that</text>
  <text start="1172.149" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;re in it feels like there&amp;#39;s three</text>
  <text start="1173.44" dur="4.29">dimensions of space and time is one</text>
  <text start="1175.119" dur="8.371">dimensional but it&amp;#39;s not time is the</text>
  <text start="1177.73" dur="11.159">reciprocal of space so think of time</text>
  <text start="1183.49" dur="10.049">also having a 3d structure to it time</text>
  <text start="1188.889" dur="6.42">being 3d what well let me draw you a</text>
  <text start="1193.539" dur="5.431">little picture here so time</text>
  <text start="1195.309" dur="6.75">3-dimensional imagine this dot is right</text>
  <text start="1198.97" dur="4.83">now right now is actually the only thing</text>
  <text start="1202.059" dur="3.751">that truly</text>
  <text start="1203.8" dur="4.86">exists if you were to freeze the moment</text>
  <text start="1205.81" dur="5.1">of now or take a screenshot of it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1208.66" dur="2.73">all that would exist in space and in</text>
  <text start="1210.91" dur="3.06">time</text>
  <text start="1211.39" dur="6.33">but everything&amp;#39;s in motion both space</text>
  <text start="1213.97" dur="7.02">and time so we can&amp;#39;t freeze-frame right</text>
  <text start="1217.72" dur="5.61">now but what the future is imagine this</text>
  <text start="1220.99" dur="4.71">this is the future here this this</text>
  <text start="1223.33" dur="7.14">rectangle square and this is the past</text>
  <text start="1225.7" dur="7.16">okay past and then we have future the</text>
  <text start="1230.47" dur="3.57">past in the future aren&amp;#39;t set in stone</text>
  <text start="1232.86" dur="2.35">okay</text>
  <text start="1234.04" dur="3.63">they really don&amp;#39;t exist anymore because</text>
  <text start="1235.21" dur="5.25">all that exists is now the past and the</text>
  <text start="1237.67" dur="4.02">future are abstractions and this is what</text>
  <text start="1240.46" dur="3.18">they didn&amp;#39;t understand doing project</text>
  <text start="1241.69" dur="4.38">Looking Glass is that it&amp;#39;s not a linear</text>
  <text start="1243.64" dur="3.99">time measurement where the past is set</text>
  <text start="1246.07" dur="3.54">in stone and then the future set in</text>
  <text start="1247.63" dur="3.9">stone all this it&amp;#39;s just abstractions</text>
  <text start="1249.61" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s you can think of it as potentials</text>
  <text start="1251.53" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s why when I say project</text>
  <text start="1253.09" dur="4.05">looking-glasses remote-viewing potential</text>
  <text start="1254.98" dur="3.87">timelines we don&amp;#39;t know what the future</text>

  <text start="1258.85" dur="3.42">hold whatever we make it to be it all</text>
  <text start="1261.01" dur="2.88">depends on our choices there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1262.27" dur="3.78">infinite different ways that it could</text>
  <text start="1263.89" dur="4.11">play out so with project Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="1266.05" dur="4.83">you know really what they were doing is</text>
  <text start="1268" dur="4.98">trying to remote view the potential in</text>
  <text start="1270.88" dur="3.75">future you know see what was really</text>
  <text start="1272.98" dur="3.63">going to happen and of course the</text>
  <text start="1274.63" dur="4.26">farther and farther you get away from</text>
  <text start="1276.61" dur="5.34">this moment of now that means the more</text>
  <text start="1278.89" dur="5.13">and more choices the more and more cause</text>
  <text start="1281.95" dur="4.62">and effects that could happen and then</text>
  <text start="1284.02" dur="4.89">the sloppier and sloppier that any</text>
  <text start="1286.57" dur="4.98">remote view or an assumption is gonna</text>
  <text start="1288.91" dur="5.7">start getting so that&amp;#39;s essentially like</text>
  <text start="1291.55" dur="5.31">time you know it&amp;#39;s being a 3d structure</text>
  <text start="1294.61" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s the reciprocal of space just like</text>
  <text start="1296.86" dur="4.32">no two points can exist in space at the</text>
  <text start="1299.14" dur="5.19">exact same time no two things can exist</text>
  <text start="1301.18" dur="6.96">at the exact same point in time at the</text>
  <text start="1304.33" dur="6.87">exact same time so this whole time</text>
  <text start="1308.14" dur="5.04">travel thing it gets really really messy</text>
  <text start="1311.2" dur="3.57">you know the whole remote viewing in</text>
  <text start="1313.18" dur="2.91">time thing that&amp;#39;s simple they just you</text>
  <text start="1314.77" dur="2.88">know hook themselves up to a psychic</text>
  <text start="1316.09" dur="3.33">chair train somebody to be able to use</text>
  <text start="1317.65" dur="4.26">it and they can try the remote viewing</text>
  <text start="1319.42" dur="5.79">thing but the whole travel of it gets</text>
  <text start="1321.91" dur="6.57">really tricky because then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1325.21" dur="5.01">playing with timelines that really you</text>
  <text start="1328.48" dur="3.69">know shouldn&amp;#39;t be toyed with you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1330.22" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re playing with that Tree of Life</text>
  <text start="1332.17" dur="5.38">that shouldn&amp;#39;t be shook so the issues</text>
  <text start="1335.14" dur="6.46">that they came up with when it came to</text>
  <text start="1337.55" dur="5.79">lookingglass was uh I mean they were in</text>
  <text start="1341.6" dur="4.98">Montauk you know they were doing all</text>
  <text start="1343.34" dur="8.1">sorts of experiments so with you know</text>
  <text start="1346.58" dur="6.27">the Montauk Project people were getting</text>
  <text start="1351.44" dur="2.85">hurt you know and they would experiment</text>
  <text start="1352.85" dur="2.61">try to send people through these</text>
  <text start="1354.29" dur="2.94">experiments they would came back</text>
  <text start="1355.46" dur="3.33">incredibly sick you here with the</text>
  <text start="1357.23" dur="3.81">Philadelphia Experiment which was a</text>
  <text start="1358.79" dur="4.02">precursor to all this stuff</text>
  <text start="1361.04" dur="5.25">Philadelphia experience back in the 40s</text>
  <text start="1362.81" dur="7.08">where they put giant electro magnetic</text>
  <text start="1366.29" dur="4.62">charges on a ship and tried to pour it</text>
  <text start="1369.89" dur="3.06">on the ship somewhere and bring it back</text>
  <text start="1370.91" dur="3.84">well they couldn&amp;#39;t really bring it back</text>
  <text start="1372.95" dur="3.54">and apparently when it did come back</text>
  <text start="1374.75" dur="3.96">everything was all screwed up and you</text>
  <text start="1376.49" dur="3.84">had like tools missing or in the walls</text>
  <text start="1378.71" dur="5.43">and people were sick and just all sorts</text>
  <text start="1380.33" dur="6.54">of stuff so traveling traversing actual</text>
  <text start="1384.14" dur="4.8">time or that time-space realm is very</text>
  <text start="1386.87" dur="3.27">very tricky it&amp;#39;s not you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="1388.94" dur="3.36">people think oh that time travel is</text>
  <text start="1390.14" dur="4.17">possible and assume it&amp;#39;s like done all</text>
  <text start="1392.3" dur="5.22">the time but not so much although the</text>
  <text start="1394.31" dur="5.28">remote viewing of it oh yeah I would</text>
  <text start="1397.52" dur="4.38">looks like it&amp;#39;s currently being done -</text>
  <text start="1399.59" dur="5.61">you know this gets us into the last</text>
  <text start="1401.9" dur="6.09">thing to talk about here is what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1405.2" dur="6.09">on with project Looking Glass now so it</text>
  <text start="1407.99" dur="5.94">was said that in the 70s and 80s that</text>
  <text start="1411.29" dur="6.12">project Looking Glass ran into a problem</text>
  <text start="1413.93" dur="6.6">with this date right here the 2012</text>
  <text start="1417.41" dur="6.27">quandry enigma problem anomaly they were</text>
  <text start="1420.53" dur="6.57">having in that in the 70s in plg when</text>
  <text start="1423.68" dur="5.67">they were trying to view anything around</text>
  <text start="1427.1" dur="4.05">2012 or later basically this year or</text>
  <text start="1429.35" dur="5.13">later they couldn&amp;#39;t view it</text>
  <text start="1431.15" dur="5.16">they couldn&amp;#39;t even see it and each</text>
  <text start="1434.48" dur="4.05">observer that they were putting in to</text>
  <text start="1436.31" dur="5.28">try to see 2012 they weren&amp;#39;t seeing any</text>
  <text start="1438.53" dur="5.82">sort of reality basically they were just</text>
  <text start="1441.59" dur="6.27">having spiritual experiences like they</text>
  <text start="1444.35" dur="5.67">were getting opened to cosmic</text>
  <text start="1447.86" dur="5.1">consciousness and they weren&amp;#39;t seeing</text>
  <text start="1450.02" dur="4.26">any sort of reality it was just like it</text>
  <text start="1452.96" dur="2.73">was like a white light they were seeing</text>
  <text start="1454.28" dur="5.39">and having a spiritual experience each</text>
  <text start="1455.69" dur="6.81">one was recollecting that so I think</text>
  <text start="1459.67" dur="6.22">with this particular time frame with</text>
  <text start="1462.5" dur="6.03">2012 you know when we hear of shoot all</text>
  <text start="1465.89" dur="4.97">of them the Mayans the Native Americans</text>
  <text start="1468.53" dur="4.82">all the ancient scriptures</text>
  <text start="1470.86" dur="4.92">the sizing these times as they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1473.35" dur="5.19">a change in the fundamental dynamics of</text>
  <text start="1475.78" dur="5.31">our society and even our cosmos here</text>
  <text start="1478.54" dur="6.75">like they all new based upon whatever</text>
  <text start="1481.09" dur="6.63">astrology or or their own myths and</text>
  <text start="1485.29" dur="5.33">Bibles or whatever they knew that this</text>
  <text start="1487.72" dur="6.93">state was going to be a change in</text>
  <text start="1490.62" dur="7.63">humanity and I think it&amp;#39;s a literally</text>
  <text start="1494.65" dur="5.04">change in the like principles or the</text>
  <text start="1498.25" dur="3.36">functions of our collective</text>
  <text start="1499.69" dur="5.64">consciousness you could think of this is</text>
  <text start="1501.61" dur="5.43">like us creating our own reality time so</text>
  <text start="1505.33" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s why in project Looking Glass they</text>
  <text start="1507.04" dur="4.95">couldn&amp;#39;t see anything past 2012 because</text>
  <text start="1509.02" dur="7.289">it&amp;#39;s basically our earth moving into</text>
  <text start="1511.99" dur="5.85">that new awakening phase whatever you</text>
  <text start="1516.309" dur="3.601">want to call it and it&amp;#39;s changing the</text>
  <text start="1517.84" dur="3.66">dynamics of things so they couldn&amp;#39;t view</text>
  <text start="1519.91" dur="3.509">it with remote viewers and project</text>
  <text start="1521.5" dur="4.08">Looking Glass but that being said you</text>
  <text start="1523.419" dur="3.63">know that was like 40 years ago 50 years</text>
  <text start="1525.58" dur="1.74">ago that they were doing these sorts of</text>
  <text start="1527.049" dur="1.951">things</text>
  <text start="1527.32" dur="4.14">I don&amp;#39;t doubt now that they&amp;#39;re sort of</text>
  <text start="1529" dur="4.94">some sort of modern variant where</text>
  <text start="1531.46" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re able to still Remote View</text>
  <text start="1533.94" dur="5.14">potential futures even though it&amp;#39;s past</text>
  <text start="1536.11" dur="5.13">2012 you know if you take an individual</text>
  <text start="1539.08" dur="3.9">out of it and whatever subconscious</text>
  <text start="1541.24" dur="4.02">biases they might have with their remote</text>
  <text start="1542.98" dur="6.66">viewing practice and start using</text>
  <text start="1545.26" dur="8.25">computer algorithms to gauge these</text>
  <text start="1549.64" dur="6.33">things you know maybe it will maybe that</text>
  <text start="1553.51" dur="5.49">improves the efficiency or allows them</text>
  <text start="1555.97" dur="4.709">to use it past 2012 you know with Q</text>
  <text start="1559" dur="3.99">dropping project Looking Glass right</text>
  <text start="1560.679" dur="5.101">after discussing artificial intelligence</text>
  <text start="1562.99" dur="4.77">and a global surveillance grid that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1565.78" dur="3.389">exactly why the deep state was doing</text>
  <text start="1567.76" dur="3.33">project Looking Glass in the first place</text>
  <text start="1569.169" dur="4.081">they wanted to know the future so they</text>
  <text start="1571.09" dur="4.92">could control the outcome and try to get</text>
  <text start="1573.25" dur="6.21">this particular you know timeline into</text>
  <text start="1576.01" dur="6">this moment of now into that future that</text>
  <text start="1579.46" dur="4.92">they wanted but now we&amp;#39;re at a point</text>
  <text start="1582.01" dur="5.82">where it&amp;#39;s us create our own reality</text>
  <text start="1584.38" dur="5.22">time it&amp;#39;s not working anymore because</text>
  <text start="1587.83" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re all beginning to think for</text>
  <text start="1589.6" dur="3.24">ourselves we&amp;#39;re breaking the matrix</text>
  <text start="1591.16" dur="3.69">basically and we&amp;#39;re breaking their</text>
  <text start="1592.84" dur="3.089">ability to predict the future because</text>
  <text start="1594.85" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re all beginning to think for</text>
  <text start="1595.929" dur="4.561">ourselves and it&amp;#39;s the reason they data</text>
  <text start="1598.57" dur="4.47">- so much they&amp;#39;re trying to predict us</text>
  <text start="1600.49" dur="3.74">you know we&amp;#39;re beings of pattern we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1603.04" dur="2.509">beings of habit so</text>
  <text start="1604.23" dur="2.939">they can get as much data as they</text>
  <text start="1605.549" dur="4.291">possibly freakin can with Google and</text>
  <text start="1607.169" dur="5.25">Facebook and Amazon on us put all that</text>
  <text start="1609.84" dur="5.13">together and some giant AI algorithm or</text>
  <text start="1612.419" dur="4.471">some super strong computer and feed that</text>
  <text start="1614.97" dur="4.38">and it may be some project Looking Glass</text>
  <text start="1616.89" dur="3.659">device and put that on a screen I think</text>
  <text start="1619.35" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s what the deep states really</text>
  <text start="1620.549" dur="4.561">trying to do because these technologies</text>
  <text start="1623.52" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t really work like they used to and</text>
  <text start="1625.11" dur="4.319">now they&amp;#39;re trying to you know back when</text>
  <text start="1627.9" dur="4.14">project Looking Glass was going on</text>
  <text start="1629.429" dur="4.081">IBM only had you know tiny little</text>
  <text start="1632.04" dur="3.24">computers it took up rooms now the</text>
  <text start="1633.51" dur="3.539">computational power we have for these</text>
  <text start="1635.28" dur="4.71">sorts of things is much more improved</text>
  <text start="1637.049" dur="4.471">and of course AI so you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1639.99" dur="3.36">basically what I&amp;#39;m saying here is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1641.52" dur="5.279">sure there&amp;#39;s a lot of modern variants in</text>
  <text start="1643.35" dur="5.31">project Looking Glass sort of stuff that</text>
  <text start="1646.799" dur="4.051">they&amp;#39;re using these days project names</text>
  <text start="1648.66" dur="4.62">that we have no clue of and technologies</text>
  <text start="1650.85" dur="3.66">that we you know probably barely</text>
  <text start="1653.28" dur="3.269">understand I&amp;#39;m sure they barely</text>
  <text start="1654.51" dur="6.659">understand them too but they have them</text>
  <text start="1656.549" dur="8.211">and cue now looks to be when they say</text>
  <text start="1661.169" dur="6.211">going forward in order to look back</text>
  <text start="1664.76" dur="6.37">sounds like they are using some sort of</text>
  <text start="1667.38" dur="5.82">project looking-glass variant to predict</text>
  <text start="1671.13" dur="4.289">the moves of their enemies of the deep</text>
  <text start="1673.2" dur="4.59">state I mean absolutely they have access</text>
  <text start="1675.419" dur="5.491">to it now you know if they control</text>
  <text start="1677.79" dur="6.48">whatever the NSA has whenever black</text>
  <text start="1680.91" dur="7.44">projects are there totally absolutely</text>
  <text start="1684.27" dur="5.52">and when you look at the metaphors that</text>
  <text start="1688.35" dur="2.91">have been given to us by queue since the</text>
  <text start="1689.79" dur="3.81">beginning such as Alice in Wonderland</text>
  <text start="1691.26" dur="5.25">and follow the White Rabbit you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1693.6" dur="4.8">looking at them hinting to us the whole</text>
  <text start="1696.51" dur="3.21">time and not just that but hinting to</text>
  <text start="1698.4" dur="3.72">the deep state like they were telling</text>
  <text start="1699.72" dur="4.56">the deep state it in the beginning using</text>
  <text start="1702.12" dur="3.9">the deep state&amp;#39;s own symbology back</text>
  <text start="1704.28" dur="4.32">against them you see follow the why</text>

  <text start="1708.6" dur="3.449">Looking Glass there they&amp;#39;re sending a</text>
  <text start="1710.49" dur="5.55">message right to the deep state with</text>
  <text start="1712.049" dur="6.601">those things and totally I mean looking</text>
  <text start="1716.04" dur="7.889">using project Looking Glass future</text>
  <text start="1718.65" dur="7.409">proves pass they can you know use these</text>
  <text start="1723.929" dur="5.011">technologies to see what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
