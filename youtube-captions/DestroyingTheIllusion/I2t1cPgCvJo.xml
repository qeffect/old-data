  <text start="24.96" dur="4.409">wanted to share some new stories that</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="4.321">have come my way for you guys first of</text>
  <text start="29.369" dur="4.56">all let&amp;#39;s talk about all of the fallout</text>
  <text start="31.44" dur="5.7">from those protests that occurred in</text>
  <text start="33.929" dur="6.72">Virginia a few days ago first thing I</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="6.21">have written up here is all the CEOs</text>
  <text start="40.649" dur="6.99">that are basically quitting the Trump</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="7.02">administration so Donald Trump had what</text>
  <text start="47.639" dur="4.29">he called a manufacturing council it was</text>
  <text start="50.37" dur="4.349">an advisory board of a bunch of</text>
  <text start="51.929" dur="6.48">different corporate CEOs to help him</text>
  <text start="54.719" dur="4.26">with his economical decisions and</text>
  <text start="58.409" dur="2.43">whatnot</text>
  <text start="58.979" dur="4.801">well a bunch of those CEOs on that</text>
  <text start="60.839" dur="6.06">council quit the CEO of Merck quit the</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="5.61">CEO of Intel quit and a lot of other</text>
  <text start="66.899" dur="6.33">CEOs had some pretty negative things to</text>
  <text start="69.39" dur="8.159">say simply because Donald Trump didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="6.301">instantly respond and decry the white</text>
  <text start="77.549" dur="5.041">nationalists and the Nazis in yada yada</text>
  <text start="79.53" dur="4.979">yada error as per you know CNN says so</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="5.76">and you know what I have to say about</text>
  <text start="84.509" dur="6.18">that good right screw Merck that company</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="4.769">making all the toxic vaccines being</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="4.621">injected into humans and screw goldman</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="5.011">sachs right because the goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="5.96">CEO Lloyd blanked fine was another one</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="7.07">of those that criticize Donald Trump so</text>
  <text start="101.27" dur="6.459">don&amp;#39;t even worry about that next we have</text>
  <text start="105.2" dur="5.379">this interesting news story that I just</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="6.361">found today and it says federal</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="6.75">prosecutors pursue information on Trump</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="5.879">opponents and this is interesting and</text>
  <text start="117.329" dur="7.021">I&amp;#39;m curious as to see where this will</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="6.51">lead to because what this says here in</text>
  <text start="124.35" dur="3.93">this article by CNN a web hosting</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="3.931">provider is fighting back against a</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="3.5">search warrant that it claims would</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="3.67">require them to turn</text>
  <text start="131.78" dur="6.48">or information on visitors to a website</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="8.89">used to organize protests against Donald</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="7.86">Trump right well here&amp;#39;s the thing a lot</text>
  <text start="142.97" dur="4.62">of those protest organizers especially</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="2.67">the ones that are anti Trump that have</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="3.95">gone on you know</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="5.79">since his inauguration essentially it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="5.44">most likely the case that a lot of those</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="6.12">organizers are funded by corporations</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="5.04">and or people George Soros that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="3.27">want to be names they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="162.02" dur="3.93">exposed so that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m curious as to</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="4.44">see where this might go right the</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="4.38">federal prosecutors are digging up</text>
  <text start="168.41" dur="4.98">information on who the heck is funding</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="6.36">all of these like an Tifa organizations</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="5.64">and protests and and whatnot so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="7.68">keep our eye on that and another news</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="7.59">story also I found this one on CNN MSM</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="3.51">so the mainstream media and this is the</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="3.81">title this is the art club it right</text>
  <text start="187.88" dur="6.14">white nationalists are planning nine</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="6.39">rallies nationwide this weekend alone</text>
  <text start="194.02" dur="4.84">interesting when you skim a little bit</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="4.41">more of this article you know it</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="4.77">discusses how the largest scheduled</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="5.34">rally is called the march on Google</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="7.38">which will take place in nine cities and</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="6.9">the aim of the protest is to basically</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="7.62">speak their voice about the firing of</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="7.53">the Google employee James d&amp;#39;amour over</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="4.98">that controversial memo so this really</text>
  <text start="221" dur="4.14">has nothing to do these protests have</text>
  <text start="223.61" dur="3.51">nothing to do with white nationalists</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="5.45">with Nazis or the all right or whatever</text>
  <text start="227.12" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s just basically anti Google protests</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="6.55">so you know the corporate media has to</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="6.839">label basically any protest that comes</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="7.2">up that&amp;#39;s not anti Trump as being white</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="5.011">nationalist right if it&amp;#39;s an anti</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="5.58">especially anti Google right Google&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="6.42">not only cracking down on youtubers and</text>
  <text start="249.92" dur="4.98">alternative media but now since there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.95" dur="4.379">protests against them they have to crack</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="4.649">down on those protests shoot if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.329" dur="3.78">protesting your Nazi right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="5.361">basically what the logic is coming out</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="3.801">of the mainstream media these days so</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="5.16">anyway if you&amp;#39;re in any of those nine</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="6.15">cities be careful there could very well</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="5.97">be paid provocateurs and a lot of</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.4">violence purposely incited in the crowds</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="5.28">there so anyway you know I&amp;#39;m all for</text>
  <text start="278.27" dur="5.1">protesting Google but ah be careful if</text>
  <text start="281.69" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re at one of those places and then</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="4.92">let&amp;#39;s talk about some tweets that Donald</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="5.34">Trump&amp;#39;s set out so there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="288.29" dur="5.73">pretty funny ones so Donald Trump put</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="5.79">out a picture of basically a train the</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="5.399">Trump train and it was running over a</text>
  <text start="296.6" dur="5.64">person that had a CNN emblem in front of</text>
  <text start="299.419" dur="4.741">our face and you know this picture it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.24" dur="5.79">basically just Trump train running over</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="7.38">CNN but then of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="308.03" dur="5.639">media they have a show and they</text>
  <text start="311.54" dur="5.01">basically say Oh Donald Trump post a</text>
