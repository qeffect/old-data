  <text start="10.94" dur="4.69">before we get into all of the news for</text>
  <text start="13.38" dur="4.05">the day if you have any questions that</text>
  <text start="15.63" dur="4.819">you want to send my way about anything</text>
  <text start="17.43" dur="5.82">in regards to health or conspiracies or</text>
  <text start="20.449" dur="5.021">just personal questions that you might</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="4.56">want an extra perspective on go ahead</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="4.44">and shoot in my way via youtube message</text>
  <text start="27.81" dur="4.02">and I&amp;#39;ll scroll through and I&amp;#39;ll do some</text>
  <text start="29.91" dur="4.919">more of those Q&amp;amp;A videos for you guys</text>
  <text start="31.83" dur="5.49">cuz they&amp;#39;re a lot more off-the-cuff a</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="3.721">lot more low-key and I get to talk to</text>
  <text start="37.32" dur="4.29">you guys a little bit more doing that</text>
  <text start="38.55" dur="4.65">not just all of these news videos it can</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="3.84">kind of get time-consuming and whatnot</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="4.5">so shoot my way I&amp;#39;ll make some more</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="5.25">videos for you guys about your questions</text>
  <text start="47.7" dur="5.1">anyway in regards to this we have a lot</text>
  <text start="50.7" dur="4.05">of stuff going on first of course we</text>
  <text start="52.8" dur="4.47">have the g20 summit that&amp;#39;s ending over</text>
  <text start="54.75" dur="6.6">in Germany Trump and Putin met for the</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="5.4">first time and they took what probably</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="3.51">is going to be the most analyzed</text>
  <text start="62.67" dur="4.98">photograph ever of their handshake but</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="5.34">all seems to be well from their meeting</text>
  <text start="67.65" dur="4.44">it went far longer than they originally</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="3.81">planned I think the original clan just</text>
  <text start="72.09" dur="4.47">like 20 or 30 minutes ended up going for</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="6.3">a couple of hours and it seems to go</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="6.3">pretty well so we had a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="80.31" dur="5.25">agreement reached between Russia and the</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="8.52">United States in Syria this is effective</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="9.059">today and then we also had I mean a lot</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="5.699">of stuff again kind of what I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="4.561">for the past couple months on this</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="5.311">channel is that I think Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="4.74">are working together a lot more closely</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.71">behind the scenes than they can lead us</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="5.489">to believe on the public surface so the</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="4.409">ceasefire agreement in Syria is a good</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="4.371">thing I believe there was also some talk</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="5.04">about like the Russia meddling thing but</text>
  <text start="113.78" dur="4.6">there wasn&amp;#39;t too much tension between</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="3.451">the meeting and there wasn&amp;#39;t too much</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="3.809">buddy-buddy camaraderie between the</text>
  <text start="120" dur="4.77">meetings so I think they both had to put</text>
  <text start="122.189" dur="5.43">essentially their poker faces on for</text>
  <text start="124.77" dur="5.549">this meeting so keep that in mind but</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="5.491">this was the big story of the day</text>
  <text start="130.319" dur="3.28">yesterday in my eyes and that was Donald</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="4.45">Trump</text>
  <text start="133.599" dur="5.911">tweeting about John Podesta and what he</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="3.75">had said what this trip tweet says is</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="5.129">that everybody here is talking about why</text>
  <text start="141.31" dur="5.12">John Podesta refused to give the DNC</text>
  <text start="144.639" dur="5.21">server to the FBI and the CIA</text>
  <text start="146.43" dur="6.639">disgraceful Donald Trump tweeted that</text>
  <text start="149.849" dur="5.14">yesterday morning and let&amp;#39;s be real I</text>
  <text start="153.069" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t think everybody at the g20 summit</text>
  <text start="154.989" dur="4.741">is talking about John Podesta maybe they</text>
  <text start="157.599" dur="4.56">are maybe they&amp;#39;re not I don&amp;#39;t think so</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="4.5">but the fact that Donald Trump would</text>
  <text start="162.159" dur="5.58">tweet this and would tweet specifically</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="6.239">about John Podesta yesterday is crucial</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="5.821">and especially on the day big a cult</text>
  <text start="170.469" dur="4.74">significant date for the write the new</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="4.769">world order or the deep Staters whatever</text>
  <text start="175.209" dur="7.59">you want to call them and who is the one</text>
  <text start="178.329" dur="6.451">person that could really get behind bars</text>
  <text start="182.799" dur="3.75">and lead to the downfall of Audley all</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="5.7">their dominoes in the deep state that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.549" dur="6.481">John Podesta so I&amp;#39;m sure that he is</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="4.709">probably his diapers right now</text>
  <text start="193.03" dur="5.19">thinking that his time is getting very</text>
  <text start="195.189" dur="5.33">narrow and he even tweeted to Donald</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="5.37">Trump back called him hey whack job and</text>
  <text start="200.519" dur="4.21">pulled over apparently he pulled over to</text>
  <text start="203.59" dur="2.519">the side of the road he was taken like</text>
  <text start="204.729" dur="3.241">some kind of road trip yesterday when</text>
  <text start="206.109" dur="3.9">Donald Trump tweeted about him pulled</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="4.32">over the side of the road and wrote a</text>
  <text start="210.009" dur="5.13">quick op-ed for the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="5.369">about this whole situation because of</text>
  <text start="215.139" dur="4.41">course he&amp;#39;s running scared and he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="217.659" dur="6.871">a lot of covering of his ass to do and</text>
  <text start="219.549" dur="8.25">the Washington Post being one of the CIA</text>
  <text start="224.53" dur="6.03">corporate rag outlets premier remember</text>
  <text start="227.799" dur="6.451">because Amazon bought the Washington</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="6.569">Post back in 2013 was 600 million CIA</text>
  <text start="234.25" dur="4.62">dollars and then they recently hired</text>
  <text start="237.129" dur="4.021">John Podesta after the whole pizza gate</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="5.22">scandal so they&amp;#39;re really trying to</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="4.859">clamp down bring things tight and of</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="3.479">course cover their ass because they know</text>
  <text start="246.009" dur="4.44">that their times ending so that was big</text>
  <text start="247.569" dur="6.06">news we&amp;#39;ll see what more happens from</text>
  <text start="250.449" dur="5.04">that and then lastly here North Korea</text>
  <text start="253.629" dur="4.23">continues their provocations so a couple</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="5.161">of days ago they fired off this giant</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="4.86">what was called a brand-new missile so</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="4.86">in response to that the United States</text>
  <text start="262.719" dur="3.761">sent two b1 bombers very close to their</text>
  <text start="265.51" dur="3.19">borders</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="6.39">and they took off from Guam flew real</text>
  <text start="268.7" dur="6.81">close to North Korea to basically send a</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.58">message to them so again in regards to</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="7.23">North Korea I think this is a deep state</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="9.3">proxy country proxy army proxy faction</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="6.75">that they&amp;#39;re using to try to create war</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="2.97">in any which way they can they know I</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="2.61">mean the deep state knows they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="3.96">gonna get war between Russia and the US</text>
  <text start="292.1" dur="4.59">now they&amp;#39;re trying with North Korea they</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="3.84">can&amp;#39;t really try with Isis quite as much</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="4.32">anymore even though they&amp;#39;re trying but</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="6.27">Isis is really getting backed into a</text>
  <text start="301.01" dur="6.21">corner so this is you know one of their</text>
  <text start="304.79" dur="5.1">last little cars that I&amp;#39;m trying to play</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="3.72">but it&amp;#39;s not working so anyway in</text>
  <text start="309.89" dur="4.77">regards to everything going on around</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="5.55">the g20 in the last few days good stuff</text>
  <text start="314.66" dur="3.75">there lots of good stuff especially this</text>
  <text start="316.49" dur="3.75">right here so let&amp;#39;s hope that that guy</text>
  <text start="318.41" dur="5.09">ends up behind bars real soon and then</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="6.06">in regards to the air force space core</text>
  <text start="323.5" dur="6.73">this is interesting remember I reported</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="6.78">on this just a few days ago but a I saw</text>
  <text start="330.23" dur="4.77">on front page CNN today they said</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="5.12">Congress and the air force are in a</text>
  <text start="335" dur="6.27">space war so apparently some people</text>
  <text start="338.2" dur="6.97">primarily in the air force are not happy</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="5.85">that this new essentially branch of the</text>
  <text start="345.17" dur="6.36">military is getting created remember the</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="7.56">Marine Corps was created out of the Navy</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="4.8">and the space Corps is getting</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="4.2">essentially getting created out of the</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="5.31">Air Force now the Air Force and even the</text>
  <text start="358.88" dur="6.27">administrator of NASA is not happy about</text>
  <text start="361.64" dur="6.5">this well why would they not be happy</text>
  <text start="365.15" dur="6.39">about it of course there&amp;#39;s all of their</text>
  <text start="368.14" dur="6.49">superficial or kind of lame reasons as</text>
  <text start="371.54" dur="4.82">to more bureaucracy yadda yadda but what</text>
  <text start="374.63" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;m seeing here is that the Air Force</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="6.46">doesn&amp;#39;t want their secret toys to get</text>
  <text start="379.25" dur="6.33">exposed remember we&amp;#39;ve got a supposed</text>
  <text start="382.82" dur="5.01">disclosure of a lot of stuff going on</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="4.89">and in regards to that Air Force the Air</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="6.66">Force has always been that front</text>
  <text start="390.47" dur="6.15">organization to hide the essentially the</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="4.35">secret space program with they came out</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="3.269">with their Project Blue Book nonsense in</text>
  <text start="398.84" dur="3.27">the 50s and call</text>
  <text start="399.889" dur="4.11">all UFO sightings swamp gas or weather</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="6.739">balloons so the Air Force has always</text>
  <text start="403.999" dur="7.5">been used to lie to the public now</text>
  <text start="408.849" dur="4.18">what&amp;#39;s going on is that the airport I</text>
  <text start="411.499" dur="3.991">mean it looks like with this new space</text>
  <text start="413.029" dur="4.591">course space core being created and this</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="4.639">new National Space Council also being</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="5.4">created is that we are being set up for</text>
  <text start="420.129" dur="4">potential disclosures to occur and I</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="2.25">don&amp;#39;t think the Air Force very happy</text>
  <text start="424.129" dur="5.91">about that so they&amp;#39;re complaining about</text>
  <text start="425.27" dur="6.54">this but you know from here we will see</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="3.75">what comes of all this and then Mike</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="3.9">Pence you know what was really</text>
  <text start="433.789" dur="3.69">interesting to me yesterday that seemed</text>
  <text start="435.71" dur="3.72">pretty small but I think there might be</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="2.55">a hidden message behind that is that he</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="4.38">ignored</text>
  <text start="440.029" dur="5.61">NASA&amp;#39;s do not touch sign right and it</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="3.87">was actually photographed touching the</text>
  <text start="445.639" dur="4.441">equipment now this could have just been</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="5.009">some joke like he kind of played it off</text>
  <text start="450.08" dur="5.73">his being he blamed it on Marco Rubio</text>
  <text start="452.689" dur="6.241">who said that it was a dare for him to</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="7.68">touch the equipment who knows but again</text>
  <text start="458.93" dur="6.57">at this level and when you you know look</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="5.389">at the world events and people at this</text>
  <text start="465.5" dur="7.62">high of power everything is scripted</text>
  <text start="468.879" dur="6.28">everything is very specifically done so</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="3.9">for him to touch the equipment maybe</text>
  <text start="475.159" dur="5.1">this was a time a kind of hidden message</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="5.72">to NASA when it said do not touch right</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="6.301">maybe this whole Air Force and NASA</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="5.979">secret space program is a do not touch</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="4.62">area and I mean it has been for 80 years</text>
  <text start="488.719" dur="4.741">and now mike pence who is head of the</text>
  <text start="491.18" dur="4.919">national space council of all things is</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="4.979">touching right interesting interesting</text>
  <text start="496.099" dur="7.31">little double entendre there so maybe</text>
  <text start="498.439" dur="8.581">certain factions of an alliance are</text>
  <text start="503.409" dur="6">going into territory that was never</text>
  <text start="507.02" dur="4.67">touched in the public domain before</text>
  <text start="509.409" dur="4.841">speculate on that anyway</text>
  <text start="511.69" dur="4.3">into antarctica here a few things that</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="4.19">have gone on there the past few days on</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="4.709">the 4th of July there was another</text>
  <text start="518.44" dur="5.409">energetic anomaly that took place there</text>
  <text start="520.699" dur="5.491">and it was in the same area as the</text>
  <text start="523.849" dur="4.891">previous ones have remember I think one</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="4.889">occurred in April I think another one</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="4.709">occurred in late May or early June but</text>
  <text start="531.079" dur="2.881">there&amp;#39;s these weird energetic anomalies</text>
  <text start="533.449" dur="2.821">that have been</text>
  <text start="533.96" dur="4.1">emanating from Antarctica right below</text>
  <text start="536.27" dur="5.49">South America</text>
  <text start="538.06" dur="5.98">this one was another one seems to occur</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="3.57">and then one of the very same regions</text>
  <text start="544.04" dur="3.24">there but this one was a little</text>
  <text start="545.33" dur="3.54">different it wasn&amp;#39;t kind of the wave</text>
  <text start="547.28" dur="3.99">pattern would look like the microwave</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="5.37">patterns from the last couple this one</text>
  <text start="551.27" dur="6.03">seemed to flow with the weather patterns</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="6.18">so it was a little different but much of</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="6.47">the same so again who knows what this is</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="6.27">pointing towards weather is evidence of</text>
  <text start="563.77" dur="5.76">the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic poles shifting</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="6.3">maybe maybe it is evidence of a</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="5.98">behind-the-scenes space war going on who</text>
  <text start="572.99" dur="6.12">knows but that was very interesting and</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="6.78">I&amp;#39;ll post a link to a video by da boo</text>
  <text start="579.11" dur="5.37">which I saw him cover this in so go</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="4.02">check that out it&amp;#39;s a how it looks is</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="3.48">really interesting it pops up and then</text>
  <text start="586.31" dur="3.33">it just kind of shifts away in the</text>
  <text start="587.96" dur="3.87">weather patterns so check it out and</text>
  <text start="589.64" dur="5.43">then it was also really interesting is</text>
  <text start="591.83" dur="5.7">that the cover of July of this month&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.07" dur="6.51">edition of National Geographic is going</text>
  <text start="597.53" dur="5.43">to feature Antarctica hmm we know</text>
  <text start="601.58" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="602.96" dur="6.66">told you know the public is not told</text>
  <text start="606.83" dur="6.24">about Antarctica secret bases being down</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="6.12">there possibly ancient ruins being</text>
  <text start="613.07" dur="5.16">hidden under the ice lots of stuff that</text>
  <text start="615.74" dur="6.12">has gone on in Antarctica that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="618.23" dur="6.39">told about and we&amp;#39;re also told that some</text>
  <text start="621.86" dur="4.89">of the first disclosures about you know</text>
  <text start="624.62" dur="4.14">the secret space programs and the</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="4.2">various truce would have gone on on this</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="3.81">planet for thousands of millions and</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="3.48">billions of years could involve</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="5.46">Antarctica the very first disclosures</text>
  <text start="634.43" dur="5.46">for so for them to put the cover of the</text>
  <text start="638.03" dur="5.03">July edition of National Geographic as</text>
  <text start="639.89" dur="5.85">Antarctica could be that they are</text>
  <text start="643.06" dur="4.48">continuously prepping our consciousness</text>
  <text start="645.74" dur="3.96">for these disclosures and what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="647.54" dur="4.11">interesting is that this story that they</text>
  <text start="649.7" dur="4.38">put in national dragged out Geographic</text>
  <text start="651.65" dur="5.73">was about divers diving under the ice</text>
  <text start="654.08" dur="7.29">now of course they didn&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="5.19">expose any of the secret Nazi bases that</text>
  <text start="661.37" dur="4.71">we know have been down there or anything</text>
  <text start="662.57" dur="4.63">else but again just really interesting</text>
  <text start="666.08" dur="3.1">that they would</text>
  <text start="667.2" dur="4.1">use this story to be on the cover of</text>
  <text start="669.18" dur="5.04">this month&amp;#39;s National Geographic</text>
  <text start="671.3" dur="5.74">especially in regards to all the other</text>
  <text start="674.22" dur="5.91">disclosures that are potentially being</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="4.14">lined up to occur so there&amp;#39;s that and</text>
  <text start="680.13" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re guys saying doctor cut and then</text>
  <text start="681.18" dur="4.62">the last couple things down here on just</text>
  <text start="683.37" dur="3.57">GMOs vaccines two very important topics</text>
  <text start="685.8" dur="3.54">for all of us to become familiar</text>
  <text start="686.94" dur="7.2">familiar with educate our friends and</text>
  <text start="689.34" dur="7.38">family about because we can then these</text>
  <text start="694.14" dur="6.42">topics then pave the way for a lot of</text>
  <text start="696.72" dur="6.84">the other seemingly crazier stuff to be</text>
  <text start="700.56" dur="5.22">discussed so you know every every single</text>
  <text start="703.56" dur="4.38">thing is connected every single little</text>
  <text start="705.78" dur="4.8">thing matters in the long run so these</text>
  <text start="707.94" dur="4.83">two topics still very important GMOs in</text>
  <text start="710.58" dur="5.4">vaccines in regards to GMO GMOs</text>
  <text start="712.77" dur="6.69">California officially labeled glyphosate</text>
  <text start="715.98" dur="5.49">as a cancer-causing ingredient so</text>
  <text start="719.46" dur="4.98">Monsanto is obviously not happy about</text>
  <text start="721.47" dur="6.78">that but the main because glyphosate is</text>
  <text start="724.44" dur="4.71">Monsanto&amp;#39;s main ingredient in their</text>
  <text start="728.25" dur="3.21">roundup</text>
  <text start="729.15" dur="6.3">product and their roundup product is the</text>
  <text start="731.46" dur="6.84">you know primary product that sprayed on</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="6.21">pretty much all the GMOs the GMOs like</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="4.86">soy and corn are created to be what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="741.66" dur="3.71">called Roundup Ready because they can</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="6.27">have as much roundup sprayed on them as</text>
  <text start="745.37" dur="5.5">basically possible and in California</text>
  <text start="749.43" dur="2.97">that ingredient is now officially</text>
  <text start="750.87" dur="2.94">labeled as cancer-causing we&amp;#39;ve all</text>
  <text start="752.4" dur="5.49">known that but the fact that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="753.81" dur="6.87">officially labeled by a government cool</text>
  <text start="757.89" dur="7.02">thing it&amp;#39;s a very cool thing and next in</text>
  <text start="760.68" dur="7.68">regards to vaccines Italy made news last</text>

  <text start="787.44" dur="4.5">gone so the job&amp;#39;s not done but because</text>
  <text start="790.05" dur="3.99">of these protests it does seem that the</text>
  <text start="791.94" dur="3.75">government Italy has eased up on the law</text>
  <text start="794.04" dur="4.53">not as many of the vaccines are</text>
  <text start="795.69" dur="5.22">mandatory and there&amp;#39;s less essentially</text>
  <text start="798.57" dur="4.62">punishment for those that choose</text>
  <text start="800.91" dur="5.37">not to get vaccinated but again that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="803.19" dur="5.64">not enough we need vaccines done for and</text>
