  <text start="73.049" dur="6.271">really get into it I mean this is the</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="6.449">dude his name is Daniel lists and he</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="4.11">goes by the moniker of the dark</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="6.061">journalists now what essentially</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="6.21">happened is that a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="87" dur="5.7">I mentioned in a video that I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="5.519">a part of a new book series between a</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.98">few different contributors and Corey</text>
  <text start="95.159" dur="4.651">Goode now Corey Goode is a man who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="3.6">been another target of that</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="4.019">disinformation campaign that I was</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="5.19">talking about and it&amp;#39;s hitting him very</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="4.86">freaking hard but because I&amp;#39;m on this</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="4.35">book project and he also happens to be</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="4.411">on this book project there&amp;#39;s been some</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="4.17">guilt by association there and then the</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="5.97">hit pieces have also been coming my way</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="6.479">and he made one of them now what did he</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="3.659">say about me he said this in a video he</text>
  <text start="121.469" dur="2.79">released about four days ago on his</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="3.861">YouTube channel his dark journalist</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="4.711">YouTube channel and he essentially said</text>
  <text start="126.59" dur="4.54">in the middle of this video I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="4.92">paraphrasing here but he said I was like</text>
  <text start="131.13" dur="4.71">this random kid that&amp;#39;s into healthy</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="5.27">supplements that&amp;#39;s being basically mind</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="5.46">controlled by Cory good to co-opt</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="3.79">legitimate so your space program</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="6.03">research and dupe the millennial</text>
  <text start="142.95" dur="6.15">generation so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s claimed that</text>
  <text start="147.33" dur="3.27">I am and it&amp;#39;s I mean I even saw some</text>
  <text start="149.1" dur="3.24">comments below and some people were like</text>
  <text start="150.6" dur="2.04">is this guy a CIA asset or something</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="3.96">like that</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="5.4">yeah I&amp;#39;m totally CIA but anyway what am</text>
  <text start="156.3" dur="3.75">gonna how am I gonna discuss this well</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m actually gonna gonna read the script</text>
  <text start="160.05" dur="3.09">of his frickin video and talk to you</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="4.2">guys about it</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="6.9">so essentially what he said word for</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="5.31">word and I quote at contact in the</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="4.17">desert Corey Goode announced part of a</text>
  <text start="171.99" dur="5.19">new secret space program book when I</text>
  <text start="174.21" dur="5.85">looked at who the co-author was I saw</text>
  <text start="177.18" dur="5.4">surprising named Jordans safer a new</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="3.87">Corey&amp;#39;s kid so I&amp;#39;m gonna stop right</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="3.21">there before I get into the next part</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="3.96">and kind of discussed that what was</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="6.38">really interesting in his video is that</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="7.56">he singled me out as being a co-author</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="4.36">but you know if you&amp;#39;ve watched my video</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="2.58">I just released on that secret space</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="3.03">program book there&amp;#39;s four different</text>
  <text start="198.03" dur="3.24">names involved there&amp;#39;s doctor Bob wood</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s dr. Michael Sala Bill Tompkins</text>
  <text start="201.27" dur="4.41">and Corey Goode are all in on it so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.3" dur="3.84">funny enough that he didn&amp;#39;t mention</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="5.16">those names but he just wanted to single</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="7.44">me out and then call me this new Cory&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.84" dur="6.3">kid which is a very convenient meme that</text>
  <text start="215.58" dur="3.36">this disinformation campaign is</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="3.6">beginning to use and they&amp;#39;re essentially</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="3.21">calling all of the younger generation</text>
  <text start="220.74" dur="3.99">apparently they think I&amp;#39;m like twelve or</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="3.84">something and calling me a Corey&amp;#39;s kid</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s just a blatant character</text>
  <text start="225.99" dur="4.44">assassination attack blatant ad hominem</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="4.71">attacks so I mean it&amp;#39;s just like high</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="3.69">school drama class watching them when</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="4.41">their arguments try and play out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="7.62">pretty ridiculous but anyway it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="6.39">interesting that they didn&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="241.74" dur="3.51">that I was working with all those other</text>
  <text start="243.3" dur="3.659">names on his project I mean dr. Bob Wood</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="4.14">is a physicist that went to Cornell and</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="4.261">he worked at Douglas for 34 years yes</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s a reason that he didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="2.46">say those other names is because it</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="3.15">gives a lot of fruit and credence to</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="3.119">this project and also one of the other</text>
  <text start="255.6" dur="2.82">names that was up on that board</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="2.201">mentioned a contact in the desert was</text>
  <text start="258.42" dur="2.08">none other than</text>
  <text start="259" dur="3.75">Linda Moulton Howe who may or may not</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="4.23">work on this project with us and funny</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="3.69">enough the dark journalists interviewed</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="3.39">Linda Moulton Howe before so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="4.44">like two degrees of separation right</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="4.89">there that he didn&amp;#39;t want to say because</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="4.71">he that would destroy his narrative a</text>
  <text start="273.01" dur="4.8">little bit here do you see so I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="275.59" dur="2.55">destroy it didn&amp;#39;t matter anyway moving</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="4.92">on</text>
  <text start="278.14" dur="7.83">he says safer last year had a website</text>
  <text start="282.73" dur="6.75">about taking healthy supplements and I</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="5.34">did actually it was my health coaching</text>
  <text start="289.48" dur="3.9">website but it wasn&amp;#39;t about taking</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="4.88">healthy supplements it was actually</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="5.94">about me building my own business and</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="6.79">then he goes in the next part of his</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="5.73">quote suddenly he me started a YouTube</text>
  <text start="302.98" dur="3.75">channel a few months back so this would</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="3.03">actually happened yes I had a website</text>
  <text start="306.73" dur="2.61">about taking out these supplements yes I</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="4.11">started this YouTube channel but I</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="4.74">actually like I said about nine months</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="4.02">ago started my health coaching website</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="4.2">and I wanted to start a health coaching</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.56">like YouTube channel along with it right</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="4.98">one of my online mentors who I grew up</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="4.44">really admiring was a man by the name of</text>
  <text start="323.26" dur="4.59">Elliott Hulse who basically built his</text>
  <text start="325.21" dur="4.32">own worldwide brand with a youtube</text>
  <text start="327.85" dur="3.15">channel that was based out of his like</text>
  <text start="329.53" dur="3.389">garage gym and I thought it was badass</text>
  <text start="331" dur="5.729">I&amp;#39;m like I want to do that with holistic</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="8.551">health but that never really panned out</text>
  <text start="336.729" dur="7.021">and my inner my inner drive and my inner</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="4.86">desires was really to expose as much</text>
  <text start="343.75" dur="4.41">freaking truth as I could now health is</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="3.99">a big part of that of course there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="5.4">lot of you know conspiratorial stuff</text>
  <text start="350.32" dur="5.52">around medicine and whatnot but I just</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="3.93">had this deeper drive to get all like</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="2.99">the secret space program information out</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="3.84">there and everything in that regard so</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="4.149">that&amp;#39;s why I started this YouTube</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="3.3">channel destroying the illusion and that</text>
  <text start="362.979" dur="4.471">was about four months ago</text>
  <text start="364.63" dur="4.14">one day I&amp;#39;m just like screw it I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="367.45" dur="3.27">gonna do this health stuff anymore I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="368.77" dur="3.93">gonna be this I&amp;#39;m gonna try to do the</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="3.509">whole independent journalism thing and</text>
  <text start="372.7" dur="3.029">just make some freakin videos because I</text>
  <text start="374.229" dur="3.451">thought that was a great niche that</text>
  <text start="375.729" dur="4.411">needed to be filled and I&amp;#39;m filling it</text>
  <text start="377.68" dur="5.67">I&amp;#39;m doing a pretty good job doing it so</text>
  <text start="380.14" dur="5.16">yeah weird thing is he&amp;#39;s trying to miss</text>
  <text start="383.35" dur="4.439">inform people about and then he goes on</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="6.66">to say on my youtube channel I take</text>
  <text start="387.789" dur="6.75">pains to defend David Wilcock Corey good</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="5.07">with a cult-like sentiment and no</text>
  <text start="394.539" dur="4.321">journalistic merit so that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="4.8">three things we&amp;#39;re gonna roll into one</text>
  <text start="398.86" dur="4.95">response one refutation with that I</text>
  <text start="401.83" dur="3.75">didn&amp;#39;t really take pains to defend David</text>
  <text start="403.81" dur="3.12">Wilcock and Corey Goode all I was</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="4.53">essentially saying is they&amp;#39;re human</text>
  <text start="406.93" dur="4.739">beings so not only do the haters and the</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="3.179">people with judging with very narrow</text>
  <text start="411.669" dur="4.291">perspectives have to realize that</text>
  <text start="413.289" dur="3.481">they&amp;#39;re human but all of the people with</text>
  <text start="415.96" dur="2.79">that cult-like</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="4.679">attitude have to realize that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="5.97">human as well and to not hang on every</text>
  <text start="421.449" dur="5.041">word that they give okay because I mean</text>
  <text start="424.72" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s trying to call me out for being</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="4.769">this like millennial cult leader if you</text>
  <text start="429.22" dur="3.509">take longer than a minute to watch my</text>
  <text start="431.259" dur="3.571">youtube videos you can tell that what I</text>
  <text start="432.729" dur="4.381">try and do is offer information I just</text>
  <text start="434.83" dur="3.899">try to show the way these videos are</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="3.33">really really to help people empower</text>
  <text start="438.729" dur="4.771">themselves with information and</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="4.56">increasing their consciousness so yeah I</text>
  <text start="443.5" dur="3.75">have no idea where he&amp;#39;s getting that</text>
  <text start="445" dur="5.97">cult-like sentiment thing from and when</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="5.18">he says no journalistic merit that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.97" dur="4.259">really interesting as well because</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="5.95">primary point in case here the reason my</text>
  <text start="455.229" dur="6.331">youtube channel has grown at the rapid</text>
  <text start="458.38" dur="4.89">rate it has is because people enjoy the</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="4.74">journalistic integrity I have with these</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="6.78">videos I link my sources down below I</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="5.76">give objective perspectives as to what</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="4.679">is going on and I connect all the dots</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="4.41">with my fancy little whiteboard here so</text>
  <text start="474.729" dur="6.511">the no journalistic merit thing is</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="6.15">pretty BS and if you also know me or Who</text>
  <text start="481.24" dur="3.66">I am at all which of course he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="482.62" dur="4.35">want to put in his videos I have had</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="4.049">pretty much every major alternative</text>
  <text start="486.97" dur="4.229">media outlet asking me to work with them</text>
  <text start="488.949" dur="4.741">from you know I&amp;#39;ve actually written</text>
  <text start="491.199" dur="4.261">articles for the waking times Collective</text>
  <text start="493.69" dur="3.21">evolution mind unleash spirit science</text>
  <text start="495.46" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;ve all reached out to me wanting me</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="3.329">to work with them and wanting to work</text>
  <text start="499.479" dur="3.69">with me</text>
  <text start="500.229" dur="5.43">so saying I have no journalist merit is</text>
  <text start="503.169" dur="4.831">pretty ridiculous and we&amp;#39;re gonna get to</text>
  <text start="505.659" dur="6.93">your journalistic merit here in a minute</text>
  <text start="508" dur="5.909">mr. Daniel lists so that&amp;#39;s you know a</text>
  <text start="512.589" dur="3.45">lot of interesting stuff he would go and</text>
  <text start="513.909" dur="4.05">say but a lot of stuff that&amp;#39;s blatant</text>
  <text start="516.039" dur="4.471">misinformation and when people are</text>
  <text start="517.959" dur="3.781">watching his video with an unaware</text>
  <text start="520.51" dur="3.69">perspective they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="5.91">necessarily know so this distant</text>
  <text start="524.2" dur="5.04">campaign is blatant and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="527.65" dur="4.74">might not see that but I see it</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="4.98">especially because it&amp;#39;s against me and I</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="4.44">will just say this</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="5.45">Cory&amp;#39;s Cory&amp;#39;s kids aren&amp;#39;t Cubs and these</text>
  <text start="536.83" dur="5.07">are bears you don&amp;#39;t want to poke so</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="4.54">that&amp;#39;s really all I have to say about</text>
  <text start="541.9" dur="4.86">what was said so that&amp;#39;s me focusing on</text>
  <text start="544.21" dur="4.74">the message right and giving you guys a</text>
  <text start="546.76" dur="3.99">little more background into how this</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="3.51">YouTube video formed and what I used to</text>
  <text start="550.75" dur="3.63">do and what I do to support my support</text>

  <text start="611.77" dur="7.02">things with this with his brand with his</text>
  <text start="615.01" dur="6.42">dark journalist brand which no though</text>
  <text start="618.79" dur="4.23">first before we get into this I came</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="3.15">across his YouTube channel the dark</text>
  <text start="623.02" dur="3.12">journalist like three or four months ago</text>
  <text start="624.58" dur="2.79">pretty much when I first started my</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="3.6">youtube channel and I thought it was</text>
  <text start="627.37" dur="4.62">badass I&amp;#39;m like dude his brand is sick</text>
  <text start="629.74" dur="4.23">and what was interesting is that I saw</text>
  <text start="631.99" dur="4.14">all the names of the people that he</text>
  <text start="633.97" dur="4.11">interviewed people like Katherine Austin</text>
  <text start="636.13" dur="3.33">Fitz Linda Moulton Howe he even had an</text>
  <text start="638.08" dur="3.3">interview with Graham Hancock on here</text>
  <text start="639.46" dur="4.14">and I was like damn this dude&amp;#39;s legit</text>
  <text start="641.38" dur="3.78">and I was I followed him on Twitter I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="643.6" dur="3.69">like okay right and I was I was actually</text>
  <text start="645.16" dur="4.86">kind of admiring the guy from what I</text>
  <text start="647.29" dur="5.34">initially saw but then once I saw his</text>
  <text start="650.02" dur="4.23">disinformation campaign against me his</text>
  <text start="652.63" dur="3.08">agenda stuck out like a sore thumb and</text>
  <text start="654.25" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about that so</text>
  <text start="655.71" dur="3.52">what I noticed</text>
  <text start="657.58" dur="5.52">the objective things that I noticed from</text>
  <text start="659.23" dur="7.41">his work is first and foremost he burst</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="5.7">onto the scene in about 2012 2015</text>
  <text start="666.64" dur="6.96">hosting a secret space program</text>
  <text start="668.8" dur="8.19">conference and he even somehow acquired</text>
  <text start="673.6" dur="5.64">the domain name for this conference in</text>
  <text start="676.99" dur="4.83">that secret space program org</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="5.22">which you know I can only imagine as a</text>
  <text start="681.82" dur="5.31">very coveted domain name right now so</text>
  <text start="684.46" dur="5.07">somehow he was able to jump on the spot</text>
  <text start="687.13" dur="5.58">acquire this secret space program or</text>
  <text start="689.53" dur="6.48">domain name and then host to conferences</text>
  <text start="692.71" dur="5.1">actually at 2014 in 2015 one with some</text>
  <text start="696.01" dur="3.06">pretty big names I mean Katherine Watson</text>
  <text start="697.81" dur="3.09">Fitz was there Linda Moulton Howe was</text>
  <text start="699.07" dur="4.35">there I believe Dolan was at one of</text>
  <text start="700.9" dur="4.98">these so he got some big names at his</text>
  <text start="703.42" dur="4.08">conferences right off the bat and then</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="4.05">also on his YouTube channel and on his</text>
  <text start="707.5" dur="3.9">website he was able to get some big name</text>
  <text start="709.93" dur="3.27">YouTube interviews right off the bat</text>
  <text start="711.4" dur="3.72">like I said earlier he had it Boston</text>
  <text start="713.2" dur="4.77">fits on there Moulton Howe Graham</text>
  <text start="715.12" dur="5.46">Hancock Dolan Paul Hellyer like dude</text>
  <text start="717.97" dur="6.69">Stanton Friedman again he&amp;#39;s got a lot of</text>
  <text start="720.58" dur="6.99">big names he&amp;#39;s interviewed so this guy</text>
  <text start="724.66" dur="8.07">is smart right he&amp;#39;s very he&amp;#39;s very apt</text>
  <text start="727.57" dur="7.83">in what he&amp;#39;s doing and he&amp;#39;s got a lot of</text>
  <text start="732.73" dur="4.92">good names on there so where did he come</text>
  <text start="735.4" dur="3.72">from though this is what I want to know</text>
  <text start="737.65" dur="4.53">because you know he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="739.12" dur="4.89">questioning me and I suddenly started a</text>
  <text start="742.18" dur="4.14">YouTube channel but I&amp;#39;m telling you I</text>
  <text start="744.01" dur="4.05">told you exactly how I started it how</text>
  <text start="746.32" dur="3.84">did he start his how did he get all</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="6.18">those big interviews right off the bat</text>
  <text start="750.16" dur="6.06">and host these big conferences and you</text>
  <text start="754.24" dur="3.39">know how did he do it literally I mean</text>
  <text start="756.22" dur="4.26">what does this guy do as a day job</text>
  <text start="757.63" dur="4.11">because three years ago about three or</text>
  <text start="760.48" dur="4.5">four years ago when he first started his</text>
  <text start="761.74" dur="5.85">YouTube he was only uploading like one</text>
  <text start="764.98" dur="4.02">interview a month and that kind of sped</text>
  <text start="767.59" dur="3.66">up a little bit right within the last</text>
  <text start="769" dur="3.57">year it&amp;#39;s been about couple a month and</text>
  <text start="771.25" dur="6.39">was within the past few months it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="772.57" dur="7.76">one a week he&amp;#39;s pumping out and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="777.64" dur="5.07">also very interesting to note is that</text>
  <text start="780.33" dur="5.59">none of what he&amp;#39;s put out has been</text>
  <text start="782.71" dur="5.91">original content okay this is an</text>
  <text start="785.92" dur="4.28">interesting point in that all he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="788.62" dur="4.22">essentially done especially on YouTube</text>
  <text start="790.2" dur="3.69">right now it&amp;#39;s all been interviews</text>
  <text start="792.84" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s really it</text>
  <text start="793.89" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s been no original work which you</text>
  <text start="797.49" dur="7.46">think being a journalist and even on his</text>
  <text start="800.55" dur="7.55">website it claims that he&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="6.16">bring covert information to light on</text>
  <text start="808.1" dur="4.78">major topics like GMOs deep state black</text>
  <text start="811.11" dur="3.84">budget secrecy and all that jazz so what</text>
  <text start="812.88" dur="5.22">I want to know is why does he only do</text>
  <text start="814.95" dur="5.28">interviews but I don&amp;#39;t find any written</text>
  <text start="818.1" dur="4.56">work I don&amp;#39;t find any other videos any</text>
  <text start="820.23" dur="4.5">other content from him trying to expose</text>
  <text start="822.66" dur="6.15">these issues he claims to want to expose</text>
  <text start="824.73" dur="7.95">anywhere else and I mean for instance on</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="6.06">GMOs what has he done on GMOs right I I</text>
  <text start="832.68" dur="4.56">haven&amp;#39;t seen anything I&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="834.87" dur="4.35">right I used to work in grassroots</text>
  <text start="837.24" dur="4.29">campaigns and it was even part of</text>
  <text start="839.22" dur="4.23">creation of a documentary on GMOs right</text>
  <text start="841.53" dur="3.72">I can tell you about the Bt toxin</text>

  <text start="845.25" dur="3.96">ingredient in the store hasn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="4.05">genetically engineered but I don&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="1009.87" dur="4.88">quick before I&amp;#39;m done and what I mean by</text>
  <text start="1012.329" dur="4.32">this is that when you look at how his</text>
  <text start="1014.75" dur="3.759">channel started and how his brand</text>
  <text start="1016.649" dur="4.651">started started right off the bat about</text>
  <text start="1018.509" dur="5.25">three or four years ago so in my mind</text>
  <text start="1021.3" dur="4.05">when I empathized the situation I try to</text>
  <text start="1023.759" dur="3.15">put myself into it like I try to do in</text>
  <text start="1025.35" dur="4.939">every situation I&amp;#39;m sitting here</text>
  <text start="1026.909" dur="7.05">thinking like okay maybe this guy</text>
  <text start="1030.289" dur="5.861">speculative maybe this guy had some</text>

  <text start="1052.14" dur="4.02">conference you can hook yourself up with</text>
  <text start="1055.53" dur="2.91">some inner</text>
  <text start="1056.16" dur="4.14">from some well-meaning people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1058.44" dur="3.54">really know that you&amp;#39;re COINTELPRO and</text>
  <text start="1060.3" dur="3.42">you can get your own brand started you</text>
  <text start="1061.98" dur="3.63">can start building this out just make</text>
  <text start="1063.72" dur="6.27">sure you do one interview a month to</text>
  <text start="1065.61" dur="6.54">keep some organic following rolling in</text>
  <text start="1069.99" dur="3.54">and we&amp;#39;ll see where you can go you know</text>
  <text start="1072.15" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;ll have you do that for a few years</text>
  <text start="1073.53" dur="6.33">and then when we need you right when</text>
  <text start="1076.26" dur="5.43">certain people like myself or other</text>
  <text start="1079.86" dur="3.54">people in the disclosure communities</text>
  <text start="1081.69" dur="3.21">start rising up and building their own</text>
  <text start="1083.4" dur="2.94">brand high enough to where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1084.9" dur="3.75">starting to make a real difference</text>
  <text start="1086.34" dur="4.2">then we&amp;#39;ll activate you mr. dark</text>
  <text start="1088.65" dur="3.09">journalists you&amp;#39;ll be activated and then</text>
  <text start="1090.54" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;ll send you in with your</text>
  <text start="1091.74" dur="4.71">disinformation campaign and then you can</text>
  <text start="1093.48" dur="5.46">begin making your own videos to attack</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="4.74">them with you see this is why all he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1098.94" dur="4.53">ever done his interviews is because he</text>
  <text start="1101.19" dur="5.88">wants to build that organic as much of</text>
  <text start="1103.47" dur="5.7">an organic following as he has and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1107.07" dur="3.81">speculating again here but I can make a</text>
  <text start="1109.17" dur="4.62">very educated guess that many of his</text>
  <text start="1110.88" dur="4.95">followers and subscribers on YouTube are</text>
  <text start="1113.79" dur="3.93">fake accounts and the reason I say this</text>
