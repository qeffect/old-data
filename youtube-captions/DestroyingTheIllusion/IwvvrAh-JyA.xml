  <text start="7.2" dur="4.92">know what they call NASA right never a</text>
  <text start="9.15" dur="5.43">straight answer but imagine a complete</text>
  <text start="12.12" dur="5.01">event secret space program operating</text>
  <text start="14.58" dur="5.64">completely out of the public eye sounds</text>
  <text start="17.13" dur="5.13">crazy doesn&amp;#39;t it does it well let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="20.22" dur="3.87">a look at this objectively we can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="36.809" dur="4.381">simply electricity in the 1920s 30s and</text>
  <text start="39.27" dur="4.469">his research ended up in the hands of</text>
  <text start="41.19" dur="5.22">the military-industrial complex so the</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="5.041">science could surely be there in the</text>

  <text start="69.21" dur="5.01">that it&amp;#39;s not missing so there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="6.78">science and there&amp;#39;s the funding but</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="6.21">could they would they well could they</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="4.201">could they keep something that massive</text>
  <text start="80.43" dur="4.86">that secret and in that regard let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="4.35">look at the Manhattan Project a hundred</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="4.2">thousand people working tirelessly for</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="5.099">years to create the atom bomb and not</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="4.019">one person peaked no one even knew what</text>
  <text start="92.159" dur="3.481">they were really working on until the</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="5.131">moment the bombs went off that is the</text>
  <text start="95.64" dur="5.88">power of compartmentalization and would</text>

  <text start="101.52" dur="4.68">in the shoes of the owners of this</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="4.74">planet so to say you would literally be</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="4.11">Luciferian to your core with a few</text>

  <text start="131.849" dur="3.961">surmise that a highly</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="4.92">advanced secret space program could very</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="3.93">well exist and lastly let&amp;#39;s take a look</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="3.66">at the whistleblowers giving us more</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="4.08">directed evidence of it Phil Schneider</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="4.32">came out and gave interviews involving</text>
  <text start="143.82" dur="5.16">his work with D um BS or deep</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="3.75">underground military bases he even said</text>
  <text start="148.98" dur="4.14">that he worked for the government</text>
  <text start="150.06" dur="4.83">building these and he described alien</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="5.3">technology that was kept and reverse</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="7.92">engineered at these bases Roswell crash</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="6.97">of course he committed suicide in 1994</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="4.41">then we have Gary McKinnon who was</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="4.8">accused of perpetrating the biggest</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="5.19">military hack of all time in 2002 he</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="4.59">actually hacked into NASA computers and</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="4.95">found Excel spreadsheets naming</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="4.44">non-terrestrial officers he also found</text>
  <text start="177.36" dur="3.96">descriptions of ships in a special</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="4.98">access project called solar warden and</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="6.42">evidence of NASA airbrushing UFOs out of</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="4.89">pictures interesting and recently we</text>
  <text start="187.74" dur="3.63">have the likes of Corey Goode and</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="4.35">William Tompkins Corey Goode has come</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="3.63">out telling us of his deep experiences</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="3.69">in this secret space program</text>
  <text start="195" dur="4.47">corroborating the testimony of many</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="3.96">other witnesses and William Tompkins has</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="3.84">given his testimony of designing</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="4.53">spacecraft for black-budget military</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="3.84">programs he even released documents from</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="3.69">one of his old employers Douglass</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="4.05">aerospace company and these documents</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="3.39">were from the 1940s discussing</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="4.02">electrogravitics or anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="5.22">research so they&amp;#39;ve known about it for</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="5.28">decades I invite you to expand your mind</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="4.5">about this topic the research is there</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="3.33">the funding is there and the</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="3.6">whistleblowers have been trying to wake</text>
  <text start="223.83" dur="4.65">us up to it for decades there could very</text>
  <text start="226.02" dur="4.41">well be a secret space program in</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="3.81">existence operating right above our</text>
