  <text start="0.11" dur="3.91">hey guys so in this video here today I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2.85" dur="3.6">gonna talk about something that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4.02" dur="4.77">normally touch on and that&amp;#39;s technology</text>
  <text start="6.45" dur="3.93">more specifically net neutrality and</text>
  <text start="8.79" dur="3.75">internet security and I&amp;#39;m actually going</text>
  <text start="10.38" dur="4.139">to offer you a promotion from a company</text>
  <text start="12.54" dur="4.079">that I recently started working with to</text>
  <text start="14.519" dur="4.411">help you protect yourself online first</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="4.261">let&amp;#39;s discuss net neutrality this is</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="4.109">basically the idea that the Internet</text>
  <text start="20.88" dur="4.77">should be treated as a utility and all</text>
  <text start="23.039" dur="5.191">data on it is equal metaphorically the</text>
  <text start="25.65" dur="4.65">ISPs or Internet service providers of</text>
  <text start="28.23" dur="3.779">the world can manage the pipes but they</text>
  <text start="30.3" dur="3.75">should have no say as to what passes</text>
  <text start="32.009" dur="4.501">through them this is a huge topic right</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="4.65">now as next month on December 14th the</text>
  <text start="36.51" dur="5.04">FCC is going to vote to potentially</text>
  <text start="38.7" dur="5.31">repeal regulations on net neutrality</text>
  <text start="41.55" dur="4.439">allowing the Verizon&amp;#39;s and the Comcast&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="44.01" dur="3.779">of the world to decide who gets heard</text>
  <text start="45.989" dur="4.5">and who doesn&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;d literally be able</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="5.101">to block websites and content of their</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="4.741">choosing and be able to slow data speeds</text>
  <text start="52.89" dur="4.5">at their own discretion legally speaking</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="4.53">of Comcast&amp;#39;s check out this article that</text>
  <text start="57.39" dur="4.349">came out just yesterday on November 29th</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="4.11">it says Comcast deleted its net</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.101">neutrality pledge on the same day the</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="5.85">FCC announced its plan to repeal the</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="5.069">open web and check this out guys it says</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="4.469">here it barely took a day for Comcast to</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="4.831">rid itself of its Albatross of a net</text>
  <text start="74.189" dur="4.29">neutrality pledge after the FCC</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="4.199">announced its plan to reveal net</text>
  <text start="78.479" dur="4.291">neutrality rules back in April and what</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="4.32">Comcast actually did is they literally</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="5.61">changed their promises about net</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="6.75">neutrality you can see here right before</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="5.73">April 26 it says net neutrality Comcast</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="4.47">is committed to an open Internet with a</text>
  <text start="94.11" dur="6.81">lot of different promises underneath and</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="6.57">then as of April 27th it changed and you</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="4.11">can see it says net neutrality Comcast</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="4.291">is committed to an open Internet but</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="4.799">hardly is much written underneath and</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="4.8">many of that verbiage changing this</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="4.32">tweet says Comcast flushed his</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="4.619">three-year-old Net Neutrality promise</text>
  <text start="114.149" dur="5.631">down the memory hold the instant the FCC</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="5.64">announced its plan to allow Network</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="4.24">discrimination according to a Comcast</text>
  <text start="122.399" dur="4.351">spokesperson they said they have quote</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="4.859">no plans to integrate internet fast</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="4.2">lanes but that means very little in the</text>
  <text start="128.879" dur="4.211">grand scheme of things as no plans and</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="6">corporates speak is not a definitive</text>
  <text start="133.09" dur="7.039">No so it looks like comcast you guys is</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="6.31">just waiting there waiting to be able to</text>
  <text start="140.129" dur="5.351">have their hands at any kind of</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="3.99">manipulation they can on the open</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="3.21">Internet and while telecom companies are</text>
  <text start="147.25" dur="3.47">backtracking on their net neutrality</text>
  <text start="148.69" dur="5.07">stances we also have a psychological</text>
  <text start="150.72" dur="4.9">shadow war going on against it as well</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="4.02">check out this article that came out</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="2.82">from Reuters just yesterday on November</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="4.14">29th</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="6.21">it says 57% of net neutrality comments</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="5.31">submitted to the FCC appear to be fake</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="5.04">the first sentence goes on to say more</text>
  <text start="167.23" dur="5.52">than half of the over 21 million public</text>
  <text start="169.69" dur="5.22">comments submitted to the FCC about net</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="4.41">neutrality this year used temporary or</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="5.28">duplicate emails and appeared to include</text>
  <text start="177.16" dur="6">false or misleading info so it seems to</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="6.03">be that there&amp;#39;s an army of literal BOTS</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="6.6">and trolls that have been set to confuse</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="5.64">and sway public opinion against net</text>
  <text start="189.76" dur="4.289">neutrality so there&amp;#39;s a serious war</text>
  <text start="191.86" dur="4.26">going on by the deep state to gain</text>
  <text start="194.049" dur="4.111">control the internet you guys because by</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="4.199">doing this they can literally shape the</text>
  <text start="198.16" dur="5.52">information that the public receives and</text>
  <text start="200.319" dur="5.25">control our minds this is pivotal for</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="4.08">their agenda and because of all this</text>
  <text start="205.569" dur="5.611">going on I decided to set myself up with</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="4.979">a virtual private network or VPN VPNs</text>
  <text start="211.18" dur="3.929">are basically a set of servers that</text>
  <text start="212.739" dur="4.11">connect you into your ISP or your</text>
  <text start="215.109" dur="3.69">internet service provider once you have</text>
  <text start="216.849" dur="4.14">established a connection with your VPN a</text>
  <text start="218.799" dur="3.87">process known as tunneling this acts as</text>
  <text start="220.989" dur="3.241">your virtual home on the Internet</text>
  <text start="222.669" dur="3.061">it&amp;#39;s as if you moved yourself into a</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="3.569">more secure office space without</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="4.14">actually having to move at all this way</text>
  <text start="227.799" dur="3.961">if any websites do get blocked for you</text>
  <text start="229.87" dur="3.449">the VPN can actually make it look like</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re logging in from somewhere else</text>
  <text start="233.319" dur="3.361">that does allow the web sites to be</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="3.42">viewed so then you&amp;#39;ll actually get to</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="4.05">view all the videos and articles that</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="4.289">you want to read that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="4.259">you looking at not only this but a VPN</text>
  <text start="242.799" dur="3.87">actually encrypts all the data that you</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="3.391">sent as well and I don&amp;#39;t know about you</text>
  <text start="246.669" dur="3.72">but I&amp;#39;m definitely someone that probably</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.439">has a target on my back so I want to</text>
  <text start="250.389" dur="3.72">keep all of my data safe I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="252.819" dur="3.241">want to mention some of the creepy</text>
  <text start="254.109" dur="4.231">stories I have about phishing attempts</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="4.62">and mysterious logins from people that</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="4.62">weren&amp;#39;t me into my Facebook and my web</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="4.8">site plus if you&amp;#39;re into Bitcoin or</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="3.93">cryptocurrency a VPN can actually</text>
  <text start="265.48" dur="4.14">you get around some of the regulations</text>
  <text start="266.89" dur="4.41">that some states have for crypto I live</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="3.78">in Washington state where crypto</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="3.51">exchanges are heavily regulated and I</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="3.3">actually can&amp;#39;t use many exchanges</text>
  <text start="274.81" dur="3.66">because they literally packed up and</text>
  <text start="276.7" dur="3.66">left Washington State when many of these</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="4.02">regulations against that went through</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="4.77">and in some states crypto currency is</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="4.32">downright illegal to buy with a VPN you</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="3.24">can get around all these problems with</text>
