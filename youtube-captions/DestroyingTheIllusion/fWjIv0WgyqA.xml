  <text start="2.28" dur="3.599">religion has always been a very</text>
  <text start="4.02" dur="4.35">convenient duality for the powers that</text>
  <text start="5.879" dur="4.59">be to rule over us and in each of these</text>
  <text start="8.37" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve always had their prophets to</text>
  <text start="10.469" dur="4.861">disseminate their BS on to the</text>
  <text start="12.75" dur="5.07">population for eons and eons we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="15.33" dur="4.74">our religious prophets that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="17.82" dur="3.69">necessarily speaking the Word of God to</text>
  <text start="20.07" dur="4.799">the people they&amp;#39;re just speaking their</text>

  <text start="24.869" dur="4.17">this day and age we also have those</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="3.659">scientific prophets that don&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="29.039" dur="3.441">speak the truth</text>
  <text start="30.119" dur="4.62">they just arrogantly assert their</text>
  <text start="32.48" dur="4.75">opinions upon the people to try and</text>
  <text start="34.739" dur="4.98">craft public perception two of these</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="6.12">faces being Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse</text>
  <text start="39.719" dur="6.09">Tyson these two are complete paid</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="4.439">skeptics now I don&amp;#39;t know whether</text>
  <text start="45.809" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re actually ignorant or if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="4.77">just on some three-letter agency payroll</text>
  <text start="49.95" dur="4.769">that might very well be but we do know</text>
  <text start="52.559" dur="3.84">that they are lying to the public and</text>
  <text start="54.719" dur="3.66">they lied to as a public about many many</text>
  <text start="56.399" dur="3.691">things but they&amp;#39;re do this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="58.379" dur="6.18">specifically used by the powers that be</text>
  <text start="60.09" dur="8.73">to be on the mainstream media or have</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="7.17">their own shows or basically spoon-fed</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="5.49">to the masses and arrogant type of</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="4.831">attitude that dismisses any alternative</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="4.47">thought because this is exactly how they</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="5.91">want the population to think have an</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="6.72">arrogant con overconfident attitude that</text>
  <text start="82.47" dur="5.49">dispels any outside of the box thinking</text>
  <text start="85.5" dur="2.88">and remains with the static quote status</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="4.26">quo</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="5.76">how convenient so might as well pay bill</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="7.32">and pay Neal to disseminate these lives</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="6.45">now look into a man and his website you</text>
  <text start="99.54" dur="3.24">might have heard of him already his</text>
  <text start="100.59" dur="4.709">name&amp;#39;s Rupert Sheldrake Rupert</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="4.409">Sheldrake&amp;#39;s Rupert Sheldrake&amp;#39;s fantastic</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="5.701">researcher he&amp;#39;s been out for decades and</text>
  <text start="107.189" dur="4.981">I remember him her watching interviews</text>
  <text start="111" dur="3.659">of him with Terence Mckenna</text>
  <text start="112.17" dur="4.11">you know on YouTube from back in the</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="3.541">study so he&amp;#39;s been out for a while and</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s the founder of the morphogenetic</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="4.949">field concept discussing how everything</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="4.41">within biology is connected he has a</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="4.411">website called skeptical about skeptics</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="4.74">in man it&amp;#39;s a great website because it</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="4.71">really lays out many scientific</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.39">researchers they&amp;#39;re dogmatic beliefs in</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="4.62">the falseness</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="4.98">of their beliefs and it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="3.84">resource so go check that out I&amp;#39;ll link</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="6.15">that down below but a few of the topics</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="5.85">that MIT Neal and knife Neal and I</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="5.07">completely lied to is about them that</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="5.07">are really easy to see through their BS</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="4.5">two of them being vaccines and GMOs</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="5.46">right through the classic controversial</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="4.77">issues with a lot of mainstream</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="5.1">propaganda put out there about them both</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="6.87">Bill Nye and neil degrasse are both very</text>
  <text start="162.21" dur="5.61">pro GMO and very Pro vaccines in fact</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="5.81">Bill Nye actually switched his stance on</text>
  <text start="167.82" dur="5.97">GMOs used to be Pro labeling and very</text>
  <text start="171.62" dur="4.87">skeptical about the GMO issue itself</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="4.86">being you know a good cat skeptic a</text>
  <text start="176.49" dur="6">quality skeptic about it but now he is</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="6.9">simply just another rhetoric pusher with</text>
  <text start="182.49" dur="5.91">the pro GMO issue so two very easy</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="5.73">concepts just to see these guys are BS</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="6.39">in US and another issue that I like to</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="5.82">that I&amp;#39;ve heard them both BS about is</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="4.89">cold fusion specifically bill not</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="4.62">actually because I went an interview</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="4.08">with Bill Nye one time and he said that</text>
  <text start="201.72" dur="4.83">cold fusion does not exist and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="4.46">complete hoax which really kind of</text>
  <text start="206.55" dur="6.57">pisses me off because that&amp;#39;s literally</text>
  <text start="208.22" dur="7.03">keeping life-changing and paradigm</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="6.03">changing information from the public</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="6.36">right there because cold fusion is a</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="5.73">very real concept it was in many</text>
  <text start="221.61" dur="4.56">reputable news articles and magazines</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="3.389">about it at the time when it was</text>
  <text start="226.17" dur="4.08">discussed as discovered until it went</text>
  <text start="228.269" dur="3.961">slack and got suppressed and a man named</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.38">dr. Eugene mallove who is a very</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="6.18">prominent physicist was literally beaten</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="5.52">to death in his home in 2004 for trying</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="4.92">to get the truth out to the public</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="5.88">behind the cold fusion concept because</text>
  <text start="243.33" dur="5.07">with cold fusion it shows that you can</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="6.72">easily produce mass amounts of energy</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="5.58">without the need of fossil fuels so for</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="3.6">Bill Nye to withhold that information</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="3.84">from the public he&amp;#39;s going to get some</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="3.9">karma for that one I&amp;#39;m telling you that</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="4.289">much so these two guys Bill Nye and Neil</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="4.229">deGrasse Tyson you really need to</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="5.011">realize that much of the science out</text>
  <text start="264.479" dur="4.261">there is not in fact real science</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="4.65">and all and a lot of people who claim to</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="4.8">be skeptical are not skeptical they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="4.5">just what we call obey errs and</text>
  <text start="273.54" dur="5.01">repeaters their information regurgitator</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="4.92">that like to feel right but they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="4.89">handle their ego deep down and admit</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="5.13">that what they&amp;#39;ve been told is a lie and</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="4.89">they don&amp;#39;t actually have any idea about</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="4.89">what the truth is so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="4.98">finding scientific truth humble yourself</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="6.179">realize that much of what we didn&amp;#39;t top</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="5.82">is BS and one of my favorite quotes Yoda</text>
  <text start="297.389" dur="3.241">you&amp;#39;re going to have to unlearn and</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="4.14">relearn so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to relearn a</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="5.4">lot of scientific truths with people who</text>
  <text start="303.27" dur="6.05">are not she&amp;#39;ll not or Neil deGrasse</text>
  <text start="306.03" dur="3.29">Tyson done</text>
