  <text start="44.16" dur="6.11">it&amp;#39;s called matcha and the reason I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="4.32">passing along this specifically is</text>
  <text start="50.27" dur="5.5">because lately I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of people</text>
  <text start="52.59" dur="6.239">come to me asking me how they can get</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="5.58">off their addiction to coffee people are</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="4.8">beginning to realize how bad coffee</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="4.83">really is and it&amp;#39;s something that I try</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="4.56">to help a lot of my clients overcome is</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="3.66">how much coffee they&amp;#39;re really addicted</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="3.571">to and just getting them to see it as an</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="4.92">addiction in general because coffee is a</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="5.46">drug and I live in I live in Seattle for</text>
  <text start="74.76" dur="4.44">hexing I mean coffee capital of the</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.56">world and I see what coffee does to</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="5.669">people and how deeply entrenched their</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="4.89">egos are in the supplements so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.221">really great way don&amp;#39;t watch itself is a</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.97">really great way to get off of caffeine</text>
  <text start="89.09" dur="5.08">because a sidetrack</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="2.76">I just want to tell you how bad caffeine</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="3.69">really is for you and what it exactly</text>
  <text start="95.4" dur="4.859">does really screws up our nervous system</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="4.95">our dopamine and serotonin receptors in</text>
  <text start="100.259" dur="4.86">our brain because it is that external</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="4.349">source of addiction right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="4.29">fleeting addiction that the dopamine fix</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="4.651">I call it so it screws up our nervous</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="4.981">system and that&amp;#39;s not a good thing</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="5.01">because for us to attain spiritual</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="3.93">growth our nervous system is the literal</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="3.18">energy carrier it&amp;#39;s the energy system of</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="2.88">our body so we don&amp;#39;t want to mess up we</text>
  <text start="120" dur="5.28">want to keep our nervous system very</text>
  <text start="121.2" dur="8.91">nice and clean and caffeine really</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="6.84">screws it up and then also stress stress</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="4.09">hormones so caffeine will definitely</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="4.33">throw you into adrenal fatigue</text>
  <text start="134.2" dur="4.74">we live in what&amp;#39;s called a sympathetic</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="4.02">overload Society because we&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="3.21">stressed out were always mentally</text>
  <text start="140.47" dur="5.43">stressed out we physically stress our</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="6.81">bodies out and it&amp;#39;s all honoring that</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="4.59">yang energy of our stress because stress</text>
  <text start="148.96" dur="4.38">is like a union relationship in our body</text>
  <text start="150.49" dur="4.05">we have the yang the breakdown the</text>
  <text start="153.34" dur="2.7">fight-or-flight and then we have the</text>
  <text start="154.54" dur="3.84">rest and digest or the yin or the</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="4.56">feminine stresses of our body and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.38" dur="3.3">so much in simple a sympathetic overload</text>
  <text start="160.6" dur="2.13">that people keep drinking coffee coffee</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="3.72">coffee and that&amp;#39;s keeping him there</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s not good you screw screws up your</text>
  <text start="165.4" dur="2.94">metabolism like I said the nervous</text>
  <text start="166.6" dur="4.2">system adrenal fatigue yada yada so</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="5.7">anyway those are lectures for later</text>
  <text start="170.8" dur="5.28">videos but what&amp;#39;s cool about da matcha</text>
  <text start="174.04" dur="4.05">is is that it has a quarter of the</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="4.74">caffeine and as an average cup of coffee</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="4.59">so like me with my own personal</text>
  <text start="180.82" dur="3.21">addictions I&amp;#39;ve had two caffeine I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="3.84">been doing a lot of dough matcha it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="4.29">great way to still maintain all the</text>
  <text start="186.52" dur="4.74">energy levels with all the antioxidants</text>
  <text start="188.32" dur="4.29">and coffee or don&amp;#39;t watch I mean so but</text>
  <text start="191.26" dur="6.09">without the caffeine without that</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="6.599">adrenal stimulation and also a very cool</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="3.93">thing about dou matcha is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.209" dur="3.601">an a lot of what&amp;#39;s called l-theanine an</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="3.54">amino acid called elfine in that</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="3.84">l-theanine in there and you guys will</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="4.26">like this but what l-theanine does is</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="5.67">that it stimulates alpha waves in our</text>
  <text start="209.08" dur="5.85">brain it really helps our brain resonate</text>
  <text start="212.32" dur="4.71">in the Alpha range which if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="4.339">know about brain waves the Alpha range</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="5.459">of our brain waves is associated with a</text>
  <text start="219.269" dur="5.171">calm relaxed waking consciousness so</text>
  <text start="222.489" dur="4.861">you&amp;#39;re much more calm you get a very</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="5.639">good just overall kind of grounded sense</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="4.979">of well-being in that range and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.079" dur="3.63">great that don&amp;#39;t watch it does that so</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="3.331">you get the energy you get the mental</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="4.951">calmness and you get much more vibrant</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="5.43">energy not a kind of fake energy from</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="5.73">other sources of caffeine add a more</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="6.06">kind of neurotic sense of anxiety so</text>
  <text start="244.39" dur="4.89">also it&amp;#39;s cheap to that box that I</text>
  <text start="247.15" dur="3.57">showed you this box 50 cents of serving</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="2.58">right some people go to a freaking</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="2.579">drive-through coffee stands and pay like</text>
  <text start="251.86" dur="3.57">five bucks a day it&amp;#39;s crazy how much</text>
  <text start="253.299" dur="3.331">money they waste so anyway I wanted to</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="3.899">pass along that information to you guys</text>
  <text start="256.63" dur="5.4">little info on just kind of stress with</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="4.981">stress does in our bodies the the how</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="4.35">bad our addictions to caffeine really</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="2.6">are and then a way you can get off that</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="1.97">away</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;ve helped many people get off that and</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="5.4">that is with go matcha much healthier</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="5.22">stuff much better of a habit still a</text>
