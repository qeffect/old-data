  <text start="11.91" dur="4.03">what&amp;#39;s going on ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="13.959" dur="4.621">August second here and as you can tell</text>
  <text start="15.94" dur="4.65">back to the whiteboard today I went</text>
  <text start="18.58" dur="3.36">black then I went back trying the</text>
  <text start="20.59" dur="4.41">blackboard out yesterday just kind of</text>
  <text start="21.94" dur="5.4">failed miserably so sticking with the</text>
  <text start="25" dur="3.9">white and you can rest assured though</text>
  <text start="27.34" dur="3.359">that I&amp;#39;m looking at getting a massive</text>
  <text start="28.9" dur="3.839">new whiteboard probably one that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="30.699" dur="3.241">four times the size of this one you know</text>
  <text start="32.739" dur="4.231">I don&amp;#39;t even know if a little fit in</text>
  <text start="33.94" dur="4.139">this little spare room here but you know</text>
  <text start="36.97" dur="3.63">if you do want to help in the</text>
  <text start="38.079" dur="5.371">acquisition of my new whiteboard PayPal</text>
  <text start="40.6" dur="4.86">the patreon down below so cool thing</text>
  <text start="43.45" dur="3.21">though is that it&amp;#39;ll be so big that I</text>
  <text start="45.46" dur="3.57">won&amp;#39;t even have to worry about like</text>
  <text start="46.66" dur="3.93">keeping these little lines straight on</text>
  <text start="49.03" dur="3.779">the video it&amp;#39;s like one of the things it</text>
  <text start="50.59" dur="4.08">kills my OCD is when the cameras like</text>
  <text start="52.809" dur="3.75">this and then I got to spend five</text>
  <text start="54.67" dur="4.56">minutes just like adjusting it to be</text>
  <text start="56.559" dur="6.27">straight but anyway it&amp;#39;ll be coming in</text>
  <text start="59.23" dur="5.849">the mail soon anyway with this video I</text>
  <text start="62.829" dur="3.75">wanted to make on vaccines and the</text>
  <text start="65.079" dur="4.5">reason that I want to do it on vaccines</text>
  <text start="66.579" dur="5.49">is because I got a comment on one of my</text>
  <text start="69.579" dur="6.81">youtube videos actually from a friend of</text>
  <text start="72.069" dur="6.36">ours named B for Bastet and b4 bastard</text>
  <text start="76.389" dur="5.43">goes on to say good idea to make</text>
  <text start="78.429" dur="6.87">in-depth news analysis thank you please</text>
  <text start="81.819" dur="4.381">do some about controversial topics well</text>
  <text start="85.299" dur="2.791">my friend I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="86.2" dur="4.259">many of my videos on this channel but</text>
  <text start="88.09" dur="4.619">that&amp;#39;s pretty much all I do but they go</text>
  <text start="90.459" dur="5.43">on to ask where do I start</text>
  <text start="92.709" dur="7.37">vaccine a research by the way what is</text>
  <text start="95.889" dur="7.53">the smoking gun awesome question and</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="7.63">because of this comment and because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="103.419" dur="6.421">seen many news articles lately in the</text>
  <text start="107.709" dur="5.55">media about vaccines I&amp;#39;m just gonna make</text>
  <text start="109.84" dur="5.669">this whole you know this whole video on</text>
  <text start="113.259" dur="4.74">that topic give a good overview with a</text>
  <text start="115.509" dur="4.92">lot of little rabbit holes you can begin</text>
  <text start="117.999" dur="5.22">to go do your own research with because</text>
  <text start="120.429" dur="4.23">with the vaccine topic it&amp;#39;s almost one</text>
  <text start="123.219" dur="3.15">of the biggest red pills there is</text>
  <text start="124.659" dur="4.411">primarily because there&amp;#39;s so much fear</text>
  <text start="126.369" dur="5.221">associated with it so much ignorance so</text>
  <text start="129.07" dur="3.97">I&amp;#39;ll give you some rabbit holes to go</text>
  <text start="131.59" dur="4.42">research down on your own</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="5.91">and then that can thus prepare you so</text>
  <text start="136.01" dur="4.41">when everybody tries to ridicule you or</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="3.929">think they know more or really try to</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="4.62">defend the matrix right when you start</text>
  <text start="142.879" dur="3.511">to question it in public or around your</text>
  <text start="145.04" dur="3.21">friends and family and someone comes up</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="3.36">and starts you know saying that back it</text>
  <text start="148.25" dur="3.39">seems eradicated disease and these</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="4.11">anti-vaxxers are killing the world well</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="6.33">you&amp;#39;ll be prepared to shut them down</text>
  <text start="153.86" dur="7.26">with some good information and true</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="5.239">knowledge so few of the news articles</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s that have come out in the past</text>
  <text start="163.209" dur="8.021">week or so this one I found on science</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="7.38">alert com mainstream science news media</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="6.06">publication right and they titled this</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="4.889">article just a few anti-vaxxers can</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="5.25">triple annual disease rates a new</text>
  <text start="179.359" dur="5.701">studies show and cost hospitals</text>
  <text start="182.54" dur="5.009">thousands of dollars so they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="4.38">trying to guilt-trip yeah guilt-trip the</text>
  <text start="187.549" dur="5.25">ignorant i should say with this one and</text>
  <text start="189.44" dur="5.1">this article was based on a new study</text>
  <text start="192.799" dur="4.141">that was published in the journal of the</text>
  <text start="194.54" dur="4.379">American Medical Association otherwise</text>
  <text start="196.94" dur="5.28">known as the American Mafia Association</text>
  <text start="198.919" dur="5.82">medical mafia association right and this</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="5.25">came out on July 24th but it basically</text>
  <text start="204.739" dur="4.771">says here just a small decline in</text>
  <text start="207.47" dur="4.199">childhood measles vaccination levels can</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="5.43">produce disproportionate negative</text>
  <text start="211.669" dur="6.35">effects both to public health and the</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="7.639">economy new research has revealed</text>
  <text start="218.019" dur="7.33">interesting let&amp;#39;s move on this next one</text>
  <text start="222.579" dur="5.141">published on Business Insider actually</text>
  <text start="225.349" dur="4.591">just yesterday good find here right</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="4.47">before I did this video this one says</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="4.47">nine dangerous diseases that could be</text>
  <text start="232.19" dur="6.84">prevented by vaccines within the next</text>
  <text start="234.41" dur="7.079">decade from HIV to cancer and you know</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="4.65">this Business Insider is just one of the</text>
  <text start="241.489" dur="4.59">worst out there but this article goes on</text>
  <text start="243.68" dur="8.58">to talk about malaria</text>
  <text start="246.079" dur="9.06">you know Ebola HIV norovirus a yoder</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="4.349">universal flu vaccine and even one for</text>
  <text start="255.139" dur="5.041">Zika hmm</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="6.271">right so the deep state they just love</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="5.28">to create their own diseases and then</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="3.45">that push a vaccine upon the populace to</text>
  <text start="265.46" dur="2.85">come</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="3.72">the disease that they created right I</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t know if you know but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="5.88">1947 patent by the rockefeller owned by</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="6.09">the Rockefeller Foundation for Zika you</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="6.269">know Ebola most likely by a warfare</text>
  <text start="279.74" dur="5.82">agent that was created boom next video</text>
  <text start="282.199" dur="5.37">right there bio warfare agents like</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="6.509">seriously do that but you know so this</text>
  <text start="287.569" dur="6.78">this type of concept these ideas of a</text>
  <text start="292.069" dur="4.641">vaccine being able to cure and prevent</text>
  <text start="294.349" dur="5.491">everything under the Sun right mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="4.63">it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like nature didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="4.859">what it was doing when it created our</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="5.819">immune system right I&amp;#39;d I don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="304.699" dur="5.551">and then this last one here again by</text>
  <text start="307.159" dur="6.66">science alert says a vaccine for type 1</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="5.46">diabetes begins human trials in 2018 so</text>
  <text start="313.819" dur="4.141">again vaccine for everything under the</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.169">Sun because who cares about informing</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="3.9">yourself and taking responsibility for</text>
  <text start="319.879" dur="4.801">your own health let&amp;#39;s just shoot it all</text>
  <text start="321.86" dur="4.32">the way so anyway some ridiculous news</text>
  <text start="324.68" dur="4.169">stories in the media the past couple</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="5.039">weeks now I want to talk about them so</text>
  <text start="328.849" dur="4.831">first a quick word on the reliability of</text>
  <text start="331.219" dur="4.801">this so-called quote science that</text>
  <text start="333.68" dur="5.519">everybody&amp;#39;s has like this addiction with</text>
  <text start="336.02" dur="6.359">right I want to talk to you about two</text>
  <text start="339.199" dur="6.631">quotes that I really like to steer</text>
  <text start="342.379" dur="5.641">people towards when they think that you</text>
  <text start="345.83" dur="5.36">know everything that comes out of this</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="6.92">so-called mainstream scientific realm is</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="6.52">you know the end-all be-all truth okay</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="6.31">first I want to point you towards dr.</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="5.609">Richard Horton who was actually a former</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="3.99">editor of The Lancet you know one of the</text>
  <text start="363.319" dur="5.46">most premier medical journals in the</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="6.45">world in 2015 he actually stated that</text>
  <text start="368.779" dur="6.931">perhaps and said perhaps half of all</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="6.39">scientific literature is untrue and this</text>
  <text start="375.71" dur="6.569">was a dude again former editor of The</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="6.149">Lancet and yet another one here a former</text>
  <text start="382.279" dur="7.591">editor of the New England Journal of</text>
  <text start="384.229" dur="10.891">Medicine New England fixed that Journal</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="6.64">of Medicine in 2010 dr. dr. Marcia angle</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="4.51">or angel emissary</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="6.24">but she basically said it&amp;#39;s simply no</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="7.44">longer possible to believe much of the</text>
  <text start="402.75" dur="6.69">clinical research that is published okay</text>
  <text start="407.07" dur="5.49">and I&amp;#39;ll leave a collective Evolution</text>
  <text start="409.44" dur="5.19">article down below discussing both of</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="4.38">these and you&amp;#39;ll be able to find exactly</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="4.53">where they set it and do all your left</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="6">brain research for it but basically</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="7.65">right science is not the end-all be-all</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="6.54">daba can be very easily manipulated and</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="4.98">a lot of these studies and research that</text>
  <text start="429.48" dur="4.34">come out of medical journals or</text>
  <text start="431.79" dur="5.61">prestigious institutions right it can be</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="6.19">so easily crafted to fit a specific</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="4.56">agenda or specific narrative so remember</text>
  <text start="440.01" dur="3.63">that okay remember that when you look at</text>
  <text start="441.96" dur="5.76">any scientific issue whether it&amp;#39;s cancer</text>
  <text start="443.64" dur="9.26">vaccine vaccines climate change energy</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="7.74">research whatever the case may be the</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="4.69">institutions or the science I should say</text>
  <text start="455.46" dur="4.05">that comes from institutions is not true</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="4.41">science its dogma</text>
  <text start="459.51" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s a fundamentalist type of attitude</text>
  <text start="462" dur="4.98">that comes from them true science is the</text>
  <text start="464.64" dur="3.33">open-mindedness questioning of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.98" dur="3.45">really going on in here</text>
  <text start="467.97" dur="4.74">so I mean in essence we&amp;#39;re all actually</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="3.78">scientists when we&amp;#39;re all doing our own</text>
  <text start="472.71" dur="4.86">research and trying to find out the</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="5.46">truth of what&amp;#39;s going on here so the</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="6.45">science that comes from these</text>
  <text start="479.67" dur="6.48">institutions is very flimsy and I just</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="3.66">want to make a note on vaccines and the</text>
  <text start="486.15" dur="5.61">nervous system okay this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="5.61">gonna start here so you know it&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="491.76" dur="3.81">people know that vaccines used to</text>
  <text start="493.29" dur="4.11">contain mercury and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="495.57" dur="4.14">think these days that all the mercury</text>
  <text start="497.4" dur="5.61">has been taken out but this is actually</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="6.36">not the case so mercury is still very</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="5.49">well the case in some vaccines and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="5.48">not at safe levels because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="6.84">safe levels of mercury mercury is the</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="7.35">second most toxic chemical known to man</text>
  <text start="515.34" dur="6.45">besides uranium and in vaccines</text>
  <text start="518.9" dur="4.9">primarily in the flu shot and it may or</text>
  <text start="521.79" dur="5.34">may not still be in the hep-v pet bee</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="6.39">and a few others it is at very very high</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="6.3">levels okay point five part</text>
  <text start="530.19" dur="5.79">per billion kills brain cells to parts</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="5.04">per billion of mercury is the EPA limit</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="6.51">for safe drinking water and check this</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="8.03">in many vaccines some vaccines still but</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="8.37">many of the ones in the past 25,000 to</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="7.81">50,000 parts per billion huge and this</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="5.76">is being injected right into your body</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="6.3">right in your blood intramuscularly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="6.42">called right into you okay and while</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="5.19">mercury yes in some cases has been</text>
  <text start="563.04" dur="6.57">phased out not completely what is it</text>
  <text start="565.8" dur="6.48">being replaced by aluminum aluminum is</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="6.45">just as bad if not worse for your</text>
  <text start="572.28" dur="5.52">nervous system than mercury and every</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="3.54">single vaccine if it&amp;#39;s not preserved</text>
  <text start="577.8" dur="4.74">with thimerosal or the mercury</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="7.68">derivative its preserved in aluminum</text>
  <text start="582.54" dur="7.44">aluminum hydroxide often so not good</text>
  <text start="587.28" dur="5.04">right every single vaccine a side effect</text>
  <text start="589.98" dur="4.47">of it is brain swelling encephalitis why</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="4.95">well you&amp;#39;re injecting heavy metals</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="6.33">directly into your body or your child&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.27" dur="7.26">body so think of that and I mean not</text>
  <text start="600.78" dur="6.99">only is mercury toxic but aluminum again</text>
  <text start="604.53" dur="5.7">just as bad and in the standard schedule</text>
  <text start="607.77" dur="3.93">the most children have these days if you</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="3.99">take your child to get every single</text>
  <text start="611.7" dur="5.93">vaccine that the CDD says you need to</text>
  <text start="614.22" dur="3.41">get to be protected</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="6.55">6150 micrograms of aluminum is in that</text>
  <text start="621.78" dur="4.44">full schedule from the age of 0 to 18</text>
  <text start="624.27" dur="6.78">being injected into children&amp;#39;s bodies</text>
  <text start="626.22" dur="8.73">six over six milligrams that&amp;#39;s insane</text>
  <text start="631.05" dur="6.93">and we wonder why things like autism and</text>
  <text start="634.95" dur="5.03">ADHD are becoming so prevalent in our</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="4.23">youth and we wonder why</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="5.109">neurodegenerative diseases like dementia</text>
  <text start="642.21" dur="6.42">and Alzheimer&amp;#39;s are affecting elderly</text>
  <text start="645.089" dur="5.341">people right injection of heavy metals</text>
  <text start="648.63" dur="3.3">and not only the injection but I</text>
  <text start="650.43" dur="3">remember but remember these heavy metals</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="3.75">are in our food they&amp;#39;re being sprayed</text>
  <text start="653.43" dur="6.09">over heads overhead there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="5.34">influxes of this into our body so one of</text>
  <text start="659.52" dur="3.33">the biggest influx is those vaccines</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="2.6">because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s injected directly into</text>
  <text start="662.85" dur="4.01">us</text>
  <text start="663.62" dur="5.06">so understand that mmm there is no safe</text>
  <text start="666.86" dur="3.75">vaccine there can&amp;#39;t be a safe vaccine</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="5.08">because it&amp;#39;s being injected directly</text>
  <text start="670.61" dur="5.22">into you and speaking of which with the</text>
  <text start="673.76" dur="4.079">injection directly into the body let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="675.83" dur="2.64">talk about vaccines in the immune system</text>
  <text start="677.839" dur="3.121">okay</text>
  <text start="678.47" dur="4.8">vaccines do not stimulate the proper</text>
  <text start="680.96" dur="5.76">response for true immunity because</text>
  <text start="683.27" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re injecting them nature or God or</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="5.13">whatever you want to call it did not</text>
  <text start="688.19" dur="4.649">make our bodies so we injected health</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="4.41">into us</text>
  <text start="692.839" dur="5.611">you cannot inject true immune function</text>
  <text start="696.26" dur="4.95">into you okay I don&amp;#39;t know who thought</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="4.11">that and kept along with it but you know</text>
  <text start="701.21" dur="5.46">let&amp;#39;s bring common sense into the</text>
  <text start="702.56" dur="5.7">picture here when you inject a vaccine</text>
  <text start="706.67" dur="3.96">it to you it does not stimulate it</text>
  <text start="708.26" dur="4.68">stimulates certain antibodies at very</text>
  <text start="710.63" dur="3.87">high levels but not all of them not all</text>
  <text start="712.94" dur="3.26">of them in the proper manner in which</text>
  <text start="714.5" dur="4.35">they should so it&amp;#39;ll actually</text>
  <text start="716.2" dur="5.05">hypersensitive am UHN system because you</text>
  <text start="718.85" dur="4.11">only get an antibody response from a</text>
  <text start="721.25" dur="3.36">couple antibodies that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="722.96" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;ll then test for and say oh the</text>
  <text start="724.61" dur="2.16">vaccine works look at these antibodies</text>
  <text start="726.08" dur="2.4">that we found</text>
  <text start="726.77" dur="2.88">well they don&amp;#39;t test for all the other</text>
  <text start="728.48" dur="3.63">stuff that&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="729.65" dur="4.26">short-term tests as well so they hyper</text>
  <text start="732.11" dur="4.74">sensitive the immune system which is</text>
  <text start="733.91" dur="5.69">causing autoimmunity this is one of the</text>
  <text start="736.85" dur="5.01">primary reasons we&amp;#39;re seeing asthma</text>
  <text start="739.6" dur="4.21">allergies especially in our youth</text>
  <text start="741.86" dur="6.96">becoming so prevalent and a lot of other</text>
  <text start="743.81" dur="7.44">autoimmune disease has become skyrocket</text>
  <text start="748.82" dur="4.98">per se remember that news article I</text>
  <text start="751.25" dur="4.77">mentioned that said a vaccine for type 1</text>
  <text start="753.8" dur="3.3">diabetes begins human trials well</text>
  <text start="756.02" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s actually a lot of good research</text>
  <text start="757.1" dur="4.739">showing that vaccines themselves that</text>
  <text start="759.56" dur="3.84">are causing this type 1 diabetes so what</text>
  <text start="761.839" dur="4.381">kind of ask backwards world do we live</text>
  <text start="763.4" dur="4.35">in where now we&amp;#39;re needing a vaccine for</text>
  <text start="766.22" dur="3.51">the disease it&amp;#39;s actually caused by</text>
  <text start="767.75" dur="5.88">vaccines but again they won&amp;#39;t tell you</text>
  <text start="769.73" dur="6.87">that yes they don&amp;#39;t want to so vaccines</text>
  <text start="773.63" dur="4.44">do not repeat do not stimulate the</text>
  <text start="776.6" dur="4.35">proper immune response and this is like</text>
  <text start="778.07" dur="6.48">one of the ingrained ideas that people</text>
  <text start="780.95" dur="5.639">it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s so built into their</text>
  <text start="784.55" dur="4.47">subconscious that it&amp;#39;s so tough for them</text>
  <text start="786.589" dur="5.521">to relearn this vaccine topic because</text>
  <text start="789.02" dur="4.89">they think vaccines stimulate our immune</text>
  <text start="792.11" dur="5.01">system beneficially but this is not the</text>
  <text start="793.91" dur="5.55">case and herd immunity in the</text>
  <text start="797.12" dur="4.62">theory of disease are both medical BS</text>
  <text start="799.46" dur="5.16">only good article down below explaining</text>
  <text start="801.74" dur="4.65">it hurt immunity it completely in depth</text>
  <text start="804.62" dur="5.43">I don&amp;#39;t want this video to be too long</text>
  <text start="806.39" dur="5.55">here and also the germ theory that idea</text>
  <text start="810.05" dur="4.41">of being that it&amp;#39;s germs that cause</text>
  <text start="811.94" dur="4.89">disease it&amp;#39;s completely faulty because</text>
  <text start="814.46" dur="4.47">in your body you have trillions and</text>
  <text start="816.83" dur="6.18">trillions of bacterial cells right now</text>
  <text start="818.93" dur="7.77">our health depends on the ratio of good</text>
  <text start="823.01" dur="5.85">to bad it depends on how you treat the</text>
  <text start="826.7" dur="4.47">environment that way in which the germs</text>
  <text start="828.86" dur="4.29">live if you treat yourself unhealthily</text>
  <text start="831.17" dur="4.68">well then the bat bacteria will over</text>
  <text start="833.15" dur="7.17">grow the good and you will get sick but</text>
  <text start="835.85" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s you know not germs themselves</text>
  <text start="840.32" dur="3.81">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of germs and you</text>
  <text start="841.46" dur="5.49">that are protecting you as well right so</text>
  <text start="844.13" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s this is very faulty as well and</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="5.1">then vaccines eradicating disease so I</text>
  <text start="850.16" dur="3.96">already mentioned up here how they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="852.05" dur="5.46">truly stimulate the immune system well</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="5.4">because of this because the elites knew</text>
  <text start="857.51" dur="6.12">this when they were bringing all of</text>
  <text start="859.52" dur="7.14">these you know vaccine programs onto the</text>
  <text start="863.63" dur="4.709">public back in the 50s and 60s when they</text>
  <text start="866.66" dur="4.98">first started doing it they had to</text>
  <text start="868.339" dur="5.341">really lie to us they had to bring out</text>
  <text start="871.64" dur="4.17">the propaganda because vaccines don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="873.68" dur="4.409">actually help the immune system so they</text>
  <text start="875.81" dur="3.93">told us it eradicated diseases and they</text>
  <text start="878.089" dur="3.591">did some clever tricks when they brought</text>
  <text start="879.74" dur="4.71">these vaccines up to make us think that</text>
  <text start="881.68" dur="5.59">of course they did that through</text>
  <text start="884.45" dur="4.59">propaganda both in the medical textbooks</text>
  <text start="887.27" dur="5.189">and through the media as you can see</text>
  <text start="889.04" dur="5.76">media examples right here but when you</text>
  <text start="892.459" dur="4.971">delve into the real information you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="6.27">find that infectious diseases declined</text>
  <text start="897.43" dur="6.279">almost 99% in many cases before vaccines</text>
  <text start="901.07" dur="5.31">were even introduced in the mid 1900s so</text>
  <text start="903.709" dur="6">if you look at polio for instance polio</text>
  <text start="906.38" dur="4.26">is declining very rapidly measles</text>
  <text start="909.709" dur="5.851">whooping cough</text>
  <text start="910.64" dur="7.16">you know pertussis Oh chickenpox all of</text>
  <text start="915.56" dur="4.35">these diseases were declining immensely</text>
  <text start="917.8" dur="5.62">before the vaccines were even introduced</text>
  <text start="919.91" dur="6.45">and why is that well sanitation and</text>
  <text start="923.42" dur="5.07">nutrition in the mid 1900s indoor</text>
  <text start="926.36" dur="3.6">plumbing became the hot new rage</text>
  <text start="928.49" dur="3.87">everybody started you know</text>
  <text start="929.96" dur="4.8">toilets and stuff that actually carried</text>
  <text start="932.36" dur="4.89">their waste out of their homes with the</text>
  <text start="934.76" dur="4.38">advent of the highway system around</text>
  <text start="937.25" dur="4.38">America the Eisenhower highway system we</text>
  <text start="939.14" dur="4.53">were able to transport foods people were</text>
  <text start="941.63" dur="4.62">eating more balanced diets they were</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="4.68">eating more complete meals with more</text>
  <text start="946.25" dur="4.23">nutrition in it so the bodies were</text>
  <text start="948.35" dur="4.71">getting stronger their immune systems</text>
  <text start="950.48" dur="3.96">were functioning as they should because</text>
  <text start="953.06" dur="3.48">there was you know they&amp;#39;re in cleaner</text>
  <text start="954.44" dur="6.06">environments and ate better so it was</text>
  <text start="956.54" dur="7.28">declining the disease rates but hey</text>
  <text start="960.5" dur="5.88">these right the people that own the</text>
  <text start="963.82" dur="4.42">media companies that own the medical</text>
  <text start="966.38" dur="3.33">companies the controller&amp;#39;s of our world</text>
  <text start="968.24" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re doing a damn good job with what</text>
  <text start="969.71" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re doing so they brought the</text>
  <text start="971.06" dur="5.19">vaccines in they you know brought some</text>
  <text start="974.18" dur="4.29">propaganda out along with it and the</text>
  <text start="976.25" dur="4.4">population began to think that vaccines</text>
  <text start="978.47" dur="5.46">eradicated is the disease not the case</text>
  <text start="980.65" dur="5.71">and lastly one cool trick that they also</text>
  <text start="983.93" dur="6.36">did was redefine the diseases so when</text>
  <text start="986.36" dur="6.12">for instance polio came out they began</text>
  <text start="990.29" dur="3.69">they redefined it a little bit so a lot</text>
  <text start="992.48" dur="3.27">of people that used to get diagnosed</text>
  <text start="993.98" dur="4.23">with polio we&amp;#39;re then getting diagnosed</text>
  <text start="995.75" dur="5.16">with meningitis instead so it</text>
  <text start="998.21" dur="5.22">artificially lowered the polio rates and</text>
  <text start="1000.91" dur="6.48">made it look like it was the vaccine</text>
  <text start="1003.43" dur="5.4">that annihilated polio but little do</text>
  <text start="1007.39" dur="3.09">people know that it was men in the</text>
  <text start="1008.83" dur="4.97">meningitis numbers bumped up at the</text>
  <text start="1010.48" dur="5.64">exact same time it was just a it was a</text>
  <text start="1013.8" dur="6.04">diagnosis differentiation that occurred</text>
  <text start="1016.12" dur="7.86">so clever tricks right clever tricks but</text>
  <text start="1019.84" dur="6.06">all in all you know with the more the</text>
  <text start="1023.98" dur="4.979">vaccine propaganda is coming out it</text>
  <text start="1025.9" dur="4.89">seems like we&amp;#39;re inevitably headed</text>
  <text start="1028.959" dur="4.861">towards a society that has mandatory</text>
  <text start="1030.79" dur="6">vaccinations this is not the case there</text>
  <text start="1033.82" dur="5.519">is good news out there right this</text>
  <text start="1036.79" dur="4.35">information is spreading which is why</text>
  <text start="1039.339" dur="3.781">they have to come out with all this</text>
  <text start="1041.14" dur="4.65">propaganda in full force because people</text>
  <text start="1043.12" dur="6.72">are waking up I&amp;#39;m seeing you know we see</text>
  <text start="1045.79" dur="6.63">snooze stories trying to that are saying</text>
  <text start="1049.84" dur="4.47">you know this so-and-so state or so</text>
  <text start="1052.42" dur="3.6">until city you know lowest vaccine rates</text>
  <text start="1054.31" dur="3.12">ever so then they really have to pump up</text>
  <text start="1056.02" dur="3.57">their propaganda to get it into people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1057.43" dur="4.349">heads but people are waking up and again</text>
  <text start="1059.59" dur="3.899">we&amp;#39;re also seeing protests occur across</text>
  <text start="1061.779" dur="5.01">the world don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re familiar</text>
  <text start="1063.489" dur="5.25">but recently in Italy because they pass</text>
  <text start="1066.789" dur="4.23">their mandatory vaccine laws people were</text>
  <text start="1068.739" dur="6.591">literally marching in the streets for it</text>
  <text start="1071.019" dur="7.08">and also I just saw today in Sweden they</text>
  <text start="1075.33" dur="4.269">struck down their mandatory vaccine laws</text>
  <text start="1078.099" dur="3.841">because they said it violates the</text>
  <text start="1079.599" dur="6.12">Constitution so there are political</text>
  <text start="1081.94" dur="6.059">forces out there that are trying to get</text>
  <text start="1085.719" dur="3.66">rid of mandatory vaccines even though of</text>
  <text start="1087.999" dur="3.42">course there&amp;#39;s some factions that are</text>
  <text start="1089.379" dur="3.691">trying to bring it on to us but the more</text>
  <text start="1091.419" dur="3">we educate ourselves and the more we</text>
  <text start="1093.07" dur="4.529">educate our friends and family with</text>
  <text start="1094.419" dur="5.01">information like this the less likely</text>
  <text start="1097.599" dur="5.221">that these mandatory vaccines will even</text>
  <text start="1099.429" dur="4.771">exist and the more that we can wake up</text>
  <text start="1102.82" dur="4.14">our friends and family to what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1104.2" dur="5.459">causing diseases which vaccines being</text>
  <text start="1106.96" dur="5.25">one of the main disease-causing things</text>
