  <text start="50.539" dur="4.36">there was this thing called the OPP T</text>
  <text start="53.16" dur="3.93">that came out and we fell like there was</text>
  <text start="54.899" dur="4.771">we could have added our voices to add</text>
  <text start="57.09" dur="4.5">more clarity to the situation and we</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="3.84">decided to do a podcast and then that</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="3.749">turned into a blog and then we decided</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="2.88">we could share a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="3.301">different things we could share our</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="3.99">ideas and our perspectives about all</text>

  <text start="70.38" dur="3.12">that we know the truth but just trying</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="2.911">to get a different point of view out</text>
  <text start="73.5" dur="3.78">there to make people think so that they</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="5.04">can understand the truth better and then</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="4.53">that kind of blossomed into well now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="3.45">really trying to focus on providing</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="3.69">people the tools so that they can become</text>

  <text start="360.86" dur="2.97">want to unite to change the planet</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re gonna and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="3.39">take some of the issues that we are</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="3.63">really passionate about and put them to</text>
  <text start="367.22" dur="3.36">the side for a little bit so that we can</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="3.51">find common ground and work together and</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s happening like right now yeah and</text>
  <text start="372.47" dur="2.819">this event here being all these people</text>
  <text start="374.03" dur="3.33">is part of that proof of concepts you</text>
  <text start="375.289" dur="4.921">know exactly tell me about your thoughts</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="5.25">on disclosure too because that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="4.079">you know why we&amp;#39;re all here that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="3.36">huge topic many people are interested in</text>
  <text start="384.289" dur="2.94">right I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s the event</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s disclosure that there&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="7.261">lot of stuff coming so I guess what I</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="7.109">want to ask you is what is your I mean</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="3.84">we hate speculating the future the</text>
  <text start="397.099" dur="2.851">people who were wrong and throw dates</text>
  <text start="398.33" dur="3.84">out there catching a lot of heat for it</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="4.14">but I mean in a purely hypothetical</text>
  <text start="402.17" dur="3.21">world no one&amp;#39;s gonna get mad at you for</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="3.36">putting your timeline out there what do</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="5.43">you see what do you see in the next one</text>
  <text start="407.45" dur="6.18">you what I feel intuitive intuitively is</text>
  <text start="410.81" dur="4.71">that there is like a crescendo happening</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="3.69">so we&amp;#39;ve kind of been on this like slow</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="3.96">curve and now we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="3.96">arc of the curve like trend up yeah and</text>
  <text start="419.48" dur="3.21">really kind of fit hit a fever pitch and</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="3.96">the fact that there&amp;#39;s so many people</text>
  <text start="422.69" dur="4.95">interested in these type of topics I</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="4.86">mean the pizza gate topic even though</text>
  <text start="427.64" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s kind of a hot-button issue the fact</text>
  <text start="430.1" dur="3.81">that so many people are interested in it</text>
  <text start="431.54" dur="3.99">it was is amazing you know and it&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="433.91" dur="3.72">one of these really difficult topics to</text>
  <text start="435.53" dur="4.56">wrap your head around so I think that</text>
  <text start="437.63" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re getting to the point where this</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="4.5">the push for disclosure which is much</text>
  <text start="442.73" dur="3.84">more than just about UFOs and</text>
  <text start="444.59" dur="4.08">extraterrestrials is really hitting a</text>
  <text start="446.57" dur="4.71">fever pitch and you know we as</text>
  <text start="448.67" dur="4.32">presenters all we can do is offer the</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="3.06">information that&amp;#39;s up to somebody else</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="3.3">to take it and run with it yeah how</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="3.45">people actually it seems like more and</text>
  <text start="456.29" dur="1.71">more people are taking it running with</text>
  <text start="457.79" dur="1.95">it</text>
  <text start="458" dur="4.22">digesting it and then they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="4.98">presenters and they&amp;#39;re doing it yeah</text>
  <text start="462.22" dur="4.51">we&amp;#39;re getting so much information out</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="4.05">there whether it&amp;#39;s leaked by people</text>
  <text start="466.73" dur="4.98">within three-letter agencies themselves</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="4.35">or other whistleblowers or just</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="3.45">researchers there&amp;#39;s so much information</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="4.05">coming out and so many people getting to</text>
  <text start="475.16" dur="3.3">a point where they&amp;#39;re realizing the</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="3.12">stick and they&amp;#39;re searching for that</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="3.78">information so like you said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="4.14">getting exponential in that oh yeah that</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="4.92">critical mass is getting faster and</text>
  <text start="484.43" dur="4.26">faster and faster yep exactly I mean</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="4.04">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things happening behind</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="5.4">the scenes too in it I&amp;#39;ve heard from a</text>
  <text start="491.2" dur="6.25">colleague of mine that the the Cabal</text>
  <text start="494.09" dur="5.16">they use various methods specifically</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="3.24">for like contact and discard identities</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="4.68">to get like advice from the other side</text>
  <text start="500.69" dur="4.83">and apparently since 2012 or maybe even</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="3.03">a little bit before they&amp;#39;ve had not had</text>
  <text start="505.52" dur="3.15">the ability to make contact with the</text>
  <text start="506.96" dur="3.15">other side part of the reason why is</text>
  <text start="508.67" dur="3.03">that they haven&amp;#39;t been following these</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="3">cosmic laws that they needed to follow</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="3.149">to keep their plan</text>
  <text start="513.11" dur="4.02">yeah and running so now we&amp;#39;re kind of at</text>
  <text start="514.849" dur="4.201">this point where it&amp;#39;s very chaotic but</text>
  <text start="517.13" dur="4.95">within that chaos people who are willing</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="4.38">to be the order makers can go in and</text>
  <text start="522.08" dur="2.7">start making order and I feel like you</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="3.51">know that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="3.84">Corey David Wilcock all these people are</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="3.54">trying yeah it&amp;#39;s almost those because I</text>
  <text start="528.62" dur="3.66">mean around the twenty twelve timeframe</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="3.15">there was so many different peoples in</text>
  <text start="532.28" dur="2.79">their theories having a</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="4.52">convergence right then whether it was</text>
  <text start="535.07" dur="6.18">Terence Mckenna in his time wave zero or</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="5.05">what was a project looking-glass yes the</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="3.54">CIA program where they were trying to</text>
  <text start="543.2" dur="3.63">use human consciousness to look into the</text>
  <text start="544.79" dur="3.42">future they would hit a wall they would</text>
  <text start="546.83" dur="3.09">they would be able to view anything up</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="3.51">until 2012 and then once they get past</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="3.29">2012 it was just like they couldn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="551.72" dur="5.49">couldn&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="553.21" dur="5.41">many other things sir happy for ended</text>
  <text start="557.21" dur="3.93">around 2012 many people&amp;#39;s philosophies</text>
  <text start="558.62" dur="4.92">so and you know that one of the things</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="4.56">that the 2012 event did for disclosure</text>
  <text start="563.54" dur="3.84">is it brought all this out in a positive</text>
  <text start="565.7" dur="3.96">way because people were really wanting</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="4.11">you know the shift and the ascension but</text>
  <text start="569.66" dur="3.81">then when that floor dropped out we were</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="3.57">kind of in this chaos period yeah but</text>
  <text start="573.47" dur="3.81">now we&amp;#39;re going back into a season of</text>
  <text start="575.06" dur="7.38">like you know order a season of like</text>
  <text start="577.28" dur="9.12">people coming together yeah also I mean</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="5.42">you said like the universe is you said</text>
  <text start="586.4" dur="3.93">some of the effect that the universe is</text>
  <text start="587.86" dur="4.12">people who are choosing it the universe</text>
  <text start="590.33" dur="4.02">is giving them that opportunity to do so</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="3.63">mm-hmm so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s as if something I</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="2.82">said earlier like the unity and the</text>
  <text start="595.61" dur="3.48">community thing you can tell people in</text>
  <text start="597.17" dur="3.78">the in who are for unity are coming</text>
  <text start="599.09" dur="3.63">together since almost as if all the</text>
  <text start="600.95" dur="4.65">synchronicity and those you know</text>
  <text start="602.72" dur="4.8">wonderful cosmic laws are bringing</text>
  <text start="605.6" dur="5.19">people together specifically because</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="5.55">they chose it yes so exactly and that</text>
  <text start="610.79" dur="3.45">choice I mean it&amp;#39;s easy to say hey let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.07" dur="2.58">all unite to do something but we</text>
  <text start="614.24" dur="3.18">actually start to working with people</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="3.21">all of these differences you didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="617.42" dur="2.76">we&amp;#39;re there come on the surface and then</text>
  <text start="618.86" dur="3">you have to work through those knowledge</text>
  <text start="620.18" dur="3.87">is cool but once you start putting it</text>
  <text start="621.86" dur="5.55">into action that&amp;#39;s when you that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="624.05" dur="5.76">you test you exactly exactly so yeah</text>
  <text start="627.41" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s really exciting to see like we were</text>
  <text start="629.81" dur="2.46">walking through it was hearing you know</text>
  <text start="631.13" dur="3.51">people were obviously interested in the</text>
  <text start="632.27" dur="4.26">UFO et side of the story but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.64" dur="4.14">also interested in what they can do to</text>
  <text start="636.53" dur="3.87">add their energy to the picture so many</text>
  <text start="638.78" dur="3.69">people are wanting to do something else</text>
  <text start="640.4" dur="3.81">I mean the pots bubbling so people are</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;ve known about all this stuff for</text>
  <text start="644.21" dur="3.21">twenty thirty years but maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.07" dur="5.15">almost the fresh faces are coming in</text>
  <text start="647.42" dur="6.21">we&amp;#39;re the ones that aren&amp;#39;t cynical yet</text>
  <text start="651.22" dur="4.03">we&amp;#39;re coming in and we&amp;#39;re we have the</text>
  <text start="653.63" dur="3.51">energy to actually do something and</text>
  <text start="655.25" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s catalyzing all the old people who</text>
  <text start="657.14" dur="3.33">have been kind of sitting on their ass</text>
  <text start="658.4" dur="3.39">for a while they&amp;#39;re like oh man these</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="2.25">young guns are coming in I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="661.79" dur="2.22">get left behind so it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="662.72" dur="3.63">catalyzing everything</text>
  <text start="664.01" dur="4.28">cool to see oh that&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="5.01">melting pot I mean I was talking to a</text>
  <text start="668.29" dur="5.05">one woman she I&amp;#39;m trying to remember her</text>
  <text start="671.36" dur="4.41">story but she had like drove here from</text>
  <text start="673.34" dur="4.23">across the country and she just felt</text>
  <text start="675.77" dur="3.6">this call to come because she knew that</text>
  <text start="677.57" dur="3.27">she needed to start doing something and</text>
  <text start="679.37" dur="2.85">then I was starting to talk to her about</text>
  <text start="680.84" dur="3">you know some of the projects I have and</text>
  <text start="682.22" dur="3.18">you know working trying to figure out a</text>
  <text start="683.84" dur="3.33">way for people to come together because</text>
  <text start="685.4" dur="3.45">one of the thing that&amp;#39;s is so amazing</text>
  <text start="687.17" dur="4.05">about these events is the energy to do</text>
  <text start="688.85" dur="4.2">stuff is just huge yeah but then we all</text>
  <text start="691.22" dur="3.39">go our separate ways like and go back</text>
  <text start="693.05" dur="3.12">into our little worlds but what if there</text>
  <text start="694.61" dur="3.54">was a way for us to work together so</text>
  <text start="696.17" dur="4.56">that we could all support each other in</text>
  <text start="698.15" dur="4.35">that process of growing up into becoming</text>
  <text start="700.73" dur="4.02">a really awesome like world healer and</text>
  <text start="702.5" dur="3.57">activist you know and it&amp;#39;s so difficult</text>
  <text start="704.75" dur="3.09">so many people are kind of living double</text>
  <text start="706.07" dur="3.3">lives yes we&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re you know they</text>
  <text start="707.84" dur="3.45">have their job for the man but then they</text>
  <text start="709.37" dur="3.54">have to go home and then take that mask</text>
  <text start="711.29" dur="5.19">off and then they get on the internet</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="5.64">start researching oh it&amp;#39;s I mean a lot</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="5.33">of people are beginning to realize what</text>
  <text start="718.55" dur="6.54">their passion is and find ways to either</text>
  <text start="721.81" dur="5.53">a make their passion their paycheck and</text>
  <text start="725.09" dur="4.29">totally you know quit their jobs and do</text>
  <text start="727.34" dur="3.75">that but if they can&amp;#39;t do that people</text>
  <text start="729.38" dur="3.87">are having the courage to come out of</text>
  <text start="731.09" dur="4.62">that double life and actually you know</text>
  <text start="733.25" dur="4.14">speak to their co-workers and speak to</text>
  <text start="735.71" dur="3.66">their friends and family about these</text>
  <text start="737.39" dur="4.02">issues which is exactly what needs to</text>
  <text start="739.37" dur="6">happen we need to all have that coming</text>
  <text start="741.41" dur="5.25">out of the what cosmic closet people</text>
  <text start="745.37" dur="3.93">coming out of the cosmic closet and like</text>
  <text start="746.66" dur="4.5">hey what&amp;#39;s this Awakening about or</text>
  <text start="749.3" dur="3.51">what&amp;#39;s this you know right that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="751.16" dur="3">needs to happen and people you know we</text>
  <text start="752.81" dur="2.88">need to have the courage to speak about</text>
  <text start="754.16" dur="3.54">these things cuz that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="755.69" dur="4.38">all it is they were there oh yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="757.7" dur="3.69">one one idea I had about like building</text>
  <text start="760.07" dur="4.29">the unity in the community thing and</text>
  <text start="761.39" dur="12.96">actually got this from Derek burrows who</text>
  <text start="764.36" dur="14.19">writes for uh he was talking about this</text>
  <text start="774.35" dur="5.49">concept called freedom cells and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="778.55" dur="3.15">really interesting basically what it is</text>
  <text start="779.84" dur="3.9">is that you find two or three people</text>
  <text start="781.7" dur="4.38">ideally some in your local neighborhood</text>
  <text start="783.74" dur="4.92">but if not that&amp;#39;s okay and what you do</text>
  <text start="786.08" dur="4.2">is you work you help each other work on</text>
  <text start="788.66" dur="2.97">your either your personal issues or</text>
  <text start="790.28" dur="3.27">projects that you have so if like you</text>
  <text start="791.63" dur="4.29">want to learn about how do I do organic</text>
  <text start="793.55" dur="3.75">farming we all get together we support</text>
  <text start="795.92" dur="2.05">each other in that learning process then</text>
  <text start="797.3" dur="3.039">we actually</text>
  <text start="797.97" dur="4.5">do organic farming and then you got to</text>
  <text start="800.339" dur="3.781">do it exactly things to have the power</text>
  <text start="802.47" dur="3.51">is that Ralph Waldo Emerson would say</text>
  <text start="804.12" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s the biggest thing exactly and</text>
  <text start="805.98" dur="3.599">then once you get that done then you</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="3.51">shift and then you help us with somebody</text>
  <text start="809.579" dur="4.021">else&amp;#39;s project so with this rotational</text>
  <text start="811.56" dur="3.449">support system that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="813.6" dur="3.06">because that makes me think of the law</text>
  <text start="815.009" dur="3.39">of one when they say we&amp;#39;re all here to</text>
  <text start="816.66" dur="3.719">teach and learn at the same time if</text>
  <text start="818.399" dur="4.351">you&amp;#39;re not doing both of those you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="820.379" dur="4.08">not you know doing the right job and</text>
  <text start="822.75" dur="2.819">that&amp;#39;s that brings that because in the</text>
  <text start="824.459" dur="2.701">picture cuz you&amp;#39;re learning how then</text>
  <text start="825.569" dur="3.841">you&amp;#39;re teaching and you really I mean</text>
  <text start="827.16" dur="3.57">you could learn how to do something but</text>
  <text start="829.41" dur="3.06">if you don&amp;#39;t teach it you don&amp;#39;t master</text>
  <text start="830.73" dur="3.75">it exactly there&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="832.47" dur="4.559">happens psychologically in the process</text>
  <text start="834.48" dur="4.109">of verbalizing that knowledge so it uses</text>
  <text start="837.029" dur="3.451">your linguistic and articulate of</text>
  <text start="838.589" dur="3.571">processes in your brain you become more</text>
  <text start="840.48" dur="2.52">you get like a new perspective on</text>
  <text start="842.16" dur="3.39">something you already know and it</text>
  <text start="843" dur="4.11">becomes more refined for you so uh so</text>
  <text start="845.55" dur="3.81">yeah this Agora isn&amp;#39;t this freedom sell</text>
  <text start="847.11" dur="3.269">model I mean that&amp;#39;s kind of like what</text>
  <text start="849.36" dur="2.279">we&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re working with each</text>
  <text start="850.379" dur="3.091">other I&amp;#39;m supporting you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="851.639" dur="3.99">supporting me are both of us are coming</text>
  <text start="853.47" dur="4.02">up together and then because of that now</text>
  <text start="855.629" dur="3.781">we have abundance that we can do to</text>
  <text start="857.49" dur="3.12">spread around everybody else and yeah</text>
  <text start="859.41" dur="3.69">just think about it like can you imagine</text>
  <text start="860.61" dur="4.019">a network of like ten people come to you</text>
  <text start="863.1" dur="3.15">and say hey listen you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="864.629" dur="3.63">something really cool we&amp;#39;re gonna find a</text>
  <text start="866.25" dur="3.209">way to support you help you get it even</text>
  <text start="868.259" dur="2.911">better and then make it so that it</text>
  <text start="869.459" dur="3.24">actually sustains you so then you can</text>
  <text start="871.17" dur="2.969">get yourself even more to it and then</text>
  <text start="872.699" dur="2.671">when that person grows and grows and</text>
  <text start="874.139" dur="2.76">grows and they start coming into their</text>
  <text start="875.37" dur="3.12">own creative powers then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="876.899" dur="3.721">teaching the people who help bring them</text>
  <text start="878.49" dur="4.17">up I send this guy articles all the time</text>
  <text start="880.62" dur="4.079">oh yeah check this out he&amp;#39;s like this is</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="4.02">awesome man oh you see he&amp;#39;s sending me</text>
  <text start="884.699" dur="3.781">stuff all the time and tidbits of advice</text>
  <text start="886.68" dur="3.12">and all kinds of stuff so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="888.48" dur="3.029">you need to do the whole teach learn</text>
  <text start="889.8" dur="3.3">process enterprise it&amp;#39;s really and it</text>
  <text start="891.509" dur="3.481">requires humility it requires the</text>
  <text start="893.1" dur="5.7">ability to be like you know what I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="894.99" dur="5.49">know what yeah seriously as much as I</text>
  <text start="898.8" dur="2.909">have sighted all this stuff there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="900.48" dur="2.43">these insights I can get and you know</text>
  <text start="901.709" dur="2.73">that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I like your</text>
  <text start="902.91" dur="2.669">work is that you helped me get a</text>
  <text start="904.439" dur="3.601">different perspective on the stuff that</text>
  <text start="905.579" dur="4.351">I&amp;#39;ve been knowing a nicer person yeah</text>
  <text start="908.04" dur="3.719">let&amp;#39;s now let&amp;#39;s take that model and</text>
  <text start="909.93" dur="3.48">let&amp;#39;s spread it everywhere yeah and your</text>
  <text start="911.759" dur="3.39">work has always been giving people a</text>
  <text start="913.41" dur="3.779">whole perspective on each issue but</text>
  <text start="915.149" dur="4.29">really the biggest the most important</text>
  <text start="917.189" dur="4.801">thing is that you always play devil&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.439" dur="4.14">advocate with the situation if it</text>
  <text start="921.99" dur="2.76">warrants it I mean not every situation</text>
  <text start="923.579" dur="2.671">needs a devil&amp;#39;s advocate because</text>
  <text start="924.75" dur="3.6">sometimes the truth is overwhelming but</text>
  <text start="926.25" dur="4.35">if it&amp;#39;s if you&amp;#39;re trying to discern an</text>
  <text start="928.35" dur="3.419">issue you always say like hey it could</text>
  <text start="930.6" dur="3.51">be you you post</text>
  <text start="931.769" dur="4.081">everybody&amp;#39;s work whether it may or may</text>
  <text start="934.11" dur="3.12">not you may or may not agree with it but</text>
  <text start="935.85" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s always in the truth-seeking process</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="4.229">right so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="939.3" dur="4.229">crucial because nobody wants to humble</text>
