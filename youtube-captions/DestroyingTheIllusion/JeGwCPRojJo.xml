  <text start="37.829" dur="5.16">seeing an article on the website</text>

  <text start="42.989" dur="5.671">discussing how a former CIA officer was</text>

  <text start="48.66" dur="4.53">call the deep state for false flags and</text>
  <text start="51.18" dur="4.469">was basically saying that many mass</text>
  <text start="53.19" dur="4.86">shootings and tragedies that go on are</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="5.311">false flag attacks and this definitely</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="5.91">piqued my interest and I kept a keen eye</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="5.13">on the name Robert David Steele in this</text>

  <text start="130.24" dur="4.23">this is jordyn state here here and today</text>
  <text start="131.8" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;m joined by one Robert David Steele</text>
  <text start="134.47" dur="3.66">he&amp;#39;s the chief abling officer of the</text>
  <text start="136.57" dur="3.6">earth intelligence network and has</text>
  <text start="138.13" dur="4.08">devoted to open source everything</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="3.21">he&amp;#39;s a former CIA clandestine service</text>
  <text start="142.21" dur="3.3">officer and was the second</text>
  <text start="143.38" dur="3.63">highest-ranking civilian in the US</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="3.69">Marine Intelligence Service</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="4.74">he&amp;#39;s a former spy nominated for the</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="4.74">Nobel Peace Prize for the 2017 cycle for</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="4.29">his work into honest intelligence and we</text>
  <text start="153.94" dur="3.63">are here to discuss robert&amp;#39;s efforts in</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="3.87">building a new paradigm on our planet</text>
  <text start="157.57" dur="4.65">and he&amp;#39;s uh actually has an interesting</text>
  <text start="159.91" dur="4.53">campaign that he&amp;#39;s called his unwritten</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="4.14">he&amp;#39;s doing with former Congresswoman</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="4.23">cynthia mckinney and tell us about it</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="6.06">Robert well it&amp;#39;s a very simple</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="6.45">proposition because I I&amp;#39;m one of these</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="5.58">half-breeds on both alt-right and vaults</text>
  <text start="175.12" dur="5.4">left and I realized that all my all left</text>
  <text start="178" dur="4.53">colleagues don&amp;#39;t get that Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="180.52" dur="4.65">is a chance to take down the deep state</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="6.27">so I was working with Cynthia McKinney</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="6.93">since 2009 when we met and we realized</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="5.79">that pound sign unrig was ready to take</text>
  <text start="192.1" dur="4.71">off and we realized that we needed to</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="4.8">help everyone understand that the deep</text>
  <text start="196.81" dur="4.53">state is our common enemy and if the</text>
  <text start="199.39" dur="4.5">enemy of my enemy is my friend</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="4.83">and if Donald Trump is the enemy of the</text>
  <text start="203.89" dur="4.68">deep state which I think he is then</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s an opportunity here for all of</text>
  <text start="208.57" dur="5.61">us to come together so Cynthia and I</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="6.24">have published a manifesto called pound</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="6.15">sign unread beyond Trump and Sanders and</text>
  <text start="217.54" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re hoping that the churches she is</text>
  <text start="220.33" dur="3.72">reaching out to the black churches I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="3.9">reaching out to the white churches we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.05" dur="4.86">trying to get the churches to host open</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="5.25">houses in June for the alt-right</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="4.14">the alt left people of color Latinos</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="5.25">small parties and independents to come</text>
  <text start="233.05" dur="6.3">together and if they agree that the deep</text>
  <text start="236.53" dur="4.89">state is our common enemy and if they</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="4.56">agree that the election Reform Act that</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="4.4">I&amp;#39;ve a grenaded from hundreds of people</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="5.22">who have been thinking about this for</text>
  <text start="245.82" dur="4.72">many many years if they agree that that</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="2.82">is the solution</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="4.199">putting integrity back into our</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="5.009">government then in July Cynthia and I</text>
  <text start="254.739" dur="2.791">are suggesting to all citizens that they</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="3.331">sell for</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="4.98">organize and that they occupy the front</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="4.44">lawns and home offices of every member</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="5.03">of Congress in the month of July until</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="6.39">each member signs the integrity pledge</text>
  <text start="267.54" dur="6.61">committing to co-sponsoring and passing</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="6.09">the election reform act of 2017 in</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="5.79">September now I am meeting with Rand</text>
  <text start="277.21" dur="6.03">Paul&amp;#39;s political director today or</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="6.18">tomorrow and we are asking Senator Rand</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="5.31">Paul to introduce this act before the</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="4.92">summer recess even if he only reads it</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="4.71">into the congressional record that will</text>
  <text start="291.04" dur="4.47">be the line in the sand between we the</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="5.159">people in the deep state we are also</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="5.87">asking Donald Trump to take the</text>
  <text start="298.419" dur="5.311">leadership role here I am vision Trump</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="3.7">barnstorming across the nation part of</text>
  <text start="303.73" dur="3.09">the promise of Trump&amp;#39;s trying to beat</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="4.56">the deep state using their rules on</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="5.24">their Court Washington DC that&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="309.64" dur="5.64">winning proposition if Trump were to</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.8">sponsor the election reform act change</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="5.25">the rules of the game and then lead a</text>

  <text start="331.33" dur="5.79">better we can get america the beautiful&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="333.55" dur="7.08">back and you&amp;#39;ve written memos to the</text>

  <text start="354.46" dur="4.62">president 3.0 and they&amp;#39;ll get right to</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="4.199">the version that Cynthia McKinney</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="5.81">refined which is my work but refined by</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="5.161">her we give the president eight specific</text>
  <text start="364.89" dur="4.3">suggestions for being the greatest</text>
  <text start="366.7" dur="5.1">president ever and Cynthia McKinney has</text>
  <text start="369.19" dur="5.58">told me that she believes a two-thirds</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="5.22">of the black citizens in the United</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="4.41">States of America are ready to leave the</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="4.35">Democratic Party of support Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="4.23">but he has to deliver some tangible</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="4.95">policy advantages through them and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="383.41" dur="5.64">not seeing that happen and you why are</text>
  <text start="386.32" dur="4.74">we seeing that happen that&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="2.5">good question Jordan now I&amp;#39;m not sure I</text>
  <text start="391.06" dur="2.17">know</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="5.43">the president has read all three</text>
  <text start="393.23" dur="7.17">memorandums um what I&amp;#39;m being told is</text>
  <text start="396.98" dur="6.3">that people around him are telling him</text>
  <text start="400.4" dur="6.93">that Cynthia McKinney is a communist and</text>
  <text start="403.28" dur="6.63">people like Rand Paul are you know his</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="5.04">competition I don&amp;#39;t see it that way</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="5.13">Donald Trump is our legitimately elected</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="6.03">president and he is president of all</text>
  <text start="415.04" dur="7.28">American citizens I believe he should be</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="6.45">reaching out to everybody one of my my</text>
  <text start="422.32" dur="4.87">advocates who speaks directly to the</text>
  <text start="424.85" dur="3.27">president once a week said the president</text>
  <text start="427.19" dur="2.85">said what&amp;#39;s the difference between</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="4.56">Steele and the guys I have around me now</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="3.99">and my advocate said very clearly and I</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="3.12">love how he said this he said mr.</text>
  <text start="434.03" dur="3.99">president everyone around you is trying</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="4.05">to shut the rest of the world out Steele</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="3.32">is the only guy trying to bring the rest</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="3.45">of the world to your feet</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="4.21">wonderful way to put it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="4.47">absolutely correct I am NOT Reince</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="6.69">Priebus Mike Pence or even Steve Bennett</text>
  <text start="447.77" dur="6.24">I&amp;#39;m everybody else you&amp;#39;re for open</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="4.02">sourcing and holistic analysis which I</text>
  <text start="454.01" dur="5.34">really appreciate because it&amp;#39;s a cost</text>
  <text start="456.26" dur="4.38">economics absolutely and it seems like</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="2.61">so many people around the president are</text>
  <text start="460.64" dur="3.33">trying to compartmentalize certain</text>
  <text start="461.96" dur="4.32">information for their own game so who</text>
  <text start="463.97" dur="4.32">knows well let me be very clear here the</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="4.32">president is being lied to on a daily</text>
  <text start="468.29" dur="6">basis by Herbert McMaster and Reince</text>
  <text start="470.6" dur="6.39">Priebus among others McMaster is</text>
  <text start="474.29" dur="6.39">actually a traitor I have it from a</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="5.79">really solid source that McMaster Koch</text>
  <text start="480.68" dur="5.19">conspired with John McCain David</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="5.88">Petraeus and John Brennan to get the</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="4.65">Saudis and the Israelis to fund the</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="3.75">white helmets to do the false flag in</text>
  <text start="490.52" dur="4.62">Syria and by the way I&amp;#39;m pretty sure</text>
  <text start="492.41" dur="5.58">Manchester was a false flag also people</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="5.88">may die but the whole provenance of that</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="4.95">event is false it&amp;#39;s intended to keep me</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="4.44">in power and deprive Corbin and the</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="7.98">United Kingdom independent party from</text>
  <text start="505.46" dur="7.62">gaining aa in in England mm-hmm McMaster</text>
  <text start="510.92" dur="4.2">is trying to put a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="4.95">thousand US ground troops in this area</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="5.4">this is insanity and Kushner is trying</text>
  <text start="518.03" dur="6.24">to give the Saudis nuclear weapons this</text>
  <text start="520.52" dur="4.86">is insanity um so I I did my second</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="2.94">graduate thesis on</text>
  <text start="525.38" dur="6.06">much information actually reaches the</text>
  <text start="527.21" dur="6.21">White House and bottom line 2% based on</text>
  <text start="531.44" dur="3.69">how we collect and how we filter in all</text>
  <text start="533.42" dur="4.32">of this and Benji Light has said in</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="4.05">business blind spots that most of the</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="3.72">information that reaches a chief</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="5.94">executive such as Donald Trump his</text>
  <text start="541.46" dur="5.67">filtered biased late or raw that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.12" dur="3.81">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s information world which</text>
  <text start="547.13" dur="3.93">is why in addition to recommending an</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="4.11">election Reform Act we&amp;#39;re telling him he</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="2.52">needs an open source agency in a trump</text>
  <text start="553.04" dur="2.37">channel</text>
  <text start="553.58" dur="4.65">he needs a counterintelligence surge</text>
  <text start="555.41" dur="5.22">he&amp;#39;s got 500 traders across this this</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="6.21">government and William Binney is ready</text>
  <text start="560.63" dur="6.75">to help him identify all of them using</text>
  <text start="564.44" dur="4.83">the data that NSA has not processed the</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="4.71">dirty little secret about NSA is it only</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="6.36">processes 1% of what it collects in</text>
  <text start="572.09" dur="6.06">NSA&amp;#39;s databases are every email and</text>
  <text start="575.63" dur="4.52">phone call made by every elite pedophile</text>
  <text start="578.15" dur="6.02">and every traitor in the last 10 years</text>
  <text start="580.15" dur="6.1">and built-in he knows how to go get it</text>
  <text start="584.17" dur="5.41">isn&amp;#39;t that how we take down the deep</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="6.05">state then it could be I have a</text>
  <text start="589.58" dur="4.98">correspondence out to President Putin</text>
  <text start="592.3" dur="3.79">suggesting that he approached Trump</text>
  <text start="594.56" dur="3.93">since I&amp;#39;m being blocked from approaching</text>
  <text start="596.09" dur="5.04">Trump but he approached Trump and</text>
  <text start="598.49" dur="6.12">proposed a joint counterintelligence</text>

  <text start="857.99" dur="4.67">I&amp;#39;ve learned about the evils of CIA and</text>
  <text start="860.18" dur="4.62">NSA I learned after I left the CIA</text>
  <text start="862.66" dur="4.21">ninety percent of the people that work</text>

  <text start="866.87" dur="4.86">are good people trapped in a bad system</text>

  <text start="871.73" dur="7.08">people trapped in a bad system what has</text>
  <text start="875.15" dur="8.7">happened it turns out is that CIA NSA</text>
  <text start="878.81" dur="5.97">and the FBI a Coll COINTELPRO or</text>
  <text start="883.85" dur="2.67">whatever it was</text>
  <text start="884.78" dur="4.83">Seibel Edmonds has just put out an</text>
  <text start="886.52" dur="5.97">excellent piece on how the FBI was</text>
  <text start="889.61" dur="5.7">tasked with luring politicians and</text>
  <text start="892.49" dur="5.1">judges into compromising situations</text>
  <text start="895.31" dur="4.26">including situations with children you</text>
  <text start="897.59" dur="4.38">have to remember the FBI was founded by</text>
  <text start="899.57" dur="4.32">a pedo file j edgar Hoover was a</text>
  <text start="901.97" dur="5.22">pedophile he accepted small children</text>
  <text start="903.89" dur="4.65">from the Mafia as gifts okay and Allen</text>
  <text start="907.19" dur="2.91">Dulles may or may not have been a</text>
  <text start="908.54" dur="4.11">pedophile but he&amp;#39;s one of the most evil</text>
  <text start="910.1" dur="4.41">men in American history and he was</text>
  <text start="912.65" dur="4.91">working for Wall Street the CIA was</text>
  <text start="914.51" dur="5.52">created by Wall Street for Wall Street</text>
  <text start="917.56" dur="5.4">so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="920.03" dur="5.19">basically using the NSA intercepts to</text>
  <text start="922.96" dur="5.109">surveil politicians and</text>
  <text start="925.22" dur="4.979">judges and they&amp;#39;re also using standard</text>

  <text start="937.22" dur="5.01">with this challenge described it to me</text>
  <text start="939.98" dur="4.229">you could get a congressman drunk and</text>
  <text start="942.23" dur="5.159">get him to go to bed with a thirty year</text>

  <text start="949.279" dur="4.16">mind-altering drugs and then she</text>
  <text start="951.23" dur="5.7">switches out with a twelve-year-old and</text>
  <text start="953.439" dur="5.411">they get the congressman filmed even if</text>
  <text start="956.93" dur="4.29">the congressman is not a pedophile to</text>
  <text start="958.85" dur="5.159">begin with they get the congressman on</text>
  <text start="961.22" dur="4.679">film having sex with a twelve-year-old</text>
  <text start="964.009" dur="4.921">girl and perhaps even murdering the</text>
  <text start="965.899" dur="5.641">twelve-year-old girl after that most</text>
  <text start="968.93" dur="5.04">people think they&amp;#39;re trapped and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="971.54" dur="4.14">one of the reasons why in my third</text>
  <text start="973.97" dur="3.929">recommendation of President Trump the</text>
  <text start="975.68" dur="3.839">counterintelligence recommendation not</text>

  <text start="994.639" dur="5.791">for and what we get in return is the</text>
  <text start="998.3" dur="5.13">identity of the blackmailers and then we</text>
  <text start="1000.43" dur="4.62">go hang the blackmailers the</text>
  <text start="1003.43" dur="4.23">blackmailers verses the blackmail</text>
  <text start="1005.05" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;ll be a crucial discussing through</text>

  <text start="1014.8" dur="7.68">don&amp;#39;t you want a commission looking into</text>
  <text start="1016.99" dur="7.74">the pedophile issue I am Sasha stone of</text>
  <text start="1022.48" dur="4.199">who many thought has asked me to be a</text>

  <text start="1034.539" dur="4.111">and the military and one of the things I</text>
  <text start="1036.61" dur="4.29">tell people is we need to close all</text>
  <text start="1038.65" dur="4.049">thousand military bases around the world</text>
  <text start="1040.9" dur="4.139">because they&amp;#39;re not there for military</text>
  <text start="1042.699" dur="5.311">power projection they are there so that</text>
  <text start="1045.039" dur="5.971">CIA has a lilypad through which to</text>
  <text start="1048.01" dur="6.63">smuggle gold guns cash drugs and small</text>
  <text start="1051.01" dur="7.02">children for the elite these military</text>
  <text start="1054.64" dur="4.27">bases are a cancerous scar and humanity</text>
  <text start="1058.03" dur="2.71">they need to go</text>
  <text start="1058.91" dur="3.3">we need to bring our military home we</text>
  <text start="1060.74" dur="3.42">need a strong military but it needs to</text>
  <text start="1062.21" dur="4.29">be a home-based military focused on</text>
  <text start="1064.16" dur="4.71">defense not elective wars and regime</text>
  <text start="1066.5" dur="3.99">change and so forth so this commission</text>
  <text start="1068.87" dur="4.01">is going to spend a year and it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="1070.49" dur="4.38">of a Hollywood Commission than it is a</text>
  <text start="1072.88" dur="4.06">Justice Commission for instance I just</text>
  <text start="1074.87" dur="4.17">flow out to Bangkok and shot a</text>
  <text start="1076.94" dur="6.06">documentary with Steven Seagal who by</text>
  <text start="1079.04" dur="6">the way is not just an action celebrity</text>

  <text start="1088.01" dur="5.37">roots including Mohawk roots this is a</text>
  <text start="1090.41" dur="5.04">real interesting person and we shot a</text>

  <text start="1095.45" dur="4.65">Achilles heel of the deep state and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1097.67" dur="5.25">so good that it may go to the Khans Film</text>

  <text start="1106.04" dur="3.75">that works out I see the ones who were</text>
  <text start="1108.32" dur="2.64">ruffling in their chairs and that might</text>
  <text start="1109.79" dur="3.27">be who you find out with the</text>
  <text start="1110.96" dur="4.71">blackmailers and the black marathon yeah</text>
  <text start="1113.06" dur="4.65">you know celebrities celebrities are the</text>
  <text start="1115.67" dur="4.41">best of the servant class as well and I</text>
  <text start="1117.71" dur="4.56">speak not of Steven Seagal but of so in</text>
  <text start="1120.08" dur="4.41">fact he avoided he avoided being</text>
  <text start="1122.27" dur="4.35">entrapped and that&amp;#39;s not a story I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1124.49" dur="5.19">going to tell here but Steven Seagal is</text>
  <text start="1126.62" dur="5.37">an acutely intelligent man and he detect</text>
  <text start="1129.68" dur="4.53">at the beginning of an entrapment on him</text>
  <text start="1131.99" dur="3.36">and he was able to get himself out of it</text>
  <text start="1134.21" dur="4.5">and I praise God for that</text>
  <text start="1135.35" dur="6.63">because so many of these celebrities are</text>
  <text start="1138.71" dur="6.36">using satanic symbols and are basically</text>
  <text start="1141.98" dur="5.16">into pedophilia into child snuffing into</text>
  <text start="1145.07" dur="4.23">drinking blood and they think it makes</text>
  <text start="1147.14" dur="4.11">them something special when in fact</text>
  <text start="1149.3" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re merely you know war criminals</text>
  <text start="1151.25" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really sad but we can</text>
  <text start="1153.2" dur="4.7">clean this country up there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1154.97" dur="6.84">question about it we can clean this out</text>
  <text start="1157.9" dur="5.77">you can a lot of people have recently</text>
  <text start="1161.81" dur="3.12">lately because of the Seth Roush</text>

  <text start="1174.32" dur="4.68">in that situation I&amp;#39;m not so sure see</text>
  <text start="1177.41" dur="3.84">part of the problem is a trump in</text>

  <text start="1410.539" dur="4.77">one of the things that I would like to</text>
  <text start="1412.49" dur="5.1">see Putin and Trump discuss is the</text>

  <text start="1417.59" dur="4.36">everywhere</text>
  <text start="1419.37" dur="5.1">we need to start nationalizing the</text>

  <text start="1435" dur="2.61">want the Rothschilds to have an exit</text>

  <text start="1450.66" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s any type of technologies that</text>
  <text start="1452.94" dur="5.22">may be hidden or suppressed that could</text>
  <text start="1455.85" dur="3.87">be very welcoming our way as well well</text>
  <text start="1458.16" dur="3.57">let me answer that at two levels number</text>
  <text start="1459.72" dur="3.84">one I&amp;#39;m very excited by Russia</text>
  <text start="1461.73" dur="3.63">apparently Vladimir Putin is really</text>
  <text start="1463.56" dur="3.69">taken with blockchain and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1465.36" dur="3.75">understanding how much blockchain</text>
  <text start="1467.25" dur="3.84">blockchain is relevant not just a</text>
  <text start="1469.11" dur="5.07">software in cash but to everything I</text>
  <text start="1471.09" dur="5.43">mean blockchain makes it sounds it</text>
  <text start="1474.18" dur="4.89">sounds counterintuitive but the privacy</text>
  <text start="1476.52" dur="4.79">and inability to censor blockchain</text>
  <text start="1479.07" dur="5.46">actually makes everything transparent</text>
  <text start="1481.31" dur="5.98">and I remember Eric Hughes at hackers</text>
  <text start="1484.53" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;m an honorary hacker at hackers back</text>
  <text start="1487.29" dur="4.29">in 1994 he talked about anonymous</text>

  <text start="1496.62" dur="6.72">going to be huge the other thing is open</text>

  <text start="1558.84" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s no comparison um and one of the</text>
  <text start="1561.39" dur="3.72">reasons I am just now finishing up an</text>
