  <text start="90.06" dur="5.46">has working with investors working</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="5.401">hand-in-hand with many people within the</text>
  <text start="95.52" dur="6.15">precious metal market in what we can do</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="5.879">and what we can expect in 2019 with gold</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.44">I mean I&amp;#39;m definitely gonna start</text>
  <text start="104.189" dur="4.32">investing some of my resources in</text>
  <text start="106.11" dur="5.99">precious metals I think you might as</text>
  <text start="108.509" dur="3.591">well check this interview out</text>
  <text start="116.74" dur="3.43">call him thank you so much for coming on</text>
  <text start="118.88" dur="2.97">here with me Jordan</text>
  <text start="120.17" dur="4.71">always a pleasure excited to be here</text>
  <text start="121.85" dur="5.19">good good so a couple weeks ago we last</text>
  <text start="124.88" dur="4.92">talked and since then a couple big</text>
  <text start="127.04" dur="5.79">things have happened in terms of gold in</text>
  <text start="129.8" dur="4.8">Q&amp;#39;s drops now Q being the intelligence</text>
  <text start="132.83" dur="3.12">dissemination effort linked to the Trump</text>
  <text start="134.6" dur="4.02">administration I think we can both agree</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="4.92">on that they said on December 12th gold</text>
  <text start="138.62" dur="2.73">shall destroy the Fed what do you think</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="3.81">of that</text>
  <text start="141.35" dur="5.64">well it&amp;#39;s interesting because we we kind</text>
  <text start="144.68" dur="6.39">of talked about it in our last interview</text>
  <text start="146.99" dur="5.94">but you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of belief out</text>
  <text start="151.07" dur="4.1">there that that the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="6.39">is going to tie the currency to gold</text>
  <text start="155.17" dur="7.09">which would really hand hamstring the</text>
  <text start="159.32" dur="5.79">fat you know the Fed is able to raise</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="4.59">and lower interest rates really they</text>
  <text start="165.11" dur="4.92">control the money and how how money is</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="6.57">is handled and that&amp;#39;s you know all those</text>
  <text start="170.03" dur="7.02">the Fed is just basically owned by all</text>
  <text start="173.42" dur="5.43">the large banks so the idea that this</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="3.689">administration may be moving into a</text>
  <text start="178.85" dur="5.04">situation where we&amp;#39;d have our currency</text>
  <text start="180.739" dur="6.301">tied to gold like we used to gives</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="5.61">people you know a currency that can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="5.1">just deflate the way that our money does</text>
  <text start="189.5" dur="6">it can&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t just be printed out of</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="5.58">thin air it would make our dollar</text>
  <text start="195.5" dur="4.92">stronger and I think it would really</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="4.89">lose the hurt the fat in terms of what</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="4.05">their power is over over our economy</text>
  <text start="202.61" dur="4.32">right because the Fed they&amp;#39;ve increased</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="7.11">the interest rate four times since</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="7.17">Trump&amp;#39;s presidency right yeah years</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="4.95">under Obama yeah and they just did it</text>
  <text start="214.1" dur="5.58">again and and you know I think most</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="6.54">educated people when they look at what</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="5.22">the Fed is doing they realize that you</text>
  <text start="223.07" dur="6.18">know the indicators to raise interest</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="7.02">rates are not to raise them at the rate</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="6.81">that they&amp;#39;re doing right now are unusual</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="6.81">and it does seem to be that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="4.95">working in opposition of the economy and</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="3.9">and in opposition of the president and</text>
  <text start="241.01" dur="3.69">and you know the reason that those</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="4.26">entities are separate is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="4.47">not it shouldn&amp;#39;t be it&amp;#39;s not like a</text>
  <text start="246.89" dur="3.27">Democrat Republican battle these it</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="2.97">shouldn&amp;#39;t be a buyer</text>
  <text start="250.16" dur="5.25">Hardison battle but it does seem as</text>
  <text start="252.14" dur="6.18">though the Fed has almost been</text>
  <text start="255.41" dur="6.329">weaponized in a way exactly and animals</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="4.71">have taken offense that you know Trump</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="3.391">being one of the first presidents to</text>
  <text start="263.03" dur="5.7">really just talk about the Fed and talk</text>
  <text start="265.13" dur="4.83">about the raising interest rates has put</text>
  <text start="268.73" dur="3.06">them in a position where they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="5.24">opposition and and ultimately we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="5.91">working towards a better economy and and</text>
  <text start="275.2" dur="5.38">you know the the stock market has</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="5.1">reacted obviously to that and and as</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="4.11">interest rates go up with the cost of</text>
  <text start="282.8" dur="4.32">money goes out the cost of borrowing and</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="5.52">our country is obviously predicated on</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="5.25">on on cheap debt right now right and if</text>
  <text start="290.21" dur="3.63">the gold is going to destroy the Fed you</text>
  <text start="292.37" dur="2.97">know one thing I find interesting and</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="3.87">this hasn&amp;#39;t been talked about too much</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="4.56">over the last ten months back in March</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="5.67">March 22nd there was a house resolution</text>
  <text start="299.9" dur="5.01">HR 5 404 the it was introduced in the</text>
  <text start="303.38" dur="2.73">house it was referred to the</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="3.12">subcommittee it&amp;#39;s just been sitting</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="4.5">there nothing&amp;#39;s happened to it since but</text>
  <text start="308.03" dur="6.51">it was a bill that it said was designed</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="6.45">to make the price of the dollar as a</text>
  <text start="314.54" dur="3.9">fixed weight of gold it says so could</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="2.79">this be something I mean they just like</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="3.03">having their back pocket that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.85" dur="4.41">waiting till the appropriate time to</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="4.44">bring out wrangle in the Fed and I mean</text>
  <text start="324.26" dur="2.82">from this like a weekend economic</text>
  <text start="325.91" dur="3.33">perspective what do you think the</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="4.89">investor should do thank you for these</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="6.24">things it&amp;#39;s interesting because you know</text>
  <text start="331.97" dur="6.48">the the Fed you know you look at you</text>
  <text start="335.48" dur="4.74">know extra congressman Ron Paul who</text>
  <text start="338.45" dur="4.74">always you know his book that says end</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="5.58">the Fed and talks about how you know the</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="4.77">Fed is is sort of able to wield their</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="5.91">influence without any kind of oversight</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="6.15">and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s scary when you</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="6.209">look at our money and our money supply</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="6.08">and what the Fed is able to do and you</text>
  <text start="357.919" dur="4.981">know who they determine to lend money to</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="6.19">so I think what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="5.91">is a few things one I do think the the</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="5.039">stock market has just been and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="4.77">inflated and and that was you know</text>
  <text start="371.419" dur="3.691">you&amp;#39;re gonna have these cycles where the</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="3.12">stock market&amp;#39;s current gonna correct</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="4.2">every seven to ten years and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376.7" dur="4.589">actually if you look at next year we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="4.79">in the 11th year so we&amp;#39;re sort of due</text>
  <text start="381.289" dur="4.701">for a correction a B I think the</text>
  <text start="384.1" dur="4.41">that you know money&amp;#39;s gonna get more</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="4.82">expensive which is off obviously get a</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="4.71">drive down the prices of real estate</text>
  <text start="390.81" dur="4.27">because if it costs more to buy a home</text>
  <text start="393.22" dur="4.14">and to buy commercial everything is just</text>
  <text start="395.08" dur="4.44">gonna go up you know in terms of costs</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="4.64">that&amp;#39;s gonna drive down the prices and</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="5.55">then I think you have this this kind of</text>
  <text start="402" dur="6.1">force working against the government in</text>
  <text start="405.07" dur="6.69">a way to try to manipulate things and</text>
  <text start="408.1" dur="6.78">maybe turn the tide for the presidential</text>
  <text start="411.76" dur="6.36">election in 2020 which I think that if</text>
  <text start="414.88" dur="5.88">the economy turns it would make it more</text>
  <text start="418.12" dur="5.28">difficult for for president Trump to get</text>
  <text start="420.76" dur="5.64">reelected which it seems like the Fed it</text>
  <text start="423.4" dur="5.43">would would want that and that&amp;#39;s I think</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="5.01">a little scary in that that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="5.46">intent of these different branches and</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="5.76">so people right now as I was saying</text>
  <text start="434.29" dur="4.65">before we jumped on here we&amp;#39;ve been you</text>
  <text start="437.17" dur="3.84">know typically this week is a slower</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="3.48">week we&amp;#39;ve been busier than ever I think</text>
  <text start="441.01" dur="3.72">people are very concerned right now</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="4.74">about their retirements they&amp;#39;re about</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="5.85">you know they seen the Dow from December</text>
  <text start="447.16" dur="8.82">3rd so today is down almost 13% as of</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="7.44">yesterday dramatic drop Christmas Eve we</text>
  <text start="455.98" dur="4.89">hot we saw the biggest one-day drop that</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve seen in a long time and this is</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="4.11">the worst mark market for the stock</text>
  <text start="462.67" dur="4.5">market they said since since the Great</text>
  <text start="464.98" dur="4.35">Depression just in terms of numbers so</text>
  <text start="467.17" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re starting to tap an some bear</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="3.87">market territory in terms of where the</text>
  <text start="471.43" dur="2.91">markets are going or where the</text>
  <text start="473.2" dur="4.53">indicators are and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="5.04">getting people kind of a weekend to</text>
  <text start="477.73" dur="3.33">what&amp;#39;s really happening out there right</text>
  <text start="479.38" dur="3.06">and the stock markets definitely</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="3.18">volatile I think a lot of investors are</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="3.72">seeing them but gold is steadily</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="4.74">increasing it just hit a six-month high</text>
  <text start="486.16" dur="5.19">it held it at about 12 79 an ounce and I</text>
  <text start="488.98" dur="4.08">saw a survey of investors done that</text>
  <text start="491.35" dur="5.19">shows a third of them think that gold is</text>
  <text start="493.06" dur="6.15">gonna get over 1,500 ounce in 2019 so</text>
  <text start="496.54" dur="5.22">sound like Gold&amp;#39;s a safe bet to you I</text>
  <text start="499.21" dur="5.7">mean that and that would still be you</text>
  <text start="501.76" dur="8.19">know 26 27 percent lower than where it</text>
  <text start="504.91" dur="7.83">was at 1500 so that it it&amp;#39;s got a lot</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="6.63">more room to go I always look at gold</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s a bottom right now should be 2500</text>
  <text start="516.58" dur="3.269">an ounce because</text>
  <text start="517.96" dur="5.34">it hit 2,500 dollars an ounce if you</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="5.461">take money from the early 1980s and you</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="4.59">take inflation when you know gold had</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="4.62">900 hours you take that number today it</text>
  <text start="527.89" dur="4.98">should be 2500 so I don&amp;#39;t even look at</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="4.65">gold as being anywhere near where it</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="3.69">should be until it hits that number and</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="4.77">and silver is the same thing I mean</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="5.04">Silver&amp;#39;s starting to move up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.35" dur="4.71">starting to move but you know if you</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="4.109">look at you know the early 1980s The</text>
  <text start="544.06" dur="4.469">Hunt Brothers try to corner the silver</text>
  <text start="545.709" dur="5.761">market the uses for silver from the</text>
  <text start="548.529" dur="5.37">1980s to today it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="551.47" dur="4.29">five or six thousand more uses for</text>
  <text start="553.899" dur="3.241">silver industrially than there was back</text>
  <text start="555.76" dur="3.6">then</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="4.83">so obviously the price is gonna have to</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="5.099">fall soon we talked Charles and I talked</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="3.809">to silver gold miners and they just they</text>
  <text start="564.459" dur="3.481">don&amp;#39;t understand how the prices are</text>
  <text start="565.779" dur="4.411">where they&amp;#39;re at and they&amp;#39;ve had to lay</text>
  <text start="567.94" dur="4.26">people off you know the mining companies</text>
  <text start="570.19" dur="4.47">have reduced mining substantially so</text>
  <text start="572.2" dur="4.32">when we go on this run they won&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="574.66" dur="3.48">enough gold or silver we will be backed</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="4.53">up you will not be able to get enough</text>
  <text start="578.14" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s a fact right that will actually if</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="5.159">a gold standard comes into play I mean</text>
  <text start="583.12" dur="4.68">that would yeah there would you you know</text>
  <text start="586.209" dur="5.07">it would be the gold rush all over again</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="6">and there the demand would be out seed</text>
  <text start="591.279" dur="4.621">out way the amount of gold that comes</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="3.42">down the ground because for gold all the</text>
  <text start="595.9" dur="4.379">money in the world there&amp;#39;s only an</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="5.25">increase of gold on you know on the</text>
  <text start="600.279" dur="3.901">earth that comes out about 1% per year</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not going to be enough if</text>
