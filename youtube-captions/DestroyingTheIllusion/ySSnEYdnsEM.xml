  <text start="66.93" dur="4.56">this website actually said on Twitter</text>
  <text start="68.729" dur="6.301">that it was not a hack it seems as if</text>
  <text start="71.49" dur="7.559">github straight-up deleted this website</text>

  <text start="102.659" dur="2.701">it was weird</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="4.769">I just logged into it here on my</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="4.86">computer and it didn&amp;#39;t come up so you</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="3.03">can track you know in post comm it might</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="3.66">redirect you to something you&amp;#39;ll just</text>

  <text start="123.899" dur="4.59">website because 8chan is very difficult</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="4.65">to navigate if you&amp;#39;re unfamiliar with it</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="4.861">so that&amp;#39;s why these websites like Q and</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="5.4">on post Q now hub etc are</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="4.11">tastic for us to follow along with so of</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="3.84">course it makes sense that the deep</text>

  <text start="186.71" dur="4.24">message out there and speaking of</text>
  <text start="189.57" dur="4.32">censorship we were talking about queue</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="5.1">censorship and another word on the Alex</text>

  <text start="204.42" dur="4.95">Jack said that in for is Alex Jones not</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="6.45">banned because he quote hasn&amp;#39;t violated</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="7.53">our rules now let&amp;#39;s put all the pieces</text>
  <text start="213.99" dur="5.7">together here we have about a week ago a</text>

  <text start="222.06" dur="7.05">attack campaign go on but what always</text>
  <text start="226.02" dur="6.02">happens when someone gets censored is</text>
  <text start="229.11" dur="5.85">that Streisand effect whereby if you</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="5.32">censor somebody or delete their accounts</text>
  <text start="234.96" dur="4.59">all the I&amp;#39;s the limelight then turns on</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="4.59">that person in effect if you censor</text>
  <text start="239.55" dur="4.95">somebody it actually gives them more</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="5.37">attention that&amp;#39;s the Streisand effect so</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="4.35">the elites knew a week ago when they</text>
  <text start="247.32" dur="3.03">came out with their Q attack visas they</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="3.27">were like oh man this is this is</text>
  <text start="250.35" dur="3.63">actually turning a lot of eyes on to it</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="3.989">right well then what did they do a</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="5.37">couple days later they pull Jones&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.831">platforms so what by pulling Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.47">his platforms that then turns all the</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="5.61">attention on him now Alex Jones doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="3.42">speak about Q there&amp;#39;s some history there</text>

  <text start="268.77" dur="4.619">does not discuss cute so by the elite</text>
  <text start="271.889" dur="3.81">doing this they basically turn all the</text>
  <text start="273.389" dur="7.981">attention on to somebody not discussing</text>
  <text start="275.699" dur="7.56">Q you see it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re using one</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="3.84">side up to help benefit another one of</text>
