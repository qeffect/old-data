  <text start="244.69" dur="4.32">your own perspectives worldviews and</text>

  <text start="249.01" dur="5.25">posted last night the primary ones that</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="6.69">I want to discuss why did JK go to</text>
  <text start="254.26" dur="7.2">Antarctica I go to Antarctica</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="4.04">what is happening in Antarctica and it</text>
  <text start="261.46" dur="4.04">also said</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="5.54">is it more private to talk there or</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="5.52">something else so let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="4.859">Antarctica a little bit here and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="5.63">first talk about the history of</text>
  <text start="273.139" dur="7.21">Antarctica what&amp;#39;s really down there and</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="6.1">the reason why you have to charter a</text>
  <text start="280.349" dur="4.771">plane and planes don&amp;#39;t fly over</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="3.96">Antarctica no it&amp;#39;s not because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="3.15">an edge of a dome there and the planes</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="6">are gonna crash into the dome it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="6.51">because in Antarctica there are well for</text>
  <text start="292.71" dur="4.049">a long time for millennia if not</text>
  <text start="294.78" dur="5.359">multiple millennia there&amp;#39;s been ruins</text>
  <text start="296.759" dur="7.521">down there there&amp;#39;s ancient civilizations</text>
  <text start="300.139" dur="7.361">ruins under the ice in Antarctica and</text>
  <text start="304.28" dur="7.44">could very well be extraterrestrial</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="7.61">ruins could be an Atlantis you know pre</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="6.009">civilization because let&amp;#39;s be real folks</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="4.839">the winners of the war right the</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="5.671">textbooks so all of our history history</text>
  <text start="319.949" dur="5.31">textbooks are completely</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re completely wrong and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.259" dur="4.741">much more of a history to humanity than</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re led to believe we don&amp;#39;t originate</text>
  <text start="330" dur="4.46">from monkeys in Africa and you know</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="6.62">whatever they tell us in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="334.46" dur="8.679">I&amp;#39;m going to link down below a video of</text>
  <text start="339.74" dur="6.669">David Wilcock his Antarctica Atlantis</text>
  <text start="343.139" dur="5.611">video it was from a presentation he did</text>
  <text start="346.409" dur="5.581">at the conscious life Expo I believe</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="5.099">earlier this year watch it it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="351.99" dur="3.989">good it describes the whole back story</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="4.32">in regards to it</text>
  <text start="355.979" dur="4.831">I ain&amp;#39;t Arctica and what&amp;#39;s actually down</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="6.3">there and how that plays into these</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="8.07">disclosures that are going on and great</text>
  <text start="364.469" dur="7.92">great video go watch it you know you may</text>
  <text start="368.88" dur="5.219">have your opinions on David Wilcock but</text>
  <text start="372.389" dur="4.051">he was pivotal in my awakening</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="3.961">especially in about 2011 I read his</text>
  <text start="376.44" dur="5.31">source field book and I&amp;#39;ve just pulled</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="6.03">you know but of course not every one</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="4.919">person is an all-knowing harbinger of</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="4.59">truth so you take what you can you know</text>
  <text start="386.669" dur="4.441">as Bruce Lee said absorb what&amp;#39;s useful</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="5.4">reject what&amp;#39;s useless and add what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="4.73">your own so do that but it&amp;#39;s great video</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="4.52">go check it out if you&amp;#39;re not familiar</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="5.31">with Antarctica and also what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="5.52">in Antarctica is what happened with the</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="6.33">Nazis their bad connection can you guys</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="6.15">see me hope you guys can see me I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="407.48" dur="5.28">know why my Wi-Fi is geeking anyway</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="4.46">what&amp;#39;s going on what went on during</text>
  <text start="412.76" dur="4.47">World War two that&amp;#39;s another huge</text>
  <text start="414.73" dur="6.01">unlearning and relearning that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.23" dur="5.52">gonna have to go through is because</text>
  <text start="420.74" dur="5.28">during World War two</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="5.99">you know the Nazis what they did is they</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="5.459">were more interested in what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="4.36">qualitative superiority instead of</text>
  <text start="431.479" dur="4.381">quantitative superiority</text>
  <text start="433.1" dur="5.97">so qualitative superiority means they</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="5.279">wanted technology they didn&amp;#39;t want boots</text>
  <text start="439.07" dur="3.75">on the ground you see in America we were</text>
  <text start="441.139" dur="3.871">making more tanks we were we had more</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="4.47">men the Germans knew that they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.01" dur="4.5">win the war with quantity they needed</text>
  <text start="447.29" dur="4.91">quality so what they did is that they</text>
  <text start="449.51" dur="7.02">actually studied the esoteric you see</text>
  <text start="452.2" dur="6.52">the Nazis wanted</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="4.02">they literally studied the Vedas they</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="4.92">went to the Himalayas and tried to</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="8.489">retrieve a lot of ancient scrolls</text>
  <text start="463.64" dur="5.91">ancient texts they worked with maria</text>
  <text start="469.039" dur="2.521">orsic</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="5.76">who was a channeler she actually was</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="6.99">able to channel different schematics for</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="6.51">anti-gravity vehicles they pretty much</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="5.4">enslaved scientist by the name of viktor</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="6.75">schauberger who was doing research into</text>
  <text start="483.95" dur="7.71">implosion implosion or basically</text>
  <text start="488.57" dur="4.65">compression or gravity research somebody</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="4.11">said the fuel and the Royal Society</text>
  <text start="493.22" dur="4.5">exactly maria orsic was channeling for</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="5.519">the Vril society which was a german</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="5.73">secret society in world war ii so what</text>
  <text start="501.289" dur="3.711">I&amp;#39;m basically saying is that the Nazis</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="4.71">in World War two obtained</text>
  <text start="505" dur="5.919">electrogravitic technology and they were</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="5.91">actually able to build a handful of</text>
  <text start="510.919" dur="5.191">flying discs multiple I believe</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="4.76">somewhere between like ten to fifteen if</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="5.099">not ten to twenty disks now the thing is</text>
  <text start="518.83" dur="5.43">since America had more boots on the</text>
  <text start="521.209" dur="5.701">ground and the Nazis didn&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="3.43">they weren&amp;#39;t able to build out their</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="4.95">electro</text>
  <text start="527.69" dur="5.85">vidiq technology to out man and out gun</text>
  <text start="531.86" dur="4.229">those Americans that came over and you</text>
  <text start="533.54" dur="5.19">know all the Allied forces what they had</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="5.881">to do was take their research take their</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="7.409">flying discs and all their stuff down to</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="7.739">Antarctica so in about 1938 the Nazis on</text>
  <text start="546.139" dur="5.401">their u-boats took their research took</text>
  <text start="549.709" dur="3.151">their disks and took the primitive stuff</text>
  <text start="551.54" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re working on and brought it down</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="4.079">to Antarctica because you got to</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="5.19">understand folks Antarctica is not some</text>
  <text start="556.939" dur="5.671">big ice ball that you can barely live on</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="4.77">like Hoth right Antarctica is actually</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="4.8">pretty warm down there and there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="564.56" dur="4.92">of caverns under the ice you&amp;#39;ll notice</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="3.479">literally right now not now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="2.88">watching this video after you&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="570.889" dur="3.541">watching this video go onto google and</text>
  <text start="572.36" dur="4.95">type in Antarctica and look at the news</text>
  <text start="574.43" dur="5.099">and you&amp;#39;ll find that the biggest news</text>
  <text start="577.31" dur="4.29">story that&amp;#39;s been circulating around on</text>

  <text start="615.649" dur="4.8">War two were able to built out build out</text>
  <text start="617.779" dur="6.3">those caverns and create R&amp;amp;D research</text>
  <text start="620.449" dur="7.2">and development programs under the ice</text>
  <text start="624.079" dur="7.23">and Antarctica and I&amp;#39;ll make long story</text>
  <text start="627.649" dur="6.571">short here but you can also look into</text>
  <text start="631.309" dur="4.921">what&amp;#39;s called operation Highjump so the</text>
  <text start="634.22" dur="3.69">Americans caught wind that the Nazis</text>
  <text start="636.23" dur="3.959">took all their stuff down to Antarctica</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="5.849">you know and of course World War two</text>
  <text start="640.189" dur="5.551">ended in 1945 in Europe but the history</text>
  <text start="643.759" dur="3.12">books don&amp;#39;t tell you about the Antarctic</text>
  <text start="645.74" dur="3.3">component well</text>
  <text start="646.879" dur="4.801">operation Highjump was an operation by</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="5.729">the American Navy led my led by Admiral</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.909">Byrd in 1947 so it was actually after</text>
  <text start="654.769" dur="4.32">the official end of World War two but</text>
  <text start="656.589" dur="4.691">Admiral Byrd was tasked with going down</text>
  <text start="659.089" dur="6.021">to Antarctica with about 5,000 men</text>
  <text start="661.28" dur="6.93">30 airplanes and like 10 or 20 ships</text>
  <text start="665.11" dur="4.69">lots of stuff and it was it was made</text>
  <text start="668.21" dur="3.93">publicly known as being a research</text>
  <text start="669.8" dur="3.9">expedition but you don&amp;#39;t take 5,000 men</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="5.52">down to Antarctica for a research</text>
  <text start="673.7" dur="7.26">expedition okay what Admiral Byrd went</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="6.27">down to Antarctica for was to attack the</text>
  <text start="680.96" dur="4.83">Nazi forces that the Americans found out</text>
  <text start="683.93" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re down there well because the Nazis</text>
  <text start="685.79" dur="5.1">were building out their anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="688.13" dur="4.83">craft or electrogravitic</text>
  <text start="690.89" dur="4.62">I like elect electrogravitic better I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="692.96" dur="4.77">actually do a video on that soon as to</text>
  <text start="695.51" dur="5.7">the relationship between electricity and</text>
  <text start="697.73" dur="4.98">gravity but anyway Admiral Byrd went</text>
  <text start="701.21" dur="3.45">down there the Germans with their</text>
  <text start="702.71" dur="3.57">anti-gravity craft beat the out of</text>
  <text start="704.66" dur="4.38">Admiral Byrd and Admiral Byrd had to</text>
  <text start="706.28" dur="4.65">retreat actually from Antarctica so the</text>
  <text start="709.04" dur="4.89">Germans didn&amp;#39;t lose world war two they</text>
  <text start="710.93" dur="6.21">went underground actually under ice more</text>
  <text start="713.93" dur="5.04">literally and then what they did is</text>
  <text start="717.14" dur="4.8">through Operation Paperclip</text>
  <text start="718.97" dur="6.12">they the Nazis were able to force the</text>
  <text start="721.94" dur="4.8">hand of the Americans in 1952 the Nazis</text>
  <text start="725.09" dur="3.45">actually flew along their Bell craft</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="4.08">their anti-gravity craft over the US</text>
  <text start="728.54" dur="4.89">Capitol and they basically forced the</text>
  <text start="730.82" dur="4.44">Americans hands that&amp;#39;s how all of these</text>
  <text start="733.43" dur="5.04">Germans were able to immigrate into</text>
  <text start="735.26" dur="7.68">America is that the Germans forced it</text>
  <text start="738.47" dur="6.99">and you know you can kind of expand from</text>
  <text start="742.94" dur="4.74">the rest there and then JFK had to fight</text>
  <text start="745.46" dur="4.44">the military-industrial complex he lost</text>
  <text start="747.68" dur="4.14">obviously I use in however was fighting</text>
  <text start="749.9" dur="6.72">it and then their tentacles just spread</text>
  <text start="751.82" dur="9.45">so that&amp;#39;s a basic you know six seven</text>
  <text start="756.62" dur="7.68">minute recap on Antarctica but how that</text>
  <text start="761.27" dur="5.31">factors into now is I mean you can go</text>
  <text start="764.3" dur="4.08">check out that a video I mentioned</text>
  <text start="766.58" dur="5.28">earlier and how it factors in now but</text>
  <text start="768.38" dur="5.01">basically disclosure right disclosure of</text>
  <text start="771.86" dur="3.09">real history disclosure of this</text>
  <text start="773.39" dur="3.66">technology disclosure of what&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="774.95" dur="5.13">going on in Antarctica are they gonna</text>
  <text start="777.05" dur="4.89">disclose part of it or all of it right</text>
  <text start="780.08" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s why these things I&amp;#39;m telling you</text>
  <text start="781.94" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re so important because if we know</text>
  <text start="783.89" dur="4.62">that German secret societies have been</text>
  <text start="786.53" dur="4.05">down there since World War two well then</text>
  <text start="788.51" dur="3.93">we know much more the truth and if we</text>
  <text start="790.58" dur="3.28">try to get some kind of official</text>
  <text start="792.44" dur="3.07">disclosure from the governor</text>
  <text start="793.86" dur="3.81">or something to that effect and they</text>
  <text start="795.51" dur="3.329">don&amp;#39;t tell us things like oh the Nazis</text>
  <text start="797.67" dur="2.82">have been on there since World War two</text>
  <text start="798.839" dur="3.331">well then you know they&amp;#39;re half-assing</text>
  <text start="800.49" dur="4.68">their disclosure so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.17" dur="4.83">important but anyway I think I&amp;#39;m done</text>
  <text start="805.17" dur="4.859">talking about that let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="807" dur="5.31">couple more couple more things about</text>
  <text start="810.029" dur="6.781">queue that I want to make a note of is</text>
  <text start="812.31" dur="7.05">he on Air Force One or very close in</text>
  <text start="816.81" dur="7.56">proximity to the president and the</text>
  <text start="819.36" dur="8.669">reason I say this is because you posted</text>
  <text start="824.37" dur="6.63">a pic above Hong Kong yesterday I</text>
  <text start="828.029" dur="8.461">believe was it yesterday check here it</text>
  <text start="831" dur="8.579">was yesterday yeah</text>
  <text start="836.49" dur="5.789">so you posted a pic above Hong Kong at</text>
  <text start="839.579" dur="5.7">the same time that Air Force one was</text>
  <text start="842.279" dur="7.111">actually in the air going over the same</text>
  <text start="845.279" dur="6.99">area and this just is another piece of</text>
  <text start="849.39" dur="5.28">the puzzle that you know let&amp;#39;s leads me</text>
  <text start="852.269" dur="4.741">to believe the queue is very well</text>
  <text start="854.67" dur="4.71">connected I don&amp;#39;t think you is the</text>
  <text start="857.01" dur="5.85">president I think queue is very close to</text>
  <text start="859.38" dur="6.3">the president I think I know who queue</text>
  <text start="862.86" dur="4.349">is and I&amp;#39;m not gonna say names or</text>
  <text start="865.68" dur="2.24">anything like that here it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="867.209" dur="3.75">a secret</text>
  <text start="867.92" dur="4.9">he made a mention of it made a hint of</text>
  <text start="870.959" dur="5.19">it on Twitter as to who queue is but</text>
  <text start="872.82" dur="5.4">anyway I think I know who it is but you</text>
  <text start="876.149" dur="6.81">know very interesting just another</text>
  <text start="878.22" dur="5.94">another piece that that let leads me to</text>
  <text start="882.959" dur="2.25">believe that it&amp;#39;s the truth and of</text>
  <text start="884.16" dur="2.46">course there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that</text>
  <text start="885.209" dur="3.87">haven&amp;#39;t come to fruition that Cube has</text>
  <text start="886.62" dur="4.62">said yet like you know the Podesta</text>
  <text start="889.079" dur="4.771">indictment on the third and the humi</text>
  <text start="891.24" dur="4.469">indictment being on the sixth and all of</text>
  <text start="893.85" dur="4.71">these things but there&amp;#39;s so many things</text>
  <text start="895.709" dur="4.801">that are actually happening like the</text>
  <text start="898.56" dur="3.209">thing in Saudi Arabia and I want to say</text>
  <text start="900.51" dur="2.759">that I want to make a note on that</text>
  <text start="901.769" dur="3.241">really quick is that what happened in</text>
  <text start="903.269" dur="3.451">Saudi Arabia I don&amp;#39;t think enough people</text>
  <text start="905.01" dur="2.67">are taking quite as seriously as it</text>
  <text start="906.72" dur="4.14">actually is</text>
  <text start="907.68" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s huge would happen there and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="910.86" dur="4.74">going to reverberate around the globe</text>
  <text start="913.47" dur="7.229">okay and it will happen you have to have</text>
  <text start="915.6" dur="7.469">patience but anyway Thank You Jay so I</text>
  <text start="920.699" dur="4.89">keep doing videos on it and then also I</text>
  <text start="923.069" dur="4.501">want to make a note on Trump Trump&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1002.42" dur="4.61">don&amp;#39;t think these locations that he</text>
