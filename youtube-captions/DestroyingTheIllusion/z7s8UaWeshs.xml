  <text start="0.03" dur="4.849">so most of what I do on this channel is</text>
  <text start="2.28" dur="5.579">related to investigations and</text>
  <text start="4.879" dur="4.84">disclosures of the corruption and</text>
  <text start="7.859" dur="3.691">suppression of various topics and things</text>
  <text start="9.719" dur="3.54">like that this video is gonna be a</text>
  <text start="11.55" dur="5.819">little bit different but it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="13.259" dur="6.6">very much with that disclosure concept</text>
  <text start="17.369" dur="4.981">and I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about a man named dr.</text>
  <text start="19.859" dur="4.381">max Gerson it&amp;#39;s gonna be very health</text>
  <text start="22.35" dur="5.009">related in this video because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.24" dur="5.58">where I come from my original awakening</text>
  <text start="27.359" dur="3.84">process occurred in the health field and</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="4.47">then I went down every other rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="6.871">from there so it&amp;#39;s very much ingrained</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="5.88">in Who I am and I try to give people</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="3.989">health knowledge and health information</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="2.7">about themselves because I mean know</text>
  <text start="42.059" dur="3.241">thyself</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s what Socrates Plato one of those</text>
  <text start="45.3" dur="5.37">Greek dudes said know thyself is the</text>
  <text start="48" dur="6.05">beginning of all wisdom and a lot of</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="5.76">people watching this channel and just in</text>
  <text start="54.05" dur="5.41">society in general are looking for</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="5.49">spiritual growth and metaphysical growth</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="4.83">but every layer of who we are is</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="5.1">connected from the physical to the</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="5.52">metaphysical layer so to really get</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="4.95">spiritual growth right to get our DNA</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="6.3">activated to get our pineal gland</text>
  <text start="71.97" dur="5.789">functioning right and everything working</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="4.11">at top notch we have to really take care</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="4.891">of our physical bodies and dr. max</text>
  <text start="80.22" dur="6.39">Gerson and his theories his concepts and</text>
  <text start="82.65" dur="7.259">his history is really important and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="6.24">really helpful to gauge how to take care</text>
  <text start="89.909" dur="4.561">of our physical bodies so first what I</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="3.809">want to discuss is who met dr. max</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="4.14">Gerson was in his history what he went</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="6.181">through so he was a doctor a medical</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="6.84">doctor in Germany in the 1930s and he</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="4.139">ended up escaping Germany I think he</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="2.94">went to live in Italy in England for a</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="4.731">couple years and he ended up emigrating</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="6.72">to New York and became a US citizen in</text>
  <text start="111.71" dur="7.229">1942 and a board-certified practitioner</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="6.63">in New York and what he was doing was</text>
  <text start="118.939" dur="5.131">what he formulated originally he</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="5.19">formulated this in Europe but he had</text>
  <text start="124.07" dur="5.889">debilitating migraines that he was</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="5.43">really wanting to get rid of and dr. max</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="4.771">Gerson I believe his parents were</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="6.3">ecologists so he had a very deep</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="7.2">connection to the soil and he began to</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="5.22">see how lacking minerals and lacking</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="4.97">nutrients in the soil would affect plant</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="5.97">growth so what he did was he actually</text>
  <text start="146.9" dur="4.96">started experimenting with diets with</text>
  <text start="149.85" dur="5.52">dietary regimens and how that would help</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="5.58">his migraines and he actually cured his</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="8.73">own debilitating migraines with a</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="9.66">specific diet now he then helped to heal</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="4.41">one of his friends that had migraines as</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="3.27">well and his friends migraines</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="6.57">disappeared on this specific diet that</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="8.16">max Gerson formulated but this friend of</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="5.55">his also had skin tuberculosis and he</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="6.54">noticed that his skin tuberculosis also</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="7.53">went away so dr. Gerson then researched</text>
  <text start="185.07" dur="6.57">more and more and at the University he</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="6.63">was at he launched a very profound study</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="6.93">of 500 different people that had skin</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="8.13">tuberculosis and 99 percent of them I</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="6.99">believe over 490 of them had their skin</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="5.28">- both skin tuberculosis cured by dr.</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="4.679">max Gerson Therapy now this was the</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="4.319">first known cure of skin tuberculosis</text>
  <text start="210.239" dur="5.011">and was actually published in very large</text>
  <text start="212.519" dur="4.681">medical journals in Europe now</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="5.519">fast-forward to his immigration in</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="6.569">America dr. max Gerson began using this</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="5.011">specific protocol with people that had</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="4.171">skin tuberculosis with people that had</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="4.53">arthritis he found that works very well</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="4.23">for and then he eventually started using</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="5.07">it with people that had cancer and he</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="5.76">found an amazing success rate with</text>
  <text start="235.38" dur="7.91">people that had cancer with this Gerson</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="8.4">Therapy and this began blowing up and</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="5.47">dr. max Gerson even testified in front</text>
  <text start="246.33" dur="4.92">of Congress and brought I believe 20 to</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="6.69">30 of his patients in with him to</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="7.979">testify but of course the FDA be the</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="5.55">fraud death Administration really got</text>
  <text start="259.229" dur="4.021">the clamp down once they understood what</text>
  <text start="261" dur="4.25">was going on with dr. max Gerson and</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="4.64">they ended up</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="6.06">rescinding his license in New York they</text>
  <text start="267.89" dur="5.4">I believe sued him multiple times of</text>
  <text start="271.31" dur="5.19">course it&amp;#39;s all made-up BS that they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="273.29" dur="5.16">sue him for but that really costs a lot</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="6.51">of money in time of dr. max Gerson and</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="7.05">he ended up dying and it&amp;#39;s alleged they</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="3.63">actually died of arsenic poisoning he</text>
  <text start="285.5" dur="2.19">was tested about a week before his</text>
  <text start="286.64" dur="4.92">deaths and they have death and they</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="6.15">found arsenic in his body and ended up</text>
  <text start="291.56" dur="5.16">passing away but luckily his</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="5.76">granddaughter continued his legacy and</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="6.6">he she now her name&amp;#39;s Charlotte Gerson</text>
  <text start="299.6" dur="6.06">she now has a Institute in Mexico where</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="4.77">people will go and use the Gerson</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="6.57">Therapy and the Gerson Therapy in and of</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="7.53">itself was one of the first not only</text>
  <text start="312.23" dur="10.11">dietary protocols but holistic protocols</text>
  <text start="315.62" dur="10.17">that was used to cure cancer and it was</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="5.73">very profound to see because of course</text>
  <text start="325.79" dur="5.64">our allopathic Western medical system</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="4.95">likes to compartmentalize everything and</text>
  <text start="331.43" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s why doctors are so confused about</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="2.7">all this because they have no idea</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="3.089">how to connect the dots and look at</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="4.77">things holistically so dr. max Gerson</text>
  <text start="337.669" dur="7.281">protocol was fantastic and I highly</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="6.36">recommend it I highly recommend not</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="4.69">necessarily doing it because it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="5.22">strict it&amp;#39;s very particular but just</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="4.23">researching it and researching the</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="3.21">history the suppression of dr. max</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="5">Gerson and all the skullduggery that</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="6.6">went on in FDA and the theories behind</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="4.99">dr. max Gerson protocol that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="3.75">really want to out lay to you in this</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="4.71">video is the theories behind it because</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="6.18">dr. max Gerson is full theory of the</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="6.59">cause of all human chronic degenerative</text>
  <text start="371.81" dur="7.25">disease is that it stems from two things</text>
  <text start="375.16" dur="7.509">toxicity in the body and malnutrition</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="6.4">it&amp;#39;s really that simple and if you look</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="5.221">at any human disease dysfunction</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="4.65">sickness illness and you look at those</text>
  <text start="387.89" dur="4.47">two things you could have a good grasp</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="5.04">on how to handle pretty much anything</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="5.369">when looking at toxins and malnutrition</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="3.46">and if you look at all the freakin</text>
  <text start="397.729" dur="2.71">toxins in our environment</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="4.049">the EPA has over 80 thousand registered</text>
  <text start="400.439" dur="5.73">toxins we have vaccines fluoride GMO</text>
  <text start="402.659" dur="5.07">foods chemtrails cosmetic products with</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="2.041">all kind of estrogenic chemicals in</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="3">there</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="5.04">we have fragrances that we breathe</text>
  <text start="410.729" dur="4.381">pretty much everything you touch feel</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="3.24">eat even look at I mean</text>
  <text start="415.11" dur="4.32">electromagnetic frequencies could</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="3.929">because is a toxin stress when our</text>
  <text start="419.43" dur="2.94">adrenal glands are pumping out a bunch</text>
  <text start="420.419" dur="3.84">of cortisol that&amp;#39;s toxin right there so</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="3.419">there&amp;#39;s an amazing amount of toxins in</text>
  <text start="424.259" dur="4.771">our environment and nutritional</text>
  <text start="425.789" dur="6.451">deficiencies huge even organic food</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="5.129">these days has much less nutrition than</text>
  <text start="432.24" dur="3.959">it did eighty years ago because of all</text>
  <text start="434.159" dur="4.35">over agriculture GMOs pesticides</text>
  <text start="436.199" dur="3.69">pesticides chelate nutrients out of</text>
  <text start="438.509" dur="4.261">foods that&amp;#39;s what they do that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="439.889" dur="4.77">they kill weeds or herbicides I mean so</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="5.519">herbicides just everywhere in our</text>
  <text start="444.659" dur="5.04">environment processed foods so literally</text>
  <text start="448.289" dur="5.671">the electricity that we&amp;#39;re able to</text>
