  <text start="216.2" dur="4.599">right here I should say dark in</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="3.3">parentheses ten a lot of people expected</text>
  <text start="220.799" dur="4.94">that to mean the ten days of darkness</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="5.76">but in reality it was probably</text>
  <text start="225.739" dur="7.261">referencing the ten hours of darkness</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="9.56">that the Atlanta Airport went under conf</text>

  <text start="290.64" dur="4.65">looks like these q posts are referencing</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="5.1">here he&amp;#39;s basically giving us the</text>
  <text start="295.29" dur="3.06">answers to some posts of his for a</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="2.55">couple days ago</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="6.51">concourse F Terminal five privately</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="7.02">operated plane ATL to IAD right I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="4.05">even know that I was unlocking some</text>
  <text start="307.29" dur="5.07">breadcrumbs right here yesterday but</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="8.94">this one plane went from Atlanta to IAD</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="8.34">washington washington d.c so that looks</text>
  <text start="317.85" dur="5.07">like hold on you see I know you guys</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.14">like the white board but this is why I</text>
  <text start="322.92" dur="3.96">getting a new program would just help me</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="3.39">with streamlining everything don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="326.88" dur="4.32">the white boards not going away it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="6.75">just you know if I go somewhere I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="8.04">exactly take this like six by four white</text>
  <text start="334.98" dur="7.85">board with me right so anyway this is</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="8.79">all reference to Atlanta it says</text>
  <text start="342.83" dur="9.01">extraction known so extraction what</text>
  <text start="348.03" dur="7.65">maybe they were extracting an asset from</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="7.05">the Atlanta Airport some bad guy they</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="5.54">wanted or maybe they down to the plane</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="6.78">maybe this one plane that got airborne</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="6.64">was brought down and they were to able</text>
  <text start="365.67" dur="7.77">to extract whoever was trying to get</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="6.9">away right so learn um basically some</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="2.63">other things here I won&amp;#39;t really deduce</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="3.93">because I have no idea what they mean</text>
  <text start="376.07" dur="6.46">special place in parentheses</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="6.09">why are drops highlighted by the</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="4.47">president shortly thereafter coincidence</text>
  <text start="384.78" dur="5.22">or message and then the great awakening</text>
  <text start="387" dur="4.94">in parentheses and this is all reference</text>
  <text start="390" dur="4.65">to here&amp;#39;s Donald Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter on</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="6.37">December 17th when he left Camp David</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="6.75">right here it says a very special place</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="4.77">and not only that but</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="3.39">one of the speeches yesterday I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.08" dur="3.48">know if it was this one or where the</text>
  <text start="404.79" dur="3.75">ones appear but he mentioned a Great</text>
  <text start="406.56" dur="6.15">Awakening or a great real awakening he</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="6.39">said so all of these subtle clues are</text>
  <text start="412.71" dur="3.769">just corroborations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.93" dur="5.22">corroborations letting us know that</text>
  <text start="416.479" dur="5.111">these cue drops whoever is posting these</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="3.329">cue posts I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="3.84">president I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="423.479" dur="4.341">the president&amp;#39;s kid or a lot of people</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="5.91">are getting these weird speculations but</text>
  <text start="427.82" dur="5.14">I have my ideas onto who or what q is</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="4.68">but anyway it&amp;#39;s basically just letting</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="5.16">us know that this Q group is an alliance</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="3.48">that the president of United States is a</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="5.549">part of that&amp;#39;s taking down the deep</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="7.46">state it&amp;#39;s just corroboration and then</text>
  <text start="443.669" dur="7.411">right here it says looks like classified</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="7.03">operation of DC future right said passed</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="4.83">up here Declassified ATL so it looks</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="4.77">like maybe we&amp;#39;ll get some drops in</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="5.189">regards to whatever&amp;#39;s going on at the ie</text>
  <text start="458.76" dur="4.98">D Airport maybe some more information on</text>
  <text start="461.099" dur="4.981">the plane maybe some stuff that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.74" dur="3.83">supposed to try to deduce how about a</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="3.839">nice game of chess</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="5.68">someone just commented and said Q is an</text>
  <text start="469.919" dur="11.611">alien anyway</text>
  <text start="473.25" dur="10.169">splash Fox 3 a couple interesting ideas</text>
  <text start="481.53" dur="3.359">of what that might mean on a chant I</text>
  <text start="483.419" dur="6.051">don&amp;#39;t exactly know but that was the</text>
  <text start="484.889" dur="7.861">first post so it&amp;#39;s a long long game long</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="8.05">puzzle to try to deduce there you can go</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="7.889">ahead and try let&amp;#39;s see this is a Q post</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="6.149">in response to this an anonymous poster</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="5.34">said give us a hint on the ATL Airport Q</text>
  <text start="503.669" dur="5.641">said extraction under store good</text>
  <text start="505.979" dur="4.921">so extraction was extracted don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="4.05">might have been a person might have been</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="4.59">stuff pay some stuff was trying to be</text>
  <text start="513.36" dur="6.809">hustled through ATL and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="7.77">power was cut to atl right here is</text>
  <text start="520.169" dur="6.271">actually quick sidenote here&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="5.55">article on squawker that i&amp;#39;ll post down</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="4.86">below this and it&amp;#39;s basically discussing</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="4.649">that 4chan users find evidence of</text>
  <text start="531.3" dur="2.97">Atlanta Airport blackout was part of an</text>
  <text start="533.459" dur="3.661">intentional</text>
  <text start="534.27" dur="5.25">and this kind of talks about that single</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="5.52">plane that I mentioned and this article</text>
  <text start="539.52" dur="4.379">talks a little bit more it kind of goes</text>
  <text start="542.64" dur="2.85">into the plane and whatnot the</text>
  <text start="543.899" dur="3.391">background of it it actually mentions</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="4.46">that fire drill that I just showed you a</text>
  <text start="547.29" dur="6.95">minute ago but this is a good post</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="9.66">discussing how you know possible cargos</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="8.53">valuable enough to need a blackout to</text>
  <text start="559.61" dur="5.59">hustle through basically could have been</text>
  <text start="562.77" dur="5.66">people nukes bio weapons gold currency</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="5.31">evidence you know whatever the case was</text>
  <text start="568.43" dur="4">could have even been a false flag right</text>
  <text start="570.51" dur="3.81">it could have been a false flag planned</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="5.01">at the Atlanta Airport so I we had a</text>
  <text start="574.32" dur="5.76">drill there and maybe that was botched</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="6.899">or thwarted afforded false flag there</text>
  <text start="580.08" dur="6.33">who knows right here somebody asked Q</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="3.661">seconding this the context of that train</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="3.84">so now we&amp;#39;ll get into the Seattle train</text>
  <text start="588" dur="4.47">incident I&amp;#39;ll add some more comments on</text>
  <text start="590.25" dur="3.99">that in a minute here but this anonymous</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="4.29">poster says seconding this the context</text>
  <text start="594.24" dur="5.4">of that train crash seems relevant high</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="4.98">value target aboard and Q says we would</text>
  <text start="599.64" dur="4.949">not intentionally harm a person in the</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="7.589">pursuit of a target this was retaliatory</text>
  <text start="604.589" dur="6.781">re ATL so it looks like from this we can</text>
  <text start="609.329" dur="4.401">deduce that something happened in ATL</text>
  <text start="611.37" dur="5.85">that was thwarted by the white hats</text>
  <text start="613.73" dur="6.099">whether it was a false flag or some bad</text>
  <text start="617.22" dur="5.16">dude trying to dip the country something</text>
  <text start="619.829" dur="5.401">was thwarted and what happened in</text>
  <text start="622.38" dur="5.78">Seattle yesterday was retaliation to</text>
  <text start="625.23" dur="6.27">that right makes total sense</text>
  <text start="628.16" dur="5.71">next day train goes off the tracks right</text>
  <text start="631.5" dur="4.77">onto the freeway right onto the freeway</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="4.5">and somehow the train was going like 50</text>
  <text start="636.27" dur="4.58">miles an hour over the speed limit way</text>
  <text start="638.37" dur="4.86">too weird just to be a coincidence</text>
  <text start="640.85" dur="3.76">let&amp;#39;s see here we&amp;#39;ll get down into some</text>
  <text start="643.23" dur="6.33">more Q post before we go into the</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="8.539">Seattle stuff not in this poster asks q</text>
  <text start="649.56" dur="7.11">here as punishment for the atl atlanta</text>
  <text start="653.149" dur="6.221">extraction wonder which pawn is off the</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="4.7">table or was it something higher so it</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="5.61">looks like this anonymous poster was</text>
  <text start="661.37" dur="5.86">assuming that the extraction meant that</text>
  <text start="664.98" dur="5.37">there was a person take</text>
  <text start="667.23" dur="4.86">and off the table in Atlanta good</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="4.23">assumption right kind of what I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="672.09" dur="5.04">saying here it&amp;#39;s a possibility and Q</text>
  <text start="674.58" dur="6.99">then says it wasn&amp;#39;t a pawn it was a</text>
