  <text start="8.21" dur="5.049">whoo how&amp;#39;s it going guys bringing the</text>
  <text start="10.8" dur="4.08">whiteboard back for this video and what</text>
  <text start="13.259" dur="4.411">I want to discuss with you guys in this</text>
  <text start="14.88" dur="5.61">one here is anti-gravity propulsion</text>
  <text start="17.67" dur="6.15">schemes now there&amp;#39;s a couple reasons why</text>
  <text start="20.49" dur="6.18">I want to do this video on this topic</text>
  <text start="23.82" dur="5.34">one of those reasons is because I am</text>
  <text start="26.67" dur="4.769">doing a whole lot of research for a</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="3.899">webinar I have coming up on the secret</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="3.631">space program you can check the</text>
  <text start="33.059" dur="4.081">description below this video if you want</text>
  <text start="35.07" dur="3.78">to go check it out and another reason I</text>
  <text start="37.14" dur="4.62">want to do this video is because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="38.85" dur="6.38">been a lot of talk lately about the</text>
  <text start="41.76" dur="8.04">Trump administration declassifying</text>
  <text start="45.23" dur="7.21">exotic technologies so what I want to do</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="5.07">in this video is familiarize you guys</text>
  <text start="52.44" dur="6.81">with some of the information behind that</text>
  <text start="54.87" dur="7.829">how it&amp;#39;s been suppressed for a very long</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="6.99">time and how technologies and Sciences</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="6.271">like anti-gravity are a very real thing</text>
  <text start="66.24" dur="5.699">so let&amp;#39;s get into it we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="6.329">about the technology of tomorrow that we</text>
  <text start="71.939" dur="5.131">should have had sixty years ago and what</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;m gonna do is go through three</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="6.15">different concepts with you guys now</text>
  <text start="80.159" dur="7.591">they&amp;#39;re all separate but they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="8.16">very linked as well and it all involves</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="6.15">a whole brand new system of physics and</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="4.29">essentially framework of science that</text>
  <text start="93.9" dur="3.929">we&amp;#39;re all gonna have to learn right</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of brainwashing</text>
  <text start="97.829" dur="3.421">that&amp;#39;s been going on from mainstream</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="5.91">science that we&amp;#39;re gonna have to unlearn</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="6.39">but of course I&amp;#39;m not a you know super</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="4.14">trained physicist by any means I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="4.83">giving you some rough basics in this</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="4.229">video although it this stuff extremely</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="2.939">fascinates me I&amp;#39;m gonna continue</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="5.041">researching it and get it getting better</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="6.271">at discussing the technicalities of it</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="4.77">all and a lot of other people out there</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="4.469">are far better at discussing the</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="3.899">technicalities of it so again you can</text>
  <text start="126.149" dur="4.381">check the description below this video</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="5.921">I&amp;#39;m gonna post some various links and</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="4.81">videos and articles where you can go</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="4.29">in you doing more research than what I</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="4.35">can just offer in this simple YouTube</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="5.58">video so let&amp;#39;s get into it</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="5.16">anti-gravity propulsion the first word</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="5.55">the first topic we&amp;#39;re going to go into</text>
  <text start="144.85" dur="7.86">is called electrogravitics now this term</text>
  <text start="148.78" dur="7.14">was invented by a man named T Townsend</text>
  <text start="152.71" dur="9.3">Brown Thomas Townsend Brown he was an</text>
  <text start="155.92" dur="9.84">inventor in the early 1900&amp;#39;s and he was</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="5.88">fascinated by Albert Einstein&amp;#39;s general</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="5.64">relativity theories but he knew there</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="5.4">was more to it right he figured there</text>
  <text start="171.4" dur="5.37">was some kind of link between</text>
  <text start="173.29" dur="5.1">electricity and gravity because he knew</text>
  <text start="176.77" dur="3.18">there was a link between matter and</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="3.96">gravity and there&amp;#39;s a link between</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="4.38">matter and electricity so thus there</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="6.27">needs to be a link between electricity</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="8.96">and gravity and he found that and the</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="6.78">term that was or I should say the</text>
  <text start="193.29" dur="4.24">scientific theory that was named after</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="4.35">him basically was called the B field</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="3.51">Brown effect called the B field Brown</text>
  <text start="199.75" dur="5.16">effect because he was working with</text>
  <text start="201.04" dur="5.34">another scientist named Paul B field and</text>
  <text start="204.91" dur="4.16">funny enough Paul B field was a</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="5.4">classmate of Albert Einstein&amp;#39;s and they</text>
  <text start="209.07" dur="4.75">derived this B field Brown effect</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="5.79">through various experiments with</text>
  <text start="213.82" dur="6.3">electricity and metal basically what T</text>
  <text start="217.57" dur="6.18">Townsend Brown and his cohort here found</text>
  <text start="220.12" dur="6.21">out was that when you charge basically</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="4.739">anything that can have an electric</text>
  <text start="226.33" dur="3.99">charge to it when you&amp;#39;ve put a</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="4.411">high-voltage electric traffic strong</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="7.62">electrostatic charge into that material</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="7.29">it can actually counter gravity and this</text>
  <text start="237.94" dur="5.28">led him to say that the universe is</text>
  <text start="240.19" dur="6.24">nothing more than an assemblage of</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="5.07">energy it&amp;#39;s pretty much an archetypal</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="5.64">understanding that all the best</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="6.6">scientists and especially physicists all</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="6.18">figured out everything is simply energy</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="5.31">the secrets of the universe is energy as</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="4.43">nikola tesla said right we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="4.29">discuss Tesla in a little bit here but</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.48">Thomas Townsend Brown now the</text>
  <text start="264.49" dur="6.9">experiments that he did he</text>
  <text start="267.16" dur="6.33">first had two small metal balls next to</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="4.35">each other and then he made one a</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="4.26">high-voltage positive charge and the</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="5.79">other one a negative charge which</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="5.43">actually caused a little bit of force to</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="5.07">go between them an unknown force to him</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="5.88">at the time so he that he found this and</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="4.41">then he started working with disks he</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="3.99">worked with of it larger disks he had</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="3.75">them tethered to a large pole and then</text>
  <text start="293.05" dur="3.66">when he did the electrostatic charge</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="5.16">into these disks they started flying</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="4.95">around and he actually it&amp;#39;s publicly</text>
  <text start="299.92" dur="3.72">known that he did this with very large</text>
  <text start="301.66" dur="4.74">discs and made them fly hundreds of</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="4.62">miles per hour this was just on public</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="3.15">record not any of the classified stuff</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="3.81">we don&amp;#39;t necessarily know about and you</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="3.93">can see my picture here of essentially a</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="4.14">flying saucer because that&amp;#39;s what he was</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="5.37">doing he was making flying saucers one</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.17">side would have the positive charge one</text>
  <text start="318.85" dur="4.01">side without negative charge and it</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="6.21">would move in the direction of whatever</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="6.43">positive charge there was and he</text>
  <text start="326.59" dur="7.35">actually patented this work in Britain</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="6.21">in 1928 a few years later he then came</text>
  <text start="333.94" dur="6.81">into America here and he was able to</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="6.6">patent his work in the u.s. in 1957 I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="340.75" dur="3.45">gonna have to kind of shift back and</text>
  <text start="342.1" dur="3.9">forth here for you guys so you can see</text>
  <text start="344.2" dur="4.05">it but anyway so this is literally</text>
  <text start="346" dur="5.22">patented you can go look up the name of</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="5.16">the patent so for anybody&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="6.18">anti-gravity is a pseudoscience or some</text>
  <text start="353.41" dur="7.08">kind of conspiracy they&amp;#39;re all and his</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="5.94">work ended up in the hands of the m.i.c</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="5.16">or the military-industrial complex in</text>
  <text start="363.34" dur="3.96">the 1950s they kind of caught wind of it</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="4.26">when he began patenting it he actually</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="6.27">made Thomas Townsend Brown made a</text>
  <text start="369.91" dur="7.17">proposal to the US Navy in the mid 50&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="7.05">now there&amp;#39;s some disagreements as to</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="7.25">what happened from there one theory is</text>
  <text start="380.62" dur="5.67">that the Navy actually had already</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="3.88">understood the secrets of anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="386.29" dur="4.14">had it in their black projects so they</text>
  <text start="388.21" dur="6">kind of shunned t Townsend Brown away</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="5.4">another theory is that they brought him</text>
  <text start="394.21" dur="3.3">into the classified projects but of</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="5.1">course he couldn&amp;#39;t publicly say what he</text>
  <text start="397.51" dur="5.879">was doing so we have some cover jobs</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="5.01">but consulted secretly for the US Navy</text>
  <text start="403.389" dur="4.59">but regardless his work went into the</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="4.41">hands of the military-industrial complex</text>
  <text start="407.979" dur="4.981">and they&amp;#39;ve had it ever since so</text>
  <text start="410.35" dur="5.34">understand the secrets of gravity have</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="4.65">been understood for decades they just</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="3.63">haven&amp;#39;t been given to us there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="417.61" dur="3.899">of reasons for that we won&amp;#39;t get into</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="6.75">those discussions here but they involve</text>
  <text start="421.509" dur="6.841">money power control yada yada so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.07" dur="5.159">the basics behind electrogravitics</text>
  <text start="428.35" dur="4.47">understand gravity is not what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.229" dur="3.511">told okay</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="4.14">all these mainstream scientists are</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="4.709">trying to find gravity through the use</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="4.769">of waves they&amp;#39;re trying to use the</text>
  <text start="439.449" dur="4.141">electromagnetic spectrum to put gravity</text>
  <text start="441.729" dur="4.831">on and we&amp;#39;ll discuss gravity a little</text>
  <text start="443.59" dur="5.329">bit more so later but gravity and</text>
  <text start="446.56" dur="4.65">electricity are opposites electric</text>
  <text start="448.919" dur="5.53">electromagnetic radiation is an outward</text>
  <text start="451.21" dur="5.37">force gravity is an inward force it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="454.449" dur="4.44">compressive force that&amp;#39;s moving into all</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="5.82">matter at all times to create it right</text>
  <text start="458.889" dur="5.521">and some scientists understood this yeah</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="3.75">Walter Russell out there who understood</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="4.439">that gravity and electricity are</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="5.04">opposites and another scientist named</text>
  <text start="468.849" dur="4.591">Dewey B Larsen who we&amp;#39;ll discuss in a</text>
  <text start="471.19" dur="4.11">few minutes here but that&amp;#39;s the basics</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="4.19">of electricity and gravity in their</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="4.95">relationship and that&amp;#39;s why he called it</text>
  <text start="477.63" dur="5.56">electrogravitics some researchers also</text>
  <text start="480.25" dur="5.18">call it electromagnetic wave it expand I</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="4.229">collect over vidiq such as simpler and</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="5.41">discusses the relationship how just</text>
  <text start="487.419" dur="6.331">their inter interconnected their so</text>
  <text start="490.84" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s the basics on that and also it</text>
  <text start="493.75" dur="6.57">goes to note that with like the flying</text>
  <text start="495.4" dur="5.28">saucers there&amp;#39;s no what do I want to say</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="4.95">here</text>
  <text start="500.68" dur="8.4">there&amp;#39;s no opposite reaction so for</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="6.329">instance when you have rocketry Rockets</text>
  <text start="509.08" dur="5.759">going up into space there&amp;#39;s an opposite</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="5.341">reaction to the thrust being made so you</text>
  <text start="514.839" dur="4.411">have a rocket going this way but you</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="4.709">have a huge force going the opposite</text>
  <text start="519.25" dur="4.5">direction right equal but opposite when</text>
  <text start="521.649" dur="2.88">it comes to this kind of concept playing</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="4.079">around with gravity</text>
  <text start="524.529" dur="6.531">there&amp;#39;s no opposite reaction so you can</text>
  <text start="527.829" dur="6.601">have this craft plot flying through and</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="7.71">there&amp;#39;s nothing going against it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="7.32">essentially moving with the ether and</text>
  <text start="538.77" dur="6.19">also it goes to note here this is why</text>
  <text start="541.75" dur="6.72">say secret space program crafts or ET</text>
  <text start="544.96" dur="5.37">crafts are very particular shapes they</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="3.78">have to either be in a saucer shape</text>
  <text start="550.33" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re in a triangle shape which we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="4.92">discuss in a sec sometimes they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="554.5" dur="4.92">cigar shape you&amp;#39;ll see because it&amp;#39;s as</text>
  <text start="557.17" dur="6.18">if they were suspended in a fluid right</text>
  <text start="559.42" dur="6.03">a lot of these quote pseudo-scientists a</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="4.23">lot of these alternative thinkers the</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="3.9">great thinkers they understand that</text>
  <text start="567.58" dur="5.09">there&amp;#39;s an ether there&amp;#39;s an ether that</text>
  <text start="569.35" dur="6.08">connects everything right and</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="5.26">electricity and gravity are simply</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="5.62">perturbations by that word right of this</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="5.76">ether so and it&amp;#39;s a fluid it&amp;#39;s a fluid</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="4.8">like medium so when you have these</text>
  <text start="583.69" dur="3.959">crafts that are beginning to counter</text>
  <text start="585.85" dur="3.299">gravity they have to essentially act as</text>
  <text start="587.649" dur="3.63">if they&amp;#39;re in a fluid so you have to</text>
  <text start="589.149" dur="4.171">just imagine the crafts in water right</text>
  <text start="591.279" dur="4.231">and if it doesn&amp;#39;t want to sink if you</text>
  <text start="593.32" dur="5.37">want to suspend that shape and water it</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="5.43">has to be buoyant so that&amp;#39;s why it has</text>
  <text start="598.69" dur="7.019">to be saucers or triangles or cigar</text>
  <text start="600.94" dur="6.649">shapes or rectangles or square type</text>
  <text start="605.709" dur="4.171">shapes when you&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="607.589" dur="5.171">anti-gravity craft because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="5.76">suspended any fluid like medium that is</text>
  <text start="612.76" dur="6.42">the ether okay moving on to number two</text>
  <text start="615.64" dur="7.11">now I want to discuss vortexing mercury</text>
  <text start="619.18" dur="6.51">or what&amp;#39;s also sometimes called magnetic</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="6.18">field disrupters or magnetic gravity</text>
  <text start="625.69" dur="7.56">cancellation but this basic technology</text>
  <text start="628.93" dur="6">is a little more advanced and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="5.73">little different than electrogravitics</text>
  <text start="634.93" dur="6.24">and it&amp;#39;s actually been around for a lot</text>
  <text start="638.98" dur="5.07">longer of a time so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="641.17" dur="5.88">discuss one secret space program craft</text>
  <text start="644.05" dur="7.02">called the tr-3b you&amp;#39;ll notice it over</text>
  <text start="647.05" dur="5.64">here in this shape it&amp;#39;s a black triangle</text>
  <text start="651.07" dur="4.32">sometimes it&amp;#39;s called a black triangle</text>
  <text start="652.69" dur="5.43">and we&amp;#39;re also going to discuss ancient</text>
  <text start="655.39" dur="5.58">Vimanas and that&amp;#39;s what I meant that</text>
  <text start="658.12" dur="6.089">this research this understanding I</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="4.95">should say esoteric research hidden</text>
  <text start="664.209" dur="2.67">science has been around for a long long</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="3.629">time</text>
  <text start="666.879" dur="6.841">it&amp;#39;s actually been around for thousands</text>
  <text start="669.549" dur="6.51">of years in ancient scriptures from the</text>
  <text start="673.72" dur="4.679">Vedas the Vedas are ancient Indian texts</text>
  <text start="676.059" dur="5.73">that describe these right here they were</text>
  <text start="678.399" dur="6.54">Vimanas and they essentially used a</text>
  <text start="681.789" dur="5.4">swirling mercury to counteract gravity</text>
  <text start="684.939" dur="4.2">with now I&amp;#39;m not too familiar with</text>
  <text start="687.189" dur="4.14">ancient Vedic texts but you can go</text>
  <text start="689.139" dur="5.01">familiar familiarize yourselves with</text>
  <text start="691.329" dur="5.28">them and see that this was very real and</text>
  <text start="694.149" dur="5.37">they were studied in there but I want a</text>
  <text start="696.609" dur="7.29">more focus on the tr-3b the black</text>
  <text start="699.519" dur="7.32">triangle so the tr-3b and actually both</text>
  <text start="703.899" dur="6.33">of these work around a mercury based</text>
  <text start="706.839" dur="6.3">plasma that&amp;#39;s pressurized and rotated</text>
  <text start="710.229" dur="5.34">around a circular ring so in the very</text>
  <text start="713.139" dur="4.95">middle of these craft tr-3b right in</text>
  <text start="715.569" dur="4.591">here and then you have the vimana they</text>
  <text start="718.089" dur="4.86">would actually have the swirling mercury</text>
  <text start="720.16" dur="6.75">right in the middle there when you</text>
  <text start="722.949" dur="8.07">pressurize and vortex mercury it creates</text>
  <text start="726.91" dur="7.069">a superconducting plasma and very highly</text>
  <text start="731.019" dur="5.13">charged electromagnetic fields and</text>
  <text start="733.979" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s called a magnetic field</text>
  <text start="736.149" dur="4.201">disruptor because this magnetic field</text>
  <text start="737.999" dur="5.471">creates essentially like I said an</text>
  <text start="740.35" dur="8.519">electromagnetic vortex that reduces all</text>
  <text start="743.47" dur="8.609">the mass within that that frame so say</text>
  <text start="748.869" dur="5.4">you have the plasma in the middle here</text>
  <text start="752.079" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;ll get that magnetic field</text>
  <text start="754.269" dur="3.51">disruption a ride around the outside of</text>
  <text start="756.609" dur="3.69">the craft same thing with the vimana</text>
  <text start="757.779" dur="8.25">here but it reduces all the weight</text>
  <text start="760.299" dur="9.84">within that vortex greatly a lot with</text>
  <text start="766.029" dur="7.2">the tr-3b this information comes by way</text>
  <text start="770.139" dur="7.62">of a whistleblower named Edgar Boosh</text>
  <text start="773.229" dur="8.22">fo you see each each Boosh it is the</text>
  <text start="777.759" dur="8.88">mass is canceled upwards of almost 90</text>
  <text start="781.449" dur="7.92">percent around that craft imagine 90</text>
  <text start="786.639" dur="4.74">percent right so I&amp;#39;m a hundred and</text>
  <text start="789.369" dur="5.37">seventy pounds if I only weighed ten</text>
  <text start="791.379" dur="6.69">percent of what I weigh 17 pounds and I</text>
  <text start="794.739" dur="5.04">still had the force that I do to be able</text>
  <text start="798.069" dur="2.82">to propel myself I&amp;#39;d be able to jump</text>
  <text start="799.779" dur="3.74">pretty darn high</text>
  <text start="800.889" dur="7.2">right and here&amp;#39;s the amazing thing</text>
  <text start="803.519" dur="6.34">anything in that bubble is corrected for</text>
  <text start="808.089" dur="4.98">the mass so they don&amp;#39;t feel the g-forces</text>
  <text start="809.859" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s how these craft can shoot across</text>
  <text start="813.069" dur="3.87">the sky at literally thousands and</text>
  <text start="815.049" dur="3.45">thousands of miles an hour and the</text>
  <text start="816.939" dur="3.601">pilots inside the craft they don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="818.499" dur="7.56">the g-forces the g-forces are corrected</text>
  <text start="820.54" dur="6.989">as well and that also being said I just</text>
  <text start="826.059" dur="2.94">had a question a little earlier today</text>
  <text start="827.529" dur="3.96">somebody asked me about the Van Allen</text>
  <text start="828.999" dur="4.62">belts they said oh you know if they go</text>
  <text start="831.489" dur="3.93">you know craft go out into space how do</text>
  <text start="833.619" dur="3.78">they deal with the highly charged</text>
  <text start="835.419" dur="4.44">particles of the van and Van Allen belt</text>
  <text start="837.399" dur="3.9">hitting the craft and I said well you</text>
  <text start="839.859" dur="3.39">know a lot of these crafts have</text>
  <text start="841.299" dur="5.25">electromagnetic propulsion systems that</text>
  <text start="843.249" dur="4.8">create a vortex around the craft so</text>
  <text start="846.549" dur="2.37">they&amp;#39;re essentially shielded from it so</text>
  <text start="848.049" dur="4.051">that&amp;#39;s kind of an answer to that</text>
  <text start="848.919" dur="5.34">question and it also goes to note before</text>
  <text start="852.1" dur="4.529">we move on to the last one here is that</text>
  <text start="854.259" dur="5.57">you can actually combine these two</text>
  <text start="856.629" dur="6.51">concepts so if you have a vortexing</text>
  <text start="859.829" dur="5.47">mercury magnetic field disruptor here</text>
  <text start="863.139" dur="4.8">magnetic gravity canceller you can</text>
  <text start="865.299" dur="5.85">reduce the mass of the craft by 90</text>
  <text start="867.939" dur="5.06">percent and shoot out imagine that you</text>
  <text start="871.149" dur="4.141">could probably do even more than that</text>
  <text start="872.999" dur="3.49">depending on the technology this is just</text>
  <text start="875.29" dur="3.479">the information that we have readily</text>
  <text start="876.489" dur="5.491">readily available to us right now but</text>
  <text start="878.769" dur="6.9">imagine you canceled the mass by 90% and</text>
  <text start="881.98" dur="4.949">then you put some electro vidiq systems</text>
  <text start="885.669" dur="4.71">onto that craft</text>
  <text start="886.929" dur="5.75">well this 90% mass reduced and then you</text>
  <text start="890.379" dur="5.851">have a high electrostatic charge</text>
  <text start="892.679" dur="6.85">propelling that craft forward that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="896.23" dur="5.459">gonna go pretty darn fast because also</text>
  <text start="899.529" dur="5.581">it goes to note that I forgot to say up</text>
  <text start="901.689" dur="7.76">with this one the idea of</text>
  <text start="905.11" dur="8.059">electrogravitics this topic can provide</text>
  <text start="909.449" dur="8.08">thousands of times more thrust than</text>
  <text start="913.169" dur="6.01">rocket propelled craft can not only</text>
  <text start="917.529" dur="3.24">maybe even hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="919.179" dur="4.68">times I think it was said you look you</text>
  <text start="920.769" dur="5.34">can look into dr. paul la Villette swart</text>
  <text start="923.859" dur="3.72">he was a studier of T Townes Brown he</text>
  <text start="926.109" dur="4.08">has a good book called the secrets to</text>
  <text start="927.579" dur="4.35">anti-gravity and I believe he said it</text>
  <text start="930.189" dur="2.26">can be like 10,000 even a hundred</text>
  <text start="931.929" dur="3">thousand</text>
  <text start="932.449" dur="7.021">times more thrust so if you can have</text>
  <text start="934.929" dur="7.421">10,000 times more thrust than a rocket</text>
  <text start="939.47" dur="6.57">on a craft and then reduce the mass of</text>
  <text start="942.35" dur="7.709">the craft by 90% well let me tell you</text>
  <text start="946.04" dur="6.69">the secret space programs that the</text>
  <text start="950.059" dur="4.921">military-industrial complex has they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="952.73" dur="5.669">been to Mars already this is how they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="954.98" dur="6.12">done it so we went over electrogravitics</text>
  <text start="958.399" dur="6.29">we went over for texting mercury now I</text>
  <text start="961.1" dur="6.479">want to get into the last one called</text>
  <text start="964.689" dur="4.81">temporal technologies and temple temple</text>
  <text start="967.579" dur="4.29">world basically just meaning time</text>
  <text start="969.499" dur="5.101">altering now of course this one is the</text>
  <text start="971.869" dur="4.59">most theoretical but there is an amazing</text>
  <text start="974.6" dur="5.88">amount of research out there to show</text>
  <text start="976.459" dur="9.03">that technology&amp;#39;s altering time and</text>
  <text start="980.48" dur="6.389">space and space and time I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="985.489" dur="4.171">about the distinctions between those two</text>
  <text start="986.869" dur="5.19">in a sec here are absolutely real time</text>
  <text start="989.66" dur="4.679">is not what we time is not what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="992.059" dur="2.61">told just like gravity is not what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="994.339" dur="2.19">told</text>
  <text start="994.669" dur="4.08">right mainstream science has a lot of</text>
  <text start="996.529" dur="4.23">stuff ass-backwards and a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="998.749" dur="4.32">they really can&amp;#39;t answer these days this</text>
  <text start="1000.759" dur="3.66">is why this whole you know evolution of</text>
  <text start="1003.069" dur="3.87">consciousness that&amp;#39;s going on is so</text>
  <text start="1004.419" dur="5.16">exciting because all of us get to</text>
  <text start="1006.939" dur="3.84">relearn all of us so this is you know</text>
  <text start="1009.579" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s why I love doing these whiteboard</text>
  <text start="1010.779" dur="4.56">videos and educating you guys is because</text>
  <text start="1013.209" dur="3.96">I have to educate myself doing them and</text>
  <text start="1015.339" dur="6.09">then we all learn together right super</text>
  <text start="1017.169" dur="6.51">fun but anyway where was I temporal</text>
  <text start="1021.429" dur="4.53">technology&amp;#39;s time altering technologies</text>
  <text start="1023.679" dur="3.15">so that&amp;#39;s where it was time time is not</text>
  <text start="1025.959" dur="3.421">what we&amp;#39;re told</text>
  <text start="1026.829" dur="5.25">right we&amp;#39;re told time is linear you have</text>
  <text start="1029.38" dur="5.159">a straight line you have forward in the</text>
  <text start="1032.079" dur="6.75">future back in the past then you have</text>
  <text start="1034.539" dur="8.13">right now right if you&amp;#39;re familiar with</text>
  <text start="1038.829" dur="8.911">that quote of former Lockheed skunkworks</text>
  <text start="1042.669" dur="6.841">director Ben rich Ben rich you know</text>
  <text start="1047.74" dur="4.789">towards the end of his career when he</text>
  <text start="1049.51" dur="6.09">would give speeches to groups of people</text>
  <text start="1052.529" dur="5.951">he would often you know towards the very</text>
  <text start="1055.6" dur="4.74">end he would start joking and in some of</text>
  <text start="1058.48" dur="3.569">his presentations at the very last slide</text>
  <text start="1060.34" dur="4.5">he would put a picture of a flying</text>
  <text start="1062.049" dur="3.99">saucer going out into space and he would</text>
  <text start="1064.84" dur="5.01">say that we already had the technology</text>
  <text start="1066.039" dur="7.711">to take e.t home and he would say that</text>
  <text start="1069.85" dur="5.579">the you know these questions have</text>
  <text start="1073.75" dur="4.559">already been answered somebody asked him</text>
  <text start="1075.429" dur="5.041">one time they asked him how is that</text>
  <text start="1078.309" dur="5.401">possible I believe it was Jan Harz end</text>
  <text start="1080.47" dur="5.43">the MUFON director I think he asked been</text>
  <text start="1083.71" dur="3.719">rich he goes how&amp;#39;s this possible are all</text>
  <text start="1085.9" dur="4.139">points in space and time connected and</text>
  <text start="1087.429" dur="4.021">been rich said exactly and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1090.039" dur="4.321">it is all points in space and time are</text>
  <text start="1091.45" dur="5.88">connected time is not linear right time</text>
  <text start="1094.36" dur="6">is three-dimensional just like space</text>
  <text start="1097.33" dur="9.42">space is three-dimensional and this is</text>
  <text start="1100.36" dur="8.22">that very theoretical but also what I</text>
  <text start="1106.75" dur="3.36">want to say here it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s far</text>
  <text start="1108.58" dur="3.39">different than anything we&amp;#39;ve ever been</text>
  <text start="1110.11" dur="3.84">told is and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="1111.97" dur="4.439">kind of grasp but if you&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="1113.95" dur="4.349">movie interstellar that was a good kind</text>
  <text start="1116.409" dur="3.63">of primer as to these kind of concepts</text>
  <text start="1118.299" dur="4.681">when spoiler alert</text>
  <text start="1120.039" dur="5.551">earmuffs if you need to when was it</text>
  <text start="1122.98" dur="5.329">Matthew McConaughey was at the very end</text>
  <text start="1125.59" dur="5.309">of the movie when he went into that</text>
  <text start="1128.309" dur="4.301">wormhole I believe and then he was kind</text>
  <text start="1130.899" dur="5.16">of looking around and he was able to see</text>
  <text start="1132.61" dur="5.72">different timelines and this was a very</text>
  <text start="1136.059" dur="5.431">good representation of time being</text>
  <text start="1138.33" dur="5.8">three-dimensional and to understand this</text>
  <text start="1141.49" dur="5.52">a little bit more so I want to refer you</text>
  <text start="1144.13" dur="4.769">to the work of Dewey B Larson I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="1147.01" dur="5.25">some videos on Dewey B Larson in the</text>
  <text start="1148.899" dur="6.421">past and we&amp;#39;ll continue to do them also</text>
  <text start="1152.26" dur="4.44">discuss that in the secret space program</text>
  <text start="1155.32" dur="4.109">webinar I have coming up but do we be</text>
  <text start="1156.7" dur="5.579">Lars and it&amp;#39;s been said that his his</text>
  <text start="1159.429" dur="5.071">scientific work his theory that he</text>
  <text start="1162.279" dur="6.601">called the reciprocal systems theory is</text>
  <text start="1164.5" dur="7.38">the closest theory we have to reality to</text>
  <text start="1168.88" dur="6.029">the actual way the universe crazily</text>
  <text start="1171.88" dur="6.11">enough works and his reciprocal Systems</text>
  <text start="1174.909" dur="5.161">Theory he was another one that said</text>
  <text start="1177.99" dur="4.99">electricity and gravity are reciprocals</text>
  <text start="1180.07" dur="5.04">but also he said that space and time</text>
  <text start="1182.98" dur="7.699">were reciprocals hence reciprocal system</text>
  <text start="1185.11" dur="10.23">theory and in essence what he proposed</text>
  <text start="1190.679" dur="5.441">was that there are two different realms</text>
  <text start="1195.34" dur="2.69">of existence</text>
  <text start="1196.12" dur="3.11">essentially a physical real</text>
  <text start="1198.03" dur="3.84">which is what we&amp;#39;re residing in right</text>
  <text start="1199.23" dur="5.49">now and a metaphysical side of things or</text>
  <text start="1201.87" dur="6.12">what he termed a material realm right</text>
  <text start="1204.72" dur="7.46">here that we&amp;#39;re in and a cosmic sector</text>
  <text start="1207.99" dur="8.09">and the material sector is when you have</text>
  <text start="1212.18" dur="7.03">matter moving below the speed of light</text>
  <text start="1216.08" dur="4.87">and the cosmic sector is when you have</text>
  <text start="1219.21" dur="4.5">stuff stuff moving faster than the speed</text>
  <text start="1220.95" dur="5.64">of light so right here we have speed of</text>
  <text start="1223.71" dur="6.66">light and right now we are in the</text>
  <text start="1226.59" dur="6.42">material sector M which is where space</text>
  <text start="1230.37" dur="4.8">is three-dimensional and time is one</text>
  <text start="1233.01" dur="4.68">dimensional right so we have three</text>
  <text start="1235.17" dur="4.47">dimensions of space left right front</text>
  <text start="1237.69" dur="4.1">back up down but time is only one</text>
  <text start="1239.64" dur="5.94">dimensional we have a future now and</text>
  <text start="1241.79" dur="6.37">past so this is this is important</text>
  <text start="1245.58" dur="4.38">because a lot of people say there is you</text>
  <text start="1248.16" dur="3.96">know five dimension six dimensions all</text>
  <text start="1249.96" dur="4.17">that stuff I don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree I</text>
  <text start="1252.12" dur="3.48">think there&amp;#39;s only three dimensions but</text>
  <text start="1254.13" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s multiple different densities</text>
  <text start="1255.6" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s multiple different ways that</text>
  <text start="1257.76" dur="4.08">energy can be condensed to form</text>
  <text start="1259.86" dur="2.46">different planes of existence see what</text>
  <text start="1261.84" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="1262.32" dur="4.89">another long tangent that I will not go</text>
  <text start="1264.93" dur="4.62">into but anyway we have material realm</text>
  <text start="1267.21" dur="4.35">3d space 1d time then we have the cosmic</text>
  <text start="1269.55" dur="4.47">sector that I mentioned cosmic sector is</text>
  <text start="1271.56" dur="6.99">when you have three dimensional time and</text>
  <text start="1274.02" dur="5.1">one dimensional space right and remember</text>
  <text start="1278.55" dur="2.4">what I said</text>
  <text start="1279.12" dur="3.21">speed of light is that boundary between</text>
  <text start="1280.95" dur="4.26">the two sometimes it&amp;#39;s called the</text>
  <text start="1282.33" dur="4.8">crossing point of light the speed of</text>
  <text start="1285.21" dur="5.13">light can also vary depending where you</text>
  <text start="1287.13" dur="6.48">are in the galaxy but mind you so when</text>
  <text start="1290.34" dur="6.06">you have a craft that you electrify and</text>
  <text start="1293.61" dur="6.87">you create a high-energy electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="1296.4" dur="6.59">field around what does that do that</text>
  <text start="1300.48" dur="4.92">makes all the particles in that craft</text>
  <text start="1302.99" dur="5.26">vibrate very freakin high and they</text>
  <text start="1305.4" dur="5.04">vibrate past that crossing point of</text>
  <text start="1308.25" dur="5.85">light which is why when you delve into</text>
  <text start="1310.44" dur="6">researching UFOs and TR 3ds and you know</text>
  <text start="1314.1" dur="5.25">by UFOs I mean the man-made and the et</text>
  <text start="1316.44" dur="5.1">kind a lot of times they just look like</text>
  <text start="1319.35" dur="4.53">a big ol plasma ball right they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1321.54" dur="3.63">even look like a physical material craft</text>
  <text start="1323.88" dur="3.75">and that&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="1325.17" dur="4.68">material craft there D materializing</text>
  <text start="1327.63" dur="4.32">because that craft is being put into an</text>
  <text start="1329.85" dur="5.16">electromagnetic bubble</text>
  <text start="1331.95" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s uh canceling gravity it&amp;#39;s moving</text>
  <text start="1335.01" dur="4.05">that craft past the crossing point of</text>
  <text start="1337.11" dur="5.31">light into the cosmic sector where it</text>
  <text start="1339.06" dur="4.83">can now navigate through time now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1342.42" dur="3.42">not going to get into the discussion of</text>
  <text start="1343.89" dur="6.35">that because navigating time is a very</text>
  <text start="1345.84" dur="7.08">tricky thing to do of course but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1350.24" dur="4.81">absolutely possible and it has been done</text>
  <text start="1352.92" dur="5.94">you can look into research on the</text>
  <text start="1355.05" dur="5.73">Philadelphia Experiment which a lot of</text>
  <text start="1358.86" dur="5.49">Nikola Tesla&amp;#39;s work I believe went into</text>
  <text start="1360.78" dur="6.02">and oddly enough I heard that a lot of</text>
  <text start="1364.35" dur="3.66">wilheimer Ike&amp;#39;s research you know the</text>
  <text start="1366.8" dur="2.95">psychoanalyst</text>
  <text start="1368.01" dur="3.03">oddly enough wilheimer Ike&amp;#39;s research</text>
  <text start="1369.75" dur="3.51">went to the Philadelphia Experiment</text>
  <text start="1371.04" dur="5.34">especially a lot of his stuff on cloud</text>
  <text start="1373.26" dur="7.11">busting technology not to be more out to</text>
  <text start="1376.38" dur="6.99">do more research on that and also along</text>
  <text start="1380.37" dur="4.44">with the Philadelphia Experiment ODIs</text>
  <text start="1383.37" dur="4.29">car you can look into</text>
  <text start="1384.81" dur="6.42">speaking of nikola tesla he was actually</text>
  <text start="1387.66" dur="6.06">a protege of Nikola Tesla so when Nikola</text>
  <text start="1391.23" dur="5.34">Tesla used to live in New York for a</text>
  <text start="1393.72" dur="6.03">brief period he lived in a hotel and in</text>
  <text start="1396.57" dur="6.09">this hotel one of the workers in the</text>
  <text start="1399.75" dur="5.12">hotel who was Otis Carr befriended Tesla</text>
  <text start="1402.66" dur="4.65">and was fascinated with his research and</text>
  <text start="1404.87" dur="6.01">Tesla then confided a lot of his</text>
  <text start="1407.31" dur="5.49">research in todas car and in the 50s</text>
  <text start="1410.88" dur="3.9">owned his car took Tesla&amp;#39;s research and</text>
  <text start="1412.8" dur="5.16">built literally his own spacecraft he</text>
  <text start="1414.78" dur="5.34">wanted to build a civilian-led Space</text>
  <text start="1417.96" dur="4.26">Agency essentially he won he didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1420.12" dur="3.81">to deal with the military the government</text>
  <text start="1422.22" dur="5.81">all that jazz he wanted to build</text>
  <text start="1423.93" dur="6.84">literally his own spacefaring company</text>
  <text start="1428.03" dur="5.26">now of course of course oldest car got</text>
  <text start="1430.77" dur="4.5">shut down for that and refueled and</text>
  <text start="1433.29" dur="3.51">suppressed and whatnot but his craft</text>
  <text start="1435.27" dur="3.75">that he built the build one it was a</text>
  <text start="1436.8" dur="4.77">flying saucer shaped craft with the same</text>
  <text start="1439.02" dur="5.73">kind of concept with rotating</text>
  <text start="1441.57" dur="4.5">electromagnetic fields counter-rotating</text>
  <text start="1444.75" dur="3.24">electromagnetic fields let me specify</text>
  <text start="1446.07" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s important so we had counter</text>
  <text start="1447.99" dur="5.28">rotating electromagnetic fields around</text>
  <text start="1449.37" dur="8.61">the saucer craft it created anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="1453.27" dur="8.64">lift but this craft also navigated time</text>
  <text start="1457.98" dur="6.41">and it&amp;#39;s been said by a man who worked</text>
  <text start="1461.91" dur="3.69">with Otis Carr his name was Ralph ring I</text>
  <text start="1464.39" dur="3.31">know</text>
  <text start="1465.6" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s a lot of names and a lot of info</text>
  <text start="1467.7" dur="2.16">I&amp;#39;m trying to blabber out to you in this</text>
  <text start="1469.26" dur="4.799">video</text>
  <text start="1469.86" dur="5.939">Ralph ring and you can actually look I</text>
  <text start="1474.059" dur="4.261">believe Ralph&amp;#39;s ring is still alive and</text>
  <text start="1475.799" dur="5.671">he&amp;#39;s got plenty of great talks on</text>
  <text start="1478.32" dur="4.17">YouTube Ralph&amp;#39;s ring was a man who</text>
  <text start="1481.47" dur="4.199">worked without his car</text>
  <text start="1482.49" dur="5.46">actually flew in ODIs cars crapped and</text>
  <text start="1485.669" dur="4.771">he said that when they flew and came</text>
  <text start="1487.95" dur="5.64">back they actually completely lost track</text>
  <text start="1490.44" dur="6.869">of time and actually funny enough ODIs</text>
  <text start="1493.59" dur="6.12">cars craft involved consciousness</text>
  <text start="1497.309" dur="6.931">interface technology so I actually used</text>
  <text start="1499.71" dur="7.65">crystals crystals in the makeup of it</text>
  <text start="1504.24" dur="6.299">and in the systems so the consciousness</text>
  <text start="1507.36" dur="5.059">of the human was able to interface with</text>
  <text start="1510.539" dur="5.401">this crystal and that&amp;#39;s how it moved in</text>
  <text start="1512.419" dur="6.49">basics but it actually could traverse</text>
  <text start="1515.94" dur="4.44">time only of course link particles down</text>
  <text start="1518.909" dur="2.071">below if you don&amp;#39;t believe me you can go</text>
  <text start="1520.38" dur="3.06">look at it</text>
  <text start="1520.98" dur="5.88">and very real though right consciousness</text>
  <text start="1523.44" dur="6.869">is crucial in understanding the reality</text>
  <text start="1526.86" dur="5.79">of the world reality of the universe so</text>
  <text start="1530.309" dur="6.931">that&amp;#39;s basically all I wanted to go over</text>
  <text start="1532.65" dur="7.38">with you guys I hope I had enough</text>
  <text start="1537.24" dur="6.39">clarity going through this all in this</text>
  <text start="1540.03" dur="5.19">video and I hope it was interesting let</text>
  <text start="1543.63" dur="3.87">me tell you this stuff fascinates me</text>
  <text start="1545.22" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s why I was so high energy and just</text>
  <text start="1547.5" dur="5.07">blablabla all this information at you</text>
  <text start="1549.78" dur="4.74">guys and I hope it was I hope I had it</text>
  <text start="1552.57" dur="5.339">correct you know like I said I am NOT</text>
  <text start="1554.52" dur="6.48">any kind of heavily trained physicist</text>
  <text start="1557.909" dur="4.861">I&amp;#39;m only 27 year old college dropout but</text>
  <text start="1561" dur="3.74">trying to educate myself with all of</text>
  <text start="1562.77" dur="4.47">this and heck maybe even build my own</text>
  <text start="1564.74" dur="4.9">flying saucer one of these days with</text>
  <text start="1567.24" dur="4.559">some team Townsend Brown Nikola Tesla</text>
  <text start="1569.64" dur="4.98">research right that&amp;#39;s what we need to</text>
  <text start="1571.799" dur="4.26">get doing enough talk now it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="1574.62" dur="3.929">action right actually learning this</text>
  <text start="1576.059" dur="4.411">stuff and building it so in the future</text>
  <text start="1578.549" dur="3.831">you know one of these days be pretty</text>
  <text start="1580.47" dur="4.079">neat but anyway just let you know</text>
  <text start="1582.38" dur="4.39">anti-gravity is real it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1584.549" dur="4.291">suppressed for a very long time but I</text>
  <text start="1586.77" dur="6.06">feel that very soon it&amp;#39;s gonna be coming</text>
  <text start="1588.84" dur="6.78">out to humanity and heck man I think</text>
  <text start="1592.83" dur="6.089">within my lifetime I&amp;#39;ll be very easily</text>
  <text start="1595.62" dur="5.03">able to travel to distant worlds have a</text>
