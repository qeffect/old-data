  <text start="72.33" dur="4.74">rampant everywhere and now let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="75.03" dur="4.26">into talking about queue so we had four</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="5.82">posts yesterday we&amp;#39;re gonna begin with</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="6.36">the first one $24.99 queue says</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="4.92">everything stated has a purpose think</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="3.539">timing of the tweet above that&amp;#39;s Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.81" dur="3.57">tweet here the queue blinked we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="89.189" dur="4.86">about that in a sec versus the last</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="5.01">drops regarding Maggie a reporter from</text>
  <text start="94.049" dur="5.041">the New York Times regarding WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="5.97">drops about Maggie and then regarding</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="5.19">WikiLeaks attacks on queue will also</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="3.96">talk about about that in a sec here but</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="4.83">first let&amp;#39;s discuss Trump&amp;#39;s tweet and</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s this one here so queue linking</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="5.28">this tweet that says Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="4.95">donations drop forty two percent which</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="3.21">shows that they illegally played the</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="4.14">power game pay to play</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="5.879">absolutely and that forty two percent is</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="4.739">just over the last one year it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.711">ninety percent over the last three years</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="5.22">forty two percent over just the last</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="5.34">year so because the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="5.311">can no longer play nobody wants to pay</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="4.65">quite obvious now let&amp;#39;s move on to</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="4.59">talking about WikiLeaks attacks on cue</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="5.04">so yesterday WikiLeaks took to Twitter</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="5.939">to put out a few tweets attacking cue</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="5.73">and attacking the cue non-movement this</text>
  <text start="146.069" dur="4.861">one retweeting Joe shoutout to Joe storm</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="4.92">is upon us Joe</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="5.12">tweeted about Julian Assange saying that</text>
  <text start="153.87" dur="5.55">his indictment is important and</text>
  <text start="156.05" dur="5.59">necessary discovery brings it all down</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="2.789">Assange is the star witness against the</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="3.9">deep state</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="6.601">so WikiLeaks retweeting Joe&amp;#39;s tweet and</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="5.82">trying to throw shade on the quote q and</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="4.649">on topic calling it the Kuna Network I</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="4.349">don&amp;#39;t exactly know what the Kuna Network</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="4.621">means again WikiLeaks here is just</text>
  <text start="175.709" dur="6.661">really muddying the waters putting out a</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="7.35">little bit of misinformation to sway</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="6.18">people the wrong way and in regards to</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="5.67">WikiLeaks I mean there&amp;#39;s been a huge</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="5.1">change with that platform over the last</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="4.77">couple of years the WikiLeaks of 2016</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="4.649">that was putting out Podesta&amp;#39;s emails</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="4.29">and stuff like that that was some</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="4.651">hardcore stuff but the WikiLeaks that we</text>
  <text start="200.16" dur="3.51">see now is much different than that</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="3.78">WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="6.51">two years ago and in my opinion I think</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="5.729">either WikiLeaks or the website has been</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="3.99">compromised by some sort of faction of</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="4.891">the deep state we can actually reference</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="6.599">aq post from back in June they made a</text>
  <text start="217.35" dur="6.6">drop that said you may have the site but</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="6.181">we have the source very cryptic but if</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="4.8">you bring it in terms of WikiLeaks it</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="4.08">actually makes sense you have the site</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="4.41">meaning could be the CIA or some other</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="4.23">faction has compromised the WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="5.43">organization and the website but Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="6.18">saying we have the source as in a white</text>
  <text start="238.59" dur="5.7">hat group close to Trump has connection</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="5.25">to or even has Julian Assange themselves</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="4.83">so we you have the site we have the</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="5.37">source I think WikiLeaks is now deep</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="5.7">state asset Q then saying do you believe</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="5.459">in coincidences be extremely vigilant in</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="4.71">December lots of stuff is about to hit</text>
  <text start="257.519" dur="4.89">right and there&amp;#39;s all sorts of attacks</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="6.389">regarding q but we&amp;#39;re waiting for the</text>
  <text start="262.409" dur="5.641">testimony from Comey from lynch we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="3.661">waiting for that Giuliana saw</text>
  <text start="268.05" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re waiting for I believe even Hillary</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="3.6">Clinton to testify regarding her emails</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="4.229">and then of course Hubert Hubert</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="4.769">testifying which I believe is a public</text>
  <text start="275.729" dur="3.93">hearing now on December 5th a lot of</text>
  <text start="277.949" dur="4.171">stuff dropping even just that first week</text>

  <text start="311.159" dur="4.081">of people flipped during that time and</text>
  <text start="313.169" dur="4.771">like April or May it was like that and a</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="4.59">bunch of people just went anti Q it was</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="4.319">pretty obvious to see that now that was</text>

  <text start="488.549" dur="5.7">the next couple weeks they are now put</text>
  <text start="492.569" dur="3.66">on blast they&amp;#39;re put on notice because</text>
  <text start="494.249" dur="4.23">they have no idea when this FISA is</text>
  <text start="496.229" dur="4.23">going to be released so if it&amp;#39;s released</text>
  <text start="498.479" dur="3.03">before their testimony well crap there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.459" dur="3.63">gonna be a lot of stuff they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="501.509" dur="4.71">have to answer to right if the files it</text>
  <text start="504.089" dur="4.14">gets released after their testimony well</text>
  <text start="506.219" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s pretty much gonna blow the door</text>
  <text start="508.229" dur="4.56">open for perjury charges so it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="510.869" dur="4.26">guessing game now q and Trump are</text>
  <text start="512.789" dur="5.25">basically letting them hook themselves</text>
  <text start="515.129" dur="5.19">bait and hook themselves so Comey and</text>
  <text start="518.039" dur="5.34">Lynch are in a complete pickle here and</text>
  <text start="520.319" dur="4.411">that&amp;#39;s why Comey is calling for a public</text>
  <text start="523.379" dur="3.81">testimony he wants to testify publicly</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="3.24">he does want he does not want it behind</text>
  <text start="527.189" dur="2.7">closed doors</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="3.959">because if commis testimony was behind</text>
  <text start="529.889" dur="4.74">closed doors then they could ask him</text>
  <text start="531.929" dur="3.001">about classified things you see and he</text>
  <text start="534.629" dur="3.841">would have</text>
  <text start="534.93" dur="6.21">to answer to them now that he&amp;#39;s calling</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="4.92">for a public testimony they can&amp;#39;t ask</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="3.84">him about classified things with public</text>
  <text start="543.39" dur="4.83">hearings that&amp;#39;s the only reason that</text>
  <text start="544.98" dur="5.1">he&amp;#39;s claiming to want public testimony</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s not for openness and transparency</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s actually in fact so Comey can hide</text>
  <text start="552.57" dur="4.829">more things you see so very interested</text>
  <text start="556.44" dur="3">to see when this files a</text>
  <text start="557.399" dur="4.261">declassification is coming but it is</text>
  <text start="559.44" dur="4.769">coming and it&amp;#39;s just all dependent on</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="5.67">those bad actors and what they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="694.11" dur="4.38">so now let&amp;#39;s talk spaceforce</text>
  <text start="696.3" dur="4.89">so right here I found this in recent</text>
  <text start="698.49" dur="5.09">days it says despite air force concerns</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="5.34">Pentagon says the space force is</text>
  <text start="703.58" dur="5.11">affordable so on November 15th the</text>
  <text start="706.53" dur="3.75">Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick</text>
  <text start="708.69" dur="3.78">Shanahan the number two with the DoD</text>
  <text start="710.28" dur="4.35">said that the cost for the space force</text>
  <text start="712.47" dur="4.41">would actually be in the single digits</text>
  <text start="714.63" dur="5.07">could be lower than five billion even</text>
  <text start="716.88" dur="5.34">around two to three billion not the 13</text>
  <text start="719.7" dur="4.71">billion that the Air Force is trying to</text>
  <text start="722.22" dur="3.96">claim that the space force is going to</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="4.89">cost so this brings up an interesting</text>
  <text start="726.18" dur="7.17">fight for the space force the Air Force</text>
  <text start="729.3" dur="5.97">as per a leaked leaked memo from the Air</text>
  <text start="733.35" dur="3.51">Force secretary said that the space</text>
  <text start="735.27" dur="3.51">force is gonna cost thirteen billion</text>
  <text start="736.86" dur="3.57">dollars and people were saying oh my</text>
  <text start="738.78" dur="3.57">gosh it&amp;#39;s gonna cost a lot of money we</text>
  <text start="740.43" dur="4.05">shouldn&amp;#39;t have the space force right I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="6.24">actually curious how that memo actually</text>
  <text start="744.48" dur="6.24">leaked right and then we have the deputy</text>
  <text start="748.59" dur="4.56">Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick</text>
  <text start="750.72" dur="4.74">Shanahan saying that the space force is</text>
  <text start="753.15" dur="5.34">actually gonna be much much cheaper than</text>
  <text start="755.46" dur="5.58">that like 20% of the estimated Air Force</text>
  <text start="758.49" dur="4.77">cost of it so this shows you that there</text>
  <text start="761.04" dur="3.54">are some elements in the Air Force that</text>
  <text start="763.26" dur="3.03">don&amp;#39;t want to give up their space</text>
  <text start="764.58" dur="3.75">command why don&amp;#39;t they want to give up</text>
  <text start="766.29" dur="5.51">their space command well they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="768.33" dur="6.45">their shiny secret toys disclosed their</text>
  <text start="771.8" dur="7.06">technologies disclosed things like that</text>
  <text start="774.78" dur="7.62">you see so the space force is much more</text>
  <text start="778.86" dur="5.13">than what it seems what a lot of people</text>
  <text start="782.4" dur="3.92">think it to be it goes much deeper than</text>
  <text start="783.99" dur="5.3">that it&amp;#39;s about gaining access and</text>
  <text start="786.32" dur="6.07">disclosing many secretly held</text>
  <text start="789.29" dur="5.62">technologies and literally spacecraft</text>
  <text start="792.39" dur="4.02">that have already been built so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="794.91" dur="4.31">something I wanted to make note of and</text>
  <text start="796.41" dur="6.27">speaking of space this is interesting</text>
  <text start="799.22" dur="5.23">Russia their top space official we</text>
  <text start="802.68" dur="5.46">joking that a proposed mission will</text>
  <text start="804.45" dur="7.68">quote verify the moon landings by the US</text>
  <text start="808.14" dur="5.13">now moon landings right huge topic a lot</text>
  <text start="812.13" dur="2.519">of people out there thinking they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="813.27" dur="4.77">fake all the moon landings are</text>
  <text start="814.649" dur="6.651">completely fake me personally looking</text>
  <text start="818.04" dur="5.07">into it based upon my research and</text>
  <text start="821.3" dur="4.72">discussions and things like that</text>
  <text start="823.11" dur="6.57">I think the Apollo missions did land on</text>
  <text start="826.02" dur="6.21">the moon but I don&amp;#39;t think what NASA was</text>
  <text start="829.68" dur="4.86">telling us about those NASA missions are</text>
  <text start="832.23" dur="3.87">truthful I&amp;#39;m not buying the official</text>
  <text start="834.54" dur="3.06">narrative but I still believe that we</text>
  <text start="836.1" dur="3.21">did land on the moon what I think</text>
  <text start="837.6" dur="3.84">happened is that the astronauts that</text>
  <text start="839.31" dur="4.649">landed on the moon encountered many</text>
  <text start="841.44" dur="5.79">things they did not expect and that NASA</text>
  <text start="843.959" dur="6.451">wanted to keep covered up such as seen</text>
  <text start="847.23" dur="4.919">craft sink structures on the moon being</text>
  <text start="850.41" dur="4.65">greeted by craft when the Apollo</text>
  <text start="852.149" dur="6">astronauts landed then they switched</text>
  <text start="855.06" dur="6.48">over to more secure communications you</text>
  <text start="858.149" dur="4.891">know so why the fake moon landing stuff</text>
  <text start="861.54" dur="3.63">is put out there muddy the waters</text>
  <text start="863.04" dur="3.6">misinformed dissing form I still think</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="4.23">we got to the moon but I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="866.64" dur="4.8">think we were told about everything that</text>
  <text start="869.4" dur="3.48">occurred when those Apollo astronauts</text>
  <text start="871.44" dur="2.85">landed on the moon and then we could</text>
  <text start="872.88" dur="4.079">talk about secret space program history</text>
  <text start="874.29" dur="4.23">you know in the secret programs they</text>
  <text start="876.959" dur="3.451">probably got to the moon far before</text>
  <text start="878.52" dur="3.509">Apollo did I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="880.41" dur="4.32">the Germans got to the moon back in the</text>
  <text start="882.029" dur="5.161">late 30s with the secret spacecraft that</text>
  <text start="884.73" dur="5.04">they were working on in the anti-gravity</text>
  <text start="887.19" dur="4.17">technologies etc so anyway long topic I</text>
  <text start="889.77" dur="3.15">won&amp;#39;t go ranting on it but I just</text>
  <text start="891.36" dur="3.84">thought this was funny and wanted to</text>
  <text start="892.92" dur="4.52">make a note of it and then speaking of</text>
  <text start="895.2" dur="5.28">Julian Assange this was that article</text>
  <text start="897.44" dur="4.6">that Joe was referencing when WikiLeaks</text>

  <text start="1070.4" dur="4.65">too serious with this panel but my</text>
  <text start="1073.43" dur="4.2">thought is you know why would he</text>
  <text start="1075.05" dur="3.99">resurrect it if there wasn&amp;#39;t anything</text>
  <text start="1077.63" dur="4.35">serious to come of it</text>
  <text start="1079.04" dur="6.3">Trump wouldn&amp;#39;t do that so I think this</text>
  <text start="1081.98" dur="5.31">panel has redone recreated for very</text>
  <text start="1085.34" dur="3.12">specific reason and now very last thing</text>
  <text start="1087.29" dur="5.61">I want to discuss with you guys is that</text>
  <text start="1088.46" dur="7.38">New York State Senator Jose Peralta who</text>
  <text start="1092.9" dur="5.94">died on Thanksgiving Eve so this New</text>
  <text start="1095.84" dur="4.89">York State Senator he died from septic</text>
  <text start="1098.84" dur="4.35">shock that&amp;#39;s the official explanation</text>
  <text start="1100.73" dur="6.39">for his death and septic shock is</text>
  <text start="1103.19" dur="6.12">basically inflammatory death so your</text>
  <text start="1107.12" dur="5.51">body goes into a state of inflammation</text>
  <text start="1109.31" dur="5.91">that I can&amp;#39;t handle and then you die</text>
  <text start="1112.63" dur="4.51">essentially what septic shock is now</text>
  <text start="1115.22" dur="3.36">here&amp;#39;s the interesting thing see the</text>
  <text start="1117.14" dur="3.45">inflammation can lead to organ damage</text>
  <text start="1118.58" dur="3.81">and failure dangerous condition known as</text>
  <text start="1120.59" dur="2.22">septic shock now here&amp;#39;s the interesting</text>
  <text start="1122.39" dur="6.48">thing</text>
  <text start="1122.81" dur="8.88">Jose Peralta was spearheading a flu shot</text>
  <text start="1128.87" dur="6.93">clinic in New York City just days before</text>
  <text start="1131.69" dur="7.86">his death a flu shot clinic right what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1135.8" dur="6.93">the fallout from a flu shot well your</text>
  <text start="1139.55" dur="4.74">body can get surely inflamed as heck</text>
  <text start="1142.73" dur="3.87">your nervous system can get inflamed</text>
  <text start="1144.29" dur="5.22">encephalitis which is swelling of the</text>
  <text start="1146.6" dur="4.89">brain happens with literally every shot</text>
  <text start="1149.51" dur="3.57">you get not only that but it can make</text>
  <text start="1151.49" dur="3.21">the rest of your body your nervous</text>
  <text start="1153.08" dur="4.5">system and your immune system inflamed</text>

  <text start="1157.58" dur="4.74">gathering at here was Jose Peralta dead</text>
  <text start="1160.82" dur="5.79">because of a flu shot</text>
  <text start="1162.32" dur="7.38">maybe maybe don&amp;#39;t know can&amp;#39;t be sure of</text>
  <text start="1166.61" dur="7.29">that but I would say the dots definitely</text>
