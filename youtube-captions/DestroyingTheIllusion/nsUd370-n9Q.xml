  <text start="112.86" dur="4.609">hammer truth in plain sight now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.829" dur="4.441">the interesting thing</text>
  <text start="117.469" dur="5.561">Pentagon&amp;#39;s never been audited before but</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="4.83">the very first audit that&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="3.33">happened to the Pentagon is underway</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="3.42">right now it&amp;#39;s actually been going on</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="4.619">for the last year very quietly very</text>
  <text start="128.52" dur="5.219">quietly this is an article from late</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="3.441">2017 almost a year ago Pentagon</text>
  <text start="133.739" dur="2.83">announces</text>
  <text start="134.42" dur="6">first ever audit of the Department of</text>
  <text start="136.569" dur="6.431">Defense like I said very very quiet one</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="5.28">of the only stories we&amp;#39;ve heard leaked</text>
  <text start="143" dur="5.819">into the news this past year about that</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="5.759">audit has been about this right here</text>
  <text start="148.819" dur="5.701">pentagon audit shows logistical arm of</text>
  <text start="151.459" dur="6.241">military can&amp;#39;t explain where 800 million</text>
  <text start="154.52" dur="7.02">dollars went nearly a billion dollars</text>
  <text start="157.7" dur="5.46">now that sounds like a lot of money but</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="3.21">in a minute here we&amp;#39;re gonna actually</text>
  <text start="163.16" dur="4.579">talk about how much money we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="5.88">expecting to be shown missing or</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="4.931">unaccounted for within the Pentagon but</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="4.919">let&amp;#39;s get back to this audit here so</text>
  <text start="172.67" dur="5.25">pentagon braces for the impact of this</text>
  <text start="175.549" dur="4.44">audit the findings of the audit are</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="4.95">actually supposed to be released in only</text>
  <text start="179.989" dur="5.701">about 10 days 10 11 days November 15th</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="6.6">or 16th as per comptroller David</text>
  <text start="185.69" dur="6.15">Norquist so only 10 or 11 days now since</text>
  <text start="189.47" dur="6.18">the findings of that audit are supposed</text>
  <text start="191.84" dur="7.38">to come out mm-hm very close enough I</text>
  <text start="195.65" dur="5.01">wonder if that fits in perfectly to all</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="3.51">the plans going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="200.66" dur="3.84">right now so 1011 days we&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="202.73" dur="3.42">hear about this audit this audit we</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="4.35">haven&amp;#39;t really heard all that much about</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="4.5">for the past year about a million</text>
  <text start="208.85" dur="4.35">dollars gone now let&amp;#39;s talk about how</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="5.04">much money we&amp;#39;re expecting to be</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="4.379">announced in the findings of that audit</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="3.389">so you might be saying to yourself holy</text>
  <text start="217.579" dur="4.861">crap they don&amp;#39;t know where a billion</text>
  <text start="219.079" dur="6.151">dollars went a billion dollars right if</text>
  <text start="222.44" dur="4.47">that happened to anybody else any other</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="4.44">branch of government people would be up</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="6.27">in arms a billion dollars but hmm from</text>
  <text start="229.67" dur="8.37">the Pentagon this is actually a drop in</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="6.96">the bucket back in 2016 only about two</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="4.08">and a half years ago there was a report</text>
  <text start="240.14" dur="4.65">released by the Defense Department&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.12" dur="6.06">inspector general and said that the Army</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="5.279">in one year alone made six point five</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="5.1">trillion dollars in what they called</text>
  <text start="250.069" dur="6.48">wrongful adjustments or improper</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="6.84">accounting adjustments various we could</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="5.641">say excuses various jargon used to call</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="4.74">it what it is basically the swiping the</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="5.67">stealing the laundering of money six</text>
  <text start="264.86" dur="4.799">point five trillion two years ago now if</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="5.1">remember if you&amp;#39;ve heard of this the day</text>
  <text start="269.659" dur="7.431">before 9/11 Donald Rumsfeld admitted to</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="6.959">2.3 trillion dollars in these improper</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="4.509">adjustments basically missing money from</text>
  <text start="279.919" dur="4.321">the Pentagon this is the day before 9/11</text>
  <text start="281.599" dur="5.1">of course 9/11 happened we all forget</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="6.12">that number grew to six point five</text>
  <text start="286.699" dur="6.09">trillion as you can see here in 2016</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="3.899">some people out there are saying that</text>
  <text start="292.789" dur="4.35">that number might very well be up to</text>
  <text start="294.259" dur="5.22">even 20 trillion dollars more or less</text>
  <text start="297.139" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;m not sure about the 2021 trillion</text>
  <text start="299.479" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s flowing around but we could say</text>
  <text start="301.129" dur="5.85">as per official sources at least six</text>
  <text start="304.099" dur="7.051">point five trillion is missing so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.979" dur="8.041">that&amp;#39;s with a t guys with 80 trillion</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="7.56">dollars that&amp;#39;s just not 800 million or 1</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="5.639">billion six point five so I&amp;#39;m curious if</text>
  <text start="318.71" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re gonna see that full number six</text>
  <text start="320.659" dur="5.82">point five plus trillion admitted here</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="5.489">on November 15th or 16th maybe maybe not</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="3.9">you know on one hand if they don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="328.729" dur="3.9">us it&amp;#39;s that full amount I would</text>
  <text start="330.379" dur="5.22">understand that&amp;#39;s pretty shocking for</text>
  <text start="332.629" dur="5.431">the American public you know but at the</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="5.25">very same time they might be preparing</text>

  <text start="491.36" dur="5.64">D class I wonder if this D class falls</text>

  <text start="497" dur="5.76">say about the Pentagon audit now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.95" dur="7.56">get into the space force Navy expects</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="6.21">major role in new space force this was</text>
  <text start="506.51" dur="4.83">again another recent article coming out</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="4.11">National Defense magazine and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="3.54">basically discussing how a couple higher</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="3.93">up officials in the Navy we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="514.88" dur="4.17">they yeah we might have a pretty big</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="3.96">role in the space force and it says</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="3.42">right here however the Navy&amp;#39;s exact role</text>
  <text start="520.97" dur="2.22">in a new space force has yet to be</text>
  <text start="522.47" dur="2.91">determined</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="4.17">but it remains an open question they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.38" dur="3.75">kind of putting the idea out there the</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="4.53">Navy might take a major role now this is</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="4.56">interesting me for me personally any of</text>
  <text start="531.89" dur="3.27">the others out there that are really</text>
  <text start="533.69" dur="4.47">hard into secret space program</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="4.77">research because it&amp;#39;s on a public level</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="3.539">often said that the Air Force has</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="3.87">anything in the air anything in space</text>
  <text start="541.699" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s the Air Force&amp;#39;s domain because</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="6.029">they fly but again if you actually look</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="6.211">at the under underground stuff the</text>
  <text start="549.829" dur="5.01">underground research the Navy has</text>
  <text start="552.74" dur="4.17">actually had more of a hand in space in</text>
  <text start="554.839" dur="4.021">the black project realm than the Air</text>
  <text start="556.91" dur="5.19">Force has the reason being is because</text>
  <text start="558.86" dur="4.979">the Navy was able to get some of the</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="4.44">research first I&amp;#39;m gonna reference</text>
  <text start="563.839" dur="5.49">William Tompkins here William Tompkins</text>
  <text start="566.54" dur="5.46">his testimony in our recent movie above</text>

  <text start="594.199" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve been developing it for that long</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="6.75">with what looks to be the decades of</text>

  <text start="602.779" dur="5.25">the Navy put in a operational space</text>
  <text start="605.93" dur="3.959">fleet called solar warden in the 1980s</text>
  <text start="608.029" dur="4.201">we have evidence of Gary McKinnon who</text>
  <text start="609.889" dur="4.68">hacked NASA computers and found this in</text>
  <text start="612.23" dur="4.709">the year 2001 that the Navy yes put out</text>
  <text start="614.569" dur="4.25">a solar warden space fleet that it kept</text>
  <text start="616.939" dur="4.26">highly classified and it had</text>
  <text start="618.819" dur="4.931">non-terrestrial officers on it and a</text>
  <text start="621.199" dur="5.58">whole fleet of spacecraft this is back</text>
  <text start="623.75" dur="5.939">in the 80s Tompkins even claimed that</text>
  <text start="626.779" dur="7.381">there&amp;#39;s more development going on at</text>
  <text start="629.689" dur="6.601">this moment new craft new fleet so the</text>
  <text start="634.16" dur="4.739">Navy has had an upper hand</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="5.19">on the Air Force in actuality when it</text>
  <text start="638.899" dur="5.281">comes to space ok for instance say an</text>
  <text start="641.48" dur="3.9">Air Force was gonna go Air Force</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="3.149">personnel was gonna go on a classified</text>
  <text start="645.38" dur="3.629">mission they would basically go up come</text>
  <text start="647.329" dur="2.88">back have dinner with their family be</text>
  <text start="649.009" dur="3.18">ready for their nine-to-five the next</text>
  <text start="650.209" dur="3.81">day right the Air Force doesn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="652.189" dur="4.44">depth of capability that the Navy would</text>
  <text start="654.019" dur="6.721">because the Navy trains for it and they</text>
  <text start="656.629" dur="7.08">have the construction capability with</text>
  <text start="660.74" dur="5.64">their development of submarines to go on</text>
  <text start="663.709" dur="5.281">longer more in-depth space operations</text>
  <text start="666.38" dur="3.84">the personnel that train on a sub</text>
  <text start="668.99" dur="4.07">the exact same training that they would</text>
  <text start="670.22" dur="5.37">need for a space mission because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="673.06" dur="5.38">figuring out how to live in a small</text>
  <text start="675.59" dur="4.95">contained area and be in that for a long</text>
  <text start="678.44" dur="5.19">time long period and not only that but</text>
  <text start="680.54" dur="6.21">submarines themselves can be outfitted</text>
  <text start="683.63" dur="5.61">retro retro fitted with electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="686.75" dur="4.08">propulsion systems and the modular</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="3.51">building of submarines is very similar</text>
  <text start="690.83" dur="4.86">to the modular building of deep state</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="4.35">crap our deep space craft deep state</text>
  <text start="695.69" dur="3.93">craft may be both</text>
  <text start="697.1" dur="4.11">so the Navy&amp;#39;s always had an upper hand</text>
  <text start="699.62" dur="3.45">on the Air Force Navy expecting a major</text>
  <text start="701.21" dur="3.45">role in the new space force interesting</text>
  <text start="703.07" dur="3.51">right maybe they&amp;#39;re trying to disclose</text>
  <text start="704.66" dur="5.28">some of their classified projects</text>
  <text start="706.58" dur="6.75">through the space force Trump with the</text>
  <text start="709.94" dur="5.16">amount of Navy officials high-ranking</text>
  <text start="713.33" dur="4.71">officials around him Marine General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.1" dur="5.04">Navy Admirals around him does he know</text>
  <text start="718.04" dur="5.7">these things are they pissed positioning</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="5.49">themselves as the Alliance to operate a</text>
  <text start="723.74" dur="3.51">full disclosure not some sort of partial</text>
  <text start="725.63" dur="2.88">disclosure those are the dots that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="727.25" dur="4.86">seeing line up those are the questions</text>
  <text start="728.51" dur="5.1">in my mind okay and one more thing to</text>
  <text start="732.11" dur="4.28">add to that Navy</text>
  <text start="733.61" dur="5.7">disclosing space programs check this out</text>
  <text start="736.39" dur="4.84">Deputy Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan</text>
  <text start="739.31" dur="4.2">was talking space force in Seattle in</text>
  <text start="741.23" dur="3.48">the read last week and he was talking</text>
  <text start="743.51" dur="2.73">about how the military&amp;#39;s gonna leverage</text>

  <text start="746.24" dur="3.51">speech about Amazon Microsoft how all</text>
  <text start="748.4" dur="3.48">these tech companies in Seattle are</text>
  <text start="749.75" dur="3.42">gonna help the space force well what I</text>
  <text start="751.88" dur="3.48">learned and some dots that I was</text>
  <text start="753.17" dur="4.14">connecting and reading this Deputy</text>

  <text start="757.31" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s the number two in the DoD that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.32" dur="4.89">the guy right under mattis Secretary of</text>
  <text start="761.87" dur="4.56">Defense mattis I didn&amp;#39;t realize that Pat</text>
  <text start="764.21" dur="5.64">Shanahan I heard the name before but Pat</text>
  <text start="766.43" dur="6.72">Shanahan is an X Boeing vice president</text>
  <text start="769.85" dur="7.47">the X VP of Boeing who was put in place</text>
  <text start="773.15" dur="5.4">in the role in the DoD in mid 2017 so</text>
  <text start="777.32" dur="2.88">this guy was brought into the Trump</text>
  <text start="778.55" dur="4.89">administration being a former VP of</text>
  <text start="780.2" dur="6.6">Boeing and now he&amp;#39;s playing a huge role</text>
  <text start="783.44" dur="5.97">what looks like in the space force Wow</text>
  <text start="786.8" dur="4.53">Boeing right aerospace contractor here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="789.41" dur="5.07">the thing I mentioned William Tompkins a</text>
  <text start="791.33" dur="5.94">minute ago yes we own William Tompkins</text>
  <text start="794.48" dur="4.5">as per his claims his testimony and it</text>
  <text start="797.27" dur="3.66">checks out is that he was actually urged</text>
  <text start="798.98" dur="2.85">by some of his contacts in the Navy to</text>
  <text start="800.93" dur="3.84">come forward with his</text>
  <text start="801.83" dur="4.62">dori to start telling about the UFO</text>
  <text start="804.77" dur="3.09">phenomenon about the secret space</text>
  <text start="806.45" dur="4.65">program phenomena and especially about</text>
  <text start="807.86" dur="5.49">the Navy&amp;#39;s involvement in that now like</text>
  <text start="811.1" dur="5.16">I mentioned William Tompkins worked for</text>
  <text start="813.35" dur="4.29">an aerospace contractor not just the</text>
  <text start="816.26" dur="3.27">Navy intelligence during World War two</text>
  <text start="817.64" dur="6.11">but also an aerospace contractor in the</text>
  <text start="819.53" dur="7.4">50s Douglas Aircraft designing stuff</text>
  <text start="823.75" dur="5.8">spacecraft for the Navy Douglas Aircraft</text>
  <text start="826.93" dur="4.78">later a couple decades later became</text>
  <text start="829.55" dur="4.91">McDonnell Douglas as to corporations</text>
  <text start="831.71" dur="5.94">merged McDonnell Douglas was acquired by</text>
  <text start="834.46" dur="7.87">Boeing sometime in the 1990s I believe</text>
  <text start="837.65" dur="5.79">so Boeing absorbed originally I mean of</text>
  <text start="842.33" dur="3.8">course they built it out over a few</text>
  <text start="843.44" dur="6.27">decades but originally Douglas Aircraft</text>
  <text start="846.13" dur="5.44">they had space programs they were</text>
  <text start="849.71" dur="4.17">working on as per William Tompkins asked</text>
  <text start="851.57" dur="6.18">for even others who were finding solar</text>
  <text start="853.88" dur="6.33">warden and evidence of this so with the</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="4.5">Boeing xvp what does Pat Shanahan know</text>
  <text start="860.21" dur="3.3">does he know about these SS piece was he</text>
  <text start="862.25" dur="4.05">read in on them did he have access to</text>
  <text start="863.51" dur="4.5">them Boeing VP very interesting and now</text>
  <text start="866.3" dur="4.92">he&amp;#39;s a part of the DoD second-in-command</text>
  <text start="868.01" dur="5.13">and now he&amp;#39;s talking space force so the</text>
  <text start="871.22" dur="5.58">space force you guys in the secret space</text>
  <text start="873.14" dur="5.91">program is one of the number one topics</text>
  <text start="876.8" dur="4.29">number one number one topics out there</text>
  <text start="879.05" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s everything to do in the takedown of</text>
  <text start="881.09" dur="3.3">the deep state and disclosure we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="882.89" dur="4.26">gonna be learning soon with this</text>
  <text start="884.39" dur="5.31">Pentagon audit is going to bring us how</text>
  <text start="887.15" dur="4.7">many maybe billions maybe trillions in</text>
  <text start="889.7" dur="5.64">improper accounting adjustments are</text>
  <text start="891.85" dur="7.03">found right and exposed first ever audit</text>
  <text start="895.34" dur="7.52">we also have what looks to be a serious</text>
  <text start="898.88" dur="6.57">naval connections serious Boeing and</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="4.72">corporate contractor connections to the</text>
  <text start="905.45" dur="3.87">white hats to the Alliance to the Trump</text>
  <text start="907.58" dur="4.32">administration and I think they are</text>
  <text start="909.32" dur="3.87">truly working for a full disclosure we</text>
  <text start="911.9" dur="2.58">have naval elements trying to do this</text>
  <text start="913.19" dur="2.61">I&amp;#39;m sure many of the Air Force is</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="3.99">jumping on board again not black/white</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="5.49">thing but I think the Air Force has more</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="6.9">deep state connections in there okay Air</text>
  <text start="921.29" dur="5.55">Force and CIA very closely linked so I</text>
  <text start="925.37" dur="3.36">think a lot of the Air Force guys are</text>
  <text start="926.84" dur="5.01">kind of waking up to what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="928.73" dur="5.79">many of them joining the Alliance but</text>
  <text start="931.85" dur="3.66">Navy playing a huge part in all of this</text>
  <text start="934.52" dur="3.66">going on so</text>
  <text start="935.51" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s that guy&amp;#39;s Pentagon audit Navy</text>
