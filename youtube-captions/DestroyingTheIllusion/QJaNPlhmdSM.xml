  <text start="15.48" dur="4.73">Arts and Science announcement so I</text>
  <text start="18.15" dur="5.19">figured I get it give it a listen and</text>
  <text start="20.21" dur="5.739">Here I am about half an hour into hang a</text>

  <text start="43.29" dur="77.28">afterwards last guy was a if only I have</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="7.761">that kind of production value throwing</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="8.509">them from the word out there aerospace</text>
  <text start="124.49" dur="4.589">science in entertainment</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="13.11">the universe using them to help humanity</text>
  <text start="136.75" dur="10.59">is clustered around a campfire so the</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="6.6">thing here is that what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="7.86">to do is bring out part of the science</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="4.53">and part of the ideas when at the</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="4.619">beginning of this when Tom DeLonge first</text>
  <text start="157.03" dur="6.9">went on stage he was trying to say this</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="7.081">issue the whole UFO UAP issue has been</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="4.74">kept secret for 70 years because at the</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="3.839">time the Department of Defense or the</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="3.959">military was too busy dealing with it</text>
  <text start="170.739" dur="3.18">when they first encountered it seventy</text>
  <text start="172.629" dur="3.961">years ago that&amp;#39;s what he claimed and</text>
  <text start="173.919" dur="4.5">that it wasn&amp;#39;t out of disdain but all</text>
  <text start="176.59" dur="3.81">these secrets were kept to protect the</text>
  <text start="178.419" dur="6.121">American people and then the first</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="6.78">speaker I don&amp;#39;t know who the first</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="7.02">speaker was but he was basically trying</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="6.27">to compare now to the Cold War you know</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="3.569">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that subtle kind of Russia</text>
  <text start="193.45" dur="3.749">fear they&amp;#39;ve been trying to ingrain us</text>
  <text start="195.129" dur="4.651">with right so he was describing this</text>
  <text start="197.199" dur="4.91">real incident that occurred where a UFO</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="5.19">came up to the Nimitz in 2004 and</text>
  <text start="202.109" dur="4.511">literally trying to scare people like oh</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="3.18">if we were attacked by an object we</text>
  <text start="206.62" dur="3.42">wouldn&amp;#39;t know we got to know how to</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="4.979">handle it so we better fund this</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="4.409">initiative to start disclosing and</text>
  <text start="213.129" dur="3.75">bringing out these aerospace</text>
  <text start="214.449" dur="7.68">technologies that they&amp;#39;ve been keeping</text>
  <text start="216.879" dur="7.58">secret out of you know protection of the</text>
  <text start="222.129" dur="4.89">people there&amp;#39;s many people</text>
  <text start="224.459" dur="3.761">there&amp;#39;s I mean there&amp;#39;s zero talk of</text>
  <text start="227.019" dur="2.64">nefarious activity in the</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="3.359">military-industrial complex with this</text>
  <text start="229.659" dur="20.151">initiative that&amp;#39;s it you know it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="231.579" dur="18.231">easy to pick apart so feel good right</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="4.95">and report back what we see the fact is</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="4.27">see a lot of this as well is a huge</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="2.37">stunt cuz you have to understand the</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="2.88">market they&amp;#39;re targeting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.409" dur="2.961">targeting the mainstream mainly a</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="3.109">younger audience</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="4.109">that&amp;#39;s why part of it is science</text>
  <text start="268.199" dur="3.421">aerospace and entertainment because you</text>
  <text start="270.479" dur="2.491">know this young audience with their</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="3.24">attention spans these days got to be</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="5.13">entertained but what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="4.74">do is persuade people persuade like Oh</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="3.33">UFOs are real they&amp;#39;re using a very</text>
  <text start="279.6" dur="3.33">technical terminology try to get people</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="3.75">to take this issue a lot more seriously</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="3.299">than just oh a lian&amp;#39;s no they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="3.51">UAVs</text>
  <text start="286.229" dur="4.41">unexplained aerial phenomenon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="6.6">trying to pull that fear card especially</text>
  <text start="290.639" dur="6.121">comparing nowadays to the Cold War so</text>
  <text start="295.29" dur="2.879">they&amp;#39;re trying to fear people but</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re also trying to give a positivity</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="4.411">to it like imagine what we can explore</text>
  <text start="300" dur="5.4">and utilize and exotic world changing</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="7.7">technologies so interesting someone</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="4.88">can&amp;#39;t share this so that&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="16.449">weird it&amp;#39;s real weird still putting</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="7.44">Rockets and airplanes up there but they</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="6.331">did show a b-2 bomber that does utilize</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="6.48">electrochromatic technology so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="9.03">the thing the second speaker no no who</text>
  <text start="337.5" dur="7.86">was it one of these guys works for</text>
  <text start="342.75" dur="7.44">Lockheed third dude they had up Steve</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="7.05">justice so Steve justice is worked at</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="4.11">Lockheed skunkworks and he was trying to</text>
  <text start="352.41" dur="4.74">act like he wanted to find out what</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="6.57">these things do how this physics works</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="5.28">and whatnot they&amp;#39;ve known been rich the</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="3.6">former director said we already know how</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="3.54">those things fly we can take e.t home so</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="2.52">this guy I mean these all these guys are</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="5.759">acting like we haven&amp;#39;t had this</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="6.359">technology for ages and developed it</text>
  <text start="371.729" dur="16.711">they&amp;#39;re acting like we haven&amp;#39;t developed</text>
  <text start="373.349" dur="16.591">it you know think about the realities of</text>
  <text start="388.44" dur="3.33">what this team has the ability to</text>
  <text start="389.94" dur="4.529">accomplish and deliver if we&amp;#39;re fully</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="5.67">equipped be a part of making history and</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="5.341">join us at the start we cannot wait and</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="3.15">depend for others depend on others to do</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="2.909">it</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="3.479">and he&amp;#39;s been standing like that the</text>
  <text start="402.719" dur="15.81">whole time whenever he talks he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="404.069" dur="17.1">his hand on his body language 2,000</text>
  <text start="418.529" dur="3.931">people are watching him 250 or watching</text>
  <text start="421.169" dur="4.321">me I&amp;#39;m gonna get him I&amp;#39;m gonna get him</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="3.81">please days then we&amp;#39;ll have her in some</text>
  <text start="425.49" dur="8.25">pool disclosure</text>
  <text start="426.27" dur="12.119">oh and also another thing they mentioned</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to build a real-time</text>
  <text start="438.389" dur="3.541">sighting collector in like an app to</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="3.989">basically what they said crowd crunch</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="5.19">the data and document events and in my</text>
  <text start="444.539" dur="5.671">head I&amp;#39;m thinking Blue Book 2.0 air</text>
  <text start="447.12" dur="5.88">force ran their Project Blue Book in the</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="4.769">60s to discredit all UFO issues this is</text>
  <text start="453" dur="3.3">like a Blue Book 2.0 so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="454.979" dur="2.421">trying to discredit all the issues</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="4.649">they&amp;#39;re trying to bring them in</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="5.739">legitimize them but then manage and</text>
  <text start="460.949" dur="5.011">sanitize it you know how easy could they</text>
  <text start="463.139" dur="5.101">sanitize their own all these sightings</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="4.259">and say which ones might be an alien</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="3.419">which ones they want us to think might</text>
  <text start="470.219" dur="4.47">be a secret space program crap it would</text>
  <text start="471.659" dur="15.271">be so easy for them to control the</text>
  <text start="474.689" dur="13.621">narrative that way you know if all you</text>
  <text start="486.93" dur="3.63">guys are watching this there I would</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="5.609">advise you to go check out</text>
  <text start="490.56" dur="8.329">William Tompkins testimony on the secret</text>
  <text start="493.919" dur="7.05">space program and this shows me how</text>
  <text start="498.889" dur="3.791">time-sensitive all this is and how hard</text>
  <text start="500.969" dur="3.241">I&amp;#39;m gonna really work to get my</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="3.69">interview with William Tompkins out that</text>
  <text start="504.21" dur="4.41">I did a couple months ago but he was a</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="5.25">part of building out some other</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="5.7">knowledge projects for the Navy and this</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="5.219">was back in the 50s okay he was</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="4.74">designing spacecraft already back then</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="4.86">because we very much had electrogravitic</text>
  <text start="519.06" dur="5.43">technologies in government corporate</text>
  <text start="521.699" dur="4.591">projects and 50s and 60s so his</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="6.779">testimony will show you how deep it</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="6.779">really goes and in fact a big part that</text>
  <text start="531.269" dur="2.82">none of these guys will be telling us</text>
  <text start="533.069" dur="4.32">about part</text>
  <text start="534.089" dur="6">full disclosure is that many of these</text>
  <text start="537.389" dur="5.37">technologies originated in Nazi Germany</text>
  <text start="540.089" dur="4.771">and they were working on it they in the</text>
  <text start="542.759" dur="5.161">nineteen late 30s took a lot of their</text>
  <text start="544.86" dur="5.07">technology down to Antarctica and then</text>
  <text start="547.92" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s you know they infiltrated more</text>
  <text start="549.93" dur="6.149">so into America Project Paperclip huge</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="3.899">backstory behind that but this is the</text>
  <text start="556.079" dur="9.05">full disclosure this is the essential</text>
  <text start="557.879" dur="10.591">one that this effort won&amp;#39;t be dusting I</text>
  <text start="565.129" dur="4.9">guess that&amp;#39;s it man I really wanted to</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="3.57">hear the other dudes talk one was how</text>
  <text start="570.029" dur="4.92">puta I wanted to him to talk about his</text>
  <text start="572.04" dur="7.709">science what was interesting is when</text>
  <text start="574.949" dur="6.99">they were discussing boot off</text>
  <text start="579.749" dur="3.75">and showing some of his science you know</text>
  <text start="581.939" dur="3.15">I don&amp;#39;t know too much about that guy</text>
  <text start="583.499" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;ve seen his name before I want to</text>
  <text start="585.089" dur="4.29">research more of his work but he was</text>
  <text start="587.069" dur="5.551">assuming fate space-time as a flat plane</text>
  <text start="589.379" dur="5.13">and when he was doing some equations for</text>
  <text start="592.62" dur="4.129">the curvature of space-time he was</text>
  <text start="594.509" dur="4.62">thinking space-time to be flat when</text>
  <text start="596.749" dur="5.171">space-time you have to understand is a</text>
  <text start="599.129" dur="4.68">fluid and space has three dimensions and</text>
  <text start="601.92" dur="5.25">time has three dimensions so again</text>
  <text start="603.809" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s some deep science that I</text>
  <text start="607.17" dur="3.75">wonder if they&amp;#39;ll be discussing with</text>
  <text start="609.209" dur="3.75">this to the Stars academy of arts and</text>
  <text start="610.92" dur="5.19">science project right there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="612.959" dur="6.81">more that they likely won&amp;#39;t tell us but</text>
  <text start="616.11" dur="8.94">hey that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s up to us to bring in</text>
  <text start="619.769" dur="7.11">all of the information and usher in full</text>
  <text start="625.05" dur="3.779">disclosure and do it reasonably do it</text>
  <text start="626.879" dur="6.481">soundly right there&amp;#39;s so much of this</text>
  <text start="628.829" dur="9.81">that it&amp;#39;s all hippie feel-good lore but</text>
  <text start="633.36" dur="9.12">again it&amp;#39;s up to us to spread the</text>
  <text start="638.639" dur="5.64">information and get them to disclose it</text>
  <text start="642.48" dur="3.599">because I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen lately the</text>
  <text start="644.279" dur="3.72">power of the collective consciousness at</text>
  <text start="646.079" dur="4.35">making the mainstream media report what</text>
  <text start="647.999" dur="4.65">we want them to report Harvey Weinstein</text>
  <text start="650.429" dur="3.96">the media was silent about him for three</text>
  <text start="652.649" dur="3.721">or four days and then so many people in</text>
  <text start="654.389" dur="5.221">social media we&amp;#39;re discussing it it</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="6.679">forced them to talk about that so if we</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="6.779">can not if we can see through this and</text>
  <text start="663.049" dur="4.421">know our history know what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="666.389" dur="3.361">going on and know</text>
  <text start="667.47" dur="5.37">disclosure goes not just with the UFO</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="7.08">phenomenon but our Luciferian occult</text>
  <text start="672.84" dur="6.51">elite health right pharmaceutical truths</text>
