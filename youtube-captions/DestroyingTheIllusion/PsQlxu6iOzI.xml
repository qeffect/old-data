  <text start="13.519" dur="4.541">what&amp;#39;s going on ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="4.291">so as you probably know by now this this</text>
  <text start="18.06" dur="4.02">charlottesville protest story is</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="4.32">sweeping the nation so much so that even</text>
  <text start="22.08" dur="4.619">in my backyard of seattle there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="24.21" dur="4.68">protests going on today in response to</text>
  <text start="26.699" dur="4.59">those protests that went on right there</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="4.53">so to give some clarity this to this</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="5.131">issue i just want to give you guys some</text>
  <text start="33.42" dur="6.24">of my thoughts on it here today now</text>
  <text start="36.42" dur="6.42">first of all what happened right well a</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="6.09">group calling themselves the unite the</text>
  <text start="42.84" dur="6.239">right movement got a few thousand people</text>
  <text start="45.75" dur="5.85">together to basically protest their</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="5.46">right to free speech in Charlottesville</text>
  <text start="51.6" dur="5.25">Virginia and it was all headed by that</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="4.25">guy Jason Kessler right there now rather</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="5.729">than listen to the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="58.789" dur="5.381">believe that it was a bunch of Nazi KKK</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="4.921">white supremacist peoples getting</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="6.6">together I went to his Twitter himself</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="6.479">and went back a few weeks to kind of get</text>
  <text start="70.77" dur="4.56">his own philosophies on life and whatnot</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="2.811">to see what it was all about right</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="4.969">rather than listen to the media and</text>
  <text start="76.79" dur="6.82">honestly you know what I found was a</text>
  <text start="80.299" dur="5.741">very conservative leaning dude now</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s a few maybe ideological</text>
  <text start="86.04" dur="6.84">differences that I have with the guy and</text>
  <text start="87.93" dur="7.14">I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s some information that I</text>
  <text start="92.88" dur="5.25">could shed some light on for him but I</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="6.45">did not see a bigot I did not see a</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="6.21">racist I saw a dude with his own</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="6.349">philosophies on life that just wanted to</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="6.33">get him and his friends together and</text>
  <text start="107.869" dur="4.721">voice their opinions in Charlottesville</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.739">Virginia right and that&amp;#39;s what breeds</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="4.98">that brings us to this second point and</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="5.28">as we know those protests in Virginia</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="6.35">turned very violent so much so that</text>
  <text start="120.689" dur="5.371">there was even a black Dodge Challenger</text>
  <text start="123.92" dur="3.85">rammed into a crowd</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="5.61">blatantly on purpose I mean this thing</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="5.34">was speeding it did not slow down so you</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="2.07">know what really happened</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="3.02">do</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="5.73">these people just gathered together to</text>
  <text start="136.13" dur="6.27">incite violence I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="6.69">case because what&amp;#39;s often the case at</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="6.64">protests and things that go on like that</text>
  <text start="146.16" dur="6.48">is that there are paid provocateurs</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="6.66">there whether they&amp;#39;re private</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="5.28">contractors mercenaries or you know paid</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="4.08">to do these things we know and we have</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="4.11">evidence of this that there are paid</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="4.92">provocateurs at protests around the</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="4.52">country to simply incite violence and</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="4.8">make things look bad</text>
  <text start="166.55" dur="5.53">now with that Dodge Challenger getting</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="5.28">ran into that crowd I mean a it was a</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="4.74">nice car I don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s gonna waste</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="5.36">a nice car like that be it was</text>
  <text start="176.82" dur="6.39">registered to a 20 year old out of Ohio</text>
  <text start="180.14" dur="5.26">that&amp;#39;s pretty odd so there&amp;#39;s just a lot</text>
  <text start="183.21" dur="5.13">of things that don&amp;#39;t logically add up</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="5.94">right so I think we&amp;#39;re safe to say that</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="5.82">it was most likely I mean we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="191.34" dur="7.8">but most likely the case that yes this</text>
  <text start="194.16" dur="7.17">was a purposeful thing done at an honest</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="4.17">protest to take advantage of the</text>
  <text start="201.33" dur="3.75">situation right and that leaves us to</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="3.03">this point right here the mainstream</text>
  <text start="205.08" dur="3.18">media I don&amp;#39;t even want to say the</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="5.04">mainstream media I would say the powers</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="6.33">that be the the elite the Cabal they</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="5.58">knew that this event was going to occur</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="6.66">and they saw an opportunity with it they</text>
  <text start="216.96" dur="6.9">saw an opportunity to divide and conquer</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="4.5">not only are they doing this like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="223.86" dur="4.53">written here racially right they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="4.77">labeling as everybody who attended in</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="4.29">support of this protest as being white</text>
  <text start="230.52" dur="4.25">outright racist nationalist peoples and</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="4.26">you know everybody against it as</text>
  <text start="234.77" dur="7.24">progressive compassionate</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="7.41">well-thought-out liberal vote actually</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="3.45">liberal folk also not only they are</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="3.36">doing it racially they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="245.46" dur="4.2">politically as well I kind of intertwine</text>
  <text start="247.71" dur="3.69">those but they are using this the</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="3.24">mainstream media the powers to be the</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="3.66">powers that be with their mainstream</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="5.49">media Talking Heads I should say are</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="5.16">using this to divide and conquer to</text>
  <text start="258.39" dur="5.31">divide us racially to divide us</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="5.37">politically to make one group of people</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="3.6">hate the other group of people so we</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="4.289">continue to go nowhere</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="7.26">society and they can continue to reign</text>
  <text start="269.879" dur="7.41">right so that was done and we see that</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="5.16">playing out especially on CNN an article</text>
  <text start="277.289" dur="4.41">I just saw you know labeling this whole</text>
  <text start="279.72" dur="5.52">all right movement is a bunch of racist</text>
  <text start="281.699" dur="6.72">bigots and what&amp;#39;s also going on last</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="5.97">bullet point here is that the the MSM or</text>
  <text start="288.419" dur="6.9">the powers-that-be they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="6.81">divide and conquer strategy to basically</text>
  <text start="295.319" dur="4.771">put people not only divide people but</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="5.519">put them into the respective boxes in</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="6.18">which they choose so they&amp;#39;re branding a</text>
  <text start="303.539" dur="5.22">lot of these conspiracy theorists or</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="5.28">essentially truthers as being associated</text>
  <text start="308.759" dur="5.731">with the alt-right movement I just saw</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="4.41">an article by the Atlantic in fact are</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="8.1">devoting almost their whole September</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="9.329">2017 issue to it was called how America</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="5.94">went lost its mind how America lost his</text>
  <text start="325.289" dur="5.581">mind and this whole article was</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="4.47">basically a slammed piece against</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="4.889">conservatives you know people supporting</text>
  <text start="333" dur="4.979">Trump and labeling them all conspiracy</text>
  <text start="335.759" dur="5.701">theories and how you know how these</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="5.071">people getting away from the</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="5.429">conventional way of thinking</text>
  <text start="343.05" dur="5.729">are crazy right so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="346.889" dur="3.631">on with these protests it just plays</text>
  <text start="348.779" dur="4.411">into the whole narrative that the</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="5.16">powers-that-be want they want to divide</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="4.74">us so they can rule over us but we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="5.43">let that happen we cannot let this whole</text>
  <text start="357.93" dur="6.269">idea of division consume us I was just</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="5.19">watching a live video of this pretty</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="4.53">southern patriot group that was at those</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="5.07">protests yesterday bunch of thick</text>
  <text start="368.729" dur="6">accents but they actually had some black</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="6.12">dudes in their group and we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="374.729" dur="5.881">understand that it&amp;#39;s not about black</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="5.88">versus white it&amp;#39;s not about liberal</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="4.98">versus Democrat we need to transcend</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="4.079">those dualities right understand that</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="4.109">we&amp;#39;re not gonna be divided we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="387.449" dur="5.22">gonna be put into boxes and understand</text>
  <text start="389.699" dur="4.981">that it&amp;#39;s one power we are all up</text>
  <text start="392.669" dur="3">against it&amp;#39;s that same power that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="3.239">trying to divide us</text>
  <text start="395.669" dur="5.271">it&amp;#39;s that same power that not only</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="5.001">infects the upper echelons of</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="5.3">Democrats in political office but they</text>
  <text start="402.92" dur="5.73">infect the Republican Party as well and</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="4.12">they&amp;#39;re trying to invite insight all</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="3.15">this violence against us and we got to</text>
  <text start="410.36" dur="3.69">understand that it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="3.9">right through the power of the Internet</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="5.61">through the power of people waking up</text>
  <text start="415.7" dur="6.72">these protests are not going to be used</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="4.53">to be infiltrated and divided us so</text>
