  <text start="9.4" dur="4.659">what&amp;#39;s going on folks September 14th</text>
  <text start="12.2" dur="3.87">here and I&amp;#39;m about a week and a half</text>
  <text start="14.059" dur="3.63">late for this news story but I still</text>
  <text start="16.07" dur="3.99">want to talk about the issue and that is</text>
  <text start="17.689" dur="5.16">obviously artificial intelligence here</text>
  <text start="20.06" dur="5.25">and the news story was Vladimir Putin</text>
  <text start="22.849" dur="5.461">Russian President Vladimir Putin when he</text>
  <text start="25.31" dur="5.55">said that the leader in eight I will</text>
  <text start="28.31" dur="4.44">rule the world so he was saying that</text>
  <text start="30.86" dur="3.06">whatever country leads in the</text>
  <text start="32.75" dur="4.129">development of artificial intelligence</text>
  <text start="33.92" dur="7.26">technology it&amp;#39;s gonna rule the place and</text>
  <text start="36.879" dur="5.801">very true but here&amp;#39;s just an interesting</text>
  <text start="41.18" dur="4.46">perspective I want to throw out there</text>
  <text start="42.68" dur="4.17">you know there&amp;#39;s always usually</text>
  <text start="45.64" dur="3.009">doublespeak</text>
  <text start="46.85" dur="4.26">that these politicians have when they</text>
  <text start="48.649" dur="4.5">say certain things right so when Putin</text>
  <text start="51.11" dur="2.519">says you know the leader in AI will rule</text>
  <text start="53.149" dur="3.75">the world</text>
  <text start="53.629" dur="4.921">well don&amp;#39;t worry D have leaders in AI I</text>
  <text start="56.899" dur="3.301">mean AI isn&amp;#39;t some brand new thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.55" dur="3.689">been around a little while and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="60.2" dur="6.75">they kind of already rule the world all</text>
  <text start="62.239" dur="7.651">right we got Google Amazon Jeff Bezos we</text>
  <text start="66.95" dur="5.04">got CIA the NSA we know Amazon and the</text>
  <text start="69.89" dur="3.39">CIA they&amp;#39;re like this you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="71.99" dur="3.54">these three-letter agencies and the</text>
  <text start="73.28" dur="4.08">large corporations are very close in the</text>
  <text start="75.53" dur="5.31">development of AI you know Facebook</text>
  <text start="77.36" dur="6.33">social media giant so it&amp;#39;s as if Putin</text>
  <text start="80.84" dur="4.83">was actually telling us who&amp;#39;s ruling the</text>
  <text start="83.69" dur="4.14">world without actually telling us who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.67" dur="4.35">rule in the world right seems to be kind</text>
  <text start="87.83" dur="4.11">of a double speak there so I wanted to</text>
  <text start="90.02" dur="3.689">throw that out but I also wanted to</text>
  <text start="91.94" dur="4.409">discuss artificial intelligence in</text>
  <text start="93.709" dur="6.951">general and answer the question do we</text>
  <text start="96.349" dur="6.931">even meet it right do we even need this</text>
  <text start="100.66" dur="5.79">technology that will grow and prosper on</text>
  <text start="103.28" dur="6.39">its own or this intelligence that is</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="6.19">artificial that is man-made in nature</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="5.399">and the point of this video is to not</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="5.039">only offer a warning on the dangers of</text>
  <text start="115.069" dur="5.071">it and I think a lot of the dangers have</text>
  <text start="117.679" dur="3.841">been already put in plain sight for us</text>
  <text start="120.14" dur="3.66">with all these Hollywood productions</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="4.439">like what&amp;#39;s Skynet and eagle-eye and all</text>
  <text start="123.8" dur="4.98">that jazz I mean what do we have that</text>
  <text start="125.959" dur="4.8">like talking robotic head just last year</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="3.87">that when they switched it on it was you</text>
  <text start="130.759" dur="3.361">know saying kill all humans or farm</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="3.419">owners or something like that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="134.12" dur="4.05">paraphrasing but anyway we know the</text>
  <text start="136.069" dur="4.021">dangers of it artificial intelligence is</text>
  <text start="138.17" dur="4.2">dangerous but again back to that</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="5.22">question do we even need it</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="6.27">and then some question here what about</text>
  <text start="145.31" dur="5.67">the natural intelligence that&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="4.11">inherent within us right those those</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="4.8">powers of consciousness that we already</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="5.909">have with our mind with our body and you</text>
  <text start="155.78" dur="4.769">know the the language within us that is</text>
  <text start="158.659" dur="4.231">in our DNA and that gives us these</text>
  <text start="160.549" dur="4.291">abilities right who cares about</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="5.22">artificial intelligence when we have</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="6.119">brains and pineal glands and god-given</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="4.86">DNA I call it God you could call it</text>
  <text start="170.959" dur="4.441">creator right you can call it source as</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="5.46">well I&amp;#39;m not getting attached to a label</text>
  <text start="175.4" dur="5.01">here all I&amp;#39;m saying is we have so much</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="5.639">within us that we haven&amp;#39;t even accessed</text>
  <text start="180.41" dur="6.749">yet but somehow in these mainstream</text>
  <text start="184.069" dur="4.381">media journals and in our education</text>
  <text start="187.159" dur="2.881">system they tell artificial</text>
  <text start="188.45" dur="5.129">intelligences being this new thing is</text>
  <text start="190.04" dur="6.33">like it&amp;#39;s the only way forward but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.579" dur="7.02">dangerous so is it really the only way</text>
  <text start="196.37" dur="7.56">forward and again what about the ability</text>
  <text start="200.599" dur="5.631">is telepathy of ESP of remote viewing</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="6.54">right of actually literally altering</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="6.97">space and time both with just our brains</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="5.04">with just our minds this is a mental</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="5.819">universe consciousness is the substance</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="6.27">that makes up everything and once you</text>
  <text start="219.019" dur="4.86">become self-aware to a point and</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="3.9">understand your own mental powers</text>
  <text start="223.879" dur="4.681">understand literally believe your own</text>
  <text start="225.68" dur="6.69">abilities that you have in altering</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="5.579">matter altering time well that is the</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="4.47">real intelligence that they need to be</text>
  <text start="234.139" dur="5.25">teaching and when it comes to artificial</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="4.739">intelligence well there are technologies</text>
  <text start="239.389" dur="5.69">that can assist us but what they assist</text>
  <text start="241.579" dur="7.681">is with our consciousness they they</text>
  <text start="245.079" dur="6.37">advanced it or they strengthen the</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="5.61">ability of our consciousness to alter</text>
  <text start="251.449" dur="4.891">matter in time okay you don&amp;#39;t even need</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="3.75">artificial intelligence let me tell you</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="6.09">and whenever they want to put something</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="6">in your body that right don&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="262.43" dur="5.549">them put anything inside of you that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s the bridge that&amp;#39;s yeah you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="267.979" dur="3.18">want them to cross right you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="269.78" dur="3.75">to chip in you you don&amp;#39;t need a barcode</text>
  <text start="271.159" dur="4.231">or anything like that the technologies</text>
  <text start="273.53" dur="2.639">that can assist our consciousness you</text>
  <text start="275.39" dur="2.76">know many</text>
  <text start="276.169" dur="3.541">them are said to be extraterrestrial</text>
  <text start="278.15" dur="4.829">consciousness or whatnot but for</text>
  <text start="279.71" dur="5.94">instance instance when a UFO crashes and</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="6.09">they retrieve it what they often find is</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="8.299">a seat and the non-terrestrial will sit</text>
  <text start="289.069" dur="4.88">in this seat and they&amp;#39;ll often have</text>
  <text start="294.37" dur="4.419">contraptions on them sometimes on the</text>
  <text start="296.569" dur="4.051">head I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve heard also on the back as</text>
  <text start="298.789" dur="4.35">well but essentially what it does it</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="4.549">just monitors the resonant frequencies</text>
  <text start="303.139" dur="4.261">coming from your consciousness and</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="4.631">strengthens them and that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="4.169">actually create the UFO craft around</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="4.97">them they&amp;#39;re able to materialize matter</text>
  <text start="311.569" dur="5.551">with their mind and create this craft or</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="4.509">bring themselves into a higher energetic</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="4.949">state and this become Orbis</text>
  <text start="319.279" dur="4.23">so there&amp;#39;s technologies that can exist</text>
  <text start="322.069" dur="3.78">consciousness that don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="323.509" dur="4.56">inside of you and don&amp;#39;t have any need</text>
  <text start="325.849" dur="3.6">for a kind of artificial intelligence do</text>
  <text start="328.069" dur="3.32">you see what I&amp;#39;m saying and what we</text>
  <text start="329.449" dur="3.99">really need to be understanding is how</text>
  <text start="331.389" dur="4.45">powerful and what we can really achieve</text>
  <text start="333.439" dur="4.98">with our own minds and how this whole</text>
  <text start="335.839" dur="5.88">universe is a mental universe in which</text>
  <text start="338.419" dur="6.661">we live so no we don&amp;#39;t need artificial</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="6.241">intelligence right understand yourself</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="4.739">that&amp;#39;s it come to know yourself get get</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="4.139">into a balanced grounded state get</text>
  <text start="349.819" dur="5.46">conscious about what you&amp;#39;re capable of</text>
  <text start="352.099" dur="5.25">and start searching for that potential</text>
  <text start="355.279" dur="5.241">so that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to say about</text>
  <text start="357.349" dur="3.171">that done</text>
  <text start="361.54" dur="5.06">[Music]</text>
