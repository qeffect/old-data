  <text start="4.56" dur="3.15">this one we discuss why investing in</text>
  <text start="6.24" dur="3.96">precious metals could be very beneficial</text>
  <text start="7.71" dur="4.639">for you and how his company can help you</text>
  <text start="10.2" dur="2.149">do that</text>
  <text start="17.81" dur="5.5">alright everybody want to welcome Colin</text>
  <text start="20.58" dur="4.32">from noble gold on to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="3.6">here for the very first time how you</text>
  <text start="24.9" dur="2.94">doing Colin I&amp;#39;m doing good thanks for</text>
  <text start="26.91" dur="4.68">thanks for having me</text>
  <text start="27.84" dur="5.37">appreciate you coming on and supporting</text>
  <text start="31.59" dur="4.649">me and supporting a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="33.21" dur="6.66">there who want to invest away from the</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="5.881">kind of pointless fiat currency system</text>
  <text start="39.87" dur="4.68">that we have and you know speaking of</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="5.07">that let&amp;#39;s talk a little bit about kind</text>
  <text start="44.55" dur="4.68">of going from our current monetary</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="3.66">system back on to the gold standard of</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="4.23">course because there&amp;#39;s been some talk</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="5.549">lately about us going back onto the gold</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="3.57">standard so what do you do you see that</text>
  <text start="56.399" dur="2.221">happening</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="6.24">I mean first and foremost is it even</text>
  <text start="58.62" dur="6.569">possible absolutely it&amp;#39;s possible one of</text>
  <text start="63.27" dur="4.23">the reasons that China has bought so</text>
  <text start="65.189" dur="4.831">much gold over the last 20 years is they</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="4.5">you know their currency the yuan is that</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="4.47">their initial thought was to partially</text>
  <text start="72" dur="4.759">back up buy gold so they&amp;#39;re continuing</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="4.379">to Bible to probably potentially do that</text>
  <text start="76.759" dur="4.72">but most of the countries in the world</text>
  <text start="78.869" dur="4.61">are not happy that were the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="4.981">reserve currency because we can just</text>
  <text start="83.479" dur="5.111">continue to print money on a whim and</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="4.019">when you&amp;#39;re a large country let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re trading let&amp;#39;s say Russia is</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="3.691">trading with another country for oil</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="4.17">they have to use the dollar and the</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="4.98">dollar loses value over that year-long</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="3.57">trade that hurts them they&amp;#39;d rather be</text>
  <text start="99.15" dur="2.64">in gold</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="3.45">you know Bulls up you know from last</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="3.81">year this year Gold&amp;#39;s up almost almost</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="4.95">12% they&amp;#39;d rather mean something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="4.74">gonna hold more value so going back on</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="4.07">the gold standard Trump there was a</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="4.59">mention of him talking about this and</text>
  <text start="112.49" dur="4.51">you know when you look at the math and</text>
  <text start="114.93" dur="4.92">how much money we have out there just</text>
  <text start="117" dur="5.13">dollar bills you know if we go back on</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="3.659">the gold standard you know Google would</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="5.58">probably worth anyway somewhere in the</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="6.42">$50,000 an ounce range you know about 50</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="3.419">times where it is now so I think it</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="3.541">would send some shockwaves through the</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="5.071">markets and and it would make it</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="4.32">people that like to save money they</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="3.09">would be able to save money again that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="2.58">the big problem with our economy is that</text>
  <text start="139.29" dur="3.93">you put the money in a savings account</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="5.19">they pay you basically negative it&amp;#39;s if</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="5.37">you look at a quarter of a percent and</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="5.4">inflation x&amp;#39; the government says is 2%</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s probably much higher that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="150.96" dur="3.63">negative money so I think going back and</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="3.39">the gold standard would be would be</text>
  <text start="154.59" dur="4.71">great for people that balance their</text>
  <text start="156.57" dur="5.13">their books like most Americans people</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="4.02">that save money it would be a real real</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="5.13">coup for those you know those kind of</text>
  <text start="163.32" dur="4.77">Americans yeah and speaking of China</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="3.54">like you mentioned it&amp;#39;s been said that</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="5.31">the BRICS nations Brazil Russia India</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="5.339">China South Africa if I have that right</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="6.3">all those nations have been preparing to</text>
  <text start="175.709" dur="5.761">end the essentially dollar rule over the</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="5.91">world and try to get us all back on gold</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="5.88">standards so I&amp;#39;m sure the current</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="4.2">administration at least I hope first say</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t want to combat that they want</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="3.899">to unify everything work together and a</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="4.08">gold standards kind of makes sense yeah</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="4.351">absolutely yeah I know it makes perfect</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="4.05">sense any you know the talk is maybe we</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t go on a only a gold standard for</text>
  <text start="199.8" dur="4.439">the world but maybe a basket of currency</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="5.49">so instead of us just using the dollar</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="4.651">maybe we use the yuan maybe we use gold</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="4.29">maybe we use silver maybe we use the</text>
  <text start="208.89" dur="5.7">euro you&amp;#39;re not limited and I think that</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="5.64">would give the world a lot more comfort</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="4.95">because obviously as they see our debt</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="4.59">you know continue to grow it makes them</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="3.9">more nervous and everybody all the</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="4.89">countries of the world they hold so much</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="5.1">of our debt they just wonder when when</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.32">will we not be able to pay some of that</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="3.09">debt back and I think that that time is</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="2.579">coming pretty soon</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="5.4">in my opinion yeah if it&amp;#39;s not here</text>
  <text start="233.459" dur="6.511">already I mean Jesus what a you know</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="5.25">recently there&amp;#39;s also been talk of Rand</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="3.989">Paul and his new audit the Fed bill and</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="3.989">that&amp;#39;s a big push that he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="4.951">get public awareness about so what are</text>
  <text start="246.269" dur="4.831">your opinions on that well you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.91" dur="4.26">obviously pushing the mantle for his</text>
  <text start="251.1" dur="4.23">father Ron Paul Ron Paul came with a</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="4.74">great book he real great read called end</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="4.92">the Fed it&amp;#39;s about a ten-year old book</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="5.04">and just talks about how you know the</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="5.9">Fed is not a government institution it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="5.899">basically made up of you know 20</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="5.789">it&amp;#39;s very secretive they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="268.849" dur="5.431">report to anybody they can loan money to</text>
  <text start="271.939" dur="5.51">anybody and you know when you see these</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="5.729">crises happen in 2008 and you see</text>
  <text start="277.449" dur="5.201">average people getting kicked out of</text>
  <text start="280.009" dur="4.081">their homes average people that are just</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="3.69">struggling and then you see these</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="6.419">wealthy bankers none of them have been</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="6.379">prosecuted they all got bailed out you</text>
  <text start="290.509" dur="4.741">know you just wonder you know why are we</text>
  <text start="292.719" dur="4.961">allowed to have this institution in</text>
  <text start="295.25" dur="4.379">place that is so corrupt and can</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="3.6">basically just dictate their own rules</text>
  <text start="299.629" dur="3.66">and really just they just protect their</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="6.09">own their own cronies their own friends</text>
  <text start="303.289" dur="5.85">so I would love to audit the Fed and</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="3.69">also while we&amp;#39;re doing that let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.139" dur="4.111">go ahead and get into Fort Knox and see</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="3.78">if there&amp;#39;s any gold there because there</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="3.36">hasn&amp;#39;t been any Americans there hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="4.889">been any outside people in Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="5.429">since 1982 and there&amp;#39;s nobody that can</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="3.84">say that there&amp;#39;s any gold there and I</text>
  <text start="322.039" dur="4.011">think a lot of people think that the the</text>
  <text start="323.569" dur="5.46">Gold&amp;#39;s been sold or lent other countries</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="4.959">and and what you&amp;#39;re seeing is countries</text>
  <text start="329.029" dur="3.661">repatriating their gold like you know</text>
  <text start="331.009" dur="3.181">Germany a few years ago said we want all</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="3.39">the gold back that store to Newark</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="4.289">because we don&amp;#39;t trust your government</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="3.989">we don&amp;#39;t trust your credit and I think</text>
  <text start="338.479" dur="4.5">that these things are happening people</text>
  <text start="340.069" dur="4.59">are finally realizing that this Bohemia</text>
  <text start="342.979" dur="3.93">if this country is not as strong as they</text>
  <text start="344.659" dur="4.891">think it is it&amp;#39;s not as wealthy as they</text>
  <text start="346.909" dur="5.521">think it is and you know if it turns out</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="5.06">there is no gold there in Fort Knox I</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="5.01">think that would would send a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="4.179">ripples to our economy especially the</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="3.149">stock market the dollar I think would</text>
  <text start="358.789" dur="4.231">tank I mean I&amp;#39;ve heard plenty of stories</text>
  <text start="360.589" dur="4.08">about gold bars being found around</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="3.269">America with tungsten in the middle or</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="2.851">some kind of equal weight to make it</text>
  <text start="366.289" dur="3.18">look like there&amp;#39;s more gold than there</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="4.56">really is and they fill the middle of it</text>
  <text start="369.469" dur="5.521">ya know it&amp;#39;s you have to be careful who</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="5.369">you get in and your silver so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="5.13">really common silver bars which a lot of</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="4.62">stores comes out every year of a story</text>
  <text start="380.12" dur="3.269">where they test it and that&amp;#39;s why you</text>
  <text start="382.069" dur="4.051">know you want to go with a reputable</text>
  <text start="383.389" dur="4.921">person you have to be careful on certain</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="4.979">sources like eBay it&amp;#39;s certain places</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="5.46">because you know they could easily</text>
  <text start="391.099" dur="4.32">replace those bars coins are much more</text>
  <text start="393.77" dur="3.75">difficult you know like a silver coin</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="4.17">like this one it&amp;#39;s hard to make a</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="3.209">fraudulent coin I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="399.589" dur="4.41">shy</text>
  <text start="400.729" dur="5.011">this is a five ounce silver coin I start</text>
  <text start="403.999" dur="4.01">to make a fraudulent coin because if</text>
  <text start="405.74" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s fraudulent the mint mark will be</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="3.43">separated or scratched so anyone that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="3.599">really looking at it would be able to</text>
  <text start="411.439" dur="3.54">seal it there&amp;#39;s also a seal on the side</text>
  <text start="413.749" dur="3.931">of it too it makes it much more</text>
  <text start="414.979" dur="5.46">difficult so coins are a little bit more</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="5.97">difficult very rare to see any kind of</text>
  <text start="420.439" dur="4.95">fraudulent coins out there but yeah you</text>
  <text start="423.65" dur="4.079">have to you have to make sure that you</text>

  <text start="648.48" dur="4.56">20,000 you have to sell it you have that</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="3.3">big game that you have to pay taxes on</text>
  <text start="653.04" dur="3.719">and a lot of people aren&amp;#39;t aware of that</text>
  <text start="654.66" dur="3.599">or they don&amp;#39;t think they have to pay it</text>
  <text start="656.759" dur="3">and a lot of people are going to get in</text>

  <text start="679.49" dur="5.08">352,000 keep it in the IRA and you pay</text>
  <text start="682.62" dur="3.75">the taxes later it&amp;#39;s tax deferred you</text>
  <text start="684.57" dur="4.2">pay it when you retire if you did that</text>
  <text start="686.37" dur="6.27">same scenario and you didn&amp;#39;t use an IRA</text>
  <text start="688.77" dur="5.49">now you have that huge gain and you got</text>
  <text start="692.64" dur="3.78">Uncle Sam&amp;#39;s gonna come and say hey you</text>
  <text start="694.26" dur="3.72">got to pay you made you know three</text>

  <text start="705.18" dur="3.96">if you&amp;#39;re new into it we really do</text>
  <text start="707.67" dur="3.03">everything we hold people&amp;#39;s hands</text>

  <text start="729.63" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s volatile so we you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="732.27" dur="4.92">for everybody but if someone does want</text>

  <text start="776.79" dur="4.5">process of educating them getting there</text>
  <text start="779.07" dur="3.81">and I think the biggest thing that we do</text>
  <text start="781.29" dur="3.15">is help people with the paperwork once</text>
  <text start="782.88" dur="3.66">they decide to do it the hardest thing</text>

  <text start="793.35" dur="3.51">protect it how do you do the paperwork</text>
  <text start="794.79" dur="5.64">you go to a professional being</text>
  <text start="796.86" dur="5.91">self-employed you can open a SAP IRA</text>
  <text start="800.43" dur="4.56">is a cell for self-employed people and</text>
  <text start="802.77" dur="3.54">you can put more money aside than it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="804.99" dur="3.75">just a regular person because you have a</text>
  <text start="806.31" dur="4.14">business and so there&amp;#39;s paperwork there</text>
  <text start="808.74" dur="4.47">and and sometimes that paperwork can be</text>
  <text start="810.45" dur="5.67">daunting we do all that in-house we have</text>
  <text start="813.21" dur="5.16">a team we do that paperwork or maybe you</text>
