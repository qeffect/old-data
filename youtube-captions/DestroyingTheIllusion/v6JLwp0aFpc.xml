  <text start="43.06" dur="4.71">course because there is censorship</text>
  <text start="44.559" dur="6.241">basically all across the board hitting</text>
  <text start="47.77" dur="6.719">multiple different avenues from social</text>
  <text start="50.8" dur="4.95">media YouTube and Twitter and you just</text>
  <text start="54.489" dur="3.421">mentioned to me there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="55.75" dur="5.76">censorship going on with cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="57.91" dur="6.66">as well because that&amp;#39;s your specialty</text>
  <text start="61.51" dur="5.31">so disgust with myself and the viewers a</text>
  <text start="64.57" dur="5.63">little bit about the censorship that</text>
  <text start="66.82" dur="5.939">you&amp;#39;re seeing in the financial markets</text>
  <text start="70.2" dur="5.919">well I mean you know like what happened</text>
  <text start="72.759" dur="5.371">to you with you know in your social</text>
  <text start="76.119" dur="3.75">media world is that if you know the</text>
  <text start="78.13" dur="3.5">people that are in charge I think they</text>
  <text start="79.869" dur="3.931">thought social media was a great idea</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="4.45">until they realized that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="83.8" dur="4.319">opposing points of view and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="86.08" dur="4.5">just propaganda down our throat and now</text>
  <text start="88.119" dur="5.131">they&amp;#39;re trying to you know carve and</text>
  <text start="90.58" dur="4.32">massage the message and you know I was</text>
  <text start="93.25" dur="3.78">out talking to somebody yesterday and</text>
  <text start="94.9" dur="5.37">you know when the cryptocurrency started</text>
  <text start="97.03" dur="5.97">to fall from their all-time highs in</text>
  <text start="100.27" dur="4.8">December you had the bankers coming out</text>
  <text start="103" dur="4.17">really hard about haters going to zero</text>
  <text start="105.07" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s a fraud it&amp;#39;s a Ponzi it&amp;#39;s this and</text>
  <text start="107.17" dur="5.85">and he just you get to see the Twitter</text>
  <text start="110.38" dur="4.95">box just trying to just pound people</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="3.54">into that point of view and then what</text>
  <text start="115.33" dur="2.609">really was happening is they were</text>
  <text start="116.56" dur="3.27">looking to get it actually into the</text>
  <text start="117.939" dur="3.841">cryptocurrency market and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="119.83" dur="3.6">the power of the media to shape a</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="5.699">message so they can buy things on a</text>
  <text start="123.43" dur="5.82">cheap and that&amp;#39;s how the banker I would</text>
  <text start="127.479" dur="3.211">call the Wall Street that&amp;#39;s their theme</text>
  <text start="129.25" dur="3.6">they you know they want to position</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="5.07">themselves so they use deception and</text>
  <text start="132.85" dur="5.82">they use you know their point of view de</text>
  <text start="135.76" dur="6.42">to what we call it managing people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="5.37">expectations and and so the thing now is</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="4.32">that they got in and now they&amp;#39;ve bought</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="5.55">the kryptos back up because I think they</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="5.37">realize that there&amp;#39;s a war between</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="5.269">what&amp;#39;s called banking assets and non</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="5.94">banking assets gold silver miners crypto</text>
  <text start="154.859" dur="5.591">versus Wall Street stocks and bonds and</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="3.539">currencies and so I&amp;#39;m not surprised that</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="3.299">you&amp;#39;re getting hand</text>
  <text start="161.349" dur="4.17">on your side - because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="163.749" dur="3.75">the message out they want to they want</text>
  <text start="165.519" dur="4.681">to get in and want to control every</text>
  <text start="167.499" dur="5.401">asset they can but on the crypto side</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="5.009">they really can&amp;#39;t censor it and let me</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="4.05">explain and I think I think in social</text>
  <text start="175.209" dur="5.041">media it&amp;#39;s gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna happen to us</text>
  <text start="176.95" dur="6.03">- on a positive basis crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="5.549">are what they call decentralized that</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="5.25">means when a transaction happens it gets</text>
  <text start="185.799" dur="4.47">spread across many many thousands what</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="4.619">they call nodes those are basically</text>
  <text start="190.269" dur="5.28">people or entities with servers that</text>
  <text start="192.849" dur="4.741">confirm the transaction and because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.549" dur="4.65">peer-to-peer you and I are transacting</text>
  <text start="197.59" dur="5.25">transacting together we don&amp;#39;t have to go</text>
  <text start="200.199" dur="4.801">through a bank and a bank is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="4.709">called a censoring agent they can deny</text>
  <text start="205" dur="4.949">that transaction and you see it in</text>
  <text start="207.549" dur="5.28">YouTube they just decide to de monetize</text>
  <text start="209.949" dur="5.731">or they decide to drop users off I think</text>
  <text start="212.829" dur="5.97">Cheryl Atkinson was actually doing a</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="3.69">live broadcast I was watching her view</text>
  <text start="218.799" dur="3.75">count</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="4.679">falling while she was actually doing the</text>
  <text start="222.549" dur="4.59">interview and that&amp;#39;s mathematically</text>
  <text start="224.049" dur="6.481">impossible list of manipulation well the</text>
  <text start="227.139" dur="5.641">cryptocurrencies or the token market or</text>
  <text start="230.53" dur="4.44">the blockchain market it prevents that</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="4.919">because you you you have you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="4.379">a centralized Authority so the good news</text>
  <text start="237.699" dur="4.231">for people in the crypto market is that</text>
  <text start="239.349" dur="4.95">once those transactions happen you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="4.769">be you can&amp;#39;t be censored if I want to</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="4.65">send you money on a Bitcoin you know</text>
  <text start="246.699" dur="3.81">four things I owe you or you owe me we</text>
  <text start="248.949" dur="4.111">can just do the transaction I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="250.509" dur="5.31">to get permission from PayPal or Square</text>
  <text start="253.06" dur="7.019">or city core or Federal Reserve or</text>
  <text start="255.819" dur="7.081">anybody and eventually you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="4.501">decentralized social media - and what</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="4.5">that means to you and to me is that</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="5.519">we&amp;#39;re asset creators you know we have we</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="5.639">have content we&amp;#39;re creating value in in</text>
  <text start="270.099" dur="5.761">the value chain and and you get to</text>
  <text start="273.039" dur="4.38">present that out to the world then so</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="5.279">you don&amp;#39;t have to go through and beg</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="6.661">YouTube or beg Twitter or beg Facebook</text>
  <text start="281.139" dur="5.33">is my content acceptable you put your</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="5.309">content out there across multiple</text>
  <text start="286.469" dur="4.841">databases and people decide whether they</text>
  <text start="289.389" dur="4.65">find what you do is valuable or not and</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="3.579">so that I think that&amp;#39;s the big battle</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="2.951">it&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="294.889" dur="4.201">now you know I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="296.99" dur="3.57">win the battle Jordan I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.09" dur="3.21">why should say they&amp;#39;re not gonna win the</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="3.629">war they may they may win these battles</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="5.01">here and there but they&amp;#39;re simply just</text>
  <text start="304.189" dur="5.76">gonna drive people off of the</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="3.659">decentralized media and and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.949" dur="3.511">gonna go drive people in these</text>
  <text start="310.969" dur="4.651">decentralized mediums and and I think at</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="3.9">the end of the day you know anybody</text>
  <text start="315.62" dur="3.99">who&amp;#39;s useful or produces things are</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="4.32">gonna win so that&amp;#39;s what I was talking</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="4.079">about in the censorship side too is that</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="4.169">you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t need permission in</text>
  <text start="323.689" dur="3.51">the cryptocurrency world and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="325.849" dur="4.711">gonna be permission in what they call</text>
  <text start="327.199" dur="5.52">the blockchain world either right I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="4.46">actually seen some social media avenues</text>
  <text start="332.719" dur="6.861">that are beginning to use the blockchain</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="7.899">technology and crypto currencies as that</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="4.959">advertising medium as well what&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="342.919" dur="4.441">kind of thoughts on those I have yet to</text>
  <text start="344.539" dur="4.5">kind of cruise into them but yeah</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="4.709">there&amp;#39;s a couple tokens out there that</text>
  <text start="349.039" dur="5.46">do that and also seem it is uh is it is</text>
  <text start="352.069" dur="4.53">a token that actually you put videos out</text>
  <text start="354.499" dur="4.861">there your audience votes on whether</text>
  <text start="356.599" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s valuable or not and you actually</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="6.029">get paid in those tokens which you can</text>
  <text start="361.789" dur="4.981">always convert into into you know fiat</text>

  <text start="435.44" dur="4.74">somebody looking at cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="7.32">wanting to invest or invest more they</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="9.03">might be nervous because of this the war</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="6.18">on it I&amp;#39;m sorry intership so what would</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="4.35">what would you say to people who are</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="5.04">nervous about it yeah you know it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="4.68">asset class like everything else the</text>
  <text start="455.87" dur="5.64">thing that you have to realize is it is</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="6.24">growing exponentially so day to day</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="5.16">price fluctuations need to be expected</text>
  <text start="464.48" dur="4.98">but at the end of the day the</text>
  <text start="466.67" dur="5.4">cryptocurrency space is only a 500</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="5.7">billion dollar what they call market cap</text>
  <text start="472.07" dur="4.77">in an environment that that&amp;#39;s hundreds</text>
  <text start="475.16" dur="5.07">of trillions of dollars worth of assets</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="5.67">worldwide so it&amp;#39;s very small but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.23" dur="3.48">growing rapidly and more and more people</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="2.52">are going to hop up what they call the</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="3.2">centralized environment into</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="4.35">decentralized environment so over time</text>
  <text start="486.91" dur="5.8">your value of the coins that you pick</text>
  <text start="489.38" dur="5.31">will will go up over time now what we do</text>
  <text start="492.71" dur="4.35">because we are traders and we&amp;#39;ve traded</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="5.04">for a long time is that we simply apply</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="4.59">our trading tools because it works the</text>
  <text start="499.73" dur="4.71">same way and everything works on price</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="5.19">and volume and we have trading</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="4.92">indicators that tell us hey there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="6.03">time to either buy or add to there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="5.36">time to sell or to reduce and so over</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="5.34">time we&amp;#39;re just building our wealth and</text>
  <text start="514.72" dur="5.47">we&amp;#39;ll let the gyrations happen things go</text>
  <text start="518.21" dur="4.8">up and down in crypto markers like they</text>
  <text start="520.19" dur="6.09">do anywhere else well we&amp;#39;re now at added</text>
  <text start="523.01" dur="6.12">a junction here where I think the</text>
  <text start="526.28" dur="6.45">downtrend that started in December is</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="5.37">over and you saw two weeks ago Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="3.09">was up is up eighty percent from where</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="3.6">it was two weeks ago when the stock</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="3.54">market got a little bit nervous people</text>
  <text start="538.1" dur="4.74">flooded into the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="4.86">marketplace and so now continued</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="3.18">weakness in the stock markets gonna</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="4.08">drive cryptocurrencies through the roof</text>
  <text start="546.02" dur="3.69">in our view and so we&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.3" dur="4.47">just following the price and volume</text>
