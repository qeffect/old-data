  <text start="0.03" dur="6.269">what&amp;#39;s up guys it&amp;#39;s May 5th and what I</text>
  <text start="3.629" dur="5.341">want to do in today&amp;#39;s video is give you</text>
  <text start="6.299" dur="5.611">a basic overview on what exactly the</text>
  <text start="8.97" dur="4.41">secret space program is I&amp;#39;m gonna crunch</text>
  <text start="11.91" dur="4.65">some numbers for you and this will give</text>
  <text start="13.38" dur="6.33">you a good idea of how it started how it</text>
  <text start="16.56" dur="4.86">developed and where it is now and before</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="4.05">I get into this video though I want to</text>
  <text start="21.42" dur="5.25">make a note on these words right here</text>
  <text start="23.76" dur="5.099">secret space program because when people</text>
  <text start="26.67" dur="5.519">hear these words or sometimes is just</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="5.97">called SSP the system but the secret</text>
  <text start="32.189" dur="5.661">space program the connotation a lot of</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="4.921">people get from that is simply just</text>
  <text start="37.85" dur="3.76">spacecraft that we don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="39.75" dur="3.03">because of these words you know secret</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="2.67">space program oh you know some</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="5.07">spacecraft that we just NASA didn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="44.28" dur="7.439">us about but what I want to offer to you</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="6.93">in that when you hear this term I want</text>
  <text start="51.719" dur="4.921">you to think of all the black projects</text>
  <text start="54.78" dur="3.75">that we&amp;#39;re not told about because this</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="4.649">is a very general term and it&amp;#39;s somewhat</text>
  <text start="58.53" dur="5.31">of a blanket term because of course very</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="5.911">well there are a lot of space ships we</text>
  <text start="63.84" dur="4.98">aren&amp;#39;t told about and we can research</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="4.44">those and finds plenty of information on</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="5.49">that so there very well is stuff above</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="4.799">our heads that are secret but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="4.199">also a lot of stuff underground that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="4.29">secret and if you never heard of the</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="5.491">name Phil Schneider look him up and just</text>
  <text start="80.729" dur="5.941">get a general idea of what he did he was</text>
  <text start="84" dur="4.65">murdered in 1994 I believe for blowing</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.46">the whistle but before his murder what</text>
  <text start="88.65" dur="6.06">he was doing was you know again blowing</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="5.07">the whistle on his involvement in</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="5.78">creating what&amp;#39;s called dumbs d um bees</text>
  <text start="97.2" dur="6.54">or deep underground military bases and</text>
  <text start="100.49" dur="4.96">these domes are essentially all over</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="5.489">America if not all over the world and</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="5.76">they are huge bases created underground</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="4.981">and they go stories and stories and</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="4.5">stories down so not only do we have a</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="4.799">bunch of secret stuff above our heads</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="6.24">but we can just speculate as to what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="6.39">going on below the ground could be any</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="5.279">kind of engineering from engineering</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="4.621">these actual spacecraft just below the</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="6.211">ground could be engineering</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="6.48">genetics whatever type of you know stuff</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="8.9">they want to do - sounds weird nasty but</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="9.09">humans or animals or could be where they</text>
  <text start="142.34" dur="4.9">create their bio warfare agent you know</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="3.18">just whatever you want to speculate on</text>
  <text start="147.24" dur="3.6">going under gun so we have a bug grab</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re below ground we have we have more</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="5.16">black projects in the hands of the CIA</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="5.45">one for instance is called the Montauk</text>
  <text start="156" dur="5.76">Project in this secret project</text>
  <text start="158.36" dur="5.92">researched human consciousness remote</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="5.45">viewing and how to actually play around</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="5.46">with timelines and time travel very</text>
  <text start="167.21" dur="4.54">interesting stuff but basically just</text>
  <text start="169.74" dur="4.71">what I&amp;#39;m saying is when you hear secret</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="5.46">space program just think of everything</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;re not told about below ground above</text>
  <text start="177.21" dur="4.11">ground wherever so that&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="180" dur="3.99">caveat that I wanted to make before we</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="4.32">get into these and now let&amp;#39;s do it</text>
  <text start="183.99" dur="4.26">the first number this is kind of gonna</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="4.95">go in chronicle chronological order to</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="6.12">give you an idea of how it started and</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="7.95">then developed so first we have 74 74</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="8.03">years since nikola tesla died nikola</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="6.36">tesla of course the fantastic</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="5.47">electricity researcher engineer inventor</text>
  <text start="204.9" dur="6.33">who basically gave us our modern age and</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="7.11">would have given us a much more modern</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="5.97">age if his papers weren&amp;#39;t swiped when he</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="5.91">died because you see when he died in his</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="6.84">New York apartment in 1943 literally the</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="6.42">FBI busted down his door and swiped all</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="6.03">his papers all we have left from Nikola</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="5.46">Tesla are is just the very basic</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="5.34">simplified research of his we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="3.45">access to all the good stuff that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="235.41" dur="4.59">the hands of the military-industrial</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.73">complex so they have that and I also</text>
  <text start="240" dur="3.99">wrote down a couple names here to</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="4.2">discuss with you a little more so one is</text>
  <text start="243.99" dur="4.74">the name t Townsend Brown Thomas</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="4.92">Townsend Brown he was an American</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="4.74">inventor in the same time frame as</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="6.389">Nikola Tesla in the 20s 30s and 40s and</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="6.28">what he was doing was making metal discs</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="5.231">levitate through simply</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="4.71">high electromagnetic voltage he would</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="2.64">literally control gravity with</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="4.2">electricity</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="6.45">he called it electrogravitics and his</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="5.82">public research he was even making you</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="4.62">know large disks bigger than me fly</text>
  <text start="274.48" dur="5.12">around at hundreds of miles an hour and</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="6.54">this was again in the 30s right</text>
  <text start="279.6" dur="5.47">his research ended up in the hands of</text>
  <text start="282.94" dur="5.94">the military industrial complex think</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="6.57">take think-tank the RAND Corporation so</text>
  <text start="288.88" dur="3.9">we have Tesla&amp;#39;s research end up in the</text>
  <text start="291.64" dur="3.69">hands of the American</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="4.89">military-industrial complex we also have</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="4.68">Thomas Townsend Browns work ending up in</text>
  <text start="297.67" dur="3.99">the hands of the same people and then I</text>
  <text start="300.01" dur="4.29">wrote down one more name here and this</text>
  <text start="301.66" dur="4.68">is named viktor schauberger if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="304.3" dur="5.46">know viktor schauberger was he was a</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="6.89">german physicist and inventor and</text>
  <text start="309.76" dur="6.27">engineer and brilliant mind mind in</text>
  <text start="313.23" dur="4.33">europe in austria and in germany again</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="4.05">in the nineteen kind of 20s and 30s the</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="7.71">same timeframe the Germans</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="8.94">essentially forced him to research for</text>
  <text start="325.27" dur="6.21">them and he did some basic research into</text>
  <text start="329.02" dur="5.49">the same type of gravity control and the</text>
  <text start="331.48" dur="4.74">torsion physics that these guys were</text>
  <text start="334.51" dur="3.15">doing more specifically him he was more</text>
  <text start="336.22" dur="5.33">gravity control Tom&amp;#39;s down to brown</text>
  <text start="337.66" dur="8.75">Nikola Tesla was more so free energy</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="7.81">zero-point energy but same ideas in that</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="6.009">all of their research ended up in the</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="6.21">hands of the powers that be per se</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="4.381">because viktor schauberger his research</text>
  <text start="355.57" dur="3.03">ended up in hands that the germans in</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="4.679">the 30s and if you don&amp;#39;t know by now</text>
  <text start="358.6" dur="7.17">many people do is that after world war</text>
  <text start="361.479" dur="6.69">ii many of those german scientists and</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="5.97">researchers were shuttled into america</text>
  <text start="368.169" dur="4.801">under Operation Paperclip and a lot of</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="2.55">that research ended up in the hands of</text>
  <text start="372.97" dur="3.78">again the American military-industrial</text>
  <text start="374.29" dur="4.92">complex a good point to make you got to</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="3.96">take imaginary lines called borders out</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="3.33">of the picture and out of your brain</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="5.25">when thinking of how the world really</text>
  <text start="382.54" dur="5.76">works it helps a lot so all of these</text>
  <text start="385.96" dur="4.789">guys research ended up in the hands of</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="4.759">the Cabal</text>
  <text start="390.749" dur="4.53">and it&amp;#39;s been that way for decades more</text>
  <text start="393.059" dur="6.21">than 74 years because this is just since</text>
  <text start="395.279" dur="5.94">when Nikola Tesla died 20s 30s 20s and</text>
  <text start="399.269" dur="6.42">30s so we could easily say a hundred</text>
  <text start="401.219" dur="7.8">years that the powers that be and soon</text>
  <text start="405.689" dur="8.91">to be were if not already were had all</text>
  <text start="409.019" dur="7.56">this fun science next number 70 70 years</text>
  <text start="414.599" dur="3.66">since Roswell and I&amp;#39;m not going to spend</text>
  <text start="416.579" dur="4.47">too much time on this one</text>
  <text start="418.259" dur="7.16">but I&amp;#39;m just gonna get it down to basics</text>
  <text start="421.049" dur="8.07">what happened with Roswell was that our</text>
  <text start="425.419" dur="7.631">American military was testing very</text>
  <text start="429.119" dur="5.34">primitive scalar weapons or what you</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="3.989">could call a let directed</text>
  <text start="434.459" dur="4.29">electromagnetic weapons colloquial</text>
  <text start="437.039" dur="4.35">colloquially some people call it the</text>
  <text start="438.749" dur="5.31">Tesla death ray but it&amp;#39;s basically just</text>
  <text start="441.389" dur="5.31">elected directed electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="444.059" dur="5.551">frequencies that can blow up a target</text>
  <text start="446.699" dur="5.52">and what occurred with Roswell is they</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="5.789">were testing these in the New Mexico</text>
  <text start="452.219" dur="8.07">desert in whatever year that went down</text>
  <text start="455.399" dur="7.92">47 so 70 years ago and those weapons</text>
  <text start="460.289" dur="4.77">took down those crafts three crafts two</text>
  <text start="463.319" dur="4.44">or three I&amp;#39;ve heard different numbers</text>
  <text start="465.059" dur="5.7">but took down some alien crafts now this</text>
  <text start="467.759" dur="6.39">is an important point to make and when</text>
  <text start="470.759" dur="5.28">understanding again the state of the</text>
  <text start="474.149" dur="4.711">world when you think about non</text>
  <text start="476.039" dur="5.99">terrestrial civilizations you cannot</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="5.969">think of them as being you know</text>
  <text start="482.029" dur="5.44">omnipotent omniscient invincible gods</text>
  <text start="484.829" dur="4.68">non terrestrial civilizations yes</text>
  <text start="487.469" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re more advanced yes they</text>
  <text start="489.509" dur="5.67">understand a little bit of allure about</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="6.899">these Sciences and cosmic laws than we</text>
  <text start="495.179" dur="5.121">do down here as muggles on earth but</text>
  <text start="498.509" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re not infallible okay</text>
  <text start="500.3" dur="6.159">we were testing very primitive science</text>
  <text start="504.809" dur="4.56">very primitive technology that we got</text>
  <text start="506.459" dur="4.95">from these guys and took down some craft</text>
  <text start="509.369" dur="4.29">in Roswell you can look into the restore</text>
  <text start="511.409" dur="5.28">the testimony of a man named sergeant</text>
  <text start="513.659" dur="5.01">Clifford stone he&amp;#39;s testified for the</text>
  <text start="516.689" dur="6.811">disclosure project and he was recently</text>
  <text start="518.669" dur="5.701">on the Gaia Network but he is allegedly</text>
  <text start="523.5" dur="3.12">he was a</text>
  <text start="524.37" dur="4.409">early part of the crash retrieval teams</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="3.9">that went and retrieved those craft and</text>
  <text start="528.779" dur="4.761">once our military industrial complex</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="6.48">retrieved those down craft they then</text>
  <text start="533.54" dur="6.76">reverse engineered them so this allowed</text>
  <text start="537" dur="6.12">the powers that be or were to make a</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="4.74">quantum leap in the technology that they</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="5.09">had so they were they had a little bit</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="5.61">of it here once this happened boom</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="5.08">huge stride forward so this is like a</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="4.5">you know pretty little Christmas present</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="5.28">they took down for themselves in the New</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="6.27">Mexico desert so there&amp;#39;s that advanced</text>
  <text start="558.57" dur="6.2">science much more advanced science and</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="6.48">that brings us into this number 5,300</text>
  <text start="564.77" dur="7.66">this is the number of the amount of</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="8.9">patents as of 2012 that are classified</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="8.19">for matters of national security okay</text>
  <text start="576.8" dur="5.44">phone&amp;#39;s gonna die there 5300 now this</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="3.96">number was found out through the use of</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="3.72">Freedom of Information Act requests and</text>
  <text start="584.58" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a general number but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.96" dur="3.27">about fifty three hundred one number</text>
  <text start="587.94" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;ve heard was five thousand one hundred</text>
  <text start="589.23" dur="5.729">twenty five and this was all about you</text>
  <text start="592.92" dur="4.77">know five six seven years ago I&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="594.959" dur="5.601">heard that that number is almost upwards</text>
  <text start="597.69" dur="5.49">of six thousand now but this is how many</text>
  <text start="600.56" dur="5.59">patents are classified patenting is a</text>
  <text start="603.18" dur="4.47">very dangerous thing to do that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.15" dur="4.17">how the powers that be you&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="607.65" dur="6.2">stifle new research and new inventions</text>
  <text start="610.32" dur="6.75">into literally the liberating science of</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="5.5">free energy or zero-point physics they</text>
  <text start="617.07" dur="5.13">do it through patenting because you send</text>
  <text start="619.35" dur="5.19">that patent in and they can pull their</text>
  <text start="622.2" dur="4.41">invention secrecy act on you and take</text>
  <text start="624.54" dur="5.549">away and classify for matters of again</text>
  <text start="626.61" dur="5.04">national security in 1951 this was</text>
  <text start="630.089" dur="3.331">passed it&amp;#39;s called the invention secrecy</text>
  <text start="631.65" dur="3.72">act in the invention secrecy act</text>
  <text start="633.42" dur="4.68">basically stated that any branch of</text>
  <text start="635.37" dur="4.65">government the army the Navy NSA CIA</text>
  <text start="638.1" dur="3.57">even the Department of Defense or the</text>
  <text start="640.02" dur="5.64">State Department they can classify</text>
  <text start="641.67" dur="8.13">whatever patent they want to secret if</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="5.58">it again falls under a threat to</text>
  <text start="649.8" dur="3.42">national security which sounds</text>
  <text start="651.24" dur="4.89">absolutely arbitrary because it is</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="3.869">because if somebody were to come out</text>
  <text start="656.13" dur="3.899">with</text>
  <text start="657.089" dur="5.91">any type of patents that would basically</text>
  <text start="660.029" dur="5.88">destroy the petrodollar destroyed the</text>
  <text start="662.999" dur="4.53">system in which we have they need to put</text>
  <text start="665.909" dur="4.29">you know they need to put a hush-hush on</text>
  <text start="667.529" dur="4.92">that and most of these patents most of</text>
  <text start="670.199" dur="5.46">the fifty three to six thousand patents</text>
  <text start="672.449" dur="5.4">that are classified have to do with free</text>
  <text start="675.659" dur="4.62">energy with electromagnetic energy</text>
  <text start="677.849" dur="4.77">creation with the very occulted or</text>
  <text start="680.279" dur="7.08">secretive sciences that we&amp;#39;re not taught</text>
  <text start="682.619" dur="6.15">in college so this number is well 1951</text>
  <text start="687.359" dur="4.31">this is a very important a very</text>
  <text start="688.769" dur="8.7">interesting year you could say because</text>
  <text start="691.669" dur="9.81">nikola tesla died in 1943 his research</text>
  <text start="697.469" dur="7.25">you know was in the 40s 30s and 40s</text>
  <text start="701.479" dur="6.01">viktor schauberger he was in the 30s</text>
  <text start="704.719" dur="6.58">they took down the Roswell craft and</text>
  <text start="707.489" dur="7.4">1947 so what do we have here Oh awesome</text>
  <text start="711.299" dur="12.23">also a paperclip operation paperclip</text>
  <text start="714.889" dur="8.64">that ran from 1947 it mister to 1951</text>
  <text start="723.619" dur="4.66">interesting date there so essentially</text>
  <text start="726.029" dur="4.74">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that once the</text>
  <text start="728.279" dur="5.7">military-industrial complex found out</text>
  <text start="730.769" dur="4.8">that they had science they had really</text>
  <text start="733.979" dur="2.97">advanced science then they had a bunch</text>
  <text start="735.569" dur="4.34">of scientists come over here who could</text>
  <text start="736.949" dur="8.49">build out that science they wanted to</text>
  <text start="739.909" dur="7.42">put a hush-hush on anybody trying to do</text>
  <text start="745.439" dur="3.48">research or delve into what they wanted</text>
  <text start="747.329" dur="4.11">to keep secret essentially so boom</text>
  <text start="748.919" dur="3.84">invention secrecy act it&amp;#39;s playing this</text>
  <text start="751.439" dur="4.89">day when to connect all these dots</text>
  <text start="752.759" dur="6.33">really easy and then our last little</text>
  <text start="756.329" dur="7.31">number here are tiny little number of 10</text>
  <text start="759.089" dur="10.98">trillion 10 trillion as you can see here</text>
  <text start="763.639" dur="8.62">dollars missing from the Pentagon let me</text>
  <text start="770.069" dur="4.11">put that into perspective for you here</text>
  <text start="772.259" dur="3.33">and this part of the video I might get a</text>
  <text start="774.179" dur="3.9">little heated and raise my voice a</text>
  <text start="775.589" dur="5.25">little bit 10 trillion dollars is</text>
  <text start="778.079" dur="5.01">missing from the Pentagon that&amp;#39;s three</text>

  <text start="809.19" dur="5.61">know I would put that to very good use</text>
  <text start="811.26" dur="6.48">you should say ten trillion dollars you</text>
  <text start="814.8" dur="11.25">see on check this date out check this</text>
  <text start="817.74" dur="13.97">date what date is that right September</text>
  <text start="826.05" dur="7.13">10th 2001 the day before 9/11 Donald</text>
  <text start="831.71" dur="4.51">Rumsfeld</text>
  <text start="833.18" dur="6.22">himself yes Donald Rumsfeld the guy that</text>
  <text start="836.22" dur="5.07">you know used to work for Monsanto and</text>
  <text start="839.4" dur="3.87">created aspartame and somehow got into</text>
  <text start="841.29" dur="4.65">politics and ended up in what like</text>
  <text start="843.27" dur="5.509">Reagan&amp;#39;s cabinet and who was the what</text>
  <text start="845.94" dur="5.61">Secretary of Defense under George Bush</text>
  <text start="848.779" dur="5.731">he himself was testifying in front of</text>
  <text start="851.55" dur="7.77">Congress on this date to two point three</text>
  <text start="854.51" dur="6.46">trillion missing from the Pentagon it</text>
  <text start="859.32" dur="3.36">was Cynthia McKinney ex congresswoman</text>
  <text start="860.97" dur="3.99">dr. Cynthia McKinney that was grilling</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="3.93">him frigging woman here all right there</text>
  <text start="864.96" dur="3.36">she was laying him on the line like why</text>
  <text start="866.61" dur="4.02">the heck is that much money missing from</text>
  <text start="868.32" dur="3.81">the Pentagon on that date and you want</text>
  <text start="870.63" dur="2.97">to know his answer you can find his</text>
  <text start="872.13" dur="3.18">answer you can actually you know YouTube</text>
  <text start="873.6" dur="3.72">the video of it he was basically saying</text>
  <text start="875.31" dur="4.19">there&amp;#39;s never been an audit of the</text>
  <text start="877.32" dur="4.68">Pentagon because it would take too long</text>
  <text start="879.5" dur="4.93">cost too much money and require too much</text>
  <text start="882" dur="7.22">manpower and that&amp;#39;s the excuse that they</text>
  <text start="884.43" dur="8.85">have used to avoid audit since 1996 in</text>
  <text start="889.22" dur="8.13">1996 it was made law that every</text>
  <text start="893.28" dur="6.12">government agency had to be audited</text>
  <text start="897.35" dur="5.44">somehow that hasn&amp;#39;t affected the</text>
  <text start="899.4" dur="5.1">Pentagon since then and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="902.79" dur="3.45">excuse they use every single time</text>
  <text start="904.5" dur="7.77">they&amp;#39;re asked about it it would take too</text>
  <text start="906.24" dur="7.44">long cost too much money now as of very</text>
  <text start="912.27" dur="3.03">interesting date - I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="913.68" dur="3.92">point that out next day what happened</text>
  <text start="915.3" dur="4.8">who everybody forgot about that right</text>
  <text start="917.6" dur="5.169">and I&amp;#39;ve also heard stories where the</text>
  <text start="920.1" dur="4.679">world thus building seven right</text>
  <text start="922.769" dur="3.72">Trade Center the building seven the</text>
  <text start="924.779" dur="3.71">third one the day we get hit by a plane</text>
  <text start="926.489" dur="6.59">in New York that fell was actually</text>
  <text start="928.489" dur="6.4">harboring a lot of the research where</text>
  <text start="933.079" dur="3.37">people within the government were</text>
  <text start="934.889" dur="2.7">investigating this and that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="936.449" dur="3.3">took that building down that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="937.589" dur="7.62">hearsay I&amp;#39;m not sure but make sense to</text>
  <text start="939.749" dur="8.481">me now we brings us to 2015 as of 2015</text>
  <text start="945.209" dur="7.86">there was an inspector general report</text>
  <text start="948.23" dur="11.219">that stated this number 2.3 trail is now</text>
  <text start="953.069" dur="9">up to six point five trillion as of 2015</text>
  <text start="959.449" dur="4.721">now I wrote 10 trillion up there because</text>
  <text start="962.069" dur="4.651">that number is estimated to be upwards</text>
  <text start="964.17" dur="5.609">of eight point five to ten trillion now</text>
  <text start="966.72" dur="4.38">you know we have to it&amp;#39;s a big gray area</text>
  <text start="969.779" dur="2.73">there because again we don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="971.1" dur="4.38">much freaking money they&amp;#39;ve swiped from</text>
  <text start="972.509" dur="4.2">us but that was you know that&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="975.48" dur="3.649">official report that came out through</text>
  <text start="976.709" dur="4.98">the government stating oh you know</text>
  <text start="979.129" dur="3.76">different parts of the government are</text>
  <text start="981.689" dur="6.84">swiping a whole African money from us</text>
  <text start="982.889" dur="7.14">and last point to note here before we</text>
  <text start="988.529" dur="4.92">get into putting all these numbers</text>
  <text start="990.029" dur="6.75">together ten trillion just from the</text>
  <text start="993.449" dur="4.92">Pentagon okay there was an article that</text>
  <text start="996.779" dur="4.53">came out about a month ago that showed</text>
  <text start="998.369" dur="4.621">ben Carson the politician that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1001.309" dur="4.53">Trump&amp;#39;s cap cabinet right now he</text>
  <text start="1002.99" dur="4.829">actually audited the housing of the</text>
  <text start="1005.839" dur="4.59">agency of Housing and Urban Development</text>
  <text start="1007.819" dur="5.58">the HUD and he found five hundred</text>
  <text start="1010.429" dur="6.481">billion missing just through that right</text>
  <text start="1013.399" dur="5.4">so we&amp;#39;re talking just public records</text>
  <text start="1016.91" dur="4.109">with these numbers ten trillion from the</text>
  <text start="1018.799" dur="5.64">pentagon 500 billion from the you know</text>
  <text start="1021.019" dur="6.241">the HUD there we have I&amp;#39;ve heard stories</text>
  <text start="1024.439" dur="5.041">about how at the end of every fiscal</text>
  <text start="1027.26" dur="5.73">year there&amp;#39;s tax money in various</text>
  <text start="1029.48" dur="6.27">counties cities state agencies that just</text>
  <text start="1032.99" dur="5.459">kind of goes missing you know heard</text>
  <text start="1035.75" dur="4.86">stories of that so that&amp;#39;s just all the</text>
  <text start="1038.449" dur="4.681">public money we could say ten trillion</text>
  <text start="1040.61" dur="4.199">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if this was</text>
  <text start="1043.13" dur="5.64">actually more like fifteen trillion</text>
  <text start="1044.809" dur="4.47">dollars and then you add in the black</text>
  <text start="1048.77" dur="3.96">market</text>
  <text start="1049.279" dur="6.551">you add in the gun-running drug running</text>
  <text start="1052.73" dur="5.949">human trafficking organ trafficking all</text>
  <text start="1055.83" dur="5.699">that deep dark dirty stuff that fills</text>
  <text start="1058.679" dur="5.041">the cabal&amp;#39;s pocketbooks even more so so</text>
  <text start="1061.529" dur="5.701">we could literally shoot I wouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1063.72" dur="6.059">know if this was twenty trillion or just</text>
  <text start="1067.23" dur="4.11">some absurd number right people are</text>
  <text start="1069.779" dur="2.071">always complaining oh the country&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1071.34" dur="3.63">debt</text>
  <text start="1071.85" dur="4.62">no you idiot we&amp;#39;re you know letting a</text>
  <text start="1074.97" dur="4.62">bunch of people get in power that are</text>
  <text start="1076.47" dur="5.79">robbing us so that&amp;#39;s the point I want to</text>
  <text start="1079.59" dur="4.05">make there is a freak ton of money that</text>
  <text start="1082.26" dur="5.279">we don&amp;#39;t have that we should have but we</text>
  <text start="1083.64" dur="6.419">don&amp;#39;t have and what is that going to</text>
  <text start="1087.539" dur="4.921">well pretty much the most logical</text>
  <text start="1090.059" dur="8.071">conclusion is that all of this money is</text>
  <text start="1092.46" dur="9.719">going right here so let&amp;#39;s recap about a</text>
  <text start="1098.13" dur="6.36">hundred years ago the powers that be get</text>
  <text start="1102.179" dur="4.681">some really frickin cool science in</text>
  <text start="1104.49" dur="3.63">their hands through these guys and</text>
  <text start="1106.86" dur="2.549">there&amp;#39;s more no that&amp;#39;s probably more</text>
  <text start="1108.12" dur="3.24">research as they have these are just the</text>
  <text start="1109.409" dur="4.14">a lot of the popular ones you can look</text>
  <text start="1111.36" dur="4.59">up it&amp;#39;s about hundred years ago they get</text>
  <text start="1113.549" dur="5.581">a lot of advanced research about seventy</text>
  <text start="1115.95" dur="5.76">years ago they take that research and</text>
  <text start="1119.13" dur="5">they were able to shoot themselves down</text>
  <text start="1121.71" dur="5.01">a nice little present is in the desert</text>
  <text start="1124.13" dur="4.12">near Roswell and they were able to</text>
  <text start="1126.72" dur="5.429">reverse-engineer that and get some</text>
  <text start="1128.25" dur="7.32">really cool technology once they found</text>
  <text start="1132.149" dur="6.9">out the you know the breadth of this how</text>
  <text start="1135.57" dur="6.93">how important all of this was to keep</text>
  <text start="1139.049" dur="6.031">secret boom they kept it they kept a</text>
  <text start="1142.5" dur="5.85">secret as of that year and they&amp;#39;ve thus</text>
  <text start="1145.08" dur="6">classified a lot of patents lot a lot of</text>
  <text start="1148.35" dur="4.5">patents so we have really advanced</text>
  <text start="1151.08" dur="3.99">technology that they&amp;#39;ve been kept secret</text>
  <text start="1152.85" dur="4.26">for a long time and they&amp;#39;ve taken a</text>
  <text start="1155.07" dur="7.829">whole ton of money from us to build it</text>
  <text start="1157.11" dur="9.63">all out build out spacecraft build out</text>
  <text start="1162.899" dur="5.731">giant bases underground do research and</text>
  <text start="1166.74" dur="4.049">do a whole lot of black projects with a</text>
  <text start="1168.63" dur="3.84">lot of really cool science but they</text>
  <text start="1170.789" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t tell us about it</text>
  <text start="1172.47" dur="3.75">because mainly a lot of it is nefarious</text>
  <text start="1174.539" dur="3.961">in nature and we probably get a little</text>
  <text start="1176.22" dur="6.059">pissed off if you&amp;#39;re not already at</text>
  <text start="1178.5" dur="5.429">what&amp;#39;s going on so just think of these</text>
  <text start="1182.279" dur="3.851">things right as a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1183.929" dur="4.811">information begins to come out</text>
  <text start="1186.13" dur="6.12">more so more whistleblowers more info</text>
  <text start="1188.74" dur="5.63">yada yada and also more of these soft</text>
  <text start="1192.25" dur="4.41">disclosures in the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1194.37" dur="5.08">understanding this information will be</text>
  <text start="1196.66" dur="4.8">able to help you see through whatever BS</text>
  <text start="1199.45" dur="6.18">the mainstream media tries to feed us</text>
  <text start="1201.46" dur="6.03">and also give you a big massive dot to</text>
  <text start="1205.63" dur="3.21">help connect your understanding of</text>
  <text start="1207.49" dur="6.45">what&amp;#39;s going on in the geopolitical</text>
  <text start="1208.84" dur="7.5">picture and yeah it also helps you</text>
  <text start="1213.94" dur="4.29">understand that NASA sucks and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1216.34" dur="3.3">Allah never a straight answer</text>
  <text start="1218.23" dur="3.809">NASA write a lot of stuff they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1219.64" dur="4.89">tell us so that&amp;#39;s the secret space</text>
  <text start="1222.039" dur="3.811">program for you guys a lot of advanced</text>
  <text start="1224.53" dur="2.58">research that&amp;#39;s been built up to the</text>
  <text start="1225.85" dur="4.68">tunes of trillions of dollars that</text>
  <text start="1227.11" dur="6.09">should be honest but hasn&amp;#39;t so learn up</text>
  <text start="1230.53" dur="5.37">on it spread this information with your</text>

  <text start="1235.9" dur="6.05">hear it</text>
  <text start="1236.44" dur="8.03">and that&amp;#39;s the only way right as the</text>
  <text start="1241.95" dur="5.56">second director of Lockheed skunkworks</text>
  <text start="1244.47" dur="6.66">what was his name what was his name Ben</text>
  <text start="1247.51" dur="6.09">rich as Ben rich said in a 1993 speech</text>
  <text start="1251.13" dur="4.63">we already have the technology to take</text>
  <text start="1253.6" dur="4.38">e.t home but it will take an act of God</text>
  <text start="1255.76" dur="4.77">to bring it out to humanity though</text>
  <text start="1257.98" dur="6.99">that&amp;#39;s what he is quoted as saying that</text>
